            "text": "Guinea pigs are incapable of endogenous synthesis of vitamin C. 1 Guinea pigs require a dietary source of vitamin C (ascorbic acid) because they lack L-gluconolactone oxidase, an enzyme involved in the synthesis of ascorbic acid from glucose. Nonbreeding adult guinea pigs require 10 mg/kg daily of ascorbic acid. Higher levels should be provided for growing and pregnant animals; 30 mg/kg/daily of vitamin C is recommended for a pregnant sow. 2, 3 The recommended diet for pet guinea pigs should include pellets formulated specifically for this species, grass hay (e.g., timothy, orchard grass, oat), and supplemented fresh vegetables. Alfalfa pellets are suitable for young, growing, and pregnant guinea pigs. After the guinea pig is 1 year of age and fully developed, a timothy-based pellet, which provides less calcium and more fiber, is better suited to prevent urolithiasis, obesity, and digestive and dental problems. Good-quality hay should be available at all times. Fruits, rolled oats, and dry cereals should only be offered as treats in very small quantities, if at all. 3 Commercially available guinea pig pellets are fortified with ascorbic acid; however, approximately half of the initial vitamin C content may be oxidized and lost 90 days after the diet has been mixed. It may be better to assume that the pellets no longer contain adequate levels of vitamin C and instead supplement this vitamin in a tablet form or as fresh greens to ensure adequate daily intake occurs. Foods that contain high levels of ascorbic acid are leafy greens (e.g., kale, parsley, beet greens, chicory, spinach), red and green peppers, broccoli, tomatoes, kiwi fruit, and oranges. Vitamin C can be added to the water at 1 g/L; however, water supplemented with added vitamin C loses more than 50% of its vitamin C content within 24 hours, and consequently the drinking water must be changed daily. 3 It is normal for guinea pigs to eat their soft cecal feces directly from the anus. 4",

Chinchillas are almost odorless and are most active at dusk and night but can be active during the day. Flight is their primary defense mechanism and these animals rarely bite. Chinchillas do not tolerate dampness and are prone to heat stroke at temperatures greater than 82\u00b0F to 86\u00b0F (28\u00b0C to 30\u00b0C). 3 Frequent dust baths are necessary to maintain the health of their luxurious fur. Commercial chinchilla dust baths are available, but a homemade alternative using a 9:1 mixture of silver sand to Fuller's earth can be used. Beach or playground sand is not suitable to use for a chinchilla dust bath. Excessive use of dust baths can lead to conjunctivitis. 3 When frightened, chinchillas can shed patches of fur, a condition known as \"fur-slip.\" It can take 6 to 8 weeks for these hairless patches to regrow, and longer for the patch to become indistinguishable from the surrounding fur. 3 Chinchillas eat and defecate mainly at night. 3 The accepted formula for chinchilla pellets is 16% to 20% protein, 2% to 5% fat, and 15% to 35% bulk fiber. 5, 6 Nonbreeding animals do well on a diet of good-quality grass hay supplemented with small amounts of chinchilla or rabbit pellets, fresh vegetables, and grains. 7 One to two tablespoons of pellets per day should be sufficient for a nonbreeding adult animal. A pellets-only diet has insufficient roughage and can predispose the chinchilla to enteritis. Limit treats to not more than 1 teaspoon per day for such items as grains, dried apples, raisins, figs, hazelnuts, and sunflower seeds. Abrupt dietary changes will lead to temporary but dramatic decreases in food intake. 3 Chinchillas produce 2 types of fecal matter: nitrogen-rich cecal pellets that they consume and nitrogen-poor excreted fecal pellets, which are left uneaten. 3 ",

The common rat species maintained as a companion animal is Rattus norvegicus, with the white rat and the hooded rat being the most common variations. Rats are not as territorial as other rodent species and are very social. 8 Pine and cedar shavings are not recommended because of the volatile oils that are irritating to the respiratory tract of these and other rodent species. 9 Rats are one of the most commonly used laboratory animals in scientific investigations; therefore, their dietary requirements have been intensely studied and commercially produced diets that provide the recommended daily nutritional requirements are available. Pet rat owners often buy seed-based diets that are lacking in the appropriate nutritional requirements needed to maintain long-term health. Commercial rodent blocks or pellets with 20% to 27% protein are the recommended dietary offering for pet rats. The commercial rodent pellets are the only food rats need to obtain their required nutrients. Seed-based diets are not recommended; significant supplementation of fruits, nuts, vegetables, cheese, or other human foods is also not recommended. For younger rats, less than 3 weeks old, softer pellets are needed because babies start eating pellets and drinking water at 2 to 3 weeks of age. A sipper bottle is recommended for the animal's drinking water. Accidental or negligent water deprivation is a common problem. The bottle should be checked for blockage or leakage, and the water should be changed daily so that accidental water deprivation is avoided. 3",

Obtain a rectal temperature early during the examination process on larger individuals, before the animal becomes excited or stressed. The physical examination starts at the head and systematically progresses toward the tail. Eyes, ears, and nares are observed for signs of discharge or inflammation. Next, examine the fur, skin, and mucous membranes. Examine the skin for hair coat quality, alopecia, external parasites, or any skin abnormalities. Especially take care to note any salivation on the chin and forelimbs, because dental disease often causes excess salivation (slobbers). Auscultation of both the thorax and abdomen is best done when the animal is least stressed. A small pediatric or neonatal stethoscope is recommended for small rodent patients, as well as other avian/exotic species. Body condition should be assessed, and abdominal palpation performed. Lymph nodes and limbs should be palpated. Check the nails and plantar surfaces of each foot and examine the rectal area for staining and impaction. Observe the genitalia and note any abnormalities. Because of the potential stress associated with inspecting the oral cavity, the author prefers to hold this to the end of the examination.

These sites are best accessed with the animal under anesthesia to reduce patient stress and movement. The benefits of obtaining diagnostic samples must be weighted against the risk of anesthesia for each individual patient. 16 Because of the small patient size and difficulty obtaining a sample, routine hematology is seldom performed in pet mice and hamsters. Approximately 0.5 to 0.7 mL/100 g body weight can be safely removed from a nonanemic healthy rat, mouse, or hamster. In addition to the above-mentioned sites, the ventral tail vein may be used in rats and mice. Warming the tail for 15 minutes before sample collection will aid in vessel visualization. 3, 8, 11 In mice and hamsters, venipuncture must be performed with the animal under anesthesia. A warmed ventral tail vein or artery and the anterior vena cava may be used for blood collection in mice.

Clinical presentations suited to diagnostic radiographic imaging of hamsters include impaction of the cheek pouches, bloat, and abdominal masses. 18 Both ventrodorsal and lateral views should be obtained. Unless the animal is extremely debilitated and does not fight restraint, sedation may be necessary in guinea pigs and chinchillas and is usually required for the smaller rodent species to obtain diagnostic radiographic images and reduce stress on the patient. Care should be taken to extend the limbs when positioning the patient to minimize rotation and the superimposition of the limbs over the abdomen or thorax; masking tape can be used to hold the legs in extension. A high-speed, 300-mA machine with fine or detail-intensifying screens is usually adequate to get diagnostic images. Dental radiography units that can focus at short distances may be helpful for isolating focal anatomy. In these small patients, individual organs may be poorly defined in the radiographic images. 8, 11, 16, 19 Ultrasonography Ultrasound is useful in the diagnosis of intraabdominal pathology, especially when investigating cysts, abdominal effusion, neoplasia, and urinary tract cal-culi. Sedation or anesthesia is often necessary to obtain a quick diagnostic ultrasound examination, but may be performed without anesthesia if the pet is properly restrained. To prevent hypothermia, the gel must be warmed, and the fur should remain intact. For best results, a B-mode 10-MHz transducer is recommended. 20 Guinea pigs often have a large amount of gas accumulation in the GI tract, thereby limiting the diagnostic value of an abdominal ultrasound in this species. 12 Chinchillas have a large cecum; if it contains a large amount of gas, the value of an abdominal ultrasound will also be reduced. 16 ",

Many guinea pigs react to the discomfort caused by subcutaneous fluid administration and become stressed, but chinchillas usually tolerate this treatment without difficulty. When grasping the skin to introduce the needle, care should be taken to avoid causing fur slip in chinchillas. A 22-to 25-gauge butterfly catheter is recommended for delivering fluids, because it allows the patient to move around while the fluids are being delivered and it does not have to be pulled out and reinserted. 3 Fluids are usually administered at 100 mL/kg body weight per day divided every 8 to 12 hours (25-35 mL per site) in guinea pigs and chinchillas. 21 Fluids administered through the intraperitoneal route are presumed to be absorbed via the serosal surfaces of the viscera and the peritoneal membrane. This route is suitable for moderately to severely dehydrated animals and for animals with collapsed peripheral veins. Larger boluses of fluids can be provided intraperitoneally, but care should be taken to avoid inducing ascites; direct visualization or ultrasonography can be used to assess whether fluid accumulation is occurring. The patient should be placed in dorsal recumbency during the procedure, because the organs will fall away from the injection site by gravity. The needle should be inserted at a 20\u00b0t o 30\u00b0angle off the abdominal wall to minimize the likelihood of inserting the needle into the viscera. Aspirate the syringe before delivering the fluids to ensure that the fluids are not going to be delivered into an organ. The fluids should always be prepared at body temperature. 3, 16 Indwelling peripheral intravenous catheters can be used, but are often difficult to place because of the small size of the patients. Better success may be achieved with intraosseous catheters. Use a local anesthetic when placing an intraosseous catheter to help reduce stress and movement of the patient. The proximal femur and tibia are the preferred sites to insert intraosseus catheters. For a catheter being Approach to Rodents as Patients placed into the proximal femur, the space between the neck of the femur and the greater trochanter should be used as the insertion landmark. For catheters being placed into the proximal tibia, the tibial crest is the insertion landmark. A spinal needle with a stylet should be used to prevent obstruction of the needle with a bone and/or tissue core. The catheters can be secured by placing tape in a butterfly pattern over the end of the catheter and suturing it to the skin. 16 Intravenous catheters can be placed in the cephalic vein, lateral and medial saphenous veins, and jugular veins. Sedation will facilitate catheter placement. An Elizabethan collar constructed out of radiographic film may be used to prevent the patient from chewing the catheter setup. 16 Fluid therapy can be provided to rats and mice through subcutaneous, intraperitoneal, and intravenous routes. Up to 10 mL of fluid may be given via a 25-gauge needle in rats, 1 to 3 mL in mice. Although the lateral tail vein is often mentioned as a location in which intravenous fluids may be administered, it is technically difficult to access. Warming the tail of rats and mice 15 minutes before venipuncture with warm water allows for better visualization of the lateral tail vein. Intraosseous catheters are much easier to place in mice than intravenous catheters. The tibial plateau and the greater trochanter are the anatomic sites of choice for intraosseous catheter placement. 17 A combination of crystalloid (10-15 mL/kg at rapid infusion) and colloid (5 mL/kg Hetastarch over 5-10 minutes) fluid therapy via an intraosseous catheter is recommended for rehydration in hamster patients. Crystalloid fluids alone can be administered by subcutaneous or intraperitoneal routes if vascular access is not possible. The shock fluid dose for hamsters is 65 to 80 mL/kg. 22",

Otherwise, an isotonic solution, such as sterile physiologic saline solution, should be used. 3 Oral treatment with a dropper or tuberculin syringe is technically the easiest and least stressful for the patient, especially when used for the very small species. Both oral medication and nutritional supplementation can be administered through a bulbed stainless-steel feeding needle or flexible red rubber feeding tube. The length of the tube should be premeasured, externally from the nares to the last rib, and marked. A water-based lubricant should be applied to the feeding tube before it is inserted through the intradental space toward the back of the oral cavity. The animal can be restrained for the procedure by scruffing the dorsal neck skin fold and holding the body with the remaining free fingers. The tube should advance without difficulty until the premeasured mark is reached. 8 Oral medication via gastric gavage or oral syringe is preferred over food or water medication, because ill rodents are unlikely to ingest food and water in appropriate amounts.",

Use of an otoscope, vaginal speculum, or an endoscope enables direct visualization of the cheek teeth through the narrow oral cavity. Dental specula and pouch dilators are invaluable in obtaining an adequate view of the molars and premolars. The oral cavity may need to be rinsed out with warm water via a curved-tipped syringe if food material is hindering visualization. Abnormal oral examination findings may include an uneven occlusal surface or angle of the incisors and/or cheek teeth, formation of sharp points with or without associated ulceration of the oral mucosa, food impaction, and abnormal spaces between teeth. Abscessation of the molar and the premolar apices can also occur with the overgrowth of these teeth. Careful palpation of the ventral mandible and maxilla may reveal bony protruberances that correspond to overgrowth of the apical surfaces of the cheek teeth. The apical surfaces of maxillary teeth can overgrow and impinge on the nasolacrimal duct, causing ocular discharge. The apices can also overgrow into the nasal cavity, which may result in the seeding of the sinuses with bacteria from the oral cavity, causing nasal discharge. 3, 16 Skull radiographs: Radiographs help evaluate the extent and magnitude of the disease process. Lateral, left and right (45\u00b0) obliques, dorsoventral or ventrodorsal, and apical (rostrocaudal) views are recommended. One or more intraoral dental views may also be useful. 33 Even if the oral examination is fairly normal, significant disease can be present in the tooth anatomy found below the gingival surface (e.g., apical abscesses, osteomyelitis, root elongation, crown elongation). Treatment. Dental malocclusion is a disease to be managed for life and is rarely cured. Owners should be made aware of the long-term expenses and prognosis for their pet once a diagnosis has been made and before any further treatment on the patient.

Rectal prolapse may occur from excessive straining. With ileus, there may not be any straining or attempts to defecate. Chinchillas are highly dependent on the function of their GI tract to provide essential calories in the form of volatile fatty acids. When chinchillas become dehydrated, the shift of the fluid balance to maintain the function of the brain and heart often comes at the expense of the GI tract. As the shift in the fluid balance occurs, GI motility diminishes, microflora changes occur, and the animals reduce their dietary intake and production of calories. If left untreated, these patients die. 16 The usual cause of GI stasis in the chinchilla patient is associated with feeding too much of a concentrated diet, which is high in energy and protein, without supplying sufficient roughage or fiber. 35 Dental disease, insufficient water intake, intestinal atony in older animals, or lack of exercise may be contributing factors to the GI stasis condition. Other causes of constipation include obesity, intestinal obstruction, and intestinal compression secondary to large fetuses. 3, 36 Diagnosis. Diagnosis of GI stasis in chinchillas is determined by evaluation of the husbandry and dietary history of the patient, assessment of fecal material, or lack thereof, and physical examination.

            "text": "Features. The most common cause for diarrhea in pet chinchillas is inappropriate feeding. This includes overfeeding fresh greens and offering damp hay that may be moldy or too young. Stress and sudden changes in the diet also seem to predispose chinchillas to diarrhea. The owner may first notice that feces are smeared on the resting boards in the cage and that the fur around the anus is matted with feces. 3 Bacterial and parasitic infections can also cause diarrhea, but usually the owner describes signs of diarrhea that have been present for a few days. These chinchillas are often lethargic and have dry, dull fur. Because an animal may camouflage diarrhea by cleaning itself, fecal staining of the fur is not always apparent. Enteric disease from Yersinia pseudotuberculosis, Y. enterocolitica, Listeria monocytogenes, Salmonella spp., and Klebsiella spp. have been recorded in chinchillas. 3 Enterotoxemia cases associated with Clostridium species have also been noted. 3 The indigenous microflora of chinchillas are predominantly Grampositive, and certain antibiotics can cause severe antibiotic-induced dysbiosis. Enteral administration of penicillins (e.g., amoxicillin, ampicillin), macrolides (e.g., erythromycin, lincomycin), and first-generation cephalosporins are most commonly associated with these pathologic changes in a chinchilla's GI flora. 38 Antibiotics that are generally considered safe to use for chinchillas diagnosed with diarrhea include chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, enrofloxacin, and trimethoprim-sulfa. 16 Chinchillas can carry Giardia spp. in low numbers and show no clinical disease signs. Stress and poor husbandry are believed to cause an increase in parasite numbers, resulting in severe diarrhea and death. Signs of giardiasis include a cyclic sequence of appetite loss and diarrhea associated with a declining body and hair coat condition. 3 Diagnosis. Evaluation of husbandry and diet is important in assessing the cause and precipitating factors that may be associated with the diagnosis of diarrhea in a chinchilla patient. Giardia spp. can be identified on a fresh fecal smear or fecal trichrome stain. Treatment. If the diarrhea is acute, withholding food for the first day and adding a palatable oral electrolyte replacement solution such as Pedialyte (Ross, Columbus, OH USA) or Rebound (NPS Inc., Atlanta, GA USA) to the drinking water is recommended. A well-dried, high-quality hay should be offered on the second day, and an electrolyte solution administered SC if the animal is dehydrated. 3, 37 If giardiasis is suspected, treat with metronidazole (20 mg/kg PO every 24 hours), albendazole (25 mg/kg PO every 12 hours for 2 days), or fenbendazole (30 mg/kg PO every 24 hours for 3 days). 3 Rectal prolapse may occur with diarrhea. Reduce the prolapse as described previously; however, the underlying diarrhea must be treated if the secondary prolapsed condition is to resolve. 3",

Often the only sign an affected rat patient will exhibit is sudden death. Purulent exudate may be seen around the nares and on the front paws from wiping of the nostrils. A tentative diagnosis may be based on identifying numerous Gram-positive diplococci on a Gram stain of the respiratory exudates or in a sample submitted for cytologic examination. Severe bacteremia is an important consequence of advanced disease and results in multiorgan abscesses and infarction. Treatment. For CRD, treat with enrofloxacin (10 mg/kg PO every 12 hours for 7 days) alone or in combination with doxycycline hyclate (5 mg/kg PO every 12 hours for 7 days). Alternatively, azithromycin (20 mg/kg every 24 hours 7 days) has been used with success. 41 Although Mycoplasma pulmonis and CAR bacillus are susceptible to this antibiotic therapy, the respiratory viruses are not. Warn owners that antibiotic treatment will not cure CRD but may alleviate clinical signs. Reducing ammonia levels in the animal's environment by changing the substrate daily and supplementing the diet with vitamins A and E may help decrease the clinical signs associated with CRD. With advanced cases, treatment with bronchodilators (e.g., aminophylline, theophylline) and antiinflammatory drugs (Meloxicam) are also indicated. Nebulization or use of a steam vaporizer is also recommended to enhance the efficacy of the treatment protocol. 42",

Cytologic findings from these exudates typically consist of suppurative inflammation with a mixed-bacterial population. Gram stain, anaerobic and aerobic culture and sensitivity, and Pasteurella spp. serology should be considered in the diagnostic testing protocol when trying to confirm the causative agent(s) of a rat abscess. 44, 45 Treatment. Treat with systemic antibiotics, based on culture and sensitivity results, for at least 2 weeks. A penicillin (22,000 IU/kg SC, IM every 24 hours) or cephalosporin antibiotic agent is often effective when treating rat abscesses. Lance and drain the abscess and debride necrotic tissue as needed. Flush the wound thoroughly with saline solution. Prognosis is generally good when a rat abscess is treated aggressively and the appropriate protocol is used. 3, 44 Mice",

Nonparasitic alopecia or dermatitis includes behavioral disorders, husbandry-related problems, and infectious and idiopathic conditions. 3, 8 Social dominance is manifested as barbering and fighting. In group-housed mice, the dominant mouse nibbles off the whiskers and hair around the muzzle and eyes of subservient cage mates. There are no other lesions associated with this condition, and only the most dominant mouse retains all its fur. Removal of the dominant mouse may solve the problem, but another mouse might take its place in the cage hierarchy and engage in the same behavior. Fighting among cagemates, especially males, is common and mice can inflict severe bite wounds on each other. 3 Mechanical abrasion on the cage bars or other cage components may result in alopecia alone or with associated dermatitis. Removing or replacing the offending part of the cage or cage component with better designed nonabrasive equipment often will solve the problem. 3 Mice are social animals, and individually housed mice can display aberrant stereotypic behavior that may result in alopecia. Providing environmental enrichment toys such as running wheels or hollow tubes will usually resolve this condition. 3 Many chronic or ulcerative skin problems are considered idiopathic with secondary bacterial infec-tions (Fig 7) . This group is commonly unresponsive to either topical or systemic treatment, and affected individuals are often euthanized.

Sendai virus is associated with an acute respiratory tract infection in which mice display chattering and mild respiratory distress. Although neonates and weanlings may die of this disease, adults often recover within 2 months. When the disease expression exceeds its common clinical presentation, there most likely is a concurrent mycoplasmal infection involved. Mycoplasma pulmonis causes chronic pneumonia, suppurative rhinitis, and occasionally otitis media, and results in purulent exudate accumulating in inflamed and thickened nasal passages, causing chattering and dyspnea. Survivors develop chronic bronchopneumonia, bronchiectasis, and occasionally pulmonary abscesses. 3, 8 Diagnosis. History and physical examination: as above.",

Enterocolitis and resultant diarrhea can be caused by a number of different enteric pathogens. Proliferative ileitis commonly occurs in 3-to 10-weekold hamsters and results in high mortality of the individuals affected. Wet tail is most commonly caused by the intracellular bacterium Lawsonia intracellularis. Escherichia coli, Campylobacter jejuni, Helicobacter aurati, Salmonella spp., and Pasteurella pneumotropica have also Approach to Rodents as Patients been identified as organisms associated with diarrhea in hamsters. The etiology may be multifactorial in both youngsters and adults and precipitated by stressors such as overheating, high humidity, overcrowding, malnutrition, dietary changes, and shipping. Concurrent parasitic infection with a tapeworm (e.g., Hymenolepis nana) or protozoa (e.g., Giardia spp., Entamoeba spp., Spironucleus muris, trichomonads) may impair gut defense mechanisms and predispose the animal to secondary bacterial gastroenteritis. 3, 51 Treatment for hamsters diagnosed with diarrhea includes correction of electrolyte imbalance and dehydration, antibiotic administration, and nutritional support. Antibiotic treatments that have been recommended are tetracycline hydrochloride (400 mg/L drinking water for 10 days), tetracycline (10 mg/kg PO twice per day for 5-7 days), enrofloxacin (10 mg/kg PO or IM every 12 hours for 5-7 days), and trimethoprim-sulfa (30 mg/kg PO every 12 hours for 5-7 days). Symptomatic treatment with bismuth subsalicylate may be administered if diarrhea persists. Give electrolyte replacement fluids such as saline solution or lactated Ringer's solution at a dose of 20 mL/100 sg every 24 hours. Offer liquid or soft foods, or a nutritional supplement such as Critical Care. If the hamster does not eat, force-feed small amounts of the Critical Care formula. Potential sequelae to proliferative ileitis are obstruction, intussusception and rectal prolapse. 3, 11 Diarrhea in adult hamsters is often associated with enterotoxemia caused by Clostridium difficile and may develop 3 to 5 days after treatment with antibiotics such as penicillin, lincomycin, or bacitracin. Vancomycin given at 20 mg/kg PO every 24 hours for 3\u03e9 months has been reported as a treatment for enterotoxemia due to antibiotic administration. 52 Tyzzer's disease is caused by infection of the gastrointestinal tract with Clostridium piliforme and is not observed in immunocompetent hamsters. Clinical signs of Tyzzer's disease in hamsters are nonspecific and include death, without premonitory signs; or an unkempt, scruffy pelage; depression; dehydration; and diarrhea. Gross necropsy generally reveals multiple necrotic hepatic foci and, if present, intestinal lesions. This GI disease may be precipitated by environmental factors, such as overcrowding, high environmental temperature, heavy parasite load, and poor diet. Treatment may be unrewarding but is based on supportive care and appropriate antimicrobial therapy. 3",
