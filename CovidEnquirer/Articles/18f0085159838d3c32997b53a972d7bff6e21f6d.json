ACE2 is a newly described enzyme identified in rodents and humans with a more restricted distribution than ACE, and is found mainly in heart and kidney. ACE2 cleaves a single residue from angiotensin I (Ang I) to generate Ang 1 -9, and degrades Ang II, the main effector of the RAS, to the vasodilator Ang 1-7. The importance of ACE2 in normal physiology and pathophysiological states is largely unknown. ACE2 might act in a counter-regulatory manner to ACE, modulating the balance between vasoconstrictors and vasodilators within the heart and kidney, and playing a significant role in regulating cardiovascular and renal function.",

Schematic diagram of the classical RAS (left), showing the main pathway for angiotensin II (Ang II) generation from Ang I via angiotensin-converting enzyme (ACE). In the classical view, Ang II mediates all known effects via the AT1 receptor. On the right is the updated view of the RAS, showing the role of ACE2 in degrading Ang I to Ang 1 -9, and Ang II to the vasodilator Ang 1 -7. In this version of the RAS, Ang II also mediates effects via the G-protein-coupled AT2 receptor, whereas Ang 1 -7 acts through the Mas receptor. than a dipeptidyl carboxypeptidase. Thus, ACE2 removes a single C-terminal Leu residue from Ang I to generate Ang 1 -9, a peptide with no known function. Although ACE2 was described originally for its ability to generate Ang 1 -9 from Ang I [4] , it also degrades Ang II to the biologically active peptide, Ang 1 -7 [9] ( Figure 1 ). Indeed, in vitro studies indicate that the catalytic efficiency of ACE2 for Ang II is 400-fold greater than for Ang I [9] , indicating that the major role for ACE2 is the conversion of Ang II to Ang 1 -7. The potential role of Ang 1 -7 as a cardioprotective peptide with vasodilator, anti-growth and anti-proliferative actions has been recognized relatively recently [6, 10] . Taken together, the data suggest that ACE2 might function to limit the vasoconstrictor action of Ang II through its inactivation, in addition to counteracting the actions of Ang II through the formation of the agonist, Ang 1 -7. Recent studies [11] have identified the G-protein-coupled receptor encoded by the MAS1 protooncogene, Mas, as the receptor for Ang 1-7 [11] . Genetic deletion of the Mas receptor abolished the binding of Ang 1 -7 to whole mouse kidney, whereas the functional significance of Ang 1 -7 and its receptor was demonstrated by studies showing that Mas-deficient mice could not respond with antidiuresis to Ang 1-7 after a water load, and that the aortas of Mas-deficient mice were unable to relax in response to Ang 1 -7 [11] .",

There has been increasing interest in peptides that are either cleaved or generated by this enzyme. In addition to effects on the angiotensin peptides, ACE2 cleaves the C-terminal residue of the peptides des-Arg9-bradykinin, neurotensin 1 -13 and kinetensin [4] , and hydrolyses apelin-13 and dynorphin A 1 -13 with as high a catalytic efficiency as Ang II [9] . ACE2 has no effect on bradykinin, in contrast to ACE, emphasizing the specificity of ACE2 [4, 9] . Many of the in vitro substrates of ACE2 have actions that are relevant to cardiovascular regulation; apelin is a potent cardiac inotrope [15] , dynorphin A is an endogenous opioid neuropeptide and des-Arg9-bradykinin binds to the bradykinin B1 receptor, which is activated by inflammation and tissue injury [16] .",

Support for this idea comes from studies in the rat myocardial infarction (MI) model, in which the development of heart failure was associated with increased Ang 1 -7 immunoreactivity [24] . Furthermore, infusion of Ang 1 -7 attenuated the development of heart failure after MI, confirming the functional significance of Ang 1 -7 [25] .

            "text": "The identification of ACE2 in the heart and kidney, its modulation in heart failure and diabetes, and the recent description that this enzyme plays a biological role in the generation and degradation of angiotensin peptides provides a rationale for the further exploration of its role in pathophysiological states, including myocardial ischaemia, renal failure, atherosclerosis, and diabetic complications. Many questions remain to be answered about ACE2 (Box 1), in particular the impact of ACE2 on the generation of bioactive peptides, but clarification of the role of ACE2 in health and disease will be assisted by the development of agents that modulate ACE2 activity. The discovery of ACE2 has opened up an exciting new area of cardiovascular and renal physiology, in addition to providing the possibility of identifying novel therapeutic targets.",
