In infectious settings, they help to resolve the proinflammatory response, thereby minimizing bystander damage but also potentially delaying or preventing pathogen clearance (Belkaid, 2007) . T reg cells may also be required for efficient immune cell entry into sites of infection (Lund et al., 2008) . Pathogen-specific T reg cells have been detected in a few studies using whole pathogen preparations as targets, without identification of specific target epitopes. In mice infected with Leishmania major or Toxoplasma gondii, parasitespecific T reg cells were demonstrated, but the target antigen or epitope was not further identified (Suffia et al., 2006; Oldenhove et al., 2009) . In another study, T reg cells specific for a Mycobacteria tuberculosis epitope (Mtb) were studied using Mtb-specific TCR Tg cells, but T reg cells specific for this epitope were not found in the natural infection and no Mtb-specific T reg cell target epitope has thus far been identified (Shafiani et al., 2010) . Identification of pathogen-specific epitopes recognized by T reg cells would facilitate their study and therapeutic use in disease settings.",

In addition, after stimulation with anti-CD3 mAb, the fraction of T reg cells expressing IFN-\ue067 increased two-to fourfold, suggesting that M133 + S358-specific T reg cells accounted for only a fraction of all IFN-\ue067 + T reg cells in the CNS (Fig. 2, B-D) . Notably, the mean fluorescence intensity of IFN-\ue067 expression was lower in M133 + S358-specific T reg cells compared with effector CD4 T cells, indicating less expression on a per-cell basis (Fig. 2 F) . To verify that T reg cells produce IFN-\ue067 in vivo, we treated B6 mice with brefeldin A (BFA) at 6 d after infection (Fig. 2 E; Liu and Whitton, 2005) . In the absence of BFA, some Foxp3 \ue032 CD4 T cells were IFN-\ue067 + , consistent with results showing that cells in the infected brain express IFN-\ue067 in the absence of ex vivo stimulation (Fig. 2 A) . The frequency of Foxp3 \ue032 and Foxp3 + cells expressing IFN-\ue067 increased twofold and In this paper, we identify two epitopes (M133 and S358) targeted by T reg cells in the rJ2.2-infected central nervous system (CNS). Both epitopes are also recognized by effector T cells (Haring et al., 2001) . These virus epitope-specific T reg cells express both IL-10 and IFN-\ue067, suppress proliferation of virus-specific effector cells after stimulation with cognate peptide, and are present throughout the acute and resolution phases of the infection. Virus-specific T reg cells appear to arise, at least in part, from natural T reg cell pools because they are detected in naive Foxp3 gfp mice and mice retrogenic (Rg) for an M133-specific T cell receptor (TCR) and express the transcription factor helios.",

We also identified IFN-\ue067 + T reg cells specific for a second rJ2.2-specific CD4 T cell epitope, S358 in the CNS.

Virus-specific IFN-\ue067 + T reg cells were detected as early as 6 d after infection, at the same Br ief Definitive Repor t fivefold, respectively, after in vivo BFA treatment, confirming in situ IFN-\ue067 expression by T reg cells.

Our results demonstrate the presence of virus-specific Foxp3 + T reg cells in the rJ2.2-infected CNS but also show that they are present at a low frequency (Figs. 1 and 2) . Detection was initially facilitated by the availability of M133-specific MHC class II tetramers. However, we previously showed that this tetramer was not as efficient as cytokine expression in identifying M133-specific effector CD4 T cells (Zhao et al., 2009) . Subsequently, we identified a greater frequency of M133-specific T reg cells by cytokine staining for IL-10 and IFN-\ue067 after peptide stimulation. IL-10 expression may be particularly from the brains of rJ2.2-infected Foxp3 gfp mice at day 7 after infection and used them in direct ex vivo suppression assays. As a control, we isolated GFP + T reg cells from mice infected with rJ2.2.M Y135Q , which does not express epitope M133. As shown in Fig. 4 A, T reg cells harvested from rJ2.2, but not from rJ2.2.M Y135Q -infected mice, suppressed proliferation of brain-derived effector T cells after M133 peptide stimulation.

After stimulation, epitope-specific CD4 T cells useful for detecting epitope-specific T reg cells because IL-10 was produced in virally infected mice and in mice with EAE after peptide stimulation ( Fig. 3 and Fig. S5 ). IFN-\ue067 production by T reg cells was previously demonstrated in a lethal toxoplasmosis infection (Oldenhove et al., 2009 ), but our results indicate that IFN-\ue067 is also expressed in the context of a nonlethal viral infection and continues even as the inflammatory response subsides (Fig. 2) . The continued expression of IFN-\ue067 by virus-specific T reg cells likely occurs because virus antigen persists in the infected CNS (Bergmann et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2009) . Epitope M133-specific T reg cells suppressed proliferation of effector CD4 T cells responding to the same epitope, suggesting that if IFN-\ue067 expression diminishes T reg cell suppressive function, its effect is limited. rJ2.2specific T reg cells were detected in the CNS and not draining CLNs or spleen ( Fig. 1 and not depicted) , suggesting that they function by directly inhibiting T cell function or diminishing antigen presentation by microglia or other antigen-presenting cells at the site of inflammation.",

In several infectious diseases, including patients infected with West Nile virus or Dengue fever virus, higher T reg cell frequencies correlated with improved outcomes (L\u00fchn et al., 2007; Lanteri et al., 2009) . Relevant for our results, Mtb-specific TCR Tg T reg cells were more potently suppressive than Mtb-nonspecific TCR Tg T reg cells in infected mice (Shafiani et al., 2010) . Furthermore, although transfer of natural T reg cells diminished disease in the setting of autoimmune disease, suppression was estimated to be \ue07a20-50-fold more potent if T reg cells were specific for an epitope at a site of inflammation (Tang et al., 2004; Tarbell et al., 2004) . Thus, islet-specific T reg cells prevented diabetes in NOD mice, whereas nonspecific T reg cells at the same dosage could not. If true for rJ2.2-specific T reg cells, these cells may be especially potent in diminishing immunopathology in mice with encephalomyelitis and would be most activated and, thereby, suppressive during acute infection when viral antigen is maximal (Bergmann et al., 2006) . Intracellular cytokine staining. To detect cytokine production by antigen-specific CD4 + effector T cells (T eff cells) and T reg cells, mononuclear cells isolated from the brain and spinal cord were stimulated with 5 \u00b5M of peptides M133, S358, M133 + S358 (rJ2.2 infection), or MOG 35-55 (in EAE) in complete RPMI 1640 medium for 6 h at 37\u00b0C, in the presence of 1 \u00b5l/ml Golgi plug (BD) and antigen-presenting cells (CHB3 cells, B cell line, H-2D b , I-A b ). The rJ2.2-specific epitopes encompass residues 133-147 of the transmembrane (M) protein and residues 358-372 of the surface (S) glycoprotein (Xue and Perlman, 1997; Haring et al., 2001) . Intracellular expression of IFN-\ue067, IL-10, TNF, IL-2, or IL-17 was assayed. For some samples, cells were pooled from two to four mice. In some experiments, infected mice were treated with 0.25 mg BFA (Sigma-Aldrich) or vehicle (5% DMSO) intravenously. 6 h later, CNS-derived lymphocytes were analyzed directly ex vivo for IFN-\ue067 expression as described previously (Liu and Whitton, 2005) .

An M133-specific TCR-\ue062 (V\ue0628.3, TRBV13-1) identified in three of three mice was produced synthetically (Geneart) and then cloned into a retroviral vector containing an IRES-GFP cassette to allow identification of transfected cells by GFP expression. Retroviral producer cell lines expressing this TCR-\ue062 were produced and used to transduce B6 donor bone marrow before reconstitution of lethally irradiated B6 recipient mice. After reconstitution, these Rg mice were infected with rJ2.2. The majority of CD4 T cells in the infected CNS were GFP + . I-A b /M133 tetramer + GFP + cells were sorted from the infected CNS and analyzed for TCR-\ue061 chain expression. Two TCR-\ue061 chains (V\ue0612.3 and TRAV14-1), differing by a single amino acid in the CDR3 region, were detected using RT-PCR-based cloning. One of these TCR-\ue061 was synthesized and cloned into the same retroviral vector described in this section. In this vector, the TCR-\ue061 and TCR-\ue062 chains are linked via the 2A protease, facilitating cleavage. Because the two chains are linked on the same molecule, they are produced in stoichiometric amounts. TCR Rg mice expressing both M133-specific TCR-\ue061 and TCR-\ue062 were produced. Epitope M133 specificity was confirmed by analysis of GFP + cells in the infected CNS using M133-specific tetramer and IFN-\ue067 expression after peptide stimulation.",
