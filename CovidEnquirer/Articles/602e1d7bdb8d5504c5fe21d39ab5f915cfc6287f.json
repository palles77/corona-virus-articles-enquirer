Raloxifene is a second-generation benzothiophene-derivative SERM and the sole compound approved for the prevention and treatment of postmenopausal osteoporosis (8 -10) . Certain randomized clinical trials demonstrated that raloxifene decreased the fracture risk of vertebra in postmenopausal osteoporosis but led to side effects such as thromboembolic disorder (11, 12) . These problems have in turn stimulated the development of next generation SERMs, which are more suitable for chronic therapy than raloxifene (9) .",

Osteoclast-like multi-nuclear giant cells appeared after 3 days of incuba-tion and expressed the tartrate-resistant acid phosphatase (data not shown), an osteoclast biomarker (18) . Several lacunae appeared on the surface of the mineralized calcium phosphate thin-film after 7 days of incubation (Fig.  2B) . Therefore, we conclude that osteoclast-like multinuclear giant cells in this culture system mediated bone MU314 inhibited bone resorption as potently as E 2 . The inhibitory effect of MU314 on lacunae formation by osteoclasts was attenuated by ICI-182,780, a pure E 2 antagonist (15) . Similarly, ICI-182,780 suppressed the inhibitory effects of E 2 . Therefore, these results strongly indicate that MU314 exerts anti-bone resorption activity by stimulating the estrogen receptor (ER).",

Evaluation of tibial bone mass by dual energy X-ray absorptiometry showed that the bone loss in OVX-rat occurred mainly at the proximal end. Histological observation of undecalcified thin sections revealed that the decreased bone mass resulted from the decline of cancellous bone volume and disappearance of trabecular structure in the proximal tibia of the metaphysis. These changes in bone volume and trabecular structure were completely inhibited by MU314 or E 2 .",

Assessments of mechanical strength showed that OVX decreased the fracture load of the femoral neck and that MU314 and E 2 suppressed the OVX-induced decline in bone mechanical strength. A similar reduction on fracture load was not detected in the femoral shaft, which did not show a decrease in bone mass. Fracture load is one of the main indices for assessing mechanical strength (23) . Therefore, MU314 may also suppress OVX-induced decrease in the mechanical strength of the bone. E 2 stimulates reproductive tissues and increases the risk of uterine and breast cancers in postmenopausal women (7) . In this experiment, E 2 had a potent hypertrophic effect on the endometrium. In contrast, MU314 did not stimulate OVX-induced uterine atrophy. These results strongly indicate that MU314 has SERM-like characteristics.",

Nakamura et al. demonstrated that E 2 activates ER-\u03b1 in mature osteoclasts and induces their apoptosis by stimulating the Fas/FasL system in a gene-disruption model in which ER-\u03b1 ablation was specifically targeted to the differentiated osteoclasts (24) . Therefore, they concluded that OVX-induced rapid enhancement of osteoclastic bone resorption could be explained by the increase of osteoclast survival because of E 2 deficiency. In contrast, Robinson et al. showed that E 2 exerts osteoprotective effects by inhibiting RANKL-stimulated osteo-clastic differentiation (25) . In a preliminary study using an osteoporosis mouse model, we showed that OVX decreased FasL expression in bone tissue, and E 2 or MU314 suppressed the reduction of FasL expression by OVX (data not shown). We therefore consider that the anti-bone resorption activity of MU314 occurs by decreasing the life span of osteoclasts by a mechanism that would include apoptotic osteoclast death.",
