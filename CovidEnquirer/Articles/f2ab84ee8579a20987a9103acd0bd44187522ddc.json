Although it is possible for humans to obtain pneuma-coccal infections from rodents, S. pneumoniae can be isolated from between 40% and 70% of the adult human population. Because of the high rate of human infection, it is more likely for humans to infect rodents with S. pneumoniae. Hantavirus is an emerging disease, and wild rodents serve as reservoirs for the agent, particularly in the southwestern United States. Human infection can occur from aerosols of urine, feces, or saliva. 89 The infection is totally asymptomatic in the animal, with virus replication occurring within the lung prior to dissemination to the urine and saliva. Because infection can prove fatal for humans, extreme caution should be taken if there is potential for exposure to wild rodent excreta. Other than these agents, the potential for human disease to occur from respiratory agents in rodents is markedly limited.",

Careful observation of the pet and its surroundings should precede the physical examination. An excellent description of the scheduling, history taking, and clinical examination process for small rodents has been provided. 24 Traditional veterinary means of investigating respiratory disease are often impractical in small rodents. Auscultation is challenging because of the small size of the thorax and the lung fields, and it is also complicated by a rapid respiratory rate (mice, 84 to 230 breaths per minute; rats, 66 to 114 breaths per minute) and relatively small tidal volume (mice, 0.09 to 0.38 mL; rats, 0.60 to 1.25 mL). 2 \u2022 49 Thoracic radiographs may be difficult to produce and interpret because of the lack of experience of the practitioner with the species.
