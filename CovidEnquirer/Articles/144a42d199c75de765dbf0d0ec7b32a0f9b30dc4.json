Pigs of all ages were affected and exhibited diarrhea and loss of appetite with different degrees of severity, which were determined to be age dependent; 100% of suckling piglets became ill. Pigs >2 weeks of age experienced mild diarrhea and anorexia, which completely resolved within a few days (5) . Morbidity and mortality rates were lower for vaccinated herds than for nonvaccinated herds, which suggests the emergence of a new PEDV fi eld strain(s) for which the current vaccine, based on the CV777 strain, was partially protective. To identify the PEDV strain(s) responsible for the recent outbreak in China, we sequenced the full-length S gene of isolates obtained from diarrhea samples collected from pigs at 9 affected pig farms.

The fulllength S gene sequences of the 9 isolates from our study showed overall high conservation with the reference strains, up to 94.9%-99.6% homology (Technical Appendix Table 2 ; wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/article/18/8/12-0002-TA2. htm). By phylogenetic analysis, 4 of the fi eld isolates (CH2, CH5, CH6, CH7) clustered with the previously described strain JS-2004-2 from China. Three fi eld isolates (CH1, CH8, CHGD-01) formed a unique cluster with the sequence-confi rmed variant strain CH-FJND-3, which had been isolated from China in 2011 (7) . CH1 and CH8 were isolated from 2 farms, where all sucking piglets had died from diarrhea, even though all of the sows had been Belgium, 1988 AF353511 (13) vaccinated with the PEDV-CV777 strain-based inactivated vaccine. The isolated variant strains, CHGD-01 and CH1, were tested in experimental infection studies and found to cause illness in 100% of sucking piglets (data not shown). The phylogenetic analysis of the S gene nucleotide sequences revealed 3 major clusters (Figure 2 ). Clade 1 comprised 6 strains from our study (CH2, CH3, CH4, CH5, CH6, CH7), the vaccine strain CV777 from China, the attenuated strain DR13 from South Korea, and 2 strains (CHFJND-1, CHFJND-2) that had been isolated in China in 2011. Clade 2 consisted of 4 variant strains (CH1, CH8, CHFJND-3, CHGD-01) that were identifi ed from China in 2011. Clade 3 was composed of 9 isolates from South Korea and 2 strains from Japan (NK and Kawahira). The deduced amino acids of the 4 variant strains in clade 2 had 93% homology to CV777. Furthermore, the 4 variant strains from China (CH1, CH8, CHGD-01, CH-FJND-3) and 9 PEDV isolates from South Korea shared a 5-aa insertion (at positions 56-60 of the S protein) with CV777. One amino acid insertion at position 141 was shared among all variant strains and 6 isolates from South Korea (Technical Appendix Figure 2 ; wwwnc.cdc.gov/EID/ article/18/8/12-0002-FA2.htm). In the S genes, 132 point mutations were found that accounted for genetic diversity among the isolates.",

The sequence insertions and mutations found in the variant strains may have imparted a stronger pathogenicity to the new PEDV variants that infl uenced the effectiveness of the CV777-based vaccine, ultimately causing the 2011 outbreak of severe diarrhea on China's pig farms. Future studies should investigate the biologic role of these particular insertions and mutations. Furthermore, our study of the full-length S gene revealed a more comprehensive distribution profi le that refl ects the current PEDV status in pig farms in China, including the presence of a strain similar to strain DR13, isolated in South Korea.
