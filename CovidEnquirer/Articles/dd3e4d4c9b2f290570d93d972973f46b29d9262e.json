Other causes include urolithiasis, bacterial infections, neoplasia, and nephrocalcinosis. 2 Encephalitozoon cuniculi (ECUN) has been demonstrated to produce mild to severe interstitial nephritis. A recent study of histopathologic examinations of pet rabbits that died or were euthanized showed that of 48 rabbits with ECUN spores detected in the brain, 39 also had interstitial nephritis; 89.6% of renal lesions were described as chronic, whereas the rest were acute. However, the same study showed that the degree of severity of lesions did not always correlate with the degree of clinical symptoms. 3 Antemortem diagnosis of ECUN as a cause of renal failure in rabbits is difficult, but can be supported with serology and protein electrophoresis. 4 Management of acute renal failure is similar to that for other species. 5 Management of chronic renal failure is supportive. Some cases benefit from long-term administration of subcutaneous fluids and hand feeding. The GIF Tube Implant kit is a silicone catheter designed for long-term implantation in the subcutis for administration of fluids (GIF-Tube, PractiVet, Phoenix, AZ). Though designed for dogs and cats, the author and others have used this product in rabbits with chronic renal failure requiring longer-term at-home subcutaneous administration of fluid (see Hospice and end-oflife issues later in this article) (Fig. 1) . The manufacturer provides a demonstration CD of implantation instructions for practitioners and at-home use for owners.",

Several diseases have been reported to cause cardiomyopathy in the laboratory rabbit, but incidence in pet rabbits is unknown, and likely to be low. These include nutritional deficiencies (vitamin E deficiency), viral (coronavirus), bacterial (salmonellosis or pasteurellosis), or protozoal (ECUN) infections, and toxins. 7, 8 Excessive stress may produce heart disease. Stress causes catecholamine release in rabbits, and when sustained can result in coronary vessel constriction with ischemic cardiomyopathy. 7 Treatment of congestive heart failure relies on use of drugs traditionally used in canine medicine, and are based on anecdotal reports of success. 2 Drugs used by the author for management of cardiac disease are listed in Table 1 . Drug dosages should be adapted to clinical response and improvement of echocardiographic results.

Many older rabbits manage to avoid acquired dental disease and possess essentially normal, continually renewing teeth well into old age. Other older rabbits may develop varying patterns of dental disease apparently related to slowing or cessation of tooth growth, which may be due to attrition of the alveolus. Severe acquired dental disease, however, is primarily a disease of younger rabbits; in these patients, evidence of dental disease is often apparent before 3 years of age. 1 Accurate diagnosis and excellent owner compliance can result in adequate disease management and acquisition of normal expected life span; in many cases these patients eventually die of diseases unrelated to those of dentition. The author and others frequently see geriatric rabbits that have had years of regular dental care. In some cases all teeth are eventually lost, and patients survive with good to excellent quality of life on a diet of liquid Critical Care (Oxbow Animal Health, Murdoch, NE).
