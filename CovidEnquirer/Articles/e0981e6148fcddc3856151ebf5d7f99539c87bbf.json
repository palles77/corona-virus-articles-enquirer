The MERS outbreak in South Korea during 2015 was the largest outbreak of the Coronavirus outside the Middle East. The major characteristic of this outbreak is inter-or intra-hospital transmission. This recent MERS outbreak in South Korea is examined and assessed in this paper. The main objectives of the study is to characterize the pattern of the MERS outbreak in South Korea based on a basic reproductive ratio, the probability of ultimate extinction of the disease, and the spatio-temporal proximity of occurrence between patients. The survival function method and stochastic branching process model are adapted to calculate the basic reproductive ratio and the probability of ultimate extinction of the disease. We further investigate the occurrence pattern of the outbreak using a spatio-temporal autocorrelation function.",

However epidemic modeling has been a long standing challenge because of its complexity. The epidemiology of communicable diseases such as hepatitis B, tuberculosis, influenza and HIV involves an interplay between the nature of infectious organisms, evolving and mutating over time, and their transmission dynamics through direct or indirect individual contacts. Therefore, it requires both biological and sociological perspectives when mathematically modeling the outbreak.",

            "text": "Early contributions to infectious disease modeling were pioneered mostly by public health physicians. The first known result in mathematical epidemiology was to appraise the effectiveness of a controversial inoculation against smallpox in 1760 by a mathematician, Daniel Bernoulli (1766) . In 1889, P. D. En'ko contributed to the development of theoretical basis of epidemiology (Dietz, 1988) , correlating a discrete time model with actual cases of a measles epidemic, and Hamer developed a discrete time model to understand the spread of the measles epidemic in 1906 (Hamer, 1906) . Ross assumed that the rate of a new infection was proportional to the numbers of susceptible and infectious individuals, and developed the ordinary differential equation models of vector-borne diseases to first model malaria in 1911 (Ross, 1911) . However, one of the early triumphs in mathematical epidemiology was the formulation of a simple model by Kermack and McKendrick in 1927 (Kermack & McKendrick, 1932; McKendrick, 1926) . Their predictions explained the behavior of countless epidemics, including one of the worst epidemics in history, known as the Great Plague of London, that dicimated more than 15% of London's population in 1665e1666. The Kermack and McKendrick epidemic model is a standard SIR model, consisting of three compartments that are Susceptible (S), Infected (I) and Recovered (R) , and assumes that the sizes of the compartments are large enough so that each compartment is assumed to be homogeneous, or at least there is homogeneous mixing in each subgroup if the population is stratified by activity levels. The compartment model has been often used, modified and applied to different epidemic models (Brauer & Castillo-Chavez, 2011; Hethcote, 2000; Keeling & Rohani, 2008) , as well as other phenomena in social networking, viral marketing, sensor networking, etc. However, at the beginning stage of a disease outbreak, there are a relatively small number of infected individuals, and the transmission of the infection is stochastic rather than homogeneous where the individual contacts between members of the population are distinguishable and traceable. To describe the early stage of an epidemic, stochastic branching process, first formulated by Galton and Watson in 1874, was used to model the reproduction of a population from generation to generation. It was also used to study the extinction of family names by Galton and Watson. Gets et al. (Lloyd-Smith and SchreiberGetz, 2006) introduced a natural generalization of the basic reproductive ratio that was critical in controlling disease outbreak. In the stochastic branching process model, the major interest is placed on finding the probability that the disease eventually dies out, i.e., the probability of ultimate extinction, during the transmission.",

Earlier, spatial patterns were analyzed to describe the geographical spread of plant and human diseases (Campbell & Noe, 1985; Nicot, Rouse, & Yandell, 1984; Snow, 1855) . John Snow (Snow, 1855) greatly contributed to the early medical geography by mapping and analyzing the major cholera outbreak of London in 1854. However, it was later realized that the disease outbreak patterns needed to be explained not only spatially but also temporally. The techniques of spatio-temporal autocorrelation were introduced with an example of population diffusion in North-west England by Bennett (Bennett, 1975a (Bennett, , 1975b and it was well summarized in subsequent literature (Reynolds & Madden, 1988) . Recently, the spatio-temporal analysis and autocorrelation were used to analyze fatal infectious human diseases such as Dengue fever epidemics in Southern Vietnam (Cuong et al., 2013) , and the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in mainland China (Cao et al., 2016) , etc. Cao, in the analysis of the spread of SARS in China (Cao et al., 2016) , used Bayesian Maximum Entropy modeling and observed the empirical covariance based on a fitted theoretical covariance model with behavior of sine fluctuation in space and exponential decay in time.",

South Korea was free of MERS until 2015. The outbreak of MERS in South Korea started in May 2015 and officially ended in December 2015. The index case of the outbreak in South Korea was a 68 year-old male who developed symptoms on May 11, 2015 and sought care at two outpatient clinics and two hospitals according to WHO. As a result, he exposed MERS to a number of medical staff, hospital patients, their family members and visitors, but was not diagnosed with MERS until May 20, 2015, nine days later. The last patient, diagnosed also with lymphoma, spent 172 days in quarantine after being diagnosed with MERS on June 7, 2015 and died on November 25, 2015. The Ministry of Health and Welfare (MoHW) in South Korea declared a formal end to the MERS virus outbreak on December 23, 2015, which was the 218th day since the confirmation of the first patient. The end date was achieved after 28 days without any new infection, or twice the maximum incubation period for the MERS virus. Among 186 infected patients, 39 died of MERS, equating the fatality rate of MERS in South Korea to 20:97%. In this paper, we define a super-spreader as a laboratory-confirmed patient who infected the disease to more than five contacts.",

The fatality rates are 23:64% for male and 15:79% for female, indicating male predominance with p-value \u00bc 0.0885 based on a one-sided test. Gen 2 has the highest rate of fatality, shown on the right in Fig. 3 , with 29:73% for male and 18:00% for female. ",

A minor outbreak ultimately extinguishes itself with the probability of 1 when R 1, while a major outbreak defines itself by the boundless spread of the disease with a positive probability when R > 1. There are more than one possible interpretations for the definition of the basic reproductive rate (R). We adopt the survival function method that is introduced in (Heesterbeek & Dietz, 1996) , known as the gold standard determination of R. In this approach, the reproductive ratio is defined as",

The function b\u00f0t\u00deF\u00f0t\u00de is called the reproduction function. This approach allows us to use a time dependent b\u00f0t\u00de instead of a fixed constant rate b. The stochastic branching process model is often used to describe the beginning stage of a disease outbreak when the number of infected patients remains significantly smaller than the entire population. The network of individual contacts and transmission is more focused in this approach, and a network diagram of patients, consisting of two major objects: vertices and edges, is often used to visualize it. Vertices represent infected patients in our study, and edges are contacts between the members that cause transmission of the disease. We assume that every contact through each edge leads to an infection. The orientation of transmission always flows from a generation to a higher generation but never flows reversely, which means that the previous generation cannot be infected again by any subsequent generation. The degree of a vertex is the number of edges connected to the vertex in the network. For a random node with a vertex degree k, the excess degree of the vertex is defined as the number of contacts infected by the current vertex. Since the current vertex has the k connected neighbor vertices including the source node who infected the disease to the current node, and a patient cannot be infected again from its descendants as we assumed earlier, then the excess degree of the current node is \u00f0k \u00c0 1\u00de. The distribution of vertex degree is essential in the description of disease transmission since it determines how fast or slow the disease spreads or dies out.",

One may expect a strong association between the size (bed counts) of the hospital and the number of MERS cases. However, we found the association to be very weak with a coefficient of determination close to zero for this particular outbreak. This explains the importance of quarantine regardless of hospital size. Our interest lies in the spatio-temporal proximity of occurrence between two patients where one patient infected MERS to the other, i.e. the two connected vertices in Fig. 7 . For this purpose, we use the geographical distance and the difference of the confirmation dates (serial interval) between these paired patients. The distance is measured by the haversine formula between two hospitals in latitude and longitude in Table 1 . While this Euclidean distance may not give the exact travel distance in a metropolis such as Seoul in South Korea, we assume that it is sufficient to characterize the geometrical distances between hospitals or the travel distances of patients. The distributions of the distance and the serial interval between all connected vertices in Fig. 7 are depicted in Fig. 11 . As we observe in the graph on the left in Fig. 11 , there are three major distances, approximately 0 km, 53 km and 81 km, that are well associated with the major distances in Fig. 10 , characterizing inter-hospital or intra-hospital transmission. Most of the patients in Gen 1 are located at Hospital K1 in Fig. 10 , where the index case in Gen 0 was also confirmed, contributing the highest probability at the distance of 0 km in the left graph of Fig. 11 . The major hospitals in Gen 2 are S2, K1-K3 and D1-D2. Considering the three prominent distances in the graph on the left in Fig. 11 , we infer that the disease was transmitted intensely between S2 and K1-K3 (about 53 km apart), and between K1-K3 and D1-D2 (about 81 km apart), rather than transmitted directly between S2 and D1-D2 (about 133 km apart), unless otherwise intra-hospital (0 km apart) transmission in Gen 2. Lastly, the major hospitals in Gen 3 are located mostly within 25 km from each other in Seoul, and the total number of patients in Gen 3 is not as high as those in other generations. The mean serial time interval is 9.8057 days with a 95% confidence interval of (9.1975, 10.414) in the graph on the right in Fig. 11 . Fig. 12 demonstrates the spatio-temporal autocorrelation results of the MERS outbreak in South Korea, based on Equation (6).

The second to the fourth rows in Fig. 12 are the autocorrelations for Gens 1, 2 and 3, respectively. The autocorrelation over the full domain has a few distinct spikes at certain sand t-lags. The peaks in the spatial and temporal lag domain explains that there are a few hospitals mainly involved in the transmission, that characterizes a typical pattern of inter-and intra-hospital transmission. These patterns of the autocorrelation in spatial and temporal directions can be closely associated with Fig. 11 . The transmissions in Gen 1 were mainly intrahospital as there is very little spatial distribution. The index case was confirmed with MERS in Hospital K1 and most of Gen 1 were located at the same hospital, which creates a strong autocorrelation at s \u00bc 0 as depicted in the second row in Fig. 12 . In Fig. 10 , we can infer that most of Gen 2 in Hospital S2 were infected by patients from Hospital K1 in Gen 1 that were located about 53 km apart. This explains the peak in the autocorrelation in Gen 2. The patients in Gen 3 were mostly infected from patients at the same hospital or nearby hospitals. To understand these graphs better, we note that the projections of the autocorrelation in the first row in Fig. 12 onto s-axis and t-axis have similar patterns with the left graph and the right graph in Fig. 11 , respectively.",

Since the estimation of the reproductive ratio is based on sufficient data acquired from the fully-completed or well established epidemic, the prediction of further development of the epidemic is somewhat limited (Mills et al., 2004) . Though there are different approaches for estimating the reproductive ratio (Hefferman, Smith, & Wahl, 2005) , we chose to use the survival function method that is widely applicable as there is no assumption of a constant transmission rate. To calculate the reproductive ratio, the average contact rate b\u00f0t\u00de as a function of t is directly simulated from the data instead of using a constant rate in other works (Chang, 2017; Choi, Jung, Choi, Hur, & Ki, 2018) , and the survival function is also examined from the outbreak data. The resulting reproductive ratio for the MERS outbreak in South Korea is R \u00bc 3:7949, and the MERS outbreak in South Korea is classified as a major outbreak.",

The autocorrelation profiles the entire transmission period, as well as over each generation period, and provides good insight in understanding and characterizing the patterns of inter-hospital or intra-hospital transmission of the MERS outbreak in South Korea. We observed a few distinct peaks of autocorrelation values in the spatial and temporal domain, clearly displaying the characteristics of the MERS outbreak in South Korea.",

(Lipsitch et al., 2003) also argued the tradeoff between reducing the reproductive ratio and stressing the population with excessive quarantine, suggesting that the reproductive ratio may not always be the best measure. As a future endeavor, modeling super-spreading events with nondiffusive terms in mathematical equations will be investigated and a better quarantine plan will be suggested.",
