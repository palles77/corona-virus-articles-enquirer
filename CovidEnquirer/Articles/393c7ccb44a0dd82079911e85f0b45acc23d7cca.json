            "text": "Wild Chinese horseshoe bats have been proven to be natural reservoirs of SARS-like coronaviruses. However, the molecular characterization of key proteins in bats still needs to be explored further. In this study, we used cloning and bioinformatics to analyze the sequence of RIG-I, STAT-1 and IFN-\u03b2 in the immortalized cell lines from Rhinolophus affinis and Rhinolophus sinicus. Then, we treated different bat cells, mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) and splenocytes with polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (polyI:C) and vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) to assess and compare antiviral immune responses between bats and mice. Our results demonstrated that bat RIG-I, STAT-1 and IFN-\u03b2 showed close homology with human, mouse, pig and rhesus monkey. RIG-I and STAT-1 were both highly expressed in bat spleen. Furthermore, IFN-\u03b2 was induced by polyI:C and VSV in both bat and mouse cells. These findings have provided new insight into the potential characteristics of the bat innate immune system against viral infection.",

A series of characteristics have supported bats as a suitable reservoir host for viruses, including their long lifespan, high species diversity, unique immune systems, gregarious roosting behaviors, and high spatial mobility and population densities (Calisher et al., 2006) . Along with these characteristics, the immune system of bats is also believed to be one reason why bats can act as a reservoir host for viruses. However, as the first defense against viral infection, the innate immune system of bats is still poorly understood.",

In order to understand RIG-I mediated antiviral immune response in horseshoe bats, we sequenced and analyzed the functional domains of RIG-I, STAT-1 and IFN-\u03b2 in both R. sinicus and R. affinis which are regarded as natural reservoirs for SARS-like coronavirus.

The bat RIG-I contained two N-terminal CARD domains, a DExD/H-box RNA helicase domain and a C-terminal regulatory domain, which were all typical domains for RIG-I (Fig. 1) . The ATP binding site, the Mg 2+ binding site in the DExD domain and the nucleotide binding region in the helicase domain were necessary for the activation of RIG-I (Fig. 1) . The highly conserved domain organization indicated a similar function with other mammalian species. The deduced protein sequence of bat STAT-1 shared high similarity when aligned with cattle, deer, hamsters, humans, mice, rats, pigs and fruit bats (Fig. 2) . The bat STAT-1 contained a STAT-int domain, a STAT-alpha domain, a STAT-bind domain (DNA binding domain), an SH2 domain and a STAT1-TAZ2 bind domain. The phosphortyrosine binding rocket and the hydrophobic binding rocket in the SH2 domain are important for phosphorylation and nuclear translocation (Fig. 2) . The alignment of the deduced bat IFN-\u03b2 protein sequences with cattle, horses, pigs, humans, mice, rats, dogs and fruit bats showed that bat IFN-\u03b2 contained the transmembrane domain and the IFab domain, which are responsible for the cytokine release and antivirus functions seen in other mammals. The IFNAR binding sites are critical for IFN-\u03b2 receptor recognition and biological activity. The Nglycosylation site is a posttranslational modification site, which plays a role in regulating protein solubility and stability of IFN-\u03b2 (Fig. 3) . Phylogenetic trees of RIG-I, STAT-1 and IFN-\u03b2 were constructed based on the amino acid sequences from R. sinicus, R. affinis and other species. Rhinolophus STAT-1 and IFN-\u03b2 were the most closely related to human genes, and RIG-I was the most closely related to pigs (Fig. 4) .",

Furthermore, we also infected the bat embryonic fibroblast cells with VSV at MOI 1 to check the invading VSV and IFN-\u03b2 induction by qRT-PCR. Interestingly, the VSV mRNA level in BEF cells (more than 9000 folds) was increased much more quickly than in MEF cells (less than 2000 fold) in the first 6 h.

Understanding the virus-associated pattern recognition receptor and signaling pathway may be important for exploring the characteristics of the bat immune system. For this reason, RIG-I like helicase genes have been identified in the black flying fox P. alecto (Cowled et al., 2012) . STAT1 has been shown to be phosphorylatable and to translocate to the nucleus when stimulated with human IFN-\u03b1 (hIFN-\u03b1) in R. aegyptiacus (Fujii et al., 2010) . Type I interferon has been found increased by poly(I:C), exogenous bat type I IFNs and alphavirus in the Rousette bat primary kidney cells (BPKCs) and African fruit bat cells (Omatsu et al., 2008; Biesold et al., 2011) . Cells from P. alecto have been shown to produce IFN-\u03bb after stimulation with the polyI:C transfection and after infection with the bat paramyxovirus, Tioman virus . Conversely, the Tioman virus and paramyxovirus Hendra virus did not activate type I IFN expression and interferon signaling . However, due to a lack of fundamental research, the antiviral immunity of the bat is still poorly understood. Thus, we sequenced and analyzed three genes (RIG-I, STAT-1 and IFN-\u03b2), which are all key genes involved in innate immune responses. Our data suggested that bat RIG-I, STAT-1 and IFN-\u03b2 share a high degree of similarity with other mammalian species.",

Interestingly, RIG-I and STAT-1 were also highly expressed in the lung and intestine, which are both highly sensitive organs to respiratory viruses and enteroviruses.

Only several hundred-fold changes were seen in MEF cells, and similar results were also observed in bat and mouse splenocytes. The massive IFN-\u03b2 production in bat cells can serve to control viruses effectively, and this character of the bat immune system contributes to bats as a natural host of a variety of viruses. Furthermore, when we infected the bat and murine cells with live VSV, the replication of VSV was restrained obviously in bat cells. Whereas, the mRNA level of IFN-\u03b2 in bat cells was induced to a much higher level than mouse cells which could be a main reason for reduced VSV replication in bat cells. It has been shown that bats host more zoonotic virus species than rodents; the total number of zoonotic viruses identified in bats was lower than in rodents, as there is approximately twice the number of rodent species as bat species (Luis et al., 2013) . We can postulate that the highly expressed IFN-\u03b2 in bat cells is beneficial in preventing bats from developing certain virus infections. Despite the fact that unique features of bat's immune responses in anti-viral infection cannot be fully demonstrated, the basic characterization of bat immune genes and signaling remains necessary and will lead to a better understanding of the bat immune system.",
