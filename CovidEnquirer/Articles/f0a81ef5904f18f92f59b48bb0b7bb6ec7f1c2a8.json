In civil society, the police and governmental surveillance systems monitor the behavior, activities, and other changing information of people and are on the alert for abnormal incidents that may cause hazards in communities, nationally and internationally. The information gathered by surveillance is shared with authorities responsible for setting up measures to eliminate the cause of the hazard and protect communities. On the other hand, the human body provides immunological surveillance by setting up systems that monitor for and recognize foreign materials and malignant cells which are presented to the body's immunological mechanisms for destruction.",

Data collected were analyzed and the results distributed to systems and individuals responsible for control actions. Epidemiological surveillance marked the beginning of a new era for the prevention and control of infectious diseases. Surveillance activities have since been expanded from infectious diseases to chronic diseases and injuries. In addition, the systematic and longterm collection of vital statistics and health-related social and economic indicators also contribute to disease surveillance. In this article, we discuss the major disease surveillance systems and public health prevention and control activities.",

            "text": "Around the middle of the twentieth century when infectious diseases were a major problem and menace to public health, two medical experts attempted to introduce surveillance as an essential component of public health practice. Alexander Langmuir, then Chief Epidemiologist at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (then Communicable Disease Center), developed the framework for the systematic surveillance of infectious diseases and the associated control programs. In 1963, Langmuir defined surveillance as (1) systematic and active collection of pertinent data of target disease(s); (2) assessment and practical report of these data; and (3) the timely dispatch of such reports to individuals responsible for formulation of action plans. It is important to note that surveillance would not be useful unless the data collected translates to information that is made known and acted upon by individuals responsible for initiating action plans ('surveillance for action'). In principle, a surveillance system does not include the control measures. A surveillance system is better if it is independent of the control system. Experience has shown that, on some occasions, disease prevalence was artificially modified by individuals who were responsible for control measures and who sought to obtain seemingly better results than what actually occurred. In the 1960s, Karel Raska, the Director of the Division of Communicable Diseases at the World Health Organization (WHO), further expanded the definition of surveillance to include epidemiological research in surveillance activities. To promote research in surveillance, Raska approved special funds for research into strengthening the surveillance system for the newly intensified smallpox eradication program in 1967. Malaria surveillance was similarly enhanced after epidemiological research comparing the prevalence of malaria in individuals using and not using mosquito nets demonstrated the effectiveness of malaria control with mosquito nets.",

The picture cards invented by officials in the Indonesian surveillance program, termed 'smallpox recognition cards,' were effectively deployed in the entire global smallpox eradication program ( Figure 8 ). Villagers could immediately recognize what an individual infected with smallpox looked like and understood the need to report such individuals to the surveillance officer. 2. The distinct clinical manifestation did not require laboratory confirmation, when the disease was known to be endemic ( Figure 9 ). Only when the disease became rare was laboratory confirmation required. This greatly simplified surveillance procedures. 3. In India, despite the implementation of an intensive national vaccination program targeting 100% vaccination coverage of the entire population for more than 5 years, the transmission of smallpox continued ( Figure 10) . The thenprime minister instructed all health center staff (more than 200 health centers were involved) to close the center for 1 week each month and go into the villages to actively search for smallpox cases. Whenever a case was found, immediate ring vaccination of the entire village was instituted. This special campaign, termed 'The Autumn Campaign,' started in September 1973, and the final smallpox case was detected in May 1975. This campaign showed the effectiveness of a focused surveillance and containment strategy. Since then, India and the world have remained smallpox-free.",

Until the measles vaccine was introduced in 1963, practically every child got measles. While there is an effective vaccine, measles vaccination coverage has declined over the years resulting in measles outbreaks in unvaccinated populations. A vaccination coverage rate of 95% in a population is required in order to achieve herd immunity. The 2012-2020 Global Measles and Rubella Strategic Plan focuses on the implementation of five core components for measles and rubella elimination, which include the attainment of high vaccination coverage with two doses of measles-and rubella-containing vaccines and the close monitoring of disease using effective surveillance. The primary objective of measles surveillance is for timely detection of all areas in which the measles virus is circulating, but not necessarily to detect every measles case. This requires the timely notification and investigation of suspected measles cases. Detection of measles-specific IgM antibodies is important for the confirmation of measles infection in suspected cases. A single serum sample collected within 28 days of rash onset of rash can provide presumptive evidence of a current or recent measles virus infection. In previously vaccinated persons, often there is a blunted and/or transient production of IgM and therefore a negative IgM test in vaccinated persons suspected of having measles should not be used to rule out the case. A PCR test may be the best method to confirm such cases.",

Comprehensive cancer registration has been achieved through collation of data obtained from a combination of sources: (1) physician notifications, (2) pathology records, (3) hospital records, and (4) mortality data from the national Registry of Births and Deaths. Since 2009, cancer notification has been made mandatory to ensure completeness of surveillance.",

            "text": "Injuries and violence are major public health problems but have been neglected for many years, despite being predictable and largely preventable. In 2012, the WHO estimates that more than 5 million people die each year as a result of injuries, accounting for 9% of the world's deaths and being nearly 1.7 times the number of fatalities from HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria combined. One-quarter of the deaths from injuries are the result of self-inflicted injuries (suicide and homicide), while road traffic injuries account for another quarter. The other leading causes of death from injuries were falls, drowning, burns, poisoning, and war. The cost of injury-related morbidity and mortality is immense in terms of missed economic opportunity, increased health-care expenditure, lose of productivity, and personal suffering. The highest rates of death and permanent disability due to injury are, however, currently found in poorer countries (Figure 12) . To develop effective injury prevention strategies, these countries would need better information. However, few of them have surveillance systems that generate reliable information on the nature and frequency of injuries. Aiming to collect better information to develop effective preventive strategies, the WHO, in collaboration with the US CDC, has produced manuals on how to set up surveillance systems for collecting, coding, and processing relevant data. In active surveillance, injury cases are actively sought out and investigated. Injured individuals are interviewed and followed up. For example, the active surveillance of child abuse would involve identifying and locating cases through a variety of sources such as police reports, social agencies, and educational authorities. It might also include seeking out the abused children, their parents, and/or the appropriate authorities. Relevant data are collected in the course of routine tasks. For example, doctors are routinely required to fill out death certificates as required by the law, but it is possible to extract data provided in the death certificates to obtain information on deaths from injuries. Forms filled out by doctors and nurses for the purposes of medical insurance claims can also be used for surveillance. Other potential data sources for fatal injuries include autopsy/pathology reports and police reports, and surveillance sources for nonfatal severe injuries include trauma registries and ambulance or emergency medical technician records. In Japan, the statistics on fatal and nonfatal injuries, including accidents and suicides, are available from police reports, the Population Survey Report, and death certificates. Community-based surveys can complement injury and violence surveillance by capturing injury events in the community that did not present to formal healthcare facilities or were so minor that did not require medical attention.",

Novel pathogens such as the MERS-CoV virus can be quickly identified using advanced molecular techniques and real-time reporting and sharing of information made possible via the internet. On the other hand, the rapid expansion in the world population (estimated at 7.3 billion in July 2015) and the increased frequency of travel by air, sea, and land have accelerated the speed of disease transmission. The situation is worsened by income inequality. According to the World Bank's most recent estimates, in 2012, 12.8% of the world's population lived at or below $1.90 a day ( Table 2) . This meant that, in 2012, 902 million people lived on less than $1.90 a day. In sub-Saharan Africa, extreme poverty and the incidence of severe diseases form a vicious cycle and may pose a threat to neighboring geographical regions. The limited resources and inadequate health-care facilities, coupled with political unrest in some regions, render surveillance in sub-Saharan Africa ineffective. The importance of global collaboration to strengthen surveillance in these areas cannot be overemphasized. Figure 13 Global surveillance of communicable diseases: network of networks. With the growing importance of worldwide surveillance on emerging and reemerging diseases, surveillance networks have been developed by WHO and various organizations, research centers, and nongovernmental organizations.",
