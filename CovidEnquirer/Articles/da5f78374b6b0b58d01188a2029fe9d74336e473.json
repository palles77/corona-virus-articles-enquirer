Studies with BALB/c mice have become a useful model for RSV pathogenesis, since FI-RSV-enhanced disease is also observed in vaccinated BALB/c mice. It is likely that the augmented lung disease and the development of pulmonary eosinophilia are attributed to an excessive Th2 type immune response (6) .",

The specific antibody responses were barely detectable in all groups of mice at 14 days after priming (data not shown). Following booster immunization, however, the mean titers of serum antibodies increased significantly only in the group of mice immunized with Bac-RSV/G ( Fig. 2A) . Secretory IgA has been shown to directly mediate local immunity against aerial pathogens, implying an important role for antibody in protection in the upper respiratory tract (22) . Thus, for an effective RSV vaccine development, the induction of secretory IgA on respiratory mucosal surface is critical. To examine whether Bac-RSV/G vaccination elicits IgA response in the respiratory tract, bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) was performed at day 5 after RSV challenge and levels of IgA were determined by RSV-specific ELISA. Each group of mice immunized with Bac-control or PBS did not exhibit any specific IgA response, whereas Bac-RSV/G-immune mice showed significantly enhanced level of specific IgA response (Fig. 2B) . These results suggest that intranasal immunization of Bac-RSV/G effectively induce both RSV G-specific serum IgG and respiratory IgA.",

Many RSV vaccine candidates specifying target antigens employed two envelop proteins, G attachment protein and F fusion protein, because these antigens are known to induce protective immunity against live RSV infection. However, in the BALB/c mouse model, immunization of G protein expressed from recombinant vaccinia virus elicited Th2-biased responses, which was responsible for the vaccine-enhanced diseases (27) . Thus, G protein has been falsely regarded as a bad target antigen for a long time, although it could induce strong neutralizing antibody responses upon immunization. Recently, it has been suggested that G protein itself is not the cause of vaccine-enhanced diseases and the proper balance between RSV-specific Th1 and Th2 responses is rather an important factor controlling both safety and efficacy of G-targeted RSV vaccine. Using appropriate platforms and/or adjuvants, this balance could be achieved with G-targeted vaccines. For example, we have recently demonstrated that mucosal immunization of recombinant adenovirus vac-cine expressing the core domain of G successfully induced protective immunity without vaccine-induced diseases (9) .",

First, baculovirus, which has been used to overexpress recombinant proteins in insect cells, is neither replication-competent nor pathogenic in mammalian cells, making it safer vaccine vector than other mammalian viral vectors. In addition, baculovirus-based vaccines produced in insect cells are not contaminated by LPS. Second, baculovirus-based vaccine possesses several advantages upon production, such as easy manipulation, relatively simple scale-up, and high titers (11, 31) . Thirdly, there is no pre-existing vector immunity against baculovirus in mammals, which enables baculovirus to escape vector neutralization by pre-existing immunity during in vivo delivery (19) . Lastly, baculovirus has the ability to stimulate strong innate immunity, exhibiting strong adjuvanticity itself. It has been previously shown that inoculation of wild-type baculovirus alone can stimulate the secretion of inflammatory cytokines from innate immune cells and confer protection from lethal virus infection in mice (16) . Consistent with this report, intranasal inoculation of control baculovirus also provided partial protection against live RSV challenge in our study (Fig. 6) . The baculovirus-mediated stimulation of innate immunity might be associated with the induction of type I interferons, mediated by both TLR9-dependent (32) and TLR9-independent pathways (33) . Thus, it becomes evident that baculovirus can act as a natural adjuvant by stimulating innate immunity and be used as a safe and effective vaccine carrier.",

Although the role of Th1 or CTL responses to RSV clearance is well delineated (34) , the role of Th17-mediated responses have not been fully elucidated in host defense against RSV. Th17 cells, which are characterized by massive production of IL-17, are thought to contribute to autoimmune diseases but also play a crucial role in host defense against extracellular bacteria (35, 36) . In addition, Th17-associated effector molecules seem to be necessary and sufficient for protection against several viral pathogens. For example, recent studies have reported that Tc17 cells are potently cytolytic against vaccinia virus-infected cells (37, 38) . In these studies, both IL-17-producing CD4\uff0b and CD8\uff0b T cells are necessary to confer pro-tection against viral infections, exhibiting cytotoxic activity for clearance of vaccinia virus-infected cells. Mice immunized with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the G protein of RSV (vvG) exhibit pulmonary eosinophilia induced by Th2 type cytokines after challenge RSV infection (6) . Th2 type cytokines are thought to promote eosinophil infiltration to the lungs of RSV-infected mice and may contribute to immunopathology associated with vaccine-enhanced diseases. Interestingly, we showed that the levels of Th2-type cytokines, such as IL-4, IL-5, IL-10, or IL-13, were very low in the lungs of Bac-RSV/G-immune mice following RSV challenge, not significantly different to those in the PBS control group. Several evidences suggest that IL-17 negatively regulates Th2 cytokine production (39, 40) . Thus, the induction of Th1/Th17 responses by Bac-RSV/G vaccination may have attenuated the development of Th2 responses. Furthermore, IL-17 may play certain roles in immune defense in the lungs, including augmentation of mucosal immunity by delivery of IgA and IgM into the airway lumen (41) . Though the exact mechanism by which the Th17 responses are induced by Bac-RSV/G vaccination is not clear, the G-specific Th17 response may be associated with clearance of RSV from the lungs. Further studies will be needed to elucidate the exact role of Th17 immunity in RSV infection.",
