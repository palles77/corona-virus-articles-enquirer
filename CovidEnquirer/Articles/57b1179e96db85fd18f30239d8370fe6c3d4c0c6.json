Thus, the development of novel anti-BVDV strategies are urgently needed. The nonstructural protein 5 (NS5B) of BVDV is essential for viral replication. Further, the camel single-domain antibody (nanobody) represents a promising antiviral approach with the advantages of small size, stable structure, high specificity and solubility, and the recognition of specific epitopes. However, no NS5B-specific nanobodies against BVDV have been reported. In this study, NS5B-specific nanobodies were isolated from a phage display library of variable domains of Camellidae heavy chain-only antibodies (VHHs). Further, an MDBK cell line stably expressing Nb1 was established to explore antiviral activity. Results showed that Nb1 could markedly suppress BVDV replication and interact with the BVDV NS5B protein. This suggests that nanobodies have potential for the development of novel antiviral drugs against BVDV infection.",

The RNA genome of BVDV is approximately 12.5 kb, consisting of a single large open reading frame with a UTR on both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends and encodes a polymerized protein that is then processed by host and viral proteases into the capsid protein, three envelope glycoproteins (E rns , E 1 , E 2 ) and seven or eight non-structural proteins (NSPs) comprising N pro , P7, NS2/3, NS4A, NS4B, NS5A, and NS5B (Collett et al., 1991; Tautz et al., 1997) . The first four proteins are structural, whereas the rest are nonstructural and function in viral assembly, replication, and host immune evasion. NS5B, which is located at the carboxyl terminus of the polyprotein, is highly conserved among pestiviruses, and has been confirmed to possess RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity, and is responsible for transcription and replication of the viral genome (Zhong et al., 1998) . Due to these unique characteristics, NS5B is an ideal target for the development of antiviral drugs against BVDV.",

Nanobodies have desirable properties such as small volume (15 kDa), good antigen binding performance, strong tissue penetration and high stability (Zou et al., 2015) ; these attractive features make them beneficial for immunoassays and therapeutic applications. In addition, for the majority of nanobodies, their intrinsic stability is sufficient for proper folding and intracellular function (Rothbauer et al., 2006) . For example, ALX-0171, a trivalent nanobody that binds fusion proteins on the surface of RSV, thereby inhibiting viral replication, is a novel, inhaled biotherapeutic; it is in development for the treatment of RSV infections in infants and is currently in a clinical phase III trial (Detalle et al., 2016; Larios Mora et al., 2018) . In addition to some nanobodies as drugs for clinical applications, some studies have referred to the antiviral effects of specific nanobodies in vitro. nanobody Nb25 was found to effectively block duck HAV replication by targeting a conserved B cell epitope of this virus (Xue et al., 2019) . Another nanobody NbMS10, which targets the MERS-CoV receptorbinding region significantly abrogates virus replication via its neutralization activity (Zhao et al., 2018) . Further, Intracellularly-expressed Nb6 was found to potently suppress porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome replication (Liu et al., 2015) . Nevertheless, there have been no reports on the use of nanobodies for antiviral therapy against BVDV to date.",

However, despite their huge potential for development, monoclonal antibodies still have apparent limitations, such as complex structure, large molecular weights, high development and production costs, which limit their applications in related fields. With the development of genetic engineering technology, the emerging nanobody has greatly improved antibody performance, with its unique advantages such as small size (15 kDa), high specificity and affinity, and recognition of specific antigenic epitopes (Dmitriev et al., 2016; Hassanzadeh-Ghassabeh et al., 2013) . In addition, according to a previous report, nanobodies are more soluble due to typical hydrophilic amino acid substitutions (Vu et al., 1997) ; thus, we speculate that the substitution of hydrophilic amino acid to hydrophobic amino acid in this study might further increase the hydrophilicity of NS5B-specific nanobodies (Fig. 2) .",

Whether intracellularly-expressed nanobodies exert an antiviral effect during BVDV infection and whether they can be used for BVD treatment were not clear. Thus, it is necessary to determine the effect of intracellularly-expressed nanobodies on BVDV infection. To investigate such effects, MDBK cell lines were constructed to stably express intracellular Nbs against NS5B. NS5B has been shown to possess RdRp activity and plays a pivotal role in the transcription and replication of the BVDV genome (Choi et al., 2004) . Therefore, NS5Bspecific nanobodies were screened using phage display in this study to explore their anti-BVDV effect. Here, to facilitate this study, stable cell lines were generated by first packaging the lentivirus and then transducing it into MDBK cells, which not only avoided problems associated with individual transfections but also resulted in stable and efficient expression of Nbs fusion proteins. Further, to clarify that nanobodies were successfully delivered to the cells, a C-terminal EGFP was fused to the Nbs via an IgA-hinge linker to act as a marker and facilitate Co-IP detection (Figs. 4 and 6 ). It has been reported that fluorescent proteinnanobody fusion proteins of the HIV-1 capsid protein can recognize and dynamically trace HIV-1 morphogenesis in living cells, and this novel fluorescent biosensor provides a robust tool for cell-based HIV research (Helma et al., 2012) . This suggests that the NS5B-specific nanobodies identified here might also have the potential to act as a tool for the direct and dynamic visualization of NS5B in BVDV-infected living cells.",

Unexpectedly, even though all three Nbs showed similar in vitro affinities for NS5B, the degree of inhibition of viral replication was completely different. Nb100 had no antiviral activity and Nb45 showed weaker antiviral activity, whereas Nb1 exhibited a strong antiviral effect (Fig. S1 ). We speculate that this is because different Nbs might bind different NS5B epitopes, and that Nb1, but not Nb100, could bind the key epitope of NS5B, inhibiting its RdRp activity and thus exerting strong antiviral effects. The NS5B protein is mainly distribute in the cytoplasm of BVDV-infected cells, and the replication and transcription of viral genes also primarily occurs in the cytoplasm, implying that Nbs might exert antiviral activity mainly by targeting NS5B protein in the cytoplasm. Surprisingly, our IFA and Western blotting results both clearly indicated that the Nbs were mainly distributed in the nucleus, and only a small portion were identified in the cytoplasm (Fig. S2) . In view of these inconsistent results inconsistency in the subcellular localization of NS5B protein and Nbs, the anti-viral molecular mechanism of Nbs needs to be further researched, and we are currently working on this.",

The BVDV-NS5B protein, which is highly conserved in the genus Pestivirus and has its own unique function as a non-structural proteins, plays an important role in viral replication, as it has RdRp activity (Choi et al., 2004) . This provides an ideal target for the development of anti-BVDV drugs. Due to advantages that are unmatched by traditional antibodies, Nbs have broad value for clinical application (Pardon et al., 2014; Siontorou, 2013) . However, The biggest problem associated with intracellular antibodies is the delivery of related expression genes into cells, while several possible strategies have been developed to overcome this problem, such as nanobody gene delivery into cells via an intrabody gene therapy delivery strategy (Southwell et al., 2009 ) and a trans-activating transduction (TAT) peptide Nb6 fusion to promote protein entry into cells . These reports provide a useful reference for research on and the application of intracellular nanobodies against BVDV, and this represents the ongoing work in our laboratory.",
