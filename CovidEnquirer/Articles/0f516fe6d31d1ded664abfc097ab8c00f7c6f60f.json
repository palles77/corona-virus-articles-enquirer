The list of host genes which affect susceptibility to neurotropic viruses is extensive, and the following examples are meant to illustrate several mechanisms by which these genes appear to act rather than to serve as an exhaustive catalogue (see Brinton and Nathanson (1981) ; Brinton, Blank and Nathanson (1984) ; Rosenstreich, Weinblatt and O'Brien (1982) for review). In the case of some neurotropic viral diseases, such as that caused by lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCM), and the chronic paralysis and demyelinating disease induced by Theiler's virus, immune-mediated tissue injury is a cardinal feature of the infection. In both these cases, differences in susceptibility to clinically apparent disease have been mapped to genes within the major histocompatibility complex (H2 in the mouse) (Buchmeier et al, 1980; Clatch et al, 1985) . A discussion of the genetic factors that influence this type of immune-mediated tissue injury is beyond the scope of this chapter, and interested readers are referred elsewhere for more information (Notkins and Oldstone, 1985; 1986) .",

            "text": "There are several examples where differential susceptibility to infection with viruses in different strains of inbred mice correlates with variations in the magnitude or nature of the immune response to the inciting virus. Interestingly, the host genes involved are often not linked to immune response (Ir) genes within the mouse major histocompatibility complex (H2). For example, A/WySnJ mice are extremely susceptible to intraperitoneal inoculations of street rabies virus, whereas SJL/J and CBA/J strain mice are relatively resistant. These differences correlate with the magnitude of the antirabies virus antibody titre, with the resistant mice having higher titres then the susceptible ones. High serum antibody titres, in turn, seem to result in decreased viral replication in the CNS (Lodmell and Ewalt, 1985) . The magnitude of the serum neutralizing antibody response in inbred mice immunized with a vaccine strain of rabies virus also seems to be genetically determined. For example, C3H/J mice are 'high responders' and C57BL/6 mice are low responders' in terms of serum antibody levels following vaccination. Studies of the Fl hybrid cross between these two strains indicates that the 'high response' is dominant, and that it is not linked to H2 genes (Templeton et al., 1986) .",

Although influenza is not, strictly speaking, usually considered a neurotropic virus, the general principles involved may turn out to have broader applicability to paramyxoviruses in general and possibly other unrelated viral groups. A2G mice have a dominant allele ('\u039c\u03c7+') located on chromosome 16 which confers resistance to influenza virus infection. This effect appears to be mediated via oc and \u03b2 (not \u03b3) interferon. Following infection with influenza virus, but not other unrelated viruses, Mx+ mice produce an interferon-induced 75 kD protein that appears to be essential for the specific anti-influenza viral resistant state. This protein alone, even in the absence of other interferon-induced proteins, is sufficient to mediate the antiviral state in these mice, although its mechanism of action remains obscure (Staehli et al., 1986 ).",

Mice lacking or carrying an altered form of the receptor gene would presumably be resistant to receptor-mediated infection by the homologous virus. This mechanism may very well explain differences in the susceptibility of some strains of mice to infection with mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus. BALB/c mice are susceptible to MHV infection, whereas SJL/J mice are resistant. The resistant locus ('Mhv-\u0393) has been mapped to chromosome 7 (Knobler et al., 1984) . Recent studies have indicated that the resistant BALB/c mice lack receptor for MHV on intestinal epithelial cells and hepatocytes (Boyle, Weismiller and Holmes, 1987) . It appears that the Mhv-1 locus actually encodes the gene for the MHV receptor (J. Boyle, personal communica tion).",

            "text": "A novel mechanism of receptor-related genetically controlled resistance to viral infection is exemplified by resistance of some mouse strains to infection with ecotropic murine retroviruses. Some of these viruses can produce paralytic disease in mice associated with spongiform neuropathological changes in the CNS. Retroviruses are RNA viruses which transcribe their genomic RNA into DNA with the aid of the enzyme RNA-dependent DNA polymerase ('reverse transcriptase'). The viral DNA can then become integrated into the genomic DNA of the host target cells. At this stage in its life cycle the retrovirus is often referred to as a 'provirus'. In some cases the integrated proviral DNA does not contain a full complement of all the retroviral genes required for encoding all the viral proteins ('defective provirus'). A defective provirus is unable to activate from its integrated state to produce infectious virion particles. Mice carrying the Fv-4 allele in their genome inherit a defective endogenous ecotropic retrovirus. The envelope (env) gene of the provirus, which is the viral cell attachment protein, is transcribed in host cells and viral envelope protein is produced. This envelope protein then binds to the receptor on the host cell surface used by ecotropic retroviruses, and prevents infection (due to receptor blockade) by exogenous ecotropic retroviruses (Yuen et al, 1986) .",

            "text": "Host genes are also related to susceptibility of mice to infection with the still unidentified agent responsible for scrapie. Dr Stanley Prusiner and his colleagues have suggested that scrapie is caused by an infectious protein ('prion') devoid of detectable nucleic acid. The major component of scrapie prions is a 27-30 kD protein designated PrP 27-30. This protein is encoded by a cellular gene, located on mouse chromosome 2, that is found in both scrapie-infected and uninfected animals. mRNA transcribed from this gene is also found in both healthy and infected animals, although the ultimate protein product appears to differ in terms of several biological properties in the two instances. One of the genes that influences susceptibility to scrapie infection in the mouse (Trn-\u0393) is closely linked to the gene encoding PrP 27-30 (Carlson et al. } 1986) . It remains to be established whether other genes known to influence scrapie susceptibility or incubation time (for example, the scrapie incubation or Sine gene) are identical to Prn-1, allelic, or unrelated but also linked to the PrP 27-30 gene (see Hope and Kimberlin, 1987, for review) .",

            "text": "Host genes also appear to play a role in determining susceptibility to latent as well as acute viral infections. Following inoculation of herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) into the lip of an adult mouse, virus replicates locally and then spreads retrogradely through the peripheral branches of the trigeminal nerve to reach the trigeminal ganglion. During the acute phase of viral infection (which lasts for about 2 weeks) HSV-1 can be isolated from tissue homogenates of the trigeminal ganglion. Following this time period virus is no longer detectable in trigeminal tissue homogenates. However, virus can be recovered if the trigeminal ganglion is explanted, minced into small pieces, and co-cultivated with an indicator cell line (for example, CV-1 cells). When a large number of inbred strains of mice are tested for their susceptibility to latent HSV-1 infection, some strains (for example, C57BL, BALB/cByJ) are resistant to the development of latent infections whereas others are extremely susceptible (for example, PL/J, LP/J, CBA/J). Resistance appears to be a dominant trait, which is not linked to H2 genes (Kastrukoff, Lau and Puterman, 1986) . Interestingly, resistance to development of latent HSV-1 infection, and resistance to acute infection with HSV-1, do not always cosegregate in inbred strains of mice (Lopez, 1975; Kastrukoff, Lau and Puterman, 1986) . At least two independently segregating, non-H2-linked, genes govern resistance to acute HSV-1 infection in the mouse (Lopez, 1980) . The mechanism(s) responsible for the resistance of mice to either acute or latent infections with HSV remain unknown. Interferon may play a role in some types of resistance. Evidence supporting this view comes from studies in which administration of anti-interferon (\u03b1/\u03b2) antibodies converted resistant strains of mice to susceptibility to HSV-1 infection (Gresser et al., 1976) . The specific pathway and cellular targets through which endogenous interferon acts to induce HSV-1 resistance are not known. Macrophages would appear to be a likely candidate cell, as macrophages from resistant mouse strains do not appear to support HSV-1 replication to nearly the same degree as cells from susceptible strains. Anti-interferon (\u03b1/\u03b2) antibody treatment of the macrophages from resistant mice renders them susceptible to HSV-1 infection. Support for the idea that it is the macrophages that are the target cell for endogenous interferon action comes from studies with C3H/HeJ mice. These mice carry an autosomal gene defect (Lps d ) on chromosome 4 that makes them resistant to the effects of endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide). Resistance to endotoxin appears to be due to abnormalities in macrophage function. It has been suggested that one abnormality in macrophage function in these mice is the deficient production of endogenous interferon, and that this accounts for the heightened susceptibility of these mice to infection by a wide variety of pathogens including viruses (Vogel and Fertsch, 1987) . So in this case, susceptibility to viral infection appears to be linked to a gene that regulates specific aspects of macrophage function, a similar mechanism could theoretically occur to account for some cases of HSV-1 susceptibility as well. It is important to recognize, however that other arms of the immune response including T-lymphocytes, macrophages, and natural-killer cells have all been shown to play a role in resistance to HSV infections {see Rosenstreich, Weinblatt and O'Brien, 1982 for review) .",

Viruses which are capable of spreading via nerves include rabies, herpes simplex, herpes simiae, polioviruses and reovirus type 3. Since nerves provide specific pathways of connectivity between sites in the periphery and discrete, defined regions of the CNS, it is not surprising that for virtually all neurally spreading viruses that the ultimate distribution within the CNS can be profoundly influenced by their initial site of entry into the host {see, for example, Sabin and Olitsky, 1937, 1938; Howe and Bodian, 1942; and, more recently, Martin and Dolivo, 1983; Anderson and Field, 1983) . The effect of site of entry on CNS tropism has been less clearly defined for blood-borne viruses. Since the pathway of spread of a virus may affect its CNS tropism, it is appropriate to review briefly the current state of our understanding of the role played by viral genes in determining specific patterns of viral spread within an infected host.",

Although reoviruses are not important human pathogens, they have proved to be valuable experimental models for identifying the role of individual viral genes and the proteins they encode at specific stages in viral pathogenesis {see Sharpe and Fields, 1983, 1985 , for review). Reoviruses have a genome consisting of ten discrete segments of double-stranded RNA ('genes'), each segment encoding a unique mRNA, that is translated into at least one protein product. If susceptible cells are simultaneously coinfected with reoviruses of two different serotypes, intertypic reassortants (in other words, viruses containing gene segments derived from each of the two parental serotypes) can be generated. By comparing the behaviour of these reassortant viruses to that of the two parental viruses, the role of specific viral genes and proteins in determining specific biological properties of the virus can often be determined. This approach has been used to identify the importance of the SI viral gene in determining the capacity of reoviruses to utilize either neural or haematogenous routes to spread to the CNS in infected animals (Tyler, McPhee and Fields, 1986) .",

For example, by studying the spread of herpes virus from the cornea to the CNS in mice, Oakes, Gray and Lausch (1986) established that HSV-1 DNA sequences that lie between 0.31 and 0.44 map units (mu) are important in determining the capacity of the virus to spread to the CNS. When HSV-1 (strain 17) is inoculated onto the cornea of mice, it replicates in corneal epithelial cells and then spreads rapidly to the trigeminal ganglia and brain. By contrast, although HSV-2 (strain 186) replicates in the cornea, it reaches the trigeminal ganglia only in small quantities and is not detectable in the brain following corneal inoculation. Both strains of virus are equally lethal after direct intracerebral inoculation into mice. In order to determine which HSV-1 genes were responsible for these differences, an intertypic recombinant virus was generated which contained a complete HSV-2 genome except for the portion between 0.31 and 0.44 mu which was derived from HSV-1. This recombinant virus spread to the CNS in a fashion indistinguishable from HSV-1 indicating that the transferred HSV-1 DNA sequences are important in directing the capacity of herpes virus to spread to the CNS. The region in question contains genes coding for a large number of viral proteins including the nucleocapsid protein p40, glycoprotein gB, the DNA-binding protein ICP8, the viral DNA polymerase, and an origin of DNA replication. It is unclear which of these proteins play the critical role in viral spread.",

A virally encoded glycoprotein ('G') is inserted into this envelope. The G glycoprotein appears to function as the viral cell attachment protein and specific regions of this protein have been identified that appear to be major determinants of viral virulence in vivo. N-MAbs directed against the G glycoprotein have been used to generate rabies virus variants with alterations in the amino acid sequence of the G glycoprotein. Comparison of the amino acid sequences of the glycoprotein of avirulent or attenuated variants with that of fully pathogenic variants and the wild-type virus has indicated that an arginine residue at amino acid position 333 is an important marker of viral virulence (Dietzschold et al., 1983; Seif et al., 1985) . Variants with any one of a number of amino acid substitutions at this position (for example, glutamine, glycine, isoleucine) are avirulent or have attenuated virulence, whereas variants which preserve ARG 333 (but have substitutions at nearby positions such as 330, 336, 338) remain virulent. The mechanism(s) by which changes in the rabies glycoprotein at position 333 result in altered neurovirulence are being actively investigated. Studies of several of the avirulent variants indicate that they compete for the same cellular receptor as the wild-type virus on cultured cells, and that they do not have altered CNS tropism in vivo. The variants appear to spread less quickly within the CNS than the wild-type virus and appear to be restricted in their capacity to spread via certain specific neural pathways, when compared to the wild-type virus (Dietzschold et al., 1985; Kucera et al, 1985) .

Reoviruses are non-enveloped viruses whose genetic information is contained in the form of ten discrete segments of double-stranded (ds) RNA. As discussed earlier, it is possible to generate reassortment viruses containing combinations of genes derived from different serotypes of virus, or even from different strains of the same serotype. After intracerebral inoculation into neonatal mice reovirus serotype 1 infects the ependymal cells lining the ventricles, but does not infect neurons. Conversely, reovirus serotype 3 infects neurons and produces acute lethal encephalitis, but does not infect ependymal cells. Using reassortants derived from types 1 and 3 it was shown that the viral SI dsRNA segment, which encodes the outer capsid protein \u03c3 \u0390 , was the major determinant of neuronal or ependymal tropism of reoviruses (Weiner, Powers and Fields, 1980) . Subsequent studies have extended this observation by documenting the importance of the same viral gene for reovirus tropism within the pituitary (Onodera et al., 1981) , and the retina .",

Comparison of the predicted amino acid sequence of the \u03c3 1 protein of five of the variant viruses with that of their wild-type parent revealed that in each case a single amino acid substitution was present at one of two locations (amino acid 340 or 419) . The T3 \u03c3 1 variants have attenuated neurovirulence and altered CNS tropism compared to the wild-type virus. For example, although the variants still infect and injure the hippocampus, septal nuclei, and mamillary bodies, they no longer injure the cortex (Spriggs, Bronson and Fields, 1983; Bassel-Duby et al, 1986) . A reassortant virus containing only the SI dsRNA segment derived from a variant virus shows the same pattern of restricted neurotropism and attenuated neurovirulence as the original variants, indicating that the single amino acid substitution found in the \u03c3 1 protein is indeed responsible for the altered phenotype of these viruses (Kaye et al, 1986) .",

The coronaviruses are enveloped RNA viruses which have two proteins (El, E2) inserted into their envelope. Variants of MHV have been selected with N-MAbs directed against the E2 glycoprotein (Fleming et al, 1986; Dalziel et al, 1986) . Many of the E2 variants have attenuated neurovirulence and an altered pattern of neuropathogenicity compared to their wild-type parents. The wild-type viruses typically produce a severe acute encephalitis, although some of the survivors go on to develop a chronic demyelinating disease. Many of the E2 variant viruses produce a high incidence of demyelinating disease with little or no evidence of preceding encephalitis. Passive immunization of mice with certain anti-E2 MAbs can also convert the pattern of illness from encephalitis to demyelinating disease (Buchmeier et al., 1984) . These findings strongly suggest that the E2 glycoprotein of coronaviruses is a major determinant of viral pathogenicity, and that it may be involved in the tropism of these virus for neurons as variation in this protein can result in diminished neuronotropism and enhanced tropism for oligodendroglia.",

            "text": "Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) is an enveloped virus whose genetic information is contained in two segments of RNA. Some strains of mice infected with specific strains of LCMV develop a runting syndrome. Mice with this syndrome have high titres of LCMV in the growth hormone producing cells of the anterior pituitary. Infection of these cells results in markedly reduced levels of circulating growth hormone and this in turn accounts for the runting syndrome (Oldstone etal., 1985) . Reassortant viruses have been generated between strains of LCMV that produce runting syndrome in susceptible mice (such as Armstrong) and strains of LCMV that do not (such as WE). It appears that the LCMV small (S) RNA segment, which encodes the two viral envelope glycoproteins, determines the capacity of these viruses to infect growth-hormone producing pituitary cells and produce runting syndrome (Riviere et ai, 1985) . LCMV thus provides another example of the importance of viral surface proteins in determining specific patterns of neurotropism. Interestingly, the infected growth-hormone producing cells typically do not show obvious evidence of injury at either the light or electron-microscopic level. This exemplifies a point frequently stressed by Dr Oldstone and his colleagues that the so-called iuxury functions' of cells such as neurons can be dramatically affected by viral infection, in the absence of either alterations in more basic 'housekeeping' functions or detectable morphological changes.",

Variants of a neuroadapted strain of mumps virus (Kilham) have been selected by their resistance to N-MAbs directed against the haemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) glycoprotein of the viral envelope. Suckling hamsters inoculated intracerebrally with mumps virus develop lethargy, muscular wasting and incoordination followed later by hydrocephalus. The mumps virus infects the ependymal cells lining the ventricles and the aqueduct of Sylvius. Hydrocephalus develops as a result of the obstruction to CSF flow that follows aqueduct stenosis. The virus also infects neurons and glial cells throughout the cerebrum and brainstem producing a severe meningoencephalitis. By contrast, one of the mumps HN variants (M13) does not produce the early illness described above, but still causes the later developing hydrocephalus. Examination of the brains of M13 infected hamsters shows evidence of ependymal cell infection identical to that seen with wild-type virus, but only minimal signs of neuronal injury (Love et ai, 1985) . When the structure of individual polypeptides from strains of mumps virus that differ in their neuropathogenicity are compared, the HN protein appears to show the greatest degree of variation, although no one particular HN glycoprotein peptide map correlates exactly with viral virulence (Wolinsky and Server, 1985) . These results support the hypothesis that the mumps virus HN protein plays an important role in determining viral neurotropism and virally induced neuronal injury.",

Competition binding experiments using a large number of anti-CD4 MAbs suggest that the viral binding site is relatively large as MAbs binding to at least four distinct (non-competing) epitopes can interfere with viral infection (Sattentau et al., 1986) .",

            "text": "The human papovavirus, JCV, is one of the agents responsible for the disease progressive multifocal leukoencephalopathy (PML). In this disease virus infects and kills oligodendroglia, resulting in extensive demyelination throughout the CNS. JCV infection also results in dramatic and often bizarre alterations in astrocyte morphology, although infection of these cells appears to be nonpermissive (that is, does not result in the production of infectious virus). Neurons are not infected by JCV. Recent studies have suggested that an 'enhancer' region present in the JCV genome may be the major determinant of this pattern of viral tropism within the CNS. Enhancers are short nucleotide sequences, often multiply repeated in tandem, that act to stimulate the transcription of associated genes {see Brady, Feigenbaum and Khoury, 1986 , for review). In order to study the tissue specificity of the JCV enhancer region, this portion of the JCV genome was attached to an indicator gene, chloramphenicol acetyltransferase (CAT), and this complex was transfected into a variety of cell lines (Kenney et al, 1984) . The experimental design was based on the assumption that if the JCV enhancer was active in a particular cell line then transcription of the CAT gene would occur, and following translation of the resulting mRNA into protein, an increase in CAT enzymatic activity would be detectable. Using this assay system it was shown that the JCV enhancer is specifically active in human fetal glial cells and relatively inactive in CV-1 and HeLa cells, an in vitro analogue to the previously discussed in vivo tropism of this virus. By contrast, the enhancer region of another papovavirus, SV40, is 'promiscuous', that is, active in a wide variety of cell lines. These experiments indicate that enhancers can potentially, but do not invariably, serve as determinants of cell tropism.",

Mice which develop from these eggs contain both native and foreign DNA and have been referred to as 'transgenic' mice {see Messing, Chapter 9 of this volume). Transgenic mice containing the 'early region' of the SV40 genome frequently develop choroid plexus epithelial cell tumours (Brinster et al., 1984) . The early region of the SV40 genome contains an enhancer region as well as regions encoding a protein implicated in transformation and oncogenesis (T-antigen). If the enhancer region is omitted from the microinjected foreign DNA constructs, the frequency of choroid plexus tumours drops significantly. These results have led to the suggestion that the SV40 enhancer may determine the targeting of the T-antigen to choroid plexus epithelial cells, and that the expression of T-antigen in these cells leads to tumour formation (Palmiter et al., 1985) .",

Offspring of these mice inherit JCV genomic sequences, and develop a syndrome characterized pathologically by dysmyelination within the CNS, and clinically by tremor, incoordination and seizures. The development of CNS dysmyelination correlates with the inheritance of JCV DNA sequences and the expression of high levels of JCV mRNA within the brain. It has been postulated that the JCV enhancer sequences are responsible for targeting the associated T-antigen sequences to oligodendroglia, where their expression results in cellular dysfunction leading to disordered myelination.",

Despite accumulating evidence of the mechan ism^) by which these genes and their products act {see Chen, 1986 , for review), there is no evidence to date that they function in either a cell, tissue, or species-specific fashion.

We have also reviewed investigations concerning the role played by individual viral genes and the proteins they encode in determining specific pathways of viral spread to the CNS in the infected host. Several examples illustrating the current state of knowledge concerning the nature of viral cell attachment proteins and host cell receptors for neurotropic viruses have been reviewed. Finally, we have seen examples of how specific viral genetic elements, such as enhancers, can act to determine the cell-specificity of certain neurotropic viruses.",
