Five respiratory pathogenic viruses and Mycoplasma pneumoniae were used as inducers. Cells from every child responded to at least three out of the six inducers by interferon production. As a group, cultures prepared from patient cells showed decreased production of IFN when stimulated with adeno, rhino, corona or RS viruses or with the mycoplasma. Similar trend between the two groups of children was seen as regards influenza A virus-induced IFN production in leukocyte cultures. These results corroborate our previous findings that relative deficiency in interferon production appears to be inducer-specific, and suggest that this phenomenon may have a role in the pathogenesis of recurrent respiratory infections.",

            "text": "Proneness to infection in children is a clinically important problem. Major defects in immune responses, that may bring about a cycle of recurring infections, are rarely demonstrated in these patients. While certain socio-environmental factors are known risk factors for recurring respiratory infections, no unifying biological cause has been discovered for this situation (Lyall et al., 1991) . Interferon (IFN) is considered a major factor in host defence against virus infections of humans. Experimental evidence points to the importance of the IFN system among the host resistance factors effective in the early phases of viral infections, and hence, in the limitation of virus spread in tissues. Several studies concerning disturbances of IFN production in various diseases have been reported, lsaacs et al. (1981) were the first to describe some infection-prone children with deficient virus-induced IFN production. The same authors could not reproduce the observation in the same children 2 years later when the children no longer had recurrent infections. This suggested that a genetic deficiency was not the reason for the original low IFN yields (Chadda et al., 1984) . On the other hand, several other groups have subsequently reported that leukocytes of a proportion of the children suffering from repeated respiratory infections show lowered production of interferon (Bondestam et al., 1984; Pugliese et al., 1985; Vanecek et al., 1985) .",

Therefore, we considered it worthwhile to reexamine the matter and to use a battery of natural respiratory pathogens as inducers. Interferon production was tested in leukocyte cultures from children with repeated respiratory tract infections and/or with frequent middle ear infections, and from healthy children. The data revealed statistically significant difference in IFN yields when cultures were stimulated with 5 out of the 6 inducers.",

Inclusion criteria comprised at least 4 acute otitis episodes and/or at least 6 episodes of upper respiratory tract infections during the last 6 months. The patients were enrolled in the study after an informed consent of the parents. History was taken and routine ear, nose and throat examination was performed. As usual, the chain of infections had started at an early age, from 2 months to 5 years (median 6 months). The children had been healthy for at least one week since the last infection, except for 5 patients, who had ongoing mild respiratory tract infections. Four additional patients were under long-term prophylactic sulfisoxazole treatment (from 3 weeks to 3 months) because of recurrent infections. Thirty-nine children had suffered 6 or more episodes of upper respiratory tract infections (rhinitis, pharyngitis or tonsillitis occasionally combined with sinusitis or otitis) within the last 6 months. Eleven children had frequent middle ear infections without associated rhinitis (at least 4 otitis episodes within the last 6 months). During the present visit, adenoidectomy was performed on 48 patients in order to stop the chain of recurrent infections, and ventilation tubes were inserted in 29 patients because of recurrent otitis media. For 10 patients this was a re-operation (re-adenoidectomy and/or re-tympanostomia) because of a continuous chain of upper respiratory tract infections in spite of previous interventions. Blood specimen for leukocyte preparation was drawn immediately before operation using the needle inserted for injecting intravenous anaesthetics.",

The selected 6 inducers represent only a part of common respiratory pathogens. For the time being it is not possible to judge whether the weak IFN responses represent a primary disorder of interferon production or are due to impaired leukocyte function secondary to the underlying disease. The latter was previously proposed by Pugliese et al. (1985) who found depressed IFN-~ production in the winter when children suffered more from recurrent infections. This conclusion was, however, based on observations on 2 children only. Children in our study, both patients and controls, were investigated during summer. Glaser et al. (1986) have shown, by studying leukocytes from medical students during examinations period, that stress can depress concanavalin A-induced (gamma) interferon production. Increased glucocorticoid levels in blood could theoretically affect IFN production (Vanecek et al., 1985) . One could speculate that patients had lower interferon production values due to stress preceeding the operation. However, also children in the control group may have been under stress because they were being vaccinated and subjected to venipuncture. Anyhow, stress does not fully explain the inducer-specific difference; thus the putative stress did not significantly affect influenza virus-induced interferon production. Moreover, according to another report, stress can also improve the capacity of leukocytes to produce IFN (Palmblad et al., 1975) . Our patients were also slightly older than the controls. However, it is known (Cantell et a1.,1968 ) that age within this range does not affect interferon production, and no tendency towards a correlation between age and IFN yields was seen in this material. From in vitro experiments it is known that cells induced to interferon production show a subsequent refractory 107 period during which they fail to produce interferon on restimulation. One could propose that our patients were in a refractory period because of a recent infection; a few of them had ongoing infection but they did not differ from the rest of patients in interferon production. Others have also found that acute respiratory infection does not impair IFN production by leukocytes in vitro (Bondestam et al., 1984; Vanecek et al., 1985) .",

In principle, such specificity could reflect a genetic property but might also be accounted for by the underlying disease. In the former case, if we assume that the low IFN yields indeed have a role in the decreased resistance to infection, an individual showing poor IFN response to a set of inducers might specifically suffer from infections caused by the respective agents but not from those caused by other agents. In the latter case one assumes that the disease has caused a secondary change in leukocyte subpopulations capable of interferon synthesis. If the former hypothesis is true, one might be able to diagnose the infection-prone children in advance before the chain of infections has started. If the latter alternative is true the responses should return to normal levels in due course after the chain of infections has ceased.",
