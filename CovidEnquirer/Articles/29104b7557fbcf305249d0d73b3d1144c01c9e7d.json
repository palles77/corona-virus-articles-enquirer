            "text": "The synthesis of the structurally unusual heterotricyclic compound 1-[3-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methyl-4-pyridinyl]-2,8,9-trioxaadamantane-3,5,7-triol (trivially named bananin, BN) from pyridoxylidenephloroglucinol and a theoretical prospect on possible biological activities of BN are presented in this report. Pyridoxylidenephloroglucinol is synthesized by Knoevenagel condensation of the vitamin B 6 aldehyde pyridoxal with phloroglucinol. Pyridoxylidenephloroglucinol rearranges to lightyellow (4 0 RS)-1 0 ,4 0 -dihydrobananin by refluxing in 5 M hydrochloric acid. Air oxidation subsequently forms BN in the heat which immediately yields orange-yellow (4 0 RS)-4 0 -chloro-1 0 ,4 0 -dihydrobananin by 1,4-addition of hydrogen chloride. This intermediate could be isolated but, interestingly, not a BN hydrochloride. Brown BN is finally achieved by base-catalyzed elimination of hydrogen chloride from (4 0 RS)-4 0 -chloro-1 0 ,4 0 -dihydrobananin. Regarding possible biological activities, it was demonstrated that BN acts as zinc (Zn 2+ ) chelator. Therefore, a target of interest could be the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) zinc finger HIV-1 RNA-binding nucleocapsid protein p7 (NCp7). Through suggested zinc ejection from HIV-1 genomic RNA c-element-binding and HIV-1-RNA-duplex packaging NCp7 by BN, thus rendering NCp7 functionally obsolete, it is deduced that HIV-1 replication and effective infectious virion encapsidation could be inhibited by BN. Furthermore, theoretical and structural considerations propose that BN is converted into bananin 5 0 -monophosphate (BNP) by the cell type-ubiquitous human enzyme pyridoxal kinase (EC 2.7.1.35). Together with the putative antilentiviral retinoid vitamin A-vitamin B 6 conjugate analogue B6RA (Kesel, A. J. Biochem. Biophys. Res. Comm. 2003, 300, 793), BNP is postulated to serve as effector in a system of protein target sequences RX(D/E) of RNA virus components. Human immunodeficiency Retroviridae (HIVs) could possibly be influenced by B6RA and BNP. In addition, candidate targets of B6RA and BNP could be adsorption, transcription and/or viral RNA replication of an interestingly wide RNA virus selection including Picornaviridae (poliovirus, human coxsackievirus, hepatitis A virus), Flaviviridae (yellow fever virus, Dengue virus, West Nile virus, Kunjin virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, hepatitis C virus), Togaviridae (rubella virus), Coronaviridae (human coronavirus, human SARS-associated coronavirus), Rhabdoviridae (rabies virus), Paramyxoviridae (human parainfluenza virus, measles virus, human respiratory syncytial virus), Filoviridae (Marburg virus, Ebola virus), Bornaviridae (Borna disease virus), Bunyaviridae (Hantaan virus), Arenaviridae (Lassa virus), and Reoviridae (human rotavirus). The postulated scope of 'metabolically trapped' BNP might resemble the antiviral spectrum of the RNA-viral virustatic ribavirin. #",

No a,b-unsaturated, quinoid carbonyl absorption at wavenumbers between 1700 and 1600 cm \u00c01 could be seen. Instead a very broad OH band between 3650 and 1800 cm \u00c01 dominates the IR spectrum. It represents a valence bond vibration of hydrogen-bonded O-H, and, respectively, intra/intermolecular polymeric associated chelate O-H. At 2900 cm \u00c01 a methyl group C-H and at 2825 cm \u00c01 a methylene group C-H valence bond vibration can be identified. At 1590 and 1520 cm \u00c01 C-C aromatic valence bond vibrations of a pyridine heterocycle can be detected. At wavenumbers of 1430 cm \u00c01 a methylene C-H deformation vibration and 1395 cm \u00c01 a methyl group C-H deformation vibration can be analyzed. Very characteristic is the aromatic C-O phenolic valence bond vibration at 1210 cm \u00c01 . The two bands at 1065 cm \u00c01 (Ar-CH 2 -OH) and 1110 cm \u00c01 are aliphatic C-O valence bond vibrations. The absorption band at 820 cm \u00c01 is fitting to a 1,2,3,4-tetrasubstituted aromate with one isolated CH. Taken together, already the IR data unequivocally proof the unusual 1-[3-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl) -2 -methyl -4 -pyridinyl] -2,8,9 -trioxaadamantane-3,5,7-triol structure because the 6-hydroxy -4 -(hydroxymethyl) -1-methyl -8H- [1] benzopyrano [2,3c] pyridin-8-one alternative would have a strong a,bunsaturated, quinoid carbonyl absorption between wavenumbers of 1775 and 1650 cm \u00c01 (preferably 1650-1700 cm \u00c01 , p-benzoquinone 1669 cm \u00c01 ). The predominant, very broad OH band from 3650 to 1800 cm \u00c01 peaking at 3350 cm \u00c01 pointed to strongly associated intermolecular hydrogen bonds in the solid state of the brown substance KBr pellet. A similar effect was observed in the IR spectrum (in KBr) of the polyhydroxyl, solvent-retaining compound tetrodotoxin. 3 UV spectrophotometry of the reaction product resulting from the heat and hydrochloric acid treatment of pyridoxylidenephloroglucinol An UV electronic absorption spectrum of the substance was recorded in 0.1 M sodium hydroxide solution (Fig. 3) . The solubility of the material in water, ethanol, or dilute acid [dilute hydrochloric (HCl) and sulfuric acid (H 2 SO 4 )] is too low to work in these solvents. The product is soluble in sodium hydroxide solution and dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) to give yellow to brown solutions. The UV spectrum showed two maxima at 220.0 nm (e=22,443 L mol \u00c01 cm \u00c01 ) and 285.8 nm (e=11,591 L mol \u00c01 cm \u00c01 ), the molar mass for the cal- Figure 1 .

This result can be reasonably interpreted in the way that a typical sodium phenolate [sodium phenolate in water: l 1,max =235 nm (e=9400), l 2,max =287 nm (e=2600)] is the chromophor of the compound. The structure 6hydroxy-4-(hydroxymethyl)-1-methyl-8H- [1] benzopyrano [2,3-c] pyridin-8-one would show an electronic absorption maximum at a wavelength of approximately 450 nm similar to the a,b-unsaturated carbonyl condensate B6PR. 11 Therefore, the UV spectrophotometry supplies us with strong evidence for 1-[3-hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methyl-4-pyridinyl]-2,8,9-trioxaada-mantane-3,5,7-triol to represent the UV chromophor of the unknown product.

            "text": "Since the organic chemical structure of the material resulting from the heat and hydrochloric acid treatment of pyridoxylidenephloroglucinol could be defined by the analytical results, an experimentally based scheme for the chemical reactions leading to the synthesis of 1-[3hydroxy-5-(hydroxymethyl)-2-methyl-4-pyridinyl]-2,8,9trioxatricyclo[3.3.1.1 3,7 ]decane-3,5,7-triol is depicted (Fig. 5 ). The hypothesis that bananin is an highly intermolecular-associated material, leading to a nearly black colour through interaromatic charge-transfer complexation between the pyridine heterocycles and hydro-gen-bonding between the trioxa-adamantane-triol heterotricycles is supported by combination of the IR, UV, and 1 H NMR data (Fig. 6 ). An instruction protocol for the isolation of amorphous bananin picrate was developed. Amorphous bananin picrate is soluble in water with intense yellow colour and liberates brownblack amorphous bananin by treatment with strong bases (NaOH solution). The intermolecular network leading to the black colour of bananin is interrupted in the yellow bananin picrate (Fig. 6 ) by complexing the pyridine heterocycle with picric acid. Furthermore, a sodium hydroxide-containing solution of bananin monosodium salt in water both forms a blue copper complex with Cu(OH) 2 and a white zinc complex with Zn(OH) 2 . It is proposed that bananin behaves as bidentate chelate donor to build the tetragonal-planar coordination complex (SP-4-1)-bis (Fig. 7) . In addition, it should be mentioned that bananin has lost most of its vitamin B 6 character. The pyridine nitrogen is less basic than in pyridoxal and the UV parameters of pyridoxine/pyridoxal are left. Instead a typical phenolic behaviour is found and the tendency of (NaOH) . Finally, the brown-black bananin is isolated by help of its relative insolubility in water. Figure 6 .

Pyridoxal kinase can phosphorylate an array of vitamin B 6 -derivatives with modulated substituents in position 4 of the pyridine heterocycle, additionally to its natural substrates pyridoxine, pyridoxal and pyridoxamine. 14, 15 This was theoretically proofed by the crystal structure determination of sheep brain pyridoxal kinase 16 which shows a tight binding of the 3 -hydroxy -5 -(hydroxymethyl) -2 -methylpyridine vitamin B 6 core structure of pyridoxal in the substratebinding pocket, but structural fill space at the 4-position of the vitamin B 6 core element. 16 Conclusively, it is reasonable to speculate that BN is converted into BNP by the human tissue-ubiquitous pyridoxal kinase, 13 and such is 'metabolically trapped' inside the cell after cellular uptake by vitamin B 6 carrier systems. Through usage of vitamin B 6 metabolic systems high intracellular concentrations of BNP could be achieved since the phosphate group-induced zwitterionic, hydrophilic appearance of BNP prevents reverse cell membrane passage.",

BNP should have a similar salt-bridge amphoteric affinity to RX(D/E) protein sequence motifs like B6RA. Therefore, it could covalently bind to viral RX(D/E) sequences and, analogously to B6RA, chemically modify important viral proteins, thus making them functionally obsolete. Together with the putative antilentiviral retinoid vitamin A-vitamin B 6 conjugate analogue B6RA, BNP is proposed to serve as effector in a system of protein target sequences RX(D/E) of RNA virus components. Human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV-1) trans-activating transcriptional regulatory protein Tat sequences PRGDP and PRLEP were suggested as possible targets of B6RA. 12 I propose a binding of B6RA/BNP to Tat PRGDP tat exon 2-encoded C-terminal sequence which serves also for cross-talk with cellular tumor suppressor protein p53. 12 BNP could form an active ester at the tat exon 2-encoded Cterminal PRGDP sequence (Fig. 10) by addition of the aspartate (d) residue to the trioxa-adamantane-triol 4substituent-activated pyridine heterocycle in BNP (Fig. 10 ). This 1,4-dihydro-4-pyridinyl active ester species would be principally able to cross-link Tat d-amidelike to amino groups of DNA nucleobases (adenine, guanine, cytosine) in HIV-1 proviral integrated U3/R sequences of HIV-1 5 0 -long terminal repeat or, more generally, in host cellular DNA. In this way, nonrepairable Tat protein-DNA complexes would serve as trigger for DNA damage-induced apoptosis selectively in cells in which Tat is present. As a result the host organism would be specifically extricated from integrated HIV-1 proviruses. 12 Table 1 ) by addition of the aspartate group to the pyridine ring of RGD-ionic contact (IC)-bound BNP resulting in an activated 1,4-dihydro-4-pyridinyl ester.",

The most important human RNA virus pathogens were considered. Surprisingly, many indispensable virus proteins contain often conserved B6RAand BNP-binding triplets RX(D/E) which are frequently surrounded by hydrophobic protein sequence strips enhancing affinity for the B6RA hydrophobic vitamin A chain (Table 1). Candidate targets of B6RA and BNP were found within proteins of RNA viruses like Picornaviridae (poliovirus, human coxsackievirus, hepatitis A virus), Flaviviridae (yellow fever virus, Dengue virus, West Nile virus, Kunjin virus, St. Louis encephalitis virus, hepatitis C virus), Togaviridae (rubella virus), Coronaviridae (human coronavirus, human SARS-associated coronavirus), Rhabdoviridae (rabies virus), Paramyxoviridae (human parainfluenza virus, measles virus, human respiratory syncytial virus), Filoviridae (Marburg virus, Ebola virus), Bornaviridae (Borna disease virus), Bunyaviridae (Hantaan virus), Arenaviridae (Lassa virus), Reoviridae (human rotavirus), and Retroviridae (HIV-1). The antiviral scope of B6RA/BNP may be related to the broad-spectrum",
