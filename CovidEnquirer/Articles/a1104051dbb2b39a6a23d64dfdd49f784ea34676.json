Of the several SARS CoV structural proteins, the nucleocapsid protein has been shown to be a good diagnostic marker. In this study, an ssDNA aptamer that specifically binds to SARS CoV nucleocapsid protein was isolated from a DNA library containing 45-nuceotide random sequences in the middle of an 88mer single-stranded DNA. After twelve cycles of systematic evolution of ligands by exponential enrichment (SELEX) procedure, 15 ssDNA aptamers were identified. Enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) analysis was then used to identify the aptamer with the highest binding affinity to the SARS CoV nucleocapsid protein. Using this approach, an ssDNA aptamer that binds to the nucleocapsid protein with a K d of 4.93 \u00b1 0.30 nM was identified. Western blot analysis further demonstrated that this ssDNA aptamer could be used to efficiently detect the SARS CoV nucleocapsid protein when compared with a nucleocapsid antibody. Therefore, we believe that the selected ssDNA aptamer may be a good alternative detection probe for the rapid and sensitive detection of SARS.",

Although no reoccurrence has yet been reported, SARS continues to be of great concern because no vaccine or clinical drug is currently available. SARS was caused by a novel coronavirus, SARS coronavirus (SARS CoV). The virus is a (+) sense single-stranded RNA virus with a genome containing 29,727 nucleotides (2,3) which consist of four structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N) (4) . Similar to other coronaviruses, the S and N proteins are highly expressed during viral infection and are a useful target for immune detection (5, 6) . The SARS CoV N protein is of particular interest because it can be a potential target for vaccine development (7) as well as a diagnostic marker for SARS CoV infection (8, 9) . The N protein has been shown to stimulate immune responses in the host, indicating that it has strong antigenicity. Moreover, it is expressed predominantly during the early stage of viral infection (10) and thus is an attractive target for diagnostics. It has also been reported that the convalescent sera from SARS patients strongly reacted with the N protein.",

The N protein was immobilized on Ni-coated plates and various concentrations of the 5\u2032-biotinylated aptamer candidates were added. After addition of streptavidin-HRP, the absorbance at 492 nm was measured. The binding curve was fit to a hyperbolic equation based on Michaelis-Menten kinetics, and we were able to obtain the amplitude and K d value (Table S1 ). Of the 15 aptamer candidates, the K d values of two aptamers, named aptamer 1 and aptamer 11, that displayed high affinity were determined from the binding curve (Fig. 3A) . Although both aptamers showed high binding affinities to the N protein, aptamer 1 (K d = 4.93 \u00b1 0.30 nM) exhibited a slightly higher affinity than aptamer 11 (K d = 9.02 \u00b11.89 nM). When we compared the K d values of the ssDNA aptamers with RNA aptamer (equilibrium dissociation constant of 1.65 nM), which was recently published (15), they were quite comparable. However, the nucleotide sequence and secondary structure of the selected RNA aptamer are different from the ones of our selected DNA aptamers. This suggests that the nucleotide component is not important for high affinity binding to the N protein. Therefore, proper binding to the protein might be more important for nucleic acid aptamers even though the exact binding site is unknown at present. In addition, the fact that natural RNA is very liable to digest by nuclease attack makes DNA a more suitable candidate for target protein detection. Based on the ELISA results, aptamer 1 was chosen for further bioinformatic analysis and the MFOLD program was used to predict secondary structures (Fig. 3B) . In this analysis, the 45 random sequence region of aptamer 1 (shaded nucleotides) was shown to consist of a major loop with a small hairpin and base-paired nucleotides with the defined sequences flanking the random region. The GC rich conserved sequence, as described in group 1 aptamers, was also found to be located at the stem-loop region (indicated by black line).",

            "text": "Western blot analysis using selected ssDNA aptamer Western blot analysis was performed to determine if the selected ssDNA aptamer 1 can be used as a substitute for the N protein antibody. When various amounts of N protein (0-18.4 \u03bcg) were analyzed by Western blotting with 500 ng/mL of 5\u2032-biotinylated aptamer 1, we found that the band intensities increased as the amount of N protein increased (Fig. 4A ). This indicates that the selected aptamer 1 bound to the N protein in dose dependent manner, and could be used as an alternative to antibodies for the detection of the N protein. We also performed a comparative Western blotting experiments with commercial His probe-HRP and Anti-N protein followed by secondary antibody conjugated HRP (Fig. 4B) . The result showed that the band intensities generated using the anti-N protein and aptamer 1 were similar to each other (lanes 2 and 3 in Fig. 4B) . However, the detection sensitivity was not significant when the His probe-HRP was used (lane 1 in Fig. 4B ) under the reaction condition described above. Our results suggest that the ssDNA aptamer isolated in this study could be used as an alternative to the antibody for the detection of the N protein. Because aptamers can bind to specific target proteins with high affinity, they have been referred to as 'chemical antibodies'. It is also worth noting that DNA can be synthesized easily while antibody generation relies on the immune system of animals. In addition, the fact that aptamers have higher stability than protein antibodies makes aptamers more useful in the development of diagnostic systems, such as viral infection and cancers (20) .",
