            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a contagious, highly fatal coronavirus disease of domestic and exotic cats [1] [2] [3] . Most cats naturally exposed to FIP virus (FIPV) develop antibody titers without showing clinical signs. Only a very small number of these infected cats will eventually (weeks to years later) develop a fatal systemic disease characterized by fibrinous peritonitis, pleuritis, or disseminated granulomata [4] [5] [6] . The reasons for virus dissemination in these previously exposed cats are unknown. The lesions in FIP are characterized histologically by generalized vasculitis or perivasculitis, fibronecrotizing and pyogranulomatous imflammation of serosal membranes and parenchymal organs, and mesothelial hyperplasia [2,7 11] . These lesions are believed to result from immunologically-mediated tissue reactions in response to systemic virus infection [1, 2, [12] [13] [14] . Spontaneous FIP cases will frequently demonstrate marked hyperproteinemia (greater than 8-10mg/100ml), hypergammaglobulinemia, polyclonal gammopathy, and markedly elevated anti-FIPV serum antibody titers [3, 15, 16] . Circulating immune complexes* and renal glomerular deposits of immunoglobulin (Ig)G and complement (C3) (17) can be detected in cats with spontaneous or experimentally induced FIP.",

Many of these kittens died after developing acute disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC) and severe systemic vasculitis; FIP viral antigen and immunoglobulin G were demonstrated in hepatic lesions [12] . Additional studies demonstrated that healthy nonviremic seropositive kittens developed viremia and vascular lesions earlier and died more rapidly after FIPV challenge than did seronegative kittens [14] . These studies showed that FIPV persists in circulating mononuclear cells of infected kittens despite high levels of anti-FIPV antibodies. Other investigators recently reported enhancement of disease in FIPVchallenged kittens possessing naturally acquired or passively administered antibodies against FIPV [13] . These studies demonstrated FIPV, virus-bound IgG, and complement (C3) within macrophages in lesions, hypocomplementemia, and the occurrence of nonneutralizing serum antibodies in infected cats.",

The majority of cases of DHF occur as secondary infections in patients with pre-existing serum antibody to dengue viruses [18, 19] . It is postulated that upon reinfection with a heterologous serotype of dengue virus, the patient with DHF rapidly develops high titers of cross-reacting but non-neutralizing antibodies [20] . The formation of large amounts of virus antibody complexes may then lead to activation of complement and a hemorrhagic shock syndrome [21, 22] . In DHF, as in FIP, virus replicates and persists in mononuclear phagocytes in the presence of non-neutralizing antibodies [23, 24] ; circulating immune complexes [25, 26] and decreases in serum complement levels [21, 27] may occur; virus, antiviral antibody, and complement components are demonstrated within blood vessels or lesions [28] ; and DIC may develop in certain cases [21, 29] .",

Indirect fluorescent antibody techniques for detection of FIP viral antigen were performed essentially as described by Pedersen [5] except fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)--conjugated Staph Protein A (Pharmacia Fine Chemicals, Piscataway, New Jersey) replaced the FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-cat immunoglobulin G (IgG). The former binds specifically to the Fc region of IgG of a number of species [32] . For demonstration of IgG, complement (C3), and fibrinogen, acetone-fixed sections of each sample were overlaid with FITC-conjugated Staph Protein A, FITC-conjugated goat anti-dog C3 (lot No. 10183, Cappel Laboratories, Inc., Cochranville, Pennsylvania), or FITC-conjugated goat anti-human fibrinogen (lot No. $379, Miles Laboratories, Inc., Elkart, Indiana), respectively.

These foci were characterized by perivascular and vascular infiltrations by macrophages, neutrophils, lymphocytes, fibrin and necrotic debris. Affected veins frequently demonstrated degeneration and necrosis of cells in the media and adventitia and perivascular edema.

Complement activation in FIP may result from intravascular or perivascular deposition of immune complexes, or possibly from cytotoxic, complementfixing antibodies directed against virus-infected cells. Antibody-mediated or immune complex-mediated immunopathologic reactions in or around small blood vessels may result in endothelial injury, platelet aggregation, microthrombi formation and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC); several cases of DIC have been induced in FIP antibody-positive kittens experimentally infected with FIPV [12] . FIPV-infected kittens in the present study developed severe phlebitis, occasional thrombosis, and marked deposition of fibrinogen within veins and in lesions. An interesting observation is the earlier and more severe thrombocytopenia in the antibody-sensitized vs non-sensitized kittens. This finding may reflect early immunologic reactions in veins with perhaps two consequences of intravascular complement activation: immune complex vasculitis with platelet clumping at sites of endothelial injury, or complement-mediated platelet aggregation [33] . Alternatively, there may be an accelerated (antibody-mediated?) lysis of platelets in sensitized kittens.",

In contrast, similar temperatures were not observed in kittens given nonimmune serum until after PID 8 to 12; two non-sensitized kittens developed mild transient fever on PID 2. The onset of clinical signs in non-sensitized kittens coincided closely with seroconversion and the appearance of the second temperature spike. The latter may represent systemic immunopathological disease (e.g. immune complex hypersensitivity) or perhaps late (secondary) viremia, whereas the mild transient temperature rise on PID 2 in two non-sensitized kittens suggests a primary viremia. The earlier and persistent fever in seropositive kittens, in contrast, may reflect enhanced (antibody-mediated?) viral infection, resulting in more rapid viremia and immunopathological disease. Indeed, previous studies in our laboratory have shown earlier cell infection, viremia, and vasculitis in FIPVchallenged seropositive kittens compared to seronegative kittens [14] ; it was suggested that FIPV antibody may be involved not only in immunopathologic disease (i.e. immune complex disease or complement-mediated cytotoxicity) but also in in vivo antibodymediated enhancement of virus infection in macrophages. The latter phenomenon has been reported in both in vitro and in vivo studies of dengue virus infection in monkeys [34, 35] .",

            "text": "The antibody-mediated enhancement of disease demonstrated in laboratory kittens infected with FIPV resembles certain immunopathological features of dengue hemorrhagic fever (DHF) in persons. Patients with preinfection heterotypic immunity to one of the four known serotypes of dengue virus occasionally develop a severe shock syndrome when infected by a different serotype [19] . This syndrome is characterized by fever, marked changes in vascular permeability, hypovolemic shock, thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic diathesis [36] . Several theories are proposed to explain the occurrence of DHF. In one view, complement activation by immune complexes is the major initiating factor [21] . According to this theory, patients with preinfection immunity against a single dengue virus serotype make an anamnestic antibody response when infected with a second serotype. These antibodies are non-neutralizing yet cross-reactive with the heterologous virus; circulating immune complexes are formed which may deposit in blood vessels, activate complement and result in a shock syndrome. In support of this are the findings in DHF patients of lowered serum complement levels [21, 27] , circulating immune complexes [25, 26] , and deposition of dengue virus, IgM, and/~-lc globulin in or around blood vessels in lesions [28] . A second theory argues against immune complex disease per se and proposes instead that non-neutralizing antibody opsonizes virus and leads to an immunologic enhancement of virus infection in mononuclear phagocytes and possibly complement activation via the alternative pathway [37] . An accelerated, severe viral disease would thus occur in patients with preinfection heterotypic immunity prior to the appearance of neutralizing antibodies against the infecting virus. In support of this view, several studies have demonstrated antibody-mediated enhancement of dengue virus infection in monkeys [34] and in cultured primate leukocytes [35] .",

Passively administered antibodies reactive with FIP virus do not neutralize parentally inoculated virus ; these antibodies, in fact, somehow sensitize the recipient, and a more acute and fulminating disease occurs. The enhanced infection of FIPV in macrophages of seropositive kittens [14, 38] may, as in dengue virus infection, reflect the opsonic activity of antibodies which are non-neutralizing for but reactive with the challenge virus. It is presently unclear whether non-neutralizing FIP antibodies are heterotypic (as in DHF) or homotypic (as in Aleutian disease of mink [39] ). Although the existence of different FIPV serotypes is not yet established, differences in virus neutralization of various FIPV isolates against a cross-reacting porcine coronavirus suggest that more than one FIPV serotype may occur [31] . If this is the case, a situation similar to DHF in persons could develop in seropositive cats acutely infected with a heterologous FIPV serotype (or perhaps other cross-reacting coronavirus) i.e. high titers of non-neutralizing, cross-reacting antibodies, rapid formation of virus-antibody complexes, facilitated virus replication and persistence in mononuclear phagocytes, and widespread complement activation.",
