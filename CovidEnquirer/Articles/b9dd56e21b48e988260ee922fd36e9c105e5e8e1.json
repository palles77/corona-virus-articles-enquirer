The following classification was used: squamous cell metaplasia with marked keratinization, keratinizing cyst, cystic keratinizing epithelioma, cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma, keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma and non-keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. In study A (inhalation of coal oven exhaust and subcutaneous injection of a high dose of DB (ah)A) 49.3 % of rats developed cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas. Inhalation of coal oven exhaust gas together with intratracheal instillation of crocidolite or subcutaneous injection of a low dose DB(ah)A (dibenz(ah)anthracene) resulted in cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas in 23 % to 24 % of the rats. High incidences of cystic squamous cell carcinomas in the range of31.9 % to 76.4 % were observed in rats of Study B 1 after a 10-months exposure to tar/pitch condensation aerosol (different B(a)P (benzo(a)pyrene) concentrations) with added carbon black in some groups. After a 20-months exposure period to the same inhalation atmospheres (Study B2) the incidence of squamous cell carcinomas was increased up to 95.8 %. Exposure of rats to va-4 Professor Emeritus rious concentrations of unfiltered diesel exhaust (Study C) resulted in incidences of cystic keratinizing epitheliomas ranging from 2.5 % (2.5 mg/m3) to 10.7 % (7 .5 mg/m3). Epitheliomas were also observed in 16.2 % of carbon black and 16.0 % of titanium dioxide exposed rats. Only a few cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas occurred.

The health hazard arising from asbestos fibres in particular has been demonstrated by several epidemiological and animal studies with the result that asbestos was banned as building material. Several other particles (diesel exhaust particles, titanium dioxide, quartz dust, tar/pitch aerosols etc.) are suspected to be involved in the development of human lung cancer. However, results of epidemiological studies on these particles are unclear due to the complex exposure situation of human beings. Therefore chronic inhalation and instillation studies with laboratory rodents remain a helpful tool for the assessment of cancer risk in humans. Unfortunately, the interpretation of these studies sometimes becomes difficult if particle-induced lesions occur in the lungs of rodents but lack a known counterpart in the human pulmonary tissue.",

            "text": "Two recent attempts to clarify the histopathological nature of cystic keratinizing lesions of the rat lung were made at workshops in Newark, USA (1992) and Hannover, Germany (1995) . At the Newark-workshop thirteen pathologists, experienced in lung pathology reviewed cystic keratinizing lesions from two inhalation studies. In these studies, rats were either exposed to titanium dioxide or para-aramid fibrils. Most of the slides were taken from a para-aramid fibril inhalation study. The majority of workshop participants agreed that the lesion should be considered as a non-neoplastic change and that the term \"proliferative keratin cyst\" should be applied for its appropriate description. Only a minority (3/13) considered the lesions as benign tumours. The keratinizing cysts were considered to have no significance for human health, since comparable lesions had not been observed in humans (CARLTON 1994; LEVY 1994; SCHULTZ 1995) . Since the number of lesions reviewed at the Newark workshop was small and the presented cases were obtained from only two different rat inhalation studies, a second workshop on this topic (sponsored by the Deutsche Forschungsgemeinschaft) was initiated in Hannover. Based on a broad spectrum of particles (11 different test substances from 13 different inhalation studies) the biological behaviour of cystic keratinizing lesions was discussed again by a panel of eleven pathologists. Sixty-one slides of cystic keratinizing lesions from 56 rats of different strains were reviewed. There was agreement by the participants that the cystic keratinizing lesions reviewed represented a family of lesions that contained many morphological similarities. It became apparent at the workshop that the lesions comprised a spectrum of related morphological changes that ranged from squamous metaplasia with marked keratinization through pulmonary keratinizing cysts to cystic keratinizing epithelioma and finally pulmonary squamous cell carcinoma (BOORMANN et al. 1996) .",

For the detection of changes of proliferation behaviour of cells, immunohistochemical labeling of the marker of proliferative cell activity PCNA (\"proliferating cell nuclear antigen\") was considered a suitable supplementary method for the classification of tumours and the differentiation between neoplastic and non-neoplastic le-SIOns.",

Generally, all of them showed at least one cavity filled with keratin and surrounded by a highly keratinized squamous epithelium. One type of cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma seemed to develop from cystic epithelioma. These neoplasms revealed focal atypia of tumour cells, resulting from disorganised cells with enlarged and sometimes irregularly-formed nuclei. An increased number of mitotic figures was usually observed. 440 Exp Toxic Patho149 (1997) 6 The thickness of epithelium was increased to more than eight layers in these parts an in addition to the basal layers, mitotic figures were seen in other layers of the epithelium. Sometimes focal invasion accompanied by a scirrhous reaction could be seen ( fig. 3 ). Mast cells were frequently seen in connective tissue adjacent to the tumours. Other regions of the wall of these cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas resembled cystic keratinizing epitheliomas. In these regions, the tumour wall was three to eight layers thick, regularly organised and cellular atypia was absent or minimal. Mitoses were restricted to the basal layers and extension of the tumours by peripheral extension of epithelial cell nests into adjacent alveolar spaces could be observed. Another type of cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma obviously developed a central keratin filled cavity due to degeneration and necrosis of centrally located squamous epithelium and replacement of the epithelial structures by accumulating keratin. A mesh of necrotic remnants of cords of epithelial cells was visible in parts of the keratin filled lumen of these neoplasms. Some tumours of both variants of cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas had parts with predominantly spindleshaped cells which had an increased number of mitoses. In these spindle-cell parts little or no keratinization was observed. The central keratin of the carcinomas had a laminated appearance and was mixed with cell detritus, macrophages and occasionally shadow cells. Frequently entrapped islands of squamous cells or papillary projections were seen in the central keratin. In many carcinomas the central keratin also was mixed with polymorphonuclear granulocytes. This was the case in almost all B(a)P induced neoplasms and also frequently seen in lungs with severe inflammation and fibrosis. Focal regressive changes were occasionally seen in the tumour periphery. Beside pressure atrophy (marked reduction of the number of cell layers) of the epithelial wall in subpleural areas, loss of squamous epithelium was also observed in parts of the tumour distant from the pleura. The epithelial wall was only few layers thick or replaced by connective tissue infiltrated by macrophages, giant cells and few mast cells or lymphocytes. Invasion of the pleura and of bronchi or even blood vessels was frequently observed. Occasionally invasive growth into tissue adjacent to the lung could be seen. Tissues involved included mediastinum, periaortic tissue and diaphragm. A few metastases were noted in intrapulmonary blood or lymph vessels, mediastinum, lung-associated lymph nodes, heart and kidney. Some cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas exhibited small parts with glandular structures. These glandular structures contained goblet-cells, but no signs of malignant growth were present. Therefore a diagnosis as adenosquamous carcinoma was declined.",

A few benign cystic keratinizing epitheliomas but high numbers of cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas occured in Study B. This might be explained by longer duration of exposure (up to 30 months) in Study B or different sensitivity of Wi star and SPRD rats to squamous cell carcinoma induction by combinations of particles and PAHs.",

            "text": "Much of the discussion about the significance of cystic keratinizing lesions of the rat lung in chronic inhalation studies concentrates on the biological behaviour of that lesions. The majority of members of a workshop in Newark, U.S.A., denied the possibility of a malignant transformation of cystic keratinizing lesions and regarded them as non-neoplastic changes (CARLTON 1994 , LEVY 1994 . For the designation of the squamous lesions from two inhalation studies (titanium dioxide, para-aramid fibrils) the workshop members preferred the term \"proliferative keratin cyst\". Proliferative cysts are very rare in veterinary and human pathology. Variants described were derived from the epidermis or its associated structures. The term is only applied to a special variant of the istmuscatagen (tricho1emmal) cyst or some matrical cysts of dogs (WALDER and GROSS 1993) . In both cases, proliferative cysts are looked upon as transitional stages of neoplastic development to cornifying keratoacanthoma (WEISS and FRESE 1974) or pilomatricoma and trichoepithelioma (WALDER and GROSS 1993) . Also in human pathology proliferating tricholemmal cysts, classified according to the WHO-nomenclature of skin tumours, are regarded as transitional stages in the development of pilar tumours of the scalp (HEENAN et al. 1996; NOLTENIUS and COLMANT 1987) . For that reasons the term proliferative cyst generally seems to be inappropriate for the description of what was believed to be a non-neoplastic lesion. As a result of the Hannover workshop, cystic keratinizing lesions were looked upon as a family of related changes, including squamous metaplasia with excessive keratinization, keratinizing cysts, benign cystic keratinizing epitheliomas and finally cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas. The presence of focal cellular atypia, increased mitotic activity, loss of polarity of cells and invasive growth in the wall of cystic keratinizing tumours justified a classification of some of these tumours as carcinomas (BOORMAN et al. 1996) . The findings in our own studies support this opinion. In two of four studies, cystic keratinizing tumours were observed which had a benign histological appearance in most parts of the tumour, but focally revealed invasive growth into adjacent connective tissue or bronchi, resulting in a classification as cystic squamous cell carcinomas. In a single case, a keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma focally arising from the wall of a cystic keratinizing epithelioma was observed in a rat exposed to titanium dioxide. Two similar cases were reported by MAUDERLY et al. (1994) in F344 rats exposed to diesel exhaust particles or carbon black by inhalation. All these findings indicate, that cystic keratinizing epitheliomas are not necessarily an endpoint of development, but may progress to (cystic keratinizing) squamous cell carcinoma.",

            "text": "Demonstration ofPCNA in this study revealed that the cystic keratinizing lesions classified as cystic keratinizing epitheliomas have a distinct proliferative activity. PCNA is a 36-kda nuclear protein, that is a co-factor of DNApolymerase (BRAVO et al. 1987) . This cell protein is considered as endogenous marker of proliferation (HALL et al. 1990 ) that can be labeled immunohistochemically. In normal tissue, the monoclonal antibody PClO directed against PCNA reveals positive reactions in all proliferating cells (HOFSTADTER et al. 1995 ). FRAME et al. (1996 reported the proliferative activity of cystic keratinizing lesions in the lung of rats after exposure to para-aramid fibrils in comparison to spontaneous keratoacanthomas. In the six examined cystic keratinizing lesions only a few nuclei were stained for PCNA in the basal cell layer or the outer layer of epithelial cell nests. In the present studies, over 100 cystic keratinizing squamous lesions were examined and it could be shown that numerous lesions classified as epitheliomas had positively labeled nuclei (anti-PCNA antibody, clone PC 10) in one or two, focally even in three or four peripheral cell layers, comparable to the proliferative activity of keratoacanthomas demonstrated by FRAME et al. (1996) . Human squamous cell carcinomas of the lung were examined immunohistochemically with an anti-PCNA antibody (clone 19A2) by CAREY et al. (1992) . Positive labeling of peripheral cell layers by the antibody was found in the majority of cases examined in primary squamous cell carcinomas and metastases. However, the authors indicated strong variations of positive reactions between different parts of one tumour. This was also confirmed by our own immunohistochemical examinations. Frequently, serial sections were necessary to detect strongly positive areas in the neoplasms. Generally, immunohistochemical demonstration of PCNA has proven to be an additional tool for evaluation of biological behaviour of cystic keratinizing lesions. Results of microscopic examination of haematoxilin and eosin stained slides were confirmed by this technique. Lesions classified as squamous metaplasia with abundant keratinization or keratinizing cysts revealed no or weakly positive reaction. Although neoplasms with distinct atypia or even invasive growth showed only staining reactions in two to four cell layers in some parts of the tumour, in other areas of the same tumour a much higher number of cell layers were positively labeled. The portion ofPCNApositive nuclei increased with increasing degree of cellular atypia. The estimation of the mean number of proliferating cell layers in the periphery of immunohistochemically stained tumours was the most reliable method for the distinction between keratinizing cyst, cystic keratinizing epithelioma and cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinoma. Other classic criteria for malignant behavior like invasion or metastasis, cellular atypia, and number of mitosis however, are still the primary diagnostic aids.",

            "text": "In the studies, reported in this paper, exposure atmospheres of rats were characterised by high contents of particles. Exposure to particles and especially combinations of particles with B(a)p or other carcinogens resulted in the induction of a variety of squamous lung neoplasms including benign cystic keratinizing epitheliomas, cystic keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas and simple keratinizing squamous cell carcinomas. In contrast, there are only few epidemiological studies that report an increased risk of lung tumours in humans after exposure to the par-ticles (diesel exhaust particles, titanium dioxide, carbon black, etc.) used in the rodent studies. Slightly increased cancer risk due to exposure to diesel motor exhaust was reported by GARSHICK et al. (1988) in railroad workers, by BOFFETTA et al. (1990) in railroad workers and miners and by DUBROW and WEGMAN (1983) in bus-, taxi-and truck drivers. In some rural areas of China, increased lung cancer risk seems to be associated with indoor air pollution by burning of smoky coal (MUMFORD et al. 1987) or sleeping on beds heated by coal-burning stoves (Xu et al. 1989; Wu-WILLIAMS et al. 1990 ). In contrast, several epidemiological studies on coal dust exposed coal miners (MAUDERL Y 1994) , workers of the carbon black industry INGALLS 1980, 1989; HODGSON and JONES 1985) or workers of titanium dioxide producing factories (CHEN and FAYERWEATHER 1988) revealed no increased risk for lung cancer. The discrepancy between the results of chronic inhalation and instillation studies in rodents and the lack of epidemiological evidence for an increased risk of lung cancer in humans exposed to the same particles raises the question on the relevance of these studies for human beings. Since especially the rat (compared to mouse or hamster) seems to have a high sensibility for the lung tumour induction by particles (WATSON and VALBERG 1996) the occurrence of lung neoplasms in inhalation studies of this species is frequently interpreted as a species specific phenomenon and its relevance for humans is refused. In a number of studies it could indeed be demonstrated that the rat reveals some special characteristics concerning the lung reaction to inhaled particles and inhalative particle overload of the lung compared to other rodent species, monkeys and man. The location of particle deposition in the lung differs between monkeys (which lung is anatomically similar to the human lung) and rats. While intraalveolar deposition of particles is the most common feature in rats, NAU et al. (1962 NAU et al. ( , 1976 observed only a few carbon black particles in the alveoli of monkeys exposed to carbon black by inhalation for years. Pigmented macrophages were rare. The great majority of carbon black particles was located in the peribronchial or perivascular interstitial tissue as free particles or phagocytized by macrophages. No neoplasms were found in the animals. In a lO-months inhalation study with manganese dioxide dust on rhesus monkeys, particles were also found in alveoli but were predominantly located in peribronchial and perivascular interstitium (SUZUKI et al. 1978) . Low intraalveolar accumulation of particles in the lung of monkeys might result in a lower degree of direct injury of alveolar epithelium by particles in this species. Also the low degree of particle uptake by alveolar macrophages might result in decreased release of inflammatory mediators and reactive oxygen species by these cells. Both factors probably contribute to the chronic pulmonary inflammation observed in rats exposed to high burden of particles which is discussed as a cause of neoplastic transformation of lung cells in this species . In contrast to other rodent species (mice and hamsters) and man, particle deposition in the lung of rats is accompanied by a strong participation of polymorphonuclear leucocytes (which can release reactive oxygen species, with their mitogenic, cytotoxic and genotoxic effects) in the pulmonary response to particles (MUHLE et al. 1990; MUHLE et al. 1991; HEINRICH et al. 1986a; HEN-DERSON et al. 1988b; NATIONAL TOXICOLOGY PROGRAM 1993) . In the study of MAUDERLY et al. (1994) , cells in control rats harvested by lung lavage consisted predominantly of macrophages (97 %-99 %) with few polymorphonuclear leucocytes. In rats exposed to diesel exhaust or carbon black particles the proportion of macrophages decreased to 35 %-50 % and polymorphonuclear leucocytes increased to 50 %-65 % of the whole number of cells counted. In contrast, in humans that suffer chronic exposure to high concentrations of particles at their working place, only few polymorphonuclear leucocytes are involved in the lung reaction to particles. ROM et al. (1987) found in the lung lavage fluid of workers with asbestosis, pneumoconiosis or silicosis predominantly macrophages, while the portion of polymorphonuclear leucocytes was only 3 %-4 %. SABLONNIERE et al. (1983) found polymorphonuclear leucocytes only in the lung of six of 16 miners, but the portion of these cells was very low (0.68 %). The results of these studies reveal, that polymorphonuclear leucocytes not seem to be a significant part of the pulmonary response to particles in humans.",

In a comparative study on B6C3F 1 mice and F344 rats, HENDERSON et al. (1988a) showed that rats have higher levels of leucotriene (LTB 4)' prostaglandin (PGE 2 ) and thromboxane (TXB 2 ) in the normal lung and that the increase of these substances in pulmonary lavage fluid is much higher in rats than in mice after inhalation of diesel exhaust particles (3.5 mg/m 3 ). Additionally, it could be demonstrated that defence mechanisms against cell damage by reactive oxygen species released by macrophages and polymorphonuclear leucocytes in rats are not as effective as in other species (OBER-DORSTER et al. 1994; Slade et al. 1985) . In rats exposed to diesel exhaust, lower amounts of glutathione were found in lung and lung lavage fluid than in mice, and a cadmium inhalation induced increase of methallothionin seen in mice was missing in rats (OBERDORSTER et al. 1994) . In a comparative study on the concentration of the antioxidants ascorbic acid, a-tocopherole and glutatione in the lung, rats had the lowest levels of a-tocopherole and glutathione of all laboratory animal species examined (SLADE et al. 1985) .",

Whether modified extrapolation is appropriate is unclear because the extent of differences in particle response of rats and humans has not been yet fully explored. Further studies along these lines are therefore necessary to prove the relevance of rat studies for human risk assessment. Several types of neoplasms occurring in carcinogenicity studies in rats have not been accorded significance for risk assessment in humans because of their rat specific mechanisms of induction. Examples of these kind of tumours include renal tumours in male rats with a2!l-globulin nephropathy following exposure to a variety of chemicals like isophorone, paradi-chlorobenzene, and pentachloroethane, mesovarian leiomyomas induces by ~2 receptor stimulants and carcinoid tumours in the stomach induced by prolonged suppression of acid secretion with H2 antagonists and proton pump inhibitors (ALISON et al. 1994) . For cystic keratinizing neoplasms further studies on the mechanisms of tumour induction are necessary to determine whether these tumours truly belong to the group of rat neoplasms with no significance to man.",
