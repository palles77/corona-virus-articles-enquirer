This descriptive study, which was conducted from May to June 2003, intended to identify staff stress and coping strategies among a SARS team of nursing staff during the outbreak. Method: Twenty-six female nurses of the SARS team completed a questionnaire about their experiences serving in the SARS team. Results: SARS had both positive and negative psychological impacts on the nurses. While worrying about infecting their families and colleagues, nurses were able to cope with the situation through various means. Additional findings include the need for more psychiatric staff to provide flexible and continuous service, the importance of meetings to improve teamwork and reduce conflict between doctors and nurses and the useful discovery that video cell phones provided needed reassurance from afar to the worried families of the nurses. Conclusion: This study reinforces the importance and benefits of psychiatric services for SARS team members in reducing their secondary traumatization. It is hoped that the results will enhance our knowledge on the needs of frontline health care workers and support the planning of better psychiatric services in future epidemics. D",

During the same period, there were 346 reported probable SARS cases in Taiwan, resulting in 37 deaths directly due to SARS and 36 related to SARS [1, 2] . Among the 346 cases, 105 were medical staff, including 12 doctors, 56 nurses and 37 allied workers; 7 died of the epidemic. SARS was an unknown and dangerous disease that our country had not previously faced. The epidemic began in northern Taiwan and soon spread to southern areas. An ad hoc committee was immediately set up by the central government to coordinate and oversee the prevention and control of the disease. In an effort to control the outbreak, two hospitals, two department stores and two hotels were temporarily shut down. Other four hospitals had to partially close their emergency departments or certain floors and one neighborhood in Taipei was placed under quarantine.",

To address this, meetings of doctors and nurses should be held frequently so that their shared tasks can be identified, conflicts reduced and teamwork strengthened.
