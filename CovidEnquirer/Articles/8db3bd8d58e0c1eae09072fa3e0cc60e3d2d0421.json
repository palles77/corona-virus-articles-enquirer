            "text": "As part of the routine neurological examination, the clinician should evaluate mentation (or 'sensorium'; ie, state of consciousness and awareness), gait and posture, postural reactions, spinal nerve reflexes and muscle tone, and the cranial nerves (Table 2 ). In cats, the order in which these components of the neurological examination are performed is determined by the degree of patient cooperation. If the cat is resting quietly in its cage, it may be preferable to perform the cranial nerve examination first. If the cat is excited or apprehensive, it may be more practical to evaluate gait and postural reactions before performing the cranial nerve evaluation. \u271c Mentation The owner is the best judge of their cat's mentation and behavior. Change in mentation typically is due to brainstem or cerebral lesions in the ascending reticular activating system and/or limbic system. Unless peracute (eg, feline ischemic encephalopathy/CNS cuterebriasis), prosencephalic (cerebrothalamic) disturbances do not cause weakness. Therefore, a tetraparetic cat that is dull, stuporose or comatose is more likely to have a mid-to caudal brainstem lesion than a cerebrothalamic lesion. \u271c Gait and posture The cat's gait should be evaluated on a non-slippery surface, assess-ing carefully for strength and coordination. The cat's posture should be assessed while both standing and walking (Fig 1) . Key postural changes that may be present in the weak cat involve the position of the head and neck, angle of the hock, and tail position; trembling may also be present. \u271c Spinal nerve reflexes and muscle tone The most reliable spinal nerve reflexes are the withdrawal flexor reflexes of the thoracic and pelvic limbs, and the patellar reflex of the pelvic limbs. As described elsewhere in this special issue, reflexes require functional peripheral nerve(s) innervating a specific muscle group (eg, femoral nerve for patellar reflex of the quadriceps muscle) and the spinal cord segments (eg, L4-L6 for femoral nerve) with which the peripheral nerve(s) connect. 1 In cats with neuromuscular paresis caused by lesions of the LMN system, spinal nerve reflexes and muscle tone typically are reduced to absent. With UMN paresis caused by lesions cranial to the intumescences, the spinal nerve reflexes and muscle tone typically are normal to exaggerated. \u271c Postural reactions In addition to requiring normal peripheral nerve(s) (sensory and LMN), postural reactions depend on ascending pathways in the spinal cord that deliver sensory information to the brainstem, cerebellum and cerebrum, and descending UMN pathways that terminate on the spinal cord intumescences (ie, spinal cord segments C6-T2 and L4-S3). Therefore, postural reactions test the integrity of almost the entire peripheral nervous system and CNS. In the authors' experience, hopping and placing responses are the most useful postural reactions in cats to reveal subtle abnormalities in strength and proprioception. When interpreted outside the context of the neurological examination as a whole, postural reactions are of limited value for lesion localization. However, they may provide key localizing information when considered in the light of the entire examination.",

The axons from these UMNs descend the spinal cord to facilitate the LMNs responsible for the voluntary and reflexive movements of the limbs. Loss of this facilitation leads to UMN paresis. Typically, a state of 'disinhibition' predominates with lesions that interrupt the descending UMN. Clinically, this is evident as exaggerated muscle tone and spinal reflexes, and a spastic gait in the ambulatory patient. Lesions in the LMN/neuromuscular unit (cell body, peripheral nerve, neuromuscular junction or muscle) lead to reduced muscle tone and spinal reflexes, and a short-strided gait in the ambulatory patient. Mid-to caudal brainstem and spinal cord lesions disrupting the UMN pathways may result in considerable variability in a cat's ability to generate a gait.

Exaggerated spinal reflexes, general proprioceptive ataxia of the pelvic limbs, cervical pain and decreased cervical range of motion can be seen. Along with the cervical cell bodies, neurons in other parts of the CNS may also be affected. Other signs such as lameness, facial deformities, corneal clouding and bone dysplasia may be present.",

With MPS VI, neurological signs commonly localize to the thoracolumbar spinal column. 18 Tetanus Tetanus is relatively uncommon in the cat. 19 It is not associated with lesions of the UMN, but is included here because of the hypertonicity associated with the condition. Clostridium tetani is a Gram-positive anerobe that is most commonly introduced into the patient via a skin wound. After inoculation, the bacterium produces numerous toxins, in particular tetanospasmin, which affects interneurons (Renshaw cells) in the spinal cord responsible for extensor motor neuron inhibition. More specifically, tetanospasmin blocks pre-synaptic glycine vesicle release from the Renshaw cell (glycine is a normal inhibitory neurotransmitter in the spinal cord), thereby causing extensor rigidity. Depending on toxin load, signs of tetanus may be focal (eg, affecting a single limb) or generalized (affecting multiple limbs and the head).",

The causative agent of rabies is a rhabdovirus, of the genus Lyssavirus, that may infect any domestic or wild cat. 22 After inoculation, the rabies virus replicates in skeletal muscle, and then moves centripetally from the motor end plates to the peripheral nerves, and from there to the CNS. The virus subsequently travels centrifugally to other parts of the CNS or peripheral nervous system, including the neuromuscular junction, and replicates and concentrates in the salivary glands (permitting transmission by a bite). While a LMN syndrome is common, clinical signs may be profoundly variable. \u271c An accurate neuroanatomic diagnosis allows the clinician to formulate an appropriate differential diagnosis, perform the correct diagnostics, prognosticate, and ultimately to develop a therapeutic plan.",
