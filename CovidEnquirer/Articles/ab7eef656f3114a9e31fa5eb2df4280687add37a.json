Although much has been learned from previous events the evidence for mitigating actions is not defi nitive and pandemic preparedness remains a political and scientifi c challenge. A need exists to develop trust and eff ective meaningful collaboration between countries to help with rapid detection of potential pandemic infections and initiate public health actions. This collaboration should be within the framework of the International Health Regulations. Collaboration between countries should be encouraged in a way that acknowledges the benefi ts that derive from sharing biological material and establishing equitable collaborative research partnerships. The focus of pandemic preparedness should include upstream prevention through better collaboration between human and animal health sciences to enhance capacity to identify potential pathogens before they become serious human threats, and to prevent their emergence where possible. The one-health approach provides a means to develop this and could potentially enhance alignment of global health and trade priorities.",

            "text": "Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) are broadly defi ned as infections that have newly appeared in a population or have existed but are rapidly increasing in incidence or geographical range. 1 EIDs encompass: recognised infec tions spreading to new areas and populations; discovery that a known disease is caused by infection; previously unrecognised infection appearing in areas where habitat is changing; a new infection resulting from changes in microorganisms; and an old infection re-emerging because it has become resistant to treatment, or due to a breakdown in public health systems. 2 Pandemics have had a chequered history when it comes to a concise defi nition on which to base action. The classic defi nition is \"an epidemic occurring worldwide, or over a very wide area, crossing international boundaries and usually aff ecting a large number of people\". Although useful as an academic method to explain the concept of pandemics, this defi nition has proved problematic when applied without suffi cient consideration to other factors such as population immunity and disease severity. [3] [4] [5] This century has seen several global and potentially global pandemics of emerging and new infectious diseases aff ecting the respiratory tract (fi gure 1) that have illustrated the complex interrelationships between animal and human hosts, the microorganism, and the environmental factors that aff ect exposure or transmission. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] EIDs, which include pandemic infl uenza outbreaks, have risen substantially over time and are dominated by zoonoses (60%) of which most (72%) originate in wildlife. 12 Emergence occurs at the human-animal interface, when animal infections breach species barriers to infect human beings, the population in which they are often fi rst identifi ed. In many instances identifi cation occurs many years after the breach. 12 During the past 40 years, EIDs that have been identifi ed range from Ebola and Marburg haemorrhagic fevers to AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), infl uenza A H5N1, paramyxovirus infections (Hendra and Nipah viruses), variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob \u2022 Emerging infectious diseases (EIDs) with pandemic potential are a major worldwide threat to global health security. \u2022 Most new infectious diseases outbreaks with pandemic potential have been of zoonotic origin. \u2022 A spectrum of EIDs has occurred in the past 40 years, ranging from Ebola and Marburg haemorrhagic fevers, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), infl uenza A (H5N1), verocytotoxin-producing Escherichia coli O157 to the recently discovered Middle East respiratory syndrome coronovirus (MERS-CoV). \u2022 EIDs are estimated to have caused hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of damage in the last 20 years; between 1997 and 2009 this cost amounted to US$80 billion. \u2022 The phases of pandemics have been simplifi ed to four from the six described previously-these are now uncoupled from action at the country level with member states retaining responsibility for their own national risk management plans. \u2022 This approach includes an Emergency Risk Management for Health Framework.",

Infl uenza virus's great versatility, persistence, and potentially rapid spread and severity means that optimising global mechanisms to respond to it will always be a work in progress. 16 WHO has published interim guidance on pandemic infl uenza risk management that describes pandemic phases along a continuum according to a global average of cases over time, based on continued risk assessment and consistent with actions linked to a broader emergency risk management framework (fi gure 2). 17 The new guidance builds on recommendations stemming from a WHO review of the coordinated response to the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, 4, 16, 17 and substantial changes have been made to the pandemic preparedness plan (the panel shows a summary of the guidance). 17 There is a new approach to the global phases of pandemics: simplifi ed to four phases, these are now uncoupled from action at the country level with an emphasis on providing guidance and Member States retaining responsibility and fl exibility for their own national risk management plans. The plan now recommends adopting an allhazards approach using the Emergency Risk Management for Health Framework (ERM-H) and embedding aspects of planning at every level of society including key aspects of determining pandemic infl uenza risk (ie, transmissibility, severity of disease, and likely eff ect in national action plans). The development of the Pandemic Infl uenza Preparedness (PIP) Framework for the sharing of infl uenza viruses and access to vaccines and other benefi ts brings together WHO Member States, WHO, industry, and other stakeholders to improve and strengthen the sharing of infl uenza viruses with human pandemic potential, and achieve more predictable, effi cient, and equitable access for countries needing vaccines and medicines during future pandemics; the framework therefore recognises that there is an ethical dimension to pandemic planning. 18",

            "text": "Pandemic infl uenza planning (and planning for EIDs) is based on a combination of scientifi c, economic, and political drivers. In economic terms, EIDs are estimated to have caused hundreds of billions of dollars' worth of damage in the last 20 years. 28 A 2012 World Bank study detailing economic factors about emerging infection control estimated that economic losses from the six major outbreaks of EIDs between 1997 and 2009 for which good cost information was available amounted to at least US$80 billion. These included Nipah virus, West Nile fever, SARS, highly pathogenic avian infl uenza, BSE, and Rift Valley fever (fi gure 3). 29 Costs in controlling future infl uenza pandemics and other large EID outbreaks will probably continue to rise. The UK spent an estimated $1\u00b78 billion on the 2009 H1N1 infl uenza pandemic including an estimated $675 million on stockpiling oseltamivir and zanamivir as prophylaxis and treatment (the USA spent an estimated $1\u00b73 billion on stockpiling for the same reason). 24, 30 The recent systematic review published by the Cochrane Collaboration that showed the eff ectiveness of both drugs in preventing and treating infl uenza in healthy adults and children has not been proven raises serious concerns on the cost-eff ectiveness of national stockpiling strategies as part of a pandemic preparedness plan. 30 However, this evidence will need to be interpreted pragmatically from a political perspective if there are no alternative mitigation strategies available. Rationalising prevention and control strategies across disease areas and an all-hazards approach to pandemic preparedness could become increasingly necessary as the strain of burgeoning costs aff ect all areas of health care and delivery. 17 In recent years, the principles of equity, justice, and benefi cence have also emerged as key issues for pandemic planning, to ensure that countries benefi t from the sharing of clinical samples 18 and the ethics of research in emerging diseases. 31 Three seminal events are important in understanding how well we are prepared for the next newly emerging infection with pandemic potential: March 2003-the start of the outbreak that had the potential to become pandemic-SARS; April 2009-the start of the outbreak that became a pandemic-H1N1; September 2012-the start of the pandemic that might never be-MERS-CoV. Each of these events built on lessons identifi ed from previous experiences, each showed how we can incrementally improve global public health responses, but each also showed failures to learn and improve.",

            "text": "There is an urgent need to build trust between countries and between public health authorities to ensure maximum cooperation and transparency. In the past 10 years there have been important global incidents that emphasise the tension between countries and international organisations when commercial and political interests are perceived to have an undue eff ect on global pandemic preparedness policy. 4, 16 This eff ect is further exacerbated when inequity in access to tech nology, expertise, and the best diagnostic, prophylactic, and treatment methods are prevalent. An example is Indonesia's refusal in 2006-07 to share samples of infl uenza H5N1 isolates with WHO in direct protest to the inequitable sharing of virus samples and vaccine development technology. 43 Lack of trust in WHO's response was evident following the H1N1 pandemic in 2009 too, including from the Council of Europe which highlighted potential confl icts of interest of individual members of the emergency committee convened by WHO to respond to the pandemic-linking them to industry, and noting WHO's policy on keeping the membership of the committee secret. Substantial shortfalls and delay in distribution of vaccine supplies to low-income and middle-income countries were also emphasised by subsequent reviews of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic response. 4, 16, 45 The Indonesian Government's call for more equity and developments since the H1N1 2009 pandemic have led to several positive initiatives. 46 Within WHO's PIP Framework, discussions have evolved to improve virus sharing in the context of recognising the need for shared benefi ts. Indonesia is now one of several low-to-middle income countries that are developing or have already developed in-country vaccine manufacturing capacityothers in the WHO-supported programme of technology transfer include Brazil, China, Egypt, India, Kazakhstan, Mexico, South Korea, Romania, Serbia, South Africa, Thailand, and Vietnam. Initiatives such as the creation of a technology transfer programme at the Netherlands Vaccine Institute (RIVM) to provide training in the embryonated egg production of inactivated infl uenza vaccine are helping to achieve this aim. 47, 48 There are still barriers to eff ective international cooperation and benefi t sharing despite the number of reports emphasising the importance of this key facet of pandemic preparedness. Substantial agreement exists across the public health community about how global collaboration should work, there is greater political acceptance of the value of such collaboration, but there are still barriers arising from commercial and academic drivers. China, with its direct experience of SARS and the economic and political consequences of not being ready to respond, has shown a good example by facing the economic challenges of H7N9. 31 The experience of Saudi Arabia with MERS-CoV highlights other barriers, such as ineff ective international collaboration and partnerships. 44 Despite a declared willingness to collaborate and share, and the publication of substantial epidemiological and microbiological information about early coronavirus cases and outbreaks, there appeared to be delays at times Series in sharing information between public health authorities before it was accepted for peer-reviewed publication, and in sharing clinical and viral samples for public health use without prejudice to subsequent commercial development of products derived from that material. Confl icts of interest that are barriers to trust will probably continue as long as academic and research organisations are judged primarily by their publication record or there is an associated commercial imperative. An urgent need exists for suffi cient global public health capacity that is free from these constraints to allow free and rapid sharing of information and samples. Politicians are beginning to understand the importance of tackling these issues. The Global Health Security Action Group (GHSAG) has initiated work to develop sample sharing protocols and arrangements that build on the WHO PIP Framework but that move on from infl uenza viruses to include any organism that might lead to a public health emergency of international concern (PHEIC under the IHRs). The GHSAG initiative is initially intended to focus on sample sharing between the countries in the GHSAG but it will be open to other countries to use the GHSAG-agreed protocols for sharing, and these protocols should encourage and help with sharing without compromising the commercial rights of the sending countries and without prejudicing future benefi t sharing. 49 Specifi c capacity building activity could help to increase trust and engender a true spirit of global cooperation. The positive global experience gained from the development of the Supranational Reference Laboratory (SRL) Network for the surveillance of multidrug-resistant tuberculosis under the Stop TB partnership could serve as a template for the development of a more integrated global laboratory surveillance, diagnostic, and vaccine development and manufacture network working across a series of high priority EID pathogens. 50 The eventual aim of such an initiative would be to ensure that suffi cient numbers of biosafety level-3 (BSL-3) and BSL-3 (adapted for animals) reference laboratories exist in every WHO region to serve the needs of its member countries and peoples. 51 Benefi ts of a global network would include a greater capacity of regions to respond to local and international EID threats more quickly and effi ciently, and, importantly, to retain human resources and expertise within those regions. The latter could have an additional benefi t in aiding eff orts to curtail the brain drain of scientists and technical experts from low-to-middle income countries to more developed regions of the world.",

Initial recommendations for control are therefore, out of necessity, precautionary-based on evidence from past and present outbreaks that have similar epidemiological patterns, and for which the cause is known-and these precautionary measures can cause severe negative economic eff ects. Although modern methods such as genetic sequencing off er solutions for the identifi cation of potential pathogens, predicting their emergence and their behaviour in human populations is still very diffi cult. A better understanding of the prevailing disease ecology and investigations into the dynamics of infectious agents in wildlife could act as a better means of preventing outbreaks in livestock and people at source. 54 Global eff orts to control EIDs might be better served by directing greater attention and resources to prevention of emergence at the source by learning from past emergence events and by understanding and mitigating the factors, or determinants, that aff ect animal infection. These determinants include human-induced changes in natural environments, urban areas, and agricultural systems; raising and processing animal-based foods; and the roles of worldwide trade, migration, and climate change. Many evidence-based policies encounter political barriers, especially when commercial benefi ts are at stake. With agriculture, primarily a profi t-driven industry, prevention and mitigation strategies that are most easily accepted voluntarily are those that are cost eff ective and have no negative eff ect on profi t. For more costly policy options, enforceable legislation might be Series the only way they can be implemented. Interventions and strategies that are cost eff ective for the animal industry (and associated sectors such as trade, commerce, and the environment) will have a better chance of being accepted than others. 29,53,54",

This approach to preventing and mitigating the eff ects of emerging infections, and zoonoses such as infl uenza, aims to address potential or existing risks that begin at the animal-human-ecosystems interface. There is broadbased consensus on this approach and many national governments, international agencies, and global organisations are collaborating to implement the aims of one health. 55, 56 Global organisations formally endorsing the onehealth approach include WHO, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the UN, World Organization for Animal Health (OIE), UN System Infl uenza Coordination (UNSIC), and the World Bank. Additionally, the European Commission and the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), the US Agency for International Development, the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, and the Wellcome Trust now support a wide range of research-related eff orts in the one-health arena. 56,57 WHO, OIE, and FAO have created the Global Early Warning System (GLEWS), a platform shared by the three organisations to improve early warning and risk assessment on zoonoses and EIDs worldwide. 58 A strategic alignment between the three organisations, the tripartite agreement, has been evolving over the past decade. It was originally conceived with a principal aim to develop a coordinated approach with shared responsibilities to contain the emergence and spread of human and animal diseases. In recent years this has expanded to include other non-disease-specifi c collaborations, including antimicrobial resistance arising from human and non-human use of antimicrobials. With the development of the Global Early Warning System and the possibility for further integration of harmonised surveillance, alert, and response systems across disease areas, the potential exists to further improve worldwide pandemic preparedness plans through this agreement. The FAO and OIE have already developed a joint Network of Expertise on Animal Infl uenza (OFFLU) to support international eff orts to monitor and control infections of avian infl uenza.",

If they are not shown to be cost eff ective, newer technologies must be developed that are. Clearly any policy or strategy that is developed needs careful risk assessment to ensure that low-income countries do not suff er from unfair trade restrictions, and that development, food prices, or food availability are not compromised. A careful balance must be struck between positive measures (access to increased funding) and negative measures (increased regulation). The World Bank estimates that the annual funding needed for 60 low-income and 79 middle-income countries to bring their animal infection prevention and control systems up to OIE and WHO standards ranges from $1\u00b79 billion to $3\u00b74 billion. 29, 61 To broaden the funding base outside the traditional donor base for one-health research and improve control strategies at the animal-human interface, high-income countries that are large livestock and poultry importers and exporters should be encouraged to contribute more to these eff orts. Although much of the work on global pandemic preparedness has focused on infl uenza viruses, there are parallels and lessons to be learned from global responses to other zoonotic viral infections that have spread in recent years outside their geographical zones as illustrated by Rift Valley fever. 62 Following the outbreak of Rift Valley fever, an arthropod-borne zoonotic EID in Saudi Arabia in 2000the fi rst such occurrence outside of Africa-there was a ban on imports of live animals from Somalia until 2009. The ban was only partly eff ective with animals from Somalia crossing to Saudi Arabia through other intermediate countries. Upgrading of port quarantine and livestock export facilities at Bossasso and Berbera, through Saudi investment in ensuing years, however, ensured that Somalia was able to export animals to more countries and gave importing countries the reassurance that animals being purchased were disease free and operations were in compliance with international OIE standards. This bilateral agreement benefi ted both countries in trade, human, and animal health terms and could be a template for other one-health initiatives. 63 Wealthy Gulf Arab states are bilaterally supporting the development of other agricultural and livestock systems in low-income countries as a way to strengthen food security and an opportunity exists to incorporate control programmes for EIDs, such as infl uenza and corona viruses, in that process. 64 The one-health approach to EID control potentially aligns national, global, and health and trade priorities.",
