However, its clinical role and pathogenicity has not been known. Objectives: To confirm that WU polyomavirus has been found in Chinese children. Study design: WU polyomavirus was detected and identified using PCR methods. A total of 278 specimens of nasopharyngeal aspirate were collected, and then PCR products were sequenced directly. Results: One of 278 nasopharyngeal aspirates was positive for WUPyV in one child, and the positive rate was 0.4%. The results showed that the sequences of genome, LTAg and VP2 gene was identical to the reference sequences of WU polyomavirus prototype strains. Conclusions: We confirmed that WU polyomavirus had been found and identified in the respiratory secretions in China.",

            "text": "Viral infections are a major cause of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children. Acute respiratory infection (ARI) is responsible for illness and death worldwide (Mulholland, 2003) . Although ARI is the third most common cause of death overall, an estimated 2 million deaths occur in children <5 years of age, predominantly in developing countries (Bryce et al., 2005) . Among these, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is the most important, both in terms of prevalence and effect (Shay et al., 2001) . However, in recent years, several new viruses have emerged. These include human metapneumovirus (Van den Hoogen et al., 2001) respiratory syndrome coronavirus (Peiris et al., 2003) , coronaviruses HKU1 (Sloots et al., 2005) , coronaviruses NL63 ( Van der Hoek et al., 2004) , and the recently described human bocavirus (Allander et al., 2005) and KI virus (Allander et al., 2007) . Viruses in the family Polyomaviridae possess double stranded DNA genomes and infect a variety of avian, rodent, and primate species (Gaynor et al., 2007) . The JC virus and BK virus of two polyomaviruses, which often produce asymptomatic infections, have been distinctly described as human pathogens. Then the seroprevalence rates of BK and JC viruses had approached 75% and 100%, respectively (Stolt et al., 2003) . Virus belonging to the family Polyomaviridae could become oncogenic or induce disease in immunocompromised patients usually. Gaynor et al. (2007) discovered a previously unidentified human polyomavirus in respiratory secretions obtained from individuals with clinical features of respiratory tract illness. This new virus was designated \"WU polyomavirus\" (WUPyV). This virus has now been identified in respiratory specimens from children with upper and lower respiratory tract infections (LRTI) from Australia (Gaynor et al., 2007) , the United States of America (Gaynor et al., 2007) , and South Korea (Han et al., 2007) . The prevalence of WUPyV among children with respiratory disease reported in these studies ranges from 0.7% to 7.0%. However, the causal role of WUPyV in LRTI and the epidemiology of WUPyV infections had not been known. In this study, we utilized PCR assays described by Gaynor et al. (2007) targeting the WUPyV VP2 (capsid proteins 2) gene and LTAg (large T antigen) gene to detect the DNA of WU polyomavirus from nasopharyngeal ",

The study population consisted of children \u22645 years old with acute LRTIs (median age of patients = 3 years). Respiratory symptom and signs were recorded on a standardized form during the emergency department visit or while the patient was hospitalized. The RNA and blood samples were originally screened for nucleic acid and antibodies by using RT-PCR and an indirect immunofluorescence assay as described (Lin et al., 2007) . DNA from each respiratory specimen was extracted by use of QIAamp nucleic acid purification kits (Qiagen), according to the manufacturer's protocol, and detected for WUPyV, human bocavirus and KI virus.",

EF444549). PCR mixture contained (50 L) 1\u00d7 PCR buffer (TaKaRa), 200 mol/L dNTPs, target template was 2 L, 1 U Taq DNA polymerase (TaKaRa). PCR conditions were used as follows: 1 cycle of 94 \u2022 C for 5 min; 40 cycles of 94 \u2022 C for 30 s, 56 \u2022 C for 30 s, 72 \u2022 C for 30 s; and a final extension of 72 \u2022 C for 5 min; cool down to 4 \u2022 C forever. PCR conditions for genome DNA of WUPyV were used as follows: 1 cycle of 94 \u2022 C for 5 min; 35 cycles of 94 \u2022 C for 1 min, 50 \u2022 C for 1 min, 72 \u2022 C for 1 min; and a final extension of 72 \u2022 C for 10 min. All PCR products were purified on a 1% agarose gel and cloned into pGEM-T vector (Promega), and sequenced using the T7 and SP6 primers on a DEQ 2000XL autoanalyzer (Applied Biosystems).",

The results showed that the sequences obtained from this study were identical to above reference sequences (Figs. 1 and 2). Our VP2 and LTAg sequence shared 100% nucleotide and amino acid identity with the WUPyV prototype strains B0, S1 and S2. Furthermore, the VP2 gene of WUPyV was deposited in Gen-Bank with Sequin, named WU polyomavirus-CLFF-VP2. The GenBank accession number was EU277015. Furthermore, the genome of WUPyV had been deposited in GenBank with Sequin under accession number EU296475, named WU polyomavirus-CLFF. When we aligned the sequence of CLFF with WUPyV prototype strains B0, S1 and S2, the results illustrated that CLFF shared 99.9% nucleotide and amino acid identity with prototype strains. The above result showed that the sequence of WU polyomavirus-CLFF was identical to above reference sequences of prototype strains (Fig. 3) .",

The positive rate obtained from this paper was in accordance with the values of 0.7%, obtained from United States of America, reported by Gaynor et al. (2007) , and lower than the values of 7.0% of Han et al. (2007) and the values of 3.0%, obtained from Gaynor et al. (2007) . However, the clinical role and pathogenicity of WUPyV were still unclear. We confirmed that the sequence of VP2 gene, LTAg gene and genome of CLFF were similar to WUPyV prototype strains B0, S1 and S2. Finally further studies should be investigated in order for the role of WUPyV in LRTI in children.",
