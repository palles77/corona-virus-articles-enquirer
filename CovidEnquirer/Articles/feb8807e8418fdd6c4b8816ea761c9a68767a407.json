Homologous recombination events were detected in Xf and were suspected 47 to be associated with host-shift, as documented for the subspecies morus (Nunney et al., 2014). But 48 intrasubspecific homologous recombination events could be more frequent than intersubspecific events 49 (Potnis et al., 2019).Based on genome sequence analyses, it was proposed to merge the subspecies 50 fastidiosa, morus and sandyi in the subspecies fastidiosa (hereafter referred to Xff sensu lato (Xffsl) to 51 avoid confusion with classical Xff), the subspecies multiplex and pauca remaining coherent groups and 52 distantly related from Xff (Marcelletti and Scortichini, 2016; Denanc\u00e9 et al., 2019). The method 53 generally used to identify strains at the subspecies level is based on the sequencing of seven 54 housekeeping genes (cysG, gltT, holC, leuA, malF, nuoL and petC) of the dedicated MultiLocus 55 Sequence Typing (MLST) scheme (Yuan et al., 2010). 56 In Europe, Xf has been reported for the first time in Apulia area, Italy, in olive trees (Saponari et al., 57 2013). Then, Xf was detected in 2015 in France, more precisely in Corsica and in the French Riviera 58 region, mainly on Polygala myrtifolia and other ornamentals (Denanc\u00e9 et al., 2017). Two years later, 59 Xf has been reported in the Balearic Islands mostly in olive tree, grapevine and sweet cherry and in 60 continental Spain in almond trees (Landa, 2017). More recently, in October 2018, the presence of 61 X. fastidiosa subsp. multiplex was reported in Monte Argentario (Tuscany, Italy), and in January 2019 62 the subsp. multiplex was identified in Portugal (region of Porto), and both reports concerned 63 ornamentals (EPPO, 2019). Since the first report, four subspecies, fastidiosa, multiplex, pauca and 64 sandyi have been identified in Europe (Jacques et al., 2016; Denanc\u00e9 et al., 2017; Cruaud et al., 2018). 65 A number of cases of imported plants being infected by Xf has also been reported in Europe since 2012 66 (EPPO, 2019). Being present in Europe, Xf was first listed as an A1 regulated pathogen. Xf is now 67 reported in the Annex I/A2 of the directive 2000/29/CE and in the EPPO A2 list (C/2017/4883, 2017; 68 EPPO, 2018a). 69 Apart the sympatry of several subspecies at the local, regional or state level, cases of mix infection of 70 plants have been described. In 2005 in California, an almond tree has been reported infected by two 71 types of Xf strains, revealing the first case of mix infection by Xf (Chen et al., 2005). Recently, in coffee 72 trees imported into Europe from Central America, the MLST revealed a mix infection with two 73 different sequence types (STs) of Xf from two subspecies: pauca and fastidiosa (Bergsma-Vlami et al., 74 2017). In France, a Polygala myrtifolia plant was found mix infected with strains of two different STs 75 (Denanc\u00e9 et al., 2017). Reported cases of undetermined sequences of housekeeping gene alleles was 76 an indication of mix infections in plants (Denanc\u00e9 et al., 2017). 77 in planta identification of Xylella fastidiosa subspecies 3 Because in Europe the subspecies identification is necessary to set up outbreak management, it is of 78 major interest to have access to reliable tools for the detection and identification of Xf. As Xf isolation 79 is tedious, detection and identification of subspecies are performed directly on plant extracts (Denanc\u00e9 80 et al., 2017). To date, tests based on loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) (Harper et al., 81 2010), conventional PCR (Minsavage et al., 1994; Hernandez-Martinez et al., 2006), and quantitative 82 PCR (qPCR) (Francis et al., 2006; Harper et al., 2010; Li et al., 2013; Ouyang et al., 2013) targeting 83",

These combinations target single-copy genes 387 encoding proteins involved in bacterial metabolism. This is the case for the XF primers and probe 388 targeting a gene encoding a ketol-acid reductoisomerase, an enzyme essential in the biosynthesis 389 pathway of the L-isoleucine and L-valine; XFF primers and probe target a gene encoding a restriction 390 modification system DNA specificity, involved in defense against foreign DNA (Wilson and Murray, 391 1991); XFM primers and probe target a gene coding a DNA methyltransferase; XFMO primers and 392 probe target a gene coding an S24 peptidase involved in a stress-response against DNA lesions and 393 leading to the repair of single-stranded DNA (Erill et al., 2007); XFP primers and probe target a gene 394 coding a histidine kinase and an ABC transporter substrate, two membrane proteins involved in signal 395 transduction across the cellular membrane (Yoshida et al., 2007; Tanaka et al., 2018).
