The second, immunologically closely related to FECV, is capable of going systemic by infecting monocytes and macrophages and causing FIP.

Moreover, new techniques such as RT-PCR could demonstrate the presence of FCoV in the blood of healthy cats (Addie et al., 1996; Egberink et al., 1995; Fehr et al., 1996; Foley et al., 1997; Gunn-Moore et al., 1998; Kipar et al., 1999) . These observations support the hypothesis that viraemia is not a hallmark of FIP-inducing FCoVs and that a carrier state exists where cats remain healthy despite being systemically infected. Persistently infected, healthy cats are believed to play the most important epidemiological role in FIP, because they represent a constant source of infection by shedding FCoV in their faeces (Foley et al., 1997) .",

Type II viruses, however, arise from recombinations between feline and canine (CCV) coronavirus (Herrewegh et al., 1998) . These proliferate well in cell culture and are widely used for the study of FCoV infection. However, in the field, serotype II accounts for only 20 to 30% of all FCoV infections at least in Japan (Hohdatsu et al., 1992) .

Experimental infections showed that, regardless of the strain used, kittens can be infected and that faecal shedding is detectable as early as 2 days p.i. However, shedding at day 2 p.i. was observed mainly in those kittens that had received a high infectious dose (P10 6 FCoV RNA copies; cats in group 2 [infection experiment I] and cats of infection experiment II and III). In kittens of groups 1 and 3 (infection experiment I) that had received a lower FCoV dose (#10 5 FCoV RNA copies), shedding did not start until 2 to 3 days after re-infection with a second low-dose inoculum. From these observations it is concluded that shedding is somehow dependent on the force of infection, i.e. there seems to be a threshold dose of virus that allows the infection to manifest. The time span until seroconversion was not affected by early shedding.",

All these animals seroconverted and most developed circulating FCoV-specific immune complexes, supporting the fact that the occurrence of FCoV immune complexes is not restricted to the development of FIP (Kipar et al., 1999) . In seven out of the eight cats examined, FCoV shedding was demonstrated at the time of necropsy. This confirms previous findings that healthy infected cats are frequently shedding virus (Foley et al., 1997; Harpold et al., 1999) . Furthermore, there is a strong correlation between shedding frequency and FCoV antibody titre (Gut, 1999) . Accordingly, we concluded that the high FCoV antibody titres observed in all eight animals represent a high FCoV load in all these cats (Gut, 1999) . In these naturally infected cats, 5 months after exposure to healthy FCoV-infected animals, blood monocytes were found to be positive for FCoV-RNA. Furthermore, at necropsy, monocytes were still positive in 75% of the cats. These findings are in accordance with other studies, which showed that FCoV-infected, healthy cats can maintain monocyte-associated viraemia for at least 12 months (Gunn-Moore et al., 1998) . They differ from the results obtained from our experimentally infected cats where FCoV-RNA was only detected in the monocytes of one animal. However, this is likely due to the lower sensitivity of the FCoV RT-PCR, performed on RNA directly isolated from peripheral blood monocytes. In comparison, monocytes of naturally infected cats in this study as well of naturally infected cats in a previous study had been cultivated prior to FCoV RT-PCR (Gunn-Moore et al., 1998) .",

            "text": "As FCoV could be detected in almost all organs tested from both experimental and naturally infected cats in the absence of any clinical signs and pathological findings, we concluded that development of FIP is not an imperative sequel of systemic spreading of FCoV. Originally, Pedersen and coworkers postulated that the apathogenic FCoV (designated FECV) remained restricted to the intestinal tract and that systemic infection would coincide with the development of FIP (Pedersen et al., 1981b) . However, our observations support the hypothesis that the key event triggering the development of FIP is not associated with the capability of an FCoV to cause viraemia and systemic infection. Although the observation period was not sufficiently long to see animals developing FIP, and we did not sequence the virus to detect mutations, these observations support the concept that FCoV mutants with increased virulence arise during replication (Kennedy et al., 2001; Vennema et al., 1998) . To further substantiate this hypothesis it would be important to determine if FCoV is replicating in the blood. A recently developed method to determine FCoV messenger RNA in peripheral blood mononuclear cells could address this question (Simons et al., 2002) .",
