Human behavior has contributed to exposure opportunities, examples of which include extreme adventure sports resulting in Listeria outbreaks and spelunking associated with histoplasmosis [2] . Air conditioning, a major technologic advancement, has led to outbreaks of legionnaires' disease. Environmental changes involving exposure to the tropical rain forest have resulted in new hemorrhagic fever viruses. Climate changes, including changes in temperature, rainfall, and vegetation, contribute to the emergence of infectious diseases [2] . International travel has facilitated the global transmission of diseases; an example is the introduction of an infected bird or person causing West Nile virus and SARS [3] . A simple, straightforward URI may represent a more complicated, lethal process. The nonspecific symptoms of a URI may represent a kaleidoscope of lethal disease entities.",

The history narrows the differential; if it includes recent travel, however, it may pose an unusual challenge to the physician. This challenge might include the identification of an exotic disease, recognition of precautions for infection control, and being in the forefront in establishing an epidemic [4] . Approximately 50 million people travel from the industrialized to the developing world each year, of which 1% to 5% become ill, and 1 in 100,000 die [5] . The development of a differential diagnosis must include the evaluation of the exposure, seasonal and geographic distribution, incubation period, identification of diseases with high mortality, and existence of preventive measures. The evaluation of the exposure includes a travel history with regard to modes of travel, insect exposure, accommodations, activities, animal exposure, and dietary patterns [4] . Risk factors are different for backpackers and executive tourists. The evaluation of preventive measures includes a history of vaccines or medical prophylaxis. Was the patient vaccinated for yellow fever? Was the patient compliant with preventive measures, and did he or she take the appropriate chemoprophylaxis for malaria? Determining an incubation period is essential in prioritizing the differential diagnosis. Malaria and typhoid may present months after exposure compared with dengue and rickettsial viral hemorrhagic fevers, which present within 21 days. Incubation periods are within a few days for most arboviruses.",

Malaria is caused by protozoa of the genus Plasmodium. There are four kinds of malaria that can affect humans: Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium ovale, and Plasmodium malariae. Malaria occurs in more than 100 countries. Endemic regions include Central and South America, Haiti, Dominican Republic, Africa, India, and Southwest Asia. The World Health Organization estimates an annual incidence of greater than 300,000 cases with a mortality of greater than 1 million [22] . Mortality is seen primarily in small children who have not developed immunity. The annual incidence is approximately 1200 cases in the United States [15] . P. falciparum causes most malaria deaths. It is prudent to maintain a high index of suspicion in any recent traveler with a fever because malaria is one of the most common causes and is missed frequently. It can be rapidly fatal and must be ruled out with peripheral thick and thin smears. Although malaria is found throughout the tropics, various countries are endemic to specific species. P. falciparum is the predominant species in Africa, with the presentation of symptoms usually developing within 1 month. In contrast, P. vivax is rare in Africa because Africans generally lack an antigen on the surface of the red blood cell (Duffy antigen) necessary for the parasite to penetrate [4] . P. vivax predominates in Asia and Latin America; symptoms develop within 1 month only 50% of the time [5] .",

The temperature may not be elevated at the time of presentation, although most patients report fevers at some point during their illness. This situation presents a diagnostic challenge and may account for one of the reasons why patients may make several visits to health care professionals before a diagnosis of malaria is considered [23] .
