Development of TGE-specific immune responses, as measured by blastogenic response of tissue lymphocytes, occurred at 3 days post-inoculation (DPI) in pigs held at 30\u00b0C, but not until 7 DPI in infected pigs held under the adverse conditions. Immunosuppression with corticosteroids resulted in a fall in circulatory T cells, lowering of non-specific blastogenic response of circulatory lymphocytes, and clinical signs of disease when immunosuppressed pigs were infected with TGE virus and held at 30\u00b0C. It is suggested that clinical responses to TGE virus infection may be affected by the influence of ambient temperatures on the immune responses of pigs.",

It was shown that a high ambient temperature resulted in increased resistance of pigs to clinical disease, whilst a low ambient temperature, and temperature changes, caused a dramatic enhancement in clinical sequelae.

Lower temperatures usually intensified the severity of the particular disease, whereas higher temperatures often resulted in an increased resistance to the clinical syndrome. In a previous report (Shimizu et al., 1978) , it was shown that feeder pigs 2 to 3 months old, kept at a high temperature, endured infection with TGE virus without showing clinical signs, and that both temperature change, and low temperature, exacerbated the infection in pigs. The change from the high to low temperature was considered to be an important factor in the induction of TGE in feeder pigs. At present, however, the mechanism by which the adverse temperature enhances the severity of various virus diseases is not fully understood. One possible explanation for the mechanism might be that an elevated body temperature, induced by the high ambient temperature, enhances the resistance of animals to the infection. The elevated body temperature may directly inhibit intracellular replication of virus, or may induce abortive infection. In rabies virus infection of mice (Bell and Moore, 1974) and canine herpesvirus infection of puppies (Carmichael et al., 1969) , resistance of animals to infection was associated with an elevated body temperature. It remains obscure, however, whether resistance induced by elevated body temperatures results from direct effects on viruses, or from indirect effects through protective responses of the host.",

In the present studies, however, IF was not detected in the intestinal contents and washings obtained from pigs with and without clinical signs of TGE, suggesting that the effects of ambient temperatures may not operate through regulation of IF production in this situation.",

The delay in initiation of the immune response in infected pigs held at 4\u00b0C, compared with that in comparable pigs held at 30\u00b0C, was in the order of 4 days. It will be noted that clinical disease in the pigs kept at 4\u00b0C resulted after an incubation period of 1--2 days. If suppression of cell-mediated responses is the cause of clinical disease in pigs held at 4\u00b0C, it would imply that such cell-mediated responses in pigs with subclinical disease held at 30\u00b0C, occur within 48 h. From the experiment with an immunosuppressive drug, there would seem no doubt that immunosuppression was associated with clinical disease even at 30\u00b0C, and the tentative conclusion is drawn that low ambient temperatures may interfere with the early initiation of local cell-mediated responses in the TGE model.",
