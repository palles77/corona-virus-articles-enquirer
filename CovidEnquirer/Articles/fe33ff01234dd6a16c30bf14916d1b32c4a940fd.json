Such technology allows for real-time evaluation of disease progression and when applied to studying infectious diseases may provide insight into pathogenesis. Insertion of a SPECT-compatible reporter gene into a virus may provide insight into mechanisms of pathogenesis and viral tropism. The human sodium iodide symporter (hNIS), a SPECT and positron emission tomography reporter gene, was inserted into Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), a recently emerged virus that can cause severe respiratory disease and death in afflicted humans to obtain a quantifiable and sensitive marker for viral replication to further MERS-CoV animal model development. The recombinant virus was evaluated for fitness, stability, and reporter gene functionality. The recombinant and parental viruses demonstrated equal fitness in terms of peak titer and replication kinetics, were stable for up to six in vitro passages, and were functional. Further in vivo evaluation indicated variable stability, but resolution limits hampered in vivo functional evaluation. These data support the further development of hNIS for monitoring infection in animal models of viral disease. IMPORTANCE Advanced medical imaging such as single photon emission computed tomography with computed tomography (SPECT/CT) enhances fields such as oncology and cardiology. Application of SPECT/CT, magnetic resonance imaging, and positron emission tomography to infectious disease may enhance pathogenesis studies and provide alternate biomarkers of disease progression. The experiments described in this article focus on insertion of a SPECT/CT-compatible reporter gene into MERS-CoV to demonstrate that a functional SPECT/CT reporter gene can be inserted into a virus.",

Applying medical imaging technology, such as single photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) or positron emission tomography (PET), to animal models of human infectious disease provides the capability to serially monitor anatomical and physiological responses to infection in the same subject that can be clinically translated. Generating a virus that carries a SPECT/PET-compatible reporter gene furthers that capability by serial, real-time evaluation of virus kinetics, identification of tissue tropism, and determination of pathogenic mechanisms.

Oncolytic viruses such as measles virus and replication-deficient adenovirus that contain hNIS have demonstrated value as theranostics, as hNIS is used both as a therapeutic platform and to track the therapeutic effect (8, 9) . In addition, hNIS is unlikely to perturb the underlying cell biochemistry, and no negative effects of resultant sodium influx have been observed (12) .

To demonstrate in vitro hNIS functionality, a series of assays were performed to characterize the kinetics of 99m Tcpertechnetate cellular uptake, the relationship between virus concentration and probe cellular uptake, and between probe dose and its detectability by the gamma camera. The in vitro hNIS functionality assay is outlined in Fig. 3a and b. The 99m Tcpertechnetate uptake by rMERS-CoV/hNIS-infected cells in six-well plates was visible on the tissue culture plate images and distinguishable from the background radioactivity in the wells with uninfected and rMERS-CoV-infected cells (Fig. 3c) . In rMERS-CoV/hNISinfected cells, uptake increased with time after infection and reached a maximum, 20% of the dose applied to the well, at the final 96-h postinfection time point (Fig. 4a) . The mean radioactivity values measured in the wells were 89.8 \u03ee 5.6, 0.77 \u03ee 0.15, and 0.57 \u03ee 0.04 Ci for rMERS-CoV/hNIS-infected, rMERS-CoV-infected, and uninfected cells, respectively. 99m Tc-pertechnetate uptake was dependent on the virus MOI (Fig. 4b) . Higher MOI was associated with greater accumulation of 99m Tc-pertechnetate by rMERS-CoV/hNISinfected cells.",

The relationship between radioactivity measured by the gamma camera on plate images and the dose of 99m Tc-pertechnetate added to each well was linear with high correlation (R 2 \u03ed 0.99, linear regression). At 96 hours postinfection with an MOI of 0.01, uptake was slightly above the background level when the 99m Tc-pertechnetate dose of 0.02 mCi per well was applied, and no uptake was detected when 0.004 mCi of 99m Tc-pertechnetate was added to each well (Fig. 4c) . Therefore, the 99m Tc-pertechnetate dose should be considered a limiting factor for detection of hNIS expression in rMERS-CoV/hNIS-infected cells. Importantly, no changes The specificity of 99m Tc-pertechnetate uptake by rMERS-CoV/hNIS-infected cells was confirmed by adding sodium perchlorate, a specific and competitive inhibitor of hNIS protein function, and assessing uptake at 24 h postinfection ( Fig. 5a) . At a concentration of 0.1 mM, sodium perchlorate blocked 99.5% of the cellular uptake of 99m Tcpertechnetate in rMERS-CoV/hNIS-infected cells at an MOI of 0.01. Sodium perchlorate concentrations below 0.1 mM reduced the inhibitory effect. For example, radiotracer uptake was inhibited by 50% at sodium perchlorate concentrations of 0.001 mM at 24 h postinfection (Fig. 5a) . The effective inhibition of 99m Tc-pertechnetate uptake with 0.1 mM sodium perchlorate declined between 48 and 96 h postinfection (Fig. 5b) , suggesting that viral transcription can overcome the inhibitory effect. By 96 h postinfec- rMERS-CoV Expressing the Sodium Iodide Symporter tion, 99m Tc-pertechnetate uptake in rMERS-CoV/hNIS-infected cells was nearly double the uptake at 24 h postinfection in the presence of sodium perchlorate (Fig. 5b) .",

Despite the presence of a robust signal, the clinical grade SPECT/CT in our facility did not provide the necessary resolution to demonstrate in vivo functionality of the rMERS-CoV/hNIS in mice. If available, a micro-PET/CT and the use of tetrafluorborate, an alternate hNIS ligand, could be used to increase sensitivity and improve signal to noise (26) . The recombinant MERS-CoV/hNIS has similar fitness to the parental virus, rMERS-CoV, as evidenced by similar kinetics, fitness, and cytopathic effect in vitro. The results of in vivo evaluation also support similar fitness; however, further development would require insertion of the hNIS transgene into other locations within the virus and insertion of the transgene into the MERS-15 virus, which can cause lethal respiratory disease in the 288/300 \u03e9\u03e9 mice.",

An alternative to the SPECT is use of a gamma counter to measure the radioactivity in the tissues; unfortunately, a suitable gamma counter is not available in our biosafety level 4 (BSL-4) laboratory. Alternatively, utilization of rMERS-CoV/hNIS in larger animals, i.e., nonhuman primates, should help overcome the SPECT clinical scanner's limited spatial resolution. This technology also aids identification of tissues that are directly infected, which would improve virological analysis, histological analysis, and characterization of tissue-specific response to infection.",

The results from the mouse experiments agree with published studies (20, 21, 25) and corroborate previous data that indicate that wild-type virus grows to a high titer in the 288/300 \u03e9\u03e9 transgenic mice. Realizing the potential and limitations of the existing MERS-CoV animal models, further incorporation of real-time imaging technology will expand MERS-CoV research. Development of recombinant viruses with imaging reporter genes and its application with suitable animal models will be instrumental in furthering our understanding of viral pathogenesis, potentially leading to improved animal models of human disease and more efficient countermeasure evaluation.",

Transfections for recovery of the recombinant viruses were performed at biosafety level 3 (BSL-3). Except for generation of the recombinant viruses, all experimental (3) procedures were conducted at BSL-4 biocontainment laboratories due to the location of the SPECT clinical scanner.
