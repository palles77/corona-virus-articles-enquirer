Lower respiratory tract infections with CARV can be associated with significant morbidity and even mortality in this population The impact of CARV infections on the progression of chronic allograft dysfunction in lung transplant recipients remains controversial Among CARVs, influenza infection may particularly present with severe disease in SOT recipients. The main risk factors for severe influenza infection are a shorter time from transplant and the presence of pneumonia Nucleic acid amplification testing (NAT) has become the main diagnostic method for detecting CARVs in clinical specimens. NAT is significantly more sensitive than other methods such as direct antigen detection or virus isolation by cell culture Infection control measures remain an essential element in decreasing the burden of CARVs in SOT recipients The main strategy for preventing influenza is yearly administration of the inactivated influenza vaccine, and it is highly recommended after transplantation. While most studies have shown a reduction in the immunogenicity of influenza vaccine in SOT recipients, some degree of efficacy is expected in this population The role of palivizumab or IVIG in preventing respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infection in SOT recipients has not been established The use of antiviral therapy with neuraminidase inhibitors is associated with improved outcomes in SOT recipients, irrespective of the duration of symptoms. Antiviral therapy should be empirically administered to all SOT recipients Introduction Community-acquired respiratory virus (CARV) infections are a common cause of medical consultations and hospitalizations in solid organ transplant (SOT) recipients [1] . They are caused by a variety of RNA viruses, including influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), parainfluenza virus (PIV), rhinovirus (hRV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and coronavirus. In addition, DNA viruses, such as adenovirus, polyomavirus, and bocavirus, may also be responsible for cases of respiratory tract infection. While the majority of infections due to CARV are restricted to the upper respiratory tract (URT), SOT recipients, due to alterations in cellular and humoral immunity, are at a higher risk of developing progression to the lower respiratory tract (LRT) [2] . CARV LRT infections are associated with significant morbidity in SOT recipients. Specifically in lung transplant recipients, CARV LRT infections may be associated with a higher incidence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD), although the literature on this topic is controversial [3] . While all viruses share similar clinical manifestations, influenza viruses appear to be particularly associated with impaired outcomes in SOT recipients [4] .",

Infection with influenza virus can occur at any time after transplantation, and it appears to be most severe in the early post-transplant period (<3 months) [10] . The risk of influenza is also related to the type of organ transplant. In a study involving 3569 SOT recipients, the incidence of influenza was 41.8, 4.3 and 2.8 cases/1000 person-years among lung, kidney and liver transplant recipients, respectively [4] . Similarly, studies performed during the pandemic documented that the incidence of influenza A/H1N1 infection was higher in recipients of lungs (30-400 cases per 1000 person-years) than in recipients of other organs, such as the kidney (19-22 cases per 1000 person-years), liver (29 cases per 1000 person-years) or heart (37 cases per 1000 patient-years) [11, 12] . Fewer data are available regarding the epidemiology of influenza B virus infection in transplant recipients. Some series have reported that influenza B virus may cause up to one-fourth of the total number of influenza cases [13, 14] , but it is not known whether influenza B virus infection may be associated with different outcomes in SOT recipients.",

Influenza should be clinically suspected in all SOT recipients presenting with respiratory symptoms such as fever, rhinorrhea, cough and sore throat, with or without myalgias and headaches and dyspnoea during the influenza season [4, 15] . However, fever may be missing, and the usually abrupt onset may be delayed in immunocompromised patients [16] . Therefore, a proposal has been made to modify the definitions of influenza-like illness provided by the ECDC to better capture the presentation in immunocompromised patients [17] . Basically, the definition of CARV disease includes: (i) a new onset of symptoms and (ii) at least one of the following four respiratory symptoms (cough, sore throat, shortness of breath and coryza) and (iii) the clinician's judgment that the illness is due to an infection. The occurrence of pneumonia in SOT recipients with influenza infection ranges from 14% to 49%, and bilateral involvement is frequently observed [4] [5] [6] . Bacterial, viral or fungal co-infection is relatively common in SOT recipients and reported co-infection frequency ranges from 7% to 29% [5, 18] . An increased risk of acute and chronic allograft rejection also has been associated with infection by influenza and other respiratory viruses [4, 5, 11] . In lung transplant recipients, influenza has been linked to the occurrence of chronic lung allograft dysfunction (CLAD) [12, 19] , although not consistently in all studies [3] . Other less frequent complications of influenza in SOT recipients include encephalitis, myocarditis and myositis. Influenza in SOT recipients has been associated with high rates of medical complications and even mortality [4] [5] [6] . The main risk factors associated with impaired outcomes are the presence of pneumonia and diabetes mellitus, the use of antilymphocyte globulin (<6 months), and delayed antiviral therapy [10] .",

This increased sensitivity is also associated with an excellent specificity, particularly when the detection of the amplified product uses a specific probe [27] . At this time NAT are frequently based on the real-time PCR technology and present theoretically the following advantages: they could detect viral load as low as few copies of genome equivalent introduced into the amplification reaction, the analytical specificity approaches 100%, and the technique can provide semi-quantitative results. A challenge for CARV detection is related to the number of different agents that need to be detected, which may encompass 16 or more different viral species, types or subtypes depending on the completeness of the screening and the spectrum of agents targeted [27] .

Therefore, one should be cautious not to over-interpret quantitative results. Also, the duration of viral shedding using sensitive molecular assays can be significantly longer compared with immunocompetent adults. In immunocompetent adults we expect a rapid viral clearance and nucleic acid detection to be negative within 7-10 days. Prolonged shedding for weeks and months is a common occurrence in highly immunocompromised individuals [16, 28] . Particularly for influenza, protocols for establishing the best frequency for viral testing and appropriate cut-offs for discontinuation of antiviral therapy in SOT recipients have not been described. (Table 1) Infection control measures remain an essential element for decreasing the burden of CARVs in SOT recipients. Overall awareness among healthcare personnel and caregivers about the potential deleterious outcomes of CARV infections in SOT recipients and the importance of early detection of infection may have a major impact on the incidence of CARV infections and subsequent complications. More specifically, hand hygiene and adherence to contact and respiratory droplet isolation will help reduce CARV infections in SOT recipients. These infection control measures need to be taken until the patient is sent home or until PCR is negative.",

In addition, patients who developed symptomatic influenza infection after vaccination had a 70% reduced risk of subsequent pneumonia [32] . In a large registry of kidney transplant recipients, influenza vaccination during the first year after transplantation was associated with a reduced incidence of graft loss and mortality [33] . However, data on the immunogenicity of influenza vaccination in the transplant population are controversial and most published studies suggest that a reduced humoral immune response is expected in SOT recipients [29, 34] . Lung transplant recipients appear to have a poorer response than recipients of other allografts, probably related to the higher degree of immunosuppression needed after lung transplantation and the allogeneic constellation between virus-infected host cells and effector T cells [8] . The use of mycophenolate mofetil and mTOR inhibitors has been related to a weaker response to influenza vaccine in some studies [8, 35, 36] , but not in others [37] .

This recommendation is made irrespective of the duration of the symptoms and the severity of illness. In any case, antiviral treatment of influenza-like illness should not be delayed by waiting for microbiological confirmation, but rather discontinued when appropriate test results are negative. Early specific antiviral treatment should be especially encouraged in cases of pneumonia. Two classes of antiviral drugs are currently approved for treatment of influenza infection: M2 inhibitors (amantadine and rimantadine), which are active only against influenza A, and neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir). Other drugs under investigation are parenteral zanamivir and peramivir. M2 inhibitors are not currently recommended due to resistance of most circulating influenza A strains and the variable, but at times predominant, circulation of influenza B. Neuraminidase inhibitors are usually well tolerated, with the most common adverse effects being gastrointestinal symptoms. In children, the use of oseltamivir has been associated with neuropsychiatric adverse events. Inhaled zanamivir (two puffs, 10 mg, twice daily) does not require dose adjustment either for hepatic or renal failure. Oral oseltamivir (75 mg twice daily) dose adjustment is not needed in hepatic impairment but doses should be modified in renal insufficiency according to the recommendations included in Table 3 . Proven benefits of higher doses of oseltamivir in SOT recipients with severe influenza infection are lacking [43] .",
