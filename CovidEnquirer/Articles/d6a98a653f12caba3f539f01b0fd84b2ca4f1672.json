TCRs were previously thought of as simple 'on/off' switches that were highly specific for a single 'foreign' peptide. Numerous studies have now demonstrated different functional outcomes resulting from the engagement of the same TCR by different peptide ligands depending on whether a peptide acts as an agonist, partial agonist or antagonist of a TCR [1]. At the same time, it has been shown that several peptides that have relatively little primary sequence homology to each other can all act as agonists of the same TCR [2, 3] . The activation of autoreactive T cells by such pathogen-derived peptides that mimic self-peptides has been termed 'molecular mimicry' [4, 5] . The emerging complexity of TCR recognition has important implications for understanding both self-tolerance and the pathogenesis of human autoimmune diseases. This review will discuss the structural requirements for the activation of autoreactive T cells by microbial peptides in the development of human autoimmune diseases.",

For the majority of MHC class II molecules, every position in the peptide can be substituted by one of a few or many different amino acids. T cell recognition, however, is much more specific as a T cell clone will not cross-react with the majority of 'control' antigens tested.

In contrast to antibodies, there is no affinity maturation process that improves the fit of a TCR for a given MHC molecule-peptide complex during an ongoing immune response. The specificity of the adult TCR repertoire is a balance between two possible extremes: highly specific TCRs that require particular amino acids at many positions of the MHC molecule-bound peptide and highly degenerate TCRs that only require certain sequence features in the MHC molecule-bound peptide and therefore cross-react with many different microbial peptides. The obvious disadvantages of these extremes are that the highly specific TCRs may never be engaged in an immune response (i.e. the respective microbial peptide sequence may not exist) and that the highly degenerate TCRs may cross-react with many self-peptides and cause autoimmunity. The balance between these two extremes is likely to be the result of the thymic selection process: firstly, negative selection will delete the T cells that have a high affinity for the MHC molecule (regardless of its peptide content) and that are likely to be highly cross-reactive, and secondly, a failure to undergo positive selection will eliminate the T cells that have a too low an affinity for MHC molecules.",

Human myelin basic protein (MBP)-specific T cell clones with degenerate peptide recognition were found to cross-react with a number of microbial peptides whereas T cell clones that were more specific cross-reacted only with one or two microbial peptides (M Martin and K Wucherpfennig, unpublished data). Each TCR peptide-contact residue could be substituted by at least one structurally related amino acid for T cell clones with degenerate peptide recognition; clones that were more specific required amino acid identity at the primary TCR peptide-contact residues (M Martin and K Wucherpfennig, unpublished data). These data suggest that the mature T-cell repertoire represents a spectrum of T cell clones in terms of the degree of specificity/degeneracy of peptide recognition (Figure 1 ). According to this model, T cell clones with degenerate peptide recognition are more frequently engaged in an immune response and are more likely to induce an autoimmune response due to cross-reactivity between a microbial and a self-peptide.

The HTLV-I tax specific TCR was oriented diagonally over the MHC molecule-peptide complex, with the CDR1 and CDR3 loops from both the c~ and 13 TCR chain variable regions contacting the peptide. The same orientation of the TCR on the MHC molecule-peptide complex was observed for a murine MHC class I restricted TCR [10\u00b0'], suggesting that this binding mode is general. The peptide binding surface of the TCR was found to be remarkably flat, with the exception of a central pocket that occupied the central residue (Y5: in single-letter amino acid code) of the tax peptide. This pocket was created by the CDR3 loops of both V~ and VI]. The small size of the contact surface between the TCR and the tax peptide (326,~,z) and the fact that substantial contacts were made only to the peptide residues Y5 and Y8 indicates that there are limits placed on the specificity of a TCR. When Y5 was substituted by alanine (Y5A) the peptide still formed TCR-peptide-HLA-A2 complexes that crystallized and acted as a partial agonist [9\"].",

            "text": "Recognition of peptide sequences that are strikingly different by the same TCR has been observed for several alloreactive T cell clones [11,12\",13] There are two structural explanations for this phenomenon. First, two peptide-MHC molecule complexes in which the peptides differ in their primary sequence may form similar TCR-accessible surfaces in terms of volume, charge, and hydrophobicity, allowing the TCR to engage those complexes in a similar way. Second, there may be a certain degree of flexibility in the conformation of the TCR CDR loops, allowing a TCR to specifically bind to different MHC molecule-peptide surfaces [16\u00b0]. The crystal structures of such different TCR-peptide-MHC molecule complexes are required to answer this question. The recognition of HLA-DR2-presented MBP(85-99) by autoreactive T cell clones from MS patients has been studied extensively and illustrates several aspects of specificity/degeneracy in T cell recognition. Analysis of the fine specificity of MBP(85-99)-specific T cell clones, by using single amino acid analog peptides, revealed a high degree of specificity toward some ('major') TCR contact residues combined with a certain degree of degeneracy toward other ('minor') TCR contacts. For example, the addition of a single hydroxyl group (F91Y) completely abrogated T cell activation by some clones, whereas changes at other positions (e.g. I95A) had little effect [25, 26] . Certain substitutions even enhance HLA-DR2 binding (T97A) or TCR recognition (these mutations differ between T cell clones), representing so called 'superagonists'. Such substitutions can compensate for other substitutions that are suboptimal, resulting in multisubstituted peptides that have a similar efficacy as the native antigen [25, 27] . In addition to such 'additive' effects, 'complementary' substitutions have been described in which a T cell clone does not respond to a single amino acid substituted peptide (F91Y or K93R) but only to the double-substituted peptide (F91Y K93R) [28\"].",

The microbial peptides were quite distinct in their sequence from the MBP peptide and each other as only the primary TCR contact residues (either F91 or K93) were conserved. Presentation of microbial peptides by infected cells was examined for the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) DNA polymerase peptide. Reactivation of the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) lytic cycle by phorbol esters resulted in the activation of an MBP-specific T cell clone that cross-reacted with the EBV peptide, but not in the activation of a control clone that only recognized the MBP peptide.

Important differences, however, in the antibody and T cell epitopes were: firstly, a longer peptide was required for optimal T cell stimulation than for antibody binding, and secondly, sequence identity was required at every peptide position in the core of the antibody epitope whereas the MHC molecule contact residues in the T cell epitope could be substituted by other amino acids.

When tested with alanine analogs, identity at four amino acid positions was found to be required for T-cell cross-reactivity whereas five position were necessary for the induction of EAE [37, 38] .

In susceptible individuals, the activation of autoreactive T cells is necessary but not sufficient for the development of an autoimmune disease (Table 3 ). An insufficient degree of clonal expansion of autoreactive T cells may be a major limiting factor. As some autoreactive T cell clones are activated by peptides from different pathogens a stepwise expansion of autoreactive T cells by subsequent infections is possible. Another limiting factor may be the functional phenotype induced by the infectious agent. In the EAE model, only a small fraction of MBP-specific T cell clones is pathogenic (<10%) and the presence ofa Thl phenotype alone is insufficient to induce EAE (S Brocke, personal communication). Therefore, autoreactive T cells may only be pathogenic if a particular functional program is induced by the infectious agent. Other factors that limit the occurrence of an autoimmune disease are access to the target organ, in addition to the expression levels of MHC class II and costimulatory molecules in the target organ. This is illustrated by the observation that in mice transgenic for an MBP(Acl-ll)-specific TCR, the in vivo activation of the autoreactive T ceils, even with the native MBP peptide, is not sufficient to induce EAE unless the entry of those cells into the CNS is facilitated by pertussis toxin [34\u00b0].

Genome wide analyses have demonstrated that multiple loci confer susceptibility to MS, with the MHC locus on chromosome 6 being a primary susceptibility locus [17-19]. Among MHC class II haplotypes, the HLA-DR2 haplotype (DRBI*1501) confers the highest risk for the development of MS. Migration studies have also implicated environmental exposure as a risk factor [20]. Despite the evidence that environmental exposure is important, no single pathogen has been shown to be responsible for the development of the disease. The T cell response to myelin antigens, in particular MBP and proteolipid protein (PLP), has been studied by a number of groups. The immunodominant epitopes of these antigens have been defined and the MBP region amino acids 85-99 (MBP[85-99]) was found to be immunodominant in patients carrying the HLA-DR2 (DRBI*1501) haplotype [21-23]. MBP(85-99)-specific T cells were found to be clonally expanded in MS patients [24], supporting their role in the pathogenesis of the disease.",

These libraries consist of a large number of different peptides (2 x 1014 different sequences for an Xll library). Such a degree of degeneracy may not be very common as other MBP(85-99)-specific T cell clones were not stimulated by such random peptide libraries (M Martin, K Wucherpfennig, unpublished data).",
