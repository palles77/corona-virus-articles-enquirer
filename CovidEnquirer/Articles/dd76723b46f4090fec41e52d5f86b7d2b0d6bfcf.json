            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) causes severe diarrhea and high fatality of piglets, influencing the swine industry. Japanese horse chestnut (seed of Aesculus turbinata) contains many saponin mixtures, called escins, and has been used for a long time as a traditional medicinal plant. Structure-activity relationship (SAR) studies on escins have revealed that acylations at C-21 and C-22 with angeloyl or tigloyl groups were important for their cytotoxic effects. However, the strong cytotoxicity of escins makes them hard to utilize for other diseases and to develop as nutraceuticals. In this research, we investigated whether escin derivatives 1-7 (including new compounds 2, 3, 5 and 6), without the angeloyl or tigloyl groups and with modified glycosidic linkages by hydrolysis, have PEDV inhibitory effects with less cytotoxicity. Compounds 1-7 had no cytotoxicity at 20 lM on VERO cells, while compounds 8-10 showed strong cytotoxicity at similar concentrations on PEDV. Our results suggest that escin derivatives showed strong inhibitory activities on PEDV replication with lowered cytotoxicity. These studies propose a method to utilize Japanese horse chestnut for treating PEDV and to increase the diversity of its bioactive compounds.",

PEDV causes severe diarrhea, dehydration, vomiting in pigs of all ages, and high mortality of piglets, resulting in tremendous financial loss. 7 Thus, these results imply the necessity of studying the characteristics of coronaviruses and discovering active drugs to prevent the fast and extensive spread of coronaviruses.",

            "text": "Aesculus L (Hippocastanaceae) contains 12 species of deciduous trees and has been cultivated as pharmaceutical crops for the production of Standardized Therapeutics Extracts of escins in China. The common name ''horse chestnut\" came from the uses of seeds for horses to treat overexertion or coughs, and it has been used as therapeutics purposes for anti-fever. 8 Japanese horse chestnut (Aesculus turbinata) is a medicinal plant widely distributed in Japan and also has a small amount of cultivation in Korea and China. 9 The seeds, which a large amount of escins were reported as its constituents, 9 have been used for diverse biological activities including anti-inflammatory, anti-obesity, hypoglycemic, and anti-cancer effects. [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] Escins were also reported to possess strong antiviral effects against SARS-CoV with an EC 50 of 6.0 lM (SI value of 2.5) 15 and against anti-HIV-1 protease. 9 However, the industrial utilization of escins for application to diseases and development as nutraceuticals has been limited to date due to their strong nonspecific cytotoxic effects. These reports prompted us towards the development of safer escin derivatives with anti-CoV activities. Previous studies on structure-activity relationship with escins suggested that acylation at C-21 and C-22 was necessary for the cytotoxic effects. [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] The cytotoxicity can be enhanced with methylation at C-24 and a free hydroxyl at C-16 at oleanane-type structure and altered by the site of glycosides. 14, 21 Thus, alkaline and acid hydrolysis of escins was applied to detach acyl moieties at C-21 and C-22, and provide varieties of sugar moieties at C-3.",

These results indicated the attachment of b-D-glucopyranosiduronic acid to C-3 (d C 89.0). The linkage position of this b-Dglucopyranosiduronic acid was confirmed by the HMBC experiment from the correlation from H-1 0 (d H 5.03) to C-3 (d C 89.1) ( Fig. 2A) .
