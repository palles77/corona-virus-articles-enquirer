However, cold-chain supply for perishable products has not kept up with the rapidly expanding market. Temperature-sensitive biopharmaceutical products also require cold-chain supply. However, at present, the biopharmaceutical cold-chain monitoring system scarcely exists in China. Li, Li, and Shuo (2008) discussed the \"broken cold-chain\" problem in the transportation of products from the pharmaceutical manufacturing factory to patients. Temperature-sensitive products arrive damaged or degraded because of a broken cold chain, which arises from problems concerning management and regulation mechanisms. Rossetti and Handfield (2011) reviewed the radical changes of biopharmaceutical supply chains and identified the major drivers of associated management. Obviously, both the perishable food and biopharmaceutical markets are in urgent need of improved cold-chain systems to ensure the quality and safety of products during the distribution process.",

In contrast, the rate of circulation of perishables under cold-chain conditions in Europe and North America was over 95%. The rates of loss of fruit and vegetables, meat, and aquatic foods during the logistics process in China were as much as 15%, 8%, and 10%, while that in developed countries was less than 5%, and only 2% the United States (Ding, 2010) . The high rate of loss of fresh agricultural products in China is due to the dispersed and small size of farm supply, incomplete refrigeration facilities, a lack of professionalized logistics services, and poor organization of circulation. For example, one critical process in the cold chain is precooling, which restrains the respiration of fresh agricultural products to avoid decomposition. Precooling requires investment into dedicated cold-chain facilities, but owners of small farms cannot afford such investment for fresh agricultural products. Moreover, the wide geographical distribution of supply sources for products such as milk aggravates the difficulties of achieving fast delivery.",

The results showed that the key areas where cold-chain service providers could improve, as recognized by most companies, were those of service processes and cost-effectiveness. Management, equipment quality, and lead-time were also considered to be important aspects. Price, range of services, and service levels were identified as being the most important criteria when companies select a cold-chain service provider.

With the increasing public awareness of food quality and drug safety, the traditionally fragmented perishable product markets have undergone rapid structural changes in the last two decades. The trend in research interests has now shifted to quality control, product traceability and supervision, and coordination in the entire cold chain. Study showed that food safety measures in developed countries have a strong impact on export-oriented supply chains in developed countries (Henson, Brouder, & Mitullah, 2000) . Cold chain is changing from a system dominated by producers/exporters (often run by government bodies and producer groups) feeding products into traders and wholesalers toward a system dominated by end-customers (Drewry Shipping Consultants, 2003) . Research also focused on the increasing importance of biopharmaceutical cold-chain management as a result of the growing market, the requirements for storage and distribution, the monitoring of temperature, and regulatory trends (Bishara, 2006) . It was also found that the need for appropriate equipment to store and transport vaccines in developing countries led to innovations in refrigeration equipment as well as adoption of high-performance vaccine cold boxes and carriers (Lloyd & Cheyne, 2017) . Generally, there are two categories of study that address this new issue regarding perishable products, the research on cold chains and supply relationship, and the research of value-chain analysis. In terms of the cold supply chains, an analytical model of product quality and supply configurations was developed with an optimal batch size of storage, and addressed the energy and environmental concerns of cold chains (Zanoni & Zavanella, 2012) . The survey of the industry experts' insights about European food service supply chains showed that the industry is aiming at creating customer value (Darkow, Foerster, & von der Gracht, 2015) . The cold chains of aquatic products were also discussed and it was shown that within certain temperature range, lower temperature brings higher profit level, and their findings encouraged better temperature control of cold chains (Wu, Deng, Zhang, & Zhang, 2015) . One type of cold chains, i.e., the pharmaceutical supply chain was studied with a systematic review of research on managerial issues, and the research direction about structure of pharmaceutical supply chains was highlighted (Narayana, Pati, & Vrat, 2014) . Regarding the vaccine cold-chain system, three key issues were identified limiting this cold-chain system through experiment studies in 10 countries, i.e., insufficient cold-chain capacity, lack of optimal equipment or technology, and inadequate temperature monitoring and maintenance (Ashok, Brison, & Letallec, 2017) .",

Porter (2001) used the terms \"value chain\" and \"value system\" to discuss company strategies in terms of the management of relationships with other firms. The value chain describes the full range of activities involved in forming a product or service from conception, through the different phases of production, and delivery to end users. The value system basically extends the idea of the value chain to interlink organizational value chains (Kaplinsky & Morris, 2001) . Valuechain analysis is a powerful tool for strategic planning as it allows the value generated along the chain to be scrutinized to increase profit margin. By exploiting the upstream and downstream information flowing along the value chain, firms may try to bypass intermediaries, create better business models, or make improvements in their value-creation system. Nevertheless, it is worth noting that the profitability of segments changes over time and with changes in business environment. Also, customer value theory indicates that what customers value changes over time (Flint & Mentzer, 2000; Woodruff, 1997) . Therefore, it is critical to understand the dynamics of the value-chain system.",

There are two main corridors for fruit cold chains to Nanning in China by way of Laos and Vietnam, known as R9 and R12. They are identified by blue (gray in print version) line in Fig. 10 .5. R9 starts from Bangkok, passes through Mukdahan\u00c0Savannakhet border crossing between Thailand and Laos, Dansavan\u00c0Laobao border crossing between Laos and Vietnam, Langsan\u00c0Youyiguan border crossing between Vietnam and China, and finally reaches Nanning in Guangxi Province of China.
