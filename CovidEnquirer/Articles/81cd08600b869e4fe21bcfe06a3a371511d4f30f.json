The level of targeted protein expression and siRNA uptake were examined in A549 cells. CS-modified PLGA NS exhibited much higher encapsulation efficiency than unmodified PLGA NS (plain-PLGA NS). CS-modified PLGA NS showed a positive zeta potential, while plain-PLGA NS were negatively charged. siRNA uptake studies by observation with confocal leaser scanning microscopy (CLSM) indicated that siRNA-loaded CS-modified PLGA NS were more effectively taken up by the cells than plain-PLGA NS. The efficiencies of different siRNA preparations were compared at the level of targeted protein expression. The gene-silencing efficiency of CS-modified PLGA NS was higher and more prolonged than those of plain-PLGA NS and naked siRNA. This result correlated with the CLSM studies, which may have been due to higher cellular uptake of CSmodified PLGA NS due to electrostatic interactions. It was concluded that CS-modified PLGA NS containing siRNA could provide an effective siRNA delivery system.",

Small interfering RNAs (siRNA), which are small double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) oligonucleotides with or without overhangs, are substrates for the RNA-induced silencing complex [2] . When transfected into cells, synthetic siR-NAs strongly inhibit the expression of a target protein in mammalian cells. The application of siRNA to human therapy has attracted much attention, although the delivery of siRNA to the appropriate cells, tissues, or organs remains a major challenge. An ideal gene delivering carrier should safely transport genetic materials without any toxic effects or inducing immune responses [3] . Most research has used viral vectors, retroviruses, and adenoviruses, or liposomes [4] . Recently, many non-viral vectors have been reported that were modified with fusogenic peptides [5] , cationic lipids [6] , cationic polymers [7] [8] [9] , and others. However, some cationic compounds show cytotoxicity effects.",

In particular, biodegradable nanospheres are available for delivering drugs and are degraded after passing a required specific site [11] . Among these, poly(lactide) (PLA) and poly(D,L-lactide-co-glycolide) (PLGA) have been approved by the FDA for certain human clinical uses. The degradation time of PLGA can be altered from days to years by varying the molecular weight, the lactic acid to glycolic acid ratio in the copolymer, or the nanospheres' structure. PLGA nanospheres have been suggested to be a good gene delivery carrier because of their safety and their properties of sustained release [12, 13] . We have developed an emulsion solvent diffusion (ESD) method in water for preparing PLGA NS [14] . The advantages of this ESD method are that NS can be prepared by a simple process under mild conditions without sonication. A PLGA NS platform to encapsulate a wide variety of nucleic acids (e.g., plasmid DNA, antisense oligonucleotides, siRNA) for gene delivery was established using the ESD method [15] .",

CSmodified PLGA NS could be prepared by adding a CS solution into the outer phase with a PVA solution. The CS-modified PLGA NS had a positive charge due to protonation of the amino group. The zeta potential shifted to positive values due to the effect of CS adsorbed on the surface of PLGA NS. The particle size of CS-modified PLGA NS increased because the molecular layers of CS modified the surface of PLGA NS. We have also checked the composition of CSmodified PLGA NS using FITC-conjugated CS. CS adsorbed on NS surface was 8% (w/w) in the NS (data not shown). After modifying with CS, the encapsulation efficiency was increased. The effect of modifying with CS on the loading efficiency might be caused by an ionic interaction between siRNA and CS and prevented leakage of siRNA from emulsion droplets during the diffusion process.

Luciferase activity of A549-Luc cells proportionally increased according to the number of the cells, indicating that the luciferase activity could be used as an indicator of the number of cells. As shown in Fig. 6A , the luciferase gene-silencing efficiency of CS-modified PLGA NS was higher and more prolonged than that of plain-PLGA NS. This result that correlated with the CLSM studies might have been caused by the higher cellular uptake ability of CS-modified PLGA NS due to electrostatic interactions. In contrast, siRNA effect of plain-PLGA NS was not observed. Because siRNA encapsulated in plain-PLGA NS taken up by the cells was little because almost siRNA (60%) encapsulated in plain-PLGA NS was released as an initial burst. Furthermore, after initial burst, siRNA did not easily released form plain-PLGA NS. Naked siRNA did not downregulate the production of the luciferase gene. The siRNA/DOTAP complex, used as a positive control, showed strong initial suppression, after which the down regulation effect became gradually weaker. This suppression pattern was quite different with CS-modified PLGA NS. The suppression pattern by siRNA-loaded CS-modified PLGA NS was initially weak and then gradually became stronger. These phenomena could be accounted for by the sustained siRNA release from PLGA NS in the cytosol. A sustained release profile of siRNA from CS-modified PLGA NS was confirmed in Fig. 3 . Adsorption of siRNA on the PLGA NS's surface (siRNA/NS complex) did not maintain the gene-silencing effect. siRNA release from PLGA NS's surface was very rapid (Fig. 3) , resulting in a low, non-sustained gene-silencing effect. In contrast, control siRNA-loaded PLGA NS and empty CS-modified PLGA NS did not show any significant difference for luciferase activity compared to no treatment A549-Luc cells, as shown in Fig. 6B .",

These non-toxic formulations will be further evaluated for their in vitro and in vivo abilities to provide siRNA carriers for the purposes of gene therapy. ",
