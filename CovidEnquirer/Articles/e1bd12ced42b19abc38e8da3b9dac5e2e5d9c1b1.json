            "text": "In recent years, the outbreaks of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) caused by the highly virulent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) variants occurred frequently in China, resulting in severe economic impacts to the pork industry. In this study, we selected and analyzed the genetic evolution of 15 PEDV representative strains that were identified in fecal samples of diarrheic piglets in 10 provinces and cities during 2011-2017. The phylogenetic analysis indicated that all the 15 PEDV isolates clustered into G2 genotype associated with the current circulating strains. Compared with the genome of the prototype strain CV777, these strains had 103-120 amino acid mutations in their S proteins, most of which were in the N terminal domain of S1 (S1-NTD). We also found 37 common mutations in all these 15 strains, although these strains shared 96.9-99.7% nucleotide homology and 96.3-99.8% amino acid homology in the S protein compared with the other original pandemic strains. Computational analysis showed that these mutations may lead to remarkable changes in the conformational structure and asparagine (N)-linked glycosylation sites of S1-NTD, which may be associated with the altered pathogenicity of these variant PEDV strains. We evaluated the pathogenicity of the PEDV strain FJzz1 in piglets through oral and intramuscular infection routes. Compared with oral infection, intramuscular infection could also cause typical clinical signs but with a slightly delayed onset, confirming that the variant PEDV isolate FJzz1 was highly pathogenic to suckling piglets. In conclusion, we analyzed the genetic variation and pathogenicity of the emerging PEDV isolates of China, indicating that G2 variant PEDV strains as the main prevalent strains that may mutate continually. This study shows the necessity of monitoring the molecular epidemiology and the etiological characteristics of the epidemic PEDV isolates, which may help better control the PED outbreaks.

From 2007 to 2010, however, PED re-emerged in Thailand, Vietnam and especially China, caused by new variants of PEDV that have been emerged repeatedly since the October 2010, for which neither CV777 inactivated vaccine nor attenuated live vaccine could provide effective protection (Puranaveja et al., 2009; Sun et al., 2012; Zhou et al., 2012) . Later, a similar variant PEDV was reported for the first time in April 2013 in the United States, which quickly spread to 36 states across the United States and its neighboring countries such as Canada and Mexico (Lee and Lee, 2014;  Korea and Taiwan province of China\uff0cresulting in huge economic losses to the pig industry of the world (Park et al., 2014; Sasaki et al., 2016) . In 2014, a newly variant PEDV strain (described as \"S-INDEL\") with insertions and deletions in the spike gene was reported in the US, which was different from the original highly virulent PEDV strains (Vlasova et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2014) . Soon afterwards, S-INDEL was also reported in Germany and Portugal (Stadler et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2014) . It has been proved that the major difference between the original variant strain and the newly emerging S-INDEL strain locates in the S protein, which might influence the antigenicity and pathogenicity of the two types of strains (Mesquita et al., 2015) . Also, studies have indicated that PEDV strains are undergoing continuous evolution to adapt to the host environment.",

            "text": "PEDV is an enveloped, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, which was thought to mutate easily under the environmental selective pressure. It is a member of the genus Alphacoronavirus, which also includes transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E) and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) (Brian and Baric, 2005) . PEDV consists of about 28 Kb PEDV genome including 7 open reading frames (ORF), coding polyprotein 1a and 1b, spike protein (S), accessary protein 3 (ORF3), envelop protein (E), membrane protein (M) and nucleocapsid protein (N). S protein contains two functional subunits: S1, responsible for the cellular receptor binding, and S2, responsible for the membrane fusion (Liu et al., 2015) . Though the viral receptor binding domain (RBD) on S1 remains controversial, N-terminal of S1 subunit (S1-NTD) has been demonstrated to be able to recognize the cellular carbohydrate N-acetyl neuraminic acid (Neu5Ac), while the C-terminal of S1 subunit (S1-CTD) -binds to the amino peptidase N (APN) (Deng et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2015) . Studies have shown that, compared with the genome of prototype CV777, the mutations in the emerging PEDV variants are mainly concentrated in S1-NTD, reflecting the genetic correlation between different PEDV strains . Therefore, the analysis of S1-NTD is of vital importance in tracking the origin of the variant PEDV strains. Since 2010, the highly virulent PEDV variants have emerged in different parts of the world, resulting in significantly economic losses to the pork producers Li et al., 2012b) . Thus far, the classical CV777-derived vaccine has been widely used in the clinical practice in many Asian countries, which could not induce adequate protection against the disease induced by the emerged PEDV variants. Meanwhile, the application of vaccines in pigs may lead to continuous variation for PEDV to escape immune pressures. This study will provide more insights for predicting the prevalence as well as preventing the outbreaks of PED in the future by analyzing the genetic variation characteristics and the pathogenicity of PEDV isolates.",

And according to our survey, except for several pig farms with no PEDV vaccination, most of the pig farms were immunized by commercial inactivated PEDV vaccines. The total RNA of each sample was extracted by RNeasy Mini Kit (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany) and reverse transcribed into cDNA by Revert Aid First Stranded cDNA Synthesis Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) as described in the handbooks. Then the cDNA was used for PCR with specific primers designed based on the conserved regions of PEDV, TGEV, porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV) and Group A Rotavirus (RoV-A) as described previously .

Noticeably, 37 amino acid mutations were identified in the S1-NTD of all the 15 strains (Table 3) . Among these mutations, 6 insertions ( 59 QGVN 62 , 140 N and 157 H) and 2 deletions ( 163 NI 164 ) were found to be consistent with all the other variant strains except OH851.

Besides, sequence alignment revealed that the nucleotide and amino acid homology between our 15 PEDV strains and the three South Korean PEDV strains were 95.8-97.2% and 95.1-96.9% respectively, higher than that of 93.3-93.9% and 91.7-92.6% between the 15 PEDV strains and the prototype CV777 strain. What's more, our 15 PEDV strains were observed to share 96.9-99.7% nucleotide homology and 96.3-99.8% amino acid homology in the S protein compared with the other original pandemic strains, indicating that variant PEDV strains continue to mutate along with time to adapt the complex external pressure. In addition, all these 15 strains had four common amino acid substitutions including T554 -S, G599 -S, L769 -S and D771 -S in the COE (499-638aa) domain and SS6 (764-771aa) domain (Fig. 2B) , and whether these mutations could affect the virus neutralizing activity remains unclear up till now.",

Remarkably, these 15stains lose four N-linked glycosylation sites at N57 (NSSS), N116 (NTSA), N131 (NKTL) and N235 (NCSG) predicted on the S1-NTD of CV777, but gained three additional putative sites at N62 (NSTW), N118 (NATA) and N1263 (NRTG) on the corresponding regions (Fig. 3B) .

Previous studies demonstrated that S gene is prone to mutate, which could change the pathogenicity of the virus Sun et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2014; Wu et al., 2012) . In this study, a total of 528 diarrheic samples including feces, fecal swabs, and small intestine were collected from 43 pig farms of 10 provinces and cities during 2011-2017, and then detected by RT-PCR targeting N gene of PEDV. Results showed that 385 samples were detected as PEDV positive with a positive rate as high as 72.9%, whereas very few samples were diagnosed as TGEV, PDCoV or PRoV positive. A phylogenetic tree was constructed to investigate the genetic variation of PEDV strains with different time span. The results showed that all the 15 strains identified in this study were clustered into G2 genotype, the homology for nucleotide and amino acid sequence between all the 15 PEDV strains and the currently circulating variant isolates were 96.9-99.7% and 97.0-99.8% respectively, higher than that of 93.3-93.9% and 91.7-92.6% between the 15 PEDV strains and the G1 genotype strains represented by CV777. Interestingly, some typical mutations on the S protein of Chinese prevalent variant strains were also found on three South Korean PEDV strains (KNU-0802: GU180143, KNU-0902: GU180145 and CNU-091222-01: JN184634) that were circulating in -2009 , which suggested that the early variant PEDV strains of China which emerged in the late 2010 associated with the circulating strains in South Korea. Up to now, the variant PEDV strains are still the main pathogen of enteric disease in neonatal piglets of China. Meanwhile, it cannot be ignored that these variant PEDV strains continue to mutate along with time.",

Also the mutations, especially some deletions and insertions in the S protein may change the antigenicity, pathogenicity and neutralization properties (Park et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2015) , and S1-NTD (19-233aa) may be the potential region relevant to the virulence of PEDV Su et al., 2018; Su et al., 2019; Suzuki et al., 2016) . In this study, 49-53 mutations were found in the S1-NTD of all the 15 strains including FJzz1, which might change the major conformations of S1-NTD. Up to now, at least four neutralizing epitopes of PEDV have been identified in the S glycoprotein, namely the COE (499-638), SS2 (748-755), SS6 (764-771) and 2C10 (1368-1374) (Chang et al., 2002; Cruz et al., 2008; Sun et al., 2008) . Coincidentally, four amino acid substitutions including T554 -S, G599 -S, L769 -S and D771 -S were observed in these neutralizing epitopes. Whether these amino acid mutations will affect the neutralization activity of the above epitopes warrant further exploration. What's more, compared with CV777, the 15 stains showed four amino acid insertions ( 59 QGVN 62 ) and three amino acid substitutions (S 118 \u2192 N 118 , 130 DN 131 \u2192 130 SI 131 ), lost three N-linked glycosylation sites at N57 (NSSS), N116 (NTSA), N131 (NKTL) predicted on the S1-NTD of CV777, but gained two additional putative sites at N 62 (NSTW) and N 118 (NATA) on the corresponding regions. Previously, researchers have demonstrated the N-linked glycosylation sites on the S protein of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) play a critical role in the viral entry (Han et al., 2007) . Therefore, we speculate that these variations might result in more efficient recognition and stronger affinity with the specific cell receptor, sugar co-receptor or even other unknown co-receptors, thus better aiding the viral entry. This could be partially supported by the fact that the variant strain exhibited stronger sugar-binding activities than the prototype strain CV777 (Deng et al., 2016) . Meanwhile, the changes of N-linked glycosylation sites may also have an influence on antigenicity of certain important epitopes, which may partly explain why CV777derived vaccine provided poor protection against variant strains. This adaptive variation, however, may also be an evolutionary strategy for immune evasion of the variant PEDV strains, but further experiments such as reverse genetics are required to confirm all these assumptions (Beall et al., 2016; Hou et al., 2019; Wang et al., 2018) .",

Moreover, the morbidity of the oral Group reached 100% 24 h post infection. By contrast, all the piglets showed diarrheic disease within 48 h post infection in the intramuscular Group. Nevertheless, diarrhea clinical signs of the intramuscular Group last longer than that of the oral group with more severe degree of clinical signs including diarrhea and loss of weight. Previous studies reported that the intestinal proteases are critical for PEDV release rather and entry Shirato et al., 2011) . When infecting piglets by the oral route, the virus could target to intestine through the digestive tract directly, and the intestinal proteases might lead to the earlier appearance of clinical signs by better aiding the viral release (Wicht et al., 2014) . It has been reported that PEDV could invade the blood stream, but it fails to replicate actively there, and the viraemia levels may not necessarily be connected to virulence or pathogenicity with mechanisms not fully understood . Moreover, a recent study demonstrated that the PEDV particles could be recognized and presented by DCs of nasal epithelial cells and then delivered to CD3 + T cells of cervical lymph node, reaching the intestine through the blood and lymph circulation to infect the intestinal epithelial cells . This report may support our study that intramuscular injection of PEDV could also cause the typical clinical signs to piglets, although the specific molecular mechanisms remain to be elucidated.

As is known to all, fecal-oral transmission is the main natural route of PEDV for infection, so it is much easier for the virus to simulate this progress by oral inoculation. However, compared with the intramuscular injection, the oral inoculation is supposed to be unstable and require stricter operation, because part of the virus would be lost during the infection due to the uncertain in vivo conditions of piglets. Therefore, intramuscular injection exhibited basically the same efficiency to cause obvious clinical signs, despite slight delay of clinical signs at the initial phase of infection. This finding supports the idea that intramuscular injection of live, attenuated PEDV may be an alternative vaccination route. In conclusion, we analyzed the genetic variation and pathogenicity of the emerging PEDV isolates of China, indicating that G2 variant PEDV strains as the main prevalent strains continue to mutate along with time. The variant strain FJzz1 with mutations in the S protein is highly pathogenic to the piglets, and the intramuscular injection may also be an alternative inoculation route. This study will provide a basis for understanding of the genetic variation and pathogenicity of PEDV.",
