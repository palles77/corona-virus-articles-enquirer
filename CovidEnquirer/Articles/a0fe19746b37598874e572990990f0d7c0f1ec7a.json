[1] [2] [3] The relatively immature immune system of these young infants predisposes them to developing invasive bacterial illnesses such as bacteremia and bacterial meningitis, and many also develop urinary tract infections (UTIs). Collectively, these 3 infections are referred to as serious bacterial infections (SBIs). Expert guidance for management includes obtaining blood screening tests, which may include a white blood cell count, absolute neutrophil count (ANC), band count, and serum procalcitonin and C-reactive protein concentrations, in addition to urinalysis and evaluation of the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF), as well as cultures of these fluids.

[4] [5] [6] Owing to widespread availability of rapid turnaround and point-of-care testing for viral infections, many clinicians are less likely to perform comprehensive evaluations for SBI in the presence of confirmed viral infections, because the risk of SBI has been shown to be lower among infants who come to attention because of fever and are confirmed to have viral infection. 7, 8, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] However, most previous studies that have attempted to determine the risk of SBI among young febrile infants with viral infections have been conducted on small cohorts, 8 had retrospective study designs, 11, 12 were limited to a single viral infection, and/or were performed more than a decade ago. 8, 11, 12, 14, 15 In this planned subanalysis of a large, multicenter, prospective cohort study of febrile infants 60 days and younger evaluated for SBIs, we compared the risk of SBIs between viruspositive and virus-negative infants.",

However, when any of these cultures was positive, the patient was considered to have an SBI. We defined bacteremia and bacterial meningitis as growth of a known pathogen in the blood or CSF, respectively. Patients who did not have lumbar punctures performed were included in the analysis for bacterial meningitis if they were available for telephone follow-up. We categorized these patients as not having bacterial meningitis if they were well at the time of telephone follow-up. Cultures with growth of multiple bacteria or those not commonly considered pathogens (eg, coagulase-negative Staphylococcus, diphtheroids, Bacillus species, viridans streptococci) were categorized as contaminants and considered negative for the analysis of SBI. We defined UTI as the growth of a single pathogen in the urine with colony counts meeting 1 of 3 criteria: (1) greater than 1000 cfu/mL if specimen obtained by suprapubic aspiration, (2) greater than 50 000 cfu/mL from a catheterized specimen, or (3) greater than 10 000 cfu/mL from a catheterized specimen in association with an abnormal urinalysis (positive for leukocyte esterase or nitrites, or >5 white blood cells per high-power field on microscopic examination of unspun urine). 18, 19 We also categorized febrile infants for the purpose of analysis on the basis of results of viral tests as virus positive or virus negative.",

A previous multicenter, prospective study in febrile infants 60 days old and younger with and without documented RSV infections revealed UTI and bacteremia rates of 7.0% and 1.1%, respectively, in RSV-positive infants compared with 12.5% and 2.3% in RSV-negative infants. 14 In a separate subanalysis of that same cohort, a lower rate of SBI and invasive bacterial infection was also documented when influenza-positive febrile infants were compared with those infants without documented influenza infections, 15 similar to the findings of the current study. Other studies using retrospective cohorts similarly revealed a lower prevalence of SBI among virus-positive febrile infants. [7] [8] [9] 11 The substantial practice pattern variation that exists in the evaluation of young febrile infants has been influenced by the increasing availability of multiplex panel, rapid turnaround viral tests. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] Some studies have revealed that providers frequently change their behavior when they are aware of the results of viral tests. 20, 25 Furthermore, virus-positive febrile infants are less likely to receive empiric antibiotics or to be hospitalized and are more likely to receive antiviral therapies. [20] [21] [22] A recent survey of ED and inpatient clinicians in 16 Canadian pediatric centers using a 3-week-old and a 5-week-old febrile infant case scenarios further highlights the substantial variation in the evaluation and management of febrile infants based on the results of viral tests. Surveyed hospitalization rates for the 3-week-old infant after detection of a respiratory virus decreased from 95% to 83% (P < .001) and for the 5-week-old The percentages in the columns represent the proportion of infants with the type of SBIs stratified by age category and by individual type of SBI.",

Treatment with empirical antibiotics also decreased after detection of a respiratory virus for the 3-week-old infant (92% vs 65%; P < .001) and the 5-week-old infant (39% vs 25%; P < .001). 20 Despite the lower prevalence of SBI among virus-positive febrile infants documented in the current and earlier studies, the implications for clinicians are not straightforward. Some investigators have suggested that the performance of comprehensive evaluations for SBI, especially lumbar punctures, can be avoided 26 in the presence of a documented viral infection in a well-appearing young febrile infant and the use of empiric antibiotics and hospitalization can be reconsidered. 27 Others have suggested that practices should be based on the age of the infant, with a full evaluation for SBI including lumbar puncture in the first month of life despite the presence of a viral infection, because SBI rates remain non-negligible in this highest risk age group and the ability to determine wellness by the YOS is limited. 14, 15, 24 Our study findings add to the current knowledge regarding the epidemiology of SBI as well as the risk of SBI among virus-positive febrile infants. The strengths of the current study include a large, geographically diverse, prospective cohort of febrile infants who were comprehensively evaluated for SBI, and our risk estimates for SBI were therefore more precise and generalizable than in previous studies. Furthermore, we did not limit our study to a single virus or individual viral illnesses, such as bronchiolitis or influenza.",

Finally, our study suggests the importance of incorporating the results of viral testing to provide better risk estimates of SBI in these infants and assist the clinician with decisions regarding lumbar puncture, empirical antibiotic treatment, and hospitalization.

            "text": "Our study has several limitations. First, the parent study cohort consisted of a convenience sample of febrile infants and viral testing was performed at the discretion of the treating clinician during a time in which rapid testing was evolving. Furthermore, the number of viruses detectable and type of tests performed varied between sites (1) by season, (2) by type of test, namely, polymerase chain reaction vs other, (3) whether single viral tests or multiplex viral polymerase chain reaction panel tests were performed, (4) by type of specimen (nasal swab vs throat swab), and (5) by what tissue or fluid was sampled (CSF vs blood vs respiratory secretions). It is possible that the rates of SBI and the prevalence of viral infections detected would be different if comprehensive viral testing was performed on all patients or if higher sensitivity and specificity viral testing was used. Therefore, we cannot comment on the exact prevalence of viral infections in our study cohort. However, if higher, some of the current virus-negative patients with SBIs may have been virus positive with SBIs, and could have increased the rate of coinfection, thus, strengthening our conclusions. In addition, it is possible that the risk of SBI may vary with the type of viral infection and with the number of viral coinfections. 20 Despite these limitations, the rate of SBI in the enrolled population was remarkably similar to that described in previous studies. 28, 29 Second, we intentionally excluded febrile infants with obvious sources of bacterial infections (such as cellulitis) and critically ill-appearing infants because those infants represent a less significant diagnostic and therapeutic conundrum. The purpose of our study was to identify the risk of SBI in noncritically ill-appearing febrile infants who have confirmed viral infections to aid clinician decision making. Third, the analysis in which we stratified by type of viral infection did not have sufficient power to detect statistically significant differences in the risk of SBI by virus type; nevertheless, the results are hypothesis generating. Despite the substantial size and multicenter design of the study, we also did not have sufficient statistical power to comment on the risk difference in bacterial meningitis between virus-positive and virus-negative infants. Therefore, we suggest that clinicians retain low thresholds for performing lumbar punctures in young febrile infants with documented viral infections, especially those younger than 1 month of age. In addition, most of the EDs in PECARN are large, tertiary care, academic institutions and practice patterns including testing for viral pathogens as well as evaluation for SBI may not be representative of practice patterns in community EDs or primary care pediatric offices. 27 Finally, the American Academy of Pediatrics has proposed an updated definition of UTI that requires the presence of an abnormal urinalysis and a positive urine culture defined as at least 50 000 cfu/ mL of a pathogenic bacterium. 30 We did not use this definition in our study cohort because these guidelines apply to infants older than 2 months of age.",

Therefore, we concluded that the presence of a documented viral illness should not affect the initial (ED) evaluation for SBI in febrile infants 28 days of age and younger.
