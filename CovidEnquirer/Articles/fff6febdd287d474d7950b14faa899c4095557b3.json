The vigorous ethical debates do nothing for the anguish of surrogates caught in the maze of \"full code\" and \"DNR\" designations in the hospital.

One often hears of the \"illegality\" of discontinuing mechanical ventilation in dying patients! Yet, with few support systems, these interventions may be stopped abruptly after the financial ruin of the families. Unfortunately, the immorality of such practices is rarely questioned. Decision making in these highly paternalistic medical systems requires some scrutiny. I feel that we have an obligation to our colleagues in less affluent societies. A universal ethical code for the use of life-support technology in this young century is a laudable goal. 1, 6 Vietnam, Singapore, 2 and Canada. 3 The index patients of these cities had been exposed to the Guangdong physician while they were visiting China or had been staying on the same floor of the same hotel. While investigating the outbreak of SARS in Hanoi, Dr. Carlo Urbani unfortunately contracted the disease and died. SARS appears to spread by close person-to-person contact via droplet transmission or fomite. 7 The high level of infectivity of this viral illness is highlighted by the fact that 158 patients were hospitalized with SARS within 2 weeks as a result of exposure to one single patient on a general medical ward in Hong Kong. The use of a jet nebulizer for administering bronchodilators to the index case, who presented clinically with community-acquired pneumonia, could increase the droplet load around the patient and, together with the overcrowding condition on the hospital ward, had contributed to this major hospital outbreak. 1 A novel coronavirus (CoV) is now identified as the main pathogen responsible for SARS, 8 -11 although the presence of a metapneumovirus also was inferred in studies from Canada 11 and Hong Kong. 1 Several laboratories have recently completed the sequencing of the genome of the CoV that has led to the global epidemic of SARS, and they have noted that the SARS-CoV is not closely related to any of the previously characterized CoVs. [12] [13] [14] Clinical and Laboratory Features The mean incubation period of SARS is estimated to be 6.4 days (95% confidence interval, 5.2 to 7.7), and the mean time from onset of clinical symptoms to hospital admission varied between 3 and 5 days. 15 The major clinical features on presentation include persistent fever, chills/rigor, myalgia, dry cough, headache, and dizziness. Less common symptoms include sputum production, sore throat, coryza, nausea and vomiting, and diarrhea. 1-3 Watery diarrhea has been reported in a subgroup of patients 1 week down the clinical course. This was reported in a cohort infected in a community outbreak that has been linked to a faulty sewage system, presumably due to involvement of the GI tract via the fecal-oral route. 16 Lymphopenia (ie, the destruction of both CD4 and CD8 lymphocytes), features of low-grade disseminated intravascular coagulation (ie, thrombocytopenia, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time, and elevated d-dimer levels), and elevated lactate dehydrogenase levels (reflecting lung injury) and creatinine kinase levels (reflecting myositis) are common laboratory features of SARS. [1] [2] [3] 8, 11 The clinical course of SARS appears to follow a triphasic pattern. Phase 1 (viral replication) is associated with increasing viral load and is clinically characterized by fever, myalgia, and other systemic symptoms that generally improve after a few days. Phase 2 (immunopathologic damage) is characterized by the recurrence of fever, oxygen desaturation, and radiologic progression of pneumonia with falls in viral load. The majority of patients will respond to treatment with a combination of ribavirin and IV steroids, but 20% of patients may progress into the phase 3, which is characterized by ARDS necessitating ventilatory support. 16 Compared with adults and teenagers, SARS seems to run a less aggressive clinical course in younger children, with no children in one case series 17 requiring supplementary oxygen.",

            "text": "The radiographic appearances of SARS share features in common with other causes of pneumonia. At fever onset, almost 80% of patients with SARS have abnormal chest radiographs, all of which show airspace consolidation. All patients will eventually develop airway opacities during the course of the disease. In our study, the opacities occupy a peripheral or mixed peripheral and axial location in 88% of patients. 18 The predominant involvement of the lung periphery and the lower zone, in addition to the absence of cavitation, hilar lymphadenopathy, or pleural effusion, are the more distinctive radiographic features of SARS. 1,18 Radiographic progression from unilateral focal airspace opacity to either multifocal or bilateral involvement during the second week of the disease course, followed by radiographic improvement with treatment, is commonly encountered. 1, 18 In one case series, 16 12% of patients developed spontaneous pneumomediastinum and 20% of patients developed evidence of ARDS over a period of 3 weeks. In general, the incidence of barotrauma in ICU admissions seems higher than expected despite treatment with low-volume and low-pressure mechanical ventilation. Chest radiographs and CT scans have not demonstrated excessive hyperinflation or bullous lung disease, and it is difficult to explain this observation. 19 High-resolution CT scanning of the thorax is useful in detecting lung opacities in patients with unremarkable chest radiograph findings. Common findings include ground-glass opacification, sometimes with consolidation, and interlobular septal and intralobular interstitial thickening, with predominantly peripheral and lower lobe involvement. The characteristic peripheral alveolar opacities are very similar to those found in patients with bronchiolitis obliterans-organizing pneumonia. 1, 19 The postmortem examination of lung tissues in SARS patients has shown various levels of disease severity. Changes include gross consolidation of the lungs, the presence of interstitial mononuclear inflammatory infiltrates, desquamation of pneumocytes in alveolar spaces, pulmonary edema with hyaline membrane formation, and cellular fibromyxoid-orga-nizing exudates in airspaces, indicating the organizing phase of alveolar damage.
