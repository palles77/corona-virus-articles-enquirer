Cytostatic activity evaluation of the novel compounds showed that E-isomers exhibited, in general, better cytostatic activities than the corresponding Z-isomers. E-isomer 14 exhibited the best cytostatic effect against all evaluated malignant cell lines, particularly against hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep G2, IC 50 = 4.3 lM). However, this compound was also cytotoxic to human normal fibroblasts (WI 38). Its Z-isomer 7 showed highly specific antiproliferative activity against Hep G2 (IC 50 = 18 lM) and no cytotoxicity to WI 38. Moreover, compounds 3, 4 and 14 expressed some marginal inhibitory activity against HIV-1 and HIV-2.",

            "text": "Many nucleoside analogues with interesting biological properties have arisen by substitution at the 5-position of the uracil base in the 2 0 -deoxyuridine series. 1 Pyrimidine nucleosides containing C-5 alkynyl groups have been shown to possess significant antiviral and/or anticancer properties. 2 The 5-alkynyluracil nucleosides with a longer alkynyl chain at the C-5 position expressed appreciable antiviral activity in contrast to the corresponding alkyl derivatives that showed decreasing antiviral activity with increasing C-5 side chain length. [2] [3] [4] [5] Introduction of very rigid allenic moiety as a linker between the heterocyclic base and hydroxymethyl group led to compounds such as adenallene and cytallene which effectively inhibited the replication of HIV. 6 Fur-thermore, thymine with a 2-butenyl spacer was the first acyclic nucleoside analogue exhibiting potent inhibition of thymidine kinase 2 (TK-2) which catalyzes phosphorylation of certain antiviral drugs. 7 We have reported that some pyrimidines and purines containing c-(Z)-ethylidene-2,3-dibenzylbutenolide exhibited antiproliferative effects against malignant human tumour cell lines. [8] [9] [10] The C-5 alkynyl substituted pyrimidine derivatives of L L-ascorbic acid had some, although slight, inhibitory potency against cytomegalovirus (CMV) and varicella-zoster virus (VZV). 11 The 5propynyl uracil derivative of L L-ascorbic acid showed pronounced cytostatic activity against cervical carcinoma (HeLa). 12 We have also reported that the (Z)-4amino-2-butenyladenine nucleoside analogue showed selective activity against HIV-1. 13 These results prompted us to synthesize a series of the novel (Z)and (E)-2-butenyl-N-phthalimido pyrimidines containing an alkynyl longer side chain at C-5 (1-14) (Fig. 1 ) and evaluate their cytostatic and anti-HIV potency in cell culture.",

[15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] It is important to note that this reaction was performed at room temperature in order to avoid the formation of bicyclic furopyrimidine co-products produced by heating the reaction mixture. Reaction of the (Z)-and (E)-1-[4 0 -(N-phthalimido)-2 0 -butenyl]-5-iodouracil with various terminal alkynes in the presence of palladium(0) catalyst and copper(I) iodide as co-catalyst in DMF at room temperature gave 5-substituted Z-and E-uracil derivatives 1-7 and 8-14 (Scheme 1).",

H1 0 and H4 0 protons exhibit distinct chemical shifts between 4.09 and 4.60 ppm, whereas H2 0 and H3 0 protons along C@C double bond were observed between 5.50 and 5.80 ppm (Table 1) . Chemical shifts of phenyl protons are between 7.1 and 7.53 ppm, while phthalimido protons are between 7.8 and 7.9 ppm. H6 chemical shifts were found in the range from 7.82 to 8.47 ppm and H3 protons in the range from 11.33 to 11.73 ppm. The configuration along C2 0 @C3 0 double bond was evaluated through 3 J H2 0 H3 0 coupling constants ( Table 1) . The values of all coupling constants involved in the six spin system of N1-substituent including 3 J H2 0 H3 0 had to be determined through simulation due to small Dd/J ratios. As an example of our simulations, multiplets of H2 0 and H3 0 in 14 are compared to the experimental spectrum in Figure 3 . Vinyl 4 J H1 0 H3 0 and 4 J H2 0 H4 0 couplings were below signal half width (<1 Hz). Smaller 3 J H2 0 H3 0 coupling constants of 10.6, 10.6 and 11.1 Hz in 2, 3 and 7, respectively, are in accordance with Z-isomers along C2 0 @C3 0 double bonds.

Furthermore, introduction of the phenyl ring in longer side chain caused an increasing cytostatic effect. Thus, the C-5 pentylphenylethynyl substituted olefinic pyrimidine derivative 14 showed the most pronounced inhibitory activity against all the tested tumour cell lines (IC 50 = 4.3-39 lM), including human normal fibroblasts. On the contrary, its Z-isomer (7) showed selective inhibitory activity against the Hep G2 cell line (IC 50 = 18 lM). Thus, the results of the cytostatic examinations indicated that compounds 7 and 14 are suitable candidates for further biological studies on lead drug and structural optimization. Figure 5 . Dose-response curves of the tested compounds 1-14 on hepatocellular carcinoma (Hep G2). 24 the panel cell lines were inoculated onto a series of standard 96-well microtiter plates on day 0 at 1 \u00b7 10 4 to 3 \u00b7 10 4 cells/mL, depending on the doubling times of specific cell line. Test agents were then added in five, 10-fold dilutions (10 \u00c08 to 10 \u00c04 M) and incubated for further 72 h. Working dilu-tions were freshly prepared on the day of testing. The compounds were prepared as 0.04 M solutions in DMSO, and the solvent was also tested for eventual inhibitory activity by adjusting its concentration to be the same as in the working concentrations. After 72 h of incubation the cell growth rate was evaluated by performing the MTT assay (Sigma) which detects dehydrogenase activity in viable cells. The MTT Cell Proliferation Assay is a colorimetric assay system, which measures the reduction of a tetrazolium component (MTT) into an insoluble formazan product by the mitochondria of viable cells. For this purpose, the substancetreated medium was discarded and MTT was added to each well at a concentration of 20 lg/40 lL. After 4 h of incubation the precipitates were dissolved in 160 lL of DMSO. The absorbance (OD, optical density) was measured on a microplate reader at 570 nm. The absorbancy is directly proportional to the cell viability. The percentage of growth (PG) of the cell lines was calculated according to one or the other of the following two expressions:",
