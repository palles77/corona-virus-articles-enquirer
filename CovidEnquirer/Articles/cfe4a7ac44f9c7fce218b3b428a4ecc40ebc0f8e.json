            "text": "The effects of a number of vaccination strategies on the spread of an SIR type disease are numerically investigated for several common network topologies including random, scale-free, small world, and meta-random networks. These strategies, namely, prioritized, random, follow links and contact tracing, are compared across networks using extensive simulations with disease parameters relevant for viruses such as pandemic influenza H1N1/09. Two scenarios for a network SIR model are considered. First, a model with a given transmission rate is studied. Second, a model with a given initial growth rate is considered, because the initial growth rate is commonly used to impute the transmission rate from incidence curves and to predict the course of an epidemic. Since a vaccine may not be readily available for a new virus, the case of a delay in the start of vaccination is also considered in addition to the case of no delay. It is found that network topology can have a larger impact on the spread of the disease than the choice of vaccination strategy. Simulations also show that the network structure has a large effect on both the course of an epidemic and the determination of the transmission rate from the initial growth rate. The effect of delay in the vaccination start time varies tremendously with network topology. Results show that, without the knowledge of network topology, predictions on the peak and the final size of an epidemic cannot be made solely based on the initial exponential growth rate or transmission rate. This demonstrates the importance of understanding the topology of realistic contact networks when evaluating vaccination strategies.",

The advantage of a homogeneous mixing model is that it lends itself relatively well to analysis and therefore is a good starting point. Due to the homogeneity assumption, these models predict that the fraction of the population that needs to be vaccinated to curtail an epidemic is equal to 1\u00c01=R 0 , where R 0 is the basic reproduction number (the average number of secondary infections caused by a typical infectious individual in a fully susceptible population). However, the homogeneous mixing assumption poorly reflects the actual interactions within a population, since, for example, school children and office co-workers spend significant amounts of time in close proximity and therefore are much more likely to infect each other than an elderly person who mostly stays at home. Consequently, efforts have been made to incorporate the network structure into models, where individuals are represented by nodes and contacts are presented by edges. In the context of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), it was shown by Meyers et al. (2005) that the incorporation of contact networks may yield different epidemic outcomes even for the same basic reproduction number R 0 . For pandemic influenza H1N1/09, Pourbohloul et al. (2009) and Davoudi et al. (2012) used network theory to obtain a real time estimate for R 0 . Numerical simulations have shown that different networks can yield distinct disease spread patterns; see, for example, Bansal et al. (2007) , Miller et al. (2012) , and Section 7.6 in Keeling and Rohani (2008) . To illustrate this difference for the networks and parameters we use, the effect of different networks on disease dynamics is shown in Fig. 1 . Descriptions of these networks are given in Section 2 and Appendix B.",

For example, Volz (2008) used a generating function formalism (an alternate derivation with a simpler system of equations was recently found by Miller, 2011) , while we used the degree distribution in the effective degree model presented in Lindquist et al. (2011) . In these models, the degree distribution is the key network characteristic for disease dynamics. From recent efforts (Ma et al., 2013; Volz et al., 2011; Moreno et al., 2003; on incorporating degree correlation and clustering (such as households and offices) into epidemic models, it has been found that these may significantly affect the disease dynamics for networks with identical degree distributions. Fig. 2 shows disease dynamics on networks with identical degree distribution and disease parameters, but with different network topologies. Clearly, reliable predictions of the epidemic process that only use the degree distribution are not possible without knowledge of the network topology. Such predictions need to be checked by considering other topological properties of the network.",

(2006) compared the efficacy of contact tracing on random and scale-free networks and found that for transmission rates greater than a certain threshold, the final epidemic size is smaller on a scale-free network than on a corresponding random network, while they considered the effects of degree correlations in Kiss et al. (2008) . Cohen et al. (2003) (see also Madar et al., 2004) considered different vaccination strategies on scale-free networks and found that acquaintance immunization is remarkably effective. Miller and Hyman (2007) considered several vaccination strategies on a simulation of the population of Portland Oregon, USA, and found it to be most effective to vaccinate nodes with the most unvaccinated susceptible contacts, although they found that this strategy may not be practical because it requires considerable computational resources and information about the network. Bansal et al. (2006) took a contact network using data from Vancouver, BC, Canada, considered two vaccination strategies, namely mortality-and morbidity-based, and investigated the detrimental effect of vaccination delays. and found that, on realistic contact networks, vaccination strategies based on detailed network topology information generally outperform random vaccination.",

First, various network topologies are considered with the disease parameters constant, assuming that these have been independently estimated. Second, different network topologies are used to fit to the observed incidence curve (number of new infections in each day), so that their disease parameters are different yet they all line up to the same initial exponential growth phase of the epidemic.",

To this end, we compute the incidence curves and reductions in final sizes (total number of infections during the course of the epidemic) due to vaccination. For the homogeneous mixing model, these scenarios are identical (Ma and Earn, 2006) , but as will be shown, when taking topology into account, they are completely different. We end with conclusions in Section 5. . On all networks, the average degree is 5, the population size is 200,000, the transmission rate is 0.06, the recovery rate is 0.2, and the initial number of infectious individuals is set to 100.

In Section 3, we use this transmission rate to compare the incidence curves for the networks in Table 1 with the vaccination strategies in Table 3 . Some of the most readily available data in an epidemic are the number of reported new cases per day. These cases generally display exponential growth in the initial phase of an epidemic and a suitable model therefore needs to match this initial growth pattern. The exponential growth rates are commonly used to estimate disease parameters (Chowell et al., 2007; Lipsitch et al., 2003) . In Section 4, we consider the effects of various network topologies on the effectiveness of vaccination strategies for epidemics with a fixed exponential growth rate. The basic reproduction number R 0 \u00bc 1:5 and the recovery rate g \u00bc 0:2 yield an exponential growth rate l \u00bc t\u00c0g \u00bc 0:1 for the homogeneous mixing SIR model.

The transmission rates b are as indicated in Table 7 , while the remaining parameters are identical to those in Fig. 6 . network topologies, diseases respond differently to parameter changes. For example, on the random network, a higher transmission rate yields a much shorter epidemic, whereas on the metarandom network, it yields a longer one with a more drastic increase in final size. These differences are caused by the spatial structures in the meta-random network. Considering that a metarandom network is a random network of random networks, it is likely that the meta-random network represents a general population better than a random network. For a fixed exponential growth rate, the transmission rate needed on the scale-free network to yield the given initial growth rate is the smallest, being about half that of the random and the meta-random networks. Hence, the per-link transmission probability is the lowest on the scale-free network, which in turn yields a small epidemic final size.",

Our network is constructed with the help of preferential attachment, but two modifications are made in order to render the scale-free network more comparable with the other networks investigated here. First, the maximum degree is limited to M not by restricting the degree from the outset but by first creating a scale-free network and then pruning all the nodes with a degree larger than M. Second, the number of links attached to each new node is either two or three dependent on a certain probability that is set such that after pruning the average degree is very close to that of the random network (i.e. /kS \u00bc 5).",

This is basically also the way the small world network used here is generated. The only modification is that the coupling range (i.e. the number of neighbors linked to) is randomly varied between 2 and 3 in order to obtain an average degree equal to that of the random network (i.e. /kS \u00bc 5). We also use periodic boundary conditions, which as such is not necessary for a small world network but is commonly done.",
