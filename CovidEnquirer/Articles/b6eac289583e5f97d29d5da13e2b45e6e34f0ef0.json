The mortality was also higher, but the difference was not statistically significant. On multivariate analysis, hemoglobin level was an independent prognostic correlate of hypoxemia or mortality (odds ratio, 2.0; 95% confidence interval, 1.1 to 3.8; p \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.03). The hemoglobin began decreasing in two thirds of SARS patients (32 of 44 patients; 73%) who were receiving ribavirin 3 days after therapy with the antiviral drug was started. Patients with a drop in hemoglobin level of > 2 g/dL had a significantly higher mortality rate than the other patients. Hypoxemia developed in one third of SARS patients (17 of 44 patients; 39%) who were receiving ribavirin, all of whom were anemic. Of the 17 hypoxemic patients, 11 (65%) had a drop in hemoglobin of > 2 g/dL, and 4 patients (24%) required a blood transfusion. The mean slope of the hemoglobin decrease was significantly steeper (p \u202b\u060d\u202c 0.001) in hypoxemic patients with SARS who were receiving ribavirin than in the nonhypoxemic patients with SARS who were receiving ribavirin. Only one of seven SARS patients (14%) who was not receiving ribavirin became anemic, but this individual was not hypoxemic. Eventually, 5 of 17 hypoxemic and anemic SARS patients (29%) who were receiving ribavirin died. The combination of hypoxia with anemia was thus significantly associated with a higher mortality (p < 0.001). Conclusions: Hypoxia combined with anemia increased the risk for death in SARS patients. Unless ribavirin can be shown to be effective against SARS-coronavirus, the risk of anemia posed by this drug argues against its use in SARS patients. (CHEST 2005; 128:263-272) ",

During the outbreak in Taiwan, patients who were suspected of having SARS were randomly sent to designated hospitals by the Department of Health. There was therefore no particular bias as to where the patients were seen. A standard treatment protocol including ribavirin, which was recommended by the Taiwan Center for Disease Control, was used in 44 patients at Mackay Memorial Hospital (hospital M). Another seven patients from Chang Gung Memorial Hospital (hospital C) received similar treatment with the exception of ribavirin, allowing a comparison of patients treated with and without ribavirin (Fig 1) . All patients were confirmed to have SARS-CoV infection by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction or real-time polymerase chain reaction on throat or nasopharyngeal swabs on at least two different occasions. The study population thus consisted of 44 SARS patients who were receiving ribavirin and 7 SARS patients who were not receiving ribavirin.",

In SARS patients receiving ribavirin, 10 patients already had multifocal infiltrates at hospital admission. Of the other 34 patients for whom the time course of radiograph abnormalities could be ascertained, 24 patients (71%) had unifocal airspace infiltrates and 10 patients (39%) had multifocal infiltrates appearing on FD 3 to 6. In SARS patients who were not receiving ribavirin, four of six patients (67%) had unifocal infiltrates and two of six patients (33%) had multifocal infiltrates, appearing on FD 2 to 6, respectively. Eventually, all SARS patients studied had pulmonary infiltrates, mostly diffuse, that progressed from FD 9 to 14.",

Hypoxemia was less common, with 17 of 44 patients (39%) who were receiving ribavirin and 1 of 7 patients (14%) who were not receiving ribavirin becoming hypoxemic during hospitalization. Perhaps the most striking finding among the patients who were receiving ribavirin was the number of deaths (5 of 17 patients; 29%) in hypoxemic, anemic patients, compared with that among patients who were not hypoxemic (0 of 27 patients). About half of patients in the latter group (15 of 27 patients) were anemic, although the mean hemoglobin level for the nonhypoxemic group as a whole remained normal or near-normal throughout the hospitalization. Only one of the seven patients who were not receiving ribavirin became hypoxemic, but this patient was not anemic (Fig 1) . It is not possible to prove to what extent the anemia observed in this series was caused by ribavirin. However, it is reasonable to assume that a drug known to cause anemia may have contributed in part to the drop in hemoglobin. Symptoms of SARS developed sequentially, beginning with fever, then cough, diarrhea, and eventually dyspnea. 21, 22 Pulmonary infiltrates appeared on chest radiographs in our patients at an average of FD 3 to 6 and were accompanied by respiratory symp-toms. Ribavirin therapy was begun at a mean of FD 6.0 \u03ee 2.6 and was given for a total of 11.5 \u03ee 3.0 days. Over two thirds of patients (32 of 44 patients) with SARS had a decrease in hemoglobin beginning 3 days after ribavirin was started, or about FD 9. This coincided with the progression in some patients to diffuse pulmonary infiltrates and hypoxemia at a mean of FD 10.4 \u03ee 1.6, which is presumably part of the natural course of SARS. Thus, reduced oxygencarrying capacity, most likely related at least in part to treatment with ribavirin, was superimposed on hypoxemia secondary to SARS-CoV-induced lung pathology. This was a dangerous combination that was associated with a higher risk of death.",

Anemic patients with pulmonary disease develop dyspnea, tachypnea, and severe hypoxia more easily than patients with a normal hemoglobin level. Global tissue hypoxia is an independent risk factor for microcirculatory failure, organ dysfunction, poor outcome, and death. 29 Early goal-directed therapy carried out by maintaining central venous oxygen saturation at \u0546 70% with blood transfusion and providing O 2 supplementation has been shown to decrease mortality significantly in critically ill patients. 29 In our S-R-H patients, hypoxemia developed coincidentally with a fall in hemoglobin levels, so it is perhaps not surprising that they had a worse outcome than others in this series.

For better or worse, this is the case with most of the literature on SARS. Faced with a previously unknown disease with substantial mortality, there was no opportunity to perform prospective randomized trials. The best that could be done was to try to understand the pathology induced by the virus and then design therapy that might theoretically help. If SARS does not reemerge, we will probably never be able to develop enough evidence to give clear guidance on treatment. The best we can do at this point is to work in retrospect with the limited data we have.",

Regardless of its cause, anemia increases the risk of death in hypoxemic patients. Given the well-established AE of anemia in some patients who have been treated with ribavirin, the drug should be used only if a considerable benefit of the treatment outweighs the risk posed by druginduced anemia. Such a benefit has not yet been demonstrated in patients who have been infected with SARS-CoV. Until it is, it might be better to forgo the use of ribavirin in SARS patients.",
