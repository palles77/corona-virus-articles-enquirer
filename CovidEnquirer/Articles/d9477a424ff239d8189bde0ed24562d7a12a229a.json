(1990) Virol. 177, 768-771). The 3'-non-coding segment of 80 nucleotides of the two LDV genomes is identical, whereas marked, but varying nucleotide and amino acid divergence is apparent in the three upstream overlapping open reading frames (ORF). The third ORF from the 3'-end exhibits only 82% nucleotide and 90% amino acid identity, whereas the 3'-terminal ORF, which encodes the nucleocapsid protein, exhibits approximately 99% amino acid identity. The second 3'-terminal ORF encodes an 18.8 kDa protein which lacks N-glycosylation sites but possesses 2 or 3 potential transmembrane helices in the N-terminal half of the molecule. A similar membrane organization is observed for the corresponding protein of equine arteritis virus and the M protein of mouse hepatitis virus. The sequence analyses combined with Northern hybridization analyses of RNA from LDV-infected macrophages and spleens of LDV-infected mice indicate that the three ORFs encoded by the 3'-terminal end of the LDV genome are expressed via the three smallest mRNAs (mRNAs 6-8) of the seven subgenomic mRNAs of LDV (mRNAs 2-81, which range in size from about 0.8 to",

            "text": "Lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) is a member of a new group of positive-stranded RNA viruses (Plagemann and Moennig, 1992) . Other members of the group are equine arteritis virus (EAV) and most likely simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV). On the basis of virion structure and size (50-60 nm diameter) and the polarity and size (12-13 kb) of their RNA genomes, LDV and EAV have been tentatively placed in the Togar!iridae and SHFV in the Flaui~Cdae (Westaway et al., 1985a,bl . However, recent studies have shown that in genome organization and mode of replication, EAV (den Boon et al., 1991) and LDV (Godeny et al., 1989 (Godeny et al., , 1990 ; Kuo et al., 1991) resemble coronaviruses and toroviruses. Their genomes are expressed via formation of a 3'-coterminal nested set of 6 or 7 subgenomic mRNAs. The smallest mRNA of EAV and LDV encodes VP-l, the nucleocapsid protein. LDV, EAV and SHFV share other properties (see Plagemann and Moennig, 1992) . The 3'-end of the genomes of all three viruses are polyadenylated and their virions are composed of three proteins of similar size: VP-l (12-14 kDa); VP-2, a non-glycosylated envelope protein of 17-19 kDa; and VP-3, a group of glycosylated envelope proteins that range in size from 25-44 kDa. VP-3 of LDV probably represents a single gene product that varies in size due to different extents of glycosylation, but the presence of more than one structural glycoprotein has not been ruled out (Plagemann and Moennig, 1992) . Other shared properties of LDV, EAV and SHFV are that they replicate primarily in macrophages and that all three can cause long term persistent infections without clinical symptoms in their natural hosts. LDV, for example, invariably establishes a viremic, life-long asymptomatic infection in all strains of mice. The persistent infection is maintained by the cytocidal replication of LDV in a renewable subpopulation of macrophages that seems to be the only permissive cell type in the host (Plagemann and Moennig, 1992; Onyekaba et al., 1989 ). In the present study, we have further characterized the mRNAs formed in LDV-infected macrophage cultures and mice infected with three isolates of LDV that differ greatly in neurovirulence, and we have identified a 5'-leader that is associated with all mRNAs. We also present the sequence of the 3'-terminal 1314 nucleotides of the genome of one isolate of LDV (LDV-P) that encodes three overlapping open reading frames (QRFs) and have compared its most 3'-terminal 1064 nucleotide sequence with that reported for another more neurovirulent isolate of LDV (LDV-C; Codeny et al., 1990) .",

Each LDV variant was 'cloned' via the end point dilution assay; virus was isolated from a mouse receiving the highest dilution that resulted in infection.

The nucleotide differences in the LDV-P cDNAs did not affect the coding specificities of the overall consensus sequence. It encodes two complete overlapping ORFs (ORFs 1 and 2) and one incomplete ORF (ORF-3) overlapping ORF-2 ( Fig. 1) . ORF-1 and ORF-3 are read in the same frame, whereas ORF-2 is read in another frame. ORF-1 and ORF-2 overlap by four amino acids and ORF-2 and ORF-3 by three amino acids. This arrangement is the same as previously reported for another isolate of LDV, LDV-C (Godeny et al., 1990) .",

            "text": "The following results indicate that the subgenomic mRNAs of LDV also possess a 5'-leader sequence as reported for coronaviruses and EAV. We found that cDNA 4-37 hybridized to all subgenomic RNAs (Fig. 41 , in spite of not exhibiting sequence homology with any of the other cDNAs. A terminal restriction fragment of about 1 kb of cDNA 4-37 also hybridized to all subgenomic RNAs, whereas another cDNA of 812 nucleotides (4-18) that represents the opposite end of cDNA 4-37 hybridized only to genomic RNA (data not shown). This result coupled with the knowledge of the coding sequences of RNAs 6-8 indicates that the restriction fragment of cDNA 4-37 encompasses part of an untranslated leader that is joined to the 5'-end of the bodies of the mRNAs. This conclusion has been confirmed by demonstrating that a genomic segment represented by the 5'-terminal sense strand of cDNA 4-37 becomes linked during mRNA synthesis to the bodies of mRNAs 5, 6 and 8 via a common UAACCA sequence and to mRNA 7 probably via a UAAAACC sequence (Chen et al., in preparation) , which are located upstream of the AUG initiation codons of their respective ORFs. In the case of mRNAs 8 and 7, the junction sequences precede the initiation codons of their ORFs by 104 and 14 nucleotides, respectively (see Fig. 2 ). If we assume that the LDV leader is of about the same size as that of EAV (207 nucleotides) LDV mRNAs 8 and 7 should be about 770 and 1150 nucleotides long, respectively. The sizes of mRNAs 8 and 7 estimated from gel electrophoretic profiles (0.8 and 1.3 kb respectively, see Fig. 4 ) agree approximately with the predicted values.",

Video-captured images of the Northern blots of RNA from LDV-infected and uninfected macrophages that were hybridized with the 3'-end-specific RNA probe (Fig. 5B) were scanned for density. The profile for RNA from LDV-infected macrophages was corrected for the profile obtained with RNA from uninfected cells, i.e. for hybridization of the probe to 1.5 and 4.4 kb ribosomal RNAs. Then the area of each peak was integrated and its proportion of the total calculated. These values represent the relative molecular concentrations of each LDV RNA since each RNA possesses only a single copy of the sequence with which the probe hybridizes. This analysis indicated that at 6 h p.i. RNAs 1-8 represented about 13, 5, 5, 8, 6, 11, 11 and 27% of the total LDV-specific RNA. Thus, as observed for coronaviruses and EAV (Spaan et al., 1988; Hoffman et al., 1990; de Vries et al., 19901 , the nucleocapsid mRNA (RNA-8 in the case of LDV) was the predominant RNA molecule synthesized. RNAs 3-5 were produced in similar concentrations and RNAs 6 and 7 in about twice these concentrations. Similar results were obtained in repeated experiments with LDV-P, at least with respect to the relative proportions of RNAs 3-8 (see Figs. 4, 5A and later Fig. 7) . Some variations were observed in the relative proportions of RNAs 1 and 2. The variations in RNA-l, the genomic RNA, we attribute to an inefficiency in the blotting of this relatively large RNA molecule. The variation in the apparent presence of RNA-2 is unclear.",

In the first approach, replicate cultures of LDV-infected macrophages were treated with actinomycin D at various times p.i. and then incubated with [5-3H]uridine for 2 h. Total RNA of the macrophages was extracted with SDS and analyzed by zone sedimentation in sucrose density gradients ( Fig. 6A-E) . The results indicate that little LDV-specific RNA was produced before 4 h p.i., whereas maximum amounts were produced between 6 and 8 h p.i. The results are in agreement with those reported previously using this approach (Stueckemann et al., 1982) . The present results, however, also demonstrate that LDV-specific RNA that sedimented slower than the 42s genomic RNA was produced concomitantly with the latter; it represented about 50% of the total LDV-specific RNA whether the macrophages were incubated with [3H]uridine from 4-6, 6-8 or 8-10 h p.i. This broad band of slower sedimentating RNA probably represented the seven subgenomic LDV mRNAs. Though sucrose density gradient centrifugation does not allow the separation of the individual mRNAs, the radioactivity profiles suggest that all LDV-specific RNA were synthesized at a similar rate. This conclusion is supported by Northern hybridization analyses of RNA extracted from infected macrophages using cDNA 4-55 as a 3'-end specific probe (Figs. 4, 5 and 6F) . All subgenomic RNAs were produced concomitantly in a similar time course. Maximum amounts of LDV RNAs were present at 8 h p.i. The subsequent disappearance of the LDV mRNAs probably reflected degeneration of the LDV-infected macrophages and their phagocytosis by residual macrophages .",

This possibility needed serious consideration since defective interfering RNAs in the molecular weight range of the subgenomic mRNAs arise rapidly in cells during undiluted passage of coronaviruses and toroviruses (van der Most et al., 1991; Makino et al., 1991; Snijder et al., 1991a) and since only six subgenomic RNAs have been detected in cells infected with EAV (den Boon et al., 1991) rather than the seven we find in LDV-P-infected cells. Furthermore, for an efficient infection with LDV, cultured macrophages must be exposed to very high multiplicities of infection (100-1000 mouse ID,,/macrophage; Tong et al., 1977; Onyekaba et al., 1989 ) and stocks of LDV generally consist of plasma harvested from mice 20-24 h p.i. with lo6 ID,,/mouse. However, we detected the same seven subgenomic mRNAs in macrophages infected with LDV-a and LDV-v as in macrophages infected with LDV-P (Fig. 7) . Thus, it seems very unlikely that any of the subgenomic RNAs represents a defective interfering RNA. Furthermore, the subgenomic RNAs induced by the three LDV isolates showed approximately identical rates of migration. Thus, they differed little, if at all, in molecular weight. However, we observed that the relative amounts of the various mRNAs induced by the three LDV isolates differed significantly (Fig. 7) . This difference has been observed in Northern hybridizations of at least two independently prepared RNA samples for each LDV isolate (data not shown). In both instances, the amounts of RNAs 4 and 5 were lower in macrophages infected with LDV-v than with the other two LDV isolates. Whether this difference is related to any specific properties of these LDV variants is not known. All three variants replicate about equally in macrophage cultures, but they differ greatly in neurovirulence for C.58 mice (Murphy et al., 1987; Plagemann and Moennig, 1992) and in antigenic specificity (Cafruny and Plagemann, 1982) . LDV-a is completely avirulent under conditions where the most neurovirulent isolates (LDV-M, LDV-C, LDV-v) cause paralytic disease in close to 100% of infected C58 mice (Plagemann and Moennig, 1992; Anderson, Palmer and Plagemann, unpublished data). Other LDV isolates, such as LDV-P, exhibit an intermediate degree of neurovirulence (see Plagemann and Moennig, 1992) . Furthermore, LDV-M (and other LDV isolates) is only poorly neutralized by polyclonal rabbit anti-LDV antibodies prepared to LDV-P which effectively neutralizes the infectivity of the latter (Cafruny and Plagemann, 1982) . Although the genome organization and expression via a 3'-nested set of mRNAs of LDV and EAV resemble those of the coronaviruses and toroviruses, considerable differences exist between these groups of viruses in these properties. The overlapping organization of the ORFs 1 to 3 of EAV and LDV differs from that of the coronaviruses, which are separated by untranslated intergenic sequences (Spaan et al., 1988; Makino et al., 1991; Snijder et al., 1991b) . The common junction sequences between leader and the bodies of the mRNAs of the coronaviruses also differ from those of LDV and EAV in that they are generally longer, may contain a number of repeats and seem to be more variable for different mRNAs. Also, the leader sequence of EAV and most likely of LDV is 3-4 times larger than those of coronaviruses.",
