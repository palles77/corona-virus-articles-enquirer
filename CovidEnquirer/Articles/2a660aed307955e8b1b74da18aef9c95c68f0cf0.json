A variety of cell types, including macrophages, dendritic cells, monocytes, NK cells, B cells, and T cells, can produce IL-10 ( Moore et al., 2001; Saraiva and O'Garra, 2010; Wack et al., 2011) and the timing of IL-10 production after infection is key: IL-10 production prior to pathogen clearance may facilitate persistent, chronic infection, while delayed IL-10 production may foster immune-mediated pathology (Wack et al., 2011) . Most investigations examining the role of IL-10 during virus infections have focused on persistent infections, but IL-10 production is also important in the pathogenesis of acute virus infections and is produced at the height of the inflammatory response during acute influenza A virus, simian virus 5, and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) infections (Palmer et al., 2010; Puntambekar et al., 2011; Sun et al., 2009; Trandem et al., 2011b) .",

These Tregs express the IL-10 receptor (IL-10R) and, in a positive feed forward loop, respond to IL-10 by producing more IL-10 . Th17 cells also express the IL-10R and Treg-derived IL-10 restricts Th17 cell development and production of pathogenic mediators (Huber et al., 2011) . The CD8 + T cells that produce IL-10 are also highly cytolytic suggesting that as molecules are produced to clear infection they also begin to produce IL-10 to regulate their inflammatory capacity and modulate the consequences of the immune response (Trandem et al., 2011b) . Although T cells are important producers of IL-10, intrinsic cells of the CNS can also produce IL-10 and early production at the site of infection by a virus engineered to express IL-10 provides protection against pathology later in disease (Trandem et al., 2011a) . These data suggest that both early and late IL-10 production may be important in regulating the immunopathological consequences of virus infection in the CNS.",

            "text": "Sindbis virus (SINV) is a mosquito-borne, positive-sense RNA virus in the family Togaviridae. SINV, the prototypical alphavirus, is related to Venezuelan, eastern, and western equine encephalitis viruses that cause seasonal epidemics of encephalomyelitis in horses and humans (Go et al., 2014; Hollidge et al., 2010) . SINV causes a mild, arthritic disease in humans, but is neuronotropic and produces encephalomyelitis in mice (Johnson, 1965; Taylor et al., 1955) . Neuroadapted SINV (NSV) causes uniformly fatal disease in C57Bl/6 (B6) mice after intranasal or intracerebral infection as a result of immune-mediated damage (Greene et al., 2008; Rowell and Griffin, 2002; Thach et al., 2000) for which both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells have been implicated (Rowell and Griffin, 2002) . IL-10 regulates this immunopathology by specifically modulating a pathogenic Th17 response that develops within the CNS of susceptible B6 mice in response to infection (Kulcsar et al., 2014) . Tregs are implicated as a source of IL-10 because in resistant Balb/cJ mice a robust IL-10-producing Treg response is associated with survival (Kulcsar et al., 2015) . Therefore, IL-10 is an important immune modulator during NSV infection, but the cellular sources of this cytokine in the CNS and their relative importance during lethal infection are not known.",

Analysis of these mice showed that IL-10 was expressed in the CNS after infection, but not in the draining cervical lymph nodes, and that the predominant IL-10-expressing cells were CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, with little contribution from myeloid cells. Within the CD4 + T cell compartment CD25 + and CD25 \u2212 cells expressed IL-10. Examination of mice deficient in IL-10 production specifically in T cells (IL-10 CD4KO ) or in myeloid cells (IL-10 LysMKO ) identified T cells as the predominant source of IL-10 that restricts Th17 as well as Th1/Th17 cell development in the CNS.

To compensate for this, we subtracted the FITC channel signal from WT mice for all cell types at the same time points to determine the level of eGFP expression above background. Five days after infection, 7.14% of T cells expressed IL-10eGFP, which was higher than the percentage of microglia expressing IL-10eGFP (0.66%, P = 0.0051) ( Fig. 2A, B) .

Previous studies have shown that individual T cell subsets produce IL-10 with different kinetics during acute and persistent CNS viral infections (Puntambekar et al., 2011; Trandem et al., 2011b; Zhao et al., 2014) . IL-10 production selectively knocked-out in CD4 + and CD8 + T cells significantly reduced the amount of Il10 mRNA expressed (Fig. 3) . To determine the dynamics of IL-10 production by CD4 + and CD8 + T cells, T cell subsets were evaluated in VertX mice for expression of IL-10eGFP in the brain 5 d and 7 d after infection and in the spinal cord at 7 d when there were enough T cells to reliably detect IL-10eGFP expression (Fig. 4) . Both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in the brains and spinal cords of NSV-infected mice expressed IL-10eGFP. The numbers of CD4 + IL-10eGFP + cells increased from 1.87 \u00d7 10 3 cells per brain 5 d after infection to 3.63 \u00d7 10 4 cells per brain 7 d after infection (P = 0.0382, Fig. 4A , C).

In VertX mice, both CD4 + CD25 \u2212 and CD4 + CD25 + T cells expressed IL-10eGFP. The number of CD4 + CD25 \u2212 cells increased from 1.37 \u00d7 10 3 cells 5 d after infection to 2.5 \u00d7 10 4 cells 7 d after infection (P = 0.0433, Fig. 5A, C) . Similarly, the number of CD4 + CD25 + cells increased from 637 cells 5 d after infection to 1.24 \u00d7 10 4 cells 7 d after infection (P = 0.0157, Fig. 5A, C) . The percentage of CD4 + CD25 \u2212 cells that expressed IL-10eGFP increased from 8.4% at 5 d to 26.0% at 7 d after infection (P = 0.0145) while the percentage of CD4 + CD25 + cells expressing IL-10eGFP increased from 19.2% at 5 d to 36.0% 7 d after infection (Fig. 5A, B) . Within the CD4 + CD25 + population there was a higher frequency of IL-10eGFP + cells than in the CD4 + CD25 \u2212 population 5 and 7 d after infection, although this did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 5B ). There were, however, significantly more CD4 + CD25 \u2212 IL10eGFP + cells than CD4 + CD25 + -IL10eGFP + cells 5 d after infection (P = 0.0064), a trend that was maintained at 7 d (Fig. 5C) . These data show that within the CD4 + T cell compartment, there were more CD25 \u2212 than CD25 + cells expressing Fig. 3 . T cells are the primary source of Il10 mRNA in the brain during NSV infection. WT, IL-10 fl/fl , IL-10 CD4-KO , and IL-10 LysM-KO mice were infected intranasally with 10 5 pfu of NSV and brain tissue was collected from mice before infection and 5 and 7 d after infection. Il10 mRNA expression was measured by qRT-PCR. Ct values were normalized to GAPDH and fold change was calculated relative to uninfected controls (\u0394\u0394Ct). Data were pooled from 2 independent experiments and represent the mean \u00b1 SEM of 3-6 mice at each time point. ***P b 0.001.

In the absence of IL-10, more pathogenic Th17 cells, as well as Th1/Th17 cells, are present in the CNS at the onset of paralysis and contribute to accelerated morbidity and mortality (Kulcsar et al., 2014) . In WT mice, the primary source of IL-10 is T cells, not myeloid cells (Fig. 3) . To verify that IL-10 produced by T cells is responsible for regulating the Th17 response during viral encephalomyelitis, we compared the CD4 + T cell skewing of IL-10 CD4-KO and IL-10 LysM-KO mice to IL-10 fl/fl littermates, WT, and IL-10 KO mice. Cells isolated from brains 5 d after infection, when differences in the Th17 response between WT and IL-10 KO mice are the greatest (Kulcsar et al., 2014) , were stimulated ex vivo. To identify Th1, Th17, and Th1/Th17 responses, CD4 + T cells were evaluated for the production of IFN\u03b3, IL-17a, and co-production of IFN\u03b3 and IL-17a, respectively (Fig. 6 ). There were no significant differences in the Th1 responses as measured by numbers or percentages of IFN\u03b3-producing CD4 + T cells. However, the Th17 responses were different (Fig. 6A-C) . As expected, WT and IL-10 fl/fl mice had similar Th17 responses while in IL-10 KO mice there was a higher percentage (P = 0.0011; Fig. 6A , F) and more (P = 0.0422; Fig. 6G ) CD4 + IL-17a + T cells than in WT mice. IL-10 CD4-KO mice also had an increased Th17 response compared to IL-10 fl/fl littermates. Approximately 2.3% of the CD4 + T cells from IL-10 fl/fl mice produced IL-17a compared to 5.3% in IL-10 CD4-KO mice (P = 0.0072; Fig. 6A , F). This resulted in almost twice as many CD4 + IL-17a + T cells in the IL-10 CD4-KO mice (P = 0.0018; Fig. 6G ). The IL-10 LysM-KO mice had Th17 responses similar to WT and IL-10 fl/fl mice (Fig. 6F, G) .",

The IL-10 LysM-KO mice showed no difference in the course of disease or the time of death compared to IL-10 fl/fl mice consistent with their similar Th1 and Th17 responses (Fig. 7C, D) . However, IL-10 CD4-KO also had a similar course of disease compared to IL-10 fl/fl mice (Fig. 7A, B) . Although the Th17 response was elevated in IL-10 CD4-KO mice, it was less than observed in IL-10 KO mice suggesting that a threshold for an increase in disease severity was not reached.

These studies of VertX IL-10-reporter mice infected with NSV showed that IL-10-producing cells were increasingly abundant in the brain and spinal cord after infection, but infrequent in the draining CLN. The numbers of IL-10eGFP + cells in the CNS were primarily CD4 + and CD8 + T cells and within the CD4 + T cell population, more IL-10eGFP + cells were CD25 \u2212 than CD25 + at the height of inflammation. In the absence of T cell-derived IL-10 in IL-10 CD4 KO mice, numbers of Th17 and Th1/Th17 cells increased, although not as much as in IL-10 KO mice, and the course of disease was not altered. Therefore, effector, as well as regulatory CD4 + and CD8 + T cells differentiated in the CNS to become important sources of IL-10 that modulated the inflammatory response and development of Th17 and Th1/Th17 cells.",

Tissue-specific expression of IL-10 also occurs during CNS infection with the gliatropic JHM strain of MHV (Puntambekar et al., 2011; Trandem et al., 2011b) . These data suggest that although virus-specific T cells are generated in the draining CLN, they do not begin producing IL-10 until they reach the site of infection. Similarly, during influenza virus infection the majority of IL-10 + T cells are in the lung, not in the draining LN or spleen (McKinstry et al., 2009 ). However, a recent study showed that with ex vivo stimulation virusspecific Tregs in the draining CLNs do produce IL-10 (Zhao et al., 2014) suggesting that some T cell subsets are programmed to produce this regulatory cytokine prior to encountering the milieu of the inflamed CNS. Together, these data suggest that T cell production of IL-10 is The frequency of IL-10eGFP + cells (% of CD4 + CD25 \u2212 (white bar) and % of CD4 + CD25 + (black bar)) and (C) absolute number of CD4 + CD25 \u2212 IL-10eGFP + (white bar) and CD4 + CD25 + IL-10eGFP + (black bar) cells was calculated for each time point.

However, by 7 d after infection the proportion of CD8 + T cells that expressed IL-10eGFP + was higher than that of CD4 + T cells so that at the peak of inflammation CD8 + T cells were the primary producers of IL-10. This may correlate with an increase in CD8 + T cell cytolytic activity as seen during MHV infection (Trandem et al., 2011b) . IL-10 production and a robust regulatory T cell response are both associated with protection from lethal disease induced by NSV infection (Kulcsar et al., 2015) . In the brain 7 d after NSV infection there were more IL-10eGFP + CD4 + cells in the CD25 \u2212 compartment than the CD25 + compartment indicating that effector, as well as regulatory, CD4 + T cells contributed to IL-10 production in the CNS during NSV infection. However, during MHV infection of the CNS more CD25 + than CD25 \u2212 cells were IL-10eGFP + 7 d after infection (Puntambekar et al., 2011) . The numbers of both CD4 + CD25 + foxp3 + and foxp3 \u2212 T cells producing IL-10 increased as inflammation increased and both can inhibit pathogenic Th17 responses (Huber et al., 2011) . Therefore, multiple CD4 + T cell subsets contribute to IL-10 production in the CNS during NSV infection.",

A significant increase in the Th17 and Th1/Th17 response in mice lacking T cell-derived IL-10, but not in mice lacking myeloid cell-derived IL-10, indicated that T cells were the primary source of IL-10 regulating the CNS development of Th17 cells. However, the increase of Th17 cells in IL-10 CD4 KO mice was less than that observed in mice completely deficient in IL-10 and did not have a significant impact on the course of disease. These data suggest that although T cell-derived IL-10 modulates the Th17 and Th1/ Th17 responses, other sources of IL-10 also participate in regulation. Fig. 6 . IL-10 produced by T cells, but not myeloid cells, contributes to controlling the Th17 and Th1/Th17 response in the brain during NSV infection.
