The purpose of this paper is to use the ARMAX model to investigate the dynamic relationship between tourism demand and real income of Japan, and to compare the findings with the single-equation model. Unit root tests and diagnostics are performed before estimating the income elasticity of travel demand by Japan for New Zealand and Taiwan based on seasonally unadjusted quarterly data for 1980(1) to 2004(2). The empirical results of the ARMAX model support the economic theory that the demand for international travel is positively related to income of the origin country.",

Higher tourism or relative prices in Taiwan due to inflation in recent years have not slowed down the flows of tourists from Japan. In particular, the number of Japanese visitors to Taiwan has reached a new record of 1.1 million in 2005, a double-digit growth compared with 2004 (see Fig. 5 ). However, the SARS outbreak in 2003, which was the first pandemic of the 21st century declared by [13] , had a far-reaching effect on Japanese inbound arrivals to Taiwan to such levels the country had not experienced since 1986.",

The share of Japanese male tourists outnumbered their female counterparts by the ratio of approximately 2:1. About 50% of Japanese travelled to Taiwan for pleasure, followed by business (30%), and visiting relatives and friends (3%), as shown in Fig. 6 . According to a survey conducted by [11] , Taroko, Tienhsiang (one of the national parks located on the eastern side of Taiwan) and the night markets were the major scenic spots for Japanese tourists. The study also found that cuisine and historical relics were the major attractions for most Japanese tourists. On average, their duration of stay was 5.02 nights, compared with 7.1 nights on average for all inbound visitors. The seasonal patterns of tourist arrivals from Japan to New Zealand and Taiwan are shown in Fig. 7 . Using the multiplicative ratio-to-moving average technique to estimate the monthly seasonal indices, it is not surprising that there is less seasonal variation for a short-haul destination such as Taiwan. The seasonal range is 0.34 and 0.77 for Taiwan and New Zealand, respectively. Nonetheless, the peak tourism months for the two destinations are February (for New that is, from November to March. While the intra-year movements of Japanese tourists to New Zealand may be related to the climatic conditions at the destination, the same argument would not seem to apply to Taiwan.",

Using the first difference of the log tourist arrivals from Japan, various ARIMA models have been estimated using ordinary least squares. By excluding insignificant AR and MA lags, the use of diagnostics and selection criteria would help to determine a more parsimonious model. The latter is subsequently used to undertake ARMAX modelling and estimation of the income elasticity of travel demand by Japan for New Zealand and Taiwan over the period 1980-2004. Hence, the models selected yield significant t-statistics at the 5% level of significance for the AR and MA coefficients, with no serial correlation at the 5% level, using the Lagrange multiplier test for serial correlation. ARIMA (3, 1, 3) and ARIMA(2, 1, 4) have been identified for New Zealand, and ARIMA(4, 1, 4) for Taiwan as the optimal models.
