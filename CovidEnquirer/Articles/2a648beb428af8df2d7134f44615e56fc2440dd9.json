Protection was dependent on interferon-g and required early induction of robust innate and virus-specific CD8 + T cell responses. The conserved epitope was also recognized in SARS-CoV-and MERS-CoV-infected human leukocyte antigen DR2 and DR3 transgenic mice, indicating potential relevance in human populations. Additionally, this epitope was cross-protective between human and bat CoVs, the progenitors for many human CoVs.

Another human pathogenic CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS-CoV), caused more than 8,000 human infections in 2002-2003, with a 10% mortality rate . The presence of SARS-like CoV and other CoVs in zoonotic populations as well as the ongoing MERS epidemic make it likely that additional CoV outbreaks will emerge (Ge et al., 2013) .

            "text": "Intranasal Vaccination with VRP-SARS-N Results in CD4 + T Cell-Dependent Protection against SARS-CoV Previously, we identified a dominant CD4 + T cell epitope in the nucleocapsid (N) protein of SARS-CoV (N353) recognized in BALB/c (H-2 d ) mice; no CD8 + T cell epitopes are present in this protein (Zhao et al., 2010) . This region of N is also targeted by CD4 + T cells from SARS convalescent patients (Oh et al., 2011; Peng et al., 2006) . We initially evaluated whether intranasal (i.n.) immunization, which generates local CD4 + T cell responses, or footpad vaccination, which generates a systemic T cell response, resulted in differences in protection against challenge with mouse-adapted SARS-CoV (Roberts et al., 2007) . For this purpose, we vaccinated BALB/c mice twice at 6-7 week intervals with VRP-SARS-N or a control VRP expressing green fluorescent protein (VRP-GFP) i.n. or subcutaneously (s.c.) prior to challenge. VRPs are non-replicating vaccine vectors that preferentially infect human and mouse dendritic cells and serve as selfadjuvants (Moran et al., 2005; Tonkin et al., 2012) . Only i.n. inoculation with VRP-SARS-N induced an N-specific CD4 + T cell response in the lungs and airways, which was increased by i.n. VRP-SARS-N boosting ( Figure 1A ). In contrast, s.c. inoculation resulted in a CD4 + T cell response primarily in the spleen with virtually no N-specific T cells identified in the lungs or airway. Subcutaneous boosting increased the numbers of virus-specific cells in the spleen but not in respiratory tissue. As expected, VRP-SARS-N administration resulted in accumulation of N-expressing DCs and, consequently, more N-specific CD4 + T cells in the draining mediastinal lymph nodes (MLNs; i.n. immunization) and popliteal lymph nodes (PLNs; s.c. immunization) ( Figure S1 ). Protection from lethal disease was nearly complete after i.n. but not s.c. administration of VRP-SARS-N, demonstrating the importance of the route of vaccination ( Figure 1B) . Protection was observed against challenge with doses ranging from 100 to 10,000 PFUs of SARS-CoV ( Figure 1C ). By days 4-6 after challenge, SARS-CoV-infected VRP-GFP-immunized mice develop severe edema with a relative paucity of infiltrating cells whereas intranasal VRP-SARS-N-immunized mice displayed prominent peribronchiolar and perivascular infiltration and minimal amounts of edema in the lungs. Subcutaneous immunization with VRP-SARS-N did not protect against edema formation ( Figure 1D ). Consistent with these results, intranasal VRP-SARS-N immunization enhanced the kinetics of virus clear-ance ( Figure 1E ). Next we assessed the role of memory CD4 + T cells in protection by depleting them systemically 2 days prior to challenge. This abrogated protection ( Figures 1F and S2A ), indicating that memory CD4 + T cells might be important for protection.",

N-specific CD4 + T cell numbers gradually decreased after vaccination ( Figure 1H ) but still mediated partial protection after challenge at 41 weeks after boosting ( Figure 1I ). CD4 + T cells provide helper function for antibody production, but unlike sera from VRP-SARS-S, which induced neutralizing antibody, sera from VRP-SARS-N-immunized mice were not protective upon transfer to naive mice prior to challenge ( Figure 1J ). Protection was also observed in mice immunized with another vaccine, recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the N protein (rVV-SARS-N) ( Figure 1K ). Because the CD4 + T cell response was more robust in VRP-compared to rVV-immunized mice (data not shown), we used VRP-SARS-N for the remainder of the subsequent experiments. 12-monthold mice are very susceptible to SARS-CoV ; however, VRP-SARS-N vaccination at 12 months and analysis at 15 months of age resulted in protection against challenge, demonstrating efficacy even in this highly vulnerable population ( Figure 1L ). Together, these results indicate that intranasal but not subcutaneous immunization induced a protective CD4 + T cell immune response.",

To discriminate between cells localized to the airway versus those in the parenchyma and vasculature, we used a modification of a previously described method (Anderson et al., 2012) to simultaneously label cells by i.v. and i.n. administration of CD90.2 and CD45 antibodies, respectively, 5-7 weeks after boosting. Consistent with CD8 + T cell studies, a large proportion of CD4 + T cells in the respiratory tract were localized in the vasculature (Figure 2A ; Anderson et al., 2012) . Additionally, the vast majority of cells in the airway were not labeled by i.v. antibody administration, indicating their anatomic compartmentalization ( Figure 2A ).

After SARS-CoV challenge, the percentage of N-specific CD4 + T cells was much higher in the airway and the number of N353 CD4 + T cells at this site increased substantially compared to those in the parenchyma and vasculature ( Figure 2D ). Also, airway N353 CD4 + T cells expressed IFN-g at higher levels on a per cell basis compared to the parenchyma and vasculature (Figures 2D and 2E) . Airway cells had superior effector function, indicated by the ability to express more than one cytokine (TNF, IL-10, IL-2) ( Figure 2E ). In addition, these multi-functional CD4 + T cells were present at a higher frequency in the airway compared to parenchyma and vasculature (Figure 2F) and exhibited greater functional avidity ( Figure 2G ). To determine whether the increase in N353 CD4 + T cells reflected local proliferation or recruitment, infected mice were treated with FTY720 to prevent T cell egress from lymphoid tissue and then treated at day 4 p.i. with BrdU for 4 hr ( Figure S3 ). FTY720 treatment decreased the numbers of N-specific CD4 + T cells in the respiratory tract and the remaining cells showed evidence of BrdU incorporation, indicating roles for both recruitment and proliferation in augmentation of N353 CD4 + T cells.",

Previous reports indicated a key role for resident memory T (Trm) cells (T cells that are present at sites of prior infection without recirculation) in protection against pathogen challenge (Masopust and Picker, 2012; Mueller et al., 2013; Turner and Farber, 2014) and CD4 + Trm cells have been identified in the context of influenza A virus infection (Teijaro et al., 2011) . However, these airway N353 cells did not fit the classic definition of resident memory T cells because they were replenished by 4 weeks after depletion ( Figure 3B ), similar to airway memory IAV-specific CD8 + T cells (Sl\u00fc tter et al., 2013) . Depletion decreased survival to approximately 35%, demonstrating the key role that airway memory CD4 + T cells have in protection ( Figure 3C ). To probe the mechanism of action of these cells, we initially focused on type I interferon (IFN-I) expression because IFN-I orchestrates a protective response at early times p.i. IFN-a, IFN-b, and IFN-l were not upregulated after VRP-SARS-N immunization. In contrast, higher IFN-g mRNA levels were detected in the lungs of VRP-SARS-N-immunized mice by day 1 p.i. (Figures 3D and 3E ). This cytokine was largely produced by airway CD4 + T cells since local and systemic depletion of these cells was equally efficient in reducing IFN-g expression in the lung ( Figure 3E ). Expression of other cytokines, such as TNF, IL-1b, IL-6, and IL-12, was not upregulated by prior VRP-SARS-N vaccination ( Figure S4A ). IFN-g expression by airway CD4 + T cells was confirmed using an in vivo cytokine expression assay, in which mice were treated with Brefeldin A (BFA) for 6 hr prior to direct ex vivo analysis without additional stimulation ( Figure 3F ; Hufford et al., 2011) . Expression of IFN-g by CD4 + T cells resulted in the upregulation of several IFN-related genes in SARS-CoV-challenged, VRP-SARS-N-vaccinated mice, including STAT-1, PKR, and OAS-1, which are important for CoV clearance ( Figure S4B ; Frieman et al., Wang et al., 2009; Zhao et al., 2012) . Neutralization of IFN-g in the airway by i.n. administration prior to infection and every 2 days thereafter abrogated upregulation of these genes ( Figure 3G ).",

This suggested that these cells had an additional role in enhancing the adaptive immune response, most likely the virus-specific CD8 + T cell response, critical for SARS-CoV clearance (Channappanavar et al., 2014; Zhao et al., 2010) . To generate robust CD8 + T cell responses, respiratory dendritic cells (rDCs) must migrate to MLNs and prime naive CD8 + T cells . We next assessed whether airway memory CD4 + T cells participated in these processes. In a role not previously reported, IFN-g, largely expressed by these airway CD4 + T cells, was critical for optimal rDC migration, as measured by increased frequency and number of lung-derived carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester (CFSE)labeled rDCs in the MLN compared to VRP-GFP-immunized mice ( Figure 4A ). Administration of anti-CD4 or anti-IFN-g antibody i.n. significantly reduced rDC migration to the MLNs, accompanied by decreased accumulation of total lymph node cells ( Figure 4B ). These rDCs in MLNs were mature and optimized for antigen presentation as shown by expression of costimulatory molecules such as CD40, CD80, and CD86. rDC migration to the MLN requires CCR7 expression and CCR7 was also upregulated on migratory rDCs in the MLNs ( Figure 4C ). IFN-g augmented CCR7 expression since i.n. IFN-g treatment resulted in a 10-fold increase in the frequency of lung CCR7 + rDCs ( Figure 4D ). Together, these results established that airway memory CD4 + T cells and IFN-g secreted by these cells, in addition to activating the innate immune response, enhanced rDC migration to the MLN.",

Accumulation of cells in the lung requires T cell migration to this site, a process that is chemokine dependent. Virus-specific CD8 + T cells expressed chemokine receptor CXCR3 but not CCR4 and CCR5 ( Figure 5G ), suggesting that effector CD8 + T cell entry into the infected lung was dependent upon the CXCR3 pathway. In support of this, CXCR3 ligands CXCL9, CXCL10, and CXCL11 were expressed in the infected lungs in an airway CD4 + T-cell-and IFN-g-dependent manner ( Figures  5H and S4C) . We directly confirmed the importance of CXCR3 in CD8 + T cell accumulation in the lungs by systemic blockade of CXCR3 at days 3 and 5 p.i. This treatment decreased the frequency and numbers of epitope S366-specific CD8 + T cells in the lungs. Together these results showed that airway memory CD4 + T cells orchestrated both rDC migration to the MLNs and virus-specific CD8 + T cell trafficking to the lungs, enhancing clinical outcomes.",

First, we examined N proteins from several alpha and beta coronaviruses for a SARS-N353 epitope-like sequence. Epitope SARS-N353 was present in all SARS-like CoVs isolated from civet cats, Chinese ferret badgers, and bats. Bats are the reservoir for SARS-CoV and civet cats and Chinese ferret badgers served as intermediate hosts during the 2002-2003 pandemic (Chinese SARS Molecular Epidemiology Consortium, 2004; Ge et al., 2013; Li et al., 2005) . In addition, similar sequences were detected in MERS-CoV and bat CoV HKU4, HKU5, and HKU9 as well as more distantly related alpha coronaviruses ( Figure 6A ). To determine whether MERS-N350 was recognized in infected mice, we challenged mice expressing the virus receptor, hDPP4 (human dipeptidyl peptidase 4) with MERS-CoV. MERS-N350-specific CD4 + T cells were detected in infected BALB/c mice ( Figure 6B ). Next, mice were immunized with VRP-MERS-N, resulting in a robust airway CD4 + T cell response that could be boosted by a second VRP-MERS-N immunization ( Figure 6C ). Consistent with results obtained after VRP-SARS N vaccination, these cells exhibited superior effector function, were multifunctional (Figure S7) , and accelerated virus clearance upon challenge (Figure 6D ). MERS-CoV N, unlike SARS-CoV N protein, encodes a weak CD8 + T cell epitope in BALB/c mice (N214, LYLDLLNRL) , which might have contributed to accelerated virus clearance. However, the contribution made by these cells was relatively minor; depletion of airway CD4 + T cells or blockade of airway IFN-g significantly decreased the rate of virus clearance ( Figure 6E ).",

To determine whether the SARS-N353 or MERS-N350 epitope was potentially recognized in humans, we immunized mice transgenic for human HLA class II DR2 or DR3 antigen with N peptides and analyzed mice for peptide-specific CD4 + T cell responses. As shown in Figure 6F , SARS-N353 could be presented by both DR2 and DR3, whereas MERS-N350 was successfully presented by DR2. HLA-DR2 and HLA-DR3 transgenic mice are on a C57BL/10 (H-2 b ) background. Young SARS-CoV-infected mice on this background do not develop clinical disease (Frieman et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2011) , so we assessed the effect of immunization by measuring the kinetics of virus clearance. Immunization with VRP-SARS-N or VRP-MERS-N enhanced the kinetics of virus clearance from these HLA transgenic mice after challenge with SARS-CoV or MERS-CoV ( Figure 6G ), indicating that these constructs could be potential vaccine candidates in human populations. No H-2 brestricted CD8 + T cell epitopes are present in the N protein of either MERS-CoV or SARS-CoV (Zhao et al., 2010 so that vaccination induced solely a virus-specific CD4 + T cell response.",

Having identified closely related analogs to SARS-N353 in other coronaviruses ( Figure 6A ), we next asked whether these epitopes induced cross-reactive memory CD4 + T cells in the airway. Immunization with VRP-MERS-N induced CD4 + T cells that responded to many of the peptides listed in Figure 6A (Figure 7A ), whereas VRP-SARS-N immunization induced a small cross-reactive response (<1.0%, data not shown). Next, we assessed whether these VRP-MERS-N-induced cross-reactive memory CD4 + T cells were protective against SARS-CoV challenge. After VRP-MERS-N immunization and SARS-CoV challenge, virus-specific airway CD4 + T cells were detected after stimulation with either SARS-N353 or MERS-N350 peptides; these cells were not present in infected mice previously immu-nized with VRP-GFP ( Figure 7B ). VRP-MERS-N vaccination was partly protective against low-dose SARS-CoV challenge ( Figure 7C ). This limited protection was most likely because the numbers of cross-reactive N-specific CD4 + T cells in the airway were approximately 10-fold lower than detected after VRP-SARS-N immunization (compare Figures 1A and 7B ). As we observed strong cross-reactivity between the MERS-CoV and HKU4 and HKU5 epitopes, we examined whether vaccination with VRP-HKU4-N would enhance MERS-CoV clearance. Vaccination with VRP-HKU4-N induced cross-reactive CD4 + T cell responses against MERS-CoV N and HKU5 N ( Figure 7D ). After challenge with MERS-CoV, we detected a robust CD4 + T cell response, with more cells responding to MERS-N350 than to HKU4-N351 ( Figure 7E ). VRP-HKU4-N vaccination resulted in enhanced MERS-CoV clearance, with kinetics very similar to that observed after VRP-MERS-N vaccination (compare Figures  6D and 7F) . Collectively, these results indicate that a conserved epitope recognized by airway memory CD4 + T cells in SARS-CoV-and MERS-CoV-infected mice induced a cross-reactive, protective immune response.",

Using specific depletion of CD4 + T cells by i.n. administration of antibody, we demonstrated that cells localized to the airway were critical for protection. Airway CoV-specific CD4 + T cells provided the first line of defense against challenge, enhancing the immune response at early and late times after infection. More rapid virus clearance occurred within 1-2 days after challenge, demonstrating the role of airway memory CD4 + T cells in enhancing the innate immune response. At 6-7 days p.i., virus clearance was again accelerated because these cells augmented rDC migration to MLNs and subsequent virus-specific CD8 + T cell priming and mobilization to the infected lungs in a CXCR3-dependent manner. All of these effects were dependent upon airway CD4 + T-cell-derived IFN-g.",

Protection occurs via IFN-g expression and enhancement of CD8 + T cell and antibody responses, similar to our findings . In another study, memory CD4 + T cells were identified in the lungs of IAV-infected mice and shown to be lung-resident cells using a parabiosis model. After transfer to naive mice, these lung-derived cells preferentially migrated to the lungs and mediated protection upon subsequent IAV challenge (Teijaro et al., 2011) . IAV-specific memory CD4 + T cells also were identified in normal-appearing human lungs (Purwar et al., 2011) . Although both of these studies refer to these cells as lung CD4 + Trm cells, our results suggest that this terminology must be used carefully. We showed that there were three populations of cells in the lungs, and at least memory CD4 + T cells in the airways were replenished after a few weeks. Memory CD4 + T cells have specific advantages compared to memory CD8 + T cells because they are longer lived in some settings and are more polyclonal (Lees and Farber, 2010; Stockinger et al., 2006) . Consistent with this, we observed that the SARS-N353-specific CD4 + T cell response in the airway demonstrated long-term protection: mice immunized with VRP-SARS-N at 6 weeks of age and challenged 41 weeks after boosting exhibited 30% survival whereas age-matched controls all succumbed to the infection. Further, CD4 + T cell epitopes are less prone to immune escape than are CD8 + T cell epitopes, partly because CD4 + T cells largely function via CD8 + T cell recruitment and other indirect mechanisms whereas virus-specific CD8 + T cells directly target infected cells. Consequently, CD4 + T cell epitope escape has only rarely been described (Harcourt et al., 1998) .",

First, CD127 and CD27, two memory T cell markers (Mueller et al., 2013) , were present at lower levels on airway CD4 + T cells, suggesting that these cells maintained an effector-like phenotype and were delayed in transition to a complete memory phenotype. Second, CD11a, important for retention in tissues, was lower on airway CD4 + T cells, indicating a lack of requirement for tissue adherence and consistent with localization in the airway. Third, airway CD4 + T cells did not express CD103, CD69, and Ly6C, markers for CD8 + Trm cells, unlike parenchymal cells, which resembled CD8 + Trm cells more closely. Finally, airway CD4 + T cells were more multifunctional than cells in the parenchyma and vascular, with a higher percentage of cells producing multiple cytokines and with higher cytokine production on a per cell basis. Airway cells exhibited greater functional avidity than their parenchyma counterparts, arguing that they could rapidly respond at early stages during pathogen challenge while antigen levels were still low.",

However, N-specific sera were non-neutralizing and did not protect against subsequent challenge, as shown in this report and by others . In contrast, airway memory CD4 + T cells targeting SARS-CoV epitope N353 or its homolog in MERS-CoV and other CoVs induced protective responses. The MERS-CoV and HKU4 N-specific epitopes induced especially strong cross-reactive and protective responses so their inclusion in a vaccine would be expected to increase efficacy against a variety of antigenically variable human coronaviruses. Studies of SARS survivors (Oh et al., 2011; Peng et al., 2006) , as well as our analyses of infected DR2 and DR3 Tg mice, indicated that this epitope was also likely to be useful as an immunogen in human populations.",

The percentage of cross reactivity between MERS-N peptide and other coronavirus N peptides is shown. (B) VRP-MERS-N-or VRP-GFP-vaccinated mice were infected with SARS-CoV. Airway-derived cells were stimulated with SARS-N or MERS-N peptides and assayed for IFN-g production at day 6 p.i. Numbers of CD4 + T cells responding to MERS-N350 or SARS-N353 peptides are shown (right). *p < 0.05. Data are representative of six independent experiments. (C) VRP-MERS-N-or VRP-GFP-vaccinated mice were infected with 100 PFU or 500 PFU of SARS-CoV. n = 4, GFP-immunized + 100 PFU SARS-CoV; n = 4, GFP + 500 PFU; n = 12, MERS-N + 100 PFU; n = 8, MERS-N + 500 PFU. (D) Mice were vaccinated with VRP-HKU4-N. Airway-derived cells were stimulated with CoV-specific peptides and assayed for IFN-g production. The percentage of cross reactivity between HKU4-N peptide and other coronavirus N peptides is shown.(E) VRP-HKU4-N-or VRP-GFP-vaccinated mice were infected with MERS-CoV. Airway-derived cells were stimulated with HKU4-N and MERS-N peptides. Numbers of IFN-g + SARS-N353-and MERS-N350-specific CD4 + T cells are shown (right). *p < 0.05. Data are representative of three independent experiments. (F) Virus titers in the lungs are expressed as PFU/g tissue. n = 3 mice/group/time point. *p < 0.05. Data are representative of two independent experiments. Error bars in (A), (B), and (D)-(F) represent SEM.",
