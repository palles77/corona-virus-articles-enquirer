            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is a highly contagious enteric swine disease. The large economic impact of PED on the swine industry worldwide has made the development of an effective PED vaccine a necessity. S0, a truncated region of the porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) spike protein, has been suggested as a candidate antigen for PED subunit vaccines; however, poor solubility problems when the protein is expressed in Escherichia coli, and the inherent problems of subunit vaccines, such as low immunogenicity, remain. Flagellin has been widely used as a fusion partner to enhance the immunogenicity and solubility of many difficult-to-express proteins; however, the conjugation effect of flagellin varies depending on the target antigen or the position of the fusion placement. Here, we conjugated flagellin, Vibrio vulnificus FlaB, to the N-and C-termini of S0 and evaluated the ability of the fusion to enhance the solubility and immunogenicity of S0. Flagellin conjugation in the presence of the trigger factor chaperone tig greatly improved the solubility of the fusion protein (up to 99%) regardless of its conjugation position. Of importance, flagellin conjugated to the N-terminus of S0 significantly enhanced S0-specific humoral immune responses compared to other recombinant antigens in Balb/c mice. The mechanism of this phenomenon was investigated through in vitro and in vivo studies. These findings provide important information for the development of a novel PED vaccine and flagellinbased immunotherapeutics.",

            "text": "The currently used PED vaccines are live attenuated vaccines (LAV) or inactivated vaccines, which have inherent problems related to safety and cost-effectiveness [1, 2, 6] . In particular, the effectiveness of some of these vaccines has become controversial after an outbreak of PED in the United States [1] , which consequently stressed the need for the development of a novel PED vaccine such as subunit vaccine. Subunit vaccines involve the use of an antigenic component of pathogenic bacteria or viruses that could be used as a vaccine instead of the entire pathogen. Despite relatively low immunogenicity, subunit vaccines have many advantages over traditional LAVs, including safety, simplicity and the ability to be mass produced through E. coli systems [7] . In particular, the cost-effectiveness of subunit vaccines is an important advantage in association with the economic objectives of the livestock industry. However, candidate antigens of the PED subunit vaccine, such as S0, are expressed as insoluble aggregates in E. coli that are not suitable for use as a vaccine [8, 9] . Although S0 possesses enriched neutralization epitopes with a potential in cross-reactivity to various PEDV strains [10] . To overcome the low solubility and low immunogenicity of the PED subunit vaccine, the introduction of a molecular fusion adjuvant, such as flagellin protein, would be necessary.",

To interpret different S0-specific IgG outcomes among various groups receiving the flagellin adjuvant, we used the epithelial cell line Caco-2, which expresses TLR5 constitutively (Supplementary Fig. 3 F-S0 and F effectively induced IL-8 more significantly than S0 alone at 10 and 100 nM. At 1 nM, treatment with F induced IL-8 more significantly than treatment with S0-F or F-S0. Similar patterns were observed for MCP-1 (Fig. 5B) . There was no evident difference in the ability of S0-F and F-S0 to induce IL-8 or MCP-1. For more in-depth analysis, we verified each recombinant protein's ability to activate the TLR5 pathway in vivo. Mice were injected intraperitoneally with equivalent molar values of each recombinant protein, and sera were analyzed by ELISA to detect IL-6 as a marker of TLR5 activation. The data revealed that the F treatment induced stronger serum IL-6 levels when compared to S0-F or F-S0 treatments at 4 h (Fig. 6A) . Consistent with the in vitro data, S0-F and F-S0 had a tendency to induce higher levels of serum IL-6 than S0, but the levels were lower than for F. TLR5 stimulation profile of each recombinant protein was also confirmed by TLR5 reporter system and similar tendency was once again confirmed (Supplementary Fig. 2 Flagellin is recognized not only by the transmembrane receptor TLR5 on the cell surface but also by the cytosolic receptor NLRC4/NAIP5 [20] . Flagellin's adjuvant effect on the humoral immune response can be influenced by activation of both receptors [21, 22] . Therefore, we also sought to determine the ability of each recombinant protein to activate the cytosolic receptor NLRC4/NAIP5 by measuring its responsive cytokine IL-18 from sera. Interestingly, the S0-F-injected group had serum IL-18 levels that were significantly higher than all other groups at 1 h (Fig. 6B) . Similar patterns were also observed at 4 h.",

In this study, we conjugated flagellin to the N-or C-terminus of PEDV antigen S0 and evaluated its ability to enhance both solubility and the antigen-specific humoral immune response. Expression of recombinant proteins in an E. coli system has many advantages in terms of cost, yield and scalability; however, expression in E. coli often leads proteins of interest to form biologically inactive aggregates known as inclusion bodies (IBs) [23] . Despite enclosing neutralizing epitopes, PED subunit vaccine candidate antigens, including the S0 (25-229 amino acid), S1D (636-789 amino acid) and COE (499-638 amino acid) regions of the PEDV spike protein, are prone to be expressed as IBs [8, 9] . Although IBs can be refolded by several methods, it is better to express recombinant proteins in a soluble form and prevent IB formation in the first place [23] [24] [25] . There are various approaches to enhancing the solubility of recombinant proteins, including conjugation of a solubility-enhancing fusion partner protein or optimization of protein expression by adjusting the physiological condition of the host cells [23, 26, 27 ]. Here, we tested whether a flagellin fusion could enhance the solubility of the recombinant PEDV antigen S0 in the presence or absence of the trigger factor chaperone tig.",

In contrast to S0, 59% of S0-F was expressed as a soluble protein, while F-S0 was mainly expressed as an IB. Our data suggest that flagellin conjugation to the C-terminus of S0 improved solubility in the E. coli expression system without tig expression. To improve the solubility of the recombinant proteins, trigger factor chaperone tig, which has been shown to assist protein folding during synthesis and the initial folding process, was introduced and coexpressed with the respective protein of interest. In contrast to S0, which had 66% solubility, 99% of S0-F and F-S0 were expressed as soluble proteins ( Fig. 1B and D) , suggesting that flagellin conjugation also improved the solubility of recombinant proteins in the presence of tig. Furthermore, coexpression of tig ameliorated the solubility of S0, S0-F and F-S0 from 0% to 66%, 59% to 99%, and 6% to 99%, respectively. Taking this result into account, both flagellin conjugation and chaperone tig coexpression increased the solubility of S0-related recombinant proteins.",

This difference in protein levels suggests that the N-terminal flagellin sequence may offer efficient translation initiation, resulting in increased production of F-S0. In fact, it is generally accepted that fusion of a solubility enhancer to the N-terminus of a target protein can enable efficient translation initiation, which makes it a more favorable choice for soluble expression than the C-terminal fusion [28] . The conjugation of flagellin to the C-terminus of S0 (S0-F) improved soluble expression in comparison to the N-terminal conjugation (F-S0) or S0 alone in the absence of tig ( Fig. 1A and C) . tig enhances the solubility of recombinant protein through by assisting with the protein folding process. Proteins that are prone to aggregation, including the S1D and COE region of PEDV's spike protein, which are otherwise totally insoluble, have been expressed as soluble proteins with the assistance of tig [9] . In contrast, the condition lacking tig had a relatively lower capacity to fold recombinant protein correctly and make soluble protein. Therefore, rapid translation of F-S0 in the absence of tig is thought to produce IBs rather than soluble protein in spite of its total protein expression level being 1.5-times higher than the S0-F protein level.",

Flagellin has been used as a fusion adjuvant for a broad range of recombinant antigens in past decades [11, 12, 14] ; however, there have been relatively few studies assessing the effect of the flagellin fusion position on its adjuvant activity. Therefore, we tested the ability of S0-F and F-S0 to induce S0-specific humoral immune responses in mice. Interestingly, as shown in Fig. 4B -E, we confirmed that flagellin exerts a differential adjuvant effect depending on its conjugation position in reference to S0. The S0-specific antibodies in Fig. 4 is inferred to be the neutralizing antibodies, as the PEDV neutralization titers have positive correlations to indirect ELISA results which use S0 produced from E. coli as a coating protein [29] . We used Complete Freund's adjuvant (CFA) and incomplete Freund's adjuvant (IFA) together with our conjugated vaccine system in all mice immunization experiments equally as a 'basal' adjuvant ( Fig. 4) because we expected the additional adjuvant effect from the flagellin which could enhance the antigenicity of the S0 over the basal Freund's adjuvant effect.",

As shown in Fig. 5 , flagellin, regardless of whether it was conjugated to S0, activated the TLR5 pathway. In particular, F alone activated this pathway to significantly higher levels than the levels achieved by S0-F or F-S0 based on the 1 nM treatment data. This activation tendency was also confirmed in vivo (Fig. 6A) . The superior ability of F-S0 to induce S0-specific IgG relative to the mixture of S0/F may result from the effects of the conjugation. In fact, the conjugation of immunopotentiators to antigens has been demonstrated to elicit stronger immune responses than nonconjugated, separated treatments in many previous research investigations [14, [30] [31] [32] . This stronger response occurs because conjugation ensures the delivery and uptake of both antigen and immunopotentiator by the same antigen presenting cell, assuring the potentiation of antigen-specific immune responses [33] [34] [35] . Indeed, the conjugation of flagellin to various antigens has been shown to provide stronger antigen-specific humoral immune responses than separated mixtures [14, 32, 36] .",

            "text": "The cells of the innate immune system are equipped with two germline-encoded receptors to detect flagellin present on flagellated bacteria. The transmembrane receptor TLR5 detects extracellular flagellin, thus activating a number of innate and adaptive immune cells via methods such as secretion of proinflammatory cytokines. Injection of virulence factors containing flagellin from invading microbes results in flagellin being found within the cytosol of macrophages and being recognized by the cytosolic receptor NLRC4/NAIP5, which supports a stronger pathogen killing environment through IL-18, IL-1\u03b2 and pyroptosis [20] . The role of these two receptors on, in particular, flagellin's adjuvant effect is suggested to be complementary, as a single knockout of either pathway did not interfere with the adjuvancy of flagellin, while a double-knockout resulted in a significant reduction of the adjuvancy of flagellin [21, 37] . However, the NLRC4/NAIP5 pathway may interfere with flagellin's adjuvancy in the presence of intact TLR5. Li W et al. [22] demonstrated that FliC-L3A flagellin that lacks the ability to activate NLRC4/NAIP5 due to a point mutation, induced a significantly higher antigen-specific serum IgG titer than wild-type flagellin when used as an adjuvant with the model antigen p24 in mice. A/J mice, which are naturally partially deficient in Naip5, displayed higher IgG responses to ovalbumin (OVA) than C57BL/6 mice after immunization with a mixture of OVA and flagellin [37] . Our data revealed that S0-F treatment induced significantly higher levels IL-18, a representative cytokine of the NLRC4/NAIP5 pathway, than F-S0 or F treatment in mice (Fig. 6B) , suggesting that the superior ability of S0-F to activate the NLRC4/NAIP5 pathway may interfere with flagellin's adjuvancy and reduce serum S0specific IgG despite its advantage in the conjugated form.",

In fact, there have been several reports assessing the effect of the directionality of the flagellin fusion on its bioactivity. For example, flagellin conjugated to the C-terminus of HPV-16 E7 protein activated the TLR5 pathway 10-fold more potently than its counterpart, whereas flagellin conjugated to the N-terminus of E7 stimulated the NLRC4/ NAIP5 pathway significantly more than its counterpart or even flagellin alone [16] . We speculate that the receptor binding domains of flagellin may be influenced by the presence of the S0 protein, causing the NLRC4/NAIP5 binding domain of S0-F to be more exposed than the binding domain F-S0 or F.",

The ability of conjugating an immunopotentiator to an antigen to enhance the performance of the vaccine was once again confirmed. Conjugation of flagellin to S0 improved the solubility of the recombinant proteins when combined with chaperone tig. Flagellin conjugation did not improve the solubility of all other proteins; however, flagellin has been shown to be a good candidate for enhancing antigen solubility in proteins that are prone to form IBs such as S0. Conjugation of flagellin to the N-terminus of S0 enhanced the S0specific humoral immune response more than any other type of flagellin assistance. However, flagellin conjugation to the N-terminus of other antigens (e.g. HIV gp120, HPV E7) is not guaranteed to improve the antigen-specific humoral response because flagellin's preference to activate TLR5 or NLRC4/NAIP5 in its position differs depending on the conjugated antigens. Rather, we suggest that flagellin-conjugated antigens, which have an inferior ability to activate NLRC4/NAIP5, may be good candidates for inducing an increased antigenspecific humoral immune response. Furthermore, S0-induced responses were dominated by S0-specific IgG1 rather than IgG2a. Because the induction of IgG2a and IgG1 represent Th1-and Th2-type immune responses, respectively [18] . S0 seems to have an inherent ability to induce Th2-type immune response to itself (Fig. 4F) . In contrast to S0-F and F-S0, flagellin alone induced IgG2a more than IgG1, suggesting that flagellin skewed the type of immune response from Th2 to Th1. As Th2 cell-derived cytokines, such as IL-5 and IL-6, are important for the generation of IgA at mucosal site [40] , S0-F or F-S0 is expected to have an additional advantage if they are utilized as a mucosal vaccine. These findings provide crucial information for the rational design of a PED vaccine and flagellin-based immunotherapeutics.",
