In vitro, ectopic expression of transcription factors, in particular CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP\u2423) and C/EBP\u2424, can convert B cells into functional macrophages. However, little is known about the specific ligands responsible for such phenotype conversion. Here, we investigated whether spike protein of SARS-CoV can act as a ligand to trigger the conversion of B cells to macrophages. We transduced SARS-CoV spike proteindisplayed recombinant baculovirus (SSDRB), vAtEpGS688, into peripheral B cells and B lymphoma cells. Cell surface expression of CD19 or Mac-1 (CD11b) was determined by flow cytometry. SSDRB-mediated changes in gene expression profiles of B lymphoma cells were analyzed by microarray. In this report, we showed that spike protein of SARS virus could induce phenotypic conversion of human B cells, either from peripheral blood or B lymphoma cells, to macrophage-like cells that were steadily losing the B-cell marker CD19 and in turn expressing the macrophage-specific marker Mac-1. Furthermore, we found that SSDRB enhanced the expression of CD86, hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u2423 (HIF1\u2423), suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS or STAT-induced STAT inhibitor)-3, C/EBP\u2424, insulin-like growth factor-binding protein 3 (IGFBP3), Kr\u00fcpple-like factor (KLF)-5, and CD54, without marked influence on C/EBP\u2423 or PU.1 expression in transduced cells. Prolonged exposure to hypoxia could also induce macrophage-like conversion of B cells. These macrophage-like cells were defective in phagocytosis of red fluorescent beads. In conclusion, our results suggest that conversion of B cells to macrophage-like cells, similar to a pathophysiological response, could be mediated by a devastating viral ligand, in particular spike protein of SARS virus, or in combination with severe local hypoxia, which is a condition often observed in afflicted lungs of SARS patients.",

            "text": "Massive aggregations of macrophages are frequently detected in afflicted lungs of patients with severe acute respiratory syndromeassociated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection (Chow et al., 2004) . Such a phenomenon had been suggested to be caused by infectioninduced expression of IL-8 in the infected sites (Chang et al., 2004) . However, available in vitro data do not fully interpret the pathological findings in which only macrophages were profusely detected in the afflicted lung. No evident neutrophil or lymphocyte infiltration is found in the traumatized area, which is unusual for general virus infection (Chow et al., 2004) . Moreover, the estimated volume of atypical macrophages (Chow et al., 2004) , which are distinct from alveolar macrophages, is well beyond the number of monocytes that can be provided by a patient's bone marrow within such a short time of virus infection. These clinical data suggest that other sources might be responsible for the unusual presence of macrophages. Based on the atrophic white pulp of spleen and the absence of lymphocytes in the damaged lung, it was proposed that SARS virus infection-specific product(s) could be potentially lymphotoxic (Chow et al., 2004; Nicholls et al., 2003; Zhan et al., 2006) . The lack of evident karyorrhexis (Chiu et al., 2000) within the afflicted lung, however, argued against lymphotoxicity of SARS-CoV infection. These data prompt us to speculate that certain component(s) of SARS-CoV or microenvironmental conditions of SARS-CoV infection could act as the ligand or inducing factor for the conversion of lymphocytes to macrophages.",

All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.molimm.2010.06.014 multipotent progenitors, differentiation of hematopoietic cells becomes lineage-restricted (Akashi et al., 2000; Alexander, 1998; Heyworth et al., 2002; Stanley and Jubinsky, 1984) . This irreversible process is normally directed by a series of specific growth factors, cytokines, and the expression of corresponding receptors (Akashi et al., 2000; Alexander, 1998; Stanley and Jubinsky, 1984) . Interestingly, by examining the gene expression profile of hematopoiesis, several studies have found that transcription factors, such as AML-1, CCAAT/enhancer-binding protein alpha (C/EBP\u2423), C/EBP\u2424, C/EBP, E2A, GATA-1, GATA-2, c-myb, PU.1, and retinoic acid receptor (RAR, RXR), are essential for normal blood formation (Heyworth et al., 2002; Nakajima et al., 1994; Reddy et al., 2002; Xie et al., 2004) . A deficiency in one of these factors impedes hematopoiesis and produces a variety of intermediate precursors of blood cells (Laslo et al., 2006; Loose and Patient, 2006; . Replenishment of the specific factors, either alone or in combination, reestablishes hematopoiesis in gene-deficient cells or in differentiation-interrupted precursors of the same lineage. Enforced expression of those factors in progenitors of different lineages, however, prevents these cells from differentiating into the predetermined progeny cell types. Instead, these cells differentiate into transcription factor-specified lineages (Reddy et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2006; Xie et al., 2004 ). An elegant study by Xie et al. (2004) showed that ectopic expression of C/EBP\u2423 and C/EBP\u2424 in mature B cells led to the inhibition of B-cell-specific activator protein (BSAP, also called Pax5) and the downregulation of its target CD19. Moreover, C/EBP\u2423 and C/EBP\u2424 acted in synergy with endogenous PU.1 to remodel the transcription network and upregulate the expression of the myeloid marker Mac-1 (Xie et al., 2004) . Others reported that C/EBP\u2423 could direct differentiation of hematopoietic progenitor cells into granulocytes (including neutrophils) while the enforced expression of PU.1 could promote differentiation into monocytes (Reddy et al., 2002; Wang et al., 2006) . Coexpression of both C/EBP\u2423 and PU.1, however, prompts cells to express both markers of neutrophils and monocytes (Laslo et al., 2006) . These observations suggest that a reprogrammed \"transcription network\" can direct progenitor blood cells onto different differentiation paths. However, the specific ligands, such as cytokines, growth factors, or other extracellular signals, responsible for such phenotype conversion are mostly unknown.",

The result showed that SSDRBtransduced human B cells (right panel of Fig. 2C) .

As shown by fluorescence microscopy, SSDRB-transduced all 3 B lymphoma cells (Fig. 3A) . Interestingly, the appearance of SSDRB-transduced EGFP + cells was also larger and more granular than that of the control B lymphoma cells (without transduction or 0 h) (Fig. 3A) . The transduction rate of SSDRB was dependent on viral load (P < 0.05, P < 0.05, and P < 0.001 for CA46, HT, and Toledo cells, respectively) (Fig. 3B ). In contrast, the transduction rate of vAtE control was minimum (Fig. 3B) . The average transduction rate (based on EGFP + cells) of SSDRB (50 MOI) for CA46, HT, and Toledo cells at 24 h posttransduction was determined as 14.6%, 23.8%, and 33.9%, respectively (Fig. 3B) . Results of flow cytometry revealed that a portion of SSDRB-transduced B cells could in fact express the myelocytic marker Mac-1 (CD11b). In a representative flow cytometric analysis, about 57.7% of SSDRB-transduced CA46 (9.4% of 16.3%) concurrently expressed Mac-1 and CD19 and 9.8% of them (1.6% of 16.3%) expressed Mac-1 only (GFP positive, lower right of Fig. 3C ). In contrast, SSDRB-untransduced CA46 cells rarely expressed Mac-1 (0%) (GFP negative, right panel of Fig. 3C ). Similar ratios were observed in HT cells (data not shown). On the other hand, 17.4% of SSDRB-transduced Toledo cells (5.6% of 32.1%) concurrently expressed Mac-1 and CD19, whereas 50.1% of them (16.1% of 32.1%) expressed Mac-1 exclusively (lower right of Fig. 3C ). In sum, 67.5% of SSDRB-transduced CA46 or Toledo cells became Mac-1 positive. On the other hand, few (0.8% of 67.9%) SSDRB-untransduced Toledo cells expressed Mac-1 (GFP negative, right panel of Fig. 3C ). As an untreated control, only 0.5% of CA46 and 0.9% of Toledo cells expressed Mac-1. As a vector control, vAtE treated-B lymphoma cells scarcely expressed Mac-1 (left panel of Fig. 3C ). These data suggest that SSDRB could convert B cells into macrophage-like cells.",

Following analyses of scatter plotting and hierarchical clustering (Fig. 4A) , differentially expressed genes were identified. Results showed that expression of CD86 (B7-2), which is a marker of monocytic/dendritic lineage (Re et al., 2002) , and hypoxia-inducible factor-1\u2423 (HIF1\u2423) increased markedly within 12 h of SSDRB treatment.

Interestingly, following exposure to hypoxia for 16-24 h (in an incubation chamber with 5% CO 2 and 95% nitrogen), size and morphology of B lymphoma cells changed markedly and bore a resemblance to monocytes/macrophages with enlarged and horseshoe-shape nuclei. These macrophage-like cells were positive for CD68 (Fig. 5A ) and could readily ingest recombinant SARS spike proteins (RSSP) 24 h posthypoxia (data not shown). However, unlike macrophages isolated from mouse peritoneal cavity, these cells did not readily adhere to plates nor engulfed red fluorescent beads. Likewise, SSDRB-transduced B lymphoma cells (Toledo) (EGFP + cells) could hardly engulf any red fluorescent beads (microspheres) under both normoxia and hypoxia exposures ( Fig. 5B and C) .",

Coexpression of B-cell and macrophage markers, e.g., Mac-1 (CD11b), CD14, CD15, CD19, CD20, and CD68, has been found in Hodgkin's and Reed-Sternberg (RS) cells of Hodgkin's lymphoma (HL) (Hsu et al., 1990; Zukerberg et al., 1991) . Malignant HL cells behave like macrophages in vitro, engulfing exogenously added Candida albicans (Hsu et al., 1990) . Moreover, among HL subtypes, including lymphocyte predominance, mixed cellularity, nodular sclerosis, and lymphocyte depletion, reduction of lymphocytes is correlated with poorer prognosis of the disease (Shimabukuro-Vornhagen et al., 2005) . Interestingly, Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is frequently detected in HL lesions (Weiss et al., 1987) and EBV infection is also associated with disease progression (Claviez et al., 2005; Keegan et al., 2005) , particularly in older patients with nodular sclerosis and lymphocyte depletion. Based on these data and our current results, we propose that virus infection, such as EBV and SARS, may take a shortcut in accelerating unusual conversion of lymphocytes to macrophage-like cells under severe conditions, in which the patient's immune system may not be able to respond in time to neutralize viral infection either humorally or cellularly (Ding et al., 2003) .",

Taken together, we have identified the Mac-1 marker (macrophage specific) ( Fig. 2D and 3C ), CD68 marker (monocyte/macrophage specific) (Fig. 3D) , and CD86 marker (for monocytic/dendritic lineage) (Fig. 4B ) in these macrophage-like cells converted from SSDRB-transduced B cells. Nonetheless, these macrophage-like cells might not readily function as normal macrophages since they did not adhere well to plates nor efficiently engulfed red fluorescent beads ( Fig. 5B and C) . Therefore, such phenotypic conversion could be a pathological effect rather than a host-protective response.",

            "text": "Enhanced expression of C/EBP\u2424 in SSDRB-transduced B lymphoma cells was observed around 24-48 h after SSDRB treatment. Notably, several previous studies reported that ectopic expression of transcription factors, either C/EBP\u2424 plus C/EBP\u2423 or PU.1 alone, initiated phenotypic conversion of B cells into macrophages (Orkin, 2000; Sieweke and Graf, 1998; Xie et al., 2004) . In our study, levels of C/EBP\u2423 and PU.1 gene expression were not significantly differ-ent after SSDRB transduction. Instead, 2 other transcription factors, HIF1\u2423 and KLF-5, were found upregulated in SSDRB-transduced B lymphoma cells (Fig. 4B ). In the future, it would be necessary to determine whether HIF1\u2423 and KLF-5 may interact together with C/EBP\u2424 or act independently to participate in the conversion of B cells into macrophage-like cells. Grutkoski et al. (2003) has reported that SOCS-3 is induced exclusively in macrophages of septic mice to suppress inflammatory response. Here, we observed upregulated SOCS-3 gene expression around 24-48 h after SSDRB treatment, suggesting that macrophage-like cells converted from B cells might block inflammatory signaling via SOCS-3 action. In addition, our microarray analysis showed an increased expression in CD54 after SSDRB treatment. Interestingly, CD54 and Mac-1 upregulation is known to be related to the transmigration of peripheral monocytes and their differentiation into peritoneal macrophages (Liberek et al., 2004) . In our study, upregulation of CD54 (by microarray) and Mac-1 (by flow cytometry) correlated well with the conversion into macrophage-like cells. This result suggests that these macrophage-like cells may possess transmigration ability. Moreover, IGFBP3 was induced after SSDRB treatment. IGFBP3 may Microarray was used to identify genes that were expressed in Toledo cells after SSDRB (50 MOI) transduction. (A) Following analyses of scatter plotting and hierarchical clustering, differentially expressed genes were identified. Red indicates genes that were upregulated. Green indicates genes that were downregulated. Unchanged genes were shown in black. (B) Expression of CD86 and HIF1\u2423 increased markedly within 12 h of SSDRB treatment. At 48 h after SSDRB addition, the level of CD86 and HIF1\u2423 increased to more than 4-fold and 2.5-fold, respectively. Expression of SOCS-3, C/EBP\u2424, IGFBP3, KLF-5, and CD54 increased gradually around 24-48 h after SSDRB treatment. (C) Folds of gene enhancement (48 h vs. 0 h) were compared between SSDRB-treated cells and vAtE control. Each experiment was repeated at least 3 times. function either as an antiapoptotic or proapoptotic factor depending on the cell type and condition (Granata et al., 2004) . Wilson et al. (2005) has reported that IGFBP3 may protect myeloid cells against apoptosis mediated by Fas ligand or tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF\u2423). Accordingly, IGFBP3 could protect macrophage-like cells from apoptosis. As shown in Fig. 4A , several genes that may be involved in cell death were differentially expressed after SSDRB treatment. Nonetheless, many of them were not significantly different until 48 h posttransduction. Among 6 genes that were upregulated at 48 h posttransduction, 3 encoded antiapoptotic factors (GADD45B, BAG-3, osteopontin) (Gupta et al., 2006; Liao et al., 2001; Song et al., 2008) and 3 encoded apoptotic factors (galectin-1, Fas, and DEDD2) (Kov\u00e1cs-S\u00f3lyom et al., 2010; Itoh et al., 1991; Alcivar et al., 2003) (data not shown). By flow cytometry, we observed a small fraction of SSDRB-treated cells in the sub-G1 phase (data not shown), which may represent apoptotic cells and could explain in part the lymphopenia observed in SARS patients (Chow et al., 2004; Nicholls et al., 2003; Zhan et al., 2006) . However, given the fact that the percentage of sub-G1 cells was much lower than the transduction rate, and around two-thirds of SSDRB-transduced cells became Mac-1 positive, we expect that macrophage-like cells converted from B cells may not represent dying proapoptotic cells. Finally, these macrophage-like cells (Figs. 3D and 5A) did not show any apoptotic features such as shrinkage in morphology, nuclear condensation, or apoptotic bodies (Kerr et al., 1972; Rich et al., 1999) .",

Among them, a nonadherent pre-B-cell line, 70Z/3, is known to be able to transform into an adherent pre-B-cell lineage and from which a macrophage-like lineage can be generated spontaneously without any known ligand (Tanaka et al., 1994) . However, transition from an adherent pre-B subclone of 70Z/3 to macrophage-like lineage takes about 1 month. On the other hand, CD5 + pre-B or B1 cell lines (e.g., SPGM-1, TH2.52) can be converted into macrophage-like cells from 1 to 3 days upon induction with ligands such as phorbol ester/calcium ionophore or interferongamma (IFN-\u2425) (Spencker et al., 1995; Koide et al., 2002) . In our study, we also observed a fast transition (within 1-2 days posttransduction) from peripheral B cells or B lymphoma cells to macrophage-like cells after stimulation with spike protein of SARS displayed on recombinant baculovirus. Addition of recombinant spike protein, in contrast, did not result in such phenotypic transition (data not shown). It is likely that spike protein displayed on recombinant baculovirus adopts a similar conformation as that on SARS-CoV. However, we should point out that the experiments presented here were done with a spike-expressing recombinant virus instead of SARS-CoV. In the future, it is imperative to elucidate whether SARS-CoV or other viruses may induce B cell conversion.",

Although other gene products of SARS virus could be associated with the pulmonary pathology (Chow et al., 2004; Ding et al., 2003) , it is clear that spike protein, either directly or indirectly, affects lymphocyte conversion to myeloid cells, in particular if the viral effect is pathologically combined with hypoxia, which is an inevitable consequence of SARS infection. This in and of itself should provide a tool for elucidating the mechanism of delayed immune responses resulting from virus infection, and the subsequent pulmonary pathology and fatality (Chow et al., 2004; Ding et al., 2003) , of which the clinical symptoms are similar to those seen in patients infected with the avian influenza virus H5N1 (Ng et al., 2006) . It is possible that conversion of B cells to macrophage-like cells could be general during malicious virus infection, and such immediate host response could become more devastating than the routine immune response.",
