            "text": "either exogenous treatment with oxytocin or the presence of the calf at first milking would lead to higher colostrum quantity and higher IgG concentration. The study was conducted from October to December 2017 on a commercial dairy farm in Germany. A total of 567 cows at the time of calving were enrolled, but for the final analyses only 521 animals were considered. The cows were randomly assigned on a daily basis into 1 of 3 groups: (1) control group (n = 177), (2) application of 20 IU of oxytocin i.m. (OXY; n = 163), and (3) presence of the calf (CA; n = 181) before and during milking. Cows in the control and oxytocin group had no contact with their calves after calving and were milked in a separate milking parlor. Cows in the oxytocin group were injected with 20 IU of oxytocin i.m. 3 min before manual stimulation. For cows in the third group, the calf was placed into a calf cart and located in front of the cow 3 min before manipulation of the cow. Colostrum quantity was determined by a digital hanging scale. The colostrum quality was assessed with digital Brix refractometry and ELISA. To evaluate the effect of 2 different treatment procedures, a generalized linear mixed model was constructed using SPSS (SPSS Inc., IBM, Ehningen, Germany). The mean (\u00b1SE) colostrum quantity was 4.17 \u00b1 0.30 kg. The treatment procedures and the harvesting time after calving had no effect on colostrum quantity. Parity, calf birth weight, and calving time affected colostrum quantity. Cows in second parity had the lowest quantity of colostrum (3.74 \u00b1 0.37 kg) compared with cows in parity 1 (4.75 \u00b1 0.34 kg) and cows in parity 3 or greater (4.75 \u00b1 0.38 kg). Cows calving during the night (2200 until 0600 h; 4.93 \u00b1 0.37 kg) had the highest quantity of colostrum compared with cows calving in the morning (0600 until 1400 h; 4.17 \u00b1 0.38 kg) or afternoon (1400 until 2200 h; 4.14 \u00b1 0.34 kg). Regarding colostrum quality, 48% of the colostrum samples contained \u226550 mg of IgG/mL. The mean IgG concentration was 54.6 \u00b1 2.80 mg of IgG/mL. Colostrum quality was affected by the treatment procedures, colostrum quantity, parity, calving time, harvesting time after calving, and the calving day during the week. Both treatment procedures (i.e., OXY with mean IgG concentration results of 57.0 mg of IgG/mL and CA with 56.0 mg of IgG/mL) resulted in higher IgG concentrations in colostrum compared with the control group (50.7 mg of IgG/mL). With increasing colostrum quantity, the colostrum quality decreased in primiparous and multiparous cows. A longer time lag between calving and milking negatively affected the colostrum quality. Concentration of IgG was higher for cows in parity 3 or greater (64.6 \u00b1 2.59 mg of IgG/ mL) compared with cows in parity 1 (48.5 \u00b1 2.86 mg of IgG/mL) and cows in parity 2 (50.7 \u00b1 2.89 mg of IgG/ mL). Cows calving during the night had greater IgG concentrations (60.4 \u00b1 2.92 mg of IgG/mL) compared with cows calving in the morning (51.9 \u00b1 2.98 mg of IgG/mL) or afternoon (51.3 \u00b1 2.71 mg of IgG/mL). Harvesting colostrum on quieter days, such as Sundays, resulted in higher IgG concentrations (61.4 \u00b1 3.70 mg of IgG/mL). The assessment by Brix refractometry resulted in a mean result of 26.0 \u00b1 0.20% Brix. Treatment procedures and the harvesting time after calving had no effect on colostrum quality. A negative association was observed between colostrum quantity and quality in primiparous and multiparous cows determined by Brix refractometry. Brix readings were greater for cows in parity 3 or higher (27.7 \u00b1 0.26% Brix) compared with cows in parity 1 (25.3 \u00b1 0.30% Brix) and cows in parity 2 (25.0 \u00b1 0.32% Brix). In conclusion, the treatment procedure for the first milking is irrelevant",

The role of colostrum in supplying IgG to the neonatal calf has been well described (Weaver et al., 2000; Godden, 2008) . It is known that the timely delivery of colostrum, colostrum quality and quantity, and rate and amount of intestinal IgG absorption are essential components to guarantee a successful passive transfer in calves (Godden, 2017; Kertz et al., 2017) . To achieve these goals, it is important to harvest a sufficient quantity of high quality colostrum. Release of oxytocin is the prerequisite for milk ejection and complete colostrum harvest. A continuous ejection of colostrum is dependent on the presence of adequate circulating oxytocin concentration (Wellnitz and Bruckmaier, 2001) .",

            "text": "Milk ejection is an innate neuroendocrine reflex, which involves the hypothalamus, pituitary gland, and sensory neurons in the teat. In neurosecretory terminals of the pituitary gland, oxytocin is stored and emptied into the bloodstream upon successful stimulation (Bruckmaier and Blum, 1996; Tan\u010din et al., 2001; Ma\u010duhov\u00e1 et al., 2004) . Tactile stimulation of the teats results in the release of oxytocin and causes the contraction of myoepithelial cells around the mammary alveoli, whereby the alveolar milk fraction can be removed (Bruckmaier and Blum, 1998; Tan\u010din et al., 2001) . While tactile stimulation of the teats is the primary sensory impulse for milk ejection, genital stimulation and the presence of the newborn calf are also potent stimuli for oxytocin release (Bruckmaier and Blum, 1998; Tan\u010din et al., 2001) . Furthermore, it was shown that the presence of the calf during machine milking could influence the release of oxytocin and milk ejection (Akers and Lefcourt, 1982; de Passill\u00e9 et al., 1997; Lupoli et al., 2001) .",

Heifer and cow pens had 36 and 144 stalls, respectively. Cows were fed a TMR diet once daily consisting of corn silage and grass silage as forage with corn and canola-meal based concentrate formulated to meet or exceed the dietary requirements for dry and lactating Holstein cows (NRC, 2001) . The approximate intake of MP was estimated at 1,189 g/d. All prepartum cows were vaccinated during the dry period and prepartum heifers before the first calving to improve colostrum quality. The vaccination against Escherichia coli, bovine rotavirus, and coronavirus (Rotavec Corona, MSD Animal Health, Intervet Deutschland GmbH, Unterschlei\u00dfheim, Germany) was carried out 3 to 12 wk before calving. Postpartum cows were milked 3 times daily (0600, 1400, and 2200 h).",

Animals were moved into an individual maternity pen (3.5 \u00d7 3.5 m) bedded with fresh straw when the amniotic sac was visible or broken outside the vulva, or appearance of feet of the emerging calf were detected outside the vulva. A vaginal examination was conducted in every animal transferred to the maternity pen to assess dilatation of the vulva and cervix, as well as position, posture, presentation, and vitality of the calf. If the cow had not delivered the calf 1 h after the appearance of the amniotic sac or calf feet outside the vulva, calving assistance was provided to reduce calf losses (Schuenemann et al., 2011) . Intensity of calving assistance was recorded using a 4-point scale (0 = calving in the prepartum pen; 1 = no assistance; 2 = assistance by 1 person; 3 = assistance by at least 2 persons). Twins, caesarean sections, and stillbirths were recorded separately.",

The detection of the IgG concentration was based on coating and conjugating the IgG with anti-bovine IgG coupled to a peroxidase enzyme, which catalyzed a color change proportional to the IgG concentration of the sample. This color change was measured photometrically. Rabbit serum with anti-bovine IgG (5 \u03bcg/mL; A 5645, Sigma-Aldrich Chemie GmbH, Taufkirchen, Germany) was pipetted into each well of a 96-well polystyrene plate (F96 Cert. Maxisorp Nunc-Immuno Plate, Thermo Scientific GmbH, Darmstadt, Germany) and blocked with a 0.5% gelatin PBS solution. The diluted colostrum samples were inoculated into the uppermost cavity of each column. In addition, the samples were diluted by using a 2-logarithmic dilution series with PBS-Tween buffer in a ratio of 1:2. Furthermore, the peroxidase-linked rabbit anti-bovine IgG and the substrate solution (332 \u03bcL of stock solution, 10 mL of tetramethylbenzidine buffer, 30% H 2 O 2 ) were added, which started the enzyme reaction. By applying 50 \u03bcL of 1 molar sulfuric acid, the reaction process was stopped. The photometric intensity was measured at 450 nm with an ELISA Reader (GENios, Tecan Germany GmbH, Crailsheim, Germany). The mean value of the IgG concentration in each well of one column resulted in the final colostrum concentration (mg of IgG/mL). Colostrum containing \u226550 mg/mL of IgG was regarded as high quality colostrum (McGuirk and Collins, 2004) .",

About 15 to 20% residual milk stays in the udder after milking. Nostrand et al. (1991) found that the use of exogenous oxytocin increased lactation milk production during the declining phase of lactation after peak milk yield. However, mean fat and protein percentages did not differ for oxytocin and control cows during lactation (Nostrand et al., 1991) . We could not detect a difference in colostrum quantity for cows receiving exogenous oxytocin (OXY) and presumably a higher endogenous oxytocin concentration (CA) compared with CON cows. Effect of different treatment procedures at harvesting of colostrum on colostral IgG concentration (mg/mL, means \u00b1 SE) and on colostrum quality in % Brix (% Brix, means \u00b1 SE). Different treatment procedures before the first milking have been evaluated to improve harvesting of high quality colostrum. Cows in the control group (CON) had no contact with their calves. Cows in the oxytocin group (OXY) had no contact with their calves and were injected with oxytocin (20 IU i.m.) 3 min before first milking.

According to Bielmann et al. (2010) , a digital refractometer can determine the IgG content in colostrum measured by RID with a correlation of r = 0.71 and acceptable test sensitivities and specificities. In our study there was only a weak correlation between sandwich ELISA and Brix refractometry (r = 0.44). Obviously, results obtained by sandwich ELISA and RID cannot be directly compared (Dunn et al., 2017) . Therefore, the results in our study generated by sandwich ELISA limits the comparability with other studies using RID. It remains speculative why there was only poor agreement between the 2 methods. According to Elsohaby et al. (2017) , variations in the correlation coefficients could be related to the different non-IgG components in colostrum. The measurement via Brix refractometry assesses IgG concentrations indirectly, through assessing total dissolved solids that affect the sucrose concentration. These are affected by dry period length (Rastani et al., 2005) , vaccination status of the dam (Hodgins and Shewen, 1996) , and season of calving (Morin et al., 2001) .

Older cows seemed to produce colostrum with higher IgG concentrations, being exposed to antigens for a longer time during their life than younger cows. Antibodies are transferred from serum into colostrum and the colostral IgG concentration increases with the number of lactations. Consequently, the parity itself had a positive influence on colostrum quality (Conneely et al., 2013) . In our study, primiparous cows and cows in 2nd parity had lower colostrum quality determined by both methods compared with older cows, which is consistent with previous studies (Pritchett et al., 1991; Gulliksen et al., 2008) . Van Saun and Sniffen (2014) recommended prepartum feeding diets with at least >1,100 g/d, with 1,300 g/d of MP being better amount. The feeding diet in the present study was slightly above 1,100 g/d (1,189 g/d), but below the 1,300 g/d recommendation, which might explain the weak percentage (48%) of high quality colostrum found. Furthermore, it might explain the poor performance of 2nd parity cows. As 41% of colostral samples drawn from primiparous cows exceeded the cutpoint of 50 mg of IgG/mL, it is worthwhile to measure colostrum quality on farm and discard only the low quality colostrum.",

In the present study, the correlation coefficient of gestation length and calf birth weight was r = 0.49. According to Karl and Staufenbiel (2016) , the average IgG concentration in colostrum depends on gestation length. Cows up to 275 d gestation length had a colostral IgG concentration of 51.8 mg/mL, whereas cows with 276 to 285 d had 25.6 mg/mL and cows with more than 285 d had 26.2 mg/mL (Karl and Staufenbiel, 2016) . The average IgG concentration in our study was 54.4 mg/mL for cows with a gestation length of 265 up to 275 d (n = 191), 55.6 mg/mL for cows with 276 to 285 gestation days (n = 273), and 49.3 mg/mL for cows with 286 to 289 gestation days (n = 34).",

In addition, we observed higher IgG concentration in colostrum, if calving and harvesting of colostrum took place on Sundays.

The exposure of cattle to high ambient temperatures during late pregnancy has been associated in different studies with poorer colostrum composition, including lower mean concentrations of colostral IgG and IgA, and other components, such as total protein, casein, lactalbumin, fat, and lactose (Godden, 2008) . The negative effects of heat stress may influence DMI, resulting in nutritional restriction. Furthermore, a reduced mammary blood flow causes impaired transfer of IgG and nutrients from the blood stream to the udder, or impaired immune reactivity of mammary gland plasmacytes that produce IgA (Godden, 2008; Tao and Dahl, 2013) . Part of the included animals were exposed to higher ambient temperatures during late pregnancy. Resulting heat stress could have affected colostrum quality, which could explain the low percentage of high quality colostrum found (48%). However, this remains an assumption because heat stress parameters were not assessed in the present study.",

This approach was chosen to increase compliance with farm employees. We are aware that a random allocation of each cow to 1 of the 3 groups would have been more robust. Based on previous experience, however, we assumed that a study design with a random allocation on a cow basis would have reduced compliance significantly. Furthermore, in the present study 2 treatment procedures (OXY and CA) were compared with a CON group. The option of an i.m. application of saline solution as a placebo in the CON group was rejected, which is an obvious study limitation.
