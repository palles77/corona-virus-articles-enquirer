It is usually used to treat acute upper respiratory tract infection caused by virus or bacteria. Although the licensing of botanical drug Veregen approved by FDA has indicated the importance of quantitative analysis in quality control of herbal medicines, quantitative evaluation of a Chinese patent drug like SHL remains a challenge due to the complex chemical profile. In this study, 15 small molecular components of SHL (four flavonoids, six quinic acid derivatives, three saponins and two phenylethanoid glycosides) were simultaneously determined using ultra-high performance liquid chromatography coupled with quadrupole-time-of-flight mass spectrometry (UHPLC-Q-TOF-MS). The contents of the three major saccharides, namely fructose, glucose and sucrose were quantified using high performance liquid chromatography-evaporative light scattering detector on an amino column (HPLC-ELSD). The macromolecules were quantified by precipitating in 80% ethanol, drying the precipitate, and then weighing. The established methods were validated in terms of linearity, sensitivity, precision, accuracy and stability and then successfully applied to analyze 12 batches of commercial products of SHL produced by four different manufacturers. The results indicated that 57.52-78.11% (w/w) of SHL could be quantitatively determined (non-saccharide small molecules: 1.77-3.75%, monosaccharides: 0.93-20.93%, macromolecules: 2.63-5.76% and sucrose: 49.20-65.94%). This study may provide a useful way to comprehensively evaluate the quality of SHL.",

As recorded in Chinese Pharmacopeia [4] , baicalin for Radix Scutellariae, chlorogenic acid for Flos Lonicerae Japonicae, forsythin for Fructus Forsythiae are selected as the chemical markers for quality evaluation. The most widely reported qualitative and quantitative analyses of SHL for the purpose of quality control have been documented using the high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) method for assaying only major chemical markers such as baicalin, chlorogenic acid and forysthin [7] [8] [9] . Chinese patent drugs may consist of http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jpba.2014.08.025 0731-7085/\u00a9 2014 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. hundreds or even thousands of components which are responsible for the therapeutic effects by synergistic and/or antagonistic interaction. And SHL has a complex chemical profile with a wide range of components, including phenylethanoid glycosides, lignans, quinic acids, saponins and flavonoids [10] . All these components might contribute to the therapeutic efficacy in different ways. Thus, identification and quantitative determination of only three active markers are not sufficient for quality control of SHL. Although a study published the qualitative analysis of 27 constituents of SHL by high performance liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (HPLC-MS) [11] and another study even detected 35 compounds, including prototype components and metabolites in human serum, after Shuang-Huang-Lian injection was administrated [12] , no significant improvement in the quantitative analysis has been made.",

FDA approval depends on both analysis of the drug and quantification of its components. So far, only two botanical drugs, Fulyzaq and Veregen have been approved by the FDA. Both of these drugs have complex chemical profiles, yet up to 90% of the chemical components can be quantitatively determined [13] [14] and quality can be evaluated. If Chinese patent drugs, including SHL, are to win FDA approval, a higher level of quantitative analysis must be achieved. Being the product of a water decoction, SHL contains both small molecules and macromolecules, particularly a large amount of carbohydrates including monosaccharides, oligosaccharides and polysaccharides. Published analytical methods missed these carbohydrates and could not fully meet the requirements of FDA. Thus, developing more powerful qualitative and quantitative methods is urgent for bringing SHL into the international market.",
