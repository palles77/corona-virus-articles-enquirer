The risk of seroconversion from discarded syringes is thought to be extremely low; however, the risk from deliberate assaults may be higher (eg, fresh blood, deeper wound, larger inoculation).",

The establishment of protocols based on local disease prevalence data and type of injury will make treatment more uniform. are indeed very useful first steps in developing diagnostic strategies for this new infectious disease. Nonetheless, I would like to discuss some areas of concern in interpreting and applying the results. First, it should be noted that in all of these studies, patients were only included if they had documented fever (body temperature >38\u00b0C [>100.4\u00b0F]). Although Chen et al 1 and Su et al 4 suggested that their scoring systems could be used in settings where mass screening for SARS is required, application will actually be limited to febrile patients with temperatures greater than 38\u00b0C (>100.4\u00b0F).",

In a study from our ED-based SARS screening clinic during the outbreak in Hong Kong (which included afebrile patients), it was shown that 19% of SARS patients initially presented without fever, and that radiographic evidence of pneumonia often preceded fever. 5 Therefore, a more useful tool for mass screening would have included fever or body temperature as a variable, thus allowing the evaluation of afebrile cases. 2 Furthermore, the study of Wang et al 3 actually enrolled only those cases that met the World Health Organization (WHO) criteria for suspected SARS. Although their scoring system was shown to have a sensitivity of 100%, this perfect figure will apply only specifically to those patients already screened as positive by the WHO criteria or case definition. Unfortunately, the WHO criteria for suspected SARS have been shown to have a sensitivity of only 26%. 5 In practice, therefore, if 100 SARS patients presented to the ED for screening, only 26 would be correctly triaged to undergo the scoring system evaluation. Thus, relying on this strategy, despite the implementation of a near-perfect decision rule, will still result in an unacceptable number of missed cases.",

It remains to be proven whether the scoring systems in these studies, given the limitations addressed by the authors, can significantly outperform chest radiography.",

Even without fever, they were admitted as long as there were infiltrates on chest radiography. Only 3 of them were finally confirmed to have SARS.
