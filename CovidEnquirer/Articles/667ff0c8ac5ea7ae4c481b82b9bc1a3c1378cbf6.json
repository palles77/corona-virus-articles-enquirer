We aimed to demonstrate capacity of the reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction/electrospray ionization mass spectrometry (RT-PCR/ESI-MS) platform to identify clinical relevant respiratory viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirate (NPA) samples and compare the diagnostic performance characteristics relative to conventional culture-and antigen-based methods. An RT-PCR/ESI-MS respiratory virus surveillance kit designed to detect respiratory syncytial virus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1-4, Adenoviridae types A-F, Coronaviridae, human bocavirus, and human metapneumovirus was evaluated using both mock-ups and frozen archived NPA (N = 280), 95 of which were positive by clinical virology methods. RT-PCR/ESI-MS detected 74/95 (77.9%) known positive samples and identified an additional 13/185 (7%) from culture-negative samples. Viruses that are nondetectable with conventional methods were also identified. Viral load was semiquantifiable and ranged from 2400 to N320 000 copies/mL. Time to results was 8 h. RT-PCR/ESI-MS showed promise in rapid detection of respiratory viruses and merits further evaluation for use in clinical settings.",

Briefly, the steps were as follows: 15-\u03bcL aliquots of each PCR reaction were desalted and purified using a weak anion exchange protocol as described elsewhere (Ward et al., 2004) . Accurate mass (61 ppm), high-resolution (M/dM.100 000 full-width halfmaximum) mass spectra were acquired for each sample using high-throughput ESI-MS protocols described previously (Sampath et al., 2007) . For each sample, approximately 1.5 \u03bcL of analyte solution was consumed during the 74-s spectral acquisition. Raw mass spectra were post-calibrated with an internal mass standard and deconvolved to monoisotopic molecular masses. Unambiguous base compositions were derived from the exact mass measurements of the complementary single-stranded oligonucleotides. Semiquan- Fig. 1 . Diagnostic algorithm of clinical virology laboratory for respiratory samples. Diagnostic algorithm used in clinical virology laboratory to detect respiratory viruses mainly divided into respiratory season or nonrespiratory season. Respiratory season defined as October to the following January (October to November for RSV, December to January for influenza). Immunochromatographic assays were used in respiratory season as the sole screening test for RSV and influenza, which will stop the testing algorithm if results are positive. Respiratory panel cocktail DFA tests serve for adenovirus, influenza A and B, parainfluenza types 1-3, and RSV, which will stop the testing algorithm if results are positive in nonrespiratory season or for those screened negative by immunochromatographic assays in respiratory season as well. RSV = respiratory syncytial virus; Flu = influenza A or B viruses; PIV = parainfluenza virus; HSV = herpes simplex virus; CMV = cytomegalovirus; hMPV = human metapneumovirus; DFA = direct fluorescent antibody test; CPE = cytopathic effect; RBC = red blood cells; ID = identified. titative results of pathogens were obtained by comparing the peak heights with the internal PCR calibration internal mass standard present in every PCR well at 100 molecules, which was also treated as the internal positive control in each well. A negative control was implemented in each batch of processing with sterile viral transport media as well.",

            "text": "We recognize several limitations of our design. First, the operation of RT-PCR/ESI-MS was performed almost a year after the initial tests done in clinical virology. Utilizing \"excess\" NPA obtained from clinical virology resulted in some specimens not being processed until more than a year after collecting them from patients. Although the effect of length of storage of NPA has been shown to be minimal within 2 months (Ward et al., 2004) , the impact of longer periods of storage remains unknown. Ward et al. (2004) demonstrated that multiple freezingthawing cycles did not significantly alter the concentrations measured before freezing the influenza samples, while Frisbie et al. (2004) indicated influenza RNA could degrade in the \u221270\u00b0C freezer and may result in some loss of sensitivity. The second limitation is that we could not send every specimen for secondary analyses because of insufficient volume of some samples. This is an inherent limitation of the retrospective design used here. However, because almost half of the discordant results was verified by another PCR-based method (12 out of 25), it might have little impact on the estimate. Future study is merited to perform parallel comparison on every sample by another reference test (e.g., another PCR-based method) to better characterize the performance of the platform. Third, we could not test the performance of RT-PCR/ESI-MS on every subtype of clinically relevant respiratory viruses because of the design of the study. For those viral subtypes not demonstrated in this pilot study (i.e., parainfluenza types 2 and 4, adenovirus types A and D-F), further study will be required to determine the performance of this novel platform. Lastly, we only performed 5 repeats in the LOD experiment, in which we utilized the 100% detection (5/5) criteria to determine the LOD but not the 95% detection rule that generally applied in LOD studies. Although the fewer repeats in our study may have limitation in precision of the LODs, the 100% detection still should be considered a conservative estimate in this pilot study that could provide some evidence for further studies.",

Detection of conventional viruses missed by clinical virology and unconventional viruses required additional confirmatory testing to further determine the performance characteristics. The RT-PCR/ESI-MS method is a promising diagnostic platform for the rapid identification of conventional and unconventional viruses and merits further prospective evaluation.",
