Her condition deteriorated, and she was transferred to an intensive care unit (ICU). Her condition remained poor, and on May 29, 18 days after her symptoms began, she died of progressive respiratory failure. Patient 1 had not traveled to Saudi Arabia, but she had had close contact with a woman who had influenza-like illness and who had traveled to Saudi Arabia 2 weeks before her symptoms began. This contact of patient 1 is suspected of being the index case-patient, but when throat swab and sputum samples were collected from her, she had no symptoms, and PCR results were negative. A serum sample was not tested because serologic testing for MERS-CoV was not available.",

In this cluster, patient 1 was in close contact with a person suspected of being the index case-patient, but we were unable to verify the infection status of this patient. Patient 2 seems to have acquired the infection from patient 1. The source of infection for patients 3 and 4 was patient 1 or 2, but the source for patient 5's infection remains unknown. However, subclinical cases of MERS-CoV infection have been reported to the World Health Organization (7); exposure to a person with subclinical infection could explain an active infection that has an unknown route of transmission. Throat swab specimens and sputum samples were collected from all close contacts of the 5 patients in this cluster, including family members, other patients in the hospital, and health care workers. All samples were negative for MERS-CoV. Patient 1 had a pregnant daughter who was a frequent visitor during her hospitalization but who tested negative for MERS-CoV by real-time RT-PCR.",

This finding suggests that, as with severe acute respiratory syndrome, MERS-CoV is not readily transmitted during the early phases of the disease (3), in contrast to the other human coronaviruses, which are transmitted early in the infection (2) . Early recognition of confirmed MERS-CoV infections and investigation of the contacts of these patients are critical for effective epidemic control. Because Saudi Arabia has reported the highest number of MERS-CoV infections, one approach for limiting the transmission of this virus may be to screen travelers from Iran who report SARI to detect MERS-CoV. However, screening of pilgrims from Iran who traveled to Mecca during the 2013 Hajj did not detect MERS-CoV infections (National Influenza Center Iran, unpub. data).",
