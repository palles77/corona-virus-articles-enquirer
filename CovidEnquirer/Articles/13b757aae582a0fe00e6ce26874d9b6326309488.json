In 2002, the management of C Airlines decided to purchase new aircrafts over a 2-3 year period, including 13 747-400, two 737-800, two A340-300 and six A330. After implementing this fleet renewal and simplification plan, C Airlines will be one of the youngest fleets in this industry, rivaling those of the major international airlines. Additionally, it is expanding its routes to 50 cities in 25 countries. In 2002, total operating revenue reached NT$73,117 million, an increase of 4.6% over 2001, while total operating costs rose by 1.9% to reach NT$67,841 million.",

First, a positive production variance indicates that actual supply exceeds actual sales of flight capacity. In 2002, the actual supply and sales of passenger capacity of C airlines was 35,671,875 and 26,806,371 seat kilometers, respectively, yielding 8,865,504 seat kilometers of idle potential passenger load, or 24.85%.",
