The genetic diversity of viruses is commensurately enormous and might substantially exceed the diversity of cellular organisms. Unlike cellular organisms with their uniform replication-expression scheme, viruses possess either RNA or DNA genomes and exploit all conceivable replication-expression strategies. Although viruses extensively exchange genes with their hosts, there exists a set of viral hallmark genes that are shared by extremely diverse groups of viruses to the exclusion of cellular life forms. Coevolution of viruses and host defense systems is a key aspect in the evolution of both viruses and cells, and viral genes are often recruited for cellular functions. Together with the fundamental inevitability of the emergence of genomic parasites in any evolving replicator system, these multiple lines of evidence reveal the central role of viruses in the entire evolution of life.",

Since then, the developments in virology and genomics have completely changed the concept of viruses. We now realize that viruses are ubiquitous and enormously abundant, in terms of both infecting all known cellular life forms and being present in all explored environments. Actually, viruses appear to be the most abundant biological entities on the planet, substantially outnumbering cells in most well-studied habitats [1,2 ,3 ] . The genetic diversity of viruses is enormous as well: the majority of distinct genes in the biosphere seem to reside in viral genomes [4] . Beyond their quantitative dominance, virus genome sizes, gene repertoires and particle sizes and shapes are extremely variable. Moreover, viruses exploit all theoretically conceivable strategies of genome replication and expression, in contrast to the uniform replication-expression cycle of cellular life forms.",

Not only do viruses hijack host genes for counter-defense and other functions, but cellular hosts as well routinely recruit viral genes for diverse roles. Viruses that evolve at high rates might comprise the principal source of novel genes in the biosphere [8] .

In a sharp contrast, viruses exploit effectively all possible combinations of DNA and RNA interconversions: the replicating genome that is incorporated into virions can be represented by either RNA or DNA, and the replication-expression cycles of RNA viruses can include a DNA intermediate and vice versa ( Figure 1 ) [11, 12] . Furthermore, the selfish elements with the smallest known genomes, the viroids, are autonomously replicating small non-coding RNAs [13] .",

Moreover, the giant viruses clearly fall within the genome size range of prokaryotes. The virus genome sizes is tightly linked to the genome structure and replication-expression strategy: the genomes that are larger than $30 kb always consist of dsDNA, conceivably due to physical constraints on genome stability and topological malleability.

This exploration is feasible because viruses, being the ultimate parasites, possess small genomes that can be efficiently replicated as all forms of nucleic acids. Virus replication-expression cycles include the simplest scheme that is conceivable in the RNA-protein world (positive-strand RNA viruses use the same molecule for replication and translation), the transition from RNA to DNA genomes (reversetranscribing viruses and elements), and the 'invention' of large dsDNA genomes. Therefore, it is tempting to think of the virus world as the primordial genomic 'laboratory', perhaps the direct descendant of a pre-cellular stage of evolution [12] . However, the emergence of different classes of viruses through the 'escape' of different forms of host nucleic acids is conceptually plausible as well.

In each sequenced virome, the great majority of the sequences represent 'dark matter', that is, have no detectable homologs in the current databases, and there is no sign of saturation as sequencing progresses [4, 23, 24] . Although complete viral genomes typically contain a greater fraction of genes with homologs than viromes, these genomes also encompass numerous ORFans, that is, genes that are restricted to a narrow virus group [25] . Analysis of the phyletic spread of bacteriophage genes using the Phage Orthologous Groups (POGs) has shown that an overwhelming majority of the POGs include a small number of phages and viruses of archaea, whereas none are represented in the majority of the analyzed genomes ( Figure 2) [26 ]. This seemingly unlimited diversity of virus genes contrasts the case of cellular organisms that include a substantial core of common genes [27] . Although precise estimates of the total 548 Virus evolution gene pools of viruses and cellular organisms require better sampling and more sophisticated models of evolution than those currently available, it is almost certain that a majority of the distinct genes in the biosphere reside in viral genomes. Thus, viruses are likely to represent the principal reservoir of genetic diversity on earth.",

These 'viral hallmark genes' encode the essential viral functions including the capsid protein of icosahedral viruses, RNA and DNA polymerases, distinct helicases involved in genome replication, integrases that catalyze insertion of viral DNA into host genomes, and several others ( Figure 3 ).

Moreover, under a plausible evolutionary scenario, the nucleus itself evolved as a defense device against prokaryotic self-splicing introns that invaded the protoeukaryote genome to later give rise to spliceosomal introns [67, 68] . In the same vein, the mechanism of programmed cell death that is essential for normal development in plants and animals [69] originally evolved as a distinct strategy of antivirus defense (see above) that already implies a primitive form of cell differentiation. As generalized by Aravind and colleagues [64 ] , ''biological conflict systems served as evolutionary 'nurseries' for innovations in the protein world'', and such innovations were central to major evolutionary transitions, in particular eukaryogenesis.",

Moreover, the majority of the genomic DNA in many animals and plants (up to two-thirds in humans and 90% in maize) appears to derive from mobile elements, primarily retrotransposons [76, 77 ] . Although most of these elements are non-functional, some are inevitably recruited for various roles, in particular regulatory ones, and given the extreme abundance of retroelements, the overall contribution of such recruitment appears to be quite substantial [9, 76] . Beyond these general trends, striking examples of key gene recruitment from selfish elements include the telomerase, an RT that is required from chromosome end replication in all eukaryotes and apparently was recruited from a bacterial Group II intron [34 ,78] , and syncytins, membrane proteins that are essential for placental development in mammals and were derived from retrovirus envelope glycoproteinencoding genes [79 ].",

Accordingly, cellular life forms evolved elaborate compartmentalization along with multiple defense strategies, embarking on the perennial arms race. Under this scenario, virus-like genomic parasites and the onset of the arms race far antedate the advent of moderntype cells and were key factors in the emergence of the cellular organization of life. Moreover, the first genomic parasites that consisted of RNA might have been the driving force behind the origin of DNA genomes because mathematical modeling suggests that dedicated information storage devices such as DNA can stabilize coevolution in a host-parasite system [86 ] .",

This coevolution in all likelihood has started within primitive replicator systems and was essential for the major evolutionary transitions such as the emergence of DNA genomes, cellular organization and later the eukaryotic cell.

This review article examines distinct evolutionary scenarios underlying the relationships between viruses that infect animals and plants including evolution from a common ancestral virus antedating the divergence of plants and animals; horizontal transfer of viruses, for example, by insect vectors; and, parallel origin of animal and plant viruses from related genetic elements. Comparative genomic evidence suggests that each of these scenarios was important in the evolution of different groups of viruses. 30.
