P. multocida grows on blood agar and dextrose starch agar but not on Mac-Conkey's agar. Some strains may require fresh blood for growth on nutrient agar, with cultural characteristics influenced by the type of blood used. Colonies grow larger and produce greenish discoloration on media with horse blood. P. multocida produces a distinctive odor, which bacteriologists liken to that of indole. Growth occurs under aerobic conditions or in 5% carbon dioxide.",

These characteristics are useful in distinguishing P. multocida from other Pasteurella species that may be part of the normal flora. 26 Serotypes Serologic typing is done with the use of indirect hemagglutination, to identify capsular types A, B, D, E, or F, and the gel diffusion precipitin test, which has been used to describe 16 somatic antigen determinants of lipopolysaccharide. The acriflavine flocculation test is specific for capsular type D strains, whereas a staphylococcal hyaluronidase inhibition test specifically inhibits type A strains. With these tests, most isolates from rabbits were shown to be of type A. Serotypes vary by region, but in the United States, A:12 and A:3 are the most prevalent types. 22 Okerman and co-workers 24 substantiated the conclusion of Webster and Smith that some strains of P. multocida are more pathogenic than others. Capsular type D isolates from rabbits with bacteremia are significantly more pathogenic for mice than are type A isolates from rabbits with rhinitis only. Somatic type 3 isolates are more pathogenic than type 12 isolates. 22 Sodium dodecyl sulfate-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) provides enhancement of differentiation among P. multocida isolates from rabbits. 11 Single-primer polymerase chain reaction (PCR) fingerprinting is efficient and reproducible for discriminating P. multocida isolates. 10 Virulence factors Virulence factors of P. multocida include adhesions, phagocyte resistance, endotoxin (lipopolysaccharide), exotoxin, and iron regulation. Pili or other adhesion proteins on the outer membrane of some strains of P. multocida enhance colonization. Type A strains are more adhesive to respiratory mucosa than are type D strains. Invasion and multiplication of the organism occur because the capsule, largely consisting of hyaluronic acid, which also is present in host tissues, inhibits phagocytosis and complement-activated bactericidal activity of serum (opsonization). Some type D strains, although ingested by phagocytes, resist bactericidal activity. Leukotoxic enzymes also are produced. Growth of some strains of P. multocida is regulated by the availability of iron, and most strains produce iron-binding outer membrane proteins, which enhance their survival in iron-poor cavities of the hosts.",

Adhesion to endothelial receptors may explain association of some strains with pneumonia and septicemia. 2 Endotoxin enhances resistance to bactericidal activity of serum and stimulates the release of inflammatory mediators, such as interleukin-1. In cases of bacteremia, free endotoxin in plasma causes fever and depression and may induce shock. A toxin with characteristics of an exotoxin is produced by some strains of P. multocida. PMT of some type D strains enhances attachment and colonization of mucosa. This protein toxin, which is similar to that causing atrophic rhinitis in pigs, also is associated with nasal turbinate atrophy in rabbits. Toxin has been demonstrated for type D 26 and for type A isolates, 15 but it is not clear whether it is the same toxin. Purified PMT induces pneumonia, pleuritis, lymphoid atrophy, and possibly osteoclastic bone resorption in rabbits. 6 Antibiotic sensitivities Antibiotic sensitivities for 42 isolates of P. multocida from rabbits are as follows: 100% were sensitive to chloramphenicol, erythromycin, novobiocin, oxytetracycline, penicillin G, nitrofurazone, and nitrofurantoin; most were resistant to sulfonamides and streptomycin; and all were resistant to lincomycin and clindamycin. In my laboratory, four strains of P. multocida from rabbits were resistant to erythromycin and had moderate or intermediate sensitivity to penicillin G but otherwise were sensitive to 16 antibiotics, including several fluoroquinolones and cephalosporins. In my practice, most isolates of P. multocida tested on Mueller-Hinton agar with 5% sheep blood have been sensitive to amikacin, chloramphenicol, ciprofloxacin, doxycycline, enrofloxacin, gentamicin, penicillin G, tetracycline, and trimethoprim-sulfa.",

Exudate adheres to the fur around the nares ( Fig. 17-1) , and, because rabbits groom the face with their forepaws, to the medial aspects of the forepaws, where it mats and becomes yellowish-gray on drying. Affected rabbits often make audible sonorous noises and have bouts of sneezing, with exudate forcibly expelled from the nares.

There is an inverse relationship between B. bronchiseptica and P. multocida in rabbitries: weanlings have higher rates of infection with B. bronchiseptica, whereas P. multocida usually predominates in adults. 12 Experimentally, intranasal inoculation of B. bronchiseptica caused serous nasal discharge, bronchopneumonia, and pleuritis in suckling or weanling rabbits. 17 Sinusitis and bronchopneumonia due to B. bronchiseptica resulted when local host defense was reduced. 4 B. bronchiseptica is pathogenic in guinea pigs, dogs, cats, and pigs. It adheres to ciliated mucosa, resists respiratory clearance, induces ciliostasis, and reduces macrophage adherence and phagocytosis. 38 Cytotoxic B. bronchiseptica enhances colonization by toxigenic P. multocida. 16 Therefore B. bronchiseptica is suspected as a copathogen or predisposing factor in P. multocida infections. More pathogenic strains of B. bronchiseptica may exist. For example, an investigation of upper respiratory tract infections in rabbits from a colony of inbred rabbits showed them free of P. multocida; however, the nares were colonized by B. bronchiseptica, which was resistant to several commonly used antibiotics (B. J. Deeb and R. DiGiacomo, unpublished data). Clinically, I have seen numerous cases of rhinitis associated with pure cultures of B. bronchiseptica.
