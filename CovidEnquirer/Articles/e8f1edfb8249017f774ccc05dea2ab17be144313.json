However, it is unclear whether OAS proteins have a role in regulating gene expression. Here, we show that OAS1 and OAS3 act as negative regulators of the expression of chemokines and interferonresponsive genes in human macrophages. Clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats (CRISPR)-CRISPR-associated protein-9 nuclease (Cas9) technology was used to engineer human myeloid cell lines in which the OAS1 or OAS3 gene was deleted. Neither OAS1 nor OAS3 was exclusively responsible for the degradation of rRNA in macrophages stimulated with poly(I:C), a synthetic surrogate for viral double-stranded (ds)RNA. An mRNA sequencing analysis revealed that genes related to type I interferon signaling and chemokine activity were increased in OAS1 \u2212/\u2212 and OAS3 \u2212/\u2212",

The human OAS family consists of four genes, OAS1 (p40/p46; the short form), OAS2 (p69/p71; the intermediate form), OAS3 (p100; the long form), and OASL (OAS-like protein; p59), which are located on chromosome 12. Because OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3 can synthesize 2', 5'-oligoadenylates (2-5A) from ATP upon binding to double-stranded (ds)RNA, it was thought that these three enzymes are involved in the activation of ribonuclease L (RNaseL) during viral infection (3) . During infection with RNA viruses, viral dsRNA directly binds to and activates OAS1-3, resulting in the production of 2-5A from ATP (4); 2-5A leads to the dimerization and activation of RNaseL, which cleaves viral and host RNA, thereby blocking viral replication and inhibiting viral protein synthesis (5) .",

A lower concentration of dsRNA is needed for OAS3 activation than for OAS1 activation, and 2-5A synthesized by OAS3 is longer than the 2-5A synthesized by OAS1 (11) . A structural study of human OAS3 revealed that it is specialized for binding long dsRNA (12) . Moreover, consistent with these properties of OAS3, it was recently reported that OAS3 is mainly responsible for activating RNaseL during viral infection of human cell lines (the lung carcinoma cell line A549 and the fibrosarcoma cell line HT1080) (13) . However, there are large differences in the basal expression of OAS proteins among different cell types (14) , which results in cell-type-specific effects. Activation of the OAS/RNaseL pathway increased IFN production in fibroblasts, which have low levels of OASs, but suppressed it in macrophages, which have high basal levels of OASs (15) . Although OAS3 is a dominant factor for RNaseL activation in fibroblasts, it is possible that other OASs might play this role in macrophages, and/or that OAS3 itself plays a different role in macrophages. In addition, because OAS3 has a nuclear import sequence and is mainly localized to the cytoplasm and nucleus, OAS3 proteins may have a role in gene regulation during viral infection (16) . Therefore, investigating OAS3-induced genes during viral infection in the major viral target-cell type, human macrophages, is required to understand the antiviral immune response.",

OAS3 \u2212/\u2212 cells stimulated with intracellular poly(I:C) showed strong transcriptional changes (more than four-fold) in 244 genes, mostly enriched in the innate immune-response ontology group (Fig. 2A) . In general, OAS1 \u2212/\u2212 dTHP-1 cells transfected with poly(I:C) showed a transcription profile similar to that of OAS3 \u2212/\u2212 cells. However, several genes were significantly increased or decreased by intracellular poly(I:C) in OAS3 \u2212/\u2212 cells but not in WT or OAS1 \u2212/\u2212 cells. The genes that were upregulated in both OAS1 \u2212/\u2212 and OAS3 \u2212/\u2212 cells were predominantly involved in type I IFN signaling, viral defense responses, and chemokine activity, whereas the genes that were downregulated were mostly involved in transforming growth factor-\uf062 (TGF-\uf062) signaling, nuclear envelope organization, and negative regulation of intrinsic apoptosis signaling ( Fig. 2A and Supplementary Table 1 ). Focusing on the genes related to type I IFN signaling, transcripts encoding IFN regulatory factor 7 (IRF7), ISG15, ISG20, IFN-induced protein with tetratricopeptide repeats 1 (IFIT1), guanine nucleotide-binding protein 1 (GBP1), and OASL were all upregulated in OAS1 \u2212/\u2212 and OAS3 \u2212/\u2212 cells treated with intracellular poly(I:C) compared with WT cells (Fig. 2B ).

Next, the intracellular poly(I:C)-induced expression of type I IFN signaling genes and chemokine family genes was confirmed by qRT-PCR.

However, no attempt has been made to generate knock-out cell lines of these genes in human macrophages. In this study, we demonstrate that OAS1 and OAS3 have a role in gene regulation in human THP-1 macrophages. First, the expression of OAS1 and OAS3 is not required for RNaseL activation in dTHP-1 cells. Furthermore, OAS3 suppresses the expression of type I IFN signaling-related genes in response to stimulation by RIG-I and MDA5, whereas OAS1 suppresses the expression of chemokines after stimulation via TLR3 and TLR4. The observation that intracellular poly(I:C) induced rRNA degradation in dTHP-1 cells despite the absence of OAS1 or OAS3 suggested that OAS1 and OAS3 might be able to compensate for each other's loss in macrophages. These results are not consistent with those of a previous study in which OAS3 knock-out human lung carcinoma and fibrosarcoma cells had deficient RNaseL activation because of disrupted 2-5A synthesis (13) . However, OAS1, OAS2, and OAS3 can all synthesize 2-5A in vitro in human cell lines, and their basal expression is higher in macrophages than in fibroblasts (11, 15) . Thus, the ability of each OAS family member to induce 2-5A synthesis may differ by cell type. In addition, the use of double or triple knock-outs of OAS genes in dTHP-1 cells is needed to evaluate compensation for OAS protein loss.",

Because RIG-I and MDA5 activate mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS) on the mitochondrial membrane (26) , one possibility is that OAS3 may inhibit the ability of MAVS to induce innate immunity. Interestingly, a proteomic analysis of the human innate immunity interactome indicated that OAS3 interacts with MAVS (27) .

            "text": "In summary, our study provides the first evidence that OAS1 and OAS3 are involved in the negative regulation of the innate antiviral response in human macrophages. OAS1 regulates the expression of chemokines and IFN-responsive genes following stimulation via TLR3 and TLR4, whereas OAS3 regulates the expression of these genes following stimulation via RIG-I-and MDA5. These findings suggest that OAS proteins regulate host innate immune signaling in macrophages, which has broad implications for the treatment of viral diseases.",

(A-C) WT and OAS3 \u2212/\u2212 dTHP-1 cells were transfected with 1 \uf06dg/ml poly(I:C) for 6 h, and the mRNA levels of (A) CCL2, (B) CCL8, and (C) CXCL10 were quantified by qRT-PCR. (D-F) WT and OAS3 \u2212/\u2212 dTHP-1 cells were transfected with 1 \uf06dg/ml HMW or LMW poly(I:C) for 6 h. The secretion of (D) CCL2, (E) CCL8, and (F) CXCL10 was measured by ELISA. Data are representative of at least three independent experiments. *P \uff1c 0.05 (two-tailed unpaired Student's t-test). activates TLR3 (18). OAS1 and OAS3 are highly induced at the mRNA level by extracellular poly(I:C) (21). Thus, we analyzed the kinetic expression of the chemokines CCL2, CCL8, and CXCL10 in WT, OAS1 \u2212/\u2212 , and OAS3 \u2212/\u2212 dTHP-1 cells after poly(I:C) treatment. Unexpectedly, OAS1 \u2212/\u2212 dTHP-1 cells showed high levels of expression of these chemokines at 9 and 24 h after poly(I:C) stimulation, compared with the levels in WT or OAS3 \u2212/\u2212 cells",
