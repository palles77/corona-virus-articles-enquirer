            "text": "KEYWORDS Leukotriene B4; Neutrophils; Innate defense; Rhinitis; Rhinovirus Summary Background: Leukotriene B4 (LTB4) recruits and activates neutrophils. Accordingly, this leukotriene is involved in innate defense actions. Objective: To examine if nasal LTB4 can produce neutrophil activity and to explore whether or not LTB4 can condition neutrophils to exert virucidal effects in vitro and in vivo. Methods: 1. Twenty-three healthy subjects received nasal LTB4 in a randomized and shamcontrolled design. Symptoms were scored and nasal lavages carried out. Myeloperoxidase (MPO) and a-defensins were monitored as indices of neutrophil activity. IL-8, eosinophil cationic protein (ECP) and a 2 -macroglobulin were measured as indices of pro-inflammatory cytokine production, eosinophil activity, and plasma exudation. 2. Supernatants from neutrophils activated by LTB4 in vitro were assayed for virucidal activity against respiratory viruses. 3. In 38 healthy individuals, nasal inoculation with human rhinovirus-16 (HRV-16) was performed. In a preliminary study, intervention with LTB4 was given in a randomized and controlled design. Symptoms, virus replication, and antibody-titres were monitored. Results: 1. LTB4 produced statistically significant increases in MPO and a-defensins, whereas IL-8, ECP, and a 2 -macroglobulin were unaffected. 2. The supernatants efficiently killed human coronavirus, respiratory syncytial virus, and influenza B virus. 3. HRV-16 replication was lower in subjects receiving LTB4, but this difference failed to reach statistical significance. Common cold symptoms and incidence of seroconversion were unaffected. Conclusion: Nasal LTB4 induces a selective recruitment/activation of neutrophils. LTB4 can condition neutrophils to exert virucidal effects in vitro and may reduce virus replication in vivo. We suggest that the condition induced by LTB4 reflects an enhanced state of innate defense. \u00aa 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved.",

The effect was numerically greater 1 h post challenge than at 4 h, indicating a rapid and transient response. Our finding that LTB4 was rapidly cleared from the nasal mucosa (w1% retrievable by lavage within 1 h of nasal administration) might account for this effect profile. In agreement with the present findings, Martin et al. 12 in a study involving healthy subjects, showed that bronchial instillation of 10 ml of a 5x10 \u00c07 M solution of LTB4 (w1.7 mg) increased neutrophil numbers in BAL-fluids.

The levels were increased by LTB4 by a median 5-fold at 1 h following challenge with 2.0 mg LTB4. a-Defensins were consistently increased also at the other observation points (c.f. sham), but these changes failed to reach statistical significance. The wide distribution of data for a-defensins, and the fact that the alkaline buffer (sham) appeared to increase the baseline, might have contributed to our failure to detect a specific LTB4-induced effect more convincingly. However, observations by Flamand et al. 10, 23 indicated increased plasma levels of a-defensins in monkeys and humans following intravenous administration of LTB4. Furthermore, in the present study, neutrophils activated in vitro by LTB4 released factors with virucidal activities against human coronavirus, RSV, and influenza B virus: these results extend previous observations demonstrating the release of antimicrobial compounds (including a-defensins) following stimulation of neutrophils with LTB4. 10 Taken together, the present observations suggest that a-defensins are a part of the innate defense system of the upper respiratory tract and that this feature can be enhanced by nasal administrations of LTB4. IL-8 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that attracts neutrophils: e.g., intranasal administration of recombinant human IL-8 increases neutrophil numbers in nasal smears. 24 In this study, nasal lavage fluid levels of IL-8 were unaffected by topical administration of LTB4. Accordingly, the recorded increase in neutrophil activity (i.e., elevated levels of MPO) might not involve an IL-8-dependent mechanism. This is in contrast to conditions characterized by increased neutrophil activity, e.g., viral infections, where IL-8 is thought to be central in mediating a neutrophil response. 18 Conversely, the present observations are in keeping with the notion that neutrophil activity mediated by LTB4 may not be a disease-like mechanism, but rather a feature of the innate immune defense system.",

Data are expressed as median AE IQR (n Z 23). ) Denotes p < 0.05 and )) p < 0.01, paired comparisons. exposure to LTB4 in vivo. Together, these observations suggest an association between LTB4 and eosinophil activity. In contrast, in the present study, while LTB4 increased the generation of MPO, lavage fluid levels of ECP were unaffected, indicating that nasal granulocyte activity mediated by LTB4 in the human nasal airway does not involve eosinophils. We cannot exclude the possibility that LTB4 may increase eosinophil activity if elevated numbers of eosinophils would be present at the time of challenge, e.g., as in on-going allergic rhinitis or asthma (LTB4 has been administered to bronchial airways of patients with mild asthma, but without focus on airway eosinophil activity 14 ). However, so far, available human in vivo observations with LTB4 argue against a role for LTB4 as a pro-eosinophil factor. For example, a LTB4 receptor antagonist had no effects on allergen-induced eosinophilia in asthma. 28 Plasma exudation is a key feature of airway inflammation. The process comprises extravasation and luminal entry of bulk plasma, including high molecular weight proteins such as a 2macroglobulin (725 kDa). It can be monitored through analysis of plasma proteins in mucosal surface liquids. 29 Accordingly, in airway diseases characterized by inflammation, levels of plasma proteins in nasal lavage-and BAL-fluids may reflect the degree of on-going inflammation. 29 In this, lavage fluid levels of a 2 -macroglobulin were unaffected following LTB4 challenge, indicating that this leukotriene does not exert plasma exudation producing effects in human nasal airways at the dose used. In contrast, Bende et al. 30 in a study on anesthetized rabbits, reported increased vascular permeability following nasal challenge with LTB4. We have no specific explanation for the discrepant findings, but species differences may be one reason. 29 The present observation is in agreement with observations in man by Martin et al. 12 : Figure 2 LTB4 conditions neutrophils to exert antiviral effects; Supernatants from neutrophils conditioned with LTB4 produced virucidal effects against human coronavirus (A), RSV (B), and influenza B virus (C). Control experiments indicated that the effect was specific for the interaction between LTB4 and neutrophils.

Available observations in man thus suggest that LTB4, in doses that produce increased neutrophil activity, does not produce exudative inflammation.",

            "text": "Bachert et al. 31 reported an interesting temporal relationship between increased levels of MPO in nasal secretions and a fall in virus replication in naturally acquired infections. The finding suggests that a heightened neutrophil activity is beneficial in the context of viral exposure of the upper respiratory tract. This is indirectly supported by the present in vitro observations that LTB4-activated neutrophils produce factors active against respiratory viruses. Moreover, previous studies have implicated neutrophils as an important player in the response to such infections, 32e35 and Gaudreault et al. demonstrated that i.v. LTB4 upregulated antimicrobial peptides and reduced viral load in influenza infected mice in vivo. 36 In line with this, we employed HRV-16 inoculations and explored the effect of repeated nasal administration of LTB4 on rhinovirus infections in a preliminary study. The dose investigated (2.0 mg) was chosen based on the present doseresponse experiments involving LTB4, whereby increased neutrophil activity was induced without producing exudative inflammation or symptoms. We elected to use a low-dose (10 TCID 50 ) virus challenge as this has been shown to be effective in inducing colds in COPD-subjects. 37 Furthermore, we believe this to be a better model of natural transmission of virus infections (where inoculation occurs with very small amount of virus followed by replication up to high titres with resultant symptom induction) than would be the case with high-dose challenge model where inoculation with doses as high as 10,000 TCID 50 is performed. 22 In this study significant virus replication was observed three through five days following HRV-16 inoculation in the control group as a whole. Furthermore, this group presented mild, yet statistically significant, nasal symptoms of common cold and a minor increase in nasal mucosal output of IL-8. However, unlike high-dose challenge where w90% of subjects become infected, 22 only 12/20 control subjects seroconverted and 12/20 had evidence of virus replication with 6/20 having high virus titres. These lower than expected numbers of infected subjects likely hampered our ability to detect statistically significant effects on viral outcomes. Nonetheless, several of the present observations suggested that LTB4 might have affected virus replication. For example, the degree of viral shedding was reduced by nearly 50% in the LTB4-group compared with the control group. Also, of the top five virus-shedding individuals, four were found in the control group. However, likely in part reflecting an inferior power of the parallel group design, as well as the issue with numbers of infected subjects, the changes failed to reach statistical significance. While these data, together with our observations in vitro, were promising, symptoms and incidence of seroconversion were not affected by LTB4. Accordingly, LTB4 did not provide convincing evidence of a preventive treatment for common cold infections caused by HRV-16. Further studies with greater numbers of infected subjects, and properly powered using data from the present study, are warranted to explore whether or not nasal administration of LTB4 can be useful to prevent or treat upper respiratory tract infections. Also, it would be of interest to explore effects of LTB4 in bacterial infections, where neutrophil phagocytosis is of key importance to clear infections. 37 We conclude that nasal administration of LTB4 in the present dose-range produces increased nasal neutrophil activity, potentially reflecting an enhanced state of innate immune defense, without being associated with any apparent untoward effects. Furthermore, LTB4 has a potential to exert antimicrobial effects on respiratory tract infections. However, further studies in which LTB4 intervention is undertaken and where effects on respiratory infections are studied in vivo are warranted to confirm this hypothesis.",
