            "text": "The ORF6 protein is one of the eight accessory proteins of the severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Numerous properties of ORF6 have been documented and this study focuses on two of these, namely, its ability to suppress the expression of co-transfected expression constructs and its subcellular localization to vesicular structures. Results: Using a transient transfection system, ORF6's ability to suppress the expression of co-transfected expression constructs was measured in a quantitative manner. While ORF6 does not have a global effect on protein synthesis, quantitative real-time PCR revealed that it down-regulated the mRNA level of the co-transfected myc-nsp8 gene. Furthermore, alanine substitution of a diacidic cluster motif (aa53-56) in the ORF6 gene caused a reduction in the suppression of expression of co-transfected myc-nsp8 gene. Our previous study revealed that ORF6 localized to vesicular structures in SARS-CoV infected Vero E6 cells. Here, ORF6 was observed to be localized to similar vesicular structures in Vero E6 cells which have been transiently transfected with a mammalian expression plasmid encoding for untagged ORF6. ORF6 showed partial colocalization with cellular proteins CD63 and Lamp1, suggesting that the vesicular structures may be a subpopulation of endosomal/lysosomal vesicles. The alanine substitution of the diacidic cluster motif also altered the subcellular localization of the ORF6 protein, indicating a potential relationship between the subcellular localization of the ORF6 protein and its ability to suppress the expression of co-transfected expression constructs.",

            "text": "An outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 which carried with it a fatality rate of 8% was traced to a novel coronavirus dubbed the SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV). This novel coronavirus was eventually classified as a Group IIb coronavirus, a subset of the Group II coronaviruses. The subclassification was, in part, due to the presence of several accessory genes in the coronavirus which have no known homologs within the family Coronaviridae. These accessory genes have been the subject of study by many groups (for reviews, see 1 and 2) and have been assigned a plethora of physical characteristics and intracellular functions. Most importantly, almost all of these accessory genes have been shown to be dispensable for viral replication in cell culture, with the exception of the 3a accessory gene (3) . It has been suggested these accessory genes have subtle effects on SARS-CoV replication and may be more important for viral replication or pathogenesis in vivo.",

Most recently, the ORF6 protein has been suggested to induce intracellular membrane rearrangements resulting in a vesicular population in the infected cell which could possibly serve some role in increasing replication (10) . Such virus-induced or virus associated vesicles have previously been shown in other viral infections, such as protein trafficking in Herpes simplex virus (11) and Sendai virus (12) .

However, there has been, to date, little work done to link the subcellular localization of the ORF6 protein to its known functions. Gallagher and co-workers have shown that the ability of ORF6 to impede nuclear translocation resulted in the suppression of expression of transgenes from co-transfected expression constructs if these need transcription in the nucleus (17) . Using this knowledge, a simple co-transfection system and alanine substitution mutants in the ORF6 gene are used here to determine regions of the ORF6 protein that modulate its ability to suppress the expression of co-transfected myc-nsp8. The subcellular localization of these mutants is then examined by immunofluorescence experiments and compared to that of wildtype ORF6.",

The nsp8 gene from SARS-CoV was cloned using BamHI and XhoI sites into pXJ40myc to create pXJ40myc-nsp8, with an N-terminal myc tag for detection. GST was cloned into pXJ40flag to create pXJ40flag-GST, which expresses an N-terminal flag tagged GST protein.

Western blotting showed a dose-dependent reduction in the expression of nsp8, concomitant with an increase in the expression of ORF6 ( Figure 1A ). In order to determine the specificity of this effect, Vero E6 cells were cotransfected with another mammalian expression construct pXJflag-GST and pXJ3'-ORF6 in the same manner as previously done with the construct encoding for nsp8. When titrated against increasing amounts of ORF6 protein, the flag-tagged GST protein was also observed by Western Blotting to show reduced levels of expression in a dose-dependent manner ( Figure 1B) . Thus, it seems that ORF6 exerts an effect on the expression of transgenes from co-transfected expression constructs regardless of the nature of the transgenes. However, when increasing amounts of GST were titrated against nsp8 in the same manner, no significant reduction in nsp8 expression was observed, indicating that this effect was specific to the ORF6 protein ( Figure 1C ).",

Quantification of the signals in each lane of the resulting autoradiograph was performed and the readings were normalized to the reading in the lane from the untransfected cells ( Figure  2 ). When 1 \u03bcg of DNA was used, there is a slight decrease in the total cellular protein synthesis in ORF6 expressing cells when compared to cells which had been transfected with empty vector. However, almost the same degrees of decrease in the total cellular protein synthesis were observed in both pXJ3'HA and pXJ3'-ORF6 transfected cells when 2 \u03bcg of DNA was used. Hence, the decrease in total cellular protein synthesis observed seems to be related to the transfection process rather than the expression of ORF6.

Similarly, there was a significant degree of colocalization between the Lamp1 and ORF6 in transiently transfected Vero E6 cells ( Figure 4B) , indicating that the ORF6positive vesicles seen in both infected cells and transiently transfected Vero E6 cells were probably an identical population of vesicles. This allowed us to then use pXJ3'-ORF6-transfected Vero E6 cells to further study the characteristics of this vesicular population. In addition to Lamp1, CD63 (a marker for late endosomes) was used to examine the compartmental characteristics of the vesicles. As shown in Figure 4B , ORF6-positive vesicles coincide significantly with CD63-positive vesicles in Vero E6 cells. This population of vesicles is therefore a subset of the late endosomal and lysosomal populations, and shows that the plasmid system employed here yields similar colocalization of ORF6 with cellular markers as seen in previous infection work (5) .",

These motifs were also predicted by Netland and co-workers (4). In order to determine the contribution of these motifs to the function of the ORF6 protein, alanine substitutions were introduced by two-step PCR to yield ORF6A49-52, which substituted four alanine residues for the YSEL region, and ORF6A53-56, which substituted four alanines for the DDEE region ( Figure 5A ).",

It was observed that both mutants showed increased levels of expression compared to wildtype ORF6, and this observation was reproducible (data not shown). The effect of ORF6A49-52 mutant on the expression of the nsp8 gene was similar to wildtype ORF6 ( Figure 5B ). On the other hand, the nsp8 expression in the presence of ORF6A53-56 was higher than that in the presence of wildtype ORF6 ( Figure 5B ), which suggest that ORF6A53-56 is less efficient in suppressing the expression of co-transfected myc-nsp8. As the difference between wildtype ORF6 and ORF6A53-56 was subtle, a more quantitative approach to assay nsp8 expression was deemed necessary. Hence, Vero E6 cells were transfected in the same manner and instead RNA was extracted and reverse transcribed and subjected to SYBR Green QPCR using primers for nsp8. GAPDH was used as a housekeeping gene in order to normalize the expression levels seen. When pXJmyc-nsp8 was co-transfected with 1 \u03bcg of pXJ3'-ORF6, ORF6A49-52 or ORF6A53-56, the levels of nsp8 mRNA were similar ( Figure 5C ). However, at 2 \u03bcg, the levels of nsp8 mRNA for both ORF6 mutants were slightly higher than wild-type ORF6 ( Figure 5C ). In order to determine if these differences are statistically significant, 5 independent experiments were performed, and the results were then used to perform a t-test measuring the significance of the difference between nsp8 expression levels when either 2 \u03bcg of wildtype ORF6 or 2 \u03bcg of each mutant were used. The difference in nsp8 expression when co-transfected with either wildtype ORF6 and ORF6A49-52 is not statistically significant (a two-tailed p-value of 0.08). On the other hand, the difference in nsp8 expression when co-transfected with either wildtype ORF6 and ORF6A53-56 is statistically significant (a two-tailed pvalue of 0.01). This indicated that the reduction in the suppression of the expression of co-transfected myc-nsp8 by ORF6A53-56 was significant, and therefore that the putative diacidic motif defined by amino acids 53-56 has a role to play in this ability of the ORF6 protein.",

We have shown that ORF6 expressed in our system is functionally similar to that shown by others, by means of 2 assays. Firstly, the ORF6 expressed in our system is able to suppress the expression of a co-transfected CMV promoter-driven plasmid expressing either the nsp8 protein or GST. Secondly, the localization of ORF6 expressed via transient transfection was compared to the localization of virally expressed ORF6, and both display similar subcellular localization as well as colocalization to the Lamp1 marker. 16 hours post transfection, cells were harvested, lysed and subjected to Western Blotting using an antibody directed against either ORF6 or myc-nsp8. Actin was used as a loading control. Similar results were obtained in three independent experiments, and a representative set of data is presented. (C) Vero E6 cells were similarly transfected as in (A) and total RNA was harvested 16 hours later, reverse transcribed and subjected to SYBR-Green QPCR using specific primers for nsp8, with GAPDH as a housekeeping control. Relative quotients were calculated and plotted from the Ct values obtained, using the \u0394\u0394Ct method. The average values with standard deviations are plotted and the standard deviations are also shown in parentheses in the x-axis labels. Students' T-test was performed on selected results and the p-values are indicated. P < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. Similar results were obtained in five independent experiments, and a representative set of data is presented.",

            "text": "Using a bioinformatics approach to defining regions of interest in the ORF6 gene, we have identified 2 regions of interest, a putative lysosomal targeting motif YSEL between amino acids 49 to 52 and a putative diacidic motif DDEE between amino acids 53 to 56 ( Figure 5A ). Our results indicate that the putative diacidic motif is involved in both the suppression of expression of cotransfected expression constructs by ORF6 as well as its subcellular localization. While we were not able to completely restore the expression of co-transfected nsp8 in our system, the effect on nsp8 mRNA level between wildtype ORF6 and ORF6A53-56 was nonetheless found to be significantly different. However, the difference is small and suggests that the diacidic motif is largely dispensable for this function of ORF6. In contrast, the putative lysosomal targeting motif YSEL does not appear to contribute to these properties of ORF6 and this is consistent with a recent report that alanine substitution of the region from amino acids 49 to 53 fails to inhibit the ability of the protein to impede the nuclear translocation of STAT1 (9). Also, others have shown that the ORF6 protein induces membrane rearrangements and that the Cterminus of the protein is important to this function. Our results show that the region from amino acids 53 to 56 is involved in the subcellular localization of the ORF6 protein, since alanine substitution of this region results in a clustered-vesicle phenotype that is not observed with wildtype ORF6. The reason for the difference in the subcellular localization of wild-type ORF6 and ORF6A53-56 mutant is not clear. One possibility is that the substitutions of four acidic residues with alanine residues might have reduced the solubility of ORF6. Alternatively, the substitutions may have disrupted the interaction of ORF6 with certain host proteins.",

The implication of this is that the 2 functions may be inextricably linked. However, a cause-effect relationship has yet to be determined for these functions and in light of our findings, their relationship to the membrane rearrangements induced by the ORF6 protein should be examined in future studies. In addition, while the ability of ORF6 to suppress the expression of co-transfected expression constructs, was previously linked to the blockage of nuclear translocation (17) , further experiments are needed to ascertain if amino acids 53-56 are involved in regulating the nuclear translocation process. Authors' contributions VG carried out the experiments and drafted the manuscript. AM and YJT participated in the design of the study and coordination and revised the manuscript.
