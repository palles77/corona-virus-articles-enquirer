            "text": "Since the emergence of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrom Coronavirus (MERS-CoV) it has become increasingly clear that bats are important reservoirs of CoVs. Despite this, only 6% of all CoV sequences in GenBank are from bats. The remaining 94% largely consist of known pathogens of public health or agricultural significance, indicating that current research effort is heavily biased towards describing known diseases rather than the 'pre-emergent' diversity in bats. Our study addresses this critical gap, and focuses on resource poor countries where the risk of zoonotic emergence is believed to be highest. We surveyed the diversity of CoVs in multiple host taxa from twenty countries to explore the factors driving viral diversity at a global scale. We identified sequences representing 100 discrete phylogenetic clusters, ninety-one of which were found in bats, and used ecological and epidemiologic analyses to show that patterns of CoV diversity correlate with those of bat diversity. This cements bats as the major evolutionary reservoirs and ecological drivers of CoV diversity. Co-phylogenetic reconciliation analysis was also used to show that host switching has contributed to CoV evolution, and a preliminary analysis suggests that regional variation exists in the dynamics of this process. Overall our study represents a model for exploring global viral diversity and advances our fundamental understanding of CoV biodiversity and the potential risk factors associated with zoonotic emergence.",

It quickly spread to twenty-seven countries, infecting 8,098 people with 774 deaths, and was declared the first global pandemic of the 21st century. Bats were identified as the reservoir (Lau et al. 2005; Li et al. 2005 ) and probable source (Ge et al. 2013 ) of the outbreak. In 2012, the SARS pandemic was followed by MERS-Coronavirus (MERS-CoV), which emerged in the Middle East (Zaki et al. 2012 ) with 1,782 confirmed human cases and 640 deaths (as of September 2016). Camels were identified as the likely source of human infections (Reusken et al. 2013; Azhar et al. 2014) ; however, bats were again found to host closely related (MERS-like) viruses and are therefore assumed to be the original evolutionary source (Woo et al. 2006; Anthony et al. 2012; Corman et al. 2014a,b; Wacharapluesadee et al. 2015; Anthony et al. 2017) .",

Even non-human CoVs such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) may have emerged by host switching from other animals [bats (Tang et al. 2006; Huang et al. 2013) ]. Overall, it seems that CoV diversity in bats is substantial (Drexler et al. 2014) , that these viruses are prone to host switching (Woo et al. 2009) , and that they are a current, historic, and future threat to public health.",

Foremost, our knowledge of CoVs in resource-limited countries is poor (Drexler et al. 2014 ). This is particularly problematic given that many of these same areas are predicted to be hotspots of disease emergence (Jones et al. 2008) . Second, there has been little effort to understand the evolutionary and ecological drivers of CoV diversity on a global scale, or to evaluate host and regional variation in the factors that contribute to the risk of emergence (e.g. host switching). Indeed, most studies to date have been somewhat limited in their geographic scope and have included only small sample sizes with little epidemiologic or ecological context. In short, there is a critical need for a more global perspective on CoV diversity.",

Samples were also collected from humans (n \u00bc 1,124) in seven countries in central Africa and Asia as a pilot to begin to explore the propensity for viral sharing with wildlife. In all twenty countries, wildlife samples were collected from 'high risk' interfaces, where direct or indirect contact with humans might promote zoonotic viral transmission. The selected sampling sites included areas of land-use change (deforestation, conversion to agriculture); sites in and around human dwellings; foci of ecotourism; markets restaurants and farms along the animal value chain; and areas where occupational exposure was likely (animal sanctuaries, agricultural activities). When possible, individuals were identified to lowest taxonomic order (genus and species) and assigned to an age class (adult, subadult, neonate) by the field teams. All samples from swabs (e.g. oral, urine, rectal), fluids (e.g. saliva), and tissues were collected into (1) NucliSens V R Lysis Buffer (bioM\u00e9 rieux, Inc., Marcy-I' Etoile, France) and (2) viral transport media, and then frozen in the field in liquid nitrogen and transferred to the laboratory for storage at \u00c080 C. All animal sampling activities were conducted with permissions from local authorities and under the Institutional Animal Care and Use Committee at the University of California, Davis (protocol number: 16048).

The first [the 'Watanabe' assay (Watanabe et al. 2010) ] amplified a $434 bp fragment of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) corresponding to nucleotides (NTs) 15,156-15,589 in the human CoV OC43 genome (NC_005147), while the second [the 'Quan' assay (Quan et al. 2010) ] amplified a $332 bp fragment of a different peptide downstream of the RdRp, corresponding to NTs 18,323-18,654. Amplified products of the expected size were cloned and sequenced (traditional Sanger dideoxy sequencing) according to standard protocols, and sequences edited manually in Geneious Pro (ver 9.1.3, Biomatters, Auckland, NZ).

Thirty-four of these grid cells included areas from which bats were sampled (bats were identified down to the species level in thirty cells), and twenty-seven cells had samples testing positive for CoVs. If the coordinates listed for a particular bat were on the line between grid cells, it was arbitrarily included in the grid cell with higher latitude/longitude. Viral and host species richness for each cell was calculated by determining the total number of unique virus and bat species within each cell. Alpha diversity was calculated using the Shannon index (Jost et al. 2011 ), which was chosen over the Gini-Simpson index because it does not place disproportionate weight on dominant species. Since we do not know how representative our sampling was, the Shannon index was deemed the best approach. The effective number of viruses and bats in each cell was then correlated using Kendall's tau, since the values were not normally distributed. Sensitivity analyses were performed by shifting the grid cells in 1 increments and recalculating richness and effective species numbers.",

Another cophylogeny program, CoRe-PA (Merkle et al. 2010) , uses a parameter-adaptive approach to estimate an appropriate cost scheme without any prior value assignment. For our analysis, we used Jane with the default pre-determined cost scheme where cospeciation is the null hypothesis and, therefore, the 'cheapest' event, with the assumption that host switching would theoretically be more costly than genetic drift within a species to which a virus is already adapted. Analysis was repeated with varied cost values in Jane to test for sensitivity to our cost scheme, as well as in CoRe-PA for robustness, and event types and costs from each reconstruction were compared between the two programs. As these changes ultimately did not significantly influence the outcome of the analysis, exact event assignments used in the final analysis were inferred solely from Jane with the default cost scheme.",

We also distinguished between two potential types of host switching, based on an assumption that there could be differences in zoonotic risk between viruses that only move between closely related bats (e.g. those within the same genus) and those that are able to make more substantive jumps into distantly related species (those in other host genera or families). We therefore use 'host switching' to refer specifically to viral lineages that have moved into a host belonging to another genus or family, and 'sharing' to indicate a viral lineage that has moved into a different host species of the same genus (without speciating). We selected host genus as the cut-off to be consistent with current conventions of taxonomic hierarchy, and verified that the number of species per genus is relatively consistent between regions. We further verified that the mean genetic distance between host species is consistent between regions (i.e. that the taxonomic distance a virus has to navigate when moving between any two species is roughly similar in all three regions).",

Event data for all four reconstructions were aggregated for the analysis. Where host-virus associations were duplicated, one was removed. If the duplicated event types did not agree [which can occur given the sensitivity of these methods to variation in topology and number of taxa in each tree (Conow et al. 2010 )], we randomly selected one of the two possibilities and repeated the randomization 100 times. The GEE estimates from the 100 random iterations were then combined using rules established by Rubin (1987) . The analysis was repeated to explore variation based on bat family (independent variable). Some families only possessed one type of event, which would introduce quasicomplete separation into the GEE model, so they were excluded from the corresponding models. However, the numbers of bat species within these excluded families were very small (<5) compared to the overall number of bat species for the whole study, so we felt this would not impact any overall trends.",

Using this estimated coefficient, we calculated the estimated numbers of viruses (viral sequence clusters) that can be found with respect to the sampling effort (i.e. all possible numbers of collected animals within a species), and they were then used to plot the estimated curve together with its 95% confidence band. We clarify that we use the term 'expected' to indicate the statistical expectation based on the estimate of the regression model.

Groups that shared less than 90% identity to a known sequence were labeled sequentially as PREDICT_CoV-1, -2, -3 etc; while groups sharing !90% identity to a sequence already in GenBank were considered to be strains of a known virus and assigned the same name as the matching sequence (e.g. Kenya_bat_CoV_KY33 or HKU-9). Sequences that shared >90% identity but were found in different hosts were considered part of the same taxonomic unit. Based on these criteria, 100 discrete viral taxa were identified, ninety-one of which were found in bats (Table 1; Fig. 2 ). Importantly, we make no claims that these groups correspond to 'species' as full orf1ab replicase sequences would be required for that (King et al. 2012 ).

Overall, host switching was the dominant mechanism, followed by co-speciation (Fig. 5) . When analyzed by region, host switching (inter-genus transmission) remained dominant in Africa and Asia, but not in Latin America. Despite fewer host-switching events in Latin America, there was a concomitant increase in virus sharing (intra-genus transmission). This suggests that viruses are still switching hosts in Latin America but preferentially move between closely related species, while in Africa and Asia viruses cross between more distantly related species. To assess the sensitivity of our results to our chosen method (i.e. use of a pre-defined cost scheme in the program Jane), we repeated the analysis for the Quan alpha-CoV and beta-CoV reconstructions using CoRePA, a parameter-adaptive approach that estimates an appropriate cost scheme without any prior value assignment. Comparing the results, we noted 91% agreement between Jane and CoRePA in alpha-CoV reconstruction (thirty-four events, of which thirtyone agreed), and 100% agreement in the beta-CoV reconstructions (twenty-six events, all of which agreed). We further note that the cost scheme calculated in CoRePA was 0.7 for host switching and 0.1 for co-speciation-supporting the default cost scheme used in Jane (i.e. that host switching should be considered more 'costly' than co-speciation).",

For each region, the best model included specimen type, bat family (or in the case of Latin America, subfamily), season, and animal-human interface (Table 2) . Season was not included in the top model for Latin America, but the model with the season included was within two AIC (delta AIC \u00bc 1.06) and therefore considered to have as much support as the top model (Burnham and Anderson 2002) . Specimen type was highly associated with CoV positivity, and samples containing feces or fecal swabs were significantly more likely to test positive than other specimen types in all regions. Bat family was important in Asia and Africa. Season was also significant, with samples collected during the dry season more likely to test positive in Africa and Asia than those collected during the wet season (albeit with low odds ratios). Age class appears to be important, as sub-adults were more likely to test positive than adults in Africa and Asia. Sex was not related to CoV positivity in Asia or Latin America while males were slightly more likely to be CoV positive in Africa (OR \u00bc 1.5, 1.2-1.9 CI, P < 0.001). Broad categories of animal-human interfaces were significantly associated with CoV positivity among bats in all three regions: in Africa and Latin America, bats sampled at the animal use interface category were more likely to be positive, and in Asia, bats sampled at the animal use and human activities interfaces were more likely to be positive than those sampled at other interfaces. The significance of the animal interface in all three regions suggests that practices around animal use may be important for disease transmission.",

To this end, we surveyed the diversity of CoVs from twenty countries in Latin America, Africa, and Asia to identify global factors driving viral diversity and to look for regional differences in factors that contribute to the risk of emergence, such as host switching. In total, we identified sequences from 100 discrete phylogenetic clusters, ninety-one of which were found in bats. Our data suggest that the diversity of bat CoVs has been driven primarily by host ecology. First, viral richness was strongly correlated with bat richness, suggesting that most CoVs will be found in regions where bat diversity is highest. Second, we showed that CoV diversity separates into three distinct communities by region, echoing the distribution of bats and suggesting an ecological dependence on their hosts. And third, we identified particular associations between viral subclade and bat family, indicating that CoVs have evolved with (or adapted to) preferred families. Collectively, these data show that the global diversity and distribution of CoVs in bats is nonrandom and is driven by variation in the biogeography of bats.",

While we do not yet understand the factors driving this difference, if we assume that the risk of spillover to humans reflects the taxonomic distances that CoVs are able to jump (Kreuder Johnson et al. 2015) , our results would indicate a higher risk for zoonotic emergence in Africa and Asia [acknowledging that host switching is not the only important factor driving zoonotic emergence (Jones et al. 2008; Keesing et al. 2010; Karesh et al. 2012) ]. While evidence of regional variation in host switching has not been reported previously for viruses (to our knowledge), similar patterns have been observed in hemosporidian parasites (Ellis et al. 2015) .",

This suggests that although there is still a large number of coronaviruses that remain to be discovered, their detection remains an achievable goal, and we advocate for their discovery given the potential for even greater insights into the global ecology and evolution of these viruses (e.g. further investigation into regional differences in host switching), and the opportunity to elucidate their individual zoonotic potential (Ge et al. 2013; Wang et al. 2014; Yang et al. 2014; Anthony et al. 2017 ). Building on our study, we suggest that future surveillance efforts should consider the number of samples carefully and include up to 400 individuals (of either sex) per species in order to maximize the chance of detecting all CoVs, and that including less than 154 individuals per species might reduce the chance of finding even one virus and would likely produce a poor return on investment. We also recommend that feces (or rectal swabs) followed by saliva (or oral swabs) should be prioritized if resources are limited and all sample types cannot be processed, and that sampling should be biased towards immature animals and in the dry season.",

The 2b SARS clade was associated with rhinolophid and hipposiderid bats, so we plotted the distribution of all bat species belonging to these families to generate a map of viral diversity (richness). Based on this map, we would expect the greatest diversity of unknown 2b viruses to be found in South East Asia, which is consistent with previous studies describing 2b viruses in bats, but also in isolated pockets throughout Africa. In contrast, the 2c MERS clade was associated with vespertilionid bats, predicting that 2c diversity will be highest in Mexico, Europe, Central and South East Africa, and parts of South East Asia. Again, this is consistent with the distribution of 2c viruses reported here, and previously in the literature (Woo et al. 2007; Reusken et al. 2010; Anthony et al. 2012; Lelli et al. 2013; Corman et al. 2014a,b; Anthony et al. 2017 ) .",

            "text": "Certain limitations should be considered in the interpretation of our data. First, the diversity of CoV sequences detected is almost certainly biased by our sampling effort. A small number of species were sampled abundantly, thus maximizing our chances of finding a CoV (27/282 species had >110 individuals); however, most were under-sampled (232/282 with 50 individuals). While this biases the probability of finding a CoV towards the more abundantly sampled species, we stress that it also reflects the uneven distribution of naturally occurring communities (Magurran 2011) , and that targeting the very rare species would be prohibitively expensive. It is also unclear if population size has an effect on the number of viruses present in a species-e.g. do larger populations accommodate more viral diversity? Second our analysis only represents the 'last' evolutionary event identified. It does not represent, or account for, the complete evolutionary history of these lineages. Therefore, while a single event has been ascribed to each association (see 'Methods'), it does not preclude other events having an equal or greater impact in the past. We are limited to using this most recent event type in order to assign a single evolutionary event to each unique association. It should also be noted that events are dependent on the relationships observed in the reconstructed trees and could change as more viruses are added or longer sequences are used. Third, we have only generated partial sequences for analysis, which limits our ability to comment on the specific zoonotic potential of each virus or provide a comprehensive analysis of their genetic histories and taxonomy, for example, estimating the frequency or impact of recombination, which can be an important driver of host switching and disease emergence (Anthony et al. 2017) . We certainly support fullgenome sequencing wherever possible [and have such efforts underway (Anthony et al. 2017) ], however difficulties in virus isolation or sequencing directly from swabs (where material and viral load can be low, yielding variable results) can often preclude extending sequences much beyond the short fragments amplified by consensus PCR (Drexler et al. 2014 ). Equally, logistic and permitting issues in moving biological samples across borders, and the need to first develop in-country capacity to fully sequence these viruses, have all limited our ability to characterize (most of) these viruses further.",

To achieve this, the USAID PREDICT project first had to establish a strategy for viral discovery in twenty different countries, many of which had no prior capacity to do this work at all. For this reason, we used a simple yet highly implementable approach based on cPCR. Initially, this approach might not appear to be as powerful as high throughput sequencing (HTS) techniques; however, this study has demonstrated the particular and considerable strengths of cPCR as an affordable screening and discovery tool in resource-poor settings, where HTS is still largely unsupported.",

Studies such as this are intended to advance our understanding of the fundamental biology of viruses, not to create alarm or incite the retaliatory culling of bats. Indeed, such actions often have unanticipated consequences; and can even enhance disease transmission, as seen with rabies in vampire bats (Streicker et al. 2012; Blackwood et al. 2013) .
