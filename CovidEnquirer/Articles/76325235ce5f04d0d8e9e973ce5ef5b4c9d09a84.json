The virus was isolated from a severe outbreak of respiratory disease in East Anglia . Haemagglutinin and neuraminidase characterization showed the virus to be very similar to H3N2 strains circulating in the human population during the years 1972-1975, and to H3N2 strains recently isolated from pigs in Belgium and France . A serological survey showed antibodies to the virus to be present in 31% of pigs tested, and reactors were detected on 43% of farms sampled .",

In general it was felt that infection in pigs followed the appearance of infection in the human population (Harkness et al., 1972 ; Tumova, Stumpa & Mensik, 1980) , and with a few exceptions (Ottis et al., 1982) there was no evidence of clinical disease . In 1984 isolations of H3N2 influenza virus were made from pigs in France (Madec et al., 1984) and Belgium (Haesebrouck et al, 1985) showing signs of respiratory tract disease . In the French outbreak, reproductive failures such as abortions and returns to service were also described .",

The pigs were slaughtered 4 weeks after inoculation and no macroscopic lesions were detected . Virus was recovered from nasal swabs from the inoculated pig 1 and 3 days after inoculation, and from the sentinel at 7 days (strain A/Swine/Weybridge/163266/87) . At 14 days after inoculation, the HI antibody titres were 1/80 and 1/40 for the sentinel and inoculated animals respectively ; these had dropped to 1/40 and 1/20 at slaughter 2 weeks later . Serum samples taken before inoculation had shown no HI antibodies at a dilution of 1/10 .",

In the autumn of 1985 and spring 1986 outbreaks of respiratory disease occurred in Yorkshire and Suffolk, which were associated with HIN1 influenza virus infection (Roberts et al., 1987) . An agent serologically identical to transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) of pigs was also found at this time to be associated with respiratory disease (Brown & Cartwright, 1986 . Outbreaks of respiratory disease occurred that could not be attributed to either H1N1 of TGE-like coronavirus infections, and from one of these outbreaks a haemagglutinating agent was isolated . The agent was found to be very similar to H3N2 strains that circulated in the human population from 1972 to 1975, and closely related to viruses isolated from pigs in Belgium and France since 1984 . The clinical pictures in Belgium, France and England were very similar, with pyrexia, anorexia, lethargy, some respiratory distress and some mortality . Recovery by survivors was fairly rapid over a 7-day period .",

The current study showed that pigs had been infected, virus was recovered from the nasal cavity, and antibody response observed . Other factors such as environment and the presence of other pathogens play an important part in any outbreak of respiratory disease . It is interesting that the new TGE-like coronavirus was detected at a similar time to the appearance of an apparently virulent H3N2 influenza virus in both north-western Europe and in England (Brown & Cartwright, 1986 ; Pensaert, Callebaut & Vergote, 1986) .",
