Hardening of targets is best described as measures that are taken to physically protect a facility, such as bolting down equipment, securing power and communications lines, installing backup generators, placing blast walls, or physically locking down and securing a facility. Mitigation through hardening has only limited use in systems or facilities such as hospitals where open access to the surrounding community is the hallmark of their operations. In these circumstances, a resilient system capable of flexing to accommodate damage and the ability to maintain or even expand current operations will make that system ultimately more secure. These efforts are solidly based within the community and their importance is empha- Mitigation through resiliency also has limitations. In many cases, hardening structures is most appropriate, particularly when many citizens may be quickly affected without prior notice or warning. This may include hardening structures in earthquake zones, protecting and monitoring the food chain and drinking water systems, and physically securing and protecting nuclear power plants. In these cases, resiliency may come too late to prevent illness and death in large numbers of patients, and planners should target hardening to whatever degree is practically and financially feasible. 7 The threats of nuclear, radiological, chemical, and biological attacks present new challenges for emergency planners. The potentially covert nature of the attacks, the wide variety of possible agents (including contagious agents), and soft civilian targets make planning efforts exponentially more difficult than in the past. This complexity has also eroded the distinction between mitigation and response activities.",

Mitigation is taking action now-before the next disaster-to reduce human and financial consequences later (analyzing risk, reducing risk, insuring against risk). 10 Risk Reduction works to reduce risk to life and property through land use planning, floodplain management, [and] the adoption of sound building practices . . . Mitigation projects that reduce risk include elevating, relocating, or acquiring properties located in floodplains and returning them to open space, and the reinforcing of buildings in earthquake-prone areas. 10a Mitigation begins with local communities assessing their risks from recurring problems and making a plan for creating solutions to these problems and reducing the vulnerability of their citizens and their property to risk. 11 However, since the mid-1990s, mitigation planning has become increasingly more complex. Terrorist attacks, industrial accidents, and new or reemerging infectious diseases are just a few of the threats that have started to consume more planning time and resources. The growing scope of threats that must be addressed in mitigation strategies challenges all aspects of planning and response at all levels of government. [12] [13] [14] The importance of sharing intelligence information, for example, at the earliest possible stage of a terrorist attack, is recognized in national policy as a critical mitigation asset. Fusion centers have been implemented in jurisdictions across the United States. 15, 16 It is imperative that first responders and hospitals receive notification at the earliest indication of a contagious biological attack. Early notification allows state, regional, and local communities to implement appropriate responses that provide isolation, treatment, prophylaxis, and stockpiling and staging of federal resources, which, when rapidly implemented, could contain a potentially widespread event. This intelligence sharing must become a larger part of mitigation efforts aimed at also limiting the impact of natural and human-made disasters. The elevated status of intelligence within the National Incident Management System (NIMS) establishes the importance of early and effective intelligence sharing. The challenge is to establish these sharing relationships before a disaster by incorporating them into an ongoing hazard monitoring process, drills, exercises, and day-to-day activities to ensure that this critical resource is operational when needed to mitigate the consequences of a disaster. 17 A similar analogy can be made with the early warning given to the medical community when a surveillance system detects an unusual cluster of illnesses, which triggers an investigation leading to increased awareness, training, laboratory recognition, and possible identification of a sentinel case long before the initial diagnosis may be confirmed at a physician's office or health care facility.",

This is especially true in the area of health care; most health care in the United States is provided by the private sector. It is important to note that the National Fire Protection Association (NFPA) recently released NFPA 1600, Standard on Disaster/Emergency Management and Business Continuity Programs, 2013 edition. This standard establishes a common set of criteria and best practices to help local, regional, and national governments, agencies, and organizations plan for disaster management, emergency management, and business continuity. Planners may use these criteria to assess or develop programs or to respond to and recover from a disaster. 21 Although mitigation planning has become an essential feature of nearly every industry and institution in the wake of 9/11, health care settings are disproportionately affected by new challenges and complexities in mitigation. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak shook the foundation of mitigation and prevention in health care when health care workers and first responders in China and Canada died in 2003 after caring for patients infected with the SARS virus. Access to several Toronto area hospitals was significantly limited for several months because of illness, quarantined staff, and concerns about contamination. The economic costs to the city of Toronto were in the billions of dollars. Hospitals and their communities were thrown into a complex mitigation and prevention crisis. Like SARS, the steady spread of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) in Saudi Arabia since 2012 poses similar threats and has disproportionately affected health care workers, who remain most vulnerable to contagious emerging and reemerging infectious diseases.",

            "text": "The Association of State and Territorial Health Officials (ASTHO) released specific guidelines and checklists to help prepare states and communities for a possible outbreak. 22 Pan-influenza planning closely parallels SARS planning, with considerable effort toward preventive vaccination of the population and emphasis on protecting health care workers. 23 Effective strategies were learned during the Toronto SARS outbreak, although it was definitely a \"learn-as-you-go-along\" situation. The most effective mitigation strategies to prepare for the consequences of an outbreak would be to plan for the home quarantine of patients, establish public information strategies to reduce public concern, close affected facilities until conditions permit their safe reopening, plan for a coordinated information and command and control center, and have preestablished protocols and procedures in place to protect the health of health care workers and first responders. 24 Vaccination is an essential component of hospital and community mitigation planning. During the fall of 2002, the U.S. government requested that all states prepare for a smallpox attack. The preparations called for each state to present plans to vaccinate all persons within the state, within a 10-day period, starting with health care workers. 25 Each facility and community needs to look at the risk of a disease, the effect of vaccination on health care workers, and the ability to maintain continuity of care. One outcome of the 2009 H1N1 pandemic was that several organizations, including the Society for Healthcare Epidemiology of America (SHEA), the Association for Professionals in Infection Control and Epidemiology (APIC), and the Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA) recommended that health care workers be mandated to receive yearly influenza vaccinations, which helps to minimize the risk that they will transmit influenza to high-and low-risk patients and bring influenza home to their families. If properly informed and vaccinated, health care workers could respond and treat patients without risk to themselves or their families. The availability of a vaccine and the ability to mass-vaccinate the majority of the population should be considered in all community response plans. The plans for both SARS and pan-influenza now need to address the availability and possible stockpiling of antiviral agents as well as procedures for mass vaccination of the population, if a vaccine were to become available.",

It soon became clear that these \"trees\" were steel vertical beams standing upright in mounds of concrete rubble. In comparison, after the Northridge, California, earthquake in 1994, many of the buildings were structurally compromised but did not collapse upon their occupants. Undoubtedly, this was the result of the strict building codes and enforcement throughout the state of California. For the victims of the Bam earthquake, the most important lifesaving measures might have been the development and enforcement of strict building codes. 29 Building codes are minimum standards that protect people from injury and loss of life from structural collapse; they do not ensure that normal community functioning might continue after a significant event. 30 The structural issues, generator failures, flooding, and sewage problems experienced by hospitals during hurricanes Sandy and Katrina were widely and dramatically displayed by the press across the world. With over half of the 16,000 hospitals in Latin America and the Caribbean in high-risk disaster zones, the Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) has developed extensive guidance for hospital preparedness. 31 Structural protection of facilities requires the active role of qualified and experienced structural engineers during planning, construction, remodeling, and retrofitting. The immediate response of a structural engineer after a disaster is to assess building damage and to assist in determining the need for evacuation and the measures needed to ensure continuity of function. Extensive analysis of seismic data taken during an earthquake and compared with subsequent building damage has given structural engineers valuable information on structural failures of buildings. This information allows communities to rebuild with better and stronger facilities. 32 The following measures to protect the structural integrity of a facility should be in place before an incident 33 :",

Primary damage to nonstructural elements may be the result of overturning, swaying, sliding, falling, deforming, or internal vibration on sensitive instruments. Relatively simple measures that do not require a structural engineer may be taken to prevent damage to or from nonstructural elements. These measures may include fastening loose items and structures, anchoring top-heavy items, tethering large equipment, or using spring mounts.

Communities must also look at the continuity of medical care as a communitywide issue and not just emphasize the hospital or emergency medical services aspects of medical care.

Early recognition of sentinel cases in biological events can significantly affect the outcome, particularly in contagious events. States are funded and required to participate in the surveillance programs mandated in CDC and Health Resources and Services Administration (HRSA) guidelines. 52, 53 The earlier an event is recognized, especially if it involves a contagious disease, the earlier treatment can begin and preventive measures can be taken to prevent the spread of illness to health care workers and responders, as well as the rest of the community. Local and state public health departments are critical to establishing relationships between local providers and their communities. Local, state, and federal public health agencies must ensure that effective surveillance at the community level occurs. These agencies can also assist in awareness-level and personal protection training for hospital staff, emergency medical service employees, and law enforcement first responders.",

The first phase involved the placement of high-performance, transport-capable ventilators within hospitals and emergency medical services across the state. The decision to place the ventilators with end users accomplished the goals of having the ventilators in the field where they would be readily available and maintained and could be utilized in day-to-day emergent interfacility and intrafacility transports. The supplemental oxygen component of the program provides low-flow oxygen within the community-based alternate care facilities that are supported by state legislation during mass casualty events and public health emergencies. Critical to this effort was state support and legislation as well as the effective use of sub-state public health regions to support planning and command and control response activities. Within the regions, coalitions supporting this effort included a core group of critical partners providing medical control and subject matter expertise and multiple supportive agencies and NGOs. Space included public schools, college facilities, community centers, and NGO facilities. Staff comprised community volunteer groups, the state Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS) team, hospitals, private practices, and other practitioners. Supplies included a combination of state-purchased equipment and supplies, with an emphasis on high-priority coordination with state and local vendors for oxygen equipment and supplies. Sustainability, the effective utilization of regionally based and local resources, appears to be an effective strategy for this important capability after a series of HSEEP-certified workshops and exercises across the thirteen regions of the state. 54 ",

            "text": "Motivating health care facilities to take part in mitigation is one of the largest challenges in disaster medicine. It is always best to take measures beforehand to minimize property damage and prevent injury and death. In the case of hospitals, some preliminary research indicates that four factors affect an institution's motivation to mitigate: influence of legislation and regulation, economic considerations, the role of \"champions\" within the institution, and the impact of disasters and imminent threats on agenda-setting and policy making. It was discovered during this research that \"mitigation measures were found to be most common when proactive mitigation measures were mandated by regulatory agencies and legislation.\" 55 Tax incentives, government assistance grants, and building code and insurance requirements may also serve to motivate administrators and decision makers to put the necessary time and effort into mitigation planning. 30 The Hospital Preparedness Program (HPP), designed to provide leadership and funding through grants to and cooperative agreements with states, territories, and eligible municipalities to improve surge capacity and enhance community and hospital preparedness for public health emergencies, 52 has undergone significant cuts over the past few years that threaten to undo progress made in the last decade. HPP appropriations have decreased from $426 million in FY2010 to $255 million in FY2014, including a one-third cut in the FY2014 omnibus. 56 HPP provides financial incentives to ensure that hospitals are able to coordinate, cooperate, and reduce loss of life during an emergency. The program allowed the coalition in Boston to practice two 24-hour disaster simulations involving several area hospitals before the 2013 Boston Marathon Bombing. The planning and efficiency of the hospitals after the attack were major factors in saving the lives of the 264 individuals injured in the bombings, and there were no additional deaths after the three on-site fatalities. 57 The loss of an estimated 46,000 state and local public health jobs since 2008 58 also has the potential to damage the progress made in all-hazards preparedness since 9/11. With little prospect of increased national funding in the immediate future, it is necessary for local communities to develop sustainability strategies to ensure every dollar is well spent in helping their communities prepare for disasters. 59 The CDC Capability 10: Medical Surge publication encourages the widespread collaboration and allocation of resources in community-wide surge capacity efforts and has been helpful in focusing these efforts in a realistic and operational manner. 60 ",
