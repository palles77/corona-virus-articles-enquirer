Since virus particles, which are infectious and toxigenic [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] , are only nanometers in size, they can remain suspended in the air long enough to be dispersed [9] . Since airborne infection is caused by these infectious aerosol particles, and the average person spends most of his/her time indoors [10] , development of efficient air control technology is important for maintaining a clean indoor air environment and for preventing infection and spread of respiratory infectious diseases.",

In our previous study, aerosolized bacteriophage MS2 virus was inactivated with synthesized SiO 2 -Ag nanoparticles, which were 400 nm silica particles decorated with 30 nm silver nanoparticles [15] . These particles were coated onto filter media using a conventional flow process, and the anti-viral ability of the fabricated filter was tested in the continuous airflow condition. However, in that study, all of the experiments were performed in clean air without consideration of dust particles. According to a report from the American Society of Heating, Refrigerating, and Air-conditioning Engineers (ASHRAE), dust particles can affect the growth of microorganisms captured on an antimicrobial-treated air filter [16] . Moreover, dust particles captured on the filter media can decrease the anti-microbial ability of a silver nanoparticle-coated air filter and increase the pressure drop across filter media [17] .",

The best filter is the one that demonstrates the highest filtration efficiency with the smallest pressure drop. However, increasing filtration efficiency inevitably results in increased pressure drop. Thus, the quality factor, which is the ratio of particle penetration to pressure drop, is widely used to compare the performances of various air filters. In this study, two different filter quality factors, filtration quality factor (q filt ) and anti-viral quality factor (q antiviral,15 ), were calculated using the following equations:",
