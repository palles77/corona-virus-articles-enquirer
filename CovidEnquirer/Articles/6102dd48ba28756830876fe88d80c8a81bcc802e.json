Although the Chinese Government has already carried out a series of emergency education and training programmes to improve public health staff's capability of emergency preparedness, it remains unclear if these training programmes are effective and feasible. The purpose of this research was to evaluate an emergency preparedness training programme and to develop a participatory training approach for emergency response. Methods: Seventy-six public health staff completed the emergency preparedness training programme. The effectiveness of the training was evaluated by questionnaire before training, immediately after training and 12 months after training (follow-up). Additionally, semi-structured interviews were conducted throughout the training period. Results: The emergency preparedness training improved the knowledge levels and increased attitudinal and behavioural intention scores for emergency preparedness (Po0.01). The results at follow-up showed that the knowledge levels and attitudinal/behavioural intention scores of participants decreased slightly (P40.05) compared with levels immediately after training (Po0.01). However, there was a significant increase compared with before training (Po0.01). Moreover, more than 80% of participants reported that the training process and resources were scientific and feasible. ",

Managing these emergencies and the threats they pose is part of the longterm government development plans in many countries, and expensive resources are being invested into preventing and responding to public health emergencies. 1 In China, surge capacity is one of the most urgent problems regarding public health emergency response at the present time, 2 along with the lack of equipment and the low efficiency of the public health emergency information system. Recognizing this, the Chinese Government carried out a series of emergency preparedness education and training programmes to improve the capability of public health staff to respond to emergencies nationwide. However, it remains unclear if these training programmes are feasible and effective in improving emergency preparedness.",

A number of studies have shown that the training methods recommended by the present study educators were effective because different participants learn by different training methods, and methods of active training are especially helpful for adult learning. [19] [20] [21] Formal lecturing was the least used training method because trainees do not participate actively in the learning process and the outcome is inferior to methods of active learning. The results of the evaluation suggested that up-todate training of public health staff should focus on the development of effective training methods, and interactive training methods may help to increase the quality of training and improve retention of knowledge through immediate reinforcement of learning. 22, 23 Furthermore, comprehensive evaluation and feedback about the training programme were of vital importance for the participants and trainers as it helped participants to identify their limitations while monitoring their performance during the training period. Also, trainers tended to improve their performance as they were aware that it was being monitored and evaluated. Feedback of the results of evaluation of the training sessions to the trainers was found to be helpful in rectifying the weaknesses of sessions. 24 In addition, the mean scores of emergency analytical/assessment skills increased rather than decreased by 12-month follow-up. This is similar to results found by Qureshi et al. 14 For this type of phenomenon, one must consider the experience of the public health staff at the end of 2005. Before the follow-up survey, the majority of trainees had participated in avian influenza emergency response activities, thus providing practice and increasing perceived relevance of the training. As such, this probably had a positive effect on the effectiveness of training. Nevertheless, the increased overall knowledge score and the positive change in attitudinal and behavioural parameters suggested that training programmes on emergency preparedness resulted in gaining knowledge and shifts in attitude and behaviour.
