At each market, samples were collected from up to 27 poultry-related sites to assess the extent of contamination. Samples were tested by using real-time reverse transcription-PCR and virus isolation. A questionnaire was used to ascertain types of birds in the market, general infrastructure, and work practices. Thirty-nine (47%) markets showed contamination with avian infl uenza virus in >1 of the sites sampled. Risk factors were slaughtering birds in the market and being located in West Java province. Protective factors included daily removal of waste and zoning that segregated poultry-related work fl ow areas. These results can aid in the design of evidence-based programs concerning environmental sanitation, food safety, and surveillance to reduce the risk for avian infl uenza virus A (H5N1) transmission in live-bird markets.",

However, LBMs provide op-timal conditions for the zoonotic transfer and evolution of infectious disease pathogens because they provide major contact points between humans and live animals (3, 4) .",

            "text": "Studies in Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, People's Republic of China; other areas of China; Indonesia; and the United States have shown that LBMs can harbor avian infl uenza viruses (AIVs), including highly pathogenic infl uenza virus A (H5N1), and have been associated with human infection (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . Continual movement of birds into, through, and out of markets provides opportunity for the introduction, entrenchment, and dissemination of AIVs. Most studies have focused on testing live birds rather than environmental sites in the LBMs (6, 7, 10) . However, a study in New York, NY, that tested environmental sites for AIV (H7N2) found that virus could be isolated from samples from fl oors, walls, and drains from the poultry areas of LBMs (8) . The study also found that despite the ongoing infl ux of infected birds into LBMs, the level of environmental contamination decreased with routine cleaning and disinfection. Another study in Hong Kong LBMs showed that AIV (H9N2) could be isolated at higher rates from poultry drinking water than from samples of bird fecal droppings (11) . Environmental aspects of LBMs are needed for an avian infl uenza control program for 2 reasons. First, a contaminated environment can provide a continuing source of virus transmission, in which healthy birds coming into the market may become infected and persons working in or visiting the market may also be exposed. Second, ongoing surveillance programs in LBMs based on environmental sampling are more likely than those based on invasive bird testing to be acceptable to traders and stall vendors. Environmental sampling is also safer for public health offi cers and veterinary health offi cers than handling and sampling live birds that may be infected with AIV.",

Eighteen districts in these provinces were selected on the basis of their proximity to the laboratory, high levels of avian infl uenza activity in farmed birds (Ministry of Agriculture, unpub. data), and high number of LBMs available for study (n = 300). The required sample size was 73 markets based on an estimated disease prevalence of 50% and a maximum error of 10% at 95% confi dence. We based our assumption that 50% of LBMs would be contaminated with AIV (H5N1) on results from a previous study in US LBMs in 2001 (12) . This study found that 60% of markets tested positive for AIV (H7N2) virus in areas in which the virus was endemic. To account for nonresponse, we increased the total sample size to 83 LBMs. We selected markets for inclusion in the study using systematic sampling. On the basis of a sampling frame of 300 markets, every fourth market (the sampling interval) was selected from a list of all the markets. A random numbers table was used to determine the starting point for selection of the 83 markets from the list. Diagnostic specimens and data were collected during October 2007-March 2008. These months have high rainfall and high AIV transmission according to data gathered during 2005-2007 about AIV (H5N1) outbreaks in farmed birds (Ministry of Agriculture, unpub. data).",

Virus isolation detects viable virus, whereas real-time RT-PCR detects small stretches of nucleic acid, even if the larger genomic RNA is inactivated. This makes real-time RT-PCR a more sensitive detection tool but does not provide information about virus viability. Samples obtained from the environment may be less suitable than animal samples for virus isolation techniques. Organic matter, duration and temperature of exposure, and humidity can all affect virus survival outside the animal host (22) . Three studies conducted in LBMs tested environmental samples and bird samples by using virus isolation (8, 10, 23) . Only 1 of these studies stratifi ed the avian infl uenza detection rates by type of sample (bird vs. environment) (8) ; that study found that from 12 LBMs, 11 were positive for avian infl uenza in bird samples compared with only 5 positive in environmental samples. These results were based on a small sample of LBMs, and real-time RT-PCR was not conducted. Therefore, to determine the suitability of virus isolation for environmental samples, we recommend that future studies compare real-time RT-PCR-positive rates to virus isolation rates in both environmental swab and bird samples.",

Environmental sampling reduces the potential for virus aerosolization and the risk for infection for persons collecting the samples or standing nearby.

These activities may have been overreported because respondents may have wanted to report what they perceived interviewers wanted to hear. Be-cause of the high cost associated with the fi eld and laboratory work for such studies, studies should focus on a small number of markets and collect in-depth information about contamination trends and associated risk factors, as well as data on other indicator organisms, such as Escherichia coli or Enterobacteriaceae, that provide information about general market hygiene.
