The LoD was 328 determined when the concentration of reads mapped to COVID-19 was significantly higher than 329 that for the negative control in 3/4 replicates. 330 331 NTS detection method. The targeted genes were amplified using the SARS-CoV-2 or 10 332 respiratory virus primer panel in a 20 \u03bcL reaction system with 5 \u03bcL total nucleic acid, 5 \u03bcL primer 333 All rights reserved.

For these samples, the 10 160 min and 4 h results were comparable, indicating that NTS could rapidly detect many positive 161 samples. 162However, as the tested 45 samples were from early outpatients without detailed records, suitable 163 clinical data, such as chest computed tomographic scans, were not available to support the results. 164 Therefore, we next evaluated samples retained from hospitalized patients with confirmed COVID-165 19 subjected to qPCR testing (kit 1,Fig. 1) on February 11 and 12, 2020.

For qPCR-inconclusive samples, NTS yielded few, scattered 176 positive target fragments, suggesting that low sample nucleic acid quality or abundance rendered it 177 difficult to draw clear conclusions by qPCR based on evaluation of only two sites. Moreover, 178 contamination of individual viral fragments did not affect NTS results. For example, although the 179 negative control of the first chip in Fig. 4 appears to have been contaminated with a fragment 180 containing the N gene, we could exclude the contamination using a high threshold, and/or base the 181 final conclusions on the 11 remaining sites. However, negative control contamination in qPCR 182 would invalidate the results of the whole experimental batch. 183 184 SARS-CoV-2 mutation analysis. Mutation screening of 19 samples from outpatients indicated as 185 infection-positive by both NTS and qPCR identified single nucleotide mutations at seven sites in 186 four samples (Table 1), three of which (S_519 of C1, N_822 of C2, and S_2472 of E3) harbored 187 silent mutations. One variant (ORF8_251: T\u2192C), encoding an AA change from Leu to Ser, was 188 identified in the three samples. The ORF8_184 mutation in sample E3 also reflected a Val to Leu 189 missense mutation. Comparison with the 67 complete SARS-CoV-2 genomes reported in the 190 GISAID database prior to February 8, 2020 revealed that ORF8_251 contained C in 20, T in 48, and 191 Y in 1 genome, indicating its diversity in different strains. Additionally, single genomes contained 192 C or S at ORF8_184 whereas the remaining 67 had G, indicating that despite some inter-strain 193 diversity, G\u2192C transversion was rare. The remaining silent variants were not identified in the 194 GISAID database, suggesting that the virus may harbor mutations as yet uncharacterized by existing 195 genome-wide sequencing methods. 196 All rights reserved.

Five replications of the plasmid containing the SARS-CoV-2 S and N genes 227 served as the positive control and Tris-EDTA (TE) buffer was used as the negative control (in 228 duplicate). For each sample, cDNA samples were separately amplified using the respiratory virus 229 and the SARS-CoV-2 primer panels, then all amplified fragments were pooled. After the addition of 230 barcodes, amplified fragments from all 20 samples (13 cases, 7 controls) were subjected nanopore 231 sequencing on one chip.
