The major viral RNA-binding protein in virions and infected cells was the phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein N (50K). A new 140K virus structural protein was identified as a minor RNA-binding protein both in virions and in infected cells. The 140K protein was antigenically related to N, and upon reduction, yielded only 50K N. Thus, the 140K protein is probably a trimer of N subunits linked by intermolecular disulfide bonds. Several cellular RNA-binding proteins were also detected. RNA-binding of N was not nucleotide sequence specific. Single-stranded RNA of MHV, VSV, or cellular origin, a DNA probe of the MHV leader sequence, and double-stranded bovine rotavirus RNA could all bind to N. Binding of MHV RNA was optimal between pH 7 and 8, and the RNA could be eluted in 0.1 M NaCl. The ROPBA is a useful method for the initial identification of RNA-binding proteins, such as N and the 140K protein of murine coronavirus.",

We have adapted the RNA overlay-protein blot assay (ROPBA) to detect the virus-specific RNA-binding proteins in coronavirus infected cells and virions. We found that in virions, N was the major RNA-binding protein, but a minor protein of mol wt 140K, not previously reported, also bound RNA. The 140K protein appears to be a multimer of N molecules linked by disulfide bonds. virus (VSV) were propagated and plaque assayed in the 1'7 Clone 1 (1'7 Cl 1) line of spontaneously transformed BALB/c 3T3 cells as described previously (Sturman et a& 1980) . Released MHV-A59 was purified by ultracentrifugation on discontinuous and continuous sucrose gradients (Sturman et al, 1980) . Vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV, San Juan strain) was propagated in the same cells. Bovine rotavirus (BRV, Lincoln strain), kindly provided by Dr. (0.05%) DEPC) as described by Maniatis et al. (1982) , but omitting RNAsin. The precipitated RNA was pelleted at 16,300 g for 15 min, air-and vacuum-dried, and resuspended in doubledistilled water. RNA was stored in aliquots at -70\u00b0, and its concentration and purity were determined by spectrophotometric analysis at 260 and 280 nm. Specific activities ranged from about 4 X lo3 to 4 X lo4 cpm/pg. RNA samples were analyzed by electrophoresis for approximately 22 hr in 1% Seakem LE agarose (FMC Corp.) horizontal slab gels (Zeevi et aL, 1981) , using 6 M formaldehyde in both gel and sample buffers and 0.1% DEPC in the running buffer. Nick-translated, denatured [32P]dCTP-labeled X phage DNA digested with Hind111 (Bethesda Research Laboratories) was used as a molecular weight standard. Intracellular virus-specific RNA was prepared similarly from VSV-infected cells harvested at 8.5 hr p.i. and BRV-infected cells at 8-9 hr p.i.",

It comprised approximately 3.4% of the total virion protein as estimated by densitometric scans of an immunoblot (lane A) and a Coomassie bluestained gel. Preliminary studies suggest that the 140K protein bound RNA as effectively as did the N protein on a weightby-weight basis. There was no detectable binding of RNA by either form of the E2 glycoprotein, which forms the viral spikes. Glycosylated and unglycosylated forms of El, the membrane glycoprotein, bound only trace amounts of RNA. 32P-labeled RNA from VW-infected cells also bound to the N and 140K proteins of MHV with high efficiency (Fig. 2, lane C) , indicating that the observed RNA-binding was not nucleotide sequence specific.",

Probes were equalized with respect to counts per minute per milliliter. In 15-hr MHV-A59 infected cell extracts, similar bands of RNA-binding proteins were detected using as probes MHV-A59 RNA, cellular RNA, MHV leader cDNA, and ds BRV RNA. N bound all of the probes tested. Longer exposure of Fig. 7C yielded the same pattern of viral and cellular RNA-binding proteins seen with the other probes. N also bound 32P-5'-end labeled HSV-1 and calf thymus DNAs (not shown). These results showed that, in the ROPBA, N protein bound nucleic acids in a manner which was not specific for nucleotide sequence. DISCUSSION We have identified RNA-binding proteins of a coronavirus using a sensitive and direct method, the RNA overlay-protein blot assay (Bowen et a& 1980) . In MHV virions, the N protein was found to be the major viral RNA-binding protein (Fig. 2) , as expected since the helical viral nucleocapsid is composed of N protein and genomic RNA (Sturman et aL, 1980) . In purified MHV-A59 virions we detected a new 140K mol wt RNA-binding protein which is apparently a trimer of N protein held together by intermolecular disulfide bonds. The 140K protein was not detected previously because reduction of SDS-PAGE samples dissociated its intermolecular disulfide bonds (Fig. 4) . Formation of intermolecular disulfide bonds does not prevent the N subunits of 140K from binding to RNA.",

Alternatively, lack of nucleotide sequence specificity in N binding may reflect a property intrinsic to proteins which form helical nucleocapsids encasing the entire genome. During assembly of some viruses with helical nucleocapsids, such as VSV (Blumberg et aL, 1983) and TMV (Butler, 1984) , a specific nucleation site on the viral RNA is required to bind the first protein molecules, but binding of subsequent protein monomers to the remainder of the genomic RNA is not nucleotide sequence specific.
