In the current study, we used DNA immunization as a tool to study the relative protective immunity of these proteins with a standardized intranasal challenge system in mice. While the natural full-length gene sequences for most of these Y. pestis proteins did not display a good level of protein expression in vitro when delivered by a DNA vaccine vector, the overall immunogenicity of these wild type gene DNA vaccines was low in eliciting antigen-specific antibody responses and gene sequence modifications improved both of these parameters. However, even modified YopD, YopO and YscF antigens were only able to partially protect immunized mice at various levels against lethal challenge with Y. pestis KIM 1001 strain while no protection was observed with either the YopB or Pla antigens. These results demonstrate that DNA immunization is effective in screening, optimizing and comparing optimal antigen designs and immunogenicity of candidate antigens for the development of a subunit-based plague vaccine.",

The causative agent of plague, Yersinia pestis (Y. pestis), is also a concern for its potential use as an agent of biological warfare and biological terrorism. Although killed whole-cell vaccines are available for human use in certain countries, poor efficacy has limited their use for prevention of natural or human-inflicted outbreaks [1] [2] [3] . Up to this point, the effort to develop next generation plague vaccines has focused mainly on the use of two well-studied protective antigens, F1 and V (LcrV), in the form of subunit-based recombinant protein vaccines [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . However, as shown in a recent study conducted in humans with subunit-based plague vaccines, the immunogenicity of the current vaccine composition is quite weak [9] . Therefore, the importance of identifying additional protective antigens is clear, especially for the highly virulent pneumonic plague.",

Therefore, it was hypothesized that these proteins may serve as protective antigens. Along with F1 and LcrV, Yops and the plasminogen activator protease (Pla) are necessary for the full virulence of Y. pestis [12, 13] and are encoded by the virulence plasmids [13] [14] [15] . Among the 12 secreted Yops, YopB and YopD are known as translocators in the Ysc-Yop type III secretion system involved in the translocation of the Yop effectors across the eukaryotic cell plasma membrane into the target cells [16, 17] . The type III secretion apparatus of Y. pestis is a conserved mechanism to deliver virulent factors into mammalian host cells [15, 18] . Both YopB and YopD are transmembrane proteins and interact with LcrV to form the pore of the Type III secretion apparatus through which the Yop effectors are translocated [13, 19, 20] . YopO/YpkA is a 81.7 kDa protein kinase with the ability to catalyze autophosphorylation on a serine residue, as shown by in vitro experiments, and is targeted to the inner surface of the plasma membrane inside the cells [21] .",

The LD50 for a Pla-negative mutant strain was close to 10 7 bacteria, as compared to less than 50 bacteria for the isogenic Pla-positive strain [12] .

DNA immunization was also used to effectively identify individual protective antigens in order to formulate subunit-based vaccines against smallpox infection [31] . In a previous study from our laboratory, we successfully established a mouse intranasal challenge model coupled with DNA immunization technology to test the protection efficacy of modified Y. pestis antigens against lethal plague challenge [32] .

Our previous studies, which used DNA vaccines against plague and other infectious agents, have demonstrated that a proper leader sequence is important in eliciting a high level of antibody responses and protective immunity [30, 32, 33] . Since yopB, yopD and yopO genes do not encode typical signal peptides, the tPA leader sequence was engineered with each of these yop genes individually to produce modified yop gene inserts for DNA immunization. In addition, certain intragene hydrophobic regions were removed to further improve the immunogenicity of Yop antigens. Our results demonstrate that antigen engineering was effective in improving the immunogenicity of the above Yop, Pla and YscF antigens and that these modified antigens in general induced higher antibody responses than the wild-type gene inserts. In addition, modified YopD, YopO and YscF proteins improved the level of protection. Overall, the protection efficacies with these Y. pestis proteins were still low and incomplete when compared to the known protective antigen LcrV, indicating that a search for additional protective antigens against Y. pestis is needed.",

Overall, YopB, YopD, YopO, Pla and YscF DNA vaccines were not very immunogenic when the wild type gene sequences were delivered by DNA immunization. Production of these antigens in the mammalian expression system is limited by the lack of proper leader sequences and/or by the presence of hydrophobic segments in the middle of their coding sequences. Antigen engineering approaches, such as the use of tPA leader sequences and the removal of intra-polypeptide hydrophobic regions, were effective in improving the expression of coded Yop antigen, resulting in higher levels of antigen expression, with some in secreted form of antigenic proteins.",

The current study attempts to link antigen expression, immunogenicity of specific antibody induction and final protection of animals immunized against plague in a mucosal challenge model. Our results demonstrate that antigen engineering is effective in improving antigen expression, immunogenicity and final protection against the Yop proteins that were included in this study. The quality of protection induced by modified YopD or YopO antigens was better than that previously reported as these antigens provided better survival than their wild type antigens against mucosal challenge with a highly virulent Y. pestis KIM 1001 strain.

The polymerized YscF has been shown to form a needle structure (referred to as an 'injectosome') on the type III secretion system [20, 38] . At least six Yop effectors: YopH, YopE, YopM, YpkA, YopK, and YopJ, are delivered by YscF injectosome into target eukaryotic cells. Based on the fact that YscF is a surface-expressed protein and is required for virulence in Y. pestis, it was assumed that YscF might be a candidate as a protective antigen. Recent studies have showed that immunization with a purified YscF protein could induce limited protective immunity against experimental plague infection [22, 23] . However, more conventional YscF DNA vaccines with the wild type gene insert and even with the addition of a tPA leader sequence could not induce detectable antibody responses or protective immunity against lethal Y. pestis challenge. Interestingly, the YscF-2 DNA vaccine, constructed to produce a YscF dimer protein, induced YscF-specific antibody responses and a significant level of protection (60%). It is known that the natural polymerization of YscF protein forms the injectosome of the type III secretion system [20] . The dimeric designed YscF-2 DNA vaccine might produce antibody responses against the polymerized YscF conformation, which may be critical for the induction of protective immunity by the YscF-DNA vaccine, in addition to overall improved YscF protein expression and immunogenicity. In the current study, we did not test the design with both tPA leader and dimeric YscF-2 components because putting two changes together will be hard to see whether they may interfere with each other. But future studies can include such design to further optimize the immunogenicity of YscF antigen. Results from this current report suggest that antigen conformation is critical for any candidate protective antigen, including those against Y. pestis. These results also provide important information to aid in the design of other forms of subunit-based vaccines, including recombinant protein vaccines.",

Although the modified YopB DNA vaccine induced a high level of antibody responses, it did not protect the mice against intranasal Y. pestis challenge. Furthermore, the Pla DNA vaccine induced only low levels of antibody responses and also did not provide any protection against lethal Y. pestis challenge. Given the need to identify new protective antigens for improved plague vaccines, the antigen optimization strategy and testing system reported here offers an efficient and reproducible platform to screen for new protective Y. pestis antigens. The use of DNA immunization to modify and optimize the immunogenicity of candidate Y. pestis antigens can be used to accelerate such an effort. In addition, optimized DNA vaccines expressing Y. pestis antigens can also be used as part of a DNA prime-protein boost regimen that may be more immunogenic than the protein alone approach in eliciting high quality protective antibody responses as shown in HIV vaccine studies [39] .",
