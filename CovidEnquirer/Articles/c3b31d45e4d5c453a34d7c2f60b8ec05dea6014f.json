Ten conventionally reared pigs showing acute clinical signs of PMWS were selected from a farm on which animal were seronegative to porcine reproductive and respiratory virus and to Aujeszky's disease virus. All pigs were positive in tests for porcine circovirus type 2 by ISH and IHC. Monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies to CD3, CD79a, CD45RA (3C3/9), lysozyme, SLA-II-DQ (BL2H5), and MAC387 were used to characterise cells in PMWS lesions. The most relevant changes were reduction or loss of B and T lymphocytes, increased numbers of macrophages, and partial loss and redistribution of antigen presenting cells throughout lymphoid tissues compared to uninfected controls. The characteristics of lymphoid lesions in the present study strongly suggest an immunosuppressive effect of PMWS in affected pigs. #",

Typical microscopic lymphoid damage in PMWS affected tissues (Segal\u00e9s et al., 1997; Rosell et al., 1999) , and the association of the disease with opportunistic pathogens commonly associated with immunosuppression (Clark, 1997; Carrasco et al., 2000) , Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 94 (2003) [63] [64] [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] [72] [73] [74] [75] help to support this hypothesis. Furthermore, some studies demonstrated that the over stimulation of infected pig's immune system, or routine vaccination could potentiate PCV2 infection and subsequent development of wasting disease Krakowka et al., 2001) . Flow cytometry and immunohistochemical (IHC) studies have been performed to determine the changes on leukocyte populations of conventional pigs affected with PMWS (Shibahara et al., 2000; Segal\u00e9s et al., 2001; Darwich et al., 2002; Sarli et al., 2001) . The most relevant findings reported in these studies were decrease of circulating B cells (Darwich et al., 2002) and loss of lymphocytes in B-cell areas (Shibahara et al., 2000) . Moreover, a decrease in CD4 \u00fe and/or CD8 \u00fe T lymphocytes has also been described (Sarli et al., 2001; Segal\u00e9s et al., 2001; Darwich et al., 2002) .",

Hepatic and renal lesions associated with PCV2, as described in other reports (Rosell et al., 2000a,b) , were only sporadically observed in our study; the selection methods and the larger number of pigs used by these authors might explain this discrepancy. Concurrent ISH for PCV nucleic acid (without differentiation between PCV1 and PCV2) and IHC for several cell markers confirmed macrophages to be the predominant virus containing cells in PMWS affected pigs (Kiupel et al., 1999) . In our study, the application of a larger panel of cell markers, and the use of a PCV2-specific probe for ISH (Rosell et al., 2000a) demonstrated that APCs in general, and not only macrophages, are target cells for PCV2 infection. On the other hand, we found that lymphocytes are only sporadically infected, similarly to other authors' results (Kiupel et al., 1999) . The relation between severity of lesions in secondary lymphoid tissues and presence of PCV2 nucleic acid has been already documented (Darwich et al., 2002) . In the present study, thymus, a primary lymphoid organ, was also investigated. In this organ, PCV2 nucleic acid or antigen was detected only in a few histiocytic cells of the medulla, suggesting that thymocytes and T cells might be more resistant to PCV2 infection.",

Death from apoptosis is a fundamental process in regulating T-and B-cell populations and also in regulating cell viral infection (Alcami and Koszinowski, 2000; Kra-mer, 2000) . Therefore, apoptosis might be a significant mechanism of lymphocyte depletion observed in PMWS. If and how PCV2 might play a role in apoptosis up-regulation is still unknown.",

In our study heavy infiltrations of lysozymepositive macrophages were observed in stages II and III, with a similar pattern of distribution to PCV2 infected cells. Recent studies on viral immune evasion mechanisms explain how DNA viruses are able to acquire immune response genes of the host, which blocks or subvert the host anti-virus immune and inflammatory responses (Alcami and Koszinowski, 2000; Haig, 2001) . PCV2 may inhibit one of several host anti-virus responses, such as apoptosis, chemokine production, or interferon production allowing macrophages to survive longer. Further in vivo and in vitro studies are still needed to better explain the pathogenesis of lymphocyte depletion, and macrophage infiltration characterising PMWS.",

BL2H5 antibody cytoplasm labelling the of these cells is not a surprising finding since MHC II is firstly assembled to the antigen in the endoplasmic reticulum before transportation to the cell surface (Calafat et al., 1994) . BL2H5 antibody demonstrated that APCs and PCV2 infected cells have a very similar pattern of distribution, reinforcing the observation that all types of APCs could be PCV2 infection target cells (Rosell et al., 1999) , not just macrophages as previously suggested (Kiupel et al., 1999) . In stages I and II, APCs number, but not their distribution, was very similar to control cases, whereas in stage III a smaller number of these cells were observed. This finding can be explained by the replacement of B cells by infiltrating macrophages, since B-lymphocytes are also APCs. In our study, only the most severely affected pigs showed a decreased number of APCs; however, because these animals were killed it is impossible to predict what changes would have occurred if they had survived longer. It may well be that the most significant APCs loss occurs in the terminal stage of disease.",

Further characterisations of lymphoid lesions of this study support the hypothesis that PMWS affected pig are immunosuppressed (Sarli et al., 2001; Segal\u00e9s et al., 2001; Darwich et al., 2002) . Pathological stages I, II, and III defined in this work might be comparable to three distinct clinical stages of the disease (initial, intermediate and final), but some of these differences can be related to variation in immunological responses of individual pigs to PCV2 infection.
