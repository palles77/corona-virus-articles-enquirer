The combination of amino acids and bulky hydroxycarboxylic acids represents a formidable challenge for a solid-phase synthesis, which is on the other hand a prerequisite for the preparation of larger compound collections needed for biological screening. The stepwise assembly of such compounds is expected to be particularly difficult when N-methyl amino acids are involved. 8 Due to the increased steric hindrance couplings need more time with the consequence that dioxomorpholine formation and epimerization can become the predominant side-reactions. 9e11 The difficulties, resulting from the stepwise assemblage of N-methyl amino acids have been impressively demonstrated in several cyclosporine syntheses. 12, 13 Although advanced reagents, such as BMTB and DFET have been developed and applied for the coupling of sterically hindered N-methyl amino acids, high-yielding ester bond assemblage on solid support remains a synthetic problem. 14, 15 Besides standard reagents, such as DIC/DMAP alsotriphosgene and hexafluoroacetonides of a-hydroxycarboxylic acids have been employed for the construction of depsipeptides. 16e18",

The basic conditions needed for the removal of the Fmoc-group may cause a partial ester cleavage, diketopiperazine formation and enhanced racemization of the chiral hydroxy acids. On the other hand, Fmoc-protecting schemes are well established for standard supports, such as the Wang-resin and can be easily adapted on a peptide synthesizer. Diketopiperazine formation is drastically reduced or even suppressed under the strong acidic cleavage conditions used for the cleavage of Boc protecting groups. However, activated ester bonds as those from PhLac for instance, may be affected, too.

Without HOBt the reactivity of the reagent system was distinctly reduced and even after three couplings the yield was only 62%.

Thus, in addition to DIC, further procedures frequently used for the formation of difficult ester bonds, such as the highly reactive Fmoc-NMe-Leu acid chloride, the Yamaguchi dichlorobenzoate active ester (entry 4d, Table 1 ) and the Mitsunobo (entry 4e, Table 1 ) coupling with (S)-lactic acid were studied. 37 Step ( and the Yamaguchi method afforded insufficient yields while the Mitsunobo reaction gave somewhat higher yields. However, the DIC/DMAP/HOBt reagent system remained superior also for this coupling step. Standard conditions were used for the removal of the Fmocprotecting group (THF, 25% piperidine, 30 min). The THPprotecting groups were removed quantitatively with diluted p-TsOH (5 mg/mL in DCM/MeOH 97:3, 2\u00c21 h) according to the procedure published by Kuisle. 23 Due to the symmetry of PF1022A the remaining four chain-elongation reactions are simple repeats of the first couplings. Thus, no more optimizations were conducted. The yield of the linear octadepsipeptide 25 after removal of the N-terminal Fmoc-group and cleavage from the resin (50% TFA in DCM, 1.5 h, quantitative) was 16%, which corresponds to an average yield of 89% for each of the sixteen steps on solid support (Scheme 2).",

Furthermore, PF1022A can be easily separated from noncyclized by-products by flash-chromatography with silica gel due to its considerably higher lipophilicity. The unusual high macrocyclization yield can be attributed to a cis-amide bond between a leucine and lactic acid, which brings the N-and C-terminus in close proximity and thus facilitates the cylization reaction. 39 PF1022A (1) obtained by synthesis was completely identical with respect to biological and spectroscopical data with a natural reference sample.",

IR-spectra were measured on a Nicolet PROT EG E 460 Spectrometer E.S.P. HPLC-MS was performed on a Varian 500 Ion-Trap LC-ESI-MS system or on a Bruker MicroTOF (column: 5 mm RP18) with ACN/H 2 O gradient 10/90 to 95/5. Highresolution MS were measured on a Bruker MicroTOF. Preparative low pressure chromatography (LPLC) was performed using silica gel 60 mm (230e400 mesh, MachereyeNagel), B\u20ac uchi pump. TLC: Silica gel 60 F 254 (Merck). Melting points (mp) were determined with a Buechi 535 melting point apparatus and are uncorrected. The progress of the solid phase reactions was detected either by the bromophenolblue color test, determination of resin loading by UV determination of the Fmoc-group cleavage product or by test cleavages and HPLC-MS analysis.",
