        "title": "Methods: Mice were infected by intranasal inoculation with influenza A viruses (strains: H 1 N 1 and H 3 N 2 ) or PBS. Animals were exposed to aerosols of ovalbumin on day 3. Two weeks after ovalbumin sensitization, mice were challenged with oval- bumin aerosols; 24 hours later, airway responsiveness (AR) to inhaled methacholine, levels of ovalbumin-specific IgE, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) were examined. Results: Neither influenza A virus (H 1 N 1 nor H 3 N 2 ) alone nor ovalbumin sensitization alone caused changes in AR or IgE. However, ovalbumin sensitization after inoculation with either influenza A virus increased AR and levels of ovalbumin-specif- ic IgE. On BALF-cell analysis, ovalbumin sensitization after inoculation with influenza virus A increased the number of lymphocytes but not the number of eosinophils. No difference in AR or IgE levels was observed between the 2 strains of influenza A viruses. Immmunostaining of BALF cells showed an increase in T cells, especially CD8 + cells, with ovalbumin sensitization after inoculation with influenza virus A. Conclusion: Infection by influenza A virus enhances sensitiza- tion to inhaled antigens and airway responsiveness in mice by means of mechanisms including CD8 + cells and antigen-specif- ic IgE Abbreviations used BAL: Bronchoalveolar lavage BALF: Bronchoalveolar lavage fluid FRC: Functional residual capacity H 1 N 1 : Influenza virus A/PR/8/34 H 3 N 2 : Influenza virus A/Guizhou-X PD 35 Mch: Cumulative dose of inhaled methacholine at which airway resistance increases by 35% PFU: Plaque-forming unit sRaw: Specific airway resistance sRaw L : sRaw of the lower airway",

Influenza causes exfoliation of epithelial cells and increases permeability of the respiratory mucosal barrier to antigen penetration with the enhanced likelihood of IgE antibody sensitization. Respiratory virus infection has been proposed as a common trigger factor in the development of allergy in genetically susceptible children. 10 Several studies of sensitization to allergens by inhalation alone are reported, and repeated exposure to allergen at a high concentration is needed. 11 Sakamoto et al 12 have shown that IgE antibody production in response to an inhaled antigen occurs in mice that have been infected with influenza A virus, but not in animals with no infection. Thus we hypothesized that a respiratory viral infection promotes sensitization to inhaled antigen and may cause asthma. To test this hypothesis, mice were infected with influenza type A virus; during the acute phase, animals were exposed to aerosols of ovalbumin. Two weeks after ovalbumin sensitization, mice were challenged with ovalbumin aerosols; 24 hours after challenge, airway responsiveness to methacholine, levels of ovalbumin-specific IgE, and bronchoalveolar lavage fluid were examined. We used 2 strains of influenza A viruses (A/PR/8/34 [H 1 N 1 ] and A/Guizhou-X [H 3 N 2 ]) to examine any difference in the effect of the strain of influenza A viruses on allergic sensitization.",

No difference in airway responsiveness, ovalbumin-specific IgE, or cells in BALF was observed between the 2 strains of influenza A virus (H 1 N 1 and H 3 N 2 ) . This is the first report that in mice, influenza A virus infection boosts sensitization by inhalation of a low-concentration antigen and increases airway responsiveness. Although in animal asthma models, subcutaneous or intraperitoneal injection is a common route of antigen immunization, 17, 18 our inhalation sensitization technique may reflect more appropriately the actual route of sensitization in the development of human asthma. Our study suggests that viral infection is important for triggering sensitization to aeroallergen and the onset of asthma.",

We used 2 strains of influenza A virus, H 1 N 1 and H 3 N 2 , to examine differences in virus strain on the effects of allergen sensitization. In the present study, the highest dose of influenza viruses caused pneumonia and all animals died. With moderate doses of the viruses used for the allergen sensitization study, animals survived without pneumonia and showed infiltration of mononuclear cells into the airway wall and perivascular area 3 days after inoculation. Although in the present study, the virulence of viruses was stronger in strain H 1 N 1 than H 3 N 2 , the doses of the 2 strains used for sensitization caused comparable changes in histologic condition. These changes were similar to previous studies. 19, 20 Sensitization by ovalbumin was performed during the acute phase of infection, 4 to 8 days after virus inoculation. Thus virus infection damages the airway epithelium so that changes in epithelial permeability may facilitate the access of allergens from the lumen to the airway wall.",

BAL was performed 22 days after virus inoculation, and the total cell number in groups with virus infection alone did not differ from that of groups inoculated with PBS. The increased cell number in the lung during the acute phase of influenza virus infection declined to normal values between 2 and 4 weeks after inoculation. 21 The percent lymphocyte was increased in animals with virus infec- tion. Circulating lymphocytes are reported to decrease during the acute phase of infection, and this decrease persists for 4 weeks after virus inoculation. 22 Lymphocytes may accumulate in the lung during virus infection, in association with a decrease in the circulation. In an analysis of lymphocyte subsets, the T-cell population was found to increase with virus infection alone (group 4). In T-cell subsets in virus infection alone (group 4), CD8 + T cells increased but not CD4 + T cells, although no change in either CD4 + or CD8 + T cells was observed in the groups inoculated with PBS (groups 1 and 2) . The CD4/CD8 ratio of BALF lymphocytes decreased in influenza virus infection, primarily because of an increase in CD8 + T cells. These changes in T-cell subsets were similar to previous studies of virus infection. [21] [22] [23] During convalescence from respiratory syncytial virus infection, the circulating CD8 + T-cell number was lower in patients with wheezing than in those without wheezing; however, no difference in CD4 + T cells was seen. 24 This suggests that CD8 + T cells may accumulate in the lung of patients who wheeze. Allergen sensitization has been considered to be controlled by CD4 + T cells. In animal models of inhalation sensitization with ovalbumin, T-cell subsets in the spleen are reported to change; CD8 + T cells increase and the CD4/CD8 ratio decreases after sensitization. 25 Induction of a T H2 immune response to ovalbumin switches the virus-infected CD8 + T-cell response to IL-5 production. 26 Thus in allergen sensitization after virus infection, CD8 + T cells increase in the lung. It is likely that allergen sensitization after virus infection is controlled directly by CD8 + T cells or by cytokines produced by these CD8 + T cells.",

Inhalation of 0.05% ovalbumin with influenza infection produced a high level of ovalbuminspecific IgE but no difference in IgE production between H 1 N 1 and H 3 N 2 strains. Sakamoto et al 12 showed that 0.05% ovalbumin inhalation after influenza A virus infection generated ovalbumin-specific IgE measured by PCA. Therefore influenza A infection can amplify IgE production in exposure to aerosols of a low-concentration allergen, which alone cannot produce IgE. In a prospective study, 10 allergic symptoms and immunologic evidence (such as IgE RAST for specific allergens) developed in children with 2 parents with allergies. Upper respiratory infection occurred in 10 of the 11 children 1 to 2 months before the onset of allergic sensitization. Why does virus infection enhance production of specific IgE by allergen inhalation? Respiratory syncytial virus-infected mice developed high ovalbumin-specific IgE in response to intranasal sensitization of ovalbumin; however, uninfected animals did not, suggesting that respiratory virus infection may change the immune response to antigens. 28 In rats from which alveolar macrophages were eliminated, IgE production increased in response to inhaled allergen. 29 Resident alveolar macrophages are reported to downregulate antigen that had cell functions of pulmonary dendritic cells. 30 Our BALF analysis showed that infection with influenza A viruses increased lymphocytes and decreased the number of alveolar macrophages. It is likely that virus infection enhances antigen cell function, resulting in an increase in IgE production. Further, CD8 + T cells of influenza virus-infected mice can coexpress different combinations of T H1 and T H2 cytokines, IL-5, and IFN-\u03b3. 21 It is also reported that virus-specific CD8 + cells in the lung switch to IL-5 production. 26 IL-5 upregulates IgE synthesis. 31 Further, CD3cells in the lung of influenza virus-infected mice express mRNA for IL-4, IL-6, and granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factor. 21 Thus influenza virus infection may cause a cell-population change in lung tissue, a functional change of T cells, and cytokine production that is not restricted to the T-cell population, resulting in an increase of IgE production.",

We confirmed that sRaw reflects the change in the lower airway resistance (Fig 3) . However, our absolute values of airway resistance calculated by assuming a functional residual capacity (FRC) of 1 mL are approximately 6 cm H 2 O/mL/s in the baseline and higher than the previously reported values, 34, 35 in which resistance was measured during mechanical ventilation after anesthesia was induced. Their methods of resistance measurement were different from ours. Their ventilation frequency and the magnitude of tidal ventilation were determined by each setting of a ventilator, and FRC was adjusted by controlling the end-expiratory pressure. Our mice breathed air spontaneously. Thus differences in method of resistance measurement, FRC, ventilation fre-quency, and tidal volume may affect the absolute values of resistance. Further studies may be needed for determination of precise values of airway resistance in mice.",

However, inhalation sensitization of 0.05% ovalbumin with PBS inoculation increased neither airway responsiveness nor IgE production. This lack of allergic response may be due to too low concentration of inhaled allergen.",

            "text": "In the ovalbumin sensitization group with influenzavirus infection, airway responsiveness was increased, although neither virus infection alone nor ovalbumin sensitization alone affected it. Airway responsiveness was measured 22 days after inoculation of viruses, when the BAL-cell number was not increased and inflammatory changes had recovered histologically. In our model, such airway inflammation may not cause an increase in airway responsiveness. Mechanically, airway diameter may relate to airway response. The baseline airway resistance did not differ among experimental groups. Therefore the increase in airway responsiveness may not be due to airway obstruction. Inflammation by eosinophils in the airway is an important cause of increased airway responsiveness. 36 A relationship between eosinophil number in BALF and airway responsiveness is shown in mild asthma. 37 In animals, an increase in airway responsiveness is reported to be associated with eosinophil infiltration of the lung tissue. 38, 39 In our BALF, however, eosinophils were not found in ovalbumin sensitization with virus infection. In some asthma models of mice, 16,27 airway responsiveness was not associated with eosinophilia in lung tissue or BALF, as reflected in our results. This suggests that an increase in airway responsiveness may develop by means of mechanisms independent of eosinophil inflammation. 27 When T cells of ovalbumin-sensitized animals were transferred to naive animals, an increase in airway responsiveness was induced in transferred animals. 40 T cells, particularly CD8 + T cells, were increased in the group of ovalbumin sensitization with virus infection. Recently, it was reported that ovalbumin-sensitized animals depleted of CD8 + T cells did not develop airway hyperresponsiveness, although animals with ovalbumin sensitization alone had airway hyperresponsiveness. 38 Transfer of CD8 + T cells restored the airway hyperresponsiveness. When virus-specific CD8 + cells are challenged by a different antigen, a T H2 -type immune response involving IL-5 production and eosinophilia occurs in the airway. 26 As described earlier, virus-infected CD8 + T cells may enhance IgE production. Induction of allergen-specific IgE production is believed to be 1 of the elements contributing to increased airway responsiveness. 41 In various animal models of asthma, airway responsiveness increases with the increase in IgE level. 11, 16, 25, 27, 39 In this regard, our data compare with the previous studies. Therefore an increase in the IgEand T H2 -type immune response of CD8 + T cells may contribute to the increase in airway responsiveness.",
