Herein a model is described connecting the production of genetic variability with increasing genome size. Comparing all known zoonotic viral genome sizes to known non-zoonotic viral genome sizes demonstrates that zoonotic viruses have significantly larger genomes. These results support the notion that large viral genomes are important in producing new zoonotic disease, and suggest that genome size may be a useful surrogate in screening for potential zoonotic viruses.",

Although this figure may represent over 2 billion new cases annually, zoonoses are characteristically underreported and misdiagnosed [2] . Because zoonoses affect humans and other vertebrates, they also generate substantial economic losses, as livestock death and human disability lead to loss of productivity [3] . For example, economic losses due to Ebola in 2014 were $2.2 billion [4] . Zoonotic outbreaks also present an increasingly pressing risk to human health due to higher densities of people with little to no immunity to novel pathogens. They are often unpredictable in occurrence and are caused by new species against which there are no developed vaccines, treatment, or public health protocol. This is particularly true for viruses that have great capacity to mutate, even during the course of a pandemic [1, 5] . This century has seen numerous pandemics caused by zoonotic viruses like Ebola, Nipah, Avian Influenza, and Coronavirus [5] .",

The Wuhan province in China, where the virus emerged, effectively quarantined its populace, and many countries restricted travel of their own citizens to China. Although human to human transmission is driving current transmission, its emergence was facilitated by close human-animal contact, much like its predecessors SARS and MERS [8] . Members of the Coronavididae family are widely known to jump across host taxa to become infectious in new populations [9, 10] . Non-pathogenic varieties in a reservoir population can become pathogenic in new species. This phenomenon is well documented in many viral zoonoses, yet Coronaviruses pose exceptional risk to human populations due to the variety of potential reservoirs and the virulence of the emergent pandemics they 2 cause [10] . The ability of Coronaviruses to shift to new species is due in part to the mutation rate they exhibit, but they are not exceptional among viruses in this way. They are exceptional, however, in their high frequency of recombination and in possessing the largest of the ssRNA viral genomes [11, 12] . These two characteristics provide ample opportunity for Coronaviruses to evolve new traits and establish themselves in new host species.",

For example, RNA viruses characteristically mutate faster than DNA viruses due to polymerase infidelity, and hypermutable regions within some viral genomes have been demonstrated.

The variety of mechanisms by which genetic variation can be produced makes finding clear patterns in zoonotic risk difficult [2, 13] . One yet unconsidered viral characteristic likely to facilitate cross-species infections is the size of the viral genome. Both the total number of mutations accumulated during replication and the probability of a recombination event increase with the size of a genome when replication mechanisms are conserved, though nucleotide substitutions from either process often lead to net reduction in fitness of progeny. The number of substitutions, thus potential for reduction in host-specific fitness, increases with genome size [16] [17] [18] . If genetic variability is instrumental in producing cross-species infections, genome size should be positively related to the likelihood of viral spillover events provided lethal substitutions do not substantially reduce the mean fitness of the viral population.",

What is clear is that transcription and gene regulation networks can become more complex with increasing number of nucleotides [20, 21] . Variability produced with each replication event can be more accurately approximated. Variability is produced via mutation and recombination (reassortment, non-homologous and homologous). Given per nucleotide rates of mutation (\u00b5) and recombination (R), the accumulation of variability per genome should increase linearly as (\u00b5 + R(1 \u2212 \u00b5))L. When \u00b5 and R are small, this variability can be expressed as (\u00b5 + R)L. Lethal mutagenesis and incompatible recombinants reduce viability of viral products.

Per nucleotide variability production decreases with genome size due to reduced fitness with accumulated substitutions (Fig. 1A ). However, genome-level variability production increases almost linearly with genome size, revealing that the rate of fitness reduction from the accumulation of deleterious substitutions does not outpace the increased variability associated with increase in genome size (Fig. 1B) .

Variability production per unit time continues to decline for genome sizes larger than 50,000 nt, though no known ssRNA viruses have genomes larger than 35,000 nt [12] . The maximum variability production per unit time is dependent on the efficiency of replication. Because Coronaviruses have much larger genomes than other ssRNA(+) viruses, they have evolved 3 \u2212 \u2192 5 exoribonuclease repair and have lower mutation rates than other ssRNA(+) viruses [24] .

Considering these theoretical results, variability is greater per virion produced for viruses with larger genomes. Because population-level production of variability has been shown to improve viral survival via immune evasion [14] , there is likely strong selection toward viral genome sizes close to the peak described by equation 4 (Fig. 1C) . Even in the absence of phenotypic plasticity conferred by large genomes, viruses with large genomes have high potential to generate variability that promotes cross-species transmission events. Zoonotic viruses should, therefore, possess larger genomes than other viruses. To examine the relationship between viral genome size and likelihood of zoonosis, this study compiles a comprehensive list of all known viral zoonoses and leverages the entire NCBI database of viral genomes [12].",

Viruses with a wide host range likely share characteristics with zoonotic viruses, and based on these results, should have large genomes as well. For example, numerous species of Coronavirus are included in the non-zoonotic list (n=42) because they are not directly implicated in zoonoses, yet they are known to exhibit wide host ranges [9, 10] . Specifically, several bat Coronaviruses are in the non-zoonotic list, though researchers largely regard these viruses as the close relatives to SARS and MERS CoV [25] . This fact likely impaired the resolution of the relationship between genome size and cross-species transmission, resulting in the single non-significant pvalue across evaluated groups. Large genomes are likely to facilitate zoonotic transmission via high mutational load per genome replication or high probability of recombination; both processes produce variability by which cross-species infection may occur. Genome sizes for some viral groups, especially dsDNA viruses, are tightly correlated with increasing number of genes (R 2 = 0.91, Fig. S2 ). More coding regions within the genome could lead to greater plasticity and expanded host range, as reliance on host replication machinery is reduced [21, 26] .",

Though mutation rate is 100 fold lower per nucleotide for dsDNA viruses than for RNA viruses, their much larger genomes enable a comparable likelihood of accumulating at least one mutation during replication. A negative correlation between mutation rate and genome size has been noted for a small set of viruses for which mutation rate has been directly measured [14] . Much of the correlation for RNA viruses results from measurement of bacteriophage mutation rate, and this interesting relationship should be further explored. Coronaviruses have evolved 3 \u2212 \u2192 5 proofreading capabilities to accommodate mutagenesis associated with a large genome [24] . As recombination is generally associated with lower reduction in fitness compared to mutation, recombination may be the preferred mechanism to generate genetic variability for the viruses with the largest genomes. dsDNA viruses are known to have high per nucleotide rates of non-homologous recombination. Because of the large genome sizes of dsDNA viruses, the likelihood of at least one recombination event occurring during replication of the genome is high [15, 27] . The many coded genes of ds-DNA viruses allow more easily incorporation of recombinant DNA without deleterious effects and may reduce host specificity through phenotypic plasticity [15, 17] . In contrast, Papillomaviruses are dsDNA viruses that are characteristically species-specific [28] . These viruses have small genomes with little plasticity to accommodate recombinant DNA or expand host range. dsRNA viruses are highly segmented, and the number of segments is highly correlated with the size of the genome (R 2 = 0.84, Fig. S2) , which allows for a high degree of recombination via reassortment of segments during a coinfection [15] . Gene expression is regulated by translation for ssRNA(+) viruses. This group includes Coronaviruses and is known for high levels of homologous recombination because of frequent template switching during discontinuous transcription. Having the largest RNA viral genomes, Coronaviruses can produce over 25% recombinant progeny with their high rates of recombination [11, 15] . ssRNA(-) viruses are not known to recombine with high frequency, so their genetic variation relies on high mutation 8 .

Pseudodiploidy in retroviruses can promote recombination due to the physical proximity of RNA strands in the virion as well as partial masking of deleterious mutations [30] . Large genomes are more likely to contain intergenic, non-coding regions that assist in gene regulation but also serve as hotspots for recombination and mutation due to weaker selection to conserve these regions [17] . Viral zoonoses can emerge as a result of large genetic changes associated with recombination or significant mutation-both more likely to occur in large genomes. Phenotypic plasticity is hypothesized to be positively related to genome size and may facilitate cross-species transmission, though this notion requires future exploration. The relationship between likelihood of zoonotic transmission and genome size has implications for predicting future zoonoses and for understanding general principles about viral life history. Host specificity may be considered a function of genome reduction. Guiding principles like the relationship between genome size and host range should be explored to broaden scientific understanding of the viral world and its role in ecosystems. Predicting future epidemics requires knowledge of potential zoonotic viruses. Far less than 1% of viruses have been discovered, and the potential host interactions of each viral species are even less well-characterized, making zoonotic risks difficult to estimate [31] . These data demonstrate that viral genome size is an effective indicator of zoonotic risk across viral genome subtypes. In an age of high-throughput genomics and rapid discovery of new viruses, characterization of recombination and mutation rates is far slower and more laborintensive than genome sequencing, making genome size an appealing first step in zoonotic risk evaluation. Analysis of viral genome size and structure has the potential to provide deep insights in predicting future pandemics.",

Substitution events are assumed to be deleterious. Each event contributes to the reduction in fitness of the viral progeny, and these events accumulate in a genome, creating non-linear declines in fitness. Viral genome size is constrained by this reduction in fitness: larger genomes accumulate more substitutions and potential for fitness reduction is greater than for small genomes [14, 18] . Nucleotide-level fitness thus corresponds to genome-level fitness, and successful production of nucleotide variability is constrained by the fitness decay that occurs with increasing genome size. For purposes here, fitness will be synonymous with viability of each replicated genome. Setting the fitness of the parental virion or template genome at 1, fitness of progeny takes values between 0 and 1. Because a mutation and recombination event at a given nucleotide are mutually exclusive, the probability of each event occurring separately can be calculated as",

The value for I chosen was simply an order of magnitude smaller than the large Coronavirus genomes, though this delay has not been quantified in scientific literature. This value is important in determining the genome size at which the maximum rate of production of genetic variability (per second) occurs. \u00b5 is the mutation rate per nucleotide per replication event by RNA dependent RNA polymerase.

There is likely variation in the respective proportions of each for viruses, though few attempts have been made to quantify these proportions. In the study referenced, one-third of mutations resulted in viral particles that were not capable of infecting (infectivity assay). This constitutes a lethal mutation and is a good estimate of fitness reduction for cross-species transmission events. \u03c1 represents the effective tolerance of proteins to a single recombination event. Misfolding proteins likely constitute lethality or severe reduction in fitness in viruses, so this measure is used to simulate the reduction in fitness in the event of amino acid substitutions due to recombination.

Higher dissimilarity results in higher probability of amino acid substitutions due to recombination. 12% dissimilarity is the nucleotide dissimilarity between COVID-19 and SARS-COV.",
