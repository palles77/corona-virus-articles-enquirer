Since its first description in 2005 by Allander et al., it has been found worldwide in respiratory specimens from children with lower respiratory tract (LRT) infection with a prevalence varying from 1.5% to 19%. 2, 3 HBoV has also been isolated from faeces of children with gastroenteritis, with or without respiratory symptoms. 4 Recent studies have described two novel HBoV groups, named HBoV2 and HBoV3. 5 Publications addressing the epidemiology of nosocomial respiratory virus infection are scarce. A few authors have reported cases of nosocomial HBoV infection, mostly acquired in intensive care units. 6e8 As a potential new agent of nosocomial childhood infection, we screened for HBoV in young children with respiratory tract infection.",

Kesebir et al. reported three children who were infected in the hospital, all of whom had a history of premature birth and chronic lung disease. 6 Chow et al. reported three cases of nosocomial HBoV, two in the NICU. 8 Calvo et al. described two newborns with HBoV in the NICU, both premature and receiving mechanical ventilation. 7 In this paper we describe 10 further cases of nosocomial HBoV infection in children and infants. Sequence analysis of eight of the infecting viruses revealed three different strains of HBoV group 1, denominated A (six cases), B (one case) and C (one case).",
