A disaster, on the other hand, is the potential consequence of a hazard, where a community or population is unable to handle the effects of the hazard, given the resources at their disposal. Although distinct from each other, Figure 1 shows the conceptualization of how a hazard relates to a disaster given the ability of a population to utilize available resources.

Hazards are grouped into three categories: technological, natural, and environmental degradation hazards (U.N. . Technological hazards are industrial (pollution), nuclear (nuclear leak), or structural (dam collapse), while environmental degradation hazards include events that disrupt the environment, ecosystem, or natural resources (i.e., deforestation, forest fires, change in climate). Both technological hazards and environmental degradation hazards are the result of human behavior while natural hazards are events that are a direct result of natural processes. Natural hazards are the focal point of this article and are further categorized into hydrometerological, geological, and biological. Hydrometerological hazards, the most common natural hazards, are related to the climate, oceans, or movement of wet mass such as floods, droughts, and heat waves like the 2010 Russian heat wave (resulted in a disaster that claimed 56 000 lives (U.N. ISDR, 2011)). Geological hazards involve changes due to tectonic plates or fault shifting (tsunamis result from shifting of faults) or mass movement of solid mass. Biological hazards are events that involve the rapid incidence and prevalence of vector-driven diseases, toxins, or pathogens. The emergence of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003 is an example of a biological hazard that resulted in disastrous effects (spread through air travel), killing over 400 people . Figure 2 is a classification of hazards adopted and modified from the UNISDR, showing the three categories of hazards, focusing on natural disasters (U.N. . Additionally, the figure displays that although separate components of natural disasters, hydrometerological, geological, and biological disasters can interact. For example, floods and droughts can create a prime environment for biological hazards through vectorborne illnesses, such as cholera and malaria (U.N. ISDR, 2004).",

Essentially, it is a condition or set of conditions increases vulnerability if it hinders a population from coping with a hazard; thus promoting conditions for a disaster. As defined by the United Nations, vulnerability is the culmination of four factors: social, environmental, physical, and economic, each contributing to the vulnerability of a population alone or by interacting with each other (U.N. ). An example of vulnerability can be a population residing on an island below sea level near a fault line (physical factor). This population is identified as vulnerable because a hazard exists (earthquake and potential tsunami) and they are isolated from mainland resources.",

Rapid urbanization considerably increases the vulnerability to hazards (UNDP, 2004) . When the population of a city grows too quickly, building adequate infrastructure and basic settlements becomes a challenge. Poor housing and shanty communities pose significant risks as protection against even small hazards becomes compromised. Large populations create social economic disparities resulting in reduced access to resources (UNDP, 2004) .

Natural disasters vary drastically in terms of the impact that it creates on individuals, society, as well as government. One natural event may create destruction differently than another natural event (i.e., a tornado is entirely different from an earthquake). Not only do natural events vary, but the vulnerability of populations or communities can also differ. A severe natural event that rips through an open, unpopulated area may not be disastrous whereas a mild natural event that goes through a heavily populated city could, indeed, create a situation where the community is overwhelmed. Additionally, the resources available, (as well as methods of resource access), financial stability, and type of governing bodies significantly differ between communities and countries thus impacting the severity of the natural event.

Examples of such policy include initiating public education programs focusing on informing the community about evacuation procedures, first aid, family emergency plans, as well as available resources.

Furthermore, many forms of bacteria and viruses (even the most resistant kinds) are unable to survive in a dead body very long. As the body degrades, the temperature quickly drops, leaving an environment not conducive for bacteria or virus growth. Even though dead bodies pose little threat of epidemics during disasters, caution should be taken if the disaster takes place in an area prone to epidemics prior to the disaster. Not knowing the cause of death of a dead body can pose slight risk for those in direct contact if the death was due to an epidemic. HIV is a disease that can withstand the lower temperatures of a deceased body, lasting up to 16 days and therefore should be handled with extreme caution (Pan American Health Organization, 2004).",

Interestingly, despite a slight decrease in the reported number of natural disasters,Figure 4shows that the number of deaths per year due to natural disasters is slightly increasing. Furthermore, the average yearly economic impact of natural disaster in 2011 of US$366 billion far exceeds the decade average of US$108 billion(CRED, 2012).
