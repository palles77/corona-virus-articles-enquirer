By comparison, prior to eradication, annual losses in the U.S. to classical swine fever (hog cholera) and pseudorabies virus were estimated at $364.09 million (Wise, 1981) and $36.27 million (Hallam et al., 1987) , respectively (adjusted to year 2004 dollars).",

Several epidemiological investigations showed that proximity to infected herds increased the risk of a herd acquiring PRRS virus. In France, Le Potier et al. (1997) found that 45% of herds suspected to have become infected through area Veterinary Microbiology 159 (2012) [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] The objective of this research was to estimate the effects of temperature and relative humidity on the inactivation of airborne porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome (PRRS) virus by ultraviolet light (UV 254 ). Aerosols of PRRS virus were exposed to one of four doses of UV 254 under nine combinations of temperature (n = 3) and relative humidity (n = 3). Inactivation constants (k), defined as the absolute value of the slope of the linear relationship between the survival fraction of the microbial population and the UV 254 exposure dose, were estimated using the random coefficient model. The associated UV 254 half-life dose for each combination of environmental factors was determined as (log 10 2/k) and expressed as UV 254 mJ per unit volume. The effects of UV 254 dose, temperature, and relative humidity were all statistically significant, as were the interactions between UV 254 dose \u00c2 temperature and UV 254 dose \u00c2 relative humidity. PRRS virus was more susceptible to ultraviolet as temperature decreased; most susceptible to ultraviolet inactivation at relative humidity between 25% and 79%, less susceptible at relative humidity 24%, and least susceptible at !80% relative humidity. The current study allows for calculating the dose of UV 254 required to inactivate airborne PRRS virus under various laboratory and field conditions using the inactivation constants and UV 254 half-life doses reported therein.",

In Denmark it was observed that the likelihood of herd positivity increased as the density and proximity of PRRS virus-positive neighboring herds increased (Mortensen et al., 2002) . In the last decade, researchers have confirmed the occurrence of airborne transmission of PRRS virus over significant distances. Initially, Dee et al. (2005b) demonstrated that infectious airborne PRRS virus could travel over distances !150 m. Thereafter, using a source population of 300 PRRS virus-infected pigs, Dee et al. (2009) demonstrated long-distance airborne movement by the successful recovery of infectious virus up to 4.7 km from the source. Subsequently, Otake et al. (2010) recovered infectious airborne PRRS virus at distance of 9.1 km from the source. Cumulatively, the epidemiological and experimental data suggest that airborne PRRS virus is a significant, and perhaps the primary, means of area spread.",

Riley (1961) demonstrated that ventilated air from hospital tuberculosis wards produced tuberculosis in guinea pigs, but not when the air was irradiated with ultraviolet light. In recent years, UV 254 emitters have been engineered into areas where people congregate either by placing UV 254 light tube grids into existing ventilation ductwork or by installing free standing UVC emitters (Brickner et al., 2003; Dumyuahn and First, 1999; McDevitt et al., 2008; Menzies et al., 1999; Noakes et al., 2006) . Ultraviolet technology is appealing due to its low cost as compared to HEPA filtration (Brickner et al., 2003) . However, effective implementation must be based on achieving a dose of UV 254 sufficient to inactivate the target. No estimates of the effect of UV 254 on airborne PRRS virus have been published. Therefore, the objective of this experiment was to evaluate the capability of ultraviolet (UV 254 ) to inactivate airborne PRRS virus under varying conditions of temperature and relative humidity.",

Each combination of temperature and relative humidity was replicated 3 times. Samples of air collected after UV 254 treatment were titrated for infectious PRRS virus and the data used to calculate the UV 254 inactivation constants (k) and UV 254 half-life (T 1/2) exposure doses for each combination of temperature and relative humidity. nonessential amino acids (HyClone, Logan, UT, USA), 25 mM HEPES buffer (Sigma Chemical Co.) and 10.0% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (FBS) (Sigma Chemical Co.).

Since inactivation constants vary by temperature and relative humidity, a conservative estimate of the necessary UV 254 dose can be made using the smallest inactivation constant (k = 2.49, Table 3 ) and its associated UV 254 half-life dose. The percent of the infectious viral population remaining after n UV 254 halflife doses may be described as (1/2 n ); thus, the percent of infectious PRRS virus remaining after 10 UV 254 doses may be calculated as (1/2 10 ) = 0.1%. From this, the dose of UV 254 required to inactivate 99.9% of airborne PRRS virus may be calculated using the value from Table 3 as (0.121 mJ/area 2 / half-life) \u00c2 (10 half-lifes) = 1.21 mJ/area 2 . This exposure dose may be achieved under different conditions of ultraviolet intensity and airflow. As given by the Bunsen-Roscoe Law of Reciprocity, if achieved, this dose will be effective regardless of UV 254 intensity, distance, or residence time (Riley and Kaufman, 1972) .",
