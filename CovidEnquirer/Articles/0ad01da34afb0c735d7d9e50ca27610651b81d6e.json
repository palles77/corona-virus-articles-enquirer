Because persons with MERS often do not report any of these risk factors, we investigated MERS cases in Saudi Arabia during an apparent period of limited hospital transmission. Through telephone interviews of case-patients and information from routine investigations, we aimed to characterize exposures and to explore additional factors potentially important in disease transmission. We also genetically sequenced MERS-CoV from respiratory specimens to identify circulating strains.",

Classic CL starts as a red papule at the place of the insect bite; it gradually enlarges into a painless nodule or plaque-like lesion, which eventually becomes encrusted. When the crust falls off, a typical ulcer with raised and indurated border becomes apparent. CL can cause considerable illness and may leave disfiguring and disabling scars after healing. The interplay between Leishmania species and host immune response is complex, and, as a result, disease manifestations may vary substantially among species as well as among infected persons (1, 2) . An estimated 0.7-1.2 million new CL cases occur annually in tropical and subtropical regions of the world. CL is currently endemic in >98 countries worldwide; Afghanistan, Algeria, Colombia, Brazil, Iran, Syria, Ethiopia, North Sudan, Costa Rica, and Peru together account for up to 75% of global estimated CL incidence (3).",
