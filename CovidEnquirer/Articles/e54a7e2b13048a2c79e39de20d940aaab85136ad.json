Although it has been known that TGEV spiker protein is essential for the viral entry for many years, the detail knowledge of the TGEV fusion protein core is still very limited. Here, we report that TGEV fusion core (HR1-SGGRGG-HR2), in vitro expressed in GST prokaryotic expression system, shares the typical properties of the trimer of coiled-coil heterodimer (six a-helix bundle), which has been confirmed by a combined series of biochemical and biophysical evidences including size exclusion chromatography (gel-filtration), chemical crossing, and circular diagram. The 3D homologous structure model presents its most likely structure, extremely similar to those of the coronaviruses documented. Taken together, TGEV spiker protein belongs to the class I fusion protein, characterized by the existence of two heptad-repeat (HR) regions, HR1 and HR2, and the present knowledge about the truncated TGEV fusion protein core may facilitate in the design of the small molecule or polypeptide drugs targeting the membrane fusion between TGEV and its host.",

Transmissible gastroenteritis virus of swine (TGEV), a member of group I of coronaviruses, has been identified to be the key causative agent responsible for the TGE [1, 3] . To date, the only solution to prevent the disease only is to inoculate ordinary vaccines, which are either inactivated or tissue culture ones with lot of disadvantages, such as high cost, low effectiveness, etc. [2, 3] . Since none of the effective vaccines or drugs could be available, it seems to be very urgent to develop some genetic engineering vaccines or drugs specific for TGE [2] .",

It has been known that the envelope protein undergoes a series of conformational changes during the virus fusion process [3] [4] [5] [6] [9] [10] [11] . Two highly conserved heptad-repeat regions (HR1 and HR2) of S protein function as important modules/domains in this process and show different conformations in different fusion states [3, 6, 9] . Under the model given above, there are at least three conformational states of the envelope fusion protein, which include pre-fusion native state, pre-hairpin intermediate state, and post-hairpin state [3, 9, 10] . During these state transitions, the HR1 and HR2 are exposed to an intermediate conformational state but bind to each other to form the coiled-coil structure in an anti-parallel mode in the post-fusion stage. This coiled-coil bundle conformation is proposed to be important for bringing two lipid membranes (cellular and viral) into proximity with each other allowing the membrane fusion for viral entry into host cells [6, 9, 10] .",

The two above 3D structures drew the following picture: a 6-helix bundle with three HR2 helices packed against the hydrophobic grooves on the surface of central coiled-coil formed by three parallel HR1 helices in an oblique anti-parallel manner, indicating that both SARS-CoV and MHV adopt the so-called type I virus membrane fusion mechanism.

In this study, we intended to investigate the structural basis of TGEV fusion through providing the biochemical and biophysical traits of its fusion core, especially the possibility of the molecular apparatus of TGEV fusion applied in fusion inhibitor design for the treatment of TGE. Here, we deployed bio-engineering technique to design and prepare the protein of the TGEV fusion core (denoted as 2-Helix). The results of gel-filtration combined with circular dichroism (CD), chemical cross-linking, indicated that it is of trimer of heterodimer, coiled-coil bundle, implying that TGEV may adopt type I membrane fusion mechanism furthermore, the 3D structure model of TGEV fusion core clearly represented its most likely stereo configuration extremely similar to those of coronaviruses including HIV, etc. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] 17, 18] . In conclusion, the presented knowledge about the truncated TGEV fusion protein core will facilitate to design the small molecules or polypeptide drugs targeting the crucial step of TGEV membrane fusion, similar to T20 specific for HIV which has been successfully applied for the treatment of HIV infection.",

The porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) spiker gene used in this work was cloned from the Chinese isolate TH-98 (GenBank Accession No. AF494337). As shown in Fig. 1 , the TGEV S protein is a typical type I membrane protein. The HR1 and HR2 regions were predicted by using the computer software of LearnCoil-VMF, freely available from the website (http://night-ingale.lcs.mit.edu/cgi-bin/ vmf) [19] . The predicted HR1 region covers amino acids 1045-1184, whereas the relevant HR2 includes the amino acids 1339-1378 ( Fig. 1) . Considering the feasibility of the soluble expression of the fusion core generated in this experiment, the HR1 and HR2 regions of TGEV were adequately truncated and extended, respectively, on the basis of the multiple alignment of TGEV with the other coronaviruses in the conserved regions. Finally, the TGEV fusion core (2-Helix construct) was made by linking the modified HR1 (1057-1119) and HR2 (1326-1383) with a flexible linker (SGGRGG, single amino acid abbreviation used here), and then was inserted directionally into the prokaryotic expression vector pGEX-6P-1(Pharmacia) via the restriction sites BamHI and XhoI (introduced by PCR primers). The acquired recombinant expression plasmid, which harbored the interested DNA fragment of the TGEV fusion core was verified by direct DNA sequencing.",

Importantly, it has been confirmed to be a severe pathogen responsible for the porcine transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE), an acute and highly epidemic enteric infectious disease, which is associated with high morbidity in animals of all ages and with high mortality in suckling piglets [1, 2] . There is no doubt that it may result in an extremely enormous economic loss to piglet cultivation in the world every year, and thereby has attracted the attention of several virologists in the world to research the pathogenic mechanism of TGEV, and even interaction between TGEV and the host, porcine. In fact, so far, the only way used to prevent the disease is to inoculate ordinary vaccines, which are either inactivated or tissue culture ones with much disadvantages, such as high cost, low effectiveness, etc. Just due to lacking of effective vaccines or drugs, it seems to be very urgent and important to rationally design and eventually develop some genetically engineered vaccines or drugs specific for TGE [2] .",

Moreover, a 3D structure of TGEV fusion core, with maximum likelihood, was proposed by the homologous model. The current knowledge has told us that HR1 or its derivatives of NDV [20, 21] , HR2 or its derivative coming from HR2 (HIV, SARS-CoV, MHV, Hendra virus, Nipah virus, etc.) [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] 15, 22] , and even both HR1 and HR2 of hRSV [11, 12, 14] can inhibit the membrane fusion during the virus entry into its host, perturbing the successful infection of virus. It will be of interest to test whether HR1 or HR2 has the inhibitory activity in the next work. Anyway, it did first provide us the biochemical and biophysical basis of the TGEV fusion core, pointing out a novel direction to design the polypeptide or small molecule drugs, perturbing TGEV fusion with its host membrane, for the prevention and therapeutics of TGE.",
