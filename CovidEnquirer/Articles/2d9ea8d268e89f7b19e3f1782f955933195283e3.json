            "text": "Background: Respiratory tract infections are widespread and may cause significant morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed populations such as oncological patients. Objectives: The RealAccurate Respiratory RT PCR Kit covering 14 respiratory viruses was compared to the RespiFinder Smart22, a broad-spectrum multiplex ligation-dependent probe amplification (MLPA) test, targeting 22 viral and bacterial respiratory pathogens. Study design: After verification of its analytical performance, the clinical performance of the RespiFinder Smart22 was evaluated by re-analysis of 96 respiratory samples from oncological patients. Additionally, the time to result (TTR) of both methods was compared. Results: The analytical performance of the RespiFinder Smart22 fulfilled all previously specified criteria. Concordant results in both assays were achieved in 74.0% of all clinical specimens and in 91.2% when only positive results were taken into account. The RespiFinder Smart22 yielded additional results in a total of 22 (22.9% of 96) samples due to higher test sensitivity and a broader, highly multiplexed spectrum of pathogens. The TTR of a typical routine test consisting of three samples were 206 and 356 min for the RealAccurate Respiratory RT PCR Kit and the RespiFinder Smart22, respectively. However, hands-on time was reduced by 59.0% applying the MLPA method. Conclusions: In our hands, the RespiFinder Smart22 showed excellent analytical performance while hands-on time was halved in comparison to the RT PCR method. Regarding the clinical evaluation, the MLPA method provided additional results in 22.9% (22/96) of specimens due to its comprehensive format, higher test sensitivity and the capability to detect 22 pathogens compared to 14 with the RealAccurate Respiratory RT PCR Kit.",

Especially during the colder season respiratory tract infections occur frequently and may cause significant morbidity and mortality in immunosuppressed populations such as oncological patients [2] [3] [4] . The clinical presentation of an infection with respiratory pathogens can range from asymptomatic to severe disease. Considering the broad range of respiratory pathogens it is hardly possible to assign clinical symptoms to a distinct etiology. Hence, molecular diagnostic methods have been established as gold standard and are replacing less sensitive and more http laborious traditional diagnostic methods such as virus isolation by culture or direct immunofluorescence [1, 3, [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . However, the comprehensive investigation of a respiratory tract infection is timeand resource-consuming when applying singleplex PCR. Therefore, multiplex-based test methods for the detection of numerous respiratory pathogens are entering routine diagnostics [8, 9, 11, 12] .",

Besides higher test sensitivity the extended spectrum of the RespiFinder Smart22 contributed to the higher positivity rate as Bocavirus and CoV-HKU1 were detected in 7.3% of the samples. A further reason for the difference in the positivity rate is the selective ordering in routine diagnosis. In six (6.3% of the total 96) samples the MLPA method detected an additional pathogen, which is actually included in the range of the RealAccurate Respiratory RT PCR Kit but had not been ordered. The results of five of these samples were confirmed by the reference laboratory. Retesting with the RT PCR method yielded a result in four of the six samples, confirming the higher test sensitivity of the RespiFinder Smart22 for Rhv/Entero. Narrow spectrum diagnostics of respiratory tract infections is considered problematic because of their nonspecific clinical presentation [3] . Therefore, PCR detection of InfA/B, RSV, PIV and in second line hMPV, Rhv/Entero, CoV and Adv is recommended for at-risk patients [21, 22] . Especially in HSCT recipients it is important to accurately and swiftly diagnose respiratory infections because of potential progression to severe complications such as pneumonia and also for hospital hygiene reasons [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] .",

            "text": "The MLPA method has an extended pathogen spectrum compared to the RT PCR method and in our study we have detected two viral pathogens of this spectrum; Bocavirus in two samples of one patient and CoV-HKU1 in five samples of four different patients. The role of the human Bocavirus in respiratory tract infections is not yet fully understood, a pathogenic potential is only attributed to infections with high viral loads [22, 30] or to the function of a helper virus which may trigger the replication of another respiratory virus [30] . Unlike the Bocavirus, CoV-HKU1 has a clear clinical relevance in respiratory tract infections as reported by Milano et al. in a sample collective of 215 HSCT recipients [25] . In our study collective a Coronavirus was detected in 12 (12.5%) of the samples of which 5 (5.2%) were CoV-HKU1.",

The RespiFinder Smart22 showed a TTR of 5 h 56 min for three clinical samples which is consistent with the 6 h indicated by the manufacturer. Since 90.4% of the TTR consist of incubation time the manufacturer recently introduced an updated version of the kit with a reduction of incubation time by 2 h [31] . Thus, reporting results within a working day of 8 h should easily be possible. The TTR of the RealAccurate Respiratory RT PCR Kit was 3 h 26 min which is significantly longer than the TTR of 2 h stated by the manufacturer since independent of the numbers of patient samples already the LC-run lasts 123 min [32] . When analyzing the complete respiratory panel of three samples in parallel, two LightCyclers are needed or, if there is only one machine, incubation time doubles and the receipt of the results is delayed by 123 min. However, if a 96-well Real Time PCR instrument is available three samples can be processed in a single run. The multiplex format of the RespiFinder Smart22 allows analysis of up to 15 patient samples in parallel, underscoring the advantage of multiplex-based methods in comparison to singleplex PCR concerning the factor time [5] . Most important, hands on time (HOT) was more than halved by the MLPA method, which is a significant improvement regarding lab staff time commitment.",
