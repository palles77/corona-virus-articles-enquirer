The method consists of three parts: (i) simple alignment algorithm, (ii) extension algorithm for largest common substring, (iii) graphical simple alignment tree (GSA tree). The approach firstly obtains a graphical representation of scores of DNA sequences by the scoring equation R 0 \u00c3 R\u00c0S 0 \u00c3 S\u00c0T 0 \u00c3 \u00f0a \u00fe bk\u00de. Then a GSA tree is constructed to facilitate solving the problem for global alignment of 2 DNA sequences. Finally we give several practical examples to illustrate the utility and practicality of the approach.",

            "text": "The decoding of different genomes, in particular the human genomes has triggered a great deal of bioinformatics research. The research of sequence similarity to a known protein sequence or DNA sequence has been an important method to provide the first clues about the function of a newly sequenced gene. The research becomes increasingly useful in the analysis of newly sequenced genes as the sequence databases, such as DNA and protein databases, continue to grow in size. There are a number of standard schemes widely used to search for homologous sequences in nucleotide and protein databases to distinguish biologically significant relationships from chance similarities (Smith and Waterman, 1981; Waterman, 1984; Pearson and Lipman, 1988; Altschul et al., 1990 Altschul et al., , 1997 Tatiana and Thomas, 1999) . The dynamic programming algorithms (Smith and Waterman, 1981; Waterman, 1984) assign scores to insertions, deletions and replacement, and compute an alignment of two sequences. These algorithms are impractical for searching large database because of their computational requirements. Rapid heuristic algorithms (Pearson and Lipman, 1988; Altschul et al., 1990 Altschul et al., , 1997 compare protein and DNA sequences much faster than the above methods. They are widely used for large database searches. However, a number of important scientific contexts involve the comparison of only two sequences and do not require a time-consuming database search. In order to meet these needs, many important tools for large database searches (Tatiana and Thomas, 1999 ; http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/emboss/align/ index.html; http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/bl2seq/wblast2.cgi) are further developed to employ global alignment of 2 protein and nucleotide sequences. These methods can provide the global profile of similarity degree. Recently, many graphical methods have also been used to examine the global similarities/dissimilarities among the coding sequences of different species Qi, 2007, 2009; Qi and Fan, 2007; Yao et al., 2006 Yao et al., , 2008a Randi\u0107 et al., 2003a, b) . Because of the advantages in visualization, graphical methods have become a powerful bioinformatics tool for the analysis of complicated biological systems, such as enzyme-catalyzed system (Chou et al., 1979; Chou, 1980; Forsen, 1980, 1981; Chou and Liu, 1981; Myers and Palmer, 1985; Zhou and Deng, 1984; Chou, 1989 Chou, , 1990 Kuzmic et al., 1992; Andraos, 2008) , protein folding kinetics (Chou, 1990 (Chou, , 1993 , condon usage (Chou and Zhang, 1992; Zhang and Chou, 1994) , HIV reverse transcriptase inhibition mechanisms (see Althaus et al., 1993a, b , c, as well as a review article ), base frequency distribution in the anti-sense strands (Chou et al., 1996) and classifying organisms (Sorimachi and Okayasu, 2008; Okayasu and Sorimachi, 2009; . Recently, the images of cellular automata were used to represent biological sequences , predict protein subcellular location (Xiao et al., 2006a) , investigate HBV virus gene missense mutation (Xiao et al., 2005b) and HBV viral infections , predicting protein structural classes (Xiao et al., 2008) and G-protein-coupled receptor functional classes (Xiao et al., 2009 ), as well as analyze the fingerprint of SARS coronavirus (Wang et al., 2005; Gao et al., 2006) .",

Some graphical descriptions are also used to intuitively explain the scheme. The method consists of three parts: (i) simple alignment algorithm, (ii) extension algorithm for largest common substring, (iii) graphical simple alignment tree (GSA tree). Here, we firstly obtain a 2-dimension (2D) graphical curve by graphical representation of scores of DNA sequences. A good simple alignment of the DNA sequences is generated when the score of the scoring curve reaches its peak value. The 2D graphical curve can intuitively show the global change of simple alignment scores based on scoring matrix. Then the largest common substrings of the good simple alignment are found out. Because of the limit of the initial alignment reaching peak score, the largest common substrings of original two sequences may be split by the largest common substrings of the good simple alignment. In order to protect these common substrings from being split, an extension algorithm for the largest common substring is suggested. Then all largest common substrings are found out when the initial alignment reaches peak score. The process is repeatedly done until GSA tree comes into being. The tree can facilitate solving the problem for global alignment of 2 DNA sequences. At last, we give several practical examples to illustrate the utility and practicality of the approach.",

As for protein sequences, the matrix is often based on observed substitution rates, derived from the substitution frequencies seen in multiple alignments of sequences. Every possible identity and substitution is assigned a score based on the observed frequencies in alignments of related proteins. Similarly, every possible identity and substitution in alignments of related DNA sequences is also assigned a score. However, the scoring matrix in alignment of DNA sequences is relatively simple and intuitional. Table 1 is a scoring matrix. An identity in scoring matrix is assigned a positive score R \u00f0R 4 0\u00de. A substitution is assigned a positive score S \u00f0S 40\u00de. But the score S must be subtracted from the total score of an alignment. For example, an alignment of two short DNA sequences ATGGTGCAACTGACT and ATGGTGCACTTGACT is the following:",

A 'gap open' penalty is one that is the cost for the first space of each gap spaces. A 'gap extension' penalty is one that is the cost for one of each gap spaces except for the first space. Typically, the cost of extending a gap is set to be 5-10 times lower than the cost for opening a gap (http:// www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/emboss/align/index.html). There is one way to compute a penalty for a gap of n positions: gap opening penalty + \u00f0n\u00c01\u00de \u00c3 gap extension penalty. Now, let parameter a be gap opening penalty and parameter b be gap extension penalty. And let parameter k be n\u00c01.

The alignment shows the approximate overall alignment feature of G 1 and G 2 . However, some C i of the largest common substrings of R may be a part of a larger common substring than C i because of the limit of the initial alignment reaching peak score.

(2) When k \u00bc K, none of the largest common substrings C i of R can be extended into larger common substring. The largest common substrings of R are, C 1 ; C 2 ; . . . C m . (3) When k oK, there exists at least a larger common substring than C i . There are several sub-steps to find out the larger common substrings as the following: (a) Let L L be the number of mismatches from the right end of C i\u00c01 to the left end of C i . When i \u00bc 1, L L denotes the number of mismatches from the left end of G 1 and G 2 to the left end of C 1 . Similarly, let L R be the number of mismatches from the right end of C i to the left end of C i \u00fe 1 . When i \u00bc 1, L R denotes the number of mismatches from the right end of C 1 to the right end of G 1 and G 2 . (b) When K oL L , the K mismatches are extracted from the left of C i . Otherwise, the L L mismatches are extracted from the left of C i . Similarly, when K oL R , the K mismatches are extracted from the right of C i . Otherwise, the L R mismatches are extracted from the right of C i . Then the sequences extracted from the left of C i , C i and from the right of C i are connected into two new sub-sequences S 1 i and S 2 i . (c) Now, we apply the simple alignment algorithm to S 1 i and S 2 i . If there exist a new larger common substring within S 1 i and S 2 i than C i , we will face a choice: the new larger common substring or C i . If there is an increment of sore when the new larger common substring comes into being, we will replace the original C i with the new substring also called as C i . (4) As for every C i of R, the original C i is replaced by the new largest common substring if the new substring exists. Now, we give a practical example to illustrate the above steps for a better understanding. There are two random sequences: G 1 (GCCTAGTTCCCCCA) and G 2 (GCCTCGCATCCCCCA). By the simple alignment algorithm a good simple alignment R of G 1 and G 2 is determined, where the alignment R is GCCTAGTTCCCCCA GCCTCGCATCCCCCA:",

According to the figure, we can obtain some conclusions of the global alignment between string G 1 (the complete coding sequence of ACCESSION U01317) and string G 2 (the complete coding sequence of ACCESSION J03643): Length: 448; Identities: 328/448 (73.2%); Gaps: 8/448 (1.8%); Score: 2772.

From the global view, the two methods almost get the same statistics results except for their scores. There is only one different area: the bases from 33 to 34 by GSA tree vs. the bases from 33 to 34 by needle. In fact, the two different areas are equivalent to each other.

There is no analytical formula to determine the 'best' gap values. Though GSA tree algorithm is a heuristic method, and could not always get the optimal alignment, the validity and practicality of the results can be ensured. Firstly, we discuss the influence about the initial simple alignment of GSA tree algorithm. In Section 3.2, we describe in detail the construction steps of GSA tree by the initial simple alignment. As for the overall result, the initial simple alignment is very important. It determines the extent to which the consolidated results close to optimal results.

Then we replace the original C i with the new larger common substring also called as C i . Once the largest common substrings C i is determined, it is looked on as a part of the overall result. Then in an optimal alignment of G 1 and G 2 (This hypothetical alignment may be obtained by an absolutely optimized algorithm), the two sequences of C i by GSA tree might be entirely overlapping in the optimal alignment, or partially overlapping, or one sequence might be entirely isolated from the other.
