Here we developed an approach to rapidly screen lineage B betacoronaviruses, such as SARS-CoV and the recent 2019-nCoV, for receptor usage and their ability to infect cell types from different species. We show that host protease processing during viral entry is a significant barrier for several lineage B viruses and that bypassing this barrier allows several lineage B viruses to enter human cells through an unknown receptor. We also demonstrate how different lineage B viruses can recombine to gain entry into human cells and confirm that human ACE2 is the receptor for the recently emerging 2019-nCoV. author/funder.

Additionally, a previous study showed that replacing the RBD of the lineage B bat virus, Rp3, allowed the virus to enter cells expressing human ACE2 (hACE2) 16 . We therefore developed a method to functionally test the RBDs from novel lineage B \u03b2-CoVs in place of the SARS-CoV spike RBD ( figure   1 ). Synthesizing just the RBD of spike is much faster and cost-effective than conventional pseudotyping methods that rely on synthesis of the full ~4kb spike sequence for novel CoVs: a process that can take weeks and is cost-prohibitive for large panels of spike sequences. The short turnaround time for our approach allowed us to test the receptor usage of all published, unique RBD sequences in lineage B, and also rapidly confirm the ACE2 receptor usage of the 2019-nCoV spike, which emerged in China in January 2020 as our study was ongoing.",

As we did for SARS-CoV spike, clade 2 and 3 spikes were codon optimized, FLAG-tagged and silent mutations were introduced to facilitate replacing their RBD with the consensus RBD from clade 1 (figure 5a). All chimeric constructs expressed similarly, with the exception for the SARS-BM48-31 RBD chimera, which exhibited reduced expression and incorporation (figure 5b). Protease treatment enhanced entry of both the As6526 clade 2 RBD chimera and full-length spike entry into Huh cells (figure 5c). Protease treatment had no effect on either the BM48-31 clade 3 chimera or full-length spike (figure 5c).

These findings are in strong agreement with previous studies that have either isolated virus (WIV1) or rescued recombinant chimeric viruses (SHC014, Rs4231, Rs7237) 5,7,31 . However, with trypsin, a subset of genetically-similar clade 2 RBDs gained entry in these cells, suggesting their barrier is at the level of protease processing ( figure 2a, b) . The other spike from clade 2 and 3 did not enter the cells we tested, regardless of protease addition, suggesting an absent or incompatible receptor. Surprisingly, the protease-dependent entry phenotype was consistent in the reverse spike chimeras in which we replaced the RBD in clade 2 or 3 spike with a clade 1 RBD (figure 5d), suggesting that either the protease site between S1/S2 is not compatible with the chimeric spike backbone or the protease is not expressed in these cells (figure s5). Because clade 1 spikes enter cells expressing human ACE2 without addition of protease but clade2-clade1 chimeras require protease, our data suggests the spike protease cleavage site is adapted to the protease environment of the receptor-bound RBD (figure s5). author/funder.

At the same time, improvements in next generation sequencing technology lead to a boom of virus discovery, uncovering thousands of novel virus sequences in wild animal populations around the world. While most of these viruses have never been found in humans, many are genetically similar to known human viruses within the betacoronaviruses (\u03b2-CoV) genus. The \u03b2-CoVs are further divided into four lineages: lineage B, which includes SARS-CoV and the newly emerging 2019-nCoV, has approximately 200 published virus sequences whereas lineage C, which includes MERS-CoV, has over 500 viral sequences.",

We introduced silent mutations in the codon optimized coding sequence for SARS-CoV to facilitate replacing the SARS RBD with the RBD from other lineage B viruses (figure 1b). All lineage B sequences were downloaded from online repositories and parsed to 29 unique RBD sequences, representing all published variations of the lineage B RBD (supp. fig 1a, b). The panel of 29 RBDs phylogenetically cluster into 3 clades, as previously described 5 , but these RBD clades were not apparent in phylogenetic analysis of other viral sequences, such as the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (supp. fig 1c). All 29 RBDs were codon optimized, synthesized and cloned in place of the SARS RBD, effectively generating chimeric spike expression constructs. We then generated VSV-luciferase reporter particles pseudotyped with the chimeric spikes (figure 1c). We chose VSV over lentiviruses as our pseudotype platform because a lentiviral pseudotypes have failed to accurately reflect viral entry with novel bat coronavirus spike protein 7 . All constructs exhibited similar levels of expression in producer cells and incorporation into VSV pseudotypes, except the chimera with BM48-31 which displayed somewhat reduced expression compared to WT SARS spike (figure 1d). We then infected BHK cells expressing the receptor for SARS-CoV or empty vector (figure 1e) and observed only clade 1, which includes SARS-CoV, WIV1 and SHC014, could enter cells transfected with human ACE2 (figure 1e).",
