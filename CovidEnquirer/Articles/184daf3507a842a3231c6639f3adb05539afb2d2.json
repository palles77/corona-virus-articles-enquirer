Patients with acute stroke were examined by a qualified stroke neurologist to confirm the diagnosis and the ischemic strokes were differentiated by computed tomography scans and magnetic resonance imaging. Classification of subtypes was done according to TOAST (Trial of Org 10172 in Acute Stroke Treatment) criteria. 12 Patients with hemorrhagic stroke were excluded from the study. The Institutional Ethics Committee approved this study and written informed consent was obtained from all the subjects who participated in the study. Information on demographic characteristics was collected using a standard questionnaire prepared especially for this purpose. Age matched control subjects (153) from the comparable socioeconomic background were selected for comparison. Risk factors including hypertension and diabetes were documented. Hypertension was defined according to Joint National Committee VI-VII, as a systolic blood pressure >140 mm Hg and/or a diastolic blood pressure >90 mm Hg based on the average of the 2 blood pressure measurements. Diabetes was diagnosed if fasting plasma glucose was >126 mg/dl in accordance with the American Diabetes Association. 13 Information was also collected on the number of cigarettes smoked per day and duration of smoking.

Cytokines play a role in immune response and also maintains the normal homeostatic environment of the central nervous system. IFN-\u03b3 is one of the key effector cytokines produced by NK and T cells that enhances microbicidal activity of macrophages and neutrophils. Purpose: As the association of IFN\u03b3 +874A/T gene polymorphism with stroke has not been investigated in Indian population, we wanted to evaluate the association of this polymorphism with ischemic stroke in a South Indian population. Methods: We genotyped 171 ischemic stroke patients and 153 age-matched control subjects. Results: Statistical analysis showed a significant association of TT homozygote with ischemic stroke (OR=1.9, 95% CI=1.05-3.43, p=0.03), while AA (OR= 0.84, 95% CI=0.54-1.31, p=0.46) and AT(OR=0.80, 95% CI=0.51-1.26, p=0.34) genotypes were not significantly associated. A and T allele frequencies in stroke were 58.78% and 41.22% as against 65.36% and 34.64% in control group, respectively, thus, suggesting no statistically significant differences in the A (OR=0.75, 95% CI=0.54-1.03, p=0.08) and T (OR=1.32, 95% CI=0.96-1.82, p=0.08) allele frequencies between the two groups. Conclusion: We conclude that the IFN-\u03b3 +874 TT genotype is associated with the increased risk of ischemic stroke.",

As genetic traits contribute significantly to cerebral infarction variations in the genetic regulation of inflammatory system may increase the risk of the disease from individual to individual. 1 IFN-\u03b3 has antiviral, immunoregulatory, and anti-tumor properties. 2 Atherosclerosis is an inflammatory disease, and plaque induced inflammation is considered a cause of intimal erosion and rupture and therefore leads to acute ischemia. 1,3 IFN-\u03b3 has important immunoregulatory roles and enhances both antigen specific and non-specific immune responses through actions on monocytes and macrophages. 4, 5 Complications related to infections such as chest and urinary tract infections, have been reported to occur in 23-65% of all stroke patients within the first few days after stroke. 6,7 Brain injury was identified as an independent risk factor for infectious complications in trauma patients due to a central nervous shutdown of the immune defense. 8, 9 Howard et al, reported association of immunosuppressive state with stroke. 10 IFN-\u03b3 is one of the key effector cytokines produced by NK and T cells that enhances microbicidal activity of macrophages and neutrophils.

Infectious complications in particular, bacterial pneumonia and their relevance for mortality are well known in acute stroke. The high incidence of infections in stroke patients is likely to be a result of an impaired immune function. A functional role of neutrophils in the development of strokeassociated injury remains controversial, and the contribution of specific lymphocyte subpopulations and their products to the pathogenesis of ischemic stroke are not clear. T-cell derived interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) has been shown to contribute to the injury elicited by ischemia-reperfusion in other organs 16 and IFN-\u03b3 mRNA is increased in rat brain tissue after permanent focal cerebral ischemia. 17 Activation of the SNS and the HPA by proinflammatory cytokines in systemic inflammation results in the release of glucocorticoids and catecholamines, which in- ",

Vagus nerve activation by inflammatory cytokines during endotoxemia was found to inhibit macrophage cytokine production through release of acetylcholine 18,19 and rapid activation of these pathways in inflammatory conditions protects the organism against any adverse effects of an overwhelming immune response. However, an excessive activation of inhibitory neuroendocrine pathways without systemic inflammation can inappropriately suppress the immune system and increase the risk of infections. Intrathecal release of proinflammatory cytokines is associated with signs of systemic immunodepression and a high incidence of infections in neurosurgical patients. 20 According to Konstantin et al stress mediator blockade underlines the importance of functional defects in IFN-\u03b3 production in the control of infectious complications after stroke. 21 \u03b3\u03b4 T cells are essential for pulmonary bacterial clearance and \u03b1\u03b2T cells are more critical in the peripheral blood in stroke induced infections. Inflammation is an early and rate-determining step in the microvascular dysfunction and tissue injury associated with cerebral ischemia-reperfusion (I/R) is supported by several reports that describe a reduction in brain edema and infarct size in animal models of stroke treated with antibodies that block leukocyte adhesion. 22, 23 The microvasculature of postischemic brain assumes an inflammatory phenotype that is manifested as endothelial activation and barrier dysfunction, enhanced generation of oxidants and inflammatory mediators, and the recruitment of adherent leukocytes and platelets. 24 Aspiration due to dysphagia is a known risk factor for pneumonia after severe strokes and other factors that might predispose stroke patients to pneumonia is an impaired immune responsiveness. 25,26,27.
