First-calf heifers may also have lower quality and quantity of colostrum. In beef cow-calf operations, use of pens for calving and nursing cows may lead to build up of pathogens shed by cows and their calves over the duration of the calving season, thereby exposing newborn calves to higher pathogen loads and increasing the likelihood of their developing diarrhea. The calving pen or calf housing may be a source of pathogens that persist from year to year in moist cool areas.",

            "text": "There is no one test that will detect a pathogen with 100% accuracy. Table 2 lists a summary of diarrhea pathogens, specimen, and types of tests available. Each test method has limitations; the laboratory to which the veterinarian submits samples should be able to provide this information. Case-control studies and fecal surveys have detected all enteric pathogens associated with calf diarrhea in calves that do not have diarrhea. Both host and pathogen factors influence the severity and likelihood a calf will develop diarrhea. The major host factors include the general health, nutrition, immunity to specific pathogens, and age of exposure. The major pathogen factors include the number of infectious particles, number of concurrent diseases, and virulence of the agent. For this reason, it is incumbent on the clinician to interpret the detection of pathogens in the context of the signs and clinical history. Necropsy and histopathology of good quality tissues can aid in determining the role of an agent in causing diarrhea by the detection of lesions in the tissues associated with that agent. Molecular diagnostics, most often polymerase chain reaction (PCR)-based tests, are becoming more common in diagnostic laboratories and present their own challenges in interpretation. PCR methods are usually more sensitive (w10 3 organisms/ mL) than antigen-detection methods (10 4 -10 7 organisms/mL), such as ELISA, fluorescent antibody (FA), agglutination, and chromatography (lateral flow, dipstick); and more sensitive than direct visualization (10 6 -10 7 organisms/mL), such as electron microscopy (EM), fecal flotation, or stained fecal smears. 1,2 However, PCR methods may miss viruses or bacteria that have mutated or drifted from the sequence specific to the primers in use. 1 PCR methods may detect lower levels of pathogens that may not be causing disease due to age resistance (F5 [K99] E coli) or may detect the pathogen after the signs of illness have resolved. 2 PCR methods detect pathogens even in the presence of antibody-antigen complexes. However, if the agent is bound to antibody, it is less likely to be causing disease, so detection by PCR may overestimate its significance. PCR methods may fail to detect an agent due to inhibitory substances in the sample, which is more likely to occur in fecal samples than in lung or nasal swabs. Newer methods to extract nucleic acid have overcome many of the problems posed by testing of feces for organisms such as Salmonella, making PCR as sensitive as culture. However, the sensitivity of each method may vary with the species of Salmonella found in the sample. 1,3 Dead or stressed bacteria can be detected by PCR in samples in which they might not grow in cultures. 3 Sample quality, quantity, appropriate type, storage, and transport are all important issues to be aware of when submitting samples for PCR to ensure the pathogen of interest is not denatured or destroyed. PCR methods will increase the detection of low levels of organisms that arise from cross-contamination from one calf to another when fecal samples are collected using the same instruments to open the intestinal tract or while wearing the same pair of examination gloves to collect feces from multiple animals. If the goal is simply to determine the presence of the agent in a group of animals, crosscontamination is less of a concern on the same premise than if the goal is to determine the prevalence of agents in clinically affected animals to prioritize prevention strategies. Cleaning instruments well between premises is vital to ensure agents are not detected on a premise where they do not exist due to use of contaminated instruments from another premise. EM has been used for virus detection in feces for decades. This technique requires approximately 10 6 to 10 7 particles/g or ml of feces for detection, although this level can be reduced by the use of immunoelectron microscopy. 4 Particle integrity, the likelihood to become damaged in processing or during storage so as to make it unidentifiable, or the presence of cell material that can look like the virus particle, can cause false negative or false positive results particularly for coronaviruses. 1, 4 EM, like virus isolation, has the unique ability to detect novel viruses or viruses for which there is no diagnostic assay. The drawback is that EM does not always allow the determination of the type of virus, particularly when small round viruses are detected. These viruses may have no specific visual characteristic that differentiate them from among several types of viruses in the same size range. Antigen-detection assays (ELISA, agglutination, immune-chromatography, immunohistochemistry [IHC], and FA) are based on detection of conserved antigens (often proteins) found among a heterologous agent population. Their advantage is they allow detection of a wide array of similar agents. For instance, group A rotavirus ELISA assays designed for human medicine will detect group A rotavirus in many species including calves. 2 A disadvantage is that the host or colostrum antibody binding to the antigen will inhibit detection. However, calves with antibody may not develop illness because their immune response is preventing or resolving the infection.",

Only cases in which whole calves or tissues from calves including ileum and colon were submitted were included.

This may reflect a higher mortality due to coronavirus or, possibly, a more sensitive detection method using FA on colon tissue compared with methods used on feces only (ELISA, EM). Like other studies, most calves had more than one pathogen detected. More than 95% of these animals originated from calf ranches or dairies. Fecal only submissions were excluded because coronavirus and attaching and effacing E coli could not be evaluated in those animals.

Using the human literature definitions, E coli with both Shiga toxin and eae genes are considered enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli (EHEC) and include O157:H7, which can be found in cattle as carriers and has been shown to attach and cause diarrhea in some studies. 8 E coli with the eae genes but no Shiga toxin genes are referred to as enteropathogenic Escherichia coli (EPEC). All three groups (EHEC, EPEC, and STEC) have been found in diarrhea calves with natural infections and have been used successfully to reproduce enteritis and/or colitis in some, but not all, inoculated calves. Several studies demonstrated that calves less than 24-hours old without colostral antibodies are more likely to develop diarrhea and intestinal lesions when inoculated with the organisms than are older calves or calves that have received colostrum. 8 Epidemiologic studies that are stratified by age also show as much as 10 to 12 times higher recovery of AEEC or STEC-type organisms in calves less than 30-days old with diarrhea compared with controls without diarrhea. 8 In calves over 30-days old or in reports in which calves of all ages were clustered, as well as in adult animals, there is either no difference or only an approximately twofold difference in fecal detection rates between diarrhea and nondiarrhea animals. 8, 9 Based on histologic confirmation, AEEC organisms most often cause diarrhea in calves between 2-to 21-days old with a mean age of 10 to 12 days. 8,10-12 Occasional cases have been reported in calves up to 4-months old and adults. 8,10-12 Following experimental inoculation, onset of diarrhea ranged from 1 to 4 days and lasted for 1 to 7 days. 8 In some studies, calves had onset of a mild fever (up to 40 C) between 36 hours and 4 days postinoculation that lasted 1 to 3 days.

AEEC cause a distinct histologic appearance at the attachment sites where clusters of short gram-negative rods attach and form a scalloped appearance to the epithelial cells (Fig. 2) . 8,10,12 These cells undergo damage to their microvillus surface, round up, degenerate, and slough from the lamina propria. When the small intestine is affected, villus atrophy results from loss of affected cells. Inflammation may be mild but varies with duration of the lesion. 8 On gross necropsy, the colon mucosa may be normal or have longitudinal reddening, roughening, and petechial hemorrhages (Fig. 3) . 8 Blood flecks, attached clots, or frank hemorrhage, mucus, and fibrin are also seen in some calves. 8 Occasional cases may develop a pseudomembrane in the small intestine. The gross findings are not specific to AEEC and may be seen with coronavirus and Salmonella in calves less than 30-days old. Feces can vary in color and consistency. Some calves will have watery yellow feces, whereas others may have blood in the feces, which is most common with EHEC strains. 8, 10, 12 In some calves, the feces may appear near normal, probably due to dehydration (Pat Blanchard, unpublished observation). The cecum and descending colon or rectum may have lesions when the spiral colon does not. 8 Optimal diagnostic detection is gained by histopathology of the ileum near the ileocecal junction and at least two loops of spiral colon and, when gross lesions are noted, sections of cecum and descending colon or rectum. Samples submitted for histopathology should have minimal handling to prevent removal of the affected surface epithelium. Formalin-fixed sections should be partially opened to allow entry of formalin into the lumen. Do not tie off sections placed in formalin because this slows formalin fixation of the mucosa unless the ligated tissue has been filled with formalin.",

To confirm an E coli isolated from the intestine is an attaching and effacing strain, PCR screening for the presence of the eae or toxin genes (Stx1, Stx2) is needed. A small in-house study at the authors' laboratory, found 85% of calves with moderate to large number of attaching organisms in the colon had the eae gene in 9 to 10 of 10 isolates selected from the 41 growth zone of a colon swab plated on MacConkey agar; whereas only two of four calves had the eae gene in 1 to 2 of 10 isolates and the other two had no isolates with the eae gene when rare to small number of organisms were seen attaching (Pat Blanchard, unpublished observation). These findings indicate that random selection of an E coli from the 41 growth zone of a colon mucosal swab is likely to yield an attaching and effacing strain when there are moderate to large number of organisms seen attaching histologically.",

The fimbria allows the bacteria to attach to the villus epithelial cells of the small intestine and secrete a toxin. After attaching, the heat stable toxin (STa) acts on the epithelial cells to result in marked fluid efflux into the small intestine lumen. 13 The attachment factors are most commonly expressed on immature villus epithelial cells. Therefore, normal postnatal maturation limits the disease potential of this organism to calves usually less than 6-days old. 13, 14 There may be periods of increased susceptibility after 5-days old if calves experience villus atrophy from other causes (viruses and Cryptosporidium) resulting in immature cells migrating from the crypts to cover the villus tips. 13 In one study testing only feces from calves with diarrhea, 17 of 26 animals with F5 E coli isolated had concurrent infection with Cryptosporidium, rotavirus, and/or coronavirus. 15 F5 E coli were found in all ages up to 30 days, but the authors did not indicate if the animals with F5 E coli isolated after 5-days old were the same ones with concurrent other pathogens. Unfortunately, most published prevalence studies are based on testing feces from diarrhea and nondiarrhea calves; therefore, there is no histopathology to show the organism is attaching. In Table 3 , the mean age of 2.5 days and age range of 1 to 7 days for K99 (F5) E coli is based on necropsies in which the organism was seen attaching by histopathology and confirmed by latex agglutination on feces or isolates.",

However, more often, some degree of enteritis is present histologically even in the absence of diarrhea. In some cases, the primary disease is enteric with diarrhea similar to S newport and S typhimurium. S dublin can cause diarrhea in calves as young as 5-days old but, more commonly, it occurs in calves from 1-to 4-months old. 19 A typical history is that calves show respiratory signs, diarrhea, illthrift, and have a poor response to antibiotics used for common causes of bronchopneumonia. Outbreaks can occur with high morbidity and mortality. Lesions of S dublin septicemia commonly include splenomegaly; hepatomegaly with a bronze coloration to the liver, lungs that fail to collapse on opening the chest cavity with hundreds of petechial hemorrhages; or plum-colored, wet and heavy (meaty texture) lungs involving caudal lobes; one or more cranial lobes; or all lobes (Fig. 6) . On occasion, lesions will be limited to the cranial lung but, histologically, these lesions, like the wet, heavy lung, are due to variable amounts of fibrin, some forming hyaline membranes, and interstitial pneumonia with neutrophils and histiocytes. A single plug (coagulum of fibrin and bile) may be found in the gall bladder of some calves (Fig. 7) and is pathognomonic for Salmonella septicemia. Some calves may be icteric or have petechial hemorrhages in the kidney and gastrointestinal serosa. A few calves will have meningitis or polyarthritis. A rare dry gangrene condition associated with S dublin may be seen in winter months. Dry gangrene develops in the tips of the ears, tail, and both rear legs. In the legs, a sharp line of demarcation may form across the midmetatarsus or the gangrene may be limited to the phalanges. The foot may fall off. Lesions are similar to those seen with ergot but are linked to vascular thrombosis due to S dublin. The organism can usually be isolated from the feces of some affected calves though classic septicemia lesions are not present. S dublin can be carried by healthy cows and shed sporadically in milk and feces. 20 It is possible that young calves harbor the organism in their intestine or mesenteric lymph nodes until colostral antibodies wane, allowing it to spread.",

Salmonella cultures often involve one or more enrichment steps followed by PCR, lateral-flow chromatography, or isolation on selective media. Laboratories performing nonisolation methods, such as PCR, may follow positive results with isolation by requestor this may be done routinely. False negative PCR or isolation may occur due to suppression of growth in enrichment broth by normal intestinal flora or use of antibiotics in the animal so the organism may be present in numbers too few to detect. PCR methods on intestine may be impacted by release of enzymes from other bacteria that damage the nucleic acid of Salmonella sp making them undetectable. 1 Rapid, accurate detection methods continue to be developed and improved, primarily driven by the food industry. However, veterinary diagnostics will benefit from spinoff use of some of this technology to provide cost-effective, sensitive, and rapid detection of Salmonella. Fig. 6 .

These include fomites on clothes, footwear, equipment, or feeding supplies (bottles, buckets, esophageal tubes-Salmonella can be found in saliva); as well as, water, colostrum, milk, conveyances (carts to remove dead calves and move newborn calves to hutches), wash water used in pens and under hutches, sprinklers, weigh scales, maternity pens, and sick cows. 20 Studies have shown increased fecal shedding in calves that did not receive antibiotic supplemented milk replacer, 17,19 on dairies where the maternity pen is used as a hospital pen, 19 when prophylactic antibiotics were given to newborn calves, and when the herd was not closed. 17 Reduced shedding and resistance to disease is seen with increasing age. 17, 20 CRYPTOSPORIDIUM Cryptosporidium parvum, C bovis (formerly bovine B genotype), 21 C ryanae (formerly deer-like genotype), 22 and C andersoni have all been reported in calves. 23, 24 Oocysts from C bovis and C parvum are indistinguishable based on size. 21 C ryanae oocysts are slightly smaller 22 and C andersoni are larger; the latter are primarily associated with subclinical disease from abomasal colonization in animals greater than 3-months old, usually adults. In a multistate study in the United States, C parvum was the primary species (w90% of Cryptosporidium) colonizing calves up to 4-weeks old and the only species found in calves less than 3-weeks old. 23 The peak prevalence of calves shedding Cryptosporidium was 66.7% at 2-weeks old when only C parvum was seen. C parvum only accounted for 1% of the Cryptosporidium found after weaning. C bovis and C ryanae were the most common types seen postweaning with peak postweaning shedding prevalence of 30% at 6-months old. The predominant species varies by region. C bovis was the most common type at all ages in Sweden where C parvum was only found in calves before weaning with 73% of C parvum-infected calves less than 2-weeks old. 24 Some reports in the literature show no statistical difference in shedding of Cryptosporidium between diarrhea and age-matched control calves; others report over 90% of calves shed the organism in the preweaning period. 6, 25 Several surveys have found Cryptosporidium was the most common or second-most common pathogen in the feces of diarrhea calves. The authors' laboratory (see Table 3 ) and most surveys report over 35% of diarrheic calves less than 30-days old shedding this agent. 5 Cryptosporidium has been associated with mixed infections; and a peak shedding prevalence at 7 to 14 days (53%-95%), both of which decline with increasing age. 6, 26, 27 Earlier surveillance studies did not determine the species of Cryptosporidium and often included calves older than 30-days old, which may explain the lack of correlation between shedding and diarrhea because some of the older calves may have been infected with C bovis.",

In severe cases, the organism can be found in crypts in the colon accompanied by neutrophils. When the organism affects the colon it can lead to blood in the feces but this does not occur when found in the small intestine alone. The prepatent period for C parvum is 3 to 4 days, though first shedding is more often detected at 6-to 7-days old and can last 4 to 18 days. Most affected calves are 6-to 25-days old. C bovis has been identified in feces of calves as young as 7 days 24 and C ryanae at 11-to 12-days old. 21, 24 These two species are most often associated with subclinical infection. 21, 22, 24 Antigen detection methods, such as ELISA and chromatographic methods, probably detect all species of Cryptosporidium (A. Broes, personal communication, 2012) and FA have been shown to detect all species. 23 Visualization of oocysts via fecal flotation, direct examination, and acid-fast stains also will not distinguish C parvum, C bovis, and, to a lesser extent, C ryanae because they are all approximately the same size. PCR methods with 18S ribosomal RNA sequencing have been used to distinguish the four species of Cryptosporidium and subtypes of C parvum that are associated with human infection. 24 PCR methods can detect lower number of organisms (as low as 50-100/g but, more consistently, 250 oocysts/g) 24 than antigen detection (FA, ELISA, chromatography) and fecal flotation or acid-fast stained direct smears, which have detection limits ranging from 10 3 to 10 6 oocysts/g of feces. The lower limits are more often associated with concentration of oocysts before detection. Quantitation of the organism by direct examination, including acid-fast stains and flotation may be misleading because low numbers may reflect the stage of infection (early or late) instead of the severity. However, one study found calves shedding more than 2.2 \u00c2 10 5 oocysts/g of feces had a 6.1 times greater likelihood of having diarrhea than calves shedding lower numbers of organisms. 27 Cryptosporidium are remarkably resistant to disinfectants, making them hard to kill and no effective therapeutics have been found. Five percent ammonia, 6% hydrogen peroxide, and 10% formalin are reported to kill the organism 20 ; however, none of these are practical to use on farms. Increasing environmental temperatures from 4 C to 20 C 28,29 and the resultant higher temperatures found in fecal pats, which exceed 40 C, resulted in rapid inactivation of oocysts. 30 Likewise, reduced temperatures below \u00c022 C also resulted in inactivation of oocysts. 28 Atwill and colleagues 25 found the organism could still be detected in scrapings from the walls and floor of wooden calf hutches after cleaning.",

This organism has also been found on the inside of the nipple of bottles used to feed calves (ER Atwill, personal communication, 2007) . This latter finding would justify keeping separate feeding supplies for calves less than 5-days old from those used for older calves to decrease exposure among young calves. The older the calf is at the time of exposure, the milder their infection will be in general. Dry, clean individual calf housing away from cows and free of moisture with good drainage can decrease exposure to Cryptosporidium. Exposure of the organism to summer heat and winter cold should decrease the environmental burden of organisms on a farm.",

Therefore, it is imperative to obtain content from the colon or rectum for parasite testing on necropsy cases because the small intestine content will not contain oocysts.

Athanassious and colleagues 4 demonstrated 95% to 96% agreement between rotavirus and coronavirus ELISA and EM methods in diarrhea calves. In their study, fecal samples were collected within 5 to 6 hours after onset of clinical signs and intestinal tissues within 2 days of onset and all samples were frozen at \u00c070 C until tested. Kapil and colleagues 40 reported a marked drop in virus shedding in calves 3-days postinfection with coronavirus.

For coronavirus, comparing FA and IHC to direct EM was reported to have a relative sensitivity of 63% to 80% 38, 42 and 83%, 42 respectively. For coronavirus, the spiral colon is a more reliable site for FA because the infected cells are retained in the crypts, less susceptible to postmortem loss, and have been reported to persist in the colon longest. 40 Extensive FA positive staining may occur in the spiral colon in early infections because diarrhea onset precedes necrosis of colon cells. Later stage infections, when only rare necrotic crypts surrounded by fibrous tissue are present, will occasionally have focal positive staining. Detection of coronavirus by FA on frozen colon tissue has a good correlation with the presence of colon lesions by histopathology (Pat Blanchard, personal observation).",

Immunoelectron microscopy eliminates the false positive results but is rarely performed in most diagnostic laboratories. PAGE patterns of rotavirus isolates will allow determination of the group present. 41 Colostral antibodies help protect against infection following vaccination of dry cows. Oral vaccines with attenuated viruses are available for use in newborn calves. In some cases, the use of both dry cow vaccine and oral calf vaccine seems to negate the positive effect of either alone because the oral vaccine virus binds to colostral antibody, reducing the antibody available for absorption or the virus available for local immunity stimulation.",

Sarcina forms packets of 8 to 16 cocci detectable by histopathology in the abomasal lumen and sometimes the wall of affected calves. 45 Studies with this organism alone or in combination with C perfringens failed to reproduce the bloat condition (Ken Mills, PhD, Laramie, WY, personal communication, 2006). The appearance of the organism in the abomasum on histopathology is associated with bloat and has not been found in calves (Pat Blanchard, unpublished observation) or goats 46 that die from other causes. Affected calves are less than 30-days old and receive some type of milk product including whole milk or milk replacers and may even be nursing cows on pasture. Esophageal intubation is not effective in relieving the bloat because the tube does not reach the abomasum. Using a large-bore needle inserted in the right flank may relieve the gas.
