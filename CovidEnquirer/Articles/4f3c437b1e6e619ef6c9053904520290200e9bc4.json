            "text": "Nervous necrosis virus (NNV) is a ubiquitous pathogen in the aquaculture worldwide. Little is known about the relationship between NNV virus and host cells. Our studies showed that RGNNV infection could induce cell cycle arrest via activation of p53 signaling in cultured host cells. Infection of RGNNV redistributed NPM1, stabilized p53 and inhibited cell proliferation by inducing G1 arrest. RGNNV infection also led to phosphorylation and accumulation of p53 in a time-dependent manner. Furthermore, RGNNV infection upregulated cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1 A (p21) and downregulated cyclin E and cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2). The expression of genes in the p53 pathway did not change significantly after p53 knockdown by pifithrin-\u03b1 during RGNNV infection. However, NPM1 knockdown could abrogate RGNNV-induced cell proliferation inhibition, activation of p53 signaling and cell cycle arrest. In addition, RGNNV infection of the cells synchronized in various stages of cell cycle showed that viral genomic RNA and virus titer were higher in the cells released from G1 phase-or S phase-synchronized cells than that in the cells released from the G2 phase-synchronized or asynchronous cells after 18 h p.i. Therefore, our study reveals that RGNNV infection induces the p53-dependent pathway, resulting in a cell cycle arrest at G1 phase in host cells, which might provide a favorable condition for viral replication.",

However, the molecular mechanisms of NNV infection remain poorly understood. The NNV genome is composed of two positive single-stranded RNAs (RNA1 and RNA2) that lack poly-A tails. RNA1 encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), and RNA2 encodes the capsid protein (Tan et al., 2001) . A subgenome of RNA1, named RNA3, encodes the B1 and B2 proteins (Sommerset and Nerland, 2004) . The B1 protein counteracts necrotic cell death by reducing mitochondrial membrane potential (MMP) loss, which in turn enhances cell viability (Chen et al., 2009 ). The B2 protein binds to newly synthesized viral double-stranded RNA, thereby preventing host RNA interference-mediated cleavage, and during the late stages of infection, can induce mitochondria-mediated cell death (Fenner et al., 2006; Su et al., 2014) .",

These cell-cycle regulatory molecules have been found to be regulated by some upstream pathways such as p53 signaling. The protein p53 is stabilized and activated when a cell is exposed to stress conditions, i.e. genotoxic conditions, nucleolar stress and/or viral infection, which leads to cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, DNA repair or senescence (El-Deiry, 1998) . p53 signaling can regulate the expression of p21, which directly bind to some cdk-cyclin complexes to inhibit their kinases activity (He et al., 2005) .",

Moreover, NPM1 participates in a variety of cellular activities including cell proliferation, cytoplasmic/nuclear shuttle transportation, transcriptional regulation and molecular chaperoning (Balusu et al., 2015) . Recent studies have also highlighted that NPM1 has additional nonclassical roles, such as involvement in cell cycle regulation, cellular stress responses, and viral replication (Taoe et al., 2006) . Most interestingly, NPM1 has been shown to shuttle molecules between the nucleolus and the cytoplasm, acting as a carrier protein for cell cycle-related protein p120, nucleolin, tumor suppressor ARF, p53, as well as several viral proteins such as the core protein of Hepatitis C virus, replication proteins of Adeno-associated virus and matrix protein of Newcastle disease virus (Mai et al., 2006; Bevington et al., 2007; Duan et al., 2014; Box et al., 2016) . More specifically, several nucleolar proteins, including NPM1, nucleostemin and L5, interact with MDM2/p53 under stress conditions to inhibit its activity and stabilize p53 (Zhang and Lu, 2009) . Furthermore, NPM1 has been shown to interact with HDM2, p53, and ARF, and can exert either a positive or negative influence on cellular growth by regulating the activities of these proteins (Tollini et al., 2011; Box et al., 2016) .",

Thus, we hypothesized that RGNNV may induce nucleolar/ribosomal stress via NPM1. To test this hypothesis, we first confirmed that the GS cells had been effectively infected with RGNNV (Fig. 1A) , after which the infection of RGNNV in GS cells was examined by RT-PCR (Fig. 1B , panel a) and Western blotting ( Fig. 1B panel b) . We could then investigate the expression levels of NPM1 and p53 in response to RGNNV infection. As shown in Fig. 1C , NPM1 was significantly upregulated in RGNNV-infected cells in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1C, left panel) . The expression of p53 also increased in these cells (Fig. 1C, middle) . Fluorouracil (5-FU), which was used as a positive control, also induced NPM1 and p53 expression in a time-dependent manner (Fig. 1C , right panel). This chemotherapeutic agent inhibits ribosome biogenesis and triggers nucleolar/ribosomal stress, which subsequently leads to p53 activation and cell growth arrest (Ghoshal and Jacob, 1994) .",

The growth of cells infected with RGNNV was significantly inhibited in comparison to that of cells mock-infected. These results suggest that infection of RGNNV suppress cell proliferation. To confirm the inhibitory effect of RGNNV on cell proliferation, we performed MTS and colony formation assays in GS cells. As shown in both Fig. 2B and C, Total RNA was isolated for RT-PCR analysis using specific primers for RGNNV capsid gene (left panel), and protein expression was determined by Western blotting with an anti-capsid antibody (K233) (right panel).

However, the RGNNV-infected cells that had been treated with NPM1 siRNA displayed only weak accumulation of endogenous p53 and its phosphorylation. Moreover, knockdown of endogenous NPM1 in the RGNNV-infected cells also decreased p21 and MDM2 levels then increased cyclin E and CDK2. In addition, the level of RGNNV capsid level was lower in the NPM1-knockdowned cells than those in the control cells and RGNNV-infected cells (Fig. 6F) . Taken together, these results indicate that the depletion of NPM1 dramatically decreased p53 activation and G1 arrest in cells with RGNNV infection which might affect viral replication.",

Perturbations in nucleolar organization and/or function caused by viruses lead to reduced apoptosis, enhanced cell cycle progression and immune evasion. This allows viruses to hijack the host machinery to complete their life cycles (Hiscox, 2002) . Furthermore, RNA viruses, whose primary site of replication is normally the cytoplasm, have also been characterized by cell cycle arrest of infected cells. Cell cycle manipulation is crucial event occurred in viruses-infected cells and many viruses employ a variety of mechanisms to utilize or manipulate the cell cycle pathways of infected cells (Davy and Doorbar, 2007; He et al., 2010) . p53 is a key element in the induction of cell cycle arrest in viruses infected cells (Casavant et al., 2006) . Some viruses interfere with the p53 surveillance pathways to promote replication (Rohaly et al., 2010; Luo et al., 2011) , other viruses exhibited a p53-independent way for its replication (Dahl et al., 2005; Kucharski et al., 2011) . The first transcriptional target of p53 was p21, which bridges the function of p53 with the cell cycle and plays important roles in regulation of cell cycle progression or arrest (He et al., 2005) . In this study, we focused on whether the p53 signaling pathway contributes to RGNNV induced cell cycle progression and virus replication. Our studies have demonstrated that RGNNV infection induced the activation of p53 signaling pathway to up-regulate p21 and down-regulate cyclin E and CDK2, forcing the infected cells to stay in the replicative G1/S phase.",

We found that the infection of RGNNV in the GS cell line induced nucleolar/ribosomal stress, inhibited cell proliferation and induced cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase. To specifically investigate whether a particular stage of the cell cycle favored RGNNV replication, we synchronized cells in various stages of the cell cycle and compared efficiencies of virus infection. Results showed that RGNNV replication levels, sgRNA synthesis were greater in the cells released from G1 phase or S phase of the cell cycle after 18 h p.i., when compared to either cells released from the G2 phase or asynchronous cells. Our results also provided evidences that RGNNV titer in the cells released from G1 phase or S phase synchronized cells was higher than that in cells released from G2/M phase synchronized cells. This might be that cells synchronized at G2/M phase need longer time to reenter cell cycle progression than synchronized cells at the G1 or S phase, which support the hypothesis that S phase state was beneficial for virus replication. Therefore, we favor the hypothesis that RGNNV induces G1 phase cell cycle arrest in order to provide a more favorable condition for virus production.",

            "text": "The p53 signaling pathway plays an important role in the induction of cell cycle arrest in virus infected cells (Casavant et al., 2006) . Viruses activate or interfere with the p53 signaling pathway at different levels to achieve proliferation. As a DNA damage response protein, p53 transcriptionally activates numerous genes involved in DNA repair and cell cycle arrest (Malunber and Barbacid, 2009), and p53-dependent arrest of cells at G1/S or G2/M phase is an important component of the cellular response to genotoxic stress including virus infection (Casavant et al., 2006; Luo et al., 2011) . The reported researches are beneficial to a deep-going understanding to the activation of p53 signaling pathway by RGNNV. Our observations were consistent with those in a previous report (Laptenko and Prives, 2006) , which suggested that activation of p53 causes accumulation of p21, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor, and eventual induction of downstream target genes such as cyclin E and CDK2. Both p21 and p53 cause cell cycle arrest at the G1 checkpoint, which promotes DNA repair by allowing sufficient time for damaged DNA to be repaired before it is passed to daughter cells (He et al., 2005; Rohaly et al., 2010) . The main target of p21 is the cyclin E-CDK2 complex, in addition to the cyclin D-CDK4/6 complex (Roberts and Sherr, 2003) . The Cyclin E-CDK2 complex is inhibited by p21 during the progression from G1 to S phase (M\u00f6r\u00f6y and Geisen, 2004) . Cells regulate the p53 pathway, which controls the cell cycle, in order to maintain their stability and modulate their differentiation (Vogelstein et al., 2000) . Researchers are investigating the infection strategies that facilitate viral proliferation by manipulating the cell cycle. It is possible that G1/S phase arrest may aid viral replication through an increase in critical cellular materials (nucleotide, amino acid, or lipid) (Baer et al., 2012) . In this study, we showed that RGNNV infection induced p53 and p21 accumulation, phosphorylation of p53 (Ser15) and cyclin E-CDK2 decrease. Furthermore, PFT-\u03b1, a specific inhibitor of p53, prevented the arrest of the cell cycle in RGNNV-infected cells. Thus, infection with RGNNV activated p53, resulting in upregulation of p21, inhibition of cyclin E-CDK2, and, ultimately, cell cycle arrest, which could facilitate virus gene replication. This observation is not consistent with the findings in other RNA virus, which induced cell cycle arrest at both S and G2/M phases independent of p53 (Li et al., 2007) , suggesting that p53 might play different roles in RNA viruses-infected cells.",

However, the physiological function of this evolutionarily conserved protein in RGNNV infection remains obscure. In the current study, we showed that NPM1 is mainly localized to the nucleolus, but that some can also exist in the nucleus and cytoplasm. NPM1 expression was induced when cells were infected with RGNNV. Interestingly, the knockdown of endogenous NPM1 abrogated RGNNV-induced G1 arrest and cell proliferation inhibition via a p53-dependent pathway. Several proteins that impact cell survival by interacting with, and regulating, NPM1 protein levels have been identified. After various stimuli, NPM1 releases ARF, which allows binding to MDM2 and the prevention of proteasomal degradation of p53. These observations provide evidence that NPM1 regulates cell fate in a p53-dependent manner by directing ARF to the nucleolus and preventing inhibition of MDM2 (Korgaonkar et al., 2005; Qin et al., 2011) . Other studies have also linked NPM1 with the tumor suppressor activity of p53. For example, NPM1 is able to interact directly with MDM2, independently of ARF, to inhibit p53/MDM2 and protect p53 from degradation (Kurki et al., 2004) . Moreover, NPM1 has also been reported to directly associate with p53 for p53 stabilization and activation (Lambert and Buckle, 2006; Russo and Russo, 2017) . We observed that NPM1 and p53 levels increased following the ribosomal stress caused by RGNNV infection. This observation led us to hypothesize that NPM1 can respond to ribosomal stress and regulate cell proliferation. However, the exact mechanism through which NPM1 exerts this function remains unclear. Earlier research in cells exposed to ionizing radiation and polyamine depletion has shown that NPM1 may function as a negative regulator for the p53/MDM2 interaction, which would lead to the stabilization of p53 (Zou et al., 2005) . NPM1 may also function similarly to the molecular chaperone Hsp90 (Muller et al., 2004) , which prevent self-aggregation and degradation, facilitate protein complex formation and/or monitors trafficking and correct cellular localization.",

Furthermore, our study also shows that NPM1 might is a new regulator of the p53 pathway potentially in response to RGNNV infection. Our finding that RGNNV has the potential to suppress host cell growth in a p53-dependent manner has important implications for NNV pathogenesis studies. However, a detailed mechanism of how RGNNV, along with factors that mediate regulatory pathways, induces cell cycle arrest at the G1 phase is not yet completely available, and should be clarified by future research.",
