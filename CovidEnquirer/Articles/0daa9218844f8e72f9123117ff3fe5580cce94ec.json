They also found MRI to be more sensitive, with abnormal findings in 88% of patients whilst CT was found to be abnormal in 45%. Three types of radiological lesions were seen: bilateral cerebral oedema, ischaemic strokes and one case of haematomas [5] . This would suggest-as was the case with our patient-MRI is more sensitive than CT scanning.",
