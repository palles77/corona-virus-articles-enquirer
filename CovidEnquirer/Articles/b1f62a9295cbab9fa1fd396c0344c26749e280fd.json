WHO estimates that 3 million people with tuberculosis are \"missed\" each year by health systems, leading to the persistence of infectious cases and the airborne disease's transmission within families and communities. 1 Transmission of tuberculosis leads to new infections and new cases of disease. If the global tuberculosis epidemic is to be stopped, not only must existing cases be treated, but the transmission that is constantly producing new infections and cases must also be halted.

In low-incidence, high-resource settings such as the USA, Canada, and the European Union, policies of targeted active case-fi nding are in place to limit transmission of tuberculosis in households, communities, and congregate settings. [3] [4] [5] Targeted active case-fi nding means actively seeking out and screening individuals at increased risk of having the disease so that they can be diagnosed early, and, through correct treatment, rendered non-infectious. Targeted active case-fi nding is a fundamental strategy for disease control that has been used to stop epidemics ranging from smallpox to severe acute respiratory syndrome to Ebola virus disease, and has been recognised as a crucial component of the epidemic-control response to tuberculosis since the 1930s. [6] [7] [8] By contrast, most tuberculosis programmes in lowincome and middle-income countries with high burdens of tuberculosis have adopted policies that rely on passive case-fi nding-waiting for the sick to seek care if they are able. Driven in large part by concerns over cost, this strategy prioritises treatment success among passively detected cases and considers case detection to be of secondary importance. 9-11 However, by the time sick individuals seek treatment for their symptoms, they have been infectious for some time, and transmission in the family and community has already occurred. 12, 13 \u2022 Stopping transmission is an essential component of halting the global tuberculosis epidemic; this requires fi nding individuals with tuberculosis and promptly initiating the correct treatment \u2022 Actively searching for tuberculosis cases in high-risk groups is an effi cient and eff ective way to improve tuberculosis case detection \u2022 Initiation of eff ective treatment rapidly renders patients non-infectious \u2022 The effi cacy of strategies to actively fi nd cases and ensure prompt eff ective treatment has been shown in high tuberculosis-burden settings \u2022 The ability of targeted active case-fi nding and prompt treatment to reduce tuberculosis incidence in the population has been suggested by both empirical evaluations and mathematical modelling \u2022 By applying existing knowledge comprehensively and exhaustively to stop the production of new infections and new cases, we can make a substantial impact on the tuberculosis epidemic",

The second step is to ensure that individuals with tuberculosis are rapidly diagnosed and put on an eff ective treatment regimen. Delays in diagnosis and treatment contribute to persisting transmission of tuberculosis. 12,13 Diagnostic and treatment policies in high tuberculosis-burden countries have largely relied on conventional sputum smear microscopy as the main diagnostic technique and on a standard empirical treatment regimen of four fi rst-line anti-tuberculosis drugs. 14 However, sputum smear microscopy has severe limitations: it fails to detect about half of all tuberculosis cases; 15 its sensitivity in children sick with tuberculosis is about 10%; 15 its sensitivity in people living with HIV who are sick with tuberculosis is less than 30%; 16, 17 it cannot diagnose patients with extrapulmonary tuberculosis, who represented 15% of notifi ed cases in 2013; 1 and it cannot detect drug resistance. Furthermore, although cases that are detectable by sputum smear microscopy are generally more infectious than those that are not, the nondetectable cases have been shown to cause 13-17% of transmission in low-incidence settings. 18, 19 Reliance on smear micro scopy rather than more sensitive procedures for diagnosis thus allows infectious cases to remain undetected in the community for longer. In addition, policies that rely on both sputum smear microscopy and empirical treatment with a standard fi rst-line antituberculosis regimen can result in long periods of ineff ective treatment for patients with drug-resistant tuberculosis.",

A seminal prospective, randomised, controlled study 32 done at the Tuberculosis Chemotherapy Center, Madras (now Chennai), India, in the 1950s reported that household members of patients with tuberculosis who were treated at home had no greater risk of tuberculosis disease or infection after 5 years than household members of patients who were treated in sanatoria and thus restricted from contact with their families. Furthermore, since the 1950s, independent studies have measured the infectiousness of patients with tuberculosis who were being treated in hospital using an experimental model in which highly susceptible guineapigs were exposed to the air from a ward of patients with tuberculosis, and then tested for tuberculosis infection. These experiments repeatedly showed a rapid reduction in the patients' infectiousness after initiation of eff ective therapy, even while they might remain sputum smear positive. [33] [34] [35] In the earliest experiments, patients began treatment on the day of admission to the hospital; guineapigs exposed to patients who started eff ective treatment for drug-susceptible tuberculosis were only 2% as likely to be infected as guineapigs exposed to untreated patients, suggesting that the patients were rendered non-infec tious almost immediately after initiation of multidrug therapy. 33 In later studies using a similar experimental set-up, rapid attenuation of infectiousness was reported for patients with drugresistant tuberculosis who were treated eff ectively with regimens that contained suffi cient drugs to which the infecting strains were susceptible. 34 By contrast, these guineapig exposure studies have repeatedly reported most infections to be associated with patients who have undiagnosed or ineff ectively treated drug-resistant tuberculosis, under scoring the importance of rapid initiation of the correct regimen and the danger of protracted infectiousness in these patients. [33] [34] [35] [36] Epidemiologically, the continuing transmission of drugresistant strains that results from diagnostic failure or an absence of eff ective treatment is suggested by the prevalence of drug resistance in patients who have never",

Although the eff ect of these activities at a population level is diffi cult to measure over a short timeframe, evidence suggests that they have a role in reducing tuberculosis incidence. In a com munityrandomised trial in Brazil, eight com munities matched according to socioeconomic indicators were assigned to either an intervention or control condition. In the intervention communities, outreach workers actively sought out household contacts of tuberculosis cases for prompt screening, and treatment was given for both tuberculosis disease and infection. 37 The control communities received the local standard of care, which relied on contacts to present to health facilities for assessment, and did not routinely provide preventive therapy. At baseline, the two sets of communities had nearly identical annual tuberculosis case notifi cation rates (340 cases per 100 000 individuals in communities receiving the intervention and 339 per 100 000 in the controls). After 5 years, the intervention communities had a statistically signifi cant 15% lower annual tuber culosis case notifi cation rate than the control com munities (p=0\u00b704). A community-randomised trial in Zambia and South Africa allocated 24 communities to four intervention conditions involving diff erent com binations of casefi nding interventions such that each group was similar with respect to baseline prevalence of tuberculosis and HIV infection, and demographic characteristics. 38 After 3 years, communities in which household contacts of patients with tuberculosis were systematically assessed had an 18% lower prevalence of tuberculosis in adults (p=0\u00b7095) and a 55% lower rate of tuberculosis infection in children (p=0\u00b7063) than communities in which household contacts were not assessed.",

Common components of contact investigations include patient interviews in the clinic, asking patients to bring household members and other close contacts (particularly children) to the clinic for assessment, and home visits by a health-care worker to identify and screen household members. Although programmes generally prioritise the most infectious cases for contact investigation, investi gations of children, who generally have non-infectious forms of tuberculosis, can lead to detection of infectious adult cases; this is sometimes called a source case investigation since transmission is assumed to have occurred from the adult to the child. At a children's hospital in Texas, USA, 17-24% of children diagnosed with tuberculosis were accompanied to the hospital by an adult with previously undiagnosed pulmonary tuber culosis. 40, 41 Another generally applicable strategy for targeted active case-fi nding is regular screening of social or demographic risk groups that contribute a disproportionate number of cases to the local tuberculosis burden (panel). This strategy is important in both low-burden settings and high-burden settings. Analysis of routinely collected programme data can help identify high-risk groups in a particular location. Furthermore, in some high-burden settings, analysis of programme data can identify geographical hotspots where community-level interventions such as door-to-door screening and deployment of mobile diagnostic units could be a high-yield activity (see Theron and colleagues, 46 paper 1 in this Series). In countries where genotyping is practised, such as China, the combination of genotype and geographical data might allow even more specifi c identifi cation of transmission hotspots.",

            "text": "One practical consideration for the implementation of targeted active case-fi nding activities is how to convince individuals to undergo screening for a stigmatised disease, especially if screening requires time and eff ort on the part of the individual. Strategies that have proven successful at encouraging uptake of services for other stigmatised health issues (eg, HIV, leprosy) have included coupling services for a stigmatised health issue with services for a non-stigmatised one, and communitybased awareness campaigns to reduce stigma. 47 Several successful active case-fi nding initiatives for tuberculosis have incorporated advocacy and community mobilisation activities into their strategies. 20 Material incentives can also be useful in encouraging people to undergo screening; two randomised controlled trials in the USA reported that small monetary incentives doubled the proportion of homeless people who returned to the clinic to have their tuberculin skin tests read. 48 Another practical consideration is what screening and diagnostic algorithm to use. Strategies for targeted active case-fi nding typically use screening algorithms that progressively reduce the number of individuals at each step of assessment to ensure that time-intensive and resource-intensive procedures such as sputum culture and full clinical assessment by a physician are done for indivi duals who are likely to have tuberculosis. A common fi rst step is to ask individuals about symptoms and risk factors, and move only those who are symptomatic or high risk to the next step of assessment. However, the choice of symptoms included in the initial interview can greatly aff ect the performance of the symptom screen, with tradeoff s between sensitivity and specifi city. In a prevalence survey in western Kenya, 49 where the prevalence of bacteriologically confi rmed pulmonary tuberculosis was 0\u00b76%, the presence of cough for 2 weeks or longer had 52% sensitivity and 89% specifi city in predicting tuberculosis, whereas the presence of any tuberculosis symptom (cough, haemoptysis, weight loss, fever, or night sweats) had 90% sensitivity and 32% specifi city. Furthermore, for children, additional symptoms such as reduced playfulness and failure to reach an ageappropriate weight are important components of a symptom screen. Finally, the comparatively high sensitivity (94%) and specifi city (73%) of an abnormal chest radiograph for predicting tuberculosis in the western Kenya survey 49 (with similar results reported from other prevalence surveys) strongly supports inclusion of chest radiography into screening algorithms.",

Active case-fi nding activities require staff and diagnostic resources in addition to those already in place to support passive case-fi nding. Additionally, if active case-fi nding activities are successful, the number of patients requiring treatment will increase in the short term, even though subsequent reduction in transmission should reduce the number of cases in the long term. Therefore, anticipation of increased diagnostic and treatment capacity should be part of the planning process for any active case-fi nding activity. Furthermore, monitoring and assessment should be planned to ensure that the people screened by an active case-fi nding initiative are those at the highest risk rather than those who are easiest to reach, and that increases in diagnoses represent true case detection and not overdiagnosis. Finally, while active case-fi nding activities have as their main goal the prompt diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis disease, they can also provide a platform for the diagnosis and treatment of tuberculosis infection and exposure to prevent development of future cases (see Rangaka and colleagues, 50 paper 3 in this Series).

Facilities where individuals who are sick spend hours waiting for health care in crowded and poorly ventilated waiting areas can promote transmission within the facility. Detection of these cases as soon as possible is thus crucial to prevent transmission. One strategy to identify cases and prevent nosocomial transmission is to screen individuals in waiting areas for tuberculosis symptoms and quickly separate symptomatic individuals from the general population. This type of rapid triage was instrumental in halting nosocomial transmission during the 2003 outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome in Asia. 7 For tuberculosis, the strategy \"Finding TB cases Actively, Separating safely, and Treating eff ectively\" (FAST) has helped facilities introduce procedures that reduce the risk and duration of exposure to tuberculosis for both patients and health-care workers. 51 The FAST strategy includes cough monitoring in waiting rooms and admission wards to identify individuals who might have tuberculosis, rapid diagnosis for those with tuberculosis symptoms, prompt separation of patients with suspected drug-resistant tuberculosis, and rapid initiation of eff ective treatment for all forms of tuberculosis. Although designed for health-care facilities, the FAST strategy could be adapted to other congregate settings as well. 52 Additionally, a range of administrative and environmental interventions can further augment eff orts to prevent transmission within facilities, without substantial additional resource investment (table 3) .",

Technologies under development at present include antigen detection tests and tests to analyse volatile organic compounds in breath or urine. 58 Failure to suspect or identify drug resistance at the time of tuberculosis diagnosis can result in patients receiving inadequate treatment regimens, which prolongs both illness and infectiousness and potentially causes amplifi cation of drug resistance. 59, 60 Patients can deteriorate and remain infectious for months in places where policies allow treatment for drug-resistant tuberculosis to be considered only after a patient has been unsuccessfully treated with a fi rst-line regimen. Therefore, use of new molecular diagnostic tests to rapidly diagnose drug resistance and presumptive treat ment for drug-resistant tuberculosis are both integral to stopping transmission of drug-resistant strains. Molecular diagnostic tests can detect drug resistance in hours or days rather than the weeks needed for conventional culture-based drug susceptibility testing. In settings with high prevalence of drug resistance, such as Russia, Peru, and various southern African settings, universal drug susceptibility testing using molecular tests has been shown to be feasible, reducing the time to diagnosis of drug resistance and initiation of second-line treatment. 51, 61, 62 In settings with low rates of drug resistance in the general tuberculosis patient population, rapid molecular testing of people suspected of having tuberculosis or patients meeting certain criteria for being at an increased risk of drug resistance (eg, contacts of an individual with drug-resistant tuberculosis, individuals with a history of tuberculosis treatment, patients not responding to treatment, and refugees) has proven to be a feasible intermediate step toward universal drug susceptibility testing.",

Thus, not only is the method of diagnosis important to consider, but also the timeliness and ease with which patients receive diagnostic results and are linked to care. High rates of failure to initiate treatment after diagnosis have been reported in a range of settings. 64 Sometimes, gaps in the health-care delivery system can lead to a failure to communicate test results or an absence of action based on these results. 65, 66 In KwaZulu-Natal, South Africa, only 20% of patients with rifampicin-resistant tuberculosis had started tuberculosis treatment within 2 weeks of testing using the Xpert MTB/RIF assay, which yields results within hours. 67 In other situations, patients themselves might decline treatment despite receiving a diagnosis of tuberculosis, particularly if they have no or mild symptoms or if treatment interferes with their ability to work. Nearly a quarter of patients diagnosed with sputum smear-positive tuberculosis during a community survey in India did not initiate treatment, with the two most common reasons being lack of interest in treatment and having symptoms too mild to warrant treatment. 68 Therefore, strategies are needed to ensure that all individuals diagnosed with tuberculosis are informed of their diagnoses, counselled appropriately, and promptly treated. Strategies could include the collection of accurate contact information during the initial diagnostic encounter, optimisation of diagnostic procedures and communication systems to reduce time to diagnosis and treatment, active follow-up of people who do not initiate treatment, incentives for initiation of treatment, and oversight and support for individuals requiring it during treatment. In some countries, regulations exist that allow a tuberculosis programme to compel a patient to accept treatment despite his or her refusal; the decision about how to balance the rights of a patient with the public health system's mandate to protect the public is complex and warrants careful consideration. 69",

For example, engagement of community members who advocate for best practices, encourage health-care-seeking behaviours, and support patients through treatment can help ensure that interventions initiated by the tuberculosis programme have wide-reaching and sustained eff ect. Additionally, partnerships with other government sectors, such as those in charge of prisons or social welfare programmes, can ease access to vulnerable or hard-to-reach populations. Finally, partnerships with the private sector are necessary in settings such as south Asia, where 80% of patients seek care from private providers. 75 In view of the large number and the heterogeneity of private providers, it is an immense undertaking for national tuberculosis programmes to eff ectively engage these providers to ensure that patients with tuberculosis receive timely diagnoses and appropriate treatment, and that all tuberculosis cases are reported to the national tuberculosis programme even if they are diagnosed and treated in the private sector. Although strategies will vary across settings, some approaches that have proven successful include use of large private hospitals with associated clinic networks as reporting centres for the national tuberculosis programme; use of mobile phone-based platforms to help report screening or diagnostic results from private facilities; and mass media campaigns that give publicity to private facilities that have partnered with the national programme to off er testing and treatment. 29, 75 Projection of impact What impact would be expected from a commitment to identify and treat more people with tuberculosis than is achieved at present? Models consistent with the present tuberculosis epidemics in China, India, and South Africa predict that an increase in case detection by 25% can achieve a 40-44% reduction in tuberculosis-associated mortality, a 22-27% reduction in incidence, and a 30-33% reduction in prevalence in 10 years (fi gure). 76 Furthermore, these interventions were deemed to be highly cost eff ective, even if the costs of the interventions were as high as US$2500 per case detected in India, and $5000 per case detected in China and South Africa. Importantly, these projections show that the populationlevel benefi ts of active case-fi nding accumulate with time since removal of infectious cases from the population prevents the development of additional cases in both the near-term and long-term future; thus an assessment at the end of 1 year is unlikely to show a substantial eff ect, even though the 10 year projected benefi t is substantial. These projections assume that detection is synonymous with prompt and eff ective treatment, so all case-fi nding has to be directly linked to the immediate delivery of care.",

The additional cases detected are assumed to come from a homogeneous population, with detection occurring at a random point of disease progression. Figure cases was 35%, after controlling for historical trends in case notifi cation rates and changes in case notifi cation rates in control populations that did not receive the interventions. 20 In one of these initiatives, undertaken in Karachi, Pakistan, a combination of screening outpatients in clinics and a mass communication campaign encouraging people with prolonged cough to seek care more than doubled the case notifi cation rate in the intervention area compared with the control area. 29 A model consistent with local tuberculosis epidemiological data projected that if the level of case detection achieved during the intervention year were maintained, 24% of the tuberculosis cases and 52% of the tuberculosis deaths that would have occurred in the absence of the intervention would be averted in 5 years; even if the level of case detection were to fall back to baseline immediately after the intervention year, 13% of cases and 25% of deaths would be averted. 77",

The knowledge necessary to do these activities exists and successes have been documented across a range of settings. While major changes to existing policies and care delivery systems will take time, action in the near future is possible. Some administrative and environmental interventions, such as providing individuals suspected of having tuberculosis with surgical masks until treatment begins and, where practical, opening windows in health facilities, can be implemented immediately without changes to existing systems or large investment of resources. Others, such as performing basic household contact investigations, implementation of the FAST strategy, and expansion of the use of molecular diagnostics, will require some additional human resources, training, and capacity building, but can be rapidly accomplished within the context of existing health-care delivery systems. Still others, such as integration of health-care services, have a slightly longer timeframe because they require the development of partnerships and the reorganisation of existing systems. The development and deployment of new point-of-care diagnostic technologies could accelerate these eff orts by making diagnosis easier in the future.",
