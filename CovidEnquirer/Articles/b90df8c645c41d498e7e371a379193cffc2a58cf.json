Another concern is the potential for contamination of patient care equipment with infectious body fluids.

Recommendations include wearing gloves during direct contact with contaminated equipment; containing heavily soiled equipment; and properly cleaning, disinfecting, and sterilizing equipment before use on another patient. 1, 9 In the surgical setting, a patient may be admitted for emergency surgery but also may be harboring an unknown bacterial or viral infection. By consistently applying standard precautions, the possibility of infection transmission is decreased greatly. These precautions may include hand hygiene and use of gloves, eye protection or a face shield, a mask, or a gown depending on the anticipated exposure. For example, when the circulating nurse assists with intubation and extubation, he or she should wear the appropriate PPE (eg, gloves, mask, eye protection).",

Indirect transmission occurs when an intermediate object (eg, a contaminated needle or instrument, the hands of a health care worker) transfers microorganisms to a susceptible host. Sources that are particularly unsanitary are referred to as \"high touch surfaces\" (eg, elevator buttons, telephones, door handles). Another example of indirect disease transmission is that of vectorborne illnesses that are propagated by mosquitoes, flies, rats, deer, and squirrels. Diseases in this category include Lyme disease, plague, tickborne relapsing fever, tularemia, Eastern equine and West Nile encephalitis, and yellow fever. [18] [19] [20] AIRBORNE TRANSMISSION. Airborne transmission occurs when a person inhales an infectious agent. The infectious particles are small enough to be suspended in the air and to move along air currents. Patients with airborne infectious diseases must be placed in an airborne infection isolation room (ie, previously known as negative pressure room) with negative pressure in relation to the corridor. All staff members providing care for the patient should wear a National Institute of Occupational Safety and Health (NIOSH)-certified N95 respirator. 13, 14 Patients with airborne infections should not be removed from their rooms unless a procedure cannot be performed in a patient room (eg, nonportable x-rays) or is deemed an emergent situation (eg, emergency surgical interventions). When patients do require transport outside of their rooms, the patient is required to wear a surgical mask. Transmission of Aspergillus spores between patients have been noted in an intensive care unit where a patient required frequent wound debridement and extensive dressing changes. 21 Transmission was thought to have occurred via aerosolization of the spore. DROPLET TRANSMISSION. Diseases can be transmitted via the respiratory system from one person to another directly or indirectly.",

            "text": "Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease is a progressive neurological disorder involving an infection with a prion. 33 A prion is thought to be a transmissible, proteinaceous agent. In the United States, CJD occurs in one person per million per year. Prion diseases also can infect sheep (ie, scrapie), cattle (ie, bovine spongiform encephalopathy), and deer and elk (ie, chronic wasting disease). Transmission has been linked to treatment with \u2022 human cadaveric pituitary-derived hormone; \u2022 human dura mater grafts; \u2022 corneal transplants; and \u2022 contaminated neurosurgical instruments, including stereotactic electroencephalogram electrodes. Bloodborne transmission has been linked to two infections in patients with variant CJD. 34 Standard precautions are recommended when caring for patients infected with CJD. 33 Special processes are required when handling tissue in the histology laboratory or when performing an autopsy. It is essential that a very specific method be used for disinfecting surgical equipment and instruments. [35] [36] [37] Processing any CJD-suspect equipment includes soaking the item in sodium hydroxide solution (ie, 1N NaOH) and after removing the item from the solution, steam sterilizing it at 134\u00b0 C (273\u00b0 F) for 18 minutes. Alternatively, the item may be soaked in 1N NaOH and, after removal from the solution, steam sterilized at 121\u00b0 C (250\u00b0 F) for 30 minutes. Recent studies have indicated that the temperature for steriliza-tion must be exact. If the temperature is above the recommendation, prion growth may occur. [38] [39] [40] [41] SARS. According to the World Health Organization, a total of 8,098 people worldwide became sick with SARS during the 2003 outbreak. 42, 43 Of those infected, 774 died. As of February 2003, a total of 418 patients were thought to be infected with SARS in the United States. Of those patients 344 were classified as having \"suspected\" and 74 as having \"probable\" SARS cases. 44 All of these people had traveled to other parts of the world where SARS was prevalent. Disease transmission has been documented during endotracheal intubation; noninvasive positive pressure (eg, continuous positive airway pressure, bilevel positive airway pressure); and cardiopulmonary resuscitation. [45] [46] [47] [48] The incubation period of SARS CoV is two to 10 days, and symptoms include generalized upper respiratory infections, temperature greater than 38\u00b0 C (100.4\u00b0 F), chills, rigors, headache, and rapidly progressing dyspnea. 42, 43, 49, 50 Outbreaks in health care settings have been documented with health care workers becoming ill with the disease after caring for infected patients. 49, 51, 52 AVIAN FLU. Usually, the term avian influenza virus refers to influenza A viruses found most predominantly in birds, but infections with these viruses can and have occurred in humans. 53, 54 Confirmed cases of human infection from several subtypes of avian influenza have been reported since 1997. 55 Most cases of avian influenza in humans have resulted from contact with infected poultry (eg, domesticated chicken, ducks, turkeys) or surfaces contaminated with secretion or excretions from infected birds. [56] [57] [58] [59] The spread of avian influenza virus from one ill person to another has been reported very rarely and has been limited, inefficient, and unsustained. [56] [57] [58] [59] Symptoms of avian influenza in humans have ranged from typical human influenzalike symptoms (eg, fever, cough, sore throat, muscle aches) to eye infections, pneumonia, and severe respiratory diseases (eg, acute respiratory distress) and other severe and lifethreatening complications. The symptoms of avian influenza may depend on which type of avian influenza virus caused the infection. When the virus is documented in humans in the United States, all patients who present to a health care setting with fever and respiratory symptoms should be managed according to CDC recommendations, including respiratory etiquette. Patients and visitors should be questioned regarding their recent travel history. Patients with a history of travel in the previous 10 days to a country with avian influenza activity and who are hospitalized with a severe febrile respiratory illness, 54 or are otherwise being evaluated for avian influenza, should be managed using isolation precautions identical to those recommended for patients with known SARS. These include the following:",

Infection with this disease can reach epidemic proportions quickly, especially in hospitals, nursing homes, cruise ships, hotels, and schools, [60] [61] [62] [63] [64] possibly because the minimal infecting dose required for infection to occur is extremely low (ie, less than 100 viral particles). The incubation period is 12 to 48 hours, and symptoms last 12 to 60 hours. Patients report nausea, vomiting, abdominal cramps, and diarrhea. Although transmission is primarily fecal-oral, there have been reports of transmission via aerosolization of infectious particles from vomitus or fecal material. It has been suggested that health care workers may inhale and then swallow the virus.",
