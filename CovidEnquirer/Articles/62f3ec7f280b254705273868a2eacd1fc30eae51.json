In the other three cases no spinal cord symptoms were present and the myelopathy was discovered only at autopsy (patients 2, 7 and 8 in Table 1 ).

The vacuolation involved also motoric and sensory tracts of the brain stem; in the medulla oblongata the pyramids showed marked involvement in five cases (Table 2) . A systematic degeneration of the distal parts of the fiber tracts, suggesting a dying back phenomenon, was lacking. The picture also differed from Wallerian degeneration because axonal spheroids were only seldom found at the level of the most severe degeneration and there was no clear craniocaudal gradient of degeneration. The vacuoles were of different origins. Most of them consisted of swollen myelinated fibers and were characterized by a thin myelinic rim. The majority of vacuoles were optically empty, others contained normal looking axons, which were located either at the center or at the periphery of the vacuole. Some vacuoles harboured lipid laden macrophages (Figs. 2b and 3a) . Axonal spheroids were only found in areas of severe vacuolation, which also displayed some activated astro-cytes. Some vacuoles were swollen macrophages or axons which were detected by the immunoreaction to CD 68 resp. neurofilament protein ( Fig. 3b and 4) . The macrophages behaved the same way as activated tissue macrophages and showed a positive reaction with a-1-antitrypsin, a-1-antichymotrypsin and lysozyme, whereas they did not react with MAC 387. The applied antibodies against HIV-core (p 17 and p 24) and envelope-proteins (gp 41) reacted with cytoplasmic epitopes in mononuclear and multinucleated cells in the cerebrum in three of five cases with HIV-encephalopathy, whereas multinucleated HIVcells of the other two cases did not react with these antibodies. Only case 2 ( Table 2) showed few HIVpositive cells in vacuolated regions of the spinal cord.

Some degree of spasticity, bladder and bowel disturbances are also features of the AIDS-Dementia-Complex (ADC) , which develops frequently in AIDS-patients 8 .

            "text": "Another pathogenesis is suggested by the clinical and morphological resemblance of VM and subacute combined degeneration (SCD) due to Vito B12 -or perhaps folic acid deficiency. Both deficiencies cause vacuolation of myelin; the most severe lesions occur in the posterior columns of the lower cervical and upper thoracic cord 31 ,36. Vacuolation and demyelination of the cerebral white matter, rarely seen in SCD, are held responsible for the dementia which develops in some of the vitamin deficient patients. Although most AIDS-patients are in a malnourished and often cachectic state, Vito B12 and folic acid levels, however, were normal in most reported cases 32 . In our patients Vito B12levels were not investigated. SCD has also been reported in patients with normal serum B 12 levels in Lupus erythematodes, with a familial defect in cobalamin metabolism and after prolonged exposure to nitrous oxide (for review see Petito et a1. 32 ). These disorders were not found in our patients, nor have they been reported in conjunction with AIDS. None of our patients was exposed to toxic agents known to produce spinal cord lesions like hexachlorophene, intrathecal gentamycin, isoniacid or clioquinoP2. Metabolic disorders known to produce spinal cord pathology -hepatic disease with portocaval shunt, nicotinic acid deficiency and severe nutritional deficiencies -were also not present 15 ,31,43. Moreover these states cause Wallerian degeneration or a dying back process but no vacuolar myelopathy. However, toxic or metabolic cofactors are probably relevant to the pathogenesis of VM and VL and could also relate to the reported regional variation in incidence of VM6.",

Morphologically it is characterized by a vacuolar, non-inflammatory myelinopathy affecting the long tracts of the spinal cord. The vacuolated areas are infiltrated with lipid-laden macrophages. The process is reported to affect mainly the lateral and posterior columns of the midthoracic 32 or cervical and thoracic1,2 spinal cord. These vacuolar changes are neither specific for VM nor are they confined to the spinal cord of AIDS-patients. A vacuolar leucoencephalopathy (VL) has been described in the brain stem and the cerebral hemispheres of patients with and without VM. VL can occur as diffuse 27 or multifocal white matter change 32 ,34,4o. Moreover HIV-encephalopathy features not only microgranulomatous foci of mononuclear and multinucleated macrophages but sometimes also vacuolation mainly in the cerebral white matter, which can display diffuse pallor 4 , 16, 17. On the other hand, histopathological changes of HIV-encephalopathy can encroach on the spinal cord without showing vacuolar changes 41 ; an isolated HIV-myelitis without corresponding alterations in the brain has been reported by Geny et al. l1 .
