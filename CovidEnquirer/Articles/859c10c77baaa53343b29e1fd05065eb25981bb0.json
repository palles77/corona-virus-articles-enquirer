In 38 recent Canadian Accreditation AIM surveys, that included at least one surgical team, there were a total of 75 recommendations made to the teams. Most recommendations related to process as opposed to outcome issues, implying that surgeons need to become more proactive in the functioning of the surgical team and to participate more effectively in management issues related to surgical care. Attention to these details will position surgical programmes to effectively deal with the rapid pace of change that is inherent in a modern surgical practice",

The Canadian approach to accreditation is a rigorous peer review process comprised of a self-assessment against a set of standards, an on-site survey and follow-up action on recommendations that arise from the survey. In Canada, the process occurs over a three-year cycle. The standards are national in scope and allow for both standardisation and benchmarking against similar organisations throughout Canada. The standards were developed and are updated using a broadly based consultation process with input from healthcare professionals across Canada. The standards address patient care issues within a quality framework that defines the programme. The quality framework is applicable to the organisation as a whole and is based on four quality dimensions: Responsiveness, System Competency, Client/Community Focus and Work-life. The quality dimensions represent a balanced scorecard relevant to healthcare organisations within which organisations may structure their quality improvement initiatives. Surgery and all other care teams function within this framework. While the quality framework underpins the accreditation programme, it also forms a basis for delivery of acute care services such as surgery.",

In 1918, the ACS surveyed 692 hospitals in the United States and Canada to determine a minimum standard of care. Only 89 hospitals met the standard.

Teams are expected to form linkages with community organisations to provide for continuity of care after discharge and to participate in health promotion activities that will benefit patients. In Canada, the healthcare system is publicly owned and funded by government. However, accreditation is organised independently of government and relates to the self-interest of the organisation. It has been shown that self-regulating organisations have a better understanding of their processes and functions and can, therefore, act on their own problems. 2 This is particularly advantageous for surgery programmes because of the rapid evolution of surgical specialties which have changed across the continuum of care.",

The decrease in bed complements has also made it necessary for surgical teams to use care maps (clinical pathways) based on the application of best practices for efficient movement of patients through surgical units.

The value of surgical involvement and support of promotion and prevention programmes is well established for breast cancer, prostate cancer, cervical cancer and colorectal cancer. 5-7 Until recently, the role of surgery in health promotion and prevention has been of less importance than other aspects of the specialty. 8 Surgeons are participating in collaborative settings that are directed to prevention of a wide range of surgical problems. These include alcohol-related violence and the prevention of maxillofacial injury, exercise promotion for heart patients and smoking cessation. The presence of surgeons lends authority and credibility to these programmes. 9-12 (c) Being responsive covers topics of continuity and first contacts with the organisation. The rapid evolution of surgery and the surgical subspecialties has created many challenges for surgeons and other members of the surgical team. In most organisations, 80 to 85 per cent of all surgical procedures are now done on an outpatient basis. It has been necessary for organisations to develop pre-operative and pre-anaesthetic clinics to insure that patients are properly assessed and prepared for surgery. Accreditation in Canada provides a framework through application of the standards to address continuity issues related to outpatient surgery and affords an opportunity for surgical teams to develop initiatives related to appropriate assessment and better patient education. This in turn leads to fewer cancellations caused by patient conditions or inadequate work-up. For example, one institution reported a reduced cancellation rate of 21% when a pre-operative teaching programme was started.",

The foundation of patient safety is incident reporting in a blamefree environment which has been vigorously pursued by accreditation survey teams. More recently, survey teams have focused on adverse event reporting, critical incident analysis and morbidity and mortality review to round out the safety framework. As a result, there are many organisations, encouraged by accreditation, that have begun programmes to mark the side or site of surgery prior to transfer to the operating room.

There were no recommendations that related to work-life (Figure 1 ). The descriptors that define the Quality Dimensions that were encountered most frequently were effectiveness, participation and partnership, availability, appropriateness and safety (Table 1) . Of the 75 recommendations, there was a wide distribution across the subsections. Twenty-one out of seventy-five (28%) of the recommendations were in Subsection A, Being a Learning Organisation. Only two out of seventy-five (2.7%) related to subsection H, Achieving Positive Outcomes (Figure 2 ).",

            "text": "Surgeons have played a significant role in accreditation since it was first conceptualised by the American College of Surgeons in 1912. Accreditation is relevant to surgeons because it offers goals to be reached in the quest for excellence and in some cases the leverage to develop programmes needed in individual hospitals or communities. Accreditation is an internationally recognised process that encourages the use of continuous quality improvement in healthcare organisations. In Canada, the standards are applied on a national basis and allow teams and organisations an opportunity to benchmark and to share exceptional practices. The Acute Care Standards that are used to assess surgical teams reflect the continuum of clinical care and the learning opportunities inherent in a rapidly changing healthcare environment. Current areas of significant relevance to surgeons are the use of indicators for CQI, the use of clinical pathways, pain assessment, empowerment of patients through the informed consent process and the development of frameworks for patient safety. Accreditation is the ideal vehicle to drive these areas of relevance in Canadian surgical practice because of the national scope of the programme. Surveyors are encouraged to highlight these areas in on-site surveys and the organisations are able to benchmark against services in similar types of organisations. Also, by continuously evaluating the changes that occur in healthcare, the CCHSA is uniquely positioned to emphasise emerging trends in the accreditation process. Of the four quality dimensions as defined by the CCHSA the majority of recommendations were related to system competency. The most frequently encountered descriptors of quality were effectiveness, partnership, availability, appropriateness and safety. The process of surgical management is more frequently cited in recommendations to surgical teams than outcomes. The importance of team building in the modern surgical practice has been shown in the limited number of surveys cited. It is not surprising that patient safety has been the subject of a significant number of recommendations. This reflects the emphasis on this area by the accreditation process and the overall importance of safety as an issue in complex medical systems. As surgery evolves, accreditation will be increasingly important in defining a framework for the transformation of surgical care. ",
