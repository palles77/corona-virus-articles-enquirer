Little is known about the diseases that affect these animals in the wild or in captivity. Kidney samples from necropsies of 27 Iberian lynxes, wild and captive, were examined by histopathology, immunohistochemistry (IgG, IgM, IgA, laminin, type IV collagen, and fibronectin), electron microscopy (n = 8) and immunogold labelling for IgM, IgG and IgA in one case, in order to characterize the glomerulopathy prevalent in this species. Urinalyses from records were available for 9 of the necropsied animals and blood and urine samples from 23 free ranging and captive Iberian lynxes were prospectively obtained in order to evaluate the renal function of the living population. A focal, diffuse membranous glomerulonephritis (MGN) that progressed with age was diagnosed in all but one of the animals in different stages not associated to concurrently known infectious diseases. Positive immunoexpression of IgM and IgG was observed in the glomerular capillary basement membranes and intramembranous electron-dense deposits, compatible with immune complexes (ICs) were seen with electron microscopy.",

The serum biochemistry and urinalyses also revealed signs of mild chronic kidney disease in 16 of the 23 animals evaluated. In conclusion, the membranous glomerulopathy affecting the Iberian lynx is a progressive disease of immune origin. We postulate a possible genetic predisposition towards the disease, enhanced by inbreeding and a possible connection to an immune-mediated systemic disease. #",

A recent histopathological study of our group, evaluating the status of peripheral lymph nodes, spleen and MALT (mucosa-associated lymphoid tissue) in 17 Iberian lynxes necropsied between the years 1998 and 2003, has reported a generalized immune depletion in these animals, apparently not related to infectious agents or malnutrition (Pe\u00f1a et al., 2006) .",

The study of these diseases is important because of their relevance in endangered species conservation programs. A good example of this is the cheetah, considered a paradigm for disease vulnerability (Munson et al., 2005) . This is the first report of glomerulonephritis in the Iberian lynx. The main objectives of this study were to characterize by means of histology, immunohistochemistry, and electron microscopy, the type of glomerulopathy detected in the Iberian lynx, to determine its pathogenesis, and to evaluate serum biochemical and urinary parameters related to renal function in wild and captive Iberian lynx surviving in the southwest of Spain. The membranous glomerulopathy affecting the Iberian lynx is a progressive disease of immune origin. We postulate that the Iberian lynx has a likely genetic predisposition towards the disease, enhanced by inbreeding, and is potentially connected to a possible immune-mediated systemic disease.",

The markers of kidney damage used for the Iberian lynx were: elevated BUN, hypoalbuminemia, elevated serum creatinine concentration, hyperphosphatemia, hypocalcemia, impaired urine concentrating ability (USG was considered normal when !1030), proteinuria, and renal hematuria. These must be confirmed to be of kidney origin and at least one must be present to identify the existence of renal disease. Stage 1 (non-azotemic) was considered when markers of kidney damage were present and serum creatinine concentration was <1.6, stage 2 (mild renal azotemia) presented markers and creatinine values between 1.6 and 2.8 mg/dl. In stage 3 (moderate renal azotemia) creatinine values must be 2.8-3.3 mg/dl, and in stage 4 (severe renal azotemia), creatinine values exceed 5 mg/dl. The stages were further subcategorized using the protein-to-creatinine ratio as proteinuric (ratio >1.0), non-proteinuric (ratio <0.5) or borderline proteinuric (ratio 0.5-1.0).",

Non-parametric statistical tests (Kruskal-Wallis and Median Test) have been performed when necessary. Epidemiological variables included: age as a numerical variable in months and as a categorical variable: (young, 0-12 months; young adult, 13-24 months; and adult/senile, >24 months), gender, origin (Sierra Morena or Do\u00f1ana), and free or captive. In order to evaluate the kidney lesion, four histopathological variables were used: (a) percentage of glomeruli in category 1, (b) percentage of glomeruli in category 2, (c) percentage glomeruli in category 3 and (d) stage of kidney affection (stage 1, none or minimal lesion; stages 2 and 3, moderate and severe) (categorical).
