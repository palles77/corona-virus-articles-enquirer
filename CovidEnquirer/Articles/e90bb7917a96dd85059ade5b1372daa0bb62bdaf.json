Establishment of healthcare policy in South Korea provides patients' freedom to select and visit multiple hospitals. Current policy enforces hospitals preference for multi-patient rooms to single-patient rooms, to lower financial burden. Existing healthcare systems tragically contributed to 186 MERS outbreak cases, starting from single \"index patient\" into three generations of secondary infections. By developing a macro-level health system dynamics model, we provide empirical knowledge to examining the case from both operational and financial perspectives. In our simulation, under base infectivity scenario, high emergency room occupancy circumstance contributed to an estimated average of 101 (917%) more infected patients, compared to when in low occupancy circumstance. Economic patient room design showed an estimated 702% increase in the number of infected patients, despite the overall 98% savings in total expected costs compared to optimal room design. This study provides first time, system dynamics model, performance measurements from an operational perspective. Importantly, the intent of this study was to provide evidence to motivate public, private, and government healthcare administrators' recognition of current shortcomings, to optimize performance as a whole system, rather than mere individual aspects.",

A total of 186 individuals were infected, starting with a single \"index\" patient (a.k.a., \"patient zero\"), ultimately causing 38 fatalities within a two-month time period ( Choi et al., 2015 ) . Regardless of numerous scientific journals estimation of a MERS reproduction rate < 1, implying sub-epidemic potential ( Breban et al., 2013; Chowell et al., 2015 ) , the MERS outbreak in Korea has placed historical significant impact and global recognition of the vulnerability of the present-day Korean healthcare system. While Korea has enjoyed \"top-tier\" overall healthcare status, based on its placement in the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) rankings ( Park and Jang, 2012 ) , the recent MERS outbreak revealed shortcomings of Korean hospital and government management systems, leading to poor MERS patient care in outbreaks, as well as other ongoing patient care. Serendipitously, last year's outbreak of MERS is now being discussed as the sole responsibility of the hospital, instead of the healthcare system as a whole.",

Hospital A referred the index patient to Hospital B . Then Hospital B referred inpatients, who made close contacts with the index patient, to different hospitals. Through referring process from hospital to hospital, facilities render vulnerability to a complex contagious disease, creating a MERS into a severe hospital-acquired infection (HAI). For example, Assiri et al., (2013) 's study identified the 21 of the 23 confirmed cases of MERS-CoV infection were acquired through personto-person transmission in patient care units and three different hospital facilities in Saudi Arabia, 2013. Similarly in Korea, within 10 days between the date of symptom onset to the identification of the index patient, 28 first generation MERS cases were identified ( Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015 ) . Overview of the MERS spreading process across 15 hospitals (excluding unidentified cases), and 186 confirmed cases, is summarized in Fig. 1 . Despite the high regard for Korea's level of medical practice, a defect in one medical specialty infectious disease was the primary catalyst for the rapid spread of MERS -ultimately causing social, economic and psychological impact nationwide ( Kim, 2015b ) . However, a number of hypotheses were generated to explain the spread, including: excessive patients' freedom in seeking medical care at only large hospitals, inadequate quarantine, questionable government transparency, such as belated reports of infected hospital names, and the cultural social norm of visiting patients as standard etiquette ( Choe, 2015a ( Choe, , 2015b ; Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015 ) . The significance of hospital operation flaws became apparent in the MERS breakout when Hospital B infected over 80 people, through ineffective actions and lack of protocol within emergency room ( Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2015 ) .",

            "text": "As a part of the Korean healthcare system's efforts to provide citizens with complete medical care, the system is also under pres-sure to lower medical costs. The Korean government has been trying to optimize patient room design by increasing numbers of \"multi-patient rooms\" rather than \"single-patient rooms\", in order to minimize overall healthcare cost for its citizens, as announced at the 2015 Health Insurance Policy Review Committee Conference in Seoul. Consequently, the existing system neglects operational perspectives and raises concerns by allowing 50% of hospital rooms to have more than four beds per room ( Ki, 2015 ) . Under another global view, the Canadian Standards Association argued that expansion of single patient rooms is no longer an option but a necessary decision ( Stall, 2012 ) , highlighting the relationship between patient room design and increased hand-touch dimensions within specific, patient-proximal areas. Stall (2012) reported risks of infections (such as Clostridium difficile , methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus , and vancomycin-reistant Enterococcus ) increased by 10-11% with new exposure to hospital roommate. Therefore, noted that with an increasing deadly threat of nosocomial infections, rooms with four or more beds expose patients to potential infections and, thus, the installation of single patient rooms is vital. Thus, infection control activities have been emphasized, such as the isolation of high-risk patients or patient with epidemiologically significant pathogens ( Huang and Platt, 2003; Marshall et al., 2004 ) . Furthermore, Bootsma et al. (2006) developed rapid diagnostic testing (RDT) for prediction of MRSA (methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus) to a below 1%, using Monte Carlo simulation model. While prevention of HAIs has been previously studied and applied elsewhere, its need for application in Korean policy remains unaddressed.",

However, the active family care has increased the risks of disease transmission, through frequent contacts with patients and hand-touch areas. Hand-touch sites are pathways to transmit pathogens from patient to patient, healthy visitors, caregivers, and/or hospital staff ( Oelberg et al., 20 0 0; Rheinbaben et al., 20 0 0 ) . Even though ward cleaners are given specific cleaning specifications of general areas and bathrooms, these do not cover all hand-touch sites that are specifically near patients, such as bed rails and nurse call buttons ( Dancer, 2004; Dancer et al., 2008; White et al., 2008 ) . Consequently, frequent hand-sites provide imminent risks for patients and visitors, especially the sites that are closely situated beside patients. Bhalla et al. (2004) performed a two-week experiment using organisms such as vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus to examine the frequency of hand acquisition of pathogens, after contact with surfaces near patients, and found that \"hand imprint cultures were positive for one or more of the pathogens after contacting surfaces in 53% of occupied patient rooms, and 24% of rooms that had been cleaned after patient discharge.\" Their research concluded that the environment could play a significant role in the contamination of medical staff. Korea, where families are obligated to provide partial patient caregiving as a social norm ( Ki, 2015 ) , is in dire need for social education in the negative influence of frequent visits, and excessive care of patients, leading to HAIs.",

Consequently, these results highlight the importance of ER overcrowding management as a preventive measure for outbreaks. Table 9 demonstrates how the number of visitors, per patient, increased the speed of secondary infections in high (compared to low) ER occupancy circumstance. The change in the secondary infection speed between low-and high occupancy circumstances becomes apparent by comparing low infectivity (x1.9 to x1.9) and high infectivity (x8.9 to x15.3) scenarios. Specifically, under base infectivity scenario, allowing 5 visitors per patient (vs. 1 visitor) contributed to an estimated 23.4 (27%) more infected patients. Fig. 6 (A) and (B) visually confirm a sharp increase in the numbers of infected patients under the high occupancy - ( Fig. 6 (B) ) vs. low occupancy-circumstances ( Fig. 6 (A) ).

While the secondary infection outcomes under low ER occupancy circumstance showed a minimal effect, high ER occupancy circumstance displayed maximum of 92.3 infected patient differences. The restriction of occupancy rates appeared significantly dependent on number of visitors, per patient, under base and high infectivity scenarios Lastly, frequent visits from families and friends highly affected the infection spread-rate. Korean cultural tradition encourages social etiquette for families to act as caregivers when their immediate family member is hospitalized. Consequently, more than 20 percent of the confirmed infected cases in the Korean 2015 MERS outbreak were family members of inpatients, and it became clear that family caregivers could have transmitted pathogens to other inpatients within the same hospital environments. In support of the Korean healthcare organization's statement that the cultural tendency of frequent visits to patients needs to be reassessed ( Choe, 2015b ) , our simulation result demonstrated that a decrease in number of visitors from 5 to 1 resulted in a dramatic decrease in the potential number of infected patients. Moreover, comparing the best-and worst-case scenarios illustrated a gap of approximately 122.8 patients, by day 10.",

Second, the model used in this research currently assumes the hospital is able to provide equal number of beds whether they are economic design (all 6-patients room) or optimal design (all single patient room) through the unrestricted ward capacity. Following assumption could impact the economic assumption, thus, future studies should consider the inclusion of financial perspective for the healthcare operational cost optimization. Lastly, future building of system dynamics model in healthcare should consider the addition of \"black box\" testing as part of the model validation process ( Brailsford et al., 2004 ) . While we did consider black box testing, which quantitatively measures and compares the simulation result with data from the actual event, we found that such analysis was beyond the purview of our current study.
