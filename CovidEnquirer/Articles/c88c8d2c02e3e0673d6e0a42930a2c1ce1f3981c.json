Due to their characteristics, virus adapt rapidly to changing conditions, thus allowing the quantification of several evolutionary features under controlled laboratory conditions. Here we review the basic biology of viruses and describe in detail a number of experiments performed with RNA viruses. Particular emphasis is devoted to the interpretation of the experiments and to the involved phenomenology. This analysis sometimes represents the basis to formulate simple evolutionary models that aim at describing the observed dynamics. In other cases, theoretical results have prompted the realization of related experiments, as we discuss. Concepts as fitness loss and fitness recovery, the error threshold, increased mutagenesis, viral sex, or viral competition and interference, are discussed in an empirical framework and from the associated theoretical point of view.",

The efforts of many scientists, among them Louis Pasteur, Robert Koch and Joseph Lister, were necessary to eradicate a belief that had been the subject of strong debate during decades. The end of spontaneous generation gave birth to the notion that life only comes from life. One of its consequences was the enunciation of Koch's postulates for defining whether an organism was the causative agent of a disease. 1 Koch's postulates became a paradigm in microbiology and brought about the design of sterilization methods that allowed to cultivate pure organisms. One of those methods consisted in the use of filters that most known bacteria could not go through. In this context, the discovery by Adolf Mayer and Dimitri Ivanofsky of a new infectious agent, the causative of tobacco mosaic disease, which was able to go through filters retaining infectivity had to fight against new and old dogmas. The agent could not be isolated in pure culture, contradicting Koch's second postulate. At first, it was supposed that either the filters were defective or that this \"filterable agent\" could be a toxin. However, Martinus Beijerinck soon made the crucial discovery on the ability of this agent to reproduce itself, though only inside living cells. For the first time, the existence of replicating entities smaller than bacteria, not observable with a light microscope, became clear. These entities were usually referred as filterable agents, and it was only after the first decades of the 20th century that the term virus started to be used with the same meaning that it has today. The discovery of viruses constitutes a good example of how knowledge in biology often defeats well established theories and requires their reformulation in order to include the new discoveries.",

The use of bacteriophages was crucial to develop methods and techniques that are currently used in virology and in the analysis of other important life processes, for instance the transmission of genetic information. Studies with phages such as the T series, X174, Q\u03b2, or \u03bb, have also permitted to investigate in a very detailed way the processes going on inside virus-infected cells, and to establish a sequence of events that, with some differences for each particular virus, must be successfully completed to produce an infectious progeny.

The genotype determines the features of the new progeny viruses that will be produced inside the infected cell. These features constitute the phenotype, and usually result in adaptive differences. At odds with all cellular organisms, which always use DNA to store the genetic information, viral genomes can be composed of DNA or of RNA.

This implies the design of replication mechanisms exclusively employed by this type of viruses. RNA virus replication is a very error prone process [34] , a feature with relevant consequences in the evolution of RNA viruses and in the amount of information that can be stored in their genomes. Measurements of the chain lengths and of the replication error rate of RNA viruses show that the genome length is close to the maximum that can be faithfully maintained. A consequence is that RNA viruses possess highly compacted genomes, with regions sometimes involved in several functions (as an example, coding regions can act also as regulatory signals).",

This is a process known as reverse transcription that is catalyzed by the enzyme reverse transcriptase of retroviruses. Both enzymes, RNA replicases and reverse transcriptases, have to be encoded by the viral genomes and expressed early during the infection cycle. In some cases, these enzymes are copackaged with the viral nucleic acid during the assembly of the viral particles. The intermediary molecule in the flux of genetic information that leads to the synthesis of specific proteins is the messenger RNA (mRNA), the RNA molecule accepted by the cellular ribosomes. This establishes a basic distinction between RNA viruses with negative or positive polarity. Positive polarity viruses can use their genomic RNAs as mRNAs that can be directly translated. In negative stranded viruses the genomic RNA has to be copied to produce subgenomic mRNA and full-length antigenomic RNA. The former can be translated, and the latter can be replicated again to obtain new negative-sense RNA genomes. Retroviruses represent an exception to this scheme. They possess positive polarity genomes that, instead of being translated directly, have to be copied to DNA before the replication cycle is completed. The newly synthesized DNA is integrated into the cellular DNA and transcribed by a cellular RNA polymerase to produce new RNA molecules. The latter can be used as mRNA or packaged inside the new virions. 5. Virus assembly. This is the process by which a number of structural and non-structural proteins are assembled together with the genomic RNA to constitute a new virus particle. 6. Virus release. This a crucial step to propagate the infection cell-to-cell or organism-to-organism. Different viruses employ different strategies to leave the cell. Enveloped viruses (those enclosed by a lipid bilayer) are usually released by budding from the plasma membrane. Non-enveloped viruses generally escape via lysis of the infected cell.",

This diversity is eventually responsible for the existence of differences in the reproductive success of individuals, in their fitness. Most genetic variability is a direct consequence of the occurrence of errors during the copy of viral genomes. Nucleic acid replication is a complex process where a complementary sequence is created through the sequential addition of nucleotides. Replication is not fully faithful and, occasionally, an incorrect nucleotide is added to the synthesizing chain. If the error is not corrected, it can be propagated to the next generations and results in a mutation. Apparently, there might be a contradiction between the deleterious effect of most mutations and the need of diversity to permit adaptation to changing conditions.

Positive selection favours the presence of mutations with an adaptive value whereas negative selection purges or maintains in low amount genomes carrying deleterious mutations.

Esteban Domingo and colleagues, working with clones of the bacteriophage Q\u03b2, estimated the diversity of fragments obtained after digestion with RNAase T1 (an enzyme that cut the RNA at specific sequences of nucleotides). They found that about 15% of the clones derived from a multiply passaged Q\u03b2 population showed patterns which deviated from those obtained with the bulk RNA extracted from the total virus population [32] . Correction of this value by the length of the sequence analyzed by this technique leads to an estimate of one or two nucleotide differences in each phage genome. As Esteban Domingo and colleagues posed it: The genome of Q\u03b2 phage cannot be described as a defined unique structure, but rather as a weighted average of a large number of different individual sequences [32] .

However, the quasispecies might occasionally experience deep reorganizations that are not reflected in the consensus sequence. Variants at memory levels are an example, since those genomes carry mutations that, in spite of never being detected in the consensus sequence, can have a profound influence in the adaptation of the population. When the environmental conditions are relatively constant the virus population can be maintained in evolutionary stasis, with the result that the consensus sequence keeps almost invariant through time. This situation usually occurs in viruses infecting the same host during very long time periods, as influenza in birds or hantavirus in rodents. Evolutionary stasis does not mean, at short evolutionary time scales, that the mutation rates decrease: It represents instead an equilibrium between mutation and selection that yields a consensus sequence mostly without changes. A virus that is kept invariant for a long time can experience an acceleration in the fixation of mutations when the environment is altered, as it occurs during the infection of a new host. A recently studied example is the coronavirus causing the SARS epidemic [107] . At the beginning of the spread of the virus in the human population, it experienced a high rate of fixation of mutations that probably were essential for the adaptation of the virus to the new host.",

The reproductive success of a virus depends not only on its ability to replicate its genome: there are many other processes that have to be completed to eventually generate a new infectious virus progeny. These processes, detailed in Section 1.1.1, include the interactions derived from the production in the same cell of a pool of viral proteins and nucleic acids carrying different mutations. This complex mixture of molecules establishes a network of interactions where different genomes play different roles. As a side result of complementation among genomes, it is common to find parasites (genomes that use for their replication resources supplied by other viruses) or altruistic behavior (genomes that produce proteins that are used by other viruses). We can think of a viral population as a kind of entangled ecosystem composed by molecules with different capacities, in continuous interaction, and with a common origin.

This reveals that fitness is a many-fold feature that includes not only the replicative ability of the genome, but also several other processes that must be successfully completed if a viable infectious progeny is to be produced. Optimisation of fitness requires a compromise between the different features involved. For instance, a fast replicator might be at advantage when competing inside the cell with other genomes, but suppressing the ability to correctly encode packing signals brings about a clear disadvantage to propagate. This establishes trade-offs between different features, and the problem of fitness optimisation in viruses turns out to have a number of constrains whose relative relevance depends on the present environment.

An example of this category of viruses is influenza, which through a continuous change in their antigenic properties (antigenic drift) evades the immune system of the host [37] . Usually, this escape mechanism is limited by the fact that, in most viruses, their antigenic determinants are the same proteins required for the penetration of the virus inside the cell [4] . The opposite strategy is that of viruses that have attenuated its virulence up to a limit compatible with persistence in their hosts, without provoking serious disease symptoms. Many of these viruses can stay unnoticed, being only exposed when they infect a new host lacking effective defense mechanisms to defeat the new infectious agent.

The tree has a main trunk with branching points representing drifting strains that become extinct in an approximately one-year period. This type of topology likely results from the continuous emergence of new virus variants that can evade recognition by the immune system through a change in the properties of their antigenic sites. In the case of influenza the renew of susceptibles comes from births of new hosts and from regained susceptibility of previously infected individuals to new influenza variants. The short infectious periods of influenza, together with its high genetic variation, leads to a rapid strain turnover, probably one of the reasons producing the strong seasonality of influenza epidemics. An unresolved question concerns the transmission mode of influenza through respiratory droplets containing just one or a few viral particles. This strong reduction in population size could lead to the fixation of mutations during optimization of the virus inside each particular host. The expected result should be a very high diversity among lineages (infecting different hosts) that is not observed in natural populations of the virus. Mathematical models of influenza epidemics have approached this question by taking into account the balance between the production of new strains and the competition-induced stochastic extinction of existing variants. The results obtained show that, if cross-immunity is the only form of competition between strains, there is an exponential growth of diversity. However, if a short-lived immunity that inhibits reinfection by any new strain during a short time is considered in the model, the probability of explosive diversity growth is strongly reduced [64, 126] .",

Viruses often behave differently on different types of cultured cells, and in addition each of the culture types holds technical advantages and disadvantages. Typically, adaptations to the new conditions in the laboratory involve serial transfers of the virus in liquid cell cultures that provide the appropriate environment for competition among a large number of genomes, eventually leading to the selection of the most fit to the new situation.

As has been explained, only mutations present in most genomes can be detected by conventional Fig. 2 . Scheme of laboratory protocols used to quantify genomic changes in the course of evolution of viral populations. Adaptation from the natural host to the in vitro environment is the first necessary step. Isolation of individual virions (for later use as founders of a new population or to characterize the heterogeneity of a quasispecies) is performed through dilution and plating (at low multiplicity of infection) on cellular monolayers deposited on Petri dishes. The virions composing a single lytic plaque constitute a biological clone. Massive passages of a population are usually carried out through bottle-to-bottle transfers. This procedure allows competition between variants and optimization of fitness in the environment considered. At any point, the genomes of the bulk population can be amplified through polymerase chain reaction and sequenced in order to obtain the consensus sequence of the quasispecies (which yields the most common nucleotide at each genomic position). In the case of RNA genomes, translation to DNA through the action of reverse transcriptase, and insertion in the circular genome of a plasmid permits molecular cloning inside a bacteria (Escherichia coli, often) and the characterization of population heterogeneity. Since molecular clones are not necessarily viable, while biological clones result from infecting variants, the composition of a quasispecies measured in one or another way might differ. Detailed explanations of these protocols are to be found in Section 2.2. sequencing methods. The consensus sequence contains part of the information on the evolution followed by the whole quasispecies, and can be of relevance to know the changes experienced by a majority of the genomes. Knowing the diversity in the population necessarily requires sequencing a representative fraction of the ensemble of genomes both in the ancestral and in the evolved viral population. A simple way to do this consists in plating the population on a Petri dish, isolating a number of lytic plaques (called in this case biological clones), and sequencing the genome of the virus population contained in each plaque independently. Since the generation of a plaque involves only a few replication rounds, it is assumed that this sequence is similar enough to that of the virus that initiated the plaque, and thus represents it.",

On the one hand, clones of fitness lower than average can be selected at each transfer, such that the average fitness of the population decreases. On the other hand, during the development of a lytic plaque between successive bottlenecks, a certain degree of heterogeneity is generated, both towards lower fitness variants and towards higher fitness variants. As the initial population is placed at a high fitness state, the appearance of less fit mutants is more frequent than the appearance of advantageous ones, as expected. Eventually, however, the generation (and positive selection) of variants of higher fitness balances the appearance (and negative selection) of those with lower fitness. At that point, a statistically stationary state ensues. Seen from another viewpoint, the statistical properties of that state result from the competition of two time scales: that of external perturbations (in the form of population bottlenecks) vs. the time allowed for the generation of diversity between bottlenecks. The former time scale is mostly responsible for negative selection and fixation of lower fitness variants, while the latter enhances the appearance of advantageous mutants and enables active positive selection. Indeed, in some cases where lytic plaques could be barely observed or, apparently, infectious particles were absent, an increase in the development time between bottlenecks permitted the recovery of an infective subpopulation [74] .",

A significant decrease of infectivity was observed after 40 consecutive transfers which constituted the whole length of the experiment, but neither a statistically stationary state of fitness values, nor extinction of the population, were observed. Other experiments used vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) as a model system [35, 45] . VSV is a negative-sense, ssRNA virus with a single, non-segmented genome, and does not experience recombination at a detectable level. In those experiments, fitness decreased steadily from the average value of the initial, well-adapted population, in agreement with theoretical expectation. As an additional result [43, 95] , a dependence of the fitness loss with the initial fitness was observed for the first time: high fitness clones lose fitness faster than clones with lower fitness. Selection pressure is stronger in the latter, such that they are less tolerant to the incorporation of new mutations. Studies with the phage MS2 support the decrease in fitness from an initially well adapted population when bottlenecks are applied [23] , with a coefficient c 0.16 (Eq. (1) ).",

This contrasts to the sensitivity of HIV-1 [136] , where in a comparable experiment 6 out of 10 clones could not produce viable progeny after only 15 plaque-to-plaque transfers. This observation might reflect a different internal time scale in different virus, in the sense that different viruses employ different time lengths in a replication cycle, or in the killing of a cell. It might be that HIV cannot undergo a sufficiently large number of replication cycles to generate the minimum diversity needed to overcome the negative effects of bottlenecks.

In order to optimize fitness, large population passages, which permit competition among mutants and positive selection of best adapted variants, are applied.

A plausible interpretation of this behaviour comes from simple evolutionary models where a first phase dominated by the formation of a quasistationary distribution in fitness space is followed by a slower increase in the average fitness of the population [127] . Interestingly, empirical observations also reveal that the time interval between successive increases in fitness during adaptation follows a stretched exponential distribution [46] . Qualitatively, these studies point out that the population experiences more difficulties in acquiring new advantageous mutations when it is near optimal fitness.

One interesting open question is the nature of subsequent evolutionary steps in the system of defectives, which might help understand the role of viral sex in evolution. If sex is understood as the exchange of genetic material between organisms, then recombination could be interpreted as a form of sex, because fragments of different parental molecules are joined to produce a new genome. However, sex in virus usually refers to forms with segmented genomes that can experience genetic reassortment. This type or genomic reorganization is clearly beneficial for viruses, such as influenza, that can infect different hosts and thus have genes that, in spite of being quite similar, maintain host-specific differences. This kind of sex has clear benefits in the diversification of influenza virus.",

When complementation occurs, the fitness of all viruses that coinfect a cell is the average fitness in the absence of coinfection of that group of viruses [97] . There are interesting effects in this same system when situations with low MOI and high MOI alternate.

Indeed, only in a scenario where coinfection with different viral types is not limiting is it possible to observe the appearance and maintenance of several defective forms in the quasispecies. There are, in addition, two theoretical hypothesis proposing that defective, complementary viral forms, might be even able to outcompete the standard form of a virus. One hypothesis is that genome segmentation and encapsidation in different particles evolved in response to high mutation rates, in what would constitute viral sex [16, 103] .

While a dependence of the form ln T d (n 0 ) \u221d ln(n 0 ) was obtained for the defective type, the killing time follows T s (n 0 ) \u221d ln(n 0 ) for the standard form of the virus [57] . The difference can be explained on the basis of the efficiency of long-range transport in the two-dimensional system where infection propagates. While the standard form can cause infection with a single particle, the requirement of coinfection for the defective forms translates in the inefficiency of long-range transport [85] . In other words, infection of neighboring cells occurs at high MOI, while the dilution caused by long-range transport implies that infection at large distances from the infectious focus occur at low MOI, in which case defection is a losing strategy.",

On the other hand, a high mutation rate is risky in that it has to be kept below an upper limit in order to maintain the information coded in the genome [11, 39] . Some analyses seem to indicate that the mutation rate of RNA viruses is close to that upper threshold [67, 113] . As a result, an interesting antiviral strategy consists in increased mutagenesis [27, 30, 40] , through which it should possible, in principle, to push the quasispecies beyond that threshold.

In all cases, viral infectivity was strongly reduced and extinction often followed. Another consequence of increased mutagenesis is that the spectrum of mutants broadens: Analyses of the variants present show that the diversity of genomes largely increases, implying that the quasispecies becomes more complex and that the consensus sequence reveals less about the structure of the population. In addition, the fraction of defective genomes increases, and the interaction between viable and parasitic classes acquires higher relevance. In a recent experiment with FMDV, it seems that it is precisely the action of the parasites what drives the population to extinction [62] .",

Such infections were monitored under the addition of different amounts of the mutagenic base analog 5-fluorouracil. A number of cellular monolayers were infected and, at different times post infection, the total amount of RNA and the total number of infective particles were quantified [62] . A representative plot of the dynamics of the system is shown in Fig. 4 . Interestingly, as time elapsed, if any change was to be observed in the intracellular amount of progeny RNA, that was a slight increase. However, the number of plaque forming units decreased, until infectivity disappeared at about 90 hours post infection. The results indicate that the replicative ability of the genome does not disappear concomitantly with infectivity, and suggest the following interpretation of this behaviour. Inside the cell, the products codified by all the infecting viral genomes are available to all of them simultaneously. Since the infection is persistent, cells are not lysed and the main competition among types in the quasispecies is for resources to replicate. The fastest sequences will proportionally increase in number inside the cell. This egoistic behaviour turns out to be lethal for LCMV, since the ability to correctly codify the necessary products for survival is not maintained in the parasitic subpopulation. Replication is a phenotypic trait that experiences positive selection inside the cell (there is sustained competition between replicating types during a persistent infection). Infectivity is not selected for, since the infection of fresh cells is not necessary for survival. Eventually, the virus loses its infective capacity and becomes unviable, such that extinction follows. In this case, 100 \u00b5g/ml of the mutagen 5-fluorouracil were added to the infected cells.",

One possible interpretation is that the optimal size of replicators reflects a trade-off between the information they encode and the information encoded in the replicating machinery.

(7) sets a relationship between sequence length, copying fidelity, and selective superiority, and is the core of Eigen's paradox on the limits of information maintainability through selection. If the inequality is violated (the sequence becomes too long, the fidelity is too low, or the superiority is not higher enough than that of the following class) the master sequence disappears from the population. The initial theory has been enlarged, complemented and refined by a large number of subsequent works. Evolution of finite populations, and thus the effect of population fluctuations on survival of the master sequence, led to a stronger condition on the replication fidelity, though the qualitative results remained unchanged [24] . This additional restriction on the error threshold is however counterbalanced when selection acting on the phenotype is taken into account. Indeed, the many different genotypes that result in the same phenotype (mutational neutrality) [68] translate into an increase in the error threshold when the degeneracy of the map genotype-phenotype is considered. Though this increase is limited, as shown by theoretical studies [122] , analysis of real ribozymes suggest that the classical threshold (7) could be increased up to eight fold [73] , thus remarkably alleviating Eigen's paradox. This also implies that two different error thresholds could be defined: a first one where the master sequence is lost, and a second one where the phenotypic information is lost. A review of the notion of error threshold can be found in [11] .",

They reached the conclusion that increases in the mutation rate could cause a shift in the dominant quasispecies due to differences in the distribution of neutral nearest neighbours in sequence space. This result has been reformulated [133] and applied to computational models, where it has been observed that, under increased mutagenesis, the winner of a competition between two quasispecies is not necessarily the one occupying the highest fitness peak, but may be the population with the largest neutral neighbourhood (thus the most robust one) [132] . Quasispecies do not only maximize fitness through evolution: in order to minimize the effects of mutations in constant environments, they also evolve towards maximal robustness [128] . Some aspects of this phenomenon were already observed in the experiments with Q\u03b2 [10] , and in subsequent experiments with RNA viruses [13] . Much theoretical interest has been and is currently devoted to the topological properties of the fitness [25] and structure space [52, 53] , which determine quasispecies robustness and the evolutionary fate of RNA molecular populations [134] .",

Epistatic effects among mutations where also considered as a possible mechanism able of accelerating or slowing down the speed of the ratchet. Under weak antagonistic epistasis [17] the time between successive clicks of the ratchet grows, though the rate of fitness decline is barely affected (as in previous models, it is assumed that all mutations have a negative effect on fitness). However, under stronger epistatic selection the ratchet can be effectively halted, such that, in practice, a finite population could survive almost indefinitely [72] .",

The parameter \u03b1 is the epistasis parameter: synergistic and antagonistic epistasis are described by \u03b1 > 1 and \u03b1 < 1, respectively, and Eq.

The occurrence of compensatory mutations (not reversions) which could have phenotypic effects and even outweigh the effect of the accumulated deleterious mutations has been considered [2, 7, 74, 108, 129] . Indeed, compensatory mutations were proposed as a mechanism as effective as recombination in halting the deleterious effect of the ratchet [129] , in the framework of a model that includes as a novelty the separation of effects in the phenotype from changes in the genotype. This distinction is especially relevant in the context of quasispecies, since the mutation-selection equilibrium is defined as the stationary distribution of fitness values selected in the given environment. This equilibrium does not fix the consensus sequence, which would surely be affected by (quasi-)neutral drift. Starting with a high-fitness variant, decreases in fitness due to the action of the ratchet were observed. However, at a certain point compensatory mutations stop the effect of deleterious mutations and the average fitness of the population keeps an average value with small fluctuations around it [129] . Hence, the dynamics display a biphasic behaviour qualitatively analogous to the empirical observations [74, 75] . Actually, all models where compensatory mutations are explicitly included permit to recover higher fitness states in the population, and to escape extinction. As a side effect, biphasic evolution is observed whenever the initial fitness of the population is far from the average stationary fitness at the corresponding statistically stationary state. This is so even when bottlenecks, and thus strong fluctuations in the population size, are systematically applied. As we know now empirically, compensatory mutations are indeed one of the main mechanisms to maintain high fitness.",

By means of numerical simulations, it was shown that vertically transmitted pathogens suffer decreases in fitness much stronger than when transmission is horizontal. A similar model was numerically [74] and analytically [83] studied in order to understand the appearance of biphasic behaviour and, in particular, of the large fluctuations in the viral yield described in Section 2.3. Additional parameters of this model are the size of bottlenecks and the development time between their application [84] . Increases in the number of individuals going through the bottleneck implies that the average fitness at the statistically stationary state increases, as experimentally observed [95] . The development time determines the distance to the mutation-selection equilibrium and constrains the degree of heterogeneity of the population before the bottleneck.",
