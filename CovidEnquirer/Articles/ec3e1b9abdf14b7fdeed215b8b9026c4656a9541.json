Prior systematic reviews examined contact precautions as part of a larger bundled approach, limiting ability to understand their effectiveness. The aim of this review was to characterize the effectiveness of contact precautions alone against transmission of any MDRO among adult acute care patients. Directed by the Preferred Reporting Items for Systematic Reviews and Meta-Analyses statement, comprehensive searches of four electronic scientific literature databases were conducted for studies published in English from January 2004 to June 2014. Studies were included if interventional, original research, evaluating contact isolation precautions against MDRO transmission among inpatients. Searches returned 284 studies, six of which were included in the review. These studies measured four different MDROs with one study showing a reduction in transmission. Whereas studies were of high quality regarding outcome operationalization and statistical analyses, overall quality was moderate to low due to poor intervention description, population characterization and potential biases. Where compliance was measured (N \u00bc 4), it presented a threat to validity because it included select parts of the intervention, ranged from 21% to 87%, and was significantly different across study phases (N \u00bc 2). The poor quality of evidence on this topic continues to limit interpretation of these data. Hence, this conflicting body of literature does not constitute evidence for or against contact precautions. We recommend that researchers consider power calculation, compliance monitoring, nonequivalent concurrent controls when designing future studies on this topic.",

            "text": "In 2014, the World Health Organization (WHO) declared antimicrobial resistance a worldwide problem that requires urgent action. 1 The WHO's report states that most global regions have high rates of resistance to antimicrobial drugs among bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, Klebsiella pneumonia, and Escherichia coli, and that these bacteria are moreover frequently resistant to multiple antimicrobials. 1 Multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs) are considered to be serious threats to global security as infections with these organisms have higher mortality than those of non-drug-resistant strains, and are more difficult and costly to treat. 1e4 Therefore, identifying and employing effective techniques to control the spread of MDROs is of high importance to manage health outcomes and reduce healthcare costs. 3 Isolation precautions are the preferred technique to control transmission of pathogens with high morbidity, mortality, or epidemiological significance, but controversy remains regarding the effectiveness of isolation precautions. 3,5e10 This debate intensified following transmission of Ebola virus to healthcare workers despite use of isolation precautions. 11 Like Ebola virus, MDROs are spread through direct or indirect contact. 3 Therefore, contact precautions, which include isolation in a private room, if possible, and use of gowns and gloves, are recommended to reduce transmission of MDROs. 6 However, evidence regarding the effectiveness of contact precautions against MDRO transmission is limited in methodology and content. Prior studies have predominantly reported outbreak scenarios and therefore lack equivalent control group(s) and are subject to performance bias. 12, 13 Additionally, most have focused on meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) or vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE). 13 The effectiveness of contact precautions against emerging MDROs such as carbapenem-resistant Acinetobacter baumannii and b-lactamase-producing Enterobacteriaceae has not been established. 14, 15 More evidence may have become available regarding emerging MDROs since publication of previous reviews. Previous systematic reviews of this topic are similarly limited in the types of MDROs studied and outcomes measured, and have had mixed results. 13,16e18 More importantly, contact precautions in all of these reviews were grouped with other infection control practices such as active surveillance. 13,16e19 Thus, gaps in the literature exist regarding effects of contact precautions alone and against emerging MDROs. 14, 15 The objective of this systematic review is to characterize the effectiveness of contact isolation precautions alone against transmission of any MDRO among adult patients from interventional studies in which contact precautions are not included bundled with other interventions. In order to increase consistency between included studies and to better isolate the effect of contact precautions, this review focuses on acute care, as other settings such as skilled nursing facilities have different potential for infection transmission. 20 ",

These fundamental differences prevented meaningful use of metaanalysis to evaluate the effectiveness of contact precautions against MDRO transmission. The small number of studies included in the review and difficulty in identifying and locating unpublished studies also precluded us from an assessment of publication bias. 33 ",

Two papers described the intervention by citing CDC guidelines. 29, 30 Variations to these practices and/or additional descriptions regarding the intervention were single-room isolation alone, staff cohorting, regular environmental cleaning and/or environmental cleaning at discharge and reserving healthcare devices (e.g. stethoscopes) for each infected patient. 27, 28, 31 Most studies (N \u00bc 5) compared the effectiveness of contact precautions with the effectiveness of another infection control intervention. 27e31 These included universal gloving, gowning without moving infected individuals to private rooms, and cohorting patients and staff. 27e31 Cohen et al. also included two additional phases of cohorting, which were increased surveillance in the ICU (phase 3) and active surveillance in the emergency department (phase 4). 27 Bearman et al. also performed active surveillance, but it was not clear who was subject to screening. 29 One study compared contact isolation precautions against no intervention to prevent transmission of MDRO colonization or infection. 32 In most of the studies, the authors initiated isolation precautions at the time of a positive MDRO culture (i.e. isolation was not pre-emptive) and the precautions were initiated for either colonization or infection. 29e32 Some protocols included cohorting nurse staff members to care for the MDRO-positive patients. 27, 28, 31 One study mentioned that it was possible for patients to be removed from isolation if the patient was MDROnegative for six months. 27 None of the publications included how long patients were observed to detect occurrence of the outcome. One publication noted that patients who were present during a study phase change were subsequently treated with the intervention of the new phase. 31 Five studies used pretests and post-tests to compare interventions in the different phases, though most aggregated results by phase or by year. 27,28,30e32 Authors of one study compared MDRO infection rates between the pretest (phase 1) and the removed-treatment phase (phase 2), and phase 2 to the following phase where contact precautions were reintroduced (phase 3). 32 Another study included a concurrent group, though this was a non-equivalent control as MRSA incidence managed with contact precautions was compared to extended spectrum beta-lactamase (ESBL)-producing organism incidence managed with standard precautions (i.e. a different outcome was measured in each group). 28 Outcomes MDROs of interest in the included papers were MRSA, VRE, carbapenem-resistant Klebsiella pneumonia (CRKP), and drug-resistant A. baumannii. 27e32 Three studies included measures of more than one MDRO: VRE and MRSA as primary outcomes and EBSL-producing organisms. 28e30 All of the papers' primary outcomes included colonization with the pathogen of interest in addition to active infection. However, screening procedures to identify cases differed substantially. One study tested the roommates, providers, and immediate environment of active cases to track pathogen spread (active, snowball sampling); another swabbed all patients for MDROs within 24 h of admission, weekly, at discharge, and as clinically indicated. 27, 31 Two studies tested participants on admission and then every four days or as clinically indicated; the other two tested for MDRO when deemed clinically necessary. 28e30,32",

One study investigating contact precautions for A. baumannii colonization or infection compared against no intervention demonstrated a reduction in the number of cases in phases where isolation precautions were implemented. 32 Limitations of this review are that it does not include papers published in languages other than English or grey literature. As with all literature reviews, it is also subject to publication bias. However, our findings are consistent with previous literature. De Angelis and colleagues combined results of three studies (including Bearman et al. 29 ) in a fixed effects model, despite differences in study interventions, and concluded that contact precautions were not effective against VRE acquisition. 16 Another limitation of our review, shared by previous literature, may be a failure to address droplet or airborne transmission of these bacteria, which may explain inconsistent effectiveness of contact precautions. 36 However, study quality regarding low compliance rates, bias and confounding, and failure to adjust for confounders and/or confirm equivalency between pre-and post-test groups, preclude ability to draw strong conclusions from this evidence base regardless of these studies' findings. 12",

Conflicting data from studies with poor design and/or low compliance does not constitute evidence against contact precautions; rather, these data are inconclusive. Whereas the study that performed best on our quality score found no significance between contact precautions and not isolating patients, this study did not consistently assess intervention compliance in the various study phases. 31 The included study that showed a difference in MDRO transmission with use of contact precautions did not report compliance rates and could not be assessed for quality on any of the other bias and confounding items of the quality assessment tool. 32 Inconsistencies and absences in compliance monitoring and reporting make it impossible to tell whether protocols were completed as intended, threatening the internal validity of these studies. 34 The CDC recently faced similar difficulty interpreting health outcomes after two healthcare workers were infected with Ebola virus in Texas, as it was unclear whether transmission had been due to inadequate isolation precaution protocols or to a protocol breach. 37 In practice, healthcare facilities should be regularly monitoring compliance, and investigating potential lapses when crosstransmission is documented, to potentially resolve systemsbased inefficiencies. It is also important for researchers to monitor and report compliance to understand what effectiveness level can be reasonably expected in practice where compliance may be lower than in clinical studies. Given the quality of evidence presented here, it may be advisable that healthcare workers and administrators continue to devote focus and resources to improve components of contact precautions and other infection prevention techniques with strong effectiveness evidence, such as hand hygiene technique and compliance. 3 ",

First, two of the included papers contained a power calculation. 29, 31 As MDRO infections are rare events and most studies on this topic include small patient samples due to feasibility and cost concerns, future studies should also conduct a calculation to determine whether the study is adequately powered to detect differences in infection rates between intervention phases. 12 Second, four of the included studies attempted to control for time trends in healthcare-associated infections and other confounders through statistical analysis. 27, 28, 31, 32 A concurrent, non-equivalent control, such as in Cheng et al., may address this issue, but concurrent controls are not always feasible. In the future, longitudinal studies with multiple pre-intervention collection points could add even stronger evidence by directly measuring and accounting for infection trends that are not related to the intervention, as in Bearman et al. 38 Third, these studies differ from most previous publications by attempting to monitor intervention compliance. 12, 39 Previous studies that monitored compliance demonstrated improved adherence (i.e. with hand hygiene) when an isolation precautions intervention was implemented. 40, 41 However, this was not consistent with levels of compliance reported in the studies reviewed here. 28e31 Low compliance with contact precautions could be the reason that this intervention appears to be equally or less effective than other interventions. 31 This body of evidence demonstrates the implementation of a number of improvements in study design which, when combined in future studies, may yield substantially stronger evidence.",

Whereas benefits of isolation precautions are uncertain, adverse consequences of isolation precautions to the isolated individual, such as increased depression, anxiety, and anger, are well documented. 42, 43 A number of papers returned in our search discussed negative consequences associated with isolation, but none of the included papers incorporated patient-centred measures such as anxiety and depression. 10,12,39,43e45 Considering that patient isolation is relatively resource intensive compared to other infection prevention activities, cost-utility analyses in future studies may be a good option to incorporate health outcomes, patient preferences, and costs to evaluate the effectiveness of contact isolation precautions against MDRO infection. 46 ",
