In six provinces of China, the monthly numbers of reported cases of seven infectious diseases (hemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome, hepatitis A, bacillary dysentery, Meningococcal Meningitis, malaria, measles, and pulmonary tuberculosis) were collated to develop early warning models with the definition of epidemic determined by epidemiologists. The metrics of sensitivity, specificity, and positive predictive values of different methods were compared with ROC curves, and the moving percentile method (MPM) and its parameters was optimized for detecting infectious disease outbreaks. In 2006, the research team developed and finalized the infectious diseases automated-alert information system, and formulated a standardized protocol of signal response (China CDC, 2008a) .",

At the beginning of 2010, in consideration of the hand, foot, and mouth disease (HFMD) epidemic and the need for ensuring health at Shanghai World Expo, the research team developed HFMD early warning method in CIDARS. In Dec. 2010, the research team again made substantial improvement to the temporal model of the alert system: implementing single case early warning for measles while aligning with the national measles elimination initiative, and modifying 134 PART 2 Practices and Implementation of Early Warning the warning thresholds for certain diseases; meanwhile, different areas were allowed to flexibly determine warning thresholds appropriate for local situations, which further enhanced the ability of CIDARS in detecting outbreaks.",

EARS-3Cs method is based on CUSUM formula and it calculates the expected value by date. According to the characteristics of HFMD incidence, CIDARS optimized the design of the method. Based on the method testing and effectiveness comparison of data on HFMD cases and incidents from May 2, 2008 to Mar. 20, 2010 in six provinces (Hebei, Liaoning, Guangdong, Shandong, Chongqing, and Gansu), EARS-C3 method (threshold value: 1.3) was selected for HFMD outbreaks early detection, and HFMD was officially incorporated into CIDARS in May 2010 throughout China.

Firstly, notifiable infectious diseases are subject to powerful legal support and administrative binding effect, health facilities and medical workers at all levels are highly aware of diagnosing and reporting infectious diseases, and the stability of surveillance systems and the quality of data are more assuring than other sources. Secondly, notifiable infectious diseases are directly reported via Internet in China, which has significantly shortened the duration from diagnosis of infectious diseases to Internet-based reporting to less than 1 day on average and has created a favorable condition for early detection of infectious disease outbreaks. Additionally, surveillance data of notifiable infectious diseases contain the demographical and geolocation data of each patient. After receiving warning signals, local epidemiological surveillance staff can quickly check information related to individual patients, so as to verify warning signals and identify and track patients in a timely fashion.",

Compared to previous manual analysis 158 of surveillance data, CIDARS significantly increases the frequency of data processing and analysis, and potentially reduces the workload of local staff in data analysis and aberration judgment. CIDARS also leverages international concept and framework for the design of alert system, and has completed and standardized work flow, including data processing and quality control, data aberration detection model operation, signal generation and sending, signal response and result feedback. Moreover, epidemiological surveillance staff at all levels adopt common procedures to implement early warning and response, enabling more standardized detection, identification and response to infectious disease outbreak warning signals. In addition, initial verification of warning signals is very simple. Most signals can be quickly excluded just by browsing surveillance data or verifying them via phone calls.",

Moreover, the information system has been developed, centrally managed and maintained by China CDC. As system users, CDCs at provincial, city and county levels only need to receive alert SMS via designated mobile phones and don't need to create network hardware environment or develop extra software systems. Expenses for sending alert SMS are also covered by China CDC, substantially reducing the input of financial and human resources at grassroots levels.",

The MPM is more accurate in early warning of infectious diseases subject to frequent outbreak, prevalence or case clustering, but is less accurate in early warning of infectious diseases subject to rare outbreaks. Therefore, warning thresholds of existing early warning methods can be optimized for individual diseases according to their respective geographic distribution, morbidity level and infectivity.",
