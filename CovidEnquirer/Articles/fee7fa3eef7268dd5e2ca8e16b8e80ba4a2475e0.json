One potential means of preventing this is for the patent holders to enter into a so-called patent pool, such as those established in the electronics and telecommunications industries. Precedents for these also exist in the field of genetics, notably with the patents pertaining to the SARS genome. In this review, we initially address the patent pool concept in general and its application in genetics. Following this, we will explore patent pools in the diagnostic field in more detail, and examine some existing and novel examples of patent pools in genetics.",

In the absence of a patent pool, licensees have to enter into negotiations with all the patent holders, which is a time consuming and expensive process.

The Organization for Economic Co-operation and Development (OECD; www.oecd.org) considers the concept of a patent pool to be an interesting one for biotechnology but has some doubts as to whether the technologies and markets for genetic inventions are amenable to patent pools [20] . The medical biotechnology industry is perceived as fundamentally different from the electronics and telecommunications sectors, particularly as the generation of standards, as used in electronics and telecommunications, for the interoperability of electronic devices is seen as a strong incentive for setting up a patent pool. In the absence of this type of standard-driven incentive, dominant players in the biotech industry might be reluctant to join a pool because there is no apparent gain. Additionally, biotech companies rely heavily on their patent portfolio, and foster what has been called a bunker mentality: a defensive attitude focused on self-protection and secrecy [19] . In light of these considerations, the OECD recommends further study [20] . In the meantime, some valuable contributions to the debate, which focus on the importance of standard setting for diagnostic testing, have been reported [21, 22] .",

In the Golden Rice case, Potrykus succeeded in genetically enriching rice grains with b-carotene, the precursor to vitamin A, which gives them a yellow hue: hence, they are called Golden Rice. Potrykus wanted to transfer the Golden Rice materials to developing countries for further breeding, and to introduce the trait into the local varieties consumed in developing countries. However, a freedom-to-operate survey initially uncovered 70 patents, belonging to 32 different companies and universities, embedded in Golden Rice. The six key-patent holders were approached, and an agreement was reached that allowed Potrykus to grant licenses, free of charge, to developing countries, with the right to sub-license (press releases 16 May 2000; 22 January 2001; and 14 October 2004; see www.syngentia. com). Consequently, a humanitarian board (HumBo; www. goldenrice.org) was established as a voluntary association to assist in the associated governance and decision making [25] . So far, approximately 20 master licenses have been granted to institutions in developing countries in Asia (Anatole F. Krattiger, personal communication).",

Two groups are credited with discovering the SARS genome, independently from each other [31, 32] , and several of the contributing laboratories filed patent applications incorporating SARS genomic sequence data. Further research then led to the filing of additional patent applications by a multitude of public and private sector entities [30] . The WHO set up a SARS consultation group, who proposed 'that a strategy be developed, in consultation with stakeholders, to address potential SARS corona virus related intellectual property issues and, thus, enhance development of intervention approaches'. At present, the relevant parties have been identified, and principal agreement has been gained, officially, by the signing of a letter of intent. Highly qualified technical and legal experts have assisted the parties during the chain of negotiations. The resulting pool, should the parties conclude a full agreement, will be set-up in the USA, followed by attempts to set up pools elsewhere [30] .",

In some cases, such as hereditary non-polyposis colorectal cancer (HNPCC), the disease can be caused by a variety of mutations in one gene, or by one or more mutations in several genes. The diagnosis of HNPCC in a particular family is, in part, based on molecular genetic testing for germline mutations in one of the mismatch-repair (MMR) genes. Typically, patients are being tested for mutations in two or more out of four candidate genes (MLH1, MSH2, MSH6, and PMS2; see review of HNPCC on www. genetests.org). However, other genes involved in the MMR pathway have been reported to be associated with HNPCC (e.g. MLH2, MLH3, PMS1, MSH3, MSH5, MYH; see OMIM entries on http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/entrez/ query.fcgi?dbZOMIM), and the number of genes identified as being involved in familial colorectal cancer is expected to grow. Some of these newly identified genes might soon be included on the shortlist for routine testing, and, as various patents have been filed, it is possible that overlapping patents might occur on the genetic data necessary to test for HNPCC. Should a patent thicket arise, an HNPCC patent pool, encompassing essential genomic patents, could help to eliminate the thicket and render proprietary genomic data more accessible for use. Additionally, such a patent pool should be considered a dynamic model with regard to both size and use, whereby the size and content of the pool will differ over time: competition law requires that additional essential patents, once granted, will enter the pool (e.g. relating to other genes with a role in the same pathology and on particular mutations in those genes) and others will disappear when no longer valid. Furthermore, the granting of licenses to a subset of patents should also be possible. Here, some genetic laboratories offering testing for the clinical condition as a whole might be interested in the entire pool, whereas other laboratories might only be interested in a license to a subset of patents in the pool, a subset of disease genes or mutations (which are of specific interest in view of the geographical heterogeneity of the distribution of mutations), a specific gene, or a particular mutation for the development of an antibody or another therapeutic or research tool. In addition, the licenses granted by the pool should be non-exclusive and nondiscriminatory, thereby imposing fair and reasonable conditions and royalty rates.",

Standards can be an important trigger to set up a pool, as illustrated in the electronics and telecommunications sectors, and this might also be true in the field of genetics [20, 21] . A genetic standard should not necessarily be looked at in terms of a technical specification but could present itself as a set of mutations recognized by the international scientific community. Alternatively, it could reflect national or international best practice guidelines for genetic testing for a particular disease, such as the standards and guidelines issued by the American College of Medical Genetics (www.acmg.net) for cystic fibrosis [34] or Huntington's disease [35] -such guidelines could facilitate the establishment of corresponding patent pools. They could also be an important asset in the dissemination of knowledge of patent coverage for genetic inventions, and could promote the collection of licensing fees.",

At present, owners of genetic patents predominantly provide licenses to companies developing commercial kits and to large diagnostic laboratories. Patent pools might constitute the ideal means for raising the visibility and accessibility of smaller or public genetic laboratories and, thus, increase the actual amount of collected royalties, bridging the gap between potential and actual revenue. For example, some laboratories still use in-house methods to test for cystic fibrosis, although several appropriate kits are available commercially. For some genes, the diagnostic method for the detection of mutations is less amenable to the production of a commercial kit, which is presently the case for breast and ovarian cancer, tuberous sclerosis and neurofibromatosis. In such instances, litigation is difficult because data informing on the number of tests being performed are hard to find and legal action is costly; however, the introduction of one-stop licenses, through the establishment of patent pools, might promote a spontaneous registration by the users and simplify the collection of license fees.",

If not, a compulsory patent pool, in which the administering body would seek a compulsory license for essential technology from all patent holders that do not voluntarily engage in the pool, could be further investigated.
