However, given the biological complexity of disease systems, the traditional ENM framework requires reevaluation. We provide an overview of the application of ENM to disease systems and propose a theoretical framework based on the biological properties of both hosts and parasites to produce reliable outputs resembling disease system distributions. Additionally, we discuss the differences between biological considerations when implementing ENM for distributional ecology and epidemiology.

As human activities intensify, contact with wildlife and exposure to novel parasites increase, potentially driving zoonotic disease emergence [1, 7] . Given the threat that EIDs pose to human populations, understanding the underlying drivers of parasite geographic distribution and their spillover to humans is particularly relevant for epidemiologists, public-health practitioners, and policy makers [9] .",

We provide an overview of the current state of disease ENM and propose a framework based on the biological properties of both parasites and hosts to produce reliable outputs resembling disease systems distributions. Specifically, our theoretical framework: (i) addresses the selection of an appropriate modeling approach and highlights the importance of including biologically sound predictor variables; (ii) proposes the concept of a microscale parasitic niche defined by host traits to identify relevant parasite-host associations; and (iii) integrates traditional parasite ENM with the proposed microscale niche to better understand geographic distributions and improve fine-scale predictions of disease transmission risk.",

Ecological interactions are hypothesized to affect species distributions only locally (i.e., the Eltonian noise hypothesis [10] ) and are usually considered irrelevant in traditional coarse-scale ENM applications [10, 21] . However, growing evidence suggests that biotic interactions may have a larger role in shaping broad-scale species distributions, especially under changing conditions (e.g., climate change) [10, [22] [23] [24] . For example, continental-scale distributions of the North American warbler are better explained when coupling biotic interactions (e.g., vegetation requirements) with abiotic factors (climate data) [23] . Biotic interactors can be included in ENM by incorporating interacting species as predictor variables (preprocessing), restricting the distribution of the focal species to regions where interactions may occur (post-processing), and linking demographic population models to the final ENM [10, [25] [26] [27] .",

Black-box approaches model the overall geographic distribution of a final manifestation of host-parasite interactions (e.g., disease outbreaks), assuming that this outcome summarizes all biotic interactions involved in transmission [28] [29] [30] . This approach provides a pragmatic framework to generalize disease distributions and is useful when transmission dynamics are poorly understood and data are limited, which is frequently the case for EIDs [31] . However, the black-box oversimplification may be perilous as it neglects ecological complexity (e.g., the identity of key host species for transmission). Alternatively, component-based approaches consider the individual ecologies of all species involved in disease transmission (e.g., parasites, hosts) [16, 17, 32] . This approach allows the identification of host species and prioritization of areas for disease surveillance and control. Component-based approaches require in-depth knowledge of the disease system (e.g., the identity and ecologies of relevant species, transmission cycle), which may not be readily Glossary Allee effect: correlation between population size or density and the per capita growth rate (mean individual fitness) of a population.

This has led to the widespread use of black-box modeling for disease outbreaks [28] [29] [30] and component-based modeling of hosts only [17, 32] . The use of outbreak data to model disease distributions raises methodological issues. Disease data are generally aggregated at coarse politicoadministrative levels (e.g., province, country), losing crucial information on the local natural history of the disease [1, 33] . Additionally, the geographic site of infection and the associated uncertainty are generally not reported and may instead refer to the health-care facility where it is diagnosed [1] , potentially misleading the identification of ecological conditions favoring disease occurrence. This could be further complicated by centralized health-care infrastructures and scarce epidemiological resources, resulting in predictions of the site of diagnosis instead of the site of infection and parasite persistence [34] . Lack of information on the ecology of a disease system may hinder proper identification of the parasite species (or strain in the case of viruses) causing the disease and/or the hosts involved in their transmission. This is particularly true for EIDs [31] , posing a significant challenge to the prediction of geographic distributions in an ENM framework.",

For example, host species living at higher population densities with smaller body sizes and shorter generation spans were more likely to be competent reservoirs for multihost vector-borne diseases [37] . Likewise, host species diversity was found to alter transmission by decreasing host density (i.e., dilution effect) and increasing contact rates between host species (i.e., amplification effect) in a rodent-borne disease [45] . Host immunity and parasite-parasite interactions may also shape disease distributions as they may facilitate or limit transmission [6, 7, 41, 46] . For instance, decreased competence of the bacterium Rickettsia conorii was observed in dogs previously infected by other Rickettsia species [47] . Given the complexity of these interactions, traditional single-species ENM approaches could fail to accurately predict disease distributions and transmission risk, particularly at finer scales. However, traditional approaches may be sufficient for some disease systems, especially if they are simple or well understood (e.g., dengue). Therefore, appropriate selection of the approach will depend on data availability and the question at hand.",

Therefore, host presence should be considered only as 'vessels' available for parasite introduction, establishment, and spread (Box 1).

That is, estimated host distributions are used as a proxy for potential parasite distributions. Selection of host species (e.g., identity, number) for modeling will depend on their role in the disease system as well as the nature of the system itself. If parasite persistence depends on interactions between different host species, stacked or joint host distribution models (post-processing) can be used, assuming parasite presence is equal or more likely in areas where all of its hosts are found than where only one host species is found [24] . Likewise, seasonal factors capable of affecting transmission (e.g., rainfall, migration patterns) should be accounted for whenever possible. However, excessive use of abiotic and biotic variables could generate over-fit and complex models, which may be difficult to parameterize and interpret. (3) Unavailable occurrence data and unknown transmission mechanism: This situation warrants black-box modeling [18] . The point-radius method can be used to mitigate geographic uncertainty inherent to human disease data [91] . Additionally, to reduce uncertainty in environmental dimensions, outlying disease cases reported in areas of inconsistent environmental conditions (e.g., imported cases) can be removed. Due to the temporal lag between infection and disease expression, temporal uncertainty of exposure should be considered to ensure that environmental variables match disease reports. North America can result in hantavirus pulmonary syndrome, which is often fatal in humans while having no discernible impact on deer mice (Peromyscus maniculatus), its primary host [46] . Host immunity, genetics, and physiology also play important roles in disease expression, varying among individuals [6, 49, 53] and populations [54] . The generalist amphibian chytrid fungus (Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis) can cause disease in some amphibian species but not others; thus, mapping a single host would underestimate the parasite's geographic distribution ( Figure 1B) .",

For example, in the tropics, altitude could serve as a proxy for temperature and has been used to predict the distribution of mosquito-borne diseases, since vector distribution is restricted by low temperatures.

Further complications arise when hosts act as bridges facilitating parasite transmission between spatially disjoint host populations ( Figure 2C ,D) [38] . For example, wild birds associated with wetlands and aquatic environments, such as shorebirds (Charadriiformes; gulls, terns, and waders) and waterfowl (Anseriformes; ducks, geese, and swans), constitute the host reservoir for avian influenza ( Figure 2C ). Since shorebirds and livestock are spatially disjunct ( Figure 2D) , strategies aimed at this group only would not stop influenza transmission from waterfowl to livestock and consequent human infection, despite them being part of the reservoir.",

HIV infection, for example, facilitates the establishment of other parasitic organisms including viruses, bacteria [65] , and protozoa [68] . A H comprises the set of physical and chemical (e.g., body temperature, pH, presence of cell receptors in the membrane) host traits representing suitable conditions for establishment and persistence with generally unidirectional effects on parasite load [6, 26, 36, 41, 64] . For example, rabies virus can survive only in hosts with a specific body temperature range (4-39 C) [58] , resulting in a predominance of mammalian hosts (37 C) but not birds (40 C) . Similarly, SARS coronavirus cannot infect cells lacking angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), its entry receptor [69] . Last, M H represents the set of host species populations that have been accessible for the parasite to disperse (i.e., transmit). Transmission between individuals is essential to guarantee parasite maintenance [also expressed as basic reproductive number (R 0 ) > 1] in a host population (i.e., intraspecies transmission) or community (i.e., interspecies transmission). Although dispersal-related parasite traits (e.g., free living vs host restricted) are important determinants of transmissibility, parasite mobility can be further constrained by host demography and ecology [18, 70] ; however, these traits may be less relevant for parasites with environmental reservoirs (e.g., anthrax). For example, parasite persistence may not be possible if the host population size is too small (similar to Allee effects). Social contact, grooming rate, or burrowing behavior limits the transmission of parasites (e.g., fleas in small mammals) [71] . Factors constraining transmission can operate across multiple spatial scales, ranging from limited dispersal between individuals in a population (e.g., decreased host population size for density-dependent transmission) to barriers between host populations (e.g., geographic barriers). Parasites may be absent in suitable hosts due to local parasite extinction, seasonality (e.g., host migration patterns, precipitation patterns needed for parasite transmission), dispersal, or transmission limitations (e.g., geographic barriers, low host density, host immunity) and in the case of economically important hosts (e.g., livestock) due to disease management control (e.g., vaccination, disease control programs). Transient infections could also occur in dead-end hosts (H DE ) ( Figure 3B ,C), unsuitable hosts limiting their persistence (R 0 1; i.e., sink populations). Our approach is complementary to traditional parasite ENM and classic transmission models. By identifying parasite host breadth, BAM-H would allow the proper identification of relevant biotic interactors that inform parasite ENM and should therefore be used jointly (Figure 3 ).",

The identification of closely related hosts (i.e., sharing similar traits) could help to identify potential reservoirs and predict potential spillover (H P ), analogous to predicting suitable geographic areas (novel hosts) for species invasion (parasite spillover) in invasion ecology. Parasite sharing among closely related host species (phylogenetic clustering) could be interpreted as parasite niche conservatism in host-space [as observed in kissing bug species (Triatoma sp.) in North and Central America] [77] . Potential hosts (H P ) would therefore be more likely to be closely related to known hosts. Conversely, parasite sharing among distantly related host species (phylogenetic overdispersion) implies that parasite sharing among known hosts is driven by factors other than host relatedness, important to consider when determining H P . Such factors may include broad physiological tolerances (large A H ) or increased transmissibility (M H ) between host populations with overlapping geographic ranges ( Figure 3C [36, 75] ). Furthermore, parasites may experience expansions in their occupied host breadth (H O ) following landscape alterations or shifts in their geographic distributions [75, 78] (see Box 3 for applications).",

Several often interacting factors such as behavior [59] , nutrition [86] , immune history [47] , and social status [33, 87, 88] are critical for successful parasite maintenance. When possible, these factors should be considered and incorporated into ENM frameworks to enrich risk assessments. Exposure can be incorporated by overlaying the geographic distribution and densities of the target population (e.g., humans) [14] . Susceptibility factors could be added by including information on socioeconomic (e.g., GDP, age) or cultural (e.g., taboo systems, traditional practices) factors influencing exposure to hazard. An example of susceptibility factors increasing exposure is the traditional funeral practices involving the touching and kissing of dead bodies that contributed to the spread of Ebola in the 2014 West African outbreak [59] .",

Improving Epidemiological Surveillance: Using Ecophylogenetics to Estimate Host Breadth Epidemiological surveillance aims to identify and monitor disease-causative agents and to use this information to inform public health policy. However, how can we possibly achieve these goals when we do not know which areas or host species should be targeted for surveillance? Ecophylogenetics provide a basis to disentangle the relative contributions of host relatedness (phylogeny) and host ecology (e.g., interaction networks, demography) to parasite-sharing patterns among different host populations ( Figure 3C [78] ). Integrating phylogenetics with community ecology could help in understanding patterns of host phylogenetic clustering and overdispersion across spatiotemporal scales. This holds great potential for the development of new tools to predict parasite host breadths (H P and H O in our proposed framework), a key component of understanding disease transmission dynamics at the landscape level [56, 77] . Additionally, ecophylogenetics may provide insights on potential spillover events that could result in disease emergence, a highly relevant topic under global change and increased international movement of species leading to shifts in host communities and translocation of parasites to new areas and hosts [79, 80] . Adoption of the host-space framework under ecophylogenetics could improve epidemiological surveillance, allowing early targeting of potentially suitable hosts (HP) [62, 63] .",

Investment in active surveillance efforts in wildlife and human populations, as well as new technologies and tools (Box 3) for parasite detection and identification techniques, may improve our ability to collect more reliable disease occurrence data. Interdisciplinary approaches integrating ecology and social sciences may further our understanding on how biological and socioeconomic factors interact to influence disease risk.",

We described how biotic interactions make disease systems more ecologically complex than the traditional biodiversity studies for which ENM was designed. Limited knowledge on disease natural history (e.g., transmission mechanism, host species involved) may considerably change modeling assumptions, resulting in ecologically unrealistic outputs. Here, we present a new frameworkthe host-space nichethat is complementary to traditional parasite ENM, which should improve the integration of parasite-host interactions. This host-space niche framework will help in identifying relevant biotic interactors and understanding disease distributions across landscapes.",

However, challenges remain, particularly ensuring that disease occurrence data reflect the site of infection and the biological realism of model assumptions. Increased epidemiological surveillance and data sharing via online repositories will facilitate the establishment of a renovated field of disease mapping based on ecological theories. We provide guidelines (Box 1) to estimate the geographic distribution of diseases via ENM by accounting for data limitations and different ecological scales. The incorporation of biotic interactors into the models will allow more realistic estimates of disease distributions that could help to guide cost-effective disease control efforts.",

In this example, interspecific transmission (spillover) of the parasite among wild and domestic bird species, and among bird and mammal species, has resulted in human infection.

Traditional ENM applications consider the B component to have negligent effects (the Eltonian noise hypothesis [10]) when modeling species' geographic distributions under the BAM framework. However, biotic interactions play a critical role in parasitic relationships in nature, so they should be considered with caution in disease ecology. Implementing a traditional ENM framework [i.e., A \\ M (Figure IIB)] to map the distribution of dengue virus in Guatemala provides different predictions than a model accounting for biotic interactions [B \\ A \\ M (Figure IIC)].
