Whether this happens at the local, state/provincial, regional, national or international level, the basic tenets remain consistent. One aim is to facilitate tourism interactions between individuals and, it is hoped, lay the groundwork for peace through authentic social relationships. Tourism is part of the growing international trade-in-service, travel-sector industries. As such, it has the potential to be an important stimulant for future improvement in the economic, political, sociocultural and ecological dimensions of people's lives. Combining the elements of creating economic income with the potential to foster greater international understanding and goodwill, tourism holds promise for serving as a vehicle for peace throughout the world. This supports the lofty view that the highest purpose of tourism policy can be to balance its benefits and costs for communities as tourism destinations and to improve the quality and sustainability of life for local citizens. Tourism as a policy for peace is presented in Chapter 5.",

The Code further states that 'provided a number of principles and a certain number of rules are observed' it should be possible to reconcile tourism in its increasingly prominent role in the services industry with contending issues in international trade such that all stakeholders in tourism development -'with different albeit interdependent responsibilities rights and duties' -will contribute collectively to this aim.

This can occur at any level of stakeholders in the desired outcome -from local citizens to relations between and among nations. A rapid rise in tourist visits to popular 'gateway' or entry communities, whether the US National Forests in Colorado or Arizona or to cultural heritage sites such as Machu Picchu, Peru (shown in Figure 3 .1), have fostered unplanned tourism development. This has led to unexpected needs for formative tourism policies to cope with increased road congestion and pollution, potable water over-consumption, public utility resources depletion and real estate price escalation resulting in a scarcity of affordable housing for local citizens employed in the new hotels, car rental agencies and other travel-related businesses. As a result, tourism development revenues are not equally distributed. Furthermore, these overly popular original destinations then become degraded, putting at risk their inherent environmental, sociocultural and heritage values important to both tourism and local level quality of life. Thus, a well-known, mature tourism destination such as Machu Picchu must, for the sake of its own future success as a world heritage destination, reformulate its tourism policies regarding the sustainability of its infrastructure and provision of quality tourism products and services.",

A powerful example of this at the tourism organization and destination management levels is provided by the 11 September 2001, terrorist airplane attacks in the United States on the New York City World Trade Center towers and the US Pentagon outside Washington, DC. Bill Hanbury, president of the Washington DC Convention and Visitors Corporation, was confronted by a 'new' and historic event in the United States that, at large, severely affected travel to and within the United States and the District of Columbia (DC). The US east coast suffered region-wide telephone outages on September 11 preventing President Hanbury's communication with his own employees as well as with DC public officials. Within days after September 11, he developed an unplanned, unanticipated formative tourism policy methodology for the creation of a reliable, networked alternative emergency information communication system encompassing the DC convention centre and US national capital region as a whole. The true value of this formative phase tourism policy for heightened communication preparedness fortunately to date has not been measurable in a comparable emergency situation (Hanbury, 2002) . This underscores the challenge in data collection in conducting formative phase tourism policy research.",

            "text": "Similarly, development phase tourism policy analysis is extremely important in many instances as it enables evaluation of policy implementation midstream. In 1999, for example, the Government of Belize established a new tourism policy placing high priority on tourism as a preferential development option with a focus on the cruise ship sector. In addition to international tourism promotion to Belize, the results also included a development phase tourism policy plan for environmental compliance for live-aboard passenger vessels, including cruise ships visiting Belize Harbour. It was premised on reassurances to Belize local tourism industry stakeholders that efforts would be made by the Department of the Environment in conjunction with the Fisheries Department and Belize Tourism Board to ensure the sustainability of the Belize tourism industry as a whole. New tourism policy rules and regulations were developed covering such issues as anchoring of cruise ships, waste disposal and passenger recreational activities onboard, such as requiring the purchase of seasonal fish and locally grown produce versus imported food. Onshore, tourism policy rules included requirements for the preservation of coral reefs during tourist diving and snorkeling activities, among others. As the cruise industry to Belize progresses, a monitoring system put in place now assists in a review and ongoing assessment of the effectiveness of the tourism development intentions of the tourism policy plan (Toy, 2004) .",

This phase often provides the most available opportunities for semester-long student tourism policy case studies and/or research projects. For example, when the citizens of the US State of Colorado in 1994 voted to oppose the continuation of an existing state tax for state tourism marketing, Colorado fell in three years from the top five to 17th place in US state travel destinations (Sommars, 1997, pp. 16-21) . Only a short duration was required for summative evaluation of the adverse results of the tax policy eliminating funding for tourism marketing and promotion to Colorado. Summative phase tourism policy research requires that evaluation questions be matched with appropriate information gathering techniques, the data collected and analysed, and tourism policy information and advice provided to public and private sector officials and other interested parties.",

With aviation air rights, it is a function, in a sense, of who owns the air and what means are used to protect the citizens while allowing air traffic.

Currently, countries such as Thailand are experiencing an increase in tourism demand due to sex tourism (tourism activities which lead to sexual activity, particularly involving children). 'In 1998, the International Labour Organization reported its calculations that 2-14 per cent of the gross domestic product of Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines and Thailand derives from sex tourism. In addition, while Asian countries, including Thailand, India and the Philippines, have long been prime destinations for child sex tourists, in recent years, tourists have increasingly travelled to Mexico and Central America for their sexual exploits as well' (Nair, 2006) . Countries which are starved for hard foreign currency often look the other way as the cash flows in (Nair) . Western governments, including the United States, are now enacting laws which allow prosecution for sex tourism and the tourists despite the crimes taking place in foreign soil. Existing laws make it illegal to travel with the intent to have sex with a minor. Proposals for new laws that would make it illegal to have sex with a child in another country are now being pursued. Policy creation and implementation is complex and difficult to implement as the activities are international in scope, with victims and perpetuators coming from different countries. Further complicating this situation is the fact that each country, in many cases, has jurisdiction over only part of the criminal activity. To give more force to existing laws, a bill was introduced in the US Government on 28 April 2005, entitled the 'End Demand for Sex Trafficking Act of 2005.' The bill included a provision that would amend the language specifically to state that individuals engaging in sexual activity can be charged with a criminal offense as 'a purchaser of commercial sexual activities'. Passage of this amendment would clarify for federal prosecutors that enforcement of the law can and should be used to prosecute US-based sex tour operators (Equality Now, 2006) . Further efforts to eliminate child sex tourism are being pursued by the tourism industry itself.",

In some cases, the concerns for health are positive for the industry. For example, the rapid growth in the health spa industry has created an upscale niche in the travel-for-health market; however, other health concerns have a negative impact on the industry such as SARS, AIDS and other contagious diseases that are spread much more rapidly in part because of tourism and its related activities. Should one country be able to prohibit or strongly discourage travel to another nation and effectively cripple another country's economy? Policy decisions on limiting travel to countries with an epidemic may result in a significant downturn in travel overall and, in turn, affect the supporting travel and tourism infrastructure worldwide. The SARS epidemic affected travel to Asian nations with a ripple effect that resulted in lower Visa credit card use. The Asian market 'was significantly affected by the downturn in tourism prompted by the outbreak of SARS, but volume has been returning to normal there in recent weeks', Visa said (Lee, 2003, p. 20) .",

One of the contending issues, logically, is overall investment costs of which the launch itself is a large part. It is believed that the only potential means for significant reduction of the recurrent launch cost, which results in a stimulation of human space colonization, is to make the launcher reusable, to increase its reliability and to make it suitable for new markets such as mass space tourism. Space projects that have long-range aspects are very difficult to finance as all interested parties, even politicians, expect to see a reasonable benefit during their period of involvement or term in office. They want to be able to explain this investment to the investing companies or to the taxpayers. Planners are then forced to use benefit models instead of intuitive judgment to convince skeptical decision makers to support new investments in space. Benefit models provide insights into complex relationships and compel a better definition of goals and expected benefits to be gained from a new space venture.",

Understanding the interrelated nature of tourism industry sectors requires monitoring and evaluation when tourism policy issues are involved. Measurement and monitoring are essential to transportation systems that move people, products and services, which, in turn, make up a major component of the international tourism industry. Similarly, restaurants and entertainment organizations serve local residents and tourists alike and are involved in business activities (such as special events, conferences and meeting planning) that are demanded by both populations. This duality adds additional complexities to the planning process for simultaneous usage in areas accommodating both tourist and host community needs. Seasonal activities with peak period use, as in ski or beach resort locations, greatly benefit from tourism policy, planning, development and evaluation in understanding 'best use' growth and sustainability measures.",

Minas Gerais State in Brazil, for example, currently is experiencing minimal water contamination. This situation is expected to destabilize as water demands rise due to increases in tourism-related activities (increased influx of visitors accompanied by a growing residential workforce supporting the industry). Zoning to protect the natural resources, which in turn protects water quality, is being recommended. In Colorado, USA, zoning has been used in an effort to mediate the competing needs of the tourists and the local community. 'Over the past decade, county and city officials, tourism leaders and local ranchers in Routt County, Colorado, have worked together to preserve the remaining agricultural open space' (Parizzi et al., 2001, p. 57) . With a change in zoning laws, one county adopted regulations that encouraged clustering homes to preserve open space. Housing lot size requirements were reduced allowing developers to build more units using a smaller footprint overall. In exchange, the developers must set aside undeveloped land as open space. In other words, zoning concerns involve allocation of scarce land, public and private utility, and public support services and resources -what to put where and who to best undertake and accommodate tourism policy goals and objectives are important agenda items.",
