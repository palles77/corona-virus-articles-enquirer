Further, it is necessary to generate a common language to facilitate and promote inter-and transdisciplinary communication. Several concepts related to disease dynamics, such as outbreak, epidemics, and pan demics, are commonly used in a qualitative way. Yet, the creation of interdisciplinary databanks or the compilation of information from diverse sources (e.g., hydrological events and outbreak intensity) including historical ones would ben efit from objective category definitions.

Common diseases that occur at a constant but relatively low rate in the population are said to be 'endemic'. An example of an endemic disease is malaria in some parts of Africa, where a large portion of the population is expected to contract malaria at some point in their lifetime.

An increasing number of direct or indirect cases of water-borne diseases are due to global warming, increasing frequency and intensity of storms, flood control, and environmental management (dam construction, irriga tion, use of fertilizers, etc.), and this has greatly widened the spectrum of stakeholders with an interest in the use of water and its impact on health. This underlines the need for agree ment on and diffusion of definitions and criteria between users and managers to facilitate the quantification of impacts of disease, ecological damage, and poor sanitation, as well as for cost-benefit analysis of proposed prevention or remedia tion measures. The global burden of disease analysis (WHO, 2009) pro vides a comprehensive and comparable appraisal of mortality and loss of health due to diseases and injuries, and risk factors for all regions of the world. The overall burden of disease is assessed using the disability-adjusted life year (DALY), a timebased measure that combines years of life lost due to premature mortality and years of life lost due to time lived in states of less than full health. Worldwide, about 82 million DALYs per year are due to water-borne diseases (Pruess et al., 2002) . A relevant specific example is the definition and evaluation of the impact of disease related to drinking water quality. This concerns the presence of chemicals or pathogenic microorganisms that are transmitted when contaminated drinking water is directly con sumed. If contaminated drinking water is used in the preparation of food, it can be the source of food-borne disease through consumption of the same microorganisms, often in the form of gastrointestinal illnesses. According to the WHO (WHO, 2004a) , diarrheal disease accounts for an estimated 4.1% of the total DALY global burden of disease and is respon sible for the deaths of 1.8 million people every year. It is estimated that 88% of that burden is attributable to unsafe water supply, sanitation, and hygiene.",

In the United States, since 1971, the Centers of Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), Environmental Protection Agency, and the Council of State and Territorial Epidemiologists have maintained a collaborative surveillance system which monitors the occurrence and causes of water borne-disease outbreaks (WBDOs) (Calderon et al., 2002 ). The surveillance system includes data for outbreaks associated with drinking water and recreational water. State, territorial, and local public health departments are primarily responsible for detecting and investigating WBDOs and voluntarily reporting them to CDC on a standard form. The unit of analysis for the WBDO surveillance system is an outbreak, not an individual case of a water-borne disease. Two criteria must be met for an event to be defined as a WBDO. First, more than two persons must have experienced a similar illness after either ingestion of drinking water or exposure to water encountered in recreational or occupational settings. This cri terion is waived for single cases of laboratory-confirmed primary amebic meningoencephalitis and for single cases of chemical poisoning if water-quality data indicate contamina tion by the chemical.

Two-thirds of the remaining burden affects six countries: Brazil, Colombia, India, Solomon Islands, Sri Lanka, and Vietnam. The ecology of the disease is closely associated with the availability of water, as the larval stage of mosquitoes develops in different kinds of water bodies. The mosquito species vary considerably in their water-ecological require ments (sunlit or shaded, with or without aquatic vegetation, stagnant or slowly streaming, and fresh or brackish; discussed in Section 10.12.4.3.2.1), and this, to a great extent, determines the ecology of the disease. In many places, the nat ural habitat sustains intense malaria transmission; in others, the development of water resources (irrigation, dams, and urban water supply) has exacerbated the intensity of transmission and caused the disease to spread. In yet others, for example, the Central Asian Republics of the Commonwealth of Independent States, malaria has returned as a result of a breakdown in water management and maintenance problems of local irrigation systems (WHO, 1999) .",

            "text": "Climate change (global warming) appears to be moving the altitudinal limits of malaria to higher elevations, for example, in the East African highlands and Madagascar. Further, in some of the tropical regions of the developing world, the incidence of malaria has increased in recent years as the mosquito and the malaria parasite it transmits have evolved more resistance to Sewage, nontreated drinking water, flies in water supply (hand-to-mouth) Untreated water, poor disinfection, pipe leaks, groundwater pollution, sharing of water source by humans and wildlife. Beavers and muskrats create ponds that act as reservoirs for Giardia (oral-fecal, hand-to-mouth) Encephalitozoon intestinalis has been detected in groundwater Chills, period fever attacks; debility, spleen and liver enlargement; anemia, jaundice; clogging of brain vessels can lead to death Flu-like symptoms, watery diarrhea, loss of appetite, substantial loss of weight, bloating, increased gas, and nausea Abdominal pain, fatigue, weight loss, diarrhea, bloating, and fever Diarrhea, bloating abdominal discomfort, and flatulence Diarrhea and wasting in immunocompromised individuals alternatives to dichlorodiphenyltrichloroethane (DDT) and to the medications used to prevent or treat the disease. In some regions (e.g., South Africa), DDT is again increasingly used to control mosquitoes (Thurow, 2001) . In general, land reclama tion for agriculture, deforestation, and changes in land use are probably the principal causes of the climatic and habitat changes responsible for these developments. Yet, it should be borne in mind that it was the drainage of wetlands for agricul tural purposes in the nineteenth century which contributed most significantly to the eradication of malaria in Europe (Reiter, 2000) . These are crucial aspects to be carefully evaluated when wetland creation and management policy are being considered as an ecohydrological tool, for example, for sequestration of nutri ents in estuaries and for preventing toxic algal blooms. These issues will be discussed extensively in the following section (also discussed in Section 10.12.5.2). It is often erroneously thought that larvae of malariatransmitting mosquitoes can only develop in freshwater. It is also frequently forgotten that malaria is not restricted to the tropics, and that only in 1975 did the WHO declare that Europe was free of malaria. About 200 years ago, malaria was a leading cause of death in many marshland commu nities along the coast of southern England. There, extensive salt marshes provided high-quality grazing for sheep and cattle, but were also a favored habitat for Anopheles atroparvus, a highly effective malaria vector, which prefers to breed in brackish water along river estuaries and in the presence of abundant algae. Until the nineteenth century, malaria was a major mortality factor in The Netherlands. However, by the end of that century transmission had dropped precipitously in the more prosperous countries of North Europe. A major factor contributing to this decline was that the mosquito habitat had been eliminated by improved drainage and extensive land reclamation. Major epidemics still occurred in Russia and Poland in the 1920s, with high death rates reaching regions near the Arctic Circle (Wolanski et al., 2004 and references therein) .",

This spread of the disease has been attrib uted to, among other factors, forest clearance, irrigation, ecological change, population increase, deterioration of public health services, resistance of mosquitoes to insecticides, and resistance of the malarial parasite to antimalarial drugs (Reiter, 2000) . Thus, policies on wetland creation or restoration must take account of not only the benefits of the reestablishment of lost ecological services, but also the potential consequences of increased areas of slow-flowing or stagnant waters on disease vector proliferation, particularly under a scenario of increasing temperatures. The related ecohydrological concepts of system robustness and flushing dynamics can make a major contribu tion to the integrated analysis and handling of this issue, seeking equilibrium between the necessary water residence time, for example, efficient nutrient sequestration, and the minimization of mosquito reproduction. The choice cannot be formulated as 'mosquitoes in the basin' or 'toxic algal blooms in the estuary'.",

Also known as bilharzia, bilharziosis, or snail fever, it is caused by several species of fluke (trematode) of the genus Schistosoma. (Gryseels et al., 2006; Figure 3) . Infection with any of the five species of schistosome worms is rarely fatal. Although it has a low mortality rate, schistosomiasis is often a chronic illness that can damage internal organs and, in children, impair growth and cognitive development. The urinary form of schis tosomiasis is associated with increased risks for bladder cancer in adults (Hodder et al., 2000) . Human infections are most common in Asia, Africa, South America, or the Middle East, especially in areas where the water contains numerous fresh water snails, which are intermediate hosts, that is, may carry the parasite.

In China, the Danling Dam in the province of Sichuan and the Huangshi Dam in the province of Hunan have all had adverse effects by increasing local schistosome transmis sion (Zhang and Guo, 2006) . However, not all dam regions suffer from schistosomiasis. For example, when the Ertan Dam in the province of Sichuan became operational, local schistoso miasis control centers collaborated with dam management offices and government ministries to actively monitor and pre vent the spreading of schistosome worms. As a result of these efforts, potential schistosome transmissions in the Ertan region were successfully averted (Gu et al., 2001) . Schistosomiasis infection in humans, the definitive hosts, is caused mainly by three species of flatworm, namely Schistosoma haematobium, S. japonicum, and S. mansoni. Infection occurs when free-swimming larvae penetrate human skin. The larvae develop in freshwater snails, which serve as intermediate hosts for the parasite. Humans are infected when they enter larvaeinfested water for domestic, occupational, and recreational purposes and the larvae of the parasite penetrate the unbroken skin. The life cycle is continued when people infected with schistosome worms deposit urine or fecally borne eggs into the water. The disease particularly affects children who may acquire the disease by swimming or playing in infected water (Hodder et al., 2000) .",

After the eggs of the human-dwelling parasite are emitted in the feces, into the water, the ripe miracidium hatches out of the egg. The miracidium searches for a suitable freshwater snail to act as an intermediate host and penetrates it. Following this, the parasite develops, via a so-called mother-sporocyst and daughter-sporocyst generation, into the cercaria. The purpose of the growth in the snail is the numerical multiplication of the parasite. A single miracidium can produce several thousand cercaria, each one of which is capable of infecting humans. The cercaria propel themselves in water with the aid of their bifurcated tail and actively seek out their final host. When they recognize human skin, they penetrate it within a very short time. Following a migration through the body within the bloodstream, they develop into sexually mature adults. The larvae enter through the skin, migrate via the blood vessels, and mature in the lungs. From there they travel to the veins of the upper or lower intestine or bladder and, if they find a partner of the opposite sex, they reproduce. There are specific host/parasite combinations that lead to typical forms of bilhar ziasis in endemic areas in different regions of the world, frequently associated with a particular economic activity. There are also region-specific control measures with positive and negative consequences or side effects (Mannesmann and Fuchs, 2003) as discussed in Section 10.12.2.2.1.1.",

In Upper Egypt south of Cairo, it has been known for a long time that the shift from basin irrigation by the floodwaters of the Nile to perennial irrigation results in a dramatic increase in schistosomiasis. Basin irrigation allows the land to dry out seasonally, killing almost all snails. Under perennial irrigation, the land is wet all year round. Soon after the construction of Aswan Low Dam, four locations that changed irrigation methods in the mid-1930s experienced a surge in S. haematobium infections (Khalil and Abdel Azim, 1938; Khalil, 1949) . Infection rates increased from 2-11% in 1934 to 44-75% in 1937. Urinary schistosomiasis had a pre valence at 60% in areas of perennial irrigation in Upper Egypt and only 5% in areas with basin irrigation (Scott, 1937) . In the 1950s, prevalence ranged from 56% to 68% in three districts with perennial irrigation, while in two districts with basin irriga tion, it was 9% and 13% (Wright, 1973) .",

Farmers kept the canals filled with water from March to May, when they were previously dry (Fenwick, 1989) . Another factor was the creation of the adjoining Managil extension irrigation system which left tenants without adequate water supplies or sanitation facilities. Also, there was an influx of migrant laborers in the original Gezira scheme, who lived near irrigation canals, under very poor sanitary conditions, leading to the propagation of further water-borne diseases (Tameim et al., 1985) .",

Such activities can result in the sharing of water-contact sites and water-contact behavior, which expose all members of the household to an increased risk of infection. In previous studies in Brazil (Bethony et al., 2004) , it was deter mined that shared residence accounted for 28% of the variance in Schistosoma fecal egg excretion rates. Further, shared residence accounted for 30% of the variation in total water contacts per week. It also accounted for a large proportion of the variation in individual water-contact behavior: for example, agricultural con tacts (63%), washing limbs (56%), or bathing (41%). These results implicate the household as an important composite measure of the complex relationships between socioeconomic, environmental, and behavioral factors that influence water-con tact behavior and, therefore, the transmission of schistosomiasis. These results also support the idea of focusing on safe water supply and household density in the implementation of schis tosomiasis prevention and control measures.",

The population dynamics of parasites was studied. Water contamination (i.e., the source of miraci dia), abundance of the intermediate host, and rodent migration were found to be related to schistosome prevalence. The N. squamipes population was not obviously influenced by the infection, as shown by the high number of reproductive infected females, high longevity of infected individuals, and the absence of a relationship between recruitment or survivorship rates and the intensity of schistosome infection.

It is found in 36 countries in Africa as well as in Guatemala, southern Mexico, some areas of Venezuela, small areas in Brazil, Colombia, and Ecuador, and in the Arabian Peninsula. A total of 18 million people are affected worldwide. The disease is caused by Onchocerca volvulus, a parasitic worm that breeds in water and that can live for up to 14 years in the human body. Controlling insect breeding sites in rivers is one of the pillars of prevention. The disease is trans mitted person to person by bite of a blackfly (Simulium), which breeds solely in fast-flowing waters. Symptoms of the disease in a person usually begin to show 1-3 years after infection. Each adult female worm, which can be more than half a meter in length, produces millions of microscopic young worms (micro filaria). The microfilaria migrate through the skin and, upon death, cause intense itching and depigmentation of the skin (leopard skin), lymphadenitis, resulting in hanging groins and elephantiasis of the genitals, serious visual impairment, and blindness when they reach the eye. The disease blinds between 10% and 30% of its victims and seriously undermines the economic productivity of communities in endemic areas (WHO, 2001b; Figure 5 ). Figure 5 Onchocerciasis also affects the development of exposed children. Their school performance is affected by the unrelenting itching associated with this disease. Many youth are deprived of their childhood as they are often forced to guide and look after elderly relatives blinded by the disease.

The principal agents responsible for cholera epidemics are the O1 and O139 serogroups of V. cholerae, of more than 200 serogroups so far identified. Within the O1 serogroup, the classical biotype caused the pre vious six pandemics, while the El Tor biotype is associated with the present seventh pandemic. A coupling of Vibrio dynamics to that of aquatic, brackish ecosystems is strongly suggested by the marked cholera seasonality in coastal villages of the Bay of Bengal (Colwell, 1996) . The role of coastal areas in maintain ing endemicity is clearly a significant feature of cholera ecology. However, it was mainly laboratory research that provided evi dence for the existence of aquatic environmental reservoirs where V. cholerae survives for long periods of time and from which a toxigenic form may emerge to support epidemic con ditions (Miller et al., 1984 (Miller et al., , 1985 (Miller et al., , 1986 Barua and Greenough, 1992) . The O139 serogroup emerged in the coastal zone in 1992 through a natural genetic alteration of the O1 El Tor biotype. A survey in Bangladesh established that this strain was mainly found in southern coastal marshes (Faruque et al., 2003) . However, systematic, interdisciplinary field studies on the relationship between habitat characteristics and Vibrio diversity and virulence are scarce. Little has been done to widely monitor V. cholerae and study its ecology from a basin perspec tive in different related coastal environments such as mangroves, marshes, and estuaries, despite clear evidence that this could be one significant step forward for early warning and understanding human vulnerability to the disease (Collins, 2003) .",

Nevertheless, Watkins and Cabelli (1985) found that growth and survival of V. parahaemolyticus was more stimulated by addition of pulverized chitin, than by living zooplankton, which however had a greater effect than the addition of sewage or other nutrients. In addition to salinity, nutrients, and plankton, suspended particle load and sediment resuspension also influence the Vibrio amount in the estuary. Recent investigations (Lara, unpublished results) on seston size fractionation in Sunderbans waters showed that the largest amounts of chitin and cultivable Vibrio spp. were generally present in the fractions correspond ing to micro-, nanoplankton, microdetritus, and silt/clay particles, and not in zooplankton.

A further key issue is the compre hension of the seasonality, life cycle, and dormant phases of bacterial population in nature. The environmental persistence of V. cholerae may be facilitated by entering a dormant state in which it remains viable but becomes nonculturable (VBNC) in conventional laboratory media (Colwell et al., 1985) . The V. cholerae cells attached to plankton enter into the VBNC state as survival strategy (Colwell and Huq, 1994) . Therefore, the detection of the nonculturable state is crucial to understanding V. cholerae ecology. However, the mechanisms that cause the organism to associate with plankton or other particles, to form biofilms, or to enter dormant or free-swimming phases are not yet completely understood.",

Nair et al. (1988) also addressed the role of sediments as a possible Vibrio reservoir in freshwater environments in Calcutta. In Florida, there was a predominance of non-O1 V. cholerae infections at the time the organisms flourished in the sediment (Williams and LaRock, 1985) , which was detected down to 15-cm depth. Higher sedi ment Vibrio concentrations were associated with organic matter flocs occurring after the seasonal phytoplankton productivity maximum and during the zooplankton decline. This suggested that the flourishing of Vibrio in the sediments was related to the presence of organic matter input from plankton detritus. Thus, although plankton itself is an important aquatic Vibrio reser voir, its relevance for fueling benthic Vibrio seasonal cycles has probably been overlooked. The relevance of seasonally driven sediment resuspension in relation to annual cholera cycles in endemic regions deserves more attention.

Smith (1983) pointed out that bloom-forming cyanobacteria had a tendency to dominate in a lake when the N:P ratio was less than 29. The significance of the N:P ratio as a critical factor, however, is still controversial, due to the variability of the other chemical char acteristics and phytoplankton composition within a geographic region. For example, cyanobacteria blooms can be induced by increases in the phosphorus concentration instead of by a decrease in the N:P ratio (Trimbee and Prepas, 1987; Sheffer et al., 1997) .",

Outbreaks of poisoning from cyanobacterial blooms can be catastrophic, such as the death of 50 dialysis patients following exposure to inadequately treated water from the Tabocas Reservoir in Brazil (Pouria et al., 1998) or the hospitalization of 140 children and 10 adults who drank cyanobacterially contaminated water impounded by the Solomon Dam in Australia (Hawkins et al., 1985) . Cyanobacterial toxins have also been implicated in mortality in wild fisheries and terres trial mammals, and can accumulate in the ecosystem . Toxins are classified by how they affect the human body (WHO, 2001c): hepatotoxins (which affect the liver) are produced by some strains of the cyanobacteria Microcystis, Anabaena, Oscillatoria, Nodularia, Nostoc, Cylindrospermopsis, and Umezakia. Neurotoxins (which affect the nervous system) are produced by some strains of Aphanizomenon and Oscilatoria. Cyanobacteria from the species Cylindroapermopsis raciborski may also produce toxic alkaloids, causing gastrointestinal symptoms or kidney disease in humans. Not all cyanobacteria of these species form toxins and it is likely that there are other as-yet unrecognized toxins. Further, cyanobacteria produce a wide range of secondary metabolites, among which new cya notoxins continue to be found.",

Because these environments can include waterbodies used for drinking and recreational use, BMAA in drinking water may contribute to chronic intoxication. This may involve incorporation of the neurotoxin into an endogenous protein reservoir with slow release (Murch et al., 2004) and a possible lag between expo sure and effect of years or decades. Since protein-associated BMAA can accumulate within food chains, it is possible that biomagnification of BMAA occurs in marine ecosystems in a way similar to that in terrestrial ecosystems (Banack et al., 2007) . Thus, production of BMAA by marine cyanobacteria may represent another route of human exposure to this neuro toxin. Cox stated that the BMAA produced by the algae may act as a slow toxin. For these reasons, it would be advisable to monitor BMAA concentrations in drinking waters contami nated by cyanobacterial blooms and in fish and animals that may be ingesting the microbes, even at low environmental densities. This can be particularly relevant in semiarid or arid regions that are highly dependent for their drinking water supply on reservoirs, in which cyanobacteria can regularly occur on a seasonal basis, normally in summer.",

Moreover, increased N loading in the environment often occurs together with that of phosphorus.

Wastewater form has been used for aquaculture, for example, in duck ponds, in several countries, mainly in Asia, for centuries to produce human food.

However, wastes and fecally polluted surface water are often used without any pretreat ment or assessment of the presence of pathogens.

Few engineered waste water-fed aquaculture systems have been developed recently. Systems primarily engineered to treat wastewater that incorpo rated aquaculture were developed in Germany from the end of the nineteenth century, but only the Munich system remains, and only for tertiary wastewater treatment and currently as a bird sanctuary (Edwards, 2008) . In this, the following aspects in the dynamics of bird popu lations are of ecohydrological and biomedical relevance. During migratory movements, birds carry pathogens that can be transmitted between species at breeding, wintering, and stopover places where numerous birds of various species are concentrated, such as wetlands. A study by Jourdain et al. (2007) focused on bird migration routes to the Camargue in relation to risk of pathogen dispersion into western Mediterranean wetlands. They considered two pathogens clo sely associated with wild birds: avian influenza (AI) virus and West Nile virus (WNV). The AI viruses have a water-borne transmission, and ducks are their main natural reservoirs (Easterday et al., 1997; Alexander, 2000) ; WNV has a vectorborne transmission, and passerines are believed to play a major role in the amplification cycle (Hurlbut, 1956; Malkinson and Banet, 2002) . Despite different transmission cycles and ecology, both viruses are known to be carried by reservoir birds during migration and have been associated with emer ging disease transmission risk for humans and domestic animals (Rappole et al., 2000; Reed et al., 2003; Olsen et al., 2006) . Environmental conditions, avifauna abundance, and diversity, as well as the interactions among birds from different species and departure sites in stopover wetlands, may be of key importance in terms of virus communication (Hudson et al., 2002) .",

This crowding of wintering species, in addition to the permanent presence of a transient population of birds using wetlands to stop off during migration, could provide the conditions for the circulation and rapid dissemi nation of AI viruses. For vector-transmitted pathogens such as WNV, transmission possibilities depend both on reservoir bird density and on the dispersion capability and activity periods of the arthropod vectors. The risk for interspecific transmission of disease is particularly problematic when wild and domestic species are involved. Ducks are the aquatic birds most likely to come in contact with free-range poultry, especially because the presence of congeners can induce migrating wild ducks to make a stopover (Jourdain et al., 2007) .",

Infection was asymptomatic and virus persistence in the duck community appeared to be dependent upon the continual introduction of ducklings sus ceptible to infection onto virus-contaminated water, since the feces of ducks 70-80 days old were generally virus-free despite the ducks' exposure to the virus in pond water. The normal practice of raising ducks of different ages on the same farm, where the water supplies are shared (Figure 10) , appears to be instrumental in maintaining a large reservoir of influenza viruses in the duck communities.",

This is supported by sam plings of 5000 wild waterbirds in African wetlands, in which no evidence of the H5N1 virus was found, indicting that wild birds probably played a relatively minor role in the spread of AI in that region. Northward migration of wild birds from Africa to Europe in the northern spring of 2006 did not cause any major outbreaks. Nor do wild birds seem to play a role in Indonesia, where H5N1 has been present for some years and several cases of human infections have been recorded. However, although not many major outbreaks took place in Europe in 2006, there is evidence to suggest that wild birds did play a significant role in spreading the disease on the European continent (AIWEB, 2006).",

Thus, natural compe tence occurring in chitin-attached bacterial communities can act as a powerful driver of V. cholerae evolution, which could be accelerated by environmental events such as high nutrient input, giving rise to copepod blooms. It is still unclear whether growth on a determined type of chitin substrateand the production of the corresponding specific chitinasespromotes the capture of external genetic material by vibrios. This empha sizes the need for biogeochemical characterization of different aquatic microhabitats, such as different types of chitin-contain ing particulate matter, besides living zooplankton, in environmental studies of Vibrio diversity and virulence. As organic-matter-rich aquatic environments contain multiple microbial strains and species and high concentrations of bac teriophage and free DNA, horizontal gene transfer (HGT) provides the most likely explanation for why Vibrionaceae have developed high levels of genomic diversity (Meibom et al., 2005) . Interestingly, the cholera toxin gene (ctx) is a phage-mediated mobile genetic element that is transferrable to genetically closely related bacterial strains. In the aquatic environment, vibriophages can regulate seasonal disease out breaks, for example, seasonal cholera epidemics in Dhaka were inversely correlated with the prevalence of environmental cho lera phages (Faruque et al., 2005) .",

It has been associated with sporadic episodes of diarrhea worldwide, but has not caused pandemics. Interestingly, in 1990, there was the first report of an epidemic of diarrhea caused by V. cholerae non-O1 that produces heatstable toxin, affecting Khmers in a camp in Thailand. In con trast to the V. cholerae O1 isolated from the same camp, in 93% of the cases, the non-O1 were resistant to three or more anti biotics (Bagchi et al., 1993) . This calls attention to several important aspects in relation to threats to human health. The fact that the toxin is heat stable could imply a higher diarrhea risk for humans consuming cultured seafood as cooking would not completely eliminate toxin activity. Its higher resistance to antibiotics compared with V. cholerae O1 potentially increases the disease hazards associated with these non-O1 strains. Further, as mentioned previously, the abundance of chitinac eous substrate can favor mutations. Thus, just as V. cholerae O1 evolved from a nonpathogenic to a pandemic-causing form (Faruque et al., 2003) , it cannot be excluded that the high individual density of aquaculturein the same way as megacitiescould be favoring the emergence of new and highly pathogenic Vibrio types.",

Only around 30% of the total sewerage generated by Karachi at present is treated. The E. coli, found in human feces, and other bacteria found in drinking water could cause life-threatening diseases, including diarrhea and cholera. The bulk of the drinking water concerned is taken from the Indus River. Bacteria easily enter the drinking water as the pipelines are rusted and leaking (IRIN, 2004) . Lowintensity seismic activity, though normally not felt by people, probably further damages worn-out pipelines. Additionally, due to the water shortages, the pipelines remain empty for a considerable amount of time daily, during which time they develop negative pressure and absorb moisture and sewage that has leaked from the nearby, similarly worn-out sewers. Additionally, after rains, rainwater mixes with sewage and gar bage can enter the pipelines through the leaks to contaminate the drinking water supply, making people vulnerable to numer ous health hazards (Hasan, 2008) .",

The serogroup O139 never wholly replaced serogroup O1, and by 1996 it had disappeared. At that time, it was still unclear whether the dis appearance would be permanent, or whether O139 would reemerge in subsequent epidemic years. Karachi is in a semi desert area, and the strain may not be able to maintain itself outside the human host (Sheikh et al., 1997) . This strain has also shown diminished ability to maintain its epidemic potential in Bangladesh, and it has been suggested that one reason for this may be that it is less able to persist long term in the aquatic environment (Faruque et al., 1996) . However, years later, in July 2002 and June 2003, cholera outbreaks were detected by a diarrhea surveillance system in a fisher village near Karachi (Siddiqui et al., 2006) . The first outbreak was caused by V. cholerae O139 and the second one by serotype O1. It would be erroneous to conclude that, because of the relatively small number of persons affected, these cases are not relevant in terms of public health. On the contrary, they should be considered extremely valuable indicators of environmental change, especially of aquatic systems, which provide an early warning of possible future trends for policymakers and sanitar ians. Water source was a risk factor only in the first outbreak: a reservoir in the village containing brackish water was only used for washing utensils and clothes and for bathing. Only illness caused by V. cholerae O139 was associated with the use of reservoir water, while O1 cases were not. Washing the clothes of infected persons may have introduced the pathogen into the reservoir. This implies that V. cholerae O139 was probably able to survive for a time outside the body and in water long enough to infect other people. This may be partly because the water was salty and that V. cholerae is a salt-loving bacterium.",

A close regular surveillance of vibrios at basin level, including in the coastal region, rivers, and channels, and in humans is essential in this region, which has the potential to become an epidemic center. Further, restoration of riparian forests and wetlands habitat should be a priority to avoid further habitat loss, and potential host shifts, although salinization would probably preclude the reinstallation of the same species existent before dam building and population explosion.",

The flow of foul water from old sewers and underground rivers was intercepted and diverted along new, low-level sewers, built behind embankments on the river front and taken to new treatment works. By 1870, both the Albert and the Victoria Embankments had been opened. The Victoria Embankment protected Bazalgette's low-level sewer from the hydraulic pressure from the Thames Estuary. The Chelsea Embankment was completed in 1874. The Public Health Act of 1875 required local authorities to implement building regulations, or bylaws, which insisted that each house should be self-contained, with its own sanitation and water. This change in the design of housing complemented the public investment in sewers and water supply. Cholera never reappeared in London after that.",

The most recent detailed studies on seasonal variations of estuarine salinity and related urban cholera incidence are from the 1950s (Chatterjee and Gupta, 1959) . These compare the river systems Kolkata-Hoogly (a main branch of the Ganges) and London-Thames (data from the nineteenth century), and are discussed in Miller et al. (1982) . An important aspect of the 1950s data is that minute but clearly delimited salinity oscillations (e.g., 0.01-0.15 and 0.05-1 ppt) in the Hoogly River tightly correlate with cholera incidence in Kolkata. Several authors reported significantly higher salinity ranges for the growth and persistence of V. cholerae in the environ ment, for example, 2.5-30 ppt (Miller et al., 1984) or 5-25 ppt (Singleton et al., 1982; Louis et al., 2003; Randa et al., 2004) . Salinities <1 ppt were considered suboptimal (Miller et al., 1984) . However, Kolkata's data clearly indicate cholera out breaks at much lower salinities. Such oscillations could also be a proxy of other processes occurring at basin level, which were responsible for triggering the cholera outbreaks. Vibrio survival at low salinities can be facilitated by adsorption onto algae, zooplankton, or by high nutrient concentrations. Unfortunately, this information mostly originated from stag nant water bodies or short-term investigations (e.g., Islam et al., 1994, 2007 and references therein) , but no studies are available about the seasonality of hydrology, biogeochemistry, and Vibrio dynamics in flowing waters of the large rivers in this region through which vibrios most likely spread from the coastal zone toward inland habitats.",

            "text": "Since the 1950s, seven large dams for irrigation purposes have been constructed in India. The Farakka Barrage, complete in 1975, diverts the Ganges River water into the Hooghly River during the dry season to flush out the accumulating silt in the port of Calcutta. It cuts off Bangladesh's water supply, elevating salinity, and has affected fisheries, caused desertification, and hindered navigation, and poses a threat to water quality and public health (Wolf, 2001) . There is evidence of changes in cholera seasonality due to hydrologic disturbances. Before the 1970s, the peak cholera season in Dhaka was November-February; now it is September-November. In Kolkata, season ality has changed twice since the mid-1950s (NICED, 1978 . These shifts may be related to changes in salinity, particle load, and associated estuarine biogeochemistry due to, for example, the construction of the Farakka Barrage on the river Ganges (Mirza, 1998) or increased melting of Himalayan glaciers (UNEP, 2007) . More that 25 years ago, Miller et al. (1982) postulated that dam construction in India could influence Vibrio dynamics by salt intrusion. These aspects deserve further investigation; apart from the 1950s data, there are no other published data series systematically relating these parameters in the rivers of the region with cholera incidence. This informa tion is essential in order to evaluate the transboundary effects of dam construction and water management. Dam construc tion in India has reduced riverine discharge in Bangladesh, inducing desertification in its northern sector and facilitating salt intrusion into its estuaries, particularly in the southwestern region (Wolf, 2001; Adel, 2005) . This resulted in changes in land use from rice cultivation to shrimp farming in the southern Bay of Bengal (Gebauer, 2007) (discussed in Section 10.12.3.1). Salinization of inland water bodies can facilitate the spreading of the halophilic Vibrio organisms and affect drinking water availability. On the other hand, global warming increases glacier melting and associated riverine runoff. Both factors, in a frame of increasing intensity and frequency of cyclones and flooding events, create an extremely complex situation in the coastal zone that could result in shifts in seasonal cholera patterns.",

Water needs for irrigation of desertic and semidesertic areas, as well as for drinking water supplies, mainly for Karachi and Islamabad, have led to the construction of several dams along the Indus River. Within the Sindh province, there are three major barrages on the Indus-Guddu, Sukkur, and Kotri. Severe reduction of water flow below the Kotri Barrage started affecting environments in the area from 1960s onward, with the following consequences in the river basin: (1) drying up and death of riparian forests, Figure 12 The Indus Delta faces major degradation threats, whose major cause is the reduction in the flow of freshwater from the Indus River.

In the coastal region, the livelihood of fishing communities and the fishing industry as a whole depends on ecosystem integrity.

It desperately needs to be protected, for no city that destroys the ecology of the region where it is situated can be sustainable.

Studies about the impact of parasite dynamics have been restricted to medically important species such as Schistosoma japonica (Zheng et al., 2002) . These studies have focused on the distribution of the intermediate host Oncomelania hupensis within the TGD area and associated downstream water bodies. Before construction of the dam, neither O. hupensis nor S. japonica occurred in the reservoir region. However, it is widely predicted that the dam will lead to the introduction of S. japonica into the TGD region, while downstream both positive and negative effects on schistosomiasis transmission will occur (Zheng et al., 2002) . Nevertheless, a survey of the recently filled reservoir (Jobin, 2005) concluded that because of the very steep shoreline along most of its length and subsequent narrow photic zone, which provides only a limited area for the growth of plants, there was little chance of O. hupensis, principally a marshland snail, becoming established. However, these unfavorable topo graphic conditions do not preclude other mollusk species colonizing the shoreline (Morley, 2007) . For example, former gravel quarries converted into lakes have a steep-sided profile with a narrow discontinuous zone of plant life but support a diverse molluskan-trematode community (Adam and Lewis, 1993; Morley et al., 2004) .",

In 1950, the prevalence of the parasite was 65%. To protect the workers, weekly applications of DDT were made at the outlet of Lake Victoria, treating the entire flow during the construction phase, and eliminating the blackflies for at least 50 km downstream. After dam completion in 1954 and discontinuation of DDT applications, the black flies did not return to their former habitats downstream of the dam. By 1974, the prevalence of the parasite had decreased to 0.2% among the populations along the river. The fact that blackfly populations did not return to former levels indicates that there must have been a change in the basic habitat condi tions in the river. The dam had two major hydraulic effects on the river: one effect of turbine operation is a reduction of velocities downstream. The preferred range of water velocity for breeding of the East African species of blackfly involved in river blindness is between 0.5 and 3 m s \u22121 . At present, the mean velocities downstream of Owen Falls Dam are between 0.4 and 0.5 m s \u22121 , slightly less than the required velocities. Prior to dam construction, the mean velocity was roughly twice the present, and thus highly suitable for blackfly breeding. Yet, the major ecohydrologic effect of the dam reservoir was the complete submergence of Owen Falls and Ripon Falls upstream of the dam. These falls were preferential sites for blackfly breeding, and their permanent submergence eliminated the breeding completely.",

The primary purpose of the project was to supply cheap electricity to smelt aluminum, other significant uses being transportation, fishery, water supply (commercial and domestic purposes), tourism, and irrigation. Construction of the Volta Lake led to the resettlement of about 80 000 people from several hundreds of villages. In the other riparian countries of the basin, small and larges dams have been built by governments, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), and local people to secure food produc tion after the severe droughts that occurred in the 1970s and 1980s. In the Nakambe sub-basin (Burkina Faso) alone, more that 600 small dams have been built, mostly during that period (Barry et al., 2005) .",

Before the creation of the Volta Lake, schistosomiasis was endemic in Ghana; but endemicity was low along the Volta River. According to an epidemiological survey done in 1960-61 before the lake was formed, infection rates of schistosomiasis in the area had been 1-5%, mostly affecting children. In the Asukwakwaw area, north of the Akosombo Dam, the prevalence of onchocerciasis is now almost 90%. Principal public health impacts of the formation of the lake have included reduced prevalence of river blindness, but increased incidence of urinary schistosomiasis and a mas sive increase in malaria, as discussed in the following paragraphs.",

In the period following the construction of the dam at Akosombo, there has been a steady decline in agricultural productivity along the lake and the associated tributaries (Gyau-Boakye, 2001). The land surrounding Lake Volta is not nearly as fertile as the for merly cultivated land residing underneath the lake, and intensive agricultural activity has quickly exhausted the already inade quate soils. Without the periodic floodings that brought nutrients to the soil, before the natural river flow was halted by the dam, upstream agricultural systems are also losing soil ferti lity (Van De Giesen et al., 2001) . The growth of commercially intensive agriculture has produced a rise in fertilizer runoff into the river. This, along with runoff from nearby cattle stocks and sewage pollution, has caused eutrophication of the river waters (Gyau-Boakye, 2001) . This nutrient enrichment, in combination with the low water movement, has allowed for the invasion of aquatic weeds (Cerratophyllum) (Fobil and Attaquayefio, 2003) . These weeds, associated with the aquatic snail, the 'intermediate host', together with mass migration into the fishing commu nities from regions in which the disease was endemic, have led to a great increase in the prevalence of schistosomiasis in many localities around the lake.",

Before the construction of the Akosombo and Kpong Dams, malaria was not much of a problem along the swift-flowing Volta River, but, when it became a stagnant lake, it became a greater public health problem in lakeside villages. By 1979, urinary schisto somiasis had increased to become the most prevalent disease in the area, affecting some 75% of lakeside residents (Gitlitz, 1993) and reaching a prevalence rate of 90% among children in certain localities. The problem of schistosomiasis in the lake basin must be seen as embracing both the lake and the Volta Delta. The migratory habits of the fishermen ensure the spread of the disease from endemic areas to other areas. In particular, resettlement villages have showed an increase in disease pre valence since the establishment of Lake Volta, and a village's likelihood of infection corresponds to its proximity to the Lake. Previously, the population in the basin generally lived away from the main watercourses because of the threat from water borne diseases. Children and fishermen have been especially hard hit by this rise of disease prevalence (Zakhary, 1997) . Additionally, the degradation of aquatic habitat has resulted in the decline of shrimp and clam populations. The physical health of local communities has declined as a result of this loss of shellfish populations, as they provided an essential source of dietary protein (Fobil and Attaquayefio, 2003) .",

The lake has also inundated and eliminated the major breeding sites of the onchocerciasis blackfly in rapidly flowing streams and rivers north of the Akosombo Dam. The construction of the second dam at Kpong also eliminated the breeding sites downstream of Akosombo and therefore stopped the transmis sion of river blindness in the vicinity. The main benefit to health because of the construction of the Akosombo Dam in 1965 and the Kpong Dam in 1981 is undoubtedly the reduc tion of the incidence of onchocerciasis in the Volta Basin.

The widespread occurrence of generalist animal species in sugarcane areas has been associated with public health pro blems. For instance, the population increase of the semiaquatic rodent, capybara (Hydrochoerus hydrochaeris), in the Piracicaba River Basin has led to the spread of Brazilian spotted fever (BSF) (Labruna et al., 2004) . The BSF is the most important tick-borne disease in Brazil and is caused by the bacterium, Rickettsia rickettsii, and transmitted by the tick, Amblyomma cajennense, its main vector, and capybaras serve as host for the ticks (Estrada et al., 2006) . R. rickettsii infections can cause a wide range of clinical manifestations, ranging from asympto matic or mild febrile illness to overwhelming and fatal disease. Failure in diagnosis and delayed therapy have contributed to hidden mortality, frequently a result of atypical fulminant forms of the disease (Gon\u00e7alves da Costa et al., 2006 ) and physician's lack of knowledge about the disease, which is exa cerbated by the difficulty of adequate confirmatory laboratory tests during its acute phase. Mortality can reach 40% of the infection cases. The BSF has been known in Brazil since 1929. During the period between 1940 and the 1980s there was a marked drop in the number of reported cases of BSF in Brazil, as well as in the United States (Angerami et al., 2006) . However, since the 1980s an apparent reemergence of the disease has been observed with an increase in the number of reported cases in the southeast of Brazil (Angerami et al., 2006) . Rickettsial diseases have been considered emerging zoo noses worldwide (Raoult and Roux, 1997) and should no longer be classified as rare diseases in Brazil.",

Increased fertilizer use, pollution, and soil erosion have caused deterioration of aquatic systems. As colluvium sediments are transported downhill across the landscape from sugarcane fields, they are deposited onto wetlands, and into small streams, rivers, and reservoirs. Deposition affects water quality, and ecosystem biodiversity (Politano and Pissarra, 2005) and functions. High rates of N export into rivers draining watersheds heavily culti vated with sugarcane in Brazil, such as the Piracicaba and Mogi river basins, have been reported (Filoso et al., 2003) . The indus trial processing of sugarcane for production of sugar and ethanol is another source of pollution for aquatic systems with poten tially harmful effects for human health. Waste products (vinasse) are rich in organic matter, and increase the biochemical oxygen demand (BOD) of waters receiving these effluents, often causing anoxia (Ballester et al., 1999) . With the boom of ethanol pro duction in Brazil in the early 1980s, new legislation was enacted to ban the direct discharge of vinasse into surface waters. Since then, nutrient and carbon-rich vinasse has been mixed with wastewater from washing sugarcane and is recycled back to sugarcane fields as organic fertilizer (Gunkel et al., 2007) , although this practice is still far from generalized. As a conse quence, high nutrient concentrations in these effluents also contribute to the problem by enhancing algal blooms and pro moting eutrophication of surface waters (Matsumura-Tundisi and Tundisi, 2005) .",

These dynamics are associated with changes in land cover/use and with the changing nature of the land-water interface. Anthropogenic influences can intensify ecotonal processes by increasing their geographic extent and overlap. Various ecotone features can contribute to disease emergence. Animals congre gate in ecotones. Populations of species that normally are members of distinct ecological communities from different habitats or ecosystems overlap in ecotones, facilitating patho gen spillover. Host-vector hyperabundance increases the potential for pathogens to achieve critical threshold density. Enhanced dispersal conditions facilitate dispersal at a higher rate or over longer distances, along linear habitats defined by habitat edges, such as riverine or gallery forest, and flowing water in streams or rivers themselves. Cropland-forest-river transitions appear particularly relevant as sensitive indicators of change in this context. For example, the transition between fragmented riparian habitats such as degraded gallery forests and, for example, sugarcane fields seems to be a priority sector for the control of rickettsia-related diseases since capybaras must cross the ecotone to feed on sugarcane, as described else where in this article.",

The emer gence of AI involved the mixing of three different communities: wild migratory waterfowl (wetlands), wild local birds, and domestic fowl (ponds), and, later, also pigs. Like influenza, the emergence of Japanese encephalitis has involved transmis sion in the spatial area of overlap of human settlements, agriculture, and natural habitat (Despommier et al., 2007) . While waterbirds and wetland habitat are implicated in influ enza, nonaquatic wild birds and irrigation systems provide the vector habitat for encephalitis. The intensification and expan sion of irrigated rice production systems in Southeast Asia over the past 20 years have made an important contribution to the spread of this disease, which is produced by a mosquito-borne virus (see Table 5 ). The flooding of the fields at the start of each cropping cycle leads to a sizable increase in the mosquito population. Domestic pigs and wild birds are reservoirs of the virus and transmission to humans may cause severe symptoms. Japanese encephalitis is a leading cause of viral encephalitis in Asia with 30 000-50 000 clinical cases reported annually (WHO, 2001d) .",

Globally, the surveillance of locally and regionally relevant ecotones could provide evidence of disease emergence related to environmen tal change. In this context, restoration of lost ecological functions, such as nutrient sequestration by wetland creation or regeneration of riparian vegetation, must be accompanied by careful monitoring of other changes in the surrounding land scape and in the connectivity between basin processes and land use.

Early methods of managing salt-marsh mosquitoes have primarily focused on maximizing the reduction of mosquito populations, with mini mizing environmental impact as a secondary consideration. However, in the last few decades, there have been attempts to apply diverse water management models to marsh systems, especially in terms of vector control and habitat modification (Dale and Hulsman, 1990; Wolfe, 1996) using programs with minimal environmental impacts. The success of these programs requires a thorough knowledge of mosquito developmental conditions, as well as potential impacts on adjoining ecosys tems. A deep knowledge of the local microtopography and tidal regimes is critical. Marsh drainage and hydrological linkage to the tidal source are essential in the determination of what type of wetland occurs where, and for the development of appro priate wetland management measures.

            "text": "An interesting lesson on the potential for improved water management to reduce vector proliferation from the 1960s can be drawn from the experience in the Baluchi Irrigation Scheme in then Tanganyika (Sturrock, 1965) . This system was remark ably clear of snails, although several species occurred in small numbers. Several factors may account for this. First, the water flow in the canal system was very rapid when it was in use, but the canals were completely dried out in the dry season. Second, silt and vegetation were dug out of the canals twice a year. Third, a complex system of rice husbandry was used in which the rice fields were ploughed, manured, and subjected to a program of alternate drying and flooding. Consequently, neither the canal system nor the rice fields contained much in the way of snail habitats. Snails were confined to temporary pool sites, filled with rain or seepage water. All these schemes were built on land with an appreciable slope and with relatively porous soils. Even when irrigation was in progress, the field canals were not always in use and dried out rapidly. While snails are often able to withstand limited periods of drought, it is unlikely that any large snail populations could develop under these conditions in any one season. Furthermore, on five of these schemes, field canals were often re-routed from season to season so that the establishment of suitable snail habitats was rendered even more unlikely. Mobarak (1982) reported that after 1970 prevalence of urinary schistosomiasis in Upper Egypt reversed a previous downward trend and began to increase again because of the shift from basin to perennial irrigation. However, in any case, increased use of parenteral antischistosomal therapy (PAT, injections of antimony-based drugs) was bringing schistoso miasis under control in Egypt. In the northern part of Upper Egypt, prevalence dropped from 29.4% in 1977 to 11.5% in 1983, while further south, prevalence reportedly fell from 26. 4% in 1980 4% in to 16% in 1983 4% in (WHO, 1985 . Most experts agreed that applying the proper combination of sanitary engi neering, water control management, snail control, infection surveillance, and treatment drugs can avert adverse effects of irrigation on schistosomiasis. Moreover, there was an impres sion that even without water control measures and environmental sanitation, chemotherapy with or without treat ing water to kill snails would adequately control schistosomiasis transmission. Fenwick (1989) noted that in the newer Rahad Irrigation Scheme, east of the Gezira plain in the Sudan, because of the use of drugs and snail control, the incidence of schistosomiasis remained very low, despite very poor sanitary conditions. It was predicted, however, that relax ing control measures would cause a surge in schistosomiasis. Although oral drugs started to be used in Egypt in the 1970s, PAT use continued into the mid-1980s. Praziquantel, which also has a high cure rate for S. mansoni, became available in Egypt in 1982 and has been the treatment of choice there since the late 1980s. Although the massive PAT campaigns were successful in strongly reducing disease incidence, a study by Frank et al. (2000) concludes that the intensity, widespread geographical coverage, and duration of the campaigns, together with unsafe injection practices (inappropriate sterilization pro cedures), have been responsible for the nationwide spread of hepatitis C in Egypt in recent decades. The authors state that the enormous dimension of Egypt's schistosomiasis problem and the sheer size of the antischistosomiasis effort, combined with the characteristics of PAT, provided an effective mechanism for a massive increase and establishment of hepatitis C virus in the Egyptian population. According to these authors, this is \"the world's largest iatrogenic transmission of blood-borne patho gens known to date.\" Moreover, it is probable that the heavy reliance on an effective chemical treatment also allowed the continuation of water management schemes that were contri buting to the maintenance of large numbers of snails in aquatic environments. The evolution of the schistosomiasis problem in Egypt and Sudan described above highlights the importance of developing water management programs able to keep vector proliferation under control. This lesson is also highly relevant to the construction of large-scale reservoirs and irrigation facil ities as in the case of the Three Gorges Dam.",

All vector snails require water, at least for breeding. The management of water bodies is therefore a potentially powerful control method. For example, in the case of rice cultivation there are opportunities for vector control by changing the aquatic habitat of the snail in a way compatible with maximum crop production. Infection of humans mostly takes place not in the rice field itself, but in irrigation canals and surrounding living quarters. Different hydrological and rice husbandry approaches have been used in various countries. However, generalizations should be made with care because each snail species has its own preferences and tolerances regard ing shade, water velocity, the steepness of canal walls, and drought tolerance.",

The P. metidjensis was observed in the upper valleys of three rivers, whereas B. truncatus was found in sites of lower altitude.

Nevertheless, before a control plan is adopted and implemen ted, the effects of drying out have to be monitored and thoroughly understood for each snail species: snails that are capable of undergoing diapause can circumvent unfavorable environmental conditions, including long periods of drought. Cooper et al. (1992) found that diapause influenced the sus ceptibility of Biomphalaria glabrata snails to S. mansoni infection. Juvenile snails exposed just prior to diapause, or immediately following a diapause period of 3 weeks, were highly susceptible to infection by S. mansoni miracidia. However, snails that underwent diapause produced compar able or only slightly fewer cercariae than did nondiapausing snails. These studies indicate that diapause in B. glabrata does little to decrease a snail's ability to act as an intermediate host for S. mansoni or to interrupt the development of the parasite. For these reasons, great attention should be given to diapausing snail populations when planning programs for mollusk control.",

For example, recent El Ni\u00f1o/La Ni\u00f1a-Southern Oscillation teleconnections have produced a pro longed drought of \u223c3 years in South Argentina. This has interrupted a period of about 30 years of rainfall significantly above the historical average and produced a decline to critical levels in the reserves of drinking water reservoirs, which like other water bodies in the region, have suffered from recurrent summer algal blooms (Kopprio et al., 2008) . However, the perception that cyanobacteria can represent a threat to human health only in connection with acute events such as blooms should be widened to consider the possibility of neurologic damage as consequence of chronic exposition to toxins such as BMAA via long-term ingestion of water or aquatic fauna. This should be taken into account when developing schemes for preventing cyanobacterial blooms by manipulating natural predator communities. The reduction of the nutrient load input to the water reservoir probably remains the best preven tive measure to prevent harmful algal blooms. Water treatment should be regularly checked and improved to remove the organisms and their toxins from drinking-water supplies, where appropriate. Water treatment by flocculation and sedi mentation, followed by sand filtration, is supposed to remove live cyanobacterial cells and debris. However, there is evidence that plants that are not working properly can actually increase cell counts of algae with potential toxicity (in this case, Anabaena circinalis and Microcystis aeruginosa) in the treated water (Echenique et al., 2006) .",

Sometimes, though, the acute problems that led to the original priority setting might have become latent rather than have disappeared completely, and while public awareness and political pressure favour a policy change, the original goals of such policies should not be ignored. This was well illustrated by the water man agement policies including mosquito control established by the TVA in the 1930s. The standards of mosquito control maintained by TVA equalled those maintained in privately owned river impoundments under prevailing public health regulations. The measures included the programmed fluctuation of water levels in the reservoirs, a practice that played a key role in reducing Anopheles populations and eradicating malaria transmission from the Valley. New uses of the reservoirs, including recreation and the promotion of nature conservation had led to a conflict of interests. For recreation, stable water levels during summer and early autumn were required; con servation of certain fish species and of waterfowl required higher water levels in spring to promote fish spawning and the rapid growth of aquatic vegetation for the fowl. Such changes in water manage ment regimes would without doubt result in increased mosquito populations, yet the potential risk for the reintroduction of vectorborne disease was not appreciated after three generations of malaria free experience. In recent years much interest has been directed towards the protection and establishment of wetlands, without pay ing sufficient attention to their mosquito breeding potential. Consequently, TVA has been faced with a conflict of new policy directives concerning wetlands, existing mosquito control policies and state regulations for impounded water. The use of constructed (artificial) wetlands for the treatment of domestic waste water and its processing for reuse is of particular concern, since these could pro duce large quantities of potential disease vectors and they are often sited close to populated areas (PEEM/WHO, 1991: 17-18). This stresses the necessity of harmonizing policies of reservoir management for vector control with other policies concerned with land use patterns, to ensure that areas of potential risk, such as artificial wetlands, are planned away from areas of human habitation.",

Take, for example, the case of influenza virus. The loss of wetlands around the globe may force many wild birds onto alternative sites like farm ponds and paddy fields, bringing them into direct contact with domestic fowl and humans and providing greater opportu nities for the spread of the H5N1 virus (Anonymous, 2006) . Poor planning in response to development pressures has led to the increasing loss or degradation of wild ecosystems which are the natural habitats for wild birds. The displaced wild birds increasingly seek to feed and live in areas populated by domestic poultry and humans. Thus, wetland creation must also consider these factors, since they will attract migratory birds if located near their routes. Despite this being considered an enrichment of landscape ecology in terms of diversity, recreational value, landscape beauty, etc., the risk of increasing transmission of emerging diseases must be dispassionately considered. An increase in biodiversity does include not only those species humans like, but also the diversity of vectors capable of transmitting diseases. The distance of the wetlands to be created from populated centers, the direction of prevail ing winds, and other transport mechanisms should be carefully taken into account. This issue of 'ecohealth' highlights the interplay between agriculture, animal (domestic and wildlife) and human health, the integral health of aquatic ecosystems, and sociocultural factors. Nutrient reduction in wastewaters or surface waters is a priority for reducing risks to human health, as well as for the reduction of disease vectors in surface waters. Exploration of phytotechnologies relying on direct belowground absorption of nutrients by plant root biomass could provide alternatives to construction of open wetlands in places where this might involve disease vector proliferation.",
