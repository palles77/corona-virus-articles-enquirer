Since then, respiratory and general physicians have become accustomed to dealing with an extraordinary range of esoteric and previously unheard of conditions. Pneumocystis carinii (now known as Pneumocystis jirovecii) pneumonia is frequently part of the differential diagnosis of treatment-nonresponsive pneumonic illness. Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) testing is almost routinely offered as a \"rule out\" test in clinical cases that defy simple diagnosis. In many parts of the developing world, advanced HIV disease is unfortunately the likeliest reason for seeking medical care. The change this has wrought on people, countries and their economies is huge and depressing. The isolation of HIV from patients with AIDS in the mid 1980s paved the way for intensive research with the ultimate development of drugs directed against this chronic infection. However, despite such advances, the methods by which HIV infection leads to severe immune dysregulation and clinical disease are still not fully defined.",

Before HAART, defined as a combination of medications that usually includes at least three potent anti-HIV agents, treatment largely consisted of specific opportunistic infection management and less effective antiretroviral therapy. The clinical consequences of this change are enormous. The relative hazard for development of Pneumocystis pneumonia (PCP) in an HIVinfected individual has fallen by more than 80%. Drug therapy does have a down side. It has significant unwanted effects, as well as major interactions with other medication (e.g., rifamycins used in treating tuberculosis). The profound change in immunity induced by HAART may also lead to disease (the immune reconstitution inflammatory syndrome [IRIS] ).",

This leads to progressive immune dysfunction and an inability to resist opportunistic disease. The pathogenic process is not well defined, although it is thought that at the time of primary infection, HIV spreads to the lymph nodes, circulating immune cells, and thymus. This is a massive viral infection of the human host; and although there seems to be a relatively potent immune response, in fact, this initial onslaught is so devastating (targeting as it does specific memory T cells responsible for sustaining long-term protective immunity) that the scene is set for progressive immune failure. This occurs through a combination of direct cell killing by HIV replicating within cells, as well as the negative effects of chronic immune activation. Ultimately, these lead in most individuals to immune system destruction and dysfunction. This is reflected not only by clinical disease indicating profound immunosuppression but also by a measurable reduction in the circulating absolute CD4 cell count, the percentage of T cells expressing CD4 markers, and in the progressive reduction in CD4/CD8 T-cell ratio.",

            "text": "Although a proportion of individuals remain completely well without any treatment for an extended period (approximately 20% after 10 years), many HIV-infected individuals have minor symptoms and signs suggesting immune dysfunction. Examples of these include new or worsening rashes (including herpes simplex), tiredness, cough, and low-grade anemia. Certain clinical symptoms and signs provide important prognostic information. Most studies have shown that oral candidiasis and constitutional symptoms (e.g., malaise, idiopathic fever, night sweats, diarrhea, and weight loss) are the strongest clinical predictors of progression to AIDS. The term AIDS was created as an epidemiologic tool to capture those conditions that early in the HIV epidemic seemed to suggest significant immune destruction. Over time, it has been modified to incorporate the expanding spectrum of recognized diseases affecting immunosuppressed individuals, such as cervical carcinoma and recurrent bacterial pneumonia (see Box 34-1). The 1993 Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) classification included an immunologic criterion for AIDS (CD4 count <200 cells/mL or CD4 percentage <14% of total lymphocytes) regardless of clinical symptoms (see Table 34 -3). These data are used to define a point at which the risk of severe opportunistic infection rises dramatically. An example of this can be seen in the Multicenter AIDS Cohort Study (MACS) of homosexual and bisexual men without AIDS, which found that the incidence of PCP in subjects who did not use prophylaxis rose from 0.5% at 6 months in men with a baseline CD4 count >200 cells/mL to 8.4% in those with a CD4 count <200 cells/mL. Apart from cervical carcinoma, AIDS indicator diseases differ little between men and women. Injecting drug users have a high incidence of wasting syndrome, recurrent bacterial pneumonia, and tuberculosis. Geographic differences in diseases occur that reflect the opportunistic pathogens present in the local environment (e.g., histoplasmosis or visceral leishmaniasis usually occur only in patients from endemic areas). In the developed world, sexual, racial, and HIV risk factor survival differences after an AIDS diagnosis mainly arise from variation in ease of access to medical care. It is certainly the case, however, that better treatment outcomes are associated with genuine specialist care provided by people with extensive experience in the field.",

However, the mechanism underlying this has not been fully explained. In part, this is because the alterations that arise reflect the complex interplay between systemically derived HIV and other circulating antigens trafficking through the pulmonary vasculature, local immune cells, and airborne antigen. Most studies investigating the pulmonary immune response have used in vitro cell culture systems that seek to mimic the pulmonary environment or in some cases bronchoscopy and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) to recover lung cells from infected individuals. Until recently, these have been performed on symptomatic patients who required bronchoscopy as a diagnostic procedure. Such subjects generally have advanced HIV infection, are often taking a number of different drugs (including antiretrovirals), and may have any number of different pathogens causing their pulmonary disease-which by themselves can influence the immune findings. Finally, the question of whether BAL fluid truly represents the site of the immune response (the lung parenchyma) remains unclear.

More exotic organisms are found in subjects with very low CD4 counts. These include bacteria such as Rhodococcus equi and Nocardia asteroides and fungi such as Aspergillus species and Penicillium marneffei.

More technically demanding (both of the patient and the operator) than induced sputum collection, bronchoscopy and BAL have the advantage that direct inspection of the upper airway and bronchial tree can be performed and, if necessary, biopsies taken. Transbronchial biopsies may marginally increase the diagnostic yield of the procedure. This is relevant for the diagnosis of mycobacterial disease, although the relatively high complication rate in HIV-infected individuals (pneumothorax and the possibility of significant pulmonary hemorrhage in up to 10%) outweighs the advantages of the technique for routine purposes. Samples of BAL fluid are examined for bacteria, mycobacteria, viruses, fungi, and protozoa. Inspection of the cellular component may also provide etiologic clues-cooperation of a pathology department with experience in opportunistic infection diagnosis is vital.

The likelihood that P. jirovecii is the causative organism increases if the subject is not taking effective anti-Pneumocystis drug prophylaxis or has a previous medical history with clinical or laboratory features that suggest systemic immunosuppression (i.e., recurrent oral thrush, longstanding fever of unknown cause, clinical AIDS, or blood CD4 count <200 cells/mL).

In addition, ATS/CDC/IDSA guidelines recommend that treatment be extended to 9 months in those who have cavitation on the original radiograph, continuing signs, or a positive culture after 2 months of therapy. Recent work has highlighted the increased risk for development of rifampin monoresistance in HIV-infected individuals on treatment. This is especially so if intermittent regimens are used and may arise from a lack of efficacy of the other drugs present in the combination (e.g., intermittent isoniazid). Hence, daily medication regimens are recommended and should be closely supervised in all HIV-positive patients. It should be remembered that although rifabutin is usually given three times a week with ritonavir-boosted protease inhibitors, this seems to achieve adequate rifamycin levels; there have been no reports of this leading to rifamycin resistance in patients who are appropriately adherent. Directly observed therapy (DOT) is an important, although fairly labor-intensive, strategy that has the support of the World Health Organization.",

In these patients, the CD4 count should be closely monitored, and antiretroviral therapy may be deferred until treatment for tuberculosis is completed. In patients who have CD4 counts from 199-100 cells/mL, many centers currently delay starting antiretroviral therapy until after the first 2 months of treatment for tuberculosis have been completed; patients are given concomitant PCP prophylaxis. In patients who have CD4 counts of <99 cells/mL, antiretroviral therapy is started as soon as possible after beginning treatment for tuberculosis.

The observational North American MACS cohort demonstrated that the risk of PCP in individuals with blood CD4 counts of <100 cells/mL can be reduced almost fourfold if both specific prophylaxis and HAART are taken (from 47% to 13%). However, as common conditions are prevented, so other less treatable illnesses may arise. The initial impact of P. jirovecii prophylaxis was a reduction in the incidence of PCP at the expense of an increase in cases of disseminated MAC infection, CMV infection, esophageal candidiasis, and wasting syndrome. New prophylactic therapies targeting those conditions associated with high morbidity and mortality (in particular MAC) have further improved survival. It has become apparent that specific infection prophylaxis may also confer protection against other agents. This \"cross- prophylaxis\" is particularly seen with the use of TMP/SMX for Pneumocystis, which also provides cover against cerebral toxoplasmosis and several common bacterial infections (although not S. pneumoniae) and with macrolides for MAC infection, which further reduce the incidence of bacterial disease and also PCP. Use of large amounts of antibiotic raises the possibility of future widespread drug resistance. This is clearly of concern, and recent reports suggest that, indeed, in some parts of the world the incidence of pneumococcal TMP/SMX resistance is rising.

The importance of secondary prophylaxis (i.e., used after an episode of PCP) becomes clear from historical data, which indicate a 60% risk of relapse in the first 12 months after infection. The increase in systemic and local immunity that occurs with HAART has led to several studies evaluating the need for prolonged prophylaxis in individuals with sustained elevations in blood CD4 counts and low HIV RNA load. In summary, it seems that both primary and secondary PCP prophylaxis can be discontinued once CD4 counts are >200 cells/mL for more than 3 months. A caveat to this is that the patient should have a low or undetectable HIV RNA load, that the CD4 percentage is stable or rising and is >14%, and that the individual plans to continue HAART long term with good adherence.",

Alternate protocols also exist for subjects thought to be resistant to first-line prophylactic agents. These have not been widely clinically evaluated.

Regimens that use a gradual increase in dosage when starting prophylaxis may help. One concern with widespread use of prophylaxis is that resistance will start to occur to TMP/SMX. Reports have indicated that there are mutations in the P. jirovecii dihydropteroate synthase gene that confer resistance. These seem to be increasing over time, although they do not seem to be present in many patients who fail treatment for PCP with TMP/SMX. The implications of this are uncertain but could include a greater likelihood of treatment failure and the possibility of worsening patterns of global bacterial drug resistance.",

The evidence that this is harmful above those effects seen in the general population continues to accrue. The accelerated course of both obstructive lung disease and cancer, together with the increased risk of respiratory infection in smokers, persuasively argues the case for targeted smoking cessation. That HIV infection and HAART have profound (and probably negative) effects on blood lipids and insulin resistance further support the need to reduce smoking rates in this population. It seems that we are starting to see increased rates of cardiovascular disease in this now aging population.",

P. jirovecii remains the most common AIDS-defining event in the developed world, whereas M. tuberculosis is globally the most common cause of death. Bacterial respiratory infection is not far behind. Given the huge number of individuals with HIV infection, the only effective way to manage this disease is to find simple ways of treating HIV itself, and thus contain the worst ravages of this illness.",
