            "text": "Hospital emergency preparedness is not a new idea. Hospitals as part of cities and towns in the 1930s were involved with civil defense programs after learning of the prewar activities in Europe. World War II civil defense efforts and later on in the 1950s continued as communities prepared for potential nuclear attacks, and hospitals prepared for mass casualties. One the earliest hospital evacuation exercises took place in Portland, Oregon, in 1955 as part of Operation Green Light, a civil defense exercise. 3 Historically, hospitals crafted a disaster plan with a trauma or mass casualty focus. The disaster plan began in the emergency department (ED) and ended when the patient was admitted to the hospital, died, or was discharged. Leadership for the hospital disaster plan was often carried out by nurses and other hospital leaders including: the nurse manager in the ED, trauma nurse coordinator, ED medical director, trauma medical director, hospital safety officer, or the hospital facility manager. Hospital EDs maintained a supply of medical surgical supplies, triage tags, and premade patient charts. The hospital engineering staff checked the emergency generator as part of the requirements for facility management, and load bank tests were carried out. Training on the hospital disaster plan usually occurred once a year and included a review of specific processes through table-top exercises. The greatest effort for training usually occurred in the ED. It is important to note that things have now changed.",

Public health departments have historically taken the lead with viral or bacterial diseases that have had the potential to impact large numbers of the population such as norovirus, polio, varicella, rubella, meningitis, foodborne illness, and influenza. Highly virulent public health threats including Ebola virus disease (EVD), pandemic influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and Zika virus disease require close coordination of both hospitals and public health officials to ensure accurate case counts, worker protection, protocols for testing, processing of laboratory samples, and early identification of those with the disease.",

This act provided training to first responders (police and fire department) and to assist with the formation of metropolitan medical strike teams (MMSTs). WMD incidents are defined as terrorist-driven biological, chemical, radiological, and nuclear terrorism events. Training was provided to the 120 largest cities in the United States (by 1990 census data). The training, funded by the US Department of Defense (DoD), leveraged interagency coordination between US Federal Emergency Management Agency (FEMA), the US Department of Justice, and the DoD. Hospitals or the personnel responsible for emergency preparedness were not specifically included for training. 5 High-profile events such as the Atlanta Summer Olympics (1996) and the Salt Lake City Winter Olympics (2002) provided additional federal funds for first responders, public safety, and the development of patient care protocols. Hospitals may also choose to part of the National Medical Disaster System (NDMS). NDMS is a federal program comprised of partnerships between the Department of Health and Human Services (DHHS), the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) and the Department of Veteran's Affairs (VA). NDMS hospitals provide internal surge capability for disasters occurring in the United States, and also provide support to the military and VA hospital systems in providing casualty care for injured personnel from overseas conflicts.",

Congress passed legislation in 1983 that required the US chemical weapons stockpile to be destroyed, and that maximum assistance was to be provided to the communities who were adjacent to the storage depots. Chemical weapon storage areas, also referred to as storage depots, were originally placed during the 1940s in remote areas, away from population centers. The chemical stockpiles contained munitions of either blister or nerve agents. They were located in Alabama, Arkansas, Indiana, Illinois, Maryland, Oregon, Washington, and Utah. Of the original 10 sites, 2 sites remain active, Pueblo, Colorado, and Lexington, Kentucky, and anticipate agent destruction beginning in 2016. Funding for the CSEPP is a cooperative grant process, funded through DoD (US Army) with support from FEMA. Assistance is provided during the time that stockpile destruction facilities are constructed and through the end of chemical agent destruction. 6 Each community (including hospitals) developed plans and capabilities several areas, called \"Benchmarks\":",

Notification devices include sirens, tone alert radios, and highway reader boards (electronic signs). Automated data processing means the ability of critical monitoring systems for an unintended chemical agent release to be seen by military base leaders, public information officers, and community leaders. Communications are comprised of interoperative, functional information-sharing systems that link the military on post leaders (base commander and support staff) with state leaders, local community leaders, response agencies (police, fire, and EMS), and citizens. Communication systems include video teleconferencing, portable radios, fax machines, cell phones, radio/television studios or broadcast, and telephones. Coordinated plans include emergency preparedness plans that are specific for each state, military installation, and for communities closest to the storage depot/chemical weapons destruction facility. These locations are at greatest risk should an off post release of chemical agent occur though a spill or airborne means. Coordinated plans involve identification of specific geographic zones. These locations are either the closest to the military base (therefore at greatest risk) or are further away (lower risk). These locations are referred to as the immediate response zones (IRZ) and the protective action zones (PAZ). Decontamination is the process of removing a chemical agent (nerve agent or blister agent) from clothing, skin or hard surface, or through washing with soap and water. The use of bottled bleach or a bleach solution is not recommended for skin, hair, or body surface decontamination.",

CSEPP-supported EOCs also contain computer systems that monitor the accidental release of a chemical agent off the military base (note-a release of chemical agent off post into the community has not occurred during the agent destruction or storage process). The term exercises refers to a program of testing and evaluation of the community (state and local governments, first responders, hospital personnel) to respond to an off post release of chemical agent. This includes coordination of messages (alert and notification), evacuation to a different location, setting up decontamination areas, decontamination of potential agent exposure, medical care, and other tasks. Personnel include various supportive roles for the program including program coordinators, planners, and public affairs/public information officers. The CSEPP program provides funding for the purchase of personal protective equipment (PPE) that is intended to protect workers from exposure to military chemical agent during the process of decontamination (removal of agent from the skin, clothing, or hair). Chemically resistant suits, gloves, boots, and powered air purifying respirators (PAPRS) are provided. The level of protection in the community is at US Occupational Safety and Health Agency (OSHA) level C. Higher levels of worker protection/PPE are in place on the military installation, and at the first responder level (fire department). As required by both US Army and OSHA regulations, extensive training is required before personnel can put on PPE and use the equipment either in a simulated or real-world situation. Education and training programs should be consistent with FEMA, state, and local areas. A training plan (for off post jurisdictions) and US Army certification requirements (for on post installations) is developed, and maintained proficiency of emergency services providers/responders, and CSEPP staff (as defined and measured by CSEPP guidance) is developed and presented on a scheduled basis.

These early collaborations/ coalitions were called integrated process teams (IPTs). The medical IPT included prehospital providers, specifically fire department hazardous materials teams (HAZ-MATs), physicians, and nurses. HAZMAT teams assisted in development of the requirements that would be needed for receiving potentially contaminated patients.

Evaluators external to the community evaluate the ability of the community to respond to a chemical agent event both at on post (US Army storage location) and off post (community) locations. Hospital triage, decontamination, incident command system (ICS), implementation, and patient management are evaluated. Prehospital care and participation of first responders are also evaluated as part of the continuum of victim care. Exercise response outcomes (EROs) are used to measure progress in meeting specific objectives, and can be followed over the length of time that the program is in place for each community. Annual exercises reveal strengths and weakness. For example, new staff at a hospital may be unfamiliar with how to put on PPE, set up decontamination sites, or communicate with state and local leaders. Exercises teach and test. Within the medical environment, following requirements for dealing with hazardous materials is particularly important, and something that is closely evaluated each year. As with any disaster exercise or event, a prior understanding of the emergency operations plan, special procedures, or the use of equipment not used on a daily basis is vital. Safety issues, whether for simulated victims or people performing decontamination, are closely scrutinized. For example, stores of medical countermeasures (nerve agent antidote kits) are counted annually as well as medication expiration dates. One of the greatest challenges in the CSEPP program is personnel turnover, and loss of institutional memory, meaning a key person leaves an organization who knew where everything was located and how the procedure was to be carried out. The evaluation process at a hospital site identifies actions or plans that go well or need correction. This establishes a continuous quality improvement cycle whose elements can be measured over time.",

Coalitions developed with the CSEPP program, Metropolitan Medical Response System (MMRS), Metropolitan Strike Teams, and now with the hospital preparedness program. Coalitions are locally or regionally based. Membership within coalitions is defined at the local level (city, county, state, or region). Coalitions have established leaders who have specific roles and responsibilities as well as an organizational framework. Individual organizational support is identified through the development of an MOU or memorandum of agreement. Such agreements articulate roles and responsibilities, identify the process for distribution of funding sources, and facilitate the integration of the preparedness community. For example, some coalitions have used HPP grant dollars to purchase equipment, creating communications networks between facilities and first responder partners. They have purchased caches of supplies and established community-based emergency preparedness exercises. Coalitions exist as a result of established day-to-day relationships within a hospital and between hospitals and public health partners. Relationships develop that include levels of trust, familiarity, and dependability. Coalitions have expanded outside the hospital/public health boundaries to include skilled nursing facilities and long term care facilities, all of which are part of the fabric of health care providers in the community. Many coalitions share training schedules, offer joint educational or preparedness conferences, and act as mentors to other health care partners as they develop emergency preparedness plans for their organizations. In times of emergency, knowing one's coalition partners and how to reach them quickly can help keep health care services intact. The ability to bounce back in the face of disaster is the hallmark of resilience. 14 As of 2016, funding levels for both the HPP and PHEP program have been cut, forcing hospitals to determine whether participation in regional coalitions, planning efforts, and exercises is still worth their financial support.",

The various accreditation standards include common elements such as development of hospital emergency preparedness plans based on a hazard vulnerability analysis, communication plans (inside and outside the hospital), establishment of a hospital incident command system, maintenance of essential environmental controls (heating/cooling/ water/sewage), provision of food for patients and staff, patient/staff tracking, enhanced security, and provision of emergency generator power. Hospitals are also required to test their emergency preparedness plans once a year. The new CMS requirements also include participation in an annual community-based disaster exercise and a table-top exercise. Table- top exercises are useful for evaluating specific disaster processes or procedures however, cannot evaluate an emergency preparedness program.",
