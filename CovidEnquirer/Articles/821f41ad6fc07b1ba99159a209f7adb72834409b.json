Three protein spots that originated from preparation gels were identified to be two proteins. Overall, haptoglobin precursor was up-regulated in cows infected with clinical mastitis and could be a mastitis-associated diagnostic marker, whereas SCGB 2A1 (secretoglobin, family 2A, member 1) was down-regulated protein. Plasma protein expression patterns were changed when cows were infected with mammary gland inflammation; it suggests that analysis of differential expression protein might be useful to clarify the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology, and find new diagnostic markers of mastitis and potential protein targets for treatment.",

Recently, haptoglobin was an up-regulated one in hepatocellular carcinoma, severe acute respiratory syndrome, and ovarian cancer using proteomic approach, and regarded as a useful diagnostic marker (Ahmed et al. 2005; Ang et al. 2006; Wan et al. 2006) .

Interestingly, haptoglobin con- centrations were increased in milk and serum from cows with experimentally induced acute and chronic Staphylococcus aureus matitis and from cows with clinical mastitis, indicating that it is an acute phase protein (Eckersall et al. 2001; Eckersall et al. 2006; Gronlund et al. 2003) .

However, mammaglobin was found in human normal prostate tissue and absent in tumor samples without significant differences (Tucker et al. 2005) . Also, its mRNA levels did not vary significantly between wild-type and estramustine-resistant cells in prostate and ovarian cancer cell lines. In our data, although mammaglobin is identified in serum and is a down-regulated protein when cows are infected with clinical mastitis, the function of the mammaglobin protein associated with intramammary inflammation in cows remains unknown. It might provide valuable information to clarify the mechanisms involved in the pathogenesis of mammary.",

Proteomic approach analysis of protein changes in plasma might be useful to clarify the mechanisms involved in the pathophysiology of cows infected with clinical mastitis, to find new diagnostic markers of mastitis, and to find potential protein targets for treatment.",
