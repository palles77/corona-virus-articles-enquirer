We succeeded in obtaining MAbs which did not react with eight strains of FIPV Type I viruses (showing cell-associated growth) but reacted with FIPV Type II (79-1146, KU-1 ) and/or FECV Type II (79-1683 ) viruses (showing non-cell associated growth ).

            "text": "For serological diagnosis of feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) infection, detection of antibody by indirect fluorescent antibody assay (IFA) is popular (Pedersen, 1976b; Horzinek and Osterhaus, 1979; Scott, 1979) . On the other hand, feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) which antigenically crossreacts with FIPV, and causes only mild enteritis without inducing FIP, may be present (McKeirnan et al., 1981; Pedersen et al., 1981a; Pedersen et al., 1981b; Pedersen et al., 1984) . Thus, the serological diagnosis of FIP and the mechanisms of its onset become more complex. Pedersen et al. (1984a) classified the feline coronaviruses in terms of the disease types. They divided FIPV into Types I and II according to the presence or absence of the induction of FIP, ability of the viruses to proliferate in cell cultures, and the antigenic relationship with porcine and canine coronaviruses. FECV has been divided into Types I and II in the same way. Types I and II of FIPV in this classification can be serologically discriminated by the neutralization test. FIPV Type I and FECV Type II can also be distinguished by the neutralization test. Cultivation of FECV Type I in cells is not possible at present, and its serological position remains unclear. On the other hand, even the neutralization test cannot discriminate between FIPV Type II and FECV Type II. It goes without saying that, since all feline coronaviruses show cross-reaction in IFA, it is impossible to discern the types of virus infection. There are many healthy but FIPV antibody-positive cats living outdoors. As long as FIPV Type II and FECV Type II cannot be distinguished serologically, the clinical diagnostic significance of antibody detection in such cats is low.",

Among the FIPV strains used in the study, strains UCD-1, NW-1, UCD-2, UCD-3, UCD-4, Black, Yayoi and KU-2 show cell-associated growth, and are therefore regarded as Type I virus strains in the classification of Pedersen et al.

Table 3 shows their reactivity with 11 strains of feline coronavirus. All 16 MAbs in Group I reacted with feline coronaviruses. Besides feline coronaviruses, these MAbs reacted with the 1-71 strain of CCV, and the SH and TO-163 strains of TGEV. These results confirm the previous reports (Pedersen et al., 1978; Horzinek et al., 1982; Pedersen et al., 1984a) that these virus strains are antigenically close to each other. Concerning polypeptide specificity, many MAbs in this Group I recognize E 1 protein. Among these viruses, many common epitopes seem to exist, particularly in the E 1 protein. Among eight virus strains with the characteristics of FIPV Type I, reactivities of E6-2 and E22-2 in Group II, and F29-2 in Group III with the MAbs were different, and all of these MAbs recognized N protein. Four MAbs in Group IV (F50-4, F46-4, F69-3 and F 15-2 ) reacted with the 79-1146 and KU-1 strains of FIPV Type II and strain 79-1683 strain of FECV Type II, but not with FIPV Type I viruses. Of these MAbs, however, F50-4 reacted with CCV, and F46-4 and F69-3 reacted with CCV and TGEV. Similarly, among the MAbs in Group V, which react with FIPV Type II viruses alone, F6-3 reacted with CCV, and F24-1 and F49-1 reacted with the SH strain of TGEV. Furthermore, all MAbs in Group VI, which react with the 79-1683 strain of FECV alone reacted with CCV. As Pedersen et al. (1984a) have reported from their study with polyclonal antibody, these results suggest that FIPV Type II viruses and FECV Type II viruses are antigenically closer to TGEV or CCV than to FIPV Type I viruses. At present, the authors are preparing MAbs with neutralizing activity using FIPV strain 79-1146 as immunogen, and are determining the serological re-lationships among these viruses by the presence or absence of the neutralization epitope. Moreover, since all 12 MAbs in Groups IV, V and VI recognize E2 protein, it was assumed that there are many antigenic differences in E2 protein among these viruses. By using MAbs, also found antigenic differences among feline coronaviruses, especially in the E2 protein.",

These MAbs have enabled the discrimination of these viruses, by clearly indicating antigenic differences among them. The proportions of Types I and II of FIPV and Types I and II of FECV actually present in the natural environment are not clear. As stated in the introduction, the neutralizing test can appraise infection with Type I and II of FIPV at the serological level. However, in the case of infection with viruses other than FIPV Type I, distinction of infection particularly by FIPV Type II an FECV Type II at the serological level is difficult. In the future, it will be of use to be able to distinguish infection of these viruses by competitive enzyme immunoassay (Fiscus et al., 1985; using type-specific MAbs.
