For the purpose of this chapter, an SME is defined as a company with fewer than 500 people in staff, but turnover is ignored. Readers should recognize that the fluid nature of the pharmaceutical industry (frequent start-ups, mergers, takeovers, and closures) indicates that companies described in this chapter may well not be around in their current forms even in 1-5 years' time. Conversely, some companies that were SMEs 10 or 20 years ago whose activities have impacted drug discovery greatly have now expanded beyond that definition. The impact of these (relatively few) companies which originated as SMEs is consequently great and is discussed below. Traditional large, multinational pharmaceutical companies (big pharma) and small-sized regional or national pharma companies are not included in this chapter, except insofar as how their dealings with SMEs have impacted their own pipelines.",

Hence, discoveries and inventions that might lead to the discovery of a new drug made in the institutions conducting such academic research, have tended to be licensed to traditional pharma, possibly via a university technology transfer office. However, in many cases, particularly entrepreneurial scientists have elected to commercialize the IP themselves by founding a company , and a new SME (biotechnology sector company) is born.

Several rounds of VC investments (known as series A, series B, etc.) may well have occurred before the several years of research and development (R&D) necessary to translate ideas into assets have passed. Such rounds may be funded entirely by existing investors, or new investors may join -each round will have dilutive effects on existing shareholders and timings are usually critical to getting best terms and conditions for both existing and new investors. VC companies recognize the longevity of investments (3-7 years is typical of the time required to realize a substantial profit on investment). There are many VC companies that specialize in investing in life-science companies: 3i, Abingworth, Advent, Advent International, Merlin, and MVM are typical UK healthcare company financiers. In some cases, VC companies are associated with parent organization -MVM had its origins in the UK Medical Research Council's desire to exploit its own inspired IP. The value of VC-funded SMEs to drug discovery was examined in a 2004 report commissioned by Pacific Bridge Life Sciences and the Weinberg Group. 8 Stolis and Goodman 8 examined the impact of VC investment on the treatment of chronic diseases and leading causes of death in the US, including cancer, heart disease, stroke, diabetes, asthma, and arthritis. The authors assert that venture-backed medical innovations are developed and made available to patients as much as three times faster than a 'bootstrapping' approach to product development. The report claims that more than 100 million (one in three) Americans have benefited from venture-backed medical innovations developed during the past 20 years. 10 The second typical VC exit from an SME is described in Section 1.13.3.3, below.",

Typical deals can run into hundreds of millions of dollars (including upfront payments, milestone payments, and royalties). A listing of the impact that such in-licensing deals have had on the pipeline of the world's largest pharmaceutical company (as of January 2005), Pfizer, will be discussed in Section 1.13.9.1. Alternatively, SMEs can seek to earn revenue by offering services to big pharma or other SME companies in technologies or areas of resource where such companies are deficient. For big pharma, such offerings can be for new technologies or in areas of expertise that, for whatever reason, the larger organization have elected to consider better outsourced in whole or in part. The trade between SMEs themselves tends to be much greater, albeit SMEs have generally less cash to spend on deals and often seek partnerships described as 'shared-risk,' whereby each partner contributes resources to a project with the objective of sharing the rewards later. Typical SME technology and service companies in the drug discovery sector include those selling technologies to perform gene sequencing, target  identification and validation, hit-finding, lead optimization compound profiling, good laboratory practice and good  manufacturing practice preclinical and clinical studies, and pharmaceutical profiling, as well as chemical scale-up.

The mergers of Fujisawa and Yamanouchi, announced in 2004, and the ambition of companies like Takeda may allow the emergence of similar concentrations of SMEs, but hitherto there are few such companies. One homegrown Japanese SME engaged in drug discovery, Sosei, is located in Tokyo -the founder of this company was Shinichi Tamura, the former chief executive officer of Genentech Japan. 17 It is interesting that one Japanese pharmaceutical company, Tanabe, has deliberately created a Biotech spinout, MediciNova, but this is based in San Diego. Government assistance in the location of drug discovery SMEs should also not be ignored. Many governments recognize the assets that a strong biotechnology business can bring to their country, and tax advantages are often given to companies locating in certain territories. Few countries have been as ambitious as Singapore, which has created a large science park for this end. 18 The academic research centers that are at the core of the science park are: the Institute of Molecular and Cell Biology, the Natural Product Research (CNPR: privatized in 2003 to become MerLion Pharmaceuticals), the Genome Institute of Singapore (formed in 2000) and the Johns Hopkins Institute -an offshoot of the US-based institute of the same name. Of the major companies located in Singapore, GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis are present, whilst Chiron has established S*BIO, formed through a partnership with the Singapore Economic Development Board Investments (EDBI). S*BIO is a chemistry-driven, product-oriented company, with a focus on cancer, with the objective of identifying and developing novel, small-molecule anticancer drug candidates from its own leading-edge research, as well as through joint collaborations with external partners.

            "text": "Traditional big pharma prior to the 1980s was (with the exception of vaccine businesses) almost exclusively smallmolecule-based. The rise of biologicals as pharmaceutical therapies based upon the molecular biology technologies of the 1980s and 1990s allowed several companies (Amgen, Genentech, Biogen Idec, and Chiron) that began life as SMEs to become world-class players in their own rights before or despite the best efforts of big pharma to compete with them or acquire them. Indeed, with the exception of Genentech (now majority-owned by Roche), the remainder have maintained their independence. It is, however, salient to realize that all these SMEs that have become big pharma players in their own rights were established to research and develop biological agents (antibodies, proteins) rather than (in the first instance) small molecules. Only subsequently, after success gained by getting biological products on the markets, have some turned to small-molecule research. The major success stories of SMEs turning into major competitors of traditional big pharma are shown in Table 4 . Clearly, in the first tier (market capitalizations over $25 billion) are Amgen and Genentech (actually majority-owned by Roche but still separately quoted); in the second tier (market capitalizations greater than $5 billion) are Biogen Idec, Gilead, Chiron (at the end of 2005 Chiron had agreed to be acquired by Novartis), and Sepracor, and in tier 3 ($1-5 billion) are Millennium, Vertex, and Cephalon. It is instructive to note which products of these companies have reached the marketplace, and thus contributed to those companies achieving fully integrated pharmaceutical company (FIPCO) status.",

As of January 2004, Novartis owned 42% of Chiron's outstanding common stock, following an alliance established in January 1995.

In contrast to the biology-oriented SME successes, no SME that began life as a small-molecule drug discovery house has yet become a global competitor to traditional big pharma, although Gilead, Ligand, Sepracor, Vertex, and Millennium are probably the closest to achieving that ambition and have already grown well beyond the SME definitions given above. Gilead Sciences, headquartered in Foster City, CA, was founded in 1987 and has more than 1500 employees in 2005, making it too large to be fairly considered an SME. Gilead has several antiinfectious products on the market: * Emtricitabine, a nucleoside analog licensed from Emory University that is structurally related to 3TC for the treatment of HIV infection * Cidofovir, a specific nucleotide inhibitor of viral replication, which was launched in an injectable formulation in 1996 * Oseltamivir (Tamiflu: 5), a neuraminidase inhibitor, for the treatment and prevention of influenza virus type A or B infections * Tenofovir disoproxil fumarate (6), an oral prodrug of the intravenously administered antiviral agent tenofovir used for the treatment and prophylaxis of HIV infection * AmBisome, a liposomal formulation of amphotericin B, jointly developed by NeXstar and Lyphomed, marketed for systemic fungal infections and in the US for cancer and acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) patients with blood-borne fungal infections * Adefovir dipivoxil, an analog of the reverse transcriptase inhibitor adefovir for the treatment of HBV infection. Ligand Pharmaceuticals. Ligand Pharmaceuticals (San Diego, CA) was founded in 1987 to develop gene transcription technologies, particularly an intracellular receptor (IR) technology and signal transducers and activators of transcription (STATs). The company has applied these technologies to discover and develop novel small-molecule drugs for the treatment of cancer and osteoporosis, as well as gynecologic, dermatologic, cardiovascular, and inflammatory diseases. Ligand is a company that has achieved the status of having launched products, and as of 2005, its portfolio included the following US Food and Drug Administration-approved drugs: morphine sulfate extended-release capsules, alitretinoin (7), bexarotene, and denileukin diftitox.",

This funding has been supplemented by another h23 million in 2005. Newron focuses on the discovery and development of diagnostics and therapeutics of the nervous system, particularly epilepsy, neurodegenerative disorders, and pain. The company runs preclinical research up to the early phases of clinical development, then pursues partners for continued development. The lead compound, safinamide (29), was licenced from Pharmacia & Upjohn and is a sodium-channel blocker, calcium-channel modulator, glutamate release inhibitor, and a dopamine metabolism modulator (monoamine oxidase B inhibition/dopamine uptake inhibitor), with potential for the treatment of epilepsy, Parkinson's disease, and restless-legs syndrome.

Most recently, Tripos has pioneered the idea of 'lead hopping' to get patentable series. China) ), or by the previously established companies electing to set up subsidiaries taking advantage of high-technology -and cheaper -workforces (Albany Molecular, Singapore). The apparent improvement of the ability of companies to enforce IP rights in India and China is partly responsible for the increased shift in outsourcing of drug discovery activities to these countries. One consequence of this shift has been the willingness for some US service providers to set up satellite operations in India or in Singapore (Pharmacopeia) to take advantage of reduced cost bases in competitive markets. High-technology biological screening engines have long been sourced from expert engineering companies: Technology Partnership (Melbourn, UK) formed a consortium with Rh\u00f4ne-Poulenc and AstraZeneca to develop its laser-screening engine for cellular screening. This instrument is in competition with another SME-inspired device, the optical high-throughput screening engine developed by Axon Instruments (which was acquired on July 1, 2004 by Molecular Devices (Union City, CA)). Developing this theme, SMEs have continued to develop difficult screening technologies, particularly ion channel screening, where the required personnel with biophysics disciplines are rare in typical drug discovery companies; these include CeNeS (Cambridge, UK) and Axon Instruments (CA). The latter has developed two products for ion channel screening: (1) a parallel electrophysiology system in which ion channel activity in eight oocytes at a time can be recorded automatically; and (2) an instrument for the parallel recording of ion channels in mammalian cell lines using the patch-clamp technique. SME companies performing high-throughput screening services include BioFocus Discovery and also Evotec Technologies (an affiliate of Evotec-OAI) (Germany). Evotec pioneered ultrahigh-throughput screening in the mid-1990s; development was supported by a consortium including GlaxoSmithKline and Novartis. Evotec has performed contract high-throughput screening on targets from Novartis. 71 1.13. 8.4 Hit and Lead Optimization Companies (US), BioFocus DPI (Saffron Walden, UK), Argenta Discovery (Harlow, UK), Evotec-OAI (Hamburg, Germany and Oxford, UK) and Nikem (Milan, Italy). Big pharma partners include GlaxoSmithKline (Nikem, Argenta), J&J (BioFocus DPI), and Novartis (Argenta Discovery). In general, big pharma outsources such activities because of internal capacity constraints, rather than a perceived lack of technology -the critical factor is generally recognized that medicinal chemistry optimization is a stage where experience is very valuable. To this end, companies like Biofocus Discovery have concentrated on projects where substantial in-house expertise has been built up -projects involving kinase targets, ion channel targets, and 7-TM targets. In some cases, niche technology areas can be acquired by SMEs performing contract drug discovery. Big pharma has largely abandoned natural products as a source of hits and drugs in the late 1990s; nonetheless, natural products SMEs exist and in one case (Biofrontera), the company has recently been acquired by DPI (March 2005) . 72 It may be that natural product research will be kept alive in the future by specialist SME companies rather than in big pharma research centers.",

It is difficult to give an overall assessment of which recently launched drugs have had any form of input from an SME organization. It is, however, possible to perform an analysis of all drugs that have reached the market in the past 10 years for those whose IP originated in an SME. This can be performed by analyzing the chapters entitled ''To market, to market'' in the 10 years' editions of Annual Reports in Medicinal Chemistry from 1993 to 2002. [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] [84] [85] [86] [87] [88] The survey of the origins of new drugs over 10 years between 1993 and 2002 shows (Table 5 and Figure 1 ) that the proportion of new drugs originating from the laboratories of big/traditional pharma has stayed steady at around 50-75% depending on individual company. The proportion of new drugs originating from the biotech sector -companies which are SMEs, or were SMEs when patents were filed -has grown substantially to 25-33%. Academic sources of drugs remain steady at 5-10%. The sector that has contracted is that of the small pharma organization, once a subsidiary of a larger conglomerate or pharmaceutical manufacturing or generics company. Many such Japanese companies were sources of new drugs in the early part of these 10 years. It should be noted that, over the years surveyed, the majority of the new drugs that were invented by SMEs were brought to the market by traditional pharma companies (after licenses were taken to third-party products or the originating SME companies were acquired).",

Companies put into clinical trials drugs that were either discovered by the in-house teams of chemists, or cross-licensed between the large companies -little cross-licensing occurred before the clinical development stage. The companies were usually traditionally located close to their industrial roots, often relatively far apart geographically. The situation in 2005 is vastly different. The impact of mergers since 1990 has created mammoth companies (SmithKline and Beecham, Wellcome, and Glaxo, all now part of GlaxoSmithKline; Warner Lambert, Pharmacia, and Pfizer all now being known as Pfizer). However, the combination of the major pharmaceutical companies has spawned a whole host of spinout companies, many in the field of drug discovery. In addition, many universities recognize the worth of the IP they generate and create spinout SME companies to maximize it. Drug discovery is such a multidisciplinary task that few SMEs ever become proficient in all disciplines, and the majority of SME companies have become intensely interdependent on each other. Such enforced sharing of objectives and ideals has formed the biotech communities of California, Massachusetts, and Medicon Valley, amongst others, and is being emulated in territories like Singapore. Each localized community has provided a forum for intellectual discussions that lead to innovation. This is now being recognized by big pharma which in some cases is moving its own R&D sites to such geographical clusters.",

This is because the vast development sums required to develop and market each potential medicine are usually too large for biotech to resource. As of 2005, big pharma appears to have maintained its traditional preponderance of invention of drugs. Nonetheless, it is likely that biotech will be a significant (if not ultimately the major) source of new drugs to big pharma and ultimately the patient population. The concept that big pharma may entirely abandon its own research groups and source its compounds entirely from SME/biotech organizations, however, still looks unjustified in 2006, and on the basis of the analysis of Pfizer's pipeline, remains some way from happening. potential medicines that reached clinical trial status in cardiovascular, respiratory, and inflammatory disorders.

The first is an IPO, where the public is invited to subscribe to the shares of the company and the venture capitalists are then able to liquidate a part, or all, of their shareholding. The timing of IPOs is very market-sensitive, not only to the individual company prospects but also to the public and analysts' perception of the industry sector as a whole. The so-called IPO windows can open and close in very short timeframes. Despite good news on a company's prospects (for example, Edinburgh (Scotland)-based Ardana Biosciences released a press release claiming that its prostate cancer treatment, Teverelix, was successful in phase II clinical trials 9 ), sometimes IPOs fail to raise the money expected or needed. Ardana Bioscience achieved an IPO on Alternative Investment Market (AIM) in March 2005 but the share price achieved (d1.28) was apparently disappointing. It did, however, net Ardana some $38 million to $32 million after expenses. In certain cases, IPOs can be withdrawn at short order when a healthcare bad-news story impacts public confidence in share subscriptions, as occurred with the UK-based company Phytopharm (a company specializing in natural product research)in March 2005.
