This virus, administered intratumorally every 2 weeks for malignant melanoma, led to complete resolution in 47% of injected tumors and boosted systemic antitumor immunity leading to resolution of 9% of distant un infected visceral tumors [12] .

However, it is too early to determine which unique viral characteristics will be the critical drivers of clinical success for a given cancer type. Reverse genetics systems are available for virtually all virus families, and the rules of engagement for new virus creation are well established. In general, the most effective strategy is to combine rational design with evolution, allowing each engineered virus to mutate and fully adapt to its intended target cells after it has been rescued. Biosafety oversight is in place at all academic centers responsibly engaging in virus engineering activities, and it is now a relatively straightforward matter to generate and test new virus configurations using what now amounts to the world's best lego set. Viral gene and noncoding sequences can be modified in a variety of ways to add or eliminate functions and nonviral genes or noncoding regulatory elements, whether synthetic or naturally occurring, can be added into viral genomes to confer additional desirable properties. The overarching engineering goal for the oncolytic virotherapy field is to generate viruses that can be efficiently delivered to disseminated tumors in the body where they will spread and selectively kill both infected and uninfected tumor cells, without causing collateral damage and posing no risk of transmission to the population.",

            "text": "Viral infections are well understood but for OV applications must be viewed as drugs obeying pharmacological principles. A drug is typically administered to a patient in an extremely controlled way to produce a reliable, consistent and predictable pharmacokinetic profile (absorption, biodistribution, metabolism and excretion) and bioavailability. Natural viral infections do not obey these rules since the inoculum is of variable size; host resistance varies from person to person; and the kinetics of the adaptive immune response differ greatly between individuals. Thus, the outcomes of natural infections with a given pathogenic virus range from asymptomatic seroconversion to full blown disease. The primary virus inoculum must contain sufficient virus particles to overcome initial host defenses at the site of entry. Some viruses enter through mucous membranes in the GI or respiratory tracts, while others enter via direct inoculation into the blood stream following a needle stick or arthropod blood meal [58] . OVs are delivered in the same way as traditional drugs, by introducing a highly concentrated virus inoculum into the body via oral, intravenous (IV), intranasal, transdermal, subcutaneous or intramuscular routes whereupon the dispersion of the inoculated virus, or its progeny, takes it to the targeted cancerous tissues. A major factor distinguishing OVs from traditional drugs is that they self-amplify and spread after delivery so their peak concentration may not be reached until sometime after the treatment is administered. Biological amplification by viral replication is the most important difference between viral therapies and traditional drugs. The concentration of a drug diminishes over time at a very well described rate depending on the clearance and elimination from the body. Through the course of a viral infection the viral load is initially small and then increases and finally decreases rather than just following a specific rate law of elimination. Limited amounts of virus particles replicate at the site of inoculation [59] . Input or progeny viruses then can either drain with the lymphatic fluid to the nearest lymph node, go directly into circulation or spread locally before spreading systemically to eventually arrive at a specific target organ. Pathology is induced by high levels of viral replication in the target organ directly killing infected cells or recruiting the immune system to kill them, at the same time provoking a local inflammatory response.",

The higher the number and the more random the dispersion of infectious centers established in a tumor after delivery of virus, the more effective the virus will be, although these parameters must be optimized for each virus and model [61] . IV and IT administrations of OVs are common delivery methods that introduce large amounts of virus into one compartment in a very short time. This rapid delivery of a massive virus inoculum does not parallel what typically occurs in a natural infection and potentially allows the IT spread of the OV infection to outpace host defenses.

In a clinical setting, systemic delivery may be preferred since it is more broadly applicable than IT inoculation, regardless of tumor location and total tumor burden. Yet, attempts at systemic delivery have shown limited success; the administered virus is immediately diluted in the circulating blood volume (\u223c5 l), so extremely high doses are needed to achieve meaningful circulating titers. A clinical trial using an oncolytic pox virus, JX-594, demonstrated that virus could only be detected in tumors of patients that received at least 10 9 p.f.u. per IV dose without any virus being detected in tumors of the lower dose cohorts of patients [62] . Because of this important dilution effect, doses required for IV therapy may have to be up to 1000-fold higher than for IT administration, which results in significant manufacturing challenges as well as a unique set of toxicities [2] . Administration of high titers of virus intravenously can lead to hepatotoxicity, thrombocytopenia and lymphopenia [33, 63] .",

Alternatively, the immunodominant epitopes of the measles surface glycoproteins can be modified by mutating key surface residues to eliminate them, or by introducing glycosylation signals so they are shielded by N-linked glycans [84] . It is worth noting that all of these virus engineering strategies have the potential to alter viral receptor usage and hence tumor cell tropism which may limit their utility [83, 85] .",

No traditional chemotherapy, immunotherapy or small molecule inhibitor can target tumor cells and then amplify at the site of action and spread to other sites of tumor growth. Specificity as well as speed and extent of IT virus replication are the key determinants of therapeutic index (efficacy/toxicity ratio) for an OV therapeutic, and each of these parameters can be modified by virus engineering. Additionally, the kinetics of spread can be impacted by combining the virus with immunomodulatory drugs. The idea of a virus with selective tropism for cancerous tissue has obvious appeal. Even for naturally occurring viruses that have not been tropism modified, a tumor offers a favorable environment to support a productive infection, and this is borne out by case reports of temporary remission or regression of different cancers concurrent with viral infections [4, 93] . There are several reasons why tumors are generally more susceptible than normal tissues to virus attack; poorly developed lymphatics, high nonsuppressible metabolic activity, resistance to apoptosis, poor responsiveness to interferon and intrinsic suppression of immune effector cells. But as we move in the direction of intentionally using virus infections to mediate tumor destruction, it is apparent that a targeted virus with exquisite tumor specificity will be superior to its non targeted counterpart, allowing for the administration of higher tumor destructive doses without toxicity to normal tissues.",

Examples include the CD46 receptor tropism of vaccine lineage measles virus and the heparan sulfate tropism of laboratory-adapted Sindbis virus [94, 95] . Where greater specificity is desired, it may be possible to engineer new receptor tropisms by modifying the structure of a viral attachment protein, for example, by displaying polypeptide ligands at the extreme C-terminus of the measles H glycoprotein [96, 97] . However, for many viruses, displaying a polypeptide ligand on the surface does no more than redirect attachment and does not confer a new receptor tropism [98] [99] [100] .

The cell resists this takeover bid by rapidly detecting virus invasion, then triggering a signaling cascade that leads to establishment of an antiviral state and release of interferon which induces an anti viral state in adjacent cells [105, 106] .

Insertion of muscle-specific miRNA targets into the viral genome eliminated muscle toxicity but left the antitumor potency of the virus intact. This was shown to be due to miRNA-mediated recognition and rapid destruction of the viral genome in muscle cells. miRNA targeting has since been applied to many OVs from diverse virus families and provides a convenient and economical strategy (using sequence insertions of only \u223c100 bases) to control unwanted virus tropisms [25] .",

Destruction of ECM components can facilitate viral spread throughout the tumor and can be achieved using conventional chemoradiotherapy or by delivering matrix-degrading enzymes such as collagenase and hyaluronidase [127] . An alternative approach is to encode a matrix-degrading enzyme or inducer of matrixdegrading enzymes in the viral genome.

Picornaviruses, VSV and vaccinia virus can release up to 10,000 progeny from a single infected cell after a delay of only 6-18 h [131] [132] [133] . In addition to innate antiviral immunity, adaptive cell-mediated immune responses are typically required for the complete elimination of a viral infection and act by eliminating infected cells before progeny can be released. Oncolytic virotherapy can therefore be viewed as a race between the spreading virus and the responding immune system. For this reason, faster moving viral infections are often considered capable of inflicting greater damage to an infected tumor before they can be contained by the immune system [134] . However, in defense of the viruses with smaller burst sizes, or which release progeny by budding, they tend to be less review Maroun, Mu\u00f1oz-Al\u00eda, Ammayappan, Schulze, Peng & Russell future science group rapidly controlled both by the innate and adaptive host immune responses [135] .

Killing of these uninfected (bystander) cancer cells is therefore critical if oncolytic virotherapy is to become a curative, as opposed to just a tumor debulking strategy. Bystander killing can be achieved, both locally at the site of a spreading infection and systemically at uninfected tumor sites, by genetically arming the virus using one of several possible approaches. For example, an OV can be engineered to encode a secreted protein that selectively mediates the destruction of neighboring and/or distant cancer cells. Alternatively, it can be armed with a 'suicide gene' or prodrug convertase whose encoded protein converts a harmless prodrug to a diffusible anticancer drug. In a third approach, the OV can be armed with a 'radioconcentrator gene' so that infected tumor cells are able to concentrate a \u03b2-emitting radioisotope whose emitted electrons damage adjacent uninfected tumor cells. Fourth, it can be engineered to fuse infected tumor cells with uninfected neighboring cells. And last, but by no means least, it can be engineered to express one or more genes capable of amplifying immune-mediated killing of uninfected tumor cells. Each of these approaches is discussed below using specific examples to illustrate the concepts.",

TK converts ganciclovir to ganciclovir monophosphate which is further processed intracellularly to ganciclovir triphosphate, a DNA synthesis chain terminator that kills dividing cells as they enter S phase [138] . A major weakness of the TK-ganciclovir system, aside from its inability to kill nondividing tumor cells, is that it has very limited bystander killing potential. This is because ganciclovir monophosphate is not released from the cell in which it is generated, so does not impact uninfected tumor cells unless they are connected to the infected cell via gap junctions through which it can pass [139] . Encoding connexin, a gap junction protein, in the OV genome can enhance the bystander killing effect of TK, but attention is shifting to other convertases, most notably CD.",

The argument supporting the CD/5-FC system is that local production of 5-FU in the OV-infected tumor will create a 5-FU concentration gradient that will expose tumor cells to a higher concentration of the drug compared with distant tissues, thereby ameliorating toxicity and enhancing the therapeutic index of the drug. However, 5-FU is freely diffusible so local production of the drug in a CD-positive tumor exposed to high concentrations of 5-FC can lead to systemic toxicity [140] . The dose of 5-FC must therefore be adjusted accordingly. CD has been incorporated into several OVs including adenoviruses, paramyxoviruses and poxviruses, but the one that has advanced ahead of all others in clinical testing is a C-type retrovirus, Toca-511, which is currently being evaluated in a Phase III clinical trial for the treatment of patients with malignant glioma [141] [142] [143] .

Radioiodine is therefore used routinely in the clinic for thyroid imaging and for ablation of overactive thyroid tissue, including metastatic thyroid cancer. This is facilitated by the ready availability of several iodine radioisotopes, most notably 123 Ifor \u03b3 camera and single-photon emission computed tomography imaging, 124- for PET imaging and 131 I -, a \u03b2-emitting isotope, for thyroid ablation. Besides radioiodine, NIS can concentrate several related anions, of equal or greater value for single-photon emission computed tomography ( 99m TcO 4 -, pertechnetate), PET (B 18 F 4 -, tetrafluoroborate) and tissue ablation ( 211 At -, astatide, 188 ReO 4 -, perrhenate) [147] . The \u03b2 emissions of 131 Ihave an average path length of approximately 1.8 mm in tissue and can therefore inflict significant damage on cells adjacent to an 131 I --loaded NIS expressing cell. For 188 ReO 4 the \u03b2 emission path length is longer such that NIS negative tumor cells are even more likely to be damaged in the \u03b2 particle crossfire when this radioisotope is used. Unsurprisingly, therefore, the NIS gene has been engineered into several OVs whose IT spread has been elegantly mapped and monitored in tumor-bearing mice by serial radiotracer imaging, and whose potency has been substantially boosted by appropriately timed administration of 131 I - [148] . At least two NIS-expressing OVs, a prostate-targeted oncolytic adenovirus and a CD46-targeted measles virus, have been advanced to human clinical trials with positive imaging data reported [11, 149] .",

This virus-to-cell fusion reaction is mediated by FMGs embedded in the envelope of the virus, and may occur at the cell surface at neutral pH, or in the endo-somal compartment at acidic pH [150] . Neutral pH fusion is triggered by receptor attachment. Cells expressing certain virally encoded, neutral pH-active FMGs on their surface may fuse with neighboring receptor positive cells (cell-to-cell fusion), giving rise to multinucleated syncytia, the hallmark cytopathic signature of a fusogenic virus (e.g., measles) [151] . But more often the FMG is activated only after its incorporation into a budding virus particle, so cannot cause cell-tocell fusion, and must be modified, for example, by cytoplasmic tail truncation, to render it constitutively fusogenic. Either way, FMG-driven fusion of OV-infected cells with uninfected neighboring cells leads to increased bystander killing because multinucleated syncytia are nonviable as well as being highly immunogenic [152] . Based on these observations, nonfusogenic OVs have been armed with FMGs thereby conferring superior oncolytic potency [123, 153] . In one example, an oncolytic herpes virus was rendered highly fusogenic when engineered to encode a cytoplasmically truncated gibbon ape leukemia virus envelope glycoprotein [154] [155] [156] while in another study, an oncolytic VSV was rendered highly fusogenic by replacing its surface glycoprotein (G) with the hemagglutinin and fusion glycoproteins of measles virus.",

            "text": "Tumor cells are intrinsically immunogenic because of their mutational burden. 'Driver' mutations disrupt their ability to respond to normal growth regulatory signals whereas 'passenger' mutations occur at random throughout the genome and are unique to a given tumor. Some of these mutations change the coding sequence of an expressed protein, resulting in the generation of nonself-peptides that can be presented at the cell surface as neoantigenic MHC-peptide complexes or neoepitopes [157] . In order to avoid immune detection and destruction, cancers must therefore evade the immune system, which they do very effectively. Thus, tumors lack lymphatic channels and sustain high interstitial pressures, impeding leucocyte extravasation. They release immunosuppressive substances such as prostaglandin E2 and TGF\u03b2 and reprogram macrophages from M1 to M2 phenotypes, destroying their ability to process and present tumor antigens. They may even lose the ability to present MHC-peptide complexes on the tumor cell surface [158] . Many tumor review Maroun, Mu\u00f1oz-Al\u00eda, Ammayappan, Schulze, Peng & Russell future science group cells also overexpress PD-L1 and B7.1 receptors on their surface as a last line of defense against attacking T lymphocytes. These checkpoint receptors interact with PD-1 or CTLA4 on the surface of approaching T cells, leading to T-cell anergy. Checkpoint inhibitor anti bodies, which are currently transforming the field of immunooncology, block these PD-1/PD-L1 and/or CTLA4/B7 interactions thereby 'unveiling' the cancer and rendering it susceptible to T-cellmediated killing [159] . Because of their ability to amplify immune-mediated killing of uninfected tumor cells, OVs may be ideal partners for checkpoint inhibitor antibody therapy and can be engineered in various ways to maximize their immune enhancing properties [13, 160] .",

Off-target infection and killing of normal cells by poorly targeted OVs or by OVs that have evolved new tropisms in a treated patient can cause unwanted normal tissue pathology. OVs are therefore delicately balanced between retaining enough virulence to substantially decrease tumor burden versus being sufficiently targeted (or attenuated) to not cause a new disease in the patient. Cancer-specific targeting is the most critical safety feature, but viruses evolve and viral populations are dynamic [172] . Evolution is a constant accompaniment of a spreading virus infection, whether or not the virus is oncolytic; in vivo progeny of the therapeutic OV differs on average by a single -point mutation per genome from the input virus [173] . Hence, as the input virus is amplified, it generates a swarm of quasispecies viruses, each one a slightly imperfect replica of the input virus. This swarm of progeny viruses is subjected to selective pressure as it encounters new biological niches in the treated cancer patient. Thus, if it so happens that a member of the swarm is capable of infecting a normal host tissue, the virus may have gained a new foothold from which to further evolve. Gaining new cell tropisms or losing restriction factors is therefore a significant theoretical concern in oncolytic infections, but has not yet been documented in human trials, nor in preclinical models. However, given the importance of this particular scenario, a great deal of attention is paid to the problem not just by investigators, but also by regulatory agencies.",

RNA and DNA viruses exist as a population of quasispecies or collections of related viral genomes undergoing variation and selective pressure [174] . Generation of quasispecies occurs when viral genomes are copied during the replication cycle. Viral polymerases typically have an error rate that introduces an average of one or more base mutations per progeny genome [175] . In general, the larger the virus genome, the lower the polymerase error rate. Picornaviruses are among the smallest viruses being developed for oncolytic therapy with positive sense RNA genomes ranging from 7 to 9 kb in length, and their RNA polymerases have a correspondingly high intrinsic error rate. Production of a virus for clinical application is a highly regulated process and involves multiple rounds of replication to achieve enough virus for patients. The viral product is therefore already a swarm of quasispecies at the time it is administered to the patient and mutates further as it undergoes additional rounds of replication in vivo. Studies of the mutation rates of viral polymerases, the generation of quasi species, the evolution of viral populations and the evolution between dominant subspecies within a virus population are therefore of great interest and relevance to the OV field.",
