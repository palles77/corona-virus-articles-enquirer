It is thought that lipid rafts are enriched in cholesterol, glycosphingolipids, sphingomyelin, phospholipids with long, unsaturated acyl chains, glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI)-linked proteins and at least some membranespanning proteins (Simons and van Meer, 1988; Simons and Ikonen, 1997; Simons and Toomre, 2000) . Approximately 15-20% of the plasma membrane surface area is believed to consist of lipid rafts (Parolini et al., 1999; Schutz et al., 2000) . The tight packaging domains are associated with numerous important biological processes, such as transmembrane signal transduction, apoptosis, cell adhesion, migration, synaptic transmission, organization of the cytoskeleton, and protein sorting during endocytosis and exocytosis (Brown and London, 1998; Simons and Toomre, 2000; Harris and Siu, 2002; Tsui-Pierchala et al., 2002) . However, the extraction of cholesterol by various chemicals destroys the raft organization and consequently blocks biological processes that depend on lipid rafts. So the function of lipid rafts in some biological process can be evaluated by studying the role of cholesterol.",

Here, we examined the role of cholesterol for both viral envelope and target cell membrane for bovine herpesvirus type 1 (BoHV-1) infection. Cholesterol depletion by pretreatment of Madin-Darby bovine kidney (MDBK) cells with a cholesterol-sequestering drug methyl-b-cyclodextrin (MbCD), inhibited the production of BoHV-1 in a dose-dependent manner. This inhibitory effect was partially reversed by cholesterol replenishment, indicating that the reduction was caused by cholesterol depletion. Cholesterol depletion at the post-entry stage only had a mild effect on the virus production. However, cell membrane cholesterol depletion did not reduce the virus attachment. In addition, treatment of BoHV-1 particles with MbCD also reduced the virus infectivity significantly and the effect was partially reversed by addition of exogenous cholesterol. Taken together, these data implicated that cell membrane cholesterol mainly contributed to BoHV-1 entry into MDBK cells and the viral envelope cholesterol was also essential for the virus infectivity.",

BoHV-1 is an enveloped virus which is rich in lipid rafts. So the role of cholesterol for the virus infection in both viral envelope and target cell membrane should be investigated, respectively. Firstly our observation showed that productive virus entry was significantly reduced when the MDBK cells membrane cholesterol was reduced by the treatment of MbCD. During the investigation the drug-treated cells were washed extensively before the addition of virus, Fig. 4 . Cholesterol depletion did not reduce attachment of BoHV-1. (a) Binding of BoHV-1 to the target cells was determined with virus titration. MDBK cells were mock treated or were treated with 5 and 10 mM MbCD for 30 min, and then binding of BoHV-1 to the cells was processed at 4 8C for 1h. The amount of cell-associated virus was titrated in MDBK cells. (b) Binding of BoHV-1 to the target cells was determined with FACS. Cells were mock treated or treated with 10 mM MbCD and then infected or mock infected with BoHV-1 at 4 8C. At 1h later, the cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and stained with bovine anti-BoHV-1 serum followed by FITC-conjugated anti-bovine immunoglobulin. Experiments were repeated three times, and the error bars indicate the standard deviations of three independent experiments. Image is one of three independent experiments. allowing cholesterol from the target cells to be reduced exclusively, whilst the virus particle cholesterol remained intact. Similarly, when investigated the role of viral envelope cholesterol for the virus infectivity, the drug treated virions were separated from the reagent by ultracentrifugation. So that the disruption of cell membrane lipid rafts by MbCD was excluded. Depletion of cholesterol from viral membrane and cell membrane by MbCD pretreatment significantly inhibited the virus production, and the inhibitory effect could be partially reversed by exogenous cholesterol replenishment indicating that the decreased infectivity was at least in part due to the depletion of cholesterol from the membranes.",

To investigate whether lipid rafts play a role in the post-entry step(s), we treated the cells with MbCD after the virus entry. The results on virus production revealed that Treat: +1 also inhibited virus replication, but compared to Treat: \u00c00.5 the effect of the later was much more significant.

The virus receptor(s) for BoHV-1 has not yet been well defined. Two proteins as the candidate receptors with molecular weight of 56 and 60 kDa had been reported (Thaker et al., 1994; Varthakavi and Minocha, 1996) . But the amino acid sequence for the two proteins is unknown. Connolly et al. (2001) reported that BoHV-1 gD could bind to human nectin-1 with low affinity. However, the affinity of BoHV-1 gD for bovine nectin-1 is unknown. And there is no evidence reported by the others, indicating that nectin-1 on the native bovine cells surface could bind to BoHV-1 gD. And based on their data Connolly et al. (2001) predicted that BoHV-1 infection of its natural host may be mediated by a receptor other than a bovine nectin-1 homolog. Their study also indicated that BoHV-1 likely used multiple receptors for entry into bovine cells. So if the bovine nectin-1 homolog serves as receptor for BoHV-1 remains to be determined. Under this condition, whether MbCD treatment affected the receptor(s) and coreceptor(s) expression or the interaction between BoHV-1 and receptor(s) or coreceptor(s) could not be determined until the virus receptor(s) and co-receptors were discovered in the future. In addition, we proposed that some signal molecules located in lipid raft and MbCD treatment destructed corresponding signal transduction process, which was crucial in the virus life cycle. Based on this presume further study is being carried out.",
