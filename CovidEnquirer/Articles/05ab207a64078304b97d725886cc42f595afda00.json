Moreover, HAI significantly increases morbidity, mortality, and medical costs. 2 According to the published statistical data from the National Health Insurance (NHI) of Taiwan in 2011, the estimated extra medical costs of HAI cases are USD 0.92 billion (NTD 27.7 billion). 3 A central line is an invasive medical device and invasive procedures are high-risk factors leading to infection. Based on global surveillance of patients with bloodstream infections, urinary tract infections, or pneumonia, approximately 50% of patients are implanted with an invasive medical device. 4 According to the 2012 surveillance data, the rate of central line associated bloodstream infections (CLABSI) among intensive care units of medical centers and regional hospitals in Taiwan is 5.5 and 3.5/1000 central line days, respectively. 5 Hence, a government-lead force combined with professional organizations promoting central line care quality and creating patient safety is imperative; the Centers for Disease Control, Taiwan (Taiwan CDC) has started planning a national action plan to eliminate CLABSI in Taiwand the central line care quality improvement projectdsince 2012. 6 The phases of the central line care quality improvement project include a planning phase, an executive phase, and a policy evaluation phase.",

The NHI system covers a wide range of outpatient and inpatient services and allows the people in Taiwan to have access to comprehensive medical care. However, the introduction of the system has also increased the numbers of bedridden patients with long-term use of invasive medical devices and procedures. This leads to an increased risk of acquiring HAI. 8, 9 Moreover, there are two other major challenges, including an increase in average life expectancy and the growth of the elderly population, putting the population at large at risk of infection. Furthermore, frequent international travel also facilitates HAI across national borders, posing a serious threat to the public. In the future, the Taiwan CDC will continue to work with stakeholders to promote and execute infection control strategies in order to achieve our ultimate goal of zero tolerance to HAI. 10 ",
