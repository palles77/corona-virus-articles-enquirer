J. Biol. Chem. 268 (8) (DBV) and  the Tellina virus 1 (TV-1) , respectively. The virions are nonenveloped, icosahedral particles with a capsid made by the viral protein 2 (VP2, [2] ); the number 2 following 'VP' corresponds to the relative migration position of this protein \u00c0 from top to bottom \u00c0 among other virion proteins in SDS-PAGE. The birnavirus genome is made by two dsRNA segments, A and B, each consisting of about 3\u00c03.5 thousand base pairs. Genomic segment A encodes a polyprotein precursor (PP) with the NH 2 -pVP2-VP4-VP3-COOH protein organization; a small protein, called VP5 in IBDV, is encoded in a separate overlapping open reading frame. In BSNV and TV-1, the PP includes an additional polypeptide \u00c0 called X and flanked by the pVP2 and VP4 \u00c0 to form the pVP2-X-VP4-VP3 protein organization. Segment B encodes the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (VP1) a fraction of which is covalently bound to the 5 0 -ends of the two strands of the both genomic RNA segments [3] . The birnavirus virus protein 4 processing endopeptidase (VP4) is autoproteolytically released from the PP along with the VP2 precursor pVP2 and VP3 in vivo in infected cells [4\u00c07] and in vitro in cell-free reticulocyte lysates [8, 9] . VP4 remained an enigmatic protease for more than a decade (for a detailed historical account see Leong & Mason [10] ). Two groups have independently presented conclusive evidence for VP4 to be a Ser-Lys protease that is distantly related to bacterial Lon proteases (see Chapters 781 and 782) [8, 9, 11] . VP4 was coined 'non-canonical Lon proteinase' to distinguish it from the bacterial, ATP-dependent homologs [8] . The substrate specificity was first identified for the DXV VP4 protease cleaving between Ser500 and Ala501 and, likely, Ser723 and Ala724 residues (hereafter the PP nomenclature specific for a particular birnavirus) [12] .",

The authentic IBDV and IPNV PP proteolytic processing has also been reported in transient expression systems in eukaryotic cells [15\u00c018] . When expressed in these systems, PP or its fragments, containing VP4 with upstream or downstream sequences, were processed to VP4 and (truncated versions of) pVP2, (X), and VP3. The further conversion of pVP2 into VP2 was evident only when virus-like particles were formed, suggesting that the pVP2-to-VP2 proteolytic conversion is linked to virus morphogenesis [19\u00c021] . The IPNV and IBDV VP4s may cleave in cis and trans, although the latter, less efficient activity has been demonstrated only in studies in E. coli and reticulocyte lysates [8, 9, 11] . The PP cleavage at the VP4kVP3 versus the pVP2kVP4 site was found to be more sensitive to point mutations in the IBDV and IPNV VP4 (and not observed in trans for PP formed in reticulocyte lysates). The VP4kVP3 [6, 15] and pVP2kVP4 [5, 22] interactions do not appear to be crucial for the cleavage at the distal site. The proteolytic processing of the IPNV PP was claimed to be resistant to inhibitors of all protease classes, although the details of this analysis was only published in a thesis [10] . Unlike the canonical Lon, VP4 does not depend on ATP to cleave its protein substrate [8] .",

The Ser652 and Lys692 of IBDV and their counterparts in IPNV, BSNV and TV-1 proved to be indispensable for the catalysis. From all mutations tested in the IBDV Ser652 position, the PP processing tolerated only a Ser652Cys replacement [8] . The proteolytic activity of the IBDV Ser652Cys mutant was selectively inactivated by exposure to 3.5 mM N-ethylmaleimide. Likewise, the proteolytic activity of the IBDV Lys692Arg but not four other Lys692 mutants was activated in the monomolecular reaction at pH 11.0. Collectively, these results strongly imply that Lys692 plays the role of a general base and activates the hydroxyl of Ser652 for catalysis [8] . The chemistry of proteolysis used by VP4 is likely to be conserved across the whole Lon protease family.",

In the VP4 structure of BSNV without a bound substrate, the main chain NH of the Ser692 and Gln691 residues point towards the binding site; these residues most likely contribute atoms to the oxyanion hole. In contrast, the NH group of the highly conserved Gly690, whose equivalent in many serine proteases forms the oxyanion hole, is pointing away from the binding site. The TV-1 VP4 acylenzyme structure [27] revealed the structural conservation of the oxyanion hole that is formed by the main chain amide nitrogen of the catalytic Ser738 and Asn737 (TV-1 amino acid numbering). Ser738 is within hydrogen bonding distance to the scissile carbonyl oxygen. Because the main chain amide nitrogen of Asn737 is too distant to contribute to the oxyanion stabilization, it is possible that the TV-1 VP4 oxyanion hole is only formed during the transition states when the tetrahedral oxyanion is present.",

Likewise, the IPNV S1 was also shallow and hydrophobic, while the S3 pocket is deeper and hydrophilic, allowing it to adapt with a greater variety of residues at the P3 position. Water molecules at the bottom of the pocket may play a role in the fit for a larger variety of side chains (see Figure 779 .1) [27] .

Regardless of the virus origin, all VP4s characterized so far were found soluble when expressed in E. coli and amenable for structural and biochemical studies (see Chung & Paetzel [27] and references therein). However, some differences between VP4s from diverse birnaviruses were also revealed. For instance, recombinant expression of the IPNV VP4 results in the generation of several truncated by-products likely produced through the utilization of internal cleavage sites [11] . Consequently, expression of a proteolytically inactive VP4 mutant (with a replacement of the catalytic Ser or Lys residue) yielded a stable fulllength protein. In contrast, wild-type VP4s from BSNV, TV-1 and IBDV have long half-life times and are stable at high concentrations. An additional distinguishing feature of the IBDV VP4 is that it forms tubules made by homo-multimers in infected cells and heterologous expressing systems. These tubules (named type II tubules to differentiate from those formed by pVP2 in infected cells) are 25 nm in diameter. They may change in appearance during isolation [30] and can be recovered by differential centrifugations from E. coli or cellular lysates. Purifications of other recombinant VP4s were mainly carried out using recombinant His-tagged proteins by nickelaffinity and size-exclusion chromatographies.",

VP4 was detected in IBDV and IPNV virions [22, 31] , although it may be a contamination from unique type II tubules in IBDV [30] . The indispensability of the VP4 proteolytic activity for the virus viability was proved using both IBDV and IPNV ( [8] ; E. Mundt, unpublished data). Further insight into the biological roles of VP4 has been gained using IBDV. The VP4-mediated proteolytic processing of PP is critical for the formation of virion particles, of which two major components, pVP2/VP2 and VP3, are proteolytically derived. Virions of IBDV also contain four peptides derived upon the conversion of pVP2 into VP2. Two IBDV mutants, in which a locus encoding either the first or last VP2 peptide was deleted, were found to be noninfectious [24] . When the PP processing was blocked or heavily impaired by a mutation of the active site of VP4, the expression of VP1 encoded by RNA segment B was not evident in transfected cells [8] . VP4 might trans activate the expression of RNA B (VP1) through the production of VP3 that is known to interact with VP1 [23, 32, 33] and may bind virus RNAs [19, 34] . Complete but slowed PP processing in cells transfected by the active site Ser652Cys mutant was apparently not sufficient for the generation of infectious progeny, indicating that virion biogenesis may be coupled with the PP cleavages in a cleavage-rate restricted manner [8] .",

With the notable exception of Pro in the P3 position of BSNV, they are commonly occupied by the small amino acid residues Ala and Ser. For the P1 0 and P2 0 positions, while no consensus amino acid can be identified for TV-1 and DBV, Ala is most frequent in the P1 0 position and Ser, Asp and Gly are in the P2 0 position. Thus, the cleavages likely occur at the [A/T]XAk[A/F][SDG] sites in IBDV, [T/S]X[A/S]k[A/S/W]G sites in IPNV, [P/A]XAk[A/F/S] [S/D/G] in BSNV, [A/G]XSk[A/F][S/D] in DXV, AXAk in TV-1, and [A/G]X[A/S]k in DBV.",
