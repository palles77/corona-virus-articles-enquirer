The lack of effective therapeutical treatment underlines the importance of research for new antivirals. In this study, we identified Q7R, which actively inhibited PEDV replication with a 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) of 0.014 g/mL. The 50% cytotoxicity concentration (CC 50 ) of Q7R was over 100 g/mL and the derived therapeutic index was 7142. Several structural analogues of Q7R, quercetin, apigenin, luteolin and catechin, also showed moderate anti-PEDV activity. Antiviral drugs and natural compounds revealed ribavirin, interferon-\u2423, coumarin and tannic acid have relative weaker efficacy compared to Q7R. Q7R did not directly interact with or inactivate PEDV particles and affect the initial stage of PEDV infection by interfering of PEDV replication. Also, the effectiveness of Q7R against the other two viruses (TGEV, PRCV) was lower compared to PEDV. Q7R could be considered as a lead compound for development of anti-PEDV drugs to may be used to during the early stage of PEDV replication and the structure-activity data of Q7R may usefully guideline to design other related antiviral agents.",

The MeOH extract (247 g; IC 50 , 82.2 g/mL; CC 50 , 1036.0 g/mL) was separated into two fractions using EtOAc as the non-aqueous phase. The concentrated EtOAc fraction (16.0 g; IC 50 , 4.8 g/mL; CC 50 , 62.1 g/mL) was loaded on a silica gel (Merck, 230-400 mesh, 300 g) column, and eluted with a step-gradient of CHCl 3 :MeOH (100: 0, 98.5:1.5, 97:3, 93.75:6.25, 87.5:12.5, 25:75, 50 :50 and 0:100; each 1 L) to afford eight fractions.

For further purification, the active fraction (combination of fractions from 41 to 43, 1.22 g; IC 50 , <1g/mL; CC 50 , >100 g/mL) was subjected to analytical HPLC (YMC-Pack ODS-MA; i.d. 250 mm \u00d7 10 mm; eluent, 25% aq.

Infectivity of virus stock was determined by the SRB method using cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction and was determined as infectivity of the virus by SRB ID 50 (50% infective dose). Following this, 0.09 mL of diluted virus suspension of PEDV containing CCID 50 (50% cell culture infective dose) of the virus stock to produce a appropriate cytopathic effects within 2 days after infection and 0.01 mL of medium supplemented with typsin-EDTA containing an appropriate concentration of the compounds were added. The antiviral activity of each test material was determined with a 10-fold diluted concentration ranging from 0.1 to 100 g/mL. Three wells were used as virus controls (virus-infected non-drug-treated cells) while three wells were used as cell controls (non-infected non-drug-treated cells).

As a result, it can be concluded that Q7R does not interact with the particles of PEDV, as pre-exposure of the virus to Q7R did not alter the infectivity of PEDV particles (Fig. 1) . Based on the results of the time-course study, pre-incubation of the Vero cells with Q7R did not protect the cells from PEDV infection (Fig. 2) . Furthermore, Q7R can inhibit PEDV infection only when it was added on, during, and early stages after the virus inoculation (1, 2, 4 h), but not after 6 h or later (Fig. 2) . This suggests that the mode of action is not deriven from inhibiting the absorption of virus but results from inhibition at an early stage of viral replication after infection ( Figs. 1 and 2 ).",

In a previous report, rutin (quercetin-3rutinoside) did not express antiviral activity whereas quercitrin (quercetin 3-rhamnoside) possessed similar activity to quercetin against human herpesviruses and adenoviruses (Chiang et al., 2003a,b) . They found that the antiviral activity among the flavonoid glycosides containing the quercetin moiety might be correlated with the species of sugar group at the 3 position. Our results suggest that the antiviral activity of flavonoids against PEDV is correlated with the species of sugar group at the 7 position.",
