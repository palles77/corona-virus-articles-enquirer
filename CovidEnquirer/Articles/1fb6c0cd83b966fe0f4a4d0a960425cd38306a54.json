ProDect BCS RV CHIP detected only 10 positive specimens in which one of them was infected by two different viruses (5 respiratory syncytial virus, 3 parainfluenza virus type 3, 2 adenovirus, and 1 influenza virus type B). The sensitivity, specificity, PPV, NPV, and diagnostic accuracy of ProDect BCS RV CHIP were 25.0%, 100%, 100%, 66.6%, and 70.0%, respectively, compared to the combination of shell vial cell culture and immunofluorescent antibody test. As a result, the specificity of ProDect BCS RV CHIP is high, however, the sensitivity (25%) of the assay is not sufficient for routine laboratory use.",

            "text": "Infection of human respiratory tract with different viruses causes diseases with similar signs and symptoms. The clinical signs and symptoms of patients infected with specific respiratory viruses cannot be used to differentiate clearly one virus from another. In this respect, rapid and specific identification of the infecting virus provides many advantages to assist the clinician in making therapeutic decisions, to prevent nosocomial infections, and alert the onset of epidemics. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza virus types A and B, adenoviruses, and parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3 cause the vast majority of identified viral respiratory infections in children. These viruses are responsible for a spectrum of acute upper and lower respiratory tract disease and are the major causes of croup, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia in infants and young children. However, these viruses may cause significant morbidity and mortality in adults, especially among elderly and immunocompromised individuals. Detecting these viruses will enable to take appropriate measures for the prevention of viral diseases, avoiding unnecessary antibiotic treatment and thus allowing the proper use of antiviral drugs (Corias et al., 2004; Dowell et al., 1996; Henrickson, 2005; Syrmis et al., 2004) .",

Although these methods are valuable, they have significant limitations in terms of sensitivity and specificity. Viral cell culture is considered as the \"gold standard\" for respiratory virus detection, however, the technique is limited due to the prolonged result turnaround time, rapid loss of viability under unsuitable specimen transport and 0166-0934/$ -see front matter \u00a9 2007 Elsevier B.V.

IFAT is a more rapid but less sensitive method than viral cell culture and may be affected by specimen quality, virus type, and incorrect interpretation of results by inexperienced personnel. During the past decade, PCR techniques have improved the sensitivity and specificity for the detection of respiratory viruses. Recently, the development of multiplex PCR assays led to a decrease in expenses and short result turnaround time. In addition, molecular amplification methods do not need viable organisms in contrast to virus cell culture method that requires viable organisms. Multiplex PCR is considered as an advanced method compared to conventional PCR because it detects simultaneously more than one virus in a single reaction (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005; Corias et al., 2005; Liolios et al., 2001; Syrmis et al., 2004) .",

Even though these methods are effective and often complementary, they have some disadvantages. Cell culture techniques are considered traditionally as the \"gold standard\" during routine diagnosis of viral respi-ratory agents, however, these methods are laborious and time consuming. Although immunofluorescence antibody tests are easy to perform, antigen detection is less sensitive and specific (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005; Landry and Ferguson, 2000) . Currently, the traditional cell culture and IFAT techniques for the diagnosis and identification of viral respiratory agents are being replaced gradually by molecular techniques such as PCR to increase the diagnostic accuracy of the routine assays and decrease the turnaround time of the result (Corias et al., 2005; Henrickson, 2005; Syrmis et al., 2004) . The short result turnover time is very important during a viral outbreak or in the case of a severely infected patient for initiating antiviral therapy on time (Adcock et al., 1997; Corias et al., 2004; Woo et al., 1997) . Thus, the present study aimed to compare a multiplex reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction followed by a chip hybridization assay that has 4.5 h result turnaround time to the combination of shell vial cell culture and IFAT that have totally 5 days turnaround time for the result.",

            "text": "In the present study, the combination of shell vial cell culture and IFAT detected nine dual infections compared to ProDect BCS RV CHIP, which detected only one dual infection. In two studies published previously, a large numbers of dual infection were detected with multiplex RT-PCR compared to the traditional diagnostic assays (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005; Corias et al., 2004) . Thus, the ProDect BCS RV CHIP was considered as not suitable for detecting dual infections. However, the shell vial cell culture used in this study could not detect the RSV in the four cases that have dual infection caused by RSV and parainfluenza virus type 3 but IFAT detected the RSV in these specimens. As reported in previous studies, the reason for this discrepancy might be due to the rapid loss of the viability of RSV under unsuitable transport and/or storage conditions ( The previous studies that compare multiplex RT-PCR to traditional respiratory virus diagnostic assays such as shell vial cell culture, IFAT and/or individual RT-PCR reported often that multiplex PCR is more sensitive and specific in detecting all respiratory viruses (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005; Corias et al., 2005; Liolios et al., 2001; Syrmis et al., 2004) . In these studies, Liolios et al. (2001) used nucleocapsid and hemagglutininneuraminidase gene regions for RSV and parainfluenza virus type 3, respectively, Bellau-Pujol et al. (2005) used nucleocapsid and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene regions for RSV and parainfluenza virus type 3, respectively, Syrmis et al. (2004) used nucleocapsid, hexon protein, and L protein for parainfluenza virus type 3, adenovirus and RSV, respectively, Corias et al. (2005) used fusion protein, hexon protein, and hemagglutinin gene regions for RSV, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus type 3, respectively. However, in two other studies, Gr\u00f6ndahl et al. (1999) and Puppe et al. (2004) reported that multiplex RT-PCR was less sensitive in detecting only RSV and parainfluenza virus type 3 among all tested pathogens compared to traditional diagnostic assays. In these studies, F1 subunit of fusion glycoprotein gene, 5 non-coding region of the fusion protein, hexon gene regions were used for detecting RSV, parainfluenza virus type 3, and adenovirus, respectively (Gr\u00f6ndahl et al., 1999; Puppe et al., 2004) . Similar to these two studies, the ProDect BCS RV CHIP was also less sensitive in detecting RSV, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus type 3 compared to shell vial cell culture and IFAT. The ProDect BCS RV CHIP used non-structural gene 2, hemagglutinin, and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene regions for the detection of RSV, adenovirus, and parainfluenza virus type 3, respectively. ProDect BCS RV CHIPs gene regions for the detection of RSV and adenovirus were used for the first time in literature. Therefore, the reason for the low sensitivity obtained while detecting RSV and adenovirus by ProDect BCS RV CHIP might be due to the selection of primer gene regions different than the studies described previously that have high sensitivity for these viruses. Puppe et al. (2004) reported low sensitivity (23%) for parainfluenza virus type 3 using 5 non-coding region of the fusion protein gene region in a multiplex RT-PCR ELISA method compared to traditional diagnostic assays. The previous studies that detected parainfluenza virus type 3 with high sensitivity used mainly hemagglutinin-neuraminidase or nucleocapsid gene regions during multiplex RT-PCR (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005; Corias et al., 2005; Liolios et al., 2001; Syrmis et al., 2004) . ProDect BCS RV CHIP also used hemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene region for the detection of parainfluenza virus type 3, however, it was less sensitive compared to the combination of shell vial cell culture and IFAT. In order to investigate the technical problems such as sampling error, loss of RNA during extraction or degradation of RNA that might cause ProDect BCS RV CHIPs low sensitivity in detecting of parainfluenza virus type 3, CAPvir assay was applied to randomly selected 10 specimens which were parainfluenza virus type 3 positive with shell vial cell culture and negative with ProDect BCS RV CHIP assay. As a result, CAPVir detected all of the parainfluenza virus type 3 positive specimens that were not detected with the ProDect BCS RV CHIP, which eliminated the presence of technical problems described above. Another parameter that can cause the decrease in sensitivity might be the selection of primer gene regions different than the recommended ones. However, the CAPvir and ProDect BCS RV CHIP use the recommended nucleocapsid and hemagglutinin-neuraminidase gene regions, respectively, for the detection of parainfluenza virus type 3. Another parameter that is important during the application of multiplex RT-PCR is the large number of primer sets combined in a single reaction that can hamper the sensitivity of the assay (Syrmis et al., 2004) . Interestingly, the studies that reported high sensitivity in detecting respiratory viruses by the multiplex RT-PCR and the ProDect BCS RV CHIP used a high number of primer sets combined in a single reaction except the multiplex RT-PCR developed and CAPvir which used low number of primer in three sets of primer mixes (both methods mixed primers of parainfluenza virus types in a tube) that contain low number of prime sets (Bellau-Pujol et al., 2005; Corias et al., 2005; Liolios et al., 2001; Syrmis et al., 2004) . Inadequate optimization of large number of primer sets in a single reaction might be causing the low sensitivity of the ProDect BCS RV CHIP in detecting parainfluenza virus type 3. Although the ProDect BCS RV CHIP has decreased sensitivity during routine laboratory use as described above, it has high PPV and specificity because of the absence of cross-reactions with other viruses and false positive results.",
