HBoV is suspected to be an etiologic agent of respiratory disease in humans (Manning et al., 2006; Maggi et al., 2007; Kesebir et al., 2007) . Respiratory distress and abnormal radiographic chest findings have frequently been associated with HBoV. However, its causative role is still unclear.

However, the frequent association of HBoV infection with respiratory tract disease (Anderson, 2007; Schenk et al., 2007; Simon et al., 2007) led us to consider this virus as a causative agent for respiratory tract diseases. Some studies have shown that HBoV is distributed all over the world (Manning et al., 2006; Maggi et al., 2007; Simon et al., 2007; Ma et al., 2006; Bastien et al., 2007) and recent data have shown that it can also be detected in stool samples from children with gastroenteritis (Vicente et al., 2007) .

Laboratory tests showed a leukocyte count of 22.0 \u00d7 10 9 l \u22121 , and C-reactive protein and erythrocyte sedimentation rate were normal. Chest radiography, interpreted by a paediatric radiologist, revealed hyperinflation and pneumonic infiltrates of the upper left lobe.
