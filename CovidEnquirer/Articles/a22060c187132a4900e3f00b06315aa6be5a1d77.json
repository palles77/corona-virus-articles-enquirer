The VEEV genome codes for 4 non-structural proteins (nsP), of which nsP3 contains a Macro domain. Macro domains (MD) can be found as stand-alone proteins or embedded within larger proteins in viruses, bacteria and eukaryotes. Their most common feature is the binding of ADP-ribose (ADPr), while several macro domains act as ribosylation writers, erasers or readers. Alphavirus MD erase ribosylation but their precise contribution in viral replication is still under investigation. NMR-driven titration experiments of ADPr in solution with the VEEV macro domain (in apo-and complex state) show that it adopts a suitable conformation for ADPr binding. Specific experiments indicate that the flexibility of the loops \u03b25-\u03b13 and \u03b13-\u03b26 is critical for formation of the complex and assists a wrapping mechanism for ADPr binding. Furthermore, along with this sequence of events, the VEEV MD undergoes a conformational exchange process between the apo state and a low-populated \"dark\" conformational state.",

            "text": "Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (VEEV) has been recognized as a human pathogen since 1943 and causes flu-like symptoms and several central nervous system disorders like encephalitis and meningitis. VEEV is a new world alphavirus, i.e., specific to the Americas. It follows an enzootic life cycle between mosquito Culex sp. and wild rodents, and an epizootic cycle amongst humans and equines with mosquitos Aedes sp. and Psorophora sp. as epizootic vectors (Morrison et al., 2008) . The virus is distributed over the Americas with main outbreaks located in Central and South America. Outbreaks of VEEV can lead to fatal cases in equines and VEEV is also considered as a high-risk pathogen for humans as well. Such outbreaks in Venezuela and Colombia in 1995, involving an estimated 100,000 human cases, indicate that VEEV poses a serious public health problem. It is worth mentioning that since 1995 there has not been any outbreak of the virus (Guill\u00e9n et al., 2015; Morrison et al., 2008) , however epidemics indicate that VEEV still represents a serious public health concern (Aguilar et al., 2011) . So far, no efficient vaccines or drugs are licensed for the treatment of alphavirus infection (Chattopadhyay et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "The 12 kb single-stranded positive sense RNA genome of the virus includes two large open reading frames (ORF). The first ORF encodes the four non-structural proteins (nsPs), which are necessary for virus replication, while the second is translated into the structural proteins: capsid, E1, E2 and E3 glycoproteins and 6K. In particular, nsP1 possesses guanine-7-methyltransferase and guanylyltransferase activity being responsible for the addition of a 5\u2032 cap to viral RNA (Rupp et al., 2015) , while nsP2 is a multifunctional protein consisting of 3 domains. The N-terminal domain acts as a helicase while it also exhibits nucleoside triphosphatase activity (NTPase). The C-terminus of nsP2 contains a protease domain and a non-functional methyltransferase-like domain. nsP3 is comprised of three domains: the conserved N-terminal domain, which is called macro domain (also known as \"X domain\"), a central alphavirus unique domain (AUD) and a hypervariable, phosphorylated C-terminus. Originally, an ADPr-1\u2033-phosphatase was associated to the macro domain, as well as nucleic acid binding but recent studies showed its implication in de-ribosylation of proteins. The highly conserved AUD is characterized by a zinc-binding motif. Both length and sequence composition of the C-terminal domain are hypervariable among alphaviruses (Abu Bakar and Ng, 2018; Rupp et al., 2015) . Last, nsP4 is the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (Shin et al., 2012; Strauss and Strauss, 1994) .",

            "text": "Macro domains are highly conserved proteins throughout evolution. They consist of 130-190 amino acids. They are named after the nonhistone motif of the core histone variant macroH2A, in which they were initially characterized (Chakravarthy et al., 2005) . High affinity binding to ADP-ribose (ADPr) is their most common feature and macro domains can be organized into three classes: ADP-ribosylation readers, erasers and writers. Many cellular processes are dependent on protein ADP-ribosylation which is a highly dynamic post-translational modification involved in DNA repair, apoptosis, protein degradation and chromatin remodeling (Fehr et al., 2017; Jankevicius et al., 2013) . However, the biological role of the viral macro domains is still poorly understood. Several recent studies have demonstrated that they exhibit de-ADP-ribosylating activity (eraser) together with their ability to bind ADP-ribose (Fehr et al., 2017) . Therefore, it was proposed that they participate in reversing the antiviral ADP-ribosylation of the host cells (Fehr et al., 2017; Li et al., 2016) . Mutations of viral macro domains at residues critical for ADPr binding have been shown to lead to lower affinity towards ADPr resulting in disruption of loss of virulence and/or viral replication (Fehr et al., 2016; McPherson et al., 2017) . Therefore, macro domains could serve as novel therapeutic targets for the design of antiviral agents in order to control Alphavirus, Hepevirus and Coronavirus-induced diseases. The crystal structure of the VEEV macro domain has shown that the protein forms a six-stranded \u03b2-sheet surrounded by 4 \u03b1-helices (Malet et al., 2009) . The order of the \u03b2-strands within the \u03b2-sheet is \u03b21, \u03b26, \u03b25, \u03b22, \u03b24, \u03b23, all positioned in parallel except for \u03b23. The N-terminus forms the \u03b21-strand while the C-terminus forms the last \u03b1-helix (\u03b14), which is located close to the N-terminus. This structural motif is quite conserved among the macro domains of different organisms (Cho et al., 2016; Malet et al., 2009; Peterson et al., 2011) . The same study revealed the structural basis of the binding affinity of ADPr to the macro domain. The binding site of ADPr is located at the top of the \u03b22, \u03b24 and \u03b25 strands surrounded by the loops connecting \u03b22 to \u03b11 and \u03b25 to \u03b13 defining a conserved binding pocket (Malet et al., 2009) .",

Proton chemical shifts were referenced to internal 4,4-dimethyl-4-silapentane-1-sulfonic acid (DSS). Sequence specific resonance assignments of the VEEV macro domain were obtained as reported previously (BMRB ID 25132) (Makrynitsa et al., 2015) . For the structure determination of the complex the same set of NMR experiments (Makrynitsa et al., 2015) was used and the 1 H, 15 N and 13 C resonance assignments were deposited in the BioMagResBank under the accession number 26753. However, in order to define the 3D structure of the VEEV macro domain-ADPr complex, a sufficient number of intermolecular distance restraints had to be obtained through 2D 13 Cfiltered/edited NOE experiments (Peterson et al., 2004) . NOE-derived distance constraints for the VEEV macro domain were obtained by the analysis of a 3D 15 N-NOESY and two 3D 13C-NOESY spectra, which were recorded with the proton carrier frequency in the aliphatic and the aromatic region, respectively. DYANA's routine CALIBA was used to generate distance restraints from the volume of each NOESY cross peak. Dihedral angles derived from TALOS+ (Makrynitsa et al., 2015; Shen et al., 2009) were incorporated in the structure calculations as well. The calculations were conducted with DYANA (G\u00fcntert et al., 1997) and the 20 conformers with the lowest target function values were subjected to energy minimization with AMBER (Case et al., 2005) . The solution structure of the apoprotein was determined from 1648 unique, meaningful NOE constraints derived from a total number of 1486 NOEs from the 15 N-NOESY and 1043 NOEs from the 13 C-NOESY spectra (SI, Table S1 ). The coordinates of the 21 energy-refined conformers (including the average model) were deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 5ISN). For the solution structure of the biomolecular complex, the same procedure and software were used and it was defined by 1988 unique, meaningful NOE constraints: 1361 from the 15 N-NOESY, 1991 from the 13 C-NOESY spectra and 18 intermolecular NOE correlations from the 13 C-filtered/ edited NOESY. The coordinates of the 21 energy-refined models (20 DYANA models and the mean model) were deposited in the RCSB Protein Data Bank (PDB ID: 5MQX) as well.",

The \u03b2sheet topology is \u03b21\u03b26\u03b25\u03b22\u03b24\u03b23 with the \u03b23 strand being antiparallel to its neighbors (Fig. 1A) . The NMR structure of the VEEV macro domain in apo form superimposes well with the corresponding X-ray structure (Malet et al., 2009 ) with a rmsd of 2.1 \u00c5 for the backbone atoms (Fig. 1B) . Although the two structures are very similar regarding the secondary structure elements and topology, loops Q28-A36, G116-R120 and the loop connecting the \u03b26 strand with the \u03b14 helix exhibit different conformations due to the lack of NOEs and unassigned residues in these regions (Makrynitsa et al., 2015) . Taking into consideration that the NMR structure is of high resolution (target function: 1.49 \u00c5, rmsd: 1.07 \u00c5), the high value of the rmsd is the result of the behavior of the aforementioned loops. Amino acids without detectable spin patterns in the NMR spectra are located around the highly positively charged surface area, which defines the ADPr binding site (Malet et al., 2009) . Similar behavior has been observed in the NMR study of the human orphan macro domain C6orf130 in which the amino acids of corresponding loops around the ADPr binding pocket were also missing in the NMR spectra (Peterson et al., 2011) .",

To further investigate the binding of ADPr, we titrated 15 N-labeled VEEV macro domain incrementally with ADPr and monitored backbone amide chemical shift changes in the 1 H-15 N HSQC spectra. During the titration experiments, 21 residues exhibited chemical shift perturbations (CSPs) above the threshold (calculated according to the standard deviation of all CSP values as determined by the equation Garrett et al., 1997) ) with the majority of these residues located around the binding groove ( Fig. 2A, B) . Interestingly, 1 H-15 N HSQC spectra of the complex did not display any further changes regarding the chemical shifts of the perturbed amino acids after a 1:1 protein-ligand ratio had been reached. This strongly indicates that the VEEV macro domain binds specifically one ADPr molecule in its well-defined binding cleft. Cross peaks of residues affected by ADPr gradually vanished during the titration experiments and simultaneously appeared in a new region of the HSQC spectrum (Fig. 2C ). This behavior is characteristic of a slow exchange process and is indicative for high affinity ligand binding (Kd of 3.9 \u00b1 0.65 \u00b5M as measured by isothermal titration calorimetry (Malet et al., 2009) ).",

In particular, the adenine moiety is accommodated in a hydrophobic cavity (P1 pocket) and shows NOE contacts with I11, V33, Y142, and R144. Concerning the proximal ribose (the adenosine ribose), we identified NOE contacts with V33, L108, T111, and R144 (P2 pocket), while the distal ribose of ADPr is hydrogen bonded with the backbone NH of G32 and shows NOEs with A22 and I113, fitting into a pocket (P3 pocket) comprising the N-terminal part of the \u03b11 helix and the loop preceding the \u03b13 helix (residues L108-R120). The phosphate binding site is stabilized through hydrogen bonds with the main chain NH groups of V33 and I113. Analysis of the VEEV/ADPr complex by molecular dynamics also revealed that the above residues participate strongly in the ADPr binding with the distal ribose playing a key role in the complex formation (Rungrotmongkol et al., 2010) . Due to exchange with the bulk solvent the assignment of the ADPr OH groups was not feasible. The residues that map the binding sites for each ADPr moiety are not random. A sequence alignment of macro domains from different organisms reveals the high degree of conservation for the amino acids residing in the binding pocket (Fehr et al., 2017; McPherson et al., 2017) (SI, Fig. S2 ).",

Comparison of the structures in the free and complex state revealed conformational differences in loop S25-G31 and the C-terminal helix \u03b14 although ADPr binding to the VEEV macro domain does not dramatically alter the overall structure of the protein (Fig. 2E) . Likewise, the solution structure of the VEEV macro domain-ADPr complex is very similar to the corresponding crystal structure except for the aforementioned regions that exhibit conformational differences (Malet et al., 2009) (Fig. 2F ). These differences are coupled with the binding of the ADPr molecule to the macro domain cavity. The loops comprising S25-G31 and L109-R120 undergo conformational changes resulting in a slight widening of the crevice where the distal ribose is located. Helices \u03b11 and \u03b14 helices seem to exhibit a displacement towards the binding pocket as well, but in this case the conformational changes cause a closure of the pocket around the ligand (Fig. 3A, B) .",

The most pronounced topological differences observed between the two NMR resolved states of the domain are in the two loops L108-R120 and Q28-A36 and in helices \u03b11, \u03b12, and \u03b14 (Fig. 5A) , which relates well to the experimental CPMG data (Fig. 4) . Using NMA to address these conformational changes, the structure converged smoothly to the target ADPr-bound conformation with final heavy atom RMSD of 0.55 \u00c5 (initial RMSD: 1.8 \u00c5), indicating a pathway of backbone and side chain transitions to reshape the binding cavity of the domain and accommodate the ligand. Specifically, the Q28-A36 loop undergoes a significant translational movement of \u223c3 \u00c5 with respect to the L108-R120 loop, increasing the distance between the C\u03b1 atoms of G31 and I113 from \u223c7 to \u223c10 \u00c5 in order to admit the distal ribose of ADPr (Fig. 5B) . Consequently, F114 also moves to interact with the same ribose. Mutational insertions in the Q28-A36 loop can conditionally alter virus replication and, at the protein scale, destabilize the macro domain and partly affect its ADPr binding property (Beitzel et al., 2010; Guill\u00e9n et al., 2015) , highlighting the role this loop in the transition mechanism required for the accommodation of ADPr.",

The ligand does not simply bind to a well-defined, highly conserved binding pocket of the protein, but several regions of the protein contribute to the formation of the biomolecular complex. A number of residues undergo both backbone and side-chain conformational changes to adopt a suitable geometry that allows ADPr to enter the cavity and bind strongly to the protein.",

V33, as part of the moving helix \u03b11, plays a crucial role in binding, positioning itself to a \u03c3-\u03c0 interacting arrangement with the aromatic group of adenine. The charged residues R144 and D10 also undergo certain rearrangements, the first to widen the binding pocket and the second to form a crucial hydrogen bond with the adenine amine. R144 in particular showed minor but significant conformational exchange as determined by the CPMG experiment (Fig. 4, SI, Fig. S4 ). The conformational changes not only contribute to the ADPr binding but also to the efficient de-ribosylation activity by properly positioning the reactive molecule, likely a water molecule, close to the substrate. Indeed, it was evidenced that a mutation in the corresponding Q28-A36 loop of Hepatitis E virus macro domain or O. iheyensis macro domains greatly impaired the catalysis without affecting significantly the substrate recognition (Li et al., 2016; Zapata-P\u00e9rez et al., 2017) . These conformational changes along the transition path thus provide a framework to understand the dynamic nature of the macro domains and to dissect the events during ADPr binding and de-ribosylation.",

The sensitivity of loop \u03b25-\u03b13 to ADPr binding in combination with the mobility of loop \u03b13-\u03b26 indicates that they serve as gates of the binding cleft and assist the ADPr entrance.

A comparison of the structures of the VEEV macro domain in the apo and ADPr bound state reveals that flexibility of the loop \u03b25-\u03b13 is crucial for the key conformational changes around the active site favoring ADPr binding. The high exchange rates of loops \u03b25-\u03b13 and \u03b13-\u03b26 contribute to the flexibility of these segments, which may serve as micro-switches that allow ADPr to enter the ligand-binding cleft. The correlation of chemical shifts of the excited apo to the bound ground state suggests that ADPr binding occurs through a conformational selection mechanism. It is well established that polypeptide segments with high adaptability play a key role in partner or ligand identification, selectivity and binding (Peterson et al., 2011; Zapata-P\u00e9rez et al., 2017) . This may also be the function of these regions in many macro domains, including the one from VEEV. It is worth mentioning, that so far most of the studies concerning the structure of macro domains have focused on the characterization of the ADPr binding pocket before and after binding of the ligand (Egloff et al., 2006) . In the present study, for the first time, it is demonstrated by experimental data that an exchange process between two states of certain loop regions in the apo form of the macro domain is crucial for ADPr binding.",
