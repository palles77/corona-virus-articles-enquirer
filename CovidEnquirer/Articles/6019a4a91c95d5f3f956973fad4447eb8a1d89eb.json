Using sophisticated large-scale automation, it was anticipated that this would generate an unprecedented number of novel leads, resulting in a substantial increase in novel drug entities launched to the market per year. However, in reality, the opposite was the case [1, 2] . Frequently, the discovered hits could not be validated and further optimized into actual leads and preclinical candidates. Thus, the initial euphoria surrounding these approaches has subsided owing to the disappointingly low hit rates and significant costs involved [3, 4] .",

            "text": "Such situations fuel the consideration and development of alternative techniques. The expression 'virtual screening' (VS) was coined in the late 1990s; however, the techniques involved are much older. In an effort to show that searching for lead candidates using a computer is a serious alternative to HTS, the term 'VS' was adopted by the community. In contrast to HTS, which is largely phenomenological and technology driven, in VS, compounds are selected by predicting their binding to a macromolecular target using computer programs (in drug discovery, the term 'target' or 'receptor' is used frequently to describe the macromolecule to which a drug binds, which is usually a protein but can also be DNA or RNA). The compounds studied do not necessarily exist, and their 'testing' does not consume valuable substance material. Experimental deficiencies, such as limited solubility, aggregate formation or any sort of influence that could possibly interfere with experimentally applied assay conditions do not need to be considered in the initial computational screen. In contrast to HTS, VS requires as a key prerequisite knowledge about the spatial and energetic criteria responsible for the binding of a particular candidate ligand to the receptor under investigation. In consequence, either the three-dimensional (3D) structure of the macromolecular target -as given by crystal structure analyses, NMR or sophisticated homology modelling -or, at the very least, a rigid reference ligand with a known bioactive conformation mapping out the putative receptor binding site must be available [5] . This defines VS as a knowledgedriven approach. Even though it is likely that multiple screening campaigns have been performed in parallel in industry [6] [7] [8] [9] , it was only recently that McMaster University launched an open and unbiased competitive screening against Escherichia coli dihydrofolate reductase to detect inhibitors [10] , to assess how well VS can enrich candidate ligands compared with HTS random screening [10, 11] . The original sample set of compounds used for screening was split into two, and one fraction was tested by HTS. Obtained hits were reported and served as a training set to validate and tailor applied VS tools in different research groups, who entered into a competition to retrieve hits also detected by the experimental screen in the second portion of the screening sample [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] . Subsequently, in a totally unbiased fashion, the second part of the data sample was evaluated by HTS and VS in parallel. Unexpectedly, the second portion did not show any hits as competitive inhibitors, as would be expected for ligands docked into the substrate binding site of a target protein. Interestingly, Brenk et al. [16] reported on some promising hits found by docking that were not detected as inhibitors in the initial HTS. Retesting at higher concentration indicated weak inhibition. This observation could be seen as supporting the view that VS and HTS are complementary approaches and that they might find candidates missed by the other [7, 9] .",

            "text": "As mentioned above, the methods involved in VS are much older than the approach itself. Initial attempts to find ligands by docking or by mapping them onto ligand-based pharmacophore models were the generic prototypes of a VS approach. However, this term was not used at that time, probably because computers and algorithms were not fast enough to enable large scale applications. Focusing on approaches that actually make use of an available protein structure, one of the first systems to be studied by docking was HIV protease. Initial versions of the program DOCK, developed over many years by Kuntz's group [17, 18] , tried to dock rigid entries from the Cambridge Crystallographic Database into the protein receptor, focusing primarily on shape complementarity and later considering chemical complementarity. In 1990, the Kuntz group retrieved the neuroleptic drug haloperidol as a potential 'lead' from a docking screen using a database of known drug molecules as input. However, this compound would have had to be administered at a very high dose -far beyond a toxicologically tolerable concentration -to be an effective inhibitor of the protease [19] . Nevertheless, haloperidol as a 'lead' gave rise to some new ideas for developing a derivative possessing 15 mM inhibition of HIV protease [20] . Later, at Dupont-Merck, a 3D database search retrieved a substituted terphenyl derivative as a putative lead for inhibiting this protease. Further optimization via six-and sevenmembered rings resulted in the class of cyclic ureas that are able to replace the crucial structural water molecule in the protease, at the same time targeting the carboxy groups of the two catalytic aspartates via two appropriately placed hydroxy functionalities [21] . Since these early VS attempts, a plethora of case studies has been performed and the list of success stories is steadily growing. Despite the fact that VS is still a young discipline, it has been reviewed frequently [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] , most recently in a comprehensive overview by Kubinyi [31] . If one excludes purely retrospective studies, in which the potential of a method is demonstrated by its ability to enrich putatively active molecules from a sample of anticipated nonactive ones, 50 targets have been studied to date, and reports on the discovery of mostly micromolar binding ligands in a truly predictive fashion are available (Table 1) . Still under development, and far from mature, the number of strategies followed in VS is nearly as large as the number of reported screen- ing campaigns. Owing to space constraints, this review is unable to give a comprehensive overview of success stories or investigated targets, or to review all details of currently applied VS protocols; accordingly, the reader is recommended to consult the abovementioned surveys [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] . Instead, this review attempts to summarize and comment on the agreed concepts and prerequisites for performing successful VS runs. Furthermore, it attempts to analyse the limitations of the approach in a frank and plain manner and seeks to explain why such limitations still exist. Accordingly, in the following sections, first the target selection, analysis and preparation are discussed, followed by considerations about the compilation of a candidate ligand screening sample. This is followed by a discussion of the actual requirements, tools and strategies of a VS campaign, and, finally, remarks concerning the accuracy of the scoring and ranking of the screening results.",

Clearly, the availability of the target receptor is of great benefit compared with situations where only a rigid reference ligand is known. The target receptor could be any macromolecular biomolecule, either a protein, RNA or DNA. In terms of the rigid reference ligand, either a substrate, inhibitor molecule, agonist or antagonist (e.g. a steroid hormone) could serve. Because the structures of target receptors are becoming increasingly available, this review concentrates solely on such situations. However, it does not mean that VS cannot be applied to situations in which no structural information about the target receptor is available [5] . With respect to DNA and RNA as target receptors, the development of appropriate docking and scoring tools has been initiated only recently, and, accordingly, VS applications on such targets are still rare [32, 33] . By contrast, the scope of applications addressing proteins ranges from enzymes to Gprotein-coupled receptors and ion channels (Table 1) .",

            "text": "The first issue to be considered is the druggability of the selected target. Does the selected protein exhibit a binding pocket that can be successfully targeted by small molecule ligands? Clearly, characteristics such as pocket size and geometry, surface complexity and roughness, exposure of recognition properties and their complementarity in shape and polarity with respect to a putative druglike ligand, are of importance. Because such criteria are not immediately available, a pragmatic, but hardly generally applicable, approach would be to correlate gene families. If one member of such a family is able to bind a drug, other members might also be able to bind druglike ligands with related physicochemical properties [34] . This assumption is based simply on the fact that members of a gene family usually operate on related substrates or recognize similar endogenous ligands. However, the setup for a VS study requires more conclusive information about the actual bindingsite architecture. Recently, Hajduk et al. [35] suggested several very decisive indices that help to discriminate druggable from nondruggable binding pockets. For druggability, the total surface area and a portion of a polar contact area below 75 \u00c5 2 appear to be beneficial, along with an appropriate pocket compactness, surface roughness and complexity. This suggests that there is an optimal size and composition of a protein-binding pocket that is best suited to recognize and accommodate small organic ligands. However, the analysis by Hajduk et al. also showed that no single index consistently dominates the correlation. This fact points to the complexity of the interrelationships among the various discriminatory indices and explains why, at present, our concepts for predicting druggability are still rudimentary.",

The most powerful method for learning about the spatial structure of proteins is crystal structure analysis. The accuracy and reliability of this method strongly depends on the resolution of the diffraction data. An alternative experimental technique to determine protein structures is NMR; there the accuracy of the structural determination depends strongly on the local distribution of the Nuclear Overhauser Effect distance information along the protein chain (this effect involves transfer of magnetization through space and gives information about distances between nuclei in a 3D structure). Furthermore, in the past, significant methodological enhancements in homology modelling have improved the quality of protein models [36] [37] [38] ; accordingly, several successful VS screening campaigns have been reported based on model-built protein structures [39] [40] [41] . Homology modelling strongly depends on the availability of related proteins for which a crystal structure has been determined. The model will be particularly precise in those areas where the homology with the experimentally determined references is high, which is usually the case in the conserved core regions. However, functional binding sites, to be addressed by VS, are generally located in loop regions where, even among homologues of a gene family, significant differences are experienced (apart from catalytic residues in enzymes that are spatially highly conserved). To enhance the accuracy of model-built structures in regions where the binding sites are found, new algorithms have been suggested that consider the putative binding orientation of known ligands during the homology modelling process. These algorithms feed the information about the binding properties of possibly bound ligands back into the homology building process. Improved binding site geometries can be expected from such approaches [42, 43] .",

With respect to the target protein, several methods have been described to simulate flexibility [44] . For VS, it is important to obtain an estimate of the protein conformers competent at accommodating a ligand. Once these conformers have been determined, a VS run can either be performed by considering the flexibility of the protein instantly during the calculation, or by addressing an ensemble of several rigid receptor conformations [45] [46] [47] [48] . Ligand-binding competent conformers can either be sampled by exhaustive conformational searches (e.g. using molecular dynamics simulations [49, 50] ) or by examining multiple conformational states, observed in crystal structures with different ligands bound, to obtain insight into the relevant conformations [51, 52] . The latter approach appears tempting because it can be assumed that a sample of experimentally observed protein conformers corresponds to stable, low freeenergy states.",

            "text": "Even though the crystal structure is usually considered as the 'gold standard' for learning about the geometry of a protein, it is highly questionable how representative a single structure determination really is. McGovern and Shoichet [53] reported on increasing information decay, irrespective of whether the geometry of a ligand-bound or ligand-free crystal structure was used or a model-built structure was considered. Principally, crystalline protein-ligand complexes can be prepared by exposing preformed crystals of a protein to the solution of a ligand, which can then diffuse into the crystals and find its way to the binding site. This process is called 'soaking'. Alternatively, in a cocrystallization experiment, the protein-ligand complex is formed by equilibrating them in solution, and then the assembled complex is crystallized. We recently observed, depending on the soaking protocol applied, different conformational states of the protein aldose reductase complexed by the inhibitor zopolrestat [54] . In one structure, the protein forms a hydrogen bond with the ligand via one of its binding site-exposed amide bonds ( Figure 1 ). In a second structure, the amide bond is rotated off from the binding site, and the same ligand can no longer form this hydrogen bond. Such differences have a significant impact on docking and scoring results in VS. Depending on the crystallization conditions, ligands have been observed to accommodate a binding pocket with reversed orientation [55] ; in other cases, ligand-induced conformational adaptations of the protein are observed [56] ( Figure 2 ). Increasing the concentration of a ligand in the soaking buffer will enhance the opportunity to accommodate it in the binding pocket. However, it is likely that soaking depicts some kind of kinetic trap for ligands; consequently, surprising differences in cocrystallization have been observed (several ligands bound at one time, multiple binding modes [57] ). Before selecting a particular crystal structure as a reference for a VS run, detailed analysis of parameters such as population of the bound ligand, B-factors next to the binding site (B-factors indicate thermal motion in a crystal structure; however, they are highly correlated with the population of a ligand in the crystal) or consistency of the hydrogen bond network is advisable.",

These changes are of significance during various validation steps of a VS run. We have recently observed that even the protonation states of the residues in the binding pocket of inhibitor-bound aldose reductase can change depending on whether the cofactor NADPH/NADP + is present in the oxidized or reduced state ( Figure 3 ) (O.

Different strategies with respect to docking and scoring will be the consequence (see below). Experience shows that conformational adaptations observed in a protein-binding pocket are usually related to the structural modulations potentially needed by the protein to accomplish its functional role [51] . Such functional adaptations must correspond to low-energy transformations, otherwise dramatic shortcomings in the functional performance of the protein would be the consequence. Accordingly, enzymes that operate on a large palette of structurally diverse substrates (cf. aldose reductase and short chain dehydrogenases) or perform substantial conformational adaptations during catalysis (cf. kinases) will experience multiple bindingcompetent states that have to be considered in VS. Thus, a profound understanding of the functional properties of a protein might be the best option for predicting the conformational adaptability of a protein. Such information is not usually available at the beginning of a drug development project, when VS is used. Because proteins occur in gene families of closely related members, the analysis across different entries of the family might provide some insight into the flexibility properties inherently shared by the members of the family. However, it might also be that some family members display rigid solutions, as required by their function (e.g. trypsin and factor Xa among the serine proteases), whereas others possess pronounced flexible behaviour, as appropriate to their function (e.g. the serine protease factor VIIa) [60] . Protonation states can change upon ligand binding. Depending on the oxidation state of the bound cofactor NADPH (left) and NADP + (right), aldose reductase binds to a carboxylate-type inhibitor (e.g. IDD594) by placing its acid functional group (red) into the catalytic centre; the complex thereby formed remains either in an unchanged protonation state (left) or picks up protons upon binding (right). In the centre, the crystal structure of the complex is shown. A short contact distance between the carboxylate function of the inhibitor (shown with a yellow surface) and the nicotinamide portion of the cofactor (shown with an atom-type coloured surface, where oxygen is red, nitrogen is blue, carbon is white, sulfur is yellow and phosphorous is orange) is formed. High resolution X-ray crystal structure analysis and neutron diffraction has provided evidence that the inhibitor binds with its carboxylate function in the deprotonated state, and the active site His is present in the neutral state. It remains unresolved where the proton goes in the case of the NADP + -bound complex, or whether the residues of the catalytic centre exhibit deviating protonation states in the uncomplexed and inhibited situation. With respect to VS, a unique and precise assignment of the protonation states of the ligand and protein functional groups in a pK a range between 3 and 11 is essential because, for example, for docking it is important whether such a group is considered as donor or acceptor of a hydrogen bond (Kr\u00e4mer and Klebe, unpublished).",

Several tools have been described to elucidate the 'hot spots' of binding in a particular binding pocket [61] . These methods are either based on thoroughly parameterized force fields [62] or on well-selected empirical information (SuperStar [63] , DrugScore [64] ; Figure 4 ).

Thus, any approach based on the prediction of binding modes of putative candidate ligands, as required in VS, must take water into consideration. One possible approach for learning about water molecules tightly bound to the protein is the analysis of crystallographic data with respect to the repeated occurrence of water molecules in structurally related binding sites (e.g. in a gene family) or multiple structural determinations of the same protein with many distinct ligands [66] . If water is present in all structures analysed at more or less the same location, this is a strong indica-tion that this water molecule is tightly bound, and in a VS run could be considered as an integral part of the target structure.",

In the past, combinatorial chemistry in particular has enabled pharmaceutical companies to develop screening libraries of several million candidate molecules; thus, in principle, the sheer number of test compounds is no longer an issue. Although large in total count, the individual members of such libraries are usually large in terms of size and molecular weight. They are mostly in the range of typical drug-size molecules, having been synthesized in other drug development projects. However, if they turn out to be a micromolar screening hit, they still require optimization to improve their affinity towards the target protein by two or three orders of magnitude. This has to be accomplished while maintaining reasonable molecular size and appropriate absorption, distribution, metabolism and excretion properties. In consequence, it involves stripping down to a scarcely decorated core skeleton while subsequently building up this core again with novel well-tailored side chains. This is a challenging task, and is often difficult to achieve. Experience from drug optimization programs has shown that small core fragments ('privileged templates' or 'fragments') known to bind with significant affinity are ideal starting points for further optimization [69, 70] . Accordingly, the compounds selected for VS should leave some room for optimization, thus matching the range of socalled leadlike or fragment-like molecules [71] .",

Such considerations are important for the development of new methods; however, in an actual drug development project, at the end of the day, the medicinal chemist will ask for novel leads that are worthwhile pursuing with synthesis and optimization. Impressive enrichment rates of known actives will not be convincing.",

Some general criteria have to be matched either by inhouse proprietary compounds or by substances offered by commercial suppliers. Compounds can be validated with respect to drug likeness considering Lipinski's rule of five, or lead likeness applying more stringent criteria (as defined by the rule of three) [73] [74] [75] . Recently, Martin tested Lipinski's frequently applied rule with respect to experimentally determined bioavailability in the rat [76] . This study showed that the rule of five has predictive ability for neutral and positively charged molecules; however, anions obey different rules, and the size of their polar surface area confers some predictive power. Similarly to the considerations concerning the druggability of binding sites, the criteria for bioavailability are multifactorial. Irwin and Shoichet took the initiative to set up the freely available database ZINC with validated compounds for VS [67] . It is built from 2D compound information, generates 3D coordinates and curates, if possible, from stereo-and regioisomeric ambiguities. Multiple states with respect to protonation, charges and tautomers are enumerated. However, as described for proteins, the properties of compounds might be altered upon protein binding. Insoluble, reactive and aggregating compounds are not represented in the database. The rule of five is a straightforward filter to discard compounds with putatively undesired properties from the screening sample. Depending on the strategy pursued in the subsequent VS campaign, multiple conformers can be precalculated and stored as separate entries in the database.",

Reymond's group attempted to generate a database of all possible organic molecules up to 160 Da under the constraints of defined chemical stability and synthetic feasibility [78] . This database contains 13.9 million entries. It is possible that such a sample could be used for fragment screening. For larger compounds, exhaustive sampling of possible molecular skeletons will end up in a combinatorial explosion with too many possible solutions. However, proper design criteria, defined by the architecture of the binding site used in VS as the target, might guide the generation of target-tailored virtual libraries for VS. In particular, considering the criteria of combinatorial chemistry and parallel synthesis, such VS strategies can actually help to synthesize only the most promising entries of a large virtual combinatorial library.",

In forward filtering, various criteria are used to reduce the initial data sample, which might comprise several millions of test compounds, to the several hundred or thousand most promising candidates to be docked [87] .

However, with a decreasing number of compounds, the filtering becomes computationally increasingly demanding and sophisticated. Flexible docking is the computationally most intensive step of all; thus, the fewer candidates to be considered here, the more effort can be spent in controlling, validating and assessing docking results. This is clearly an advantage of this strategy. Forward filtering eliminates compounds initially according to simple descriptors such as molecular weight, number of rotatable bonds, lipophilicity (usually expressed by the logarithm of the partition coefficient, log P) or crude shape descriptors, such as the ellipticity of the overall structure. Subsequently, information about the receptor's binding site is exploited. Once a hotspot analysis of the most likely anchoring positions in the binding pocket has been performed, a protein-based pharmacophore can be derived [88] . This pharmacophore sets the constraints for the minimal requirement of functional groups to be matched by putative ligands (e.g. number of hydrogen bond donors, acceptors or hydrophobic groups). Molecules satisfying such criteria can be retrieved by any database engine capable of a functional group substructure search. Once the topographical arrangement of the protein-based pharmacophore has been incorporated into the search and the remaining candidates are requested to match this pattern, the study can be further focused. UNITY (UNITY Chemical Information Software, version 4.1, Tripos) and CATALYST [89] are prototypes of such database engines supporting this screening step. An alternative tool is FeatureTrees, which can retrieve molecules of similar topology in feature space [90] . In this context, 'features' are considered as being similar types of functional groups or molecular building blocks. Similarity can be considered as a further filter criterion in VS. For example, if candidate molecules are requested to match with a predefined protein-based pharmacophore, this condition already involves a selection in terms of similarity criteria; however, they are regarded very generally. Furthermore, information about known binders can be used for filtering, although the danger then exists that, owing to biased filters and preconceived concepts, some unexpected and novel chemistry is discarded during the early filtering steps. Finally, docking is pursued, usually considering only 1-10% of the initial sample collection. An advantage of the forward filtering approach is that it enables more elaborate docking protocols to be performed -for example, taking multiple protein conformational states into account or reflecting a protein-based pharmacophore as a restraint in docking. Most importantly, this hierarchical filtering strategy enables the tracking of the performance at the various filter levels by human intervention, and, in particular, visual inspection of docking solutions remains feasible.",

This approach is especially challenging because docking returns multiple solutions for most candidate molecules. Strongly discriminative and reliable scoring functions must be available for analysing the computed results in an automated fashion because visual inspection for the large number of diverse compounds to be examined is hardly feasible. However, it is questionable whether the existing scoring functions are reliable enough to succeed with such heroic demands (see below). Nevertheless, to proceed with the multiple docking solutions from a high-throughput run, the generated docking modes can be filtered with respect to achieved matching of the protein-based pharmacophore, contact complementarity of protein and ligand surfaces or the remaining residual unoccupied voids along the protein-ligand interface. Because nature probably avoids gaps in molecular assemblies, the latter criterion could be a powerful indicator for irrelevant binding modes or the putative accommodation of interstitial water molecules.",

            "text": "Docking is the crucial step in VS. The seminal program DOCK, originally described in 1982 by Kuntz et al. [17] , has evolved as the first VS tool. Later, other programs were successfully applied in VS, such as GOLD [91] , FlexX [92] , Glide [93, 94] or Autodock [95] , to name the most popular prototypes. These have been recently reviewed [96] [97] [98] [99] [100] [101] [102] . All docking tools follow slightly different concepts. This might give individual programs a particular advantage in one task with respect to another -for example, incorporating aspects such as flexibility of ligand and receptor or restraining the docking search engine to particular regions in configuration space (e.g. mapping a protein-based pharmacophore) [103] . However, all docking tools are still far from perfect. An even more challenging, but carelessly disregarded, aspect of docking is the appropriate consideration of water molecules. As indicated above, water molecules are involved in binding in about two-thirds of the known protein-ligand complexes. However, most docking tools ignore them simply because conclusive concepts of how to consider them correctly are missing. If structural evidence is given, preplacement of water molecules in a docking run is a feasible strategy [66] . The docking tool Slide [104] treats preplaced water molecules in a way that still enables their replacement by ligand atoms in docking. The particle concept in FlexX [105] enables the placement of water molecules 'on the fly' during the course of the generation of individual docking solutions. In the docking tool GOLD, water molecules can be switched on or off, and can spin around their principal axes to achieve good contacts with a docked ligand [106] . Recently, the popular docking tools DOCK and FlexX have been equipped with features that enable docking on a preconceived pharmacophore or property distributions [107, 108] . Consideration of such criteria will drive docking solutions especially into regions either frequently trapped by other bound ligands or featured by complementary analytical tools as being particularly relevant for binding. The program AutoDock [95] performs docking on a precalculated grid, storing potential values from any sort of interaction field [109] . In the original implementation, Lennard-Jones and Coulomb potential values are used. Sotriffer et al. [110] replaced these by knowledge-based potentials, originally implemented into DrugScore. The latter potentials have proven to be powerful for discriminating, and rank among multiple ligand poses. The potential grid approach in AutoDock also enables one to average across the fields produced by various protein frames, so that the conformational degrees of freedom of a protein can be considered. In addition, adapted fields optimized with respect to the binding properties of some known actives in the comparative molecular field-type approach 'adaptation of fields for molecular comparison' (AFMoC) [111] can be used as target potential values in AutoDock [112] . The latter docking tool performs multiple stochastic searches on the potential hypersurface; accordingly, the frequency of occurrence of certain docking solutions can be used as an additional figure of merit for their relevance [113] .",

The complexity of the docking problem increases with the size of the ligand and its number of rotatable bonds. Thus, smaller molecules in the typical range of ligand fragments should be simpler to dock. Perplexingly, present experience indicates the opposite to be the case. Fragments are easily scattered over a binding site by docking; reliably successful docking can only occur if the binding site itself is restricted in size and shows dimensions similar to the fragments [48] . Interestingly, experimental approaches show the opposite: small molecular fragments (>200 Da) usually populate, in a well-defined manner, in a very limited number of sites in binding pockets [69, 70] .",

All compounds are submitted to the selected VS protocol, and the performance ranks of the known actives with respect to the remaining pool are converted into enrichment plots. Such a process is essential for keeping control over the performance and achievements of VS. However, the choice of the random compound library is crucial and can strongly affect the enrichments obtained [72] . Accordingly, it has to be examined whether the pooled, randomly picked decoy structures are actually nonbinders. In a real-life scenario, it should be noted that merging known actives with a set of candidate ligands should result in a gradually declining enrichment rate at the subsequent hierarchical filter steps because novel actives, retrieved by VS, will populate in prominent ranks and dilute the set of predefined known actives.",

This equilibrium constant is logarithmically related to the Gibbs free energy, comprising both an enthal-pic and entropic contribution.

With the increasing speed of computers, such methods are becoming more accurate and obtaining a growing relevance for scoring [119] . However, screening large samples of docked solutions to estimate binding affinities is still far beyond tractability. Nevertheless, first-principle methods do not need any calibration or training in experimentally determined affinity data; thus, they will not suffer from inherent experimental shortcomings or accuracy limits.

They are assumed to be independent from each other, and their individual contribution in reproducing the known affinities of some training set ligands is extracted by regression analysis, partial least-squares analysis or neural networks [59] . However, independence of the 'terms' is unlikely, and fair to strong correlations between terms are probable. In the correlation analysis, this fact might point out that another, at first glance surprising, property pops up as the best explanation. However, it might be the case that the latter property is not on its own essential in a physical sense, but is highly correlated with another property that is actually crucial. We recently parameterized a new regression-based scoring function on the basis of a large sample of crystal structures with known affinities for the bound ligands. Depending on the composition of the training set, different terms are found to be relevant in the analysis. This clearly shows that such empirical scoring functions reflect a best fit with respect to the training set used but they rarely achieve generality.",

Any deviations from this average can be translated using some type of mathematical relationship into statistical preferences that can be used to determine the geometry of protein-ligand complexes.

The relative differences in binding data within a series of compounds can be determined precisely -usually much better than across data from various systems for which the comparison has to be performed on an absolute scale. In consequence, the standard deviations of predicted binding affinities of presently available functions range between 0.7 and 1.5 logarithmic units in binding affinity. This range matches the experimental accuracy achieved for binding data across training sets of growing heterogeneity covering a broad spectrum of targets. In our experience, knowledge-based scoring functions are better able to extract binding geometries generated by a docking program that closely approximate the experimentally confirmed binding mode from a sample set of decoy placements. By contrast, regression-based scoring functions are better in the actual affinity prediction, provided that a fairly accurate binding geometry is given. Unlike the professed opinion that in docking the geometry problem has been resolved to a sufficient extent, and that the scoring problem remains an open question [120, 121] , it appears that both are intimately related. We recently developed a knowledge-based scoring function based on accurate contact data from small molecule crystal data [122] . This function reliably recognizes the experimentally determined binding mode found in a crystal structure among a set of decoy poses. It appears selfevident that the scoring problem can only be alleviated if more relevant, near-native binding poses are produced by docking programs and reliably recognized by a scoring function. Accordingly, it appears advisable to drive docking solutions as close as possible to the native geometries -that is, as they would show up in a corresponding crystal structure. This can also be achieved by optimizing them towards the near-native situation. At best, this involves minimization with respect to the function used for scoring. As a disadvantage, this process would be computationally demanding.",

            "text": "Any discussion of scoring and ranking must ask the question as to how well we understand the target value Gibbs free energy. Is it advisable to focus scoring on free energy or would it be better to treat enthalpy and entropy as separate terms in the scoring [123] ? There is a mutual compensation between enthalpy and entropy owing to the fact that both entities scatter over much larger ranges than does the free energy itself. Considering the binding of a ligand to a protein, enthalpy (DH) and entropy (-TDS) can easily scatter over a 3-4-fold larger range than the spread of Gibbs free energy (DG). The mutual compensation of enthalpy and entropy can even be found across closely related molecules [124] (Figure 5 ). Furthermore, many physicochemical phenomena of relevance for the binding process are not yet fully understood and, therefore, have not yet been correctly incorporated into scoring functions (e.g. the role of water, change in protonation states or an appropriate consideration of entropy). Interestingly, microcalorimetry indicates that with increasing temperature, the protein-ligand binding process becomes more exothermic and entropically less favourable [58, 59] . Because this observation applies to all targets, it suggests that general phenomena are involved which are not yet understood at a molecular level. Despite our present deficiencies in understanding the physics of the binding process, scoring still works satisfactorily -most likely because we consider the binding of ligands to a protein on a relative scale to each other. Accordingly, any unappreciated phenomena, similar across all complexes in the analysis, will simply be cancelled out. For example, as mentioned above, one approach for reflecting protein flexibility applies parallel docking into several rigid binding-competent conformers of the protein. The disadvantage of this strategy is the fact that additional degrees of scoring are created: what discriminates the scoring against different protein conformers? Cancellation of unreflected internal protein energy contributions is no longer certain. Studies have shown that a special scoring scheme or protocol is required [48, 52] . Because dramatic energy differences between low-energy conformers are unlikely, a modulated pocket size for the different protein conformers might require individual scoring of the altered desolvation properties of the binding site.",

Accordingly, the desired accuracy of scoring depends on whether, at first glance, prioritization of the sample set for testing is anticipated or whether putative actives are expected among the top ten or 100 of a hit list. The latter requires very powerful discrimination of actives over inactive decoy binders. Present scoring functions have been optimized to discriminate for a particular ligand decoy binding mode from near-native ones. The discrimination of binders from decoy nonbinders still remains as major challenge for VS protocols [125] . At worst, in these cases the above-mentioned poorly understood contributions to binding become overwhelmingly important. Perhaps the consideration of similarity criteria in the search [87, 107, 108, [110] [111] [112] enables the problem to be alleviated to some degree because this drives the search towards more closely related ligands for which some of the disregarded effects in scoring cancel themselves out.",

Few of the foundations of proteinligand recognition are understood well enough to be deployed in a large scale, multi-compound effort such as that commonly undertaken in VS. This calls for further indepth research. In particular, protein flexibility and induced-fit adaptations, the role of water in solvation, desolvation and ligand binding, and the electrostatics involved, including changes in protonation states and an appropriate consideration of entropic changes, will need to be better understood to improve the hit retrieval rates in VS. Frequently, experimental work performed in parallel or as a follow-up to a VS campaign provides a whole bunch of unexpected results pointing towards manifold deficiencies of the concepts applied. Many more experimental studies are required. Nevertheless, VS has proven successful and as a valuable alternative to HTS, in particular if it is used as a tool to support and complement hit discovery.

Its cyclic urea-type skeleton is distinct in its structure and binding mode from any known natural substrate and it can serve as a synthetically easily accessible lead.
