Lung biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis. In this retrospective single-center study, we describe 33 patients who underwent biopsy for suspected BO. Ten patients had constrictive BO (CBO); 9 had lymphocytic bronchiolitis (LB), characterized by lymphocytic infiltration of the bronchioles. Six additional patients (4, CBO; 2, LB) had concomitant infection; 8 had other pathological diagnoses. Seven patients with CBO and 3 with LB met the National Institutes of Health consensus BO syndrome definition criteria. An additional 7 patients with histologically confirmed CBO did not meet the consensus definition, 4 of them because of concomitant airway infection. At diagnosis, there were no significant differences between the CBO and LB groups in clinical presentation; pulmonary function tests (median forced expiratory volume in one second [FEV1] at baseline, 90.4% and 99% predicted, at time of video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery, 55.1% and 60.8% for CBO and LB groups, respectively); and chest scans. Treatment was similar in both groups but outcome was different depending on histological findings. FEV1 significantly improved in LB patients compared with CBO patients. Survivals at 1 and 3 years were 77% AE 12% and 60% AE 14% for patients with CBO and 91% AE 9% for patients with LB (P \u00bc .028). Lung biopsy in patients with suspected BO enables better characterization of the pattern of BO syndrome. In contrast to CBO, LB is associated with a good long-term prognosis.",

It might be partially explained by more successful treatment of other posttransplantation complications, thereby exposing more patients at risk for bronchiolitis obliterans (BO) and because of an increased use of unrelated donors [9] [10] [11] . In addition, differences in the incidence of BOS are in part due to the diagnostic methods. Risk factors for the development of BOS include pretransplantation lung function, type and intensity of the conditioning regimen, use of peripheral blood stem cells, immunoglobulin levels, and respiratory infections [12] [13] [14] . Moreover, the occurrence of GVHD at other sites is associated with BOS [15] .",

Furthermore, although this is a small patient number, signs of air trapping in HR-CT scans were only seen in about 30% of histologically proven CBO. Hence the current definition includes patients with different histological entities and may miss some patients with CBO. This may have an impact on the interpretation of therapeutic interventional trial results if no histologic confirmation of BO is done. If these results are confirmed, the current NIH consensus BOS definition may need to be modified to increase sensitivity. In addition, the suspicion for evolving BO should remain high even in the presence of an infection. Finally, our results confirm that biopsy remains the gold standard for diagnosis of BO, as outlined in the NIH consensus documents. This statement is further supported by the fact that we found other distinct pathological diagnoses in 8 (24%) of our patients with strong suspicion of BOS.

However, because of the rarity of BO and the fact that only a few centers seek a histological diagnosis, our study is, to the best of our knowledge, the largest of its kind reported so far. The retrospective design and the lack of repeated biopsies during follow-up only allow generating some hypotheses. Hence it remains an open question if CBO and LB represent 2 different stages of the same disease process or if they are 2 different entities. It seems reasonable that an inflammatory process like LB precedes the fibrosis that is observed in CBO [31, 32] , as it has also been described in a case report [33] but the pathophysiology of CBO remains to be further elucidated. Because this was not a prospective study, histologic findings did not translate yet into different treatment strategies. Treatment was mainly guided by the further course of PFT. With similar immunosuppressive treatment, recovery of the lung function measured by FEV1 and survival were strikingly different between these 2 groups. Hence, if our hypothesis is true, our results suggest that intensive immunosuppression may be able to reverse the pathophysiological process if bronchiolitis is detected at an early stage when inflammatory changes predominate, and prevent the development of fibrosis, thus altering the otherwise poor prognosis of evolving BO. When constrictive changes are already established, intensive immunosuppression will not lead to improvements in airway narrowing, and may even contribute to further deterioration of lung function by increasing the susceptibility to infections or increasing the risk for relapse and/or the development of secondary malignancy. For these patients, new antiproliferative approaches need to be investigated.",
