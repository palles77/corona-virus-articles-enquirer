Poirel (Le Kremlin Bicetre, FR) Oxacillinases are class D b-lactamases, grouping very diverse enzymes usually not sensitive to b-lactamase inhibitors. Some oxacillinases hydrolyse only narrow-spectrum b-lactams, some others expandedspectrum cephalosporins, but more worrying are those oxacillinases hydrolysing carbapenems. Those latter oxacillinases named CHDLs for \"Carbapenem-Hydrolysing class D b-Lactamases\" have been identified in a variety of Gram-negative bacterial species. They do hydrolyse penicillins and carbapenems at a low level, but their hydrolysis spectrum does not include expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. They are not inhibited by clavulanic acid but are inhibited by NaCl in vitro. Some CHDLs correspond to naturally-occurring b-lactamases encoded on the chromosome of a variety of species, such as Acinetobacter baumannii, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Ralstonia pickettii. The corresponding genes are often poorly expressed, and the impact of those carbapenemases on the carbapenem susceptibility of the corresponding species seems marginal. However, it has been demonstrated that overexpression of the naturally-occurring blaOXA-51-like gene of A. baumannii (linked to insertion of an IS element upstream of that gene) can lead to decreased susceptibility to imipenem. By contrast, other CHDLs are considered as acquired, leading to esistance to carbapenems. Most of these acquired CHDLs have been identified in A. baumannii, being of three types (OXA-23, . Those acquired enzymes may be either plasmidor cchromosome-encoded. Those oxacillinases have been identified worldwide, always identified in carbapenem-resistant isolates, those latter being very often at the origin of nosocomial outbreaks. Interestingly, the source of the OXA-23-encoding gene has been very recently identified, being the chromosome of the carbapenem-susceptible Acinetobacter radioresistens species, in which blaOXA-23 is poorly expressed. Another acquired CHDL is OXA-48 identified firstly in a carbapenemresistant Klebsiella pneumoniae isolate from Turkey, which has now widely disseminated in Istanbul, responsible for large outbreaks. The blaOXA-48 gene is plasmid-encoded and has been recently evidenced in other enterobacterial species in the same country. Interestingly, the source of that acquired CHDL was shown to be the Gram-negative, environmental and waterborne species Shewanella oneidensis.",

These acquired enzymes display an extremely wide spectrum of hydrolysis that includes also carbapenems. The MBLencoding genes commonly occur as cassettes in integrons carried by a variety of transferable plasmids and enterobacterial chromosomes underscoring their spreading potential. Indeed, a physical linkage of MBL integrons with transposable elements has been, in some instances, documented. VIM and IMP b-lactamases -the main MBL types found in enterobacteria -have already achieved a global spread, the southern Europe and the Far East being the most affected regions. There are quite a few epidemiological studies unveiling the mode of spread of MBL-producing enterobacteria. Nevertheless, our understanding of what MBL production entails in terms of clinical impact is still limited. It is not yet clear if MICs of MBL producers must be consider at face value or these isolates must be reported as potentially resistant to carbapenems. Moreover, performance of the routine detection methods based on EDTA-b-lactam synergy is not optimal and not yet standardised. The aim of this presentation is to discuss recent advances on genetics, epidemiology and clinical significance of MBL-producing enterobacteria.",

In Central and Eastern Europe, Trichinella infection still represents an important health problem, according to the statistical data registered by ICT. Many species of Trichinella larvae, encapsulated or not, are responsible for human cases, according to data collected in Reference Laboratory in Rome, each one having a typical clinical appearance and geographical distribution: T. spiralis, T. pseudospiralis, T. britovi, T. nativa, T. nelsoni, T. murelli, T. papuae. In endemic countries, medical attention should be paid on both acute and chronic trichinellosis. Acute trichinellosis is familiar for medical doctors: short incubation period, followed by gastrointestinal phase (20\u221230 days), acute stage (weakness, chills, fever, headache, sweating, tachycardia, eyelid/periocular/generalised oedema, muscle pain) and, sometime, complications (cardiovascular, ocular, neurological, respiratory etc) . Differentiations between convalescent stage (residual myalgia), sequels or chronic trichinellosis still remain not very well defined. Chronic trichinellosis is either symptomatic (general discomfort, chronic muscle pain, tingling, neuropsychiatric signs, persistent sweating), in patients with history of trichinellosis, or asymptomatic, accidentally discovered, when muscle biopsy is examined for other reasons (i.e. laryngeal or tongue neoplasm), when residual IgG antibodies level is proved (persistence of residual viable larvae), chronic hypereosinophilia or when bioelectric muscle disturbances persist. The role of chronic trichinellosis larvae as co-factor in the development of cancer is under debate, but further studies are necessary to be conducted in order to confirm the direct relationship between Trichinella larvae and neoplasm (chronic inflammation, direct carcinogenetic role, co-factor in carcinogenesis?).",

Consequently Europe has had several different sets of antimicrobial breakpoints and a range of variations in technical methods. It became increasingly evident that harmonisation of breakpoints was necessary both for therapy and resistance surveillance. ESCMID set up EUCAST in 1997 with a representative from each European country and 6 representatives from industry. In 2002 EUCAST was restructured and the major responsibility for the work of EUCAST was taken on by the active national breakpoint committees in Europe. A Steering Committee was formed, currently comprised of a representative from the 6 active national breakpoint committees, 2 from the EUCAST General Committee (which has a representative from each European country), a Chairperson, a Scientific Secretary and a Clinical Data Coordinator. A decision making process was established whereby proposals made by the Steering Committee are distributed to the EUCAST General Committee, relevant expert groups and industry for consultation. The final decision is made by consensus in the Steering Committee, taking account of any comments made during consultations. In this process the expertise of the national breakpoint committees is utilised, there is wide consultation on proposals and the national committees take responsibility for implementation of decisions. Subcommittees have been set up to deal with specific topics including susceptibility testing of fungi and anaerobes, and expert rules in susceptibility testing. A website has been established (http://www.EUCAST.org) that gives details of EUCAST activities, EUCAST breakpoints and publications. Another website has been developed for the collection of MIC data and its presentation as speciesspecific wild type MIC distributions. EUCAST has been funded by ESCMID, the national breakpoint committees, a grant from the EU and now by ECDC. Industry does not contribute financially but is asked to contribute data required for determining breakpoints and to comment on proposed breakpoints. EUCAST has achieved harmonisation of most existing breakpoints in Europe. It has a formal relationship with EMEA regarding the setting of breakpoints for new agents and the revision of breakpoints for existing agents. The process has been applied to several new drugs. Documents on various aspects of susceptibility testing have also been published.",

By early 2009 the clinical breakpoints will be implemented in the AST systems of BSAC (UK), CA-SFM (France), CRG (Netherlands), DIN (Germany), NWGA (Norway) and SRGA (Sweden). New antimicrobials: EUCAST determines breakpoints as part of the EMEA approval process for new antimicrobials. EUCAST breakpoints are the only breakpoints included in the Summary of Product Characteristics (SPC). Daptomycin and tigecycline are already approved and another 4\u22126 drugs will be handled during 2007\u22129. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing devices: Work is ongoing to implement EUCAST clinical breakpoints in Phoenix (BD) and VITEK 2 (BioMerieux) and it is expected that EUCAST breakpoints will be available for both in early 2009. The fact that EUCAST breakpoints and national breakpoints will be the same will simplify the development of test panels as well as benefiting users. EUCAST disk diffusion method: Preliminary results from a questionnaire to determine the expectations of clinical microbiologists in Europe indicate that EUCAST should take the lead in developing a disk diffusion test based on Mueller-Hinton agar. The future of EUCAST : EUCAST has been financed by ESCMID and the national breakpoint committees of France, Germany, Norway, Sweden, The Netherlands and the UK for many years. Over the last 4 years the EU and ECDC have contributed financially. It is hoped that this will be continued by ECDC. There is a need to sustain a European Committee on Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing beyond the breakpoint harmonisation process. New antimicrobials will need breakpoints. Companies with approved antimicrobials will seek approval for extensions of clinical or microbiological indications or modified dosages. New resistance mechanisms occasionally necessitate the review of existing breakpoints. The establishment of a European disk diffusion test is a major undertaking and there will be a need continually to develop it to accommodate new antimicrobials and new resistance mechanisms. All these efforts are best served by a common European committee, EUCAST.",

Therapeutic dilemmas in community acquired acute pyelonephritis are: (1) which patients can be treated ambulatory and (2) with which drug. In acute and recurrent cystitis treatment choices are mostly empirical. This implies that bacterial species and resistance have to be anticipated reliably. In recent years alarming resistance data in uropathogens have persuaded physicians to choose broadspectrum antimicrobial agents. But most of these data come from surveillance studies on all uropathogens in regional bacteriological laboratories. Important selection of urine samples occur in this setting: most samples sent to the bacteriological laboratory came from complicated infections, immune-incompetent patients or people with urologic problems such as pyelum stones. In contrast, the majority of cystitis is encountered in healthy women, so extrapolation of these resistance data is speculative. We performed a surveillance in this healthy population with cystitis and found no alarming resistance at all; moreover, a new surveillance 10 years later showed no increase of resistance in uropathogens encountered in these women. This means that nitrofurantoin remains the first choice in the Belgian GP-guideline (the same applies to the Dutch and the French guideline) Trimethoprim can still be useful but in GB and in the Netherlands more resistance has been observed. Chinolones are efficient but not superior. Because of high resistance, amoxicillines cannot be given empirically, which is a major problem in pregnant women for whom it is the safest drug. The ideal duration of treatment remains controversial, but a recent Cochrane review showed equivalence in success in treatment s of 3 days compared with 5 days or more in all studied drugs. In this case, we are more uncertain about the use of nitrofurans, they are frequently prescribed for five days because of lack of data for 3 days. Physicians have to be aware that with these short treatments most patients will still have symptoms at the moment in which drug intake is stopped. The field of recurrent cystitis is very unpopular, so study data are scarse. Nitrofurans seem most active; of course renal impairment should be taken into account. By resulting in less drug intake for equal efficacity, self-treatment is more attractive than chronic use. Acute pylonephritis is not so common as the former infections, but it is of course a potential life-threatening situation. Hospitalisation has been the rule until recently the chinolones has proven to be a safe ambulatory oral treatment in otherwise healthy individuals. Only by reserving chinolones for serious infections we do not induce chinoloneresistance in Gram-negative bacteria and spoil life-saving drugs in uncomplicated infections. UTI are an interesting field to develop and to study rational antbiotherapy.",

They often result in antibiotic prescription and make up more than 60% of all antibiotic prescriptions in general practice. Thus they play an important part in the development of antimicrobial resistance. A 10-fold difference in proportion of penicillin resistant pneumococci has been demonstrated between the highest and lowest prescribing countries in Europe. The need of antibiotic prescription for the most common RTIs such as acute otitis media, sore throat, acute bronchitis and acute sinusitis has been highly debated for many years. Many studies have demonstrated only limited benefit from antibiotics for most of such patients in general practice, and most studies have failed in demonstrating clinically significant differences between antibiotic treatment and placebo. In the US and UK more than 90% receive antibiotics for acute sinusitis, while in Holland and Scandinavia, the proportion is lower -68\u221280%. For this condition the situation is particular since two different guidelines for the treatment of acute sinusitis have been published in Clinical Evidence: One for patients with a confirmed sinusitis, stating that antibiotics have a moderate effect, and one for patients with a clinical sinusitis where no antibiotics is recommended. Diagnostic problems in acute bacterial sinusitis: In general practice setting it is difficult to distinguish between bacterial and viral sinusitis. A number of studies have, by use of various reference standards, demonstrated some findings that may be of value. However, they have not proven to be of prognostic value as to duration of disease in nonselected populations. Furthermore: Even in the studies with reference standards, more than half of the patients had less or none symptoms by day 10. Also in patients with a high predictive value for bacterial infection, the spontaneous rate of recovery is high. Treatment challenges: A high proportion of spontaneous recovery has been demonstrated in patients with bacterial sinusitis. A study of risk factors for long duration of symptoms among patients with acute sinusitis, showed significant differences for the most affected and the older patients. However, newer relevant studies have demonstrated few predictors for long/short duration. A Danish study demonstrated that a high CRP-value was predictive of higher cure rate with antibiotics in patients with much pain as compared to placebo. Still, a small proportion of patients with acute sinusitis that has high fever, much pain and a deteriorated general condition, will benefit from antibiotic treatment. Otherwise a wait-and-see approach is reasonable. In our own studies a delayed prescription strategy has been demonstrated to reduce antibiotic treatment as less than 50% of the prescriptions have been dispensed from the pharmacy. This demonstrates that a considerable proportion of antibiotics prescribed for acute sinusitis in general practice can be avoided. The role of topical steroids is also debated as the results of various studies have given conflicting results.",

The severity of the COPD and the exacerbation are associated with different pathogens. In the primary care setting usually these exacerbations are mild and do not need hospitalisation. The routine care of these patients is to administer antibiotics.

These isolates typically have a unique staphylococcal chromosomal cassette (SCCmec IV) that carries the antibiotic resistant genes and is lower in molecular weight than the cassette carried by the typical nosocomial MRSA isolates. CA-MRSA isolates generally are susceptible to clindamycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole and doxycycline. CA-MRSA S. aureus isolates also typically carry the genes coding for Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL) although the role of PVL in the pathogenesis of infections remains unclear. In the United States one particular clone identified by pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE), USA300, accounts for the vast majority of CA-MRSA isolates.",

The genomes of two CA-MRSA isolates, USA300 and USA400 (MW-2) have been fully sequenced and may eventually provide clues to why USA300 has been so successful in spreading and causing infection. By far the most common infections associated with CA-MRSA isolates are skin and soft tissue infections including abscesses and cellulitis. CA-MRSA as a common aetiology of abscesses is much better documented because of the ease of culturing purulent drainage. In children the most common sites of infection are the buttock, perineum and extremities. CA-MRSA isolates are also associated with serious invasive infections, especially osteomyelitis and pneumonia. Recurrent soft tissue infections and infections within the family caused by CA-MRSA isolates are common. The most important aspect of management of superficial skin and soft tissue infections is appropriate surgical drainage. Most clinicians also administer an effective oral agent such as TMP-SMX or clindamycin, although the contribution of antibiotic therapy after surgical incision and drainage is under investigation. Empiric vancomycin or clindamycin is typically administered for more serious and invasive infections such as osteomyelitis, septic arthritis or suspected Staphylococcal pneumonia in regions where CA-MRSA is common (>5\u221210% of community S. aureus isolates). Clindamycin is efficacious in treating CA-MRSA infections caused by susceptible organisms. Effective measures to prevent CA-MRSA infections remain unclear.",

This implies that various lineages exist that appear to be ecologically highly succesfull. For both meticillin susceptible and resistant strains it has been demonstrated that many of these belong to such pandemic clones. Based on these observations as well as on the comparative analysis of the many available staphylococcal genome sequences it has been suggested that genome complexity in S. aureus can be pictured in a simple model. The genome of S. aureus consists of a core element (approximately 80% of the entire genome), a core variable element and a so called variable or accessory genome. This model, attractive because of its simplicity, would suggest that the core genome would encode the overall S. aureus-characteristic traits whereas the core variable and variable moieties encode factors that provide S. aureus with more strain or clone specific traits. The talk will describe the genomic tools available for defining S. aureus population structures and how these stucutres can be used to define the emergenc of novel lineages. In addition, those factors as present in the accessory genome and defining traits such as host specificity, invasiveness or epidemicity will be discussed. Finally, recent research has suggested that not all human individuals share genotypes that would permit S. aureus to colonise the nasopharynges. This would also suggest that the interaction between S. aurteus and humans requires intricate matching of both bacterial and human features. The relevance of S. aureus genome flexibility in establishing host-microbe ointeractions will be discussed.",

            "text": "During the past decade, meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) has emerged as cause of community acquired (CA) infections, among patients without established risk factors for MRSA. The differentiation between CA-MRSA and hospital-associated (HA) MRSA is becoming difficult since CA-MRSA could spread into hospitals. CA-MRSA cause skin and soft-tissue infections, but can also cause necrotising tissue infections and fulminant pneumonia. Most CA-MRSA strains produce the Panton-Valentine leucocidin (PVL), a leukocyte poreforming toxin strongly associated with invasive disease and virulence. Transmission of CA-MRSA from person to person has been well documented and ascribed to close contact, e.g. during sport practice or prison stays. Also transmission can occur among family members. In the United States, CA-MRSA has been reported as the most frequent cause of soft-tissue infections. The predominant CA-MRSA clone is the USA300, belonging to Clonal Complex (CC) 8, characterised by a particular pulsed field gel electrophoresis pattern, SCCmec type IV, and encoding PVL production. The CA-MRSA prevalence in Europe is diverse. Although rates of HA-MRSA are very high in England and South Mediterranean countries, CA-MRSA has been more frequently reported in Northern and Central European countries. Isolates of CC80-SCCmecIV have been the predominant genotype in many European countries since late 1990s (Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Netherlands, Germany, England, France or Switzerland). However, another dominant genotype, CC8-SCCmecIV, related to clone USA 300, emerged in 2003 and spread through many countries (Netherlands, France, Spain, Switzerland, Greece or Norway). In Spain, with high endemic rates of HA-MRSA, isolation of PVL-positive CA-MRSA has been increasing in the last years. The predominant clone of CA-MRSA in Spain is the CC8-SCCmecIV, affecting family groups and patients with recent travel or family relation to countries in South America. A worrisome feature is that isolates of pandemic genotype CC5-SCCmecIV (paediatric clone), highly prevalent among HA-MRSA in many European countries, have been found to carry PVL toxin and to be CA-MRSA. Prevention and control of CA-MRSA infections outside the healthcare setting represent a real challenge for the health system and may be a serious problem in containing the spread of CA-MRSA within the hospital population.",

MRSA is a prime example of the oftenoverlooked close relationship between humans and animals, with a potential for transmission of pathogens in both directions. Animals could play a role in human MRSA by direct contact, environmental contamination or food, however direct contact is the only route that has been clearly demonstrated. Animal populations could also be reservoirs of MRSA. The epidemiology, clinical aspects and human risks of MRSA in animals vary greatly between species. Direct transmission of MRSA between household pets and their human contacts has been demonstrated, and pets may be particularly important in recurrent MRSA in households. MRSA strains found in pets tend to be the predominant strains found in humans in the geographic area and it is likely that humans are the source of MRSA for most household pets.",

Zoonotic infections of horse owners and veterinary personnel have been identified. These groups also have high rates of MRSA colonisation and tend to be colonised with the clone most commonly found in horses, suggesting frequent zoonotic transmission. In contrast, recent reports involving food animals, particularly pigs, have described predominance of ST398 strains that have not historically been important causes of human disease. This clone is now an important cause of CA-MRSA infection, first in persons with pig contact and now in the general population in some regions. There is significant concern that a reservoir of MRSA in may complicate aggressive MRSA control programmes. Identification of MRSA in food animals logically leads to concerns about the potential for foodborne transmission of MRSA. These risks are currently unclear but are being investigated. The overall role of animals in human MRSA infections is still unclear but it is likely that animals can play a direct or indirect role in at least some cases. The apparent spread of ST398 from pigs to the broader community in Europe and the potential role of pets as household reservoirs are perhaps the greatest concerns. Failure to properly investigate the role of animals in human MRSA infection and in the changing epidemiology of CA-MRSA could compromise control measures. Conclusions: As observed in this study, the incidence of CAP by Legionella rose notably when doctors considered this entity because of an ongoing investigation or a hospital policy that considered the use of LUA when pneumonia is diagnosed. To the contrary, when Legionella infection was considered a rare entity (period I) or it was only investigated when clinical data was suggestive of LD the incidence declined significantly (period III). When extrapolating these data to all the cases of CAP, this figure would increase considerably and probably thousands of patients would not be diagnosed with LD worldwide.",

The procedures were performed in a Cardiovascular Clinic in Medellin, Colombia, between January of 1997 and July of 2007. Our Clinic is the leader Institution in heart and lung transplantation in Colombia (South America) and this is the first time we tried to find out the scope of our transplant-related infections. Methods: A cross sectional study with case and control analysis was made. A case was defined as an episode of postoperative infection in a heart transplant receptor, while a control was a patient who did not develop infection after a similar surgery. A review of the medical charts of all patients infected and not infected was done. Presumed preoperative (sex, age, diabetes, COPD, renal failure, previous hospitalisations), surgical (duration of ischemy and perfusion time) and postoperative (cardiac tamponade, bleeding, diabetes, ventricular failure, graft rejection, etc.) risk factors were assessed. Results: 141 patients were included in the study. 62 of them appeared with at least one episode of infection as defined by CDC criteria. An association was found (p < 0.05) with the following post transplant events: acute renal failure, diabetes, delay to start of cyclosporin therapy, hours of mechanical ventilation, prolonged stay at ICU. Among surgical events only the duration of ischemy during the procedure had statistic relevance. Conclusion: In our study the main risk factors to acquire a heart transplant related infection were postoperative. It is important to attempt to control the factors that depend on medical interventions like stay at an ICU, days of mechanical ventilation and onset of cyclosporine therapy as a measure to prevent the presence of infections.",

Aims: To assess the vaccination history and exposure to vaccine preventable diseases in IBD patients on immunosuppression prior to the establishment of a chronic inflammatory diseases assessment clinic. Method: We conducted a prospective survey of consecutive IBD patients on immunosuppressant medications. A thorough vaccination history was obtained and blood samples were taken to assess past exposure and vaccination status. Results: A total of 70 IBD patients were assessed (53% Crohn's disease, 33% Ulcerative Colitis, 4% Indeterminate). History of immunosuppressant use included; Azathioprine (51%), Prednisolone (44%) and Methotrexate (2%), Anti-TNF (6%). 91% of patients did not receive their annual influenza vaccination and 80% had never been vaccinated. 97% of patients were not adequately vaccinated against pneumococcus and 86% had never been vaccinated. Varicella Zoster Virus IgG was detected in 100% of patients, 43% had a previous history of chickenpox and 11% had a previous history of shingles. 94% of patients were not vaccinated against hepatitis B, 3% had chronic hepatitis B infection and only 3% were vaccinated. Conclusion: This study indicates that vaccination uptake amongst IBD patients on immunosuppressant regimens is extremely poor. Current Irish guidelines recommend vaccination in these patients. Ignoring these guidelines puts patients at risk of preventable diseases. The establishment of a designated infectious disease assessment clinic will commence to address vaccination requirements and provide healthcare advice pertaining to infectious complications of immunosuppressive therapies in particular biological agents.

MLST has made it possible to compare the bacterial isolates obtained in different parts of the world and at different times simply and accurately using generic techniques but without the necessity of sharing reagents or isolates. In addition to solving many of the problems inherent in the characterisation of isolates from diverse recombinogenic bacteria, MLST has also provided data that have enabled extensive studies of bacterial population genetics, speciation, and evolution, providing substantial added value to epidemiological studies.

Although their biological function and evolution mechanism are not fully understood, they have diverse practical applications including strain identification in bacterial epidemiology. In a typical MLVA assay, a few to more than twenty VNTRs, distributed over the entire bacterial genome, are analysed, and a code corresponding to the number of repeats at each locus is determined. This code is easily stored into databases and can be used for strain clustering and epidemiological studies. We will show a list of the currently proposed MLVA assays and briefly describe representative examples, including open questions. We will compare MLVA to other approaches, and discuss issues related to standardisation and possibilities offered by the internet in terms of shared databases for MLVA (MLVA Web Services). Clustered Regularly Interspaced Short Palindromic Repeats (CRISPRs) loci are part of a recently discovered mechanism used by some bacteria and most archaea as a defence against genetic elements in particular phages. These structures consist in repeated sequences (23\u221247bp long) called direct repeats (DR) separated by unique sequences of similar size called spacers. Their polymorphism can be used to differentiate strains inside a species. It is due to either acquisition of new motifs (a DR and a spacer) in a polarised fashion or to the interstitial deletion of one or several consecutive motifs. The spoligotyping method which has been widely applied to the genotyping of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, is based on the analysis of a CRISPR locus. To assess the interest of CRISPR analysis as a genotyping method it is important to first identify these structures in the genomes of interest, then extract and classify the constituting elements. When a CRISPR has been identified in a sequenced strain (in silico analysis, Phase 1) then its polymorphism is investigated in the species by PCR amplification and sequencing (Phase 2). The last phase consists in the classification and numbering of the spacers in order to compare the strains and produce a tentative phylogenetic tree. We will present the Web services tools we have developed for these purposes, and will discuss the efficiency and informativity of the CRISPR analysis as a genotyping tool, depending on the species diversity.",

The guideline is enforced by the Health Inspectorate. In addition, a national surveillance system has been implemented. From this surveillance we know that, as of 2006, MRSA was detected in approximately 2000 persons (both patients and healthcare workers; the number comprises carriers and infected persons).

Body lice have long been recognised as human parasites and although typically prevalent in rural communities in upland areas of countries close to the equator, it is now increasingly encountered in developed countries especially in homeless people or inner city economically deprived population. Fleas are widespread but are not adapted to a specific host and may occasionally bite humans. Most common fleas that parasite humans are the cat, the rat and the human fleas, Ctenocephalides felis, Xenopsylla cheopis and Pulex irritans, respectively. Ticks belonging to the family Ixodidae, in particular the genera Dermacentor, Rhipicephalus and Ixodes, are frequent parasites in humans. Sarcoptes scabiei var. hominis is a mite (Arachnida class) responsible for scabies. It is an obligate parasite of human skin. The hematophagic biting mite, Liponyssoides sanguineus, is a mite of the rat, mouse and other domestic rodents but can also bite humans. The threat posed by the ectoparasite in homeless is not the ectoparasite themselves but the associated infectious diseases that they may transmit to humans. Except for scabies all these ectoparasites are potential vector for infectious agents. Three louse borne diseases are known at this time. Trench fever caused by Bartonella quintana, epidemic typhus caused by Rickettsia prowazekii and relapsing fever caused by the spirochete Borrelia recurrentis. Fleas transmit plague (Xenopsylla cheopis, Pulex irritans), murine typhus (Xenopsylla cheopis), flea-borne spotted rickettsiosis due to the recently described species Rickettsia felis (Ctenocephalides felis), and occasionally cat-scratch disease due to Bartonella henselae (Ctenocephalides felis). The role of fleas as potential vector of B. quintana has recently been suggested. Among the hematophagic biting mites, Liponyssoides sanguineus, is responsible for the transmission of Rickettsia akari, the aetiologic agent of rickettsialpox. Virtually, no data are available on tick-borne disease in this population. This review will deal with epidemiology, diagnosis, prevention and treatment of these ectoparasite and the infectious diseases they transmit to the homeless people.",

These viruses are members of the family Bunyaviridae and are grouped into a separate genus known as Hantavirus. Unlike most other Bunyaviridae, hantaviruses are not arthropod-borne (arboviruses), but are ROdent-BOrne, roboviruses. Each hantavirus is primarily carried by a distinct rodent/insectivore species although a few host switches seem to have occurred during the tens of millions of years of their co-evolution with their carrier animals. Hantaviruses are maintained by cyclical transmission between persistently infected rodents, with incidental infection of humans. Transmission occurs primarily by inhalation of aerosols from infected rodents' urine, faeces or saliva. Hantaviruses are found worldwide and are known to cause two serious and often fatal human diseases: haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS) and hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS). More than 20 hantaviruses have been identified, approximately half of which are known to cause HFRS or HPS. The serotypes Hantaan (HTN), Seoul (SEO), Puumala (PUU), and Dobrava (DOB) virus predominantly cause haemorrhagic fever with renal syndrome (HFRS), a disease characterised by renal failure, haemorrhages, and shock. Whereas hantavirus cardiopulmonary syndrome (HCPS) is a severe cardiopulmonary illness most often caused by the Sin Nombre virus. The illness begins as a nonspecific febrile prodrome, and then patients quickly develop noncardiogenic pulmonary edema, respiratory failure, and shock. The overall case fatality rate of HCPS is approximately 40 percent. The pathogenesis of HFRS is poorly understood. However, it is known that b3 integrins can mediate the entry of pathogenic hantaviruses and that hantaviruses can regulate apoptosis. Also there is evidence and that increased capillary permeability is an essential component in the pathogenesis of both HFRS and HCPS, although different target tissues, kidneys and lungs are affected in the two diseases. HFRS patients show locally increased levels of TNF-a in the plasma and kidneys and high levels of urinary secretion of the proinflammatory cytokine IL-6. The diagnosis of acute hantavirus infection is primarily based on serology, since viral RNA cannot be regularly detected in the blood or urine of patients. Both immunofluorescence tests and enzyme immunoassays are widely used for detection of specific IgM or low-avidity IgG antibodies, characteristic of acute infection. Vaccines against hantavirus infections have been used for years in China and Korea, but not in Europe or the Americas. No specific therapy is used in Europe, although both Ribavirin and interferon-a have been successfully used in trials in China. The high rate of mortality could be reduced if effective therapeutics could be discovered for treatment of this illness.",

Sensing of microbial pathogens, either in tissue in contact with the host's environment or in the systemic circulation after invasion of the bloodstream, is carried out by macrophages, dendritic cells, natural killer cells, granulocytes and monocytes acting as sentinels of the innate immune system. Recognition of invasive pathogens by immune cells relies on their capacity to detect microbial molecular motifs, such as endotoxin, peptidoglycan subcomponents, lipopeptides, glucans, mannans, flagellin and nucleic acids via microbial-recognition receptors. Microbe-associated molecular motifs bind to a family of microbial recognition molecules expressed by immune and non-immune cells, including CD14, Toll-like receptors, peptidoglycan-recognition proteins, nucleotide-binding oligomerisation domain-like receptors, helicase-domain-containing like receptors, such as retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I) or melanoma-differentiationassociated gene 5 (Mda5), C-type lectin receptors (such as dectin-1) and the triggering receptors expressed on myeloid cells (TREM) receptor family. Ligand-activated receptors turn on signal transduction pathways and the transcription of immune genes resulting in the expression of co-stimulatory molecules at the cell surface and in the release of immunoregulatory effector molecules in the extracellular compartment. Until recently increased knowledge of the pathophysiological basis of sepsis did not translate into clinical benefit. Lately, however, several treatment approaches have for the first time yielded encouraging, albeit still arguable results (i.e. early-goal directed therapy, activated protein C, hydrocortisone therapy, and intensive insulin therapy).

Dimopoulos, D. Karageorgopoulos (Athens, GR) Objectives: There is controversy regarding the benefit of antibiotics for the treatment of patients with presumed acute bacterial sinusitis. Methods: We performed a meta-analysis of randomised, placebocontrolled trials (RCTs) evaluating the effectiveness and safety of antibiotics for this indication. Results: Sixteen RCTs were included, (among which 3 performed exclusively in children), involving 21 antibiotic arms (8 amoxicillin, 4 penicillin V, 3 amoxicillin/clavulanate, and 6 other antibiotics). Compared to placebo, use of antibiotics is associated with higher proportion of cure or improvement [2785 patients, random effects model (REM) odds ratio (OR)=1.60, 95% confidence interval (CI)=1.31\u22121.96, data from 16 RCTs], speedier resolution of symptoms, and a trend towards fewer complications (1840 patients, REM, OR=0.36, 95% CI=0.10\u2212 1.30, 9 RCTs) . However, it is also associated with higher proportion of adverse events (2228 patients, REM, OR=1.94, 95% CI=1.29\u22122.92, 13 RCTs) although it is not associated with significantly more withdrawals due to adverse events (2705 patients, REM, OR=1.42, 95% CI=0.74\u22122.72, 15 RCTs). Conclusion: Antibiotic treatment of presumed acute bacterial sinusitis compared to placebo is associated with a rounded 10% added benefit in clinical outcomes, at a cost of an approximately equal increase in the rate of adverse events. Considering that observed adverse events are generally not serious, and that not using antibiotics may carry an appreciable risk of disease complications, we believe that clinical benefits obtained from antibiotic use, justify the risks associated with such treatment. Conclusion: Fluoroquinolones are as effective as b-lactams for the treatment of osteomyelitis and can be considered as a useful alternative in the physician's armamentarium. The value of fluoroquinolones for the treatment of osteomyelitis lies in the fact that they can be administered in an outpatient setting.

Sobottka (Hamburg, Berlin, Rotenburg, DE) Objectives: Odontogenic infections of bacterial origin penetrate primarily into the soft and bony oromaxillofacial tissues to produce submucosal infiltrates and abscesses there. These infections are typically mixed infections, and anaerobic bacteria are thought to have a central aetiologic role. Often taking a mild course, these infections may, depending on a patient's immunocompetence and the site of the inflammatory process, also produce life-threatening complications. The availability of effective and efficient antibiotics for the treatment of odontogenic infections is therefore essential. Preclinical studies have shown good oromaxillary tissue penetration for moxifloxacin (MXF), and early clinical reports suggest that MXF may be effective in the treatment of odontogenic infections. The objective of our study was to systematically evaluate the efficacy of MXF in a larger comparative clinical trial. Methods: A prospective, randomised, double-blind, multicentre, phase II trial compared the efficacy and tolerability of MXF with that of clindamycin (CLI) in the treatment of inflammatory infiltrates and odontogenic abscesses. Patients received either MXF 400 mg once daily or CLI 300 mg four times daily for 5 days. The primary efficacy endpoint was the percent reduction in patients' perceived pain on a visual analog scale (VAS) on day 2\u22123 from day 1. ",

Courvalin (Casablanca, MA; Limoges, FR; Paris, FR) Objective: To determine the genetic environment of qnr genes among Enterobacteriaceae isolated at the university Hospital Ibn Rochd Casablanca, Morocco. Methods: Third generation cephalosporin resistant unrelated E. cloacae strains (n = 8) have been isolated at the Ibn Rochd Hospital (Casablanca) during a survey conducted between October 2006 and March 2007. Antibiotic susceptibility (disc diffusion method and MIC) and screening for Extended Spectrum Beta-Lactamase (ESBL) were performed according to the French Society for Microbiology guidelines. Characterisation of quinolone resistance genes (qnrA, qnrB, qnrS, aac(6 )-Ib-cr) was investigated by PCR. Identification of ESBL (TEM, SHV, CTX-M1, CTX-M2, CTX-M8 and CTX-M9 groups) was performed by PCR. Identification of plasmid AmpC b-lactamases was performed by multiplex PCR. All PCR products were sequenced on both strands. Conjugation experiments were performed using azide-resistant Escherichia coli K12J5 as a recipient strain. Results: Among the 8 ESBL-producing strains, 4 were resistant to all third generation cephalosporins tested except cefepime (MIC 1\u22124 mg/l). qnrB4, DHA-1, TEM-1, SHV-12, aac(6 )-Ib-cr (except 1 strain with aac(6 )-Ib) were identified in all strains. Transfer of plasmid DNA was successfully obtained for 3 strains. Transconjugants were confirmed to be E. coli using biochemical tests. All transconjugants expressed resistance to third generation cephalosporin except cefepime. With specific primers, qnrB4, DHA-1, aac(6 )-Ib-cr were proved to be co-transferred for the 3 transconjugants. SHV-12 was co-tranferred in two transconjugants. Conclusion: This study demonstrated the association between qnrB4, aac(6 )-Ib-cr and DHA-1 determinants in E. cloacae strains isolated in Casablanca. Moreover, this is the first report of E. cloacae isolates containing transmissible plasmid-mediated DHA-1.",

Therefore, the emergence of simultaneous resistance to these drugs in clinical isolates of Salmonella is of great therapeutic concern. This study was performed to investigate the molecular epidemiology of resistance to cefotaxime (CTX) and nalidixic acid ( et al. 2004 ] were included in this study for comparison. Susceptibility testing was performed by agar dilution method according to CLSI guidelines. Molecular typing was done using fluorescent multiple-locus variable-number tandem-repeats analysis (MLVA). PCR and sequencing were used to identify the CTX-M b-lactamase genes and to characterise their genetic context as well as to determine the gyrA QRDR sequences. The CTX-M-coding plasmids were compared using RFLP analysis with PstI and PvuII endonucleases. Results: All the isolates studied shared a common phenotype of CTX resistance reversible by clavulanic acid. The resistance was due to production of CTX-M-5 ESBL whose gene was associated with ISEcp1 element and located on small (~7.4 kb) plasmid exhibiting identical RFLP pattern in all the isolates. Eighteen isolates were resistant to NA, none of them were resistant to ciprofloxacin. MLVA grouped the isolates into 8 types linked to each other with only 1 or 2 VNTR loci distinguishing each type. The quinolone-resistant isolates were distributed among 6 MLVA types, 3 of which also included NAsusceptible isolates. Resistance to NA strongly correlated with the presence of known mutations: Ser83-Phe, Asp87-Asn, -Tyr, or -Gly in the GyrA QRDR sequences which were otherwise identical in all isolates. Notably, the isolates of different MLVA types had different GyrA mutations.",

Giske (Troms\u00f8, NO; Aarhus, DK; Oslo, NO; Stockholm, Lund, SE; Cardiff, UK; Malm\u00f6, SE) Objectives: Scandinavian countries have a history of low levels of antibiotic resistance due to effective infection control measures and restricted use of antibiotics. New resistance mechanisms are therefore less likely to emerge from endogenous sources. This study assesses the epidemiology and characterisation of MBL producing clinical isolates detected in Denmark, Norway, and Sweden between 2003-2007 Objectives: Acquired metallo-betalactamases (MBL)-producing isolates are uncommonly described in Spain and mostly confined to VIM-2 and P. aeruginosa. We describe the emergence of VIM-1 producing P. aeruginosa isolates in our hospital during epidemics involving different VIM-1 producing enterobacterial species (Tato et al. CID 2007; 24:472\u22123) and identified the genetic context of blaVIM-1. Methods: Two MBL producing P. aeruginosa isolates (PA1 and PA2) were recovered in April-2006 and January-2007, respectively . MBL production was detected by the double-disc synergy test (EDTA-10 mcl 0.5 M versus imipenem and ceftazidime). Clonal analysis was determined by SpeI-PFGE. PCR for blaVIM, class 1 integron, and Tn402 sequences was performed and further sequenced. Transfer of antibiotic resistance was determined by filter-mating using P. aeruginosa PAO1 strain. Results: PFGE revealed different restriction patterns for these P. aeruginosa isolates. blaVIM-1 gene was located within class 1 integrons in both cases. In PA1, the MBL gene was carried by a Tn402 derivative lacking the 3 CS but containing tniCTn402 (blaVIM-1-aadB-tniC). A different class 1 integron was detected in PA2 (blaVIM-1-aadA1). These integrons were also different to those found in contemporary MBL-enterobacterial isolates in our hospital. blaVIM-1 gene was transferred (frequency range 10 \u22125 -10 \u22127 ). Conclusions: We firstly report VIM-1 producing P. aeruginosa in our country. The integron platforms containing blaVIM-1 gene in these isolates were different to those found in enterobacterial species contemporarily recovered during a VIM-1-Enterobacteriaceae epidemics in our hospital. Dissemination of blaVIM-1 gene was associated with different genetic structures and bacterial hosts, depicting complex scenario of this emerging threat in our hospital. (see table 1 ). Cases were also more likely to receive inactive antibiotics during the first 48h of treatment (70% vs 28%, p < 0.001) and even after the documentation of the resistance (37% vs 2%, p < 0.001). They also experienced more frequent relapses (28% vs 15%, p = 0.03) and a higher mortality than controls (6% vs 0%, p = 0.04). Conclusion: The incidence of CiGREC as a cause of urinary tract infection is increasing in our hospital and impacts on the outcomes of our patients. Ciprofloxacin and gentamicin should no longer be used as empirical treatment of UTI among patients who have received quinolones in the previous year.",

Methods: Growth of MRSA (ATCC 33591) was examined in liquid media in the presence of the meticillin analogue oxacillin and the non-antibiotic thioridazine alone and in combination. Furthermore, the transcription of mecA was analysed by Northern blotting and Primer extension and the protein level of PBP2a was analysed by Western blotting under the same conditions.",

Transcription of mecA was reduced with increasing concentrations of thioridazine in the presence of oxacillin compared to bacteria grown with oxacillin or thioridazine alone. Additionally, the protein level of PBP2a was reduced when bacteria were treated with the combination of oxacillin and thioridazine. Thioridazine itself did not affect the growth of MRSA or mecA and PBP2a. Conclusion: Results of the present study indicate that reversal of meticillin resistance by thioridazine in MRSA may be explained by a reduced transcription of the meticillin resistance gene, mecA, and protein level of the coding protein, PBP2a. Conclusions: Iclaprim was bactericidal in human clots against both wild type AW6 and TK-deficient AH152 strains, and was equipotent to SXT and vancomycin. Iclaprim was bacteriostatic against parent AW6 in rat clots but killed the TK-deficient mutant AH1252 in the same media. The bactericidal activity of iclaprim against MRSA in human clots, a setting mimicking the intravascular milieu, shows the potential of this drug for the treatment of MRSA infections in humans. TK-deficient mutants could also prove useful for studies of diaminopyrimidines in rodents. Objectives: Iclaprim (ICL) is a novel diaminopyrimidine within the same class as trimethoprim but with more potent broad-spectrum bactericidal activity in vitro. An intravenous formulation of ICL has just successfully completed phase III trials for complicated skin and skin structure infections and a phase II trial for hospital-and ventilator-associated pneumonia is underway. An oral form of ICL is also being evaluated in phase I trials. This current study ascertained the in vitro activity of ICL and comparators against S. pyogenes (GAS) and S. agalactiae (GBS). Methods: MIC was determined by CLSI broth microdilution methodology against 500 recent GAS primarily from respiratory infections and 44 recent GBS from predominantly wound swabs originating ICL was active against all isolates, being slightly more active against GAS than GBS, including isolates resistant to CLA or CLI. Trailing end-points were observed with SXT against about 9% of GAS producing false-resistance unless read strictly at 80% growth reduction according to CLSI methods. This potentially subjective reading procedure was not necessary with ICL. Conclusion: ICL showed excellent activity in vitro against GAS and GBS, which supports the use of iclaprim in the treatment of infections caused by these bacteria.",

Lagler, T. Erker, M. Zeitlinger (Vienna, AT) Introduction: Multi drug resistance (MDR) of bacteria is an increasing problem in clinical practice of antimicrobial therapy. Inhibition of bacterial efflux mechanisms appears to be a promising target in order to restore antimicrobial susceptibility in MDR bacteria. Previous in-vitro studies have shown that inhibitors of bacterial efflux pumps may improve the antimicrobial effect of fluoroquinolons. However, for most substances concentrations necessary to restore antimicrobial susceptibility were too high for clinical use, which might be ascribed to insufficient increase of intracellular concentrations of antimicrobials. The present study set out to investigate the potency of various efflux pump inhibitors (EPI) to overcome MDR and to explore changes of intracellular concentrations of ciprofloxacin for the most potent substances. Methods: Two previously described EPIs, 1-(1-naphthylmethyl)piperazine (NMP) and phenyl-arginine-beta-naphthylamide (PAbN) and with two novel, specific p-glycoprotein (PGP) inhibitors, tariquidar and elacridar, were investigated in terms of effects on in vitro antibacterial activity. Antimicrobial susceptibility to ciprofloxacin in the absence and presence of EPIs were tested in the following strains: Staphylococcus aureus ATCC 29213 (SA), ciprofloxacin resistant S. aureus SA-1199B (rSA), Pseudomonas aeruginosa ATCC 27853 (PS) and MDR Stenotrophomonas maltophilia ATCC BAA-85 (SM). Changes in intracellular concentrations of ciprofloxacin were determined by use of [14C]Ciprofloxacin. Results: Inhibition of PGP mediated drug efflux by tariquidar and elacridar reduced MICs of ciprofloxacin for rSA from 16 mg/l to 2 mg/l in a dose depended manner, whereas only minor effects were observed for SA and Gram-negative strains. Addition of MNP and PAbN at high concentrations increased susceptibility towards ciprofloxacin in all resistant strains tested. By addition of tariquidar and elacridar a dose dependent increase of intracellular [14C]Ciprofloxacin was detected. Conclusions: Our findings suggest that tariquidar and elacridar are potent inhibitors of PGP mediated bacterial efflux. Both substances may restore susceptibility for PGP over expressing pathogens by dose dependent increase of intracellular ciprofloxacin. MDR in Stenotrophomonas maltophilia could not be overcome by specific PGP inhibitors but susceptibility could be increased by addition of high doses of MNP and PAbN.",

The defect was reversed when serum of other donors was used in the same assay. This opsonic defect could be found in a high proportion (5\u22128%) of apparently healthy populations, but was found frequently in children with recurrent unexplained infections. It is now known that this 'common opsonic defect' is due to a deficiency of a protein termed mannan or mannosebinding lectin (MBL). It is a member of the collectin sub-family of C-type lectins, and initiates the lectin pathway of complement activation following binding to mannose, N-acetylglucosamine, fucose and glucose residues presented in the orientations and densities commonly found on microorganisms. Once bound, MBL activates the complement system in an antibody and C1-independent manner. This is predominantly mediated through a serine protease, MASP-2, which cleaves C4 and C2 to generate a C3 convertase. The human collectin genes are located in a cluster on chromosome 10. The MBL-2 gene comprises four exons and it is now known that three single point mutations in exon 1 lead to a functional deficiency of the MBL protein. Several polymorphisms have also been identified in the promoter region of the MBL gene. Largely through a combination of structural gene and promoter polymorphisms, MBL concentration can vary thousand-fold in apparently healthy individuals, and approximately a third of the Caucasian population has genotypes conferring concentrations deemed \"insufficient\". Numerous studies have now been performed to determine the role of MBL in a clinical setting. It would appear that individuals who are deficient in this protein are prone to getting a range of infections, particularly in the context of another immune defect. However, there are also situations and diseases in which MBL deficiency may be protective. This talk will outline the current thinking on the role of MBL in susceptibility to infection.",

Moreover, an increase of ESBL-producing isolates has been detected in nursing homes and healthcare associated facilities in the community, with the potential influx of ESBLs from the community to the hospital. Also, an increasing prevalence of faecal carriage with ESBL-producing isolates in outpatients and healthy volunteers has been described. ESBL producers are also recognised in other nonhospital compartments, including farm and companion animals and in the environment. The population structure of CTX-M-producing isolates is complex and was initially associated with a polyclonal spread of ESBLproducers (described as allodemia) and/or specific plasmids or other mobile platform genetic elements. Nevertheless, the application of an MLST typing scheme on ESBL-producing E. coli isolates in addition to a PFGE based scheme shows a new situation with the description of successful internationally disseminated multiresistant clones harbouring specific (epidemic) plasmids. The case of CTX-M-15 illustrates this situation. The ST131 E. coli clone belonging to phylogroup B2 and associated with a multidrug-resistant IncFII plasmid harbouring the blaCTX-M-15 gene has been found in different countries all over the world and mostly isolated in patients with UTIs in the community. Other examples of well dispersed ESBL in the community are CTX-M-14, CTX-M-1 and CTX-M-2. The former has been frequently reported in West Europe and North America with the potential dispersion of an epidemic plasmid in different clones. CTX-M-1 is prevalent all over Europe while CTX-M-2 in South America and Asia. Moreover, ESBLs belonging to classical groups, such as SHV-12 and TEM-52, seem to be also well dispersed in the community compartments. TEM-52 is widespread in Europe and associated with Salmonella isolates, and more recently with E. coli isolates in UTIs. Although the association of blaESBL genes with successfully mobile genetic platforms has been magnified as an important factor for the increasing prevalence of ESBLs, the presence of specific virulence determinants in ESBL producers might also has facilitated the persistence and subsequent dispersion of ESBLs. In addition, co-resistance to non-b-lactam antibiotics not only decreases therapeutic treatment options in community patients but also might has facilitated co-selection processes and maintenance of ESBL producers. It is remarkable that most of the new plasmid mediated resistance genes, including qnr, aac(6 )-Ib-cr and qepA affecting fluoroquinolones or the methylase genes affecting aminoglycosides (armA and rmtB), have been found in ESBL-producing organisms in several community compartments. With this landscape, reversion of the current pandemic situation of ESBLs in the community seems to be difficult and new strategies should be designed at local and international levels to curtail the spread of these enzymes.",

Besides the clavulanic-acid inhibited extended-spectrum b-lactamases, the plasmid-mediated clavulanic-acid resistant cephalosporinases are increasingly reported in enterobacterial species that do not express naturally AmpC (Escherichia coli, Proteus mirabilis, Salmonella sp., Klebsiella pneumoniae). They confer resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins. Chromosomeencoded cephalosporinases with extended spectrum of activity towards ceftazidime or cefepime have been also reported in E. coli, Serratia marcescens and Enterobacter sp. The carbapenemases that hydrolyse at least imipenem, ertapenem or/and meropenem are of the Ambler molecular classes A, B, and D in Enterobacteriaceae. The emerging carbapenemases in are mostly the plasmid-mediated KPC, VIM/IMP and OXA-48 enzymes in Enterobacteriaceae. Because most of these carbapenemases confer only reduced susceptibility to carbapenems, they may remain underestimated as a consequence of the lack of their detection. In P. aeruginosa and A. baumannii, b-lactamase mediated resistance to carbapenems is also emerging. In P. aeruginosa, the metallo-b-lactamases (IMP, VIM; SPM, GIM) are reported worldwide as a source of nosocomial outbreaks. In A. baumannii, although metallo b-lactamases are known, the acquired oxacillinases that are quite specific to Acinetobacter sp. (OXA-23, OXA-40, OXA-58-types) are the main source of carbapenem resistance. The natural reservoir of carbapenemases is unknown with the noticeable exception of the blaOXA-23 and the blaOXA-48 genes that we have identified as being Acinetobacter radioresistens and Shewanella sp., respectively. Finally, resistance to carbapenems may result in all Gram-negative species from impaired permeability (or/ and overexpression of efflux) together with overexpresssion of b-lactamases with very weak carbapenemase activity. Lower rates of MRSA and CDAD, were related to strategic, planned interventions such as the inclusion of infection control (IC) in the staff development programme. However, certain interventions, for example increased levels of training, were related to a higher infection rates.",

We have, however, found relationships between interventions and higher infection rates that are counter-intuitive and may represent examples of what we are calling 'reactive practice' to higher rates of infection. Whilst it is interesting to hypothesise that these interventions may be swift and simple to introduce and may not be sustained compared to more strategic and planned interventions linked to lower infection rates, this will have to be confirmed by further studies over time. Barrio, M. Ruiz, J. Ya\u00f1ez, E. Bouza (Madrid, ES) Background: VAD are mechanical pumps that take over the function of damaged ventricle/s in patients with heart failure until the recovery of myocardial function or as effective bridge before heart transplantation (HT). These critically-ill patients are prone to nosocomial and devicerelated infections and to non-infectious complications such as bleeding or thromboembolism. Most reports come from countries with long waitinglists for heart transplantation (HT) with average supports that may exceed 100 d. In Spain, the average waiting time for HT is shorter, and VADrelated infections in this setting have not been sufficiently analysed. Methods: During the period Jan 1989-March 2007, 58 patients required a VAD in our institution. Clinical and microbiological records were reviewed to determine the incidence, risk factors and outcome of nosocomial infections in these patients. Standard CDC (Centers for Disease Control) criteria were used for syndrome definitions. Results: Mean age was 52 years and 62% were male. Median VAD support length was 3 days (1\u221252). Most common reason for VAD was postcardiotomy ventricular failure (56.9%), followed by allograft failure after HT (22.4%) and medical cardiogenic shock (20.7%). An infection (34 episodes) was diagnosed in 28 patients (50.9%): pneumonia (41%), urinary tract (14.7%), VAD infection (11.7%), wound infection (8.8%), catheter related (5.8%) and others (11.7%). S. aureus followed by Enterobacteriaceae, CNS and P. aeruginosa were the most common pathogens. In non-transplanted patients 27/32 died (85.1% of them due to a non-infectious cause) and 26 reached transplantation (80.8% despite having suffered an infection). At the end of VAD support, 38% of the patients were alive, 15.5% died due to cardiogenic failure and 15.5% of neurological complications. Infection accounted for 3.4% of the early deaths and for 19% of late demise. Conclusion: Infections complicate the course of 51% of the patients requiring short-term VAD in our study but they do not preclude heart transplantation. Only studies reporting mortality rates of patients with and without VAP were included. The data were extracted using standardised forms and the quality of all studies was determined by a validated scoring system. Results: 52 studies with a total of 17.347 patients met the inclusion criteria. Mortality rates of patients with VAP ranged from 14 to 78%.",

Wille, B. van Benthem (Bilthoven, The Hague, Utrecht, NL) Objectives: Surgical site infections (SSI) continue to present a major proportion of adverse events in surgical patients. Many countries have established national surveillance systems, which aim to reduce the patients' risk of infection. This study evaluates the time-trend in SSI rate for five frequently-performed surgical procedures in the Netherlands, between 1996 and 2006. Methods: Hospitals that participated for at least three consecutive years in the Dutch PREZIES surveillance network were included, and CDC definitions for SSIs were used. Hospitals receive a feedback report per surgical procedure, including crude and expected SSI rates, which are usually spread and discussed in the hospital with involved personnel. Per surgical procedure, the association between SSI rate and surveillance year was estimated by odds ratios, which were obtained by logistic regression and adjusted for confounders and method of postdischarge surveillance. A random coefficient model (multilevel logistic modelling) was used to adjust the risk estimates for random variation among hospitals. Results: Among the five surgical procedures, the number of included surveillance years varied between 6 and 10 years, the number of hospitals between 19 and 34, the number of procedures between 3,031 and 31,407, the number of SSIs between 249 and 766, and the overall SSI rate between 1.6% and 12.2%. The results of the multilevel logistic modelling are presented in the Table. A non-significant increase in SSI rate was found for mastectomies. A significant decrease in SSI rate of 6% per surveillance year occurred for total hip prosthesis, indicating a 60% decrease after 10 years. And decreasing trends in SSI rate per 1-year increase in surveillance time appeared of 6% for replacement of the head of the femur, of 8% for colectomy, and of 3% for knee prosthesis, although statistically not significant. Conclusion: For one of the five surgical procedures the decreasing trend in SSI rate was statistically significant and three procedures showed a non-significant decreasing trend. These encouraging results are most likely a result of an improvement in the quality of care, caused by changes in infection control in the hospitals. This study showed that an active surveillance system with feedback of infection rates to hospital staff might be an effective strategy to reduce the SSI incidence. Additional interventions might further decrease the SSI rate, and sustaining control efforts are necessary to maintain a low SSI level. Objectives: The cost of catheter-related bloodstream infection (CR-BSI) is substantial in terms of morbidity, mortality and financial resources. Guidelines recommend dedicated multi-disciplinary teams to reduce the incidence of these infections. Total Parenteral Nutrition (TPN) is a well-recognised risk factor for CR-BSI. In our hospital, a dedicated TPN surveillance nurse was promoted from staff grade in 1997 and quarterly multi-disciplinary meetings were introduced. This study shows the reduction in CR-BSI and annual cost savings. Conclusion: This study shows that there was a decrease in the CR-BSI rate after the introduction of a dedicated TPN nurse and quarterly multi-disciplinary meetings. By calculating the saving made in reduction in CR-BSI we conclude that it is clinically and economically viable to employ a dedicated TPN nurse. These figures do not take into account other savings such as cost of antimicrobial treatment and other medical and laboratory investigations Medicine and Public Health (SItI), was implemented to ensure standardisation of definitions, data collection and reporting procedures coherently with the HELICS-ICU benchmark. Methods: Hospitals were invited to join the SPIN-UTI project by GISIO members. Before starting surveillance, participant ICUs were gathered in order to involve the key stakeholders in the project through participated planning. A first phase consisted in a training session to share and further refine the protocol and the data collection tools. Four electronic data forms, designed using SPSS Data Entry Enterprise Server (SPSS Inc.) for web-based data collection, were presented and discussed. After a monitoring phase, the final SPIN-UTI protocol and tools were produced integrating as much as possible the conclusions of debates and discussions and the analysis of the methods used in the existing national surveillance protocols. The six-months patient-based prospective survey was performed from November 2006 to May 2007, preceded by a one-month surveillance pilot study to assess the overall feasibility of the programme, and to determine the needed time and resources for participant hospitals. Results: The SPIN-UTI project included 53 ICUs, 3,046 patients with length of stay longer than two days and 35,152 patient-days. A total of 619 infections were reported accounting for an incidence rate of 20.3 per 100 patients and an incidence density of 17.6 per 1000 patient-days. The most frequently encountered infection site was pneumonia and \"Pseudomonas aeruginosa\" the most frequent infectionassociated microorganism, followed by \"Staphylococcus aureus\" and \"Acinetobacter baumannii\". Site-specific infection rates, for pneumonia, bloodstream infections, central venous catheter-related bloodstream infections and urinary tract infections, stratified according to patient risk factors, were below the 75th percentile reported by the HELICS network benchmark. Conclusion: The SPIN-UTI project showed that introduction of ongoing surveillance does seem to be possible in many Italian hospitals. The study provided the opportunity to participate in the HELICS project using benchmark data for comparison and for better understanding of factors that impact on associated risks. O140 E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa are useful epidemiological markers for the analysis of transmission events on intensive care units A. Kola, F. Schwab, S. B\u00e4rwolff, T. Eckmanns, K. Weist, E. Dinger, I. Klare, W. Witte, H. R\u00fcden, P. Gastmeier (Hannover, Berlin, Wernigerode, DE) Objectives: At least 15% of nosocomial infections in intensive care units are due to the cross-transmission of causative organisms between patients. In contrast to endogenous infections, these exogenous infections are more likely to be prevented by infection control measures. Therefore, knowledge of surrogate organisms for the analysis of patient-to-patient transmissions would be useful. Methods: As known from KISS, the German hospital infection surveillance system, A. baumannii, E. faecium, E. faecalis, K. pneumoniae, P. aeruginosa and S. aureus are amongst the most common pathogens responsible for nosomial infections in ICUs. Over a two years period, primary isolates of these six \"indicator\" organisms cultured from clinical samples of patients who stayed at 11 ICUs at two University hospitals were genotyped by PFGE (pulsed field gel electrophoresis). Genetically indistinguishable isolates from different patients were considered as cross-transmissions if the patients were hospitalised on the same ICU in a temporal proximity of at least 9 days. The association between the isolation of each of the six pathogens and cross transmission (transmission events per 1000 patient days and per 100 cultured organisms) was analysed. Results: During 100 781 patient days, 100 829 microbiological specimens from 24 362 patients were sampled (average investigation density of 1.0 sample per patient * day) and 3 370 indicator organisms were cultured (29.1% S. aureus, 22.6% E. faecalis, 22.2% P. aeruginosa, 14.6% E. faecium, 8.3% K. pneumoniae, 3.1% A. baumannii). Altogether, 416 cross-transmissions (incidence density of 4.1 transmissions per 1 000 patient days, ranging between 1.4\u22128.4 per 1 000 patient days depending on the respective ICU) were discerned. Of these, 19% were due to E. faecalis, 14% to E. faecium, 11% to P. aeruginosa resp. S. aureus, and 6.4% to A. baumannii. There was a significant correlation between the isolation of E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa, and transmissions per 1000 patient days resp. per 100 cultured organisms (Spearman correlation coefficient >0.8, p < 0.01). Conclusion: E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa are useful epidemiological markers for the analysis of patient-to-patient transmissions on ICUs in non-outbreak settings. As cross-transmissions are indicative of poor clinical care, transmission analysis of E. faecalis and P. aeruginosa may be used to monitor adherence to standard infection control precautions.",

In this in vivo model, Cefto-Levo combination therapy was synergistic against this P. aeruginosa isolate and suppressed emergence of resistance. The importance of this finding warrants further evaluation with other isolates of P. aeruginosa including those with derepression of the AmpC b-lactamase. Objective: We have previously developed a mathematical model predicting the response of P. aeruginosa to meropenem (J Antimicrob Chemother 07) and levofloxacin (Ann Biomed Eng 07). However, the applicability of the model to other pathogens is unknown. We extended our model to predict the effect of various fluctuating amikacin (AMK) exposures on A. baumannii (AB), an emerging bacterium associated with multidrug resistance. Methods: Time-kill studies (TKS) with 10 7 CFU/ml of AB ATCC BAA 747 at baseline were performed. AMK at 0\u221232\u00d7 MIC was used for 24h (MIC = 4 mg/l). The experimental data were used to derive estimates of the best-fit model parameters, and AB response to various AMK exposures over 72h was predicted via a 3-dimensional response surface. The computer model predictions were subsequently validated using an in-vitro hollow fiber infection model (HFIM); AMK profiles (t1/2 = 2.5h) corresponding to 7.5 mg/kg every 12h and 30 mg/kg every 24h were investigated over 72 hours. Results: TKS data were satisfactorily captured by the mathematical model (r 2 = 0.93). A significant initial reduction in bacterial burden was predicted for both AMK exposures examined. Regrowth over time due to resistance emergence was predicted for 7.5 mg/kg every 12h, while eradication of bacterial population was predicted with 30 mg/kg every 24h. These predictions correlated well with our experimental data in HFIM.",

Tulkens (Brussels, BE; Nijmegen, NL) Objectives: Temocillin (TMO), a 6-alpha-methoxy penicillin, is highly protein bound in healthy volunteer (85%). However, we recently observed that the level of protein binding (PB) is lower in critically ill patients receiving TMO during continuous infusion (down to less than 70% for some individual patients). This variation could have a major therapeutic impact as it is generally presumed that only the free form of b-lactams is active. We have therefore studied the binding properties of temocillin to whole human serum and purified human serum albumin (HSA). Method: Solutions of HSA in water (1, 2.5, and 5%) , whole serum, and PBS-diluted serum solutions were spiked with known concentrations of TMO (25 to 1000 mg/L). Free fractions of TMO were measured by HPLC after separation from proteins by ultracentrifugation through 30 kDa cut-off membranes (Centrifree \u00ae , Millipore, MA). Results: PB of TMO in HSA and serum was concentration-dependent and decreased with increasing concentrations of TMO. A sigmoid function (Hill equation) could be fitted to all PB-binding data (see parameters estimates in the table). In HSA, EC50 values were proportional to the HSA concentration and residual binding increased with the concentration. In serum, the maximal PB observed was 86% (consistent with the observations made in healthy volunteers), and the Hill's slope was much less steep than for HSA. The serum PB decreased gradually to 24% at 1000 mg/ml. Interestingly, PB remained unchanged (about 20%) when serum spiked with high TMO concentrations (1000 mg/L) were diluted with PBS, except for high dilutions (>40\u00d7).",

Due to their antimicrobial spectrum and penetration properties fosfomycin, cefepime and rifampicin are frequently considered for treatment of SAV. The present study aimed at describing killing kinetics of fosfomycin, cefepime and rifampicin in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) compared to conventional growth medium. In addition, the general applicability of human CSF as growth medium for bacteriologic experiments was explored. Methods: CSF was collected from over 700 patients who did not receive antibiotics. Time-kill curves over 24 hours were performed using drug concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1, 2, 4, and 8-fold the MIC of the Staphylococcus aureus test strain. Time-kill curves were preformed in Muller-Hinton-broth (MHB), in CSF, and in CSF incubated with 5% CO2. Ambient CO2 served to adjust the pH of CSF to physiological values. Results: As expected drug concentrations above the MIC led to effective bacterial killing in MHB. Addition of fosfomycin to CSF did not induce any inhibition of bacterial growth if incubated at ambient air. Experiments performed in CSF with physiological pH achieved by 5% CO2 incubation showed sustained growth inhibition only at fosfomycin concentrations of 8-fold the MIC, while re-growth was observed for all lower fosfomycin concentrations. For rifampicin killing patterns similar to those of fosfomycin were observed. In contrast, cefepime exerted higher killing in CSF with CO2 incubation than in MHB, while being less effective in CSF at ambient air than in MHB. Conclusions: CSF is eligible for performing bacteriologic experiments. CSF and MHB differ substantially with regard to bacterial growth and killing. In CSF with CO2 incubation bacterial re-growth occurs at fosfomycin or rifampicin levels above the MIC, while cefepime concentrations below the MIC exert inhibitory effects. We conclude that dependent of the investigated antibiotic the use of MHB might overestimate or underestimate the efficacy of antibiotics in CSF. Thus, CSF should be considered as medium for evaluation of the efficacy of antimicrobial drugs for intracerebral infections in order to better reflect the clinical setting.",

Tulkens, S. Carryn (Brussels, Ottignies, BE) Objectives: Temocillin (TMO) is currently used in critically patients but PK data in this population are scarce. TMO has recently been proven to be suitable for continuous infusion (De Jongh et al., JAC in press ). However, serum free concentrations (SFC) achieved with the conventional posology (2g q12h) may be close to the MIC in critically ill due to increased volume of distribution and altered PK/PD. In order to achieve acceptable SFC we have therefore administered 6g of TMO daily either as 2g q8h (TID) or in continuous infusion (CI). Method: ICU patients with documented Gram-negative infection susceptible to TMO were included and randomised in both groups. Patients with renal replacement therapy were excluded. Blood samples were collected after the 1st and 7th dose for the TID group and daily for 4 days for the CI group and assessed by HPLC. SFC of TMO were measured after separation from proteins by ultracentrifugation through 30 kDa cut-off membranes (Centrifree \u00ae , Millipore, MA). Safety was assessed through adverse events monitoring. Results: 8 patients were included in each group (8 intra-abdominal infections, 6 LRTI, and 2 UTI; 4 patients had a positive bloodculture). No significant differences were observed between groups for age (SEM) [TID: 70 (4), CI: 64 (5) (14)]. TMO total and free concentrations for both dosing regimen are shown in the figure (value are represented as mean\u00b1SEM). For TID the time above the Belgian susceptibility breakpoint (i.e. 16 mg/L) for the SFC reached 86% on average. For CI, the SFC remained 100% of the time above the breakpoint and even reached 2-times this concentration for more than 60% of the time (lowest mean free concentration: 28.8 mg/L). As expected in critically ill patients the alpha half-life in the TID group was highly decreased during the first injection (less than 1h) while the terminal half-life remained close to 3h. Finally, despite the high serum concentrations reached, no adverse events related to TMO were observed Conclusion: TMO is safe at the posology of 6g per day. If TID seems sufficient to achieve PK/PD goal for b-lactam efficacy, CI allows a better margin of security compared to the breakpoint. These data suggests that the optimal dose for TMO in critically ill without renal replacement therapy should be increased to 6g daily.",

There is a significant and linear relationship between mean voriconazole free drug/MIC ratio and clinical response. Objectives: Optimal dose selection for Phase 2/3 clinical trials is critical for successful drug development. Application of pharmacokineticpharmacodynamic (PK-PD) principles provides a scientific basis for optimising both dose and duration of therapy. Dosing regimens for short-course therapy were evaluated for oritavancin (ORI), a novel glycopeptide currently in development for complicated skin and skin structure infections (cSSSI). Methods: Using PK data from 20 intensively-sampled subjects who received ORI 800 mg IV Q24h x 5 days, a population PK model was developed. PK parameter estimates based on this model were used to conduct simulations to evaluate daily and cumulative free-drug plasma AUC values following front-loaded ORI regimens (i.e., the majority of the AUC is delivered on Day 1) of 800 to 1200 mg. Both single-and multiple-dose regimens were evaluated. Multiple-dose regimens involved a loading dose followed by a booster dose (400 or 800 mg) on Day 4, 5 or 6. Population PK analysis and simulations were performed using S-ADAPT 1.53. Free-drug AUC values for each regimen were assessed relative to those associated with a 1 and 2 log10 CFU decrease in S. aureus using data from a neutropenic murine-thigh infection model (Craig WA, Andres DR. ICAAC 2004, Abstr. A-1863). Single-dose freedrug AUC values in mice corresponding to a 1 and 2 log10 CFU decrease were 61 and 159, respectively. Free-drug AUC values were also assessed relative to those successfully studied for previous cSSSI studies (200 mg Q24h X 3\u22127 days) and S. aureus MIC population statistics. Results: A 3-compartment model with zero-order input and linear clearance best described the PK data. Plasma concentrations were well fit by the model (r2 = 0.966). ORI 1200 mg X 1 dose or 800 mg on Day 1 followed by 400 mg on Day 5 provided mean cumulative freedrug AUC values which exceeded non-clinical free-drug AUC targets and which were similar to those values for the previously studied 3\u22127 day 200 mg Q24h regimen (see Table) . Discussion/Conclusion: The approach to support selection of shortcourse dosing regimens described herein is especially useful for agents such as ORI, which display a concentration-dependent pattern of bactericidal activity and a long half-life. It is predicted that front-loaded ORI regimens will result in improved response rates for patients with cSSSI relative to those regimens previously studied. These data were used to support dose selection for a Phase 2 cSSSI study. To guide the development of agents to treat skin and skin structure infections (SSSIs), the FDA has created two categories: uncomplicated infections (eg, simple abscesses, impetiginous lesions, furuncles, cellulitis) and complicated infections (deeper tissue involvement, often requiring significant surgical intervention, eg, abscesses, extensive cellulitis, diabetic foot infections, and necrotising infection). The latter infections, often with associated underlying disease, carry an increased risk of Gram-positive and Gram-negative co-pathogens. These infections, occurring in hospitalised patients, are unlikely to rapidly resolve with surgical measures alone; assessment of severity may help determine when emergency surgery and antibiotics are required. Severity assessments for SSSIs include clinical signs of systemic inflammation and local findings, particularly the size of abscesses or cellulitis, or signs of necrotising infection, including bullae and subcutaneous haemorrhage.",

Because of the high prevalence of resistant strains in the community (community-acquired MRSA), recommendations in the US are to treat Staphylococcus aureus infections with agents active against MRSA and to assess microbiologic sensitivities when available. Vancomycin has been the standard parenteral treatment for MRSA, but concerns exist regarding toxicity and increasing hetero-and other forms of resistance.

Origin may not be as important as formerly; distinctions between CAP, HCAP, and HAP are blurring as strains move from institutions to the community and vice versa. In general, resistance in HCAP in Europe is less common than in the US due to differences in nursing home populations, or because definitions of HCAP differ. In the US, nursing home patients may be sicker, with a greater frequency of comorbidities such as chronic tracheotomies, multiple decubiti, and impaired consciousness. Risk factors for MRSA HAP and VAP are similar to other multidrug resistant pathogens. The exception is that the reservoir for MRSA is often the nares and nasopharynx. For this reason, screening for MRSA on admission for patients at high risk for pneumonia or skin and softtissue infections is increasingly common.

As MRSA is a common pathogen, empirical anti-MRSA coverage is increasingly common. The negative predictive value for MRSA in an adequate lower respiratory tract sample is very high. However, despite microbiologic results, clinicians are often reluctant to narrow antibiotic therapy. Delayed response to therapy even when appropriate antibiotics are used is common. Vancomycin is the most commonly used antibiotic for MRSA but success rates range from only 35% to 57% in MRSA VAP.

However, the extent to which these are adopted by clinical staff and, critically, the extent to which their results impact therapeutic decisions is not well described. Such information is important to justify the cost of developing and delivering novel diagnostic tests. The aim of this study was to evaluate the extent to which a clinically validated PCR assay for candidaemia impacted antifungal drug prescribing. Method: A prospective observational study was conducted in a mixed 17-bed ICU in which the assay, with turn-around-time of 24-hours, was made available for a period of six months. Physicians were encouraged to use the assay particularly when considering prescribing an antifungal drug in the context of probable Candida infection. Each assay request was recorded, as well as whether the patient received an antifungal drug within 72hr of the test request and whether this prescribing decision reflected the test result. When the prescribing decision and assay result were discordant, a reason for this was sought. Results: In all, 55 PCR tests were requested on 45 patients. Overall, the PCR test appeared to strongly influence the prescribing decision in 44 (80%) instances whether negative or positive. An antifungal drug was prescribed within 72hr of PCR requesting in 14 (25%) instances; of these PCR requests, 4 were positive and a further one was from a patient who had a positive blood culture within 72hr of a negative PCR. For the remaining nine PCR-negative patients who received an antifungal drug, various factors were considered to over-rule the PCR test; these included drug prescribed prior to test ordering, compliance with the ward prophylaxis policy and high likelihood of infection as determined by extant pre-emptive prescribing practice. Conclusions: While the availability of the rapid molecular assay displayed substantial capacity to modify antifungal drug prescribing in certain circumstances, it is clear that physician behaviour cannot be completely influenced by a single test result regardless of other factors. Indeed it is unlikely that this is desirable, given that no test has been shown to perform with 100% reliability. Nonetheless, rapid diagnostic methods may help to improve antifungal conservation and their contribution to the 'model' therapeutic algorithm merits further evaluation.",

Time to results were significantly longer when the pathogen to be detected was a RNA virus (because of the retrotranscription step), a fungus (lysis step before DNA extraction) or a CMV/EBV quantitative PCR (runs performed only three time a week; p < 0.001). Longer time to results were also due to invalid runs, with need of repetition of the PCR reactions in a subsequent run: the median time to results was 27 hours for 5097 analyses that did not need to be repeated, 54 hours for 646 analyses repeated twice and 100 hours for 154 analyses repeated three times. Among all 3037 runs, 264 runs were invalid (8.7%). Runs were mainly considered invalid because of the negativity of the ten copies positive control (7.1% of a total of 3037 runs). Major causes of invalid runs were hardware problems with the liquid handling system (2.3% of all runs), use of a defective real time PCR master mix (1.8%), human procedural errors (1.8%), progressive degradation of the positive control (1.4%) and defective primer and probes (0.49%). Contaminations were detected in only 21 runs (0.7%). Conclusions: Our platform allows to perform a comprehensive set of microbiological diagnostic tests with a high success rate (>91%).

For validation purposes an in silico profile of 5 bacteria was constructed based on known sequence information and tested with the cultured bacteria. Then, colonic mucosal biopsies from 20 patients were analysed using this method. Intra-and interpatient composition of colonic microbiota was analysed in 5 biopsies per patient, from coecum, flexura hepatica, flexura lienalis, sigmoid and rectum. Results: All cultured bacteria showed a profile identical to the in silico profile. Subsequently, excellent bacterial profiles were obtained for the clinical samples. Each patient had a unique bacterial profile, with only a few fragments being identical between patients.

Pal\u00f9 (Padua, IT) Objectives: Recent evidences on the role of microRNAs (miRNAs) in human cancers and their possible effects on HCV replication led us to investigate miRNAs expression profile in HCV-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) as compared to adjacent non-neoplastic liver and its relationship with the presence of HCV infection. Methods: Tissue samples from 22 HCCs and adjacent non-tumoral tissue were obtained from surgical specimens removed during HCC resection. RNA extraction from samples was performed using miRNA-compatible protocols and reagents. miRNAs expression profile was investigated by microarray analysis and confirmed by real-time RT-PCR. HCV detection and typing was performed by RT-PCR-sequencing by using PCR primer pairs targeting different regions of viral genome. Results: HCV RNA was detected in 17 out of 22 HCCs; HCV genotype 1b accounted for 60% positive cases and HCV-1a and 2 for 20% each. Analysis of miRNA expression profile in HCCs showed deregulation of a group of miRNAs, including miR-122a, which was down-regulated in 15 (76%) cases as compared with non-neoplastic adjacent liver samples; miR-195, miR-199a, and miR-199b , which were consistently underexpressed in about 60% of HCCs, and miR-145, under-expressed in 40% of cases. At variance, miR-222 was up-regulated in 50% HCCs. MiR-145, miR-222, and miR-199a showed a stronger deregulation in HCV-positive HCCs than in HCV-negative cancers. These miRNAs could play an important role in the development of HCC since they target many genes involved in the control of cell cycle and cell proliferation, as predicted by the Sanger miRBASE Sequences Database. Among target genes, there are cyclin G1 (regulated by miR-122a), cyclin E1 (potentially regulated by miR-195), map3k4 and map3k11 (targeted by miR-199a and miR-199b, respectively), junB (targeted by miR-199b), bcl-w and cdc42 (targeted by miR-195), and ras-related protein rreb1 (targeted by miR-199a). Conclusions: While investigating a larger number of HCC samples, these results indicate that HCC, and in particular HCV-related HCC, is characterised by deregulation of a set of miRNAs involved in the control of the cell cycle. Background/Aim: Treatment decisions (e.g. discontinuation or shortening of therapy) are based on plasma hepatitis C (HVC) RNA measurements. Both quantitative and qualitative detection systems are commercially available. These systems rely either on target (Roche Cobas Taqman RT-PCR) or signal amplification (Bayer Versant b-DNA V3). Differences in linear amplification, sensitivity and specificity, lower limit of detection and standard of automated testing makes comparison between these assays mandatory. The aim of this study is to correlate plasma HCV RNA values of both the COBAS Taqman PCR and the Versant b-DNA PCR assay. Methods: From 20 HCV genotype 1 positive patients treated with peginterferon alfa-2a and weight-based ribavirin, plasma samples at baseline, day 2 and at weeks 1, 2, 4, 8, 12, 48 of treatment and 24 weeks after therapy are collected for measurements of plasma HCV-RNA loads. Totally, paired samples with a quantitative range from undetectable to 1.6 10E7 IU/mL are compared, excluding those values that were undetectable. For both the COBAS Taqman (lower limit of detection 10 IU/mL) and the Versant b-DNA (lower limit of detection 615 IU/ml) 50 uL of plasma is used.",

Etienne (Lyon, FR) The history of Panton Valentine leucocidin (PVL), one of the toxins of Staphylococcus aureus, began in 1894. The torch of PVL research was then handed down over the decades between small groups of scientists fascinated by S. aureus toxins. Knowledge advanced in fits and starts, notably with the advent of new research tools. The first studies focused on the effects of S. aureus on leukocytes, while the latest, 100 years on, involves genetic characterisation of the leucocidin. In addition, highly epidemic PVL positive meticillinresistant S. aureus strains have recently emerged as a worldwide health issue, leading to a further upsurge of interest in PVL. Confusion has been recently introduced in the PVL literature because one group of scientists recently failed to express PVL in their experimental models. However epidemiological, clinical and biological data obtained from staphylococcal infections in human concur to demonstrate that PVL is a virulence factor in human involved in human primary skin infection, necrotising pneumonia and bone and joint infection but not in other diseases. The relationship between PVL and virulence is independent of meticillin resistance phenotype.",

Despite this, incidence of IFIs on most ICUs is low and ranges from 1\u22125% in most European units. Many candidal infections are nosocomial and preventable. Several RCTs have looked at prophylaxis, predominantly with fluconazole in ICU patients and three systematic reviews have been performed. Meta-analyses reportedly demonstrates a reduction in proven IFI. However, ICU populations are heterogenous:there are marked differences between Europe and North America, diagnostic criteria are not defined and prophylaxis and targeted therapy are not distinguished. Widespread use of azole drugs promotes resistance, pathogen shifts and adverse drug related events. It is necessary to establish methods to identify patients at greatest risk of IFI who will benefit most from antifungal drugs. Numerous risk factors have been identified including length of stay, colonisation, antibiotics, surgery, central venous catheters, total parenteral nutrition, gastric acid suppression, bacterial sepsis etc. but none accurately predict IFI or fungal related mortality. Several prediction rules and scoring systems have been proposed to identify subpopulations of ICU patients who would benefit from prophylaxis. These rules identify different percentages of patients -up to 85% in some centres. Many have been created and validated within the same database and none are practical or have proven robustness across all ICU populations. Cost effectiveness has never been evaluated and numbers needed to treat to prevent a single case remain high in centres with a prevalence of less than 20%. Centres reporting high prevalence of candidal infection should address infection control issues before resorting to prophylactic drugs. Diagnosis still relies on conventional microbiological techniques of culture from sterile sites but the role of biomarkers (antigen and PCR testing) merit further investigation in ICU populations. The high negative predictive value of these newer assays has the potential to influence antifungal strategy by identifying patients who do not have fungal infection. Combined with a robust and simple model to predict the risk of developing invasive Candida infection, these tests that can rapidly exclude fungal infection in high-risk groups and allow a targeted (pre-emptive strategy) to be developed and supersede unnecessary prophylactic treatment. Part of the explanation refers to factors within the patient, for example, the status of innate and adaptive immunity and part of the explanation is probably found within in the bacterium as such.",

From the genome sequences, regions that were homologous to the flanking sequence of the esp containing PAI in E1162 were identified in E1071 and in another PAI negative strain, E. faecium DO, which has a publicly available genome sequence. This allowed us to identify the PAI integration site. Subsequently, PAI integration and sequence heterogeneity adjoining the integration site was determined using normal and long-range PCR in 17 PAI-positive and 34 PAI-negative strains using combinations of PAI specific primers and primers specific for the flanking genes. Results: DNA alignments between E1162 and DO revealed integration in E1162 of a 61-kb large DNA fragment, containing the esp gene, in the 3 end of an open reading frame with high identical to orf1671 of E. faecium DO. This integration resulted in a 54-bp duplication. At the 5 end of the E1162 PAI a 22-kb region with high similarity (up to 100%) to an E. faecalis mobile element was found, while the 3 -end is homologous to orf13 to orf23 of Tn916. Interestingly, in strain E1071 another 8.3-kb element with no homology to the PAI of E1162 was integrated at the same position. PCR demonstrated that in all 17 PAI-positive isolates the PAI was integrated in the DO orf1671 homolog. In 23/33 PAI-negative strains, PCR confirmed no integration at this site, however, in one isolate PCR indicated integration of a fragment of at least 13-kb. In 9 strains no PCR product using primers spanning the integration site was obtained suggesting either integration of DNA elements too large to amplify or polymorphisms at the primer annealing site.",

Methods: PCR mapping and DNA sequencing were used for detection, localisation, and identification of the genes under study. Conjugation was performed in broth using E. coli C600 (RifRAzR) as the recipient strain. Antimicrobial resistance phenotypes were determined by broth microdilution. Plasmid DNA was extracted by the method of Kado & Liu (1981) and plasmid incompatibility (Inc) group identification was determined by PCR-based replicon typing (Carattoli et al., 2005) . Results: All isolates examined carried blaCTX-M genes on large plasmids (~70-160 kb). Sixty plasmids were confirmed to be conjugative. Restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis indicated several different subgroups among plasmids of equivalent size. Plasmids appeared to belong to different Inc groups varying by genus and blaCTX-M allele (Fig.1 ). IncF, a major conjugative plasmid group in E. coli producing CTX-M1-like enzymes, included ISEcp1, IS26, and mucA structures. IncL/M, a major plasmid group in K. pneumoniae CTX-M1-positive strains demonstrated the same gene arrangement, but with more variants because of additional combinations and small insertions. Gene environments of CTX-M9-like genes include ISEcp1, IS26, and IS903 structures on IncI1, IncF, IncA/C (E. coli), and IncN (K. pneumoniae) plasmids.

Acknowledgements: This study was done on the frame of the ISTS#2913/BTEP#62 Project. However, a larger diversity of emm-types was found in developing countries, notably Brazil. To gain insights into the molecular bases for such difference, the genetic relatedness of the whole surface exposed part of M proteins of Belgian and Brazilian isolates was investigated. Methods: Multiple alignments of the M sequences (from the N-terminus to a conserved sequence in the D2 repeat; 200 to 435 aa) from 51 representative emm-types (selected among a well-characterised Belgian and Brazilian epidemiological collection by a clustering method) were performed. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the neighbourjoining algorithm. Several methods were assayed on the same dataset with congruent results.",

Clade B contains two monophyletic groups showing geographical preference, sub-clade B1 was mainly composed of Brazilian isolates while sub-clade B2 contained 55% of the Belgian isolates and only 14% of the Brazilian ones. B2 presented the particularity of being composed of isolates that are distantly related. Multiple alignments revealed that (i) the genetic diversity is mostly generated by a high degree of sequence variation in the C repeat region and (ii) by an increase of the number of A and B repeat leading to an overall increase of the size of the M proteins. The Dn/Ds analysis showed that purifying selection drives the evolution of M. Conclusion: Despite a small number of different emm-types and consequently an apparent low diversity, the overall genetic diversity of the M proteins from the Belgian isolates was comparable to that of the Brazilian ones. The evaluation of the whole surface exposed sequence variations will shed light on the molecular mechanisms involved in virulence and host colonisation as well as the selective pressure driving the antigenic variation and evolution of the M protein.",

In spite of this genetic stability, homologous DNA recombination has been hypothesised to lie at the basis of antigenic variation of the major surface protein, P1, of M. pneumoniae. In order to identify the proteins that may be involved in homologous DNA recombination in M. pneumoniae, we set out to characterise the MPN229 open reading frame (ORF). This ORF bears sequence similarity to the gene encoding the single-stranded DNAbinding (SSB) protein of Escherichia coli, which is known to play a vital role in DNA recombination as well as DNA replication and repair. Methods: The MPN229 ORF was amplified by PCR on genomic DNA from M. pneumoniae strain MAC, cloned into a protein expression vector, and expressed to high levels in E. coli. The resulting protein, which was termed Mpn SSB, was purified, and its activity was determined in various DNA binding and recombination assays.",

The amino acid sequence of this protein (Mpn SSB) is most closely related to that of the protein predicted to be encoded by the MG091 gene from Mycoplasma genitalium (61% identity). Mpn SSB was expressed in E. coli and purified to >95% homogeneity. The purified protein was found to: (i) exist primarily as dimer in solution, (ii) strongly and selectively bind single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) in a divalent cation-and DNA substrate sequence-independent manner, and (iii) stimulate E. coli RecA-promoted DNA strand exchange. Conclusion: The Mpn SSB protein represents the M. pneumoniae counterpart of SSB proteins from other bacteria. The protein efficiently binds ssDNA and stimulates E. coli RecA-promoted homologous DNA recombination. As a consequence of these activities, the Mpn SSB protein may play a crucial role in DNA recombinatorial pathways in M. pneumoniae. The results from this study will pave the way for unraveling these pathways and assess their role in antigenic variation of M. pneumoniae.",

We studied PTX3 in patients admitted to an ICU with severe meningococcal disease and compared it with the short pentraxin CRP. 26 patients with meningococcal disease were studied, 17 patients presented with meningococcal septic shock (shock group) and 9 patients with meningococcal meningitis or bacteraemia (no shock group). PTX3 and CRP were measured by ELISA. High plasma concentrations of PTX3 (median 579 mg/L) were seen at admission in patients with meningococcal disease. Concentrations were significantly higher in patients with shock compared to patients without shock (median 801 mg/L and median 256 mg/L, P = 0.006, respectively). In contrast, CRP at admission was lower in the shock group as compared to the no shock group (median 58 mg/L and median 165 mg/L, P = 0.008, respectively). Time course of PTX3 and CRP showed that in patients with shock, PTX3 concentration was highest at admission, whereas CRP peaked 48 hours after admission. In patients with meningitis however, CRP peaked within the first 24 hours after admission ( Figure 1 ). High PTX3 and low CRP concentration at admission discriminated between presence and absence of shock (area under the ROC curve 0.85, P = 0.007 for PTX3 and 0.84 P = 0.01 for CRP).

To our knowledge, no quantitative synthesis has been previously performed investigating the issue of shortening the prevailing therapeutic schemes for the treatment of this disease. Methods: We searched PubMed and Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials to identify and extract data from relevant RCTs for a meta-analysis comparing the effectiveness and toxicity of short versus long regimens for the treatment of acute pyelonephritis. Inclusion criteria were: RCTs involving adult patients with acute pyelonephritis and comparing regimens with the same antibiotic, in the same daily dosage but administered for a different duration of time (a short-course and a long-course). Results According to our initial search, 205 potentially relevant articles were retrieved from PubMed and 136 from the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials. Finally, 4 RCTs were eligible for inclusion in our meta-analysis. There was no difference between the short course treatment (7\u221210 days) and the long course treatment (14\u221221 days) for acute pyelonephritis regarding clinical success [odds ratio (OR)=1.27, 95% confidence interval (CI) 0.59\u22122.7] and microbiological eradication (OR=0.80, 95% CI 0.13\u22124.95), and relapse (OR=0.92, 95% CI 0.29\u22122.88).

Sungkanuparph (Bangkok, Nakornsawan, TH) Objectives: To describe clinical characteristics of Streptococcus suis infection, a re-emerging zoonotic disease in Northern Thailand, and to determine the risk factors for death of this disease. Methods: The retrospective cohort study was conducted among patients who were diagnosed culture-confirmed S. suis infection in Sawanpracharak Hospital, a tertiary care centre in Nakornsawan Province, Northern Thailand, between January 2005 and October 2007. The medical records were reviewed and clinical data was extracted. Risk factors for death were determined by multivariate analysis. Results: There were 66 patients with a mean (SD) age of 52.9 (11.5) years and 68% were male. The most common risk of S. suis infection was eating of unwell-cooked pork or internal organs (87%). Clinical presentations included acute meningitis (52%), sepsis without localised infection (27%), septic shock (12%), endocarditis (8%), and septic arthritis (1%). Hearing loss was observed in 35% and significantly associated with meningitis. Positive cultures of S. suis were recovered from blood (92%) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF, 73%). All strains were susceptible to penicillin, cefotaxime and levofloxacin. CSF profiles (median values) among patients with meningitis were as follows: white blood cell, 450 cells/mm 3 ; PMN 48%; L 45%; protein 309 mg/dl; glucose 3 mg/dl; and 40% had positive Gram stain. The mortality rate was 17% and 64% of death occurred in the first 24 hours. Patients who died were more likely to have occupational contact with raw pork (p = 0.016), headache (p = 0.021), gastroenteritis (p = 0.008), septic shock (p < 0.001), low platelet (p = 0.025), low serum bicarbonate (p < 0.001), low albumin (p < 0.001), high ALT (p = 0.040), and high total bilirubin (p = 0.001). Multivariate analysis revealed that only occupational contact with raw pork (p = 0.008) and high ALT (p = 0.001) were the only significant risk factors for death. Conclusion: S. suis infection commonly presented with acute meningitis or sepsis without localised infection. The most common risk of S. suis infection is eating unwell-cooked pork. The risk factors for death are occupational contact with raw pork and high ALT. Education for people in Northern Thailand to eat well-cooked pork and parts and safely contact with raw pork is crucial. Patients who present with high ALT need intensive care and closed monitoring. A prospective interventional study is needed to minimize the incidence of disease and death from S. suis infection. Culturing for other agents is not recommended, unless symptoms recur or persist despite treatment. Lately, we noted a high isolation rate of nongroup B (A, C, F, G) beta-haemolytic streptococci from fluor vaginalis samples from women with recurrent vulvovaginitis in our region. Group A streptococci are known as a cause of vulvovaginitis in children, but evidence of infection in adult women is limited to a few case reports and two methodologically flawed studies lacking well-defined control groups. The significance of group C, F and G streptococci in vaginal flora is unclear. To investigate the association between non-group B beta-haemolytic streptococci and vulvovaginitis in adult women, we conducted a case control study. Methods: Cases (n = 1010) were women consulting their GP with an abnormal non-bloody vaginal discharge with or without itch, irritation, redness or pain from whom a fluor sample was cultured. Controls (n = 206) were asymptomatic women consulting their GP to have a smear taken for the cervical cancer screening programme, who consented to having a vaginal swab taken. Additionally, asymptomatic volunteers among hospital personnel submitted a self-obtained vaginal swab. Ages of cases as well as controls ranged from 30\u221260 years. Results: Non-group B streptococci were isolated from 86 (8.5%) cases and from 6 (2.9%) controls (OR 3.1, 95% CI 1.4\u22127.2; P < 0.01). The significant difference was caused by group A streptococci, that were isolated from 49 (4.9%) cases and not from any of the controls (P < 0.01). Isolation rates of group C, F and G streptococci from cases were low (1.2, 0.1 and 2.4% respectively) and did not differ statistically from those from controls (1.0, 0.0 and 1.9% respectively). Conclusion: Group A beta-haemolytic streptococci are associated with persistent vaginal discharge in women aged between 30\u221260 and should be diagnosed and reported as a pathogen in vulvovaginitis. The role of other non-group B streptococci requires more study because of the low numbers isolated. For adequate management of vaginal discharge culturing is necessary if initial treatment fails. Guidelines should be adapted to this effect.",

We have studied the level of expression of two efflux pumps in clinical P. aeruginosa isolates with MICs of FEP higher than those of CAZ. Methods: Nine P. aeruginosa isolates from different patients for which the MICs of FEP were 1 dilution higher than those of CAZ and where production of oxacillinases was excluded by multiplex polymerase chain reaction (PCR) were selected. MICs of CAZ and FEP were determined in triplicate in three different days by microdilution (CLSI guidelines). Objectives: Plasmid-mediated quinolone resistance is increasing worldwide in Enterobacteriaceae. Pentapeptide repeat proteins QnrA, QnrB and QnrS confer reduced susceptibility to quinolones. In this study the genetic evolution of quinolone resistance mediated by changes in the coding sequences and promoter regions of qnrA1, qnrS1 and qnrB1 genes are analysed in vitro. Methods: qnr genes, containing coding sequences and putative promoter regions, were cloned and expressed in E. coli DH10B. Random mutagenesis assays were performed and the mutants obtained were selected on plates with or without quinolones. Comparing the aminoacid sequences of these and other pentapeptide proteins with activity against quinolones several conserved positions were found. The role of these positions in the activity of these proteins against quinolones was evaluated by site directed mutagenesis. The residues analysed were G56, C72, C92, G96, F114, C115, S116, A117 and L159, according to the sequence of QnrA1. Further, the quinolone susceptibility of the mutants obtained by random or site directed mutagenesis were analysed by disk diffusion, E-test or microdilution methods. Results: Three different phenotypes were obtained in the random mutagenesis assays compare with the wild-type phenotypes: (i) similar activity against nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin, (ii) higher activity against nalidixic acid and ciprofloxacin and (iii) lower activity against nalidixic acid or ciprofloxacin. Only two mutants increased the quinolone resistance: QnrA1 containing R103C+K111M (two folds for nalidixic acid); and QnrS1 containing D185Y (four folds for ciprofloxacin). By site directed mutagenesis, only one change in several conserved positions (G56-, G56D, C72Y, C92Y or L159D) produced complete lost of activity for QnrA1, QnrB1 or QnrS1. The effect on the activity of these proteins was not identical in different positions.",

Objectives: Pseudomonas aeruginosa (Pa) is an important nosocomial pathogen that may acquire resistance to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins mostly by overproducing its cephalosporinase and/or acquiring Ambler class A, B and D b-lactamases. Several clavulanic acidinhibited Ambler class A extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs) and extended-spectrum class D enzymes (OXA-ESBLs) have been isolated in Pa. OXA-18 is a peculiar OXA-ESBL, since it is not a point mutant derivative of broad-spectrum OXA enzymes and is well inhibited by clavulanic acid. It was initially reported along with OXA-20 in Pa MUS from France in 1996, and very recently in several Pa isolates involved in an outbreak in Tunisia. Methods: Genetic structures surrounding the blaOXA-18 gene of the prototype Pa MUS strain were characterised by cloning, PCR analysis and sequencing and compared with those found in three Pa isolates from Belgium.

The presence of ESBLs detected by double-disk diffusion tests on cloxacillin-containing plates, and PCR followed by sequencing revealed the presence of blaOXA-18 and blaOXA-20 genes. Both were chromosomally-encoded and PCR mapping revealed identical genetic environments for Pa MUS and the Belgian isolates. While most oxacillinases are integron located, blaOXA-18 lacked gene cassette specific sequences but was inserted into an aac6 Ib gene cassette. In addition, it was bracketed by two novel insertion sequences of ISCR family. It is likely that these ISs were at the origin of the blaOXA-18 gene mobilisation. Furthermore, detailed analysis of an 8.5-kb cloned genomic fragment containing blaOXA-18 gene revealed co-linearity of the blaOXA-18 gene and the integron containing blaOXA-20 gene. PFGE defined genetic relatedness between the three Belgian Pa isolates and Pa MUS strain. The recently identified OXA-18-producing Pa isolates from Tunisia were blaOXA-20-negative (but positive for either TEM-1 or SHV-1), genetically different from Pa MUS, thus suggesting that at least two OXA-18-producing Pa clones are currently spreading.

NVP crosses the placenta and achieves neonatal blood concentrations equivalent to that in the mother (cord-to-maternal blood ratio 0.90). NVP elimination is prolonged in infants. While single-dose NVP regimens at delivery have proved safe, little is known about chronic in utero exposure to NVP and hepatotoxicity in these otherwise healthy HIV-uninfected infants. Methods: Prospective observational study on a cohort of HIV-uninfected healthy infants born to HIV-infected mothers and exposed in utero to either NVP-based or non-NVP-based HAART regimens. Infants perinatally infected with HIV and/or HCV, and those who received neonatal NVP were excluded. Plasmatic alanine aminotransferase (ALT, normal values up to 40 IU/l) levels obtained up to the age of 12wk were compared between groups; in Exposed, total time of in utero HAART exposure (12wk or less) was also taken into account. Student's t-test and other parametric tests were used. Results: Overall, 170 infants (76 females, 44.7%) were included, 80 (47.1%) of them (33 females, 41.2%) exposed in utero to a NVPbased HAART regimen. ZDV+3TC (n = 100) and 3TC+d4T (n = 39) were the most commonly used nucleoside analogue backbones; mothers of the Non-exposed group mostly received a PI-based therapy during gestation (NFV, n = 57; LPV/r, n = 19). Mean duration of HAART during pregnancy was 28wk (range: 3\u221240wk). Mean gestational age and weight at birth were 37wk and 2767g, respectively. At delivery, 98.2% of the mothers received intravenous ZDV; all infants received a 4 to 6-wk course of oral ZDV. None of the patients showed clinical symptoms consistent with hepatitis during follow-up, except for 8 patients (3 Exposed, 5 Non-exposed) who developed self-limited neonatal jaundice. ALT plasmatic levels were obtained at a median age of 26 days (range: 1\u221284 days). No differences are reported in ALT levels between Exposed (mean value: 19.8, range: 5\u221231 IU/l) and Non-exposed (mean value: 20.0, range: 1\u221279 IU/l); in the Non-exposed group, differences were neither observed when length of exposure (12 weeks or less) was considered. Three infants in the Nonexposed group developed non-symptomatic elevation of ALT values that had spontaneously normalised by the age of 6 months.",

Device-associated infections involving biofilm remain a persistent clinical problem. Our research group has recently reported that meticillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) strains can form biofilm independent of the icaADBC-encoded exopolysaccharide. Here we report that mutation of sortase, which anchors LPXTG-containing proteins to peptidoglycan, impaired MRSA biofilm development. Furthermore deletion of fnbA and fnbB, which encode the LPXTG-anchored multifunctional fibrinogen and fibronectin-binding proteins, FnBPA and FnBPB impaired MRSA but not meticillin-sensitive S. aureus (MSSA) biofilm development, apparently at the level of intercellular accumulation and not primary attachment. The MRSA fnbAB biofilm defect was complemented by fnbA or fnbB alone. Correspondingly, mutation of fnbA or fnbB alone did not substantially affect biofilm and overexpression of either gene alone in MRSA and MSSA activated biofilm. Interestingly FnBP-promoted biofilm was dependent on SarA, but not at the level of fnbA or fnbB transcription. Using plasmid constructs lacking regions of FnBPA to complement an fnbAB mutant revealed that the A domain alone and not the BCD domain required for fibronectin binding could promote biofilm. Additionally, an A domain N304A substitution which abolished fibrinogen binding did not affect biofilm. These data identify a novel S. aureus biofilm phenotype promoted by FnBPA and FnBPB, which is apparently independent of the known ligand-binding activities of these multifunctional surface proteins. Given that implanted surgical and medical biomaterials are rapidly coated by a conditioning film composed primarily of extracellular matrix proteins, our findings suggest that these cell-wall-anchored proteins are important virulence factors in device-related S. aureus infections, particularly those caused by MRSA strains, and may represent attractive therapeutic targets. Objectives: To assess the role of agr in biofilm formation, we studied gene expression of agr in well-established biofilms in an in vivo rat model. Methods: agrA and RNAIII expression was evaluated during in vivo foreign body colonisation over a period of 2 weeks. Catheter fragments (n = 180), inoculated with a low inoculum of S. epidermidis, were implanted subcutaneously in rats as described (Vandecasteele et al. BBRC. 2002; 291: 528) . After explantation, gDNA and RNA was isolated from adherent (biofilm-associated) bacteria (n = 108), detachable bacteria (bacteria loosely adherent to the catheter and removed by washing) (n = 36) and from bacteria which colonised the surrounding tissue (n = 36). Gene expression was quantified by real-time PCR. The amount of bacteria was calculated by absolute quantification of gDNA copies of the housekeeping gene gmk, recalculated to bacteria/mm 2 (with catheter surface of 79.17 mm 2 ). Results: Bacterial density decreased till 6 h post-implantation, again increased in the 1-day old biofilm and subsequently slowly decreased. However it was still higher than in planktonic cultures. In spite of this, expression of the quorum-sensing system genes argA and RNAIII was low 1 day after implantation. RNAIII expression decreased to a minimum in the 2 weeks old biofilm, whereas agrA expression remained at a low level during the whole implantation period.",

This stability in stationary culture was dependent on addition of CSP to growth medium. The addition to the growth medium of BLP, the second type of cell-cell signalling peptide of S. pneumoniae, had no effect on biofilm formation or stability. Mutants for the cps locus (capsule), comC (CSP), comD (CSP receptor), blpH (receptor of BLP bacteriocin), luxS (quorum sensing molecule) and further 10 TCS were assayed for their ability to form biofilm.

The model relying on high inocula in poor media showed stable biofilm formation for over a week independently from addition of exogenous CSP. Despite difference in CSP dependence in both biofilm model systems the comD mutant shows identical deficiency in extracellular matrix production, indicating the most probable reason for the instability of biofilm.

Knowledge of the antigenic properties of staphylococci in health and disease is important for the development of protective vaccines and antibodies for passive therapy. Design of kits for sensitive and specific serodiagnosis of infection, detection of microbial contaminants and microbial identification also requires detailed understanding of the antigenic properties of staphylococci. Serological methods have been applied to the study of staphylococci over many years and indicate the complexity and diversity of antibody responses following exposure to staphylococci, either during infection, response to commensal organisms or administration of exploratory vaccines. Variations occur in antibody levels to the staphylococcal peptidoglycan, ribitol (wall) teichoic acid, and lipo (membrane) teichoic acid in sera from both blood donors and patients with verified or suspected staphylococcal infections. Of these antigens, a short chain excreted form of cellular lipoteichoic acid (called lipid S) has been shown to be of some value in the diagnosis of infections associated with orthopaedic prostheses, native and prosthetic valve endocarditis and sepsis associated with central venous catheters. The experience with StaphVax (a S. aureus capsular polysaccharide conjugate vaccine) and Veronate (a polyclonal antibody product directed against protein virulence factors) also suggest that active or passive protection against staphylococcal infection is complex. A number of other products are under clinical evaluation including: AuroGrab (antibody targeting the ABC transporter of S. aureus); Altastaph (capsular polysaccharide vaccine); Aurexis (monoclonal antibody fragment targeting S. aureus clumping factor) and Pagibaximab (targeting lipoteichoic acid). These may also give a clearer indication of possible antigens for use in serological tests. Many commercial serological kits are already available for identification of staphylococci. These include rapid latex agglutination tests for example the Slidex Staph Plus (bioM\u00e9rieux), Staphaurex Plus (Murex Diagnostics), Staphytect (Oxoid), Bacti Staph (Remel) and Pastorex Staph-Plus (Sanofi Diagnostics Pasteur).

            "text": "Wound, or biofilm-related infections can become chronic, leading to economic loss secondary to patient morbidity and possible mortality. Many of these infections involve Staphylococci spp. which are capable of developing antibiotic resistance. Community or nosocomial acquired microbial antibiotic resistance is eroding the miracle of antibiotics and jeopardising both human and animal welfare. With evidence of increased frequency of resistance to vancomycin, our current most potent antibiotic, the drive is on to develop novel therapeutic agents. RNAIII inhibiting peptide (RIP) therapy represents an exciting alternative. Staphylococci (like S. aureus and S. epidermidis) can become virulent and cause diseases through the formation of biofilms and production of toxins. This process is regulated by cell-to cell communication mechanisms, termed quorum sensing (QS In recent years, resistance to macrolides in Streptococcus pneumoniae has increased in many areas of the world, including Europe. According to the European Antibiotic Resistance Surveillance System, that collects data from invasive isolates, in 2006 most European countries reported a proportion of erythromycin-resistant pneumococcal isolates between 10 and 25% with 6 countries, including Italy, reporting a proportion higher than 30%. The bimodal distribution of the erythromycin minimal inhibitory concentrations of resistant isolates reflects the wellknown resistant phenotypes and the corresponding genotypes: highlevel macrolide resistance associated with resistance to lincosamides and streptogramin B (the MLSB phenotype) conferred by the Erm(B) ribosomal methylase, or low-level resistance to macrolides only (M phenotype) due to an efflux pump encoded by the mef-msr(D) genes. The relative proportion of isolates carrying either mechanism varies between the different countries and is changing with time. In addition, isolates carrying both resistance mechanisms are becoming increasingly common. Other uncommon genotypes, generally associated with low to moderate-level erythromycin resistance, are represented by point mutations in domain V of the 23S rRNA genes or in the ribosomal proteins, and by the erm(A) gene, encoding for an inducible methylase. Although the main genotypes responsible for erythromycin resistance in S. pneumoniae are well known, the genetic elements on which the resistance genes reside and that represent the vehicle for their transmission are only recently starting to be elucidated. The elements carrying the macrolide efflux pumps in S. pneumoniae are defective transposons: mef(A) is carried by Tn1207.1 and mef(E) is carried by mega. These two elements are similar, but their distribution and properties are very different. mefA/Tn1207.1 is characteristic of a serotype 14 international clone (England14\u22129) and its insertion in a competence gene makes the isolates unable to be transformed. Therefore mefA-carrying isolates are usually susceptible to penicillin and most other non-macrolide antibiotics. Isolates carrying mef(E)/mega are heterogeneous in serotype and genetic background and tend to be multidrug-resistant, due to the capability of mega to associate with other antibiotic-resistance transposons, notably with Tn916, carrying tetracycline resistance. Transposons of the Tn916 family are vehicle also for high-level macrolide resistance due to erm(B). Recent studies have shown that erm(B) is often associated with Tn916-like transposons, although tetracycline resistance can be phenotypically unexpressed. The composite transposons have a modular structure, where Tn916 represents the backbone and the modules include one or more macrolide resistance elements, such as mega, Tn917, or the erm(B) element. Although these composite transposons are not conjugative in S. pneumoniae, the natural transformability of the pneumococcus ensures their transmission within the species. The study of the resistance elements carried by particular clones can contribute to the understanding of the evolution of macrolide resistance in S. pneumoniae: for instance, the low-level erythromycinresistant international clone Taiwan19F-14 has evolved into the doublemacrolide gene isolates of the CC271 complex.",

Both slow bactericidal activity and poor penetration into vegetations have been advocated as the main reasons to explain the limited efficacy of the drug. More recently, the emergence of isolates with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin, and the observation of an excess of failures among patients with MRSA bacteraemia caused by \"susceptible\" strains with MICs 2 mg/ml, have emphasised the need for alternative therapies. The addition of aminoglycosides (MRSA usually are non-susceptible) or rifampin, has not been associated with better outcomes. Among older antibiotics, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazol and combinations of fosfomycin with carbapenems, which are highly synergistic against most strains, might be reasonable alternatives for selected patients. New therapeutic options include quinupristin/dalfopristin, linezolid, tigecicline and daptomycin. All these drugs have shown an efficacy equal or better than vancomycin in experimental models of MRSA, h-GISA and GISA endocarditis, but clinical experience is scarce. Among them, daptomycin -which has been approved for use in S. aureus right-sided endocarditis -is probably the best alternative due to its rapid bactericidal effect. However, the best dose regimen of daptomycin in this setting, the risk for developing resistance during therapy and the potential for combinations with other agents are largely unknown. Additionally, a number of new anti-MRSA compounds with good \"in vitro\" activity and promising results in experimental models are in development, including novel glycopeptides (dalbavancin, telavancin and oritavancin), ceftobiprole, and iclaprim. An early identification of patients with persistent MRSA bacteraemia and an aggressive multidisciplinary management of those with endocarditis may help to improve prognosis. Especially important, surgical valve replacement may play a relevant role in maximising outcomes in MRSA left-sided and prosthetic valve endocarditis. Patients who fail vancomycin therapy should have a prompt expert evaluation and receive alternative compassionate drugs.",

The agents tested included; metronidazole, vancomycin, erythromycin, imipenem, moxifloxacin, levofloxacin, co-amoxyclav, penicillin, piperacillin--tazobactam.

On the contrary, the microorganism shows \"in vitro\" susceptibility to ampicillin, meropenem, metronidazole, penicillin, piperacillin, teicoplanin and vancomycin. Until recently, the activity of both first-line drugs for the therapy of CDAD, vancomycin and metronidazole, was not argued and susceptibility testing was not even routinely recommended. At present, metronidazole resistance, uncommon but present, is an heterogeneous resistance with clinical consequences that have yet to be elucidated. Metronidazole and vancomycin remain the drugs of choice for the treatment of CDAD but, both have important limitations and adverse effects. Metronidazole has been linked to a high rate of non-responses and relapses mainly in patients infected with the 027 epidemic strain. Patients with severe or recurrent disease require Vancomycin in higher doses and during longer periods of time. New antimicrobial agents active \"in vitro\" against C. difficile include: teicoplanin, ramoplanin, daptomycin, telavancin, linezolid, nitazoxanide, tiacumicins B and C and rifaximin. Their role as alternative antimicrobial agents against C. difficile is still being defined. Nitazoxanide is an antihelminthic and antiprotozoal agent that is at least as effective as metronidazole in treating C. difficile colitis. Intravenous immunoglobulins have been used in patients with severe disease or multiple recurrences but there is not any prospective and comparative study to establish their role in the treatment of this disease. A hyperimmune bovine gammaglobulin that neutralizes the effects of C. difficile toxins is under development Data regarding the role of oligofructose in the prevention of relapses of CDAD are still conflicting. Tolevamer (GT160-246) is a polyanionic polymer chain with a high molecular weight that has clinical cure rates similar to oral Vancomycin when administered to humans at 6 g/day but failed to achieve non-inferiority when used at 9g/day in a recent clinical trial. Local bacteriotherapy is the name for the lavage of the lumen of the colon or for the administration of enemas prepared with fresh faeces from healthy volunteers. Reports are almost always of isolated cases or short series and there is no relevant study that allows for giving any recommendations on this method, with obvious drawbacks. This therapy has the additional risk of the transmission of other infectious agents. Exchange resins such as colestipol or colestyramine that are able to bind to C. difficile toxin, may also bind to antimicrobials used to treat CDAD; therefore, their clinical use is not recommended.. Surgery is a last resource for the treatment of unmanageable CDAD with toxic megacolon or colon perforations. Finally, the perspective for a C. difficile vaccine look very promising at the present time.",

The production of IL-8, TNF-alfa and IL-6 by airway epithelial cells was determined by ELISA according to the manufacturer's instructions. Results: Binding of purified surfactant protein A varied widely among P. aeruginosa clinical isolates. However, the isolates from acute infections bound surfactant protein A more efficiently than those from chronic infections. Surfactant protein A opsonisation of P. aeruginosa in the presence of calcium enhanced dramatically bacterial attachment and internalisation by both bronchoepithelial cells and pneumocytes type II. This interaction facilitated the airway epithelial cells mediated inflammatory response increasing the synthesis of IL-8, TNF-alfa and IL-6. Conclusions: Surfactant protein A promotes the interaction of P. aeruginosa with the airway epithelial cells and enhances the production of IL-8, TNF-alfa and IL-6 by these cells. This mechanism is more effective with the isolates from acute infections than from chronic infections. To provide a detailed survey of adaptation of P. aeruginosa during chronic infection of the cystic fibrosis (CF) lung, we performed a comparative proteome and transcriptome analysis of isogenic nonmutator and mutator isolates from three selected CF patients. Recently, we showed that during CF lung persistence PA mutators converge to a virulence-attenuated phenotype. In this study, we demonstrate that the adaptation process of PA predominantly comprises metabolic pathways. In end-stage mutator strains, several transcripts of genes or proteins involved in metabolism of fatty acids, nucleotides, amino acids and the generation of energy were increased. Of particular interest is the increased expression level of genes involved in (i) the anaerobic arginine-deiminase pathway, (ii) the anaerobic respiration (iii) the tricarboxylic acid cycle (TCA) and glyoxylate shunt and (iv) the uptake of dicarboxylates. These changes in transcriptome and proteome indicate an adaptive shift towards constitutive expression of genes of metabolic pathways obviously required for growth under micro-aerobic and nutritional conditions of suppurative CF lung tissue. Strikingly, these data provide us with new potential targets for antimicrobial agents to combat chronic CF lung disease. 1 4 MIC of antibiotics were used for quantitative RT-PCR with specific lukSF-PV and gyrA primers. Results: The effect of subinhibitory concentrations depended on the antibiotics: oxacillin enhanced PVL level by up to 3-fold, while clindamycin, linezolid, fusidic acid and rifampicin were inhibitory, and vancomycin, pristinamycin, tetracycline, ofloxacin and co-trimoxazole had roughly no effect. We then examined whether the inhibitoriest molecules for PVL could abolish the PVL increase induced by oxacillin. Subinhibitory concentrations of clindamycin and rifampicin dramatically inhibited PVL induction by oxacillin. Linezolid had a slighter dosedependent inhibitory effect on PVL release. By contrast, fusidic acid was not able to inhibit the PVL induction by oxacillin, except at 50%of the MIC. RT-PCR results confirmed PVL induction by oxacillin and lukSF-PV inhibition of transcription by clindamycin and rifampicin. RT-PCR results of cultures grown with antibiotic associations showed lukSF-PV inhibition of transcription for oxacillin + clindamycin and oxacillin + rifampicin and PVL induction for oxacillin + fusidic acid. Conclusion: These data support that for staphylococcal infections related to PVL production, antibiotic can either up-regulate or down-regulate PVL release. Against PVL-producing MSSA, b-lactams should be associated with either clindamycin or rifampicin while in PVL-producing MRSA infections, linezolid may be of more benefit than is vancomycin.",

The fyuA gene was among the highest up-regulated of all genes, 63-fold. Furthermore, an fyuA mutant showed significant reduction in biofilm formation compared with its parent -both on polystyrene (microtitre plates) and on glass (flow chambers). In urine flow-cell chambers the mutant showed 92% less biofilm compared with the wild-type (Fig.  1) . However, when complemented in trans or supplied with extra iron the mutant regained its biofilm-forming faculty. Also, introduction of an fyuA-encoding plasmid into three UPEC strains increased biofilm formation significantly. Conclusion: Free iron is strictly limited in the human urinary tract and there is fierce competition between the host and infectious bacteria for this essential metal. UTI E. coli has highly efficient mechanisms of iron acquisition, one of which is yersiniabactin encoded on the HPI. Here we demonstrate a direct link between FyuA and biofilm formation in iron-poor environments such as human urine. We also show that the availability of iron greatly influences the UTI strains' ability to form biofilm.

The absence of reported cases in some countries may reflect the lack of appropriate epidemiological and microbiological investigation. The increasing prevalence, in some countries, of C. ulcerans infection, which can present with symptoms of classical diphtheria, also highlights the need for increased understanding of this pathogen, associated with contact with domestic animals. Development of the integrated surveillance database should provide a useful tool for monitoring changes in the epidemiology and increasing our understanding of both C. diphtheriae and C. ulcerans infections. Objective: Community acquired pneumiae (CAP) remains a major cause of morbidity and mortality in the Netherlands, however little is known about recent temporal trends in the general population, which is essential for an adequate policy on infectious diseases. We conducted a population-based retrospective study to examine and compare these recent trends in the Netherlands between 1997 and 2006 Methods: We analysed three national databases to assess incidence of general practitioner consultations (1) and hospitalisation (2) and mortality rates due to pneumonia (3) ",

We wanted to assess how these guidelines and feedbacks are perceived by GPs, and to determine how they are followed for respiratory tract infections (RTI). Methods: SSA (in-depth analysis of actors' behaviour aiming to identify the rationale of a decision when faced with actual data) was used retrospectively on a cohort of patient contacts (n = 150) for antibiotic prescription for RTI. GPs (n = 38) were randomly selected and approached for data collection from medical records and direct interview (n = 30), to document medical history, reasons for encounter, symptoms, clinical examination, patient's demand, imaging or laboratory tests, diagnostic, prescribed antibiotic, and compliance with guidelines.

Results: From January until November there were 150 confirmed (and 23 probable) cases of Q fever in the South East of the Netherlands whereas normally 5\u221220 cases would be expected annually in the whole country. The area has a population of 90.000 and is primarily rural. Patients reported a sudden onset of high fever, sweats, cough, headaches and muscle pain. There were 3 to every 2 females, their median age was 51 years and 71% had a history of smoking. Forty-nine percent of the patients were admitted to the hospital all with pneumonia except two patients who had hepatitis and one patient who had endocarditis. Most patients were treated with moxifloxacin 400 mg once daily for 7 days and recovered within 24\u221248 hours. However, 15% of the patients still had complaints, mainly fatigue and may develop chronic Q fever. Of the 18 pregnant women who were screened 2 (11%) had an active infection and were treated with co-trimoxazole for the rest of their pregnancy. There was a long dry and hot spell during the spring of this year and Coxiella burnetii is highly resistant to chemicals and heat and can survive for long periods in the environment which may have contributed to this outbreak. The source of the outbreak is still under investigation but transmission was almost certainly by way of aerosols. Conclusion: There was a large outbreak of Q fever in the South East of the Netherlands. Most patients suffered from a pneumonia implicating that the transmission is probably causes by the aerosol route and climate change may have contributed to this exceptionally large outbreak of Q fever in the Netherlands. Objectives: Varicella infection during pregnancy poses a serious risk for both foetus and mother. The current UK practice regarding exposure in pregnancy is immunity testing and varicella immunoglobulin (VZIG) administration to non-immune women. This may not provide best patient care, since a vaccine is now available. Additionally verbal followed by serological screening of primigravidas giving a negative history at antenatal booking with post-natal vaccination of those non-immune may be more cost-effective than current policy. The study aims to retrospectively compare the cost of the current policy with a cost estimate for antenatal screening with post-partum vaccination in N. Ireland. Conclusions: High immunisation coverage did not prevent the parotitis outbreak although complications seemed to occur more rarely than expected. Although preliminary data suggests a cohort effect pointing to a problem occurred during a specific vaccination year, further investigations are planned to explain this event and avoid future epidemics.",

Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus, panresistant Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter have been recognised as major resistance threats in many ICUs. Some patients are left without a therapeutic option because of resistance against all available antibiotics. No doubt, resistance is outrunning antibacterial research and development. Since the 1980s, the focus of most pharmaceutical companies shifted from antibacterial to more lucrative disease areas that promise to meet the financial targets of the big companies. To reduce the risk and to speed up development time, many companies are presently limiting their antibacterial programmes to building on existing classes of antibiotics -developing analogues that lead to second and third generations of the original compound. Thus, cross-resistance to the newer agents can develop in short order because of the abundant pool of existing resistance genes. In general, development efforts are mainly focused on antistaphylococcal drugs that target a sufficiently large market. These new drugs are analogues of known antibacterial groups. In any case, the medical need for new anti-staphylococcal drugs will be met with several new antibiotics expected to be launched within the next two years. Clinical development activities against multi-resistant Gram-negative pathogens including Pseudomonas and Acinetobacter are virtually nonexistent. Looking towards the coming years, no new antibiotics are anticipated and no new scaffolds are close to preclinical stages of development.",

The high and increasing prevalence of antibiotic resistant bacteria among patients admitted to European hospitals in addition to high antibiotic consumption and shortcomings in infection control measures increase the risk of significant outbreaks caused by antibiotic-resistant pathogens among the critically ill. In countries with previously low resistance levels (Scandinavia, Finland and the Netherlands), the frequency of multidrug resistance (MDR), particularly MRSA, may increase rapidly if surveillance and measures to combat outbreaks fails. The need for an early warning system of emerging and/or increasing antibiotic resistance for local, national and international use is apparent. A programme for continuous yearly registration of antibiotic use, resistance and clinical practices with automatic feedback through a website was developed for use in ICUs. It was launched as \"CARE-ICU\" in 2005. Antibiotics to which >90% of isolates of a species were susceptible were defined as treatment alternatives (TA90) which is a novel index of susceptibility to measure the magnitude of MDR. Thirty four ICUs in 8 countries participated in the large pilot during 2005. The median yearly admissions and admission days were 551 and 2595 respectively. There were four important main findings in this first report from CARE-ICU. First, antibiotic consumption varied widely from 348 to 4992 DDD1000 with a relatively high median consumption of 1254 DDD1000. Second, levels of antibiotic resistance was very high in many settings but varied also greatly between species, ICUs and countries and the finding that more than half of all participating ICUs had no or only one treatment alternative (TA90) for P. aeruginosa with at least 90% susceptibility to aminoglycoside, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin and carbapenem was alarming. Third, there was a lack of rooms for isolation precautions and cohort care for patients colonised or infected with alert organism. Four, antibiotic guidelines including routines for discontinuation of antibiotics, was available in some of the high antibiotic consuming ICUs but with low compliance which shows the need for more effective tools for change of prescription behaviour and a sustainable surveillance of compliance to guidelines in general.",

Two main mechanisms are responsible for the effect of childhood vaccination on adults: 1) A vaccinated child grows to be a vaccinated adult. In some instances the adult may be protected and in other he/she might show a modified disease; and 2) vaccinated children often show reduction in carriage and then spread of pathogens to adults, protecting them from disease (herd immunity).

A longer duration of viral shedding and higher viral titres in the naso-pharynx compared with adults, associated with promiscuity (day care centres, school) explain the children' major vector role in this respiratory transmission. Any intervention in childhood limiting Influenza virus circulation in the community should provide indirect protection (\"herd immunity\") to adults. Large immunisation programmes in children have been investigated in different settings measuring the protection of contacts (households) or the community at large. So far, routine immunisation of school-age children appear to be effective in preventing the disease burden in the community and adults contacts in several studies. Nevertheless, methodological discrepancies between them render imprecise the estimation of this strategy on effectiveness: which preventable fraction is achievable in adults? The impact in the community depends on the coverage rate achieved, the vaccine efficacy and the contact patterns. Some simulation models taking in account different efficacy figures of Influenza vaccines (most assume a protective efficacy of 70% and a 80% efficacy for infectiousness) and different coverage levels suggest that a coverage rate of 20% of schoolchildren would result in as much mortality reduction in elderly as vaccinating 90% of persons aged 64 and over. Nevertheless, if the universal influenza immunisation strategy in schoolchildren has demonstrated some benefits in term of reduction of the disease burden -either in observational studies or in mathematical models -in adults or elderly, some points must be raised: -Routine vaccination of school aged children has not been shown to decrease by indirect effect the burden of disease in infants and younger children who are highly infectious (thus transmitting the virus) or more at risk of hospitalisation for severe Influenza disease. So far the American recommendation of immunisation first before 23 months of age, then, since 2006 up to 59 months of age is mainly based on a reduction of morbidity, hospitalisation, mortality in the targeted group. -An other source of concern is the low coverage rates achieved postrecommendation in the US, especially for the full primo-vaccination demanding two doses below 9 years of age. -It has not been demonstrated yet that routine vaccination of children below 2 years of age has an indirect impact in the population. -In Europe, the injectable trivalent inactivated influenza vaccine TIV, sole available raises the issues of acceptability by the families, and on a national public health point of view the feasibility of such a programme, the huge increase of resources and the adequate information strategies. -TIV efficacy may vary depending of the child's age, the matching of the strains -wild/vaccine -although mathematical models assume its upper range (70%) and never more conservative hypothesis (the real life). -Clearly the availability of an intra-nasal live attenuated influenza vaccine in Europe could be an opportunity to enlarge the strategies due to its higher protective efficacy and easiness of administration.",

Since the generalised use, for newborns and children only, of the first pertussis vaccines, called Pertussis whole-cell (Pw) vaccines, because composed of inactivated bacterial suspensions, Pertussis is still endemic. Why? The use of Pw vaccines led to a dramatic decrease in the incidence of the disease in children but conducted to demonstrate and confirm that Pertussis is not a paediatric disease. Pertussis can infect children, as well as adolescents or adults. The disease is dramatic for newborns but also for persons at risk such as elderly and pregnant women. One of the characteristics of Pertussis is to induce a short immunity, as well as Pw vaccines. A human can be infected two or three times during its life. Twenty years after the introduction of Pw vaccines for children, adults are no more immune and can contaminate newborns too young to be vaccinated. For this reason, the introduction of vaccine boosters was needed. This was possible after the development of Pertussis acellular (Pa) vaccines, composed of purified inactivated bacterial proteins. Since 1995, these vaccines are used for newborns and children but also for adolescents and adults in many developed countries in Australia, North America and Europe. However, vaccine coverage of adolescents and adults is still low and mortality of newborns less than 2 months of age is now again observed in developed countries. Adequate pertussis surveillance and reporting system are important to implement vaccine strategy. They must be reinforced to evaluate the consequences of the changes of (i) pertussis vaccine used (Pa instead of Pw), (ii) vaccine strategy (addition of adolescents and adults boosters), (iii) characteristics of the disease necessitating the development of new specific, sensitive and standardised biological diagnoses, (iv) bacteria circulating since herd immunity will be modified by universal immunisation and might have an impact on the properties of the agent of the disease.",

There is evidence of endemic circulation of rotavirus in adults that is independent from the winter epidemic cycle in children. In addition, adults exposed to children with rotavirus gastroenteritis are frequently infected and often come down with symptoms. Rotaviruses may also cause outbreaks in adults in closed communities and, particularly, in the elderly. Two live oral rotavirus vaccines have been licensed recently. These are: Rotarix TM (GSK), a human G1P[8] vaccine given in two doses, and RotaTeq TM (Merck & Co., Inc.), a human-bovine reassortant vaccine given in three doses. Both induce protection against severe rotavirus gastroenteritis caused by multiple serotypes of rotavirus, and neither protects against rotavirus infection. Both vaccines are being shed and might be rarely transmitted, but they do not remain in circulation. Vaccine induced protection will be sustained for a few years -enough to pass the most susceptible age for dehydration. However, both asymptomatic rotavirus infections and mild breakthrough cases of rotavirus gastroenteritis will occur in vaccinated children. Universal mass vaccination against rotavirus has been introduced in a number of countries, including USA, Brazil, Venezuela, Mexico, and, in Europe, Austria and Belgium. While both licensed rotavirus vaccines effectively protect the immunised individual, the long term consequences of mass vaccinations are uncertain and purely speculative. There is no evidence of herd immunity. As a result of vaccination, exposure of adults to wild type rotavirus gastroenteritis in children might result in waning immunity and actual increase in rotavirus gastroenteritis in adult populations. The prospect of immunising target populations of adults with rotavirus vaccines remains a distant possibility to be explored in the future.",

For example, in a low-level MRSA setting isolation facilities or staffing levels may be sufficient to allow all detected cases to be effectively and promptly isolated. In contrast, in high-level MRSA settings resource limitations (e.g. limited availability of isolation beds and insufficient staffing levels) can delay the time to effective isolation or make some interventions, such as nurse cohorting, entirely unfeasible. Under such circumstances an intervention that results in epidemic control in a setting with a low MRSA prevalence can fail in a high prevalence setting. Thus, two stable outcomes are possible even with identical control measures are in place. If interventions are put in place early enough they can successfully maintain infection at a low level preventing high-level MRSA becoming established. If put in place too late, or compromised by immigration of MRSA from other settings, identical interventions can have a much smaller effect, only slightly suppressing MRSA levels, and failing to reduce prevalence to a low level. Transitions between these two outcomes are known mathematically as catastrophes, and can also have catastrophic consequences for patient welfare. Simulation models have shown that both stochastic fluctuations, and immigration of MRSA cases from other settings can, in principle, lead to such catastrophic shifts from successful control to control failure. In this talk, the evidence that such catastrophic transitions also occur in practice will be reviewed, making use of new statistical developments for analysing hospital infection data and highly detailed MRSA transmission data.",

Another factor shown to be importance in E. faecalis IE is gelatinase, a protease produced by only~60% of E. faecalis despite the fact that the encoding gene gelE is found in over 90% of stains; deletion of part of the regulatory locus, fsr, explains the lack of gelatinase production by many strains. Aggregation substance, encoded by pheromone responsive plasmids found in some E. faecalis, and a cytolysin/hemolysin may influence the size of EIE vegetations and mortality produced by E. faecalis, respectively.

One of these HiRECC is E. faecium CC17, which represents a distinct pandemic clonal complex of extremely successful hospital acquired isolates. Also in E. faecalis specific genetic subpopulations exist, like CC2, CC9, and CC40, which are enriched among nosocomial isolates and as such can be classified as HiRECC. Thus E. faecalis and E. faecium isolates belonging to these HiRECC share niches with the potential of virulence gene exchange. The extent of genetic exchange, especially of virulence genes between these two species is unknown but can be disclosed by assessing the presence of orthologs in E. faecalis and E. faecium clinical isolates. Comparative genomic hybridisation and whole genome sequencing, implemented to identify genes specific for CC17, distinguished more than 100 genes with most notably CC17 specific IS elements, resistance genes, genes putatively encoding cell surface proteins and metabolic pathways. Of a subset of these E. faecium CC17 genes orthologous genes were identified among E. faecalis bloodstream isolates. Eight of these orthologs were highly similar to genes previously found on EfaB5, an E. faecalis Tn916-like element containing several genes related to virulence in other species. The sequence identity of EfaB5 orthologous genes between E. faecalis and E. faecium was >85%, which is considerably higher than the sequence identity of the core genomes of the two species, based on an in silico comparison and reflected by the relative high average of 16S rRNA sequence divergence (4.1%) and the low average nucleotide identity of housekeeping genes (74.2%). The E. faecium EfaB5-like orthologs, though highly similar to the E. faecalis EfaB5-like element, are not similarly organised in one cluster but separated by stretches of other genes and the order partially inverted. The presence of highly similar genes in HiRECC E. faecium CC17 and E. faecalis CC2, 9, and 40, suggests genetic exchange between the most prevalent clinical enterococcal subpopulations. A common EfaB5-like element, in addition to E. faecium and E. faecalis specific virulence determinants, might have contributed to pandemic spread and nosocomial enterococcal infections.",

While several new antibiotics have been introduced in the last decade, resistance against these new drugs is developing and spreading rapidly. Alternative treatment and prevention strategies are desperately needed to counter the rise of multiply resistant clones in hospitals and nursing homes worldwide. There is only a basic understanding of the mechanisms that are responsible for the transition of a normally benign commensal into a dangerous pathogen. A better understanding of the virulence factors that enable enterococci to access the bloodstream and cause systemic infections will help to target new therapeutic and prophylactic approaches. Compared to other Gram-positive pathogens, relatively little is know about surface antigens in enterococci that may be used as vaccine targets. Several proteins such as aggregation substance, ACE (adhesin to collagen), EfaA, an ABC transporter complex, and Esp have been studied, although only few data exist on the protective efficacy of these antigens in appropriate animal models. Newly identified pili in E. faecalis are associated with adhesion, biofilm formation and pathogenicity, and since these antigens are highly immunogenic antibodies against these structures may be promising candidates for immunotherapy. Several carbohydrate antigens have been identified in E. faecalis, while so far no information exists for E. faecium. Similar to other Grampositive bacteria, enterococci possess membrane-associated lipoteichoic acid (LTA) and peptidoglycan-associated wall teichoic acids (WTA). While LTA has been shown to be the target of protective antibodies for E. faecalis and E. faecium infections, no information exists for WTA. Additional capsular polysaccharide antigens consisting of a diheteroglycan have been identified in some E. faecalis strains and these antigens also elicit opsonic antibodies making them likely candidates for vaccine approaches. Taken together, there are several promising vaccine candidates among surface carbohydrate antigens, as well as among the protein antigens studied so far. Conjugation of a protein target to a carbohydrate component may enhance immunogenicity and broaden the coverage of such a vaccine. Knowledge of the clinical application, mode of vaccination (passive vs. active immunotherapy), timing of application and the identification of a patient population that will profit most needs to be acquired in order to develop a successful immunotherapy strategy.",

The initial scenario consisted of polyclonal enterococcal population with a high diversity of strains and transposable elements encoding vancomycin resistance in the community and with scarce presence in the nosocomial setting. In the last few years six European countries have reported prevalence rates in hospitals >20% and nosocomial VRE outbreaks are frequently described. Clonal and plasmid outbreaks have been documented in European hospitals but complex epidemiological situations involving strains (Enterococcus faecalis and/or Enterococcus faecium) and different mobile genetic elements are frequently reported in institutions with high VRE rates. Population genetics studies have shown that most VRE isolates from hospitalised patients belong to worldwide disseminated hospital high-risk clonal complexes (HHRCCs) of E. faecalis (CC2, CC9, CC21, CC87) and E. faecium (CC17) often resistant to multiple antibiotics, while VRE from non-hospitalised individuals or animals belong to other CCs. In addition, specific HHRCCs or clones within these HHRCCs become relevant in the persistence and dissemination of VRE. Horizontal transfer is also important in the recent spread of VRE in European hospitals although plasmid outbreaks have been described since early 90's. The most frequent type of acquired glycopeptide resistance found is VanA and the genes coding for resistance are part of Tn1546, usually located in conjugative plasmids. Variants of Tn1546 containing mutations, deletions and different insertion sequences have been described and an apparent high diversity and host specificity of these genetic elements has been suggested. However, the detection of different Tn1546 variants in common plasmids platforms suggests frequent genetic exchange events within particular wide disseminated plasmids. A change in the epidemiology of VRE in European hospitals seems to have occurred with the emergence and dissemination of specific plasmids and HHRCCs resistant to multiple antibiotics and possibly more transmissible and virulent.than others Situations of endemicity or polyclonal outbreaks are difficult to handle since limite therapeutic options and require genotyping-targeted infection containment. Detailed characterisation of epidemic VRE strains and mobile elements will help to understand the reasons involved in the evolutionary outcomes of HHRCC in different countries.",

In particular, it has been shown to provide promoter sequences enhancing expression of the natural cephalosporinase AmpC and oxacillinase OXA-51 of A. baumannii. In addition, two copies of ISAba1 bracketing blaOXA-23 may form composite transposon Tn2006 at the origin of acquisition of this carbapenem-hydrolysing oxacillinase gene. The transposase of ISAba1 is formed by two open reading frames Orf1 and Orf2 likely giving rise to a functional transposase when a frameshift occurs. Our study was aimed to evaluate the transposition ability of ISAba1. Methods: We evaluated experimentally the ability of ISAba1 to transpose in Escherichia coli. In a first step, the b-lactamase gene blaTEM-1 was inserted into ISAba1 to provide an ampicillin resistance marker allowing its tracing. This ISAba1::blaTEM-1 structure was cloned into pTOPO vector and then transformed into recA(\u2212) E. coli RZ201 harboring conjugative plasmid pOX38-Gen used as a target for transposition events. Transposition events onto pOX38-Gen were selected by conjugating this plasmid into azide-resistant E. coli J53. The same technique was used to evaluate the transposition ability of Tn2006. Also the role of the frameshift in the transposase expression was evaluated by eliminating the frameshift in the transposase encoding gene by site-directed mutagenesis. Results: Transposition of ISAba1 was obtained at a frequency of 1\u00d710 5 (\u00b10.7\u00d710 5 ) per E. coli donor. Sequencing of the target sites of transposition revealed i) a systematic 9-bp duplication upon transposition, and an adenine-rich hotspot of target transposition. Transposition frequency of the mutated ISAba1 with a transposase gene made of a unique frame was 2\u00d710 3 (\u00b10.2\u00d710 3 ). The mobility of Tn2006 was demonstrated and its frequency of transposition was estimated to be 1.6\u00d710 8 (\u00b12.5\u00d710 2 ). Conclusion: This study iss the very first demonstration of the functionality of the widespread ISAba1 as a mobile element. The frameshift-mediated down-regulation of transposition has been assessed, as well as the functionality of the ISAba1-made composite transposon. This in-vivo model will allow further experiments able to evaluate the possible selective factors such as antibiotics for ISAba1-transposition enhance",

The diversity of the intrinsic blaOXA-51-like genes may provide insights into the evolution of this species. This study aimed to examine the relationship between the sequences of the OXA-51-like enzyme family and the properties of a collection of A. baumannii isolates. Methods: Sixty A. baumannii isolates had their blaOXA-51-like gene amplified by PCR using external primers, and the products sequenced and identified using BLAST and MultAlin software. The external primers allowed the simultaneous identification of ISAba1 upstream of the blaOXA-51-like genes. MICs for imipenem and meropenem were determined according to British Society for Antimicrobial Chemotherapy (BSAC) guidelines. Isolates were assigned to sequence groups (SGs) based on PCR amplification of fragments of their blaOXA-51-like, ompA and csuE genes. All publicly available OXA-51-like amino-acid sequences were retrieved and used to construct a linkage map showing the relationships of the enzymes to one another. Results: The linkage map revealed that some of the enzymes form closely related clusters while others are less closely related. The largest number of isolates, including European clone II, contained enzymes in the OXA-66 cluster, and were assigned to SG1. The second largest group of isolates, including European clone I, contained enzymes in the OXA-69 cluster, and were assigned to SG2. The third largest isolate group, including European clone III, were assigned to SG3 and contained an OXA-71 enzyme. Eight isolates contained enzymes not found in a major cluster, or could not be assigned to a SG. ISAba1 was found upstream of the blaOXA-51-like gene in ten isolates, but was only associated with enzymes on branch tips in the OXA-66 and OXA-69 clusters. MICs for imipenem and meropenem ranged from 0.06 and 0.12 mg/L respectively up to >128 mg/L for both antibiotics. Isolates with ISAba1 upstream of the blaOXA-51-like gene tended to have MICs towards the higher end of this range, from 0.5 and 2 mg/L up to 8 and 32 mg/L. Conclusion: SG1 and SG2 represent the most prevalent epidemic lineages of A. baumannii and encode specific sub-sets of OXA-51-like enzymes. SG3 is not as prevalent, but is also associated with a specific OXA-51-like enzyme. A minority of isolates cannot be grouped using this typing scheme. Evolution of the OXA-51-like enzymes appears to be occurring in real time. Objectives: Acinetobacter baumannii (Ab) is a well recognised nosocomial pathogen, especially for critically-ill patients. The emergence of multi-drug resistant (MDR) and carbapenem-resistant Ab isolates constitutes a major therapeutic challenge. Outbreaks caused by MDR Ab are mostly reported from tropical or sub-tropical areas and from Mediterranean countries. Here we report the characterisation of OXA-23 producing Ab strains isolated in an acute Belgian hospital. Methods: All MDR Ab isolates recovered from patients and from the environment were phenotypically and genetically (PCR-sequencing and PFGE) characterised. Resistance patterns were analysed by disc diffusion and MICs determination. PCR-sequencing was performed for blaIMP, blaVIM, blaOXA-23-like, blaOXA-26-like, blaOXA-58 genes, blaOXA-51-like genes, blaTEM gene, blaOXA-20, and the chromosomal class C b-lactamase blaAmpC gene.

Five of the patients were hospitalised in the pneumology ward and 2 in the intensive care unit where the outbreak secondarily spread.

Detection of OXA-type carbapenemases was performed by multiplex PCR. For the case-control study cases defined as patients with the outbreak strain and controls defined as patients with a minimum duration of intensive care unit (ICU) stay of 5 days were selected from the mainly affected ICU during the outbreak period. Odds ratios (OR) were calculated in a univariate analysis and a multiple logistic regression analysis was performed to identify independent risk factors for acquisition of the outbreak strain. Results: 35 patients acquired carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii with a similar antibiogram in five ICUs and two wards of two different tertiary care hospitals within a time period of ten months in 2006. All but two isolates were resistant to all penicillins, cephalosporins, ciprofloxacin, gentamicin, tobramycin, imipenem, and meropenem, and remained susceptible only to colistin and tigecycline, i.e. isolates were pandrug-resistant. All isolates belonged to one major strain type with RAPD pattern a and pulsotype A with subtypes A1\u2212A4. All but two isolates belonging to subtypes A2 and A3 carried the OXA-23-like gene in addition to the intrinsic OXA-51-like gene. The most likely mode of transmission was cross-transmission from colonised or infected patients and the environment via the hands of personnel. The multiple logistic regression analysis showed that severity of illness (mean daily SAPS II score > median) and intensity of care (mean daily TISS-28 score > median) were independent risk factors for acquisition of the outbreak strain (OR 6.67; CI95 1.55\u221236.56 for both variables). Enhanced infection control measures with enforcement of standard precautions, education of personnel, cohorting of patients with the outbreak strain in separate ward areas and screening of ICU patients for A. baumannii on admission and once weekly were successful in controlling the outbreak.

            "text": "Background: Acinetobacter baumannii is an important opportunistic pathogen responsible of serious nosocomial infections. Multi-drug resistance is common, and carbapenems often remain among the few therapeutic options. Production of acquired OXA-type carbapenemases (Ambler class D) of the OXA-23, OXA-24/40 and OXA-58 lineages appears to be a major mechanism of acquired carbapenem resistance in A. baumannii. Here we report the first detection of a carbapenemresistant A. baumannii producing the OXA-24 carbapenemase in Italy. Methods: Bacterial identification was carried out with phenotypic and molecular approach. Susceptibility testing were carried out by broth microdilution and Etest. Genotyping was carried out by RAPD and typing of the blaOXA-51-like, csuE and ompA genes. OXA-type and metallo-carbapenemase determinants were investigated by PCR and sequencing. Results: Two carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii were isolated in 2000, at Varese University Hospital (northern Italy), from the BAL of two ICU-patients. The isolates differed from other carbapenem-resistant A. baumannii from the same hospital for a very high level of carbapenem resistance (imipenem and meropenem MICs, >32 mg/L). They were also resistant to expanded-spectrum cephalosporins, aminoglycosides (amikacin and gentamicin), ciprofloxacin, but susceptible to colistin. Characterisation of carbapenemase genes revealed the presence of a blaOXA-24 allele in both isolates. Genotyping showed that the two isolates were identical to each other and belonged to European clone II. They were also clonally related to other lower-level carbapenem-resistant isolates from the same hospital, which were found to produce OXA-58. The blaOXA-24 determinant was surrounded by a genetic context similar to a previously described plasmid-mediated blaOXA-24 determinant. Conclusions: To our best knowledge this is the first report of A. baumannii producing OXA-24 in Italy. The isolates, noticed for their exceedingly high level of carbapenem resistance, did not spread in the hospital. Interestingly, they were clonally related to the European clone II, which exhibits a remarkable propensity to evolve carbapenem resistance by different mechanisms.",

The aim of this work was to characterise the recently isolated strains of OXA-23-producing A. baumannii, some of them associated to outbreaks in Portuguese hospitals, and to investigate the clonal relatdness between them and the endemic OXA-40-producing clone Methods: Nineteen imipenem-resistant isolates of A. baumannii revovered from four Portuguese hospitals and an ambulatory patient between 2006 and 2007 were studied. Isolates were identified by API32GN and by sequencing the 16S rRNA gene. Susceptibility to antibiotics was tested by disk diffusion method and Vitek 2 system. MICs for tigecycline and colistin were determined by the agar dilution method. Oxacillinase genes (OXA-23, 40, 51, and 58) were sought by a multiplex PCR. ISAba1 insertion sequence upstream of blaOXA-23 gene was also searched by PCR. PFGE (ApaI) was performed for comparison of these isolates with the endemic clone.",

The isolates involved in hospital outbreaks were mostly susceptible to aminoglicosides, being one susceptible only to amikacin and another one resistant to all antibiotics. PCR assays detected the presence of blaOXA-23. ISAba1 was detected upstream of the OXA-23 gene for all isolates except one. PFGE showed that the isolates' profile was related with the imipenem-resistant A. baumannii clones disseminated throughout the country, including the endemic OXA-40 producing A. baumannii clone. Conclusions: Emergence of OXA-23 producing A. baumannii is occurring in several Portuguese hospitals associated to outbreaks and sporadic cases. Of interest is the relatdness with the endemic OXA-40 clone, although with an enlarged resistance profile, which supports the plasmidic acquisition of these two oxacillinases by a well adapted A. baumannii clone. It is of note the recovery of an OXA-23 producer from an ambulatory patient which can further promote community dissemination. Objectives: Up-regulation of the RND-type efflux system AdeABC has been implicated in reduced susceptibility to tigecycline in A. baumannii. AdeABC expression is controlled by the two-component regulatory system AdeRS. We investigated the role of this pump in the emergence of tigecycline resistance using a pre-and post-treatment pair of clinical isolates. Methods: Isolates were identified by API20NE profile, and susceptibilities were first determined by BSAC disc methodology, then by agar dilution and Etest on IsoSensitest agar. PFGE was used to determine relatedness. Expression of the efflux pump, AdeABC, and its regulatory proteins, AdeRS, was examined by real-time reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR using primers specific for adeB and adeR, respectively, and quantified relative to the RNA polymerase beta subunit gene, rpoB, which was used as a reference.",

            "text": "The two A. baumannii isolates were recovered from abdominal drain fluid of a 38-yr old woman who had undergone a cholecystectomy. Inter alia she had received a 14-day course of tigecycline, and a 32fold difference in susceptibility was observed between pre-and posttreatment isolates (MICs, 0.5 mg/L and 16 mg/L, respectively). The patient has since made a full recovery. The isolates had identical PFGE profiles and belonged to a prevalent UK strain, OXA-23 clone 1, with OXA-23 carbapenemase and initial susceptibility only to tigecycline and polymyxin. Real-time RT-PCR identified a 24-fold increase in adeB gene expression in the post-treatment isolate. No concomitant difference in adeR expression was observed. Conclusions: OXA-23 clone 1 is a widespread multi-resistant lineage and we report here the emergence of resistance to tigecycline during therapy in a representative. This resistance was associated with increased expression of the AdeABC efflux system, but not with altered expression of its known regulatory genes adeRS. This suggests that there may be 'cross-talk' between adeABC and other trans-acting regulatory factors. Objective: In 2003, a significant increase of Acinetobacter resistance to carbapenems has been noted in the Czech Republic. The aim of this study was to assess the prevalence and epidemiology of this resistance among hospital strains of Acinetobacter spp. Methods: Isolates were collected prospectively via a network of diagnostic laboratories between January 2005 and April 2006. The laboratories were asked to send clinical isolates of Acinetobacter spp. from intensive care units (ICUs), with no more than one isolate per patient and 10 isolates per ICU. The isolates were identified to species by AFLP and assessed for relatedness using AFLP and PFGE. Susceptibility to 12 antimicrobial agents primarily effective against A. baumannii was tested by disk diffusion, and MICs were determined for carbapenems. Results: A total of 150 Acinetobacter isolates were obtained from 56 ICUs of 20 hospitals in 15 cities. They were identified as A. baumannii (n = 108), genomic sp. 3 (n = 30), genomic sp. 13 TU (n = 8) or other species (n = 4). Using AFLP cluster analysis, A. baumannii isolates were allocated to EU clone II (n = 66), EU clone I (n = 5), 6 clusters with 2\u22125 isolates (n = 15) or 22 unique genotypes. Nearly all clone II isolates yielded identical or highly similar PFGE and AFLP patterns. A total of 24 (16%) isolates were resistant to at least one carbapenem. Seventy isolates were susceptible to all antimicrobials while 7 isolates showed resistance to 1\u22123 agents and 73 isolates were resistant to >3 agents. Resistance to >3 agents and/or carbapenem MICs >1 mg/l were found only in the EU clones and four unique strains while resistance to one or two carbapenems (MIC >8 mg/l) was confined to EU clone II. The 66 EU clone II isolates originated from 37 ICUs in 12 cities and showed the following susceptibility rates: piperacillin (0%), ceftazidime (5%), ampicillin-sulbactam (23%), imipenem (71%), meropenem (67%), gentamicin (15%), tobramycin (97%), amikacin (61%), netilmicin (52%), ofloxacin (0%), doxycycline (0%), co-trimoxazole (12%).",

The high genotypic similarity of the isolates suggests that they represent a recent subgroup within this clone. Supported by grant NR8554\u22123 of the Ministry of Health of the Czech Republic. Objectives: A more detailed characterisation of the immune response to Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) antigens would provide new insights into the complex host-parasite interactions that take place in the course of tuberculosis (TB) and offer new tools for a more accurate diagnosis of the different stages that characterise TB as a disease. Methods: Here we measured CD4 and CD8 T-cell responses to Bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin (BCG), purified protein derivative (PPD), early secretory antigenic target-6 (ESAT-6) protein and culture filtrate protein-10 kDa (CFP-10), measured as interferon (IFN)-gamma and interleukin (IL)-2 release, using the flow cytometric cells-secreting cytokine detection technique on peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) obtained from active TB patients, latently Mtb infected individuals, patients with pulmonary diseases different from TB and healthy donors. IL-10 and IL-17 were also measured to test their possible role as indicators of disease activity. Results: We confirmed that the enumeration of IFN-gamma releasing cells upon Mtb-specific stimulation is sufficient to identify TB patients and that CD8 T cells contribute to the specificity of the response. IL-2 secreting cells were more frequently observed in latent TB infected individuals than in active TB patients, suggesting that measurement of cells secreting this cytokine could be a marker of disease stages. No discriminating role was associated to IL-10 and IL-17 release in TB patients. Conclusions: Together, data indicate that the flow cytometric cytokinesecreting cell detection technique is a powerful tool for TB diagnosis which allows the analysis of the immune response to Mtb-related antigens in the different stages of TB.",

Based on ROC curve analysis we established two IP-10 cutoff points and constructed a diagnostic test algorithm inspired by the QFT-IT test; with positive, negative, and indeterminate test outcome. Results: TB patients produced significantly higher levels of IP-10 and IFN-g compared with controls: for IFN-g median 215 pg/ml (IQR 22-651 pg/ml) vs. 0 pg/ml (IQR 0\u22120 pg/ml), for IP-10 median 2158 pg/ml (IQR 582-5882 pg/ml) vs. 37 pg/ml (IQR 13\u221299 pg/ml. IP-10 and IFN-g responses were highly correlated (0.81, p < 0.0001). Based on ROC curve analysis we selected a sensitive IP-10 cut-off (237 pg/ml), and a specific cut-off (673 pg/ml). A cut off for indeterminate test was established by comparing the mitogen IP-10/IFN-g ratio. QFT-IT and the specific IP-10 test showed comparable performance with equal sensitivity/specificity and 90% agreement (kappa 0.79), table 1. The sensitive IP-10 test had a higher sensitivity 71/80 (90%), but also a high degree of positive responders among the controls 14/124 (11%), primarily among the older teachers (10/14) Discussion: IP-10 is expressed in response to the RD1 antigens in consistent and significant higher levels than IFN-g. IP-10 has properties that enable the development of diagnostic test algorithm with positive, negative and indeterminate outcomes, performing with excellent concordance and comparable or even superior discriminatory power compared with the QFT-IT. As IP-10 is expressed in high amounts, it holds promise for the development of a new generation of more sensitive TB tests with simpler and potentially field-friendly read out formats, such as the lateral flow dipstick. The CAS family was the most prevalent in the study population (24.7%) followed by the T, EAI, and LAM families comprising 16.4%; 15.9%, and 15.5% of total isolates respectively; CAS and EAI strains were dominant in patients born in the Indian subcontinent, East Africa and South-East Asia, and LAM and T families were more common in patients born in Europe, UK and other parts of the world. Analysis of allelic diversity within certain loci in combination with results of spoligotyping and deletion mapping allowed the selection of loci of greater phylogenetical relevance (MIRU4, 24, 26, ETR-A, -B, -C) and propose VNTR codes (combinations of allelic variants) which can be potentially used for identification of families, major lineages and species within MTBC.",

Material and Method: All patients with documented MDR-TB based on drug susceptibility tests (DST) are treated with the standard secondline regimen, consisting of cycloserine, prothionamide, amikacin, and ofloxacin since 2002 in Iran. After performance of second line drug susceptibility in 2006, all XDR-TB cases were identified and treatment outcome was extracted from their medical records. Results: Between 2002-2006, 105 patients with MDR-TB were identified at Masih Daneshvari Hospital in Tehran, Iran. Of those patients, seven (6.6%) were diagnosed with XDR-TB. Four (57.1%) patients were male and three (42.9%) were female. All seven patients were HIV-negative.

Background: Current methods for the detection and determination of drug resistance of Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MTB) are insensitive and slow. PCR is a more accurate and rapid technique, but requires substantial labour and technical competence. PCR is also affected by inhibitors, sample cross-contamination, and limited ability to concentrate samples. All of these limitations are overcome by the GeneXpert \u00ae system. This automated system uses a low-cost plastic cartridge to concentrate all the bacilli present in a sputum sample, remove inhibitors, lyse cells, and transfer the DNA into an integrated PCR tube. This DNA is amplified in a nested, real-time PCR using an optimised, six-colour Molecular Beacon assay to detect more than 95% of all rifampin-resistant TB strains. An internal sample processing and reagent control is also included. Sample processing and nested PCR occur within the same cartridge and no external manipulation is required after the sample is initially loaded. Objectives: To comprehensively evaluate the GeneXpert MTB assay using sputum and sputum pellet samples and simultaneously detect rifampin resistance-associated mutations in the rpoB core region.

The increased prevalence of risk factors for these infections over the past two decades have dramatically increased their incidence during that period. These infections are frequently severe, with a crude mortality rate of 38%. The nature of systemic Candida infections appears to be changing. Until recently, the majority of infections were caused by Candida albicans, but this species is becoming less common as non-albicans Candida species begin to proliferate, particularly in certain patient types. In a recent survey of the epidemiological and mycological profile of Candida species in Europe, while Candida albicans was still the most common cause of infection overall, 43.6% of infections were caused by nonalbicans Candida species [1] . Furthermore, in surgical patients and those with solid tumours, and in patients aged 70 years, the prevalence of C. glabrata approached 20% (see Table) [1]. The significance of these changes in Candida epidemiology may be profound, since non-albicans Candida species seem to be associated with an increased risk of mortality compared with C. albicans (C. krusei: 55.3%; C. glabrata: 45.0%; C. tropicalis: 41.4%; C. albicans: 38.5%). However, these differences may be explained by the increased prevalence of these species in patients with more severe underlying illness [2] . While isolates of C. albicans are generally susceptible to most antifungal agents, non-albicans Candida species, particularly C. glabrata and C. krusei, are often non-susceptible to older agents, such as fluconazole [3] . This has important implications for the selection of appropriate antifungal therapy in patients with systemic Candida infections.",

Over recent decades, an increasing proportion of candidaemia cases involve species not fully susceptible to fluconazole (mainly C. glabrata and C. krusei) [1, 2] . Furthermore, although Candida isolates with acquired azole resistance are still observed only sporadically, recent studies have documented the increased emergence of C. glabrata isolates against which voriconazole has elevated MICs.2 Conversely, amphotericin B and the echinocandins (anidulafungin, caspofungin and micafungin) are potent and cidal in vitro against isolates of the major Candida spp., including C. glabrata, although slightly higher MICs have been observed for the echinocandins against the less virulent species C. parapsilosis (see Table) [3] . While in vitro activity alone is a useful measure of potency, susceptibility data can be applied further to the development of susceptibility breakpoints. Studies examining the correlation between PK/PD, MICs and clinical success rates have resulted in the establishment of breakpoints for fluconazole against Candida spp. of 2 microg/ml by EUCAST and 8 microg/ml by CLSI. CLSI have suggested further breakpoints of 1 microg/ml and 2 microg/ml for voriconazole and the echinocandins, respectively. However, in a recent large population-based survey, including 410 micafungin-treated patients, a lower susceptibility breakpoint for micafungin of 1 microg/ml was suggested [4] . As clinical experience is still very limited regarding isolates with MICs above the normal range predicted by the species identification, further studies are warranted.",

But, as so often occurs in the battle between man and microbe, victory proved illusory, and resistance is now widespread. This has serious clinical implications, because inadequate treatment, owing to resistance, correlates with increased mortality among seriously ill patients. Recent critical shifts in Europe and elsewhere include a huge increase of quinolone resistance in Enterobacteriaceae, particularly Escherichia coli, where rates among bacteraemia isolates mostly now exceed 25%. Cephalosporin resistance has increased too, largely via the spread of plasmids, encoding extended-spectrum b-lactamases (ESBLs). Until 2000, most ESBLs in Europe were mutants of the old TEM or SHV penicillinases and largely occurred in nosocomial Klebsiella spp. Subsequently \"CTX-M\" ESBLs have spread extensively, becoming frequent in E. coli as well as Klebsiella spp. Producers cause infections in \"complicated community\" patients as well as those in hospitals. The predominant CTX-M types and the clonality of their producers vary among countries, but their \"takeover\" is remarkably consistent. Many producers are resistant to all antibiotics except carbapenems, fosfomycin, and nitrofurantoin. This accumulation of cephalosporin and quinolone resistance is driving use of carbapenems. These largely evade ESBLs and AmpC enzymes, although resistance can arise if a strain with one of these enzymes is unusually impermeable. At present, true acquired carbapenemases remain rare in most species, but there are disturbing pointers to their future spread. First, Acinetobacter baumannii clones with OXA carbapenemases are already prevalent in intensive care units (ICUs) worldwide. Secondly, Klebsiella clones with KPC carbapenemases are spreading in the United States, with a few reports from Europe. Thirdly, there is a growing scatter of Enterobacteriaceae and non-fermenters with IMP and VIM metallo-b-lactamases, particularly in Greece and Italy.",

Ventilatorassociated pneumonia (VAP) is also associated with increased mortality, increased length of stay, and need for continued mechanical ventilation, and therefore, presents its own unique management challenges. Key pathogens associated with nosocomial pneumonias include meticillinresistant Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, and Acinetobacter baumannii. Effective management involves accurate diagnosis, timely selection of initial appropriate antibiotics at effective doses and administration routes, and implementation of optimal prevention strategies. Due to variability of offending organisms within different treatment settings, initial therapy for HAP and VAP should be individualised. Selection of broad-spectrum agents should be based on many variables, including patient risk factors (eg, recent antibiotic exposure, comorbidities, duration of hospitalisation), suspected pathogens, pharmacokinetic considerations, and resistance dynamics. Following 48 to 72 hours of therapy, the patient should be assessed for deescalation strategies based on clinical response and laboratory tests. Dosing flexibility in patients with VAP or severe sepsis is crucial to ensuring optimal resolution. Recent clinical trials suggest that doripenem might provide additional value for therapy of HAP, including VAP. A multidisciplinary approach with implementation of pan-European guidelines for HAP based on care bundles should be viewed as an opportunity to optimise management of HAP in Europe.",

Unfortunately, the immune immaturity that is responsible for their increased vulnerability to infections also limits vaccine responses. This major challenge is being addressed, and information is rapidly accumulating on the mechanisms that limit vaccine responses in early life and potential circumventing strategies. The recognition of limited B cell responses to bacterial polysaccharides led to the development of conjugate vaccine which had a major impact in preventing infant disease by encapsulated bacteria. However, even potent conjugate or protein vaccines require multiple vaccine doses to overcome immune immaturity when given early in life, an issue which limits their introduction in many countries of the world. The limitations of infant B cell responses result not only from the interference by antibodies of maternal origin but also from the weaker induction of antibody-secreting plasma cells within Germinal Centres, which has emerged as a generic determinant of the magnitude of early life antibody responses and calls for the development of specific adjuvant or formulations. Importantly, infant antibody responses are also of much shorter duration than those elicited later in life, which may result into secondary vaccine failure. In infant mice, this rapid decline of vaccine-induced antibodies results from the failure of bone marrow niches to efficiently support plasma cell survival through the production of sufficient level of APRIL, a limiting factor that is unlikely to be easily circumvented and calls for the administration of early booster doses. In contrast to the limitations of antibody-secreting-cells, the induction of memory B cells may be readily elicited already in the neonatal period. This understanding led to clinical studies in which human neonates received a first dose of pertussis vaccine in their first week of life. Markedly enhanced responses to subsequent vaccine doses were observed in certain studies, whereas others were confronted to the issue of vaccine interference. Numerous questions therefore remain open, including the relative magnitude and persistence of vaccine memory elicited early or later in life.",

At last, evidence regarding effective infection control processes of care is being translated into practice. Progress has been facilitated by: 1) application of principles of reliability science (in which failures to adhere to best practice are regarded as \"defects\" in care); 2) development of concise \"bundles\" of evidence-based practices (culled from exhaustive and somewhat cumbersome guidelines); 3) application of an \"execution framework\" (including clear aims supported by leadership, multi-disciplinary teams employing quality improvement methods at the bedside in clinical microsystems, clear measures of outcomes and success, and a parsimonious set of \"drivers\" required to achieve these outcomes); and 4) advances in technology. These principles can be illustrated by examining methods used to reduce major nosocomial infection problems, such as MRSA, catheter-associated bloodstream infection, and ventilator-associated pneumonia.

The first surveys in natural bacterial populations, conducted in E. coli and Salmonella spp., revealed a higher than expected prevalence of mutators (around 1%), supporting the hypothesis that hypermutation could act as a mechanism for acceleration of bacterial evolution in nature. Nevertheless, the first evidence for a specific role of hypermutation in human infections was obtained from the study of P. aeruginosa chronic lung infection in cystic fibrosis (CF) patients, in which the prevalence of hypermutable strains was by far the highest ever found in nature. Subsequent studies have demonstrated that hypermutation is indeed a common feature of P. aeruginosa chronic respiratory infections occurring in patients with chronic underlying respiratory diseases such as CF, bronchiectasis, or COPD with a prevalence ranging from 30 to 60% of the patients, whereas the prevalence of mutator strains is very low (<1%) in acute infections. A high prevalence of mutators in the CF setting was also found later for other pathogens such as S. aureus and H. influenzae. Results from recent studies, involving mouse models of chronic infection and long-term longitudinal studies of CF isolates, have shown that hypermutation indeed plays a relevant role in two major aspects of P. aeruginosa chronic respiratory infections: bacterial adaptation for long-term persistence of infections and antimicrobial resistance development. The molecular basis of hypermutation are defects in genes involved in DNA repair or error avoidance system which have been deeply studied in E. coli. Among them, the gene coding for the Epsilon subunit of the DNA polymerase III (dnaQ or mutD), the genes involved in the Mismatch Repair (MMR) System, mutS, mutL, mutH, and UvrD (mutU) or the genes belonging to the GO system for DNA oxidative lesion repair, mutT, mutM and mutY. In CF P. aeruginosa strains, as well as in other natural bacterial populations, the most frequent mechanism leading to hypermutation is the inactivation of the MMR System, that along with mutation rates, increases also by 1000-fold the rates of recombination between divergent DNA sequences.",

Therefore bacteria exhibiting elevated mutation frequencies, known as mutators or hypermutators, may have a selective advantage when exposed to antibiotics in the clinical setting. Naturally occurring hypermutators have been described in a number of pathogenic Gram-negative species. They appear to be particularly prominent in isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa from cystic fibrosis patients and the possible molecular basis for their selection in this environment will be discussed. Although S. aureus hypermutators, deficient in the methyl-directed mismatch repair (MMR) system have been created in the laboratory (e.g. mutS and mutL mutants), the occurrence of staphylococcal hypermutators in the clinical setting appears to be variable, with some groups reporting their presence and others not. Furthermore, a S. aureus mutL mutant has recently been reported to exhibit decreased fitness in a model of chronic bone infection and there is no evidence that intermediate susceptibility to vancomycin in clinical isolates of S. aureus (VISA) evolves in hypermutable hosts, despite the fact that resistance to vancomycin in these strains probably requires multiple mutations in chromosomal genes. Therefore hypermutation may not play a major role in the development of antibiotic resistance in S. aureus. Possible reasons for this situation will be discussed.

Amaral (Lisbon, PT) Objectives: The emergence of Multi-Drug Resistant and Extensively-Drug Resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis (MDRTB/XDRTB) represents a major threat to public health worldwide, as many of these resistant strains are untreatable with available drugs. In order to control these infections, there is the need for new and non-toxic antimicrobial compounds. Phenothiazines have been shown to have direct and indirect activities against a large gamut of bacteria and may be considered for the therapy of these infections. We have demonstrated with previous studies that Thioridazine (TZ) enhances the killing of MDRTB phagocytosed by human monocyte-derived macrophages. However, the mechanism by which this agent enhances the killing of intracellular bacteria is not fully understood. The killing activity of some phagocytic cells, such as the neutrophils have been demonstrated to be correlated with the K+ availability which is dependent upon transport processes affected by agents that inhibit Ca2+-activated K+ pumps. In order to clarify the mechanism by which TZ enhances the killing activity of infected macrophages, we have studied the activity of TZ, twenty-two TZ derivatives, ouabain, reserpine and verapamil (other known inhibitors of K+ and Ca2+ transport) against intracellular bacteria. Methods: Ex vivo studies were conducted using human monocytederived macrophages infected with MDRTB and subsequently treated with TZ, its derivatives and other inhibitors of K+ and Ca2+ transport. Animal studies were conducted using BALB/c mice infected with M. tuberculosis and daily treated with different doses of TZ. The bacterial load in the lungs was monthly assessed by CFU counting. Results: Each of these compounds enhanced the killing of intracellular MDRTB ex vivo and TZ showed a significant effect in the mouse curing of the M. tuberculosis infection. Conclusion: Because each of these compounds also inhibit Ca2+ and K+ transport processes, enhanced killing is postulated to be due to the inhibition of Ca2+ and K+ transport, processes which when inhibited promote the activation of hydrolases and subsequent killing of intracellular bacteria. A model that provides the sequence of events that lead to killing of intracellular bacteria by non-killing human macrophages will be presented in detail and related to the curing of BALB/c mice infected with M. tuberculosis by administration of TZ at dose and interval equivalent to that employed for the therapy of psychosis.",

We hypothesised that daptomycin therapy of soft tissue infections caused by CA-MRSA would be associated with a blunted host inflammatory response and result in less severe soft tissue lesions and less dermonecrosis. Methods: We injected groups of 10 Charles River hairless (immunocompetent) mice in the right upper thigh muscle with 5\u00d710 7 -1\u00d710 9 cfu of three different clinical isolates of CA-MRSA. Two USA300 isolates were employed: 6U24, a previously-studied clinical isolate from a paediatric patient in Memphis with osteomyelitis and bacteraemia; and LAC, a well-characterised California isolate. One USA 400 isolate was usedthe well-characterised Minnesota strain, MW2. After inoculation, we initiated antibiotic treatment (either DAP or VAN) at either 18 hours or 40 hours after bacterial inoculation. All animals were observed daily and lesion size and character were recorded. Results: Mice injected with the higher inoculum (10 9 cfu) of either of the two USA300 isolates (6U24 or LAC) -but not the USA400 isolate, MW2 -consistently developed large soft tissue lesions with dermonecrosis.

Gal\u00e1n (Madrid, Valencia, ES) Objectives: To define the different mutational pathways driving the diversification of blaCTX-M-1-like genes, and to establish a hypothetical evolutionary scenario among CTX-M-1-cluster enzymes. Methods: All known CTX-M-1-like sequences were aligned using clustalW. MODELTEST programme was used to establish the best model of DNA substitution and parameters for phylogenetic reconstruction. Maximum likelihood trees were estimated with PhymL. The obtained consensus tree was used to reconstruct the most likely ancestral sequence by Mesquite software. Changes in positions 77, 114, 140, 167, 240 and 288 were considered as they are frequently found among CTX-M-1-like enzymes. As distinct phenotypic profiles might be observed depending on the allelic background (epistasis), 30 combinations of mutations on these positions were constructed by site-directed mutagenesis using blaCTX-M-3 as template DNA. blaCTX-M mutants were cloned in pBGS18 plasmid and transformed into E. coli MI1443 (delta-ampC). Cefotaxime (CTX), ceftazidime (CAZ), and cefepime (FEP) MICs were determined by E-test. Results: Phylogenetic reconstruction analysis predicted that CTX-M-3 might be the ancestor of all CTX-M-1-like enzymes, except of CTX-M-10, -34, -37 and -53. The branch-site model indicated a strong positive selection in CTX-M-3 sub-branch, with five positions (A77V, N114D, P167S, D240G and D288N) being implicated. Four of these mutations (A77V, N114D, P167S, and D288N) were required in successive steps to obtain CTX-M-58, which showed the highest CAZ MIC (256 mg/mL). Distinct evolutionary pathways to obtain CTX-M-58 are possible. Moreover, A140S change (also present in CTX-M-58) was highly beneficial to the CAZ/CTX resistance phenotype when introduced in the last step, although its presence in intermediate mutants yielded a neutral or even deleterious effect (sign epistasis). In evolutionary routes involving D240G change, lower increases in MIC values than those observed among P167S route were observed, being the presence of both changes in the same background selectively inaccessible. This result would suggest that the fitness landscape in CTX-M-1 cluster is twopeaked. Conclusions: All aminoacid changes associated with positive selection by bioinformatics tools contributed to favourable resistance phenotypes in specific contexts. Different evolutionary paths leading to more efficient enzymes have been identified, indicating a rugged fitness landscape for CTX-M-1-like enzymes. (85Kb), while the plasmid with RFLP pattern J showed two replicons (RepFII+RepFIA) and its size was 100 Kb. Only plasmid belonging to pattern A is epidemic in our environment (highly related to pC15\u22121a). The plasmids were transformed in two Escherichia coli isogenic strains, REL606(ara\u2212) and REL607(ara+). Competition experiments were performed in Davis minimal (DM) broth supplemented with glucose during seven days. Each day 50 mcl from coculture were inoculated into 20mL of fresh DM and another sample was spread onto MacConkey plates with arabinose to estimate the relative fitness (W) of each plasmid alone and between them (in this case 1 mg/L cefotaxime was added to plates). The values expressed the mean of six independent experiments. The magnitude of the fitness difference corresponds to how much more slowly one strain grew relative to the other during the course of the experiments. Results: Strains harbouring the epidemic plasmid (pattern A) yielded a growth rate 9% slower than its parental strain (W=0.91\u00b10.09). On the contrary, strains harbouring the non-epidemic plasmids (pattern M and J) showed higher cost than epidemic plasmid, growing 16% and 17% slower than its parental strain (W=0.84\u00b10.08 and W=0.82\u00b10.02) respectively. However, in competition assay between isogenic strains harbouring epidemic (pattern A) and non-epidemic plasmid (pattern M), the relative fitness was next to 1. The competition assay between strains harbouring plasmids belonging to pattern A and J showed a slight advantage ( 10%) for the plasmid carrying two replicons (W=1.09\u00b10.10), although this advantage was detected after five days of competition. Conclusion: The epidemic plasmid show higher fitness, which might facilitate its dissemination. Although other posibilities can not be excluded, the presence of plasmids with multireplicons could give even more advantage in stable environments.",

As expected, mean relative fitness decreased as a function of addition of the first three resistance mutations (1; 0.95; 0.89; 0.8). However, the downward trend was reversed by the addition of 4th and 5th mutations (0.8; 0.87; 0.9). We identified 6 strains in which an additional resistance mutation increased both resistance and fitness. These strains were deconstructed and reconstructed to confirm the relationship between the resistance mutations present and the resulting fitness/resistance phenotype. We also evolved strains for increased fitness in the absence of drug and observed the selection of variants with decreased susceptibility to fluoroquinolones. Conclusions: Bacteria can use different strategies to minimize the fitness costs of the genetic alterations selected for drug resistance. Two of these are well documented: the selection of low-cost mutations, and the selection of additional fitness compensating mutations. Here we identify a third strategy that reduces the fitness costs of resistance to fluoroquinolones: particular resistance mutations, when in combination, increase both resistance level and bacterial fitness. This relationship between drug-resistance mutations and improved bacterial fitness could be one force driving the evolution of fluoroquinolone resistance. An important implication is that strains carrying low level resistance mutations could evolve by Darwinian selection to higher levels of resistance, in the absence of direct selection by the drug. ",

Genomics of resistance plasmids isolated from WWTP bacteria revealed a high diversity of plasmid replicons and accessory genetic modules carrying resistance genes. Five of the completely sequenced plasmids confer resistance to macrolides and other antimicrobial compounds. Two of these plasmids, namely pB4 and pRSB111, belong to the IncP-1 incompatibility group combining very promiscuous, self-transmissible broad-host-range plasmids. The pB4 tripartite multidrug efflux system consisting of a permease of the resistance-nodulation-division (RND) family, a periplasmic membrane fusion protein (MFP) and an outer membrane factor (OMF) confers resistance to erythromycin and roxithromycin. Plasmid pRSB111 encodes a macrolide phosphotransferase and a transmembrane transport protein that are both required for high-level macrolide resistance. Different variants of these enzymes are also encoded on the mobilisable multidrug resistance plasmid pRSB101 and the IncF-like plasmid pRSB107 which also contains virulenceassociated modules. Finally, the IncP-6 erythromycin resistance plasmid pRSB105 harbours the resistance genes mel and mph, encoding, respectively, a predicted ABC-type efflux permease and a macrolide-2'-phosphotransferase. Many more macrolide resistance genes could be detected in plasmid-DNA preparations from WWTP bacteria by hybridisation experiments using a resistance gene microarray representing 192 different resistance genes. Among these are different ere genes encoding erythromycin esterases, erm genes for rRNA adenin N-6-methyltransferases and mef genes specifying macrolide efflux proteins.",

Four molecular classes of b-lactamases do exist, and they possess variable hydrolysis spectra, including penicillinases, expanded-spectrum b-lactamases, and carbapenemases. Some clinically-relevant species produce naturally b-lactamases (i.e. SHV in Klebsiella pneumoniae), but most natural producers are non pathogens. Some of these natural producers have been demonstrated to be the source of b-lactamase genes known to have spread in other species and thus at the origin of acquired resistance to b-lactams. Kluyvera spp. are good examples since those environmental species possess naturally on their chromosome those CTX-M-like encoding genes now emerging worldwide in Enterobacteriaceae. Another example is Acinetobacter radioresistens being the progenitor of the carbapenemase OXA-23encoding gene known to be at the origin of carbapenem resistance in Acinetobacter baumannii worldwide. Also possible is to observe some environmental species as intermediate reservoirs in dissemination of plasmid-mediated b-lactamase genes from their progenitor to the clinically-relevant species. The identification of the IMI-2 carbapenemase encoding gene on plasmids in Enterobacter asburiae strains from different US rivers is a good example of such threat. The identification of some plamids harboring b-lactamase genes from waste-water treatment plants, sewages or sludges is also of concern. The role of genetic structures like insertion sequences, transposons, and integrons in the mobilisation of those b-lactamase genes from environmental bacteria to clinical ones seems crucial, as well as that of plasmids and phages in their diffusion.

The talk will discuss advantages and disadvantages of the different strategies in order to stimulate further discussion. Methods: Retrospective case description study among patients with serologically confirmed PUUV infections and a seroprevalence study in a high-risk population of 140 orienteers living and training on the island of Funen. The study period was 1996-2007. Results: Serologically verified PUUV infection was found in 128 patients. Mean age 40 years (9\u221270y), with a male/female ratio 2.4/1. Dominant initial symptoms were acute onset of fever, abdominal and lower-back pain, while blurred vision was rare. 7% of patients required dialysis. NE cases were found distributed throughout the whole year but with the highest number of cases in November-February. Marked regional difference within Funen was found with most cases occurring in rural parts of southern and South-eastern Funnel. Cyclic variation in the annual number of NE cases was seen with a periodicity of 3 years. Among orienteers 7% were seropositive, but none had a history of NE. Conclusions: Our findings indicate that the clinical manifestations of PUUV infections in Denmark are similar to what has been described from Fennoscandinavia. A significant number of infections may be asymptomatic. The distribution of NE remains mainly focal and limited to a part of Funen. Further studies to clarify the ecological factors responsible for PUUV distribution are needed to enable better risk evaluation.",

Positive specimens were partially subtyped using the monoplex real-time PCRs to identify stx1, stx1c, stx1d, stx2f, and the group containing stx2, stx2c, stx2d, stx2e, and stx2g (stx2cdeg). Isolation of STEC strains was performed from stx2f positive specimens by culture on sorbitol MacConkey agar and colony screening by PCR. Results: A total of 37 specimens showed STEC specific amplification signals. Subtyping was successful in 35 of 37 specimens, and revealed stx2f (n = 4) as the third most prevalent genotype after stx2cdeg (n = 13) and stx1 (n = 6). Other genotypes detected included stx1 + stx1c (n = 2), stx1c (n = 2), stx1 + stx2cdeg (n = 1), and stx1/stx1c + stx2cdeg (n = 1). Patients positive for stx2f had uncomplicated diarrhoea (n = 2) and bloody diarrhoea (BD) (n = 2), although the BD could also be explained by co-infection/morbidity these patients. Isolation of an STEC strain was successful in 2/4 stx2f-positive specimens, and yielded an O63:H6 serotype, eae gene (intimin) positive in both cases. Both strains were also shown to be highly related based on pulsed field gel electrophoresis, although no epidemiological link was apparent between both patients. Conclusions: STEC that carry the stx2f gene were the third most prevalent stx-genotype in The Netherlands during the study. Our results suggest that stx2f-carrying STEC may be an overlooked cause of diarrhoea. Diagnostic screening strategies need to be adapted to detect this variant in the routine diagnostic laboratory.",

To our knowledge, SCV are not yet described in enterococci. We discovered SCV of Enterococcus faecalis in blood cultures of a patient with aortic valve endocarditis and characterised the structural particularities of the phenotype. Case report and results: A 74-year old female patient who underwent aortic valve replacement with a bovine bioprothesis three years ago presented to the emergency department with persistent fatigue. By transoesophageal echocardiography vegetations on the aortic valve were documented. In two out of two blood cultures E. faecalis susceptible to ampicillin and imipenem, and intermediate susceptible to rifampicin was grown. In addition to typical E. faecalis colonies, a SCV phenotype consisting of small pin-point colonies was detected in both blood cultures. Typing by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis revealed clonal identity of both phenotypes. Antimicrobial susceptibility as tested on blood-containing Mueller-Hinton agar was comparable. In order to characterise the SCV further we performed light, scanning electron microscopy (SEM), and transmission EM (TEM) of both phenotypes.",

In addition, debris covered SCV isolates and an intercellular substance was more abundant in SCV than in the normal phenotype. By TEM, multiple and irregular cross walls, large swollen-appearing cells as well as empty cells were observed in the SCV (Fig. 1) . Growth curves of both phenotypes revealed marked slower growth of the SCV.

The technology has successfully been applied to 16S based typing (1) and multi-locus sequence typing (2) . Here, we present the workflow, data analysis and statistical measures of the technology for the development of a novel molecular typing scheme for Neisseria gonorrhoeae. Methods: Marker regions are amplified by PCR with a tagged primer system, which facilitates in vitro transcription of both DNA strands. Subsequent base-specific endonuclease digests of the two RNA transcripts at the bases cytosine and uracil result in four mixtures of RNA cleavage products. The high precision measurement obtained by a mass spectrometer is used to resolve the mixtures. Nucleic acid sequences are identified by correlating the acquired spectra with theoretical peak patterns predicted for in silico cleavages of each sequence contained in a reference sequence database. Microheterogeneities between the best reference and the sample sequence are identified and deliver new reference sequences. Results: 32 marker regions of potential importance for the development of a molecular typing scheme for N. gonorrhoeae and a set of 267 phenotypically characterised samples were subject to comparative sequence analysis by mass spectrometry. 94% of the marker regions were converted into PCR assays and 83% of all samples resulted in high quality data throughout the set of 30 markers. Data analysis was a result of UPGMA peak pattern clustering for sample grouping, statistical analysis and sequence analysis by a time-efficient SNP Discovery algorithm. Dideoxy sequencing was used to resolve samples of high variance and showed concordance with the mass spectrometry data.",

W. Ruppitsch, J. Calaway, M. Van Ert, T. Hadfield, A. St\u00f6ger, K. Grif, A. Pietzka, F. Allerberger (Vienna, AT; Palm Bay, US; Innsbruck, AT) Objectives: The aim of this study was to assess the usefulness of highresolution melting (HRM) curve analysis on the LightCycler 480 PCR system as a tool for the correct identification of Bacillus anthracis and to assess its utility as a method to recognise the Ames strain, the strain used in the 2001 anthrax attacks in the USA. Methods: DNA from nine bacterial isolates [eight B. anthracis and one B. cereus DSM 4312], including one strain originating from an American diplomatic postal bag in December 2001 in Vienna [1] , was isolated using the Qiagen Blood & Body Fluid Spin Protocol as described by the manufacturer. All B. anthracis isolates were subtyped by VNTR analysis as described previously using a 25 VNTR system [2] . For HRM curve analysis six specific primer combinations were chosen and tested for the identification of the Ames strain by specific single nucleotide polymorphisms [3] using the LightCycler 480 High Resolution Melting Master as described by the manufacturer. The obtained data were analysed with the HRM gene scanning software (Roche). Results: VNTR analysis confirmed the 2001 'postal bag' isolate as a B. anthracis Ames strain and the other B. anthracis isolates as 'non-Ames' genotypes. HRM curve analysis allowed 1) the differentiation of B. cereus DSM 4312 from the B. anthracis isolates and 2) the rapid and accurate discrimination of the B. anthracis Ames strain from the other seven B. anthracis isolates. Of interest, the VNTR data from three B. anthracis isolates from Tyrol, Austria were shown to be European B2 strains and extremely similar to French and Italian B2 genotypes. Two B. anthracis isolates from the country of Georgia were also subtyped; one was identical to the vaccine strain 34F2 Sterne, and the other (411-G) was an A3a isolate. Conclusion: We were able to show that HRM curve analysis is a fast, simple and cost effective screening method for identification of B. anthracis strains. HRM curve analysis, coupled with strain-specific SNP signatures, allows differentiation of the Ames strain from other B. anthracis strains using a single PCR. As the source of the intentional release of B. anthracis spores in 2001 has never been elucidated, the Technological innovation of bacterial typing S77 ability to identify or exclude the presence of the Ames strain in clinical and environmental samples is of great importance. Objectives: Comparative genomic hybridisation (aCGH) studies use microarrays to evaluate the distribution of genes of sequenced bacterial strains among unsequenced strains. The use of this technology to study different strains of the same species has led to important insights into the identification of the species \"core-genome\" as well as the distribution of the genes in the \"accessory genome\" in the population. As genomic sequences from multiple strains of the same species become available, multistrain microarrays are designed, containing spots for every unique gene in the sequenced strains. In two-colour aCGH experiments with multistrain microarrays, the choice of control sample can be the genomic DNA of one strain or a mix of the genomic DNA of all the strains used in the array design. This important problem has no universally accepted solution. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relative performance of each of the two types of control in two-colour aCGH experiments.",

The majority of clinically relevant ESBL variants derive from the genes blaTEM-1 or blaSHV-1 by mutations that alter the amino acid configuration and increasingly from the acquisition and mutation of genes from the CTX-M gene family. In the past decade further enzymes like the OXA lactamases and plasmidmediated AmpC lactamases have emerged in the clinics as a new severe problem as they are likely to hydrolyse modern cephalosporins. The presentation will demonstrate developments made under the German PathoGenoMik programme on the example of the ESBL chips as well as future routes for rapid microbial diagnostics in the clinic with special focus on novel technologies for faster assay times and microfluidic integration.",

Patients with more than 2 weeks of Cg colonisation were retrospectively included in this study. For each patient, each isolate was genotyped using microsatellite-based MLVA method. Susceptibilities of Cg isolates to azoles were determined with NCCLS reference method (first and last isolate per strain per patient, susceptibilities to FLC, itraconazole, voriconazole VRC and posaconazole). Patient data (including azoles exposure during SICU stay) were retrospectively collected. Acquired FLC resistance was defined by MIC of the last isolate for FLC > 8 mg/mL and a 4x-fold increase of this MIC during SICU stay. Results: Thirty nine patients out of 1218 admitted in SICU were included. Characteristics of patients included were: mean age 65 years (\u00b115), median SICU stay 30 days [range: 18-160], mean SAPS II score 44 (\u00b114). Main underlying disorders were abdominal surgery and polytrauma. All patients harbored only one Cg strain, except one patient colonised with two different strains. Acquired azole resistance was not observed in six patients without azole exposure. Thirty three patients were given azole antifungals during SICU stay, all with high daily dose (DD) of FLC or VRC (mean DD: 470 mg/day). Nine out of 33 (27%) presented SICU-acquired resistance of their own Cg strain. Cg strains with FLC acquired resistance all showed cross-resistance to other azoles. No significant risk factor of acquisition was identified among patient data, characteristics of azole regimens used (duration, total dose) and Cg genotypes. Conclusion: Acquisition of cross-azole resistance following azoles exposure occurs frequently in SICU patients. Antifungal agents others than azoles (i.e. candins, polyenes) should be considered as initial therapy in SICU patients with suspected invasive candidiasis in the setting of prior azole exposure.",

Methods: Seven fluconazole-resistant / susceptible dose-dependent (R/SDD) and ten fluconazole-susceptible (S) C. albicans isolates cultured from various clinical specimens were included in this study. The susceptibility of the strains against amphotericin B, fluconazole, itraconazole, ketokonazole, clotrimazole and flucytosine were determined by broth microdiltion method according to CLSI M27-A2 standards. Restriction enzyme analysis was performed by using PagI enzyme after PCR on all isolates for Y132H mutation, and sequence analysis was done for other mutations in the ERG11 gene. Overexpression of efflux pumps was also investigated by microdilution method M27-A2 using substrates and inhibitors. Results: All seven fluconazole R/SDD isolates were found to be resistant to flucytosine except one, all were susceptible to amphotericin B and all isolates except one were resistant to itraconazole and ketoconazole and all of them except one were susceptible to clotrimazole. Y132H mutation was not detected in all strains. K143R, G464S, G465S and V488I mutations were determined in three of the R/SDD isolates.

Objectives: Recently the emergence of triazole-resistance was reported in clinical Aspergillus fumigatus (AF) isolates. It is unclear if azole resistance arises during therapy or that it is due to other causes of azole exposure. We investigated the possibility that azole-resistance is present in environmental AF isolates. Methods: Soil, leaves, seeds and compost samples were obtained from local plant nurseries and a local garden centre. Soil was also sampled in the surroundings of the Radboud University Nijmegen Medical Center, Nijmegen, The Netherlands. In addition AF isolates from the hospital indoor environment present in our fungus culture collection were tested for resistance. All samples were cultured on Sabouraud agar plates with and without itraconazole. Azole-resistant AF isolates were matched with representative azole-sensitive control isolates. Phenotypic susceptibility profiles (CLSI reference method) and molecular resistance mechanisms (cyp51A gene) were determined as well as molecular strain identification. Genotypical analysis was performed to determine if the environmental isolates clustered with clinical isolates. Results: AF was cultured from 49 of 79 environmental samples, with 10 exhibiting an azole resistant phenotype. Resistant isolates were also cultured from soil from flower beds (6 isolates), seeds (1), compost from a plant nursery (1) and compost from the garden centre (2) . Five of 248 isolates from the hospital indoor environment were azoleresistant: patient rooms (3) and hospital water (2) . A tandem repeat and a L98H substitution were present in 13 of the 15 resistant isolates. This resistance mechanism was previously described to be the dominant change in triazole-resistant clinical isolates. Genotypical analysis showed that all isolates are unique but genetically clustered, 13 of the 15 environmental resistant isolates were clustered together in one clade.",

Outcome data were obtained earlier in a temporarily neutropenic disseminated mouse model of invasive aspergillosis. Results: MIC distributions were as follows: for A. fumigatus complex ranging from 0.4 -1.4 mg/ml, with modal MIC of 0.8 mg/ml; for A. flavus complex from 0.8 -2.4 mg/ml with modal MIC of 1.2\u22121.4 mg/ml; for A. terreus complex from 1 ->3 mg/ml with a biphasic distribution with one modal MIC at 1.0 mg/ml and another at 2.4 mg/ml; and for A. niger complex from 0.4 -1.2 mg/ml with modal MIC of 0.8 mg/ml. Only A. flavus and A. niger complex distributions were approximately Gaussian. Suggested epidemiological cut-offs are therefore 1 mg/ml for A. fumigatus, A. niger and A. terreus complex, and 1.4 mg/ml for A. flavus complex. We were able to correlate in vivo and in vitro data.

The VSD (Vaccine Safety Datalink), a collaborative project with the CDC Immunization Safety Office (ISO), is composed of 8 medical care organisations which collect medical and vaccination data on more than 5.5 million members annually. Data from these organisations is compiled to conduct studies of vaccine adverse advents. Methods: In a preliminary analysis, we looked at GBS occurring within 3, 6, or 10 weeks after vaccination, in KP NCAL members of all ages from 1994-2005. For the analysis we used a novel \"case series\"-like approach. Instead of looking at a vaccination and potential GBS in a time window related to it (the usual case series approach), we looked at all vaccinated persons with GBS, and examined the proportion of vaccinated cases that were vaccinated in the window vs. the remainder of the year. We used logistic regression to compare the proportion of vaccinated cases whose vaccination occurred in the window versus the expected assuming there is no association with the vaccine. For seasonal vaccines, like influenza, we estimate the expected odds from the proportion of vaccines given inside vs. outside the window. This new method controls for seasonality and other confounders. In this exploratory analysis of multiple vaccines and risk windows, using a novel analytical method, we found a possible increase in the risk of GBS in the 6-week period after vaccination with Td. After verification by chart review we plan to extend the analysis to the entire VSD study population. As the analytical method controlled very well for confounders, including seasonality, this model may be applicable to other vaccine safety studies. Objectives: Brucellosis is the most important common bacterial zoonoses. Various vaccines such as subunit vaccine were proposed for prevention of this disease. The immunogenic Brucella abortus ribosomal protein L7/L12 is a promising candidate antigen for the development of subunit vaccines against brucellosis. In this research, protection of recombinant HSA-L7/L12 fusion protein in Balb/c mouse was evaluated. Methods: The amplified gene was cloned in pYHSA5 vector then pYHSA5-L7/L12 construct was transformed in Saccharomyces cerevisiae and expressed protein from supernatant was purified by affinity chromatography column. Balb/c mouses were immunised in four groups by HSA-L7/L12 fusion protein (group 1), Brucella abortus S19 (group 2), HSA (group 3), PBS (group 4).

As ExPEC strains become increasingly resistant to antibiotics, preventive measures such as vaccination against these pathogenic E. coli strains are an achievable goal. Methods: Based on previous findings in genome analysis we selectively target virulence factors and uropathogen associated proteins. To identify the relevant immunogenic regions, the unknown three dimensional structure of these proteins was simulated. Furthermore MHCI and MHCII epitopes as well as proteasome cleveage sites were predicted. Considering these data two recombinant modular proteins were designed, containing several epitope bearing subfragments separated by linker sequences unlikely to be presented on MHCI or MHCII receptors. To express the recombinant vaccine proteins, two fully synthetic genes have been synthesised using an optimised codon bias to enhance protein expression in Enterobacteriaceae. We evaluated two different application routes in the mouse model for these new multi-epitope vaccine proteins to obtain both, a high humoral and cellular immune response. First, we used purified vaccine proteins and administered them nasally. Second we used a novel bacterial antigen delivery system which is efficient if administered orally, and targets the vaccine directly into the cytoplasm of mammalian cells in vivo to enhance the cellular T-cell mediated immune response.",

However to date, a broad-coverage MenB vaccine has been elusive because unlikely other serogroups the MenB polysaccharide producing only a poor response from the immune system. Vaccine development is applying their technical expertise to develop safe and effective meningococcal vaccines to overcome these obstacles and to pioneer new recombinant vaccines against MenB (rMenB). In a technique known as \"reverse vaccinology\", potential vaccine candidates were created by analysing the entire genome sequence of a highly powerful MenB strain. Through genetic engineering and from the investigation of 350 potential antigens, scientists identified those strains with surface proteins that best induced an antibody response. Building on this genomics approach, Novartis is developing a broadcoverage vaccine to offer protection against multiple strains of MenB. Phase II trials have demonstrated satisfactory safety, tolerability and immunogenicity. In addition, rMenB is the first recombinant MenB protein vaccine to induce an immune response in infants.",

The mortality of nosocomial fungal infections remains high, and new therapeutic and preventive strategies are needed.

Prevention of waterborne nosocomial mould infections in high risk patients will include point-of-use filtration, sterile water for drinking, and bathing and not showers to avoid aerosolisation. Investigations of the water and its tubing system should be done properly to identify the water quality of the hospital.

Infections caused by these bacteria are difficult to manage, partly because of inherent or acquired antimicrobial resistance manifested by these microorganisms and partly because of deficits in patients' host defences as a result of neutropenia or other underlying condition. There is thus a pressing need to develop effective interventions to prevent exogenous acquisition of infection from environmental sources. In this respect a wide range of aquatic sources, including ice-making machines, aqueous solutions of disinfectants and nebulizer apparatus have been considered as being of importance in outbreaks of infection associated with Gram-negative bacteria such as Pseudomonas and Stenotrophomonas spp. The application of discriminative molecular typing techniques, such as pulsed-field electrophoresis, to characterise the relatedness of environmental and patient isolates has highlighted the increasing importance of hospital water supply systems, including potable water and water faucets, in the epidemiology of infections caused by environmental Gram-negatives. More recently, prospective studies conducted in nonoutbreak situations have suggested that hospital water systems may also be of significance in endemic or sporadic infections associated with these bacteria. However, isolation of environmental bacteria from potable water supplies which are indistinguishable from patients' clinical isolates cannot, in itself, answer the question as to whether patients acquire the bacteria from water faucets or whether faucets are directly or indirectly contaminated by the patients. Nevertheless, there is now accumulating evidence to suggest that interventions, such as point-of-use water filtration, to minimise or eliminate Gram-negative bacteria from aquatic sources in the patient environment may be effective as infection control interventions. These findings should now provide the impetus for further systematic prospective studies to establish whether these interventions can be adopted as integral components of infection control programmes for facilities which provide care for patients at risk of Gram-negative infection.",

The efficacy of lamivudine alone, the first nucleoside analogue used, is limited by the high rate of resistance. Adefovir has efficacy comparable to that of lamivudine, but with low resistance rate.

These agents have been shown to be effective in improving virological, biochemical, and histological features in high proportion of the patients with chronic hepatitis B. However, they can not eliminate hepatitis B virus and only suppress HBV replication. Furthermore, the emergence of drug resistant HBV is becoming problematic over the long-term. Therefore, physicians should be careful in selecting whom to treat, when to start treatment, how to monitor patients before, during and after the treatment. Multidrug (Mdr) efflux proteins (1) are widespread amongst microorganisms, including pathogens. These membrane proteins contribute to emerging antibiotic resistance. Two-component system (TCS) receptor membrane proteins (2) play key roles in metabolism and sensitivity to antibiotics of many microorganisms. The design of novel antibacterial drugs would be greatly facilitated by knowledge of the structures of these membrane proteins, which are poorly understood because of the difficulties of obtaining purified protein and crystals of quality. We describe a structural genomics strategy for the amplified expression, purification and characterisation of such proteins. The success of this strategy is an important step towards reproducible production of transport and receptor proteins for the screening of drug binding and for optimisation of crystallisation conditions to enable subsequent structure determination and drug design. Multi-drug resistance of Gram-negative bacteria is now known to be the result of over-expressed efflux pumps that extrude a variety of unrelated antibiotics prior to their reaching their targets. Although a number of methods have been developed for the assessment of over-expressed efflux such as the use of the universal efflux pump substrate ethidium bromide (EB) or the use of radiolabeled antibiotics in the presence and absence of an inhibitor of efflux pumps, these methods are labour intensive, are relatively imprecise and do not lend themselves for inter-laboratory use.",

Physicians and paediatricians who treat meningococcal disease observe a range of severity from relatively benign disease to severe physiological disruption leading to death. In general terms, those who present with meningitis tend to have a better prognosis, whilst those who present with severe sepsis syndrome have the worst prognosis. Study of factors associated with the severity of meningococcal disease is difficult and confounded by factors such as the sporadic nature of the disease and marked differences in access to health systems between individuals. Many studies have shown that the outcome of meningococcal disease is associated with the phenotype of the infecting organism.

Whilst there is no consistent segregation of virulence determinants in clonal groups associated with the most severe disease, organisms expressing serogroup C have been associated with fatal outcome. A number of host factors have been identified as important in determining severity of disease. Chief amongst these is age at presentation, with the worst prognosis being associated with adults. Some of this may be explained by the increasing sophistication of paediatric intensive care. Twin studies have indicated that death from severe infectious disease has a familial component and in the case of meningococcal disease a large number of studies have been conducted to investigate the role of genes encoding components of the immune system, the inflammatory response and coagulation pathways. The difficulty faced by geneticists is that death is the most easily verifiable end point for the purpose of studying genetic modifiers of severity of disease. Because of the death rate of only 8% this means that very small cohorts are available for study. However, association studies have revealed a relationship between a number of genes and the likelihood of death in meningococcal disease. These include Fc receptors, polymorphisms of plasminogen activator inhibitor type 1, properdin deficiencies, and polymorphisms within interleukin 1 and the interleukin 1 receptor antagonist.",

Objectives: Accurate assessment of risk factors for colonisation with antibiotic resistant bacteria (ARB) is often confounded by scanty data on antibiotics use. The aims of the study were: to prospectively define the incidence of new colonisation due to ARB per 1,000 days of antibiotics; to determine mean time of acquisition; to measure patients'risk factors for acquiring ARB; and to compare genotypic patterns of the strains. Methods: A 12-month prospective multicentre cohort study including all in-patients (pts) starting antibiotics was planned. Samples of nose and rectum were taken before and after starting antibiotics (day 2, 4, 7, 15, and 30) . ARB included: meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), vancomycin-resistant enterococci (VRE), and ciprofloxacin-resistant Pseudomonas aeruginosa (CR-PA). Pulsed-field gel electrophoresis was done to define genetic relatedness of the strains. Results: In total, 6245 swabs from 864 pts were processed. The overall carriage rate of newly acquired ARB was 5%. The mean duration (days\u00b1standard deviation) of antibiotic therapy prior to the detection of a new colonisation was 8 (\u00b14) for MRSA (range, 2\u221216), 6 (\u00b16) for VRE (range, 2\u221219) and 9 (\u00b18) for CR-PA (range, 2\u221228). The incidence of ARB per 1,000 days of therapy was 14 for carbapenems, 9 for glycopeptides, and 6 for cephalosporins of 3rd gen. and quinolones. Highest rates were observed for carbapenems in dialysed (29) and diabetic (28) pts and for 3rd gen. cephalosporins in pts with cronic renal impairment (27 4.4) , use of carbapenems (OR 2, 95% CI 1\u22123.8), and age >70 (OR 1.5, 95% CI 1.1\u22122) were significant predictors for new ARB acquisition (P < 0.05).

As such, it is important to track population-based consumption data on an ongoing basis and to explore the determinants for regional variations in antibiotic consumption for the province of British Columbia (BC). Methods: We obtained data from the BC PharmaNet database on all outpatient oral antibiotic prescriptions for 2005. Prescriptions were expressed as their defined daily dose (DDD) per 1,000 inhabitants according to the 2006 World Health Organization Anatomical Therapeutic Chemical system. Geographic Information Systems (GIS) mapping was used to display the spatial variations of antibiotic consumption in BC. We explored the relationships between antimicrobial consumption and socioeconomic and climatic factors using Pearson's correlation. Overall and class-specific rates of consumption were described by the Health Service Delivery Area geography. Results: Overall antibiotic consumption was highest in the northern health regions and lowest in the interior health regions. Correlations were found between antibiotic consumption and socioeconomic and climatic factors. Higher rates of antibiotic consumption were associated with the aboriginal population, higher family income, and July total precipitation. An inverse relationship was found between consumption and July average temperature. Further analysis of class-specific antibiotic consumption identified different geographic patterns of consumption and socioeconomic associations. Higher rates of penicillin, b-lactam, and macrolide consumption were seen with the aboriginal population, younger population (age <15 years), higher ratio of physicians to population, higher family income, and greater July total precipitation. An inverse correlation was found between antibiotic consumption and older age (age >65 years), mortality rate, and warmer July temperatures. Conclusions: Different rates of antibiotic consumption exist within the province. Appropriate policies affecting antibiotic consumption in the community can be designed by looking at the relationships between antibiotic consumption and socioeconomic determinants, and their related impact. To collect data about hospital antibiotic use with standardised methods in different European countries. The data were used to answer two research questions: 1. What is the trend in hospital antibiotic use over time? 2. What effect does adjustment for bed days or admissions have on trends in hospital antibiotic use? Methods: A total of 18 hospitals participated in the study, one hospital from each of 18 countries. We collected monthly data about total antibiotic use over 6 years starting from January 2000. Crude data about antibiotic use was converted to the ATC drug classification and Defined Daily Doses (DDD). Results: Antibiotic use measured in DDD increased in 14 hospitals and decreased in 4 hospitals. There was an underlying trend of reducing length of stay in 16 of the 18 hospitals. Consequently annual changes in DDD per 100 occupied bed days (DBD) were also greater than annual changes in DDD per 100 admissions (DAD) in 16 of the 18 hospitals. Overall there were five distinct patterns of antibiotic use over time: 1. Increasing antibiotic use that was not fully explained by increased clinical activity (11 hospitals). Increases in DDD over time remained after adjustment with either bed days or admissions. 2. Increasing antibiotic use was entirely explained by increased clinical activity (1 hospital) . The increase in DDD over time reversed to a decrease in DBD and DAD. Hence the apparent increase in antibiotic use was entirely due to a large increase in clinical activity. 3. Divergence between DBD and DAD (2 hospitals). The increase in DDD was reversed when adjusted for admissions but persisted when adjusted for bed days. The divergent results were a consequence of an increasing number of admissions combined with reducing length of stay. The apparent increase in antibiotic use was likely to be explained by increase in clinical activity. 4. Decreasing antibiotic use that was not fully explained by decreased clinical activity (3 hospitals). 5. Decreasing antibiotic use that was entirely explained by decreased clinical activity (1 hospital). Conclusions: Interpretation of longitudinal surveillance data about antibiotic use is facilitated by presentation of changes in DDD without adjustment for clinical activity in addition to adjusted data. Antibiotic use is influenced by number of admissions and by length of stay; consequently adjustment for clinical activity should be done with both admissions and occupied bed days.

Results: Based on 105 potential QIs, 55 structural, 13 process and 3 outcome QIs were selected and developed. Structural QIs described the organisation and resources as well as communication and evaluation tools available at hospital level for implementing a multimodal, multidisciplinary antibiotic stewardship programme. Process QIs focussed on four care processes: 1) surgical prophylaxis (indication, drug choice, timing and duration of administration); 2) management of community-acquired pneumonia (blood culture and Legionella antigen tests and drug choice for empirical treatment); 3) management of Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia (echocardiography, IV catheter removal and duration of effective therapy); and 4) IV-PO switch for treatment with equivalent bio-available antibiotics. Outcome indicators focussed on antibiotic use. Conclusions: This international consensus development of structural and process QIs provides tools for evaluating the intensity of hospital antibiotic stewardship programmes and auditing key treatment and prophylactic practices. Process QIs will be tested for feasibility, reliability and sensitivity to improvement in pilot hospitals.",

Treatments were recorded in relation to diagnoses, prophylactic use, community acquired (CAI) and hospital acquired infection (HAI). Three nation-wide PPS were performed in November 2003 November , 2004 November and 2006 . Three areas were identified for intervention before the last PPS; duration of perioperative prophylaxis, treatment of community-acquired pneumonia, use of fluoroquinolones in community-acquired cystitis in women. Direct information to all hospital physicians and feed-back of earlier results was used as the intervention strategy. Results: 13,420 patients treated with antimicrobial agents in 54, 49 and 64 hospitals were included in the three PPS. The number of admitted patients corresponds to 50\u221275% of all admitted patients in Sweden during one day. 32.5\u221234.9% of the admitted patients were treated with antimicrobials. The indication for treatment was CAI in 17.0\u221218.0%, HAI in 9.2\u22129.9% and prophylaxis in 6.3%. For adults cultures were taken before oral treatment in 60% and before parenteral treatment in 70%. Only minor changes in the patterns of the overall use of antimicrobials were observed. However, in lower urinary tract infections of women the relative use of mecillinam and trimethoprim increased from 36 to 44% and from 22 to 26%, respectively, while the use of fluoroquinolones decreased from 25 to 13%. For community acquired pneumonia no significant changes were observed. The 2006 PPS result shows a decrease of peri-operative treatments longer than one day from 47% in 2003 to 31% in 2006. The one-dose peri-operative prophylaxis in the lower gastrointestinal tract has increased from 62% to 77%. The total amount of antimicrobials used for adults was 40. ",

However, in our study only one PCR assay developed by us showed the higher accuracy in Po detection due to specific primer design done to recognise all the variants in Po 18S-rRNA gene. PCR proved to be more sensitive and specific than microscopy and changed the picture of malaria epidemiology in our area detecting 5 single and 1 mixed infections missed by microscopy, revealing 5 single and 2 mixed infections incorrectly diagnosed by microscopy and giving speciation in 6 cases in which microscopy had limited the result to genus identification. The most prevalent malaria cases in our area as well as in Italy were imported from Africa and due to Pf, followed by Po and Pv. In our experience a rapid and accurate diagnosis of malaria allowed to administer a prompt and targeted therapy with positive impact on the clinical management of the patients.

O408 A water filtration method using river sand and activated carbons for the removal of intestinal protozoan parasites in contaminated drinking water at a point-of-use treatment S. Zinyowera, C. Muchaneta-Kubara, N. Midzi, S. Moyo, D. Saungweme, P. Nziramasanga, T. Mduluza (Harare, ZW; Baltmore, US) Introduction: Drinking water that is contaminated with micro-organisms causes an estimated 6 to 60 million cases of gastrointestinal illness annually, worldwide. WHO and UNICEF estimate that approximately 2.2 million die of waterborne diseases each year. Clean safe water is mendatory to every household. Chlorine which is used for water disinfection does not kill protozoan parasites. Objectives: To analyse sand filters and different types of activated carbons, experimentally in their capability in removing protozoan parasites from drinking water. Materials and Methods: Known human intestinal protozoan parasites were put in water which was poured in to either a metal or plastic bucket with a mesh screen at the bottom. The bucket contained either coarse or very fine sand. The water collected after filtration was then spun and analysed for protozoan parasites. Activated carbons; namely baobab shells, macadamia nut shells, amarula stones, local wood carbons, commercial activated carbons and the activated carbons used by the Zimbabwe National Water Authority (ZINWA) at their water treatment plants, were analysed separately. Each activated carbon was placed in distilled water that had known amounts of protozoan parasites and incubated for 24 hours with constant shaking at room temperature. The water was then sieved using a tested cotton cloth that allowed parasites to pass through, spun and then analysed for protozoan parasites. Results and Conclusions: Very fine sand was more efficient in capturing protozoan parasites (99%) than coarse sand (80%). Activated local wood charcoal reduced the number of parasites in water by 17%, whilst commercial activated carbon adsorbed all other intestinal protozoan parasites except for Entamoeba coli that was reduced by 98%. Amarula stones reduced parasites by 33.5%, activated carbon from ZINWA reduced parasites by 99.6% whilst activated carbons from baobab shells and macadamia nut shells completely adsorbed parasites by 99.99%. All the activated carbons were capable of adsorbing Giardia lamblia by 99.99% except for the ZINWA activated carbon (99.6%). Very fine sand in combination with either commercial carbon, activated wood carbon or activated carbons from baobab shells and macadamia nutshells are potential useful media to use as household point of use treatment of water for the removal of parasites before application of another method such as chlorination in order to kill bacterial cells. Introduction: Molecular assays for detection of Entamoeba histolytica, Giardia lamblia, Cryptosporidium hominis/parvum, and, respectively, Dientamoeba fragilis have already been described. They were more sensitive and/or specific than microscopy but are to date not routinely applied as replacement of the time-consuming microscopic analysis for protozoal gastrointestinal (GI) pathogens. An internally controlled molecular assay for the simultaneous detection of all four protozoa in a single faeces sample was validated and compared to the Triple Feces Test (TFT) microscopic analysis. Also, an algorithm for the complete parasitological diagnosis after implementation of the real-time PCR assay in the laboratory routine was created. Methods: TFT sets (2 fixed A. Perez-Ayala, J. Perez-Molina, P. Zamarron, F. Norman, C. Jimenez, M. Navarro, R. Lopez-Velez (Madrid, ES) Objectives: To study the main diagnoses among returning travellers with respect to the geographical area visited, length and type of travel Methods: The Tropical Medicine Unit at the Ramon y Cajal Hospital, is a referral unit where immigrants and ill returned travellers are attended since year 1989. A comprehensive microbiological study was performed in all the cases. Length of travel was divided into three groups: <30 (Short), 30-180 (Medium) and >180 days (Long-term); whereas type of travel was classified into four groups: professional high and low risk (PHR; PLR), tourism high and low risk (THR, TLR). Discrete variables were compared by means of Chi squared or Fisher exact test. For quantitative data an independent samples t-test was used. Results: 2993 travellers consulted our department during 1989-2006, with a progressive increase in the number of patients over the years. The mean age of the travellers was 35 years (interquartile range: 28\u221240) and there were 47.9% of women. The main diagnoses were: suspected bacterial gastrointestinal infections (16.3%), 16.7% of them had bacterial growth confirmation (S. sonnei: 36.5%, Salmonella sp: 29.2%, Campylobacter sp: 13.4% and C. difficile: 9.7%) and were observed mainly in travellers to North Africa and South-West Asia. The second most frequent diagnosis was parasitic intestinal infection (12.8%): G. lamblia: 28.2%, E. histolytica: 14.9%, T. saginata: 6.2%, A. lumbricoides: 3.3% and S. stercoralis: 2.6%; in 42.7% of the cases more than one parasite was found. The third diagnosis in order of frequency was malaria (9.5%. produced by P. falciparum: 53.7%, followed by P. vivax: 17.5%), acquired mainly in Subsaharan Africa (16.9%) Conclusion: Both type and length of travel were associated with bacterial GI infections (TLR and <30 days). Only travel length was a determinant for parasitic GI infections (increased risk for travel >30 days) Malaria was only associated with type of travel (less risk in TLR). ",

Exposure of S. aureus to telavancin results in time-and concentration-dependant loss of membrane potential and increased membrane permeability. Quantitative flow cytometry assays indicate that the majority of S. aureus are fully depolarised within 1 hour following exposure to clinically relevant telavancin concentrations. These data provide a mechanistic basis for the potent activity of the drug against GISA/hGISA clinical isolates, observed both in vitro and in vivo. In microorganisms with acquired Van-type glycopeptide resistance, telavancin, like teicoplanin, is not an inducer of the vanB gene cluster.

PIRO score was obtained at ICU <24 h from admission and 1 point given for each present feature (range 0\u22128 points). Mean PIRO score was significantly higher in non-survivors than in survivors (4.6\u00b11.2 vs 2.3\u00b11.4). Higher scores were significantly associated with higher mortality, prolonged length of ICU stay, and days of mechanical ventilation (all p < 0.001).

The lungs are amongst the most frequently affected organs during severe infection and sepsis. The abundant presence of intravascular and extravascular fibrin appears to be a specific hallmark of acute lung injury following sepsis and is much more obvious than the fibrin deposition in other organs. Tissue factor (TF) is regarded as the primary initiator of coagulation in severe infection. Effective blocking of the tissue factor pathway by either recombinant tissue factor pathway inhibitor (rTFPI) or anti-tissue factor antibodies in experimental sepsis attenuates lung injury and partially prevents pulmonary dysfunction. In addition, inhibition of tissue factor activity prevents local activation of coagulation in models of pneumonia. Another mechanism that contributes to fibrin deposition in the lung is the local depression of fibrinolysis, due to the increase of plasminogen activator inhibitor type I. These effects on pulmonary coagulation and fibrinolysis are regulated by various pro-inflammatory cytokines.

These results suggest that tifacogin may reduce mortality in patients with sCAP who did not require heparin. This potential benefit of tifacogin is currently being tested in the Phase III CAPTIVATE study, in approximately 2100 patients. CAPTIVATE will compare current sCAP standard of care with a combination of sCAP standard of care plus adjunctive tifacogin, (either 0.025 mg/kg/hr or 0.075 mg/kg/hr in a 96 hour continuous infusion). The study objective is to determine whether treatment with tifacogin early in the disease process can reduce incidence of mortality by preventing the development of disseminated intravascular coagulation and multiple organ system failure. Study entry criteria were based on the 2007 IDSA / ATS guidelines plus a clinical diagnosis of community-acquired pneumonia. Specifically required are the presence of either 1 major criterion (requirement for mechanical ventilation, or need for therapeutic vasopressors), or 2 or more minor criteria (hypotension despite adequate fluid resuscitation, PaO 2 /FiO 2 ratio <250, respiratory rate 30/min, non-invasive ventilatory support, BUN > 7mM, new onset confusion, multilobar pneumonia, platelet count <100,000 cells/mm 3 or a fall of >25% in previous 48 hours to <120,000, leukopenia or hypothermia). The primary endpoint of the study is 28 day all cause mortality. Secondary endpoints include treatment failure, need for mechanical ventilation, incidence of disseminated intravascular coagulation, duration of ICU admission, and length of hospitalisation. If an overall treatment benefit is observed with tifacogin, then pharmacoeconomic analysis will also be performed. Survival data will also be collected at 90 days, 6 months, and 1 year to assess long-term safety.",

Communityacquired pneumonia (CAP) is the most common cause of communityacquired severe sepsis in ICU, and represents a well characterised disease with protocolised treatments. Hence, analysis of biomarkers in this homogeneous population may be important to define disease severity and candidates for new therapeutic approaches. Subgroup analysis of results from the OPTIMIST study of tifacogin in severe sepsis patients revealed a decrease in mortality in sCAP patients treated with tifacogin who had a documented microbiological infection and who were not concurrently treated with heparin. A trend toward reduced mortality was also seen in sCAP patients with procalcitonin 2 ng/mL (Laterre et al, Critical Care, submitted) and in the overall severe sepsis population with evidence of active coagulation (PF 3nM) at baseline (Opal et al. IDSA 2004) who were treated with tifacogin. These results warranted further investigation, and led to the initiation of the CAPTIVATE study of tifacogin in 2100 patients with sCAP. Moreover, resolution of the human genome has led to the discovery of new genomics biomarkers associated with sCAP mortality. It is hoped that by investigating both genomics markers and \"classic\" biomarker level changes over the clinical course of the disease, that it will be possible in the future to predict which patients are at potential risk of decompensation, and which patients are most likely to benefit from early treatment such as tifacogin. Candida albicans is the main species associated with OPC but nonalbicans are increasing, while mutiresistant Candida albicans and nonalbicans strains have emerged. These changes are a consequence of long term prescriptions of narrow spectrum antifungal agents and repeated prescriptions of oral systemic antifungal agents. Moreover, in this heavily treated immunocompromised population, it is important to limit the potential for drug-drug interactions. Therefore, national and international guidelines have been issued and recommend using a local antifungal therapy with a spectrum extended to all Candida species as first line treatment of OPC. In clinical practice, the treatment compliance of the immunocompromised patients represents a challenge and should be favoured by a local antifungal agent easy to use. ",

Since mucosal colonisation is a risk factor for systemic dissemination, oropharyngeal candidiasis implies an early treatment initiation. Systemically active antifungals carry the challenge of drug-drug interactions as well as the potential for a variety of organ toxicities. Although topical treatment is clearly preferable for localised superficial infections, systemically active antifungals are used frequently. Most likely these will be azoles. Different patient groups will benefit from additional topical treatment options for oropharyngeal candidiasis. These are in particular patients with HIV/AIDS and patients with neoplastic disease. In HIV infected subjects receiving multiple concomitant medications and suffering from oropharyngeal candidiasis, the risk of interaction of systemic antifungal treatments with HAART needs to be minimised and thus guidelines do recommend first line local antifungal therapy. The incidence rates of oropharyngeal candidiasis vary within the highly complex cancer patient population and depend on the type of tumour, treatment modalities and cytostatics used. Consequences of oropharyngeal candidiasis may be: decreased food and sometimes even liquid intake, loss of weight, and reduced general state and quality of life. Potentially subsequent decreased chemotherapy doses and increased intervals between cycles may have a negative impact on therapeutic success. For both groups of immunocompromised patients, it is important to detect and treat oropharyngeal candidiasis from the start. The availability of a new local antifungal agent with a limited systemic exposure and a once daily dosing favouring patients' compliance should optimise the management of oropharyngeal candidiasis in immunocompromised patients.",

Hence, infectious diseases are easily transmitted aboard. Outbreaks of measles, rubella, varicella, meningococcal meningitis, hepatitis A, Legionnaires' disease, influenza and gastroenteritis among passengers and crew have been reported and are feared both for their health and publicity reasons. However, consequences are usually less serious for ferries, carrying people between two close ports, than for cruise ships. Vessels doing cruises that last weeks to months often visit remote areas with varying sanitation standards, and evacuation may not be possible for days. While ferries often carry no medical personnel, cruise ships as a rule have 1\u22122 physicians and 1\u22123 nurses. Cruise companies emphasize illness prevention through pre-employment medical screening and vaccination programmes for their crew, as well as detailed and rigid ship sanitation procedures. Over one hundred outbreaks of infectious diseases, particularly gastrointestinal disease, were reported to be associated with ships between 1970 and 2000. Despite good performance on health inspections, outbreaks of gastroenteritis per 1000 cruises increased almost tenfold from 2001 to 2004. The increase was mostly attributable to norovirus, and highlights the inability of environmental programmes to fully predict and prevent risk factors common to person-to-person and fomite spread of disease. The much publicised outbreaks and global threats have led the cruise companies to cooperate closely with local, national and international public health authorities -and with each other. These efforts have resulted in detailed protocols on how to deal with every aspect of shipboard sanitation: under normal circumstances, when there is a threat of an outbreak, and during an outbreak. They include mandatory hand disinfection for all persons entering the ship, and strict isolation demands for all cases of gastroenteritis for a minimum of 24 hours after the last symptom. Isolation aboard is difficult and risky. A bedside test to quickly diagnose or rule out norovirus is therefore high on the cruise industry's wish list.",

Experience of the last decades has shown that their impact is increasing on European health systems and, indeed, societies due to hugely increased travel activities and immigration. Current estimates assume that in Germany alone, 300,000 patients fall sick every year after a journey outside of Europe. In addition, health systems have to cope with an unknown number of migrants that need treatment for a variety of conditions. Overall, information about relevant infectious diseases in endemic areas is comparatively easy to get. Information about the same diseases in returning travellers are much more difficult to acquire. Only few international studies have been done in regards of this question. As a result, only limited data are available on imported infectious diseases in Europe, especially those that are not notifiable in all countries. TropNetEurop, the network on the surveillance of imported infectious diseases in Europe, has been founded in 1999. The network is trying to foster collaboration of clinicians throughout the continent in order to increase information exchange and knowledge about imported infections. Selected diagnosis are reported regularly in anonymised form. Several outbreaks among travellers and immigrants have been detected since the foundation of the network (www.tropnet.net). Fever is the most important clinical sign of imported infectious diseases post travel.

According to a recent review evidence is missing that avoidance of 'dangerous' food and beverages reduces the risk of TD. Among the many drugs suggeted for chemoprophylaxis, probiotics showed no or at best a low protective efficacy rate. Bismuth subsalicylate is modestly effective. Among antibacterial agents, trimethoprimsulfamethoxazole, doxycycline and others are considered obsolete because of antimicrobial resistance by prevalent enteric bacterial pathogens. Antimicrobial resistance has also become an increasing problem with widespread use of fluoroquinolones and fear of systemic reactions has limited the prescription of such medication. Poorly absorbed antibiotics, mainly rifaximin, are far more attractive, but this agent is not available in most European countries. The whole cell/B-subunit (WC/BS) cholera vaccine has repeatedly been shown to prevent TD by LT-ETEC strains, possibly even by other pathogens. Similarly a new heat labile LT-ETEC transcutaneous patch vaccine has been effective beyond just LT-ETEC. If such vaccines are recommended, it is paramount to underline that the protective efficacy is far from complete and that TD may still occur en route. As no current prophylactic measure is truly satisfactory, (self)-therapy of TD remains an important strategic option against TD. Quinolones seem still to be effective in most parts of the world, but there is a lack of recent data on the frequency of resistance from analysis of TD stool samples on all continents. There are indications that azithromycin is the drug of choice in SE-Asia. Often a single antimicrobial dose will be sufficient to cure TD. With increasing concerns about post-infectious irritable bowel syndrome we should consider a more liberal approach with respect to inclusion of antimicrobials in the travel kit.",

            "text": "Vancomycin is an imperfect agent, like every other antibiotic. Nevertheless, each day it is used successfully in hospitals, nursing facilities and homes, as the first line agent for treatment of infections due to meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and for infections caused by a broad array of other Gram-positive bacteria in individuals allergic to or otherwise intolerant of b-lactam antibiotics. This enormously successful clinical experience comes in spite of its widespread use for non-approved indications, based on breakpoints that antedate the discovery of isolates with reduced susceptibility, without detailed appreciation of its tissue penetration, and sometimes under circumstances of suboptimal ancillary intervention (drainage, debridement or removal of foreign material). Most patients tolerate vancomycin well; not surprisingly, adverse effects do appear to be more frequent as higher than usual doses are utilised against infections due to organisms at the high end of the MIC distribution. Randomised, double-blind prospective clinical trials have largely failed to identify newer agents that are superior in clinical efficacy to vancomycin, despite tantalising signals of possible advantages of other agents against MRSA. Which, if any, potential advantages would support the anticipated differential in cost of the newer agents remains to be determined. With time, better antibiotics than vancomycin will be introduced, and they will assume their rightful place in therapy. However, as long as we do not expect vancomycin to achieve the impossible -to treat infections due to non-susceptible organisms at sites where it does not penetrate -this antibiotic will remain an attractive therapeutic option. Table. There was no statistically significant difference between the rates of mortality among the two groups. Conclusion: C. albicans is still the most common Candida species and there was no major difference in the distribution of the candidaemia isolates among our patients for the last three years. Renal failure was found to be the only risk factor associated with C. albicans candidaemia and prior antifungal therapy, either prohylactic or empirical, was found to be associated with non-albicans candidaemia. As it is well known that appropriate empirical antifungal therapy is the most important factor contributing to low morbidity and mortality rates, each centre should have their own surveillance data. Objectives: Echinocandins are increasingly used in the initial management of invasive candidiasis (IC); however these agents are more costly than alternatives. IV/PO conversion programmes reduce cost for use of antimicrobials with high oral bioavailability, but conversion to an agent of a different class is a new concept. The objective of the present study was to determine the effect of an IV/PO conversion programme from echinocandins to oral azoles on clinical outcomes and resource utilisation. Methods: 160 consecutive patients receiving echinocandins were evaluated over 2 study periods. . Post implementation of IV/PO intervention, antifungal therapy was completely discontinued in 13 patients upon recommendation of IV/PO switch. Duration of total and intravenous antifungal therapy was reduced in Phase 2. (Figure 1 ) Fluconazole was the most common agent used for PO switch followed by voriconazole. Recurrent Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea (CDAD) is an emerging problem in hospitalised patients and in nursing homes. The pathogenesis of CDAD involves disturbance of the homeostasis of normal bacterial colonisation of the large bowel enabling the outgrowth of a pathogenic C. difficile strain. Recurrent CDAD may be explained by failure of antibiotics to eradicate C. difficile spores, which will germinate and grow out in a bowel that lacks normal colonic flora as host-defence mechanism. The absence of normal colonisation as defence mechanism is illustrated by the finding that 50% of clinical recurrences of CDAD may be caused by a different strain than the initial infecting strain (Wilcox, 1998) . Furthermore, coinfection with multiple strains has been described. Patient factors associated with recurrence are older age and co-morbidity. Hospitalised patients with CDAD require isolation precautions to prevent epidemic spread, and CDAD often prolongs hospital stay. Initial treatment with metronidazole or vancomycin during 10\u221214 days is effective in 70\u221285% of patients (Maroo, 2006) . Treatment of relapse consists of a second course of antibiotics during 14 days, with a success rate of about 55% (McFarland, 2002) . A subsequent relapse can be treated with 2 weeks of vancomycin followed by a tapered-pulsed vancomycin regimen lasting for several weeks. Consequently, recurrent CDAD requires long-term (and often ineffective) antibiotic treatment and costly isolation precautions in hospitalised patients and a more effective treatment strategy for recurrent CDAD is needed urgently. In 1958, Eiseman et al described the successful treatment of 4 patients with severe antibiotic induced diarrhoea with enemas containing donor stool. Since this initial report, 81 patients treated with donor faeces for recurrent CDAD have been reported in the literature (Borody, 2004) . Clinical improvement was mostly seen after 1\u22124 days, and there was a response in 90% of the patients without reports of recurrence. Side effects related to faecal therapy have not been reported. The efficacy of faecal therapy against CDAD may be explained by (unknown) inhibitory substances (bacteriocins) produced by the infused donor bacteria and by restoration of faecal physiology by implantation of missing flora components. Importantly, randomised controlled trials are lacking and this may be the reason that faecal therapy has not become a generally accepted treatment strategy for recurrent CDAD. The apparent lack of interest in faecal therapy may also relate to reluctance from physicians to the distasteful nature of the therapy. We successfully treated 11 patients with recurrent CDAD with a suspension of donor faeces (protocol is outlined in Table 1 ). Prior to our intervention, CDAD recurred after a median duration of 70 days on antibiotics (metronidazol and vancomycine) and isolation precautions had been taken during 5\u221211 weeks in hospitalised patients. Faeces were delivered to the bowel by colonoscopy or nasoduodenal tube. Of note, three of these patients were infected with the PCR ribotype 027 strain that is often not responding to conventional antibiotic therapy.",

            "text": "Conclusions: This study fails to identify any significant association between nosocomial CDAD and measures of ED crowding or increased patient contacts due to room changes or the use of multi-bed ward rooms. However, the validity of our methodology is supported by the association between antibiotic prescriptions and nosocomial CDAD occurrence, as already quoted in the literature. We note a temporal decrease in the reported rate of Clostridium difficile infection in our institution since the study period (April 1, 2003 -March 31, 2004 and suggest that the most likely reason is improving housekeeping practices over this period. thermal conditions to kill C. difficile spores in PBS (i.e. no organic challenge) was also evaluated using spore suspension testing at 80oC and 90oC. Two different makes of W-BPWs were evaluated. Results: Our data on suspension testing showed that the C. difficile spore count was not reduced after 5 minutes at 90oC. Simulated-use testing demonstrated that the ward-BPW when used without detergent, did not effectively eliminate C. difficile spores from inoculated plastic or stainless steel bedpans whereas the CPD-BPW did. The thermal disinfection default cycle in the two makes of W-BPW and the CPD-BPW was 80\u00baC for 1 minute. The ISO15883\u22123 guidance document recommends these thermal conditions as adequate for reprocessing of bedpans. Exposure to these conditions resulted in~1 Log10 reduction in spores. However, the 80oC for 1 min thermal cycle combined with the 116\u00baC drying cycle for 7 mins used by the CPD-BPW killed 6 Log10 C. difficile spores. Further testing showed that using an alkaline detergent along with the W-BPW did reliably eliminate C. difficile spores. Conclusion: Despite the wide use of 80\u00baC for 1 minute, our data showed that these thermal conditions alone were not effective in killing C. difficile spores. Only when alkaline detergent was used was the W-BPW able to eliminate C. difficile spores from bedpans. We recommend that alkalkine detergent always be used with W-BPWs to reduce the risk of C. difficile spores remaining on reprocessed bedpans as this could pose a risk for nosocomial transmission. (ST80) harbours an H2 haplotype which is described as the ancestral allele that gave rise to the other variants. These trends, although largely regionalised, must be taken into account when targeting skin infections as well as other infections, including community-acquired pneumonia. In summary, these emerging tendencies towards increased incidence of CA-MRSA and decreased susceptibility to antimicrobial agents must be considered when choosing empiric treatment options. In most, but not all, U.S. cities, CA-MRSA is now the most common pathogen cultured from patients with skin and soft tissue infections in emergency departments. Epidemic community-associated MRSA disease has also been reported from some rural areas. In Canada, a similar pattern of emergence is occurring with the West Coast being most affected. Of concern is the risk of greater incidence of communityacquired pneumonias caused by MRSA in the future. Although severe pneumonia caused by CA-MRSA was reported in children soon after this pathogen emerged in the U.S., reports in adults have been rare and typically associated with influenza virus infection. However, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention reported 10 cases of severe MRSA CAP in 2006; six of the 10 patients died. Although a small sampling of patients, these cases nonetheless underscore the need for healthcare providers to be extremely vigilant for cases of severe CAP caused by MRSA. The emergence of MRSA strains since 1961 has complicated the treatment of S. aureus infections, and glycopeptides (vancomycin or teicoplanin) are, in many cases, the only therapeutic alternative. Glycopeptides remain the first-line option when infection due to MRSA is suspected or diagnosed. However, vancomycin treatment failure is not uncommon, even when MRSA strains are fully susceptible to vancomycin (MIC 2 mg/mL). A reduction in the efficacy of vancomycin against MRSA strains with a high vancomycin MIC (1\u22122 mg/mL) has been described in observational studies with low number of patients, suggesting that subtle changes in the MIC may explain clinical failures. These findings require healthcare practitioners to consider alternative treatments and look to the future, as newer, more active compounds are developed to improve the treatment armamentarium against communityacquired infections with drug resistant S. aureus.",

The implementation of this strategy in certain European countries has decreased the prevalence of MRSA infection in the nosocomial setting for the first time. Nevertheless and in parallel, an increase in MRSA isolates in the community setting, including nursing homes and healthcare-associated facilities, has been observed during the past decade. As a consequence, community-acquired MRSA infections are increasingly recognised in the nosocomial setting, making it difficult, to integrate preventive strategies into standard hospital procedures. Moreover, an influx of well-dispersed community clones -most of them carrying the type IV staphylococcal cassette chromosome (SCCmec type IV) -into the nosocomial setting has been demonstrated in countries with high prevalence of MRSA in the community. The potential association of these isolates with the production of the Panton Valentine Leucocidin (PVL) is of clinical concern, as initial empirical coverage for this pathogenic organism is restricted. Standard antimicrobial treatment protocols against both community-and hospital-acquired MRSA infections include non-b-lactam antimicrobials, among them, glycopeptides have been considered the gold standard.",

However, low-level resistance, or \"vancomycin-intermediate S. aureus\" (VISA), has been documented worldwide. These isolates display a thickened cell wall affecting the activity of glycopeptides. Recent data have also demonstrated the isolation of MRSA isolates with heterogenous subpopulations with decreased susceptibility to glycopeptides (\"heterogeneous VISA\"), and the possibility that a slight rise in modal vancomycin MIC values within the susceptible category (MIC range 1.5 to 2 mg/mL) may affect clinical success of glycopeptide treatment. This possibility has been observed in different infections, including bacteraemia. The true incidence of MRSA populations with decreased susceptibility to glycopeptides is unclear and might depend on population structure distribution. Maintaining vigilant surveillance of these resistance trends is critical to ensure appropriate coverage. Treatment options for invasive MRSA infections currently include vancomycin, linezolid, daptomycin, tigecycline, and quinupristin/dalfopristin. Additionally, a number of compounds to combat the growing resistance problems are in development, including novel glycopeptides (dalbavancin, telavancin, and oritavancin), and next-generation cephalosporins (ceftobiprole and ceftaroline) which demonstrate excellent in vitro activity against MRSA, VISA and VRSA. The addition of these new agents to the armamentarium will be critical in managing patients with infections due to MRSA encountered both in the hospital and community settings.",

Babwah (Hamilton, CA) Background: With the discovery of five new respiratory viruses since the year 2000 and advances in molecular technology allowing the detection of 20 respiratory viruses in a single test, we studied the epidemiology of respiratory virus infections. Methods: A total of 1,060 NP specimens collected from symptomatic patients (526 <20 yr and 534 >20 yr) were used in the study. Approximately 100 specimens (50 from each age group) were sected blindly (DFA and culture results unknown) from specimens submitted to our Regional Virology Laboratory for each month from November 1 2005 to October 31 2006. Nucleic acid was extracted using the MiniMag extractor (Biomerieux) and tested by the ID-Tag RVP Test (TmBioscience) for 20 respiratory viruses and for Bocavirus using a separate PCR. Clinical information was collected by chart review. Results were analysed by month and age. Twenty five of 39 Bocavirus infections were dual infections. Only Rhino/Entero, RSV and Bocavirus were more prevalent in the <20 age group (p < 0.05). Influenza, Metapneumovirus and Coronavirus were only present in winter/spring months while Parainfluenza type 4 was only present in summer months; all others were distributed across most months. Discussion: This study indicated the following: 1) Rhino/Enterovirus was the most prevalent virus infection of symptomatic children and adults, 2) only RSV, Rhino/Enteroviurs, and Bocavirus showed higher infection rates in children compared to adults, 3) 90% of dual infections (mostly Boca and Rhino/Enterovirus) occured in children summer, and 4) Influenza, Metapneumovirus and Coronavirus displayed a winter seasonality. The average rate of positives diagnosed per month for <20 yr group was 63% compared to 23% for adults.",

Gorgievski-Hrisoho (Berne, CH) Respiratory viruses are among the most frequent human pathogens worldwide, leading to a significant number of hospitalisations, especially in children and in immune-compromised patients. Several new diagnostics tools for respiratory viruses have recently appeared on the market, including the xTag Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) by Luminex Molecular Diagnostics. The goal of the present study was to compare this new multiplex PCR method with conventional direct immunofluorescence (DIF) in children's nasopharyngeal aspirates for the following viruses: respiratory sincytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (ADV), parainfluenza viruses 1\u22123 (PIF), influenza viruses A and B (IF), as well as human metapneumovirus (hMPV). The RVP kit permits in addition the detection of entero-/rhinoviruses, coronaviruses and parainfluenza virus 4. In total 240 nasopharyngeal aspirates (126 DIF negative and 114 DIF positive samples) were analysed. All RSV, PIVA, IF and hMPV DIF positive samples (43, 15, 18 and 11, respectively) were confirmed as positive for the same virus by RVP. For ADV, however, only 13 out of 27 DIF positive samples (48%) were also ADV positive by RVP. The samples with discrepant results are currently being reanalysed by DIF and by a second, independent PCR. Of note is the finding that over 64% (81/126) of all DIF negative samples were positive when analysed with RVP. This was in great part due to the additional entero-/rhinoviruses detected by RVP (75/81), but also because of additional RSV, IF, PIF, ADV and hMPV positive samples that had been missed with the DIF assays (21/81). Finally, using RVP we detected as many as 10.4% (25/240) of double and 0.5% (1/240) of triple infections, versus a single double infection detected by DIF. The implications of our findings for both diagnostics as well as clinical practices are discussed.",

Tokaryk, S. Wong, A. Wong, K. Ho (Calgary, CA) Background and Objectives: Detection of a broad range of respiratory viruses using sensitive nucleic acid amplification tests (NATs) is invaluable for individual patient diagnosis and management of outbreaks. The wide range of potential pathogens makes such testing expensive and laborious using individual real-time NATs. The objective of this study was to compare the multiplex detection of 19 respiratory viral targets using the Luminex xTagTM Respiratory Viral Panel (RVP) with the individual real-time NATs used in ProvLab (Alberta). Methods: Nasopharyngeal samples were pre-screened by DFA for influenza (IFV) A and B, parainfluenza (PIV) 1\u22123 and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) with direct fluorescent antigen (DFA) positive samples excluded from this comparative study. Respiratory specimens were collected between December 2006 and May 2007 with nucleic acid extraction undertaken using the easyMAG \u00ae extractor and reagents (bioM\u00e9rieux). Individual real-time NATs for comparison with RVP were directed against IFVA, IFVB, PIV1\u22124, RSV, human metapneumovirus (hMPV) and respiratory adenoviruses. A total of 1497 specimens were part of the analysis with 632 specimens analysed prospectively and 865 retrospectively by RVP. If positive results for coronaviruses or picornaviruses were obtained in the RVP assay these samples were subsequently screened by additional real-time NATs against these targets as such testing is not part of our current diagnostic routine. Results: A total of 937 specimens were positive for one or more respiratory viruses by the individual NATs and 948 had one or more positive results by the RVP assay. The rate of detection for hMPV and IFVA was comparable by both methods (5.7% and 34.0% positive results, respectively). Detection rate for IFVB, PIV1\u22124 and RSV was 5.3%, 13.1%, 12.7% by the real-time assays and 4.9%, 12.6%, 10.7% correspondingly by the RVP assay. The detection of adenovirus was superior by the in-house NAT (8.2% positive compared with 4.6% by the RVP assay). However, the RVP assay identified 12.1% of samples as picornavirus positive (confirmed by sequencing), only half of which were identified by individual NATs undertaken for enteroviruses and rhinoviruses. Of the 248 IFVA positive specimens, 85.5% were subtyped as H1 or H3 by the RVP assay. A total of 26 samples positive for coronaviruses were detected by the Luminex RVP, which were all confirmed by real-time RT-PCR assays. Conclusion: The Luminex RVP assay meets our current standards of sensitivity and specificity and also allows for multiplex detection of 19 respiratory viral targets with considerable time and cost savings compared with alternative NATs. This method will become front line for respiratory virus testing in our laboratory.",

Thus, the consequences of the infection are more severe in nonimmune women than in those who have acquired a certain level of antimalarial immunity. In highly endemic areas, the frequency and severity of the infection is higher in primigravidae and decreases with increasing parity. In non-immune women, the risk is similar across the parities and malaria may be an important direct cause of maternal mortality. Malaria infection during pregnancy may have important negative effects on the infant's health, through intrauterine growth retardation and prematurity or directly through congenital infection.

There is, however, no a priori reason to expect the rates of each system's biological and demographic processes to respond to changing patterns of temperature and moisture stress in ways that inevitably increase the risk of human (or livestock) infection. A prerequisite of reliable early warnings about the future is a system-specific explanation of the past. Tick-borne encephalitis (TBE), one of the two most widespread, prevalent and medically significant vector-borne diseases in Europe, will be presented as a case study. Epidemiological data at fine temporal and spatial resolution record major upsurges in incidence over recent decades. The timing, degree and abruptness of these upsurges differ markedly between countries, and even between districts within countries. A significant discontinuity in temperature conditions in 1989 across Europe could have created a generally more permissive environment for TBE virus transmission by improving the circumstances necessary for larval and nymphal stages of the tick to co-feed on rodents. The pattern of climate change, however, is too uniform within and between countries to provide the sole, or even the most important, explanation for the extreme spatio-temporal heterogeneity in TBE epidemiology. Instead, a nexus of interacting factors affecting both the risk of infection and exposure of humans to that risk, and each differing in force in space and time, is a more powerful model. Analysis of the situation in Central and Eastern Europe has established that many of these factors were driven by the socioeconomic changes associated with the end of Soviet rule, and include climate, land cover, land use, wildlife, agricultural practices, industrial activities, (un)employment and income. Western and Nordic Europe must be incorporated to achieve a coherent pan-European explanation. The same principles may apply to the periodic epidemics of Crimea-Congo haemorrhagic fever.",

VZV DNA was detected in 4% of neurons from human trigeminal ganglia at autopsy with a median of 7 viral genomes per positive neuron. Latent VZV DNA was rarely, if ever, detected in nonneuronal cells. The virus can reactivate from latently infected ganglia to cause shingles. The varicella vaccine virus may also reactivate and cause shingles, especially in immunocompromised patients. We have used PCR to detect VZV DNA in the blood of immunocompromised patients who present with abdominal pain in the absence of a rash, to allow early therapy prior to development of the rash of shingles. At least six VZV genes (genes 4, 21, 29, 62, 63, and 66) are expressed in latently infected ganglia in humans. We have constructed VZV mutants lacking five of these genes and found that three of the genes are essential for replication in cell culture, one is important for efficient replication, and one is dispensable for replication. Mutations in the coding region of one of the latency genes (gene 63) resulted in impairment in replication in vitro and a marked reduction in latency in rodents. Replacement of the native promoter for one of the latency genes (gene 29), with the major immediate-early cytomegalovirus promoter, resulted in a virus that replicated to levels comparable to wild-type virus, but the virus was impaired for latency in rodents. These studies suggest that changes in the coding or promoter region of latency genes in VZV might serve as useful vaccine candidates. Such vaccines might be less likely to establish latency and reactivate in humans, and may be especially useful in immunocompromised patients.",

Quorum sensing enables bacteria to coordinate population-wide responses that play a crucial role in virulence. Complex quorum sensing networks enable bacteria to detect signals that provide information regarding the number of individuals in the population, the different species of bacteria present in the community, and additional inputs, such as environmental and metabolic signals. Recently, it has become clear that small non-coding RNAs (sRNA) are often the central regulators modulating gene expression at central steps of quorum sensing cascades and therefore coordinate the complex networks that control virulence in bacteria. Importantly, multiple functionally redundant sRNAs act together at the same key step of these regulatory cascades. These different sRNAs are differentially expressed and respond to different signals and thus provide a mechanism of integrating different environmental stimuli and translating the combined information into the appropriate output. We study a quorum sensing signal named autoinducer (AI-2), which unlike most quorum sensing signals, it is not speciesspecific. AI-2 is produced and detected by a wide variety of bacteria and allows interspecies communication. By studying interspecies signalling in consortia we found that Escherichia coli can manipulate AI-2 signalling in organisms such as the human pathogen Vibrio cholerae and interfere with other species' ability to regulate virulence. Here we show that in this enteric bacterium the AI-2 synthase, LuxS, is regulated by a sRNA. Objectives: Iclaprim (ICL) belongs to the diaminopyrimidines class of antimicrobial dihydrofolate reductase (DFHR) inhibitors for which trimethoprim (TMP) is the most well known representative. ICL exhibits an expanded spectrum of activity and is notably very potent against important Gram-positive pathogens, including meticillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA). The purpose of this study was to substantiate previous studies on the mode of action of ICL in S. aureus. Methods: One TMP-susceptible (wt-DHFR, ATCC 25923) and two TMP-resistant DHFRs (one carrying a specific F98Y point mutation and one from a multidrug resistant strain 101) were used in this study. The DHFR's were overexpressed and purified and used for the determination of IC50's, Ki's, binding by isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) and co-crystallisation with ICL and TMP.",

The larger size of the ICL lipophilic residue resulted in an enlarged hydrophobic contact surface area with the protein of about 35\u00c5 2 . Conclusions: ICL and TMP bind to and inhibit S. aureus enzymes in a similar manner. The increased potency of ICL towards TMP-R DHFR enzymes is due to a larger binding contact area which is in agreement with the enhanced activity of ICL against both TMP-S and TMP-R S. aureus isolates. Conclusion: ME1036 is a broad-spectrum carbapenem with exquisitely potent activity against Gram-positive pathogens and other respiratory pathogens such as H. influenzae and M. catarrhalis. ME1036 has the potential to be a useful new agent for the treatment of serious community-and hospital-acquired respiratory tract infections.",

In contrast, each concentration of A3-APO decreased the blood bacterial level by two log10 units four hours after the 1st administration, e.g. from 10 5 to 10 3 CFU/ml similar to that after imipenem treatment. Continuous dosing of either the peptide or imipenem retained the blood bacterial counts at the lowest detectable levels. Conclusion: To our knowledge, this is the first antibacterial peptide that is effective in mortality models of Gram-negative systemic infection and exerts bactericidal activity in vivo in doses comparable to traditional antibiotics without notable toxic side effects. Supported by the Sbarro Health Research Organization and Hungarian OTKA T46186. Objectives: Osteomyelitis is an infection of bone primarily caused by staphylococci. Its treatment often requires a combination of surgical intervention and prolonged antibiotic therapy, generally relying on outpatient parenteral antibacterial therapies for weeks. Here we report the development of a new class of prodrugs where rifamycins are tethered to a bisphosphonate moiety possessing high affinity for osseous tissues. These compounds deliver the antibiotics directly to the infection site where they will be concentrated and released over time to exert their therapeutic activity. Methods: Compounds were synthesised by tethering rifabutin, rifalazil or adequately designed rifamycins to a bisphosphonate moiety via cleavable covalent linkers. The affinity of these compounds towards bone powder was determined individually by measuring the amount of unbound prodrug in the supernatant by bioassay against the total amount of material following the exposure to bovine bone powder in phosphatebuffered saline (PBS) for 1h at 37\u00baC and centrifugation. The rate of cleavage was determined by resuspending the obtained bone pellet in either PBS or 50% serum in PBS overnight at 37\u00baC, and measuring by bioassay the drug content in the supernatant after centrifugation. Results: A total of 14 prodrugs were synthesised using different chemically and/or enzymatically cleavable linkers on rifamycin derivatives. Most prodrugs displayed near quantitative bone binding, validating the selection of a bisphosphonate as the bone-seeking moiety. Following incubation of the bone-bound prodrugs at 37\u00baC for 24h, the levels of regenerated parent antibiotics were in the range of 0 to 2.65 mol% in PBS and 0 to 2.68 mol% in 50% rat serum.",

Synthetic analogs of the cellular receptors, which are able to compete with natural cellular receptors, have potential for development of anti-influenza therapeutics. Synthesis of low-molecular inhibitors of influenza virus is more preferable for the development of therapeutics by reason of possible toxicity, immunogenicity and incomplete biodegradation of polymeric compounds. The objectives of this study were to compare the anti-influenza activity and to clarify the mechanisms of action for low-molecular and high-molecular (polymeric) compounds, containing Sia2\u22126Gal disaccharides.",

Electron microscope study of the virion morphology showed direct damage of influenza virus particles by low-and high-molecular compounds, and allowed us to propose mechanism of virucidal action of hemagglutinin inhibitors. Conclusion: These data show significant antiviral effect of low-and high-molecular hemagglutinin inhibitors on influenza viruses at low micromolar concentration. Although we do not consider high-molecular hemagglutinin inhibitor as candidate anti-influenza drug due to the probable toxicity and limited biocompatibility of polymer, low-molecular hemagglutinin inhibitor has potential for the prevention of influenza virus infection as specific virucidal therapeutic.",

Rudenko, M. Golovchenko, N. Piskunova, D. Ruzek, L. Grubhoffer (Ceske Budejovice, CZ) Twelve serum samples from patients with symptomatic borreliosis and 1 sample (cardiac valve tissue) from patient with endocarditis and cardial stenosis associated with chronic borrelial infection were collected in the hospital of Ceske Budejovice (CZ). Serological tests gave the negative results in all cases. The goal of our project was to analyse the samples of the human origin with molecular techniques. The serums and a cardiac valve tissue were used for direct DNA purification. The flagellin gene was chosen as a target for analysis. The PCR primer set for amplification of fla gene from Borrelia burgdorferi sensu lato (Bb SL) complex was used. The direct sequence of amplicon indicated the presence of different sequences. The cloning step allowed the separation of them. Ninety six recombinants from each sample were sequenced. In silico RFLP analysis with 5 restriction endonucleases was conducted. \"Virtual\" hybridisation with the probes designed for the detection of Bb SL and specie-specific probes were used. The Maximum Parsimony heuristic search was performed in PAUP by implementing the treebisection-reconnection algorithm. Alignment was 488 characters long, 53 of them were parsimony informative. All 13 recognised species of Bb SL complex were used as controls. As results, 4 cases were confirmed to carry B. burgdorferi ss, 4 -B. bissettii, 1 -B. garinii, and 4 -multiple spirochete specie. From the 4 co-infected samples 3 were defined as double infection with B. burgdorferi ss and B. bissettii and 1 as a triple infection with B. bissettii, B. burgdorferi ss, and B. garinii. The identity of each species was confirmed by similarity search using the GenBank, RFLP pattern, virtual hybridisation and PAUP. Until recently it was thought that only 3 genospecies, firmly established and well accepted, might cause Lyme disease (LD), i.e. B. burgdorferi sensu stricto, B. afzelii, and B. garinii. However, few other genospecies have also been connected to LD or were isolated from humans with LD symptoms. They are B. bissettii and B. spielmanii. After the first isolation of B. bissettii from the 9 samples of human origin in Slovenia, our results are the second evidence of involvement of B. bissettii in LD in Europe. The presence of B. bissettii as a single strain in humans with symptomatic borreliosis or chronic borrelial infection is the strong support of the fact that B. bissettii is not only the member of the LD complex, but is a causative agent of the disease.",

Brandenburg (Leeuwarden, Ballum, Groningen, NL) Objectives: The Dutch island Ameland is described previously as a hot spot for Borrelia burgdorferi in ticks. We investigated the percentage infected ticks and the risk of subsequent development of clinical symptoms of Lyme disease in persons with one or more tick bites consulting a family practice on the island. Methods: From January 2004 to December 2006, 214 ticks were collected from 169 patients and tested for the presence of Borrelia DNA by PCR. Six to 18 months after the removal, the patients were questioned about erythema migrans and other symptoms possibly related to B. burgdorferi infection. Blood samples were taken from a subset of patients to investigate for B. burgdorferi antibodies. Results: In 44 (20.6%) ticks B. burgdorferi DNA was detected. Forty patients were bitten by at least one positive tick. Follow up information was available from 144 persons, 36 (25%) with a positive tick and 108 (75%) with a negative tick. In 124 of 144 persons the ticks were removed within 24 hours, including 33 of the 36 persons with positive ticks. None of the 144 patients reported having an erythema migrans. Twelve persons reported a non-specific red discoloration of the skin, not fulfilling critera for EM, on the site of the tick bite during the first weeks after the tick bite. Of these, four were bitten by a positive tick and eight by a negative tick. Surprisingly the four patients with a positive tick all consulted their own family doctor and were treated with doxycyclin, whereas none of the eight with a negative tick did so. One patient, bitten by a positive tick that had been on the skin for more than 24 hours, reported systemic symptoms compatible with Lyme disease. She reported no redness on the site of the tick bite. Lyme serology was performed on 27 persons with a positive tick, two were positive, including the patient with systemic symptoms. Of serology performed on seven persons with a negative tick, one was positive in IgG. Conclusions: In this cohort of patients with tick bites the chance to develop Lyme disease was low, even with 20.6% of the ticks positive with B. burgdorferi. This is probably related to the fact that the majority of ticks were removed within 24 hours. Our findings support the policy described in the Dutch CBO-guideline on Lyme borreliosis to preserve antibiotic therapy for patients developing symptoms of Lyme disease.",

Grubhoffer (Statesboro, US; Ceske Budejovice, CZ) Recently, we studied 118 Borrelia isolates, cultured from samples collected from a variety of rodents, birds and ticks in 9 different localities of the southern region of the United States. In addition to a large group of highly diverse strains related to Borrelia bissettii, and another, rather homogenous group of strains that represent Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto, a group of 16 isolates with unusual characteristics was found. All 16 isolates were cultured from ear biopsies of the rodents Peromyscus gossypinus and Neotoma floridana, the main reservoir hosts of Borrelia in the southern US. The rodents were trapped in 5 different localities of South Carolina from September 1994 till August 1997. The new methodology of multilocus sequence analysis (MLSA) that involved the study of rrf-rrl intergenic spacer region, rrs (16S rRNA) gene, flagellin gene, ospA gene and p66 gene, was used to clarify the taxonomic status of this new highly homogenous group of South Carolina isolates. All 13 recognised species of B. burgdorferi sl complex were used as controls. The association of this species with the Lyme disease group was confirmed by multiple results of MLSA. The virtual hybridisation of the rrf-rrl spacer region, flagellin gene, ospA gene with the probes previously described, and experimentally used among these loci for identification of B. burgdorferi sl species showed 100% identity. Unique RFLP patterns were discovered in the rrf-rrl intergenic spacer region and flagellin gene of these South Carolina isolates. Unique signature nucleotides were allocated in the 16S rRNA gene. The Maximum Parsimony heuristic search was performed in PAUP by implementing the tree-bisectionreconnection algorithm for all 5 loci. Phylogenetic analysis shows that each of the main species of the B. burgdorferi sl complex forms a coherent cluster. All sequences from the 16 South Carolina isolates were clustered together and separately from the other species in the B. burgdorferi sl complex. Contrary to dogma, B. burgdorferi sl is present and widely distributed in the southern US. It occurs in many parts where it was not previously thought to occur. A substantial amount of additional results highly support the designation of a new B. burgdorferi sl species from the southern United States. Further analysis of the 16 cultured Borrelia strains from South Carolina is still in progress. The new species will be described formally in another article.",

No difference in the clinical outcome, as evaluated with the visual analogue scale, was observed between the two groups. In addition, borrelia serology using an in-house whole bacterium ELISA and a commercial assay based on borrelial flagella as the antigen (IDEIA, Dako) was carried out on patient samples. No statistically significant difference in the antibody response was found between patients who received amoxicillin or placebo. Importantly, changes in antibody levels were not associated with clinical outcome indicating that the above tests can not be used to predict the outcome. The objective of the present study was to examine the development of the borrelia specific antibodies in these patients using an array of borrelial antigens. Specifically, we wanted to look for serological markers for good response to antibiotic treatment. Methods: Samples drawn from the patients at the initiation of the antibiotic treatment and about 12 months after the treatment were analysed using an in house recombinant IgG and IgM line immunoblot (19 IgG antigens, 18 IgM antigens; Goettner et al; J Clin Microbiol 2005) and recomBlot Borrelia IgG immunoblot (11 antigens; Mikrogen). All patients independent of the treatment were included in the analysis and paired samples were available from 110 patients.

Streptococcus pneumoniae is the leading bacterial cause of pneumonia, sepsis, otitis media, and meningitis and accounts for a significant portion of this mortality. Influenza is also a major contributor, both as a primary infection and by interacting with bacterial pathogens to increase the incidence and severity of pneumonia. While the pneumococcus is the most common secondary pathogen following influenza in typical inter-pandemic years, affecting mainly the young and the frail elderly, Staphylococcus aureus is seen more commonly when highly virulent viral strains circulate, and has been emerging in recent years as a cause of necrotising pneumonia as a co-pathogen with influenza in healthy children and young adults. Our laboratory studies the mechanisms that underlie the interactions between respiratory viruses such as influenza virus and bacterial pathogens such as S. pneumoniae and S. aureus. The approach we have taken is to isolate specific virulence factors in the virus or bacterium and use genetic approaches to modify or delete them, allowing assessment of their impact in relevant animal models. Certain themes of cooperation between pathogens have emerged from this analysis, giving us insight into specific pathogenic mechanisms and revealing how these differ for different viral-bacterial pairs, or between different strains of one of the pathogens. These findings in the laboratory can then be related back to the epidemiology of co-infections in humans, helping define the challenges we face in moderating morbidity and mortality from these pathogens. The ultimate goal of this work is to apply this knowledge to facilitate treatment and prevention of these common diseases by targeting the cooperative interactions that make co-infections so deadly.",

            "text": "It was recognised during the so-called Spanish influenza pandemic in 1918 that the majority of deaths due to the flu occurred more than 7 days after the onset of symptoms. In the overwhelming majority of cases of pandemic influenza, signs and symptoms resolved by day 6, but in a subgroup with significant mortality, illness worsened in the second week of illness. There is abundant evidence that most of the mortality during the pandemic was due to the combination of influenza plus bacterial super-infection. The most common bacterial cause of death was the pneumococcus, but nosocomial spread of group A streptococci was often lethal, as were staphylcocccal infections. Up to 50% of young soldiers' deaths due to influenza in 1918 were complicated by bacteraemia. While antibiotics were not available in 1918, it is naive to believe that antibiotics will reliably save individuals suffering from the cytokine storm of pandemic influenza and simultaneous bacteraemia. Prophylactic antibiotics should be considered, but as progression to pneumonia may be impossible to predict, the amount of antibiotic needed to be given will be considerable (to all those infected with influenza). An additional approach to reduce mortality is vaccinationvaccination against the pandemic influenza strain will be the first priority if such a vaccine is available. Vaccines are currently however available to prevent pneumococcal infection. Data from a randomised trial of pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV) show that children immunised with PCV have 45% less hospitalisation for pneumonia due to endemic influenza. The 23 valent pneumococcal vaccine (23v) is highly protective against bacteraemia when given to healthy young adults. Widespread PCV administration to children including a booster dose in the second year of life is essential to ensure their protection plus the best chance of herd immunity to the PCV types in the older population. Healthcare workers, military personel and other first responders should receive the 23v vaccine when the pandemic threat level reaches level 5. Attempts should be made at that time to also strengthen existing recommendations to immunise at risk and elderly persons with the 23v vaccine. Pandemic influenza plans at present fail to recognise the potentially essential role of pneumococcal vaccine in the prevention of mortality from pandemic influenza.",

Conclusion: Disturbances on intestinal flora were suggested to be a major cause of enterotoxic MRSA infections, and a control of intestinal flora will be important to prevent enterotoxic MRSA infections. Genetic techniques such as Pulsed Field Gel Electrophoresis (PFGE) provide high discriminating power, but are time consuming and costly. In the recent years we have transformed Raman spectroscopy into a rapid identification and typing tool in clinical microbiology. This technique provides information about the overall molecular composition of intact bacterial cells and is highly specific. Over 100 isolates were used to validate Raman spectroscopy as a typing method for MRSA, according to recently published guidelines. Methods: All isolates were cultured for 20 hr on Trypticase Soy agar plates. Biomass was suspended in 10 microliter of sterile distilled water, transferred onto a quartz slide and allowed to dry. Spectroscopic fingerprints were obtained using a dedicated Raman spectrometer, requiring 10 to 60 seconds per sample. Cluster analysis on these fingerprints was performed using the pair wise correlations as a distance measure in combination with Ward's cluster algorithm.",

Conclusion: Using Raman spectroscopy as a typing method, a significant decrease of turn-around time can be achieved, allowing interventions to limit transmission to be taken earlier. The typing information gathered with this technique is comparable to information obtained by genotyping methods. Therefore we conclude that Raman spectroscopy is an easy-touse and rapid alternative in the battle against MRSA.",

All severe clinical events (grade 3 or 4 events according the ANRS classification, hospitalisation, extension of hospitalisation or death) were reviewed by a validation committee. Risk factors for NANHR severe clinical events were analysed using multivariate Cox models with CD4 and plasma HIV RNA viral load (pVL) as time-dependent covariates. Results: After a median follow-up of 88 months (7664 patientyears), 713 NANHR severe clinical events were recorded in 385 patients. Incidence of NANHR severe clinical events was higher than AIDS-related events one, 9.3/100 patient-years and 2.0/100 patientyears, respectively. Most frequent NANHR severe clinical events were bacterial infections (n = 196, 27%), cancer-related events (n = 68, 9.5%), cardiovascular (n = 68, 9.5%) and psychiatric events (n = 61, 8.5%). In the adjusted multivariate analysis, occurrence of a first NANHR severe clinical event was significantly more frequent in patients older than 60 years (hazard ratio [HR] 2.1; 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.3\u22123.2), coinfected with HCV (HR 1.7; 95% CI 1.4\u22122.1), a CD4 <100 cells/mm3 at the time of the event (HR 2.5; 95% CI 1.8\u22123.6) and a pVL > 4 log10 copies/mL at the time of the event (HR 1.9; 95% CI 1.5\u22122.5). Factors associated with bacterial infections were similar to those associated with all types of NANHR severe clinical events, and the risk (HR) increased with the level of virological failure: 2.48 (95% CI 1.48\u22124.17) for pVL >4 log10 and <5 log10 copies/mL and 4.08 (95% CI, 2.28\u22127.36) for pVL > 5 log10 copies/ml. The only factor associated with non-AIDS cancers was age (HR 2; 95% CI 1.6\u22122.6) but a CD4 >500 cells/mm3 at the time of the event tended to have a protective effect (HR 0.5; 95% CI 0.3\u22121; p = 0.06). Conclusions: We recorded a high incidence of NANHR severe clinical events (4 fold than that of HIV-defining events) in our patient population. Virological failure may favour the occurrence of NANHR severe clinical events and especially bacterial infections. These results give further arguments against interruptions of antiretroviral treatment. Objectives: We aimed to characterise the genetic diversity in integrase (IN) region of HIV-1 circulating in Estonia and to compare their genetic diversity with that of B-subtype viruses in ARV treatment naive (ARV-TN) and experienced (TE) patients. Methods: A total of 104 ARV-TN (median age 26 y; 57 male; 59 IDU) and 10 TE but none treated with integrase inhibitors (INI) were analysed. All viruses in the latter population had at least one primary RT DRM with the average number of 2.8. The most commonly seen mutations were K103N (n = 9), M184V (n = 7) and V179E (n = 5). A direct sequencing of plasma viral RNA for both populations was performed in IN region (aa 1-289). Subtyping was carried out using phylogenetic analysis (neighbor-joining).

S\u00e1nchez (Esplugues, Barcelona, ES) Objective: HAART-related long-term toxicities are being increasingly reported in perinatally-HIV-infected children, including hyperlactataemia, dyslipaemias, and hepatic and bone marrow toxicity. Planned interruptions of HAART (PIH) arise with the potential to reduce drug exposure and toxicity. Methods: We present a case series of 14 perinatally-HIV-infected paediatric patients (10 girls, median age 7.7 years at PIH) with optimal long-term response to a first-line HAART regimen who underwent a single PIH. Hemoglobin, total neutrophil counts, lactate levels, triglycerides, total, LDL and HDL cholesterol, alanine aminotransferase and amylase plasmatic levels were assessed at PIH and 12 months later, while off therapy. Non-parametric tests were used as appropriate. Results: At PIH, patients had remained a median time of 4.8 and 4.5 years on therapy (5 out of 14 on a protease inhibitor-based regimen) and with complete suppression of viral replication, respectively. One month after treatment interruption, a blip in HIV plasmatic viral load up to a median value of 4.6 log copies/mL (range 2.9\u22125.6) was observed in all cases; HIV viral load stabilised thereafter. No clinical progression occured, despite a progressive decrease in CD4 cell percentages/counts was observed in most cases. None of the patients had to reinitiate therapy during the 12-month follow-up. One year after PIH, decreases in total cholesterol (median values, from 163 to 134 mg/dL; Wilcoxon rank test, p = 0.03), LDL cholesterol (from 90 to 77 mg/dL, p = 0.064), HDL cholesterol (from 60 to 43 mg/dL, p = 0.002) and lactate levels (from 1.3 to 0.9 mmol/L, p = 0.026) were observed. No changes were observed in the rest of studied parameters. All variables remained within normal/acceptables values at both time-points. None of the patients showed symptoms consistent with hyperlactataemia, hepatitis or pancreatitis, neither while on HAART nor during PIH. Conclusions: In this series, a 12-month PIH lead to a significant decrease in total and HDL cholesterol, and lactate levels. However, all parameters remained within normal values at baseline and after PIH, and no clinical symptoms were observed. The long-term clinical consequences of HAART-related toxicities in perinatally-HIV-infected paediatric patients remain unknown, as well as the potential benefit of HAART-sparing strategies.",

At week 48, mean CD4 increases from BL for ATV/r and LPV/r were 203 and 219 cells/mm 3 , respectively. Fewer patients on ATV/r (2%) than LPV/r (8%) initiated lipid lowering therapy. The proportion of patients with a TC: HDL ratio >5 at week 48 was 12% and 20% on ATV/r and LPV/r, respectively. Patients on ATV/r had a lower incidence of Grade 2\u22124 treatment-related diarrhoea (2% vs 11%) and nausea (4% vs 8%) than LPV/r. Grade 3\u22124 ALT/AST elevations were low ( 2%) on both arms. Discontinuations prior to week 48 were: ATV/r, 9%; LPV/r, 13%. AE-related discontinuations were 2% and 3% on ATV/r and LPV/r, respectively. Three patients (<1%) discontinued ATV/r due to jaundice/hyperbilirubinaemia. Conclusions: In treatment-naive patients, ATV/r demonstrated similar efficacy, a lower incidence of GI-related AEs, and a significantly better lipid profile (TC, TG, non-HDL) compared to LPV/r. In combination with TDF and FTC, both ATV/r and LPV/r were well tolerated with few discontinuations through 48 weeks",

Pump overexpression was considered when the level of specific mRNA of mexD or mexY in the tested strains was >4 times compared with the PAO-1 strain (real-time PCR). Mutations in nfxB (negative regulator of MexCD-OprJ) were studied in all the strains. Results: All isolates were clonally unrelated. Three isolates were susceptible to FEP (MICs: 4\u22128 mg/L), 4 intermediate (16 mg/L), and 2 resistant (32\u221264 mg/L). Eight isolates were susceptible to CAZ (MICs: 1\u22128 mg/L) and 1 intermediate (16 mg/L). In all strains mexY expression levels ranged from 18.32 to 186.7 fold relative to the reference PAO-1 strain; three isolates had mexD expression levels of 4.05 to 150.45 fold relative to PAO-1. MICs of FEP were not higher for strains overexpressing both mexY and mexD than for strains with mexY overexpression alone. In one strain (MICs FEP/CAZ: 16/4 mg/L; mexD hyperexpression 150.45 fold) a mutation in N180 of nfxB modified the protein structure and changed its conformation in the C-terminal region. Conclusions: Hyperexpression of MexXY-OprM in clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa is related to higher MICs of FEP than of CAZ. Additional overexpression of MexCD-OprJ does not contribute to this phenotype.O206 Evolution of quinolone resistance mediated by genetic changes in qnrA, qnrB and qnrS genesJ.M.Rodr\u00edguez-Mart\u00ednez, A.

Respective values for the expression of ANNEXIN(+)/CD4(+)/PI(\u2212) on PBMC's were 7.93 (18.52)% and 3.65 (4.22)% (p < 0.0001).

Conclusion: Serum of patients with severe sepsis or septic shock induces the apoptosis of the lymphocytes and inhibits the apoptosis of the monocytes. This could explain why the induction of CD4-lymphopenia is connected with poor survival and how circulating factors in serum contribute to the perpetuation of the septic procedure through the nonapoptotic monocyte.

This decrease of the proportion of the nosocomial cases is discussed as result of intensive control measures to prevent LD in healthcare facilities (HCF) in many countries.

Many of the infected patients have a history of recent hospitalisation outside Scandinavia including Southern-Europe, Asia and Africa. However, MBL isolates are now being identified in patients precluding travel or hospitalisation outside Scandinavia in the last twelve months. VIM-enzymes constitute the predominant MBL genotype, found in all K. pneumoniae isolates and ten P. aeruginosa isolates. IMP was detected in one P. aeruginosa isolate. Genetic characterisation of the isolates revealed that the genes encoding MBL are located in class 1 integrons including TniC-class 1 integrons of variable size and with a plethora of other resistance gene cassettes. Accordingly, the susceptibility profiles of the isolates show a multi-drug resistant phenotype and some isolates are only susceptible to colistin. Interestingly, the qnrS gene, conferring low-level quinolone resistance, was identified in the two Norwegian K. pneumoniae isolates. Serotyping of P. aeruginosa indicate that O11 and O12 isolates predominate, and some isolates within the serotypes were found to be related by PFGE and MLST. Conclusion: The spread of MBL-producing clinical isolates to Scandinavia is likely to initially have occurred through importation of the MBL positive isolates.

It is known that uptake of thymidine (dT) and its conversion in dT-monophosphate by thymidine kinase (TK) bypass the activity of diaminopyrimidines. dT levels in rodents are very high and antagonize diaminopyrimidine, thus precluding reliable evaluation of their efficacy in vivo. On the contrary, dT levels in humans are low and do not affect their activity. It is hypothesised that iclaprim should be effective against MRSA in a human environment and that its efficacy should be restored in a rodent milieu using TK-deficient strains. We tested this concept in human and rat fibrin clots in vitro, simulating amorphous cardiac vegetations in vivo.",

Wang (Shanghai, CN)    Objectives: Since the discovery of qnrA in 1998 two additional qnr genes, qnrB and qnrS, have been described. These 3 plasmid-mediated genes contribute to quinolone resistance in Gram-negative pathogens worldwide. A new gene, qnrC, was cloned from a transferable plasmid pHS9. Methods: Plasmid pHS9 came from a clinical strain of Proteus mirabilis, which transferred low-level quinolone resistance but was negative by PCR for the known qnr genes. Plasmid pHS9 was transferred to azideresistant E. coli J53 by conjugation. The plasmid was digested by HindIII and a fragment containing the new gene was cloned into plasmid puc18 and sequenced. The ciprofloxacin MICs for clinical and transconjugant strains were determined by Etest. Results: The strain of P. mirabilis was isolated from an outpatient with a urinary tract infection. It was susceptible to most antimicrobials, but resistant to ampicillin and trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole. Ciprofloxacin MICs for the clinical strain, J53 R-, and a J53 pHS9 transconjugant were 0.25, 0.008, and 0.125 mg/ml, respectively. A 4.49-kb HindIII fragment of pHS9 was cloned into puc18, and recombinants were transformed into E. coli DH5alpha. Sequencing showed that the responsible 537-bp gene, designated qnrC, encoded a 178 amino acid protein. QnrC shared 67.6%, 48.0% and 63.1% amino acid identity with QnrA1, Qnr B1 and Qnr S1, respectively. An integrase-like gene and an amidase gene were found upstream and downstream from qnrC. Conclusion: A new quinolone resistance gene, qnrC, was characterised from plasmid pHS9 carried by a clinical isolate of P. mirabilis.O208 The overexpression of SdiA and SoxS is associated with the development of multiple antibiotic resistance induced by diazepam and haloperidol inEscherichia coli AG100 M.M.

The aim of this study was to report the frequency of CA-MRSA and the prevalence of Panton-Valentine leukocidine (PVL) among the children population as well as to determine the clinical, epidemiologic and molecular characteristics of these patients with community-acquired infections. Patients and Methods: We conducted a prospective study from January to November 2007. The study included all patients attended in the Paediatric Emergency Department (PED) with a S. aureus infection. All isolates underwent polymerase chain reaction analysis for the LPV gene. Molecular characterisation of LPV(+) isolates was performed using PFGE following DNA extraction with SmaI and multilocus sequence typing (MLST). Results: During the study period, S. aureus was detected in 58 samples taken from 53 children. They had a median age of 42 months (0-170 months), and 70% were boys. An MRSA was detected in 7 patients (13.2%). Forty six patients were tested for PVL genes, and a positive result was obtained in 12 (26%).The prevalence of LPV was 71% in the group of MRSA (5/7)and 18% in the MSSA group (7/39) Final diagnosis of patients comprised superficial infections 57%, cellulitis or abscess 31%, and deep infections 10%. A 33% of the children were admitted in the hospital and a 30% required drainage. Although no significant differences in clinical characteristics or classic risk factors were observed between CA-MRSA and CA-MSSA, we found significant differences related to the country of origin of the children: CA-MRSA isolates were more frequent isolated from children with an origin in Ecuador (44% vs. 7%; P = 0.002) and all of them belonged to the same ST 8 IV clone according to the PFGE and the results of MLST, whereas all the MSSA PVL(+) isolates belonged to different clones. Regarding to the epidemiologic characteristics, infections by isolates with and without PVL gene did not show significant differences but it is to mention that isolates with PVL gene were clearly associated with need of drainage (75% vs. 27%; P = 0.001). Conclusions: There is an emergence of a single clone (ST 8 IV) of the CA-MRSA infections among children in Madrid and is clearly associated with children with an origin in Ecuador. Infections with isolates PVL(+) required a more aggressive treatment with drainage as a result of the isolates' increased virulence.C.F. De Gascun, A. Waters, P. Holder, P.G. O'Reilly, J. Connell, S.J. Knowles, W.W. Hall (Dublin, IE)Objectives: Previous population studies have identified Ireland as having a low prevalence of CMV infection. However, the changing demographic has resulted in an increase in CMV seroprevalence; this may result in an increased risk of infection in susceptible pregnant women. The aim of this study is to determine if laboratory investigation of neonatal dried blood spots (DBS) collected on Guthrie cards can be used as the sole diagnostic approach to accurately identify cases of congenital CMV (cCMV) infection.Diagnosis of cCMV infection requires detection of CMV in the neonate in the first three weeks of life. Culture of CMV from urine remains the gold standard for the detection of live virus, although a definitive diagnosis by traditional culture may take up to three weeks. More rapid results can be obtained through the complementary use of urinary DEAFF (detection of early antigenic fluorescent foci) testing. Advances in molecular methods have resulted in a move away from DEAFF/culture to the detection of CMV DNA by PCR in urine samples or DBS. PCR testing may be supplemented with serology for CMV specific IgM. Methods: We conducted a retrospective review of all neonates from the three Dublin maternity hospitals clinically diagnosed with cCMV infection over a three year period, 2004 to 2007. All testing was performed in a single specialist virology centre, the National Virus Reference Lab (NVRL), which provides serological, molecular (PCR) and cell culture methods (traditional & DEAFF) for the diagnosis of cCMV in the Republic of Ireland. Of note, there is no national screening programme for cCMV. Results: Thirty-two children were diagnosed with cCMV in Dublin over the period studied. Thirty-one of 32 (97%) children were urinary DEAFF test positive; 17/31 (55%) were culture positive; 12/26 (46%) were IgM positive; 8/13 (62%) were CMV DNA positive in blood. Eighteen of 28 (64%) neonates were positive in blood for either CMV DNA or IgM; 2/11 (18%) were positive for both DNA and IgM. If the only test offered were PCR for CMV DNA in DBS, 38% of children would not have been diagnosed.Conclusions: This study illustrates that DBS testing alone is not an adequate strategy for the clinical diagnosis of, or as a screening tool for, cCMV infection in a low seroprevalence population. DBS testing provides virological data of prognostic value in those neonates known to be CMV infected, but it lacks the sensitivity required to be a satisfactory screening test.O212 Human Bocavirus quantitative DNA detection and phylogenetic analysis in children hospitalised for acute bronchiolitis L.

Hermans,  J.H. de Waard (Caracas, VE; Boston, US; Nijmegen, NL)    Background: We evaluated pneumococcal carriage rates in children from a geographically very isolated indigenous population, only reachable by plane, that was struck by an outbreak with the clinical criteria that met a bacterial acute respiratory tract infection (ARTI), affecting more than 70% of all the members of the community. Objective: To evaluate the carriage rates and the serotype/genotype distribution of S. pneumoniae strains isolated before, during and after the ARTI outbreak.Methods:The community consists of about 900 people with 150 younger than 5 years old. Contact with other indigenous communities is rare. Nasopharyngeal swabs were cultured from 321 children aged 3\u221284 months before (October 2004: n = 118), during (November 2005; n = 123) and after (March 2006: n = 80) the outbreak. The S. pneumoniae isolates were serotyped with the Quellung reaction, genotyped by restriction fragment end labelling (RFEL) analysis, and their susceptibility to antibiotics was assessed by disk diffusion. Result: In total, 117 pneumococcal strains were isolated and carriage rates in the three time periods before, during and after the ARTI outbreak were 16%, 60% and 32%, respectively. 83% (95/115) of the children under 5 years old was diagnosed with ARTI in the second time period of which 66% (63/95) was clinically classified as pneumonia. Before the outbreak the prevalent serotype was 6B (80%). The most prevalent capsular serotypes during outbreak were 6B (40.3%), 9V (13.4%) and 15B (13.4%), and 18C (10.5%). The latter 3 serotypes were not present before the outbreak. After the outbreak, in the third sample period serotype 9V and 15B disappeared completely, and the other serotypes remained. RFEL analysis clustered all the serotypes isolated during the outbreak in very related genotypes; per serotype 1 cluster or a clade with at least 85% homology. All isolates were susceptible for the antibiotics tested with exception of TMPS harbouring 20.5% resistance. Conclusions: The increase in carriage rate during disease was mainly due to serotypes not isolated before the outbreak. Hence, we consider that the introduction of the new serotypes in the community might have been related to the outbreak of lower respiratory tract infections. The highly related genotypes found for all the serotypes indicate limited introduction of new serotypes and genotypes in this community. Future investigation should monitor the impact of a pneumococcal vaccine on disease incidence and strain substitution in this isolated community.Objective: Candida species are the most common agents of opportunistic mycoses, which are often associated with biofilms. Candida albicans and Candida tropicalis biofilms develop most frequently in intracardiac prosthetic devices and voice prostheses with an infection risk of 1\u22123% and 50-100%, respectively. In natural environments polymicrobial biofilms are observed, but interactions between organisms are not well understood. This study focused on the evaluation of the effect of recently characterised C. albicans alcohols signalling molecules, in C. tropicalis regarding two hypothetical clinical scenarios: C. tropicalis, adhered and within a mature biofilm. Methods: All experiments were performed in RPMI medium and cells (initial cell density of 1\u00d710 6 cells/ml) grown at 37\u00baC, 130 rpm. For all experiments, endpoints were determined at the end of 24 h. C. tropicalis ATCC 750 biofilms were developed on the surface of microtriter plates. C. albicans CECT 1472 secreted alcohols were added after 3 h of adhesion or to 48 h grown biofilms. Isoamylalcohol, 2-phenylethanol, 1-dodecanol, nerolidol, farnesol and tyrosol were independently assayed at physiological levels. Biofilm quantification was performed using two different approaches: total biomass by crystal violet staining and quantification of biofilm cells activity by the reduction of a tetrazolium salt (XTT). Results: At initial biofilm stages C. tropicalis metabolic cell activity was significantly decreased by isoamylalcohol, 2-phenylethanol, E-nerolidol and tyrosol treatments, while cellular mass was positively affected by isoamylalcohol but negatively by E-nerolidol. Nevertheless, mature biofilms were more resistant to the action of these alcohols. Specifically, only isoamylalcohol induced alterations, with the same response pattern observed at earlier stages. Conclusion: Results obtained show that C. albicans extracellular alcohols regulate C. tropicalis behaviour, depending on biofilm growth time, suggesting that C. tropicalis mature biofilms are more resistance to C. albicans signalling crosstalk.O216 A novel Staphylococcus aureus biofilm phenotype mediated by the fibronectin-binding proteins, FnBPA and FnBPBE.O'Neill, C.

Dorrell (Bangkok, TH; London, UK)    Objectives: The gastric pathogen Helicobacter pylori is shown to have alternate life style as a biofilm. In human infection, a presence of mature biofilm attached to cell surface has been shown and hypothesised that H. pylori infections resulting in gastric ulcers may be a manifestation of biofilm. Flagella have been considered to have a possible role during initial step of biofilm formation. Here we have investigated roles of three flagellar genes, including the flaA gene encoding flagellin protein, the flgR regulatory gene and the fliQ export apparatus gene, in the production of biofilm and control of adherence in H. pylori. The effect of curcumin against H. pylori biofilm formation and adherence to the human cancer cells has also been investigated. Methods: Isogenic flaA, flgR, and fliQ mutants were constructed from H. pylori wild-type 26695 and N6 by inverse PCR mutagenesis. A minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) of curcumin (diferuloymethane) against H. pylori was determined using agar dilution technique. The ability to form biofilm in liquid culture and on glass surface, and adhere to the HEp-2 cells was examined in vitro in a presence of curcumin compared to the controls. Results: Two different types of biofilm were observed in this study, including pellicle and attached biofilm. The wild-type H. pylori 26695 and N6 strains formed biofilm and adhered to HEp-2 cells more efficiently than the isogenic mutants, including flaA mutants; PA315 and NA2, flgR mutants; PR611and NR, and fliQ mutants; PQ and NQ. These results indicate that these genes are involved in the biofilm formation and adhesion of H. pylori. Our results showed that curcumin not only inhibited bacterial growth, but also greatly decreased the number of biofilm formation and the ability to adhere to the HEP-2 cells. Conclusion: We have demonstrated that H. pylori in monoculture can form biofilm. It attached to a glass surface and formed a pellicle at airliquid interface. Flagellar components were found to be important for biofilm formation on abiotic glass surface, pellicle formation in liquid culture, and adherence to HEp-2 cells.

Besides other factors, such as the availability of DNA in the natural environment and the competence state of the cells, one cause that could account for the low frequency of the FqR recombinant isolates is the fitness cost imposed by the DNA interchange that often implies the acquisition of larger parE-parC intergenic regions. A parallel study of transcription of parE-parC and of the fitness cost of 24 isogenic FqR strains derived from R6 was performed. Six first-level transformants were obtained either with PCR-products containing parCQRDRs of SPN FqR point mutants or with a PCR-product carrying parEQRDR-ant-parCQRDR from a FqR SMG isolate. The latter yielded two strains, T6 and T11, carrying parCQRDR and parEQRDR-ant-parCQRDR, respectively. The first-level transformants were used as recipients in further transformations with gyrAQRDRs PCR products to obtain 18 second-level transformants. RT-PCR experiments showed cotranscription for parE and parC in R6, T6 and T11, and a single promoter located 5 of parE was identified in R6 by primer extension. Fitness of transformants were estimated by pairwise competition with R6 in both 1-cycle and 2-cycle experiments. In 1-cycle experiments, only strains carrying the GyrAE85K change showed fitness cost, with the exception of recombinant T14. In 2-cycle experiments, cost was observed in first-level transformants carrying FqR changes S79F, S79Y, D83Y and GyrA E85K, with the exception of recombinants T6 and T11. Results suggest that there is no impediment due to fitness cost for the spreading of recombinant FqR SPN isolates, since some recombinants exhibited a compensation of the cost.",

Our data showed that MICON demonstrated a potent inhibitory activity against all of the recent C. albicans or non-albicans isolates tested, including those with known FLU resistance.

Attali (Paris, FR)Despite the recommendations of international guidelines, topical antifungal agents are hardly used in the treatment of oropharyngeal candidiasis (OPC) in immunocompromised (IC) patients because of the need for 4 to 6 daily dosing, poor taste acceptance that compromise patient compliance and lessen efficacy.The pharmacokinetic of once daily miconazole 50mg mucoadhesive buccal tablet (MBT) (Loramyc \u00ae ) was compared to that of miconazole 375mg gel administered in three divided doses in 18 healthy volunteers. Salivary miconazole concentrations after MBT application were higher (15.1\u00b116.2mg/ml) than those of miconazole gel (1.6\u00b1 1.6mg/ml, p < 0.001) and persisted over the MIC (1 mg/ml) for 13.4\u00b15.2 hours vs 1.2\u00b12.6h (p < 0.001). Miconazole plasma concentrations were rarely detected with MBT (5/162 samples vs 10/162 with gel). Finally, 17 of 18 volunteers preferred miconazole MBT. Twenty five HIV+ patients with documented OPC were enrolled in a group-sequential dose-adaptative trial with stopping rules and treated with MBT once daily for 14 days. The trial was halted prematurely according to the predefined stopping rules because of higher than expected efficacy. Clinical success was observed in 84% of patients with 52% complete response. Clinical cure was obtained in 52%. Relapses within 30 days post treatment (32%) only occurred in untreated or uncontrolled HIV+ patients. Plasma miconazole concentrations were not detected. Single daily dose of miconazole 50mg MBT or miconazole 500mg oral gel (MOG) administered in 4 divided doses for 14 days were randomly allocated to 282 head and neck cancer patients with documented OPC. The success rate was statistically not inferior in the MBT group to that observed in the MOG group (56% vs 49%) with complete response in 52.5% vs 45.4% of patients respectively. After adjustment for the extent of lesions and salivary secretions because of an uneven distribution of patients at baseline in favour of MOG, a trend toward superiority was observed in favour of MBT (p = 0.13), particularly among patients with multiple lesions (p = 0.013). Clinical cure was obtained in 39%. Relapses at 45 days post treatment were observed in around 20% (p=NS).In both trials MBT adhered for more than 6 hours in more than 90% of applications. MBT was well tolerated. These trials demonstrated that once daily miconazole MBT is an efficacious, safe and well accepted topical treatment of OPC in IC patients. The reduction in drug dose precludes the risk of systemic exposure, of drug-drug interactions and liver toxicity.",

Walsh (Bethesda,  US; Thessaloniki, GR)    Objectives: Previous studies of polymorphonuclear leukocyte (PMN)induced hyphal damage (HD) of filamentous fungi have used the effectortarget (E:T) ratio as the only variable for assessment or comparison of results. However, we hypothesised that the overall hyphal biomass of organism may also be an important determinant in host-pathogen interaction. We therefore investigated the effect of fungal biomass on PMN-induced HD. Methods: An inoculum of 2\u00d710 4 conidia/ml of one isolate each of Aspergillus fumigatus, Aspergillus flavus, Aspergillus terreus, Rhizopus oryzae, Rhizopus microsporus, Cunninghamella bertholletiae, Scedosporium prolificans and Fusarium solani was incubated for 6 oneto two-hourly different time periods in order to yield biomass values ranging between 0.01\u22120.1 optical density (OD, measured at 405 nm). PMNs from healthy volunteers were then added at E:T ratios of 5:1, 10:1, 20:1, 50:1 and 100:1, and HD was assessed by XTT metabolic assay. For each E:T ratio, the relationship between HD and OD was studied using nonlinear regression analysis. Results: HD decreased with increasing biomass following a sigmoid pattern described with the Emax model (median R 2 : 0.87). HD at 0.01 OD exceeded HD at 0.1 OD (P < 0.01 for all E:T ratios) by >2-fold in 64 of 80 comparisons (8 isolates x 5 E:T ratios x 2 replicate experiments). The sigmoid curves were shifted to the right with higher E:T ratios; the EC50 values (i.e., the model-derived OD at which HD is reduced half-way between the maximum and minimum HD values for a given E:T ratio and isolate) obtained for 50:1 or 100:1 were higher than those obtained for 5:1 (P < 0.01). Using the same E:T ratio, interspecies differences were observed;for 5:1, lower EC50 values were obtained for A. flavus and the three zygomycete species. Conclusion: PMN-induced HD decreases with increasing biomass at rates that are species-dependent and that decrease with higher E:T ratios. This biomass effect may have important implications for understanding systemic host defences and can be a useful factor in the design and interpretation of studies of PMN-induced HD of filamentous fungi. O450 Development of a nested PCR assay for the detection of Fusarium solani DNA and its evaluation in the diagnosis of invasive fusariosis using an experimental mouse model Z. Khan, S. Ahmad, A. Theyyathel (Kuwait, KW) Objective: The Fusarium species are common environmental fungi that enter the body through the lungs or through a cutaneous source and disseminate through the bloodstream in immunosuppressed/immunocompromised patients. Fusariosis is now the second most common mould infection in immunocompromised patients and Fusarium solani accounts for nearly half of these infections. The aim of this study was to develop a specific nested PCR (nPCR) assay for the detection of F. solani DNA in culture and in clinical specimens. Methods: The nPCR assay was developed by using genomic DNA isolated from Fusarium species and from other common pathogenic and environmental fungi. The nPCR assay was evaluated by using DNA isolated from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) and serum samples from mice infected intravenously with F. solani conidia and sacrificed on day 1 and then on every third day up to 25 days post-infection. The lung homogenate, BAL and blood samples were also cultured for F. solani. Results: The nPCR assay was specific for F. solani and the lower limit of detection was 450 fg of template DNA corresponding roughly to 11 F. solani cells. Cultures of lung homogenate of infected animals up to day 16 yielded F. solani with decreasing fungal load and were negative thereafter. The nPCR positivity in BAL was 100% concordant with culture results. Although detection of F. solani DNA in serum was less sensitive than in BAL, it could be detected for longer duration, i.e. up to 22 days. Conclusions: We have developed a sensitive and specific nPCR assay for the detection of F. solani DNA. Our data from experimental mouse model show that detection of DNA in BAL and to a lesser extent in serum by nPCR offers a sensitive and specific diagnostic approach for invasive F. solani infection.

O451 Detection of Aspergillus DNA by a nested PCR assay with high sensitivity and specificity rates is able to improve the diagnosis of invasive aspergillosis in paediatric patients M. Hummel, B. Spiess, J. Roder, G. von Komorowski, M. Duerken, K. Kentouche, H. Laws, H. Moerz, D. Buchheidt (Mannheim, Jena, Dusseldorf, DE) Background. Fungal infections are a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in severely immunocompromised patients with an increasing incidence in recent years. IA is the most common filamentous fungal infection and is, in adults as well as in children, difficult to diagnose. To improve the outcome of patients with invasive aspergillosis (IA), early diagnosis and treatment initiation is crucial. Several PCR assays to detect Aspergillus DNA have been established, but so far, studies on molecular tools for the diagnosis of IA in children are few. We evaluated the results of a nested PCR assay to detect Aspergillus DNA in clinical samples from paediatric and adolescent patients with suspected IA. Methods. Blood and non-blood samples from immunocompromised paediatric and adolescent patients with suspected invasive fungal infection were sent for processing Aspergillus polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to our laboratory and investigated with our previously described nested PCR assay. PCR results from consecutive patients from three university children hospitals investigated between November 2000 and January 2007 were evaluated. Fungal infections were classified according to the EORTC classification on the grounds of clinical findings, microbiology and radio-imaging results. Results. 291 samples from 71 patients were investigated for the presence of Aspergillus DNA by our previously described nested PCR assay. Two, 3 and 34 patients had proven, probable and possible IA, respectively. Aspergillus DNA was detected in blood, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples. Sensitivity and specificity rates of the PCR assay were 80 and 81%, respectively Conclusion. Our nested PCR assay is able to detect Aspergillus DNA in blood, CSF and BAL samples from paediatric and adolescent patients with IA with high sensitivity and specificity rates. PCR for Aspergillus DNA contributes essentially to improve the diagnosis of IA. O452 Surveillance of aspergillosis by galactomannan testing, culture and histopathology in lung transplant recipients M.C. Arendrup, K.L. Mortensen, M. Iversen, N. Milman (Copenhagen, DK) Background: The clinical utility of Aspergillus galactomannan detection (GM) in bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid for the diagnosis of aspergillosis in lung transplant recipients has recently been described. Methods: 68 paired BAL fluid and serum samples from consecutive lung transplant recipients undergoing routine bronchoscopy were prospectively analysed for GM and results compared with culture, imaging and histopathology. Underlying diseases were chronic obstructive pulmonary disease in 24 patients, cystic fibrosis in 19, sarcoidosis in 10, alpha-1-antitrypsin deficiency in 8, pulmonal fibrosis in 8, and others in 2 patients. Patients were classified according to clinical findings during the bronchoscopy as having high risk for aspergillosis (patches involving the site of anastomosis and the airways of the lung), medium risk (patches restricted to the site of anastomosis) or low risk (no or minor patches at the site of anastomosis). Results: A total of 68 BAL fluids from 51 recipients of single (37) or double (31) lung tranplants were investigated. 12 patients were classified as high risk patients (18%), 17 as medium (25%) and 39 as low risk patients for aspergillosis (57%). In 22/68 cases (32%) the patient received antifungal prophylaxis, which in 21/22 cases was voriconazole and in 1 case caspofungin. The GM index in BAL fluid was >0.5 in 5/68 cases (2/39 low risk (5%), 2/17 medium risk (12%) and 1/12 high risk (8%) cases). 4 of these 5 patients were recipients of double lung transplants. In 2 cases the GM index was >0.7 (1 medium (6%) and 1 high risk patients (8%), both double lung transplant recipients) and in 1 >1.0 (high risk episode in double lung transplant recipient). No patients had positive GM in serum at any time. Six patients had a positive BAL fluid culture for aspergillus, none of whom had positive GM and 4 of whom were classified as low risk patients. Five patients had histopathological findings suggestive for aspergillus 4 of whom were classified as high risk patients. The BAL GM index in these patients was 1, 0.4, 0.3, 0.3 and 0.1 and none had positive cultures from the BAL fluid. Conclusions: In the setting of lung transplant recipient with a frequent use of anti-aspergillus prophylaxis, BAL fluid GM appeared to correlate better with the clinical risk classification than culture, but not as good as histopathology. BAL fluid GM testing can not be regarded as a stand alone test in this setting. O453 Fungiscope -the Global Rare Fungal Infection Registry M.J. Rueping, J.J. Vehreschild, C. Beisel, U. Auerbach, C. Mueller, C. Wickenhauser, O. Cornely (Cologne, DE) Introduction: The incidence of invasive fungal infections increases worldwide, and rare fungi -neither belonging to the genera Aspergillus, Candida, Pneumocystis or Cryptococcus, nor being endemic, such as Histoplasma spp. or Coccidioides spp. -are increasingly identified as causative pathogens. Methods: We are coordinating a global registry for cases of rare invasive fungi. Our objective is to broaden the knowledge on epidemiology, to determine the clinical pattern of disease, to describe and improve diagnostic procedures and therapeutic regimens, as well as to facilitate exchange of clinical isolates among the contributors. Entry of retrospective data occurs via a web-based registration system (MACRO) that focuses on demographic information, underlying diseases, risk factors, details on the infection (pathogen, localisation, specimen collection) therapy and outcome. Inclusion criteria include cultural, histopathological, antigen, or DNA evidence of invasive fungal infection. Infection due to Aspergillus spp., Candida spp., Cryptococcus neoformans, Pneumocystis jirovecii or any endemic fungal infection, such as coccidioidomycosis or histoplasmosis, as well as mere colonisation or other non-invasive infection are exclusion criteria. Each subset of this cohort will be published at a time. Authorship will be restricted to those centres, contributing patients or translational work to the subset. For evaluable patient documentations filled in by the participating centre a compensation of \u20ac 100 each will be paid. For isolates made available to the central laboratory an additional \u20ac 50 will be paid. Results: By now, 28 cases of rare invasive fungal infections have been identified, including Absidia corymbifera, Cunninghamella bertholletiae, Penicillium marneffei, Rhizomucor pusillus, as well as Acremonium spp., Fusarium spp., Coccidioides spp., and Trichoderma spp. Clinical results are partly pending. Most patients were in an immunocompromised state as a result of their underlying disease, chemotherapy or transplantation. Discussion: The clinical relevance of invasive fungal infections by rare fungi is increasing steadily. In a short period of time, actual cases from Germany, Austria, Italy and the United Kingdom could be documented, showing the broad spectrum of pathogens. Further investigators and coordinators are cordially invited to contribute to the success of Fungiscope. O454 Candidiasis in patients with haematological malignancies, in a tertiary care cancer centre (2001-2007): stable incidence but changing epidemiology of a still frequently lethal infection N.V. Sipsas, R.E. Lewis, D.P. Kontoyiannis (Houston, US)Objective: In the era of ever expanding anti-Candida armamentarium, there has not been recent large series on the incidence, microbiology, resistance patterns of candidiasis in high risk patients with hematologic malignancy and or stem cell transplantation.Methods:We retrospectively reviewed the records of adult patients with candidaemia and or candidiasis (EORTC criteria), treated for hematological malignancies(March 2001-February 2007. Demographic characteristics, clinical and microbiological data, outcomes, as well as MIC of antifungal agents (CLSI method), were recorded. Results: A total of 173 episodes of candidaemia (170 patients) were analysed. C. albicans and C. parapsilosis were isolated most commonly (25% and 24% respectively). However, frequently azoleresistant Candida species such as C. glabrata or C. krusei accounted for only 22% of all episodes (5% and 17% respectively). The incidence of candidaemia (per 100.000 inpatient days) remained relatively stable from 13.9 in 2001 to19.2 in 2006 (p=NS). 72% of episodes were breakthrough candidiasis to prior antifungal prophylaxis. Twenty five percent of the 173 isolates were resistant to fluconazole (67% of C. glabrata, or 6 out of 9 isolates), and 7% resistant to voriconazole. Of the 59 Candida isolates with caspofungin MICs, 4 (7%) had an MIC > 2. In contrast, resistance to amphotericin B (MIC > 2) was uncommon (1%). There was no trend in prevalent Candida species or patterns of resistance over the study period. Overall 30 day mortality was 38% and the 30 day attributable mortality was 17%. Factors associated significantly 30-day overall mortality (multivariate analysis) were age >50 years, intercurrent infection and neutrophil count <100/ml at diagnosis of candidiasis; for 30-day attributable mortality age >50 years and sustained candidaemia.The Candida species associated with the highest mortality (44%) was C. glabrata. Conclusion: Despite widespread use of antifungal prophylaxis in high risk hematology patients, the incidence of candidiasis remained stable. More over, breakthrough infections, frequent in vitro resistance (especially to fluconazole), the predominance of non-albicans Candida species and high crude mortality continue to pose significant challenges.O455 Epidemiology, management and risk factors for death of invasiveCandida infections in critical care units: a multicentre, prospective, observational study in France (2005-2006) O.

Leroy for the AmarCand Study Group Objective: To describe the evolving epidemiology, management and risk factors for death of invasive Candida spp. infections in intensive care units (ICUs) in France Methods: This country-based, prospective, observational study (Amar-Cand study) was carried out in 101 ICUs. 271 adult patients with proven invasive Candida spp. infection who received a systemic antifungal therapy were included between October 2005 and May 2006. Results: The study included 107 (39.5%) patients with isolated candidaemia, 87 (32.1%) with invasive candidiasis without candidaemia, and 77 (28.4%) with invasive candidiasis and candidaemia. With regards to risk factors, 76% of patients had mechanical ventilation, 97% were catheterised, 59% had had prior antibiotherapy, 21% were immunocompromised, and 34% had a malignancy. C. albicans accounted for 57.0% of the causative species, followed by C. glabrata (16.7%), C. parapsilosis (7.5%), C. krusei (5.2%) and C. tropicalis (4.9%). In 17.1% of the cases, the causative species was less susceptible or resistant to fluconazole. Fluconazole was the empiric treatment most commonly initiated (65.7%), followed by caspofungin (18.1%), voriconazole (5.5%), or amphotericin B (3.3%). The case fatality ratio at the end of ICU stay was 45.9%. Multivariate analysis showed that factors independently associated with death in ICU were: diabetes mellitus (odds ratio [OR] 4.51, 95% confidence interval [CI] 1.72\u221211.79, p = 0.The AmarCand study results show that 68% of patients with systemic candidiasis in ICU present with candidaemia. C. albicans remains the most frequent causative species. Reduced susceptibility to fluconazole is observed in a large number of Candida spp. isolates. 84% of ICU adult patients receive fluconazole or caspofungin as first line therapy and mortality of invasive candidiasis in ICU remains dramatically elevated.

Relative risks (RR) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were pooled.Results: Fifteen trials were included, 9 of which compared fluconazole to any other drug (amphotericin B, itraconazole, or combination of fluconazole and amphotericin B), 4 compared echinocandins to other drugs (fluconazole, amphotericin B, liposomal amphotericin B), one compared between micafungin and caspofungin, and one compared between amphotericin B plus fluconazole and voriconazole. There was no difference in mortality when fluconazole was compared to amphotericin B (RR 0.92 [95%CI 0.73\u22121.17], although there was an increase in microbiological failure in the fluconazole arm (RR 1.77 [95%CI 1.18\u22122.65]. Anidulafungin decreased microbiological failure compared with fluconazole (RR 0.50 [95% CI 0.29\u22120.86]) and with less adverse events. Caspofungin was comparable to amphotericin B in mortality and efficacy but with less adverse events (RR 0.56 [95% CI 0.44\u22120.71]. Micafungin was comparable to liposomal amphotericin B in mortality and between micafungin and caspofungin demonstrated no significant differences in efficacy or adverse events.Figure 1. Microbiological Failure for trials comparing fluconazole vs. any other antifungal drug.Conclusions: Currently available data support either fluconazole, amphotericin B and all echinocandins for primary treatment of IC. For empiric treatment in areas with a high prevalence of non-albicans Candida species, echinocandins should be considered as first line. When the isolate is identified, fluconazole may still be considered as first line therapy for Candida albicans, while echinocandins, liposomal amphotericin B or amphotericin B should be chosen for the non-albicans Candida species.O458 Conversion of intravenous echinocandins to oral azoles for invasive candidiasis: impact on outcomes and resource utilisationS.Davis, A.

Kuijper (Bilthoven, Leiden, Amersfoort, NL) Objectives: In 2005, outbreaks of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea (CDAD) with the hypervirulent PCR ribotype 027 / toxinotype III were first reported in The Netherlands. C. difficile PCR ribotype 027 was already causing considerable problems in hospitals in the United States, Canada and England. Several investigations have shown an increase in morbidity and mortality and an increased relapsing rate for this type. Studies on risk factors at individual patient level showed an association with fluoroquinolones. Methods: The Centre for Infectious Disease Control at the National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (RIVM) set up a surveillance for CDAD in collaboration with the Leiden University Medical Center (LUMC). Hospitals are requested to send isolates or toxin positive faeces samples for typing, if they suspect type 027 based on an increased CDAD incidence or a severe clinical syndrome. From hospitals with an outbreak or transmission of type 027, information is collected, including monthly CDAD incidence. Results: Between February 2005 until half August 2007, 1886 samples have been typed, coming from 75 healthcare institutions. In 418 cases (22.2%), PCR ribotype 027 was found. PCR ribotypes 001 (17.8%), 014 (7.2%) and 078 (7.6%) were also frequently found. In 26 of the 97 Dutch hospitals, PCR ribotype 027 was present. In one of the hospitals, a simultaneous outbreak occurred with a second ribotype (017). In 13 of the 26 hospitals, 027 occurred in isolated cases only, without further transmission in the institution or an increased incidence of CDAD. In the other 13 hospitals, the incidence was increased. PCR ribotype 027 has also been detected in 10 nursinghomes. In eight of 11 hospitals where ribotype 027 was present in 2005 or 2006 and an outbreak occurred, no ribotype 027 was found anymore since April, 2007. One hospital that had the epidemic well under control for a long time was faced with a new increase in incidence. Other PCR ribotypes appear to increase in The Netherlands and some of these types such as type 078 have the same virulence factors as type 027.Conclusion: PCR ribotype 027 continues to spread in our country. Introduction of 027 into a hospital does not always cause outbreaks, but may remain limited to one or a few isolated cases, without increase in CDAD incidence. Ribotype 027 caused new outbreaks in hospitals that appeared to have controlled the situation.O461 Lack of identified association between nosocomial CDAD and emergency department overcrowding and number of room changes J.Yang, B.

There has been a shift in trends with a rising number of cases being reported in low-risk populations, e.g. children and young peri-partum women. Our aim was to review the prevalence of C. difficile in the inpatient paediatric population presenting to a Children's Hospital within a University Hospitals Trust from 2000-2006 inclusive, and to further assess the data set for 2006. Methods: Patients were identified via Medical Microbiology databases. Patients ranging from greater than one-month to less than 14 years were included. Retrospective analysis of prospectively collected outcome data was then performed. Results: There has been an increase in the number of diagnosed paediatric CDAD cases over the last year. (A detailed breakdown is shown in the table attached). Further analysis of data for 2006 revealed 603 faecal samples were tested for C. difficile of which 33 samples were positive. Taking into account multiple samples testing for individual patients 22 patients were diagnosed with CDAD out of 335. Of the 22 positive patients there was no significant gender bias (Male:Female=10:12) and the median age was 3 years (range 2 months -13 years). For this cohort 117 samples were analysed ranging from 1\u221231 samples per patient over a time period of 1-331days. Only 54% of patients were found to be toxin positive on their first sample. A median period of 23days (range 2-102 days) was conceded prior to detection of C. difficile toxin, from the time of their first negative sample being assessed to the ultimate positive sample, a median of 3 (range 2\u22126) samples was sent prior to detection. 23% of positive patients had CDAD re-diagnosed on subsequent samples following a negative sample.

Vandenesch (Lyon, FR)Community-acquired meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (CA-MRSA) was first described in Europe at the beginning of this decade, and since 2003 an impressive worldwide spread of Panton Valentine leukocidin (PVL)-positive CA-MRSA clones has been observed. Continuous surveillance of CA-MRSA organised by the French National Reference Center for Staphylococci has revealed a number of significant trends enumerated below:\u2022 The spread of previously continent-specific clones of CA-MRSA to other continents. Schematically in 2003, ST80 was detected in Europe, ST8 (USA300) and ST1 (USA400) in the USA, and ST30 in Oceania.In 2006, intercontinental exchanges of several clones were observed: the ST8 clone from the USA towards Europe; the ST1 clone from the USA towards Europe and Asia; the ST59 clone (USA1000) from the USA towards Asia; and the ST80 clone from Europe towards Asia. \u2022 The spread of PVL-positive CA-MRSA from country to country. For instance, in Europe, PVL-positive CA-MRSA of ST80 was recently detected in Slovenia, Romania, and Croatia. \u2022 New PVL-positive CA-MRSA clones emerging with different genetic backgrounds. While most of the clones described in 2003 had an agr3 background, the newly described clones are agr1 or agr2. Clone ST22 (agr1) has been found in Europe only, and clone ST377 (agr1 with a type V SCCmec) was reported simultaneously in Europe and Australia. \u2022 PVL-positive CA-MRSA, which were initially susceptible to most anti-staphylococcal agents, have acquired new antimicrobial resistance determinants, for example, to gentamicin and ofloxacin.\u2022 In contrast to the USA, where CA-MRSA now accounts for the majority of S. aureus infections in the community, the prevalence of PVL-positive CA-MRSA remains low in Northern Europe. However, Southern European countries, such as Greece, and countries located at the southern boundaries of Europe, such as Algeria, have a greater prevalence of PVL-positive CA-MRSA. \u2022 In countries of high prevalence, PVL-positive CA-MRSA are responsible for an increasing number of hospital-acquired infections. \u2022 Sequence variations of PVL among the different clones have been observed.

Low (Toronto, CA)    Meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) was first described in the 1960s as a source of healthcare-associated (HA) infections. In the United States (U.S.), the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System reported a 12% increase in MRSA infections in 2003, compared with the prevalence noted from 1998 to 2002. Now >63% of all S. aureus isolates recovered from critically ill patients are MRSA and are prevalent in all regions of the U.S. Additionally, MRSA now represents a worldwide problem, with the pathogen increasingly noted in Europe and Asia. Initially, infections with this organism were seen almost exclusively in people with significant healthcare exposure. The first reports of MRSA infections among healthy persons without identifiable risk factors for HA infections were published in the 1980s. MRSA emerged as a more widespread cause of community-associated (CA) infections in the late 1990s. A comparison of CA-MRSA versus HA-MRSA reported that skin and soft tissue and otitis media infections were disproportionately due to CA-MRSA, compared with respiratory tract and urinary tract infections.

Methods: A prevalence survey in 51 Dutch hospitals from July 2006 to January 2007 (3 months retrospectively and 3 months prospectively), monitoring all patients and healthcare workers (HCWs; only in postexposure surveys) screened for and identified with ST398 or other MRSA strains (including several clinical characteristics) was carried out. Participating hospitals were divided into tertiles based on pig-density in the catchment area. Results: During 306 months of observation 7802 patients were screened; 12% (642/5543) because of a risk factor for ST398 (79% out-patient department). Of the 498 new MRSA patients identified (65% with screening; 35% unexpected carriers) 31% carried ST398 MRSA (92% detected through screening). The overall prevalence of MRSA in the screened population was 3.6% (95%-BI: 3.2\u22124.0). Prevalence were 2.5% (95%-BI: 1.9\u22123.1), 3.8% (95%-BI: 3.1\u22124.5; p = 0.007) and 4.6% (95%-BI: 3.7\u22125.5; p = 0.000), respectively, in low, moderate and high pig density region hospitals. Prevalence of ST398 MRSA was 12.4% in patients screened in hospitals in regions with a high or moderate pig density and 0% in hospitals in regions with a low pig density. The prevalence of other MRSA isolates in patients screened in these hospitals was between 1.1\u22122.9%. In post-exposure screenings, unrelated ST398 MRSA carriers (index case had different genotype) were found in 0.06% (3/4794) of HCWs and none of the patients (0/1951). Other MRSA isolates (genotype different from index case and excluding ST398) were detected in 0.1% (8/5758) of HCWs and 0.5% (10/2134) of patients. Conclusion: In this first large survey of ST398 MRSA in Dutch hospitals we found that MRSA is more prevalent in regions with a high or moderate pig density, solely because of an increase of ST398 MRSA. Almost 80% of new carriers are detected in out-patient departments and 92% because of active surveillance. ST398 MRSA colonisation is rarely encountered in HCWs and patients during post-exposure screenings of index cases with different genotypes.O511 Enterotoxic meticillin-resistantStaphylococcus aureus: prevention and control Y.

Mean pair-wise genetic distances in TN and TE populations in IN region of CRF06 cpx viruses were similar, 0.014 and 0.016, respectively. In TN population 43 integrase inhibitor DRMs were described, of which the following ones occurred with the highest frequency: V72I in 92%, L74I in 100%, V201I in 97% and T206S in 96% of cases. The amino acid distributions in CRF06 cpx viruses at any position of IN region in treated and naive patients were similar. The DDE and HHCC site residues were absolutely conserved in all populations.

We have repeated previous surveillance for MET and vancomycin resistance in common C. difficile ribotypes. Methods: We screened recently isolated (2005) (2006) CD strains from symptomatic patients in Leeds and compared these results with those from repeat testing of historic isolates (1995) (1996) (1997) (1998) (1999) (2000) (2001) . Isolates of CD ribotypes 001 (n = 87), 106 (n = 81), 027 (n = 48), the most common UK types, and 10 other prevalent ribotypes (n = 57) were examined initially using a spiral gradient endpoint (SGE) method. Isolates displaying a MET MIC 6 mg/L, as determined by SGE, were analysed further by agar incorporation (AI) and E-test methods. AI was carried out by CLSI, and also by culture in pre-reduced Schaedler's anaerobic broth at 37\u00baC for 48 h, followed by multipoint inoculation of 104 cfu per spot onto Wilkins-Chalgren agar and anaerobic culture at 37oC for 48 h. Isolates were further characterised by multi-locus-variable-tandemrepeat-analysis (MLVA) to determine clonal relatedness. Results: No reduced susceptibility to vancomycin was observed. All CD ribotype 106 or 027 isolates were fully susceptible to MET (MICs <2 mg/L). However, 21 (24%) CD ribotype 001 isolates had reduced susceptibility to MET by SGE (geometric mean MIC was 3.5 mg/L (P < 0.001). Results varied according to the method used, and both the agar base and broth used to prepare inocula affected the MET MIC values for CD. Neither E-test nor CLSI methods detected the CD strains with reduced susceptibility to MET, but this was confirmed by the alternative AI method. The geometric mean MICs of CD ribotype 001 isolates from 1995-2001 (n = 72) and those identified by SGE with reduced susceptibility to MET (n = 21) were 1.03 and 5.9 mg/L, respectively (P < 0.001).

Increased vigilance is needed to identify reduced antibiotic susceptibility in CD, and to detect increased treatment failure associated with MET. Objectives: Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD) is an increasing nosocomial problem. Treatment with vancomycin (V) or metronidazole (M) is associated with incomplete response rates, frequent recurrences, and selection for resistant bacteria. In this study, the safety and efficacy of tolevamer (T) liquid (Genzyme, Cambridge MA), a novel non-antibiotic toxin binder, was compared to V and M. Methods: In this double-blind, multicentre (Europe, Australia, Canada) study in adult patients with acute CDAD appropriate for oral therapy, patients were randomised (2:1:1) to T 9g (3g tid, 14 days), V 500 mg (125mg qid, 10 days), or M 1500mg (375 mg qid, 10 days). In the T group, an initial 9 g loading dose was given. Patients were followed for recurrence 4 weeks after treatment cessation. The primary endpoint was non-inferiority of T vs. V for clinical success, defined as resolution of diarrhoea and absence of severe abdominal discomfort due to CDAD on Day 10.",

At enrollment, CDAD was noted as mild (31%), moderate (43%), or severe (25%), first occurrence (83%) or recurrent (17%), and was similar across the treatment groups. Clinical success rates were 42% (112/268) T, 81% (101/125) V, and 73% (99/135) M, indicating similar success rates in the V and M groups (p =0.153), but a lower T success rate than V or M (p 0.001 for both comparators).In patients with CDAD resolution sustained through the end of active treatment, the recurrence rates were 6% for T, 18% for V, and 19% for M. Adverse events were similar across treatment arms. Conclusion: T did not meet its primary endpoint of non-inferiority vs. V. Overall, V and M had similar responses. Recurrent CDAD occurred frequently with V and M, but was uncommon among those patients who resolved with T, suggesting that flora-sparing drugs may help reduce recurrences.

Fischer-Br\u00fcgge (Nordhorn, Hannover, DE; Leiden, NL) Objectives: To investigate the effects of antibiotic stewardship and infection control measures on the incidence rates of healthcare-onset CDAD in 18 hospitals and of community-onset CDAD. The incidence rates of MRSA, VRE and ESBL in the hospitals were used for comparison. Methods: Toxin-testing, cultivation, identification and PCR ribotyping of C. difficile, were performed according to standard procedures. Results: In 2005, eleven hospitals (group I) in the Southern subregion had increased CDAD incidence rates (11.6 patients/10,000 patient days), whereas 7 hospitals in the Northern subregion (group II) had no elevated CDAD incidence rates (4.0 patients/10,000 PD). PCR-ribotyping of isolated C. difficile strains revealed that more than 80% belonged to hyperendemic multiresistant strains (001, 046) in group I hospitals, whereas no predominant PCR ribotype was detected in group II hospitals. In 2006, interventions were made in group I hospitals: antibiotic stewardship, (5/11) and infection control measures (10/11). In group II hospitals only two hospitals introduced infection control measures. In 2007 group I hospitals achieved a significant reduction of CDAD (8/10,000 PD); group II hospitals showed a constant increase of CDAD (6/10,000 PD). No significant changes regarding to MRSA, VRE and ESBL incidence rates were observed, although group I hospitals had constantly higher MRSA incidence rates. Community-onset CDAD was rarely detected in 2005 (3.8/100,000 inhabitants). A change of the diagnostic algorithm for CDAD and the information of the general practitioners about CDAD led to an increase of community-onset CDAD in 2007 to 20/100,000 inhabitants. In the Northern subregion the number CO-CDAD patients were lower (11/100,000), than in the southern subregion (26/100,000 Conclusions: Intervention by antibiotic stewardship t (reduction of cephalosporins and fluoroquinolones) and infection control measures has led to an overall decrease of CDAD in hospitals with increased CDAD incidence rates. There was no significant association between CDAD incidence with the incidence rate of infections due to other multiresistant bacteria, although MRSA incidence rates were also high.O466 Comparison of disinfecting efficacy of Hydrogen peroxide-based dry mist system and hypochlorite 0.5% on Clostridium difficile contaminated surfaces D. Menuet, M. Verachten, E. Girou, F. Barbut (Paris, Cr\u00e9teil, FR) Background: During Clostridium difficile-associated diarrhoea (CDAD), a large number of spores disseminated in the patients' room. These spores may survive for weeks and are resistant to commonly used disinfectants.Objectives: To compare the disinfecting efficacy of hypochlorite 0.5% (currently recommended in France for disinfection of CDAD patients' environment) and hydrogen peroxide-based dry mist system (Sterinis \u00ae /Sterusil \u00ae , Gloster Sant\u00e9 Europe). Methods: The efficacy of both disinfectants was assessed in situ, in the rooms (n = 31) of patients with CDAD. A prospective study was performed in two French university hospitals from April to August 2007. At discharge, rooms were cleaned and randomised in two groups to compare the disinfection processes: the HPV group included rooms treated with 5% hydrogen peroxide-based dry mist system (1 cycle; 18 min. diffusion, 60 min. contact time) and the H group manually disinfected using 0.5% hypochlorite. Twelve environmental surfaces (100 cm2) were tested for C. difficile before and after disinfection, using moistened swabs that were inoculated on selective plates (taurocholate, cycloserine, cefoxitin agar) and broth. Both disinfectants were also tested in vitro on small pieces (4 cm2) of two different materials placed in empty rooms and experimentally contaminated by 10 6 spores of 3 different strains of C. difficile including the 027 clone. Spores were numbered before and after disinfection and the mean reduction factor of contamination was expressed as log10 UFC. Results: 748 surface samples were collected in the rooms of patients with CDAD. Before disinfection, the frequency of contamination was 24% and 19% in H and HPV groups, respectively (p = 0.2). After disinfection, a significant reduction of contamination was observed in both groups, with a relative higher level in the HPV (19% vs 2%) than the H group (24% vs 12%) (p < 0.005).Results of the in vitro study showed whatever the strains and materials used, a mean reduction factor of contamination significantly higher in the HPV than the H group (4.18\u00b10.79 vs 1.8\u00b10.81, p < 0.001).",

            "text": "The number of immunocompromised patients continues to rise globally promoting increase in the incidence and variety of life-threatening fungal infections. In addition, the epidemiology of invasive fungal infections (IFI) is changing; IFI such as aspergilloses, are increasingly reported in non-neutropenic paediatric and adult critically ill patients. As a result, there is pressing need to improve the accuracy and speed of diagnosis to proficiently support clinical decisions. Despite the recognised problematical nature of culture methods for the identification of fungi in clinical specimens, which rely on the isolate's phenotypic differences in morphology and physiology, and when possible on its ability of mating, the clinical value of culture-based diagnosis remains indisputable. Positive culture establishes the diagnosis of IFI and influences therapeutic options either through susceptibility testing or via accurate characterisation of mould isolates with inherent resistance to amphotericin B-eg. Scedosporium spp., A. terreus or A. nidulans. Microscopy of histological specimens, using fungal-specific stains, like Gomori's methenamine silver (GMS) complemented with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) can reveal fungal elements and tissue-fungus cellular interactions. Also, direct microscopy of wet potassium hydroxide mounts of biological fluids, and fluorescent microscopy with Calcofluor white, Uvitex 2B or Blankophor P, of either fresh clinical specimens, such as BAL and corneal specimens or paraffin-embedded tissue, provide rapid results on presence/absence of fungal elements. Although positive histology and direct microscopy are non-specific tests, since sporogenous structures are typically absent in human material, they nonetheless give a fast diagnostic clue to the presence of regularly or irregularly, septate, aseptate or rarely septate hyphae, dictate use of selective media for culture and justify administration of antifungal therapy. Furthermore, culture-based identification by morphological and physiological criteria is complex. In many taxa definitive phenotypic features are difficult to observe or are highly variable. Besides, most clinical isolates lack a sexual cycle and for many pathogens the concept of a species is still poorly defined. Consequently, there is compelling need for rapid, precise and reproducible molecular methods to identify clinical fungi. To effectively exploit the tremendous variation in the DNA of fungi in order to (a) determine the source of a fungal infection, (b) to resolve the status of certain established and emerging pathogenic species, (c) to track the transmission of strains in the hospital, (d) to recognise strains of specific virulence or resistance to antifungals, (e) to elucidate diversity and population genetics of fungal pathogens, and (d) to identify genotypes for use in drug research and diagnostics, the question \"to culture or not to culture\", even in the \". . . omics\" era, is purely rhetorical. Carriers were found in 25 farms from seven provinces of Flanders and Wallonia. The prevalence was independently associated with porcine MRSA carriage and the frequent contact with pigs, horses and dogs. MRSA carriage was associated with higher levels of personal protection and hygiene. By molecular typing, all isolates were resistant to SmaI digestion and belonged to ST398 with spa types t011 or t034 with SCCmec type IV or type V. MRSA strains were resistant to tetracycline (100%), trimethoprim (100%), MLS (>50%), aminoglycosides (>40%) and ciprofloxacin (32%). The MRSA strains from human shared the same characteristics as those found in pigs.",

Risk factors for MRSA colonisation included frequent contact with pigs and other farm animals and higher levels of protection and hygiene. MRSA strains from farmers and pigs belonged to the ST398 \"animal MRSA clone\" which has been reported in livestock animals, farmers and veterinarians in Europe. Results: Using MLST/SCCmec typing 38 \"ST8-MRSA-IVa\" isolated in WA were found to be PVL positive and had the same pulsed-field gel pattern and spa type (t008) as the USA300 MRSA clone. The majority of these isolates were from SST infections predominantly with abscess formation. Over 66% of patients were younger than 40 years. Thirty one of the strains were erythromycin resistant (EmR), with 87% clindamycin susceptible (inducible resistance not detected -unlike EmR WA CA-MRSA which are generally inducibly resistant to clindamycin). From January 2004 to October 2007 the number of isolates increased severalfold (from 4 to 17 cases per year) prompting public health concern. Conclusions: In the United States USA300 MRSA is not only the predominant cause of community acquired infection but is also rapidly emerging as a major cause of healthcare acquired infection. It is apparent that USA300 MRSA has entered the WA community. As a consequence the WA Health Department has recently commenced a \"Search and Destroy\" policy aimed at both this and other PVL positive imported the isolates belonged to CC17. Four sequence types were observed: ST78 (n = 8), ST19 (n = 3), ST192 (n = 3) and ST266 (n = 1). All these genotypes have been previously isolated from hospitalised patients. In particular, ST78 and its single-locus variant ST192 are among the most common STs in European hospitals. ST78 was isolated from a dog and 10-year old boy living in the same household, suggesting possible transmission between dogs and humans living in close contact. Resistance to erythromycin (97%), ciprofloxacin (95%), tetracycline (83%) or rifampicin (56%) was frequent. Only few isolates were resistant to gentamicin (5%), linezolid (14%) and quinopristin/dalfopristin (15%) and all were susceptible to vancomycin. Conclusion: This is the first report describing the occurrence of AREfm CC17 in dogs. The results suggest that dogs may contribute to the spread of this AREfm genetic lineage in the human population. The unexpected and widespread occurrence of hospital-adapted clones in dogs raises an important question concerning the evolution of this clonal complex: does CC17 originate from humans (anthropozoonosis) or from dogs (zooanthroponosis)? Canine AREfm are currently screened for putative virulence genes (esp, acm, hyl, orf903, orf905, orf907, orf2351 and orf2430) and the results of this screening will be used for discussing the evolutionary relationship between human and canine strains in the conference presentation.",

Methods: This observational study was conducted by including HIV-1 infected patients from 3 cohorts of ART initiation in a tertiary-care HIV clinic in Bangkok, Thailand, between January 2004 and October 2007. The medical records were reviewed; demographic data, baseline CD4 and HIV-1 RNA, ART regimen, and date and test results of HBV surface antigen for HBV infection and Anti-HCV antibody for HCV infection were retrieved from the records. Results: A total of 638 patients were included; mean (SD) age was of 38.4 (8.4) years and 53% were male. Median (IQR) baseline CD4 cell count and HIV-1 RNA were 246 (77-459) cells/mm 3 and 143,000 (45,825-445,000) copies/mL, respectively. Prior to initiation of ART, HBV infection and HCV infection were screened in 371 (58%) patients and 273 (43%) patients, respectively. All patients who were screened for HCV infection were also screened for HBV infection. There were no differences of demographics or baseline characteristics between patients who were screened for HBV or HCV infection and those who had never been screened for HBV or HCV infection (p > 0.05). Among 371 patients who were screened for HBV infection, 36 (9.7%) had HBV infection. HCV infection was found in 24 from 273 (8.8%) patients who were screened for HCV infection. Infection of both HBV and HCV was observed only one (0.4%) patient. NNRTI-based ART regimens were initiated in 573 (90%) patients; the rest received PI-based regimens. Of 638 patients, 625 (98%) received 3TC in the regimens. There was no difference of ART regimen or 3TC use between patients who had and did not have HBV infection (p > 0.05).

Local polyfunctional Gag-specific CD4+ and CD8+T cell responses are present in the genital tract of SHIV89.6immunised rhesus macaques at the time of SIV challenge. To further assess the role of CD8+ lymphocytes in vaccine-induced protection, a group of SHIV-vaccinated monkeys was depleted of CD8+ lymphocytes on the day of challenge with SIVmac239. Methods: SHIV89.6-immunised (n = 12) and non-immunised (n = 9) animals where necropsied at 14 days post-challenge (PC). Anti-CD8 (cM T807; 50mg/kg) was administered to an additional group of immunised monkeys (n = 6) on the day of the intravaginal challenge with SIVmac239. Lymphocytes from freshly digested cervicovaginal tissues, lymph nodes and peripheral blood where analysed by polychromatic flow cytometry for Gag specific responses (intracellular cytokines, degranulation and cell death/survival signals).Results: Viral RNA (vRNA) levels were high in all tissues of nonimmunised animals (GI tract systemic lymph nodes > genital tract). In immunised animals, virus replication was controlled in all tissues and SIV dissemination beyond the genital lymph nodes was limited. Only 2 immunised animals had moderate levels of vRNA in the GI tract and systemic tissues, with a similar distribution to the control animals. Strikingly, CD8+ lymphocyte depletion eliminated the beneficial effect of the SHIV immunisation, and by 7 days PC, this group had the highest plasma vRNA levels of all groups. Interestingly, the distribution of viral replication was different, and the highest levels of vRNA were found in the genital tract. Moreover, the only Mamu-A01*monkey in this group, which was the only animal that partially controlled the virus in the different tissues, was the only monkey with detectable specific CD8+T cell response in the genital lymph nodes. Conclusion: In summary, the establishment of a memory SIV-specific polyfunctional T cell response in the genital tract induced by liveattenuated immunisation may account for protection from intravaginal SIV challenge. Further, depletion of CD8+T cells eliminates the liveattenuated lentivirus mediated protection. . In 40 studies no information regarding AEs assessment mode was given.

            "text": "Objectives: Nevirapine (NVP)-related rash is well recognised adverse effect. NVP-related rash and hypersensitivity commonly occur in patients with high CD4. In naive patients, NVP should be avoided in male with baseline CD4 400 or female with CD4 250. However, NVP is alternative choice in some patients who have side effects from other regimens. Fast CD4 recovery, gender and ethnicity contribute to development of rash. In HIV-naive Thai patients, risk of rash from NVP is 30%, which is higher than other reports. NVP-related rash in experienced HIV patients who switched to NVP-based regimen has limited data. Methods: We reviewed data of patients who switched antitretroviral regimen (ARV) to contain 200 mg bid of NVP in new regimen. Demographic data, previous ARV regimen, incidence and type of rash and outcome were analysed. The incidence of rash was compare with the results from 2NN study. Clinical data of patients with and without rash were compared. Severe rash is defined as having urticaria or rash with constitutional symptoms or serum sickness or Stevens Johnson Syndrome or toxic epidermal necrolysis. Results: A total of 174 patients switched ARV regimen to NVP-based regimen and 162 patients had available data for further analysis. Mean and median CD4 of enrolled patients were 499 and 471 respectively. Most (95%) of patients had virologic control before switching to NVP. Most patients had no significant changes of CD4 before and after switching. Prevalence of rash was 21% and 9% of patients had severe rash. Using cut-off levels of CD4 at 400 in male and 250 in female, we found no significant difference between incidence of rash between the groups. Severe rash occurred in male and female patients with mean and median CD4 cells were 430,467 in male and 413, 342 in female respectively. In female who had rash and CD4 400, significantly had severe rash than female with CD4 <400 (p < 0.05).",

No rapid rising of CD4 levels after switching to NVP, may explain lower incidence of rash in our patients. Most occurrences of rash are mild. Cut-off levels of CD4 could not predict the risk for rash development. However, female have more chance to develop severe rash from nevirapine compare to male who have same level of CD4. Switching ARV to NVP-based regimen should be cautioned and carefully monitored, especially in female with CD4 400.O527 CXCR4-using HIV-1 in antiretroviral-naive patients with primary or chronic infection S.

Pal\u00f9 (Padua, Verona, Venice, Treviso, Schio, Vicenza, Rome, IT) Objectives: To characterise correlates of CXCR4-using (X4) or CCR5using (R5) HIV-1 strains in a cross-sectional analysis of therapy-naive patients (pts). Methods: Plasma from 26 pts with acute-recent-infection (<1 year, AR), 22 with early-chronic-(>300 cd4/ul, ECh) and 24 with advancedchronic-infection (<300 cd4/ul, AdvCh), all harbouring HIV-1-Bsubtype, were evaluated by sequencing a 35-amino-acids region from env gene, and by interpretation with PSSM-genotype prediction. In a subset of pts, peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMC) and cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were tested. At PBMC-strain analysis, 4 AdvCh-pts with plasma-X4-strains revealed a concordant X4-strain in 3 cases, and an R5-strain in 1. 8 AdvCh-pts with plasma-R5-strains revealed a concordant R5 strain in 7 cases, and an X4-strain in 1. Among 5 plasma-X4 AR-pts, 1 R5-strain was found in PBMC. 7 plasma-R5 acute-pts had an R5-strain in PBMC. Among few CSF studied, an X4 was found, from a AR-pt harbouring R5-strains in plasma and PBMC.",

In AdvChpts discordant pictures in different compartments can be found. These evidences may have implications for therapy, suggesting a co-receptoruse analysis of both plasma-and PBMC-strains as soon as possible after diagnosis. Cautions have to be maintained before using CCR5-inhibitors in the very early stages of disease, monitoring for an early selection of X4 variants.",
