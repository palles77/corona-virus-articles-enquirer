Both diseases develop after long incubation periods on the basis of a persistent viral infection. To date the pathogenetic mechanisms leading to these CNS infections are not completely understood but studies of the viral gene expression have recently led to a better understanding of the state of measles virus persistence in brain cells of these two human CNS diseases. It has been found that MV persistence in brain tissue is characterized by a restriction of envelope viral gene expression implicating MV transcriptional and translational defects Cattaneo ef al., 1986 Cattaneo ef al., , 1987a Cattaneo ef al., , 1988 Liebert et al., 1986) . However, these observations do not help to explain which factors are involved in the establishment of persistence since the studies have been carried out on autopsy material. Therefore, it is not possible to determine which of the defects observed in MV replication in brain tissue of patients with MIBE or SSPE is a consequence of longlasting virus host-cell interaction and which are the initial events determining persistence once MV has entered the brain.",

(Liebert and ter Meulen, 1987) . Following intracerebral inoculation of a neurotropic rat brain adapted CAM-RBH strain of MV, Lewis rats develop different types of CNS diseases. Newborn animals invariably succumb to an acute encephalitis (AE) within a few days following infection. Weanling animals develop either an AE or a subacute encephalomyelitis (SAME) weeks or months after infection. Previous analyses of MV structural proteins in infected brain tissue by immunohistological staining procedures using monoclonal antibodies have suggested a restriction of MV envelope gene expression in all animals. Already in animals with AE, only one third of the infected brain cells expressed MV envelope proteins, and this was observed to decrease further to almost undetectable levels in brains of animals with SAME (Liebert and ter Meulen, 1987) . We show in this study that the restriction of MV gene expression in infected brain tissue of Lewis rats results from transcriptional and translational alterations. The data obtained indicate that the defects observed in measles virus replication in acute or subacute measles encephalomyelitis in Lewis rats parallel many findings described in MIBE and SSPE.",

(B) Lanes 1 and 2 according to Fig. 2A , lanes 3-7 immunoprecipitation of total translate from: lane 3, an uninfected Lewis rat; lanes 4-7, animals with SAME at dpi 21. 23, 32, and 40; lane 8, marker proteins. control for equal amounts of +pA-RNA translated in vitro (1 pg each) a cellular protein band marked I is recognizable in each lane (Fig. 3A ) with approximately the same intensity. In lane 3 of Fig. 3 the concentration of +pA-RNA represents about 5000 copies of the N-mRNA, in lane 4, about 1400 copies of the M-mRNA, and in lane 6, about 200 copies of the H-mRNA. In the total translate (Fig. 3A) all three viral proteins are detectable at the adjusted concentrations in infected Vero cell lysate as well as in the immune precipitate (Fig. 3B) , except for the haemagglutinin which was not clearly precipitable as a distinct band. The intensity of the N-specific bands in lanes 3 and 8 was comparable. The M-specific protein, additionally identified by using a monospecific antiserum (data not shown), could be immunoprecipitated at the appropriate concentration (lane 4) but not visualized in the brain-derived RNA (lane 8).",

The transcription of the glycoprotein-specific mRNAs was generally restricted, the degree of transcriptional restriction being related to the age of the animals and the type of dis-ease. In addition, the synthesis of the viral M proteins and probably also the H proteins was shown to be inhibited, due to a failure in translation of the corresponding mRNA in Lewis rats with SAME. Thus, data obtained at the molecular level support the in viva observation of a restricted expression of the M, F, and H proteins in the brains of infected rats (Liebert and ter Meulen, 1987) .",

This phenomenon was independent both of the incubation time after infection and the humoral immune response of the animals, since measles antibodies in serum and CSF could only be detected in diseased weanling rats (Dijrries et al., 1988) . The fact that a restriction of MV transcription has already occurred in newborn rats a few days after infection suggests that brain-specific host cell factors may primarily interfere with MV gene expression. At present we cannot determine whether brain cells lack factors necessary for efficient MV transcription or contain factors actively interfering with MV gene expression leading to a premature termination of MV transcripts.",

            "text": "Interestingly, restriction occurred predominantly at the M-F gene boundary located within the only long noncoding region of the MV genome spanning about 1000 nucleotides. This genomic region is indeed peculiar, since three open reading frames have been defined, but no translation products of these reading frames have been detected in viva or in vitro (Bellini et a/., 1986; Wong et al., 1987; Greer et a/., 1987) . Moreover, no preferential accumulation of mutations has occurred in this genomic region comparing the sequences of lytic MV strains (Cattaneo et al., 1988) in spite of the high variability of viral RNA genomes (Steinhauer and Holland, 1987; Domingo and Holland, 1987) . Furthermore, noncoding sequences at the 3' end of the M mRNA have also been defined for other paramyxoviruses (Bellini et al., 1986; Blumberg et al., 1984; Hidaka et a/., 1984) . Although there is only chance homology between those noncoding regions within the different viruses, the analogy in location and the conservation of these particular sequences could argue for a regulatory function in the expression of viral genes. Interestingly, the 5' untranslated region of the MV F gene has been shown to contain an unusually high content of cytosine residues (44%) (Buckland et a/., 1987) with an overall GC content of 64%. This may not only influence translational efficiency of the corresponding mRNA as has been shown for cellular genes (Takeishi et a/., 1985; Ordahl et al., 1984; Sap et al., 1986) but also transcriptional regulation. The viral polymerase complex could slowdown or stall along this region which could possibly favor termination. Alternatively, the restriction of MV transcription could possibly result from a selective instability of the glycoproteinspecific mRNAs in brain tissue. This has been described in other viral and cellular systems in which instability of viral and cellular transcripts occur, probably due to the activity of endogenous RNAses (for review, see Brawerman, 1987; Pontecotvi et a/., 1988) .",

This could be documented for the M-specific mRNA by dilution experiments with RNA from infected cells (Fig.  3 ) and at the single cell level for the F and H protein. The basis underlying these restrictions probably resides in the mRNAs themselves because they occur not only in viva but also in in vitro translation experiments. Capdependent translation alterations have been shown for VSV methylation mutants (Horikami and Moyer, 1982) but mutational events should also be considered. Although the time course for mutations seems to be very short one should keep in mind that RNA-editing mechanisms have been shown recently for the P genes of negative strand RNA viruses (Thomas et a/., 1988; Cattaneo et a/., 1989) .",

In MIBE as well as in SSPE a restriction at a transcriptional level is found, affecting mainly MV M, F, and H genes. This leads to a rather steep gradient of mRNA transcripts according to the location of the individual genes in the MV genome (Cattaneo et a/., 1987b) . In in vitro translation experiments using isolated +pA RNAfrom human brain tissue only MV N and P proteins were always detectable whereas the viral envelope proteins were either absent or only occasionally immunoprecipitated . These in vitro findings were supported by immunohistological investigations (Liebert eta/., 1986) . Alterations in translation of MV genes caused by mutations have been observed in some cases of SSPE and in MIBE (Cattaneo et a/., 1988) . In one case of MIBE a mutation caused elimination of the initiation codon of the M gene (Cattaneo et al., 1988) and in one SSPE case a mutation introduced a stop codon in the M gene sequence (Cattaneo et al., 1986 (Cattaneo et al., , 1988 . However, mechanisms other than mutations could be implicated in alteration of translation of MV protein (Ogura et al., 1987 (Ogura et al., , 1988 .",

By this mechanism, which appears to be host-cell dependent, infected brain cells may not be destroyed by virus replication. In the absence of F protein, no cell fusion occurs and the defect of M protein synthesis blocks the maturation of complete virus particles thus keeping the infection strictly cell-associated.",

The pathogenetic role played by the observed mutations in the two human diseases is not understood.
