            "text": "Before the early 1970s the causes of human non-bacterial gastroenteritis were largely unknown. Extensive information has since been obtained about the aetiology and pathogenesis of viral gastroenteritis. There are four major subclassifications of gastroenteritis-causing viruses: rotavirus, enteric adenovirus, calicivirus (including Nortialk and Norwalk-like viruses) and astrovirus. Some characteristics of these viruses are compared in Table 1 . The association of these viruses with gastroenteritis was based on their frequent detection by electron microscopy in stools and mucosal biopsies from diseased patients with diarrhoea compared to controls, absence of viruses after recovery from disease, and the subsequent development of virus-specific immunoglobulin responses in serum and intestinal secretions. In addition, rotavirus and Norwalk virus have been shown to cause gastroenteritis when inoculated into healthy volunteers (Christensen, 1989; Blacklow and Greenberg, 1991) . This association has facilitated studies of epidemiology, classification, immunology, diagnostic methods, methods of treatment and, most importantly, strategies towards prevention through vaccine development.",

            "text": "Following the emergence of the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS), other viral infections of the gastrointestinal tract (e.g. cytomegalovirus) have become increasingly common. Although it is relatively unusual for the common gastroenteritis viruses to be clinically important in patients with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-associated disease, adenovirus has recently been described (Janoff et al, 1991) , as has the presence of HIV itself within the small bowel enterocytes (Ullrich et al, 1989; Heise et al, 1991) . This chapter highlights the major features of these agents, with special attention being given to molecular biology and prospects for vaccination. Prevention, treatment and vaccination will be discussed together, except for rotavirus, which will be considered separately. Rotavirus is the most common cause of severe gastroenteritis in infants and young children, accounting for approximately 3 500 000 episodes per year in the USA alone (Ho et al, 1988) . This agent was initially discovered in the early 1970s when viral particles were seen in duodenal epithelial cells, followed by the detection of the virus in faecal extracts from children with acute gastroenteritis (Bishop et al, 1973 (Bishop et al, , 1974 . Rotavirus infects virtually every child in the USA by the age of 4 years and causes potentially lethal dehydration in 0.75% of children less than 2 years of age (LeBaron et al, 1990a) .",

            "text": "These viruses are members of the Reoviridae family. The rotavirus genome contains 11 segments of double-stranded RNA, each of which encodes a single protein. The viral structural proteins assemble into a non-enveloped, multilayered icosahedral structure. The virions contain an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase as well as other enzymes which lead to the production of capped RNA transcripts (Estes and Cohen, 1989) . The viral genome itself is encapsulated by four major structural proteins ( Figure 1 ). The two surface membrane proteins, VP4 and VP7, act as the major determinants of protective antibody-mediated immunity (Matsui et al, 1989) . VP7 is the primary determinant of the viral serotype classification (see Epidemiology). Together with VP4, it makes up the outer coat of the virus and is perforated by 132 aqueous holes which provide channels from the viral surface to the viral genome in the centre of the virion. It is likely that these channels are the route through which viral mRNA leaves the transcription complex (Prasad et al, 1988) . From this outer coat surface protrude the numerous spike-like structures of VP4, the viral haemagglutinin (Prasad et al, 1990; Yeager et al, 1990) . Within the outer capsid lies the inner capsid, made up of VP6 trimers which constitute 51% of the virion protein by weight. VP6 is not only important for viral structure, but is also required for viral polymerase activity and may have a role in transcription (Estes and Cohen, 1989) . There are holes in this inner capsid which are aligned with those in the outer capsid. This inner capsid surrounds a protein core which is thought to be made up of VPl, VP2 and VP3, which encapsulate the double-stranded RNA genome (Yeager et al, 1990) .",

This protein has several functions, including haemagglutination activity of certain rotaviruses, a role in virulence in mice, and induction of protective antibody-mediated immunity. VP4 is cleaved into VP5 and VP8 by proteolytic enzymes, such as trypsin, which leads to enhanced infectivity by permitting direct penetration of the virus through the cellular plasma membrane (Kalica et al, 1983; Suzuki et al, 1985 Suzuki et al, , 1986 Offit et al, 1986; Hoshino et al, 1988; Kaljot et al, 1988; Matsui et al, 1989) . VP7 is encoded by RNA segment 9. It mediates viral neutralization and determines serotype specificity (see below). VP6 is encoded by RNA segment 6 and contains the subgroup-specific antigen and the antigen that determines group reactivity (Matsui et al, 1989) . VPl, VP2 and VP3 are encoded by RNA segments 1, 2 and 3, respectively, while segments 5, 7, 8 and 10 are thought to encode non-structural proteins.

Groups A, B and C have been found in humans and animals, while the others have been found only in animals (Estes and Cohen, 1989) . Rotaviruses can be subdivided within groups by serotypes that are based on neutralizing antibodies induced against VP7 during infection or immunization. This property is frequently established in vitro, when a virus is grown in tissue culture in the presence of a serum of known specificity. If viral neutralization is observed, the virus being tested is said to share a serotype with the virus used to produce the infection/vaccination serum. Recently, this cumbersome process has been obviated by the use of serotype-specific monoclonal antibodies that permit serotype classification in a simple enzyme-linked immunoassay. An important practical aspect of serotype classification is to enable investigators to enhance vaccine strategies through epidemiological studies that can define the serotypic diversity of the common human rotaviruses.",

Other circumstances in which adult disease is common include water-borne outbreaks and travellers' diarrhoea (Hrdy, 1987) . Nevertheless, due to the level of immunity acquired from previous infection as well as less well-defined maturational factors, subclinical infection tends to be the rule in adults. In one study, 55% of household contacts of children hospitalized for rotavirus gastroenteritis had serological evidence of recent or current rotavirus infection at the time of the child's hospital admission (Kim et al, 1977; Kapikian and Chanock, 1990 ). Other studies have also shown that rotavirus infection in children is much more likely to be symptomatic (Wenman et al, 1979 The virus is transmitted by the faecal-oral route, although transmission by the respiratory route has also been postulated (Kapikian et al, 1983a; Kapikian and Chanock, 1990) . The shedding of rotavirus has been documented both during and after the diarrhoeal stage (Pickering et al, 1988) . In the Western hemisphere, rotavirus infection has a seasonal pattern, usually occurring in the winter months (LeBaron et al, 1990b) . Utilizing the technique of electropherotyping (observing patterns of the 11 RNA gene segments separated on polyacrylamide gels), it has often been shown that several different strains of rotavirus may circulate and cause disease in a community at the same time (Konno et al, 1984; Ruggeri et al, 1989) although one strain usually predominates (Beards et al, 1989; Urasawa et al, 1989) .",

            "text": "Much has been learnt about the pathogenesis of rotavirus infection from studies in animals. The virus infects mature enterocytes on the tips of small intestine villi. The infection spreads in a proximal to distal pattern along the small intestine, lysing the intestinal enterocytes and leading to villous shortening and crypt hyperplasia (Blacklow and Greenberg, 1991) . The pathophysiological mechanisms that cause diarrhoea are still unclear, with experimental evidence supporting a role for net intestinal secretion, and selective malabsorption of certain macromolecules. Secondary lactase deficiency and carbohydrate malabsorption also play a role. Recently, studies on cytokines, direct effects of viral infection on sodium transport prior to cell death, and villous ischaemia and subsequent oedema causing interference with countercurrent exchange mechanisms have all been reported (Yamashiro et al, 1989; Spencer et al, 1990; Starkey et al, 1990; Osborne et al, 1991) . Establishing the relative importance of different mechanisms and their interactions may lead to improved treatments aimed at halting and replacing fluid losses. Immunology Antibodies directed at VP4 or VP7 can neutralize virus and protect the host from infection. This is not so with antibodies directed against the other viral proteins, including VP6, the most immunogenic of the rotavirus proteins (Offit et al, 1986; Hoshino et al, 1988; Matsui et al, 1989) . Neutralizing epitopes conserved among several serotypes are located on the C-terminal trypsin-cleavage fragment of VP4, but high-titre antibodies directed at this region may not be induced during natural infection (Mackow et al, 1988a,b; Blacklow and Greenberg, 1991; Shaw et al, 1991) . Most VP4-specific antibodies are directed at a hypervariable region (the region designated vp8\" after trypsin cleavage of vp4) and are strain-specific. Although there exists at least one serotype cross-reactive epitope on VP7, most of the neutralizing antibodies to VP7 are serotype-specific (Taniguchi et al, 1988) .",

One group of patients in this study retained long-term immunity despite low levels of antibody to the Norwalk virus, suggesting that factors other than circulating immunoglobulins are respon-sible for protection. It is possible that there exists a receptor for the Norwalk virus on enterocytes, the absence of which allows individuals to remain relatively resistant to infection (Parrino et al, 1977; Christensen, 1989) .

In one study, almost all patients with diarrhoea and adenovirus antigen in the stool had respiratory symptoms, including cough, wheezing or rhinorrhoea (Yolken et al, 1982a) ; others report only a rare occasion with respiratory symptoms (Uhnoo et al, 1986) . The role of the fastidious adenovirus subtypes in the development of these symptoms is unclear, as some of the earlier studies used antibodies to adenovirus group antigens for diagnosis, and thus the causative agent may in fact have been non-fastidious organisms excreted in lower numbers in the stool (Christensen, 1989) .

THE IMMUNOCOMPROMISED HOST Cytomegalovirus (CMV) Cytomegalovirus (CMV) has been identified in the gastrointestinal tract of nearly 8% of patients with HIV, and in 13% of patients with AIDS (Frances et al, 1989) . This virus has caused severe or life-threatening disease in 2.2% of patients with AIDS (Jacobson and Mills, 1988; Smith et al, 1992) . Its most common enteric manifestation is colitis, characterized by diarrhoea, haematochezia, abdominal pain and fever (Smith et al, 1992) . Infection may occur in many areas of the gastrointestinal tract, including the oesophagus, stomach, small intestine, appendix, pancreas and biliary tree (Valerdiz-Casasola and Pardo-Mindan, 1991; Smith et al, 1992) .",

            "text": "Intestinal abnormalities have been noted in the absence of any identifiable pathogen in patients with AIDS. Villous atrophy and crypt hyperplasia were correlated with enteric infection in one study, whereas subjects without identifiable infection had normal crypt depth, slightly reduced villous surface area, and decreased numbers of mitotic figures per crypt. The latter group of patients was associated with deficiency or absence of jejunal brush border lactase activity in most of the patients (Ullrich et al, 1989) . In many of these patients immunohistological tests for the presence of p24 antigen (Ullrich et al, 1989) and in situ hybridization have revealed HIV antigen in the intestinal epithelial cells or mononuclear cells (Heise et al, 1991) . It has, therefore, been suggested that the HIV infection itself leads to an 'enteropathy' in the absence of any other identifiable pathogen. But, given the low percentage of patients with intestinal HIV infection, the small number of cells actually infected with the virus, and the absence of associated enteric inflammation, the aetiology of this 'AIDS enteropathy' remains unclear (Smith et al, 1992) . SUMMARY Increased knowledge has been gained into the aetiology and pathogenesis of viral gastroenteritis during the past two decades. There are now thought to be four major subclassifications of gastroenteritis-causing viruses; these include rotavirus, enteric adenovirus, calicivirus, including Norwalk and Norwalk-like viruses, and astrovirus. The association of these agents with gastroenteritis has been made by their electron microscopic detection in stool and intestinal biopsy specimens from affected patients, the inability to detect the viruses after recovery from disease, and the subsequent development of immunoglobulin responses after infection; in some instances disease transmission was achieved in human volunteers. The association of these viral agents with gastroenteritis has facilitated the study of classification, epidemiology, immunity, diagnostic tests, methods of treatment and, most importantly, disease prevention strategies such as vaccine development for rotavirus. This chapter highlights the major features of these agents, with special attention being given to the pertinent molecular biology as well as current and future prospects for vaccination. Enteric viral infections of the gastrointestinal tract in patients with AIDS are also discussed. REFERENCES Agus S, Dolin R, Wyatt G et al (1973) ",
