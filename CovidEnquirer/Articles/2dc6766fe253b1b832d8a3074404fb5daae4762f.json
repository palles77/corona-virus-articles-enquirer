Interestingly, in the 290 HsTbpA2 displacement ELISA, the signal obtained using a competitor porcine transferrin was 291 significantly higher than the signal obtained with no competitor ( Figure 24D ).

This could still be 300 done to identify important sites of contact between the Tbps and transferrin. However, in the 301 case of HsTbpB and HsTbpA2, this would not be a screen for \"all-or-none\" changes in binding, 302 but instead would likely involve precise measurements of changes in affinity. BLI, or a similarly 303 sensitive technique that allows for quantitative binding analysis, would be ideal for these kinds 304 TBDT-dependent nutrient uptake systems can be either be monopartite, bipartite, or even 308 multipartite, such as the Sus system in Bacteroides (39). TBDTs do not inherently require 309 affiliated SLPs or other TBDTs to function. What then are the potential advantages of 310 multipartite systems? TbpA is always found in an operon with TbpB and the latter has been 311 shown to be essential for host colonization in the absence of lactoferrin receptors (12). However, 312 the reason for this is not understood. TbpB is hypothesized to be important because it 313 preferentially binds holo-transferrin. TbpA has no preference for transferrin's iron loaded state, 314 and so TbpB is thought to greatly increase the efficiency of iron acquisition. Furthermore, TbpA 315 and TbpB have been shown to function synergistically and together, have a higher affinity for 316 transferrin than either protein does alone. In this study we propose another advantage of having 317 an accessory SLP: the expansion of substrate range. In multipartite nutrient uptake systems such 318 as the Sus proteins, accessory lipoproteins are known to modulate substrate specificity (40). We 319",

Minimal growth was observed in the presence of human transferrin and in the 139 buffer-only condition. H. somni also showed growth on ovine and caprine transferrins at every 140 concentration except 25 \u00b5M.

As in the displacement ELISA, detergent-188 extracted HsTbpA bound bovine transferrin, and not ovine, caprine, or porcine transferrins 189 (Figure 3A). HsTbpA2, on the other hand, showed binding to bovine, ovine, and caprine 190 transferrins, although the absorbance signal for the latter two interactions was only a quarter of 191 what was observed for binding of HsTbpA2 to bovine transferrin (Figure 3B). 192 Because HsTbpA2 binds to ovine and caprine transferrins and is a member of the TBDT family, 193 we concluded that the growth observed in the presence of ovine and caprine transferrins must at 194 least be partially due to this receptor. In contrast, HsTbpB cannot act as a transporter, but may be 195 acting to promote iron uptake from ovine and caprine transferrins as well. To determine whether 196 the affinity of HsTbpB for ovine and caprine transferrins would allow it to bind these proteins at 197 physiological concentrations, we decided to measure binding affinities between the bovid 198 transferrins and HsTbpB. 199 200 The affinities of H. somni TbpB for ovine and caprine transferrins permit binding at 201 physiological concentrations 202 We measured dissociation constants (K D 's) for HsTbpB-transferrin interactions to determine if 203 binding occurs at physiological concentrations. We used bovine, ovine, and caprine transferrins 204 and compared the corresponding dissociation constants with the concentration of transferrin that 205 would be available in the host (Figure 4A-C,Table 7). While TbpB had a 3-fold lower affinity 206 for ovine transferrin and a 15.7-fold lower affinity for caprine transferrin compared to its affinity 207 for bovine transferrin, both dissociation constants are far lower than the concentration of 208",

            "text": "250While there is a range of reported values, healthy cattle have transferrin concentrations of 1.37 to 251 6.6 g/L (29, 30). Using a molecular weight of ~78 kDa for glycosylated bovine transferrin, the 252 transferrin concentration in the blood can be estimated to range between 17 to 85 \u00b5M. This is 253 the serum transferrin concentrations found in other animals (34). All of the transferrins 254 used in our experiments were fully iron loaded in order to remove a source of variability from 255 the experiments. However, only about 25-50% of the transferrin found in the blood is iron 256 saturated, meaning that in the blood, only ~10-25% of the transferrin C-lobes are in the holo 257 form(35). Because of this, the concentration ranges used in our experiments are approximately 258 representative of the amount of transferrin that is available as an iron source in the blood for 259Tbp-containing bacteria. Another important consideration is that H. somni usually resides on 260 mucosal surfaces where the transferrin concentration is significantly lower (although the exact 261 concentration is difficult to measure). In human saliva, for example, the concentration of 262 transferrin is roughly 10-50 nM (36-38). At these concentrations, the lower relative affinities of 263HsTbpB and HsTbpA2 for ovine and caprine transferrins compared to bovine transferrin may 264 become significant. H. somni is isolated from cattle more frequently than from sheep or goats. It 265 is possible that the concentration of transferrin on the mucosal surfaces of sheep and goats may 266 be low enough to pose a barrier to H. somni colonization. 267",

            "text": "knowledge, H. somni is the only pathogen that has three transferrin binding proteins. 322 Whether HsTbpA2 leads to the formation of a tripartite receptor is unknown, but the possibility 323 is worth investigating. The three transferrin binding proteins in H. somni are reminiscent of the 324 receptors HpuAB and HmbR in the pathogenic Neisseria. HpuAB forms a TbpBA-like bipartite 325 receptor and binds hemoglobin-haptoglobin complexes, while HmbR is a single TBDT that binds 326 hemoglobin (41, 42). Like the corresponding H. somni genes, both hpuA and hmbR are phase 327 variable. Interestingly, the expression of HmbR has been correlated with a more virulent 328 phenotype (43, 44). It is unknown whether TbpA2 increases virulence in H. somni. However, it 329 is interesting to note that the commensal H. somni isolate 129PT (GenBank accession: 330 CP000436) has a frame-shifted TbpA2 while more virulent isolates such as strain 2336 331 (CP000947) do not display this frameshift (unpublished observations). In the same way that it 332 apparently benefits Neisseria to express three hemoglobin binding proteins, it may benefit H. 333 somni to express three Tbps. In addition to the ability to bind both lobes of transferrin, we 334 propose that having TbpBA and TbpA2 provides another advantage; HsTbpB and HsTbpA2 335 broaden transferrin recognition range to include ovine and caprine transferrins, and may play a 336 role in allowing H. somni to infect these bovid species. 337 338 d. Experimental Procedures 339 Plasmids and strains 340 Histophilus somni strain H191, an isolate collected from a healthy animal in a feedlot via nasal 341 swab, was provided by Dr. Douglas W. Morck (University of Calgary) and was used for all H.342 somni growth and binding experiments. Escherichia coli C43(DE3) were used to express 343 -terminal biotin acceptor peptide (BAP), a 6x polyhistidine tag, maltose binding protein 347 (MBP), and a Tobacco Etch Virus (TEV) protease cleavage site. Constructs expressed from 348 pGEX-6p-1 contained an N-terminal GST tag followed by a PreScission Protease cleavage 349 sequence. HsTbpB (aa 21-643, where residue 1 is Cys1 of the mature peptide) was expressed 350 cytoplasmically without its anchor peptide. TbpAs were provided by the Schryvers lab and were 351 re-cloned into the pET26b+ vector and expressed with a PelB signal peptide, and an N-terminal 352 10x polyhistidine tag followed by a TEV cleavage site. (The C-terminal polyhistidine tag 353 encoded in the vector was not used.) 354Transferrin purification 355Bovine holo-transferrin was purchased from Sigma.
