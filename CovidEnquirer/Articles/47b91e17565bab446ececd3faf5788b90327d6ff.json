            "text": "Idiopathic dilated cardiomyopathy (IDC) accounts for 25% of cases of heart failure in the United States. Understanding the relationship between an inciting event or agent and the development of IDC has progressed only recently. Once IDC has developed, treatment is palliative and little can be done to alter the natural course of the disease. Active myocarditis, a suspected precursor of IDC, is myocardial inflammation and injury without ischemia. The disease ranges from a self-limited flulike illness to one of serious consequence with arrhythmias, heart failure, or death. Many agents have been associated with myocarditis, and the clinical manifestations depend on an interplay between the inciting agent and the host response. The development of a murine model and the expanded use of endomyocardial biopsy using the Dallas criteria have increased our understanding of myocarditis and its sequelae. Therapy consists of managing symptoms using conventional medical regimens for heart failure. Immunosuppressive therapy should be reserved for patients with biopsy-proven disease who have failed conventional therapy. Continued deterioration warrants ventricular assistance and consideration of cardiac transplantation. M ore than 3 million people in the United States are affected by heart failure, with more than 750,000 new cases diagnosed and 250,000 deaths each year.

Many agents (Table I) have been associated with active myocarditis, and the clinical manifestations depend on an interplay between the inciting event or agent and host response. Progress has been made in understanding the mechanisms that result in clinical disease, and they have been the focus of intense investigation. Myocardial injury may result from one or more of the following: myocyte infection with replication of the offending agent resulting in cellular destruction; destruction due to activated cellular or humoral defense mechanisms, or both, triggered by the infectious agent; exogenous toxins produced by the pathogen; and coronary endothelial invasion resulting in microvascular spasm.2,4 PATHOGENESIS Woodruff\" reported that myocardial infection occurred when coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3), the most commonly identified cause of human myocarditis in the immunocompetent host, was injected into weanling mice. Replicating virus was obtainable for 7 to 9 days after inoculation, but evidence of heart failure was absent during this phase, as was histologic evidence for intlammation.",

By 15 months, there was no histologic evidence for inflammation, although heart failure had developed with mural thrombosis and left ventricular dilatation. 6 Data obtained from murine models imply that myocardial damage occurs in two phases. The first, or acute phase, involves myocardial cell infection with replication and cell lysis, with the virus being cleared by macrophages, natural killer cells, and neutralizing antibodies. The second, or chronic phase, involves myocardial infiltration by inflammatory cells and production of cardiotropic antibodies. Myocardial damage may be minimal or severe (Figure 1 ). Viral clearance is unaffected during the acute phase if antithymocyte serum is administered to BALB/c mice, but the progressive intIammatory response is attenuated.7 Cell-mediated immune responses, rather than humoral, are more important during the chronic in myocyte injury and dysfunction by development of autoantibodies to the G-receptor, myosin, and the adenosine diphosphate-adenosine triphosphate (ADP-ATP) carrier protein. cm Thus a viral infection, although clinically quiescent, triggers an autoimmune cellular, and possibly humoral, response leading to myocardial inflammation and necrosis, which eventually culminate in a pathophysiologic state similar to IDC. Myocarditis leads to IDC in this murine model. Observations of increased enteroviral antibody titers in patients with myocarditis or IDC have traditionally been offered as evidence that enteroviruses are the causative agents. l2 Unfortunately, enteroviral infections are common in the general population, and it has been difficult to ascertain if acute and convalescent titers coincide with the onset of heart dysfunction. Fletcher and colleagues13 found 34% of their patients with IDC had coxsackievirus B viral titers 1:40, but unfortunately this was the same incidence found in controls. Cambridge and colleagues14 found that if the level of viral titers used as a cutoff point is increased to 1:1,024, 30% of patients had abnormal levels as opposed to 2% of controls. Similar results were obtained by Kitaural in Japan, who found a significantly greater proportion of patients with IDC had coxsackievirus Bl titers greater than 1:16 when compared with controls. These two studies suggest that patients with IDC have a greater prevalence of coxsackievirus B infection than the general population. On the other hand, infection with cardiotropic viruses is extremely common, and most adults have been exposed to them and may even have experienced subclinical myocarditis, yet did not develop IDC.",

Although questions about the specificity of the probe arose, making the data difficult to interpret, this was the first study implicating the persistence of the enterovirus. Several investigators using in situ hybridization to detect enteroviral genomes in myocardial tissue suggested 13% to 53% of patients with myocarditis may have myocardial enteroviral infection.12 Intriguing questions are left unanswered. To date, the capability of these genomes to replicate as intact viruses has not been demonstrated. It has been suggested that these genomes are nonreplicating defective viral fragments and may be immunogenic or mere markers of previous infection. The answers await further study.",

Although endomyocardial biopsy was used for IDC or suspected cases of myocarditis prior to 1986, a lack of histologic standards frequently led to differences in interpretation by individual pathologists. In preparing for the multicenter Myocarditis Treatment Trial, a group of expert pathologists convened at a consensus conference and established the Dallas criteria. These criteria define inflammatory heart disease as active myocarditis, borderline myocarditis, or no myocarditis. Active myocarditis is defined by myocardial leukocyte infiltration with necrosis in the absence of ischemia. Borderline myocarditis involves infiltration without necrosis; this specific diagnosis cannot be made when inflammatory cells are not seen. The adoption of the Dallas criteria has led to 90% concordance among experienced pathologists, 22 and although myocarditis cannot be ruled out by biopsy because of sampling error in patients with focal disease, the diagnosis now can be made with a high degree of confidence.

A high index of suspicion by the clinician is essential for the correct diagnosis. Numerous tests are available to support the diagnosis, but endomyocardial biopsy remains the gold standard. Therapy is directed toward the manage-ment of symptoms using conventional medical regimens for heart failure. Although controversial, immunosuppressive therapy should be reserved for patients with biopsy-proven disease who have failed conventional therapy. Continued deterioration warrants ventricular assistance and consideration for cardiac transplantation. Further elucidation of the use of endomyocardial biopsy and immunosuppressive therapy awaits the final results of the Myocarditis Treatment Trial. Undoubtedly, further advances in our understanding of the pathophysiology will have the greatest impact on altering the disease process.",
