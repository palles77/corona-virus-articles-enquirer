            "text": "Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus which was associated with severe diarrhea disease in pigs. SADS-CoV was first detected and identified as the causative agent of a devastating swine disease outbreak in southern China in 2017. Routine monitoring and early detection of the source of infection is therefore integral to the prevention and control of SADS-CoV infection. In this study, a SYBR greenbased real-time reverse transcription quantitative polymerase chain reaction (RT-qPCR) technique was established for rapid detection and monitoring of this emerging virus. Specific primers were designed based on the conserved region within the M gene of the viral genome. The lowest detection limit of the RT-qPCR assay was 10 copies/\u03bcL. This assay was specific and had no cross-reaction with other 11 swine viruses. The positive rate of 84 clinical samples for the SYBR green-based RT-qPCR and the conventional RT-PCR was 73.81% (62/84) and 53.57% (45/84), respectively. These results demonstrated that the SYBR green-based RT-qPCR technique was an effectively diagnostic method with higher sensitivity than probe-based RT-qPCR and gel-based RT-PCR for detection and epidemiological investigations of SADS-CoV. \u204e Corresponding authors.",

The piglets infected with SADS-CoV mainly exhibited the clinical manifestations of acute vomiting and diarrhea and death (Gong et al., 2017; Xu et al., 2018; Zhou et al., 2018b) . It was notable that the genome sequence of the causative agent of this large-scale outbreak shares remarkable homology with a bat coronavirus detected in a cave near the pig farm, implying SADS-CoV most likely originated from bats (Gong et al., 2017; Lau et al., 2007; Zhou et al., 2018b) . Considering the high lethality of this new emerging virus and the clinical signs of the infected pigs that are similar to that caused by other porcine enteric coronaviruses, there is an urgent need to establish a sensitive and reliable diagnostic method that will be of help to early discovery and identification of SADS-CoV infection.",

Recently, a reverse transcription loop-mediated isothermal amplification method (RT-LAMP) was established for the detection of SADS-CoV, however it couldn't be used for quantitative analysis of the viral copies in the samples . Real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR) is a powerful diagnostic method and has been widely used for detection and quantitation of pathogenic microorganism because of high sensitivity and reproducibility (Jensen et al., 2018; Yang et al., 2018; Yuan et al., 2016; Zhou et al., 2018a) . Recently, a study reported a probe-based real time RT-qPCR for the detection of SADS-CoV, with a detection limit of 30 DNA copies/\u03bcL (Zhou et al., 2018a) . Whereas, the SYBR green-based qPCR assay does not require an expensive probe, and is more cost-effective and easier to design than probe-based RT-qPCR. However, up to now, there is no report about SYBR green-based real-time RT-qPCR for the detection of SADS-CoV.",

The dissociation curve analysis indicated the RNA dilutions range from 1 \u00d7 10 1 -1 \u00d7 10 7 copies/\u03bcL showed almost the same melting temperature (Tm) value (mean Tm values \u00b1 standard deviation: 81.57 \u00b1 0.15\u00b0C), meanwhile sample containing one RNA molecule and distilled water as a negative control didn't generate the similar dissociation curve (Fig. 1C) . The detection limit of the conventional RT-PCR in this study was 100 copies (Fig. 1D) , which was 10 times less sensitive than RT-qPCR. Fig. 1B shows the standard curve generated by plotting the RNA copy number against the cycle (Ct) values of the RNA dilutions tested by RT-qPCR in triplicate using Prism 5.0 software (GraphPad, USA). The Ct values displayed a strong linear correlation (R 2 = 0.9937) with the logarithm of the RNA copy numbers (Fig. 1B) , indicating robust amplification efficiency of the assay. RNA dilutions ranged from 1 \u00d7 10 7 -1 \u00d7 10 2 copies/\u03bcL were used to evaluate the reproducibility of the RT-qPCR assay. Intra-and inter-assay coefficients of variation (CV) were calculated as the method previously described (Zhou et al., 2018a) . The intra-and inter-assay CVs of the SYBR green-based RT-qPCR ranged from 0.04% to 2.63% and 0.69% to 3.57% respectively, suggesting remarkable reproducibility and high reliability of the assay.",

No amplification signal was observed throughout the experiment for most of the viruses.

The SADS-CoV-positive status of the samples was determined by the combination of the amplification curve and the melting curve analysis. The samples were also evaluated by conventional RT-PCR and probe-based RT-qPCR which were reported before (Pan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018a) . Of 84 samples, 62 samples were SADS-CoV-positive confirmed by SYBR RT-qPCR. When these samples were tested by gel-based RT-PCR, only 45 samples were positive. The positive samples determined by conventional RT-PCR were all positive by SYBR RT-qPCR. Seventeen samples determined negative by conventional RT-PCR were identified as positive samples by SYBR RT-qPCR. When these samples were tested by probe-based RT-qPCR, the detection result was consistent with result by SYBR RT-qPCR. The detection results were summarized in Table 2. SADS-CoV is a recently discovered virus that has resulted in serious outbreaks and huge financial losses to pig farming industry in south China (Fu et al., 2018; Gong et al., 2017; Pan et al., 2017; Zhou et al., 2018b) . Most of these studies applied the conventional RT-PCR to detection of SADS-CoV. However, RT-PCR is time-consuming and cannot determine the amounts of viral copies. A RT-qPCR assay is required for rapid and quantitative detection of SADS-CoV which has been epidemic in the south China.",

However the hydrolysis probe increased the experimental cost and the difficulty of assay design. Thus we established a cost-effective SYBR green-based RT-qPCR assay with high sensitivity and reliability for detection of SADS-CoV. This assay doesn't require a probe and is costeffective. The limit of detection of the SYBR green-based RT-qPCR is 10 RNA copies/\u03bcL, 10 times and 3 times more sensitive than that of the conventional RT-PCR and probed-based RT-qPCR, respectively (Zhou et al., 2018a) . The detection limit with 10 RNA copies in this study was theoretical analytical sensitivity, since that the sensitivity experiment was done by serial dilution of RNA standard in water, as the method described in a previous study (Zhou et al., 2018a) . To determine more realistic sensitivity of the assay, the sensitivity experiment would be done by spiked RNA from negative tissue homogenate in the future. The positive rate of the clinical samples determined by the SYBR greenbased RT-qPCR assay was 73.81%, whereas that of the conventional RT-PCR was merely 53.57%, further demonstrating the higher sensitivity of the SYBR green-based RT-qPCR assay. In the future, it is necessary to detect rectal swabs by the SYBR green-based RT-qPCR assay to evaluate the effect of bacteria in the samples on the detection capacity of the method. The sequences of the primers used in the SYBR RT-qPCR assay are 100% identity with all known SADS-CoV strains and a coronavirus isolated from the bat, suggesting the RT-qPCR assay not only can be used to detect the clinical samples from the swine, but also that from the bats.",

Complete genome sequences of 34 SADS-CoV isolates in total retrieved from GenBank were aligned using MegAlign7.1.0 (DNAStar, USA), and Matrix (M) gene sequence was found to be highly conserved among all the strains of SADS-CoV in the database. The primers named as SADS-F (5\u2032-ATGACTGATTCTAACAACAC-3\u2032) (covering nucleotides 24,784-24,803) and SADS-R (5\u2032-TTAGACTAAATGCAGCAATC-3\u2032) (complementary to nucleotides 25,451-25,470) were designed and used to amplify the M gene.
