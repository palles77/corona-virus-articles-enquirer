He had marked reactivity to stone fruits, nuts, and Cannabis components, which contain nsLTPs. The phenomenon of cross-reactivity between C sativa and plant foods is known as \"Cannabis fruit/vegetable syndrome\" or \"LTP syndrome.\" 5 Numerous studies have analyzed the nsLTP-mediated cross-reactivity between C sativa and stone fruits, such as peaches, nectarines, and plums, in addition to nuts, apples, and tomatoes. [5][6][7][8] The nsLTPs belong to the prolamin protein superfamily and provide protection against bacteria and fungi in plants. Given their important role in the plant defense system, these nsLTPs are highly conserved and, as a result, often cause clinical reactivity to multiple different foods in sensitized patients. 8 The nsLTPs are highly resistant to thermal stress and proteolysis, which could account for their ability to withstand digestion and cause more systemic reactions, although oral allergy syndrome also has been described. 9 Prior studies have suggested that nsLTP-mediated reactivity is geographic, mainly in Europe. 5,8 Some reports have indicated sensitization to stone fruits in the wake of developing an allergy to marijuana. 5,10 In the present case, the history of stone fruit allergies preceded the development of anaphylaxis to C sativa components. This raises the novel possibility that the reverse sequence for nsLTP cross-reactivity also might be relevant.",

            "text": "Severe immunodeficiency associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia and its treatment Immunodeficiency can be associated with acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) in various ways. ALL can be a feature of various primary immunodeficiencies including, but not limited, to X-linked agammaglobulinemia, chromosomal breakage disorders such as ataxia telangiectasia, and GATA2 haploinsufficiency. [1] [2] [3] [4] ALL also can be secondary to an infection such as human immunodeficiency virus. A congenital leukemia such as ALL can lead to abnormal newborn screening results for severe combined immunodeficiency. 5 This could be due to dilution of na\u00efve T cells compared with the proportion of leukemic cells. In addition, ALL can lead to immunodeficiency secondary to chemotherapy. Very few cases or case series of severe immunodeficiency with extended follow-up have been described after ALL. 6, 7 We present a case of transient severe immunodeficiency secondary to therapy for infantile ALL with remission over time. We obtained written informed consent of the parents for this report. The patient was born by emergency cesarean section to nonconsanguineous parents at 39 weeks 4 days of gestation and noted to have leukemia cutis (blue macular rash) and a white blood cell count of 514,000/\u03bcL with 94% blasts. She had no family history of immunodeficiency or malignancies. At further evaluation she was diagnosed with congenital pre-B ALL (CD19 + , CD10 \u2212 /aberrant CD15 + ) on her first day of life. Immunophenotyping showed cells positive for CD34, CD38, CD19, CD22, HLA-DR, CD15, TdT, CD45, CD11b (8%), and CD7 (7%). Fluorescent in situ hybridization showed reciprocal translocation t(4;11) with KMT2A rearrangement, previously known as mixed lineage leukemia gene rearrangement. This rearrangement and her very young age suggested a high-risk ALL with poor prognosis. 8 Cytogenetic testing was negative for trisomy 21, ETV6/ RUNX1 and BCR/ABL1 gene fusion, and p16 gene deletion, and Poseidon chromosome 4 (D4Z1) and 10 (D10Z1) centromere probes showed a normal signal pattern. She was treated according to the Children's Oncology Group ALL clinical treatment trial protocol AALL0631, Arm C for high risk (age + mixed lineage leukemia rearrangement). This protocol included vincristine, daunorubicin, cyclophosphamide, cytarabine (Ara-C), asparaginase, methylprednisolone, triple intrathecal therapy (methotrexate, Ara-C, and hydrocortisone), granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, etoposide, and lestaurtinib. She was in complete remission at 1.5 months of age. She was started on continuation chemotherapy at 6 months of age with a plan to complete therapy at 2 years of age.",

Her chemotherapy was discontinued at 22 months. At 23 months, she was hospitalized for feeding intolerance, vomiting, diarrhea, and worsening skin rash and eventually transferred to a tertiary care center.

Prompt recognition, treatment, and supportive care can lead to recovery from transient severe immunodeficiency. Most patients with ALL have immune reconstitution after chemotherapy within 6 months. 9 A study describing immune dysfunction at 6 months after therapy in 23 patients with ALL or acute myeloid leukemia noted lymphopenia in 5% and hypogammaglobulinemia in 25%. 10 However, clinical immunologic features were not described in these patients. 10 A case series by Geerlinks et al 6 described severe immunodeficiency with leukemia, but the patients did not recover or needed hematopoietic stem cell transplantation for immune recovery. In addition, a case study of children with ALL and their immunologic status described the rate of immune recovery. 7 However, none of these cases were as severe as the present case. We acknowledge the limitation of our case report. This child might have a genetic abnormality that had not yet completely manifested and could have been missed at exome sequencing. This case exemplifies that implementation of medical therapy including immunoglobulin infusions and prophylactic antimicrobial regimen with isolation of the patient can result in resolution of the severe immunodeficiency symptoms while awaiting spontaneous T-cell reconstitution without needing immune reconstitution through stem cell transplantation.
