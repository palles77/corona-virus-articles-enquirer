Emerging infectious diseases have exacted heavy public health and economic tolls. Severe acute respiratory syndrome rapidly decimated the region's tourist industry. Infl uenza A H5N1 has had a profound eff ect on the poultry industry. The reasons why southeast Asia is at risk from emerging infectious diseases are complex. The region is home to dynamic systems in which biological, social, ecological, and technological processes interconnect in ways that enable microbes to exploit new ecological niches. These processes include population growth and movement, urbanisation, changes in food production, agriculture and land use, water and sanitation, and the eff ect of health systems through generation of drug resistance. Southeast Asia is home to about 600 million people residing in countries as diverse as Singapore, a city state with a gross domestic product (GDP) of US$37 500 per head, and Laos, until recently an overwhelmingly rural economy, with a GDP of US$890 per head. The regional challenges in control of emerging infectious diseases are formidable and range from infl uencing the factors that drive disease emergence, to making surveillance systems fi t for purpose, and ensuring that regional governance mechanisms work eff ectively to improve control interventions.",

Southeast Asia is a loosely defi ned geopolitical region that is characterised and shaped by diff ering environmental, ecological, and economic factors. These factors are discussed in more detail in other reports in this Series. As a consequence, the region shoulders a great diversity of communicable disease and, closely associated with development, a heavy burden in countries with the lowest incomes (see fi gure). 1 The region has been at the centre of global attention regarding emerging infectious diseases, with the threat of diseases with pandemic potential receiving particular attention. Although the focus of this paper is emerging infectious diseases, as can be seen in the fi gure, the burden of infectious diseases is substantial. In low-income countries in particular, respiratory infections and diarrhoeal diseases are especially important. For the purposes of this paper, we defi ne southeast Asia as the ten member countries of the Association of Southeast Asian Nations (ASEAN), a region with growing geopolitical infl uence in view of Asia's global economic ascendancy. The ASEAN countries are Brunei, Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Malaysia, Myanmar, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand, and Vietnam.",

The estimated cost of SARS to east and southeast Asia was US$18 billion, which is roughly US$2 million per person infected. 24 In southeast Asia, the sudden collapse in demand for the service industry was a dominant feature in this cost, particularly in view of a tourist industry reliant on the 35 million tourists arriving every year from outside the region. 25 Indeed, the relation between public health and socioeconomic eff ects is by no means linear. Bovine spongiform encephalopathy and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in the UK illustrated this eff ect. Fear, anxiety, and changes in behaviour and the eff ect on the tourist industry have unpredictable consequences. Before 2009, the World Bank estimated a possible global cost of an infl uenza pandemic at around US$1\u00b725 to 2 trillion. 26 The Asian Development Bank estimated a shock to demand might cost southeast Asia up to US$283 billion. 27 Moreover, the costs of emerging infectious diseases, including pandemics, do not fall evenly. Although emerging infectious diseases have until now disproportionately aff ected low-income countries, 1 and the poorest within society were aff ected the most, 28 pandemics have the potential to disrupt highly interconnected and high-income areas such as Singapore. 27, 29 The economic consequences of H5N1 infl uenza have been diff erent from those of SARS in southeast Asia. The region's tourist industry collapsed overnight as a result of SARS. Although aff ected, the industry has been aff ected less by H5N1. The poultry industry, by contrast, was profoundly aff ected. Control policies during the 2003-04 H5N1 outbreak in Vietnam led to the culling of 45 million birds at an estimated cost of almost US$118 million. 30 Furthermore, insuffi cient reimburse ment after a ban on the sale of so-called backyard poultry in Vietnam lowered the household income for poor families disproportionately by com parison with wealthier families. 26 In Thailand, where the highly industrialised poultry export market is an important contributor to the national economy, exports were banned. 31 In 2003, poultry meat exports were worth US$597\u00b76 million. A year later, they had had fallen by 93% to US$43\u00b75 million. 32 Avian infl uenza continues to exact an economic strain in the region, with new cases in poultry or wild birds reported this year from Cambodia, Vietnam, Laos, and Myanmar (Indonesia is endemic for H5N1 in birds, but does not report current outbreaks). Surprisingly, the potential economic eff ect of other emerging infectious diseases in southeast Asia, and analyses of the operational capacity of health systems to respond, have received little robust research attention.",

Around 48% of people in the region live in urban areas, a fi gure which is expected to grow to more than 70% by 2050 (webappendix p 1). 37 Urbanisation is associated with changes in social structures, increased personal mobility, and extended and changing social networks. 39 It is also a driving force behind some vector-borne diseases-for example, dengue, which has seen a resurgence in southeast Asia during the past 50 years. This resurgence has been linked to the establishment of (often impoverished) periurban areas in which the collection and storage of water, because of a lack of reliable water and sanitation systems and the accumulation of social detritus such as used tyres, provide breeding sites for Aedes aegypti mosquitoes. 21 Birth rates, which are highest in the poorest countries in the region, also have consequences for infectious disease transmission because of the eff ect of immunologically naive individuals who perpetuate epidemics. Fortunately, the demographic shift towards decreased birth and mortality rates across southeast Asia might help to lower the transmission of some diseases, and there is evidence of such an eff ect on dengue in Thailand. 40",

Although a containment programme, currently funded by the Bill & Melinda Gates Foundation, is in place, there is an acceptance that \"the actual geographic extent of resistance is unknown\". 20 China, has seen a sharp increase in cross-border migration in recent years. Much of this migration is driven by poverty, with migrant workers moving from the low-income countries of Laos, Cambodia, and Myanmar to Thailand, a middle-income country. Thailand is estimated to have 1\u00b75-2 million immigrants from neighbouring countries, and about 150 000 refugees. Large-scale migration of economic and political refugees, including the frequent movements of hill tribe populations along with their livestock, present substantial challenges to cross-border disease control in the Mekong Basin subregion. Furthermore, undocumented migrants often live in unhygienic and overcrowded conditions (particularly in camps such as those along the Thailand-Myanmar border) with poor access to health services, with infectious diseases such as malaria being an important cause of morbidity and death. 14, [41] [42] [43] In addition to human movements, increased crossborder trade of livestock and wildlife is also a concern. Trading centres, for example, can act as mixing bowls for \"humans and dozens of other species before they are shipped to other markets, sold locally, or even freed and sent back into the wild\". 44 Data for wildlife trade is scarce, although some have estimated that in east and southeast Asia, tens of millions of wild animals cross borders each year regionally and to more distant countries around the world for use as food, pets, or in traditional medicine. 44 Figures suggest that the export of many diff erent species of wild animals increased between 1998 and 2007, although the licit export of birds fell substantially after major importers such as the European Union imposed restrictions in response to H5N1 infl uenza. Along with trade, the natural movements of migratory birds and bats within, to, and from the region are also a key infl uence for several emerging infectious diseases such as H5N1 infl uenza, Japanese encephalitis, and Nipah virus.",

Moreover, there has been a particularly large increase, of more than 30% across the region, in the land area used for rice cultivation. 32 Development of rice paddies can promote transmission of vector-borne diseases such as Japanese encephalitis through their role as vector-breeding sites and by attracting water birds, which are the natural reservoir of Japanese encephalitis. Transmission between birds and mosquitoes is further amplifi ed by transmission in pigs. 21 Countries such as Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, and Myanmar are at risk of increases in Japanese encephalitis because of the combination of intensifi ed rice and pig farming and the absence of vaccination programmes and surveillance. 45 In addition to an increased potential for transmission of Japanese encephalitis, the attraction of various birds to rice paddies has also been associated with increased risk of H5N1 outbreaks in Thailand and Vietnam. 46 Deforestation is continuing across most countries in the region (webappendix p 1). Human encroachment and fragmentation of wildlife habitats through processes such as deforestation increase interactions between wildlife, human beings, and livestock, and thus the potential for pathogens to cross species barriers. In Malaysia, changes in movements and densities of fruit bats due to deforestation, wildfi res, and plantation of fruit orchards, along with the intensifi cation of pig farming close to fruit-bat habitats, have all been postulated as infl uences for the emergence of Nipah virus as a zoonosis in Malaysia. 8, 33, 47 ",

The density of poultry has at least doubled in most countries between 1990 and 2008, and increased more than three-fold in countries such as Myanmar, Laos, and Brunei (webappendix p 1). Increased poultry density is associated with the cumulative number of H5N1 cases in human beings at country level across the region (webappendix p 3). Although backyard and village farms remain the predominant environment for poultry producers in most low-income countries in southeast Asia, industrial production systems dominate in others, such as Thailand. 30, 48 Where poultry production is in a backyard setting or is on a small scale, investment in biosecurity is likely to be low and ill-coordinated. Many species often coexist and the potential for cross-species transmission can be increased. However, as intensive production of single species in large-scale industrial and commercial sectors is becoming more dominant, although this setting might reduce the risk of crossspecies infection, these sites might also act as amplifi ers of disease during the emergence of large-scale outbreaks. Moreover, cross-infection can still occur within the marketplace, where economic imperatives can over-ride public health concerns. 39 In concert with poultry production, pig farming is also intensifying across the region, with densities having at least doubled since 1990 in Myanmar, Laos, Vietnam, Indonesia, and the Philippines (webappendix p 1). This trend is arguably a cause for concern in view of the role of pigs in the transmission of zoonoses such as Nipah virus, Japanese encephalitis, and infl uenza.",

This resistance subsequently spread across Asia and then Africa. Within the past 10 years, reduced susceptibility to the artemisinins has been documented in Cambodia, 52 and concerns that it could spread have raised much concern within the international community. Surveillance information about the scale of artemisinin-resistant malaria in the region remains poor, however.

However, as in other resource-poor regions, capacity for animal health surveillance in southeast Asia is underdeveloped. 53 Major constraints include the absence of specifi c government policies and legal frameworks for surveillance and control of zoonoses, as well as inadequate resources, insuffi cient animal-human public health cooperation, coordination, and collaboration, frail laboratory facilities, and weak and disconnected reporting systems. 54 The emergence of SARS and the H5N1 and H1N1 (2009) viruses focused minds and brought investment. In Laos, for example, until 2004 there was almost no national infrastructure for communicable disease control. 55 Initially, the Law on Hygiene, Disease Prevention and Health Promotion (2001) was the only law that addressed communicable diseases, and it principally applied to prevention rather than control and response. 56 In the wake of H5N1 infl uenza outbreaks, however, the government established several new institutions to strengthen national capacities, including a National Coordination Committee on Communicable Diseases, a National Emerging Infectious Disease Control Offi ce, and a Centre for Laboratory and Epidemiology that has recently been designated the national focal point for the implementation of the International Health Regulations. 56 Similarly, the governments of Vietnam, Thailand, Indonesia, Cambodia, Malaysia, and the Philippines have all set up new institutional bodies, strengthened diagnostic laboratory capacity, and improved coordination mechanisms. Although gaps in national planning and surveillance systems persist, countries in southeast Asia have made substantial progress towards eff ective prevention and control of infectious diseases. 57 Crucially, surveillance systems for infl uenza have started to integrate elements of animal health, particularly poultry-related incidents. 57 For example, rapid response teams have been mobilised and trained to improve community-based surveillance in 331 districts in Indonesia. In Laos and Cambodia, a substantial amount of donor funding has been used to support pandemic preparedness and responses, including development of surveillance systems. Laboratory capacity to handle infl uenza viruses has improved-for example, through the building of biosafety level 3 laboratories in Indonesia and Cambodia for virus sequencing. 57 Regional public health institutions have become sensitive to the threat posed by zoonoses. ASEAN member states have recently endorsed a Regional Mechanism on Animal Health and Zoonoses, to develop a unifi ed framework against threats from animal diseases. 58 Moreover, the integration of animal and human health has been at the centre of WHO's Asia-Pacifi c Strategy on Emerging Diseases-an ambitious strategic framework that aims to develop mechanisms for information sharing between the animal and human health sectors both at regional and country levels, in partnership with the Food and Agriculture Organization and the World Organization for Animal Health. 59 The overlapping functions of some regional institutions and their substantially diff erent geographic coverages are described on webappendix p 4.",

Some of these collaborations are very well integrated into the existing health system structure-for example, the Institut Pasteur, whose facilities have become national institutes in several major provinces of Vietnam. The Institut Pasteur network also includes a facility in Phnom Penh in close collaboration with the Ministry of Health in Cambodia, and another is under construction in Laos in formal association with the Laotian Ministry of Health. In Thailand, the Ministry of Public Health is also actively collaborating with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to work on emerging infectious and tropical diseases, and the Thai and US armies have a collaborative infectious disease research laboratory, the Armed Forces Research Institute of Medical Sciences, which developed from a cholera research laboratory in 1958. 66 The Wellcome Trust centres in Thailand, Vietnam, and Laos have had a longstanding presence, and the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine has a research collaborating centre in the region, in Thailand. Indonesia's recent experience of collaborating with external infectious disease laboratories has been more problematic. Before closing down in 2008, the US Naval Medical Research Unit 2 in Indonesia was charged with political accusations of off ering questionable benefi t to Indonesians during its 30 years of operation and of alleged improper use and export of viral specimens 67 -themes that were to resonate globally with the ongoing debate about the sharing of biological materials and benefi ts that might accrue from the development of vaccines (panel 3).",

For example, three countries in the region (Laos, Cambodia, and Indonesia) spend less per head than has been estimated to be necessary for health system functions to meet the Millennium Development Goals. 57 There are substantial shortages of human resources in some countries in the region. 74 The density of health-care professionals in fi ve of the ten countries (Cambodia, Indonesia, Laos, Myanmar, and Vietnam) is lower than the level defi ned by WHO as adequate. The availability of health-care facilities as proxied by number of hospital beds per head is also very low in Laos, Cambodia, and Indonesia. 75 With existing weakness in health system capacity, many countries in southeast Asia are at risk of being unable to adequately respond to emerging threats from new and re-emerging diseases or to surges in demand that might accompany these diseases. A study that included fi ve southeast Asian countries showed that wide disparities exist in resource capacity not only in aggregate between countries, but also within countries. The northeast of Thailand has, for example, gaps in some health service resources that are more similar to the distribution in Laos and Cambodia than that of central Thailand. Ongoing research within our group suggests that these disparities probably result in inequitable rates of preventable mortality from emerging infectious diseases. 60,76",

This controversial decision was triggered by a dispute over property rights between the Indonesian Government and an Australian company that had used viral strains from Indonesia to produce and market an H5N1 infl uenza vaccine. Indonesia argued that the incident exposed wider issues of exploitation and global inequalities-pharmaceutical companies obtain, free of charge, viral samples that are shared by developing countries with WHO, then patent the resulting products and sell them at prohibitively expensive prices, thus providing benefi ts disproportionately to high-income countries. 68 The controversy forced WHO and its member states to reconsider the current approach to global infl uenza surveillance and the sharing of biological materials, and to create new mechanisms for benefi t sharing. To this aim, in May, 2007, the World Health Assembly adopted a resolution that promoted the \"transparent, fair and equitable sharing of the benefi ts arising from the generation of information, diagnostics, medicines, vaccines and other technologies\", 68 while reasserting the need for timely sharing of both information and biological samples with the Global Infl uenza Surveillance Network. Additionally, it established an intergovernmental meeting to consider further actions aimed at ensuring fair and equitable distribution of pandemic infl uenza vaccines. 69 In 2008, after many debates and negotiations, the Indonesian Government agreed to share H5N1 infl uenza sequences (but not the viral samples) through the new Global Initiative on Sharing Avian Infl uenza Data. 70 The dispute and its underlying issues, however, have not been settled. In 2009, Indonesia did not share any samples with the Global Infl uenza Surveillance Network, including those from pandemic infl uenza A H1N1. Moreover, the initial eff orts to create a more equitable framework for the purchase and distribution of vaccines have not produced any substantial results thus far. Disagreement has arisen because high-income countries are reluctant to accept the suggestion of legally binding obligations to share the benefi ts of vaccines that accrue from sharing of biological samples, whereas many low-income and middle-income countries, notably Indonesia, Thailand, and Brazil, want to see binding obligations. 71 tuberculosis, and malaria, but other diseases that carry a heavy burden of morbidity and mortality in the region are neglected, including traditional childhood diseases, emerging vector-borne diseases, and respiratory infections. A further concern is that disease-focused programmes that receive substantial funding are often poorly integrated within the wider health systems of recipient countries. Many initiatives in southeast Asia signify potentially important reforms-for example, the Linked Response in Cambodia, which aims to improve integration of vertical programmes for HIV, tuberculosis, and maternal and child health, and the incorporation of programmes initiated in response to H5N1 infl uenza into the broader control programme for emerging infectious diseases in Laos. 55 Overarching many of the challenges to governance that we have outlined is a diversity of domestic political institutions, and tensions between and within countries that have the potential to hamper regional eff orts to prevent and control emerging infectious diseases. Southeast Asia has witnessed major political upheavals during the past decade, with military coups (in Thailand), democratic reform (Indonesia), and a shift, albeit at diff ering paces, from Marxism to free market economies (Vietnam, Cambodia, Laos). Tensions also exist between and within countries-for example, a lingering border dispute centred on Preah Vihear temple between Thailand and Cambodia, an ongoing ethnic separatist insurgency in the south of Thailand, recent violence associated with elections in the Philippines, and terrorist attacks on tourist areas in Indonesia. The ongoing military dictatorship in Myanmar is a continuing regional concern. Emerging infectious diseases too have the potential to fan the fl ames of ethnic tensions. Recently, pigs-raised predominantly by non-Muslims in Egypt and Malaysia, both countries with predominantly Muslim populations-were a focus of concern regarding the H1N1 and Nipah viruses, respectively. These political, ethnic, and religious tensions all have the potential to create instability that aff ects the emergence and response to emerging infectious diseases.",
