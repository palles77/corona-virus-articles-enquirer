In the presence of the glucosidase inhibitor N-methyl-ldeoxynojirimycin the viral glycoproteins were equipped with oligosaccharides of the composition GIc 3Man84GIcNAc), and the yield of virus in the extracellular medium was reduced as a result of a block in the proteolytic cleavage of the precursor (pE2) of the E2 viral envelope glycoprotein . The mannosidase I inhibitor 1-deoxymannojirimycin (dMM) also inhibited the appearance of virus in the medium and the oligosaccharides on the viral glycoproteins had the composition Man e(GIcNAc), . However, pE2 was cleaved to E2 under these conditions, and it was found that when the yield of virus from the cells and medium together was considered, there was no difference between untreated and dMM-treated cultures, suggesting the presence of intracellular virus particles in the dMM-treated cultures . When examined by electron microscopy, the dMM-treated cultures were found to contain intracellular virus particles . In addition, nucleocapsids were found lining intracellular membranes . These observations taken together with the plaque test data intimate that Sindbis virus preferentially buds from internal membranes in BHK cells treated with dMM . The results confirm the essential role of glucose trimming in the Sindbis virus-BHK cell system and suggest that the initial stages of mannose removal maybe important too . W 1987 Academic Press, Inc . Sindbis virus, aTogavirus, is a simple RNA-containing virus consisting of a nucleocapsid surrounded by a membrane in which the two viral glycoproteins, E 1 and E2, are embedded . The viral proteins are generated by sequential proteolytic cleavage of the 26 S mRNA translation product (Garoff et al., 1982) . The E 1 and E2 et al., 1983) have oligosaccharides of the structure Glc 3 Man 7 , e , g(GIcNAc)2 , whereas in the presence of bromoconduritol (Datema et al., 1982) the oligosaccharides have the composition Glc,Man 7, a , 9 (GleNAc) 2 .",

As expected from the requirement of cleavage of pE2 for virus formation, the release of virus particles is decreased in the inhibitor-treated cells . This effect can be reversed by lowering the incubation temperature from 37 to 30\u00b0 (Schlesinger et at, 1985) . This infers that pE2 equipped with glucosylated high-mannose oligosaccharides has a conformation resistant to proteolytic cleavage . It was therefore of interest to determine whether glucose trimming alone was sufficient to allow virus maturation or whether mannose trimming is also required . Thus the relative roles of glucose and mannose trimming in Sindbis virus maturation in BHK cells were investigated by the use of glucosidase (MdN) and mannosidase I (dMM) inhibitors .",

In contrast to dMM the mannosidase II inhibitorswainsonine had no inhibitory effect on virus formation . To check for possible toxic (nonspecific) effects of MdN or dMM, BHK cells were infected with a strain of influenza virus adapted to growth in these cells, and treated with MdN or dMM . Previous studies had shown that MdN (Romero et al., 1983) and dMM (Elbein et al., 1984) do not affect the formation of influenza virus . Indeed, no change in the hemagglutination titer in MdN-or dMM-treated cultures with respect to the untreated control was observed (data not shown) . When the infected cells were incubated at 33\u00b0 instead of 37\u00b0, the inhibitory effects of MdN on the yield of virus were reduced (Table 1) , thus confirming that the block induced by inhibiting glucose removal is temperature sensitive (Schlesinger et al., 1985) .

Previous studies (Datema etal., 1984 ; Schlesingeretal., 1985) have shown that in Sindbis virus-infected BHK cells treated with the glucosidase inhibitors bromoconduritol and 1-deoxynojirimycin, the pE2 to F2 cleavage is blocked, resulting in a reduction in the yield of virus . To investigate if proteolysis was blocked in cells treated with the trimming inhibitors in the present study, treated cells were labeled with 14C-labeled amino acids for 2 hr at 4 hr postinfection and the cell lysates were analyzed by SDS-PAGE (Fig . 2) . Untreated cultures showed the formation of pE2, El, and E2 glycoproteins and the capsid protein C (Fig . 2, lane 1) . In the presence of 1 mM MdN it appeared that no E2 was present (Fig . 2 , lane 2), indicating that the pE2 to E2 cleavage was impaired in these cells . In the presence of 2 mM dMM no block is evident (Fig . 2, lane 3) . The E1 and E2 proteins synthesized in the presence of dMM migrate very close together on SDS-PAGE due to alterations in the oligosaccharide side-chains of these glycoproteins induced by the mannosidase inhibitor . Under normal conditions in virus produced in BHK cells the El protein contains two complex oligosaccharides, whereas the E2 protein contains one complex oligosaccharide and one high-mannose oligosaccharide (Hsieh et al ., 1983a) . In the presence of dMM both proteins are glycosylated exclusively with high-mannose oligosaccharides (Man 9 (GIcNAc)z) as shown in Fig . 1 . It was to be expected that the change in molecular weight of El due to the conversion of two complex oligosaccharides to two high-mannose oligosaccharides would be greater than that in E2 in which only one complex oligosaccharide is converted . Cultures treated with the mannosidase II inhibitor swainsonine also showed no or 500 ng/ml SW (lane 4) and were labeled with 10 \u00b5Ci'\"C-labeled protein hydrolysate at 37\u00b0 for 2 hr from 4 hr postintection .

The suspected impairment in the pE2 to E2 cleavage in MdN-treated cultures was further investigated by pulse-chase labeling with [ 35S]methionine in the absence and presence of the trimming inhibitors (Fig . 3) . Thus in the untreated cultures and in those treated with dMM and SW the pE2 precursor formed during the pulse is absent after chasing with unlabeled medium for 60 min (Fig . 3, lanes 1, 3, and 4) . However, in the MdN-treated culture (Fig . 3, lane 2) , pE2 is still present after the 60-min chase . Thus in the presence The cells from one set of plates were then harvested and prepared for SDS-PAGE (p) . In the other set the medium was removed, the cells were washed three times with warm phosphate-buffered saline, and fresh medium containing the appropriate inhibitor and 1 mM unlabeled methionine was added . The cells were incubated at 37\u00b0f or 60 min and then harvested for SDS-PAGE (c).

In order to test for this possibility, the yields of infectious virus in the medium alone and in the medium plus cells taken together after freezing and thawing three times to release any intracellular virus particles were determined ( Table 2) . Comparison of the virus titers between untreated and dMM-treated cultures shows that when only the medium is considered, the yield of virus in the dMM-treated cultures is significantly lower than that in the control (Student's t test P < 0 .05) . However, there are no significant differences between untreated and dMM-treated cultures when the yield of virus in medium plus cells is considered (Student's t test P > 0 .1) .

Therefore to distinguish between these two possibilities electron microscopy of untreated and dMM-treated Sindbis virus-infected BHK cells was performed (Figs . 4a-4d) .

At least one critical step is impeded when glucose trimming does not occur, the proteolytic cleavage of pE2 to E2 . This cleavage has been previously shown to be required for virus release (reviewed by Garoff et al., 1982) and it has been postulated that pE2 equipped with glucosylated high-mannose oligosaccharides does not go through a conformational rearrangement which makes the protein susceptible to cleavage (Schlesinger et al., 1985) . The question remained, where in the trimming pathway does this conformational change take place? Here it has been shown that when glucose trimming is allowed to occur and mannose removal is prevented by inhibiting Golgi mannosidase I, pE2 is cleaved to E2 . This is an example of the essential role for glucose trimming in glycoprotein biosynthesis . Allowing glucose trimming, but preventing subsequent mannose trimming, restores the yield of infectious virus to control levels, although the virus in dMM-treated cultures appears to bud from intracellular membranes to a greater extent than virus in untreated cultures as demonstrated by a decrease in the yield of cell-free virus and by electron microscopy . These findings support the proposal (Rots et al, 1975 ) that intracellular membranes represent a site of second choice for the formation of enveloped viruses as has been demonstrated for influenza virus (Rott et al., 1975 ; Stitz et at, 1977 Rc . 4 . Electron microscopy of untreated and 1-deoxymannojirimycin-treated Sindbis virus-infected BHK cells . Virus-infected cells either untreated (a) or treated (b-d) with 2 mM dMM from 1 hr postinfection were incubated for B-15 hr, and harvested and prepared for electron microscopy (Scholtissek et af., 1978) . (b-d) Virus particles (arrows) inside dMM-treated Sindbis virus-infected BHK cells at 8 hr (b) and 15 hr (c, d) postinfection . Viral nucleocapsids (N) are seen lining the internal membranes in (d), an effect reminiscent of that observed in monensin-treated cells (Johnson and Schlesinger, 1980) . (a) Virus particles budding from the cell surface in untreated cultures . The bar represents 0 .2 AM. thatt small alterations in carbohydrate structure of the Sindbis viral glycoproteins, as brought about by an inhibitor of oligosaccharide processing, can lead to the choice of such a second site . The oligosaccharide composition of the glycoproteins from virus budding from intracellular membranes in untreated cultures is not known, but it is possible that such virus contains a higher proportion of glycoproteins with less processed oligosaccharide than virus released by budding from the plasma membrane .",

It is interesting that when mannose trimming is blocked later in the pathway by inhibiting the action of Golgi mannosidase II with swainsonine (Table 1 ) or by growing the virus in mutant cells lacking GIcNAc transferase I (Schlesingeretal., 1976 ), no effect on virus maturation was observed . Thus it would appear that the initial stages of mannose trimming may be important for determining the final destination of the Sindbis viral glycoproteins in infected BHK cells . This apparent observation of preferential intracellular budding when preventing mannose trimming may be analogous to the result that in Sindbis virus-infected mosquito cells, the virus buds from internal membranes (Gliedman et al., 1975) . Mosquito cells lack the terminal glycosyltransferases necessary for the formation of complex-type oligosaccharides (Butters and Hughes, 1981 ; Butters et al., 1981) and the glycoproteins are equipped with oligosaccharides of the composition Man 3(GIcNAc)2 at the glycosylation sites which would carry exclusively complex oligosaccharides in avian or mammalian cells (Hsieh and Robbins . 1984) .
