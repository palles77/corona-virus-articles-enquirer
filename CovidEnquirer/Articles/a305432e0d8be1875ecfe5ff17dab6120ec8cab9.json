One clone of 2.0-kb contained part of the poly(A) tail and was sequenced in its entirety using the chemical method of Maxam and Gilbert. Another clone of 0.7 kb also contained part of the poly(A) tail and was sequenced in part to confirm the primary structure of the most 3' end of the genome. Two potential, nonoverlapping genes were identified within the 3'terminal 1663-base sequence from an examination of open reading frames. The first gene encodes a 382-amino acid protein of 43,426 mol wt, that is the apparent nucleocapsid protein on the basis of size, chemical properties, and amino acid sequence homology with other coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins. It is flanked on its 5' side by at least part of the matrix protein gene. The second encodes a hypothetical 78.amino acid protein of 9101 mol wt that is hydrophobic at both ends. A 3'-proximal noncoding sequence of 276 bases was also determined and a conserved stretch of 9 nucleotides near the poly(A) tail was found to be common among TGEV, the mouse hepatitis coronavirus, and the avian infectious bronchitis coronavirus.",

In this paper we describe experiments that begin to examine the TGEV genome by this approach. cDNA clones were prepared from the 3' terminal 10% of the polyadenylated genome and were sequenced. Two potential genes were identified within the first 1663 bases. One gene encodes a protein of 382 amino acids which is the apparent nucleocapsid protein on the basis of size, chemical properties, and significant amino acid sequence homology with other coronavirus nucleocapsid proteins. This gene is flanked on its immediate 5' side by at least part of the matrix protein gene. The second gene lies to the 3'side of the nucleocapsid protein gene and encodes a hypothetical protein of 78 amino acids that is hydrophobic at both ends. A 3' noncoding sequence of 276 bases sharing a g-base conserved sequence near the poly A tail with other coronaviruses was also determined.",

Virus was purified from clarified supernatant fluids as previously described (Brian et al, 1980) except that all sucrose solutions were made up in TMEN (10 mM Tris-maleate, pH 6.0, 100 mMNaC1, 1 mMEDTA). Viral RNA in 1 of 10 flasks was radiolabeled in order to follow the purification of the RNA. For these radiolabeled cultures, infected cells were refed with phosphate-free medium containing 1% fetal calf serum and 40 &i [32P]orthophosphate (ICN) per milliliter. Viral RNA was extracted by dissolving the virus pellet in 0.5 ml TNE (10 mM Trishydrochloride, pH 7.5,lOO mMNaC1, 1 mM EDTA) containing 1% SDS and 0.5 mg proteinase K per milliliter, incubating for 0.5 hr at 37\", and extracting twice with an equal volume of a mixture of 50% phenol/ 48% chloroform/2% isoamyl alcohol. RNA was ethanol precipitated after adding 0.1 volume 2 M sodium acetate. Because small molecular weight RNA species are found in some preparations of purified coronavirion RNA, full-length genomic RNA to be used for cDNA cloning and making probe for colony screening was selected by rate-zonal sedimentation on preformed linear gradients of 15 to 30% sucrose (wt/ wt) made up in TNE-0.1% SDS. RNA was dissolved in water and sedimented 1.5 hr at 110,000 g, 25\", on 5-ml gradients. Fractions of 0.2 ml were collected and the distribution of radioactivity was determined by Cerenkov counting. Only RNA sedimenting with a sedimentation coefficient of 50 S or greater, as determined by reference to sedimentation of mammalian 28 S and 18 S ribosomal RNA in a parallel gradient, was recovered by ethanol precipitation and used in the experiments described below.",

First, it is rich in serine. Thirty-nine (lO%)of the residues are serine making it the most abundant amino acid. Assuming this protein is phosphorylated at serine residues, as is the MHV A59 protein (Stohlman and Lai, 1979) TagI, P&I, and &I sites, derived by restriction endonuclease mapping, and the Hind111 and SalI sites in the multiple cloning region of the pUC9 vector, were the sites used for initial DNA sequencing.

This AUG, therefore, probably identifies the authentic beginning of the TGEV nucleocapsid gene since the sequence from this point leftward to the end of clone FG5, except for a 12-base intergenic sequence, reveals an open reading frame coding for a protein sharing extensive regions of amino acid homology with the small matrix glycoprotein (M or El) of the mouse hepatitis virus A59 (Armstrong et al., 1984; discussed below) .",

An open reading frame beginning at base 1507 and extending through base 1740 encodes a hypothetical 78 amino acid protein of 9101 mol wt (Fig. 2) . A hydrophobicity analysis of the protein reveals that it is hydrophobic for a stretch of approximately 25 amino acids at each end and it is hydrophilic in its central region. There are eight basic amino acids and four acidic amino acids giving the protein a net +4 charge at neutral pH. Basic and acidic amino acids are distributed evenly throughout the central hydrophilic region, but 4 basic amino acids and no acidic ones are found among the 27 amino acids at the carboxy terminus. There is yet no direct evidence for this protein. DISCUSSION We present the primary nucleotide sequence for the TGEV nucleocapsid protein (N) gene and the deduced amino acid sequence for the protein. This is the first primary sequence data for a coronavirus in the antigenic subgroup to which TGEV belongs, and such information allows one to first, firmly conclude that TGEV shares an ancestral relationship with MHV and IBV, and second, to identify potentially functional domains on the N protein by examining conserved structures among the diverged viruses. The first two coronavirus N gene sequences to be described are those of the closely related JHM and A59 strains of MHV (Armstrong et al, 1983; Skinner and Siddell, 1983) and between these an overall homology of 94% was found for both the nucleotide and amino acid sequences, reflecting the antigenic similarities between the viruses. Interestingly, the antigenically distinct avian infectious bronchitis virus shows no N gene nucleotide sequence homology with MHV, yet shares an overall amino acid sequence homology of 26% (Boursnell et al., 1985) . Furthermore, there is a stretch of 67 amino acids within of serines. (ii) Three cluster groups of 5the amino terminal one-third of the protein 29 basic amino acid residues are found in that shows a sequence homology of 51% parallel with TGEV amino acid positions between the viruses (Boursnell et aL, 1985) O-30, 150-260, and 330-350. (iii) A cluster suggesting that a strong selective pressure of 9-11 acidic amino acid residues is found exists for a specific functional group defined within the last 32 amino acids at the carby this sequence. This interesting pattern boxy terminus. repeats itself in the structure of the TGEV Although TGEV would appear to be N protein. Although TGEV shows no an-equally diverged from IBV and MHV on tigenic relatedness to either MHV or IBV the basis of amino acid sequence, TGEV (Pedersen et aZ., 1978) , and no N gene nu-more closely resembles MHV in its genome cleotide homology with either MHV or IBV, arrangement. Firstly, like MHV, the N it does show an overall amino acid homol-gene for TGEV is flanked on its 5' side by ogy of 27 and 26% with MHV (JHM) and the matrix protein (M or El) gene, whereas IBV, respectively. Furthermore, the con-for IBV, two genes, derived from overlapserved 67 amino acid region is also found ping reading frames and encoding hypoin TGEV (becoming 68 positions when thetical proteins of unknown function, lie TGEV is compared; Fig. 4 ). This conserved between the M and N genes (Armstrong et region is slightly more basic than the over-al, 1984; Boursnell and Brown, 1984) .

The significance of the noncoding region is not completely known although it undoubtedly functions as an attachment region for the polymerase to initiate synthesis of the negative strand RNA. One possible site that may be critical for recognition or binding is a lo-base sequence, GGGAA-GAGCT, that is conserved between IBV (found 81 bases from the 3' end) and MHV (82 bases from the end). With the exception of the first base, a T instead of G, TGEV shares an identical sequence beginning 77 bases from the 3' end (Fig. 2) .",
