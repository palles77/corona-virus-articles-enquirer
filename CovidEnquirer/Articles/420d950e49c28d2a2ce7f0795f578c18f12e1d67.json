The spectrum of these diseases often differs from those observed in macaque species, and veterinarians caring for common marmosets need to be aware of these unique susceptibilities. In formulating differential diagnoses for sick or diseased animals, it should be recognized that diseases once common in imported animals in the 1960s and 1970s are now rare. It is also important to recognize that housing and sanitation conditions can influence exposure to potentially pathogenic bacteria. In a zoological setting where mixedor free-ranging exhibits are utilized, animals may be exposed to many more potential pathogens, than would be the case in animals raised in a barrier facility.",

The remaining lymph nodes often appear hyperplastic. Ziehle Neelsen stains reveal small numbers of acid-fast bacilli both within regions of caseous necrosis and within multinucleated giant cells. The findings are similar to those previously described for M. kansasii infection in squirrel monkeys [13] and differ from those seen with NTM in immunocompromised hosts. It is important to note that these morphological features appear similar or identical to MTC infections of nonhuman primates, and histopathology cannot be used to distinguish the two different infections (Fig. 16 .2).

Purified protein derivative (PPD) used in the human TST is not appropriate. The animals are then visually examined at 24, 48, and 72 h for evidence of redness of swelling.

While a standard face mask does not provide respiratory protection, it does help contain aerosols generated by the wearer when coughing or sneezing. Protection from infected individuals may be more difficult or impossible in zoological settings in which animals are free ranging and may come in contact with visitors. These animals may be at greater risk of contracting tuberculosis as indicated by recent surveys conducted in neotropical primates in Brazil [20, 21] .",

Typical EPEC carry a gene encoding the bundleforming pilus (bfp), which is responsible for initial attachment of the bacteria to enterocytes. The organisms possess a type 3 secretion system (T3SS), which allows the direct insertion of more than 25 bacterial proteins into the target cell's cytoplasm. Intimin is an outer membrane protein encoded by the eaeA gene and is required for full virulence of the organism. Intimin binds to the translocated intimin receptor (Tir), which has been introduced into the target cell membrane by the T3SS. Tire intimin interaction initiates full adherence of the organism to the target cell surface, and subsequent phosphorylation of intracytoplasmic Tir domains causes polymerization of actin. It is this effect on actin that results in effacement of the brush border and the formation of an attachment pedestal, both of which can be recognized ultrastructurally. The eventual induction of diarrhea correlates with these morphological changes in enterocytes and is caused by the destruction of the microvilli and tight junctions [39] .",

These E. coli strains have been associated with urogenital tract infections, septicemia, and meningitis in humans [40, 41] . Their clinical relevance in marmosets requires further investigation. CNF-positive E. coli also have been isolated from macaques [42] . In a recent study, the prevalence of cytotoxins encoded by pks and cnf in E. coli cultured from rectal swabs of marmosets housed in three separate colonies was documented. Isolates of E. coli were identified and characterized biochemically. Specific PCR for pks and cnf gene amplification and phylogenetic group identification were performed on all E. coli strains. A total of 139 E. coli strains were isolated from 120 of the 138 marmosets (87%) in the three colonies. In Colony A, 31 strains of E. coli were isolated from 25 of the 31 animals; 55% of the animals had pks\u00fe E. coli, and 52% had cnf\u00fe E. coli. In Colony B, 33 strains of E. coli were isolated from 32 of the 33 animals, 6% of the animals had pks\u00fe E. coli, and 9% had cnf\u00fe E. coli. In Colony C, 75 strains of E. coli were isolated from 63 of the 74 animals, 43% of the animals had pks\u00fe E. coli, and 35% had cnf\u00fe E. coli. Both pks\u00fe and cnf\u00fe E. coli strains belonged mainly to phylogenetic group B2. Colibactin and CNF cytotoxic activities were confirmed using a HeLa cell cytotoxicity assay. The presence of pks\u00fe or cnf\u00fe E. coli did not correlate with health status. However, given the association of these cytotoxin-producing E. coli strains with clinical disease in humans, the colonization of marmosets with these cytotoxin-producing E. coli can potentially cause clinical and subclinical diseases that impact marmoset models [39a] .",

In human patients with noninvasive salmonellosis, symptoms generally resolve in 5e7 days with supportive therapy [54] . Systemic antibiotics are reserved for individuals with invasive disease (enteric fever). Diagnosis of invasive disease can be problematic and relies on clinical findings as well as blood cultures and isolation of the organism. As the natural history of salmonellosis is poorly described in neotropical primates, criteria for initiation of antimicrobial therapy have not been established.

Both are susceptible to macrolide and fluoroquinolone antimicrobials, which can effectively eliminate the organisms from infected individuals.

In addition, in the recent study, lesions of the hepatobiliary and gastrointestinal systems were recognized and characterized by prominent inflammatory changes in a relatively high percentage of animals [62] . In the liver, the inflammatory lesions consisted of lymphoid infiltrates in hepatic portal regions as well as mild-to-moderate infiltrates in the mucosa and submucosal tissues of large bile ducts and gallbladder. Occasional animals had mild-to-moderate cholangiohepatitis, and several marmosets had cholecystitis with transmural lymphocytic infiltration of the gallbladder. Lymphoid infiltrates increased in incidence and severity with age [62] . Enteric pathology consisted of a continuous spectrum of IBD changes ranging from relatively minimal focal to segmental lymphoid infiltrates in the lamina propria to severe lymphoid cell accumulations with effacement of the normal bowel architecture in both large and small intestines. Severe accumulations of chronic inflammatory cells found in the lamina propria were associated with changes in villous and crypt architecture, with intraepithelial inflammatory cell accumulations.

Serological surveys of neotropical primates suggest that nonclinical infection with the icterohemorrhagiae serogroup may be common in these species, including common marmosets [83] .",

Both adult animals presented with weight loss and jaundice and succumbed to disease despite antimicrobial and supportive therapy. Complete blood counts on presentation of the first case revealed neutrophilic leukocytosis with a left shift and a regenerative anemia. Serum chemistries demonstrated markedly elevated total and direct bilirubin consistent with intravascular hemolysis. Clinical coagulopathy, a common finding in Weil's disease (icteric leptospirosis) of humans and reported in previous nonhuman primate cases, was not observed. The animal died 17 days into the course of treatment, and necropsy revealed diffuse severe proximal tubular nephrosis in which spirochetes could be demonstrated by Steiner's silver stain. The second case, presented on the same day and while initially recovering with antimicrobial treatment, presented 3 months later with progressive weight loss and jaundice. Histological examination of tissues obtained at necropsy revealed lymphoplasmacytic infiltrates in a number of organs, including the gastrointestinal tract and kidney. Seroconversion to Leptospira borgpetersenii serovar Ballum was demonstrated in the second case.",

The alveolar septa were thickened by infiltrating macrophages, neutrophils, and lymphocytes. Multifocal myofiber necrosis with interstitial edema and hemorrhage was observed in the skeletal muscle.
