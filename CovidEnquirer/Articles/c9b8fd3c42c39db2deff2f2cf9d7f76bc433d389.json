The nasal cannula was inserted into the manikin's nostrils, and the cannula was connected to the high-flow nasal therapy device. The device was then turned on for 10 min at a flow rate of 60 L/min. One hour later, the paper was collected, and the number of spots on the sheets was enumerated. A measurement closest to the manikin's face was performed separately with the same design because the paper may affect the dispersal. As a control experiment, the device was kept in the stand-by mode for 10 min to confirm that there was no detection of water on the paper. In the next experiment, the effect of the patient touching and repositioning the cannula was assessed by manually repositioning the cannula once during use of the device.

Air flow generated by the high-flow nasal therapy device is blown into a relatively closed nasal cavity compared with the open space of hand dryers. This may limit much of the droplet dispersal to inside the nasal and oral cavities. Another possible explanation is that the flow volume and velocity of the air flow of the high-flow nasal therapy are relatively small (60 L/min, 30 km/h) compared with those of jet dryers that can be up to 2100 L/min, 640 km/h. Our data suggest that it is likely that high-flow nasal therapy does not increase the potential risk of droplet and contact infection. However, there is a possibility that the device generates smaller particles (aerosol) that may remain in the air and may cause airborne infection rather than droplet infection. Another limitation of this study is that we did not include human subjects. Further studies with human subjects may provide further evidence of the safety of the nasal highflow therapy.",
