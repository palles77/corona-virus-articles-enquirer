            "text": "state of the art of our current knowledge of the protein domain universe [11, 18] . However, many protein 15 sequences escape, at least partially, domain annotation, particularly in non-model organisms and remain 16 in the so-called dark protein sequence universe [4] . Classical methodological approaches model protein 17 domain families as Hidden Markov Models (HMMs). However, to that aim, sequences need to be clustered 18 and aligned based on the identification of sequence similarities. Therefore, proteins from organisms distant 19 from the species considered in the model, fast diverging proteins, recently emerged domains and domains 20 containing disordered regions, are less likely to be annotated using this methodology [5]. Here, in order to 21 provide a comprehensive view of protein domain architectures, we present a standalone software named 22 42 REMOte homoLOgy) [9]. Using as queries domains delineated using Seg-HCA, remote similarity search 43 is performed against protein sequences from the Uniprot database [29] using HHBlits [25]. For each hit, Therefore, the HCA score scales with the density in hydrophobic clusters and in hydrophobic residues 112 inside the clusters. As the HCA score calculation motivation is to provide an estimation of the globular 113 character, i.e. the foldability of an HCA domain, the value of each of the three classes was optimized to 114 maximize the separation between the distributions of the HCA scores computed on disordered sequences 115 5/16 .

This score is compared to an 33 empirical distribution computed over 734 disordered protein sequences from DisProt v7 [20] to produce 34 a p-value. Figure 1A shows the distributions of scores computed using non redundant sequences of The second methodology included in the package is our TREMOLO-HCA software (Traveling through Figure 1 : HCA score and HCA plot example.

Panel B, right, shows the HCA plots of three BRCT domains from the Pfam family (PF00533).

Hydrophobic clusters de-82 fined in this way (with this hydrophobic alphabet and the connectivity distance associated with the 83 \u03b1-helix) have been shown to match at best regular secondary structures (\u03b1-helices and \u03b2-strands) and 84 to constitute hallmarks of folded domains [8, 30] .

Conserved protein sequence positions can therefore be inspected in the context of their 61 hydrophobic cluster organization (Figure 1B). The second drawing functionality is a new methodology 62 built on the TREMOLO results to easily visualize the known protein domain annotation (from Interpro) 63 and the newly delineated domains in an evolutionary context by using the NCBI taxonomic database. 64 The tree is automatically built by fetching the taxonomic id of the Uniprot target sequences found 65 by TREMOLO thanks to the ete3 python package. The Seg-HCA domains of TREMOLO can then 66 be analyzed in the context of their protein domain arrangement and visualized in terms of taxonomic 67 specificity and domain association (Fig. S1). The HCA toolkit is written in python3 and is provided 68 under the CeCILL-C license agreement.
