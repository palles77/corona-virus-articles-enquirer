            "text": "The rise in the incidence of atopic disease, including asthma, over the past several decades has not been limited to a particular geographic area and has occurred in developed and developing countries. Several factors influence the development and severity of asthma, including atopy, environmental exposures, genetic predisposition, gene-environment interactions, stress, obesity, diet, socioeconomic status, and infection. The ''Hygiene Hypothesis'' [1, 2] has focused attention on the role of infection in the development of allergic disease. This hypothesis suggests that infections in early life can have a protective effect on the development of asthma and atopy. Other researchers have suggested, however, that infection may be a cause for the onset and persistence of asthma. In this ''Hit and Run Hypothesis,'' a pathogen promotes dysregulation of the immune system, leading to prolonged inflammatory responses even after the pathogen has been cleared [3] . Thus, the role of infectious agents in the development of asthma is complex: Evidence implicates infections as causal and protective with respect to asthma development.",

Many asthma episodes are preceded by upper respiratory tract symptoms and may last several days to weeks, in contrast with allergen-induced asthma exacerbations, where exposure often leads to a rapid onset of symptoms with a recovery time of approximately 24 hours [4, 5] . Infections have been linked to asthma exacerbations since the 1950s, and over the past several decades there has been extensive investigation 0889 of infectious agents as they relate to asthma development and exacerbations.

            "text": "Respiratory tract infections (RTIs) are the most common cause of acute illness in adults and children, with upper respiratory infections (URIs) constituting the majority of such illnesses [6] . Adults typically experience two to four URIs per year, and children may have up to 12 URIs per year [7] . RTIs are the major cause of visits to primary care physicians [8] and are associated with significant work and school absenteeism, with an estimated 150 million lost workdays annually. Consequently, RTIs have great economic impact, with an estimated cost of $40 billion annually in the United States [9] . Numerous viruses produce URIs (Table 1) , and because the symptom patterns are common between many viruses, it is difficult to determine clinically the specific viral etiology of an acute illness ( Table 2) . Viral infections commonly trigger asthma exacerbations, having been noted in nearly half of asthma exacerbations in adults [10] and in an even greater percentage of exacerbations in children. This was demonstrated in a 13-month study investigating the role of viral infections in asthma exacerbations in 114 children 9 to 11 years of age with asthma [11] . Peak expiratory flow (PEF) rate was performed twice daily, and upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms were recorded daily. Virologic samples were obtained within 48 hours of an increase in upper or lower respiratory symptoms, a fall in PEF by more than 50 L/min from the child's baseline, or if the parent subjectively felt that the child was developing a cold. Evidence of a viral infection was detected in 80% to 85% of episodes with respiratory tract symptoms, fall in PEF, or both. The highest detection rate occurred during reported episodes of wheeze, cough, and upper respiratory tract symptoms, together with a decline in PEF. In addition, the severity of a respiratory illness may influence the outcome of a URI because more severe viral infections seem more likely than mild infections to lead to exacerbations of asthma [5] . Viral infection has been noted more often during severe exacerbations of asthma than during milder exacerbations [12] .",

A comparison of several retrospective studies of children admitted for bronchiolitis found that the postbronchiolitis group had a significantly higher frequency of bronchial obstructive symptoms 2 to 10 years later and, when pulmonary function studies were performed, diminished FEV 1 or increased bronchial reactivity compared with healthy control subjects [35] . These findings were confirmed in a prospective study when children hospitalized with confirmed RSV bronchiolitis were evaluated at 7.5 years of age and compared with age-and gender-matched control subjects [36] . By 7.5 years of age, the cumulative prevalence of asthma was 30% in the RSV group versus 3% in the control group, and current asthma was present in 23% of the RSV group versus 2% of the control group. However, the duration of the effect of RSV infection on asthma-related symptoms appears to be limited. In a prospective study of 1246 children enrolled at birth, 207 developed an RSV LTRI not requiring hospitalization during the first 3 years of life [37] . When compared with a control group of children with no LRTI documented during the first 3 years of life, the group with mild RSV LRTI had a substantially increased risk of frequent wheeze at 6 years of age (odds ratio [OR] 4.3), and the risk for frequent wheeze remained significantly increased at 11 years of age (OR 2.4), at which time prebronchodilator FEV 1 , but not postbronchodilator FEV 1 , was significantly lower in the RSV group. By age 13 years, there were no significant between-group differences in terms of increased risk for frequent or infrequent wheezing. These studies demonstrate that RSV bronchiolitis is a significant independent risk factor for subsequent frequent wheezing, although this effect seems to decrease with age and may be dependent upon the severity of the RSV infection.",

Both of these studies evaluated specimens collected from previously healthy children during an acute respiratory illness during which no other pathogen was identified and detected evidence of hMPV in 6.4% [46] and 20% [45] of the previously negative samples.",

Several case reports suggest associations between infections with atypical organisms with decreased expiratory flow rates and increased airway hyper-responsiveness in nonasthmatic individuals [50] and the onset of asthma symptoms in previously healthy nonasthmatic adults [51, 52] . Most of these individuals present with complaints of malaise, shortness of breath of gradual onset, and wheezing, which typically resolve after treatment with macrolide antibiotics or oral corticosteroids [51] . Symptoms may progress and persist, as illustrated by an adult male with fever, severe cough, shortness of breath, consolidation on chest radiograph, and evidence of M pneumoniae infection based on a rise in serum antibody titers who subsequently developed wheezing episodes with reversible airway obstruction and airway reactivity to methacholine [52] . Infections with these organisms can persist for months, and animal studies show that M pneumoniae can be detected by PCR for up to 200 days after infection, even though the animals become antibody and culture negative by 70 days [53] . These reports suggest that M pneumoniae may serve as a cause of acute wheezing and a triggering factor for the onset of asthma.",

In a serologically based prospective study, 100 adult patients hospitalized with exacerbations of asthma were compared with hospitalized surgical patients with no history of lung disease at any time or URI in the month before admission [55] . In this series, M pneumoniae was identified more often than any other pathogen in the asthmatic group (18 M pneumoniae, eight C pneumoniae, 11 Influenza A, five Influenza B, three PIV-1, two PIV-2, one PIV-3, six adenovirus, two RSV, three S. pneumoniae, and five Legionella spp.) and in the control group (three M pneumoniae). However, only 8 of the 18 patients had M pneumoniae identified as the sole infectious agent, making it difficult to ascertain the culpability of M pneumoniae as the cause of hospitalization. A study of 71 children with acute wheezing and 80 age-matched healthy children detected M pneumoniae in 22.5% and C pneumoniae in 15.5% of children with wheezing compared with 7.5% and 2.5%, respectively, in healthy control subjects [56] . When the children who were infected with either organism were treated with clarithromycin, improvement in the course of the disease was observed, further supporting the role of these atypical organisms in the exacerbation of asthma. These findings were recently confirmed in a French series, where M pneumoniae infection was found in 20% and C pneumoniae infection was found in 3.4% of children during an acute asthma exacerbation [19] . Acute M pneumoniae infection was confirmed in 50% and C pneumoniae in 8.3% of patients experiencing their first wheezing episode. Further studies are needed to confirm the association between infection and asthma exacerbation, to determine the prevalence of such infections in patients with acute exacerbations of asthma, and to examine if infection with these organisms modifies the severity of the exacerbation or the response to therapy.",

Classic asthma and VIW were considered two different entities until 1969, when a report suggested that the two groups have similar characteristics [59] and benefited similarly from the same prophylactic treatment [60] . In the 1990s, there was a division of the wheezing phenotypes, especially in children [58] . Patients with VIW alone seem to outgrow the symptoms by age 6; however, in some patients, the pattern of VIW may continue into adulthood with less severe symptoms, negative methacholine challenges, and pulmonary functions that remain normal [61] .

However, this finding was not confirmed in a study that followed cohabitating couples consisting of an atopic asthmatic and a healthy nonatopic, nonasthmatic individual [23] . In this study, subjects completed daily diary cards of upper and lower respiratory tract symptoms and measured PEF twice daily. Nasal aspirates were taken and examined for rhinovirus every 2 weeks. Rhinovirus was detected in 10.1% of samples from the asthmatics and 8.5% of samples from the nonasthmatic participants. After adjustment for confounding factors, asthma did not significantly increase the risk of infection with rhinovirus in asthmatic individuals (OR 1.15).",

An inverse relationship between infection and allergy was first noted when a study comparing white families with Native Americans reported that IgE levels and the prevalences of asthma and eczema were higher in the white population, whereas helminthic, viral, and bacterial infections were more prevalent in the Native Americans [1] . It was observed that increased family size, often associated with more frequent infections in early childhood, had an inverse relationship with the prevalence of allergic rhinitis [2] and asthma [73] . This was further supported by studies reporting an inverse relationship between the age of day care entry and the diagnosis of asthma [74, 75] . One potential explanation for this pattern is that at birth there is a predominant TH2 response, and, as exposure to infections occurs, there is a gradual shift toward a TH1dominant response. However, if the skewing of the immune response to TH1, which regulates response to viral infection, is impaired, a TH2 response would infectious triggers of asthma predominate, favoring the development of allergy. Ex vivo studies have shown that asthmatics exposed to viral infections lack the capacity to mount a strong TH1 response [76, 77] .",

The neuraminidase inhibitors, zanamivir and oseltamivir, have an advantage over adamantanes, amantadine, and rimantadine because they have a broader spectrum and are effective against the A and B strains of influenza virus. The inhibition of neuraminidase, whose active site consists of 11 amino acids conserved in all naturally occurring influenza virus [83] , prevent cleavage of sialic acid from newly acquired membrane, leaving emerging virus inactive and thereby decreasing infectivity [84] . Both neuraminidase inhibitors improve respiratory outcomes in patients with asthma and acute influenza infections [78] and have the added benefit of being effective in the prophylaxis against influenza infections [85] . Although it is generally well tolerated, there are case reports of bronchospasm after treatment with inhaled zanamivir [86] ; however, it is difficult to separate these symptoms from the effects of the influenza infection. The disadvantage of current antiviral therapy is the specificity for influenza and the need for initiation of treatment within 48 hours of onset of infection.

Because most acute exacerbations of asthma are induced by viral infections and because many forms of asthma therapy, especially inhaled corticosteroids, reduce the frequency and severity of exacerbations, one would presume that the current treatment for chronic asthma would be efficacious in preventing VIW. However, the varying phenotypes of wheezing, especially in childhood, seem to respond differently to such management approaches. This is particularly true for RSV-associated wheezing, which does not consistently respond to medications often used to treat asthma exacerbations, including bronchodilators and corticosteroids [97] . Thus, despite the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids in the control of asthma and reduction of exacerbations, patients continue to experience exacerbations, particularly in the setting of viral RTIs.",

Brunette et al [98] examined the effect of a short course of oral corticosteroid administered in an unblinded manner at onset of URI symptoms in a group of children with histories of recurrent wheezing in the setting of viral infections. Over a 1-year period, the group receiving oral corticosteroids at the early signs of RTIs experienced reductions in the frequencies of wheezing, emergency room visits, and hospitalizations. However, a recent double-blind, placebo-controlled trial evaluating the use of parent-initiated oral corticosteroids at the early signs of an episode of presumed viral-induced wheezing did not detect a difference between oral corticosteroid therapy and placebo in terms of symptom scores and rate of hospitalization [99] . Thus, the role for the use of oral corticosteroids at the early signs of illness in children with recurrent viral wheezing is unclear, and additional investigation is required to determine the efficacy of this approach in the management and attenuation of wheezing episodes.",

Given the efficacy of inhaled corticosteroids (ICS) in the daily management of asthma and their favorable safety profile when compared with systemic corticosteroids, the use of ICS in the management of VIW has been explored. Although ICS are effective in the management of persistent asthma, current evidence suggests a lack of efficacy in the regular use of ICS in patients with mild VIW [100, 101] . A recent meta-analysis concluded that the use of ICS episodically for viral-triggered wheezing in children not using them as maintenance may decrease the rate of oral corticosteroid requirement [101] . In patients receiving daily ICS therapy, the common clinical practice of doubling the dose of ICS at the onset of an asthma exacerbation has been shown to be ineffective in preventing symptom progression [102] . However, a recent study in adults demonstrated the valuable effects of quadrupling the ICS dose with acute asthma exacerbations [103] . These data suggest that corticosteroids, taken orally or inhaled, may be used as treatment and preventive therapy for asthma exacerbations in the setting of RTIs.",

CysLTs are detectable in the blood, urine, nasal secretions, sputum, and BALF of patients with chronic asthma. Elevated cysLTs have been detected in respiratory secretion of children with viral induced wheezing [104] . Similar to elevated levels in asthmatics, 20 infants with prolonged or persistent wheeze (mean 14.9 months) and a history of viral illness at wheeze onset had significant elevations of leukotrienes in BAL despite the fact that 12 of 20 infants were receiving daily ICS therapy ( 450 mg/d) [105] . These findings suggest that, similar to asthma pathophysiology, cysLTs play a role in the pathophysiology of viral-induced wheeze. Additionally, based on the above study, the cysLTs are not fully suppressed by the preferred standard antiinflammatory therapy, inhaled corticosteroids. Thus, antagonism of the effects of cysLT using the leukotriene receptor antagonists may provide clinical benefit to patients with VIW.",
