The aim of this study was to evaluate the cytotoxicity of Isatis indigotica extracts on human leukemia cell line (HL-60) and the antiviral activity on swine pseudorabies virus (PrV) in in vitro assays. Materials and methods: Extracts and derived fractions of Isatis indigotica were prepared from root (R) and leaf (L) using methanol (M), ethyl acetate (E) and distilled water (D). The cytotoxic effect of extracts on swine peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) and HL-60 was assessed by MTT method. The cytopathic effect (CPE) reduction, plaque reduction and inhibition assays on viral replication, and virucidal activity were further conducted to investigate the anti-PrV activity. Results: Indirubin, one of the biological active compounds of Isatis indigotica, had the most significant cytotoxicity on HL-60 cells and inhibitory effect on PrV replication. Extracts from roots and leaves of Isatis indigotica also presented CPE inhibition either before or after infection of PrV on porcine kidney (PK-15) cells. Leaf extracts had better virucidal activity than roots, and ethyl acetate extracts exhibited the highest efficacy among extracts tested. Conclusion: Isatis indigotica posses a valuable virucidal effect in disease control of pseudorabies virus infection in swine.",

The biological activity of indigotin and indirubin has been reported, which are used as the markers for quality control due to their unique pharmaceutical activities (Zou et al., 2005; Liau et al., 2007) . The Isatis indigotica root and phenolic Chinese herbs were frequently used for the prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) during the SARS outbreaks in China, Hong Kong, and Taiwan in 2003 (Lin et al., 2005) . Recently, cleavage assays with the 3C-like protease demonstrated that IC 50 values were in micromolar ranges for Isatis indigotica root extract, indigo, sinigrin, aloe emodin and hesperetin . It has also been shown that Isatis indigotica root could promote both humoral and cellular immune responses and would be one of the valuable candidates as a newtype of immunopotentiator on peripheral lymphocyte proliferation and serum antibody titer in chicken vaccinated with Newcastle disease vaccine (Kong et al., 2004) . Furthermore, co-injection of the Isatis indigotica root extract with food and mouth disease DNA vaccine has adjuvant effect on the immune response against viral pathogens in swine (Chen et al., 2005) .",

The crude RM and LM were further fractionated with ethyl acetate (E) to obtain the soluble and insoluble parts and then concentrated by rotary evaporator at 40 \u2022 C. The soluble and insoluble parts of the crude RM were coded as RE (8 g) and RD (6.5 g). The soluble and insoluble parts of the crude LM were coded as LE (2.1 g) and LD (3.2 g). These extracts were diluted with DMSO to be 100 mg/ml and filtrated by 0.22 m filter, then stored at \u221220 \u2022 C before use. Indirubin ( Fig. 1) was isolated from the leave extract of Isatis indigotica in our laboratory, and its purity and structure were confirmed by HPLC, and ESI-mass spectrometry as our previous report (Liau et al., 2007) .",

Although the RM, RD and LD groups revealed no cytotoxic effect on HL-60 cells, LE, RE and LM extracts displayed a dose-dependent cytotoxicity. Indirubin had the most significant cytotoxicity on HL-60 cells as compared to the ethyl acetate and methanol extracts. The anti-leukemia effect of Isatis indigotica extracts prepared from ethyl acetate was stronger than that of methanol. These results are comparable to the previous report showing that indirubin and some of Isatis indigotica extracts posed as reliable anti-leukemia medicine (Hoessel et al., 1999) without toxic to the normal swine PBMCs in this study.",

One of the components in Isatis indigotica, indirubin has been shown to inhibit RANTES expression in influenza virusinfected human bronchial epithelial cells via the intervention of virus-induced p38 MAP kinase activation and NF-B translocation (Mak et al., 2004) . In this study, the antiviral activities of indirubin were assessed by four methods of cytopathic effect, plaque reduction, viral replication and virucidal activity of PrV on PK-15 cells. It was found that indirubin inhibited CPE formation and viru-cidal activity in a dose related manner. The IC 50 of indirubin in CPE formation and virucidal activity assay were 35 and 100 g/ml, respectively; however, less effective in inhibiting of plaque formation and viral replication.",

In comparison of the effects of CPE formation and viral replication, less effect of CPE formation than that of viral replication on LE-treated group might be due to less PrV inoculation (50 TCID 50 /well vs. 100 pfu/well) or the longer incubation time (72 h vs. 1.5 h) of PrV on viral replication assay.",

Some low polarity components were not found in the chromatogram of the aqueous extract. For this, the virucidal effect of LM and LE extracts might be better than that of water extracts of Isatis indigotica and indirubin. In our recent study, there was an 85% decrease for indigo content, which is perhaps due to the isomerization of indigo to indirubin during drying (Liau et al., 2007) . In contrast, more indirubin was found and increased fourfolds in the dried leaves than in the fresh leaves. The findings from our research indicated that the amounts of the three components of tryptanthrin, indigo and indirubin in the roots Banlangen are much smaller than those in the leaves Daqingye (Liau et al., 2007) .",
