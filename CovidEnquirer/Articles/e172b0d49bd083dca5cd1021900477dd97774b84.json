In such a circumstance, if infection induces immunity in individuals -which seems to be the case for coronavirus infections in humans, such as for SARS and MERS (4-7) and likely also COVID-19 (8) -the best option is to apply interventions in a targeted manner. The goal is to slow down the spread of the disease such that new infections accrue slowly and do not overly strain the health care system, while allowing the number of susceptibles to drop until population (herd) immunity is achieved. The interventions can be slowly relaxed once susceptibles are close to the population immunity threshold, without risking a resurgent epidemic. The goal is to prevent any excess infections that would deplete susceptibles beyond the population level threshold, i.e., one wants to minimize the overshoot that typically occurs after an epidemic peak (9) . We discussed previously how to minimize the attack rate for a single population (9) and later extended it to multiple populations (10, 11 ).",

For a scenario such as the current COVID-19 outbreak, there is unfortunately significant morbidity and mortality, and it is heterogeneously distributed between age groups (12) . Evidence so far suggests that children suffer very little morbidity and mortality, while elderly are much more likely to have adverse outcomes. If an intervention mainly protects specific groups in a population, infections required to achieve population immunity will happen disproportionately in the other groups. For COVID-19, this suggests that if the goal is to reduce overall mortality, we should implement interventions that preferentially protect elderly, while allowing the minimum number of infections required to reach population immunity to occur in the least vulnerable groups.",

Of course, it is worth emphasizing that there is still large uncertainty about the combined impact of our available interventions on the spread of COVID-19. The speed with which COVID-19 initially overwhelmed health systems in many countries, as well as the ability of several countries, to drive cases down successfully, suggests that the current best approach is to implement all feasible interventions against COVID-19. As the situation is monitored, it will become clear if we can accomplish containment. If this is unlikely, and we are in a situation where interventions cannot be sustained long enough to prevent a resurgent epidemic, some interventions should be relaxed. Mitigation should then focus on allowing 'controlled spread' toward herd immunity in such a way that the most vulnerable populations are protected most. This .

It is however important to point out that school closures have secondary effects on contact patterns, e.g. requiring adults to stay home and thus changing their infection risk, or having grandparents care for their grand-children so that the parents can go to work. Thus, the exact implications of school closure in redistributing the risk of COVID-19 morbidity and mortality among community members of different age groups remain uncertain. It is important to analyze the impact of different interventions using detailed models and empirical epidemiological studies, so that decision-makers can be adequately informed as they balance the need to slow transmission and to reduce mortality in the community.",
