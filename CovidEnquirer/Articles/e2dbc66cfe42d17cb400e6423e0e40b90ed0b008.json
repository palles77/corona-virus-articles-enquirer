These losses center on the ability of darkling beetles to transmit (vector) poultry pathogens including bacteria (e.g., Salmonella, Escherichia coli), fungi (Aspergillus), and viruses such as infectious bursal disease virus (birnavirus), fowl poxvirus, Newcastle disease virus (paramyxovirus), PATHOGENS AMONG DARKLING BEETLES and avian leukosis virus (herpesvirus). In addition, excessive beetle populations can adversely affect feed conversion ratios and chick body weight gains and can cause damage to poultry house insulation. Furthermore, excessive dry litter conditions created, at least in part, by the use of nipple-type drinkers has resulted in nocturnal darkling beetle attacks on live chickens as the beetles seek any and all sources of water [5] . As a consequence, beetle bites of the skin around feather follicles may cause lesions that resemble skin leukosis. Lastly, when beetle-infested litter is spread on pastures, large populations of adult beetles may reach near-by residences. Complaints and health concerns are passed from the homeowner to local health officials [A.",

Follow-up studies are warranted, perhaps to calculate the impact of beetle homogenate on production performance parameters and financial cost/loss estimates. One practical implication of our findings is that poultry producers should seriously consider incorporating darkling beetle abatement programs into their disease control programs. 3. These pathogens include immunosuppressive viruses (birnavirus, the agent of infectious bursal disease) and bacteria such as Salmonella. 4. There is substantial risk posed by beetles with respect to dissemination of diseases. The poultry industry should consider the implications of this risk seriously. 5. The threat of severe adverse economic impact from beetle-vectored diseases should not be overlooked or casually dismissed. 6. Darkling beetle abatement programs should be incorporated into disease control programs and should eliminate beetle-vectored pathogens, thus decreasing poultry production costs and increasing poultry production profits.",
