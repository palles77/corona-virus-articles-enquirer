The different models provide upper and lower bounds of our scenario predictions. Results: We quantitatively document four phases of the outbreak in China with a detailed analysis on the heterogenous situations across provinces. Based on Chinese experience, we identify a high risk in Japan with estimated total confirmed cases as of March 25 being 1574 (95% CI: [880, 2372]), and 5669 (95% CI: [988, 11340]) by June. For South Korea, we expect the number of infected cases to approach the ceiling, 7928 (95% CI: [6341, 9754]), in 20 days. We estimate 0.15% (95% CI: [0.03%, 0.30%]) of Italian population to be infected in a positive scenario. We would expect 114867 people infected in Europe in 10 days, in a negative but probable scenario, corresponding to 0.015% European population.",

In this paper, we focus on using phenomenological models without detailed microscopic foundations, but which have the advantage of allowing simple calibrations to the empirical reported data and providing transparent interpretations.

All these models have some limitations and are only applicable in some stages of the outbreak, or when enough data points are available. Thus, we first calibrate different models to the reported number of infected cases in the COVID-19 epidemics from Jan. 19 to March 10 for the whole of China and 29 provinces in mainland China, and then draw some lessons useful to interpret the results of a similar modeling exercise performed on the four countries that are undergoing major outbreaks of this virus: Japan, South Korea, Iran, and Italy. Our analysis dissects the development of the epidemics in China and the impact of the drastic control measures both at the aggregate level and within each province. Borrowing from the experience of China, we made projections on the development of the outbreak in the four key countries and the whole Europe, based on different scenarios provided by the results from different models. Our study employs simple models to quantitatively document the effects of the Chinese containment measures against the COVID-19, and provide informative implications for the coming pandemic.",

The dispersion among these 500 scenarios provides a measure of stability of the fits and their range of values gives an estimation of the confidence intervals. The first conclusion is the non-surprising large range of scenarios obtained when using data before the maximum, which however encompass the realized data. We observe a tendency for early scenarios to predict a much faster and larger number of new cases than observed, which could be expected in the absence of strong containment control. With more data, the scenarios become more accurate, especially when using realized data after the peak, and probably account now well for the impact of the containment measures that modified the dynamics of the epidemic spreading.",

A possible scenario is that the growth rate may continue to float and fluctuate around the current rate for a while, for which the generalized growth model becomes relevant and can be used for extrapolation. In this scenario, the total number of cases would grow to 14994 (95% CI: [10432, 21048]) in 5 days (Mar-15), and to 23025 (95% CI: [15246, 42249]) in 10 days (Mar-20). On the other hand, a more positive scenario could be the one proposed by the logistic model, which provides an estimate of the total number of infected cases of 10719 (95% CI: [8178, 14390]) in 10 days (Mar-20), and a final number of 10804 cases (95% CI: [8202, 15060]) in 20 days. The results obtained from the generalized logistic model are similar to those of the logistic model, with a smaller variance. The belated response, lack of resources, and opaque information communication in Iran lead to large uncertainties regarding the future development of the epidemic in this country.",

Moreover, as Italy is a highly connected node in the global network, it poses significant risks to other countries. As of March 2, 30 countries and territories have confirmed cases which appear to have originated from Italy [27]. On Mar 8, the government of Italy imposed a quarantine on the region of Lombardy and fourteen neighboring provinces in Piedmont, Veneto, Emilia-Romagna, and Marche, in response to the growing outbreak of COVID-19 in the country, putting more than a quarter of the national population (ca. 16 million people) under lockdown. On March 10, Italy has extended its emergency coronavirus measures, which include travel restrictions and a ban on public gatherings, to the entire country. This will certainly help to reduce the transmission of the virus. However, given the experience in China, the effect will only be reflected in the statistics after a delay of at least one week, and it would be already a positive outcome if the outbreak would follow the path described the generalized logistic model.",

Given that the generalized logistic model provides the best scenario for Italy with a prediction of a total cumulative number of infected cases of 91719 (95% CI: [16944, 183440]) until the end of the outbreak, it seems that the total number of infected cases for Europe will err towards the upper bound (~330000) of the 95% confidence interval. Moreover, the reliability of this forecast for Europe can be questioned given the strong heterogeneities between European countries.
