We have studied the association of the viral membrane glycoproteins M and S in the formation of the virion envelope. Using coimmunoprecipitation analysis we demonstrated that the M and S proteins of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) interact specifically forming heteromultimeric complexes in infected cells. These could be detected only when the detergents used for their solubilization from cells or virions were carefully chosen: a combination of nonionic (NP-40) and ionic (deoxycholic acid) detergents proved to be optimal. Pulse-chase experiments revealed that newly made M and S proteins engaged in complex formation with different kinetics. Whereas the M protein appeared in complexes immediately after its synthesis, newly synthesized S protein did so only after a lag phase of >20 min. Newly made M was incorporated into virus particles faster than S, which suggests that it associates with preexisting S molecules. Using the vaccinia virus T7-driven coexpression of M and S we also demonstrate formation of M/S complexes in the absence of other coronaviral proteins. Pulse-chase labelings and coimmunoprecipitation analyses revealed that",

Since no association of M and S was detected when protein export from the ER was blocked by brefeldin A, stable complexes most likely arise in the ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment. Sucrose velocity gradient analysis showed the M/S complexes to be heterogeneous and of higher order, suggesting that they are maintained by homo-and heterotypic interactions. M/S complexes colocalized with a-mannosidase II, a resident Golgi protein. They acquired Golgi-specific oligosaccharide modifications but were not detected at the cell surface. Thus, the S protein, which on itself was transported to the plasma membrane, was retained in the Golgi complex by its association with the M protein. Because coronaviruses bud at pre-Golgi membranes, this result implies that the envelope glycoprotein complexes do not determine the site of budding. Yet, the self-association of the MHV envelope glycoproteins into higher order complexes is indicative of its role in the sorting of the viral membrane proteins and in driving the formation of the viral lipoprotein coat in virus assembly.",

            "text": "UDDING through cellular membranes is the final step in the assembly of enveloped viruses. It results in the envelopment of the viral nucleocapsid (NC) 1 by a membrane modified by the viral envelope proteins. Complex protein-protein interactions between the envelope proteins control the timing, location, and specificity of budding. The envelopment of the NC is believed to be driven by its interactions with the envelope proteins (Simons and Garoff, 1980; Dubois-Dalcq et al., 1984;  Simons (Stephens and Compans, 1988) , while others bud into intracellular compartments (Pettersson, 1991; Griffiths and Rottier, 1992) . The location of virus budding is thought to be dictated by the envelope proteins because they usually accumulate at the site of budding (Dubois-Dalcq et al., 1984; Stephens and Compans, 1988; Pettersson, 1991; Hobman, 1993) . When the Semliki Forest virus spike proteins were arrested in the Golgi complex by monensin, budding took place there rather than at the plasma membrane (Griffiths et al., 1983) . However, the accumulation of the vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) G protein in the trans-Golgi network by incubation at 20\u00b0C prevented assembly (Griffiths et al., 1985) . Thus, although a local accumulation of envelope proteins may be instrumental in budding, additional yet unidentified factors may be involved in localizing this process.",

            "text": "We studied the assembly of the mouse hepatitis coronavirus (MHV), strain A-59. MHV is a large, enveloped, positive-strand RNA virus with a simple protein composition (Spaan et al., 1988; Holmes, 1990) . The viral genome is packaged by the nucleocapsid (N) protein into an NC with helical symmetry, and this in turn is enveloped by a lipid bilayer containing the membrane (M) protein (22-25 kD) and the spike (S) protein (180 kD). A small, nonglycosylated membrane protein (E) of ~10 kD was recently identified as a minor third constituent of the viral envelope (Yu et al., 1994) . Coronaviruses are assembled at smooth membranes of the intermediate compartment (IC) (Tooze et al., 1984; Klumperman et al., 1994; Krijnse-Locker et al., 1994) . Because coronaviruses lack a matrix protein, envelopment probably involves direct interactions between the NC and one or more of the envelope proteins. The M protein is a likely candidate because of its abundancy, and because it was found to associate with the NC in vitro (Sturman et al., 1980) . Moreover, the S protein is probably dispensable for budding since spikeless virions were produced when infected cells were treated with tunicamycin (Holmes et al., 1981; Rottier et al., 1981) . The role of the E protein is presently unknown. We have shown previously that neither of the envelope glycoproteins accumulates at the site of budding when expressed independently: the M protein alone localizes to the Golgi complex (Rottier and Rose, 1987; Krijnse Locker et al., 1992a; Klumperman et al., 1994) , whereas the S protein is transported to the plasma membrane (Vennema, H., and P. J. M. Rottier, unpublished data) .",

The present study was therefore aimed at detecting and characterizing such interactions in MHV-infected cells and in cells expressing M and S from their cloned genes. Using proper solubilization conditions, M/S complexes were identified by immunoprecipitation and sedimentation analysis. We investigated whether the association of M and S is the factor determining the site of budding, as it might preclude their transport beyond the budding compartment. In addition, we asked whether lateral interactions between M and S lead to the formation of large envelope glycoprotein assemblies indicative of their role in driving the formation of the viral envelope.",

The mAbetS precipitated the S protein, as expected, but in one case also the M protein, when a combination of the nonionic detergent NP-40 and the ionic detergent deoxycholic acid was used. The amount of coprecipitated M was similar to that obtained with the anti-MHV serum; virtually no N protein nor any cellular proteins was observed in the precipitate. We conclude that in infected cells a large fraction of M is physically complexed with S, and that the stability of these complexes is dependent on the detergents used for solubilization. To determine whether M and S associate in the absence of other coronaviral proteins, we used vaccinia virus TTdriven coexpression of their respective genes in OSTT-1 cells (Elroy-Stein and Moss, 1990) . The results with the anti-MHV serum show that M and S were efficiently labeled in cells coexpressing the proteins (Fig. 1 B) . When using the S-specific antibodies M was also precipitated, in addition to S, indicating that the proteins do associate independent of other coronaviral proteins. To exclude the possibility that their association had occurred after cell lysis, we performed the immunoprecipitations with a mixture of lysates from cultures in which M and S had been expressed separately. In this case M was not coprecipitated. We never observed specific coprecipitation of other labeled proteins: some bands appearing after longer exposures were also detected in analyses of cells expressing M or S alone. Note that the rabbit anti-MHV serum precipitates some non-MHV proteins from expressing cells, not from MHV-infected cells. The identity of these proteins is unclear, but they are likely to be derived from vaccinia virus.",

In contrast, when expressed by itself, S had a faint reticular appearance (Fig. 4 D) while it was also observed at the surface of nonpermeabilized cells (not shown). The intracellular localization of the M protein appeared not to be affected by S because its distribution was similar to that in cells which expressed M only (Fig. 4 C) . The suggestion that M and S coaccumulated in the Golgi complex was confirmed by visualizing this compartment using a serum against man II, a resident Golgi protein (Moremen et al., 1991) . The localization of man II clearly overlapped with that of the S protein (Fig. 4 , E and F). The conclusion that M had retained S in the Golgi region is consistent with the observation that M/S complexes predominantly contained mature forms of M (Fig. 1 B) .",

The precipitates obtained using the mAb~M were split to perform an endoglycosidase H sensitivity assay. The time courses with which newly synthesized M and S engage in heterocomplexes in the absence of other viral components appeared to be similar to those observed in MHV-infected cells (Fig. 2) . After the pulse, a small frac-tion of M was coprecipitated by the mAbotS (Fig. 5 A) ; its amount increased during the chase and reached a maximum between 30 and 60 min of chase. In contrast, coprecipitation of labeled S appeared only after 15 min of chase and reached its highest level ~75 min later (Fig. 5 B) . The M protein already associated with S while still in its unglycosylated form (Fig. 5 A) indicating that the complexes are formed in a pre-Golgi compartment. Consistently, the S precursor gpl50, coprecipitated by the M-specific antibodies ( Fig. 5 B) , appeared to be completely endoglycosidase H-sensitive, which means that it had not yet passed the medial-Golgi. The finding that M/S complexes eventually consisted of Golgi-modified forms both of M and of S confirms their transport to the Golgi complex. Surprisingly, the pulse-chase assay did not reveal any transient accumulation of the unglycosylated precursor form M0 nor of M1. Apparently, the accumulation of M/S complexes in the IC, which supposedly occurs in MHV-infected cells, does not occur when the proteins are coexpressed. Instead, M/S complexes are transported efficiently beyond the budding site to the Golgi complex in the absence of other coronaviral proteins.",

Folding of S occurs slowly and involves the formation of intramolecular disulfide bonds (Opstelten et al., 1993) , the addition and processing of N-linked sugars, and the assembly into homo-oligomers (Vennema et al., 1990a) . In contrast, the M protein acquires its final conformation in the ER rapidly, without being glycosylated, without the formation of disulfide bonds (Opstelten et al., 1993) , and even without the need for ATP . Thus folding of S is probably rate limiting in its association with M. Newly made M interacts with preexisting folded S, as evidenced by the presence of unlabeled S in complexes after short labelings. Only completely oxidized S molecules associate with M, and S is unable to interact when its folding has been inhibited by in vivo reduction with DTT (Opstelten et al., 1993; our unpublished results) . A similar situation has been observed for bunyaviruses: heterodimerization of Uukuniemi virus glycoproteins occurs between newly made G1 and presynthesized G2 due to the slow maturation of the latter (Persson and Pettersson, 1991) .",

First, M/S complexes are rapidly formed, much of M was associated with S after a 10min pulse. Second, the presence of unglycosylated M in the complexes indicates its association before addition of the first sugar (N-acetyl-galactosamine). Third, treatment of infected cells with BFA, a drug that prevents exit of proteins from the ER, did not inhibit the formation of M/S complexes. Although these data suggest that the interaction between M and S precedes budding, we cannot exclude that association occurs synchronously with assembly. The association of coexpressed M and S also occurs in an early compartment since newly synthesized, unmodified M molecules appear in M/S complexes rapidly. However, the failure to detect the interactions in the presence of BFA suggests that stable complexes are formed only after the proteins have left the ER, i.e., in the IC. This suggests that other factors are involved in the early formation and/or stabilization of M/S complexes in infected cells. One such factor might be the NC. Its binding to the envelope glycoprotein complexes might promote and stabilize the inter-actions between M and S and create nucleation sites for conglomeration of the complexes. Alternatively, the difference might be just the result of a concentration effect since multimerization reactions are dependent on the con- centrations of the reacting molecules (Braakman et al., 1991) . Thus, under our coexpression conditions, stable association of M and S might not have occurred in the E R because the proteins did not accumulate to sufficient lev-els. Membrane glycoproteins are indeed concentrated during their export from the ER (Copeland et al., 1988; Balch et al., 1994) , and this might induce the formation of stable M/S complexes. In the course of an MHV infection, the synthesis of the envelope proteins reaches much higher levels than during expression. Thus, the association of M and S in infected cells might take place in the IC initially and in the ER at later stages of infection, coinciding with the temporal pattern of virus budding.",

Their accumulation in the Golgi complex, however, indicates that (an)other viral factor(s) determines the site of budding.

Because the cell-surface expression of the VSV-G protein was not affected by M, we conclude that M specifically retains the S protein. Similarly, the G2 protein of Punta Toro virus is transported to the cell surface when expressed by itself, but accumulates in the Golgi complex after heterodimerization with G1 that contains the signal for Golgi retention (Chen et al., 1991; Matsuoka et al., 1994) . Cosorting by association is a well-known principle of protein targeting and retention in eukaryotic cells. Recently, Nilsson et al. (1993 Nilsson et al. ( , 1994 proposed kin recognition as a mechanism for sorting and retention of Golgi enzymes. Accordingly, sorting of the enzymes is based on specific interactions between kin-oligomers, while retention is achieved by their involvement in complexes too bulky to enter transport vescicles. The self-association of M and S has similar features: the proteins interact specifically, segregate from other proteins, and are subsequently targeted to and retained in the Golgi complex. However, the association of M and S into large complexes in pre-Golgi membranes apparently does not inhibit their further transport to the Golgi complex.",

S is dispensable for particle assembly since spikeless virions are released from infected cells treated with tunicamycin (Holmes et al., 1981; Rottier et al., 1981) . Moreover, recent data from our laboratory show that the assembly of coronavirus-like particles also occurs independently of the S protein (Vennema, H., G.-J. Godeke, and P. J. M. Rottier, unpublished data) which implies that envelope formation does not depend on M-S interactions. We therefore assume that the higher-order M/S complexes are maintained primarily, if not only, by M-M interactions. This is supported by our recent findings that M associates into large complexes when expressed by itself (Krijnse Locker et al., 1995) .",

            "text": "Extensive envelope protein interactions have important functions in coronavirus assembly. First, they are responsible for host protein exclusion. Second, local membrane domains harboring these large envelope protein assemblies serve as the sites for budding. Third, the clustering of envelope proteins may alter the fluidity of the lipid bilayer, for instance to facilitate the induction of curvature (Dubois-Dalcq et al., 1984; Simons and Fuller, 1987) . This factor could promote budding. Finally, the envelope protein clusters might serve as a template for the condensation of the NC. The NC of coronaviruses are long, loosely coiled strands in the cytoplasm of infected cells that condensate at the membranes of the budding compartment; other viruses having a helical NC, e.g., VSV, encode a matrix protein that controls the coiling of the NC (Newcomb et al., 1982) . The emerging picture of coronavirus budding shows extensive local rafts (patches) of laterally interacting M molecules in pre-Golgi membranes. Only few copies of the E protein and variable numbers of S molecules are encountered in these structures. NCs bind to the cytoplasmically exposed domains of the M proteins, surround themselves with the modified membrane, and pinch off into the lumen. The rafts are continuously being replenished by the arrival and incorporation of newly synthesized viral envelope proteins. Further work should show whether this model is correct and establish the interactions that compound it.",
