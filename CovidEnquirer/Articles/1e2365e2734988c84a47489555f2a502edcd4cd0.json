Peptidases are important in pathological conditions such as Alzheimer's disease, tumour and parasite invasion, and for processing viral polyproteins. The MEROPS database is an Internet resource containing information on peptidases, their substrates and inhibitors. The database now includes details of cleavage positions in substrates, both physiological and non-physiological, natural and synthetic. There are 39 118 cleavages in the collection; including 34 606 from a total of 10 513 different proteins and 2677 cleavages in synthetic substrates. The number of cleavages designated as 'physiological' is 13 307. The data are derived from 6095 publications. At least one substrate cleavage is known for 45% of the 2415 different peptidases recognized in the MEROPS database. The website now has three new displays: two showing peptidase specificity as a logo and a frequency matrix, the third showing a dynamically generated alignment between each protein substrate and its most closely related homologues. Many of the proteins described in the literature as peptidase substrates have been studied only in vitro. On the assumption that a physiologically relevant cleavage site would be conserved between species, the conservation of every site in terms of peptidase preference has been examined and a number have been identified that are not conserved. There are a number of cogent reasons why a site might not be conserved. Each poorly conserved site has been examined and a reason postulated. Some sites are identified that are very poorly conserved where cleavage is more likely to be fortuitous than of physiological relevance. This data-set is freely available via the Internet and is a useful training set for algorithms to predict substrates for peptidases and cleavage positions within those substrates. The data may also be useful for the design of inhibitors and for engineering novel specificities into peptidases.",

One of the most popular substrates has been the oxidized insulin B-chain, because this is a peptide without tertiary structure, and cleavage depends solely on the preference of the peptidase (13) . (The terms 'specificity', 'selectivity' and 'preference' are used interchangeably here.) However, peptidase preference is exactly that: a preference only. Researchers often find that after prolonged exposure to a peptidase other bonds are degraded, albeit slowly, once none of the preferred bonds remain. If the peptidase preparation is not pure, then there is the danger that some of the observed cleavages are due to contaminating peptidases.",

Where cleavage does occur in a protein is due to a combination of the preference of the peptidase and the availability of bonds in the substrate. Although the preference of the peptidase can be quite simple, for example trypsin (MEROPS identifier S01.151) cleaves lysyl and arginyl bonds (15) and caspase-3 (C14.003) cleaves only aspartyl bonds (16) , very often peptidase preference is cryptic. It is relatively easy to predict trypsin cleavages in a denatured protein, but few lysyl and arginyl bonds will be cleaved in a native protein. This has proved useful for researchers wishing to separate structural domains in a multidomain protein using limited proteolysis (17) . It is not possible to predict where in a peptide cathepsin B (C01.060) will cleave, for example, despite its known preferences for a hydrophobic residue in the S2 pocket and arginine in S1 (18) .",

Given that nearly all proteins are eventually degraded, and that any one protein can be degraded by several different peptidases often by cleavages at multiple peptide bonds, the potential total number of cleavages will always exceed the number of known proteins. Up until recently each cleavage had to be characterized biochemically, which meant N-terminal sequencing of the products, a timeconsuming and labour-intensive task. Now that proteomic analyses are possible, where cell lysates or similar samples are subjected to cleavage by a peptidase, peptides isolated, composition determined by mass spectroscopy, and possible source protein(s) determined from the composition (19) , the amount of data is set to rise exponentially. This makes it vitally important that the information be accurately stored and curated.

The collection of known cleavages in substrates which was started in 1998 (22) has now been added to the MEROPS database. For each peptidase there is a page listing known substrates, and, where enough substrates are known, the peptidase summary has displays to show peptidase specificity. For each protein substrate, the sequence is displayed showing where cleavage occurs and which peptidase performs that cleavage.

The data are derived from 6095 publications. The number of cleavages in common between the MEROPS and CutDB collections is 5876, of which 3424 were originally found in the literature by the CutDB researchers. The number of cleavages from the CutDB database that failed to make the MEROPS collection, excluding 892 isoforms and 35 duplicates, was 560 (9.5%), mostly due to being mapped to the wrong residue or sequence. The CutDB curators have been informed of these discrepancies. Because the CutDB database includes only cleavages thought to be of physiological relevance and those that can be included in their proteolytic pathways, it has fewer cleavages than in the MEROPS collection.

Some omega peptidases (peptidases which do not cleave normal peptide bonds but release substituted amino acids such as pyroglutamate or cleave isopeptide bonds, such as many deubiquitinating enzymes) may also be unable to accept any residue in certain positions, or it is not possible to interpret cleavages in terms of P4-P4 0 , for example for isopeptidases. There are 36 peptidases with 10 or more cleavages that cannot accept any residue in S4, 35 for S3, 26 for S2, 15 for S2 0 , 22 for S3 0 and 25 for S4 0 .

The commonest preferences are for a basic amino acid in the P1 position, small amino acids in P1 and P1 0 , and an aliphatic amino acid in P1 0 . No aromatic amino acids were observed in P4 0 in any of the substrates of these 312 peptidases. For each amino acid category preference was most pronounced in the S1 pocket with the exception of aliphatic amino acids, where most peptidases have a preference in the S1 0 pocket.

Asparagine is also very rare in the proximity of a cleavage site, one of the few examples being the specialist peptidase legumain (C13.006) which only cleaves asparaginyl bonds (33) .

(2) UniRef50 entries contain many translated genes from genome sequencing projects; gene finding in eukaryote genomes is notoriously difficult and it is possible that erroneous gene building has resulted, for example, in the loss of the exon encoding the cleavage site or the inclusion of part of an intron in its place. (3) It is also probable that for some peptidases there are not enough substrates known to be sure that any amino acid is really excluded from a particular binding site. The number of substrates known for each peptidase is included in Table 4 , because the greater the number of substrates the more likely that an amino acid is really atypical and not just unobserved. (4) The alignment is incorrect. This is unlikely given the close relationship between the sequences, which are all 50% or more identical; however there are situations where an insert or deletion occurs within the range P4-P4 0 . (5) Some endogenous cleavages (for example removal of signal and transit peptides) may be the result of more than one cleavage, because aminopeptidases nibble away the N-terminus (1), and may thus be incorrectly mapped to the specificity of the leader peptidase. (6) It is theoretically possible that if the substrate and peptidase are from the same organism both will have evolved to accommodate a change in the cleavage position. (7) A single residue mismatch may also be due to a single-base sequencing error. Potential errors of this kind can be identified using a codon dictionary, provided the atypical residue could be the result of a single base change, and that it is the only residue not conserved, regardless of the number of sequences in the alignment. (8) Some cleavages regarded as 'physiological' are actually fortuitous. If a cleavage site is extremely poorly conserved it is unlikely to be physiologically relevant. ",

Included in category d, where insertions and or deletions occur in the homologous cleavage sites, is 50S ribosomal protein L7Ae (UniProt accession P12743). There are N-terminal extensions to most homologues so that the known methionyl aminopeptidase 2-cleavage site is not aligned. Five of these sequences may be derived from erroneous gene builds (point b). The UniRef50 database entry for 60S ribosomal protein L10 (P27635) includes a wide range of species (the cleavage is known in the human protein) and the peptidase performing the cleavage (granzyme B) is not present in Paracoccidiodes brasiliensis, where the substrate cleavage is also not conserved. The replacements that are reported as atypical in hemoglobin subunit alpha (P69905) by Schistosoma cathepsin D (A01.009) (34) are the rarest naturally occurring amino acids, tryptophan and cysteine, and despite there being 109 known cleavages for this peptidase, this may still not be enough to properly exclude these rare amino acids. On the other hand, this is the cleavage of a host protein by a parasite peptidase and the specificity may have adapted to limit the availability of hosts.",

For example, despite there being few cleavages for cathepsin H, the reported cleavages in the BID protein (36) are in particularly poorly conserved regions (see Figure 3 ). Cleavage of the BID protein leads to the induction of apoptosis. That the cleavage sites are not well conserved amongst mammalian orthologues is not surprising given that the cytoplasmic substrate and the lysosomal peptidase should not meet under normal circumstances. The mouse protein in which the cleavage was identified may therefore be unusually susceptible to cleavage should the lysosomal membrane be ruptured.",

Displays in the database give insights into peptidase specificity and to the conservation of cleavage sites amongst orthologous proteins. The data provide a substantial training set for algorithms to predict peptidase substrates and cleavage positions in those substrates. The data may also be useful for the design of inhibitors and engineering novel specificities into peptidases. By examining the conservation of cleavage sites in protein substrates in terms of peptidase substrate binding sites, it is clear that there are a number of cleavages where atypical replacements occur. Many of these can be explained by gene build or sequencing errors, inserts or deletions in the region around the cleavage site, or the alignments contain one or more paralogues in which cleavage may be absent or different. In a few cases it is possible that more than one peptidase is involved in processing, or there may not be enough known substrates for some peptidases to be sure that an atypical replacement is really unacceptable. A number of substrate cleavages that may be fortuitous and not of any physiological relevance have been identified.",
