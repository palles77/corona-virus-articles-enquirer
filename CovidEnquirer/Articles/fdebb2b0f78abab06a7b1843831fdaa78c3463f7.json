Methods: Air samples were collected indoors and outdoors during polluted and non-polluted weather using sixstage Andersen Samplers. For each isolated bacterium, the 16S ribosomal RNA gene was amplified, sequenced, and blasted against the National Center for Biotechnology Information database Antibiotic resistance was conducted by antimicrobial susceptibility testing. Results: Bacterial concentration in polluted weather was significantly higher than in non-polluted weather, both indoors and outdoors (P < 0.05). Gram-positive bacteria (GPB) were dominant in both weathers but gramnegative bacteria (GNB) were more abundant in polluted weather than non-polluted weather both indoors and outdoors. Multidrug-resistant (MDR) bacteria occupied 23.7% of all bacterial isolates, 22.4% of isolates from polluted weather and 27.8% of isolates from non-polluted weather. Penicillins were resisted by 72.4% and 83.3% of isolates from polluted and non-polluted weather, respectively. Conclusions: The bacterial concentration was significantly higher in polluted weather, compared to non-polluted weather. Polluted weather is correlated with changes in the bacterial composition in the air, with a greater abundance of GNB. Penicillins was resisted by over 70% of bacterial isolates. The abundance of MDR bacteria suggested potential risks for human health.",

In China, 92 ,700 tons of 36 frequently detected antibiotics were used, according to Zhang's investigation, and 53,800 tons of which eventually entered the environment (Zhang et al., 2015) . The development of antibiotic resistance among bacteria has been facilitated by the misuse and abuse of antibiotics in humans and animals. Moreover, antibiotic resistance can be transferred between bacteria in environment (Allen et al., 2010; Hiltunen et al., 2017; Xie et al., 2019) . Large amounts of antibiotic resistant genes were found in air samples from Beijing smog (Pal et al., 2016) , causing great public concern and panic. The existence of antibiotic resistant genes indicates the potential for resistance to be transferred between bacteria in air (Xie et al., 2019) . Antibiotic-resistant bacteria in the air, particularly pathogenic bacteria, may cause respiratory diseases of a longer duration due to their resistance to antibiotic treatment. There have been studies on ABR in food or other environments, such as soil, waste water, or hospital settings (Gao et al., 2018; Uhrbrand et al., 2017; Zhu et al., 2017) . However, few studies have evaluated the changes in the percentage of antibioticresistant bacteria in polluted and non-polluted air.",

This could be attributed to the environmental conditions, sampling time, and bacteria's capability of adhering to PM in the ambient air. Air sampling using different sampler could bring various difference to bacterial concentration. The limitation of using Andersen Samplers is that it could damage cells during sampling process which may cause missing of a fraction of culturable bacteria. Still, it is a convenient and efficient method for air sample collection. Bacteria concentrations in indoor air were lower than in outdoor air under both weather conditions. Similar findings have been reported (Shelton et al., 2002; Emerson et al., 2017) . In addition, results suggested that in polluted weather, most bacteria collected outdoor and indoor are likely to influence the secondary bronchi and terminal bronchi, respectively, indicating that people who remain inside during polluted weather may still be at risk of bacterial infection, particularly of the lower respiratory tract. Therefore, residents should better use health protective equipment (e.g., an air purifier) if they stay at home in polluted weather. It has previously been demonstrated that microbes can become attached to ambient particles and have significant effects on climate change (Brodie et al., 2007) , increasing the risk to human health. Biological agents in both indoor and outdoor environments have been associated with reduced health, including allergies, asthma, infectious diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, and even cancer (Douwes et al., 2003; Kim et al., 2018; Yoo et al., 2017) , which may have high socio-economic impacts (Ghosh et al., 2015) .",

Actinobacteria were most abundant at the phylum level, and multiple genera within Actinobacteria were soil inhabitants (e.g., Streptomyces) (Ventura et al., 2007) , indicating that soil inhabitants may be one of the key components of the airborne bacterial community, which was also found by Cao et al. during a severe smog event (Cao et al., 2014) .

            "text": "To the best of our knowledge, this is also the first observation of the existence of culturable MDR bacteria in the ambient air in Beijing using bacterial culture methods. MDR was defined as acquired non-susceptibility to at least one agent in \u22653 antimicrobial categories (Magiorakos et al., 2012) . And \u226510 categories of antibiotics and their combinations were used to detect MDR bacteria in this study. A total of 23.7% of all tested culturable bacteria were MDR, which raises the question as to whether these bacteria could serve as reservoirs of resistant genes in the air and could pass on this resistance to more bacteria, including pathogenic species. MDR bacteria occupied 70% in GNB, compared to 17% in GPB. It is worth noticing that compare to GNB, GPB dominant much more in ambient air, which we believe may influence this difference of MDR occupation percentage to a certain extent. Still, the situation of MDR bacteria occupation in the ambient air was serious, approaching the percentage of airborne MDR bacteria that have been isolated from swine feeding operations (Chapin et al., 2005) or wastewater treatment plants (Teixeira et al., 2016) . MDR bacteria occupied approximately one forth in both polluted or non-polluted weather, which also suggest the serious situation of airborne MDR bacteria. And interestingly, the distribution of MDR bacteria is not dependent on the weather conditions. However, it should be noticed that the difference in the proportion of MDR bacteria between different groups may influenced by the Y. Mao, et al. Environment International 131 (2019) 104936 relatively small sample size of non-polluted weather and GNB. Also, some bacteria were unable to survive the entire AST process, which we believe was due to the following reasons: a) some airborne bacteria cannot be cultured in NB; b) environmental bacteria can be vulnerable during bacterial culture, purification, isolation, and the AST process; c) the bacterial suspension used during the AST process was diluted to a certain concentration according to the manufacturer's instructions, which may not be suitable for certain bacteria; and d) there were fewer original bacteria in the non-polluted weather samples than in the polluted weather samples, and fewer original GNB in the air than GPB. Nevertheless, MDR bacteria were detected in both non-polluted and polluted weather, and the actual proportion of MDR bacteria in the atmosphere would be no less than we detected in the present study. Penicillins were found being resisted by > 70% airborne culturable bacteria in both weathers in this study, followed by cephems being resisted by approximately 30% bacteria. These two classes of antibiotics were also resisted by > 85% MDR bacteria. These findings are consistent with \u03b2-lactams (including penicillins and cephems) being one of the most highly used antibiotics in China. And Li et al. have also found the \u03b2-lactams resistance gene being most abundant in air of a city in China . The main groups of antibiotics for human use in China are similar to those used in other countries (Zhang et al., 2015) ; moreover, penicillins, along with macrolides and fluoroquinolones, are the main antibiotic active ingredients sold in veterinary medicinal products in the US. People should be aware of this alarming phenomenon and reduce the unnecessary usage of antibiotics.",

            "text": "This study evaluated the airborne antibiotic-resistant bacteria patterns in different weather conditions in Beijing. Airborne AMR bacteria could be causing health problems by contributing to the conservation or expansion of the antibiotic resistance and resistant gene pool in the environment, thereby increasing the risk of resistance transfer to pathogenic microorganisms. It has been proven that resistance genes are capable of moving from animals to the environment and from the environment to the clinic (Cabello, 2006; Forsberg et al., 2012) , with the latter representing a great threat to human health. Furthermore, transmission from the clinic to the environment can also occur, causing resistance to arise in environmental microorganisms, which may cause them to emerge as pathogens that continue to transfer resistance genes to other microorganisms. The antibiotic/antibiotic resistance phenomenon and ARGs have been present in the environment since long before their discovery by humans, because microorganisms produce antibiotics to defend themselves against competing organisms. It is widely known that resistant bacteria can be selected when high concentrations of antibiotic drugs are used therapeutically, particularly when these are misused or abused. Subtherapeutic application of antibiotics can also promote the development of antibiotic resistance (Lu et al., 2005) . However, it has also been shown that even very low concentrations of antibiotics are sufficient to provide a selective advantage for resistant microorganisms (Gullberg et al., 2011) . Furthermore, the presence of heavy metals and biocides could co-select antibiotic resistance in the environment. Resistance genes from this increasing environmental reservoir can then be transferred to pathogenic bacteria (Allen et al., 2010) . While the results of this study are essential for public health, regretfully, it cannot be confirmed whether this bacterial resistance originated from the clinic or the environment. Therefore, further research is required to expand our understanding of MDR in the air around China and the world.",
