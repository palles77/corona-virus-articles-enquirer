            "text": "Cucumber leaf spot virus (CLSV) is a member of the Aureusvirus genus, family Tombusviridae. The auxiliary replicase of Tombusvirids has been found to localize to endoplasmic reticulum (ER), peroxisomes or mitochondria; however, localization of the auxiliary replicase of aureusviruses has not been determined. We have found that the auxiliary replicase of CLSV (p25) fused to GFP colocalizes with ER and that three predicted transmembrane domains (TMDs) at the N-terminus of p25 are sufficient for targeting, although the second and third TMDs play the most prominent roles. Confocal analysis of CLSV infected 16C plants shows that the ER becomes modified including the formation of punctae at connections between ER tubules and in association with the nucleus. Ultrastructural analysis shows that the cytoplasm contains numerous vesicles which are also found between the perinuclear ER and nuclear membrane. It is proposed that these vesicles correspond to modified ER used as sites for CLSV replication.",

The approximate 4.4 kb single-stranded positive sense RNA genome contains 5 open reading frames (ORFs) (Fig. 1) . ORF1 encodes an essential 25 kDa protein (p25) that shows sequence similarity with the p33 auxiliary replicase protein of tombusviruses as well as the analogous protein of other members of the Tombusviridae (Rochon et al., 2012) . Readthrough of ORF1 produces an 84 kDa protein that contains the RNA dependent RNA polymerase motifs. ORF3 encodes the 41 kDa coat protein (CP) that assembles with viral RNA to form virions with T \u00bc3 icosahedral symmetry. p27 is translated from ORF4 and has been shown to be required for cell-to-cell movement. p17, translated from ORF5, has been shown to be involved in symptom induction and is likely a suppressor of RNA silencing as it shows sequence similarity to the silencing suppressors of tombusviruses (Rochon et al., 2012) . p25 and p84 are translated directly from genomic RNA while the CP is translated from a 2.1 kb subgenomic RNA1 (sgRNA1). p27 and p17 are translated from distinct overlapping ORFs on the 0.8 kb sgRNA2 ( Fig. 1) (Miller et al., 1997; Reade et al., 2003) .",

We provide evidence that a GFP fusion of CLSV p25, the auxiliary replicase protein, colocalizes with the ER. Aggregates of p25/ GFP are also produced and may represent vesicles that are derived from the ER or aggregates of protein tethered to the ER. We have also identified 3 transmembrane domains (TMDs) at the N-terminus of p25 that are sufficient for targeting, and have found that the second and third TMDs play the most prominent roles. Consistent with these observations is our finding that CLSV infection alters ER structure including the formation of aggregates which are also associated with the nuclear ER. Ultrastructural analysis of CLSV infected plants shows that the cytoplasm contains numerous vesicles which may correspond to ER derived vesicles as deduced from the aggregates observed by confocal microscopy analysis. Similar vesicles are found in association with the nucleus. This is the first study to address the subcellular site of replication of an aureusvirus.",

The N-terminal aa is shown for each N-terminal deletion mutant, i.e., p\u0394TMD1/GFP, p\u0394TMD12/GFP and p\u0394TMD123/GFP, which lack either the N-terminal 26, 81 or 96 aa respectively of p25. p25 aa1-97 /GFP contains the N-terminal 97 aa of p25, whereas the remaining sequence is deleted. (Schoelz et al., 2011) . However further research is required to demonstrate this possibility.",

            "text": "The clear reticular pattern observed in cells of p25/GFP infiltrated leaves suggested that p25/GFP targets the ER. This was assessed by determining if p25/GFP colocalized with ER-specific dsRed2 (pER-dsRed2) that contains an ER targeting N-terminal signal peptide sequence along with an ER retention signal (HDEL) (Zhang et al., 2005) . p25/GFP plus pER-dsRed2 coinfiltrated plants were examined by confocal microscopy. It can be seen in Fig. 2B (row 1) that the reticular pattern associated with p25/GFP expression in epidermal cells co-localized with the pER-dsRed2 fluorescence. In addition, some of the smaller green aggregates or punctae colocalized with pER-dsRed2 punctae. Similar punctae were not present in leaf tissue infiltrated with pER-dsRed2 alone (not shown) indicating that they represent local elaborations of the ER membrane induced by p25/GFP. These \"aggregates\" may correspond to vesicles that are derived from the ER as numerous vesicles can be found in CLSV infected leaf tissue as determined by ultrastructural analysis (see below). Larger green fluorescent aggregates in this image did not contain a corresponding red fluorescent signal (see arrowheads) suggesting that these correspond to primarily p25/GFP protein aggregates (which are later shown to be membrane anchored-see below). Fig. 2B (row 2) shows that CLSV p25/GFP also targets the perinuclear ER as indicated by its colocalization with pER-dsRed2 (see arrow in merged image). benthamiana were agroinfiltrated with CLSV p25/GFP and the subcellular sites of targeting were analyzed at 2-7 dpi using confocal microscopy. Panel 1 shows an epidermal cell from a leaf agroinfiltrated with unfused GFP. Note that the nucleus is filled and the periphery of the cell (cytoplasm) is labeled as expected. Panels 2 and 3 correspond to p25/GFP infiltrated epidermal cells. Notable features include large aggregates distributed throughout the cell but often in association with the nucleus (see arrows in panel 2), label in association with the periphery of the nucleus (see closed arrowhead, panel 2) and the presence of smaller aggregates or mobile foci along the periphery of the cell (see open arrowhead in panel 2). The higher magnification view in panel 3 shows that fluorescence is observed in association with a web-like structure reminiscent of the ER (arrows). (B) Construct p25/GFP colocalizes with pER-dsRed2, a construct that specifically targets the endoplasmic reticulum. Each agroinfiltration experiment (rows 1, 2) included p25/GFP, p19 and the pER-dsRed2 marker. The first column shows p25/GFP fluorescence and the second column shows pER-dsRed2 fluorescence. The third column (Merge) corresponds to the digitally superimposed images. Row 1 shows an epidermal cell in which the pER-dsRed2 signal appears as a network. It can be seen that the p25/GFP signal colocalizes with the ER marker. p25/GFP also produced punctae and large amorphous structures which may (arrows) or may not (arrowheads) have corresponding signals in the pER-dsRed2 image (see text). Row 2 shows colocalization of p25/GFP with pER-dsRed2 in a ring surrounding the nucleus (see arrow in merged image).",

At 2 days post-inoculation (dpi) confocal microscopy showed many punctae in the ER network at connections between tubules (Fig. 3 , panel 2; see arrow). In addition, tubules were less defined or absent (see arrowhead). This is distinct from the typical reticular pattern observed in uninfected plants (Fig. 3 , panel 1). Fig. 3 (panel 3) shows that the nucleus of CLSV infected plants is also distinct, i.e., numerous punctae or aggregates are present whereas in uninfected leaves the nucleus shows a smooth perinuclear ER boundary (Fig. 3 , panel 1, see arrowhead). By 5 dpi, infected cells show a highly irregular pattern with many punctae and apparent aggregates of ER and little discernible ER network (Fig. 3 , panel 4). As described above the aggregates may correspond to vesicles derived from the ER. Thus it is possible that targeting of CLSV p25 to the ER during infection results in a disordering of the ER network and elaborations of the ER (vesicles) that may serve as sites of viral RNA replication.",

Fig. 4 shows that three of the programs (HMMTOP, TMHMM, TMpred) predict two major TMDs at the p25 N-terminus whereas a 4th (PHDhtm) predicts a single TMD. From the combined data, two transmembrane deletion mutant constructs of p25 fused to GFP were created. One, p\u0394TMD1/GFP (Fig. 1) , contained a 26 amino acid N-terminal deletion of p25 to remove the first predicted transmembrane domain (Fig. 4 ) and the second, p\u0394TMD12/GFP ( Fig. 1) , contained an 81 aa N-terminal deletion to remove the first and second predicted transmembrane domains along with the intervening sequence between the two TMDs ( Fig. 4) . Confocal microscopy of plants co-infiltrated with either of these constructs and pER-dsRed2 was conducted to assess the role of one or both of the TMDs in targeting of p25 to the ER. Fig. 5A shows that p\u0394TMD1/ GFP retains the ability to colocalize with pER-dsRed2. This suggests that TMD1 plays a minimal or no role in targeting. However, in the case of p\u0394TMD12/GFP the green fluorescence associated with the ER was less sharp than that of p\u0394TMD1/GFP (compare the GFP channel of Fig. 5A with that of Fig. 5B (row 1). More markedly, the ER of the corresponding dsRed image in Fig. 5B (row 1) is much sharper than that of the GFP image. Also, when mesophyll cells of p\u0394TMD12/GFP infiltrated plants were observed, although the ER was labeled, and again not sharply, green fluorescence was also found to occur in the cytoplasm (Fig. 5B, suggest that TMD1 is not required for efficient ER targeting. The \"fuzzy\" labeling of the ER of p\u0394TMD12/GFP may represent an unstable association of the encoded protein with the ER as is supported by the presence of green fluorescence in the cytoplasm of the mesophyll cell.",

In these experiments, proteins associated with the membrane fraction will float near the top of the gradient, whereas aggregated protein which may have pelleted in the P30 fraction will form a pellet on the bottom of the tube. Any contaminating soluble proteins in the P30 fraction will also remain at the bottom of the gradient. Fig. 6C , which is a Western blot containing successive fractions from the gradient, shows that p25/GFP can only be detected at the top of the gradient (see third panel, lanes 2-4,) suggesting that all of p25/GFP is associated with the membrane fraction. Similarly, p\u0394TMD1/GFP, is found predominantly at the top of the gradient (Fig. 6C, second  panel, lanes 3,4) confirming that the loss of predicted TMD1 does not substantially affect the ability of p25 to bind the ER. Conversely, and in agreement with the results of confocal analysis and the cellular fractionation studies, p\u0394TMD12/GFP is found at both the top and bottom of the gradient (Fig. 6C, top panel) . Thus, the A) The 4th panel shows that p\u0394TMD1/GFP colocalizes with pER-dsRed2 in a sharp web like structure in mesophyll cells.

In mesophyll cells (row 2) infiltrated with \u0394TMD12/GFP fusion protein also appeared to locate in a diffuse manner with the ER (arrows) and was also present in the cytoplasm surrounding chloroplasts (arrowheads).

A mutant p25/GFP fusion protein construct, p\u0394TMD123/GFP was produced in which the N-terminal 98 aa of p25 were deleted (Fig. 1) .

Also, p25 is predominantly detected near the top of the gradient in the membrane flotation study (Fig. 8, lane 3) .

With respect to the ER derived vesicles the C-terminus is likely contained within the vesicle which can be seen as harboring the replicase in the same manner described for spherules and in which the N-and C-termini of the replicase reside in the cytoplasm (den Boon et al., 2010; Laliberte and Sanfacon, 2010) . A similar membrane arrangement for the p33-p36 proteins of the tombusviruses, CymRSV, CIRV and TBSV has been described wherein 2 TMDs traverse the membrane and the N-and C-termini are present in the cytoplasm (Navarro et al., 2004; Rajendran and Nagy, 2004; Rubino et al., 2001; Weber-Lotfi et al., 2002) . In the case of CLSV, the inside of the vesicle would originate from the cytoplasm. However, this raises the question as to how synthesized RNA could leave the vesicle. It is possible, as in the case of SARS coronavirus double membrane vesicles that these vesicles may actually represent tubules that are connected to the cytoplasm (Knoops et al., 2008) . Further research is required to definitively identify the arrangement p25 in vesicles and vesicles as sites of RNA replication.",

In the first step fusion protein ORFs were cloned into the intermediate vector pBBI525 between the dual 35S promoter and the Nos terminator. In the second step the region from the dual 35S promoter to the Nos terminator was cloned into pBINPLUS. In the first step the construct pBBI525/p25/GFP was made by trimolecular ligation of pBBI525 digested with BamHI, PCR amplified p25 ORF [from the CLSV full-length clone JR3 (Reade et al., 2003) ] and the GFP ORF (Xiang et al., 2006) . The p25 ORF was amplified using the forward primer NcoI_25K_F and the reverse primer SstII_25K_R and the JR3 plasmid template. The GFP ORF was obtained by SstII and BamHI digestion and purification from a pDRIVE-GFP vector ( Table 1 ). The resulting construct was digested with HindIII and EcoRI and cloned into the corresponding sites of pBINPLUS. The final structure of the p25/GFP construct is shown in Fig. 1. 1 um 200 nm 100 nm Fig. 9 . TEM micrographs of CLSV infected N. benthamiana cells.

Note that a membrane bound group of virus-like particles (closed arrow) (magnified in inset) is found within the group of vesicles suggesting that this structure may represent a virus factory carrying out both replication and encapsidation. Closed arrow heads point to virus particles found in the cytoplasm. B). Nucleus of a cell with an associated group of membrane bound vesicles as in A.

N. benthamiana was inoculated with CLSV virions. At 5 dpi leaves were macerated and subjected to differential centrifugation. 10 ml of the 3000g supernatant (S3) was centrifuged at 30,000g and the pellet (P30) which is enriched for membranes was resuspended in10 ml of buffer (see Materials and methods). Equal volumes of the S3, the 30,000g supernatant (S30) and P30 fractions were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis using a CLSV p25 specific antibody. It can be seen that the signal in the P30 fraction is more prominent than that in S30 fraction indicating that CLSV p25 is mainly associated with the membrane fraction. To confirm this, a membrane flotation assay was conducted utilizing the P30 fraction. It can be seen that p25 is detected exclusively in fraction 3 near the top of the sucrose gradient indicating that the signal in the p30 fraction indeed represents membrane associated protein rather than precipitated aggregates of p25.",

The 1 ml culture was transferred to 50 ml YEB medium containing the above antibiotics, 10 mM MES ( pH 5.6) and 20 mM acetosyringone and incubated overnight at 28 1C. The agrobacteria were centrifuged at 4000g for 6 min at 4 1C, and the pellet was resuspended in agroinfiltration buffer (10 mM MES pH 5.6, 10 mM MgCl2, 200 mM acetosyringone) to an OD600 of 1-1.5. The bacteria were then left at room temperature for at least 3 h without shaking. These cultures were used to agroinfiltrate N. benthamiana leaves. Simultaneous expression of two different constructs was done by coinfiltration of mixtures of bacterial suspensions. The suspensions were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with each construct having a final OD 600 of 1-1.5. The TBSV p19 protein was co-expressed in the agroinfiltrated plant cells to suppress induction of gene silencing (Voinnet et al., 2003) thereby allowing optimal expression of the fusion proteins. From two to seven days post-infiltration (dpi) plant leaves were examined daily by confocal microscopy and/or were collected for protein analysis.

(2) CLSV infected cells at 2 dpi showing partial disintegration of the ER network and the development of punctate foci along the ER network junctions (arrows). The arrowheads point to the barely visible ER tubules. (3) By 3 dpi the nucleus developed prominent punctate structures indicative of local elaborations of the nuclear ER or nuclear membrane (arrows). (4) CLSV infected cells at 5 dpi showing that the ER network appears to be largely disintegrated and punctae or larger aggregates of ER membrane are formed.",
