A recent study noted that decreasing the length of stay by 1 day in a patient with CAP had a potential economic benefit of $2000. 9 With new health care reforms imminent and the emphasis on better health care delivery, cost-effective treatment of pneumonia will assume greater significance.",

The Infectious Disease Society of America (IDSA)/American Thoracic Society (ATS) guideline from 2007 provides a summary of the approach to the treatment of CAP directed mainly towards primary care physicians, hospitalists, and emergency medicine physicians. 1 Multiple validated severity assessment scores have been developed that stratify patients according to the risk of death and can be used as decision support tools to guide site-of-care decisions. 10, 11 The emergence of drugresistant organisms, particularly drug-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae (DRSP), is another challenge in disease management. Biomarkers are increasingly being used to distinguish bacterial pneumonia from other causes and to help reduce the duration of antibiotic therapy. 12 This article reviews the recent advances in the diagnosis, management, and potential complications associated with CAP.",

Interactions between the host immune response, the virulence of the infecting organism, and the size of the inoculums determine whether a patient develops pneumonia. 13 Defective cough, mucociliary clearance, and impaired local and humoral immunity predispose to severe pneumonia. Alcohol consumption and smoking are independent risk factors for the development of pneumonia. Medical comorbidities such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), congestive heart failure, chronic kidney disease, liver disease, and immune deficiency states have an increased predisposition for the development of CAP. Recent use of proton pump inhibitor therapy started within 30 days has been identified as a risk factor for CAP. 14 Elderly patients are at increased risk for development of pneumonia and, when it occurs, they are more likely to die than younger individuals. 2 Although many patients develop severe pneumonia because of immune impairment, others develop acute lung injury (acute respiratory distress syndrome [ARDS]) as a consequence of unilateral pneumonia because of an inability to localize the immune response to the initial site of infection, possibly because of the presence of a genetic variation in their immune responsiveness. 15, 16 ",

Other pathogens include Hemophilus influenzae (particularly in cigarette smokers), Moraxella catarrhalis, Staphylococcus aureus (after influenza and recently in the form of methicillin-resistant S aureus [MRSA]), viruses (including influenza, respiratory syncytial virus, parainfluenza, and epidemic viruses), and atypical pathogens such as Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, and Legionella pneumophila. In most series, atypical pathogens are common, including in those admitted to the ICU, where they can account for up to 20% of the identified pathogens. In addition, many investigators have documented that atypical pathogens may coexist with bacterial pathogens, accounting for their presence in up to 60% of patients with CAP, when serologic testing is used. 17 Gram-negative bacteria (Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Escherichia coli, Enterobacter spp, Serratia spp, Proteus spp) are the causal agents in up to 10% of patients with CAP, but may be more common in patients who develop pneumonia out of the hospital and have HCAP risk factors. Gram-negative bacteria have been associated with severe CAP, and K pneumoniae was noted to be an independent risk factor for mortality in severe CAP. 18 In one study from Korea, in a multivariate analysis, the risk factors associated with gram-negative CAP were septic shock (with an odds ratio of 4.1), cardiac disease, smoking, hyponatremia, and dyspnea, emphasizing the association of these organisms with severe illness. 19 Enterobacter CAP behaves more like hospital-acquired pneumonia and is associated with prolonged mechanical ventilation, delay in initiation of antibiotics, and longer ICU stay. 20 Risk factors for community-acquired P aeruginosa pneumonia include bronchiectasis, immunocompromised state, use of multiple courses of antibiotics, prolonged glucocorticoids in patients with COPD, and recent hospitalization. 21 Anaerobic organisms should be considered when aspiration is suspected.",

Primary influenza pneumonia tends to cause severe pneumonia, which can be either caused by the virus itself or a result of secondary bacterial infection with pneumococcus, S aureus, or H influenzae. High-risk patients include those with chronic heart or lung disease, diabetes, immunosuppression, hemoglobinopathy, renal disease, and otherwise healthy individuals more than 65 years of age. Other viruses that cause CAP include Parainfluenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus, severe acute respiratory syndrome virus, varicella, Hantavirus, and adenovirus. Many of these patients have viral infection as part of a mixed infection, often with bacterial pathogens. 22 Emergence of DRSP and community-acquired MRSA is a matter of concern that has complicated the empiric therapy choices for patients with CAP. DRSP is seen most often in patients older than 65 years of age, and in those with a history of alcoholism, antibiotic therapy within 3 months, multiple medical comorbid conditions, exposure to children in day care, or those with immune-compromised states. 23 Community-associated MRSA (CA-MRSA) pneumonia occurs in patients with no prior health care exposure, usually after influenza, and may lead to a severe necrotizing pneumonia, although milder forms of illness have also been reported. 24 In patients with severe illness, the organism may produce a variety of exotoxins, including the Panton-Valentine leukocidin (PVL), which may contribute to lung necrosis. 25 Multidrug resistance has been reported with CA-MRSA strains but, in general, these organisms are more drug sensitive than their hospital-acquired counterparts. 26 Other less common causes of CAP include Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Coxiella burnetii (Q fever), Burkholderia pseudomallei (melioidosis), Chlamydophila psittaci (psittacosis), endemic fungi (histoplasmosis, coccidioidomycosis, blastomycosis), Pasteurella multocida, Bacillus anthracis, Actinomyces israeli, Francisella tularensis (tularemia), and Nocardia spp. These organisms should be included in the differential diagnosis when evaluating a patient with CAP, depending on the presence of specific risk factors that are noted in the clinical history.",

Chest radiograph may show areas of consolidation, pleural effusion, lung abscess, necrotizing pneumonia, or multilobar illness. It may help in pattern recognition of the disease process: H influenzae has a peribronchial distribution of bronchopneumonia; S pneumoniae infection can have either lobar consolidation or bronchopneumonia; atypical pathogens may have an alveolar and interstitial pattern; aspiration most commonly involves the superior segment of the right lower lobe or the posterior segment of the right upper lobe; hematogenous dissemination follows the distribution of blood flow and may lead to bilateral nodular infiltrates. 27 Cavitation or necrotizing pneumonia suggests infection with anaerobes, gram-negative bacteria, or S aureus, including MRSA. Loculated effusion can be ruled out by decubitus film or computed tomography (CT). Chest ultrasound is increasingly being used to assess the size, and to identify a safe site for sampling of pleural fluid. The usefulness of chest radiography is suboptimal in patients with very early infection, dehydration, severe granulocytopenia, structural changes such as with bullous emphysema, and in obese patients. It is reasonable to repeat a follow-up radiograph in 24 to 48 hours in patients who have had a negative initial finding, but have clinical signs of pneumonia. 1 There may be interobserver variability in chest radiographic interpretation of pneumonia. In a study that compared the readings of at least 2 radiologists, positive agreement (59%) was less frequent than negative agreement (94%). 34 CT has better sensitivity in diagnosing an infiltrate than chest radiography, but it is not routinely used, because there is a lack of evidence that use of CT scan improves outcomes. 35 ",

In one recent study, cardiac biomarkers, such as midregional proadrenomedullin, were better predictors of 28-day and 180-day mortality than inflammatory biomarkers such as PCT. In that study, biomarkers correlated with disease severity and mortality, but did not help with causal diagnosis. 41 In another prospective study evaluating the relationship between biomarkers and ICU admission, inflammatory biomarkers helped identify patients needing intensive care monitoring, including those requiring delayed ICU admission. 42 The inflammatory biomarkers that have been studied most extensively are CRP and PCT, both of which are acute-phase reactants primarily produced by the liver in the presence of bacterial infection, but not viral illness. CRP may identify which patients with acute respiratory symptoms have infectious pneumonia; levels are higher in patients who require hospitalization and in those with pneumococcal and Legionella infection. 43 PCT is a hormokine, produced in response to microbial toxins and certain host responses associated with bacterial infection, but inhibited by viral-related cytokines. Serum levels tend to be high in patients with CAP, who benefit from antibiotic therapy, and in those with an increased risk of death from CAP. Serial measurements of serum levels have also been used to define when antibiotics can be safely stopped in the presence of CAP. 12, 44, 45 In one study of 302 patients with radiographic infiltrates and suspected CAP, initiation of antibiotics and duration of therapy were determined by randomizing patients to management by an algorithm dictated by serial PCT measurements versus management by clinical assessment. The PCT-guided group had significantly fewer antibiotic prescriptions on admission and less antibiotic usage, and the duration of therapy was reduced from 12 to 5 days with similar clinical success. 46 ",

The PSI stratifies patients into 5 categories based on 30-day mortality, by using a scoring system based on 20 factors. It includes demographic characteristics, coexisting illnesses, physical examination findings, laboratory measurements, and radiographic finding. 50 Patients in classes IV (30-day mortality risk of 4%-10%) and V (27% risk of death at 30 days) are usually admitted to the hospital and often to the ICU. Those in low-risk classes I and II are often treated as outpatients, whereas it is a clinical judgment whether those in class III should be hospitalized. The PSI score includes age as an important determinant of point scoring and hence can overestimate the severity of illness in the elderly and in those with comorbidity. In one study of patients in PSI class V, only approximately 20% needed ICU admission, and these tended to be individuals who scored points based on acute illness features, and not on age and comorbid illness factors. 51 In contrast, the PSI may underestimate severity of illness in young patients without comorbid illness, especially if their vital sign abnormalities are slightly less than the cutoffs used in the scoring system. 52 This was a particular problem during recent influenza epidemics that have involved primarily younger populations, in which PSI scoring was not valuable for defining the need for ICU admission.",

Patients with 2 of these criteria have a high enough risk of death that they should probably be admitted to the hospital, while those with 3 or more points should be considered for ICU admission. Modifications of this tool, without the laboratory measurement of blood urea nitrogen (CRB-65) have also been found to be similarly accurate. 53 The limitation of this approach is its focus on assessment of only clinical parameters, such as vital signs, but without measurement of oxygenation or serial measurement of severity of illness after the initial hospital admission, and that it does not evaluate the presence of comorbid illness and its decompensation from baseline. 54 Serum biomarkers can be used to supplement data obtained by prognostic scoring. 55 Data from the German Competence Network for the Study of Community Acquired Pneumonia (CAPNETZ) Study Group, showed that all new biomarkers were good predictors of short-term and long-term all-cause mortality and correlated with CRB-65 score. 41 In other studies, low levels of PCT were able to define patients at low risk of death regardless of findings using severity scoring. Huang and colleagues 55 as well as Kruger and colleagues 56 found, that even in patients identified as high risk using CURB-65 or PSI, a low PCT value predicted a low chance of dying. 55, 56 Severe CAP Scoring systems can also be used to help define which patients need ICU care, identifying those with severe illness. The IDSA/ATS guidelines and the PIRO (predisposition, insult, response, and organ dysfunction) scoring system were developed to help define mortality risk in patients with severe pneumonia. According to the 2007 IDSA/ATS guidelines, severe CAP is present if a patient needs invasive mechanical ventilation or requires vasopressors or has any 3 of 9 from the minor criteria listed later. Liapakou and colleagues 57 found that patients meeting the major criteria needed ICU admission, but those patients who had only minor criteria present had no increased mortality risk, regardless of how many criteria were met. More recently, Brown and colleagues 58 found that both the positive and negative predictive value of minor criteria exceeded 80% if 4 criteria were used to define the need for ICU admission rather than just 3 criteria.",

In most patients, the chest radiograph usually clears within 4 weeks, especially in patients younger than 50 years without underlying pulmonary disease or bacteremia. However, resolution may be delayed for 12 weeks or longer in older individuals and those with underlying lung disease and bacteremia.",

Diagnostic testing can include a chest CT scan, bronchoscopy, and, in some cases, open lung biopsy. Organizing pneumonia is a complication of viral lung infection and other processes, and is characterized by fibroblast proliferation and diagnosed by a combination of radiographic findings, bronchoscopic lung biopsy, and the absence of ongoing infection. It is often managed with a therapeutic trial of steroids. The definitive investigation is an open lung biopsy.",

The chest radiograph shows an effusion, which should be sampled, and, if a low pleural fluid pH is present (<7.2 if previously healthy, but <7.3 if chronically ill) or if organisms are present, chest tube drainage and prolonged antibiotic therapy is required. A connection between the pleural space and the lung can develop and result in a bronchopleural fistula, which can be caused by erosion of the lung infection to the pleural surface. Bronchopleural fistula is initially treated conservatively with antibiotics and a chest tube, but sometimes requires surgical repair. Localized bronchiectasis can be a long-term sequela of CAP, as a result of injury and dilation of the bronchus, and can be seen on CT scan of the chest. Patients present with chronic productive sputum and recurrent infection on the same area. Treatment is with postural drainage, antibiotics for exacerbation, and bronchodilators for coexisting airflow obstruction.",

Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine should be given to all patients aged 65 years or older, and to younger patients with chronic heart or lung disease, asplenia, diabetes mellitus, and to residents of long-term care facilities. One revaccination after 5 years should be given to those with either a poor immune response or after age 65 years for those first immunized before the age of 65 years. In guidelines, and also in performance measures for hospitalized patients, vaccination should be given before discharge for all patients admitted with CAP.",
