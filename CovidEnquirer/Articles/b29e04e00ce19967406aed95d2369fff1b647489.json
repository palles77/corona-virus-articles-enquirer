            "text": "An outbreak of atypical pneumonia in Guangdong Province, People's Republic of China, that has continued since November, 2002, is reported to have affected 792 people and caused 31 deaths. 1 In adjacent Hong Kong, surveillance of severe atypical pneumonia was heightened in the public hospital network under the Hospital Authority of Hong Kong. By the end of February, 2003, clusters of patients with pneumonia were noted in Hong Kong, along with affected close contacts and health-care workers. The disease did not respond to empirical antimicrobial treatment for acute community-acquired typical or atypical pneumonia. Bacteriological and virological pathogens known to cause pneumonia were not identified. Thus, the new disorder was called severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Subsequently, SARS has spread worldwide to involve patients in North America, Europe, and other Asian countries. 1 We investigated patients in Hong Kong to try to identify the causal agent.",

            "text": "The family Coronaviridae includes the genus Coronavirus and Torovirus. They are enveloped RNA viruses that cause disease in human beings and animals. The previously known human coronaviruses, types 229E and OC43 are a major cause of the common cold. 6 They can occasionally cause pneumonia in older adults, neonates, or immunocompromised patients. 7, 8 Coronaviruses have been reported to be an important cause of pneumonia in military recruits, accounting for up to 30% of cases in some studies. 9 Human coronaviruses can infect neurons, and viral RNA has been detected in the brain of patients with multiple sclerosis. 10 On the other hand, several animal coronaviruses (eg, porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus, murine hepatitis virus, and avian infectious bronchititis virus) cause respiratory, gastrointestinal, neurological, or hepatic disease in their respective hosts. 11 Phylogenetically, human pneumonia-associated coronavirus was not closely related to any known human or animal coronavirus or torovirus. We based our analysis on a 646 bp fragment of the polymerase gene which showed that the virus belongs to antigenic group 2 of the coronaviruses, along with murine hepatitis virus and bovine coronavirus. However, viruses of the Coronaviridae can undergo heterologous recombination within the virus family and genetic analysis of other parts of the genome needs to be done before the nature of this new virus is more conclusively defined. 6 The biological, genetic, and clinical data taken together show that the new virus is not one of the two known human coronaviruses. Antibody to the previously recognised human 229E and OC43-like coronaviruses is widespread in the human population. 12 The lack of serological reactivity against the novel pneumoniaassociated coronavirus among our patients implies that there is little antigenic cross reactivity between it and the 229E or OC43 viruses.",

By contrast, neither antibody nor viral RNA was detectable in healthy controls. All 32 patients from whom acute and convalescent sera were available had rising antibody titres to human pneumonia-associated coronavirus, which strengthens the contention that a recent infection with this virus is a necessary factor in the evolution of SARS. In addition, all five pairs of acute and convalescent sera tested from patients from other hospitals in Hong Kong also showed seroconversion to the virus. Five patients who had SARS had no serological or virological evidence of coronavirus infection. They need to have later convalescent sera tested to define whether they seroconvert subsequently. However, the concordance of human pneumoniaassociated coronavirus with the clinical definition of SARS seems remarkable, given that clinical case definitions are never perfect.",

            "text": "We describe the clinical presentation and complications of SARS. Less than 25% of patients with coronaviral pneumonia had upper-respiratory-tract symptoms. As expected in atypical pneumonia, both respiratory symptoms and positive auscultatory findings were disproportionally mild compared with the chest radiographic findings. Gastrointestinal symptoms were present in 10% of patients. These symptoms are relevant since the viral RNA is detectable in faeces of some patients and coronaviruses have been associated with diarrhoea in animals and human beings. 13 The high incidence of altered liver function, leucopenia, severe lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, and subsequent evolution into adult respiratory distress syndrome suggests a severe systemic inflammatory damage induced by this human pneumonia-associated coronavirus. Thus immunomodulation by steroid treatment may be important to complement the empirical antiviral treatment with ribavirin. It is pertinent that severe human disease associated with the avian influenza subtype H5N1, another virus that has crossed from animals to human beings, has also been postulated to have an immunopathological component. 14 In common with H5N1 disease, patients with severe SARS are adults, have lymphopenia, and have variables of organ dysfunction beyond the respiratory tract. 15 A window of opportunity of around 8 days exists from the onset of symptoms to respiratory failure. Severe complicated cases are strongly associated with underlying disease and delayed use of ribavirin and steroid treatment. After our clinical experience in the first cases, we started this combination treatment very early in subsequent cases, which were generally uncomplicated at the time of admission. The overall mortality at the time of writing was only 2% with use of this treatment regimen. Eight of 19 complicated cases still had shown no notable response. A detailed analysis of the therapeutic response to this combination regimen is impossible, given the heterogeneous dosing and time of starting treatment. The choice of ribavirin was made on empirical grounds, before the cause was identified. It might have to be reviewed once the in-vitro susceptibility of human pneumonia-associated coronavirus to antivirals is better understood.",

However, detection of viral RNA does not prove that the virus is viable or transmissible. If viable virus is detectable in the faeces, this is potentially an additional route of transmission. Several animal coronaviruses are spread via the faecal-oral route. 11 Samples from patients with SARS were not readily distinguishable from samples from other patients on receipt in the laboratory. Thus, initial processing of these samples was done under biohazard level-2 containment. However, culture of the virus was done in biosafety level-3 containment. These containment measures have proved successful so far, in that no laboratory infections have been documented.",

A 72-year-old woman was found to have an elevated alkaline phosphatase (ALP) concentration of 1500 IU/L (normal 80-130 IU/L) a year ago on routine laboratory evaluation at an outside hospital. The patient had no symptoms. No further work-up was done. A year later, while undergoing a follow-up magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) scan for a previous stroke, multiple mixed blastic and lytic lesions were seen in the skull suggestive of Paget's disease (figure). The skull was enlarged and slightly compressing the frontal lobes bilaterally. The patient remained well (including normal hearing) and the only neurological deficit was from prior stroke. Serum ALP was 1055 IU/L. Liver function tests were normal. A computed tomography scan (CT) confirmed the Pagetic nature of the lesions. A Tc-99 bone scan showed intense isotope uptake in the skull. The other areas of uptake were considered to be due to degenerative joint disease. The patient was started on an oral bisphosphonate. Paget's disease is commonly seen in elderly population with elevated ALP concentrations on routine laboratory evaluation being the most common presentation. In many patients, ALP is only mildly elevated, however, if the concentrations are very high, skull involvement should be suspected. Treatment with bisphosphonates is mandatory to prevent neurological complications.",
