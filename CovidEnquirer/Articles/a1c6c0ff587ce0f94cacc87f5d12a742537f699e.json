A good understanding of the current status and issues of indoor environmental quality (IEQ) in naturally ventilated urban buildings and the association with urban microclimate is fundamental for improving their IEQ. This paper reviews past studies on (a) the microclimate in urban street canyons, (b) the potential influence of such microclimate on IEQ of nearby naturally ventilated buildings, and (c) the real-life IEQ status in these buildings. The review focuses mainly on studies conducted by on-site measurements. The microclimate in urban street canyons is characterized by low wind speed, high surface temperature difference, high pollutant concentration, and high noise level. Insufficient ventilation rates and excessive penetration of outdoor pollutants are two key risks involved in naturally ventilated urban buildings. Existing knowledge suggests that reasonable urban planning and careful building envelope design are the primary methods to ensure acceptable IEQ and maximize the utilization of natural ventilation. However, quantitative studies of both microclimate in street canyons and IEQ in buildings are still highly insufficient in many aspects, which make cross comparison and influencing factors analysis currently impossible. Based on the limitations of previous studies and the current issues of naturally ventilated urban buildings, suggestions are made for future studies to better understand and improve IEQ in naturally ventilated urban buildings.",

            "text": "Many buildings in a wide spectrum of geographical regions are more or less naturally ventilated, primarily because of the wellknown advantages of natural ventilation in energy saving and health effect. Driven by wind and buoyancy forces [1e3], natural ventilation has a great potential to offset energy consumption by mechanical ventilation systems [4e8] . Compared to air conditioned buildings, naturally ventilated buildings are closely associated with reduced prevalence of sick building syndrome symptoms, crosscontamination risk of airborne infectious diseases, and shortterm sick leave [9e15] . However, some buildings are naturally ventilated, essentially because their windows or doors have to be open to connect indoor with outdoor. Shops on the ground floors need open doors for business. Ordinary residential and school buildings must open windows or ventilation grilles, at least intermittently, to dilute indoor stale air, because ordinary domestic air conditioners provide no fresh air [16] . It was reported that continuous operation of such air-conditioners with closed windows and doors will rapidly elevate the indoor CO 2 concentration [17, 18] and result in a deteriorated indoor air quality [8, 19] . Regardless of intentions, the wide existence of natural ventilation in urban buildings highlights the need to pay special attention to their indoor environmental quality (IEQ).",

            "text": "IEQ in naturally ventilated buildings strongly relies on local outdoor microclimate, including particularly wind speed, air temperature, pollutant concentration and noise level [11,20e22] . Fig. 1 presents schematically the association between IEQ in naturally ventilated buildings and the microclimate in their nearby street canyon through the breath process at building envelopes. Wind speed in urban areas, especially in high-density cities, is seriously decreased [23] . Climatic data shows that wind speed at 20 m above the ground level in urban area of Hong Kong (specifically in Tseung Kwan O) has decreased from 2.5 m/s to 1.5 m/s over a 10-year period from 1994 to 2004 [24] . Low wind speeds in street canyons result in less pressure differences around buildings to drive indoor natural ventilation. It was reported that air temperature inside a street canyon is lower by 3e5 C than the corresponding air temperature above the canyon [25] and is higher by nearly 2 C than that in a suburban location [25, 26] . In addition, traffic-related air pollution and noise are two serious environmental issues in urban street canyons. Owing to increased traffic emissions and adverse dispersion conditions including low wind speeds [27, 28] , pollutants can stagnate and accumulate to reach very high levels in street canyons [29e33] . Moreover, road-side noise levels measured in street canyons frequently exceed the legislated limit of 70 dBA [34e36]. Together with low wind speeds and high air temperature, such high pollutant concentrations and high noise levels could significantly deteriorate IEQ in naturally ventilated urban buildings and even hinder its use [21] .",

This paper provides an overview of past studies on the microclimate in urban street canyons and the associated IEQ in naturally ventilated urban buildings. To do so, it investigated relevant publications in related journals, including particularly Building and Environment and Atmospheric Environment. Major books regarding natural ventilation and urban environment were also investigated. Among these numerous publications, this paper further focused on studies conducted by on-site measurements, whereas studies by model experiments, numerical simulations, empirical and analytical models were paid little attention. On-site measurements were focused, essentially because they provide the first-hand data to reveal the real-life street canyon microclimate and IEQ in buildings, which are thus the best choice to answer the research questions defined in this paper (see next paragraph). Model experiments, such as atmospheric boundary layer wind tunnel experiments, use reducedscale models to investigate the basic structure of flow and pollutant dispersion around building(s) and provide benchmark data for numerical validations, which, however, are constrained by similarity criteria [37] . Numerical simulations, such as computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulations, are very powerful and widely used to investigate flow related processes in the built environment, which can provide whole-field data and do not have similarity problems [38, 39] . However, both model experiments and numerical simulations use simplified physical models and cannot take the influence of all environmental parameters into account. Empirical models provide a rapid but crude estimation normally for engineering applications, while analytical models increase the understanding of physical mechanisms but are limited to very simple flow problems.",

When the buildings are widely spaced (AR < 0.3e0.4), their flow fields do not interact and thus are almost the same with those around isolated buildings. At closer spacing (AR up to 0.65e0.7), the wake of an upstream building is interfered by the flow field of its downstream building. At even greater spacing (AR > 0.65e0.7), the ambient flow skims over the building tops; such a flow regime is called skimming flow. The study of wind environment in skimming-flow street canyons were paid special attentions, as they are generally considered to be with a worse wind condition compared to those in lower AR streets. Flow patterns inside a street canyon are very distinctive in response to different ambient wind conditions above the canyon [11,23,25,41e45] , which are particularly associated with the along and the across canyon velocity components above the canyon. Under a parallel ambient flow, if the wind speed above the canyon is high, a strong relationship between the outside and the inside flows can be found. Wind inside the canyon flows along the canyon axis with possible uplifts along the building walls, due to the friction of building walls and ground surface. Under a perpendicular ambient flow, if the wind speed above the canyon is high, the canyon flow can be seen as a secondary circulatory flow driven by the imposed flow above the canyon. Under an oblique ambient flow, which occurs in most time, helical vortexes could be developed along street canyons. For all ambient wind directions, if the wind speed above the canyon is low, the coupling between the upper flow and the canyon flow is lost, where thermal flows and mechanical disturbances play a significant role in shaping the wind flow patterns inside the canyon.",

            "text": "The threshold ambient wind speed depends on the canyon AR. According to [46] , who worked with a street canyon with AR equal to 1.4, the threshold value to establish the coupling and to form circulatory vortexes inside the canyon is between 1.5 m/s and 2.0 m/s. Similar values are reported by Refs. [41, 42, 47, 48] . They worked with canyons having aspect ratios ranging from 1 to 1.52. However, as shown by Ref. [49] , for canyons with a higher AR (that is 2.5 in their study), the coupling is established under a much higher ambient wind speed ranging approximately between 4 m/s and 5 m/s (corresponding to the across canyon wind speed equal to 2e3 m/s). It was also stated that the correlation between the wind speed inside and above the canyon is unclear when the ambient wind speed was below this range [49] . The value 4 m/s was defined as the threshold wind speed in their later studies [50, 51] of predicting wind speeds inside street canyons. Comparison of these results may imply that the threshold wind speed increases with the increase of AR value. This should be explained by that a faster wind is required to penetrate into a deeper street canyon. However, the influence of other factors, such as meteorological condition and buoyancy force, on this threshold cannot be revealed from these studies [41,42,46e51] . Some studies measured simultaneously wind speeds inside and outside (mostly above) a canyon, which are summarized in Table 1 . Note that there could be several measurement locations along Table 1 Comparison of measured wind speeds inside and above canyons; climate classification is made according to K\u20ac oppeneGeiger Climate Classification System [52] ; Uo is ambient wind speed, Uo\u00c0m mean ambient wind speed, U o\u00c0p% p% of ambient wind speeds, and similar naming method for wind speed inside canyon U i , L/H ratio of street length L to building height H. First, regardless of other influencing factors, a significant decrease of wind speed inside a street canyon is evident in comparison with wind speed outside the canyon. Fig. 2 presents the statistical relationship between wind speeds inside and above a street canyon with an AR equal to 2.5. The ratio of wind speed inside a canyon to that outside the canyon is mostly in the order of 10e30%, whereas relatively large ratios (over 0.6) are reported by Refs. [41, 54] . Variation in this ratio should be attributed to many influencing factors, such as topography, gross building coverage ratio [57] , canyon AR [25, 40, 44] , locations of measurement, and ambient wind speed and direction above the canyon. In addition, if the coupling of wind flow between canyon interior and its above atmosphere is not established, this wind ratio should be of little significance. Even if the coupling is achieved, the relationship between the wind ratio and other influencing factors is still unknown.",

Fig. 4 presents a schematic view of the thermal environment inside a street canyon, where the maximum temperatures and temperature differences reported in two previous studies [49, 58] are also included. In general, due to different solar incidence angle, horizontal ground surfaces have much higher temperatures than vertical wall surfaces [58e62]. With a same solar incidence angle, a surface with a lower albedo can reach a much higher surface temperature than that with a higher albedo [58] . The change of solar incidence angle with time could lead to a significant change in surface temperatures inside a canyon, with daily amplitudes up to 35 C, while the maximum temperature between two opposite building walls with and without direct solar radiation was observed to be up to 19 C [49] . In addition, a canyon with a higher AR value has a more restricted sky view factor and thus can produce a stronger shading effect to solar radiation [26, 60, 63, 64] than a canyon with a lower AR value. This supports considering high AR urban configurations in low latitude geographical regions, where minimization of solar radiation is a desirable criterion in urban design [60, 64] . Compared to the results measured in a canyon with AR equal to 2.5 [49] , relatively lower surface temperatures and temperature differences were reported in a deeper canyon with AR equal to 3.3 [25] , where the maximum surface temperature during the daytime varies between 35 C and 41 C and the maximum daily simultaneous temperature difference between the two opposite facades, as a function of the canyon's height, was between 9 C and 18 C.",

However, in contrast to surface temperature, canyon configurations and surface materials do not cause an obvious influence in air temperature [26] , provided that the AR value is not extremely high (e.g., higher than 7e10 in Ref. [65] ). Slightly lower air temperatures (by 1e3 C) were observed in narrower street canyons with AR ranging from 2 to 4 than those in wider street canyons with AR ranging from 0.7 to 0.9 during the daytimes, while such temperature differences were 3e4 C during the nighttimes [26] . It is thus believed that the average air temperature is determined dominantly by large-scale regional factors rather than street-scale factors [59, 66, 67] . Vertically, no pronounced temperature stratification as a function of canyon's height was observed, which should be attributed to the strong mixing and advective phenomena inside the canyon [49] . However, due to shading effect, the air temperature inside a deep canyon with the AR equal to 3.3 during the daytime was observed to be 3e5 C lower than the corresponding air temperature above the canyon [25] . In addition, the heat island effect, namely the air temperature difference between a monitoring location inside the canyon and a background station, was mostly close to 2 C [25, 26] . However, the air temperature difference between the monitoring location above the canyon and the background one was between 4 C and 11 C [68, 69] .",

            "text": "The above review provides a basic understanding of thermal environment in street canyons, although cross comparison of different measurements and influencing factors analysis are difficult. From above review, two remarks can be made. First, under low latitude geographical regions, deep street canyons with high ARs are an important design criterion in urban development in order to reduce solar radiation into the canyons. However, as reviewed in the previous Section 2.1, deep canyons normally correspond to stagnant wind speeds, which lead to negative effects on removing pollutants. In this context, exploring optimal AR values are still needed when taking into account solar gain, city ventilation and pollutant removal. Second, anthropogenic heat and use of low albedo (and high absorbing) street materials are important reasons causing higher temperatures inside street canyons [49] . Akbari et al. [70] reported that changing the surface albedo from 0.25 to 0.4 in a typical mid-latitude warm climate can lower afternoon air temperatures on summer days by 4 C. Owing to the heat rejection by air-conditioners, the recessed spaces outside high-rise residential buildings in Hong Kong have a maximum temperature elevation of 11 C [71] . 4 .

            "text": "Similar with flow pattern, air quality in skimming-flow deep canyons [23] was mostly investigated, as they represent the worst condition for pollutants dilution [91] . Under a specific environmental condition, a narrower canyon generally corresponds to a worse street-level air quality [92] . Dispersion and dilution of airborne pollutants in a street canyon rely strongly on the exchange rate of flow between a canyon interior and its upper atmosphere [93, 94] . When the ambient wind speed above a canyon is too low to establish the coupling between the canyon interior and its upper atmosphere (see Section 2.1), pollutants accumulate in the street canyon [46,95e97] . On the contrary, when the ambient wind speed is sufficiently high to establish such a coupling, pollutants can be effectively diluted to the upper atmosphere. The pollutant concentrations and pedestrian exposure levels in street canyons are closely associated with the traffic intensity [98e101]. Typically, high concentrations of traffic-related pollutants, such as PM 2.5 , PM 10e2.5 , black carbon (BC) and monocyclic aromatic hydrocarbons, in street canyons were reported in rush hours on workdays [102e104]. Fig. 5 presents schematically a spatial concentration distribution inside a street canyon. In general, horizontally, traffic-related pollutants maintain relatively high concentrations in a region near the leeward side of a canyon [95, 100, 105, 106] , while concentrations decrease vertically along height above the ground on both sides of the canyon [27] . Vakeva et al. [107] reported that the concentrations of submicron particles and gaseous pollutants emitted at street level decrease by 80% at the height of 25 m. Concentration gradients in vertical profiles of fine particles are still obvious [27] ; it is 12% between two measurement levels at 2.5 m and 8.9 m. They explained that the decrease of canyon concentrations in the upper part of the canyon is due to the enhanced turbulence and mixing. In contrast to fine particles and gases, due to the gravitational effect, significant vertical concentration gradients were reported for larger-sized particles [108] . Table 2 summarizes the reported ratios of pollutant concentration measured in a street canyon to that in a corresponding background location, such as urban park and suburban area. These concentration ratios are mostly between 1.0 and 3.0, indicating high contrasts of pollutant concentration between traffic streets and background locations. However, dependent on traffic intensity, the concentration ratios should vary in both space and time. In addition, owing to the limited number of on-site measurement, the influence of climate characteristics and the measurement period cannot be revealed from the results summarized in Table 2 . Largescale and long-term measurements would be useful for cross comparison and influencing factors analysis.",

Previous on-site measurements (see Table 3 ) indicate that road-side noise levels in street canyons frequently exceed the legislated limit of 70 dBA [34] . Note that one study [116] reports median noise levels, while others report mean values. Exception are those reported by Morelli et al. [116] , who measured noise levels in three European cities, which are all below though still close to 70 dBA. Owing to the uneven distribution of traffic intensity, these reported traffic noise levels in specific street canyon(s) could not represent the average noise level in a city, which, however, are sufficient to demonstrate the severe sound environment in urban areas. Such high levels of traffic noise would certainly lead to a deteriorated indoor sound environment. Nicol and Wilson [117] measured the vertical variations of noise level in nine street canyons with AR varying from 1.0 to 5.0. Based on these measured data, they then developed a mathematical model to predict noise levels inside a street canyon as a function of street width and height above the street (see Fig. 6 ), which are intended to provide guidances for building design. In general, noise level increases with the increase of street width, which is attributed to that a wider street corresponds to a higher traffic intensity. Moreover, noise level attenuates along canyon height. Therefore, noise level is easier to exceed 70 dBA at the lower part of street canyons. In a deep canyon in Hong Kong [118] , the noise level at several lower floors (1/F-3/F, 5/F) is greater than 70 dBA.",

The influence of outdoor temperature and noise on indoor environment is almost instant and easy to be sensed by occupants. When suffering from intolerable temperature and noise level, active control measures, such as closing windows and turning on air conditioners, can be taken immediately. As a result, studies regarding indoor temperature and noise level were paid mostly to exploring subjective sensation and comfortable range, which are out of the scope of this paper. On the contrary, insufficient ACH values and excessive indoor air pollutants are difficult to detect by human body, which thus could cause serious negative health effects to occupants.

Decreased wind speeds would result in lowered pressure differences around buildings to drive indoor natural ventilation. Therefore, natural ventilation performance in urban buildings drops largely compared to rural areas [121] . van Hooff and Blocken [122] evaluated quantitatively the influence of surrounding buildings on natural ventilation performance of a large semi-enclosed stadium using CFD method. It was found that neglecting the surroundings can lead to overestimations of the ACH up to 96% (see Fig. 7 ). Gao and Lee [123] worked with a group of high-rise residential buildings and found that the presence of surrounding buildings lowers the wind speed in the vicinity of buildings by 2.5%e86.8%. In addition, Georgakis and Santamouris [25] compared ACH values calculated using climate data measured inside and above a canyon with AR value equal to 3.3. Results show that, inside the street canyon, ACH values for single-sided and cross ventilation are reduced by 82% and 68%, respectively. These studies indicated quantitatively the significant blocking effect of surrounding buildings and thus suggested explicitly the importance of describing the surroundings in detail when assessing natural ventilation performance in buildings [124] . Among influencing factors, a better building disposition, particularly a wider street, is very important to enhance air penetration and movement inside street canyons and thus potentially improve natural ventilation performance in buildings [125, 126] .",

First, the reported ACH values vary significantly between different measurements and some of them are insufficient (or intermittently insufficient) for maintaining acceptable IAQ, which indicates basically that natural ventilation performance is determined by many factors, such as wind speed and direction, opening configuration, surrounding characteristics, and floor location in a building. This is a well-known disadvantage of natural ventilation technique. Georgakis and Santamouris [25] observed very low ventilation rates, probably because the outdoor wind was nearly parallel to the canyon axis during the measurements. Relatively small ventilation rates obtained by Gilkeson et al. [130] could be attributed to the fact that the maximum opening was 0.1 m due to a locking mechanism. The one-year measurement in four-students dormitories by Li et al. [17] showed that single-sided natural ventilation could not provide sufficient outdoor air to dilute the indoor CO 2 in 18% of the measured period, while ACH values were all less than the recommendation (2.3 h \u00c01 ) of IAQ standards [131] .",

However, I/O ratios of general pollutants that can be generated from both the indoor and the outdoor environment are hardly helpful for understanding the indoor and outdoor concentration relationship, as they vary considerably among different studies [142e144] . Such variations could be attributed to that the I/O ratios depend strongly on indoor and outdoor emission rates, window or crack characteristics and air exchange rates. Studies of PM levels inside and outside naturally ventilated residential buildings [145] , commercial office buildings [146] and school buildings [147] indicated that indoor activities are the main contributor of indoor PM levels. However, there are sufficient evidences demonstrating that outdoor pollutants can easily penetrate into its nearby indoor environment through flow exchanges [146,148e151] . Fischer et al. [152] reported that outdoor PM 10 and PM 2.5 concentrations are 15e20% higher at homes located in high traffic intensity streets in Amsterdam than those in low traffic streets, while outdoor concentrations of the particulate components Benzoapyrene (BaP) and total PAHs, as well as the gaseous components benzene and total VOCs are almost 100% higher at high traffic intensity homes. Similarly, I/O ratios for PM 2.5 were found to be higher at the trafficked site than the residential site [153] . A comparative study by Lai et al. [154] found that the I/O ratio of ozone for using natural ventilation is significantly higher than for using mechanical ventilation with filtrations. Moreover, Rivas et al. [155] reported that the indoor levels of traffic sourced pollutants, such as NO 2 , equivalent black carbon (EBC), ultrafine particles (UFP) and stibium (Sb), are very similar to those recorded outdoors.",

They found that I/O ratios under natural ventilation with open windows are close to 1.0 (see Fig. 8 ), which are substantially higher than those under infiltration and mechanical ventilation. Kliucininkas et al. [157] measured indoor and outdoor PAHs in six urban homes. When there is no indoor PAHs source, the I/O ratio ranges from 0.05 to 0.36, which can be regarded as the penetrated portion from the outdoor environment. Amato et al. [158] analyzed the indoor and outdoor sources of PM 2.5 in 39 primary schools. They found that approximately 47% of indoor PM 2.5 is generated indoors and 53% outdoors. Among outdoor sources, the traffic contribution was highlighted, suggesting avoiding orienting windows directly to the traffic street. Meier et al. [159] modeled indoor air pollution originated from the outdoor environment using regression models, revealing that the fractions of outdoor pollutants entering indoors are between 30% and 66% except for the coarse particles. These quantitative studies indicate explicitly that outdoor air pollutants are an important contributor of indoor air pollution. However, the amount of penetration is still highly case-dependent.",

The highest concentration and concentration fluctuation intensity were found near the windward walls, while the indoor concentration levels responded quickly to outdoor source and were much higher under naturally ventilated condition than under mechanically ventilated condition. Yang et al.

It was reported that, driven by wind pressure, CO produced from a house-used natural gas water heater installed in the balcony could diffuse into the adjacent room through crack infiltration [162] , where the indoor CO concentration levels could reach a pronounced level under adverse ventilation condition. Motivated by the transmission of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes (SARS) within a same building, a series of studies [135e137] were conducted to investigate the pollutant dispersion from one unit to its adjacent unit in same multistory buildings through open windows via airflow route. The dispersion routes and reentry possibilities of such an inter-unit transmission in five-story buildings were revealed quantitatively (see Fig. 9 for examples), which confirmed its validity and severity.

Existing studies also suggested that building disposition (urban planning) based on local environmental conditions strongly determines the microclimate in street canyons [125, 126] . The reason is that a well-planned urban area corresponds to an effective flow exchange between the canyon interior and its above atmosphere, which will not only ensure a moving flow in street canyons but also dilute polluted air. The former is the essential element to produce pressure differences to drive natural ventilation in buildings, and the latter helps to create a good outdoor environment for natural ventilation. Influenced by climate characteristics, meteorological condition, urban morphology, building disposition, and building height, the microclimate, particularly the wind condition, in a street canyon are very complex and are far from well understood from existing studies. In addition, the influence of these factors on the measured results cannot be revealed from existing studies. Particularly, short-term measurements are not useful to reveal the influence of climate characteristics. It is suggested that large-scale, long-term, highresolution, standardized on-site measurements in typical street canyons should be conducted to accumulate detailed local wind data. Representative measurement campaigns in the past include the European projects URBVENT [11] and RESHYVENT [163] , as well as the French project PRIMEQUAL [22] . These data can be (a) summarized and analyzed to find their correlations with other influencing factors, such as AR value, prevailing wind speed and direction and then to optimize urban planning to improve the micro-environment in street canyons, (b) analyzed to directly correlate with natural ventilation performance of nearby buildings, and (c) generalized to provide accurate boundary conditions for further CFD analysis of optimal envelope design to adapt urban environment.",

They imply that careful envelope designs can increase the adaptation of buildings to the urban environment and improve natural ventilation performance in terms of increasing ventilation rate and extending its operational time. However, due to the uniqueness of envelope and surrounding characteristics of a specific building in urban areas and the inconstant wind condition, these previous studies are very hard to provide a general conclusion that is applicable to other scenarios. This is the essential reason why (a) different previous studies (Section 3.1.1) reported different percentage decrease of ventilation rate caused by the presence of surrounding buildings and (b) some studies reported well acceptable ACH values but others insufficient (Section 3.1.2). In addition, the influence of environmental parameters, such as wind direction [164, 165] , on indoor ACH in urban buildings are still unclear. Such knowledge is essential to guiding urban planning and building design. In order to improve our understanding of and provide general information for naturally ventilated building design in urban areas, future studies may pay more attentions on two aspects. First, more on-site measurements of ACH value in naturally ventilated urban buildings should be conducted. Long-term and largescale measurements are very useful to obtain general knowledge of natural ventilation performance in urban buildings and to analyze influencing factors. Second, future CFD studies should include more realistic boundary conditions. However, CFD studies of naturally ventilated buildings in complex urban context is still a challenge to current computational power, as the large difference in scale between windows and urban area will involve enormous amount of grid cells.",

[18] reported that, compared with use of natural ventilation, use of mechanical ventilation with filters in residential buildings reduce I/ O ratios by 26% for submicron particles and 65% for fine particles, which substantially reduces the exposure to outdoor particles. The rationale of a hybrid ventilation system is to allow maximum use of natural ventilation, while mechanical ventilation system works only when natural ventilation cannot provide the required IEQ. Good performance of hybrid ventilation with filters and tempers in residential buildings was reported recently by Turner and Awbi [169] . In general, hybrid ventilation system is a simple, feasible, low energy solution for building design, which (a) ensures sufficient ventilation rates regardless of the magnitude of outdoor wind speeds and indoor/outdoor temperature differences, (b) reduces significantly exposure to particles when the outdoor particulate pollutants' concentration levels are unacceptable for natural ventilation, and (c) can be used in almost all situations where natural ventilation can be used. Further development on hybrid ventilation should focus on its standardized application, particularly with automatic control, in residential and school buildings.",

In addition, noise control of naturally ventilated buildings, particularly ventilation openings, is worthy of further investigations [185] . It is evident that the most efficient method to attenuate noise is to locate the building or the windows in an area of low noise levels. Within a high noise area, typical noise control methods at an window is to present barriers, such as screen, balcony and acoustic louvre [185] , and to incorporate reactive elements [186] , absorptive materials [187] and ceiling-mounted reflectors [188] .

Hybrid ventilation using mechanical ventilation with filtrations as a standby system for natural ventilation is a promising ventilation system in urban areas to ensure a minimum ventilation rate and avoid excessive penetration of outdoor pollutants.",

In order to better understand and improve IEQ in naturally ventilated urban buildings, the following recommendations are made for future studies.",

More on-site measurements should also be conducted to increase the understanding of IEQ in naturally ventilated urban buildings. Measured data should be compared to local IEQ standards and should be analyzed to summarize influencing factors. Dynamic penetration process of particulate and gaseous pollutants from the street canyons to the nearby indoor environment should be investigated to understand the penetration mechanisms and generate design guidelines. Combined analysis of flow characteristics, pollutant penetration, and noise attenuation should be conducted to optimize building envelope design to adapt street canyon microclimate.",
