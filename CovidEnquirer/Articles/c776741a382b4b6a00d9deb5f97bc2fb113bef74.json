Syndromic surveillance has received considerable investment, but little is known about how it will perform relative to routine clinical case finding for detection of an inhalational anthrax outbreak. We conducted a simulation study to compare clinical case finding with syndromic surveillance for detection of an outbreak of inhalational anthrax. After simulated release of 1 kg of anthrax spores, the proportion of outbreaks detected first by syndromic surveillance was 0.59 at a specificity of 0.9 and 0.28 at a specificity of 0.975. The mean detection benefit of syndromic surveillance was 1.0 day at a specificity of 0.9 and 0.32 days at a specificity of 0.975. When syndromic surveillance was sufficiently sensitive to detect a substantial proportion of outbreaks before clinical case finding, it generated frequent false alarms.",

However, because the perceived likelihood of a bioterrorism attack has increased, public health authorities have sought novel approaches for rapid outbreak detection. One approach that has received considerable economic investment over the past 5 years is syndromic surveillance. This approach follows prediagnostic data sources in an attempt to detect an increase in the prevalence of nonspecific symptoms. For example, the BioSense system (4), developed by the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) at a cost of >$75 million (5) , follows records of outpatient visits, pharmaceutical prescriptions, and laboratory orders in an attempt to detect disease outbreaks rapidly. Hundreds of similar systems are maintained or are under development by various groups around the world (6) . Other examples include systems operated by the Department of Homeland Security (5) and academic centers in partnership with state or county public health departments (7) (8) (9) .",

Nevertheless, a major justification for these systems is outbreak detection. Despite substantial investment in syndromic surveillance and calls for further research from groups such as the Institute of Medicine (3), little evidence exists to suggest how syndromic surveillance will perform relative to clinical case finding for detection of an inhalational anthrax outbreak (10) . The reason for this lack of evidence is that data from real outbreaks are not available to evaluate the performance of syndromic surveillance alone or in comparison to clinical case finding. Moreover, even if data were available from a large-scale outbreak, those data would allow only an evaluation of performance in 1 specific setting. CDC recently endorsed the use of simulated outbreaks to address the dearth of outbreak data (11) , but existing simulation studies have not compared detection through clinical case finding with syndromic surveillance (12) (13) (14) . Our aim was to develop a model for simulating use of healthcare services after a large-scale exposure to aerosol anthrax spores and then to use this model to estimate the detection benefit of syndromic surveillance compared with clinical case finding.",

Using the simulation model, we generated outbreak signals and time until the first clinical diagnosis for 3 amounts of spores released. To incorporate into the model the uncertainty in parameter values, we used a Latin hypercube sampling design, which allows many parameter values to vary simultaneously (15) . The 3,000 simulated signals generated with this sampling strategy were superimposed in turn onto baseline administrative records of ambulatory healthcare visits in the Norfolk, Virginia, area. These records are generated daily and similar types of records are used widely for syndromic surveillance (4, 7, 9) . We assessed the usefulness of syndromic surveillance by modeling the healthcare system use that would occur after an anthrax attack and superimposing this use onto actual administrative data over 1-year period. Finally, we assessed, over a range of specificity, the sensitivity and timeliness of syndromic surveillance and the detection benefit of syndromic surveillance compared with clinical case finding for each simulated outbreak. We summarize our methods in the remainder of this section and refer readers to the online Technical Appendix (available from http://www.cdc.gov/ ncidod/EID/vol12no12/06-0331_app.htm) for additional details.",

Each infected person began in the incubation state and then progressed through the prodromal state and the fulminant state. The time in each state was sampled from a log normal distribution. The healthcare use model uses a semi-Markov process to simulate the probability and timing of a symptomatic person seeking care and submission of blood for culture and culture results when care is sought. For persons in the prodromal or fulminant state of disease who sought care, the instantaneous probability of seeking care increased linearly over the duration of the state. For patients whose blood samples were cultured, the testing process was modeled as the transition through 2 discrete states: growth and isolation. The time spent in each of these states was modeled by using an exponential distribution. ",

We also computed the detection benefit of syndromic surveillance relative to clinical case finding, and the proportion of runs with a detection benefit >0. Detection benefit is the potential time saved in detection from using syndromic surveillance compared with clinical case finding. The benefit is calculated as the difference in the timeliness between syndromic surveillance and clinical case finding in those simulations in which detection occurred first by syndromic surveillance. When an outbreak was not detected by syndromic surveillance, the detection benefit was 0. For a given release scenario, each of the 1,000 simulations integrated both randomness in the component model outputs as well as uncertainty in component model parameters. Each of the 1,000 simulations is a sample from the integrated distribution of possible outcomes. To indicate the spread of the integrated uncertainty distribution, we calculated the upper and lower deciles from the 1,000 simulations.

Our results suggest that syndromic surveillance could detect an inhalational anthrax outbreak before clinical case finding. However, we regularly observed a detection benefit only when syndromic surveillance operated at a specificity in the range of 0.9, which corresponds to 1 false alarm every 10 days.

In contrast, the appropriate action after a result from syndromic surveillance system is not well-defined (34) . For example, some public health departments routinely wait 1 day for a second alarm before taking action (35) . This strategy could eliminate the potential detection benefit of syndromic surveillance. Another concern is the relatively low specificity at which syndromic surveillance must operate to consistently result in a detection benefit.

The nature of our model allowed us to vary some outbreak characteristics directly (e.g., release amount) and to incorporate the uncertainty in parameter values into our final estimates of detection performance and detection benefit. Although our sampling approach did allow us to vary many parameter values simultaneously, it did not clarify how the results vary in relation to changes in the value of a single parameter. Our estimate of detection performance through syndromic surveillance is comparable to estimates observed through studies that used simulation models (12, 37) , but those studies did not allow direct comparison of detection through syndromic surveillance with detection through clinical case finding. Our estimate of the time until detection through clinical case finding is longer than the estimate used by the authors of a study aimed at modeling response strategies to an anthrax outbreak (2), but those authors did not provide a clear rationale for the value they chose. An initial presumptive diagnosis may occur earlier than the first positive blood culture result (e.g., through clinical symptoms and chest radiographs), but a decision for large-scale intervention would likely not be made until at least after the first definitive diagnosis was made.",

There are many different approaches to syndromic surveillance; e.g., different types of data and different detection algorithms. Although different approaches to surveillance might produce different results, the choice of the infectious organism is likely to have a greater effect on results. Anthrax is relatively unique among bioterrorism agents in that a routinely used diagnostic test (i.e., blood culture) will identify the organism definitively. The benefit of syndromic surveillance relative to clinical case finding may therefore be greater for outbreaks caused by other organisms, and an anthrax outbreak may be a worst-case scenario for syndromic surveillance.",
