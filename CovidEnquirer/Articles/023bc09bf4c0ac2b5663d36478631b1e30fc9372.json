Similarly, the risk of dystocia increases, neonatal mortality increases, and litter size decreases with increasing maternal age. Average litter size is known for most purebred breeds, with average neonatal losses approaching 30%.",

A complete physical examination should include a rectal examination to evaluate the bony pelvis and a digital vaginal examination to detect any vaginal abnormalities. Brucella canis serology using the rapid-slide agglutination test should be done. An in-house test is available (D-Tec CB, Synbiotics; www.synbiotics. com); this test has high sensitivity and low specificity. Any positive result requires additional testing and should cause a delay in breeding during the cycle in which test results are confirmed. Regardless of previous breeding history, all bitches should be evaluated because the disease is spread orally, as well as venereally. Serologic testing for canine herpes virus should be performed on virgin bitches or in Prenatal care for bitches and queens should begin with the selection of the most desirable members of a potential breeding population. The resources of the important registration bodies and the available databases for evaluation of inherited genetic diseases should be used to select desirable traits. Information is available from the American Kennel Club (AKC), the Cat Fanciers' Association, the United Kennel Club, and many individual breed clubs. The most significant health database is maintained by the Orthopedic Foundation for Animals (OFA). The OFA is a private nonprofit foundation that serves as a central source of information for breeders and owners based on the standards for evaluation established by the experts in each discipline. The Canine Health Information Center (CHIC) is a joint venture of the OFA and the AKC Canine Health Foundation. The focus of CHIC is health consciousness; this focus allows breeders to manage breed-specific genetic disorders. The criteria for acceptance into the CHIC program are established by each of the parent clubs that are involved. Participation in any health database is voluntary but should be encouraged by practitioners (Box 1-1).",

The vaginal culture should be interpreted within the context of patient history, physical examination findings, and vaginal cytology. Both B. canis and Salmonella sp. are always considered pathogens. B. canis is rarely treated in any kennel or colony situation. In kennel situations, B. canis is managed in a test and cull manner because it is highly contagious and nearly impossible to eradicate with therapy.

When presented, the queen should have a complete physical examination, including baseline laboratory work, and a fecal examination should be performed. Serology for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) should be obtained. Only queens testing negative for these two viruses should be used for breeding. Neonatal isoerythrolysis occurs in purebred cats. This condition may be avoided by blood typing the queen and breeding to a tom of an appropriate blood type (Box 1-2). The blood types of domestic felids are A, B, and AB. The breeds with the highest frequency of type B blood are the British Shorthair, the Devon Rex, and the Cornish Rex. Cats are unusual in that unlike dogs, they have naturally occurring antibodies to other blood types. The A allele (A) is dominant to the B (B) allele so only the cats with homozygous recessive condition (BB) express the type B antigen on their erythrocytes. Type A cats are either homozygous AA or heterozygous AB. The AB blood type is rare and inherited separately as a third allele recessive to A and co-dominant with B. Feline neonatal isoerythrolysis occurs when maternal anti-A alloantibody gains access to the fetal circulation after colostrum ingestion and destroys type A and type AB erythrocytes. Type A and type AB kittens from a type B queen bred to a type A or AB tom are at risk. Specifics pertaining to the clinical manifestations of the disease in neonates are discussed in Chapter 2.",

The corpora lutea remains functional throughout pregnancy and regresses after delivery. The queen typically has a progesterone level of 1.0 to 1.6 ng/ml at day 60 of pregnancy. Thus pregnancy likely involves pregnancy-specific secretion of luteotrophic hormones of placental or pituitary origin. Several studies indicate that prolactin is a major luteotrophic factor in pregnant queens after implantation has occurred. Hypoluteoidism has not been reported in the queen.

The first period is preimplantation (pregastrulation), which occurs from fertilization to implantation. The second is the embryonic period, which is when organogenesis occurs, and is an important period when birth defects develop. The third is the fetal period, which roughly encompasses the last 3 weeks of pregnancy, during which growth and maturation of organ systems occur. Serious insult during the preimplantation phase may result in an all-or-none phenomenon in which implantation does not occur or the cells survive and continue development. Most serious defects occur during the embryonic period (days 22 to 44 from the LH surge) in the dog.

Progesterone levels, however, can be used to confirm ovulation failure. In the queen, progesterone levels may be used 40 days after breeding to differentiate pseudopregnancy from pregnancy. In the pseudopregnant queen, progesterone declines to baseline levels by day 40 after breeding but remains at 1 ng/ml or above in pregnant queens. Prolactin levels increase in both the pregnant bitch and the pregnant queen; however, a commercial test is not available. Relaxin is the only reported hormone that is pregnancy-specific in carnivores and is produced by the fetoplacental unit. Relaxin is best measured by radioimmunoassay or enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) techniques. An in-clinic test (ReproCHEK, Synbiotics; www.synbiotics.com) has been developed but is not as reliable as ultrasonography. At this visit, the physical examination should be repeated. The body condition of the bitch or queen should be assessed, and recommendations made for adjustments as needed. If the bitch or queen has previously been on a maintenance diet, she should be switched to a ration suitable for pregnancy and lactation. In cases where the bitch or queen is underweight and anorectic, a balanced multivitamin, such as Pet-Tabs, should be considered. There are hematologic changes throughout pregnancy, and both the bitch and the queen will experience a gradual decline in hematocrit associated with increased plasma volume (Tables 1-6 and 1-7) . Pregnancy may be accompanied by toxemia in bitches carrying large litters. Ketosis can develop in bitches not meeting the nutritional demands of pregnancy, and a negative energy balance can develop. Anorexia in late pregnancy must be corrected by force feeding or parenteral nutrition.",

Radiography will also allow the assessment of the fetal skeleton for signs of fetal death (i.e., collapse of the fetal skeleton or gas within the uterus). Radiography does not truly assess the presentation of the fetus because of the mobility of the uterine horns. Ultrasonography is a better diagnostic tool for the assessment of fetal health since it allows examination of the fetal heart rate, the amount of allantoic fluid, fetal movement, and some fetal abnormalities such as abdominal wall defects (Figure 1-7) . Fetal heart rates that are below 130 beats per minute indicate poor puppy viability, and the pregnancy requires intensive monitoring. Normal fetal heart rates at term are often greater than 200 beats per minute.",

This is a good time to exercise the mother to allow her to urinate and defecate. In the second stage, uterine contractions and expulsion of the puppies begin. Usually, a small greenish sac of fluid protrudes from the vulva, followed by the puppy and its attached placenta. The normal presentation of the puppy is nose first, stomach down (\"diving\" position). About one-third of all puppies, however, are born hindquarters first. This presentation is considered normal in the dog. After delivery, the mother opens the sac, cleans off the pup, and severs the umbilical cord. You may have to perform these functions for the mother (see Obstetric Care). Make sure the sac is removed from the puppy immediately if it is unbroken during delivery. The third stage of labor is the resting stage, which follows delivery of each puppy. Mild contractions and delivery of the afterbirth occur in this phase.
