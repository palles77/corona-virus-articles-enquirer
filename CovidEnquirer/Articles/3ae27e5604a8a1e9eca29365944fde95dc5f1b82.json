A cat presenting with signs of cystitis only receives antibiotics if warranted by a urinalysis. Using thorough diagnostic protocols to select appropriate medicines often leaves simpler effective treatment lacking for relatively common maladies. Relapses of a condition after discontinuing medication can be concerning. Diarrhea might respond quickly to a bland diet and kaolin and then relapse needing more extended treatment. With time, the returning condition may require strong medicines (with significant potential side effects) to achieve what 3 days of a bland diet had initially achieved. Even with proper treatment, sign severity often progresses from very mild to severe over time. We can often predict the pattern of progression without effectively averting it. The only choice seems to sequentially apply increased suppression to the signs. The temptation arises to apply the big guns to the first outbreak of mild imbalance. This practice often extends the time until the signs return. However, when they do recur, their severity may increase more rapidly.",

A cat that often vomits, has a greasy coat with pruritus, is anxious with a tendency to become irritable, and presents for sterile cystitis no longer has 3 to 4 separate conditions. Improvement of each sign that is being treated is assessed but not as if separate from the others or the overall wellbeing of the patient. Signs are clues to the big picture of patient's basic imbalance or weakness. Their expression is related to one another as is their treatment.

Disorders are grouped based on which organs are affected as well as the nature of the affection. Some practitioners are confused by the English translation of descriptive terms used in categorization. Some disregard the modality as valid because of its attempt to acknowledge conundrums and alternating states, whereas others find this one of its biggest strengths. Recognizing that terminology is merely an attempt to describe what is routinely seen clinically is exceedingly helpful. Reading a TCM colleague's diagnosis of toxic heat may sound exceedingly foreign; but when viewed as a description of the functional disturbances occurring within the body, this can be more readily understood. This label would be appropriate in conditions such as food poisoning or upper respiratory infections. It is an acknowledgment that the condition is creating increased heat in the body (as we know inflammation/infection does). It is also recognizing that the level of toxins in the body is high. We recognize that inflammation creates toxins; we can see toxic Pesch neutrophils on a complete blood count, and we can identify toxins caused or released by pathogenic organisms.",

He wrote a standard chemistry text and translated many medical texts. While translating a text, he noted that the effectiveness of cinchona in the treatment of malaria was attributed to its bitter and astringent qualities. He questioned this assessment recognizing that other bitter and astringent substances had no effect on malaria. Curious as to its action, he took cinchona and developed symptoms similar to that of malaria, which subsided when the herb was discontinued. This experience led him to hypothesize that it was instead the fact that the herb stimulated a similar reaction as the disease that catalyzed improvement in patients with malaria. [4] [5] [6] He performed extensive clinical trials administering substances to healthy individuals and recording the symptoms that were repeatedly induced. He used this information along with the known effects of the substances (ie, primary effects and side effects of medications) to select medicines. By administering medicine known to cause a particular set of symptoms to patients suffering from similar ailments, he found this form of treatment to be effective.",

For example, a kitten with a herpes virus infection causing thick yellow oculonasal discharge and sneezing requires a different prescription than one with increased thirst, corneal ulceration, and clear oculonasal discharge that irritates the tissues it contacts.

Many laypersons as well as practitioners will use the term homeopathy to describe any use of substances that have been prepared homeopathically. Homeopathic preparation of substances involves extended vigorous agitation and succussion of the substance, which causes repeated molecular collisions, changing their electromagnetic dynamics. When Hahnemann coined the termed homeopathy, he meant it to describe the method of treatment using medicines that induced signs similar to the disease as described previously. Late in his career, Hahnemann developed the homeopathic preparation of substances and then focused his clinical trials on their use; his earlier clinical trials using homeopathy involved substances common to medical practice of the time, which would have been prepared conventionally. Hahnemann used the term allopathy to describe the use of medicines whose effects do not match patients' symptoms. Because of the confusion created by practitioners describing widely varying techniques as homeopathy, many people now use the term classical homeopathy to denote the original definition given to homeopathy.",

Range-of-motion palpation of all joints is performed to determine the location of hypomobile and/or hypermobile joints. There are a wide variety of chiropractic techniques available to restore normal range of motion in patients. A modified Gonstead technique is likely the most commonly used in animals. This technique involves the application of a low-impact, high-velocity thrust at a specific contact point in a specific line of drive to gently increase the range of motion to hypomobile areas. In spinal areas, the restoration of range of motion has secondary effects, including improved nerve conduction, improved nutrient delivery to intervertebral disks, and increased toxin clearance from tissues.",

In the case of infectious and parasitic gastroenteritis, treatment addresses the imbalance leading to susceptibility. In the case of dietary sensitivity, it addresses the abnormal immune function; in indiscretions, it addresses the abnormal hunger that led to the unhealthy consumption. It is important to evaluate the location most affected in a given individual in order to identify organs that exhibit deficiencies.

Parvovirus type 1 is considered pathogenic in puppies under 6 weeks old. 9,10 Parvovirus type 2 and distemper virus are more commonly seen in puppies 6 weeks and older. In kittens common viruses associated with vomiting and diarrhea are feline panleukopenia, feline infectious peritonitis, feline leukemia virus, and feline immunodeficiency virus. 7, 8 As morbidity for all viral diseases is less than 100%, individuals must be susceptible to an organism to develop signs. Healthy individuals with proper nourishment and husbandry born to a healthy immune dam or queen have lower susceptibility to these viruses. Thorough history taking regarding the previous health of the patient, health of the patient's mother, husbandry, health of littermates, and nursing/dietary intake will help to identify individuals at higher risk. Appropriately timed vaccination of healthy individuals will help to reduce the risk to severe lifethreatening signs. It stands to reason that patients with susceptibility to a given virus would have increased susceptibility to the virus introduced in an altered form (vaccine). In these patients, acute manifestation of pathogenic infection may be avoided via vaccination; however, care should be taken to monitor for and treat any subacute signs correlated with vaccination, such as otitis, ocular discharge, skin eruptions, vomiting, or diarrhea.",
