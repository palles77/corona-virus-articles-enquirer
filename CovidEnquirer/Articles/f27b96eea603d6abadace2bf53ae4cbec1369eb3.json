Primers and probes were designed to detect specific sequences on the most conserved regions of the S segment. The limit of detection of the assay was 10 copies per reaction which is an improvement of 3 log 10 FFU/mL over the sensitivity of conventional RT-PCR. The specificity of the primers and probe was confirmed with the closely related Nairoviruses CCHFV and Hazara virus, and on the non-related viruses Coronavirus and Influenza A virus. This qRT-PCR assay was used to screen nucleic acids extracted from 498 ticks collected in the Republic of Chad. One sample was found positive suggesting that DUGV is present in this part of the world. The molecular assay developed in this study is sensitive, specific and rapid and can be used for research and epidemiological studies.",

Frequently detected in tick-borne virus surveys in Africa (Guilherme et al., 1996) , DUGV is a tri-segmented single-stranded negative RNA enveloped virus and is considered endemic in arid regions (Burt et al., 1996) . DUGV is also one of the most common tick-borne viruses found throughout Africa (David-West and Porterfield, 1974) . For example, a study in Kenya documented frequent isolation of DUGV from ticks infesting market livestock (Sang et al., 2006) . Among the 7 serogroups characterized in the Nairovirus genus (Elliott et al., 2000) , DUGV belongs to the Nairobi sheep disease group which includes the Nairobi sheep disease virus, pathogenic to sheep and goats (Davies, 1997) and Kupe virus, the most closely related virus (Crabtree et al., 2009) . The genetically and serologically related Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) group, which also includes Hazara virus (Begum et al., 1970) , is the other group of importance because of the very high pathogenicity of CCHF virus in humans, leading to fatal hemorrhagic disease in 30% of patients (Swanepoel et al., 1987) . In contrast, the pathogenicity of DUGV is relatively low in humans -a thrombocytopenia case was once described (Burt et al., 1996) -but in newborn mice the virus is neuroinvasive and lethal (Boyd et al., 2006) .",

Briefly, cells were incubated for 1 h at +37 \u2022 C, 5% CO 2 in the presence of the initial virus inoculum at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0,1 in DMEM medium without FCS. Medium containing 5% of FCS was then added and cells were maintained for 3 days. Absence of mycoplasma was confirmed using the Mycoalert kit (Lonza, Verviers, Belgium).",

Thus, the detection of DUGV in field samples of arthropods and animal sera is needed to provide greater understanding of the virus epidemiology. Also, as described for other arboviruses, a rapid, specific and sensitive test is necessary for effective surveillance of new DUGV circulating strains. Currently DUGV identification is based on virus isolation. However, a conventional RT-PCR (Ward et al., 1990) and ELISAs (Burt et al., 1996; Ward et al., 1992) have also been described for specific detection of DUGV in samples. To date, RNA DUGV quantification is not available; therefore a qRT-PCR assay would be useful. The specificity of the assay was also important to discriminate the closely related DUGV, Hazara virus and CCHFV. Nevertheless, since Kupe virus was not sought, a genomic amplification of Kupe virus cannot be excluded. The 16 out of 62 nucleotide differences displayed when the primers and probe were aligned with the Kupe virus sequence suggested that they are not specific for Kupe virus. Of note the nucleotide difference was 18 out of 62 for both Hazara and CCHFV.",
