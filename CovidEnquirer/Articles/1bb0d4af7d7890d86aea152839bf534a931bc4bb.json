It is critical to examine the drivers of MBR applications in China, which can provide sound scientific basis for future development of MBR applications. This study summarized the historical development of MBR applications and analyzed the driving forces by survey, literature review and interviews with MBR suppliers. The results showed that: (1) technical advantages of MBR and public policy related to water resources and environment promoted MBR beyond lab and pilot test into wide commercial applications in China; (2) petrochemical industry needs for wastewater treatment and reuse promoted medium-scale MBRs as public policy and regulation on water resources and environment tightens; (3) when the breakthrough of capacity of a single project above 10 thousand m 3 /d, the Green Olympic Games and Asian Games and tightening effluent regulations in environmentally sensitive areas incentivized MBR applications; and (4) the emergence of 100,000 m 3 /d MBR was mainly stimulated by water resources stress. Water resources stress and public policy related on resources and the environment are the primary driving forces in the last several decades. The future drivers of MBR applications in China appear to be decreasing operation cost.",

In 1999, the first pilot scale membrane bioreactor (MBR) application in China was tested, which was used to treat industrial wastewater with a scale of only 10 m 3 /d (Zheng et al., 2003) . Since then, MBR research and applications in China have been growing dramatically in that the first MRB application with the treatment capacity of 100,000 m 3 /d was commissioned within 8 years in Beijing Huang et al., 2010; Abass et al., 2015) . The total capacity of large-scale MBRs (\u226510,000 m 3 /d) reached 1.7 \u00d7 10 6 m 3 /d in 2010 (Fig. 1) . Both the capacity and number of MBR applications increased rapidly. A national survey of membrane manufacturers and operators was conducted to characterize MBR applications in China. Based on the survey, the number of large-scale MBRs in China approached 192, with the total capacity exceeding 11.17 \u00d7 10 6 m 3 /d by 2017. Taking the under-construction projects into account, the number of largescale MBRs is expected to approach 210 with the total capacity exceeding 14.04 \u00d7 10 6 m 3 /d by 2018. The MBR applications with a capacity of 50,000 m 3 /d or more are shown in Appendix A.",

The scientific and technical perspectives of MBR have received much attention in literature and engineering operations of MBR applications have also been investigated extensively in China (Wang et al., 2013; Liu et al., 2010; Zheng and Liu, 2006; Sun et al., 2014; Shen et al., 2012; Zheng and Liu, 2007; Zheng et al., 2005; Lv et al., 2006) . A number of membrane materials and modules, such as hollow fiber membranes, flat-sheet membranes, tubular membranes, have been employed in municipal and industrial wastewater treatment facilities in China since the 2000s (Huang et al., 2010; Abass et al., 2015; Zhu et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2008; Zhao et al., 2014; Yu et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2008) . The various anaerobic-anoxic-aerobic MBR (AAO-MBR) processes for municipal wastewater treatment have been extensively investigated and denitrification on these occasions was enhanced since the 2010s, such as Hefei Tangxihe WWTP and Wuxi Chengbei WWTP .",

In the last two decades, many historic events occurred in addition to the unprecedented longterm economic growth. In 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), a contagious and sometimes fatal respiratory illness, occurred in China, which highlighted the importance of public health management and drew the attention of government and public into sanitary safety (Sun and Gu, 2007) . The Olympic Games in 2008 were held in Beijing and the Asian Games in 2010 took place in Guangzhou. Both events were aimed to be green games to improve the environment and promote the games (Zheng et al., 2016) . In 2014, the South-to-North Water Transfer (SNWTP) project started transport water to northern China to relieve water resources stress in North China (Zheng et al., 2016) . The SNWTP project is a mega-project and has far-reaching impact on social economic and environment. Are these historic events related to the rapid growth of MBR applications?",

In 1989, Yamamoto invented submerged MBR and removed the circulating pump which greatly reduced energy consumption (Yamamoto et al., 1989) . By the early 1990s, Zenon introduced a series of immersed hollow fiber membrane modules (Urbain et al., 1996) . Over this period, Kubota also developed flat-sheet membrane products with improved overall energy efficiency, introducing a double-decker design in 2003. The energy consumption for sidestream systems is usually one or two orders of magnitude higher than that of submerged systems, regardless of whether the system is used for municipal or industrial wastewater treatments (Gander et al., 2000) . Generally, the external configuration provides more direct hydrodynamic control of fouling and offers the advantages of easier membrane replacement and high fluxes at the expense of high energy consumption (of the order 10 kWh\u00b7m \u22123 ) (Le-Clech et al., 2006) . Several distinct advantages of submerged configuration are their much lower energy consumption, only 0.6-2 kWh\u00b7m \u22123 , which is only 10 to 20% of sidestream MBR (Lin et al., 2012) . The invention of submerged MBR remarkably improved MBR efficiency and promote applications of MBR worldwide. The research in China has improved membrane flux capacity from 8 to 12 L/m 2 /h to about 15-25 L/m 2 /h as well.",

In 1990, Li (1990) firstly published a review of MBR and introduced MBR to China (Li, 1990) . Fan et al. (1998) later used MBR to treat petrochemical wastewater. In 1999, Zheng et al. (2003) conducted a pilot test of MBR to treat textile wastewater and laid a foundation for the commercial applications of MBR in China (Zheng et al., 2003) . The study of sidestream MBRs was dominant before 2001 while submerged MBRs were more popular since 2001 because of its lower operational cost. Since 2003, a modified sidestream MBR (also called as airlift external circulation MBR), replacing the recirculation pump by H-type recycling pipe, has been well studied for the treatment of toilet wastewater and municipal wastewater (Fan et al., 2006; Li et al., 2007; Fan et al., 2005) . Another innovative submerged anaerobic membrane bioreactor (SAMBR) was developed in 2004. The membrane fouling was controlled by recirculating the biogas and inducing the mixed liquor turbulence (Wang et al., 2008) . Since 2004, many efforts have been dedicated to the study of this SAMBR for the treatment of high-strength alcoholdistillery wastewater. In order for broader applications of MBR, selfforming dynamic membrane bioreactor (SFDMBR), a process even without manufactured membrane, has been proposed, with cheap coarse pore-sized materials such as Dacron mesh, stainless steel mesh, glass fiber, nonwovens, etc., employed as filtration media (Fan and Huang, 2002; Wu et al., 2005; Chu et al., 2008; Yuan et al., 2010) . In general, among these studies submerged MBRs were mostly utilized for municipal wastewater treatment while the sidestream MBRs were commonly applied for particular industrial wastewater treatment. The objectives of research on MBR may lie in two aspects: utilization and optimization. Research on the utilization of MBR includes the exploration of new functions, pragmatization, scaling up and operation maintenance. The optimization aims at higher operational efficiency better performance for target pollutants removal, lower constructional and operational cost and lower energy consumption during operation. While the scientific research and studies in China are progressing continuously, the much more prominent phenomenon since commercial applications of MBR started in China is the remarkably growth in a short period. The summary of the MBR applications history is presented in the following section.",

Although MBR systems did not gain wide attention in North America, it was considerably successful in Japan in the 1970s and 1980s. In 1991, the first large-scale sidestream MBR system for treating industrial wastewater was constructed in North America at the GM Mansfield plant (Judd, 2012) . Following this development, numerous MBR systems for treating industrial wastewater were installed in the United States and Canada. From the late 1980s to early 1990s, the government incentivized water recycling program prompted pioneering work by Yamamoto to develop an immersed MBR process in Japan. By 1996, 60 immersed flat-sheet MBR plants had been installed in Japan providing a total capacity of 5500 m 3 /d (Zheng et al., 2016; Judd, 2012) .",

The petrochemical industry and green Olympic Games were also derived from water environmental and resources stresses. Timing of the forcing is critical as well. Public policy, water environmental stress and water resources stress is the general forcing which continuously impact MBR applications and will continue to be the driving forces. It should be noted advantage of MBR has been discussed in previous section. It also interacts with every other driving force to affect MBR applications and thus is not discussed separately. The public health concerns caused by the SARS event in 2003 warranted better treatment of hospital wastewater which was a potential field for commercial MBR applications. The petrochemical industry need and green Olympic Games each increased the MBR application capacity by roughly a magnitude. Public policy, water environment and water resources stress drive the magnitude of MBR applications up to one more magnitude. The five driving forces are discussed in detail in this section, sequentially. which promote environment protection and resources conservation practices. Appendix A provides a list of national plans and policies that has promoted MBR applications in the last decade. According to the Water Pollution Prevention and Control Plan, the wastewater reclamation rate in China should reach 20% by 2020, which provided a great opportunity for MBR technology to be widely used in the upgrading WWTPs due to MBR's distinct technical advantages of high treatment efficiency (Zheng et al., 2016) . Additionally, the development of membrane materials has been outlined in the 12th National Five-Year Plan (2011 to 2015), such as Strategy of Accelerating Cultivation and Development of Emerging Strategic Industries, from both aspects of environmental protection and technological development. These national policies provided enormous opportunity for MBR applications (Huang et al., 2010; Abass et al., 2015; Xiao et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2013) . In general, public policy in China increase the demand on MBR application as it often Table 1 Representative MBR applications in hospitals promotes wastewater treatment and reclamation. Public policy also promotes the supply of MBR as it incentivizes the development of MBR technology and applications. The SARS event increased public awareness of public health concern and lead Chinese government to tighten regulation on hospital sewage which contains many pathogens such as bacteria, viruses, etc. . Therefore, the demand on advanced technology to treat hospital sewage is increasing. In addition, as large hospitals in China are often located in the city centers, where land prices and office rentals are prohibitively high, the ideal hospital sewage treatment systems should use minimal land and space. Generally, hospital wastewater is treated with primary treatment and disinfection process (often by chlorine, ozone and ultraviolet light) and infectious hospitals must use secondary treatment . MBR is an efficient technology in removing pathogenic microorganism. Its low SS of effluent is helpful to improve the efficiency of disinfection processes, minimize disinfectant, and reduce disinfection by-products (Zheng and Liu, 2007; Zheng et al., 2005) . It improves disinfection effects and reduces the toxicity of effluent. In addition, it does not require secondary sedimentation tank and thus reduce land and space usage for wastewater treatment, which made it an ideal potential technology for treating hospital wastewater (Lv et al., 2006) . The SARS event promoted MBR applications for treating hospital wastewater (Zheng et al., 2016) . Table 1 demonstrates some typical MBR applications for treating hospital wastewater. It is noted that MBR treatment capacity for hospital wastewater is a small portion of those for industrial wastewater.",

To make it worse, N60% of the Sinopec subordinate enterprises are in regions with serious water shortage issues (Zheng et al., 2016) . Therefore, the water resources stress and wastewater discharge stress are pressing for the petrochemical industry.",

MBR process becomes more and more attractive for municipal/domestic wastewater treatment when a compact technology is required due to a lack of space or the high cost of additional land in urban areas. The average footprint areas of a MBR municipal WWTP (with a capacity of 50,000-200,000 m 3 /d) are 0.4-0.6 m 2 \u00b7m \u22123 \u00b7d \u22121 , respectively.

Land price in many Chinese cities is as high as 1500 RMB/m 2 nowadays. When cost for land is considered, the MBR invent will closer to that of conventional WWTPs. The available locations for new WWTPs in big cities are extremely limited because drainage systems are often completed and could not be changed easily. In this situation, MBR has an advantage over conventional WWTPs as MBR need less space and has small footprint. From Table 6 , the average footprint of MBR municipal WWTPs is 0.9 m 2 \u00b7m \u22123 \u00b7d \u22121 , less than that of conventional municipal WWTPs. In addition, underground MBR WWTPs have been constructed with the total investment of 3000-6000 RMB/m 3 to save space and reduce environmental impact in big cities (Cao et al., 2012) . Table 7 shows are representative underground MBR WWTPs. When land prices in big cities are considered, MBR applications may be preferred in big cities.

The high energy consumption of MBR plants is due to membrane fouling and clogging and high DO concentrations for a large amount of biomass. Energy cost of aeration plays a key role in the total energy consumption in MBR processes. Optimization of aeration is consequently believed as the most effective way to cut down energy requirement and eventually lower operating cost. Energy consumption was reduced in China by elevating the aeration efficiency for membrane scouring by bettering the configuration of membrane module, aeration system, and tank geometry. Much of the MBR plants development over the past 12 years has focused on maximizing the mixing imparted by membrane air scouring while minimizing the amount of air required for this, resulting in significant improvements in energy efficiency. According to some surveys, the energy consumptive could be as low as 0.5 kWh/m 3 for large MBR plants. Table 9 lists the specific electrical consumption of integrated/ submerged-MBR. It indicates that the specific electrical consumption of integrated/submerged-MBR ranges from 0.31 to 0.70 kWh\u00b7m \u22123 , and a little higher than that of average electrical consumption of CAS (0.34-0.38 kWh\u00b7m \u22123 ) in China.",

The Miyun WRP was commissioned in 2006 with a MBR application to treat 45,000 m 3 /d municipal wastewater. Since then, many wastewater treatment plants (WWTP) started to apply MBR to treat municipal wastewater with the capacity of 10 thousand m 3 /d or larger. The geographic distribution of MBR applications in 2010 is show inFig. 3. MBR applications in this period were mainly located in Beijing, Jiangsu, Guangdong and Hubei. By the end of 2017, there were 192 large-scale MBRs (\u226510,000 m 3 /d) applied in China, with a total capacity of 11.17 \u00d7 10 6 m 3 /d.Stage 5: the capacity of 100 thousand m 3 /d wastewater(2011-present). With the advancing engineering and technology of MBR, the capacities of MBR applications in municipal wastewater treatment dramatically increased to beyond 100 thousand m 3 /d. In 2007, the first 100 thousand m 3 /d MBR application were completed in Beijing Wenyuhe River WWTP. Since 2007, 35 MBR applications with 100 thousand m 3 /d capacity were completed in China which accounted for over a half of the 51 MBR applications worldwide with the capacity(Dong, 2017). The geographic distribution of MBR applications in 2017 is show inFig. 4. After 2010, MBR applications expanded to Southwest, Northwest and Northeast China. MBR applications with capacities of 10 thousand and 100 thousand m 3 /d were mainly used to treat municipal wastewater in China. Due to increasing land price and limited land availability in urbans, underground space is utilized to build the municipal WWTPs. For example, there are 13 underground MBR applications in China for treating municipality wastewater. The Guangzhou Jingxi WWTP (with the capacity of 100 thousand m 3 /d), Kunming No. 10 WWTP (with the capacity of 150 thousand m 3 /d), and Taiyuan Jingyan WWTP (with the capacity of 120 thousand m 3 /d) employed MBR for underground wastewater treatment facility.",
