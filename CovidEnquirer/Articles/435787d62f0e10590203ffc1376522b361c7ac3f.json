Intraoperative adverse events were recorded in eight (11%) patients in the CMSG group vs six (21%) patients in the PMSG group. No intraoperative death or open conversion occurred. In-hospital mortality rates were of 4% (n \u00bc 3) in the CMSG group and 14% in the PMSG group (n \u00bc 4). Chronic renal failure was an independent preoperative risk factor of postoperative death or complications (odds ratio, 4.88; 95% confidence interval, 1.65-14.43; P \u00bc .004). Rates of postoperative complications were 22% (n \u00bc 15) and 25% (n \u00bc 7) in the CMSG and PMSG groups. Spinal cord ischemia rates were 4% (n \u00bc 3) and 7% (n \u00bc 2) in the CMSG and PMSG groups. Reintervention rates were 16% (n \u00bc 11) in the CMSG group and 32% (n \u00bc 9) in the PMSG group. At discharge, target vessel patency rate in CMSGs was 98% (n \u00bc 207/210). All target vessels (n \u00bc 98) were patent in the PMSG group. Endoleaks at discharge were observed in 24% of the CMSG group (n \u00bc 16) vs 8% of the PMSG group (n \u00bc 2).",

However, long manufacturing delays limit their use in patients with symptomatic or large aneurysms. Alternative endovascular techniques developed to deal with these cases include off-the-shelf branched devices, 1 parallel techniques, 2,3 and physician-modified stent grafts (PMSGs). [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] PMSGs consist of operator-customized fenestrations created on a back table; the stent graft is reconstrained into the delivery system, thus allowing deployment during the same operative course. Data on PMSGs remain limited. Retrospective studies have reported encouraging short-term and midterm results, 5, 6, 8, 11 but concerns exist about the safety of the technique and long-term results. The objective of this report was to describe the intraoperative adverse events and early outcomes of CMSGs and PMSGs for CAAAs and TAAAs.",

All consecutive patients with CAAAs or TAAAs undergoing endovascular repair with custom-made fenestrated Zenith devices (Cook Medical, Bloomington, Ind) or PMSGs between January 2012 and November 2017 were included. CAAAs included juxtarenal and suprarenal aneurysms. Because PMSGs were designed on a Cook platform and fenestrated Anaconda (Vascutek/ Terumo Aortic, Inchinnan, Scotland, United Kingdom) and Ventana (Endologix, Irvine, Calif) devices were limited to juxtarenal and pararenal aneurysms, patients treated with the fenestrated Anaconda device (n \u00bc 9) or the Ventana (n \u00bc 9) during the study period were excluded. TAAAs were classified according to the modified Crawford classification. Patients were considered for open, hybrid, or endovascular repair in a multidisciplinary weekly meeting. Patients were precluded from open or hybrid repair following a series of criteria including the patient's performance status (American Society of Anesthesiologists [ASA] class and metabolic equivalent of task score) and medical history (cardiac, renal, and pulmonary status). Indications for a PMSG were painful aneurysms, rapidly enlarging >70-mm aneurysms, saccular aneurysms, type I endoleaks after previous endovascular aneurysm repair (EVAR) associated with >70-mm aneurysms, threatening intramural hematoma, and visceral patch false aneurysm after TAAA open repair. Rapidly enlarging aneurysms were defined as growth >5 mm within 6 months. All patients underwent computed tomography (CT) scan preoperatively and within 1 month after the operation. The study was in agreement with the principles of the Declaration of Helsinki, and informed consent was obtained from all patients. According to our center's local regulations and French prevailing legislation (article L1121-1, Code de Sant\u00e9 Publique), Institutional Review Board approval was not required for this retrospective study. In consenting of patients, potential risks and benefits of PMSGs and CMSGs were discussed in detail. The theoretical increased risk of infection associated with PMSGs, the lack of standardization, and the lack of midterm and long-term data were clearly explained.",

More than being related to the type of technique, this result may be explained by the fact that patients in the PMSG group were more fragile, with more extended aneurysms. Deaths and severe complications in the PMSG group occurred in compassionate cases, mostly ASA class 4 patients with emergent aneurysms and complex anatomy. Multivariable analysis showed a trend to an increased rate of MAEs in the CMSG group but without reaching statistical significance, limited by the small number of events and patients. In looking at technical outcomes such as target vessel cannulation failures, rates of target vessel loss, and persistent endoleaks at discharge, PMSGs seem to be an acceptable option for high-risk patients needing rapid treatment of emergent CAAAs or TAAAs.",

Previous series reporting more favorable outcomes mainly included elective repair of juxtarenal aneurysms. Starnes et al 11 have reported a 5.1% 30-day mortality rate in 59 patients treated for juxtarenal aneurysms. In the current series, most patients were high-risk patients with extensive or symptomatic aneurysms requiring rapid treatment. Tsilimparis et al 16 reported a series of PMSGs in high-risk patients with CAAAs or TAAAs with a 14% mortality rate, with results similar to those of our series. However, excellent results for the treatment of CAAAs and TAAAs in high-risk patients were recently reported by the teams of the Mayo Clinic and the University of Massachusetts with 30-day mortality rates, respectively, of 5.5% and 4.9%, 17, 18 reflecting the experience of high-volume centers. Indeed, the latter studies included a considerably larger number of patients compared with our series of physicianmodified devices, and their experience began, respectively, in 2007 and 2010, whereas we began in 2012, highlighting a possible learning curve effect. We reported high rates of reinterventions in the PMSG group in our study (32%), similar to those recently reported by Oderich et al 17 and Dossabhoy et al 18 (41% and 37%, respectively) but much higher than the 4.5% reported in the meta-analysis by Georgiadis et al. 19 Reinterventions seem more and more to appear in the literature as the Achilles heel of the physician-modified technique.

[21] [22] [23] [24] [25] Compared with our initial results, 26 short-term outcomes improved significantly with larger experience. Of the three deaths in the CMSG group, two occurred in our early experience in patients with shaggy aortas, which are currently considered strict contraindications to fenestrated stent grafts. In-hospital mortality and complication rates reported in the CMSG group for the treatment of TAAAs were also comparable to those previously reported in the literature. 22, [27] [28] [29] [30] With growing experience, technical adjustments for graft modifications were done to reduce the risks of cannulation problems and endoleak. For asymptomatic large aneurysms, fenestrations are created in custom-made devices, which can be provided within 5 days with specific proximal and distal diameters, with a specific level of tapering, and without proximal barbs. When a proximal thoracic component is needed, distances are calculated to obtain a minimum of three stents of overlap with the fenestrated device (60-80 mm). For symptomatic aneurysms, we now use Zenith dissection stent grafts, which can be delivered within 24 hours with straight, 4-mm tapering, or 8-mm tapering designs. Devices with 8-mm tapering were particularly useful in painful juxtarenal and suprarenal aneurysms. The two proximal stents ensured good proximal sealing, whereas the tapering on the third stent allowed adequate fenestration positioning in the visceral aorta. However, because we did not use scallops, juxtarenal aneurysms were mainly treated with four-fenestration stent grafts, which could be considered unnecessary with custom-made fenestrated devices. Graft modifications for four fenestrations took us approximately 2 hours, which is too long in the setting of ruptured unstable aneurysms. Clearly, PMSG was not a good technique for ruptures. We also found that fenestration positioning and adequate graft deployment were difficult to predict in case of posterior takeoff of renal arteries, especially in small aortic diameters, where reducing ties have the effect of pulling fenestrations even more posteriorly. We now tend to avoid fenestrations when the left and right renal ostia are positioned between 4:30 and 6:00 and between 6:00 and 7:30, respectively.",
