            "text": "Study objectives: Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a rapidly progressive disease caused by a novel coronavirus (CoV) infection. However, the disease presentation is nonspecific. The aim of this study was to define clearly the presentation, clinical progression, and laboratory data in a group of patients who had SARS. Design: Retrospective observational study. Setting: A tertiary care medical center with 51 negative-pressure isolation rooms in Taipei, Taiwan. Patients: Fifty-three patients with SARS seen between April 27 and June 16, 2003. Results: Fever (ie, temperature > 38\u00b0C) was the most common symptom (98%) and the earliest. When admitted to the isolation unit of the hospital for observation, most patients reported nonspecific symptoms associated with their fever. Only two patients with preexisting illnesses had cough on the same day the fever began. Eventually, 39 patients (74%) developed cough, beginning at a mean (\u060e SD) time of 4.5 \u060e 1.9 days after fever onset, and 35 patients (66%) had diarrhea beginning at a mean time of 6.0 \u060e 3.3 days after fever onset. Thirty-one patients (59%) had abnormal findings on chest radiographs on hospital admission, and all but 1 patient (98%) eventually developed lung infiltrates that were consistent with pneumonia. The majority of patients (63%) first developed unifocal infiltrates at a mean time of 4.5 \u060e 2.1 days after fever onset, while in 37% of patients the initial infiltrates were multifocal, appearing at a mean time of 5.8 \u060e 1.3 days after fever onset. Common laboratory findings included lymphopenia (on hospital admission, 70%; during hospitalization, 95%), thrombocytopenia (on hospital admission, 28%; during hospitalization, 40%), elevated lactate dehydrogenase (on hospital admission, 58%; during hospitalization, 88%), creatine kinase (on hospital admission, 18%; during hospitalization, 32%), and aspartate aminotransferase or alanine aminotransferase levels (on hospital admission, 27%; during hospitalization, 62%). Throat or nasopharyngeal swab for SARS-CoV by reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and real-time PCR was positive in 40 of the 47 patients (85%) in whom the test was performed. Conclusions: None of the presenting symptoms or laboratory findings are pathognomonic for SARS. Even though cough developed in a majority of patients, it did not occur until later in the disease course, suggesting that a cough preceding or concurrent with the onset of fever is less likely to indicate SARS. While PCR for SARS-CoV appears to be the best early diagnostic test currently available, it is clear that better methods are needed to differentiate between SARS and non-SARS illness on initial presentation.",

Such patients also had to be reported immediately to the public health bureau, which then instituted a quarantine for anyone who had had close contact with the patient. Since, in the early stages, we could not reliably distinguish between SARS and other forms community-acquired pneumonia, many patients who did not have SARS were caught in the wide net cast by the WHO case definition. This placed a tremendous burden on hospitals, especially if adequate isolation facilities were limited, and on the community, where compulsory quarantines severely disrupted normal activities and caused serious anxiety. 17, 18 Thus, the impact of the outbreak was not confined to the SARS victims themselves and their families. It adversely affected the community, regional health system, and econ-omy. Clearly, if SARS reappears, more precise diagnostic criteria are needed if we are to avoid a repeat of the serious health and societal consequences experienced in the recent outbreak.",

We managed 167 patients at our hospital who had either suspected or probable SARS according to the WHO case definition (revised May 1, 2003) . 10 We designed this study to define the clinical course and laboratory findings in a subset of those patients in whom we were able to confirm infection with SARS-CoV, based on either laboratory evidence of the virus or the patient's involvement in a definite chain of transmission. Our purpose was to establish a clear description of the course of the disease in a set of patients in whom other diagnoses had been excluded. 10 From among patients with both probable and suspected SARS, we selected 53 patients who had convincing evidence of SARS-CoV infection. The evidence consisted either of a positive finding for polymerase chain reaction (PCR) plus a typical clinical course or, in the absence of a positive PCR finding, a typical clinical course with a definite contact history and/or evidence that the patient transmitted the infection to someone else.",

Once the reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR test became available, either a throat or nasopharyngeal swab was obtained from patients with suspected or probable SARS for detection of SARS-CoV RNA. 4, 5 The extraction of viral RNA (TRIzol; Invitrogen; Carlsbad, CA) was performed in a laminar-flow cabinet in a biosafety level-3 laboratory. Total RNA was reverse-transcribed with random hexamers (ABgene; Epsom, Surrey, UK). The reactions contained 12.5 L buffer concentrate, 3.6 mmol/L magnesium sulfate, 0.5 L each primer, 0.5 L RT/Taq DNA polymerase mixture, and 5 L RNA in a total volume of 25 L. The complementary DNA was amplified successively with three pairs of primers, including IN-6/IN-7, Cor-p-F2/Cor-p-R1, and Cor-p-F3/Cor-p-R2. First, a 440-nucleotide segment of open reading frame 1b of the CoV polymerase gene was amplified with the broadly reactive genus-specific primer pair IN-6 (\u03e9) 5\u0408GGTTGGGACTATCCTAAGTGTGA3\u0408 and IN-7 (-) 5\u0408CCATCATCAGATAGAATCATCATA3\u0408. The amplified complementary DNA then was subjected to nested PCR using the SARS-specific primer pair Cor-p-F2 (\u03e9) 5\u0408CTAACAT-GCTTAGGATAATGG3\u0408 and Cor-p-R1 (-) 5\u0408CAGGTAAGCG-TAAAACTCATC3\u0408. The size of the nested product was 368 base pairs (bp). Drosten et al 4 reported that the number of copies of SARS-CoV RNA in the throat was much lower than that in the sputum. Therefore, in order to further improve the sensitivity of nested RT-PCR for the throat samples, we amplified the nested products with a second nested PCR using the SARS-specific primer pair Cor-p-F3 (\u03e9) 5\u0408GCCTCTCTTGTTCTTGCTCGC3\u0408 and Cor-p-R2 (-) 5\u0408CCTATTTCTATAGAGACACTC3\u0408. The size of the final product was 348 bp. Thermal cycling was performed at 95\u00b0C for 30 s, 55\u00b0C for 30 s, 72\u00b0C for 45 s, and 40 cycles of 72\u00b0C for 7 min. The specificity of the RT-PCR reaction was confirmed by sequencing the positive RT-PCR-amplified products by agarose gel electrophoretic separation. This procedure required about 6 to 8 h, and the patient had to be isolated while awaiting the results. Given the large number of people in this category, it was clear that a more rapid procedure was needed.",

Case series 17 published during the outbreak most likely included some patients with diseases other than SARS. The disease pattern we have delineated in patients with confirmed SARS will be useful for comparison with other series of patients with confirmed SARS-CoV infection. In addition, it will allow us to compare the clinical presentation of SARS with that of other febrile respiratory illnesses to determine whether there are features that are helpful in making a distinction between different entities.",

Most patients experienced minor symptoms for 1 to 2 days before that, including low-grade fever, general malaise, headache, dizziness, or loose stools. Once the fever increased, it remained high rather than resolving within a few days. All of our patients except one had fever as the initial specific manifestation of SARS except for one 10-year-old girl who was part of a family cluster. Others have also reported 7-9,23-28 fever as an early sign in almost all patients with SARS. Although it has been noted that fever may be absent in some elderly patients, 9 we did not observe this in any of our patients.",

Both had histories of cough and dyspnea, one due to COPD and the other due to congestive heart failure. All of the other patients experienced several days of high fever before developing respiratory symptoms. This suggests that, in the absence of an underlying cardiopulmonary disease, patients presenting with a cough that precedes or is concurrent with a high fever are less likely to have SARS. Pharyngitis is a symptom that is common to other CoV infections. 29 It occurred in one fourth of our patients. Other CoVs rarely have hepatic involvement, 29 but elevated liver enzyme levels were present in half our patients, although without jaundice or serious decline in liver function. Abdominal complaints, including loose stools and pain, were also common (66% of patients). However, these symptoms began only after the onset of a high fever. Fever to this degree is less common in other viral infections that cause similar symptoms. Therefore, it appears that strict isolation may not be necessary for patients who do not have fever as the first symptom of a respiratory illness, assuming that they do not have an underlying disease that causes similar respiratory symptoms.",

One of the latter had a tension pneumothorax and died of acute respiratory failure. None of our own staff died. The other hospital was the site of the first major local transmission of SARS on Taiwan. None of the seven nurses from that hospital had been wearing a complete PPE, 16, 22 in contrast to the six members of our staff who became infected. It may be that the use of protective equipment, including N95 masks, goggles, and gowns, lessened the viral load in the initial inoculum, perhaps accounting for the good outcome in our six staff members. This suggestion is further supported by the fact that four of our infected staff members had a negative PCR finding for SARS. Their clinical courses and chest radiograph findings, however, were totally consistent with SARS, and none had evidence of any other infection that could explain their illness. It is noteworthy that these four patients had experienced low-grade fevers for 1 or 2 days before the onset of high fever. Wearing full protective equipment, they continued to care for patients for that period, as they did not fulfill the criteria in use at that time for isolation. 22 (They were immediately isolated when their temperatures rose to \u03fe 38\u00b0C.) There is no evidence that they transmitted SARS to anyone else, again suggesting that the protective equipment is successful in limiting the spread of the virus.",

Once the results of antibody testing are available, we will be in a better position to assess the characteristics of PCR.
