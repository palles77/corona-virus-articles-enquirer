An culicifacies, which is sensitive to salinity beyond 12 ppm, was the only known vector species recorded in the areas, but at a low density. The species breeds in coconut, casuarina, and vegetable garden pits. 7 The tsunami has reduced the breeding potential of these habitats because of the increased salinity of the habitat waters. However, if these saline water habitats are diluted by rainwater in the future, they are likely to favour the breeding of the brackish water form of An subpictus, which tolerates a salinity range from 967-5832 ppm. 8 Screening of fever cases by the public-health department revealed that the fever rate has been low (5-8%), and among the people with fever in the relief camps or the affected villages, there were no people who tested positive for malaria. Furthermore, at present, there is no work-related movement of fishermen, and hence there is no question of importation of malaria. However, the arrival of people from other parts of the country, including malaria endemic areas, in connection with the relief and rehabilitation activities bring with it the risk of malaria importation.",

Given the long lead time to reformulate vaccines, it is now acknowledged that antiviral drugs will be our first defence to reduce the mortality-and social and medical",

The virus is even battering its way through the final barrier-passage from person to person. 6 The Director General of the WHO, Lee Jong-Wook, discussed the danger of a pandemic of a new infection such as avian influenza with the WHO executive board in January, and highlighted the need to establish emergency systems for an immediate and effective response to an international health crisis.

Research shows that the neuraminidase inhibitor (NI) antivirals are very effective against the human and avian H5N1 virus strains, while research into the composition of vaccines against H5N1 has led the USA to order 2 million doses, which will protect the population, at least in a small way, if the next pandemic stems from this strain. 5 But what about the remaining 290 million or so citizens of the USA? How will they be protected? The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in southeast Asia and the deliberate release of anthrax in the USA have shown that modern societies do not take kindly to outbreaks of infectious disease and they are prone to panic very quickly.",

There are a number of antiviral attributes that may lend some drugs to being more appropriate than others for stockpiling. For example, the M2 ion channel inhibitors (amantadine and rimantadine) and one of the NIs (oseltamivir) can be taken orally; however, the M2 inhibitors are more likely to be associated with the emergence and spread of drug-resistant influenza than oseltamivir. Thus, the WHO have highlighted the importance of selecting appropriate agent(s) for stockpiling as part of national pandemic plans. 7 In the two pandemics in 1957 and 1968, the casualties were in excess of 6 million worldwide and the virological community did very little except to observe and record. But the SARS outbreak of 2003 awakened a new aggressive spirit, underpinned with molecular science and rapid diagnostics. We would no longer wish to be the passive audience at a macabre theatre of infection; rather, infectious disease experts, mathematicians, virologists, vaccine specialists, and chemotherapists would be thrown into the fray. The confrontation with SARS was very much like a battle. Indeed, the troops on the ground-epidemiologists, nurses, and doctors-died. The WHO uncovered its new power and used it to the full-nations who failed to act were exposed and had travel restrictions applied. This measure rocked even countries with a firm economy.",

Together with a long incubation period of 10-12 days, the epidemic could be-and was-broken by quarantine. Surprisingly, a retrospective study of the 1918 influenza pandemic has suggested a low R 0 of 3-4. But influenza has another vital attribute: a very short incubation period.
