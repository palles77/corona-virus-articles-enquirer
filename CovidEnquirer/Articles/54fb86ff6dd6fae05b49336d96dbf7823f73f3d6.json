The animal studies afford clinicians data on potential toxicities and organs or organ systems that may be affected as a result of the vaccine itself, impurities or contaminants, components of the formulation or interactions thereof, or toxicities resulting from the expected immune response to the vaccine. The toxicity data are also used to define the dose that may safely be administered to humans and a no-observed-effect level, or a dose at which no toxicologically relevant findings were identified. The caveats to these studies for vaccines as well as other types of molecules are that there may be rare subpopulation toxicities that may only be addressed in humans and in general animal models may not always reflect what might be observed in humans.",

            "text": "In order to ensure that nonclinical studies supporting human clinical trials for vaccines are conducted in a robust and consistent manner across the industry it was recognized that widely accepted, comprehensive guidelines were required. Some nonclinical development guidelines, such as the European Medicines Agency (EMA) guideline approved in 1998 [1] , as well as the United States Code of Federal Regulation (US CFR) and individual countryspecific compendia that at least mention nonclinical studies specific for vaccines have been available for many years. However, the information was either of insufficient detail or more geared toward requirements for lot release or IND (Investigational New Drug) submission. Therefore, in 2002, members of academia, industry, and US and European regulatory agencies convened to discuss the drafting of the first World Health Organization (WHO) guideline for nonclinical evaluation of vaccines. The WHO guideline would be a comprehensive document providing more detail on items such as animal models, study design (dose, route III. VACCINES of administration, dosing schedule), and endpoints. In addition, it would include specific methods for the evaluation of additional components of vaccine formulations (adjuvants, excipients), vaccines administered via non-routine routes of administration and specific types of vaccines including combination vaccines. This guideline is now available and widely used throughout the industry as the gold standard for designing nonclinical vaccine programs.",

In addition to the implementation of more routine nonclinical evaluations of vaccines, programs focused on the safety of vaccines have been implemented such as the Vaccine Adverse Event Reporting System (VAERS), a post-marketing surveillance system developed in 1990 by the Centers for Disease Control (CDC) and the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) that tracks adverse events that occur after the administration of US-licensed vaccines. Vaccine manufacturers should also be aware that specific countries may have guidelines outlining their expectations for the nonclinical evaluation of vaccines that may differ significantly from the WHO, EMA, Japan and China guidelines. One example of this is India [12] where vaccines are considered as \"drugs\" in their nonclinical guidelines (Table 9 .1). As a result, the toxicology studies required for vaccines are more extensive and challenging to design compared to well-accepted vaccine-specific programs. For example, the Indian guidance requires studies to be conducted in two species using two routes of administration (e.g. intramuscular and subcutaneous), dose ranging, and the identification of a maximum tolerated dose (MTD). In contrast to small-molecule drugs, vaccines are not metabolized via P450 enzymes, so multiple species (as typically required for toxicology testing of small molecules to ensure the animal model is representative of the metabolism observed in humans) should not be needed. In addition, nonclinical immunogenicity studies are typically conducted in more than one species and this would allow for the identification of species-specific differences that would need to be evaluated from a toxicological perspective. Given that the route of administration of most vaccines is parenteral (e.g. intramuscular or subcutaneous) with the goal of inducing a depot effect where the vaccine antigens are retained at the site of injection so that they may have sufficient opportunity to interact with the immune system, a single, relevant route of administration (i.e. the anticipated clinical route) should be adequate to induce an immune response and injection site reactions should be evaluated in studies utilizing the relevant route of administration. As the mechanism of action of vaccines is well understood (i.e. induction of specific immune response to vaccine antigens), and the expected immune response in a relevant species is generally associated with transient toxicity and little if any off-target toxicity is observed, dose ranging for the purposes of identifying an MTD may be of little value. Furthermore, dose-ranging studies expected to be conducted according to the Indian guidance would require testing vaccine formulations specifically prepared for toxicology studies, instead of a formulation representative of that to be tested in the clinic. Attempting to perform dose ranging or identify an MTD may require either administering dose volumes exceeding those acceptable from an animal welfare perspective or formulating the vaccine so that it is more concentrated to allow the administration of higher doses while maintaining an acceptable dose volume. In the case of unacceptable dose volume administration, effects at the injection site will very likely be observed based on mechanical trauma alone and potentially mask any reactogenicity resulting from the vaccine itself. If the vaccine is formulated at a higher concentration, the material would no longer be representative of the clinical formulation and would make injection site reactions difficult to interpret.",

VACCINES equivalent dose (using the clinical formulation) is considered by most regulatory authorities adequate for establishing safety margins of vaccines based on differences in body weight between humans and animal models. For example, a full human dose of 0.5 mL administered to a 0.3 kg rat provides an approximate 16-fold safety margin for a 5 kg human in the case of an infant vaccine.",

Some countries (e.g. Japan, Russia) may require that thorough reviews of any available animal data even if they are not traditional nonclinical toxicity data, be included in clinical trial applications (CTAs). If this information is deemed insufficient, requests may be made to conduct routine nonclinical toxicity studies prior to the initiation of clinical studies and/or worldwide marketing application (WMA) submission to fulfill regulatory expectations outlined in the current guidelines. In light of the existing clinical data and proven safety records in humans for vaccines on the market, it is difficult to justify a retroactive conduct of nonclinical toxicology studies with such vaccines. It is important that vaccine sponsors clearly communicate reasons for the lack of toxicology data for vaccines authorized for marketing, primarily in Western countries, in the years prior to the requirements for nonclinical toxicity testing of vaccines, and emphasize the existing clinical data as the most relevant evidence of vaccine safety. Moreover, carrying out toxicology studies with vaccines that have been safety administered to millions of humans would be counter to current worldwide expectations on reductions in animal use.",

The main portion of the nonclinical toxicity studies precedes the introduction into humans during clinical trials and further studies may be conducted to support later trials as earlier trials are ongoing. These studies should be designed on a caseby-case basis but there are minimum requirements that may be applied to most vaccines. When conducting toxicity studies for a particular vaccine, vaccine type and indication must be taken into consideration when selecting the species and strain of the animals to be used, formulation to be administered, route and method by which the vaccine will be administered and number of doses and dose levels.

Although an evaluation of a dose-response and the identification of an MTD are not required, if toxicity is observed it is recommended by regulatory authorities that lower doses be evaluated. According to the WHO guideline, the number of doses administered to the test animals should be equal to or greater than the number of doses proposed in humans (typically one more dose than anticipated in the clinic is administered to the animals, i.e. \"n+1\" doses). Given that the clinical dosing interval may be quite extended (i.e. months) the frequency of dosing in animal studies may be shortened relative to that proposed for clinical trials and based on the kinetics of the immune response rather than matching the clinical dosing schedule. To this end, doses are typically administered at defined intervals of 2-3 weeks. Health authorities recommend that repeat-dose studies be conducted even in cases where the vaccine will be administered as a single dose clinically. However, single dose only studies may be justified in some cases, for example, where vaccine-induced antibodies are expected to neutralize a live virus vector, thereby limiting the expression of the protein of interest or when the immune response may affect species-specific proteins in the vaccine formulation.",

Given the importance of the immune response in establishing the relevance of the preclinical model, it is expected that information about the onset and duration of the antibody response be obtained. Guidelines indicate that these samples should be collected prior to exposure to the vaccine being studied, on the day of cesarian sectioning and at the end of the weaning period.

Repeat-dose toxicity studies in non-pregnant animals may be used for this purpose unless evidence suggests that the immune response differs in pregnant animals. As with repeat-dose toxicity studies, guidelines dictate that the route of administration mimic the clinical route, the maximal human dose should be administered and the material used should be identical to or representative of the final clinical formulation. If administration of the full human dose is not feasible, a dose that exceeds the full human dose on a mg/kg basis and elicits an immune response should be used.

Therefore, the primary focus is on the detection of adverse effects on the pregnant/lactating female and development of the embryo/ fetus and the offspring following exposure of the pregnant female to the vaccine from implantation through the end of pregnancy. Animals are routinely exposed to the vaccine in the pre-mating stage and during the period from implantation until closure of the hard palate and end of gestation to evaluate effects on organogenesis (Stages C, D, E per ICH S5(R2) [24] . Pre-mating and booster dose administration as needed ensure exposure of the embryo or fetus to the vaccine-induced immune response as well as components of the vaccine formulation. Postnatal follow-up from birth to weaning is recommended to evaluate normality of growth, body weight gain, suckling activity, and viability. To this end, one subgroup of females is subjected to cesarian section to allow uterine and fetal examinations and a second subgroup is allowed to litter with postnatal follow-up of the offspring. A sufficient number of animals is used to allow an evaluation of at least 40 animals per group with an allocation of 20 animals each to the cesarian and littering subgroups. Control groups such as PBS or others designed to evaluate certain aspects of the formulation such as adjuvants or excipients are included. Guidelines indicate that typical endpoints providing data on prenatal and postnatal development including maternal functions such as those described in ICH S5(R2) [24] should be included. Routine toxicity endpoints evaluated include clinical observations including data on general appearance and body weights, local tolerance, and food consumption as well as study-specific endpoints such as duration of pregnancy, abortions, premature deliveries, and parturition. In the cesarian section group, maternal observations include a necropsy for macroscopic evaluation as well as recording the number and distribution of corpora lutea, implantation sites, viable and nonviable fetuses, and early and late resorptions as well as a gross evaluation of the placenta. Fetal examinations in the cesarian group include body weights of live fetuses and an evaluation of viable fetuses for gross external, visceral, and skeletal alterations. To the extent possible, late resorptions and nonviable fetuses are also examined for gross external alterations. The gender of all fetuses is determined via internal evaluation. Maternal observations in the natural delivery group include a determination of the duration of gestation and parameters such as the fertility, gestation, and live birth indices. Following the pre-weaning period, dams are sacrificed so that a gross necropsy of the thoracic, abdominal, and pelvic viscera may be performed. The distribution of implantation sites and any observed abnormalities is recorded. Guidelines indicate that a cause of death and pregnancy status be determined for all animals that die or are sacrificed early. Aborted fetuses and/or delivered pups are examined as feasible. Offspring allowed to mature through mating (F1 generation) are evaluated for normal growth, body weight gain, and nursing activity. Functional observational evaluations are also conducted, viability and lactation indices recorded and genders determined. Gross necropsies are performed at the end of the study and any pups that are sacrificed or die early are evaluated for abnormalities or cause of death as appropriate.",

One notable exception is the Japanese guidance [4] which states that safety pharmacology studies are required for all vaccines (novel as well as previously marketed). However, this guidance does indicate that a stand-alone safety pharmacology study may be reduced or eliminated if specific endpoints have been included in repeat-dose toxicity studies. Furthermore, based on the author's personal experience, the requirements for nonclinical safety pharmacology studies may also be limited or omitted if safety pharmacology endpoints (e.g. ECG evaluations) have been included as part of the clinical evaluation \"overseas\" prior to the conduct of clinical studies in Japan. In the event that safety pharmacology studies are required, given that repeat-dose toxicity studies are typically conducted in rats or rabbits, an assessment of CV parameters as part of the general toxicity study is not well established and rarely feasible. Therefore, in practice a separate safety pharmacology study would have to be conducted for this purpose. It is highly desirable to perform safety pharmacology studies in the same species as that used in the general toxicology studies in order to put toxicity responses into perspective with other study data. Where this is not possible (e.g. toxicology species is the rabbit), studies in non-human primates or other relevant species would need to be conducted.

Given the regulatory and public scrutiny surrounding the use of adjuvants it is important to provide a rationale for the need for an adjuvant supported by evidence in a relevant animal model (e.g. character of the immune response, protection against a lethal challenge of the pathogenic organism, or information from the literature). Since not all adjuvants are designed to elicit the same type or duration of immune response, separate immunogenicity and toxicological evaluations are conducted. Per regulatory guidelines, pharmacokinetic studies are not required. If no toxicity data exist, full toxicological evaluations on the adjuvant alone should be conducted similar to new chemical entities [27, 28] . If more than one adjuvant is to be used, an evaluation of each alone and in combination is conducted. Though the species selected for these studies should ideally be the same as that used for proof-of-concept, species selection is dependent upon the antigen and adjuvant combination and any potential species specificity associated with the adjuvant itself. In the adjuvant-alone studies, evaluations for local tolerance, the induction of hypersensitivity and anaphylaxis as well as pyrogenicity [18, 22, 23] are recommended. The adjuvant is administered at intervals reflecting the proposed clinical use and systemic toxicity is evaluated including a full necropsy and tissue collection for histopathology. The evaluation should include a dose response but the highest dose may be selected based on expected clinical use rather than establishing an MTD. Other endpoints are included as outlined in guidelines for the evaluation of new chemical entities [27, 28] . If the adjuvant is intended for use in pregnant women or women of childbearing potential, reproductive toxicity studies are conducted. The dosing regimen reflects the intended clinical plan and the vaccine is administered both prior to and during pregnancy. While adjuvants of a biological nature are treated as biotechnology products and therefore do not require genotoxicity testing per ICH S6 [29] synthetic adjuvants are subject to the standard battery of genetic toxicity testing per ICH S2 [25] .",

Guidelines indicate that nonclinical toxicity studies for DNA vaccines following GLP guidelines [13] should be conducted prior to the initiation of Phase I clinical studies. While nonclinical toxicity studies for these vaccines are carefully considered based on productspecific characteristics, planned clinical studies, and previous experience with similar constructs, in general studies are conducted per the recommendations in the WHO guidelines for nonclinical evaluation of vaccines [2] . Per the WHO guideline for DNA vaccines [8] , there are several potential safety issues specific to the administration of plasmid DNA into humans: (i) the injected DNA taken up by cells of the host may integrate into the host's chromosomes and cause an insertional mutagenic event, (ii) the long-term expression of a foreign antigen may result in an undesired immunopathological reaction, (iii) the use of genes encoding cytokines or co-stimulatory molecules may pose additional risks, (iv) antibodies against the injected DNA itself may be formed and these may contribute towards undesired autoimmune reactions; (v) the expressed antigen may itself have biological activity; and (vi) expression of other gene sequences such as those for antibiotic resistance, in mammalian or bacterial cells may pose a risk. Therefore, in addition to studies designed to evaluate systemic toxicity and III. VACCINES local reactogenicity, regulatory authorities require that studies designed to evaluate plasmid biodistribution, persistence, and integration be conducted using sensitive nucleic acid detection techniques such as quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR)-based assays. Some of the risks associated with DNA integration include tumorigenesis and chromosomal instability and these evaluations serve to determine the tissue distribution following administration and the potential for the vector to integrate into the host genome. A panel of tissues including the blood, heart, brain, liver, kidney, bone marrow, ovaries/testes, lung, draining lymph nodes, spleen, and muscle and subcutis at the site of administration is evaluated. Given that the same plasmids encoding different antigens behave similarly in vivo, health authorities may waive the requirements for biodistribution studies for vaccines for which studies have already been conducted and have an acceptable biodistribution/integration profile. These evaluations are conducted at both early and late time points. The possibility of distribution to or expression in germline cells must be evaluated unless otherwise justified. Persistence of plasmids in gonadal tissue over time would trigger additional evaluations in tissues such as ova and sperm cells as well as studies to determine the effect on fertility and general reproductive function. Embryo-fetal and perinatal toxicity studies may also be required if women of childbearing potential are to be exposed to the product. DNA vaccines utilizing novel vectors, formulations, methods of delivery, routes of administration, or any other modifications expected to significantly impact cellular uptake and/or biodistribution may require these studies and regulatory agencies recommend that input be solicited on specific needs prior to the conduct of any studies. Integration studies are only conducted if it is determined that the plasmid persists at levels greater than 30 000 copies per \u00b5g of host DNA by study termination.",

The antigens may be of viral, bacterial, or parasitic origin but generally derive from those infectious agents for which no effective vaccine exists such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), malaria, dengue virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV), and ebola virus. Because the immune response elicited by live viral III. VACCINES vectored vaccines is specific to both the heterologous antigen and the antigens of the vector itself, evaluations of the immune response to the overall vectored vaccine is required by health authorities. In addition, human virulence of the vaccine may not be predicted from known virulence of the vector alone and studies in appropriate animal models are conducted to evaluate virulence. The nonclinical toxicity studies for live virus vectored vaccines are conducted according to the EMA [10] and WHO guidelines for nonclinical evaluation of vaccines [2] , with some exceptions. Regarding species relevance, regulatory guidelines indicate that it is preferable to use the species in which an animal model of disease has been established. When evaluating the immune response to the vaccine, consideration is given to preexisting immunity and nonprotective immunity to the vector and/or heterologous antigens. The immunogenicity evaluation also includes quantitative as well as qualitative data which characterize humoral, cell-mediated and innate immune responses, as appropriate, to both the intended protective antigen as well as the antigens of the vector. When selecting groups to be evaluated on nonclinical toxicity studies, it is required that a group consisting of the vector alone be included. If an immune response to the vector is found to interfere with the response to subsequent administrations of the vaccine, a single-dose study may be justified.
