Of 537 specimens from patients in whom SARS was clinically diagnosed, 332 (60%) had SARS-CoV RNA in one or more clinical specimens, compared with 1 (0.3%) of 332 samples from controls. Of 417 patients with clinical SARS from whom paired serum samples were available, 92% had an antibody response. Rates of viral RNA positivity increased progressively and peaked at day 11 after onset of illness. Although viral RNA remained detectable in respiratory secretions and stool and urine specimens for >30 days in some patients, virus could not be cultured after week 3 of illness. Nasopharyngeal aspirates, throat swabs, or sputum samples were the most useful clinical specimens in the first 5 days of illness, but later in the illness viral RNA could be detected more readily in stool specimens.",

A proportion of patients have watery diarrhea, usually at a later stage of the illness, suggesting that the infection may not be confined to the respiratory tract (4) . A novel coronavirus, designated as SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), was implicated as the causative agent (5) (6) (7) , and the respiratory disease has been reproduced in a nonprimate animal model (8) . Hong Kong was one of the regions most affected, with >1,700 patients. Specific laboratory tests to detect viral RNA and antibody responses (5) were used to establish a cause in patients suspected to have SARS. Although virologic results for small cohorts of patients have been reported (4, 5, 9) , analysis of results of these first-generation tests in routine clinical practice has not been published previously. We report the correlation of results of reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and immunofluorescent serologic testing for SARS-CoV in 1,048 cases investigated for SARS in the first 5 weeks after the first-generation diagnostic tests became available in Hong Kong.",

Clinical specimens used for viral RNA detection included nasopharyngeal aspirates, throat and nose swabs, saliva, sputum, endotracheal aspirates, feces, and urine. Nasopharyngeal aspirates were collected into a mucus trap, and residual secretions in the catheter were sucked into the trap by aspirating 2 mL of virus transport medium. Swabs were collected into 2 mL of virus transport medium containing vancomycin (final concentration 100 \u00b5g/mL), amikacin (30 \u00b5g/mL), and nystatin (40 U/mL). Urine and feces were collected into specimen containers and submitted directly to the laboratory without the addition of transport medium.",

Viral RNA detection by these first-generation RT-PCR tests is less sensitive than serologic testing for diagnosing SARS. Correspondingly, 92% of 417 patients with clinically diagnosed SARS and none of the paired sera from 45 unrelated controls seroconverted to SARS-CoV. However, 2 of 25 patients designated as \"not SARS\" category from whom paired sera were available also seroconverted. Paired sera were available from only a few (25 of 379) patients in the \"not SARS\" group. At a time of intense pressure on the clinical front-line staff, there was little incentive to obtain convalescent-phase sera from patients believed not to have SARS. These 25 patients may represent a biased sample of the larger group of non-SARS patients. This contention is supported by the fact that a further 47 convalescent-phase sera subsequently obtained from this group of \"not SARS\" patients failed to show any additional antibodies to SARS. Even patients in the \"not SARS\" category had a febrile, respiratory, often pneumonic, illness; one of the two patients in the \"not SARS\" category who had evidence of seroconversion had an undiagnosed pneumonic illness, while the other had an undiagnosed febrile illness without radiologic consolidation of the lung.

NPA, nasopharyngeal aspirate; NS/TS, nasal and throat swabs. progressively increased from onset of the illness until approximately day 11 after onset. Since the first-generation RT-PCR test has relatively low sensitivity, these results reflect the increasing viral load at different clinical sites during the illness. Whereas these data are cross-sectional, in a previous study viral load in nasopharyngeal aspirates was followed up longitudinally in nasopharyngeal specimens collected at days 5, 10, and 15 after illness onset; results of this study also indicated that viral load peaks at day 10 of illness (4) . Such a profile of a progressive increase in viral load is unusual for respiratory viral infections. Most other infections (e.g., respiratory syncytial virus, influenza) have peak viral titers in the respiratory secretions at or soon after the onset of clinical illness, after which viral titers and laboratory diagnostic yield decrease progressively (14) . This \"crescendo\" pattern in SARS-CoV detection rates and viral load in clinical specimens has a number of implications. The pattern explains the poor sensitivity of the first-generation diagnostic tests during the first 5 days of the illness and emphasizes the challenge in making laboratory diagnosis early in the disease. These results may also suggest a fundamental difference in the efficacy of the innate immune response in controlling SARS-CoV infection, in contrast, for example, with influenza infection. Innate immune mechanisms are the earliest host defenses that control viral replication and, in the case of many respiratory viruses, do so within the first few days of illness, even before the specific adaptive immune responses have been activated. This response does not appear to occur with SARS, and viral load in the respiratory tract (4) begins to fall only when the antibody response appears, i.e., at approximately day 10 after onset of illness (4, 5) . This finding may suggest that SARS-CoV is able to evade the host innate response and requires the adaptive immune response to bring the infection under control. Finally, the peak viral load in the 2nd week of illness would predict that virus is more likely to be transmitted later in the course of the illness. This result indeed accords with epidemiologic observations (15) . With regard to observations of viral load, the frequent use of steroid therapy in hospitals (16) is a confounding factor that may contribute to the increase in virus load later in the illness.",

The finding of diarrhea unrelated to antimicrobial drug use in a number of patients supports evidence that the disease is not a purely respiratory one (4) . A number of animal coronaviruses (e.g., mouse hepatitis virus and feline coronavirus) have tropism for multiple organs (17) . Viral shedding is detectable by RT-PCR in the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and urinary tracts for many weeks after onset of illness, reflecting continued virus replication at these sites. However, SARS-CoV cannot be readily cultured from any of these sites after week 3 of illness. The viral RNA detected by RT-PCR after week 3 of illness is unlikely to represent persistence of viral RNA in the absence of ongoing viral replication. The apparent dissociation between virus isolation and RT-PCR may reflect the mucosal antibody's neutralizing the virus and rendering it less infectious. This observation also accords with the apparent absence of transmission of infection after week 2 of illness. The fact that virus isolation was done retrospectively may have affected the overall Positive NPA/sputum/total (%) Positive TS/total (%) Positive stool/total (%) Positive urine/total (%) Total pos/total tested (%) isolation rate. However, SARS-CoV appears relatively stable to freezing and thawing and is stable for many weeks in clinical specimens at 4\u00b0C or frozen at -70\u00b0C (K.H. Chan and J.S.M. Peiris, unpub. data).
