We performed a meta-analysis and systematic literature review to determine osteonecrosis occurrences in patients taking corticosteroids at varying mean and cumulative doses and treatment durations, and whether medical diagnoses affected osteonecrosis incidence. Fifty-seven studies (23,561 patients) were reviewed. Regression analysis determined significance between corticosteroid usage and osteonecrosis incidence. Osteonecrosis incidence was 6.7% with corticosteroid treatment of >2 g (prednisone-equivalent). Systemic lupus erythematosus patients had positive correlations between dose and osteonecrosis incidence. Each 10 mg/d increase was associated with a 3.6% increase in osteonecrosis rate, and >20 mg/d resulted in a higher osteonecrosis incidence. Clinicians must be wary of osteonecrosis in patients on high corticosteroid regimens, particularly in systematic lupus erythematosus.",

For analyses of osteonecrosis incidences between high-and low-dose corticosteroids, a 10,000 mg prednisone-equivalents cut-off was utilized because several studies reported doses at or below this level, or substantially above this level (e.g. N 15 g).

Extracted data were pooled from studies meeting inclusion criteria to calculate treatment effects (odds ratio and 95% confidence intervals) and weights utilizing statistical software (Comprehensive Meta-Analysis v2; Biostat, Englewood, New Jersey) to calculate effects of corticosteroid treatments and doses on incidences. Linear regressions and correlation statistics determined osteonecrosis incidences relative to corticosteroid doses (mean, cumulative, and duration; refer to Appendix for breakdown of included studies for each diagnosis category). Regression analysis was performed to find the quantitative relationship and its significance between the variables, corticosteroid daily dose, cumulative dose, and duration of treatment, and the incidence of osteonecrosis as a dependent variable. Due to the lack of complete dosage data in several studies, we were only able to assess this in SLE and renal transplant patients. The reported R-and R-square results were un-adjusted and reported only for simple linear regressions, rather than for multiple linear regressions to avoid distortion by strong associations between average doses, cumulative doses, and durations. A random effects model was used in the meta-analysis, with publication bias assessed using Orwin's fail-safe N and Duval and Tweedies trim and fill statistics. Furthermore, heterogeneity was assessed using Cochrane's Q and I 2 statistics. Statistical analyses were performed utilizing SSPS 17.0 statistical software (IBM, Armonk, New York).

This study builds upon individual reports that have demonstrated independent risk factors for osteonecrosis, which were not observed in earlier studies [2, 20, 66, 72] . Our results showed that osteonecrosis incidences were affected by treatment with corticosteroids, corticosteroid doses, and patient age. Specifically, patients treated with high-dose corticosteroids may be up to ten times as likely to develop osteonecrosis, and cumulative doses greater than 10 g may increase the likelihood of developing osteonecrosis by two-fold, compared to cumulative doses less than 10 g. In addition, it was observed in the regression analysis that the correlation between corticosteroid dose and osteonecrosis incidence was most evident in SLE patients. However, no differences between diagnoses were noted using the analysis of variance, and further study is needed before a stronger conclusion can be drawn.",

            "text": "In addition to differences in diagnosis, it is important to highlight the effects of demographic factors and race on the development of osteonecrosis. Although it is difficult to specify osteonecrosis rates in a whole population, some studies have evaluated osteonecrosis in Asian populations and have shown higher disease incidence, particularly in those who have corticosteroid-dependent conditions. For example, Yamaguchi et al demonstrated a rising trend in the incidence of nontraumatic ON in Japanese patients, particularly in those who had corticosteroid-dependent conditions, with rates of up to 44% in SLE patients who were on high-dose corticosteroids [74] . However, it was inconclusive whether this was a true trend or just an improvement in diagnostic capabilities. In addition, Fukushima et al observed that according to the Research Committee on Idiopathic Osteonecrosis of the Femoral Head in Japan, roughly 2200 new patients per year were diagnosed with ON. Comparatively, United States-based studies have shown much lower ON rates, with roughly a 15% ON prevalence in SLE patients [75] . Race-specific differences in gene mutations, such as factor V Leiden and prothrombin, have been implicated, however, definitive causes for disparities in incidence remain unclear, and may also be idiopathic or attributed to lifestyle [76] . Nevertheless, it is still important to highlight that there may be fundamental differences in the way certain patients respond to corticosteroids. Several studies published in the last two decades have demonstrated associations between high corticosteroid doses and osteonecrosis incidences, although others did not have this trend [12, 42, 50] . Similar to results observed in this meta-analysis, a prior systematic review found a 4.6% increase in the rate of osteonecrosis for every 10 mg per day increase in corticosteroid doses ( Fig. 2 ; present study had 10% increase per 10 mg/day) [67] . In addition, mean daily doses of greater than 40 mg per day (prednisone-equivalent) have been associated with a higher risk for developing osteonecrosis. One prospective study demonstrated 4-fold higher incidences of osteonecrosis in patients treated with mean daily corticosteroid doses of greater than 40 mg (P b 0.05) [66] . Nagasawa et al, in a study of 45 patients diagnosed with SLE and treated with oral prednisolone (40 mg/day), observed dose-response relationships with osteonecrosis over five years [77] . Based on yearly MRI scans, they found that administration of high corticosteroid doses (N1000 mg/day) was more frequently found in patients with early stage osteonecrosis than those without osteonecrosis (87% versus 37%; P b 0.01). It is possible that discrepancies between studies may be attributed to recent increases in MRI use for the diagnosis of earlystage osteonecrosis, which may have otherwise been undetectable on radiographic assessment.",

Additionally, Nakamura et al evaluated 201 patients with SLE over 13 years and observed that osteonecrosis risk was associated with increasing cumulative corticosteroid doses, with 15% of patients requiring increased corticosteroid doses developing the disease [39] . Shibatani and colleagues evaluated renal transplant recipients who underwent multiple rejection cycles, and they demonstrated associations between osteonecrosis and cumulative corticosteroid doses (OR 4.2; P = 0.008), but not with rejection episode numbers, which allude to the likelihood that higher cumulative doses, rather than systemic effects of host-versus-graft disease, may be implicated in osteonecrosis pathogenesis [60] . However, accurate differentiation between effects of mean daily corticosteroid doses and cumulative doses on the osteonecrosis risk is difficult, since patients with the highest cumulative doses often receive higher mean daily doses and/or are treated for longer durations.",

Of the 32 patients who developed ON, 17 were treated with pulsed corticosteroids while of the 40 patients who did not develop osteonecrosis, 18 were treated with pulsed corticosteroids. However, this study did not specify pulsed corticosteroid dosages. However, in a study by Ce et al, 60 multiple sclerosis patients, who did not have any risk factors for osteonecrosis, were treated with pulsed corticosteroids and were compared to a matched group of patients who did not receive corticosteroids [72] . Cumulative pulsed corticosteroid doses received by the treatment group was greater than 10 g, and they only received pulsed-corticosteroids and were not treated with any maintenance doses between pulses.

The lack of prospective randomized-controlled trials may have contributed to both studydesign and reporting bias in individual reports, which may have skewed the observed outcomes. Although double-blinded, prospective randomized-controlled trials are gold standards for evidence-based medicine, in certain situations, such as renal transplantation or SLE, where the first-line therapy is corticosteroids, it would have been unethical to design studies denying treatment. Thus, we relied primarily on case-control studies. There was also a lack of consistency in osteonecrosis diagnostic methods. Studies published after 1990 utilized MRI, while earlier studies relied on patient symptoms, radiographic findings, biopsies, and bone scanning, which due to low diagnostic sensitivity [78] may have underestimated the true osteonecrosis incidence. In addition, lower quality studies on medical diagnoses other than renal transplantation or SLE prevented multivariate analysis due to insufficient degrees of freedom in the statistical analyses. This was evident in studies on bone marrow transplant recipients, cardiac transplants, and SARS. However, we were able to analyze two common patient groups (SLE and renal transplantation). Furthermore, almost all studies reported using high cumulative corticosteroid doses. This study did not consider incidental corticosteroid doses, such as the use of dose-packs or corticosteroids in minimal doses that are typically not associated with osteonecrosis. We have focused on patients who received minimum cumulative doses of 2 g or 30 mg daily doses for less than 2 months. Thus, these results may not be indicative of patients given low cumulative doses (b 2 g) of corticosteroids for medical conditions that were not directly associated with osteonecrosis.",

            "text": "These meta-analysis and assessment of the available literature demonstrated that high-dose corticosteroid treatments may increase risk for developing osteonecrosis up to ten-fold. Patients treated with daily doses N40 mg were at higher risk, with 3.6% increase in incidences for every 10 mg increase in doses. Effects of cumulative corticosteroid doses and treatment durations are less clear, but are likely to have synergistic relationships with daily doses and underlying diagnoses. Pulsed-therapy has effects on increasing osteonecrosis risk. As molecular and genetic bases for this disease evolves, further knowledge of risk factors for osteonecrosis with prospective MRI-based studies will assist medical practitioners in educating patients. Presently, we would advise erring on the side of caution and using the lowest possible corticosteroid doses, while still maintaining clinical efficacy and minimizing risks. ",

Orwin's fail-safe N and Duval and Tweedie's trim and fill statistics were used to investigate publication bias. The adjusted odds-ratio for developing osteonecrosis with corticosteroid use was 6.4 (95% CI, 3.3 to 12.3). Using the criteria for trivial odds (i.e. not clinically important) ratio as 1.1 and mean odds ratio of 1.0 in missing studies, we found that 89 additional studies were necessary to reduce odds ratio to 1.1. Similarly, adjusted odds-ratios for developing osteonecrosis with high corticosteroid doses compared to low-dose corticosteroids were 2.4 (95% CI, 0.8 to 6.4). An additional 42 studies with mean odds ratio of 1.0 would be necessary to reduce odds-ratios of developing osteonecrosis with high-dose corticosteroids to under 1.1 suggesting that there exists nominal publication bias.Heterogeneity was investigated by conducting subgroup analyses and the extent evaluated using Cochrane Q and I 2 statistics with higher values suggestive of greater heterogeneity. There were substantial heterogeneities among 4 studies evaluating effects of low-and high-dose corticosteroids in osteonecrosis development (Cochrane Q = 7.8; I 2 = 61.4%; P = 0.05). Substantially less heterogeneities were found in subgroup analyses involving 3 reports on renal transplant recipients (Cochrane Q = 2.3, I 2 = 12.2%; P = 0.32). Marked homogeneity was found between 4 reports evaluating corticosteroid effects on osteonecrosis development (Cochrane Q = 2.1; I 2 = 0%; P = 0.32). In addition, substantial homogeneity was found in the subgroup of 3 reports investigating effects of corticosteroids on osteonecrosis incidences in hematopoietic stem cell transplant recipients (Cochrane Q = 1.8; I 2 = 0%; P = 0.4).1512.e5",
