G-quadruplexes are present in eukaryotes, prokaryotes, and viruses. In the latter, mounting evidence indicates their key biological activity. Since data on viruses are scattered, we here present a comprehensive analysis of putative G-quadruplexes in the genome of all known viruses that can infect humans. We show that the presence, distribution, and location of G-quadruplexes are features characteristic of each virus class and family. Our statistical analysis proves that their presence within the viral genome is orderly arranged, as indicated by the possibility to correctly assign up to two-thirds of viruses to their exact class based on the G-quadruplex classification. For each virus we provide: i) the list of all G-quadruplexes formed by GG-, GGG-and GGGG-islands present in the genome (positive and negative strands), ii) their position in the viral genome along with the known function of that region, iii) the degree of conservation among strains of each G-quadruplex in its genome context, iv) the statistical significance of G-quadruplex formation.

            "text": "G-quadruplexes (G4s) are nucleic acids secondary structures that may form in singlestranded DNA and RNA G-rich sequences under physiological conditions (Lipps and Rhodes 2009 ). Four Gs bind via Hoogsteen-type base-pairing to yield G-quartets: stacking of at least two G-quartets leads to G4 formation, through \u03c0-\u03c0 interactions between aromatic systems of G-quartets. K + cations in the central cavity relieve repulsion among oxygen atoms and specifically support G4 formation and stability (Sen and Gilbert 1990) . In the human genome, putative DNA G4 forming regions are clustered at definite genomic regions, such as telomeres, oncogene promoters, immunoglobulin switch regions, DNA replication origins and recombination sites (Maizels and Gray 2013) . Actual G4s were shown to be involved in key regulatory roles, including transcriptional regulation of gene promoters and enhancers, translation, chromatin epigenetic regulation, and DNA recombination (Perrone et al. 2013a; Holder and Hartig 2014; Maizels 2015; Rhodes and Lipps 2015; Zhou et al. 2015) .",

Viruses that infect humans are very diverse and, according to the Baltimore classification, they can be divided in seven groups based on the type of their genome and mechanism of genome replication: DNA viruses with 1) double-stranded (ds) and 2) single stranded (ss) genome; RNA viruses with 3) ds genome, or ss genome with 4) positive (ssRNA (+)) or 5) negative (ssRNA (-)) polarity; 6) RNA or 7) DNA viruses with reverse transcription (RT) ability, whose genome is converted from RNA to DNA during the virus replication cycle ( Table 1) . Each of these classes possesses a peculiar replication cycle (Flint et al. 2015 The presence of G4s in viruses and their involvement in virus key steps is increasingly evident (Metifiot et al. 2014; Ruggiero and Richter 2018) . In the dsDNA group, the presence of G4s was described in both Herpesviridae and Papillomaviridae families. In particular, the herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) possesses several repeats of important DNA G4-forming sequences (Artusi et al. 2015) that, when visualized with a G4-specific antibody in infected cells, massively form in the cell nucleus, peaking during viral replication and localizing according to the viral genome intracellular movements (Artusi et al. 2016 ).

A G4 ligand and its interaction with the telomeric repeats present in the HHV-6 genome were responsible for inhibition of human herpes virus-6 (HHV-6) genome integration into the host cell chromosome (Gilbert-Girard et al. 2017) . Similarly, G4 stabilizing compounds led to a reduction in Kaposi's sarcoma associated herpesvirus (KSHV) DNA replication and disrupted maintenance of the virus latent state (Madireddy et al. 2016 ). In the Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), RNA G4s were implicated in the regulation of viral DNA replication and translation (Norseen et al. 2009; Murat et al. 2014 ) and in the delay of viral antigen-specific T cells priming ). In addition, the interaction of nucleolin with EBNA1 mRNA G4 mediated the virus immune evasion (Lista et al. 2017) . In human papillomavirus (HPV), the presence of DNA G4s at the genome level was reported (Tluckova et al. 2013) . In ssDNA viruses, the presence of G4s in the adeno-associated virus genome and their interaction with nucleophosmin were shown to repress virus entry and replication (Satkunanathan et al. 2017) . In ssRNA (+) viruses, RNA G4s were described in the genomes of flaviviruses (e.g. Zika) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) (Fleming et al. 2016; Wang et al. 2016a ). In the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, a viral protein domain necessary for viral genome replication/transcription specifically binds RNA G4s (Tan et al. 2009; Kusov et al. 2015) . RNA G4s were also found in the ssRNA (-) Ebola virus genome (Wang et al. 2016b) . In hepatis B virus (HBV), the only member of dsDNA viruses with RT activity, stabilization of a G4 in the promoter of the envelope gene increased transcription and virion secretion (Biswas et al. 2017) . Functionally significant G4s were identified in the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a retrovirus belonging to group 6 (Table 1). G4s were described both in the RNA and DNA proviral genome (Perrone et al. 2013a; Perrone et al. 2014; Piekna-Przybylska et al. 2014) : in the latter, clusters of G4s were reported in the unique long terminal repeat (LTR) promoter (Perrone et al. 2013a; Amrane et al. 2014 ) and in the Nef coding region (Perrone et al. 2013b ). The cellular proteins nucleolin and hnRNP A2/B1 regulate the G4/ds equilibrium in the LTR promoter (Tosoni et al. 2015; Lago et al. 2017; Scalabrin et al. 2017 ) and G4 ligands induced author/funder.

First, we asked the following: is the number of putative G4s found in a viral genome simply due to chance, hence trivially reflecting genomic G/C content? Are putative G4s scattered on the genome or preferentially found in regulatory regions? To address these questions, we collected the whole viral genomes deposited in databanks, we clustered them in multiple sequence alignments, and searched for the presence of G4s looking for their conservation in variable/constant genomic regions. The results were compared with an in silico generated set of simulated genomes containing the same nucleotide composition of the corresponding real ones. Results show that many viruses have a highly significant content of putative G4s and their distribution is not random but rather peculiar to specific genomic regions (e.g. coding sequences, repeats, regulatory regions). Once attested that the presence of putative G4s is significant for some viruses, we further analyzed every single identified G4 in a virus species for its conservation across virus strains, as shown in Figure 1 reporting the data analysis workflow. The detailed information on the putative G4s present in each human virus is available in an easily accessible web site with interactive graphics for the straightforward interpretation and navigation of the data (http://www.medcomp.medicina.unipd.it/main_site/doku.php?id=g4virus). author/funder.

This interpretation holds independently of the length of the genome and/or of the prevalence of either G/C bases or G-islands, as we compare the number of G4s in a viral genome with the one we would expect in a simulated genome of the same length and of either the same base or G-island composition. To account for possible high discreteness of the data, a less conservative version of the P-value, called the mid-P value (Armitage and Berry 1994) , was used. Segment diagrams of the mid-P values of the Baltimore grouped viruses are reported in Supplemental_Material.pdf (Figure S1a and Figure S1b ) (Chambers et al. 1983 ). The number of viruses whose median G4 count is significant at the 10% level is listed in Table 2 (virus names in Supplemental_Table_S3.xlsx) with the indication of whether this median count is either higher or lower than the G4 count in simulated sequences. Our data show that most members of the dsDNA, ssDNA, and ssRNA (RT) present a highly significant content of G4s formed by GG-, GGG-and/or GGGG-islands in one or both strands. ssRNA (-) and ssRNA (+) classes are heterogeneous since some viruses are highly significant in any G4 category (from GG-to GGGG-islands), while others are not (see below).

            "text": "In this line of thinking, we asked whether the observed number of G4s, and more precisely its statistical significance with respect to the two random assembling scenarios, is representative for a particular virus class. To answer this question, we checked whether it is possible to classify each virus of the six classes considered, that is, dsDNA, ssDNA, dsRNA, ssRNA (+), ssRNA (-) and ssRNA (RT), into its own class based on the information of how significant its median G4 counts are. We chose to use a classifier built on multinomial logistic regression, as this method is both interpretable and robust to unbalanced group sizes as long as the group sizes are large enough. To avoid the latter drawback, we excluded from the model fit the hepatitis B virus, the only virus classified as dsDNA (RT), and the two unclassified Hepatitis delta and Hepatitis E viruses. Six features were used to classify the viruses, i.e. the six mid-P values (those calculated for GG-, GGG-, GGGG-, both in the positive and negative strand) which qualify the G4 content of the real viral sequences. The values were multiplied by 1 or -1 depending on whether the median G4 count was over-or underrepresented. Since real and corresponding simulated sequences contain the same base or G-islands composition, the classification model based on G4 content does not depend on the highly variable content of G/C in the different virus classes but is specifically designed on the peculiar presence or absence of G4s in each viral class. Furthermore, 34 viruses with no G4 count in all three G-island types in both the positive and negative strand and non-significant mid-P values at the 10% level were excluded from the analysis. We reclassified every viral genome used in our assessment using the discriminant function obtained from a leave-one-out analysis.

This suggests that short sequences of a given length (k-mer) could be over or underrepresented in certain viral genomes, as already reported in the literature (Greenbaum et al. 2008; Lobo et al. 2009 ). We observed that viral genomes enriched in putative G4s also contain a higher number of G-islands than expected from mere nucleotide composition, especially evident in the GG-islands. iii) The unevenly distribution of G4s can be used to classify membership of a virus in its corresponding category.

A positive loop_conservation value highlights G4-islands more conserved than their connecting loops, suggesting that only the G4 scaffold is required for mechanisms that are important for the virus life cycle, while the loops are dispensable. Considering the high mutation rate of viruses, this type of conservation indicates sequences where G4 formation is most likely essential. Equally conserved G4-islands and loops (loop_conservation value = 0) imply that both the G4 scaffold and connecting loops are potentially relevant for the virus and probably involve interactors that specifically recognize them. In this case, the high sequence conservation, especially in CDS, may depend on the required conservation of that peculiar gene product rather than the presence of a G4 structure. Nonetheless, the option of targeting these conserved G4s for therapeutic purposes remains unaltered and the availability of specific and conserved loops may only enhance the chance of finding selective ligands. Therefore, from this point of view, the 'zero' class is the best scenario for the development of specific drugs. The \"negative\" loop_conservation value scenario is of less author/funder.

Multiple alignments were built for each virus with usearch8 (Edgar 2010), using a permissive identity threshold (60%) to account for viral variability. Since in some cases nucleotide heterogeneity within viral species exceeded this value, multiple clusters of aligned sequences were obtained for some viruses, representing distinct genotypes. Considering the difficulty of obtaining high quality alignments beyond this limit of nucleotide similarity, all clusters obtained with this method were kept separate, manually assigned to specific genotypes and independently processed in the downstream analyses. One genome per each group of aligned sequences was chosen to serve as reference sequence, possibly belonging to the manually curated RefSeq database [https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/refseq/].

Two different strategies were adopted to generate simulated data: i) Single nucleotide assembling (SN) . A computational approach was adopted where, in analogy to Huppert and Balasubramanian (Huppert and Balasubramanian 2005) , the viral genome was modelled as a multinomial stream based on the assumption that each DNA base is independent. These authors give an explicit solution for the prevalence of G4s in the human genome as a function of p(G), the probability of any base being G. In our approach, we also accounted for the probability of cytosines (p(C)) and additionally assumed that adenine (A) and thymine (T) bases were equally likely to occur. As all four probabilities need to sum up to one, the statistical reference model is a multinomial distribution with probability vector (p(G), p(C), p(A), p(T)). We hence took as many independent draws from this multinomial distribution as the number of nucleotides in the reference viral genome (Supplemental_Material.pdf, Table S1 ). The probabilities p(G) and p(C) vary for each virus and reflect the prevalence of G and C bases present in that virus, while the remaining proportion is equally split to give p(A) and p(T).

The G4 pattern distribution for both the positive and negative strands is shown as a box plot for each Baltimore virus class, whereas the G4 count for each virus within each class is shown as a dot besides the box plot (Figure 2).

Poxviridae and Parvoviridae show an enrichment of GG-type G4s in both genome strands, whereas the same pattern is enriched in the positive strand of all Anelloviridae members and in the negative strand of most Paramyxoviridae and Retroviridae viruses. All other families are generally not enriched in G4s in any of the evaluated categories, with only a few exceptions that are listed in the following: L segments of Lassa virus and Lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (Arenaviridae), Wu and Merkel cell polyomaviruses (Polyomaviridae), Salivirus (Picornaviridae), M and S segments of respectively Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus and Rift Valley fever virus (Bunyaviridae).

While CDS and RR are explicitly defined in RefSeq and GenBank databases, the annotation of UTRs and promoters is more inconsistent, being defined only for some viral species. For this reason, the annotations of genes and CDSs were exploited to indirectly extract the coordinates of 5'and 3'-regulatory regions (see Materials and Methods for details). To determine the localization of G4s in viral genomes, the overlap extent between G4 patterns and genomic features was computed.Given the vast heterogeneity of the annotations reported in the feature fields, a manual revision was required to fix potential inconsistencies in annotations, regarding both keywords and coordinates. A revision was performed when possible, while controversial and uncertain annotations were not considered. These analyses are presented as bar charts for individual viral classes and G4-island pattern types (GG-, GGG-, GGGG-island) (Supplemental_Material.pdf,Figure S2a-c). As regards the GGG-island type, the herpesvirus family of dsDNA viruses presents G4s distributed along all the four identified genomic features, with a particularly high concentration in RR and, in some members, in the 5'regulatory region. This feature is consistent with the reported extent of G4s in HSV-1, which is mainly clustered in the RR of the virus genome(Artusi et al. 2015;Artusi et al. 2016).",
