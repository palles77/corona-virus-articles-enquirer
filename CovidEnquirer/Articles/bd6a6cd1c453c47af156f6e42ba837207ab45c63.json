            "text": "Objectives: The outbreak of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection in the Republic of Korea started from the index case who developed fever after returning from the Middle East. He infected 26 cases in Hospital C, and consecutive nosocomial transmission proceeded throughout the nation. We provide an epidemiologic description of the outbreak, as of July 2015. Methods: Epidemiological research was performed by direct interview of the confirmed patients and reviewing medical records. We also analyzed the incubation period, serial interval, the characteristics of superspreaders, and factors associated with mortality. Full genome sequence was obtained from sputum specimens of the index patient. Results: A total of 186 confirmed patients with MERS-CoV infection across 16 hospitals were identified in the Republic of Korea. Some 44.1% of the cases were patients exposed in hospitals, 32.8% were caregivers, and 13.4% were healthcare personnel. The most common presenting symptom was fever and chills. The estimated incubation period was 6.83 days and the serial interval was 12.5 days. A total of 83.2% of the transmission events were epidemiologically linked to five superspreaders, all of whom had pneumonia at presentation and contacted hundreds of people. Older age [odds ratio (OR) Z 4.86, 95% confidence interval (CI) 1.90e12.45] and underlying respiratory disease (OR Z 4.90, 95% CI 1.64 e14.65) were significantly associated with mortality. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the MERS-CoV of the index case clustered closest with a recent virus from Riyadh, Saudi Arabia. Conclusion: A single imported MERS-CoV infection case imposed a huge threat to public health and safety. This highlights the importance of robust preparedness and optimal infection prevention control. The lessons learned from the current outbreak will contribute to more up-to-date guidelines and global health security.",

Since it was first reported from Saudi Arabia in September 2012, 1,211 patients have been detected worldwide, as of June 5, 2015 [3] . Secondary infection through human-to-human transmission was confirmed from previous outbreaks [4, 5, 6] , and outbreaks in healthcare settings comprise a large proportion of the outbreak [4, 7] . Although the exact route of transmission is still unclear, the respiratory droplet route is currently most likely [8] . Until June 2015, most of the cases of MERS-CoV infection occurred in the Middle East. Although a few cases were reported in other countries, none exceeded five [3] .",

However, by then he had already contacted approximately 600 people during his visits to two clinics and admission to a secondary hospital (Hospital C) located in Pyeongtaek, Gyeonggi-do.

The duration and route of exposure were further determined through reviewing closed circuit television and tracking the health insurance review and assessment service, global positioning system of the patient's cellular phone, and recent credit card inquiry transactions. Based on these data, potential exposures were identified for each confirmed case. When a confirmed case had multiple potential exposures, the most probable exposure was determined through the consensus of the authors. Simultaneously, we thoroughly reviewed the medical records of the patients in order to identify underlying comorbidities, radiological evidence of pneumonia, aerosol generating procedures, and final prognosis. National health insurance data was used to validate underlying diseases of the confirmed patients.",

Treating these times as interval-censored estimates of the incubation period for each person, we fit a log-normal distribution to these data using maximum-likelihood techniques. We then examined the robustness of our estimates with multiple definitions of onset and with the exclusion of particular cases. The serial interval was estimated by identifying the times of symptom onset in the patient and in the person who transmitted the infection (infectedeinfector pairs) and then fitting a log-normal distribution to these interval-censored data [14] . We estimated the medians and 5 th and 95 th percentiles of the incubation period and the serial interval using the quintiles of log-normal distribution fit to each data set. The Chi-square test and Fisher's exact test were used, as appropriate, to compare variables such as age, sex, symptoms at presentation, and underlying disease in association with mortality. Risk factors associated with mortality were assessed using logistic regression analysis. All statistical tests were two-tailed and were considered statistically significant at p < 0.

In addition to the transmission between patients or healthcare personnel, transmission to hospital visitors was also reported [6, 7] . Nosocomial transmission was also predominant in the present outbreak. Of 182 confirmed cases of MERS- CoV infection whose setting of contact is identified, all but one case were infected in healthcare facilities or in ambulances. However, the range of exposure was more extensive than that of outbreaks in the Middle East, infecting multiple visitors, radiologic technologists, hospital security agents in emergency departments, emergency medical technicians, and caregivers.

            "text": "MERS-CoV transmission showed heterogeneity of infectiousness as observed in severe acute respiratory syndrome [4, 17, 18, 19] . Similarly, the majority (91.3%) of cases resulted in no transmission and the remaining small proportion caused most of the transmission events in this outbreak. However, superspreading events were more prominent than previous reports. Prolonged duration of exposure before diagnosis and proper isolation, practice of seeking care at multiple healthcare facilities, frequent interhospital transfer, significant numbers of paid caregivers, and large numbers of contacts in large crowded tertiary referral hospitals might have contributed to multiple spreading events. Moreover, the custom of family members and friends to accompany or visit patients, and to provide care with staying in the same hospital rooms (mostly multibed rooms) or in the crowded emergency rooms, may have also contributed to the increased number of contacts. Regarding clinical manifestation, all patients who resulted in multiple transmissions had pneumonia, and those with severe cough infected more cases than others who rarely coughed. There was no evidence of viral mutation which can modify the mode of transmission or virulence [11] . The outbreak progressed in the manner of human-tohuman transmission. However, it is still uncertain whether the transmission occurred merely through the respiratory droplet route or through another route of transmission (i.e., airborne transmission). Although the respiratory droplet route is currently regarded as the most likely route of transmission [8] , the outbreaks in Hospital C and Hospital H were far more extensive compared with previous hospital outbreaks, and surveillances for other possible routes are under process. Irrespective of the route of transmission, viral transmission actually occurred between rooms in the same ward and throughout the emergency room of Hospital H, which is as wide as 1,970 m 2 . Transmission across rooms has been previously reported [4] , but the present outbreak demonstrated its high feasibility and magnitude. To successfully control the MERS-CoV outbreak, it is essential to implement droplet and contact precautions and trace every individual, including patients, healthcare personnel, and visitors, who stayed in the same ward or same emergency room.",

It is noteworthy that only 12.9% of patients had gastrointestinal symptoms, which is relatively lower than its prevalence of 20e30% documented elsewhere [4] . This may partly be explained by the limitation of current data which is based on primary epidemiologic investigation reports. The estimated incubation period of the present outbreak was 6.83 days, which is similar to that of previous outbreaks [4] . Estimated distribution indicated that most of the infected patients would have symptoms by Day 13.48 , and this may reinforce the current policy regarding the duration of quarantine. Estimated serial interval was 12.5 days in this outbreak, which was longer than that of 7.6 days in the previous report [4] . Compared with the previous report, our results have strength in the aspect that they are based on a larger sample size and every case is confirmed by a laboratory test. However, we might have wrongly attributed tertiary or quaternary infection to secondary or tertiary infection in the process of determining the most probable exposure, and thus overestimated the serial interval.",

Unfortunately, this was not timely enough to prevent infected patients, including superspreaders, from discharging from or transferring to other hospitals.
