On the other hand, bovine fetuses develop the ability to produce antibodies upon antigenic stimulation relatively early in gestation (Solomon, 1971; Osburn, 1973; Schultz, 1973; Schultz et al., 1973) . Many workers have reported the presence of antibodies against various viruses in sera from colostrum-deprived calves and fetuses (Kniazeffet al., 1967; Dunne et al., 1973; Homer et al., 1973; Hubbert et al., 1973; Schultz et al., 1973; Miura et al., 1974; Rossi and Kiesel, 1974; Kurogi et al., 1975) . On the other hand, there have been reported studies suggesting the presence of virus-neutralizing substances, other than immunoglobulins, in bovine sera (McFerran, 1962 a, b; Kanamitsu et al., 1967; Doggett et al., 1968; Urasawa et al., 1968 a, b; .",

Sephadex G-200 gel filtration of P-8 sample also demonstrated neutralizing activity against bovine parvovirus in fractions con- taining no detectable amounts of immunoglobulins (Fig. 3) .
