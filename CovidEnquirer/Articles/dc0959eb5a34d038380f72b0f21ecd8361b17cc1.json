            "text": "Mammalian orthoreoviruses (MRVs), which cause gastrointestinal and respiratory illness, have been isolated from a wide variety of mammalian species including bats, minks, pigs and humans. Here we report the isolation and genetic and pathogenic characterization of a novel MRV type 3 (MRV3), named MRV-ZJ2013, from the diarrheic feces of piglets in Zhejiang province, China. Genomic and phylogenetic analysis shows that MRV-ZJ2013 may have originated from reassortments among mink, bat, and pig MRVs, suggesting the hypothesis that interspecies transmission has occurred in pig herds. Neonatal piglets infected with MRV-ZJ2013 displayed mild clinical signs such as poor appetite and soft feces, but vomiting and diarrhea were not observed. Fecal virus shedding was detected only in three out of six piglets, each for one-or two-day post-infection. In contrast, piglets inoculated with a virulent porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) strain as the control group had severe signs characterized by acute vomiting and watery diarrhea. These findings suggest that the virulence of MRV-ZJ2013, if any, was likely not significant compared to that of PEDV. A seroepidemiological survey of MRV by means of an indirect enzyme-linked immune-sorbent assay (ELISA) based on a recombinant MRV3 capsid protein sigma1 as antigen revealed a high seroprevalence (77%) in 1037 samples from diarrheic pigs of different ages from 24 herds in seven provinces of east China between 2015 and 2016, indicating that MRV3 is endemic in pig herds in China, and may contribute collectively to enteric disease along with other porcine pathogens.",

The etiology of diarrhea is varied, including multiple viral, bacterial, and parasitic pathogens, but viruses such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) (Huang et al., 2013) , porcine delta coronavirus (PDCoV) (Jung et al., 2015; Wang et al., 2015b) , transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Kim et al., 2000) , rotavirus (RV) (Santos and Hoshino, 2005) and other enteroviruses (EV) (Saif, 1999) , are the predominant factors in most cases. Repeated outbreaks have also been reported on farms in which piglets had been immunized by vaccines targeting these viruses. Recently, mammalian orthoreovirus (MRV), which can cause diarrhea alone or in co-infections with other known pathogens, has been of great concern in Asia, especially in China and South Korea (Dai et al., 2012a; Kwon et al., 2012a; Zhang et al., 2011b) .",

However, in the last decade, increasing numbers of studies in humans and other mammals have shown that they can cause severe illness in humans and other mammals, including upper respiratory tract infections, encephalitis, and diarrhea (Chua et al., 2008; Ouattara et al., 2011a; Steyer et al., 2013a) . MRVs have been isolated from a broad range of mammalian species, including bats (Hu et al., 2014; Kohl et al., 2012; Lelli et al., 2013; Lorusso et al., 2014; Thalmann et al., 2010; Wang et al., 2015a; Yang et al., 2015) , civet cats , cows (Anbalagan et al., 2014) , mink (Lian et al., 2013) , pigs (Dai et al., 2012b; Kwon et al., 2012b; Thimmasandra Narayanappa et al., 2015; Zhang et al., 2011a) , dogs (Decaro et al., 2005) and humans (Chua et al., 2008; Ouattara et al., 2011b) . However, porcine MRV failed to arouse the concern of researchers until 2007, when it was first reported as the cause of diarrhea in newborn piglets in China (Zhang et al., 2011a) . Serotypes 1 and 3 of porcine MRV were subsequently isolated in China (Dai et al., 2012b; Zhang et al., 2011a) and the prevalence and genetic diversity of porcine MRVs circulating in South Korea was assessed in 2012 (Kwon et al., 2012b) . They found that 19.0% of diarrheic fecal samples collected from 78 pig farms around the country tested positive for porcine MRV (Kwon et al., 2012b) . In 2015, a novel type 3 MRV (MRV3) was isolated and characterized in the USA, having caused severe diarrhea and acute gastroenteritis in neonatal piglets with 100% mortality by 3 days post-infection (Thimmasandra Narayanappa et al., 2015) . Therefore, porcine MRV may contribute to enteric disease alone or in combination with other swine pathogens.",

The purified \u03c31 proteins were diluted in carbonate coating buffer (pH 9.6), which was used for coating 96-well ELISA plates with 100 \u03bcl/well.

Unexpectedly, an unknown viral agent inducing cell lysis without forming syncytia was identified in one of the samples. After 5 passages with virus isolated from fecal suspension supernatants (MRV-ZJ2013), Vero cells showed CPE that was characterized by enlarging and rounding of the infected cells and then detachment after 20-30 hpi (Fig. 1A) . Infected cell monolayers were completely detached by 72-96 hpi (Fig. 1B) whereas the mock-infected cells grew normal (Fig. 1C) . Virus plaques were observed at 2 dpi (Fig. 1D) . Electron microscopy of negatively stained virus-infected Vero cells (12 and 24 hpi) demonstrated the presence of icosahedral non-enveloped viral particles ranging in size from 70 to 90 nm that arranged neatly in the cytoplasm of the infected cells (Fig. 1E-F) . Since we could not identify the virus by means of PCR or RT-PCR for detection of common viruses such as PEDV, TGEV, PDCoV and RV initially, the purified viruses were subjected to the next generation sequencing. After quality control to remove reads shorter than 80 bases and duplicate reads, the sequencing data were assembled and compared with the GenBank database using the BLASTx algorithm. The results revealed the genomic identity of this virus to be MRV, and no other viral matches were detected (data not shown). An anti-\u03c31 rabbit polyclonal antibody was generated and used for IFA, with specific fluorescence observed in Vero cells infected with MRV-ZJ2013, whereas staining with the pre-immune rabbit sera in virus-infected cells displayed no fluorescent signal (data not shown).",

Based upon the S1 gene, MRV-ZJ2013 belongs to the lineage IV of MRV3 and is closely related to the other porcine MRV3 isolates from Asia (Fig. 3) . Six segments are closely related to bat MRVs isolated in China: M1 and S3 likely originate from serotype 1 bat MRV; M3 and S2 likely from the serotype 2 bat MRV; and L2 and S4 likely from serotype 3 bat MRV (Supplemental Fig. S1 ). Other segments, such as L3, M2 and S1, have closest relationship with porcine MRV3 reported in Asia. However, the L1 gene of MRV-ZJ2013 is closely related to the sequence KT224504 derived from the mink MRV3 (Mink-SD) isolated in China (Supplemental Fig. S1 ). It's noted that the porcine MRV reported recently in the USA and Europe (Lelli et al., 2016 ; Thimmasandra Narayanappa et al., P. Qin et al. Veterinary Microbiology 208 (2017) 126-136 2015), which causes clinical diarrhea and acute gastroenteritis, has completely different origins than MRV-ZJ2013. The close genetic similarity of different segments of MRV-ZJ2013 to those of the respective bat, mink and porcine MRVs might reflect recent cross-species transmissions in pig herds, and suggesting the hypothesis that MRV-ZJ2013 is likely a reassortant MRV3 strain.",

            "text": "Frequent outbreaks of diarrhea cause substantial economic losses for the swine industry, with PEDV, TGEV, PDCoV, RV, EV, and some bacteria as the primary agents. However, some newly emerging pathogens have been reported in the past decade. We have isolated a porcine MRV3 from the feces of diarrheic pigs in Zhejiang province in China (Fig. 1) , and ELISA has shown that anti-MRV3 \u03c31 IgG antibody is present in the majority of diarrheic pigs at different ages (Fig. 4B) . As the serum samples in our study were collected from pigs at a wide range of ages, the results give a good overview of viral prevalence. The current study shows that sows and 1-week-old piglets had a high positive rate as well as high levels of anti-MRV IgG. The mean OD450 of primiand multiparous sows was higher than the gilts, indicating that anti-MRV3 IgG levels increase over time (Fig. 4B) . It also indicates that piglets had already been infected at 1 week-of-age, and the sows are likely viral sources. Maternal antibody levels decreased gradually over time, disappearing around the weaning age (Pignatelli et al., 2010) , after which the piglets developed their own immune response upon viral exposure. The study shows that anti-MRV IgG exists at all ages, suggesting that there may be a continuous spread of virus within the farms. For detection of the MRV3 RNA, our preliminary data using limiting samples revealed that porcine MRV3 was present in at least 24 of 208 (11.5% positive after first round, and 66% positive after nested round) diarrheic porcine fecal samples obtained from different provinces by the nested RT-PCR assay described above targeting the L1 gene (unpublished data). It has also been reported that porcine MRV RNA was detected in 19% of diarrheic fecal samples collected from 78 pig farms in South Korea (Kwon et al., 2012b) . The prevalence of MRV3 in North American pigs has recently been investigated with a real-time RT-PCR designed to target the S1 gene of MRV3, showing that MRV3 RNA was detected in 5.7% (16/277) of the fecal samples from 19.5% (8/41) of the farms (Xiao et al., 2016) . These results indicate that many herds all over the world are becoming exposed to this virus.",

            "text": "The dsRNA genome of MRV contains 10 discrete segments, which are prone to various types of alterations including intragenic rearrangement and reassortment when different strains concurrently infect a single host cell, both in laboratory and natural conditions (Lian et al., 2013; Mertens, 2004) . We found the genome of MRV-ZJ2013 to be a likely reassortment of segments from mink, bat, and pig MRVs (Fig. 7) , similar to previously reported phenomena (Yang et al., 2015) . Moreover, an RDP4 (Recombination Detection Program) analysis on the concatenated ten segments showed that MRV-ZJ2013 was derived from several cross-over events with well-supported breakpoints detected near the boundaries of the segments L1-L2, M1, M2, M3 and S1 in the concatenated genome (data not shown), which was in lines with the phylogenetic analyses. We speculate that bats are the primary hosts for genetic exchange among different MRV strains under natural conditions, as they possess certain ideal characteristics such as long life span, diversity, wide distribution, and they carry a number of zoonotic viruses from many different virus families (Smith and Wang, 2013) . The last decade has experienced a surge in reports of MRVs of bat origin that have a significant impact on human and animal health (Hu et al., 2014; Kohl et al., 2012; Steyer et al., 2013b; Wang et al., 2015a) . Moreover, the genome of MRV-ZJ2013 shows reassortment among different bat MRV serotypes: M1 and S3 seem to originate from serotype 1 bat MRV; M3 and S2 seem to come from serotype 2 bat MRV; and L2 and S4 come from serotype 3 bat MRV. Reassortment among different strains or recombination between different species may affect viral pathogenesis and zoonotic potential. Indeed, our previous study on emergent PEDV also identified a possible recombination event between PEDV and bat coronavirus in pigs (Huang et al., 2013) . Whether the virulence of the reassorted MRV-ZJ2013 may have been relatively decreased will be determined in the future.",

            "text": "The pathogenesis study showed that MRV-ZJ2013 from a diarrheic piglet was more likely non-pathogenic. This was probably due to mixed Fig. 7 . The 10 segments of the MRV-ZJ2013 are closely related to those of MRVs from mink, pigs, and bats. MRV-ZJ2013 was likely formed by a reassortment process: L3, M2 and S1 likely from porcine MRV; L2, M1, M3, S2, S3 and S4 segments from bat MRV; and the L1 segment originated from mink MRV. P. Qin et al. Veterinary Microbiology 208 (2017) 126-136 infections of MRV with the other viruses associated with diarrhea such as PEDV in the original sample. Additionally, piglets could develop an immune response without experiencing severe clinical symptoms including vomiting and diarrhea (Fig. 5) . Phylogenetic trees based on the S1 gene show that MRV-ZJ2013 and porcine MRVs isolated in the USA and Italy may have different origins. The strains isolated in the USA and Italy belonged to the lineage III. However, MRV-ZJ2013 and other Asia strains fall into the lineage IV (Fig. 3) . The \u03c31 protein is responsible for cell attachment, specifying tissue tropism, and hemagglutination. It consists of 453 aa with three discrete domains: the tail (310-455 aa), body (170-309 aa), and head (1-160 aa) (Reiter et al., 2011) . Serotype 3 (T3) reoviruses use JAM-A and \u03b1-linked sialic acids as receptors; structural and functional analyses show that the \u03c31 head engages JAM-A while the \u03c31 body binds to \u03b1-linked sialic acid (Reiter et al., 2011) . Antigenic analysis shows that porcine MRVs isolated in the USA and Europe share a similar antigenic index, whereas Asian porcine MRV strains such as MRV-ZJ2013 and isolates from the Sichuan province of China and South Korea are very different (Supplemental Fig. S2 ). Compared to the \u03c31 protein of MRV-ZJ2013, there are many unique aa substitutions in the head, body, and tail domains of the \u03c31 protein in porcine MRVs of US origin, with an associated difference in antigenic index that may contribute to variation in MRV pathogenesis (Supplemental Fig. S2 ). This study, along with a previous one (Yang et al., 2015) , shows evidence of possible zoonotic transmission events among viral strains from different host. An antigenically novel variant may be produced during reassortment that is not recognized by the host immune system, creating higher-fitness variants that can adapt to new hosts. Understanding the consequences of viral reassortment is important, as it may lead to newly emerging pandemic reoviruses with dire consequences for humans and animals (Mackenzie and Jeggo, 2013; McDonald et al., 2016) .",
