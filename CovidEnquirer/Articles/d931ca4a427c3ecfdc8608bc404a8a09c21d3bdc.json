Accordingly, the Ministry of Health of Vietnam, in collaboration with the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, launched a pilot project in 2016 focusing on community and hospital event-based surveillance. The pilot was implemented in 4 of Vietnam's 63 provinces. The pilot demonstrated that event-based surveillance resulted in early detection and reporting of outbreaks, improved collaboration between the healthcare facilities and preventive sectors of the ministry, and increased community participation in surveillance and reporting.",

The CHS is generally staffed by a medical professional and village health workers (VHWs), who are largely volunteers. The VHWs promote prenatal visits and vaccinations and in theory are responsible for reporting outbreaks from their communities.

In addition, the team found that VHWs were underutilized and not actively engaged with detection and reporting of suspected outbreaks from their communities. Finally, the team found no alert thresholds established for routinely reported HCF data for many endemic seasonal diseases, such as dengue or hand, foot, and mouth disease.",

In most communes, the CHSs also recruited and trained additional community members as health collaborators through the current project. Most were persons with strong community ties, including money lenders, insurance agents, veterinary health staff, landlords, factory managers, community leaders, and others in a good position to directly observe community events. This wide participation broadened the sources of reporting and resulted in the reporting of numerous signals that otherwise would have been missed, such as school absenteeism reported by teachers and the resulting multiple detections of vaccine-preventable diseases (e.g., mumps and chickenpox). In contrast to reporting by clinicians from HCFs, VHWs recognized connections between cases in the community that doctors can miss, such as clusters among neighbors, co-workers, or persons with social connections.",

Before EBS, such a rapid response by DHCs would not have been possible because ill persons would have to have been hospitalized to alert the system and, for certain diseases, traditional reporting often bypassed the CHSs. For example, foodborne illness events would first have to be reported to the Department of Food Safety and Hygiene, rather than the CHS, and ultimately to the DHC, resulting in delays. Similarly, animal events such as poultry die-offs or rabid dogs previously would have been reported to the Animal Health Department, and human health officials would not necessarily be alerted. During field visits, the DHC staff stated that because of the EBS pilot, multisectoral communication, such as between food safety and public health and human and animal health sectors, improved substantially. The greatest challenge in quantifying EBS impact was lack of baseline outbreak data. Although Circular 54 requires outbreak reporting through eCDS, outbreak reports are not recorded even if detected, and therefore baseline data were not available. However, the absence of preexisting data demonstrates another important EBS contribution: the availability of data on outbreaks and events for planning public health interventions.",

Specifically, for some signals, wording needed to be simplified for VHWs, and the signal list itself needed to be more concise. In addition, for some diseases, such as hand, foot, and mouth disease, ongoing surveillance requires reporting of every case rather than clusters, creating some confusion. In some jurisdictions, leadership decided unilaterally to broaden signals to include single case reports, whereas the signal had been defined as a cluster, increasing the system's sensitivity, but with a very low specificity. This change resulted in only 7% of all signals becoming public health events. In the future, adherence to accepted signal definitions by the workforce can be maintained with continuous training and experience. Based on the assessment, the guidelines and training materials were revised and will undergo pilot testing before scaleup (Table 6) .",

Position EBS to fit within the existing legal framework for surveillance and reporting. The EBS TWG for this project researched the existing regulations around reporting and demonstrated how the program complemented the existing systems rather than something additional. The TWG also avoided introduction of new technologies and regulations whenever possible to minimize disruption. 3. Include focused training on risk assessment to help staff to prioritize events for investigation. 4. Provide repeated follow-up refresher training. 5.

The vice minister of health issued a mandate in March 2018 that directed all provinces to integrate event-based surveillance into the national surveillance strategy, ensuring sustainability of the CEBS program. The formalization of EBS as a Ministry of Health regulation will enable the provinces to seek funds in the provincial budget to support EBS. With the Ministry of Health mandate, revised EBS materials, and experience gained by launching an EBS pilot, Vietnam's surveillance system will soon function as an effective early warning and response system.",
