            "text": "Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) and porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) are porcine nidoviruses that represent emerging viral pathogens causing heavy economic impacts on the swine industry. Although ribavirin is a well-known antiviral drug against a broad range of both DNA and RNA viruses in vitro, its inhibitory effect and mechanism of action on porcine nidovirus replication remains to be elucidated. Therefore, the present study was conducted to determine whether ribavirin suppresses porcine nidovirus infection. Our results demonstrated that ribavirin treatment dose-dependently inhibited the replication of both nidoviruses. The antiviral activity of ribavirin on porcine nidovirus replication was found to be primarily exerted at early times post-infection. Treatment with ribavirin resulted in marked reduction of viral genomic and subgenomic RNA synthesis, viral protein expression, and progeny virus production in a dose-dependent manner. Investigations into the mechanism of action of ribavirin against PRRSV and PEDV revealed that the addition of guanosine to the ribavirin treatment significantly reversed the antiviral effects, suggesting that depletion of the intracellular GTP pool by inhibiting IMP dehydrogenase may be essential for ribavirin activity. Further sequencing analysis showed that the mutation frequency in ribavirin-treated cells was similar to that in untreated cells, indicating that ribavirin did not induce error-prone replication. Taken together, our data indicate that ribavirin might not only be a good therapeutic agent against porcine nidovirus, but also a potential candidate to be evaluated against other human and animal coronaviruses.",

Despite striking differences in genome size and virion morphology, the genome organization and expression strategy of the two groups belonging to the Nidovirales order were found to be comparable. The nidovirus genome contains two large ORFs, 1a and 1b, comprising the 5 two-thirds of the viral genome encoding non-structural proteins (NSPs) and the remaining ORFs located in the 3 terminal region coding for structural proteins (Lai et al., 2007; Snijder and Spaan, 2007) . The initial translation from ORF1a and ORF1b yields the 1a and lab replicase polyproteins, respectively, which are then proteolytically processed into functional NSPs including the viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) (Bautista et al., 2002; van Aken et al., 2006; Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . The RdRp-containing replication complex mediates genomic RNA replication and subgenomic (sg) mRNA transcription, eventually generating a nested set of 3 -coterminal sg mRNAs that are individually translated to structural proteins (Lai et al., 2007; Snijder and Spaan, 2007) .",

PRRSV primarily replicates in porcine alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and can establish persistent infection in lymphoid tissues of infected pigs that lasts for several months (Albina et al., 1994; Christopher-Hennings et al., 1995; Duan et al., 1997; Wills et al., 2003) . As a result, PRRSV infection results in suppression of normal macrophage functions and immune responses, which may render pigs susceptible to secondary bacterial or viral infections, leading to more severe disease than either agent alone (Allan et al., 2000; Feng et al., 2001; Harms et al., 2001; Wills et al., 2000) . Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), a pathogenic enterocyte-tropic coronavirus of swine, is the etiological agent of acute enteritis, which is characterized by lethal watery diarrhea followed by dehydration leading to death with a high mortality rate in suckling piglets (Debouck and Pensaert, 1980) . These two viruses, PRRSV and PEDV, are devastating porcine nidoviral pathogens that have still continued to plague swineproducing nations, causing tremendous economic losses to the global and Asian pork industries (Neumann et al., 2005; Pensaert and Yeo, 2006) .",

            "text": "Ribavirin (1-\u2424-d-ribofuranosyl-1,2,4-triazole-3-carboxamide, also known as Virazole) is a synthetic guanosine analog that exhibits broad-spectrum antiviral activity in vitro (Sidwell et al., 1972) . It has been used experimentally against a wide range of both DNA and RNA viruses, including GB virus B, Hantaan virus, Hendra virus, respiratory syncytial virus, Lassa fever virus, Norwalk virus, and West Nile virus (Chang and George, 2007; Cooper et al., 2003; Day et al., 2005; McCormick et al., 1986; Lanford et al., 2001; Rockx et al., 2010; Severson et al., 2003) . Most notably, ribavirin is used in combination with interferon-\u2423 for treatment of chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV) infections (Cummings et al., 2001; Davis et al., 1998) . However, there is still no report regarding an antiviral effect of ribavirin during the replication cycle of porcine nidoviruses. In the present study, therefore, we tried to investigate the antiviral activity of ribavirin and its mechanism of action in target cells upon porcine nidovirus infection. Independent treatment of target cells with ribavirin significantly impaired PRRSV and PEDV infection. Further experiments revealed that suppression of ribavirin affects post-entry steps of the replication cycle of PRRSV and PEDV, including viral genomic and sg RNA synthesis, viral protein expression, and virus production. The addition of guanosine to the ribavirin treatment resulted in moderate reversal of the antiviral effects, suggesting that ribavirin activity is involved in the depression of cellular guanosine triphosphate (GTP) levels. Sequencing analysis of the PRRSV and PEDV genomes in the ribavirin-treated and non-treated groups revealed that the mutation rates were similar and indicated that ribavirin did not induce catastrophic mutations during the replication of porcine nidoviruses. Altogether, our results suggest that ribavirin may be an excellent therapeutic option for nidovirus infection in a human or veterinary subject.",

Based on MTT assay, none of the doses of ribavirin tested in the present study caused detectable cell death of PAM-pCD163 and Vero cells (data not shown). PAM-pCD163 and Vero cells were pretreated with ribavirin at concentrations of 10-50 M or 10-200 M, respectively, or with DW as a vehicle control for 1 h prior to infection. Ribavirin was present during the entire period of infection. Viral production was initially measured by monitoring the cytopathic effect (CPE) after infection and confirmed by immunofluorescence using N protein-specific MAb at 48 hpi (Fig. 1) . In vehicle-treated control cells, visible CPE appeared at 24 hpi and became predominant by 48 hpi, and N-specific staining was clearly evident in many cell clusters, indicating infection and the spread of the virus to neighboring cells. In contrast, ribavirin had an obvious inhibitory effect on virus propagation. As shown in Fig. 1A and B, ribavirin significantly decreased virus-induced CPE and viral gene expression of PRRSV and PEDV at concentrations of \u223c10 M and \u223c50 M, respectively. N protein staining revealed that the number of cells expressing viral antigen, as quantified by N protein staining results, was also reduced during ribavirin treatment, resulting in a maximum of \u223c80% inhibition in response to 50 M and 200 M for PRRSV and PEDV, respectively ( Fig. 1A and B) . Moreover, the effective doses for inhibiting 50% (ED 50 ) of the replication of PRRSV and PEDV were determined to be about 21 M and 73 M, respectively.

Treatment of cells with 50 M ribavirin for up to 4 hpi resulted in more than 80-90% decrease in PRRSV production when compared to the untreated control. Addition of ribavirin between 6 and 12 hpi led to 75-38% inhibition of PRRSV infectivity. Similarly, treatment with 200 M ribavirin at \u22121, 0, and 1 hpi was found to lead to 83-61% suppression of PEDV production, while its treatment at 2-12 hpi resulted in 49-28% reduction in PEDV infectivity. In contrast, no significant impairment of porcine nidovirus propagation was observed when ribavirin was added at 24 hpi.

            "text": "Like all positive-sense RNA viruses, following the uncoating process, the nidovirus genome is released into the cytoplasm and immediately serves as a template for viral translation by the same cellular cap-dependent mechanism. Early nidovirus translation produces replicase polyproteins that are posttranslationally cleaved into NSPs by viral proteases. Subsequently, the nonstructural replicase proteins mediate de novo synthesis of viral RNA, including genomic RNA replication and sg mRNA transcription. The nidovirus structural proteins are translated lately from respective sg mRNA transcripts. Thus, to determine the inhibitory mechanism of ribavirin on the postentry steps of the nidovirus life cycle, we first investigated whether viral protein translation was affected by ribavirin. To accomplish this, PAM-pCD163 and Vero cells were treated with ribavirin for 1 h prior to infection, and the drug was allowed to remain during infection and subsequent incubation. The expression levels of the PRRSV N and PEDV S proteins in the presence or absence of ribavirin were evaluated at 48 hpi by western blot analysis. The production of both proteins productions was drastically diminished during ribavirin treatment (Fig. 4) . Densitometric analysis of the western blots revealed that the intracellular expression of both N and S proteins was reduced by ribavirin, with a maximum of about 90% inhibition at the concentration of 50 M and 200 M, respectively (Fig. 4) . This marked reduction was probably not the result of a nonspecific decrease in the translation mechanism, since Ponceau S staining results indirectly indicated that the expression levels of the overall cellular proteins remained similar following treatment (data not shown). Taken together, these results demonstrated the inhibitory effects of ribavirin specifically against viral translation during porcine nidovirus replication.",

Since nidovirus infection produces two RNA entities including genomic versus subgenomic, we therefore determined if ribavirin specifically affected genome replication and sg mRNA transcription. To answer this question, the relative levels of both genomic RNA and sg mRNA were assessed by quantitative real-time strand-specific RT-PCR in the presence or absence of ribavirin upon porcine nidovirus infection. As shown in Fig. 5A , ribavirin exhibited a maximal 70% and 80% reduction in the synthesis of PRRSV genomic RNA and sg After washing with cold PBS, infected cells were maintained in the presence or absence of ribavirin either at 4 \u2022 C or 37 \u2022 C for an additional hour.

The decreases in viral RNA levels after the addition of ribavirin were not due to nonspecific inhibition of transcription, as mRNA levels of the internal control (\u2424-actin or GAPDH) remained unchanged in all samples (data not shown).

To assess these known mechanisms, we first examined whether replenishment of guanosine affected the antiviral effect of ribavirin against porcine nidovirus infection. The addition of 100 M guanosine to the ribavirin-treated and virus-infected cells was found to moderately reverse the antiviral activity of ribavirin. The incubation of ribavirin alone reduced PRRSV production to 29% and 17% at 10 M and 50 M, respectively, whereas supplementation of guanosine to ribavirin inhibited virus production to 40% and 26% at the same concentrations (Fig. 6A, left panel) . Likewise, while PEDV production was declined to 71%, 37%, and 12% in the presence of ribavirin alone at 50 M, 100 M, and 200 M, respectively, it decreased to 100%, 48%, and 31% at the same concentrations when guanosine was added to the ribavirin treatment (Fig. 6A, right panel) .

This order includes three families Arteriviridae, Coronaviridae, and Roniviridae, which have similar genome organization and replication strategy, but different virion morphology and genome length (Mayo, 2002; Lai et al., 2007; Snijder and Spaan, 2007) . Porcine nidoviruses are not only devastating viral pathogens to the pig population, but can also be applied as an animal virus model to study human or veterinary-important nidoviruses. Among these, despite tremendous efforts to control the diseases, PRRSV and PEDV have continuously plagued pigproducing countries, leading to significant economic impacts on the global or Asian swine industry, respectively. This is partially due to a lack of efficient vaccines capable of conferring full protection against viral infections and antiviral agents for treating porcine nidoviruses. Although ribavirin has an antiviral effect on a variety of DNA and RNA viruses (Sidwell et al., 1972) , its efficacy and mode of action on porcine nidovirus replication are currently unknown. The present study demonstrated that ribavirin also exerts very effective antiviral activity against PRRSV and PEDV in vitro, as indicated by ED 50 values of approximately 21 M (5.1 g/ml) and 73 M (17.8 g/ml), respectively. Ribavirin can potentially act via inhibition of various steps of the virus life cycle, including viral translation, genome or transcript capping, RNA synthesis, and progeny virus spread (Graci and Cameron, 2006) . Treatment of cells with ribavirin resulted in significant attenuation of postentry steps during the replication of porcine nidovirus, as determined by lower progeny production, diminished viral protein expression, and decreased synthesis of genomic RNA and sg mRNA. It was previously reported that the tier of murine norovirus 1 (MNV-1) in the presence of ribavirin dropped about 10-fold after virus infection, but remained similar after 48 h of virus infection (Chang and George, 2007) . In this study, growth kinetics experiments also indicated that the reduced rate of nidoviral titers in the presence of ribavirin was found to be comparable between 24 and 48 hpi. Since ribavirin should be converted to its monophosphate active form (RMP) to exert antiviral activity, it appears that virus infection may disrupt the normal metabolic processes, leading to interference with the conversion of ribavirin (Parker, 2005) . Taken together, our data indicate that ribavirin potently elicits antiviral activity against PRRSV and PEDV in target cells.",

            "text": "An important aspect of the antiviral activity of ribavirin may be attributed to the ability to act via multiple mechanisms simultaneously. Although the mechanisms of action of ribavirin still remain controversial, five primary mechanisms have been proposed depending on the particular virus. These include reduction in cellular GTP pools by inhibiting IMPDH, enhanced mutation frequency via its incorporation into the viral genome leading to catastrophic error, modulation of host immune responses, inhibition of 5 mRNA capping, and interference with viral RNA polymerase. Therefore, the mechanisms of action of ribavirin may differ among viruses, and its antiviral activity may be operated predominantly via one or two mechanisms (Graci and Cameron, 2006; Parker, 2005) . To elucidate potential mechanisms responsible for the antiviral effect of ribavirin on porcine nidoviruses, we first tested whether the antinidoviral activity of ribavirin is involved in inhibition of IMPDH and subsequent depression of cellular GTP levels. In previous studies, the addition of guanosine to the culture medium efficiently reversed the antiviral effects of ribavirin against norovirus, yellow fever virus, and human parainfluenza virus 3 (Chang and George, 2007; Leyssen et al., 2005) . The present study so investigated the effects replenishing GTP by adding guanosine to ribavirin-treated cells upon virus infection. Consistent with previous reports, the addition of guanosine to the ribavirin treatment significantly reversed the antiviral activity of ribavirin in porcine nidoviruses. Furthermore, a noncompetitive IMPDH inhibitor, MPA, was found to strongly inhibit the replication of PRRSV and PEDV at concentrations above 0.5 M and 0.1 M, respectively. In contrast to ribavirin, which has to be converted to the active RMP form to elicit the antiviral activity, MPA does not require metabolic activation to exert its function. Thus, the efficient antinidoviral activity of MPA suggests that ribavirin may directly lead to the inhibition of intracellular IMPDH levels. Since RNA viruses replicate with high genetic variation, they exist as viral quasispecies that are complex and dynamic mutant distributions that share a dominant nucleotide sequence and a mutant spectrum (Ruiz-Jarabo et al., 2000) . Therefore, RNA viruses reside on the edge of mutation crisis, and the increased average error frequency can cause defective genetic information and reduced viability termed error catastrophe (Crotty et al., 2000; Day et al., 2005) . Ribavirin has been shown to trigger catastrophic mutations including lethal mutations in a variety of viruses and these may accumulate as a virus goes through multiple rounds of replication, resulting in extinction of the viral population (Crotty et al., 2001; Contreras et al., 2002; Day et al., 2005; Lanford et al., 2001; Severson et al., 2003) . However, sequence analysis of the conserved N gene regions of PRRSV and PEDV in the ribavirintreated or untreated groups revealed that the two groups produced similar mutation frequencies (1.89/1.66 versus 2.42/1.24). These results were not surprising since RNA genomes mutate at average rates of 10 \u22123 -10 \u22125 per nucleotide copied during replication of RNA viruses by the virus-encoded RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) lacking proofreading functions (Drake and Holland, 1999) . Our data indicated that the antiviral activity of ribavirin against porcine nidoviruses may not be associated with error-prone replication by increasing the probability of ribavirin incorporation into the viral genome.",

            "text": "In conclusion, our findings described here demonstrated that ribavirin effectively prevents the replication of porcine nidoviruses in target cells at subcytotoxic doses. Additionally, the highest doses of ribavirin used in this study did not increase the frequency of mutations in the nidoviral genome, and instead affected intracellular GTP levels via IMPDH inhibition. Thus, we propose that one of the modes of action of ribavirin to elicit the antiviral effects against porcine nidoviruses occurs via GTP depletion, which may not work in concert with catastrophic mutations. Although further studies based on in vivo assessment are needed to evaluate the efficacy and safety of ribavirin, the results presented here indicate that it is a good candidate of choice for antiviral approach against porcine nidoviral diseases.",
