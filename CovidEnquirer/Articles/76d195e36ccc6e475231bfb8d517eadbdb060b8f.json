The formation constants of these complexes (expressed as lg K BHB \u00fe ) have been determined in two non-aqueous aprotic solvents with different polarity, i.e., acetone (AC) and acetonitrile (AN). It has been observed that tri-and tetra-substituted pyridine N-oxides [B] and their cationic acids [BH + ] form stable homocomplexed cations [BHB + ] stabilized by O\u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1H\u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1O bridges in both solvents used. It has been found that the most stable homocomplexed system is formed by 3,5dimethyl-4-chloropyridine N-oxide (3,5Me 2 4ClPyO). The lg K BHB \u00fe values for this compound in acetone and acetonitrile are 3.15 and 2.82, respectively. Furthermore, by using ab initio methods at the RHF and MP2 levels utilizing the Gaussian 6-31++G ** basis set, the energies of formation of the homocomplexed cations and Gibbs free energies have been determined in vacuo. The calculated energy parameters in vacuo have been compared with the cationic homoconjugation constants determined potentiometrically in acetone and acetonitrile to establish a correlation between these magnitudes. Additionally, the results of potentiometric measurements have been used to determine the acidity constants of the conjugate acids of N-oxides.",

Although, the term ''hydrogen bond'' has emerged in 1930 [1] , the basic idea of a weak and specific interaction involving the atoms of hydrogen is much older [2, 3] . This relatively weak chemical force, only about 10% as strong as covalent bonds, has a very important effect on the chemical and physical properties of water. It is responsible for the tertiary structure of proteins, and also plays an impor-tant role in biological systems, involving DNA [4] [5] [6] .

Moreover, Zi\u0119ba et al. [16] investigated substituted pyridine N-oxides as a novel generation of the radio-sensitizers as a drug that makes tumour cells more sensitive to radiation therapy. The search for new hypoxic cell-specific radio-sensitizers has shown that amine N-oxides are better compounds in radiotherapy of cancer than the most promising nitroimidazoles.

A reference calomel microelectrode was filled with 0.1 mol AE dm \u00c03 tetra-n-butylammonium chloride in non-aqueous solvent. All the E measurements were conducted at a constant ionic strength equal to 0.001 mol AE dm \u00c03 . This was kept stable by addition to the titrant of a salt solution in such a quantity as to equalize concentrations of both solutions. The titration cell initially contained 3 cm 3 of N-oxide perchlorate and was thermostatted (Lauda E 100). Concentrations of the titrant N-oxides were 10 \u00c02 mol AE dm \u00c03 and those of the perchlorate N-oxides were 10 \u00c03 mol AE dm \u00c03 . The titrant was added dropwise using a 2.5 cm 3 Hamilton syringe with an accuracy of 0.01 cm 3 . The potential difference (E) was recorded for each titration point, when the measured potential was stable (no potential changes were observed for 150 s). The same potentiometric-titration procedure was implemented in the electrode calibration, with tetra-n-butylammonium picrate in the titrand and mixture of this salt and picric acid in the titrant. In the calculations of the standard potential difference (E ) and slope (s), we used 11.0 [26] and 6.3 [27] as the values of pK a for picric acid in acetonitrile (AN) and acetone (AC), respectively. Solutions for potentiometric measurements were prepared on a volume basis. For each system studied, 4 to 5 independent titrations were performed.

The homoconjugation constants obtained in acetonitrile are by a factor of about (0.06 to 0.63) greater (on average 0.32) than values determined in other aprotic solvents (acetone) with a greater donor number. This confirms the general tendency that the range of homoconjugation involving N-oxides increases with the decreasing donor properties of the solvent. The smaller values of homoconjugation constants in acetone in relation to acetonitrile can be interpreted as being due to a stronger solvation of cationic acids (BH + ) constituents of the hydrogen-bonded complexes by the more basic acetone, thus weakening the hydrogen bonding. Consequently, based on the results of our previous [41] and present studies, the sequence of non-aqueous solvents classified according to the increasing strength of cationic homoconjugation of organic N-bases with conjugate cationic acids, can be arranged as follows: nitromethane > benzonitrile > acetonitrile > propylene carbonate > acetone > methanol > N 0 ,N 0 -dimethylformamide > dimethyl sulfoxide.",

These values (expressed as pK a values) are listed in table 3. It can be observed that they are characterized by relatively small standard deviations. The pK a values in acetone are relatively low, of order of 5 (the highest value 5.86 being for the 3,5Me 2 4BrPyO) and lower. This finding can be explained in terms of the presence of strong electronaccepting substituent (a halogen atom) at position 4. Furthermore, it is noteworthy that values of pK a in acetonitrile for the conjugate acids of N-bases are by more than ten orders of magnitude lower than those of carboxylic acids pK AN a values falling in the range 17 to 21 [42] , phenols pK AN a values are of the order of 16 to 27 [43] and only 1 to 2 orders of magnitude higher than those for mineral acids [44] , including sulphuric acid (pK AN a \u00bc 7:9), nitric and hydrochloric acid (pK AN a \u00bc 8:9 for both). In addition, the pK a values of the N-oxides studied in acetone (DN = 17) are by four orders of magnitude lower than those determined in acetonitrile (DN = 14.9), and two orders of magnitude higher than those in polar amphiprotic methanol (DN = 19.1 [19] ). This means that the strength of the cationic acids conjugated with the substituted pyridine N-oxides increases in the following series of solvents: AN < AC < MeOH, which is in agreement with the basicity of these solvents. Table 3 also shows the values of acidity constants for the N-oxides in aqueous solutions, pK W a . In view of missing experimental data in water, these constants were estimated from a linear relationship previously derived [45] for other pyridine N-oxides: pK AC a \u00bc 1:33pK W a \u00fe 4:32, taking into consideration the pK a values determined experimentally in acetone.",
