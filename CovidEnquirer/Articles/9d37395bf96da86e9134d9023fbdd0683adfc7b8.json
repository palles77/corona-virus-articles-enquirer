An anonymous behavioural questionnaire about MP use at hospital was administered to the HCWs of four adult and paediatric departments of a university hospital.",

Questionnaires from 114 HCWs (35 senior physicians, 30 residents, 32 nurses, 27 nurses' assistants) working either in adult (n = 58) or paediatric (n = 56) departments were analysed. Medical personnel used their PMP more frequently than paramedical HCWs (33/65 vs. 10/59, p <0.001). MPs were used during care more frequently in adult wards than in paediatric ones (46/58 vs. 27/56, p <0.001). Virus RNA was detected on 42/109 (38.5%) collected MPs, with RV found on 39, respiratory syncytial virus on three and metapneumovirus on one. The presence of virus RNA was significantly associated with MPs from the paediatric HCWs (p <0.001). MPs routinely used in hospital, even during care, can host virus RNA, especially RV. Promotion of frequent hand hygiene before and after MP use, along with frequent cleaning of MPs, should be encouraged.",

However, epidemic viruses such as influenza viruses, rotavirus (RV) and norovirus (NV) have been shown to be able to adhere and contaminate inert surfaces as well as medical devices close to the patients' environment [10] [11] [12] . NV and RV were shown to be particularly resistant; they can survive for weeks, even months, on surfaces and in the hospital environment [11, [13] [14] [15] [16] . Contamination of hospital surfaces by these viruses may therefore play a role in nosocomial epidemics [11, 13] . Respiratory viruses have been shown to persist on surfaces for a few days [14, 17] , with a potential role in nosocomial transmission, as emphasized during the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic of 2003 [18] . Epidemic viruses have already been retrieved from electronicdevice surfaces such as keyboards, computers and telephone handsets [10, 12, 17, [19] [20] [21] . However, the viral contamination of HCW MPs using up-to-date methods has not been studied.",

RV RNA was largely recovered from MPs, notably in those from the paediatric staff. This finding was concordant with epidemiologic data showing that RV is the prevalent virus during winter epidemics in the paediatric population, including during the time of this study (data not shown), because RV vaccination coverage is low in France [24] . RV has been frequently found on hospital surfaces for several months after the epidemic period and after the surfaces had been cleaned [11, 14, 15] . The high prevalence of RV in patients on the paediatric ward during the study, together with the capacity of RV to persist in the environment, are probably the main factors explaining the high frequency of RV RNA detection on MPs. It would be interesting to look at the presence of RV RNA on MPs outside the epidemic winter period. Despite NV RNA screening in our samples, it was not detected on MPs in this study. NVs are, however, largely known to be able to survive on several hospital surfaces [10, 13, 19] . The absence of NV RNA was probably due to the reduced circulation of NVs usually associated with benign diarrhoea in adults, and few patients infected with this pathogen may have been hospitalized in adult wards in the course of the study. Failure to detect NVs seems to be less probable, as we used internal controls in both RV and NV RT-qPCR assays in order to avoid false-negative results due to inhibitors [15] .",

These respiratory viruses could also survive on hands and on environmental surfaces [12, 17, 26] , leading to the risk of cross-transmission in hospital settings. The yield of contamination could be high because the same MP could be contaminated by several pathogens, as described in our study, and DECTs could be used by several HCWs. Although most HCWs are aware that MPs may carry pathogenic bacteria [4] , most of them do not perform hand hygiene before or after using MPs, and they do not regularly clean their MPs [8] . In the present study, all participating HCWs said they knew that MPs could be contaminated by viruses. However, most of them said they used PMPs and DECTs during their work, notably when they were in contact with patients. This was particularly true among adult staff. A large proportion also did not perform hand hygiene when using a MP, even during physical contact with patients, without difference among categories or departments. Hand hygiene should be performed just before patient contact, as highly recommended by World Health Organization guidelines (http://apps.who.int/iris/ bitstream/10665/44102/1/9789241597906_eng.pdf).",

Alcohol-based hand rubs and antiseptic wipes are largely available for all HCWs in our hospital; the lack of hand hygiene before and after using MPs and the lack of cleaning MPs is mostly related to poor adherence to hygiene recommendations by HCWs. Actually, hand washing with soap and the use of alcohol-based disinfectants have been proven to be efficient at removing viruses, especially respiratory ones, from artificially contaminated hands [27] . Gastroenteritis-associated nonenveloped viruses are, however, known to be more resistant to disinfection procedures [28] . Hydroalcoholic hand rub that passes the EN 14476 viral norm or specific tests is needed to kill NVs. However, RVs are sensitive to alcohol disinfection, meaning that the contamination of MPs by these viruses is certainly related to the fact that HCWs did not use alcohol-based hand rubs before using their MPs, rather than more intensive use. Indeed, paediatric MPs were found to be more frequently contaminated; paediatric HCWs used their MPs less frequently than adult HCWs. These results suggest that promotion of the cleaning of MPs should be performed more actively. Indeed, the use of isopropyl alcohol has been shown to be efficient in reducing contamination of fomites [29] ; disinfectant wipe intervention on fomites has also been demonstrated to reduce the load of infectious agents as well as the risk of fomite-to-finger microbial transfer [30] . These recommendations should be promoted in paediatric wards, where RVs circulate intensively during epidemics.",

The samples were not inoculated onto cell cultures for isolation of respiratory viruses, RV and NV being not cultivable [15] . However, this first demonstration of contamination of MPs by virus RNA should be considered as an effective way for the nosocomial transmission of these viruses, and notably of RVs in paediatric wards. Another limit concerns the absence of virus load determination on MPs by RT-qPCR, as has been done for food contamination [31] . However, to our knowledge, the correlation between virus load on inanimate surfaces and the risk of nosocomial transmission has not been clearly demonstrated. Finally, we were not able to show a correlation between the contamination of the MPs and the frequency of hand hygiene; the sample size of 30 workers, chosen to ensure the validity of the estimation per HCW category, was probably too low to permit the evaluation of this interaction.",

Our study indicates that more attention must be paid to disinfecting MPs that are largely used in clinical settings and that constitute a reservoir for viral agents. In addition, hand hygiene before and/or after their use must be recommended more strongly, especially in paediatric wards, where viruses may circulate intensively. Because restriction on the use of these devices is not feasible [5] , raising awareness in HCWs about the risk of pathogen transmission is urgent. Regular cleaning of MPs should be promoted. Beyond use of MPs, hand hygiene should be performed just before contact with patients.",

Regarding hand hygiene before or after use of MPs during care, there was no difference among categories. Paediatric staff disinfected their DECTs less frequently than adult staff (13/52 vs. 25/47, p <0.005). Seventy-eight HCWs (68.4%) halted patient care to answer their MP (their own MP or a shared MP). This proportion was significantly lower in paediatric staff than in adult staff (27/56 vs. 46/58, p <0.001). Among HCWs who stopped care to hang up a MP, 18 (23.1%) never performed hand hygiene after using the MP and before continuing care, with no significant difference among categories. RSV in three cases and hMPV in one case. NV RNA and influenza virus A and B RNA were not detected on MP samples of interviewed HCWs. One DECT sampled from a paediatric emergency room senior physician was found to be positive for both RSV and RV.",
