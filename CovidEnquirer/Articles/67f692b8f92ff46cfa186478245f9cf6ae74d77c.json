The occupant behaviors differ significantly from different building types with different functions and living habits. Based on a one-year field measurement in two general hospital wards in Nanjing, China, the effects of air quality (i.e. indoor CO 2 concentration and outdoor PM 2.5 concentration) and the climatic parameters (i.e. indoor/outdoor temperature, relative humidity, and outdoor wind speed, wind direction and rainfall) on window opening/closing behaviors are analyzed. Indoor air temperature or relative humidity is found to be a dominant factor for window opening behaviors. Seasonal differences are observed for the different influences of physical factors. The outdoor temperature is found to be associated with the window opening probability negatively during the cooling season, but positively during the transition and heating seasons. The indoor relative humidity positively affects the window opening probability during the transition season while a negative impact appears during the cooling and heating seasons. Based on the seasonal variation of window opening behaviors, Logistic regression models in different seasons (cooling, transition and heating seasons) are developed to predict the window opening/closing state and are verified to be promisingly adaptable with results of accuracy bigger than 70%.",

            "text": "In hospitals, a high ventilation rate has proven to be effective for reducing the cross-infection risk [1] [2] [3] . Natural ventilation can provide a much higher ventilation rate with proper utilization than mechanical ventilation, showing a great potential for controlling airborne infection [4] [5] [6] . Large ventilation openings were found to help reduce the infection risk of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndromes (SARS) among healthcare workers (HCWs) during the 2003 epidemics in Guangdong Province [7] . The occupants' window opening behaviors play a decisive role on the natural ventilation performance and significantly influence the airborne infection risk and indoor air quality (IAQ) [8] , as well as the energy consumption for air-conditioning systems [9] [10] [11] . Many factors are known to influence the window opening behaviors, including thermal-driven factors, time-related factors, environmentdriven factors, psychological factors and other uncertain factors [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] 34, 35] . Thermal-driven factors, including outdoor climate conditions, indoor air temperature and relative humidity, occupants' number, clothing condition, gender, etc., are recognized as the most important driving factors in many previous studies [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . Warren and Perkin [12] found that the outdoor air temperature accounted for 76% of the observed variance of window opening status in office buildings, with sunshine for 8% and wind speed for 4%. Fritch et al. [13] developed a stochastic model with outdoor temperature as the only variable based on data of four office rooms from October to May. No significant variations of window opening behaviors were found with wind speeds lower than 5-6 m/s, and its correlation with sunshine was only observed for the south-facing vertical openings [13] . A study in occupied buildings in the UK, Pakistan and throughout Europe suggested that the indoor temperature was a more coherent predictor for window-opening behaviors rather than the outdoor temperature [14] . Huang et al. [15] found that higher indoor temperature in residential buildings promoted people open windows more frequently in winter. Stazi et al. [16] suggested that the need of thermal comfort was a stronger driving factor for undertaking adaptive actions on windows than the need of improving air quality in classrooms. Time-related factors vary significantly among buildings with different functions. Haldi and Robinson [18] analyzed the window opening behaviors in office buildings and found the interactions with window opening had a significant correlation with occupants' commuter time because window opening or closing behaviors commonly occurred when occupants arrived at or leaved their offices. Besides, an attempt to take seasonal effects into consideration by adding a factor with 12 levels corresponding to each month of a year did not bring any significant improvement to the model. Barthelmes et al. [19] used K-S test to rank the influencing variables in residential apartment, and results turned out that the time of the day was the most important variable. Windows were opened and closed at certain times of the day (morning and late afternoon hours) regardless of the different day in a week. Jones et al. [20] investigated the impact of season on residential buildings for window opening/closing behaviors, finding that seasonality affected both frequency and drivers of window operation in bedrooms. Same simulation models to predict window operation behavior could be used in spring and autumn. Environment-driven factors, related to the indoor and outdoor environment quality, occupant's perceived illumination, awareness of environmental concern, cognitive resources, building structure and insulation, even geographic areas, are also important driven factors on occupants' interaction with windows [15, 16, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] . Andersen and Fabi [24] measured 15 Danish residential buildings of window opening behaviors and corresponding environmental conditions during winter, spring and summer. Results indicated that the indoor CO 2 concentration and outdoor temperature were the two single most important variables for window opening prediction. The indoor CO 2 concentration is regarded as a direct indicator for IAQ and ventilation performance since it is a good surrogate for bioeffuents, even for airborne infection risks [26] [27] [28] [29] . It is suggested that PM 2.5 is more hazardous than PM 10 as it is more likely to penetrate and deposit deeper in the tracheobronchial and alveolar regions [30] . In recent years, PM 2.5 pollution has been a predominant problem and caused great health burden in China [31, 32] . Previous study showed that the outdoor PM 2.5 concentration has become a highly concerned factor on residents' interaction with windows in China [25] . Therefore, outdoor PM 2.5 concentration can be taken as a representative parameter for outdoor air quality in China. Different geographic areas were also supposed to affect occupants' interactions with windows in office buildings [22, 25] . Shi and Zhao [25] conducted a field study in 8 naturally ventilated residential apartments in Beijing and Nanjing, and found that the window opening probability had different correlation strengths for the same variable in different cities, especially accounted for the outdoor PM 2.5 concentration. Besides, household size, disposable income and ethnicity are all found to be influential factors in residential buildings [33] .",

In office buildings, the window opening and closing behaviors are not only driven by thermal comfort needs but also driven by daily routine (time of the day) and habits (arriving and leaving time) [34] . In residential buildings, occupants' daily activities play an important role on window opening and closing behavior. Cooking, cleaning and getting fresh air accounted for 27%, 40% and 33% of the total openings respectively [35] . The day of week does not influence the window opening behavior in residential buildings [19] , which is different from that in office buildings. In classroom buildings, the daily routine is also an essential factor and students' interaction frequency with windows is higher during breaks [17] . Few researches are available on the window opening behaviors in hospitals, although many studies focusing on occupants' window opening behaviors have been carried out in residential, office and classroom buildings, etc. [12] [13] [14] [24] [25] [26] [36] [37] [38] . Studies on window opening behaviors are significantly important in hospital buildings compared to those in other buildings, as ventilation performance is crucial for infection control in hospitals. The interactions with windows in hospitals have the following different characteristics from that in other buildings.",

Secondly, patients may have different thermal comfort due to both health and clothing conditions. Nematchoua et al. [39] conducted an experimental study in 5 big hospitals and 50 shopping centers in Northern Madagascar and confirmed that the comfort temperature was slightly higher in shopping centers than that in hospitals due to the difference of subjects' activity and clothing conditions. Thirdly, the occupation period is mostly 24 h in hospital buildings, which makes the time-related factors differ from other buildings. Besides, the maximum window opening size is limited in many hospital wards for occupants' safety and security. Moreover, the IAQ requirement is generally higher in hospitals than those non-hospital environments. Finally but importantly, inpatients and HCWs would open windows sometimes to cater for their physical or psychological needs even when air-conditioning is on, although windows are usually advocated to be closed to save energy.",

The value exp(\u03b2 i ) is called odd ratio. An odd ratio bigger than unity means the explanatory variable x has a positive correlation with the dependent variable, while an odd ratio smaller than unity means the opposite. SPSS 21.0 statistical software was utilized for data analysis and logistic regression modeling. Correlation test and multi-collinearity diagnosis are carried out before developing logistic regression models as correlation and multicollinearity problems among variables would make the fitted regression coefficients instable and hard to explain [42] . If the absolute value of Pearson correlation coefficient is bigger than 0.7, the correlation between explanatory variables is indicated to be influential on the variation in regression coefficients. The variance inflation factor (VIF) is computed to assess the multi-collinearity in explanatory variables. A small VIF value (less than 5) means the multi-collinearity is negligible for explanatory variables. The\"Backward selection: LR (likelihood ratio)\" procedure is also used and the stepwise probability is 0.1 for removal. The explanatory variables with p-value less than 0.05 is recognized statistically significant. The Nagelkeike's R 2 and AUC (Area under ROC Curve) are calculated to estimate the goodness-of-fit of the models. Larger Nagelkeike's R 2 and AUC values suggest a better prediction performance. Influences of different explanatory variables within the same logistic model are identified by the absolute value of the standardized regression coefficient. A larger absolute value of the standardized regression coefficient means a greater impact of the explanatory variable on the dependent variable.

The top and the bottom scatters represent the maximum and minimum value, the ends of whiskers represent the 5th and 95th percentiles, the top and bottom of the boxes denote the 25th and 75th percentiles, and the dots and the horizontal lines within the boxes stand for the corresponding mean and median values respectively. A \"U\" shape was observed of the outdoor air temperature ranged from \u22122\u00b0C to 38.4\u00b0C, with the lowest value appeared in winter and the highest showed in summer, see Fig. 5(a) . The indoor air temperature showed the similar tendency as the outdoor air temperature. The annual average outdoor humidity was as high as 79.8%, which would strengthen the sense of chill in winter and heat in summer. The highest outdoor average relative humidity appeared in autumn, while the highest indoor average relative humidity showed in summer shown in Fig. 5(b) . The indoor relative humidity was generally lower than the outdoor one, especially in winter. The indoor air temperature and relative humidity between wards A and B showed great differences in winter and summer (air-conditioning seasons) and no significant differences in spring (transition season). Variation of the outdoor PM 2.5 concentration in Nanjing presented a low-high-low tendency during the measurement with an overall range from 0 to 319 \u03bcg/m 3 , lowest in summer and highest in winter, see Fig. 5 (c). The outdoor PM 2.5 concentration in Nanjing was substantially lower than that in some northern cities in China. Based on the results, 87% of the daily average PM 2.5 concentration during measurement satisfied the threshold value of the daily average PM 2.5 concentration stipulated by the current standard in China, i.e. 75 \u03bcg/m 3 [43] . According to Fig. 5(d) , the indoor CO 2 average concentration in ward A was lower than that in ward B in air-conditioning seasons, which was likely attributed to the 25 mm narrow gap on the window in ward A. Though the maximum opening width was only 190 mm in ward A, 79.1% of the CO 2 concentration during the one-year measurement was less than 1000 ppm, the average daily concentration given by Chinese IAQ standard [44] , indicating the huge potential for natural ventilation application in general hospitals. Wind speed did not vary by seasons significantly, see Fig. 5 (e). The variation range of wind speed was highest in winter, changing from 0 to 5.8 m/s. Fig. 6 shows variations of window opening size on a 10 min interval in wards A and B. No remarkable relationship between window opening behaviors and the time of the day or week were observed. Window opening behaviors differed in two adjacent wards even in the same period as corresponding indoor parameters including indoor air temperature, relative humidity and CO 2 concentration differing significantly. The interaction frequency with the window opening in ward B was found much higher than that in ward A. What's more, the windows were observed to be closed at most of the time in August, November to January, and March, which could partially have associated with the influenza seasons from January to March and July to August in Nanjing [45] . Fig. 7 shows the association between the measured thermal-driven (i.e. indoor/outdoor air temperature and relative humidity) and IAQdriven (i.e. indoor CO 2 concentration and outdoor PM 2.5 concentration) factors and the observed probability of window opening, which is the ratio of the number of data in window open state to the total number of data within the specified bandwidth. It is noticeable that some unexpected 0% or 100% values appeares mainly due to the sparsity of existing data corresponding to the specific bin width of explanatory variables. The correlation between the window opening proportion and explanatory variables varies with seasons. As shown in Fig. 7(a) , the probability of window opening tends to decrease with the outdoor air temperature in cooling season, as occupants are more likely to close windows to resist the heat with the high outdoor temperature. The window opening probability shows a positive correlation with the outdoor air temperature in transition season. In heating season, the overall trend of scatters goes up gradually. The outdoor temperature ranging from 20\u00b0C to 25\u00b0C could be the most comfortable as the corresponding values of window opening probability reaches the maximum in both air-conditioning and transition seasons. According to Fig. 7(b) , the window opening probability is proportional to indoor air temperature in cooling and transition seasons. In heating season, the data in the descending scatters accounted for 71% of the total data, which makes the overall influence negative on window opening behaviors. There is a peak and a valley on each curve representing data in transition and heating seasons, and the valley value might be the occupants' most comfortable indoor temperature, i.e. 23.2\u00b0C in transition season and 26.3\u00b0C in heating season. Fig. 7 (c) displays the relationship between window opening probability and outdoor relative humidity. In cooling season, the window opening probability decreases significantly with the increasing outdoor humidity as the high humidity strengthens the hot feeling. In transition season, scatters shows a trend of \"U\" type with a valley value of about 85%. Opening windows under a high outdoor relative humidity could introduce excess moistures into the indoor environment, which may promote the risk of indoor mold contaminations [46, 47] . In heating season, the relationship between window opening probability and outdoor relative humidity is a little vague under some confounders such as the outdoor air temperature, indoor air temperature and humidity. As shown in Fig. 7(d) , the window opening probability decreases as the outdoor relative humidity increases in cooling and heating seasons while the correlation between them shows just oppositely in transition season. No significant correlations are found between the window opening proportion and the outdoor PM 2.5 concentration in Fig. 7(e) . However, in residential buildings in Nanjing, the window opening proportion was reported to be negatively related with the outdoor PM 2.5 concentration [25] . It could be accounted for the difference between individual behaviors in residential buildings and collective behaviors in hospital buildings. The measuring period may also be responsible as Shi's measurements [25] were carried out in 2014 when the average outdoor PM 2.5 concentration was 73.8 \u03bcg/m 3 , while our study was conducted in 2016 and 2017 when the average outdoor PM 2.5 concentration was 44.6 \u03bcg/m 3 . Higher PM 2.5 concentration would degrade the visibility [48] and arouse people's awareness to prevent the bad outdoor air, e.g. closing the window, even though both of them are higher than the stipulated current standard value of yearly average PM 2.5 concentration in China, e.g. 35 \u03bcg/m 3 [44] . Scatters in Fig. 7 (f) shows variation trends in a \"U\" type of window opening proportion in all three seasons with a valley value of about 1500 ppm. When the indoor CO 2 concentration is below 1500 ppm, a negative correlation occurs between the indoor CO 2 concentration and the probability of window opening. The lower proportion of window opening is, the higher the indoor CO 2 concentration would be. When the indoor CO 2 concentration is above 1500 ppm, the correlation between indoor CO 2 concentration and window opening behavior become positive. The indoor CO 2 concentration may act as a result of window opening behaviors when the indoor CO 2 concentration is below about 1500 ppm and turn into a cause when the indoor CO 2 concentration is higher than 1500 ppm at which level occupants might feel uncomfortable in smell and breath. The correlation between wind speed and the window opening probability are shown in Fig. 7(g) . In cooling season, wind speed ranging from 0 to 4 m/s has a positive effect on the window opening probability. In transition season, wind speed ranging from 0 to 3.6 m/s has a negative impact on the window opening probability. In heating season, the correlation is positive when wind speed is lower than 2.6 m/s and negative when wind speed is higher than 2.6 m/s. The observed window opening probability is relatively high in prevailing wind direction (about 270\u00b0), see Fig. 7 (h).",

As inpatients and HCWs in hospital wards are uniformly dressed, the influences of occupants' clothing conditions on window opening and closing behavior are not concluded. Other individual factors that may influence the thermal comfort like obesity, gender, age are also ignored, as the objective of this study is the collective behavior of window opening and closing in hospital wards, which distinguishes from those in other private indoor environments. Among all samples of windows in open state, the samples of windows in ajar state accounted for 30% in ward A and as many as 90% in ward B. Occupants may choose to keep the window ajar when the outdoor thermal condition is undesirable but the needs of fresh air exists in indoor environment, indicating the significance of the ajar state in window opening behaviors in further studies, especially for large openings.",

The occupants' interaction with the window opening is affected by the adjustable window opening size. The window with large adjustable opening size is more likely in ajar state and the interaction frequency is much higher. The effects of indoor and outdoor physical variables on window opening behaviors varies significantly by seasons. The probability of window opening decreases with the increase of outdoor temperature during the cooling season but increases during the transition and heating seasons. The window opening probability increases with the indoor relative humidity during the transition season, but decreases during the cooling and heating seasons. Logistic regression models for different seasons are developed to predict the window opening/closing state in general hospital wards. The indoor air temperature or relative humidity is found to be a dominant factor for window opening behaviors in all seasons.
