            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) causes encephalitis and demyelination in the central nervous system (CNS) of susceptible rodents. Astrocytes are one of the major targets for MHV infection in the CNS, and respond to MHV infection by expressing diverse molecules that may contribute to CNS pathogenesis. Here we characterized the activation of an immediate-early transcription factor Egr-1 by MHV infection in an astrocytoma cell line. We found that the expression of Egr-1 was dramatically increased following virus infection. Using various inhibitors of mitogen-activated protein kinases, we identified that the extracellular signal-regulated kinases 1/2 were involved in the activation of Egr-1 transcription by MHV infection. Experiments with ultraviolet light-inactivated virus revealed that the induction of Egr-1 did not require virus replication and was likely mediated during cell entry. We further found that over-expression of Egr-1 suppressed the expression of BNip3, a pro-apoptotic member of the Bcl-2 family. This finding may provide an explanation for our previously observed down-regulation of BNip3 by MHV infection in astrocytoma cells (Cai, Liu, Yu, and Zhang, Virology 316:104-115, 2003). Furthermore, knockdown of Egr-1 by an siRNA inhibited MHV propagation, suggesting the biological relevance of Egr-1 induction to virus replication. In addition, the persistence/demylinating-positive strains (JHM and A59) induced Egr-1 expression, whereas the persistence/demylinating-negative strain (MHV-2) did not. These results indicate a correlation between the ability of MHVs to induce Egr-1 expression and their ability to cause demyelination in the CNS, which may suggest a potential role for the induction of Egr-1 in viral pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Murine coronavirus mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) is a member of the family Coronaviridae, which is a group of enveloped, single-stranded, and positive-sense RNA viruses. MHV utilizes its surface spike (S) glycoprotein to initiate infection by interacting with a specific cellular receptor (Williams et al., 1991) . This interaction triggers a conformational change of the spike, resulting in exposure of its fusogenic domain, which further triggers fusion between viral envelope and plasma membrane and subsequent release of the nucleocapsid into cytoplasm (Matsuyama and Taguchi, 2002) . In some MHV strains, virus entry occurs following receptor-mediated endocytosis (Nash and Buchmeier, 1997 ). The precise process of virus uncoating is not clear, but is believed to involve dephosphorylation of the nucleocapsid (N) protein and dissociation of N protein from viral genomic RNA (Kalicharran et al., 1996) . The incoming viral genomic RNA is then translated into the viral polymerase polyprotein of more than 800 kDa that is essential for subsequent viral replication and transcription.",

            "text": "MHV can infect rodents and cause hepatitis, nephritis, enteritis, and central nervous system (CNS) diseases (Sebesteny and Hill, 1974; Herndon et al., 1975) . In the CNS, MHV infection causes encephalitis and demyelination. Because the pathology of demyelination caused by MHV infection resembles those of multiple sclerosis (MS) seen in humans, MHV has been extensively used as an animal model for MS and other neurodegenerative diseases (Lampert et al., 1973; Herndon et al., 1977) . Following MHV infection, mice usually develop acute encephalitis and demyelination during the first week of infection (Woyciechowska et al., 1984) . Most of the viruses are cleared from the CNS at the end of the second week post- Virology 355 (2006) 152 -163 www.elsevier.com/locate/yviro infection (p.i.). If the mice survive the acute phase, chronic demyelination then develops and reaches to a peak at around 30 days p.i. At this time, however, infectious virus can no longer be isolated but viral RNAs are still detectable in the CNS (Fleming et al., 1993; Adami et al., 1995) . Viral RNA can persist in the CNS, especially in astrocytes, for an extended period of time (Adami et al., 1995; Perlman and Ries, 1987; Rowe et al., 1998) . Astrocytes play important roles in supporting the nervous system and controlling the chemical and ionic environment of the CNS. Astrocytes can be stimulated to produce diverse proinflammatory molecules such as cytokines, chemokines, and nitric oxide (Van Wagoner and Benveniste, 1999; Huang et al., 2000; Chen and Swanson, 2003) . It has been shown that MHV infection can induce the expression of transforming necrosis factor (TNF)-\u03b1, interleukin (IL)-6, matrix metalloproteinases, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) in astrocytes (Kyuwa et al., 1994; Joseph et al., 1993; Zhou et al., 2001; Grzybicki et al., 1997) . Infection of astrocytes with MHV may thus modulate the development of the CNS pathology and alter the course of the disease. In vitro, MHV can persist in the DBT astrocytoma cell line, in the progenitor oligodendrocyte/ astrocyte CG-4 cells and in a fibroblast 17Cl-1 cell line (Chen and Baric, 1995; Liu and Zhang, 2005; Maeda et al., 1995; Sawicki et al., 1995) . However, the precise mechanisms of viral persistence in animal CNS and in cultured cell lines are not known. Previous studies have suggested that alteration of receptor expression in DBT and 17Cl-1 cells by MHV infection may facilitate viral persistence (Chen and Baric, 1996; Porntadavity et al., 2001; Sawicki et al., 1995) . In our previous analysis on cellular gene expression in MHV-infected DBT cells using the DNA microarray technology, we suggested that alterations of the expression of cellular genes, in addition to the receptor down-regulation, might play an important role in establishing persistent infection in DBT cells .",

            "text": "One of such candidate cellular factors is the early growth regulator-1 (Egr-1). Egr-1 is also named as nerve growth factor induced-A (NGFI-A), zif268, TIS8, or Krox24, which is an immediate early gene, the prototype of a family of zinc-finger transcription factors (Waters et al., 1990; Changelian et al., 1989; Christy and Nathans, 1989; Varnum et al., 1989; Lemaire et al., 1990) . Egr-1 can be rapidly induced by diverse stimuli, including growth factors, hormones, cytokines, neurotransmitters and injurious stimuli through different mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) pathways, including the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK), c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinase (JNK), and p38 MAPK pathways depending on the stimuli (Sukhatme et al., 1988; Cao et al., 1990 Cao et al., , 1992 Lim et al., 1998; Milbrandt, 1987; Honkaniemi et al., 1995) . For example, Egr-1 gene expression is induced through ERK signal pathway by cytokines and growth factors, while it is induced via p38 and JNK pathways by stress treatment such as heat shock, sodium arsensite, ultraviolet, radiation, and anisomycin (Santiago et al., 1999; Liu and Zhang, 2005) . As a transcription factor, Egr-1 contains a DNA binding domain, which binds specifically to the consensus binding sequence GCG (T/G) GGGCG (Cao et al., 1990) . Egr-1 can induce the expression of a number of genes, such as platelet-derived growth factor (PDGF)-A and -B, macrophage colony-stimulating factor (M-CSF), TNF-\u03b1, IL-2, and intercellular adhesion molecule (ICAM)-1 (Delbridge and Khachigian, 1997; Khachigian et al., 1996; Harrington et al., 1991; Kramer et al., 1994; Skerka et al., 1995; Maltzman et al., 1996) . All of these genes contain one or more Egr-1 consensus binding sites within their promoter regions. Thus, Egr-1 is involved in regulation of a variety of cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, neuronal plasticity, vascular wound response, and cancer progression (Hill and Treisman, 1995; Nguyen et al., 1993; James et al., 2004; Khachigian et al., 1996; Kobayashi et al., 2002) . For examples, it has been demonstrated that astrocyte growth is regulated by neuro-peptides through basic fibroblast growth factor and Egr-1 (Hu and Levin, 1994; Biesiada et al., 1996) ; Egr-1 was significantly increased in prostate carcinoma and treatment with anti-Egr-1 anti-sense dramatically inhibited the prostate cancer progression, suggesting a role for Egr-1 in the development of prostate cancer (Eid et al., 1998; Baron et al., 2003a,b) .",

At 16 h p.i., the level of Egr-1 mRNA appeared to decline. In contrast, the level of \u03b2-actin mRNA remained relatively constant from 4 to 16 h p.i.

            "text": "The induction of Egr-1 was mediated by virus infection through the ERK signal pathway It has been previously reported that both p38 and JNK MAPKs were activated in DBT cells infected with MHV-JHM during viral replication (Banerjee et al., 2002) . It has also been shown that ERK was activated in peritoneal exudative macrophages at a very early time point of infection (5 min p.i.) with MHV-3 (McGilvray et al., 1998) . As described in the introduction, Egr-1 can be induced by all three MAPK pathways. It was therefore interesting to determine whether MHV-induced Egr-1 gene expression was mediated through one or more of the three MAPK signaling pathways. To address this question, we determined the activation of Egr-1 by MHV infection following the treatment of cells with inhibitors specifically inhibiting one of the three MAPK pathways. UO126 is the inhibitor of the ERK pathway, whereas SB203580 and SP600125 are the inhibitors of p38 and JNK pathways, respectively (Cuenda et al., 1995; Bennett et al., 2001; Favata et al., 1998) . DBT cells were treated with UO126 (25 \u03bcM or 50 \u03bcM), SB203580 (40 \u03bcM), SP600125 (40 \u03bcM), or DMSO (as a negative control) for 1 h prior to infection, during and throughout the infection. Cells were infected with MHV-JHM at an m.o.i. of 5 or mock-infected. Intracellular RNAs were harvested at 12 h p.i., and Egr-1 mRNAs were detected by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 3A , treatment of cells with UO126 at either concentration (25 \u03bcM or 50 \u03bcM) almost completely blocked the induction of Egr-1 by MHV infection. By contrast, treatment with SB203580 or SP600125 failed to block Egr-1 induction by MHV infection. To verify this finding, we used a Fig. 2 . Egr-1 mRNA expression was induced by both live and UV-irradiated viruses. DBT cells were infected with live or UV-irradiated MHV-JHM or mockinfected.

To provide direct evidence for the activation of the ERK pathway, we determined the phosphorylation status of ERK1 (p44) and ERK2 (p42) following MHV infection. Because it is well known that serum can stimulate ERK activation, DBT cells were subjected to serum-starvation for 24 h prior to virus infection. DBT cells were then infected with gradient-purified MHV-JHM at an m.o.i. of 5 or mock-infected. After 1 h binding at 4\u00b0C, the viral inoculums were removed. Cells were fed with fresh medium without serum and were incubated at 37\u00b0C. At various time points as indicated, cell lysates were prepared for determination of ERK1/2 phosphorylation by Western blot analysis. As shown in Fig. 4 , although ERK1/2 phosphorylation was detected in both virus-infected and mock-infected cells at all time points p.i., the levels of phosphorylation were significantly higher in virus-infected cells than in mock-infected cells from 5 to 120 min p.i. Moreover, no increase in ERK1/2 phosphorylation was detected in virusinfected cells at 0 min p.i.

A recent report showed that BNip3 gene expression was down-regulated by over-expression of Egr-1 in prostate cancer cells (Virolle et al., 2003) . Therefore, it is of interest to determine whether the down-regulation of BNip3 in MHV-infected DBT cells is also mediated through the induction of the transcription factor Egr-1. First, we determined the BNip3 promoter activity by using the luciferase reporter assay . We expressed Egr-1 protein transiently in DBT cells by cotransfecting pBS-CMV-Egr-1, which contains the Egr-1 ORF under the control of a CMV promoter, and pGL3-BNip3 reporter plasmid (Bruick, 2000; Cai et al., 2003) . After 20 h post-transfection, cell lysates were harvested and luciferase activity determined. Results showed that transient cotransfection with an increased amount of Egr-1-expressing plasmid (ranging from 20 to 500 ng per well) exhibited an increased inhibitory effect on BNip3 promoter activity by 2 to 45% (Fig. 5A ). This inhibition appeared to be specific for Egr-1 because cotransfection with the empty vector pBS-CMV (without expressing the Egr-1) did not have any effect on luciferase activity (Fig. 5A) . The specific inhibitory effect of the expressed Egr-1 on pGL3-BNip3 reporter was further examined in a cotransfection experiment, in which pBS-CMV-Egr-1 or pBS-CMV and the pSV-\u03b2-gal reporter plasmid (which is under the control of an SV40 promoter) were cotransfected into DBT cells. At 24 h posttransfection, \u03b2-gal activity was determined. In stark contrast to the result for pGL3-BNip3 reporter (Fig. 5A) , the \u03b2-gal activity was virtually unaffected by the expression of Egr-1 (Fig. 5B ). Fig. 4 . Activation of ERK signaling pathway by MHV infection. DBT cells were infected with purified MHV-JHM at an m.o.i. of 5 or mock-infected. After 1 h binding at 4\u00b0C, the viral inoculums were removed and fresh medium without serum were added to the plates. The cells were harvested and lysed following incubation at 37\u00b0C for various time points p.i. as indicated. Equal amounts of cell lysates were separated by polyacrylamide gel (10%) electrophoresis. Proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membranes and were detected with an antibody specific for phosphorylated-forms of ERK1/2 (ERK1/2-P) and enhanced chemiluminescence by Western blot analysis. An aliquot of an equal amount of cell lysates from each sample was used for analyzing total ERK1/2 (ERK1/2-T) with an antibody specific for ERK1/2 as an internal control. The data are representative of three independent experiments. M, lysates from mockinfected cells; V, lysates from MHV-JHM-infected cells. Thus, over-expression of Egr-1 selectively inhibited BNip3 promoter activity.",

Clone #2, termed Egr-1-2, expressed higher level of Egr-1 protein than clone #1, termed Egr-1-1, which expressed almost the same amount of Egr-1 protein as the cells stably transfected with the empty vector pcDNA3 plasmid (Fig. 5C ). Equal numbers of these cloned cells were cotransfected with pGL3-BNip3 reporter plasmid and pSV-\u03b2-gal plasmid, the latter of which served as a control for transfection efficiency as well as for specificity. At 24 h post-transfection, luciferase and \u03b2-gal activities in the cells were determined, and the luciferase activity was normalized to \u03b2-gal activity, which was essentially unaffected by the cotransfection. As shown in Fig. 5D , BNip3 promoter activity was decreased approximately 45% in Egr-1-2 clone, while it decreased only 7% in Egr-1-1 clone as compared to those in vector-control cells (lane pcDNA3). These results demonstrate that over-expression of Egr-1 repressed the expression of the pro-apoptotic BNip3 gene, thus suggesting that the previously observed down-regulation of BNip3 expression in DBT cells by Fig. 5 .

Cells were transfected with an Egr-1-siRNA or a non-specific EGFP-siRNA, the latter of which serves both as a negative control and for monitoring the transfection efficiency. At various times post-transfection, the protein level of Egr-1 was monitored by Western blot analysis. A representative result obtained at 60 h post-transfection is shown in Fig. 6A . In the absence of virus infection, the Egr-1 level was significantly lower in Egr-1-siRNA-transfected cells than in EGFP-siRNAtransfected cells, demonstrating the effectiveness and specificity of the Egr-1-siRNA. Similarly, Egr-1 expression was effectively blocked by Egr-1-siRNA but not by EGFP-siRNA even in the presence of virus infection. Egr-1 protein was much higher in virus-infected cells than in mock-infected cells when the cells were transfected with the EGFP-siRNA, further confirming that MHV infection induces Egr-1 expression. We then determined the effect of Egr-1 knockdown on virus propagation. Indeed, knockdown of Egr-1 expression by Egr-1-siRNA exhibited a detrimental effect on virus propagation, reducing the virus titer by approximately 2 log10 (Fig. 6B) . Interestingly, apoptotic cells were increased in virus-infected, Egr-1 knockdown cells as compared to the control cells that were transfected with the EGFP-siRNA (Fig. 6C ). Although the increase was statistically significant (p = 0.037), the level of the increase was extremely low, which may result from a number of factors. For example, in Effect of Egr-1-siRNA on Egr-1 expression. DBT cells were transfected with Egr-1-siRNA or EGFP-siRNA for 60 h, and then infected with MHV or mock-infected with PBS. Cells were lysed at 16 h p.i. and proteins were detected by Western blot with anti-Egr-1 or anti-\u03b2-actin antibodies (A). Virus titers were determined by virus plaque assay at 16 h p.i. and were expressed as mean \u00b1 standard deviation (SD) of three experiments (B). (C) Apoptosis was assessed by determining the apoptotic nuclei following propidium iodide staining, and was expressed as mean percentage of the cell population and SD of three experiments. Statistical analysis indicates significance between the Egr-1 knockdown cells and the control cells (p = 0.037).",

The intensity of each band was quantified and the relative quantity was expressed as a ratio of Egr-1 to \u03b2actin (E/A ratio) for each sample. siRNA-expressing cells, not only was Egr-1 much lower (Fig.  6A) but also was the virus replication (Fig. 6B ). Thus, very low level of virus replication might not be able to induce robust apoptosis. Nevertheless, these results indicate that Egr-1 may play a role in virus replication and cell survival.",

To test the hypothesis in cell culture that cellular gene expression altered by MHV infection may contribute to the control of virus replication and persistence in CNS cells and consequently to viral pathogenicity, we determined whether MHV strains with distinctive pathogenic phenotypes have different abilities to induce Egr-1 expression. DBT cells were infected with different strains of MHV (including MHV-JHM, -A59 and MHV2) or mock-infected. Total intracellular RNAs were isolated at different time points p.i. as indicated, and the RNA level of Egr-1 gene was determined by RT-PCR. As shown in Fig. 7A , Egr-1 mRNA was induced (approximately 3 fold) by both MHV-JHM and MHV-A59 at 8, 12, and 16 h p.i., but not at 4 h p.i. In contrast, infection with MHV-2 failed to induce Egr-1 expression as compared to those of mockinfected cells (compare lanes 4, 8, 12, and 16 with lanes 1, 5, 9, and 13 in Fig. 7A ). We also performed Western blot to detect the protein expression. As presented in Fig. 7B , Egr-1 protein was significantly increased in both JHM-and A59infected cells (\u2248 11-and 7-fold increase, respectively) but not in MHV-2-infected cells. These data provide evidence that correlates the ability of the MHV strains to induce Egr-1 expression with their ability to cause persistent infection in the CNS cells and demyelinating disease in the animal CNS.",

            "text": "How is the Egr-1 expression induced by virus infection? In HTLV-transformed cells, it appears that the Tax protein is responsible for the induction of Egr-1 expression (Fujii et al., 1991) . As a transactivator, Tax can interact with the transcription factor CREB/ATF and serum response factors (SRFs) (Suzuki et al., 1993; Fujii et al., 1992) . These factors in turn interact with the CREB/ATF response element (CRE) and serum response element (SRE), respectively, on the promoter of Egr-1, thus activating the expression of Egr-1 (Fujii et al., 1991; Sakamoto et al., 1992) . In the case of MHV-infected cells, we demonstrated the activation of ERK by MHV infection and the inhibition of Egr-1 expression by the MEK1/2 inhibitors (Figs.  4 and 3) . Our results thus suggest that the induction of Egr-1 expression upon MHV infection is likely mediated through the ERK signaling pathway. It is well established that the activation of ERK can activate its downstream transcription factor Elk, which then interacts with SRFs and activates a number of immediate-early genes whose promoters contain an SRE. Therefore, we postulate that the induction of Egr-1 by MHV infection might follow the ERK1/2 \u2192 Elk \u2192 SRFs \u2192 Egr-1 pathway. The upstream signal(s) that activates ERK1/2 has not been determined in this study although the inhibitor that we used to block ERK activation acts on the upstream kinase MEK1/2. Nevertheless, our data suggest that the upstream signal(s) most likely resides within or in the vicinity of the cytoplasm membranes, which is activated during virus entry. There are two pieces of evidence supporting this interpretation. First, infection with UV-inactivated virus was still capable of inducing Egr-1 transcription (Fig. 2) . Second, ERK1/2 was activated within 5 min upon virus entry and during the first 2 h p.i. (Fig. 4) . Although live virus is a stronger inducer for Egr-1 expression than UV-inactivated virus, ERK1/2 activation was no longer detected at 3 h following infection (data not shown). This suggests that although virus replication may play a role in the induction of Egr-1 activation, the predominant signal that activates Egr-1 expression is likely triggered during cell entry. Activation of ERK1/2 has also been observed between 5 and 45 min p.i. in peritoneal exudative macrophage infected with MHV-3 (McGilvray et al., 1998) . Although Banerjee et al. (2002) did not detect ERK1/2 activation after 2 h p.i., they did not perform the same experiments at earlier time points.",

One of the potential consequences is to facilitate virus replication in the host cells. Indeed, knockdown of Egr-1 by siRNA significantly impaired MHV propagation (Fig. 6B ). It has also been reported that there is a good correlation between Egr-1 and viral RNA expressions in the mouse brains infected with Rabies and Borna disease viruses, which raises the possibility that Egr-1 expression may induce some phenotypic changes in neurons that render them more susceptible to viral replication (Fu et al., 1993) . The other potential consequence of Egr-1 induction is to promote host cell proliferation and survival. It has been suggested that the induction of Egr-1 expression in EBV-infected B lymphocytes, in EBV-transformed lymphoma and in HTLV-transformed cell lines, may facilitate cell growth and may play a role in tumorigenesis (Calogero et al., 1996; Fujii et al., 1991; Sakamoto et al., 1992) . It has also been suggested that the expression of Egr-1 may change the phenotype of the infected cells, which may help KHSV to establish latency (Sun et al., 2001) . By analogy, the induction of Egr-1 by MHV infection may also facilitate the survival of the infected cells, thereby promoting the establishment of MHV persistence in glial cells. In support of this hypothesis is our finding that over-expression of Egr-1 suppresses the expression of the pro-apoptotic gene BNip3 (Fig. 5) that is down-regulated by MHV infection as demonstrated in our previous study , whereas knockdown of Egr-1 leads to apoptosis when cells are infected with MHV (Fig. 6C) .",

Both JHM and A59 are able to cause acute encephalitis and demyelination and persistence in the CNS, whereas MHV-2 cannot. Recent studies from our laboratory and others suggest that the ability of MHV strains to cause acute encephalitis is correlated with their ability to induce proinflammatory cytokines, particularly TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6, in primary mouse astrocytes and microglia (Li et al., 2004; Yu and Zhang, in press) . Interestingly, an Egr-1 binding site has been found in the TNF-\u03b1 promoter region; it has also been shown that lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced expression of TNF-\u03b1 was mediated through the activation of Egr-1 by ERK1/ 2 in macrophage (Kramer et al., 1994; Shi et al., 2002) . Our most recent study indicated that infection of primary mouse astrocytes with JHM also induced Egr-1 expression (Cai and Zhang, unpublished results) . It remains to be seen whether Egr-1 is involved in regulation of TNF-\u03b1 induction by MHV infection in these cells. In addition, it has been shown previously that there is a general correlation between MHV persistence and demyelination disease in the mouse CNS (Das Sarma et al., 2000) , which is also correlated with the ability of MHV strains to induce Egr-1 expression as found in this study. However, a firm establishment of such a correlation requires further extensive experimentations in animals, i.e. using Egr-1 gene-knockout mice. Nevertheless, our current observation may offer some interesting clues for future investigation on the mechanism by which signal transduction pathways are differentially regulated by MHV strains.",

At various time points postinfection (p.i.), intracellular total RNAs were isolated and purified with the Trizol reagent (Invitrogen) according to the protocol from the manufacturer. RNAs were then treated with RNase-free DNase I (Promega) to remove the contaminated genomic DNAs. The concentrations of the RNA samples were determined by spectrophotometry (Hitatchi, Model 2100). Maloney murine leukemia virus (MMLV) reverse transcriptase (Promega) was used to reverse-transcribe the RNAs into cDNAs with a random hexomer oligonucleotide primer (Invitrogen) in a standard RT reaction as described previously (Zhang et al., 1991) . cDNAs were then used as templates for PCR amplification with two pairs of primers specific for Egr-1 gene and \u03b2actin gene (as an internal control), respectively. The sense primer for Egr-1 (5\u2032Egr-1RT: 5\u2032-ATG GCA GCG GCC AAG GCC-3\u2032) corresponds to a sequence at nucleotide (nt) 1-18 of the open reading frame (ORF), and the anti-sense primer (3\u2032Egr-1-RT: 5\u2032-GGG TAC GGT TCT CCA GAC CCT-3\u2032) is complementary to a sequence at nt 818-838 according to the published sequence (GenBank accession number: NM007913). The PCR product is 838 nt in length. The primer pair for \u03b2-actin is 5\u2032mb-actin (5\u2032-ACC AAC TGG GAC GAT ATG GAG AAG A-3\u2032, corresponding to the sequence at nt 229-253) and 3\u2032mbactin (5\u2032-TAC GAC CAG AGG CAT ACA GGG ACA-3\u2032, complementary to a sequence at nt 418-442 of the \u03b2-actin gene) (GenBank accession number: NM007393). The PCR product for the \u03b2-actin gene is 214 nt in length. PCR was carried out in a reaction of 20 \u03bcl containing 1\u00d7 PCR buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8.3, 25 mM KCl, 1.5 mM MgCl 2 , 0.1% Tween-20), 200 \u03bcM each of the four dNTPs, 20 pM of primers, 3 U of Taq DNA polymerase, and 2 \u03bcl of the RT products as templates for 30 cycles with each cycle consisting of denaturing at 95\u00b0C for 20 s, annealing at 55\u00b0C for 1 min, and extension at 72\u00b0C for 1 min with a final extension of 10 min. PCR was performed in a thermocycler DNA Engine (Model PTC-200, MJ Research). PCR products were analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis, and the gels were stained with ethidium bromide and photographed with a UVP gel document center.",

The lysates were sonicated 3 times for 20 s each on ice. The protein concentration was measured by using Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad, CA). Equal amounts of cell lysates were boiled for 5 min, chilled on ice, and pelleted by centrifugation before loading onto gels. Proteins were separated by SDS-polyacrylamide gel (10%) electrophoresis (PAGE). The proteins were then transferred to nitrocellulose membrane (MSI, Westborough, MA) for 7 h at 40 V in a transfer buffer (25 mM Tris, 200 mM glycine, 20% methanol, 0.02% SDS). After being blocked with 5% skim milk in Tris-buffered saline (TBS) for 1 h at room temperature (RT), the membrane was washed three times in TBS containing 0.5% Tween-20 and immunoblotted with a primary antibody (1 \u03bcg/ml) for 2 h at RT, followed by a secondary antibody coupled to horseradish peroxidase (1:1000 dilution) (Sigma) for 1 h at RT.

The DNA-lipofectAmine mixture (200 \u03bcl) was added to each well and the cell culture plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C for various time periods as indicated. For luciferase assay, cells were harvested along with culture medium and lysed by freezing and thawing. The cell lysate (100 \u03bcl) was assayed for luciferase activity using the luciferase assay system (Promega) in a microtiter plate luminometer (Dynex Technologies). For \u03b2-galactosidase assay, the medium was removed and the monolayers were washed twice with PBS after 24 h post-transfection. The cells were harvested into microfuge tubes by scraping the cells. The cells were recovered by centrifugation at 12,000\u00d7g for 10 s at RT. 125 \u03bcl lysis buffer (0.25 M Tris-HCl, pH 8.0) was added into the tubes.

These treated cells were then infected with MHV-JHM at an m.o.i. of 5 or mock-infected. At 12 h p.i., the intracellular RNAs were isolated and were subjected to RT with a random primer. cDNAs were amplified by PCR using the primer pair specific to Egr-1 or \u03b2-actin (as an internal control). The drugs were present in the medium throughout the 12 h period. The data are representative of three independent experiments. M, RNAs from mock-infected cells; V, RNAs from MHV-JHM infected cells.
