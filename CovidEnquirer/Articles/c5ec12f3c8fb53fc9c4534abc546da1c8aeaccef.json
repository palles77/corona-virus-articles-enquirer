However, it is now accepted that this family of inhibitors can also affect the activity of cell proteases. Since the replication of many virus species requires the activity of host cell proteases, investigating the effects of PIs on the life cycle of viruses other than HIV would be of interest. Here, the potent inhibition induced by saquinavir and nelfinavir on the replication of both vesicular stomatitis and influenza viruses is described. These are unrelated enveloped RNA viruses infecting target cells upon endocytosis and intracellular fusion. The PIinduced inhibition was apparently a consequence of a block at the level of the fusion between viral envelope and endosomal membranes. These findings would open the way towards the therapeutic use of PIs against enveloped RNA viruses other than HIV.",

            "text": "HIV protease inhibitors (PIs) are a family of small molecules specifically designed for blocking the activity of the HIV aspartylprotease (for a review, see Flexner, 1998) . The PI treatment leads to the block of HIV maturation with consequent release of noninfectious viral particles (Kaplan et al., 1993) . PIs exert their inhibitory effect by disabling the enzyme before it can cleave the Gag-Pol polyprotein into its essential products. PIs, together with anti-HIV compounds targeting alternative steps of the virus life cycle, are part of the most advanced anti-HIV therapies allowing millions of infected people to co-exist with the virus experiencing a good quality of life. However, it is now clear that PIs can also directly or indirectly inhibit the activity of many cell proteases. In particular, PIs can inhibit the activity of both 20S (Andr\u00e9 et al., 1998) and 26S (Pajonk et al., 2002) proteasome subunits, as well as that of caspases (Badley, 2005) , with alterations in the susceptibility to apoptosis stimuli. Both expression and release of matrixmetalloproteinases (MMPs) can be also targeted by PIs (Bourlier et al., 2005; De Barros et al., 2007) with consequences in the extracellular matrix modeling and, more in general, in the cell-cell communication. In addition, PIs have been found inhibiting cell signaling pathway involving both NF-\u03baB (Dewan et al., 2009 ) and AKT (Kumar et al., 2009; Srirangam et al., 2006) . From a clinical point of view, the PI treatment may induce beneficial effects other than those against HIV, as in the case of Kaposi sarcoma regression (Sgadari et al., 2002) , but can also have detrimental consequences, as for the dyslipidemia occurring in PI-treated HIV patients (Calza et al., 2004) .",

In this latter case, low pH is required to induce the fusion between viral envelope and endosomal membranes, a phenomenon leading to the release of virion contents into cytoplasm. Although the viral fusion process is guided by the presence of viral envelope proteins, the contribution of cell proteins is critical. Using RNA interference as a tool for gene expression inhibition, it was demonstrated that several cell proteins are involved in the mechanism of entry of many viruses including HIV-1 Nguyen et al., 2006) , influenza (Hao et al., 2008) , west Nile (Krishnan et al., 2008) , Borna disease (Clemente et al., 2010) , human hepatitis C (Ng et al., 2007) , and vesicular stomatitis (VSV) (Pelkmans et al., 2005) viruses.

Hence, PIs do not affect the amounts of HIV release from infected cells, but dramatically decrease their infectivity. Surprisingly enough, however, the HIV-1 release from cells infected with HIV-1 pseudotyped with the envelope protein from VSV (VSV-G) has been found inhibited by PIs in single cycle replication assays. In fact, when CEM GFP cells, i.e., a human T CD4 + lymphoblastoid cell line expressing GFP under the control of HIV-1 LTRs (Gervaix et al., 1997) , were infected with 100 ng HIV-1 CAp24 equivalent/10 5 cells of (VSV-G) \u0394env HIV-1, decreased percentages of HIV-1 expressing cells were observed in ritonavir-treated cells as compared to control conditions (Fig. 1A) . The outcome did not change by challenging the cells with doses up to 300 ng HIV-1 CAp24 equivalent/10 5 cells (not shown). Conversely, and as expected, the PI-treatment had no apparent effects on single cycle replication of non-pseudotyped HIV-1, as tested in PI-treated cultures of CEM GFP cells infected with wt HIV-1 (Fig. 1B) . In these experiments, the presence of T-20 (i.e., a potent inhibitor of the HIV-1 Env-mediated fusion) (Kilby et al., 1998) added 16 h after challenge ensured that the wt HIV-1 replication was limited to a single cycle. As anticipated, ritonavir blocked the spread of wt HIV-1 in multiple-cycle replication assay (Fig. 1B) .",

This viral mutant expresses a PI-resistant viral protease as a consequence of the four amino acid substitutions in the protease gene, i.e., M 46 I , L 63 P , V 82 T , and I 84 V (Condra et al., 1995) . First, the real resistance to PIs of PM4 HIV-1 was checked by evaluating the percentages of CEM GFP infected cells 6 days after the infection in the presence or not of ritonavir (Fig. 1C) . Then, CEM GFP cells treated with T-20 were infected with (VSV-G) PM4 HIV-1 in the presence or not of ritonavir. This experimental setting was representative of a singlecycle replication assay since T-20 disabled both HIV-1 Env-mediated viral entry and possible cell re-infections. Similarly to what observed with (VSV-G) \u0394env HIV-1 strain, a significant inhibitory effect of ritonavir on the HIV-1 expression was detected in (VSV-G) PM4 challenged cells (Fig. 1D ). This strongly suggests that the viral protease activity was not involved in the PI-induced inhibition of (VSV-G) HIV-1 expression.",

To this end, HeLa cells were pre-treated overnight with different concentrations of six PIs, i.e., ritonavir, indinavir, saquinavir, nelfinavir, amprenavir and atazanavir. Then, the cells were challenged with 0.2 m.o.i. of VSV. After 1 h of adsorption in a small volume, the viral inoculum was removed, the cells extensively washed, and incubated for additional 8 h in the presence of PIs. Afterwards, the supernatants were harvested and titrated for the amounts of infectious VSV. As depicted in Figs. 2A-B, a strong reduction of VSV replication (more than 2 logs) was observed when the cells were treated with 2.5 \u03bcM saquinavir and nelfinavir. The inhibitory effect appeared more potent (up to about 4 logs) by increasing the concentration of these PIs to 10 \u03bcM, and remained significant (i.e., more than 1 log) by increasing the m.o.i. up until 1 (not shown). No differences were observed when the PIs pretreatment was carried out for 2, 4, 6, or 8 h (not shown). As calculated through a wide dose-response curve, the 50% inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) values of saquinavir and nelfinavir were 1.4 and 1.1 \u03bcM, respectively. On the other hand, significant inhibition of viral replication were detected in ritonavir and indinavir treated cells starting to the concentrations of 20-30 \u03bcM (Fig. 2B) .

To this aim, the well characterized influenza virus/MDCK cell system was considered. MDCK cells were treated overnight with different PIs, and then challenged with m.o.i. 0.1 and 0.5 of the PR8 influenza virus. After challenge, the cells were extensively washed, and reseeded in medium without serum in the presence of both PIs and tosylamido-2-phenil ethyl chloromethyl ketone (TPCK)-treated trypsin. Twenty-four h later (i.e., the expected time for the completion of the replication cycle of influenza virus) (Sidorenko and Reichl, 2004; Smith and Ribeiro, 2010) , the supernatants were harvested and titrated for the contents of infectious particles. A strong inhibition of the replication of influenza virus (up to 4 logs at the lower m.o.i.) has been detected with 10 \u03bcM saquinavir and 5 \u03bcM nelfinavir (Fig. 3A) . Ritonavir inhibited the viral replication less efficiently (Fig. 3A) , while indinavir, amprenavir and atazanavir appeared ineffective (not shown). In the interpretation of these data, it should be emphasized that the inhibitory effect of PIs cannot be a consequence of a PI-induced impairment of the activation of the hemagglutinin envelope protein (HA) of the influenza virus, which is a step required for productive infection (Steinhauer, 1999) . In fact, influenza virus preparations used for challenges were exclusively recovered from the allantoic fluid of embryonated chicken eggs, where HA is cleaved by egg proteases. Consistently, TPCK-trypsin did not influence the infectivity of the virus preparations in single cycle replication assay (not shown).",

VSV, and (VSV-G) HIV-1 in an HIV-1 protease independent manner, further supported the idea that PIs would influence some common early replication step, e.g., virus attachment, endocytosis, and/or endosomal fusion. To dissect among these different possibilities, the intracellular fate of challenging virus was followed using GFP-labeled HIV-1-based VLPs (Muratori et al., 2006) pseudotyped with either wt or fusiondefective VSV-G (Fig. 6A) . The fluorescence of these VLPs relies on the high incorporation levels of the product of fusion between GFP and a HIV-1 Nef mutant acquiring a palmitoylation site at its N-terminus as the consequence of the G to C substitution at the amino acid 3. First, the possible effects of PIs on the virus attachment on target cells were investigated. To this end, 10 5 HeLa cells treated or not with PIs were challenged with 500 ng of (wt VSV-G) Nef G3C -GFP VLPs for 1 h at 4\u00b0C. Afterwards, the cells were extensively washed and FACS analyzed. To control that the cell-associated fluorescence was not a consequence of endocytosed VLPs, a part of the cell samples was treated with trypsin. It appeared that the treatment with PIs did not significantly affect the cell binding of fluorescent VLPs (Fig. 6B ). This strongly suggests that PIs do not interfere with the binding of viral particles on the cell membrane.",

To this aim, GFP-fluorescent VLPs incorporating a VSV-G mutant (here referred to as fd VSV-G) unable to support the pH-dependent fusion were used. The impaired fusion activity was a consequence of the A to K amino acid substitution at the position 133 (Fredericksen and Whitt, 1995) . The use of this envelope protein mutant was associated with the trypsin treatment just before the FACS analysis to ensure that the cell-associated fluorescent signal exclusively referred to the intracellular accumulation of VLPs. HeLa cells treated or not with PIs were challenged with 500 ng HIV-1 CAp24 equivalents of (fd VSV-G) Nef G3C -GFP VLPs/10 5 cells, and incubated for 3 h at 37\u00b0C in the presence or not of PIs. Then, the cells were treated with trypsin, and the cell-associated GFP fluorescence was evaluated by FACS analysis. As control, VLP-challenged cells were incubated at 4\u00b0C before the trypsin treatment. Again, no apparent differences in the cellassociated fluorescence were detected between control and PI-treated cells (Fig. 6C) , suggesting that PIs have no influence on the efficiency of the endocytosis of viral particles. This conclusion was enforced by the results obtained through an alternative experimental approach where control or PI-treated HeLa cells were infected with 0.2 pfu/cell of VSV. Thirty and 60 min later, the cells were extensively washed, treated with trypsin to leave out non-adsorbed viral particles, lysed, and analyzed by western blot for the presence of VSV-G. No significant reduction of the VSV-G specific signals was detectable at both time points in PI-treated cells as compared to control conditions (Fig. 6D) . Considering that the neosynthesis of VSV-G starts at least 90 min post-infection (Rothman and Lodish, 1977) , these results, consistently with the data obtained with fluorescent VLPs, suggest that PIs do not affect the endocytosis of viral particles.",

To this end, the differences in the cell-associated fluorescence levels in cells internalizing wt or fd VSV-G pseudotyped Nef G3C -GFP VLPs were exploited. In fact, using the same experimental conditions described for the endocytosis assay, it was reproducibly observed that, early after VLP challenge, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of cells challenged with (wt VSV-G) VLPs was near 2-fold higher than that of cells treated with (fd VSV-G) VLPs. More significantly, in the latter condition both percentages of fluorescent cells and MFI heavily dropped 16 h after challenge. On the contrary, both FACS parameters appeared only slightly reduced in cells challenged with (wt VSV-G) VLPs (Fig. 7A ). These differences can be explained by the fact that, due to the inability of fd VSV-G to induce fusion and delivery of the VLP contents into cytoplasm, the Nef G3C -GFP molecules incorporated in (fd VSV-G) VLPs were addressed to rapid degradation into the endosomal/lysosomal compartment. Conversely, the efficient fusion between viral envelope and endosome membranes induced by wt VSV-G allowed the release of Nef G3C -GFP molecules into cytoplasm, where they are expected to be degraded with a kinetic much slower than that operating in endosomes/lysosomes.",

FACS analysis of the cell-associated GFP fluorescence revealed that the PI treatment did not affect the fluorescence levels in cells challenged with (fd VSV-G) Nef G3C -GFP VLPs at both time points. On the contrary, after 3 h it was observed a relevant reduction in the MFI within PI-treated cells challenged with (wt VSV-G) Nef G3C -GFP VLPs as compared with untreated cells. More strikingly, a strong decrease of both MFI and percentage of fluorescent cells was detectable in PI-treated cells at 16 h post-challenge (Fig. 7B) . As expected, among the different PI tested, saquinavir and nelfinavir produced the strongest inhibitory effect (data not shown).",

At the highest PI concentrations, both parameters reached levels similar to those detectable in cells challenged with (fd-VSV-G) Nef G3C -GFP VLPs (Fig. 7C) .

To test whether PIs affect intracellular pH, both HeLa and MDCK cells were labeled with LysoSensor Green DND-189. This reagent becomes fluorescent only in acidic intracellular compartments, meanwhile exhibiting decreased fluorescence intensity upon pH increase. Thus, it represents a useful reagent for detecting possible pH variations in endosomes. Cells were treated overnight with the PI doses most effective against VSV and/or influenza virus replication, then labeled with LysoSensor Green DND-189 for 30 min in the presence of PIs, and finally analyzed by FACS. As control, cells treated with bafilomycin A1, i.e., a powerful inhibitor of the vacuolar ATPase proton pump, were also tested. As depicted in Fig. 8 , no significant variations in the cellassociated fluorescence have been detected in PI-treated cells as compared with control conditions, indicating that PIs do not affect the intracellular pH. These results strongly suggest that the PI-induced block of virus delivery in cytoplasm would not be a consequence of the increase of endosomal pH.",

Hence, the selective targeting of cell products supporting virus replication could represent a successful antiviral strategy. The results from the here described investigations indicate that drugs designed to counteract the activity of the HIV protease show a strong inhibitory effect against activity(ies) of target cells. The antiviral potency of the most effective PIs reached about 4 logs in the reduction of virus yields, with therapeutic indexes higher than 15. The PI-induced effect against VSV appeared comparable in magnitude to that observed in cell treated with type-1 interferons (Masters and Samuel, 1983) . On the other hand, the potency of PIs against the influenza virus replication appeared comparable to that of most potent inhibitors. Among these, T-705 (Furuta et al., 2002) reduced the viral yield of the most susceptible influenza strain tested of at best 2.7 logs at the concentration of 5 \u03bcM upon MDCK cell challenge with 0.01 m.o.i. (Sleeman et al., 2010) . DAS181, i.e. a sialidase fusion protein, blocked the influenza virus replication at sub-micromolar concentrations, however when MDCK cells were challenged with 0.001-0.005 m.o.i. (Triana-Baltzer et al., 2009) . Conversely, micromolar concentrations of PIs induced more than 3 logs of reduction of the influenza virus yield from MDCK cells challenged with 0.5 m.o.i. In the challenge experiments where PIs were added soon after the adsorption of VSV or influenza virus inocula, the antiviral effect appeared slightly reduced as compared with control conditions where PIs were maintained throughout. Considering also the results obtained in the endocytosis assays, it is conceivable that this subtle difference could be a consequence of the accession to cytoplasm of a small amount of viral particles during the adsorption time and before the PI treatment.",

However, we cannot formally exclude that PIs inhibit some yet unidentified protease activity associated with VSV-G or influenza virions. In this regard, it has been proposed that PIs could negatively affect the chymotrypsin-like protease activity of the PA subunit of the RNA-directed RNA polymerase of influenza virus (Savarino, 2005) . Furthermore, it was reported that nelfinavir reduces the replication of SARS coronavirus (Yamamoto et al., 2004) likely as a consequence of the inhibition of the 3C-like viral protease (for a review, see 35).",

The viral expression was evaluated in terms of GFP expression at the indicated days post infection. The results are given as mean values of percentages +SD calculated from five independent experiments. Asterisks indicate p values b 0.05. (B) Ritonavir does not affect the HIV-1 single cycle replication, while blocking the viral spread within the infected cell culture. CEM GFP cells pre-incubated with 5 \u03bcM RTV, the same volume of DMSO, or left untreated, were infected with 500 ng HIV-1 CAp24 equivalent/10 5 cells of wt HIV-1. Infected cultures were washed 16 h later, and part of them where treated with 1 \u03bcg/ml of T-20. The viral expression was measured in terms of percentages of GFP + cells measured by FACS analysis 3 days post infection for T-20 treated cultures (left panel), and 6 days post infection for cells not treated with T-20 (right panel). The results are given as mean values of percentages +SD calculated from three independent experiments. (C) PM4 HIV-1 strain resists the PI treatment. CEM GFP cells treated or not with 10 \u03bcM RTV were infected with 500 ng HIV-1 CAp24 equivalent/10 5 cells of PM4 HIV-1 and FACS analyzed 6 days later for the GFP expression. The results are given as mean values of percentages +SD calculated from two independent experiments carried out with duplicated conditions. (D) PI-induced inhibition of the expression of (VSV-G) PM4 HIV-1.

(A) Effects of PI withdrawal after virus adsorption. HeLa and MDCK cells were treated or not with 5 \u03bcM saquinavir or nelfinavir, and challenged with 0.2 m.o.i. VSV or 0.5 m.o.i. influenza virus. After 1 h of adsorption, the viral inocula were removed, the cells were washed 5 times with 10 \u00d7 volumes of PBS, and infected cultures were refed with appropriate medium in the absence of the PI. Supernatants were harvested 8 h (for VSV infection) and 24 h (for influenza virus infection) later, and titrated for the respective virus contents by the end-point dilution method. The results are given as mean values of percentages +SD calculated from three independent experiments for both VSV (left panel) and influenza virus (right panel) challenges. (B) Effects on VSV and influenza virus replication of PIs added at different times after challenge. VSV (0.2 m.o.i.) and influenza virus (0.5 m.o.i.) were adsorbed on HeLa and MDCK cells, respectively. After 1 h at 37\u00b0C, the viral inocula were removed, the cells were washed 5 times with 10 \u00d7 volumes of PBS, and then refed in appropriate medium. At this time, or at the indicated post-infection times, saquinavir or nelfinavir were added at the final concentration of 5 \u03bcM. After 8 h (for VSV infection) and 24 h (for influenza virus infection), supernatants were harvested, clarified, and then titrated for infectious virus contents. The results are given as percentages of inhibition as compared with PI-treated infected cell cultures where PIs were re-added after virus challenges.
