Objectives: We sought to determine the prevalence of these viruses and their rate of co-detection with other viral respiratory pathogens, in an Australian population. Study design: Polymerase chain reaction assays previously described were used to examine the presence of KIV and WUV in 2866 respiratory specimens collected from January to December 2003 from Australian patients with acute respiratory infections. Results: KIV and WUV were present in our population with an annual prevalence of 2.6% and 4.5%, respectively. There was no apparent seasonal variation for KIV, but a predominance of infection was detected during late winter to early summer for WUV. The level of co-infection of KIV or WUV with other respiratory viruses was 74.7% and 79.7%, respectively. Both viruses were absent from urine and blood specimens collected from a variety of patient sources. Conclusions: KIV and WUV circulate annually in the Australian population. Although there is a strong association with the respiratory tract, more comprehensive studies are required to prove these viruses are agents causing respiratory disease. Crown",

Nucleic acids were extracted from 0.2 mL of each urine specimen with a QIAamp DNA blood mini kit (Qiagen, Clifton Hill, Australia). This procedure has been shown to be suitable for the extraction of viral DNA from urine specimens because of the high DNA yield and the removal of PCR inhibitors (Echavarria et al., 1998) .

WUV was initially detected by conventional PCR using primers AG0044 and AG0045, as described by Gaynor et al. (2007) , utilizing 15 min incubation at 95 \u2022 C, followed by 40 cycles of 95 \u2022 C for 30 s, 56 \u2022 C for 30 s and 72 \u2022 C for 1 min, and a final extension of 10 min at 72 \u2022 C. PCR amplification products were realized by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gels and visualized with ethidium bromide staining. Positive results were confirmed using a WUV-specific real-time PCR assay, which was recently developed in our laboratory, incorporating a hydrolysis (TaqMan) probe (Bialasiewicz et al., 2007) .",

Although both viruses had a consistent presence during 2003, there appeared to be no seasonal pattern of peak infection associated with KIV in our sample population. However, there appeared to be a predominance of infection with WUV in Queensland patients during the period from late winter to early summer, peaking in December (Fig. 1) . The prevalence of WUV from August to December was 5.5% compared to an average incidence of 2.9% for the rest of the year. In contrast, the prevalence of KIV for this period was 2.9% compared to 2.5% for the remaining year.

KIV and WUV were present in respiratory secretions from patients with ARTI at rates similar to those reported for the recently described respiratory viruses, human coronavirus HKU1, NL63 (Lau et al., 2006) , and HBoV (Kesebir et al., 2006) . Neither of the viruses were detected in other sample sets consisting of urine from a variety of sources, and blood from immunocompromised children. This was contrary to observations for the other human polyomaviruses BKV and JCV, which are commonly present in clinical urine samples and blood specimens, particularly from immunocompromised patients (Rossi et al., 2007; Polo et al., 2004; Azzi et al., 1996) . These results would suggest that the biology of KIV and WUV may be similar to each other, but quite different from BKV and JCV. Determining the role of KIV and WUV as human respiratory pathogens is confounded by the high level of co-detection of these viruses with other respiratory agents, particularly HRV. This feature is very similar to observations reported for HBoV where the rates of co-detection have ranged from 33.3% (Naghipour et al., 2007) to 83.7% (Fry et al., 2007) , and, although epidemiologically the virus is associated with pneumonia, it is postulated that infection and illness of HBoV may be dependent on co-infection with other viruses (Fry et al., 2007) . Similarly, this may be true for infection and disease involving KIV and WUV.",
