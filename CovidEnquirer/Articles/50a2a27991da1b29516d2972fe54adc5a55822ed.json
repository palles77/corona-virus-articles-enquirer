[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Every year, the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) hosts the Hajj pilgrimage, which is the largest mass gathering in the world held on a recurrent annual basis. 3 The Hajj occurs annually from the eighth to the 12 th of Dhul al-Hijah, the last (12 th ) month of the Islamic calendar, and two to three million people perform the pilgrimage during this period. 3 A further seven million complete a 'mini' pilgrimage, known as Umrah, outside the Hajj period throughout the year. Mass gatherings at religious events can pose major public health challenges, particularly the transmission of infectious diseases. Every year the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia (KSA) hosts the Hajj pilgrimage, the largest gathering held on an annual basis where over 2 million people come to KSA from over 180 countries. Living together in crowded conditions exposes the pilgrims and the local population to a range infectious diseases. Respiratory and gastrointestinal tract bacterial and viral infections can spread rapidly and affect attendees of mass gatherings. Lethal infectious disease outbreaks were common during Hajj in the 19th and 20th centuries although they have now been controlled to a great extent by the huge investments made by the KSA into public health prevention and surveillance programs. The KSA provides regular updated Hajj travel advice and health regulations through international public health agencies such as the WHO, Public Health England, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, and Hajj travel agencies. During the Hajj, an additional 25 000 health workers are deployed; there are eight hospitals in Makkah and Mina complete with state-of-the-art surgical wards and intensive care units made specifically available for pilgrims. All medical facilities offer high quality of care, and services are offered free to Hajj pilgrims to ensure the risks of ill health to all pilgrims and KSA residents are minimal. A summary of the key health issues that arise in pilgrims from Europe during Hajj and of the KSA Hajj guidelines, together with other factors that may play a role in reducing the risks to pilgrims and to wider global health security, is provided herein. In light of the huge number of pilgrims from all around the worldof which thousands come from low-income countries with minimal access to healthcare -mixing closely for several days in a difficult terrain, it is remarkable that the majority of pilgrims complete the Hajj without experiencing any major health issues. Infectious disease outbreaks were common during Hajj in the 19 th and 20 th centuries and have been controlled to a great extent, although proactive surveillance of the transmission of potential epidemic threats at Hajj is critical to preserving global health security. 3, 5 Crush injuries and stampedes, which can pose major risks at mass gatherings, are infrequent during the Hajj relative to its size and logistical complexity.

The risks of dehydration are heightened when Hajj occurs during summer months, owing to the extremely hot climate in Saudi Arabia. 14 Other infectious disease risks include meningococcal disease, which caused outbreaks during Hajj in the early 2000s owing to overcrowding and high carrier rates of Neisseria meningitidis among pilgrims. 3, [15] [16] [17] Mosquito species responsible for the transmission of malaria and the arbovirus that causes dengue are present in the KSA, although the country has been classified by the World Health Organization (WHO) as a low, geographically restricted malaria transmission area since 2008. 3 ",

In addition to cardiovascular disease, heat exhaustion and heatstroke are important causes of death; again health-related morbidity is exacerbated when Hajj occurs during the summer months.",

Pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine is recommended for pilgrims aged 65 years and for younger pilgrims with comorbidities. 29 Finally, with regard to measles and rubella vaccines, updating immunization against vaccine-preventable diseases in all travellers is strongly recommended.",

Recommendations discussed are pretravel health regulations and advice about vaccinations, health checks, and specific immunizations at the port of entry. Well before each Hajj, the Saudi Ministry of Health generates the health requirements for the issue of travel visas. It also provides health education campaigns through the provision of reading materials and through travel agents, pilgrim group leaders, websites, and the media, both before and during the Hajj.The KSA Government also provides regular updated Hajj travel advice and health regulations through international public health agencies such as the WHO, Public Health England, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC), and Hajj travel agencies. For the 2015 Hajj, for example, alerts were raised for the prevailing global threats from Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), influenza and other respiratory tract viruses, multidrug-resistant TB, multi-antibiotic-resistant bacteria, and Ebola.[18][19][20][21]6,22,23",
