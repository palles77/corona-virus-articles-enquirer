We have evaluated a multiplex real-time PCR method for the detection of 13 respiratory viruses and 2 bacteria (Mycoplasma and Chlamydophila) in a clinical setting. Objectives: The aim of the present study was to evaluate the diagnostic performance and clinical use of a novel multiplex PCR method in adults with community-acquired respiratory viral infection, and the impact of duration of symptoms on detection rates. Study design: Nasopharyngeal swab samples were prospectively collected from 209 adult outpatients with respiratory infections and 100 asymptomatic controls. Results: An infectious agent was identified in 43% of samples from patients and 2% of asymptomatic controls. The detection rate was significantly higher in samples from patients with a duration of symptoms of 6 days or less (51%) than in samples from patients with a duration of symptoms of 7 days or more (30%, p < 0.01). For human corona viruses, and influenza virus A and B there was a correlation between the amount of virus in each patient sample as measured Ct values and duration of symptoms. Conclusions: Duration of symptoms significantly affects the detection rate of respiratory pathogens by multiplex real-time PCR in nasopharyngeal swab samples from adult patients with respiratory infections. Our finding should be taken into account when using these tests in clinical practise.",

High sensitivity and short analysis time along with the ability to detect several pathogens in a single sample are advantages compared with serology, viral culture and antigen detection. 1-3 PCR assays may enhance identification of viral respiratory pathogens by at least 50% compared with traditional diagnostic methods, 4-6 partly by detecting viruses for which no conventional methods exist, such as human rhinovirus (hRV), human coronavirus (hCoV) and human metapneumovirus (hMPV). Kaye et al. 7 found a respiratory virus as the only causative agent in 15% of adult patients admitted to hospital with acute RTI. In patients with severe pneumonia, requiring intensive care treatment, who had negative bacterial cultures from bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) samples, Legoff et al. 8 reported detection of a respiratory virus in as much as 63% of cases. Viruses believed to cause only mild upper respiratory tract infections (URTI), for example hRV and hCoV have been detected in the lower respiratory tract in patients with severe disease. [9] [10] [11] On the other hand, it is not known if asymptomatic shedding occurs following clinical recovery or during subclinical infection, and results of molecular methods with high sensitivity must be assessed with caution regarding the clinical relevance of the finding.",

An acute RTI was defined as having at least two of the following symptoms; coryza, congestion, sneezing, soar throat, odynophagia, cough, chest pain, shortness of breath or fever, for which the physician found no other explanation. Patients with suspected or confirmed bacterial infection were excluded. Patients were asked to return for a follow-up visit 10 days (\u00b12 days) after the initial visit. Signs and symptoms were recorded in a web-based form. The same protocol was used at initial and follow-up visit. A control group of 100 healthy adults without history of fever or symptoms of RTI during the preceding 14 days were also included. Control subjects were contacted for a telephone interview 2 days after testing. Individuals who had developed symptoms of RTI were excluded, to avoid detecting virus that might be shed in high levels prior to onset of symptoms.",

This is in concordance with reports on single-plex PCR assays for influenza where the detection rate correlates to duration of symptoms. 15 We detected an infectious agent in 43% of patients. Previously, detection rates ranging between 43% and 63% have been described, 6, 12, 16, 17 with exceptions for very high rates among young children and infants. 18, 19 In asymptomatic children, higher frequencies of positive results have been reported. 20, 21 In particular detection of hRV and EV may represent a previous infection dating back 4-5 weeks, due to prolonged shedding of virus. 22 Lack of pre-existing immunity, greater viral exposure as well as an immature immune system may cause higher levels of viral replication and prolonged viral shedding in children. Templeton et al. reported a detection rate of only 24%, but hRV, hCoV, AdV or hMPV were not included in their panel. 23 Studies performed retrospectively on clinical samples will select for a short duration of symptoms as will studies including children, who tend to seek medical care early and who may shed more virus during a longer time period. Thus, the prospective approach and the adult population may explain the relatively low detection rate found in our sample. As the study period included the influenza season, we detected influenza A and B virus in a relatively high proportion of patients (41%), which is comparable to other studies of adults. 9 We detected a pathogen in only 2% of control subjects, both hRV. Although most studies do not include controls, Creer et al. 16 found a respiratory virus in 12% of controls, who reported no signs of respiratory tract infection during 2 months before sampling, predominantly hRV. Asymptomatic shedding of hRV, RSV and PIV has also been reported in immunocompromised patients. 24, 25 Our results suggest that viral shedding exceeding 14 days is rare in immunocompetent adults. The rate of asymptomatic carriage of virus might be affected by epidemiological factors that vary over time. Our control samples were, however, collected throughout the entire study period.",

This is in concordance with the gradual reduction of RSV levels in nasopharyngeal aspirates described by Gerna et al. 26 and Campanini et al. 27 Dual viral infections are previously described in approximately 5-20% of infected patients, with a higher frequency among young children. 17, 28, 29 In accordance with previous studies we found two viruses in 7% of the samples. The clinical impact of multiple infections remains to be determined. In one study of children with RSV infection, higher fever, longer hospital stays and more frequent use of antibiotics was associated with multiple infections. 30 Semiquantification of viral DNA, as measured by Ct values, may be of use when determining the clinical relevance of a positive test, particularly in multiple infections.",

The high genetic variability of hRVs, which increase the probability of probe-target mismatch, may explain this. For other viruses, such as influenza B virus, with less genetic variability viral detection will be more stable. The lack of association between duration of illness and Ct values in hRV infection may also reflect variations in viral shedding and differences in pre-existing immunity between individuals as well as limited sample size. Interestingly, the majority of patients, 7/13 (62%) positive for any agent at the follow-up visit (day 10 \u00b1 2 days) had hRV. Whether this translates into a longer period of infectivity remains to be determined. However, the semi-quantitative estimation of viral loads by Ct values must be interpreted with caution since relative viral loads were not compared to standard amounts of virus.",
