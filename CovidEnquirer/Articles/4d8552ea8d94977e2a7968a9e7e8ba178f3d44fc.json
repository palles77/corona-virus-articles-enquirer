            "text": "The objective of this communication is to introduce a conceptual framework for a study that applies a rigorous systems approach to rural disaster preparedness and planning. System Dynamics is a well-established computer-based simulation modeling methodology for analyzing complex social systems that are difficult to change and predict. This approach has been applied for decades to a wide variety of issues of healthcare and other types of service capacity and delivery, and more recently, to some issues of disaster planning and mitigation. The study will use the System Dynamics approach to create computer simulation models as ''what-if'' tools for disaster preparedness planners. We have recently applied the approach to the issue of hospital surge capacity, and have reached some preliminary conclusions -for example, on the question of where in the hospital to place supplementary nursing staff during a severe infectious disease outbreak -some of which we had not expected. Other hospital disaster preparedness issues well suited to System Dynamics analysis include sustaining employee competence and reducing turnover, coordination of medical care and public health resources, and hospital coordination with the wider community to address mass casualties. The approach may also be applied to preparedness issues for agencies other than hospitals, and could help to improve the interactions among all agencies represented in a community's local emergency planning committee.",

It involves a variety of governmental and non-governmental agencies, including fire, emergency medical services (EMS), hospitals, police, and public health (Rudman et al., 2003) , with overlapping jurisdictions and competing agendas and interests (Landesman, 2001; Heinrich, 2001; NRC, 2002) . For example, the evidence-gathering requirements of law enforcement may potentially conflict with the patient confidentiality requirements of medical providers. Also, some agencies, such as local public health agencies and hospitals, may not be as involved in disaster planning efforts as they should be (IOM, 2002; NRC, 2002) . The challenges of effective collaboration and communication among agencies are made even greater when the agencies are limited in resources and funding (IOM, 2002; Rudman et al., 2003) , a situation often found in rural areas (ORHP, 2002) .",

Following this approach, we are now engaged in a study of a single hospital's surge capacity. The next step would be to look at how that hospital fits into a regional healthcare response, and subsequently into an overall community response. Ultimately, we foresee the possibility of developing a comprehensive model of community disaster planning that considers all major agencies and organizations.",

SD applications involve the development of causal diagrams and computer simulation models that are unique to each problem setting. The types of problems to which SD has been applied are too numerous to mention. In the health field specifically, studies go back more than 30 years and include a variety of studies of healthcare delivery (Levin et al., 1976; Gardner, 1991; Hirsch and Immediato, 1999; Lane, 2000; Homer et al., 2004) and population health and epidemiology (Levin et al., 1975; Homer and St. Clair, 1991; Homer, 1993; Tengs et al., 2001) . The causal diagrams of an SD application are often created by groups of diverse stakeholders and subject matter experts brought together for the purpose of establishing a common framework for policy analysis (Vennix, 1996) . The simulation models themselves are typically constructed by specially trained experts who take the ideas and data of the stakeholder group and integrate them into an interlocking set of equations. A single SD model typically consists of a multitude of such equations, constructed and refined through an iterative process of scope selection, hypothesis generation, causal diagramming, quantification, reliability testing, and policy analysis (Sterman, 2000) .",

Forrester in the mid-1950s and first propounded fully in his book ''Industrial Dynamics'' (Forrester, 1961) , with some key additional insights presented in a later book entitled ''Urban Dynamics'' (Forrester, 1969) . A central tenet of SD is that the difficult-to-change and difficultto-anticipate behaviors of organizational and social systems are the result of ongoing accumulations and both balancing and reinforcing feedback mechanisms, which we can only hope to dissect with the aid of computer models. The unique contribution of SD to policy analysis is not the notion that feedback is important (an idea that has been around in various forms for centuries) but is the practical application of this fundamental concept in the form of models that can be tested, calibrated, and refined in a rigorous and scientific way (Forrester and Senge, 1980; Randers, 1980; Morecroft, 1985; Richardson, 1991; Homer, 1996; Sterman, 2000 Sterman, , 2001 .",

Commonly, in the social sciences, one thinks of research as involving experimentation done directly on the subject of interest. To obtain reliable results from such direct experimentation, a large enough sample is required with a minimum of uncontrolled variables. This sort of research may be readily performed in relatively simple systems, but becomes increasingly impractical and unreliable in systems with multiple interacting actors and ''moving parts''. However, multiple actors and moving parts are precisely what one finds when considering the complexities of disaster planning. Aside from certain simple measures of capacity, and preparedness drills limited to a single organization or one possible disaster scenario out of many, direct research is of limited practical value in this context.",

Such non-trivial planning issues exist even within a single organization, like a hospital, and we suggest that may be the best place to demonstrate the value of SD. In fact, we recently completed an SD modeling project to study certain aspects of rural hospital disaster planning. In subsequent projects, we will address other hospital planning issues, and issues for other types of organizations and affecting the coordination of multiple organizations.",

Models allow for flexibility of circumstances and can assist disaster planners, particularly those in rural areas, in determining better ways to address issues with fewer resources. In theory, planners should be able to more accurately plan for many possible contingencies, for resource and personnel allocation, and for effective collaboration with other agencies and jurisdictions. When used in conjunction with available empirical data and what is known through the medical literature, models and simulations can help provide the evidence base for nationally consistent standards and guidelines. The simulation-based approach is depicted in Fig. 1 , our revised version of Brownson's framework for evidence-based public health, where ''quantify the issue'' has been replaced with ''model the issue and analyze options'' (Brownson et al., 1999) . In this figure, we also show how modeling is an iterative process in which policy options emerge through multiple rounds of model refinement (see the feedback link, ''refine analysis'') (Homer, 1996; Sterman, 2000) .",
