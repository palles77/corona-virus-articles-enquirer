India, China, and Indonesia have only tiny private markets for PCVs despite having the three largest birth cohorts worldwide. India also has the greatest number of children dying from pneumonia per year. 14 PCV13 is being introduced in some high-burden Indian states in 2017 with the support of funding from the vaccine alliance Gavi. It is hoped further government funding will be made available for supplies from local or international manufacturers within the next few years. Despite only two manufacturers having licensed PCVs so far, more than a dozen are developing PCV products, of which at least some are likely to enter the market over the next decade. Increased supply is likely to drive down costs and promote high and sustainable coverage.",

            "text": "New and re-emerging infectious diseases cause much human suffering worldwide. 1 Many of these diseases are zoonoses 2 with epidemic potential. All sub-Saharan African regions are highly biodiverse with large rural populations that are highly dependent on livestock agriculture. Movement of pathogens between animals and people increases as the domestic populations expand, creating novel ecotones and ecosystemic perturbation. With increasing food security demands, intensification of livestock and agriculture is required and further evolution and spill over of novel zoonoses to humans is inevitable. The emergence this century of previously unknown zoonotic respiratory tract infectious diseases with epidemic potential, 3 such as Avian influenza, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS), and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS), highlights an urgent need to change the current global status quo. 4 The 2015 west African Ebola virus epidemic 5 illustrated that once an infectious disease takes hold locally, the originating region and rest of the world is put at equal risk due to ease of international travel, global food systems, livestock trade, and inadequate capacities to identify and respond to outbreaks. Several lessons were learnt from the Ebola virus outbreak that could help guide development of more effective and appropriate response capacities. Much of the spread and devastating impact of Ebola virus in west Africa was rooted in the emerging environmental, socioeconomic, and socioanthropological changes taking place in west Africa. The highly medicalised approach and ineffectiveness of the local and regional surveillance mechanisms delayed appropriate socio ecological manage ment of the epidemic. 6,7 Absent were effective active disease surveillance, early diagnosis using rapid diagnostic tests, rapid communication of data for health systems, and engagement and awareness of communities, [6] [7] [8] to implement intervention measures to control spread. Behavioural factors also contributed to rapid outbreak spread. Improved understanding of eco-epidemiological, socio-cultural, anthropological, and political determinants that drive the emergence and spread of disease is crucial to preventing epidemics. Furthermore, the lack of local capacity and preparedness in affected west African countries to conduct comprehensive, multidisciplinary and well-coordinated research was also evident during the Ebola virus epidemic. Foreign aid workers and research groups aroused local anxieties among communities 8 due to ignorance of, or insensitivity to, cultural norms. Research studies to assess and determine optimal management protocols and trial new treatments and vaccines were slow to start, 9 and were dominated by foreign groups, with scant involvement of African scientists or local policy makers. Newer treatments in development and those with compassionate-use regulations were available but their use and evaluation to inform optimal evidence-based management, were slowed down by the absence of rapid ethical review processes for research in emergency situations.",

Such a partnership would ensure the readiness to immediately perform coordinated basic science research, to define the source of outbreak and transmission dynamics, and to conduct large-scale multisite clinical studies. It will enable establishment of regional high quality laboratories incorporating rapid diagnostics for multiple pathogens, and proactive surveillance systems providing latest real-time information. 12 Replication of the mobile laboratory model in all African regions will also enable to take forward the important agenda of establishing effective rapid response teams for outbreaks with support of national governments and public health services.",

The extension of road networks throughout the city and installation of water distribution pipes for the long-awaited Melamchi drinking water project in most parts of Kathmandu valley have worsened air pollution levels in the capital city. The authorities have been criticised for not taking measures to contain the dust generated from these projects. [1] [2] [3] The latest report about environment performance index (EPI) by Yale University 4 ranked Nepal 177 of 180 countries in terms of air quality. The effects of air pollution on human health are immense. Additionally, people with existing morbidities like cardiovascular diseases and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) face increased risk of exacerbations. A report published by WHO in 2016, 5 revealed that outdoor air pollution causes more than 9000 deaths every year in Nepal, mostly due to ischaemic heart disease, stroke, and COPD.Increasing levels of air pollution could detract from Nepal's recent gains in health.
