He also was responsible for directing vaccine grants as a major partner in the global polio eradication initiative, global measles control and mortality reduction initiative, and other priority global immunization activities. In early 2004, Cochi was appointed as Acting Director of the National Immunization Program at CDC. During his outstanding career of more than 22 years working in the field of immunization at CDC, Cochi has had a major impact on the prevention of virtually every one of the vaccine-preventable diseases, particularly diphtheria, Haemophilus influenzae type B (Hib) disease, measles, mumps, pertussis, polio, rubella, varicella, and tetanus.",

At the time of Steve's birth, his father was a recent graduate of St. Lawrence University, and he had accepted a teaching and coaching position in the Webster school district that later would lead to the position of principal of the high school. Eventually, the family settled into the family home in Penfield, where they have lived now for more than 50 years.

After Carlo's death, Leonina continued to run the business until she was in her late 70s and a hip fractured forced her to retire. Today, Steve fondly remembers the summers spent helping her pump gas and selling ice cream and candy to the local children, as well as playing with his cousins and attending the annual St. Johnsville Fireman's Fair (personal correspondence, Jane Skvarich).",

One of Steve's most cherished memories of these visits is the year his father and grandfather took him and his brother Robbie to see his childhood idols, Willie Mays of the New York Giants, compete against Hank Aaron of the Boston Braves.

His academic success began when he was in the fourth grade and won the spelling championship in the Webster school district. He still has the trophy that his mother saved all these years. In high school, he continued to shine academically, graduating as salutatorian of his class. He also was an excellent musician and played the trumpet until time constraints precluded his continued participation in the band. Despite his 5=7\u0409, 140-pound frame, Steve also excelled in his athletic endeavors in high school, where he played football, basketball, and lacrosse. He played defensive safety on the All County Football Team and, in lacrosse, he was the high scorer, helping take his team to the New York State Title his senior year.

He held this record until just a few years ago, when a young player broke Steve's record-but took 4 years to do so. So, in the eyes of his family, Steve still holds the record! After graduating a semester early from MIT, Steve went to work at Massachusetts General Hospital as a phlebotomist to earn money for medical school. He was accepted to Duke Medical School, where he worked hard and had the privilege of meeting Dr. Samuel L. Katz, for whom he has great respect (for biography of Dr. Katz, see July 2002 issue of Seminars in Pediatric Infectious Diseases 1 ). He considers Dr. Katz his role model and mentor throughout his career. Between work at Duke and the hospital, Steve also sang in the choir. From Duke, Cochi headed back to Boston and Massachusetts General Hospital, where he completed a 3-year residency. While he was doing a pediatric residency program, Cochi met a lovely young nurse in the pediatric intensive care unit, Jane Skvarich.

These days were especially happy ones, for in addition to enjoying the beauty of the Southwest and its fascinating history and interesting people, Cochi had for the first time HBO and all the movies he wanted-and at home!

As often happens when individuals are called to positions of great magnitude, challenges, and responsibilities, Cochi's commitments often took a toll on his time with the family, which now includes two children ( Figure 5) . Bradley was born on June 5, 1986, and like his father is very athletic. This summer (2004), he will be playing Ultimate Frisbee on the United States Junior's Team at the Ultimate Frisbee World Championship in Turku, Finland. Their daughter, Shea, was born on July 11, 1989. She takes after her father in her musical acumen, having played the piano since she was in kindergarten. Despite the demands on his time, Cochi is a devoted husband and father, as well as son, and he makes time to be with his family. In 1995, he returned to New York for a family reunion ( Figure 6) . Also, he spends as much time as possible with his wife and children, and they travel together whenever possible. One especially memorable trip was made to Venice, Italy, in 1998 (Figure 7) . It was followed by another trip to Italy in 2002, this time to Maenza, Italy, where Jane and Steve attended a wedding (Figure 8) .",

Brad chose to go to China, and he and his father traveled together for 3 weeks in 1999 throughout China.

The newest addition to the family's interest is a house on Lake Hartwell, South Carolina, that includes a boat, and the entire family is enjoying learning about boating and lake life. And, of course, Cochi still loves movies of any kind.",

In partnership with WHO, UNICEF, the American Red Cross, the UN Foundation, and the International Federation of the Red Cross and Red Crescent Societies, his leadership has been critical to the following achievements:\u2022 The elimination of indigenous measles in all countries of the Americas for nearly 2 years. Consequently, measles importations from Latin America, which used to be the most common source of imported measles into the United States, have decreased to zero since 2000. \u2022 A 5-year global action plan to reduce by 2005 the number of deaths from measles in children by 50 percent (compared with 1999 estimates) is being implemented, with CDC as a major partner. During 2001 to 2003, campaigns against measles have been conducted in 29 countries in Africa, with more than 112 million children being immunized and an estimated 266,000 deaths being prevented. \u2022 An integral part of the global polio-eradication program is a highly functional global surveillance system for acute flaccid paralysis and polioviruses. This system includes a network of 145 accredited poliovirus laboratories and a massive infrastructure of trained managers and staff and logistics. The system also is providing the backbone for developing surveillance for other vaccinepreventable diseases and will play a central role in a global early outbreak detection system.To achieve these goals, Cochi has worked closely with UN agencies and private sector partners, including WHO, UNICEF, Pan American Health Organization, Rotary International, the United Nations Foundation, American Red Cross, International Federation of Red Cross and Red Cres-cent Societies, The World Bank, and Ministries of Health in developing middle-income countries.",
