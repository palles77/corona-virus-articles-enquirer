            "text": "A substantial proportion of hitherto unexplained respiratory tract illnesses is associated with human metapneumovirus (hMPV) infection. This virus also was found in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). To determine the dynamics and associated lesions of hMPV infection , six cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) were inoculated with hMPV and examined by pathological and virological assays. They were euthanized at 5 (n \u202b\u060d\u202c 2) or 9 (n \u202b\u060d\u202c 2) days post-infection (dpi) , or monitored until 14 dpi (n \u202b\u060d\u202c 2). Viral excretion peaked at 4 dpi and decreased to zero by 10 dpi. Viral replication was restricted to the respiratory tract and associated with minimal to mild , multi-focal erosive and inflammatory changes in conducting airways , and increased numbers of macrophages in alveoli. Viral expression was seen mainly at the apical surface of ciliated epithelial cells throughout the respiratory tract , and less frequently in type 1 pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages. Both cell tropism and respiratory lesions were distinct from those of SARS-associated coronavirus infection , excluding hMPV as the primary cause of SARS. This study demonstrates that hMPV is a respiratory pathogen and indicates that viral replication is short-lived , polarized to the apical surface, and occurs primarily in ciliated respiratory epithelial cells.",

To characterize the virus excretion, virus distribution, and associated lesions of hMPV infection, and to determine whether they differ from those of SCV infection, we experimentally inoculated six cynomolgus macaques (Macaca fascicularis) with the prototype hMPV isolate NL/1/00 2 . They were euthanized at 5 (n \u03ed 2) or 9 (n \u03ed 2) days post-infection (dpi), or monitored until 14 dpi (n \u03ed 2). Here, we report the pathological, immunohistochemical, virological, serological, and molecular biological findings of this experiment.",

The subclinical or mild character of the disease associated with hMPV infection in these macaques corresponds to that in immunocompetent middle-age adults. 13 Based on the ability of hMPV to replicate in the bronchioles and alveoli of cynomolgus macaques, one may expect more extensive viral replication and an associated increased severity of lesions in the lower respiratory tract of immunocompromised human beings, resulting in the severe bronchiolitis and pneumonia diagnosed clinically in such patients. 22, 23 The predominant tropism of hMPV for ciliated epithelial cells in the conducting airways and the mildness of the associated lesions, as seen in this study, contrasts with the predilection of SCV for alveolar epithelial cells and the severity of the associated pneumonia in SARS patients 15,24 -26 and experimentally infected macaques. 16, 17 These differences confirm that SCV and not hMPV is the primary etiological agent of SARS. The pathogenesis of hMPV infection in macaques is similar in many ways to that of RSV in human beings, as far as it has been studied. As in hMPV, incubation period and excretion period are short, although RSV excretion may be prolonged in infants and immunocompromised individuals. 27 Both initial infection and subsequent shedding of RSV are restricted to ciliated epithelial cells, based on an in vitro study using recombinant RSV expressing green fluorescent protein. 28 Similar to the localization of RSV in that study, the results of immunohistochemistry in these macaques show that hMPV infection is polarized to the apical surface of ciliated respiratory epithelium. In immunocompetent individuals, the most common clinical manifestation of RSV infection is mild upper respiratory tract disease. 29 However, viral distribution and associated lesions of this mild disease have not been reported. In very young or immunocompromised individuals, RSV replication occurs in epithelial cells of bronchus, bronchiole, and in alveolar macrophages, 30, 31 and is associated with severe bronchiolitis, interstitial pneumonia, or giant cell pneumonia. 32 Although clinical studies indicate that hMPV infection may cause similar lesions in this category of patients, confirmation of fatal bronchiolitis or pneumonia from hMPV infection awaits pathological assessment of biopsy or autopsy samples. 18 The pathogenesis of hMPV infection also is similar to that of APV, its closest known relative. 2 As for hMPV infection in cynomolgus macaques, APV infection in turkeys has a short incubation and excretion period (2 and 8 days, respectively), occurs primarily in ciliated respiratory epithelial cells, and is associated with superficial erosive and inflammatory changes. In contrast to hMPV infection, APV antigen is not present in alveolar macrophages or alveolar walls. However, this difference may be explained, at least in part, by the intratracheal application of hMPV in macaques (this study) compared to the conjunctival and intranasal application of APV in experimentally infected turkeys. 33 The results of this study provide the first characterization of the viral excretion, viral distribution and associated lesions of hMPV infection in cynomolgus macaques, and help to understand the pathology of this infection in human beings. The immunohistochemical method de-scribed above may be useful for retrospective analysis of respiratory tissues of human patients with respiratory disease of unknown viral origin, and to study the possible role of hMPV as a co-pathogen in patients with SARS.
