            "text": "An estimated 900 million people per annum travel internationally and between 2AE8-15% of travellers 1-4 may be infected with influenza. Infected travellers may act as a vector for the influenza virus, 5, 6 introducing it into other communities, including their own upon return, with obvious public health consequences as demonstrated by the spread of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and pandemic influenza H1N1. 7, 8 Influenza has the capacity to disrupt travel, and is capable of causing severe or even fatal illness. It is one of the most frequent vaccine-preventable diseases in returned travellers. One study has demonstrated that travellers experienced one influenza event per 100 person-month abroad 4 . A large study analysing the incidence of vaccine-preventable disease in returned international travellers showed that 12AE1% of travellers with a vaccine-preventable disease had influenza as compared with enteric fevers (47AE6%) and hepatitis A (16AE7%) 9 . Despite influenza being a common, and at times severe or even fatal illness, advice offered to travellers may be inadequate: a large Geosentinel study found that business travel was significantly associated with a diagnosis of influenza (P < 0AE001), only 22AE5 % of business travellers had completed a pre-travel health consultation. 9 A survey of US travellers found that although the majority of interviewees were aware of influenza prevention measures, only 41% had received influenza vaccination in the preceding season. 10 This lack of concern and awareness in travellers might perhaps be due to the disease being perceived, incorrectly, as not 'travel related'. 11 Information on the epidemiology of influenza and its seasonality is important in planning its prevention and treatment in travellers. In temperate latitudes, influenza is generally a winter illness; in tropical latitudes, it is more perennial and may peak at times travel health practitioners are unaware of. [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] An additional risk in the tropics might be through transmission by person to person contact in addition to the more usual droplet and aerosol spread. 17 Different strains of seasonal influenza virus tend to circulate in the northern and southern hemispheres, which are reflected in the annual composition of the influenza vaccine; an important consideration is that travellers may not be protected when the circulating strains are mismatched for the northern and southern hemispheres. 18, 19 In addition, within the same hemisphere, the timing of influenza seasons and dominant strains may differ by continent, region and country. 20 Furthermore, both northern and southern hemisphere influenza virus strains may circulate simultaneously in the tropics. 21 Importantly, strains from both hemispheres may circulate at international mass gatherings such as pilgrimages, resulting in vaccinated travellers not being adequately protected against influenza while travelling. [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] When novel influenza strains emerge, no vaccine is usually available. as illustrated during the first months of the recent pH1N1 pandemic. 27, 28 Antivirals may be used both for the treatment and prophylaxis of influenza when influenza vaccine is unavailable or contraindicated; 29 There is, therefore, a putative role for the carriage of antiviral drugs by travellers, for use on a 'stand-by treatment' basis; travellers might then also benefit from the greater therapeutic efficacy obtained from the early initiation of therapy. 30 Given the limited data on these issues, this study investigated, in the setting of a travel health consultation, travellers' beliefs and perceptions regarding measures to prevent infection with influenza, utilizing cognitive-intention and cognitive-behaviour approaches. The study sought to understand whether travellers would use antiviral therapeutic and stand-by treatment to treat infection with influenza if these were dispensed as part of a travel health consultation.",

As a newly emerged global health threat, the pH1N1 virus posed significant challenges to public health and media information strategies. 33, 34 In the initial stages of the pandemic, an absence of information about the virus as well as a lack of an effective vaccine or knowledge about the effectiveness of antiviral drugs created significant anxiety. 35 It was in this context that measures of protection were promoted; however, the effectiveness of control measures in a pandemic depends on the awareness of the general population and their willingness to cooperate, which in turn is likely to be associated with the perceived personal risk of contracting influenza. It was for these reasons that it was hypothesized that travellers would have a raised awareness regarding infection with influenza and be willing to receive preventive and stand-by interventions against influenza. However, public awareness and anxiety can wane during a major public health incident, related to disease severity and media coverage. Evidence from national telephone surveys in the United Kingdom over the period 1 May 2009 to 10 January 2010 supports this assertion, and psychological processes should be considered when designing health interventions. 35 Although, at least in theory, compliance with influenza prevention measures should be quite simple, [36] [37] [38] [39] the acceptability of these measures among travellers was unknown.

Of importance, the findings relate to the general population in as much as the majority of the sampled population did not possess any underlying medical condition (75AE6%). 40 We believe that utilization of behavioural theory enabled us to gain some understanding of the factors governing traveller's choices, providing some insights into questions around 'compliance' or 'adherence', an important issue in travel health, given that many of the discipline's interventions are prophylactic in nature. To some extent, this was confirmed by our finding that an intention to comply with antiviral prescription was strongly associated with prophylactic antimalarial prescription. This finding gels with the notion that adding influenza prevention and treatment to the offerings of travel clinics could be of benefit to the travelling public.",

Interestingly, comparing the seasonal influenza vaccine target groups of elderly people and those with chronic illnesses, one notes similarities between our results (66AE7% and 47AE0% respectively) and those reported by the Health Protection Agency (HPA) on behalf of Department of Health for registered patients in general practices in England for 2003-4 (78AE1% in 2005-6 for 65 or over aged population and 47AE2% in 2003-4, respectively), 40 and quite consistent with that observed in Swiss business travellers (27AE2%). 42 To increase the intention to comply with influenza antiviral use in travellers, practitioners might usefully explain the use and role of vaccines and antiviral drugs; where constraints on the use of antivirals exist, practitioners might challenge these on scientific grounds. [43] [44] [45] [46] Consideration should be given where considered clinically appropriate, to travellers being provided with antivirals to carry with them on a stand-by basis; traveller acceptance of this strategy is likely to be improved by explanation that influenza can be a severe illness. A particular consideration would be a caution with the prescription of stand-by antivirals for travellers to malarious areas, 47 given that malaria may present as influenza-like illness: seasonality and destination would need consideration by the prescribing practitioner. Support for this strategy comes from a recent study conducted in business travellers, which detected good knowledge of the transmission and symptoms of influenza; interestingly, 9AE7% of travellers in this study acknowledged having carried antiviral medication on their last business trip, with 7AE0% of travellers having actually used the carried medication. 42 Of interest, and a possible indication of the public's acceptance of the concept of stand-by medication for the treatment of influenza, was the unexpected increase in 2005 of oseltamivir prescriptions, for use during a future outbreak of H5N1 influenza virus infection, 48 attributed to widespread personal stockpiling. 49 Some studies have proposed individuals' personalities and their degree of apprehension about avian influenza, rather than differences in their knowledge as the basic reason for this personal stockpiling. 50 The purchase of very large antiviral stockpiles by many developed countries assuages equity of access objections to personal stockpiling, at least for travel purposes. An issue for travellers is the accessibility of safe and effective antivirals when travelling. The widespread practice of counterfeiting and lack of security in the drug supply in some regions argues for the carrying of personal medication sourced in the traveller's home country.",

A recent opinion by the US Advisory Committee on Immunization Practice recommends prompt antiviral therapy for high-risk groups, and for non-highrisk groups when treatment can be initiated within 48 hours of symptom onset, a view not incompatible with the provision of antiviral emergency stand-by medication (ESBM) to travellers. 51 This study identifies some of the beliefs and perceptions travellers hold with regard to the prevention of influenza and in particular, during the H1N1 pandemic. As a common vaccine-preventable disease, influenza vaccination should be recommended for travellers alongside the necessity for the year round availability of hemisphere appropriate influenza vaccination. Although our findings suggest that there is a role for travel clinics in both the prevention and treatment of influenza in travellers, corroboration of our findings in other travel clinic settings and among different cohorts of travellers is desirable. This could enable potentially the development of future guidance for the prevention of influenza in travellers, a highly mobile population who can introduce infections into susceptible populations with the potential public health consequences.",
