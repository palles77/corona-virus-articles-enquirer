Stress associated with car journeys or a period in unfamiliar surroundings will increase blood glucose and alter haematological parameters such as the distribution of neutrophils and lymphocytes.

Conversion factors for the variety of units used in reference ranges are given in Table 2 .1. Differences in analytical techniques between laboratories can lead to disparity in results. Historically laboratory data were often derived from populations of rabbits of the same breed, sex and age that are not genetically diverse. In contrast, the pet rabbit population is made up of a variety of breeds and cross-breeds, and is composed of rabbits of all ages. With the increased interest of rabbit owners in pursuing diagnostics for their pets, many commercial labs have built up a vast database of samples from a genetically heterogeneous population. Significant breed and sex differences have been noted for some parameters in laboratory rabbits (Kozma et al., 1974) .",

Some reference ranges are an amalgamation of other reference ranges often without addressing the fact that the ranges have been determined using different methodologies. This results in ranges so wide that almost any result will fall within the normal range. For example, the reference range for serum albumin concentrations of pet rabbits is given as 27-46 g/L (Malley, 1996) based on four published sets of data. Gillett (1994) gives an even wider range of 27-50 g/L for laboratory rabbits based on five sets of data. For some parameters there are big differences between published reference ranges. An example is blood calcium. Gillett (1994) gives a range of 1.5-3.4 mmol/L, compared to 3.4-4.0 mmol/L given by Harkness and Wagner (1995) . Differences in calcium content of the diet between the groups of rabbits or differences in analytical technique could explain these discrepancies. Different laboratory methods can result in large differences between reference ranges. An example is alkaline phosphatase. Collins (1988) gives a reference range of 4.1-6.2 IU/L, compared to 10-70 IU/L (Gillett, 1994) or 112-350 IU/L (Harkness and Wagner, 1995) .",

The red blood cells vary in diameter within a range of 5.0-7.8 mm (Sanderson and Phillips, 1981) . This variation in diameter (anisocytosis) is a feature of blood smears from rabbits and is not a significant finding (see Figure 2 .1). The red cell distribution width (RDW) is a measurement of the variation in size of erythrocytes and is higher in rabbits (11-15, IDEXX reference range) than in dogs and cats (8-10; Bush, 1991) . In dogs and cats, anisocytosis is indicative of the presence of reticulocytes and a regenerative anaemia. In rabbits, 1-4% of circulating erythrocytes may be reticulotytes. Polychromasia and reticulocytes in rabbit blood smears have been attributed to the short life span and high turnover of erythrocytes (Kraus et al., 1984) . Nucleated red cells and Howell-Jolly bodies can also be found occasionally (McLaughlin and Fish, 1994) . Rabbit neutrophils have an almost colourless cytoplasm and contain two types of granules. The smaller granules stain pink, giving a pinkish colour to the cytoplasm. Larger granules stain a deeper pinkish-red. The overall colour of the neutrophils varies according to the proportion of large and small granules. The granular appearance of the cytoplasm has led to different nomenclature. Rabbit neutrophils may be called heterophils, pseudoeosinophils, acidophils or amphophils, depending on the text (Benson and Paul-Murphy, 1999; Sanderson and Phillips, 1981) . Neutrophils measure 10-15 mm in comparison with eosinophils, which measure 12-16 mm (Sanderson and Phillips, 1981) .",

These findings are in agreement with studies of experimental infections in rabbits Krueger, 1988, 1989) and in a clinical study by Harcourt-Brown and Baker (2001) . In this study, significantly higher red cell counts, haemoglobin values, haematocrits and lymphocyte counts were found in rabbits kept outside with unlimited access to grazing and exercise.

Pet rabbits tend to have PCV values at the lower end of the range, typically between 30 and 40% (Harcourt-Brown and Baker, 2001) . Values greater than 45% are indicative of dehydration, especially in rabbits suffering from gut motility problems. Values of less than 30% indicate anaemia that can be classified into non-regenerative and regenerative in a manner similar to that of other species. Regenerative anaemia is associated with chronic blood loss, where compensatory mechanisms are attempting to redress the balance. Common causes include heavy flea infestation or from sites that intermittently bleed such as a uterine endometrial aneurysm or uterine adenocarcinomas, a common finding in middle-aged unneutered does. Lead poisoning can result in a regenerative anaemia with the presence of nucleated erythrocytes, hypochromasia, poikilocytosis and cytoplasmic basophilic stippling (Fudge, 2000) . Non-regenerative anaemia is caused by diseases such as lymphoma or chronic renal failure. Autoimmune haemolytic disease has not been described as a clinical phenomenon in pet rabbits although there are reports that it occurs. Autoimmune haemolytic anaemia has been reported in laboratory rabbits in association with lymphosarcoma (Weisbroth, 1994) . Chronic debilitating disease such as dental disorders or abscesses often cause a mild anaemia in pet rabbits (Harcourt-Brown and Baker, 2001) .",

The neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio has been suggested as a method of predicting whether a rabbit is normal or abnormal (McLaughlin and Fish, 1994) . Jain (1986) described a physiological variation in the neutrophil:lymphocyte ratio according to the age of the rabbit.

Administration of exogenous adrenaline to rabbits results in redistribution of lymphocytes from spleen and bone marrow to peripheral blood, lungs and liver (Toft et al., 1992a) . Conversely, exogenous corticosteroid administration results in a redistribution of lymphocytes from the peripheral blood, bone marrow and spleen to the lymphatic tissue in rabbits (Toft et al., 1992b) . Prolonged periods of stress cause neutrophilia and lymphopenia. Marked changes in white cell distribution with a relative neutrophilia and lymphopenia were found in a study of cortisol levels and haemograms of rabbits after transport, either by air or by lorry.

Carnivores eat Clinical Pathology Clinical Pathology periodically and have sudden large intakes of nutrients that must be stored for utilization during the fast between meals. Herbivores graze for long periods of the day and are continually absorbing nutrients from the digestive tract. In rabbits, volatile fatty acids are produced from bacterial fermentation in the caecum and are continually absorbed as an energy source. A fasting sample is difficult to obtain from a rabbit. Withholding food does not prevent caecotrophy and the digestion of caecotrophs provides a source of glucose. Blood samples taken after 96 h of food deprivation may show no alteration in blood glucose levels (Kozma et al., 1974) . Hyperglycaemia is a relatively common finding in rabbits and can be accompanied by glycosuria. Handling alone can cause an increase in blood glucose to the order of 8.5 mmol/L experimentally (Knudtzon, 1988) and 15 mmol/L or more anecdotally. Diabetes mellitus has not been described in pet rabbits and there is some difference of opinion about its importance as a clinical disease (Hoefer, 2000; Jenkins, 2000; Rosenthal, 2000) . Herbivorous animals withstand the absence of insulin more readily than carnivorous ones (Bentley, 1998) and are therefore not so susceptible to diabetes mellitus. Diabetes mellitus has been induced in laboratory rabbits by the administration of alloxan. It has also been described as a hereditary disease in rabbits. A laboratory strain was selectively bred as an animal model of human diabetes mellitus (Roth and Conaway, 1982) . Affected animals were polydipsic, polyuric and polyphagic with severely impaired insulin release. Elevated glycosylated haemoglobin values of 12.2% were observed in the overtly diabetic animals in comparison with 3.9% in normal animals. Increased glycosylated haemoglobin levels did not correlate with plasma glucose concentrations (Cannon and Conaway, 1981) . Histologically there was hypergranulation of b-cells > 1 mg/ml (< 0.5 mg/ mL indicates deficiency)",

The rabbit's urea metabolism is further complicated by urea utilization by caecal microflora during catabolism or during periods of dietary excess. Therefore, small fluctuations in serum urea concentrations are difficult to interpret. Laboratory reference ranges apply to animals that are fed a standard diet and have usually been fed at a specific time of day. Pet rabbits are subject to greater fluctuations in blood urea values due to the variation in diet and other factors, and can have values slightly higher than laboratory reference ranges. Prerenal azotaemia associated with poor renal perfusion occurs during periods of dehydration. The rabbit has a limited capacity to concentrate urea and a greater volume of urine is required when urea load increases (Brewer and Cruise, 1994) . Increased blood urea values were recorded in a study by Licois et al. (1978) of young rabbits with diarrhoea experimentally induced with coccidiosis. The authors suggested that the blood urea values rose as a result of intense nitrogen catabolism during weight loss associated with the disease. Water deprivation can lead to blood urea values as high as 40 mmol/L in association with creatinine values in excess of 200 mmol/L (Harcourt-Brown, unpublished data). Water deprivation can be due to a lack of available drinking water, caused either by an oversight by the owner or by a faulty mechanism on the drinking bottle.",

Potassium is an important ion in the maintenance of membrane potential.

To maintain electroneutrality, potassium ions shift from intracellular to extracellular fluid in exchange for hydrogen ions. In other species, hypoadrenocorticism (Addison's disease) reduces the exchange of sodium and potassium ions across the cell membrane and results in increased serum potassium and decreased serum sodium concentrations. Hyperkalaemia can be the result of impaired renal excretion of potassium due to kidney disease or from tissue trauma such as crushing injuries that release large amounts of potassium into the circulation. Acidosis causes a redistribution of potassium across the cell membrane to maintain electroneutrality. This leads to more potassium in the extracellular fluid compared with body stores and therefore hyperkalaemia. Artefactually high levels of potassium can result from leakage from red cells in haemolysed samples or those that have not been separated until several hours after the blood was taken.",

PTH stimulates conversion of (25-OH-D) to the active from of vitamin D (1,25-(OH) 2 D 3 ), which, in turn, stimulates intestinal absorption of calcium. PTH also stimulates osteoclastic resorption of bone to release calcium, phosphorus and magnesium into the circulation.

PTH assays have been performed on pet rabbits as part of an investigation of the possibility of metabolic bone disease as a cause of poor tooth and bone quality and the development of dental disease in rabbits (Harcourt-Brown and Baker, 2001) . Sample handling is of paramount importance as the hormone is labile and haemolysis interferes with the assay. Samples require separating and freezing immediately after collection and must be shipped in the frozen state to a laboratory. Sufficient, nonhaemolysed blood to harvest 1-2 mL of serum or plasma needs to be collected. As PTH is responsible for the minute-to-minute regulation of blood calcium, values can vary over a wide range, making interpretation of a single result difficult. Diet, age, pregnancy, lactation and diurnal rhythms cause physiological variations in results. Warren et al. (1989) reported PTH values of 59.6 \u00fe 41.2 pg/mL in a group of 29 non-pregnant farm and laboratory rabbits and Harcourt-Brown and Baker (2001) reported values of 40.3 \u00fe 10.7 pg/mL in a group of 12 pet rabbits kept outside under free-range conditions all year round. Values as high as 100-200 pg/ mL have been recorded in baseline samples from laboratory rabbits .

Urinary pH is usually 8-8.2. Rabbit urine is normally turbid due to the presence of calcium carbonate that can be seen as sediment in collected samples. The urine from anorexic, pregnant, lactating or young rabbits is often clear. The colour of normal urine can vary from pale yellow, to orange, brown or red, mimicking haematuria. Plant porphyrin pigments are the cause of red-coloured urine and can be distinguished from haematuria with urinalysis dipstick tests or microscopy. Alternatively, a Wood's lamp can be used, as urinary pigments fluoresce when exposed to ultraviolet light (Benson and Paul-Murphy, 1999) . In addition to the presence of calcium carbonate crystals, oxalate or ammonium magnesium phosphate crystals can also be found in normal rabbit urine. The specific gravity of rabbit urine is difficult to evaluate accurately due to the presence of mineral deposits (Goad et al., 1989) but is approximately 1.003-1.036. Traces of glucose and protein can be present in normal rabbit urine. As in other species, rabbit urine can be spun and the sediment examined microscopically for the presence of crystals, red cells, inflammatory cells and bacteria. Cultures can be taken to confirm bacterial infection and aid antibiotic selection. Examination of urine sediment stained with Gram stain can reveal E. cuniculi spores that are oval, strongly Gram-positive with a coiled filament inside (Patton, 2000; Pye and Cox, 1977) . Ketones may be detected in the urine of anorexic rabbits and is a poor prognostic sign as it is associated with the development of hepatic lipidosis.",

The first step in faeces examination is to determine which type of faeces has been collected. It is often samples of soft faeces or caecotrophs that are collected for examination because their consistency is abnormally loose or the owner has mistaken uningested caecotrophs for diarrhoea. Microscopically the two types of faeces are completely different. Hard faeces contain indigestible fragments of plant debris and little else. Caecotrophic material contains a wide range of micro-organisms, including large Gramnegative bacilli, Bacteroides, large metachromic staining bacilli and many other bacteria including oval and fusiform rods. In some types of diarrhoea, a mixture of indigestible fragments of plant material can be seen alongside a range of typical caecal microorganisms. This signifies a failure of the proximal colon to separate the indigestible and digestible fractions of the diet. Coccidial oocysts or eggs of the non-pathogenic oxyurid Passalurus ambiguus can be found in both hard and soft faeces of infected rabbits. Coccidial oocysts can be confused with a nonpathogenic Saccharomyces, a budding sporogenous yeast that can be present in large numbers in rabbit faeces (see Figure 2 .2). Clostridium spiroforme is a large Gram-positive, semicircular or spiral-shaped bacterium that may be seen in faecal smears from diarrhoeic rabbits or those that have died from enterotoxaemia. Centrifuging faecal material at 20,000 rpm for 15 minutes and Gram-staining the residue after the supernatant has been removed improves the chance of diagnosis (Langan and O'Rourke Schaeffer, 2000) . Although the presence of semicircular bacteria in the faeces or caecal material is suggestive of clostridial enterotoxaemia, it is not a reliable diagnostic criterion. Clostridium spp. can be present in the normal caecal flora and proliferate after death. The demonstration of the toxin and anaerobic culture of the organism is required for positive diagnosis (Carman and Borriello, 1983) .",

The faecal sample was from a 14-week-old, thin rabbit suffering from diarrhoea. Faecal material was emulsified with water before being passed through a fine sieve to remove the coarse debris. The homogenate was then centrifuged and the supernatant discarded. The residue was mixed with saturated salt solution and centrifuged again.

A cover slip was placed over the meniscus and the sample left for approximately 30 min for the oocysts or worm eggs to float to the top of the tube.

Several Eimeria spp. affect rabbits and mixed infections occur. The species can be differentiated by the morphological characteristics of the oocysts. The most pathogenic species is E. stiedae, which causes hepatic coccidiosis (see Section 14.4.1). Eimeria stiedae invades the epithelial cells of the bile ducts and can cause severe liver damage. Oocysts may be seen in faeces from infected rabbits or in smears of bile collected from rabbits during post-mortem examination. The relative sizes of coccidial oocysts and S. guttulatus can be seen in (A) and (B). (Worm eggs are larger than coccidial oocysts. The most common helminth infestation of pet rabbits is Passalurus ambiguus. Adult worms or ova from P. ambiguus may be seen in rabbit faeces. The ova are ovoid, slightly flattened and asymmetrical with a cap at one end.) (Image kindly supplied by Dr Sheelagh Lloyd, Division of Animal Pathology, University of Cambridge.) (C) Saccharomyces guttulatus (oil immersion). Saccharomyces guttulatus is a budding yeast that is commonly found in the faeces of rabbits, chinchillas and guinea pigs. It is not believed to be pathogenic. Some texts call the yeast Cyniclomyces guttulatus. (Image kindly supplied by Idexx Laboratories, Wetherby.) orientated in the same direction. A drop of mineral oil and a cover slip are applied before examining the shafts of hair under the microscope. Abrupt, fragmented, distal ends of the hair shaft suggest barbering by a companion. Egg cases, cuticles or adult mites, usually L. gibbus, may be seen attached to hair shafts. The presence of fungal spores in broken hair shafts plucked from a lesion is diagnostic of dermatophytosis. Dermatophyte infection can be demonstrated by the presence of mycelia or ectothrix arthrospores in potassium hydroxide preparations of macerated scale. Asymptomatic infections can be detected by brushing the entire body with a sterile toothbrush and incubating the brushings at 25 C on dermasel agar (Oxoid). Plates that do not show fungal growth within 3 weeks can be considered negative (Vangeel et al., 2000) . Dermatophyte infections are usually due to Trichophyton mentagrophytes, which does not fluoresce under ultraviolet light. Microsporum canis infections, which are evident from the characteristic apple green spores that fluoresce under a Wood's lamp, can also occur.",

Although Psoroptes cuniculi normally inhabits the ear canal, the mite can be found in other areas of the body such as the perineal skin folds and can be seen on microscopic examination of the exudate from affected areas. Skin scrapings may be required to demonstrate sarcoptic mange mites in scabies cases characterized by intense pruritus and crusty lesions. Dark field microscopy can be used to look for T. cuniculi organisms in crusty lesions suggestive of rabbit syphilis (Section 14.5.9). The organism is a motile corkscrew-shaped spirochaete. Lesions are found on the mucocutaneous junctions of the anus and genitalia or on the nose, lips and eyelids (see Figure 7 .16). The lesion is abraded with a sterile saline-soaked swab. Serum from the lesion is then expressed onto a slide and covered with a cover slip before being examined immediately (DiGiacomo et al., 1984) . The slide can be placed in a moisturized chamber. The differential diagnosis of exudative skin lesions in rabbits can be difficult and histopathological examination of biopsy specimens may be required.",
