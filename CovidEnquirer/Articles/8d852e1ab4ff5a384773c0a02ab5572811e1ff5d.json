Very limited information is currently available on the details of the active site and substrate/product binding during the catalytic cycle of these enzymes. We performed a comprehensive X-ray crystallographic study of mouse 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic nucleotide 3\u2032-phosphodiesterase (CNPase), a membraneassociated enzyme present at high levels in the tetrapod myelin sheath. We determined crystal structures of the CNPase phosphodiesterase domain complexed with substrate, product, and phosphorothioate analogues. The data provide detailed information on the CNPase reaction mechanism, including substrate binding mode and coordination of the nucleophilic water molecule. Linked to the reaction, an open/close motion of the \u03b25-\u03b17 loop is observed. The role of the N terminus of helix \u03b17-unique for CNPase in the 2H family-during the reaction indicates that 2H phosphoesterases differ in their respective reaction mechanisms despite the conserved catalytic residues. Furthermore, based on small-angle X-ray scattering, we present a model for the full-length enzyme, indicating that the two domains of CNPase form an elongated molecule. Finally, based on our structural data and a comprehensive bioinformatics study, we discuss the conservation of CNPase in various organisms.",

Outside the active site, sequence conservation between different clades of the superfamily is low, although the three-dimensional fold is similar [2, 4] . Structures of some 2H superfamily proteins, including archaeal 2'-5' RNA ligases [5] [6] [7] [8] , the human protein kinase A anchoring protein 18 central domain [9] , Bacillus subtilis YjcG [10] , and a hypothetical protein ATU0111 from Agrobacterium tumefaciens [Protein Data Bank (PDB) ID 2fsq], have been reported. Also, structures of plant cyclic phosphodiesterases (CPDases), as well as catalytic 2H domains from mammalian 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic nucleotide 3\u2032-phosphodiesterase (CNPase) and the regeneration-induced CNPase homologue (RICH) from fish, have been determined [4, [11] [12] [13] [14] . All the structures present two lobes, between which the active site is located. The 2H superfamily was initially discovered based on the 3\u2032-phosphodiesterase activity of homologous enzymes toward 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic nucleotides. Of all the 2H phosphoesterases identified by primary sequence analysis, only myelin CNPase [15] , RICH [16] , yeast CPDase [3] , yeast tRNA ligase [17] , plant CPDase [18] , and the Pyrococcus furiosus and Escherichia coli 2'-5' RNA ligases [6] have been characterized to contain this activity, while protein kinase A anchoring protein 18 lacks it [9] .",

The myelin sheath is a lipid-rich, multilayered membrane structure that enables the rapid transmission of electrical impulses in vertebrate axons. The C-terminal catalytic 2H phosphoesterase domain of CNPase hydrolyzes 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic nucleotides to 2\u2032-nucleotides, and the active site can accommodate polynucleotide substrates extended toward the 5\u2032-end, such as spliced tRNA halves [15, 21] or 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic NADP + (2\u2032,3\u2032-cNADP + ) [22] . The CNPase N-terminal domain is homologous to polynucleotide kinases (PNKs) [23] , although the sequence similarity is low. CNPase interacts with the cytoskeleton and cell membranes [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] , RNA [29] , and calmodulin [30] . A genetic knockout of CNPase results in axonal degeneration, incorrect local structures in myelin, and an increase in 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic AMP (2\u2032,3\u2032-cAMP) in the brain after injury [31] [32] [33] [34] .",

Based on structural data, mutation studies, and the well-known catalytic mechanism of RNase A [35] , a mechanism for the CNPase phosphodiesterase activity has been suggested [4, 11, 14] . Briefly, His309 activates a water molecule, which then nucleophilically attacks the cyclic phosphate and forms a pentavalent intermediate. The 3\u2032-oxygen is protonated by His230, and the 2\u2032-phospho product is released. Several active-site residues and conserved water molecules are important for the reaction, and hydrogen bonds to the HxTx motifs and conserved water molecules coordinate the ligand throughout the reaction [4] . The catalytic residues of the two HxTx motifs and four water molecules between them arrange in a 2-fold pseudosymmetry. Thus, the reason for CNPase stereospecificity, involving the coordination and correct orientation of both the substrate and the nucleophilic water molecule, must therefore lie in the active-site vicinity.",

These interactions must be crucial to the stereospecificity since the core active site is 2-fold pseudosymmetric. A fifth water molecule acts as the nucleophile. The earlier liganded CNPase catalytic domain structures were very difficult to obtain and had low ligand occupancies [4] . Hence, we used mutated variants of mouse CNPase to obtain high-occupancy complexes of the CNPase catalytic domain with ligands, including the reaction substrate, bound to the active site. Instrumental for success was the use of acetate or formate buffers instead of citrate, which apparently binds to the active site tightly, preventing ligand cocrystallization and soaking (unpublished results).",

A superposition of the substrate and product complexes indicates that it is mainly the phosphate group, which moves during the reaction, while a binding pocket for the product is created by the opening of the \u03b25-\u03b17 loop (Fig. 3b and c and Supplementary Fig. 3 ).",

The \u03b25-\u03b17 loop in the NADP + complex is in the open conformation, in line with the presence of the reaction product. The most likely explanation for the presence of the product is that the timescales of the enzymatic catalysis and crystallization are different and/or that the affinity of the substrate and product to the active site of the mutant protein in the crystal state may favor the product. The 2\u2032-AMP fragment of NADP + binds essentially as 2\u2032-AMP in the V321A mutant, and the pyrophosphate group is well defined in electron density. The nicotinamide rings were poorly defined in difference electron density prior to inclusion of the ligand molecule in map calculation; however, the final electron density maps show the conformation of this moiety (Supplementary Fig. 2i and j) . We attribute this behavior to the fact that the crystals were twinned. In each of the two monomers of the asymmetric unit, the nicotinamide/ribose unit apparently is in a slightly different conformation; however, it has a tendency to bind between a loop containing Pro226 and Tyr376 close to the C terminus of the phosphodiesterase domain (Fig. 5) . This groove could represent the continuation of a binding site for further nucleotide units in an RNA substrate. Furthermore, the N-terminal domain, likely to be responsible for high-affinity RNA binding [4] , is localized in this direction in the full-length protein.",

Both kinds of procedures resulted in very similar elongated models of full-length CNPase, where only a small area of close contact exists between the two domains (Fig. 6 ). All models also gave very good fits to the raw data (Supplementary Table 3 ). The models indicate that the CNPase active site is accessible in the context of the full-length protein in solution, not being covered by the N-terminal domain; the latter case would result in a more globular particle.

The model, based on synchrotron SAXS data and both ab initio and homology modeling, indicates that the PNK-like and the 2H phosphoesterase domains form an elongated assembly. This arrangement retains an open active site in the catalytic domain, with no apparent need for large-scale conformational changes prior to substrate binding. Earlier comparisons of full-length CNPase and its catalytic domain have shown that although the K m values for the substrate are similar, the isolated catalytic domain is approximately two times faster in catalysis than the full-length protein [39, 40] . It is likely that the N-terminal domain is involved in the binding of larger substrates, namely RNA molecules, the termini of which then would locate to the active site for catalysis. The electrostatic surface of the full-length CNPase model suggests the presence of a positively charged patch leading to the active site (Fig. 6e) . The roles of the conserved P-loop or the binding of other ligands, such as calmodulin [30] , in the regulation of RNA substrate binding and/or catalysis still remain to be determined. It is highly likely that homologous enzymes from the 2H family have similar domain arrangements between the PNK-like and phosphodiesterase domains. Indeed, in our recent experiments, we have seen similar molecular shapes for CNPase homologues (unpublished results).",

The archaeobacterial LigT-like clade is similar to E. coli 2'-5' RNA ligase, and members are found in archaea, bacteria, and chloroplasts [2, 41, 42] . These enzymes hydrolyze 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic phosphate in (oligo)nucleotides and join the produced 2\u2032-phosphate to a 5\u2032-hydroxyl group of another (oligo)nucleotide to form atypical 2\u2032,5\u2032-linkages [6, 41] . Such activity has not been reported for CNPase, and it may have been lost upon the emergence of helix \u03b17, which effectively blocks access to the active site from one direction, being also the direction of nucleophilic attack. In CNPase, the N terminus of helix \u03b17 coordinates the nucleophilic water, while in some other 2H phosphoesterases, the absence of this helix allows the entrance of a larger nucleophile, such as an RNA molecule, into the active site.",

CNPase is present in high amounts in oligodendrocytes and myelin of the mammalian nervous system, and CNPase activity is also present during development in chicken [51] and Xenopus nervous systems [52] . On the other hand, RICH, found in some actinopterygian fish, lacks the PNK-like domain of CNPase. A CNPase sequence with PNK-like and 2H domains is present in the sarcopterygian fish Coelacanth, which is more closely related to the ancestor of land-dwelling tetrapods [53] . Although no CNPase sequence from chondrichtyes is available, CNPase activity has been found in sharks and rays [49, 54] .

The ligand omit electron density maps were calculated by setting the ligand occupancy to zero and carrying out three rounds of simulated annealing refinement in phenix.refine.

A freshly prepared sample of monomeric bovine serum albumin was used as a molecular weight standard. Molecular weights were also determined without a standard protein from the SAXS data alone, using the SAXS MoW procedure [65] . The raw data were processed with BioXTAS RAW [66] , and the ATSAS package [67] was used for further analyses and structure modeling. Specifically, distance distribution functions were generated by GNOM [68] , and the programs DAMMIF, GASBOR, BUNCH, and CORAL were used for ab initio and rigid-body modeling [67, 69, 70] . Ten independent DAMMIF models were further averaged using DAMAVER [71] . A homology model for the CNPase N-terminal domain, based on the crystal structure of T4 PNK [72] , was obtained using the sequence of the CNPase N-terminal domain at the Phyre2 server [73] . Phyre2 uses a combination of sequence profile alignment and secondary structure prediction to find suitable models for homology modeling. This model and the crystal structure for the C-terminal domain were used as inputs for rigid-body modeling coupled to loop building in BUNCH and CORAL.
