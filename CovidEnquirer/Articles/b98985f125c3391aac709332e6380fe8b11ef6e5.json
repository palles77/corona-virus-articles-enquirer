These techniques have several disadvantages including poor sensitivity and long turn-around time. Molecular and mass spectroscopy techniques are rapidly changing infection diagnosis and management. Compared with conventional culture-based techniques, these modern approaches provide substantially more rapid and specific information on organism identification and on the presence of resistance mechanisms. These methods are expected to contribute substantially to enhancing antibiotic stewardship and to improving 'time to appropriate antibiotics', one of the most important factors in improving the prognosis of patients with life-threatening infections. This article gives an overview of some of the practical applications of these newer technologies.",

Several of these are available, helping to improve the accuracy of diagnosis. As molecular tests detect the presence of a gene rather than gene expression, it is important to correlate test results with clinical findings to help differentiate colonization (which may be detected in around 20% of hospitalized patients) from infection). 6e8",
