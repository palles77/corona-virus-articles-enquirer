Estimates from the past three decades emphasise that the present eff ort to contain the epidemic in the three most aff ected countries (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone) has been insuffi cient, with more than 24 900 cases and about 10 300 deaths, as of March 25, 2015. Faced with such an exceptional event and the urgent response it demands, the use of randomised controlled trials (RCT) for Ebola-related research might be both unethical and infeasible and that potential interventions should be assessed in non-randomised studies on the basis of compassionate use. However, non-randomised studies might not yield valid conclusions, leading to large residual uncertainty about how to interpret the results, and can also waste scarce intervention-related resources, making them profoundly unethical. Scientifi cally sound and rigorous study designs, such as adaptive RCTs, could provide the best way to reduce the time needed to develop new interventions and to obtain valid results on their effi cacy and safety while preserving the application of ethical precepts. We present an overview of clinical studies registered at present at the four main international trial registries and provide a simulation on how adaptive RCTs can behave in this context, when mortality varies simultaneously in either the control or the experimental group.",

            "text": "The crushing Ebola virus disease outbreak that has devastated parts of west Africa is the largest recorded in history and represents an unprecedented challenge for health policy, research, and ethics. 1 Although Ebola has aff ected people of all ages and both sexes, many of the people aff ected by the epidemic are young adults (aged 15-44 years) 2 who represent the social and economic backbone of already fragile local communities. The best available fi gures to estimate the size of the outbreak are chilling and underline a strong geographical inequity that shows the uneven capability of diff erent countries to aff ord interventions, to contain transmission, and to care for infected people. 2, 3 In the three most aff ected countries (Guinea, Liberia, and Sierra Leone), the eff ort to contain human-to-human transmission has been grossly insuffi cient. As of March 25, 2014 , WHO 4 reported 24 907 Ebola virus disease cases and 10 326 deaths (41% mortality): 3429 cases from Guinea (2263 deaths), 9602 cases from Liberia (4301 deaths), and 11 841 cases from Sierra Leone (3747 deaths). Other cases have been reported from Mali (eight cases, six deaths), Nigeria (20 cases, eight deaths), Senegal (one case), Spain (one case), UK (one case), and USA (four cases, one death). 4 Faced with such an exceptional event, WHO declared that it \"is ethical to off er unproven interventions with as yet unknown effi cacy and adverse eff ects, as potential treatment or prevention\". 5 Although this is a reasonable statement under the circumstances, some experts argued that well designed randomised controlled trials (RCTs) are both unethical and infeasible in the present circumstances and that researchers should fi rst try to ascertain which intervention is effi cacious by doing observational or non-comparative studies. 6 We argue that this represents an inferior strategy and that instead, RCTs should be used from the early stages of human experimentation of candidate Ebola interventions. 7, 8 What has been done until now",

By providing a virtually unbiased comparator, RCTs guarantee, at best, robustness of results about both the effi cacy and safety of investigational drugs. Thus, since the inception of RCTs, researchers have acknowledged that until an intervention has been proven benefi cial, randomisation is the most ethical approach and provides the best answer soonest. 7, [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] The idea that RCTs are ethically unjustifi ed in the present Ebola outbreak might be based on several widespread misconceptions.",

If a treatment does confer such great eff ectiveness, an RCT should be able to detect and document the eff ectiveness very quickly. However, if eff ectiveness is only slight, external com parators (both concurrent or historical) in observ ational series or non-comparative studies could be severely biased because of high and undocumented patient heterogeneity and will probably diff er systematically between patients who received treatment and patients who did not. By contrast, interim analyses in RCTs can, at best, inform clinical investigators on whether to proceed with the same randomised allocation, either shifting all patients to an intervention group with an eff ective treatment or stopping the Personal View treatment with a potentially unsafe drug. 7 The focus of an interim analysis is to respond rapidly to high quality data emerging from an RCT, rather than in an RCT without an interim analysis wherein researchers blindly treat and hope for a positive outcome. Second, non-randomised or compassionate use of various interventions might happen anyhow. The challenge is not to encourage additional compassionate use and so-called hints and guesses, but to put together a robust RCT agenda. In fact, for proposed inter ventions that do not have an established line of large-scale production, and whose availability is very restricted (eg, ZMapp), use in non-randomised studies, instead of RCTs, is not straightforward. Such use wastes the already small sample size of potential RCTs that could have been done with the restricted available stock and thus negates the chances of being able to understand whether these treatments are eff ective or are not. 33 Third, as recommended by WHO, 5, 34 well designed RCTs will ensure that all patients receive at least the best feasible care, which at present is standard supportive care, 28, 29 and that \"investigational therapeutic or prophylactic options should not divert attention or resources from the public health measures that remain the main priority in outbreak control\". 5 In this view, RCTs should be designed to have a control group with standard supportive care (as deemed feasible in the sites where the trials are done) and an experimental group, consisting of one or more new drugs in addition to the standard care. Moreover clinical centres should be able to implement infection control measures in advance to prevent health-care associated transmission of infection. The sponsors of such studies should provide the clinical facilities and adequate resources to ensure that the standard supportive care meets minimum requirements of good clinical practice. The rigorous implementation and monitoring of interventions that are agreed by consensus as being practicable in the context of local care, would help to set minimum ethically acceptable practices for treatment and infection control. By contrast, the deregulated scenario, where any new drugs with unproven effi cacy can be used, provides no such guarantee. Of course, we do not advocate that resources for RCTs should be drawn from the restricted Fourth, as also acknowledged by others, 36 some non-randomised clinical study designs could even undermine present thinking. Particularly, when scarcely available treatment is given to consecutive series of patients without them being randomly assigned to a treatment group; the patients selected might be systematically diff erent from their historical or contemporary control groups and the selection rules might choose sicker patients than the population average who might have the worst probability of responding, thus potentially condemning to failure even treatments that could have been eff ective in earlier stages of the disease than were treated.",

At present JIKI is the most ambitious trial in progress and since the start of enrolment, on Dec 17, 2014, the investigators have enrolled 80 participants after just 36 days. The main results presented were that mortality was positively associated with Ebola viral load; that favipiravir was generally well tolerated; and that a nonsignifi cant trend for reduced mortality was reported in those with the lowest Ebola viral load who received the drug by comparison with historical controls, whereas an opposite trend was reported in those with the highest Ebola viral load who received the drug.",

The primary goal of adaptive trials is to minimise the harm to study participants by exposing fewer participants to the burden and risks of research, and to benefi t more participants with the favourable treatment, by reducing time to obtain conclusive evidence compared with conventional RCTs. Nevertheless this fl exibility comes at a cost. Several issues could hinder the implementation of adaptive RCTs and reduce the internal and external validity of these studies. 39 First, adaptive trial designs are more complex to implement and analyse than standard RCTs. 34, 37, 38 Second, adaptive study designs seem most suitable for ",

Third, results of interim analyses might infl uence decisions of the data and safety monitoring boards, researchers, and study participants. Finally, adaptive designs usually include multiple interim analyses, which often leads to an infl ated type-I error; as such the adaptive framework should be kept as simple as possible. 35 However, a prudent adaptive design including a small number of clinical centres, a restricted number of interim analyses, and a well understood and validated adaptive framework could easily address all these issues. 37, 38 Conclusions For life-threatening diseases under the conditions of suboptimum standards of care 40 (such as with the present Ebola outbreak) RCTs that take a very long time to do would not be straightforward or would be unacceptable. 33, 39 However, dependence on non-randomised studies to assess the effi cacy and harms of interventions might be even worse than RCTs. New RCT designs, such as adaptive designs, can provide the best solution for researchers to obtain robust evidence on the merits of candidate interventions.",
