China-as both a developing and a transitional economy-represents an important case. This paper uses an international comparative perspective to examine how the health of China's population and other aspects of health system performance changed during the reform era. We draw on standard public finance and health economics theory, as well as the more recent incomplete-contracting theory of property rights, to summarize the comparative advantages of government and market for financing and delivery of health services, particularly in developing and transitional economies. We then describe and analyze against this theoretical background the transformation of China's health sector and recent commitment of government funds to move toward universal coverage.",

More recently, China has announced ambitious reforms aiming to achieve basic universal coverage by about 2010. The government has committed major new funds to the health sector, and expanded social insurance programs to the formerly uninsured majority. The New Cooperative Medical Scheme (NCMS) offers subsidized basic insurance in rural areas, and insurance programs have been piloted for the urban residents not covered by the Basic Medical Insurance (BMI) for formal sector employees. 1 Thus, 30 years into reform, as part of efforts to build a ''harmonious society'' and address the disparities across different segments of the population, China's leadership has launched major initiatives to correct perceived dysfunction in the health sector and meet the expectations of a population with ever-increasing per capita income. To understand the prospects for newly infused government funds to translate into effective health care service delivery and improvements in population health requires understanding the starting point: how China's health sector evolved over the first quarter century of reform.",

The first section examines how several key health status indicators have changed over the past few decades, compared to other countries and relative to income per capita. China began the reform era as an international outlier, having achieving high population health status for its relatively low per capita income level. One might have hoped that China's above-average economic growth would have reinforced China's previously above-average health indicators. Instead, compared to unprecedented economic growth, health status measures have improved more slowly, or even stagnated at the aggregate level, with growing population disparities. By 2000, life expectancy, infant mortality and under-five mortality rates were all about average for countries of similar per capita income. Sections 2.1 and 2.2 consider several alternative explanations for this ''regression to the mean,'' including the stresses of systemic transformation, reverse causality from health to subsequent growth, and changes in health care financing and delivery.",

Some developing Asian countries, such as Indonesia, experienced more balanced improvements in health along with GDP, but with similar overall results. 2 India, with a population also over one billion, has had lower life expectancy and higher infant mortality since 1980, with only a modest reduction in the gap by 2005; both China and India have had high out-ofpocket spending and large disparities between the rich and poor in terms of disease and financing burdens (Yip & Mahal, 2008) . In developing Asia, as elsewhere in the world, systems of health care financing and delivery are closely shaped by historical and cultural context; although China might benefit from specific elements of many systems and from the ''advantage of backwardness'' (Gerschenkron, 1962) , no single health system model offers a panacea. For example, South Korea and Taiwan have established National Health Insurance (in 1989 and 1995, respectively) , assuring their populations universal access to health care. Yet neither faces China's challenges in reaching a large rural population. China has borrowed from Singapore, implementing a system of individual Medical Savings Accounts combined with social risk-pooling funds. China has also built upon its own successful experience with subsidized rural community financing to extend NCMS to rural residents, and has largely followed a path similar to that of other transitional economies (in Eastern Europe and the Former Soviet Union) of adopting social insurance rather than a National Health Service model. Future reforms may feature a mixture of models designed to fit China's wide geographic and socioeconomic variations across provinces and rural versus urban areas.",

Indonesia achieved steady falls in under-five mortality rates along with increases in per capita income. By contrast, China's under-five mortality rate fell rapidly during a period of meager economic growth to a level that was by 1980 comparable to that of Indonesia in 1995. However, China's under-five mortality rate has virtually stagnated since then, while per capita income has grown dramatically (Wagstaff, 2004 The data show that China began the reform era as an international outlier, achieving high population health status for its relatively low per capita income. Indeed, China's dramatic improvement in population health between the 1950s and 1970s is well known (Hsiao, 1995; Jamison, 1984) . Over the reform era, economic growth outstripped improvement in health status indicators. Currently, health status indicators are about average for China's level of per capita GDP. This ''regression to the mean'' is evident in the infant mortality rate (Fig. 1) , the under-five mortality rate (Fig. 2 ) and life expectancy ( Fig. 3 ; also see working paper appendix Fig. 1 ). What factors explain China's experience? We explore several alternative explanations. (2000) . 4 Thus, an upward-sloping line suggests that the indicator (e.g., life expectancy or health expenditure) is higher in countries with higher per capita income. A downward-sloping line, such as for the infant mortality rate, shows the opposite: higher levels of income per capita are correlated with lower infant mortality. The appendix to the working paper (Eggleston, Wang, & Rao, 2005) presents seven additional figures that compare China to other transitional economies and OECD countries, using data from WHO (2002) and the Ministry of Health (1998, 2001).",

The vast majority of transitional economies -including all central and eastern European countries and republics of the former Soviet Union -suffered transformational recessions (Kornai, 1994) . China, in contrast, has grown continually throughout the past quarter century. Moreover, if systemic transformation -and its accompanying stress from unemployment, crime and drinking -played as important a role in shaping health in China as in Russia, the larger adverse health impact of transition would probably have been in urban areas, which are more similar to Russia and eastern Europe than are China's vast rural areas. Yet the largest stagnation in health improvement has been in China's rural, rather than urban, areas (Liu, Hsiao, & Eggleston, 1999) .",

The developing country context reinforces other traditional arguments for a government role as well. For example, imperfect and asymmetric information (about how diseases are spread, the importance of sanitation and nutrition, the addictive effects of smoking, the quality of health care and pharmaceuticals, etc.) is more acute and problematic for a semi-literate population than for a well-educated populace.

Institutional weaknesses exacerbate government failures as well as market failures. Limited administrative capacity suggests that complex, data-intensive payment policies and contracting mechanisms are infeasible or not cost-effective. Arguably these economies need to start simple (Eggleston, Posner, & Zeckhauser, 2000) and evolve toward ''international best practice'' using appropriate ''transitional institutions'' (as China has in other aspects of its reforms; Qian, 2000) or ''second-best institutions'' (Rodrick, 2008) . Fig. 4 illustrates how China's total health expenditures as a percentage of GDP have evolved in international comparative perspective. Between 1990 and 2000, China's health expenditures and GDP per capita both grew rapidly, with health expenditure growth outstripping growth in per capita income. Thus, although China pre-reform was a relatively low spender for its income level, by 2000 China's health spending (at 5.3% of GDP; Zhao, Gao, & Wan, 2002) was about average for its per capita income. Currently China spends about 5.5% of GDP on health. China spends more of its national income on health than India, Indonesia or Sri Lanka; about average for transitional economies (lower than most eastern European countries, but higher than most of the republics of the former USSR); and less than high-income OECD countries (see working paper appendix Fig. 2 ). In sum, China has devoted an increasing proportion of its national income to health and health care, and health spending growth does not seem unsustainable in light of China's income level and rate of economic growth.",

Most village doctors became private practitioners and now rely on fee-for-service payment. As a result of these changes, the fraction of Chinese with health insurance cover fell precipitously, from about 70% of the population in 1981 to only 20% by 1993 (World Bank, 1997), and has rebounded only since the 2003 implementation of NCMS.",

Zhang (2002) reports province-and municipal-level coverage rates in 2001 ranging from 13.9% in Chongqing to 60% or more in Fujian, Hunan, Qinghai and Tianjin. The majority of uninsured -workers' dependents, the self-employed, migrant and informal sector workers -paid out of pocket for health (2000). 8 MSAs and out-of-pocket payments primarily fund outpatient services. Inpatient care draws financing from the Social Risk Pooling Fund, usually after the employee pays a deductible equal to 10% of his or her annual wage. Patients are also responsible for co-insurance, with rates that are graded. The benefit package varies according to local economic conditions.

For urban health insurance reforms, for example, although firms are under pressure from local social insurance bureaus to pay insurance contributions, ''these agencies do not have the legal authority to force participation, because China does not yet have a social insurance law'' (Liu, 2002, 143) .

Although the concentration of retirees is higher in urban areas, they are clearly overrepresented in urban health insurance pools. Retirees constituted 24.9% of the insured population (canbao renshu; Ministry of Labor and Social Security, 2002, 643) , and the number of insured retirees was 33% of the number of insured employees (18,152,000/54,707,406; Ministry of Labor and Social Security, 2002, 644) .

For example, in Beijing and Tianjin in the early 2000 s, the ratio of retirees to currently employees was 59 and 50%, respectively (Ministry of Labor and Social Security, 2002, 644) . The insurance risk for supporting elderly retirees has not been spread over a large population, but concentrated on the employees of firms that join the formal sector social health insurance scheme. China has combated adverse selection partly by stipulating that the social insurance benefits cover only ''basic'' services. 9 Taken to an extreme, firms on the margin about where to locate might favor areas with low social insurance burdens, such as urban areas with a concentration of young workers (such as Shenzhen). This effect has been limited by the many other factors driving firm location decisions, and the ability of many firms to avoid social insurance payments even when located in areas with ostensibly mandatory contributions.",

These cross-subsidies ostensibly would assure that uninsured poor peasants could access basic services, while allowing health care providers to recover costs on ''market track'' services (since direct subsidies to government-owned providers declined precipitously; see Eggleston & Yip, 2004 and Eggleston, 2008) . 9 If the benefit package was more generous, as would be sensible to protect against catastrophic illness (e.g., Liu, 2002) , even fewer healthy, young workers -or firms that employ them -would find it attractive to participate. Although in principle supplementary insurance could fill the gap created by low-benefit basic coverage, commercial insurance companies have been understandably reluctant to expand with widely affordable supplementary insurance because consumers most eager to enroll would be high-risk. Some Chinese social insurance bureaus fill the gap by offering supplementary insurance directly (Zhenjiang and Suzhou) or through commercial insurance companies (Xiamen; Liu, 2002, 146) .",

Indeed, if a buyer could specify in a contract exactly what services, for whom, at what quality and cost, they wish to buy, then the ownership of the provider should not matter. In practice, however, contracts can never specify all the details about treatment for every patient. In developing and transitional economies, contracts are even less likely to be comprehensive and enforceable, so that perverse incentives for providers to skimp on noncontractible quality are even more of a concern. Health sector institutions such as the Hippocratic oath of medical ethics or the prevalence of nonprofit providers can be seen as responses to these concerns (Arrow, 1963) .",

Village doctors and individual urban providers became self-employed, charging for services on a FFS basis. Clinics and hospitals are mostly government-owned or operated by SOEs. Recently, however, Chinese policymakers have increasingly come to view government hospitals as a form of SOE, meriting experimentation with managerial autonomy, incentives and property rights reforms (Li & Song, 2002) . Some of the same trends driving ownership reform elsewhere in the economy -such as harder budget constraints and competitive pressures (Cao, Qian, & Weingast, 1999 ) -also spur property rights diversification in the health sector. Official policy now differentiates providers by ownership and tax obligations. Hospitals and other health care providers must register as government, private nonprofit, or private for-profit entities. Government and private nonprofits are tax-exempt and subject to administered prices. Government hospitals continue to receive some direct financial support from local or provincial governments. Private for-profit providers are free to set their own prices but required to pay taxes. Eggleston and Yip (2004) calibrate a simulation model of the impact of China's ownership and pricing reforms on cost, quality and access. Both theoretic and simulation results show how providing implicit insurance through distorted prices leads to over/under use of services by profitability, which in turn fuels cost escalation and reduces access for the poor. The authors suggest that regardless of ownership structure, broadened insurance coverage and mixed payment are better options than continued implicit cross-subsidies through distorted FFS. Lim, Yang, Zhang, Zhou et al. (2004) and Lim, Yang, Zhang, Feng, and Zhou (2004) also emphasize the need for careful sector-wide regulation and quality assurance.",

Arguably, by conventionally accepted methods of measuring affordability, China can afford to continue to have health spending increase at a rate slightly higher than GDP growth, and thus for the health sector to absorb an increasing share of GDP, for at least the next decade or two. Indeed, this will hold true if the experience of other developing and industrialized countries is any guide, because the elasticity of health spending with respect to per capita GDP appears to be greater than one (Gerdtham & Jonsson, 2000) . An aging population, epidemiologic transition to more chronic diseases, increasing obesity and smoking-related illness, along with a significant burden from communicable diseases like tuberculosis and HIV/AIDS-all these factors make it difficult to envision health spending not growing as fast as, if not faster than, per capita income.",

In fact, expanding insurance coverage and promoting population health are intimately intertwined. Consider one example: addressing the needs of China's ''floating population,'' the millions of workers who migrate from rural to urban areas in search of better employment and life opportunity. To date this population has been uninsured. Loss of productivity and poverty-induced illness for this population will adversely influence overall standards of living and economic growth, particularly since China's continued economic development will depend upon flows of labor out of agriculture and into urban industrial or service occupations. As labor mobility increases, epidemic diseases find an easy way to spread among the population. Expanding health coverage to the floating population will be critical for effective prevention and control of epidemic diseases and for closing the widening gaps in health status across subpopulations in China. Thus, the success of health reforms will be shaped to a large extent by how migrant workers are incorporated into the rural or urban insurance schemes and how effective population health initiatives are in reaching the migrant population.",

Theory does not dictate what the appropriate mix of public and private ownership is, and international experience provides mixed results (Eggleston et al., in press; Preker & Harding, 2003; Sloan, 2000; Shen, Eggleston, Lau, & Schmid, 2007) . Nevertheless, most established-market economies have moved toward public financing and pluralistic delivery. Although China initially moved in the opposite direction during the reform era -with less public financing and continued public delivery -recent reforms foretell greater convergence to international norms.",
