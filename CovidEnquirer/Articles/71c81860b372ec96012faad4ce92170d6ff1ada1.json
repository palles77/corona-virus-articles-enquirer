            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) is a coronavirus causing FIP that is characterized by polyserositis, vasculitis and severe lymphopenia (Addie et al., 2009) . This disease has fascinated cat researchers for already half a century (Holzworth, 1963) but up until now, it cannot be treated/ controlled in an efficient way. None of the conventional antivirals and therapeutics have been found effective against FIPV infection (Hartmann and Ritz, 2008) . At present, it is the most important viral cause of death in cats. The current hypothesis states that FIPV arises through mutation from the avirulent coronavirus feline enteric coronavirus (FECV) (Chang et al., 2010) . Additionally, FIPV is very immune evasive, especially toward the humoral branch of immunity (Pedersen and Boyle, 1980; Cornelissen et al., 2007; Dewerchin et al., 2008) . About 30 years ago, Pedersen and Black (1983) already stated that a strong cell-mediated immune response (CMI) is key to surviving a FIPV infection. Cats with a strong CMI would survive, while A strong cell-mediated immunity (CMI) is thought to be indispensable for protection against infection with feline infectious peritonitis virus (FIPV) in cats. In this study, the role of natural killer (NK) cells and regulatory T cells (Tregs), central players in the innate and adaptive CMI respectively, was examined during natural FIPV infection. When quantified, both NK cells and Tregs were drastically depleted from the peripheral blood, mesenteric lymph node (LN) and spleen in FIP cats. In contrast, mesentery and kidney from FIP cats did not show any difference when compared to healthy non-infected control animals. In addition, other regulatory lymphocytes (CD4+CD25\u00c0Foxp3+ and CD3+CD8+Foxp3+) were found to be depleted from blood and LN as well. Phenotypic analysis of blood-derived NK cells in FIP cats revealed an upregulation of activation markers (CD16 and CD25) and migration markers (CD11b and CD62L) while LN-derived NK cells showed upregulation of only CD16 and CD62L. LN-derived NK cells from FIPV-infected cats were also significantly less cytotoxic when compared with healthy cats. This study reveals for the first time that FIPV infection is associated with severe suppression of NK cells and Tregs, which is reflected by cell depletion and lowered cell functionality (only NK cells). This will undoubtfully lead to a reduced capacity of the innate immune system (NK cells) to battle FIPV infection and a decreased capacity (Tregs) to suppress the immunopathology typical for FIP. However, these results will also open possibilities for new therapies targeting specifically NK cells and Tregs to enhance their numbers and/or functionality during FIPV infection.",

            "text": "cats with weaker CMI would develop disease (Pedersen and Black, 1983) . Natural killer cells (NK) are part of the innate branch of CMI and play major roles in anti-viral control (Brandstadter and Yang, 2011) . They can lyse virus-infected cells directly, secrete pro-inflammatory cytokines or modulate ensuing innate and adaptive immune responses (Jonjic et al., 2008) . Regulatory T cells (Tregs) on the other hand are central players in the adaptive branch of CMI. They are characterized by the expression of CD4, CD25 and Foxp3 and function to maintain an immunological balance that allows to resolve pathogen infection while minimizing immunopathology. Virus-induced enhancement of Treg function and frequencies may lead to persistent infection and possibly pathogen induced pathology while subversion of Tregs (virus or host induced) may cause damaging immunopathology (Belkaid and Rouse, 2005; Li et al., 2008) . Foxp3 can also be expressed in other cells than classical Tregs, such as CD4+CD25\u00c0 cells, CD8+ T cells and CD21+ B cells. These cells have been shown to be implicated in tumor immunology and autoimmunity, where they have an immunosuppressive role (Han et al., 2009; Leavy, 2010; Mauri and Bosma, 2012) .",

Traditionally, mononuclear cells from blood are isolated over Ficoll-Paque, which typically produces a variable yield. Additionally, blood analysis by clinical labs takes some time to be performed, which can have a deleterious effect on cell viability during transport and subsequently on cell frequencies and functions (Bull et al., 2007) . That is why in these experiments, the absolute amount of cells was calculated with a combination of several methods. First, 10 ml of blood was taken from the vena jugularis in heparin (15 U ml \u00c01 ) (Leo, Zaventem, Belgium). Then, a blood smear was prepared and subsequently stained with a diff-quick staining (Gomez-Ochoa et al., 2012) . This staining provided the percentage of the lymphocyte population in the total white blood cell population. This percentage was then applied to the total white blood cell count from a diagnostic analysis. This gave accurate absolute lymphocyte counts in the whole blood. Finally, blood mononuclear cells were separated on Ficoll-Paque (GE Healthcare, Little Chalfont, Buckinghamshire, United Kingdom). Staining of the mononuclear cells (vide infra) then allowed identification and absolute quantification of all lymphocyte subsets. One cm 2 of kidney cortex, containing lesion tissue if present, and most of the mesentery was dissected from all cats and weighed afterwards. Cells in tissue were isolated by passing subsequently through tissue grinders (250 mM mesh) (Sigma-Aldrich, St. Louis, Missouri, USA) and cell strainers (70 mM mesh) (Becton, Dickinson and Company, New Yersey, USA). After isolation, cells were counted, frozen (PTLPD81, Orthodyne, Alleur, Belgium) and stored at \u00c0196 8C in liquid nitrogen.",

The Treg depletion that is seen during FIPV infection, somewhat contrasts other viral infections, which are nearly always associated with either an increase in Treg frequency or function (Keynan et al., 2008) . One exception is HIV infection, which is characterized by decreased peripheral Treg numbers. However, the latter appears to result from Treg trafficking to lymph nodes and other places of viral replication (Andersson et al., 2005) . More recent studies indicate that this Treg migration to sites of virus replication and lymphoid tissue is even vital for proper immune regulation (Belkaid and Tarbell, 2009; Campbell and Koch, 2011 ). In the current study, the opposite was noted, with extreme Treg depletion in all examined immunologic compartments. In addition, no evidence of elevated Treg numbers in inflamed tissue could be found. This depletion may likely contribute to the uncontrolled inflammatory responses that cause the typical immunopathology, which is lethal to FIPV-infected cats.",

Except for NK cells originating from the mesentery and Tregs originating from the LN, no significant differences could be observed. In the LN, Treg depletion was even more pronounced than in other lymphocyte populations, which may further influence immune responses since Treg homing to lymphoid tissue has been shown to be crucial for proper immune functioning . This indicates that the T and B cell depletion, typical for FIP cats, is also present to a comparable extent in the NK cell and Treg compartment. This depletion might be the result of apoptosis, like was found for T and B cells. Roles for several apoptosis-inducing factors (TNF-a, TRAIL and Fas ligand) have already been proposed (Takano et al., 2007) , but need to be verified. In addition to cell frequency, cell phenotype also plays an important role in the functionality of a particular cell type (Morishima et al., 2006) . Hence, the phenotype of NK cells originating from blood, LN and spleen were evaluated similar to Vermeulen et al. (2012) in healthy control and FIPV-infected cats. Due to low cell yield from the mesentery and kidney tissues, this analysis was not possible in these particular tissues.",

However, NK cell enumeration did not reveal an increase in NK numbers in inflamed mesentery and kidney and even a major decrease in the LN. Another possibility might be that certain subsets (e.g. CD62L\u00c0) of NK cells are more sensitive to the FIPV induced lymphopenia, resulting in a relative increase in CD62L+ NK cell numbers. This is not necessarily a disadvantage for the FIPV diseased cats, since recent developments in human immunology indicate that CD62L could be used to define an intermediate state of NK cell maturation that performs both the cytotoxic as well as the cytokine producing functions, two functions that are normally divided between CD56 dim and CD56 bright NK subsets in blood (Juelke et al., 2010) .

Similar results were seen in activated, inflamed human LN where significant increases in CD16+ NK cell frequencies were noted in comparison to non-inflamed LN (Romagnani et al., 2007) . The authors envisaged a system where, very early during an immune response, immature NK cells are recruited to LN from where they recirculate after maturation (e.g. acquisition of CD16). Our findings (relative CD16+ NK cell increase in both blood and LN and a relative increase of CD62L+ LN NK cells) agree with this hypothesis, giving the LN a central role in FIPV immunity. Lastly, FIPV LN also showed a significant decrease in relative NKT cell numbers (CD3+CD56+). This enigmatic subset often plays a crucial role in promoting and enhancing early innate and adaptive responses as has been shown for herpes simplex virus (Grubor-Bauk et al., 2008) . Virus-induced loss of these cells could compromise the host's capacity to control early virus infection and spread, resulting in higher viral loads as is the case for lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) and HIV (Tessmer et al., 2009) .",

(2012) . This test was only performed on NK (CD3\u00c0CD56+) cells from LN and spleen, since NK cell counts in blood from FIP cats were too low. NKT cells (CD3+CD56+) were also included in the functional assay, since these cells have recently been shown to possess NK-like cytotoxic abilities (Kuylenstierna et al., 2011) . Results revealed NK and NKT cells isolated from LN in FIP cats to be significantly less cytotoxic while splenic NK and NKT cells showed no differences in cytotoxicity. This indicates that, even though NK cells from FIP cats show a more activated phenotype and relatively more CD16+ cells, they display a reduced capacity to lyse target cells in vitro, in comparison with NK cells from healthy cats. Normally, viruses induce a NK response that is characterized by a higher cytolytic capacity (e.g. Herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1)) (Long et al., 2010) . Some viruses however, have evolved to induce lower functionality in NK cells (e.g. HIV and Hepatitis C virus (HCV)) (Meier et al., 2005) . One explanation for the lower cytotoxicity could be a proportional dysregulation of functional subsets, similar to the dysregulation seen in HIV-patients where less CD16+ NK cells (the cytotoxic subset) are detected. However, the opposite was found during FIPV infection, i.e. higher amounts of CD16+ cells. Another possibility could be a lowered granulation, a prerequisite for inducing cytolysis. To test this hypothesis, several antibodies against CD107a were tested. Unfortunately, none of these showed cross reactivity with the cat system. Finally, differences in NK cell homeostasis between several subsets could be present, through for example different survival or generation rates, which could lead to a proportional dysregulation similar as proposed for HIV infection (Meier et al., 2005) . Splenic NK cells did not reveal any differences in functionality between healthy and FIP cats. This could be the consequence of the different anatomy of the feline spleen, resulting in different trafficking patterns, which could take the edge of any virus-induced alternations in frequency, phenotype or functionality (Blue and Weiss, 1981; Mebius and Kraal, 2005) . Analysis of Treg functionality was not possible due to too low cell numbers in immunological compartments.",

This indicates that both cell frequency and function, are not associated with the disease pattern (effusive-non effusive) that follows infection nor in the disease severity (presence of lesions). Possibly, there are other cellular immunity associated factors, such as cytokine production and cell-trafficking behavior, that determine which disease type follows infection with FIPV. In addition, the difference between effusive and dry FIP in practice is rather challenging with cats commonly possessing a mixture of the clinical signs typical for the wet or the dry form (Berg et al., 2005; Hartmann, 2005) . The severity of the clinical signs, with regard to the magnitude of granulomas and the affected organs is also very diverse.

In the mesenteric lymph node, the relative reduction in Treg numbers was even greater than for T and B cells (Fig. 9) .

Additionally, despite their activated and migratory phenotype, NK cells were found to be less cytotoxic. These findings will translate in a reduced capacity of the innate immunity (NK cells) to battle acute virus infection and to aid ensuing immune responses and in a reduced capacity of the adaptive response (Tregs) to suppress the damaging inflammation that will lead to tissue damage. Further research, including more extensive cytokine and receptor profiling, will propose candidates for treatments that improve NK cell and Treg function and survival in order to strengthen the cats' immune response to FIPV infection",
