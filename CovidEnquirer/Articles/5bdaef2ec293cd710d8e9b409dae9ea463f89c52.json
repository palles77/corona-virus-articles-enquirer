Specific immunoglobulins (IgY) could be produced in egg yolk by immunizing hens with specific antigens. In the present study, we cloned the E. maxima gam56 gene, expressed the GST-GAM56 fusion protein and raised IgY to GST-GAM56 in hens. The anti-GST-GAM56 IgY antibody was isolated and used to treat chickens infected with E. maxima oocysts. Intramuscular injection of the antibodies provided minimal protection against parasite infection. However, oral dosing of the IgY 3 or 5 d after oocyst inoculation significantly improved body weight gain, reduced oocyst output and intestinal lesion score were reduced at 3 or 5 d after oocyst challenging, compared to the untreated control group. Our findings suggest that the IgY to gam56 could be an effective prophylactic or therapeutic agent against E. maxima infection in chickens and should have a practical application value.",

            "text": "Currently coccidiosis in poultry is controlled mainly by anti-coccidial drugs as in-feed medication. Alterna-tive control strategies are necessary because of the rapid emergence of drug resistant field strains of Eimeria (Chapman 1997) , high costs associated with the development of new drugs (Lillehoj 2000) and public concerns over potential adverse health effects from residual drugs in poultry products. Live vaccines containing virulent or attenuated strains of Eimeria are available, but these vaccines consist of several live Eimeria species, which are labour intensive and costly to produce (Vermeulen 1998) , limiting their use in the poultry industry. New control methods such as vaccination with recombinant proteins and genetic improvement of poultry immunity are now actively pursued (Wallach et al. 1992; Min et al. 2001) , but no effective recombinant vaccines are commercially available or offer acceptable protection. Eimeria parasites undergo a complex life cycle in the intestinal mucosa of infected chickens. Transmission of coccidiosis occurs by ingesting oocysts which develops as a result of fertilization of macrogametes by microgametes (Wallach et al. 1992) . Studies have shown that monoclonal antibodies raised against a 56 kDa gametocyte surface glycoprotein of the avian parasite E. maxima significantly reduced oocyst production in passively immunized chickens (Wallach et al. 1990 ). In addition, laying hens immunized with purified 56, 82 and 250 kDa E. maxima gametocyte antigens transferred very large amounts of maternal antigametocyte antibodies to their offspring via the yolk (Wallach et al. 1992) .",

Fecal oocyst output of the infected chickens treated with 3 mL IgY was 3-4 fold lower than the challenged control group, and the mean intestinal lesion score of the same IgY-treated groups was 1-1.8, compared with 3.4 for the challenged control group.

These parameters in the groups dosed with 0.3 mL IgY were not significantly different from the challenged controls. Wallach et al. (1990) demonstrated that monoclonal antibodies to E. maxima GAM56 and GAM82 antigens provided partial protection against E. maxima infection. Monoclonal antibodies against the GAM82 antigen cross-reacts with the GAM56 antigen, suggesting the two antigens have common epitopes (Wallach et al. 1990 ). Our laboratory identified the common epitope shared by the GAM56 and GAM82 antigens using the DNAMAN and DNAStar softwares and predicted the co-epitope of the two proteins (Zhang et al. 2007) . In this study, we cloned the common epitope fragment of the gam56 gene from the purified E. maxima Beijing strain. The sequence has 99.9% identity to the reported sequence of gam56 from the same Eimeria species (GenBank accession no. AY129951).

Immunity to the gametocyte stage of E. maxima development may not only effectively block parasite transmission but also reduce the pathogenicity of the parasite. In our study, IgY to GST-GAM56 was raised by immunizing chickens with the recombinant GST-GAM56 fusion protein. Oral administration of the IgY conferred partial protection of chickens challenged with E. maxima oocysts. The anti-GST-GAM56 IgY administered orally 3 or 5 d postinfection improved body weight gain and reduced oocyst output and intestinal lesions. Administration of the IgY by the oral route 1 d after oocyst inoculation was less effective, compared to the oral dosing 3 or 5 d after challenge. Our study results are consistent with the development cycle of E. maxima. Gametocytes of E. maxima develop 4 or 5 d after oocyst inoculation, and gametocyte antibodies emerge late in the course of infection, generally between d 4 and 8 post infection (Rose and Long 1971) .",

The thawed yolk-PBS solution was centrifuged at 10 000\u00d7g for 10 min at 4\u00b0C. IgY was purified from the PBS supernatant using PEG 8000 according to Polson et al. (1985) . Briefly, pulverized PEG 8000 was added to the supernatant to a final concentration of 3.5% (w/v). Following centrifugation at 2 000\u00d7g for 30 min, the solution was separated into a semi-solid precipitate and a clear liquid fraction with a yellow fatty layer floating on the surface. The liquid supernatant and the fatty layer were decanted through a fine muslin to remove the fatty layer. The liquid fraction containing water soluble IgY was collected. The protein content of the egg yolk-PBS solution and the IgY fraction was estimated by UV spectrophotometry at OD 260 nm and OD 280 nm .",

One group as the unchallenged control was not inoculated or treated with IgY, and one group as the challenged control was inoculated but not treated with IgY. Six days after infection, 3 chickens of each group were euthanized and lesions of small intestines were scored blind according to Johnson et al. (1970) with grades ranging from 0 (no lesions) to 4 (severe lesions). The remaining chickens were maintained for examination of oocyst production between 6 and 8 d after infection using a previously described method (Talebi 1995) . The chickens were weighed immediately prior to oocyst inoculation and 8 d post inoculation to determine weight gains.",
