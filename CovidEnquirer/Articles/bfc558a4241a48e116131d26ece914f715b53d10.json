            "text": "Upon maturation, primary rat oligodendrocytes become resistant to coronavirus JHM (JHMV) infection at an early stage. Involvement of cAMP-dependent protein kinase (PK) in the regulation of oligodendrocyte differentiation has been established (S. Beushausen et al. (1987). J. Virol. 61,[3795][3796][3797][3798][3799][3800][3801][3802][3803]. An inducer which accelerates maturation, dibutyryl cyclic AMP (dbcAMP) also upregulates the expression of the regulatory subunit, R1 of PK1. Since (i) early block preventing infection of mature oligodendrocytes can be bypassed when transfection with genomic RNA is used and (ii) inhibitors of PKs counteract the dbcAMP effect, so as to alleviate the inhibition of JHMV, enhanced expression of R1 appeared to be connected with virus restriction. This idea was confirmed following upregulation of the R1 gene in fully permissive L-2 cells. There was a connection between an effect due to R1 and dephosphorylation of the nucleocapsid protein N by an endosomal phosphoprotein phosphatase (PPPase) having the properties of types 1 or 2A enzyme which occurs during penetration of inoculum virions. An inhibition in vitro (cell free) of N dephosphorylation by R1 together with evidence that in vivo (cell culture) overexpression of R1 inhibited the endosomal PPPase as well as replication of JHMV supports the hypothesis that uncoating of the JHMV inoculum occurs after dephosphorylation, a step obligatory for dissociation of the N protein from the genome. Thus inhibition by R prevents uncoating and thereby interferes with the commencement of replication. These observations intimate the existence of a novel mechanism controlling a virus infection of specific cell target(s) undergoing a process of differentiation and maturation in the central nervous system. \u1b67",

Treatment with H-8 alone did not appreciably decrease the quantity of R1 present in controls (lane 2 vs 3). When both H-8 and dbcAMP were added R1 induction was abrogated (lane 5), demonstrating that in oligodendrocytes presence of low amounts of R1 appears to be The above results led us to extend our enquiry into changes in phosphorylation of N during virus penetration, specifically whether dephosphorylation is required for initiating JHMV replication. For this purpose, we employed calyculin A, a reversible inhibitor of PPPases (Ishihara et al., 1989) . L-2 cells were treated with the drug for 30 min either before inoculation or 2 hr after initiating penetration. As a measure of JHMV replication, titers of virus released by 10 hr postinfection into the medium were determined. As evident from Fig. 4 , when 100 nM calyculin A was applied in advance of inoculation, the JHMV titer was reduced about 1.5 log 10 PFU/ml as compared with virus generated by cells treated with calyculin A commencing 2 hr postinfection. These data are consistent with the idea that dephosphorylation by a PPPase activity may be re- of N, L-2 cells were treated with various concentrations of the inhibitor prior to inoculation as described for Fig. 4 . Samples taken 1 hr postinoculation were subjected to Evidence that MW modulation of N is related to the immunoblotting employing anti-N antibodies. As evident state of phosphorylation from Fig. 5 , conversion of N from the 56-to 50-kDa MW form was reduced by calyculin A in a concentration-de-A relationship between the 56-kDa N present within virions and a related 50-kDa protein was previously es-pendent manner, as was to be anticipated if dephosphorylation of N was being affected. From these combined re-tablished using 2-D tryptic peptide mapping (Cheley and Anderson, 1981) and anti-N monoclonal antibodies (MAb) sults, it was concluded that dephosphorylation of N is an early event during virus-cell interactions which may be (Coulter-Mackie et al., 1985) .

Other evidence from several laboratories supports the view that MHVs, including JHMV, can penetrate by receptor-mediated endocytosis into vesicles possessing the structure of ''coated pits'' (David-Ferreira and Manakar, 1965; Flintoff and van Dinter, 1989; Krzystyniak and Dupuy, 1984; Mizzen et al., 1985) . The current study reveals that dephosphorylation of N from inoculum virions is most probably catalyzed by a PPPase associated with endosomes. Combined evidence from this study and a previous investigation (Mohandas and Dales, 1991) characterized the relevant PPPase as one which functions optimally at neutral pH and is sensitive to okadaic acid and calyculin A, two inhibitors of phosphatases type 1 and 2A. These observations led us to the hypothesis that JHMV uncoating may be initiated within early endosomes. The uncoating process whereby the RNA genome dissociates from the capsid N protein, follows dephosphorylation and subsequent breakdown of N. Presumably, the relevant endosomal PPPase is maximally active at neutrality, the pH milieu likely to prevail on the cytosolic face of the membrane, regardless of the pH optimum for virus-cell membrane fusion (Gallagher et al., 1991; Kooi et al., 1988) . Latency of this PPPase, i.e., it becomes more active after solubilization of membranes, as demonstrated in Mohandas and Dales (1991) , implies that in host cells the enzyme occurs in membranes at a site where it can function to dephosphorylate N as the N-RNA complex is released from inoculum viri- PPPase becomes directly relevant to interference with the uncoating process of JHMV.",
