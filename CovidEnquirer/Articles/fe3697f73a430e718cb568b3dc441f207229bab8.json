In this study, 35 exacerbations associated with the isolation of non-typeable Haemophilus influenzae from sputum were identified as part of a prospective longitudinal study. Samples from these patients were subjected to immunoassays to identify a new immune response to the homologous isolate of non-typeable H. influenzae to more accurately assess a bacterial etiology. These patients also were studied carefully for evidence of viral infection using viral culture, serology and polymerase chain reaction-based assays. Sixteen of 35 exacerbations (45.7%) were associated with evidence of acute viral infection and 11 of the 35 exacerbations (31.4%) were associated with the development of new serum IgG to homologous non-typeable H. influenzae. Overall, evidence of infection with a respiratory virus or non-typeable H. influenzae was seen in 24 of 35 exacerbations (68.6%). No association between viral infection and immune response to non-typeable H. influenzae was observed, although a trend toward an immune response to non-typeable H. influenzae and absence of viral infection was seen. The results show that exacerbations in adults with COPD were associated with infection caused by virus alone, nontypeable H. influenzae alone, or virus and non-typeable H. influenzae simultaneously.",

These exacerbations are associated with substantial morbidity, lead to approximately 2 million hospital admissions annually, cause respiratory failure requiring mechanical ventilation in some patients, and are an important cause of death in COPD [1] . Exacerbations are caused by a wide range of factors, including viral infection, bacterial infection, allergy, \u00a3uid overload, environmental factors and others [1, 2] . In order to develop successful strategies to better treat and prevent exacerbations, it will be important to elucidate more precisely the etiology of exacerbations.

Viral pathogens have been identi\u00a2ed by viral cultures, analysis of clinical samples by the polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and by serological tests. Since these assays are not routinely performed, the diagnosis of a viral infection is generally a presumptive, clinical diagnosis by the practicing physician. Several studies which utilized assays to identify viral pathogens have established that viral infection is associated with a signi\u00a2cant proportion of exacerbations of COPD [3^7] . One study demonstrated that respiratory tract viral infections were present in 23% of hospitalizations in adults with COPD and in 45% of those admitted during winter months [3] .",

            "text": "The demonstration of a new immune response to nontypeable H. in\u00a3uenzae isolated from the sputum at the time of the exacerbation provides evidence that the organism caused the exacerbation. Eleven of the 35 exacerbations (31.4%) were associated with the development of new serum IgG to the homologous isolate detected in whole cell ELISA. Although the demonstration of new serum IgG to non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae provides supportive evidence that the organism in the sputum was etiologic, no gold standard exists for unequivocally identifying the organism as the cause of an individual exacerbation. Some patients who experience exacerbations due to bacteria may develop an immune response which is not detected by using whole cell ELISA with serum. For example, a mucosal immune response can occur independent of a systemic immune response [32, 33] . Indeed, in a recent study, analysis of systemic and mucosal antibody responses to Moraxella catarrhalis isolated during exacerbations of COPD revealed instances of the development of mucosal IgA responses in the absence of serum IgG responses to the homologous isolate [34] . Similarly, cell-mediated immune responses to antigens of non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae may occur in adults with COPD independent of antibody responses [35] . Therefore, the absence of a new serum IgG response does not exclude the possibility that the exacerbation was caused by non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae. Further- more, it is possible that colonization with an isolate of non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae may induce an immune response, even in the absence of a clinical exacerbation. In spite of these limitations of measuring new serum IgG to non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae, several elements of the design of the present study should be emphasized. First, the homologous isolate was used as the antigen in ELISA for all assays. A serious limitation of a large number of published studies on the immune response to nontypeable H. in\u00a3uenzae is the use of laboratory strains or heterologous isolates to detect immune responses [8] . The antibody response following infection with non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae is predominantly directed at strain-speci\u00a2c epitopes [9^14]. Therefore it is important to use homologous isolates to measure immune responses to non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae as was done in this study. Second, adult human serum contains 'background' antibodies to many antigens of non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae. These antibodies are cross reactive with antigens on other bacteria and do not bind to the surface of non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae; thus, the antibodies are unlikely to mediate protective immune responses. The present study utilized whole bacterial cells in ELISA to increase the likelihood that antibodies which bind to the intact bacterial cell were detected.",

Serum from prior to the onset of symptoms was used as the pre-exacerbation serum. Such samples are preferable to 'acute' serum collected at the time of the exacerbation since partial antibody responses may already be developing by the time the patient is evaluated. Furthermore, assays of pre-and post-exacerbation serum allowed us to detect exclusively new antibody responses in spite of the presence of varying titers of background antibodies.",

While a trend in this direction was observed, the data did not support this hypothesis. This study showed that exacerbations may be caused by virus alone, non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae alone, or virus and non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae simultaneously. In the case of evidence of simultaneous infection by virus and non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae, several interpretations are possible. First, the exacerbation may be caused by virus and H. in\u00a3uenzae is a colonizer that induces an immune response. Second, a viral infection may be the initial inciting event in the exacerbation and secondary infection with non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae occurs. This scenario has been proposed in several respiratory tract infections including otitis media, sinusitis and exacerbations of COPD. Third, a virus may be causing upper respiratory tract infection while the lower respiratory tract symptoms characteristic of an exacerbation are caused by non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae. It is not possible to draw a conclusion regarding these possibilities based on the data in the present study.",

A total of 45.7% of these exacerbations were associated with evidence of viral infection and approximately one third were associated with the development of serum IgG responses to the homologous isolate of non-typeable H. in-\u00a3uenzae; overall, two thirds of exacerbations were associated with a viral infection or a rise in serum IgG to the homologous isolate of non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae. The data indicate that exacerbations may be caused by virus alone, non-typeable H. in\u00a3uenzae alone, or virus and nontypeable H. in\u00a3uenzae simultaneously. These results highlight the challenge facing practicing physicians who treat patients with exacerbations of COPD and emphasize the need for better methods to accurately identify the etiology of exacerbations of COPD.",
