The first stage uses data envelopment window analysis (DEWA) to assess regional hotel sectors' technical efficiency over time. Unlike previous studies, the second stage uses a dynamic Tobit model to investigate the impact of macro contextual factors on the hotel sector efficiency. The study chooses the Chinese hotel industry during the period 2001-2006 as its application setting. The findings of the investigation indicate that the Chinese hotel industry is approaching an efficient operation in general, recovering from a major dip in 2003 resulting from the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) outbreak. In addition, the study introduces a novel two-dimensional efficiency-based matrix to assess the competitive advantage of different regions of the Chinese hotel sector. The paper presents strategic market implications for hoteliers, government decision-makers, and destination management organizations. The proposed methods are applicable for situations in which an exogenous event of a destabilizing impact (e.g., SARS) does occur.",

Typically, industry evaluations of the performance of the hospitality industry are based on average occupancy rates and average room rates, by revenue per available room (Wassenaar & Stafford, 1991) , or by breakeven room occupancy (Wijeysinghe, 1993) . Such indicators, however, only give a single dimensional snapshot of the intricate hotel industry. Anderson, Fish, Xia, and Michello (1999) point out the difficulty of drawing conclusions about the relative productivity of the hotel industry without simultaneously considering the mix and nature of services provided.

DEA is a non-parametric, multi-factor, productivity analysis tool that utilizes multiple input and output measurements to evaluate a number of relevant decision making units' (DMUs) relative efficiency. For the regional hotel sector, technical efficiency refers to a comparative measure of the effectiveness with Journal of Business Research 65 (2012) 59-67 \u2606 The authors thank anonymous reviewers, the JBR guest editors, and Gary H. Chao (Kutztown University) for their insightful comments and suggestions. which evaluators use a given set of inputs, such as labor and capital, to produce a targeted set of outputs, such as revenue and room occupancy. When explicitly taking into account the mix of service outputs produced, DEA is best suited to the comparison or benchmarking of a number of similar operational units (Donthu, Hershbergerb, & Osmonbekove, 2005) .",

Recently, Chen (2009) also recognizes that the performance evaluation factors in the hospitality industry are multidimensional in nature and can hardly be aggregated using price or cost figures, and he acknowledges the usefulness of the DEA technique in the hospitality industry. Chen (2009) proposes a modified DEA model to measure the performance of a Taiwanese hotel chain. Similarly, Botti, Briec, and Cliquet (2009) apply the DEA method to examine French hotel chains, and they conclude that no specific organization form (e.g., plural forms versus franchise and companyowned systems) is more efficient than another. Motivation for the present study comes from the fact that the majority of DEA studies in the hospitality industry are static in nature, based mainly on crosssectional data at the individual level of hotel entities. The present study assesses the hotel industry at the aggregate level of the regional hotel sector coupled with a dynamic analysis of DEA, monitoring technical efficiency and stability behavior over time. The study also identifies the critical antecedents of technical efficiency. Previous research focuses on the micro contextual factors (Hwang & Chang, 2003; Yang & Lu, 2006) , however, the influence of macro socioeconomic factors needs further consideration. The present study partially fills the gap by focusing attention on the antecedents of technical efficiency at the regional hotel sector level in China.",

Specifically, the study employs a data envelopment window analysis (DEWA) in conjunction with a dynamic Tobit model (unlike previous studies that use exclusively a static Tobit model) to examine antecedents of DMUs' relative efficiency over time using the Chinese hotel sector at its aggregate regional level as the application setting. Based on the obtained relative efficiency measures together with their fluctuations over time, the paper extends the DEA application within the literature by introducing a novel two-dimensional efficiency-based matrix to assess the competitive advantage of different regions of the Chinese hotel sector. The designated matrix serves not only as a tool for market segmentation, but also as a thoughtful basis for strategic decision-making and performance management that would be of help to government decision-makers, hoteliers/investors, and destination management organizations (DMOs). The methods of analysis mentioned above appear appropriate as the studied period (i.e., 2001-2006) includes an exogenous event of a destabilizing impact (i.e., SARS in 2003).",

However, this section reviews only DEA studies relevant to the scope and purposes of the present study. A distinguishing feature of the DEA approach is that no priori assumption is required about the analytical form of the production function. More specifically, for each DMU, the study calculates a single relative ratio by comparing total weighted outputs to total weighted inputs for each unit without requiring any specific functional form. W\u00f6ber's (2002) book provides more details. Notably, applying the DEA technique at the spatial (national or sub-national) dimension is appropriate and represents a recent trend in the literature (Bosetti, Cassinelli, & Lanza, 2006; Hsu, Chao, & Luo, 2008) . The present study focuses on technical efficiency estimation at the regional level for the Chinese hotel industry. Table 1 identifies number of notable studies employing the DEA approach to measure efficiency in the hotel industry. The table classifies the studies as static (based on cross-sectional data) or dynamic (based on panel data) and highlights the inputs and outputs utilized in each study. W\u00f6ber's (2006) work offers an extensive literature review on DEA applications in the tourism and hospitality industry published between 1986 and 2006. Pulina, Detotto, and Paba (2010) also provide a review of notable DEA applications published between 2006 and 2009.",

Though the outcome may still be useful, a dynamic context sheds additional light on the trend of DMUs' relative efficiency. Trend analysis can give rise to a seemingly excessive use of resources intended to produce beneficial results in the future. As such, researchers should prefer panel data (i.e., balanced longitudinal data) over purely cross-sectional data in that they not only enable researchers to compare a DMU with its counterparts but also allow them to track an individual DMU over a period of time for movement in efficiency (W\u00f6ber, 2002) .",

Note that the top tourist attractions (namely national 4A grade tourist attractions) located in these nine regions account for approximately 40% of all of China's top tourist attractions, indicating that these regions possess relatively more attractive tourism resources. The tourist attraction factor contributes to inducing domestic and foreign tourists, thus creating a stable market for the local hotel sector. B.

Five DMUs (i.e., Beijing, Shanxi, Jiangxi, Qinghai, and Ningxia) are found in the quadrant.

Thus, the study further analyzes technical efficiency scores using a dynamic Tobit regression model (with the GLM heteroskedasticityrobust variance matrix estimators) to identify potential antecedents of technical efficiency for the Chinese hotel industry. Since the technical efficiency of a region's hotel sector would range between zero and one (a region with an efficiency value of one (1) is located on the frontier and is considered to be the most efficient DMU in the pool, while a region with a lower score implies less efficiency), the dynamic Tobit model is an appropriate method for estimating the relationship between the designated explanatory variables and a truncated dependent variable.

Notably, industrial organization (IO) economics identify industry attractiveness as the primary foundation for superior profitability (Grant, 1991) , which implies that hotel operation is concerned primarily with seeking favorable market environments and a moderate level of competition. In particular, the resource-based theory of traditional IO economics emphasizes that resources are the cornerstone of a firm's profitability (Conner, 1991) , while the structure-conduct-performance (SCP) paradigm emphasizes that structural characteristics of an industry have a sizable influence on the performance of firms within an industry (McWilliams & Smart, 1993) . Accordingly, subjecting the performance of hotels to tourism resource and attractiveness, market competition and regional trade openness would be advantageous. In addition, empirical studies indicate that employees' education and earning levels influence a firm's performance (Holzer, 1990; Ismail & Sulaiman, 2007) . Therefore, the independent variables of the proposed model are the historical average technical efficiency score (HTE), richness of tourism resource (RTR), international tourism attractiveness (ITA), education (EDU), payment levels of employees (EARN), market competition (NH), regional trade openness (TO), and a time (2003) dummy variable (DUMMY).

More specifically, to introduce dynamism, the study incorporates the historical average technical efficiency score (HTE) in the immediate past year into the Tobit model to capture possible inherent efficiency performance in a DMU. The result is a total of 155 observations (31 regions across five years for the dependent variable ranging from 2002 to 2006). The study measures the contextual factors in the dynamic Tobit regression model in the same year as the dependent variable (TE). The contextual factors include (1) the richness of the tourism resource (RTR) in a region, measured by the percentage of national A-grade tourist attractions within a particular region; (2) the international tourism attractiveness (ITA) in a region, indicated by the ratio of inbound arrivals received by a particular region to the total inbound arrivals to China; (3) education level of employees (EDU) in a region, the proportion of urban employees with senior high school education or higher; (4) average annual earnings of employees in a regional hotel sector (EARN); (5) the number of hotels (NH) in a region, an indicator of the intensity of market competition within a particular region; (6) the degree of trade openness (TO) for a specific region, measured by the ratio of trade (regional imports plus exports) over regional GDP; and (7) The study uses education composition of urban employees in a specific region as a surrogate variable because data related to educational attainment were not available for the hotel sector at the regional level. Moreover, as raw data related to variables EARN and NH are relatively larger in size and more skewed than the other independent variables, the researchers transform these two variables using the natural logarithm function before they are incorporated into the dynamic Tobit regression model. The notes for Table 5 list the sources of data pertaining to the independent variables of the dynamic Tobit regression model.",

            "text": "The proposed dynamic Tobit model is inherently cross-sectional and its estimation would yield inconsistent estimators, particularly in the presence of heteroskedasticity in the error terms. The heteroskedasticityconsistent covariance matrix estimators, also known as robust covariance estimators, are a common tool used for variance estimation of parameter estimates. Kauermann and Carroll (2001) examine and derive the properties of such estimators. With its increasing use in the econometric literature as well as with the growing popularity of generalized estimating equations, such estimators are available in a variety of software packages equipped to estimate Tobit regression models. In this regard, this study employs the software package Eviews using the option GLM Robust Covariance to estimate the dynamic Tobit model together with its static counterpart. Table 5 indicates that, for the dynamic Tobit, six of the eight proposed predictors are statistically significant at or better than the .07 level. Specifically, the coefficients of historical technical efficiency (HTE), international tourism attractiveness (ITA), education level of employees (EDU), and average annual earnings of employees (EARN) have a positive impact on technical efficiency (TE) for the hotel sector in a region, while the degree of trade openness (TO) and the time dummy have a negative impact on the dependent variable. For the static Tobit model routinely used in the tourism and hospitality literature where the lagged average efficiency variable HTE is absent, the coefficient of the DUMMY variable is statistically insignificant. This result would mean, contrary to Fig. 1 , that the SARS event has had no impact on the aggregate efficiency of the Chinese hotel industry during the studied period (2001) (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) . Furthermore, a Wald test statistic (Kutner, Nachtsheim, Neter, & Li, 2005) given by (Z HTE ) 2 = 128.82, distributed as \u03c7 2 with one degree of freedom, is significant at the .001 level. These findings imply that the proposed dynamic Tobit model fits the technical efficiency data much better than its static counterpart.",

First, the coefficient of the time dummy variable is negative and highly significant, which means that the technical efficiency dropped dramatically in 2003, consistent with Fig. 1 . Second, international tourism attractiveness (ITA), indicated by the proportion of inbound arrivals, shows a positive influence (p-value = .07) on regional hotel sectors' technical efficiency. That is, as a region receives more inbound arrivals, its hotel sector tends to operate at higher technical efficiency. Inbound arrivals may indicate longer duration of travel and higher travel budget than that of domestic tourists. As a result, more inbound arrivals are likely to contribute to the hotels' operation through a longer stay and higher expenditure for better accommodation quality and other related services. The finding implicitly reveals the important role of the inbound traveler market segment to the hotel industry.",

This finding is consistent with the assertion that education would contribute to efficiency. However, a paucity of empirical studies that use formal education as a proxy for working skill observes dissimilar results. For example, when studying technical efficiency in Malay manufacturing firms, Ismail and Sulaiman (2007) suggest that education is negatively correlated with technical efficiency in the food and beverage industry, while the education effect is not statistically significant in other industries (e.g., metal and fabricated metal products, paper products, etc.). According to a recent study of the hotel general manager profile in China, unlike their counterparts in the international market, only a small number of Chinese hotel general managers have university degrees in hospitality, while having more than nine years of hotel managerial experience on average (Li, Tse, & Xie, 2007) . Reducing the gap in efficiency differential by hiring employees with a better educational background and relatively longer working experience seems to be an effective human resource strategy in the Chinese hotel sector.",

The wage efficiency theory suggests that wages affect worker efficiency. Companies that pay higher wages are found to offset more than half of their higher wage costs through improved productivity and lower hiring and turnover costs (Holzer, 1990) . The finding of a positive influence of hotel employees' wage is consistent with Holzer (1990) study. Finally, the relationship between trade openness and efficiency (p-value= .06) presents a controversial issue. On one hand, theoretical support for a positive relationship can be found among the proponents of endogenous growth theories (Lucas, 1988) . The assumption is that high trade openness (i.e., represented by high share of imports and exports to GDP) favors the adoption of new technology and the use of a region's resources to produce aggregate output, and leads to more efficient production (Christopoulos, 2007; Edwards, 1998) . On the other hand, Rodriguez and Rodrik (2000) are skeptical of this theoretical proposition and claim that the empirical evidence to date does not provide enough convincing evidence. This relationship requires further examination.",

            "text": "The analyst is often concerned with the nature of returns to scale that would best reflect the operations of DMUs. Constant return to scale (CRS) implies a proportionate rise in outputs when inputs are increased. That is, the scale of operations does not influence the efficiency of the unit. On the other hand, variable return to scale (VRS) implies a disproportionate rise or fall in outputs when inputs are increased. That is, as a unit grows in size, its efficiency would either fall or rise. Also, in running DEA, the analyst has the model options of input minimization or output maximization. Input minimization examines the extent to which analysts can reduce inputs while maintaining the output level. Alternatively, output maximization investigates the extent to which analysts can raise outputs given the current input level. The original CCR model assumes that the DMUs are operating under constant returns to scale while the BCC model relaxes the CRS constraint and assumes variable returns to scale. Given that reducing the sunk cost is next to impossible (e.g., high initial investment) in the hotel industry (at least in the short run), an output-oriented model that identifies the relative technical efficiency with a focus on maximizing output of the analyzed DMUs is appropriate to evaluate the technical efficiency of the China hotel industry. Furthermore, Cullinane, Song, and Wang (2004) endorse using the output-oriented model for planning and examining strategic objectives. Similar to Keh, Chu, and Xu (2006) work, the assumption is VRS in view of the large dispersion in the number of employees, hotel rooms and fixed assets among the studied 31 hotel sectors. The output-oriented BCC model employed in the paper measures the technical efficiency as the ratio of weighted outputs to weighted inputs, devoid of scale efficiency effects by solving the linear programming problem (A2) depicted below. Ahn, Charnes, and Cooper (1988) prove theoretically that the results in the form of efficiency or inefficiency are robust, even though they apply different models.",

Banker et al. (1984) relax the CRS constraint and address variable returns to scale. They introduce a new controllable variable (C o ) to separate scale efficiency from technical efficiency. The related linear programming problem takes on the form Model (A2) depicted below. Unit o is efficient if the technical efficiency (TE) h o score is equal to unity, while TE b 1 indicates technical inefficiency. Empirically, a sensible approach to select between the CRS (i.e., CCR model) and VRS (i.e., BCC model) is to run both models and then compare the efficiency scores. If analysts assess the majority of DMUs as having different efficiency scores under both models, then they should employ the BCC model (i.e., the model under the VRS assumption) (Avkiran, 1999 ). In the current study, an empirical comparison of the efficiency scores generated by both models warrants the selection of the BCC model.",
