His symptoms were preceded by an episode of sore throat and cough beginning approximately 5 days before his current presentation for which he received a course of azithromycin and antitussives from an urgent care facility. Of note, the patient's spouse had had fever and a cough 1 week before the onset of his symptoms. Vitals signs at presentation revealed a temperature of 100.4\u00b0F, pulse rate of 122 per minute, blood pressure of 142/72 mm Hg, respiratory rate of 19/min, and oxygen saturation of 93% at room air. His body mass index was 39 kg/m 2 . Respiratory examination was significant for bilateral rhonchi and occasional expiratory wheezes. Pertinent laboratory abnormalities included a serum creatine kinase of 4985 units (normal \u03fd230). The remainder of his initial laboratory work was within normal limits. Rapid human immunodeficiency and influenza screens were negative. Chest x-ray at presentation revealed diffuse bilateral alveolar opacities ( Figure 1 ). Initial antibiotic coverage included vancomycin, moxifloxacin, piperacillin, and oseltamivir. Weight-based enoxaparin was used for thromboprophylaxis. His respiratory status deteriorated within a few hours of hospitalization requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation. Novel H1N1 influenza was confirmed based on a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR). He was initially managed with lung-protective mechanical ventilation and fluid restriction. Because of worsening hypoxemia, he was started on intravenous peramivir. Although a computed tomography angiogram of the thorax did not show evidence of pulmonary embolism (Figure 2) , he was fully anticoagulated. On day 8, inhaled nitric oxide (NO) therapy was started because of refractory hypoxemia (Sao 2 \u03fd80%). His condition continued to deteriorate, and he died 12 days after admission. Lung histopathology on postmortem examination revealed diffuse alveolar damage (DAD), alveolar hemorrhage, necrotizing bronchiolitis, and small thromboemboli ( Figure 3 ).",

The incidence of each was found to be higher with advancing age. 7 Recent experience with novel H1N1 influenza has estimated that 6% of patients who have clinical influenza will require hospitalization and 12% of those will develop respiratory failure. 8 Reports of ARDS occurring in association with novel 2009 H1N1 influenza identified a younger median patient age than has historically been associated with ARDS with other respiratory infections, including seasonal influenza. 9 For reasons that remain unclear, the incidence of H1N1-related ALI seems to be highest in patients who are obese or pregnant. 10 -12 ",

For example, exacerbation of asthma, congestive heart failure, and acute myocardial infarction have all been associated with acute influenza infection. 18 For these reasons, the threshold for suspecting influenza should be low in the setting of an epidemic. Rapid influenza screening based on lateral flow immunodiagnostic testing (\"rapid flu test\") has been reported to have a wide range of sensitivity between 10% and 70% for the 2009 H1N1 strain, limiting the utility of this test. 19, 20 Reported sensitivity and specificity for reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) approaches 100%. 21 However, because of the long turnaround times for RT-PCR results, treatment must be initiated based on clinical suspicion only. For intubated patients, initial testing for pandemic H1N1 infection should consist of paired nasopharyngeal and tracheal aspirate specimens for RT-PCR. 17 In severe H1N1 influenza, hematologic and biochemical testing may reveal leukopenia and increases of serum lactate dehydrogenase and creatine kinase.

The first by Zapol et al 55 did not demonstrate survival benefit in a cohort of patients with various causes of acute respiratory failure. More recently, Peek et al 56 reported the results of the United Kingdom National Health Services Trial (CESAR trial). This study randomized 180 adults with severe ARDS to receive either conventional mechanical ventilation in a community hospital or ECMO in a tertiary referral center. An intent-to-treat analysis demonstrated better clinical outcomes in the group referred for ECMO. Among patients referred for ECMO, who actually received ECMO, mortality was only 37%.

            "text": "The rationale for the use of glucocorticoids in ARDS is founded on the fact that they have broad antiinflammatory and antifibrotic effects. A prospective randomized crossover trial of 91 patients with severe, early ARDS suggested that methylprednisolone infusion (1 mg/kg/d) reduced lung injury scores, multiple organ dysfunction syndrome scores, duration of mechanical ventilation, and ICU mortality. 57 Furthermore, treated patients had a lower rate of secondary bacterial infections. Unfortunately, this study was limited by its crossover design. Use of steroids as a rescue therapy late in the course of ARDS was investigated in 180 patients in another randomized controlled trial called the Late Steroid Rescue Study. Steroids did not show any survival benefit when treatment was initiated 7 or more days after the onset of ARDS. 58 Although observational studies of patients with ALI caused by H1N1 have reported good clinical outcomes with a combination of oseltamivir with methylprednisolone, controlled data are lacking. 2 On the basis of the failure of steroids to benefit patients with ARDS caused by other viral etiologies, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome, H5N1, Hantavirus, and respiratory syncytial virus, the above data fail to produce a convincing argument for their use in H1N1-associated ARDS. 59 In summary, increased clinical suspicion of influenza, early initiation of appropriate antimicrobial therapy, and knowledge of optimal ICU support modalities are necessary skill sets for all physicians who care for patients with potential H1N1-associated ALI/ARDS.",
