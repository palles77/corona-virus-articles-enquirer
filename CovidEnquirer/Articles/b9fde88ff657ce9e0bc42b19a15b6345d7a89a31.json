Human milk protects against specific pathogens (viruses, bacteria, and parasites) as well as separate clinical illnesses (eg, necrotizing enterocolitis, bacteremia, meningitis, respiratory tract illness, diarrheal disease, and otitis media) [2] . The benefits of breast milk make it one of the most important factors in protecting infants against the morbidity and mortality of infectious diseases [2 -8] . Numerous factors within human breast milk act in a complementary fashion to protect against infection. They contribute to the infant's immune protection through various mechanisms, including improved growth of nonpathogenic flora, decreased colonization with enteropathogens, enhanced development of the respiratory and intestinal mucosal barriers, specific factors against individual organisms (eg, secretory IgA [sIgA]), functioning immune cells (eg, neutrophils, macrophages, T and B lymphocytes), decreased inflammatory reaction, and immunomodulation [2,9 -11] .",

Factors to prove infection transmission through breast milk 1. Identify the infectious agent in the colostrum or breast milk using culture, nucleic-acid detection, antigen detection, or other methods. 2. Postulate a reasonable mechanism of infection given the current knowledge about the organism and the host's response to it, including timing and pathophysiology. 3. Characterize the clinical manifestations of the illness in the mother and the infant. 4. Demonstrate the occurrence of infection in the mother and the infant by culture, nucleic-acid identification, or immunologic response. 5. Confirm that the organisms identified in the mother and infant are identical based on serotype, sensitivity pattern, nucleic-acid sequence, and other factors. 6. Document that the risk for infection is greater in breast-fed infants than in formula-fed infants. 7. Characterize a dose -response relationship between the quantity of organisms in the breast milk as well as the amount of breast milk ingested and the frequency of transmission or the severity of the infection in the infant. 8. Exclude other possible mechanisms of transmission. 9 . Prove the transmission through breast milk by reproducing the process in animal or human studies.",

Perinatal infections commonly occur from exposure to blood or body fluids and contact with pathogens from the maternal genitourinary and gastrointestinal tracts. The likelihood that the exposed infant will be infected varies significantly with the specific organism and various host factors (eg, passively acquired antibody levels in the infant). Postnatally acquired infections are transmitted most commonly through contact with caregivers (eg, parents, relatives, visitors, health care providers), the environment (eg, medical equipment, other fomites), or breast milk, depending on the organism [12] . The timing of the infection in the mother and the infant is often crucial to documenting the mechanism of transmission. In most infectious situations, the exposure of the infant and mother to child transmission has occurred before the illness is diagnosed in the mother (eg, measles, Coxsackievirus infection) and frequently occurs before the mother becomes ill (eg, chickenpox, hepatitis). Proscribing breastfeeding at that point may not prevent infection in the infant and will diminish significantly the effect of breast milk to limit or modify the illness in the infant. The timing of the infection in the mother can influence significantly the risks to the infant (eg, primary HIV or CMV infection before pregnancy, during pregnancy, or postnatally, ie, during lactation).",

Many maternal illnesses associated with fever do not require separation of the mother and infant (eg, engorgement of the breasts, atelectasis, nonsuppurative phlebitis, or urinary tract infection) or additional precautions to protect the infant. Another important consideration relative to breast milk and infection is medications in breast milk. A thorough review of antimicrobial agents and breast milk is outside the scope of this article. Most antimicrobial agents used to treat infection can be used in infants and children.

Standard precautions emphasize careful handwashing with every patient contact and the use of appropriate barriers when contamination with body fluids is more likely (eg, gloves, masks, glasses). Breast milk is not considered a potentially infectious body fluid under these guidelines. Careful handwashing before and after breastfeeding is always appropriate, as are selected barriers (mask, gown or clothes, bandages) to prevent infant contact with other body fluids of the mother with a specific infection.

Because infants cannot wear such devices, infants of mothers with these infections should be separated temporarily from the mother during the infectious period, regardless of the mode of feeding.

Botulism is caused by the neurotoxin produced by Clostridium botulinum. Arnon and colleagues [18] reviewed 50 patients hospitalized for botulism in California and the breast-fed infants were older at diagnosis than formulafed infants, and had milder disease. In cases of sudden infant death syndrome associated with botulism, no infants were breast-fed within 10 weeks of death. An association with the introduction of solid foods has been suggested. Honey and corn syrup often are implicated because they may contain C botulinum spores. The apparent immunologic benefit of breast milk may be caused by more acidic stools (pH 5.1 -5.4) and increased Bifidobacterium species in the stools of breast-fed infants, limiting the presence of C botulinum or spores. Botulinum toxin production declines with lower pH. No evidence suggests that the organism or the toxin is transmitted through breast milk. Chlamydia infection may be the most frequent sexually transmitted disease in the United States. Perinatal infection in the infant produces conjunctivitis and pneumonitis and is caused primarily by colonization of the infant when passing through the birth canal.

Forty to ninety percent of infants in the nursery at 5 days of age will be colonized with Staphylococcus aureus [22] . Staphylococcus aureus caused nursery outbreaks in the past. Postnatal contact with mothers, health care workers, and contaminated, unpasteurized, banked breast milk were the identified sources of infection [23] . Staphylococcus aureus is a common cause of mastitis in the mother. There is one reported case of staphylococcal scalded skin syndrome in an infant whose mother had a skin lesion caused by staphylococcus on her areola [24] . No attempt to identify the toxin or the organism in the breast milk was made. This case reinforces close, continued observation of the infant (breast-or formula-fed) when there is a documented maternal infection. In a case of toxic shock syndrome in a mother at 22 hours postpartum, the breast-fed infant remained well through 60 days of age. Staphylococcal enterotoxin F (SEF) was identified in breast milk on days 5, 8, and 11, but Staphylococcus aureus was isolated only from the mother's vagina and not the breast milk [25] . SEF is inactivated by pepsin at pH 4.5. It is probably inactivated in the stomach, presenting no risk to the infant. Methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) is more frequent than in the past. Skin and nares are the predominant sites of colonization. No treatment regimen to eradicate colonization has proved highly successful. Current regimens include oral systemic therapy with one or two sensitive antibiotics, topical antibiotics twice daily to the nares, and intermittent bathing with hexachlorophene (pHisoHex) or a similar agent. In the face of maternal Staphylococcus aureus infection, use of expressed breast milk is appropriate during a temporary 24-hour separation of mother and infant at the initiation of maternal antimicrobial therapy.",

It is more likely that transmission occurs through contact rather than the organism passing in the breast milk. A mother or infant colonized or infected with GBS should be managed with standard precautions during hospitalization. Routine culturing of the breast or breast milk and therapy to eradicate colonization have not proved useful. GBS has not been associated with outbreaks in the nursery.

Congenital TB is extremely rare, with fewer than 300 reported cases in the literature. TB mastitis is also rare. Starke [33] has summarized the evaluation and treatment of a pregnant woman with a positive tuberculin skin test. The primary concern is the postnatal exposure of the infant through droplets or droplet nuclei by the mother or another household member with active pulmonary TB. Complete evaluation of the suspected person to determine their TB status (active disease with or without positive cultures and smears) and testing of all household contacts are the first steps. Breast-fed and formula-fed infants are equally at risk from respiratory transmission. Separation of the infant from any case of active pulmonary TB is appropriate. Once adequate therapy in the mother has begun and the mother is determined to not be infectious, the infant and mother may have contact. Observation of the mother and infant should continue through the completion of treatment for the mother. Transmission of TB in breast milk has never been documented in the absence of TB mastitis. Expressed breast milk can be given safely to the infant because antituberculous medications can be used in infants. The only contraindication to using breast milk is in the mother who has TB mastitis. Prophylactic isoniazid (Nydrazid, Laniazid) therapy for the infant prevents TB infection in infants. Once both the mother and infant are being treated and closely observed, they can be in contact [34] .",

Perinatal infection occurs through direct contact or body fluid contact at delivery, but is associated rarely with clinical illness in full-term infants. Postnatal infection occurs through breastfeeding or contact with infected body fluids, most frequently during play with other infants, especially in day-care settings. Infection through breast milk rarely results in significant disease in full-term infants. The normal acquisition of transplacental maternal antibodies against CMV protects full-term infants of CMV-positive mothers. Rarely, primary CMV infection occurs in the mother around delivery or during lactation, which increases the risk for illness in the infant because of a lack of anti-CMV antibodies available to the infant. CMV is identifiable in breast milk at various rates in CMV-positive mothers, probably because of variation in the testing and sampling techniques and the intermittent nature of reactivation and excretion of the virus. Postnatal exposure of susceptible infants (ie, infants without passively acquired maternal antibodies against CMV: premature infants, infants of CMV-seronegative mothers, and immunodeficient infants) can lead to severe disease (hepatitis, pneumonitis) [36, 37] .",

Children infected between 1 and 5 years of age develop chronic HBV infection about 30% of the time. The sequelae of chronic HBV infection include chronic active infection, chronic persistent hepatitis, cirrhosis, and hepatocellular carcinoma. Transmission is primarily through blood or body fluids. Transmission of HBV occurs with breast milk and hepatitis B surface antigen has been demonstrated in breast milk. There is no difference in serocon- version rates for formula-fed and breast-fed infants [42, 43] . The appropriate administration of hepatitis B immunoglobulin (HBIg) and HBV vaccine (Recombivax HB, Engerix-B) at birth for infants born to hepatitis B surface antigenpositive mothers prevents transmission in more than 95% of cases, regardless of the mode of feeding [44] . Breastfeeding can continue along with the administration of HBIg and HBV vaccine. Hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection leads to chronic infection in 70% to 85% of cases, regardless of the timing of infection, and leads to the same potential sequelae as does HBV. Transmission occurs through blood and blood products, intravenous drug use, probably body fluids contaminated with blood, and sexual transmission when there are other STDs or a high viral load in blood or body fluids. Congenital and intrapartum transmission occurs. Factors that seem to increase risk for such transmission include high maternal viral load, maternal coinfection with HIV, and prolonged rupture of membranes with vaginal delivery [45 -53] . The frequency and the easy diagnosis of HCV infection in infants still need to be worked out. Transmission of HCV infection through breast milk has not been proved, and transmission rates seem similar in formula-fed and breast-fed infants. Published studies have not controlled for variables such as maternal HCV-RNA serum viral loads, amount of virolactia, exclusive or partial breastfeeding versus exclusive formula feeding, and duration of breastfeeding [45 -47,51 -54] . Additional controlled trials are needed to delineate the importance of different factors contributing to or limiting transmission from mother to child. Current Centers for Disease Control and Prevention guidelines do not consider maternal HCV infection a contraindication to breastfeeding, although they suggest that cracked or bleeding nipples may increase risk for transmission [55] . Regardless of the etiologic cause of maternal hepatitis (A, B, or C), the theoretic risks for transmission through breast milk should be discussed balanced with the benefits of breast milk, so the mother and parents can make an informed decision concerning infant feeding.",

These interventions need to be tested for feasibility, cultural acceptability, preservation of nutritional benefit, and efficacy where they may have the greatest effect. Avoidance of breastfeeding by HIV-positive mothers should continue in countries where an alternative source of nutrition can be provided easily. The World Health Organization, United Nations International Children's Fund, and the Joint United Nations Programme on HIV/AIDS recommend counseling, education, and support for HIV-infected mothers in resource-poor settings where breastfeeding is the norm, and offer vital nutritional and infection-protective effects so they can make an educated decision concerning infant feeding.

Early life infection carries the greatest risk for adult T-cell leukemia [62] . HTLV-I occurs endemically in limited areas worldwide, including southwest Japan, the Caribbean, South America, and sub-Saharan Africa [65, 66] . Transmission is through sexual contact, blood and blood products, and breast milk. Transmission occurs more frequently in breast-fed infants than formula-fed infants [67 -72] . A longer duration of breastfeeding correlates with greater risk for HTLV-I transmission to the infant [72 -74] . Transmission also has been associated with higher maternal provirus levels and a higher HTLV-I antibody titer [75, 76] . Complete avoidance of breastfeeding is an effective intervention to prevent mother-to-child transmission [77] . The median time of transmission was estimated at 11 to 12 months of age [78] . In areas of low prevalence, the likelihood of a false positive HTLV-I test is high; therefore repeat testing often is indicated. In a pregnant woman, antibody titer testing and proviral load quantification are appropriate to estimate the risk for transmission to the infant. The risk for mother-to-child transmission should be discussed with the mother and parents. When formula is available readily and culturally acceptable, then avoiding breast milk or recommending early weaning (before or at 6 months of age) is reasonable to decrease the risk for HTLV-I transmission to the infant. Providing the infant with frozen/thawed breast milk may be an acceptable alternative in certain situations, because freezing decreases the amount of viable virus in breast milk for other viruses (eg, CMV, HIV1).",

Lyme disease is characterized by multi-organ system involvement (skin, heart, joints, and nervous system) and can occur in three stages (early localized, early disseminated, and late disease). The existence, diagnosis, and treatment of chronic Lyme disease remain highly controversial. B burgdorferi is primarily arthropod-borne and -transmitted. It is transmitted prenatally uncommonly, even in endemic areas [93] , but B burgdorferi as the cause of illness in the fetus or congenital abnormalities is debated [94 -96] . B burgdorferi DNA has been reported in breast milk, but there is no evidence for illness in the infant or transmission of the spirochete to the infant through breast milk [97] . In spite of the paucity of data, caution may be warranted. With a confirmed diagnosis of acute Lyme disease in the mother, it is appropriate to discuss the available information with the mother or parents and to recommend temporarily avoiding breastfeeding and breast milk for 24 to 48 hours after beginning maternal antibiotic therapy (amoxicillin [Amoxil, Trimox, and others], penicillin [numerous trade names], or ceftriaxone [Rocephin]). Candida organisms can cause significant late disease in hospitalized neonates and readily colonize most infants without producing significant illness. Mucocutaneous candidal disease is the most common form of illness in infants, causing thrush and candidal diaper rash. Invasive candidal infection occurs primarily in individuals with other illnesses, altered immunity, or skin and mucosal barriers, and after use of broad-spectrum antibiotics. Late-postnatal infection is most common, intrauterine-ascending infection is rare, and there is no evidence for a syndrome of congenital Candida infection. Transmission occurs in healthy individuals through direct contact or contact with vaginal or oral secretions. The mother and infant serve as a ready source of Candida organisms to recolonize each other, and this is particularly true during breastfeeding. Thrush or diaper candidiasis in the infant and mastitis or vulvovaginitis in the mother should prompt simultaneous treatment of the mother and infant, even when illness or infection is not obvious in the second individual. Many topical and systemic antifungal agents are recommended in different regimens to treat and eradicate Candida spp in the breastfeeding mother -infant dyad. Breastfeeding or expressed breast milk is appropriate during treatment, although occasionally maternal mastitis can be so painful that temporary cessation of breastfeeding is necessary for comfort. Management of candidal mastitis requires close adherence to the recommended therapy, careful follow-up, and effective lactation support.",

Clinicians should refer to the published recommendations for treatment and prophylaxis in infants, children, and breastfeeding mothers [99] . The recommendations propose the use of amoxicillin, doxycycline (Vibramycin, Periostat and others), ciprofloxacin (Cipro), and several other agents for 60 days. Little information is available on the prolonged use of doxycycline or ciprofloxacin and their possible effect on infant's teeth and cartilage growth, respectively. Short courses of doxycycline or ciprofloxacin in breastfeeding mothers are acceptable without concern for the infant [100] . Depending on the sensitivity testing of the isolated anthrax strain, amoxicillin or another drug could be used to complete a course of therapy or prophylaxis in a breastfeeding mother or her infant. Smallpox (variola virus) is highly contagious because of the ease of person-toperson spread by way of droplets, aerosolization from the oropharynx, or direct contact with skin lesions. It also carries a high morbidity and mortality in susceptible populations. For these reasons, it is a potential agent in biological terrorism. The exposure risk of a terrorist act leading to widespread aerosolization, contamination of a closed space, or contamination of the clothes of adults would be the same for breast-fed and formula-fed infants. The high transmission risk from household contact necessitates the separation of any infant from a mother with smallpox. Breast milk should be avoided during the mother's rash because of the possibility of contamination of the milk from the extensive lesions, even though there is no evidence of transmission of the virus to the infant through breast milk.",

Children over 1 year of age can be vaccinated safely if there is a probable smallpox exposure. The Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices recommends not vaccinating pregnant or breastfeeding women or children less than 18 years old in pre-event smallpox vaccination programs [101] . One case of tertiary contact vaccinia in a breastfeeding infant was reported in 2004. The vaccinee in the household developed an appropriate reaction at the inoculation site and subsequently his wife developed vesicles on both areolae (secondary contact vaccinia). The breastfeeding infant later developed lesions on her philtrum, cheek, and tongue. The mother and infant were observed closely and remained well. Culture and polymerase chain reaction (PCR) testing identified vaccinia virus in the mother and infant's lesions, but the breast milk was not tested [102] . Secondary contact vaccinia from smallpox vaccine is rare, estimated to occur at a rate of 5 to 7 cases per 100,000 vaccinees [103] . Breast-fed and formula-fed infants have the same risk for transmission from close contact with a vaccinee (eg, household contact, close physical contact, or sleeping in the same bed). If the mother has secondary contact vaccinia but her breasts are without lesions, expressed breast milk can be given safely to the infant with the continuation of all other appropriate household precautions after smallpox vaccination.",

Transmission occurs through mosquito bite, with mosquitoes of the genus Culex being the primary vectors. Transmission also has been reported during pregnancy [114, 115] , through organ transplant [116] , through percutaneous exposure in laboratory workers [117] , and through blood and blood product transfusion [118] . One case of possible WNV transmission through breastfeeding has been reported [119] . The mother was infected by a blood transfusion after delivery, became sick 8 days later, and was being hospitalized with a meningoencephalitis-like illness. The infant was breast-fed from birth through the second day of the mother's hospitalization. Samples of the mother's cerebrospinal fluid and breast milk from days 16 and 24 after delivery tested positive for WNV-specific IgM. The breast milk from day 16 was also positive for WNV-RNA on PCR testing. Live WNV was not cultured from the breast milk. The infant remained well. Although this may constitute a case of transmission of WNV through breast milk, the absence of illness in this infant (and most infants/children), the transient nature of maternal viremia with WNV, and the rarity of such a transmission event suggest that there is no reason to avoid breastfeeding or breast milk when a mother is infected with WNV.",
