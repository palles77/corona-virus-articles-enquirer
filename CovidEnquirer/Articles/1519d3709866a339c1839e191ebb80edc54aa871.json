Praziquantel is also an anthelmintic that works by causing strong contractions within the parasite that causes paralysis and eventual dislodgment [4, 5] . The purpose of the study was to determine if combining the two different mechanisms would be more effective than single agent therapy. It has also been noted in the past that praziquantel increases the serum concentration of the active metabolite of albendazole [2] . The side effects listed by the study were described as seizures, headache, pregnancy, drug-induced hepatitis, and \"other\" which included spontaneous abortion, urinary tract infection, motor vehicle accident, dizziness, fever, vomiting, and intracranial hypertension. While all of the side effect groups except for the drug-induced hepatitis were more common in the increased dose of albendazole or the combination therapy than in the standard albendazole therapy, the study found that the increased prevalence of adverse effects was not statistically significant. Currently, there is not a listed interaction between albendazole and praziquantel with the active ingredients of birth control.",

In a meta-analysis including 27 studies comparing Dihydroartemisinin-piperaquine (DHA-P) and Artemisinin-based Combination Therapy (ACT) it was found that the DHA-P patients experience less side effects such as palpitations, sleeplessness, dizziness, vomiting, or nausea. However, there was low quality evidence indicating that DHA-P could have an association with higher frequency of QTc interval prolongation [11M]. Fexinidazole is a 5-nitroimidazole that may be useful in the treatment of both stages of human African Trypanosomiasis, or sleeping sickness, spread through the bite of the tsetse fly carrying either Trypanosoma brucei gambiense or Trypanosoma brucei rhodesiense [12C]. A study was completed in order to determine tolerability of a variety of different dosages and formulations. A total of 154 healthy males were used in the studies [12C,8S]. Headache was the most commonly reported adverse event followed by vomiting, nausea, and diarrhea. Other, less common adverse events include: gastro-esophageal reflux disease, abdominal pain, dizziness, flushing, increased transaminases, somnolence, regurgitation, fever, palpitations, sweating, insomnia, paresthesia, myalgia, keratitis, chest pain, dysuria, asthenia, anxiety, and dyspepsia.

During a randomized trial testing the efficacy of posaconazole for the treatment of chronic Chaga's disease involving 26 patients in each study arm, the author's noted mucosal dryness in approximately 12% of the patients taking a high dose of posaconazole and 8% in patients taking a low dose [22C]. The authors found posaconazole to be ineffective in the treatment of Chaga's disease, but could potentially be used as a suppressive agent used as adjunct therapy for anti-trypanosomal treatment.",

            "text": "Primaquine is an aminoquinoline used in the treatment of Plasmodium falciparum and P. vivax malaria and the prevention of relapse of P. vivax malaria [23,24C] . Its treatment works by eradicating the infection present in tissue; it prevents relapse by eliminating the parasite present in the blood. P. vivax is more resistant to other treatments than P. falciparum which is due to a variety of reasons including: P. vivax has a dormant liver stage that is difficult to kill, the earlier appearance of gametocytes during infection, and the tolerance of its sporogonic cycle to low temperatures [8S]. Currently, there are no other treatments other than primaquine that is effective in killing P. vivax while it is in its dormant stage. While this makes primaquine the best option for the treatment of P. vivax, it is not used often because of the risk of acute hemolytic anemia in patients that have glucose-6phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) deficiency. A review article compiled information from four different studies dating from the late 1960s to 2000 in the mass distribution of primaquine in populations that have high prevalence of G6PD deficiency [25R]. Overall, it was found that primaquine was relatively well tolerated especially when taken with food. Around 2-4% of patients experienced side effects such as headache, epigastric pain, nausea/ vomiting, dizziness, anorexia, chromaturia, and black urine (a possible symptom of hemolytic anemia). The study completed in Korea found that 0.1% of the treated population experienced black urine despite a higher prevalence of G6PD deficiency. The studies conducted in Azerbaijan and Afghanistan both reported <1% of patients that experienced changes in urine color. Many of the patients in Azerbaijan and Afghanistan have the Mediterranean variant of G6PD which is commonly associated with severe hemolytic reactions after receiving primaquine. The study conducted in Tajikistan did not report specific adverse effects, but stated that there were very few. Combined, the four studies treated millions of people and reported only a few cases of serious adverse effects, none of which resulted in hospitalization or death. QUINACRINE (RS)-N 0 -(6-Chloro-2-methoxy-acridin-9-yl)-N,Ndiethylpentane-1,4-diamine Prions are infectious proteinaceous particles that are thought to cause Creutzfeld-Jakob disease which is a transmissible spongiform encephalopathy [8S]. Quinacrine is an antiprotozoal drug that is also known for having inhibitory effects on prion formation. One study looked at this inhibitory effect on the prions for the treatment of Creutzfeld-Jakob disease. This study enrolled 54 patients and randomized them 1:1 comparing quinacrine vs placebo. The study found that quinacrine does not improve survival for patients with Creutzfeld-Jacob disease. Within the first two months, there was one case of severe gastrointestinal distress in a patient receiving quinacrine. Elevated liver function tests and gastrointestinal distress were the most commonly reported adverse events by patients in the quinacrine group after the initial two months of treatment [26C].",

While these results are positive, more studies would need to be considered before removing hemolysis as a potential threat in G6PD deficient patients on tafenoquine. Adverse events in the tafenoquine plus chloroquine groups (n\u00bc55) that differed from the chloroquine alone group (n\u00bc56) include headache (25% vs 37%), chills (29% vs 37%), pyrexia (33% vs 39%), nausea (13% vs 6%), asthenia (9% vs 0%), and dizziness (13% vs 9%). In the case of asthenia, it is thought that this reaction may not have been drug related. The investigators were not able to make an association with QTc prolongation and tafenoquine; however, they were defining QTc prolongation as more than 500 ms. While these adverse effects may be attributable to the use of the drug, some of them are also signs of the disease state being treated since malarial infections can cause headache, fever, as well as vomiting [27S, 8S].",

Trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole was administered via weight-based dosing along with doxycycline 100 mg for twenty weeks in five locations in northeast Thailand [35C]. P. aeruginosa paronychia has been correlated with frequent placement of the hands in water in these countries, where discoloration results from diffusion of pyocyanin into the nail bed, and therefore the interaction between trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole in combination with doxycycline is not likely [8S].

It is used to treat Plasmodium falciparum malaria and is considered first-line therapy [8s] . It is believed to work by creating free radicals from cleaving portions of the endoperoxide bridge and may also have other damaging effects on cATP and protein folding 36 (lexicomp). Artesunate is combined with other antimalarial drugs to avoid resistance from developing and is referred to as ACT (Artmisinin-based combination therapy).

Malarial infections caused by P. falciparum and P. vivax may be prevented with the prophylactic use of mefloquine hydrochloride. Mefloquine hydrochloride has been linked to neurological side effects (dizziness, tinnitus, and balance problems) and psychiatric side effects (hallucinations, having the feeling of anxiousness, depression, or mistrustfulness). A five year study conducted in Denmark examined the psychiatric adverse events associated with the use of mefloquine [38R] . Patients that reported possible psychiatric side effects were assessed with SCL-90-R tool. Using the SCL-90-R, the study found clinical significance for anxiety, phobic anxiety, and depression for patients receiving mefloquine. The study found that women experienced hallucinations more often than men. The study also found that neurological side effects can become long term and sometimes even permanent side effects. As a result, the FDA has issued a black box warning about the neurological and psychiatric side effects. If a patient develops neurological or psychiatric symptoms while taking mefloquine for the prevention of malaria, the patient should discuss his symptoms with his physician and the physician should consider discontinuing the use of mefloquine and using an alternative drug [39S,40] . The study of Stienlauf et al. was designed to examine the interactions between chronic medications used in the treatment of pre-existing disease states and medications used for prophylaxis in patients traveling to developing countries. The study was a retrospective cohort that evaluated mefloquine, primaquine, doxycycline, atovaquone/proguanil, fluoroquinolone antibiotics, rifaximin, azithromycin, and acetazolamide to determine if there were interactions with chronic medications. This was a large study of over 16 000 individuals. Fluoroquinolones, as well as azithromycin, were shown to most commonly have drug-drug interactions with chronic medications. About 45% of study subjects were given a preventative medication that interacted with at least one of their chronic medications. Interactions identified in about 20% of the individuals were most commonly attributed to use of acetazolamide, primaquine and mefloquine. Also of note was the presence of drug allergies in patients taking acetazolamide where 8.1% of those in the study experienced a drug allergy. Further studies are needed to verify the results, but clinicians should be aware of such interactions between medicine used for travel with chronic conditions and/or maintenance medications [41r].",
