Uninfected glial cells remained negative for H-2 class I and class II surface antigens. We have previously shown that conditioned media from infected glial cell cultures (supernatants) contain a factor unrelated to infectious virus and capable of inducing H-2 class I antigens on uninfected glial cells. The synthesis of this factor appears to be dependent on production of infectious virus since the H-2 inducing activity could not be detected 3 days following the addition of neutralizing antibodies to the cultures. This suggests that H-2 inducing activity contains an unstable component, the synthesis of which is dependent on continual virus production. Persistent MHV infection and H-2 class I antigen expression may play a role in MHV-induced demyelination.",

In contrast, uninfected glial cells do not contain detectable levels of these antigens. Previously we have shown that H-2 induction was due to a soluble factor(s) synthesized in the infected glial cultures, probably by astrocytes (Suzumura et al., 1986 (Suzumura et al., , 1988 . The activity of the factor was not dependent on infectious virus since infected glial cell supernatants, treated with ultraviolet (UV) light, which inactivates infectious virus, could induce H-2 class I surface antigens when added to uninfected glial cells. This factor was also shown not to be interferon, another factor known to induce H-2, class I antigens on glial cells (Wong et al., 1984; Suzumura et al., 1988) , or virus particles (Suzumura et al., 1988) .

Two lines of evidence suggest that this induction is not mediated by virus. First, virus particles can be removed from infected-cell supernatants by centrifugation (Suzumura et al., 1988) without affecting the induction of H-2 antigens. Second, treatment of supernatants from infected cells with neutralizing antiviral antiserum does not alter the ability of those supernatants to induce H-2 antigens on uninfected cells (Suzumura et al., 1988) . These observations suggest that the factor in infected-cell supernatants responsible for the induction does not require infectious virus. However, the addition of neutralizing anti-viral antiserum to infected glial cells does prevent the production of a supernatant capable of inducing H-2 antigens on infected cells, suggesting that the synthesis of an active H-2 inducing factor is dependent on the concomitant production of infectious virus. It is possible that the soluble H-2 inducing factor is induced in astrocytes by active viral replication but that the factor is not very stable and therefore continual production of the factor depends on continual viral replication.",
