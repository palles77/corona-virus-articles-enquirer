Despite many studies predicting the likelihood of bacteremia in CAP patients, those results have been rarely implemented in clinical practice, and use of blood culture in CAP is still increasing. This study evaluated impact of implementing a previously derived and validated bacteremia prediction rule. Methods: In this registry-based before and after study, we used piecewise regression analysis to compare the blood culture rate before and after implementation of the prediction rule. We also compared 30-day mortality, emergency department (ED) length of stay, time-interval to initial antibiotics after ED arrival, and any changes to the antibiotics regimen as results of the blood cultures. In subgroup analysis, we compared two groups (with or without the use of the prediction rule) after implementation period, using propensity score matching. Results: Following the implementation, the blood culture rate declined from 85.5% to 78.1% (P = 0.003) without significant changes in 30-day mortality and antibiotics regimen. The interval to initial antibiotics (231 min vs. 221 min, P = 0.362) and length of stay (1019 min vs. 954 min, P = 0.354) were not significantly changed. In subgroup analysis, the group that use the prediction rule showed 25 min faster antibiotics initiation (P = 0.002) and 48 min shorter length of stay (P = 0.007) than the group that did not use the rule. Conclusion: Implementation of the bacteremia prediction rule in CAP patients reduced the blood culture rate without affecting the 30-day mortality and antibiotics regimen.",

However, in a recent study, multidrug resistance pathogens were uncommon in CAP patients, which accounted for 1.9% [24] . According to our bacteremia score system, blood cultures could be omitted in patients in the low-risk group, of which the true bacteremia rate was b3% [10] . In this study, the true bacteremia in the low-risk group was 2.3% (51/2676) and antibiotics step up due to multidrug resistance organisms isolated from blood cultures was 0.5% (13/2676).

According to the sepsis guideline, initial antibiotics should be administered within 1 h after recognition of sepsis [25] . For patients with severe initial presentation, ED physicians may urge the initiation of IV antibiotics and blood cultures without adherence to the bacteremia score. Calculation of the bacteremia score takes N1.5 h because the scoring system includes albumin and C-reactive protein results. This fact may be why the bacteremia score adherence group had mild presentations and lower Pneumonia Severity Index (PSI) scores (Supplementary Table 1 ). For patients with mild symptoms and stable initial vital signs, ED physicians may wait for the laboratory tests before the initiation of IV antibiotics. Those patients may be stratified into the low-risk group for bacteremia and could have more chances to avoid unnecessary blood cultures of low yield. Therefore, by the time a decision had to be made regarding initiating IV antibiotics without blood culture, N90 min had already passed, and the time-saving effect of omitting blood cultures may have been diminished.",

Missing not at random (MNAR) which occupied a small fraction (116/4130; 2.8%) but not included in analysis, may have created a bias. Also there could be many confounders influencing the results besides the intervention. Second, the baseline characteristics of the two groups before and after intervention were significantly different. The Middle East Respiratory Syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) outbreak in 2015 may have increased the sensitivity of the ED visit population to respiratory symptoms, which may be one of the reasons accounting for the difference [26] . Third, the adherence rate for the bacteremia score was 36.5% which may be too low to expect clinical and statistical significance. Generally, evidence-based changes in the clinical practice of physicians take a substantial amount of time and effort [27, 28] . In addition to those periods of adaptation, the time needed for calculation of the score make a decrease of adherence inevitable in severe patients for whom blood cultures and IV antibiotics were urgent. Additionally, the calculation of the score with multiplication and addition is difficult and the use of Excel file could be another cumbersome step to emergency physicians in a crowded ED. Finally the target population only included patients with CAP and this would limit the broad application of the Table 4 Blood culture results with contamination and antibiotics regimen changes before and after implementation of bacteremia prediction model. \u204e Adjusted by variables with statistical significance (P value b 0.1): age, sex, history of diabetes mellitus, hypertension, heart failure, cerebrovascular disease, renal disease, liver disease, and known neoplasm, systolic blood pressure, respiratory rate, pulse rate, body temperature, white blood cell count, hematocrit, platelet count, glucose, albumin, BUN, PSI, admission rate. a The numbers of patients with any missing variables used in analysis was 116 and those patients were not included in analyses.",
