            "text": "It has been proposed that cholesterol in host cell membranes plays a pivotal role for cell entry of HIV. However, it remains largely unknown why virions prefer cholesterol-rich heterogeneous membranes to uniformly fluid membranes for membrane fusion. Using giant plasma membrane vesicles containing cholesterol-rich ordered and cholesterol-poor fluid lipid domains, we demonstrate that the HIV receptor CD4 is substantially sequestered into ordered domains, whereas the co-receptor CCR5 localizes preferentially at ordered/disordered domain boundaries. We also show that HIV does not fuse from within ordered regions of the plasma membrane but rather at their boundaries. Ordered/disordered lipid domain coexistence is not required for HIV attachment but is a prerequisite for successful fusion. We propose that HIV virions sense and exploit membrane discontinuities to gain entry into cells. This study provides surprising answers to the long-standing question about the roles of cholesterol and ordered lipid domains in cell entry of HIV and perhaps other enveloped viruses.",

Accumulating evidence indicates that membrane domain organization plays a vital role in cell signaling and adaptive immune responses to combat infections by many pathogens (3) (4) (5) . For example, HIV has evolved to exploit organized membrane domains to gain entry into host cells (6) (7) (8) (9) . It is well established that recognition and attachment of HIV to host cells are mediated by the binding of the viral envelope glycoprotein gp120 to the cell-surface receptor CD4 and a co-receptor CCR5 or CXCR4 (10, 11) . After attachment, membrane fusion mediated by subunit gp41 of the envelope glycoprotein leads to cell entry. Because CD4 has been found to associate with detergent-resistant fractions of the cell membrane, it has been assumed that cholesterol-and sphingomyelin-rich rafts are platforms for HIV entry (12, 13) . However, because lipids in cholesterolrich regions are more tightly packed and more ordered than those in the surrounding membrane, these sites may seem energetically unfavorable for membrane fusion, thereby raising doubts about the involvement of ordered lipid regions in the fusion step of HIV entry.",

In a first step toward solving this problem, we showed recently that model membranes with coexisting microscopic ordered and fluid lipid domains were useful in proving that the fusion peptide of gp41 interacts preferentially with ordered/disordered lipid domain boundaries and that these boundaries are also the preferred sites for fusion peptide-mediated membrane fusion (16) . However, these discoveries raised the important question of whether the results obtained in this highly artificial model system could be translated to biological membranes that contain the HIV receptor and co-receptor and to virus particles bearing the full, trimeric, gp120/gp41 complex, that is, whether membrane domain boundaries would still be the preferred sites for virus attachment and/or membrane fusion at the plasma membranes of appropriate target cells. Therefore, we developed a new approach to measuring binding and fusion of HIV particles with plasma membranes to assess the role of membrane heterogeneity in these processes.",

GPMVs show temperaturedependent, micrometer-scale liquid-ordered/liquid-disordered (Lo/Ld) phase separation and have been extremely useful to study the dynamics and lateral distribution of resident membrane proteins (17, 18) .

            "text": "A number of studies have been conducted to localize CD4 and CCR5 in lymphocyte cell membranes. Although the association of CD4 with lipid rafts is generally accepted, divergent conclusions have been reached regarding the raft localization of CCR5 (6, 12) . Confirming previous results, we observed by immunofluorescence that CD4 colocalized with raft-resident ganglioside GM1 in CD4 + /CCR5 + HeLa cells, whereas CCR5 colocalized only partially with GM1 ( fig. S1 ). When we prepared GPMVs from CD4 + /CCR5 + HeLa cells by gentle formaldehyde and dithiothreitol (DTT) treatment (movie S1 and fig. S2, A and B), which forms membrane blebs by releasing otherwise intact cell membranes from the cytoskeleton (17, 18) , we found that most GPMVs showed microscopic Lo/Ld phase separation below 25\u00b0C (movie S2 and fig. S2 , C to E). As expected from immunostaining of intact cells, CD4 and GM1 were substantially excluded from the Ld region in GPMVs, indicating the partitioning of CD4 into the Lo region ( Fig. 1 , B and C). Preferential localization of CCR5 at the boundaries between Lo and Ld phases occurred and was evident in cell-attached blebs and cell-detached GPMVs (Fig. 1, B and C) . This result might explain the debate about the controversial association of CCR5 with lipid rafts: CCR5 is not associated with Lo or with Ld lipid phases but accumulates at the boundaries between them. Very similar results were obtained with an alternative procedure to induce membrane blebs by the application of small concentrations of N-ethylmaleimide (NEM) ( fig. S3 ), suggesting that the results are independent of the blebbing agent and that the resulting GPMVs do not have serious membrane defects.",

Murine leukemia viruses (MLVs) pseudotyped with HIV gp120/gp41 and fluorescently labeled with mKO-Gag were incubated with CD4 + /CCR5 + GPMVs. We visualized bound particles by epifluorescence microscopy and found that they migrate along The preparation of large-scale phase-separated GPMVs facilitates the study of the lateral distribution of CD4 and CCR5 and the role of ordered lipid domains in HIV entry. Lo and Ld phases on GPMVs are indicated with red and blue lines, respectively. (B and C) Partitioning of CD4 and CCR5 in cell-attached (B) or cell-detached (C) GPMVs. GPMVs were first stained with 1,1\u2032-didodecyl-3,3,3\u2032,3\u2032-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine perchlorate (DiI) at 4\u00b0C for 60 min and then incubated with fluorescent-labeled CTxB (Alexa Fluor 555), anti-CD4 (Alexa Fluor 488), or anti-CCR5 (Alexa Fluor 647) antibodies at 4\u00b0C for 60 min. Epifluorescence images of GPMVs performed at room temperature (~22\u00b0C) show large-scale Lo/Ld phase coexistence in which DiI and CTxB are used as markers of Ld and Lo phases, respectively. The selected rectangles are enlarged and shown below. (D) HIV binding to cell-attached GPMVs. Cell-attached GPMVs (left) and viruses labeled with mKO-Gag (center) are visualized by bright-field and epifluorescence microscopy, respectively. Image overlay (right) shows that some bright dots (HIV Env particles) indicated by arrows are sitting on the GPMV surface (top). Time series of images from the selected box region shows that the particles bound to GPMV are free to move laterally along the GPMV surface (bottom). A movie version of this figure is available (movie S3). (E and F) HIV binding to the boundaries between Lo and Ld phases in cell-attached (E) or cell-detached (F) GPMVs. GPMVs (left) and HIV Env particles (center) were labeled with DiO and mKO-Gag, respectively. (G) Quantification of virions bound to three different regions (Lo, Ld, and Lo/Ld boundary) of the GPMVs. Data are means \u00b1 SD of triplicates. A total of 120 virions were analyzed for their distribution between the three compartments. The largest fraction of virions was found in Lo/Ld boundary regions. Scale bars, 10 mm. the GPMV surfaces ( Fig. 1D and movie S3) . Staining the GPMVs with the Ld marker 3,3\u2032-dilinoleyloxacarbocyanine perchlorate (DiO) showed that most bound particles localize to Lo/Ld boundary regions in cellattached (Fig. 1E, movie S4, and fig. S4 ) and cell-detached GPMVs ( Fig. 1F and movie S5). We quantified the virions bound to three different regions (Lo, Ld, and Lo/Ld boundaries), as shown in Fig. 1G . To assess whether the targeting of the virions to the Lo/Ld interface is specific to HIV Env, we also performed similar experiments with MLVs pseudotyped with the Env G protein (glycoprotein) from vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV-G). VSV-G virions preferentially bound to the Ld phase in GPMVs ( fig. S5 ), indicating that the Lo/Ld boundary interaction is not a general feature of all viral particles and requires HIV Env. Given that CD4 is initially localized in Lo phase regions of the membrane, it seems reasonable to propose that HIV virions bind to CD4-rich Lo phase membrane regions and then move to domain boundaries where they also engage with CCR5. CCR5 binding and the preferential targeting of the gp41 fusion peptide to lipid phase boundaries (16) likely combine to direct the particles for fusion at these boundaries.",

Virions were labeled with selfquenching concentrations of the fluorescent lipid probe R18 and mixed with unlabeled GPMVs. Lipid mixing was only observed when the GPMVs contained both CD4 and CCR5 but was negligible with GPMVs that were derived from HeLa cells lacking receptors and coreceptors ( Fig. 2A) . Demonstrating the specificity of the HIV/GPMV fusion system, we found that lipid mixing is strongly suppressed by the well-known HIV entry inhibitors maraviroc and enfuvirtide (Fig. 2B ). Maraviroc inhibits binding to the co-receptor CCR5 (19) , and enfuvirtide inhibits fusion by blocking the required conformational change of gp41 (20) . Maraviroc reduced the targeting of HIV virions to phase boundaries (Fig. 2C) , further supporting the notion that CCR5 recognition occurs at these boundaries. By contrast, enfuvirtide had little effect on the boundary preference of HIV binding while still blocking fusion (Fig. 2D ), suggesting that boundary binding alone is not sufficient for fusion; it requires the energy from refolding gp41 into the six-helix bundle structure as well.",

In addition, we carried out electron cryo-microscopy (cryoEM) in an attempt to directly visualize the process of fusion of viral particles with GPMVs. As previously observed for bare MLVs containing only Gag and Gag-Pol (21), the spherical or tennis racket-shaped particles showed a characteristic morphology with a capsid surrounded by the viral envelope (Fig. 2F ). Representative electron micrographs obtained from four different incubations with two separate viral and two separate GPMV preparations show HIV Env particles in intimate contact with the GPMV surfaces ( Fig. 2G  and fig. S6 ). We also observed membrane perturbations in very confined areas of the GPMV lipid bilayer that may represent fusion intermediates (Fig. 2G ). To ensure that the observed contacts were specific, controls with GPMVs lacking CD4 and CCR5 were mixed with HIV Env particles. Fifteen to 30 randomly selected GPMVs per grid were imaged for three different samples, and no virus-GPMV fusion events were observed. However, the present resolution of the cryoEM images does not permit a distinction between Lo and Ld phases and is thus not sufficient to determine whether fusion occurs at the Lo/Ld phase boundaries.",

MbCD treatment of GPMVs led to a marked change from approximately circular Lo domains to corrugated shapes that are characteristic for bilayers in the gel phase ( Fig. 3A and movie S6). However, cholesterol extraction did not significantly alter the overall surface expression levels of CD4 or CCR5 on GPMVs (Fig. 3B ). Virion binding was quantified by directly counting the number of particles attached to GPMVs (Fig. 3C ) or by a centrifugation-based assay ( fig. S7 ). Regardless of the method, particle binding was high and not diminished by cholesterol depletion of the GPMVs, indicating that the presence of Lo domains is not required for the binding of virions. However, HIV Env particles did not bind to GPMVs lacking CD4 and CCR5, further confirming that their attachment is mediated by these receptors rather than lipid phase separation.",

This result agrees with a previous report demonstrating a decrease of HIV cell entry after depletion of cholesterol from the host cell membrane (22) . The inhibitory effect on fusion by the disruption of Lo phases and Lo/Ld phase boundaries in GPMVs suggests that the unique properties of these boundaries are responsible for attracting receptors and co-receptors and the high fusogenicity of HIV Env virions at these sites. Thus, the same physical principles that promote fusion peptide-mediated fusion in lipid model membranes, namely, line tension and lipid packing defects at Lo/Ld phase boundaries (23), also provide a significant driving force for membrane fusion of HIV Env viral particles with biological membranes.",

Here, we tested whether lysolipids affect the lipid phase behavior of GPMVs and the ability of HIV to fuse with them. Lysosphingomyelin (lysoSM) partially dissolved the Lo domains of GPMVs into much smaller domains, whereas lysophosphatidylcholine (lysoPC) had little effect on Lo domains ( Fig. 4A and movie S7). Although both lysoSM and lysoPC share a choline headgroup and a similar molecular shape, they may differently affect line tension at phase boundaries. LysoSM is a linactant that appears to reduce line tension, whereas lysoPC probably partitions more uniformly into the Ld phase with a lesser effect on line tension. HIV Env virion binding was not affected by lysoSM or lysoPC (Fig. 4B ). However, lysoSM significantly reduced the fusion efficiency of HIV particles, whereas lysoPC had only a moderate effect (Fig. 4B ). Together, these results again support the notion that the site of fusion is the domain boundary region where inhibitory lysoSM is enriched, but lysoPC is not enriched. The same effect could be triggered enzymatically. Treatment of GPMVs with phospholipase A2 (PLA2), which hydrolyzes glycerophospholipids, including PC to lysoPC, had little effect on the lipid phase behavior of GPMVs and HIV fusion, whereas sphingolipid ceramide N-deacylase (SCDase), which converts SM into lysoSM, dispersed the Lo domains, which eventually spread over the entire GPMV surface and significantly inhibited fusion (Fig. 4 , C and D). Note that the fluorescent lipid probe DiI always marks the Ld phases in these images. The apparent reversal of contrast in some images is due to different levels of cholesterol that can change the connectivity of Lo phases, as previously demonstrated in model systems (26) .",

Only lysoSM significantly changed the Lo domains in GUVs (Fig. 4E ) and inhibited the fusion of LUVs with HIV fusion peptide-decorated virosomes, whereas lysoPC had only a small effect at the highest concentration (Fig. 4F ). The domain edges first undulated before larger invaginations formed, eventually dispersing the domains into much smaller ones (movie S8). Regulating the size of lipid rafts by using lysosphingolipids has significant consequences not only on HIV entry but also on cell signaling. For example, it is well known that sphingosine-1-phosphate is a potent mediator of numerous signaling pathways (27) and the finding that these signaling mechanisms could be potentiated by raft regulation may be an interesting topic for future investigations. As previously reported, the recruitment of some proteins such as Ras and Rac-1 to domain boundaries may be more general and may contribute to the regulation of signaling pathways by regulating the nature and size of lipid rafts in these systems (28, 29) .",

            "text": "Supported lipid bilayers generated from synthetic and natural lipids have been widely applied since their original introduction (30) , including more recently to study fusion of single particles (16, 31) . The planar geometry of supported membranes has the advantage over GUVs that a large extended membrane can be observed by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF) microscopy and, therefore, that large numbers of single events can be simultaneously recorded with high signal-to-noise ratio in each experiment, leading to greatly improved statistics (32) . To exploit this advantage for biological membranes as well, we have developed supported planar plasma membranes (SPPMs) for single-particle fusion studies (Fig. 5A ). Our strategy for preparing SPPMs is to fuse GPMVs onto polymer-supported lipid monolayers that have been transferred from a Langmuir trough (33) , which is different from previous methods (34) and preferentially orients membrane receptors with their binding sites accessible from solution. Similar to plain supported lipid bilayers (26, 35) , SPPMs prepared in this fashion display micrometersized domains, in which raft and nonraft lipid components are laterally mobile ( fig. S8 ). In agreement with the observations with GPMVs, the overlay of CD4 and CCR5 images in SPPMs shows that CD4 was substantially associated with Lo domains, whereas CCR5 was preferentially located at the edges of the domains (Fig. 5B and fig. S9 ). We observed by TIRF microscopy that single HIV Env particles bound predominantly to domain boundaries, whereas most VSV-G particles bound to Ld phases on SPPMs (Fig. 5 , C and D). In addition, these experiments recapitulate the observation made with GPMVs that the location of HIV binding to SPPMs is determined primarily by the location of the receptor and co-receptor in these membranes and not by the lipid phases (Fig. 5E ).",

We observed no direct full fusion and very little hemifusion in Ld phases and only 11 \u00b1 3% direct full fusion and 13 \u00b1 4% hemifusion of HIV virions in the Lo phase domains (Fig. 5H ).

            "text": "Membrane fusion in HIV entry is a highly cooperative process that must overcome several energy barriers associated with different fusion intermediates. This energy must be provided and released at the right time and at the right place to drive the merger between the viral and target membranes. Although cholesterol-rich lipid domains have been implicated in cell entry, their proposed involvement was puzzling because ordered lipids are thought to be detrimental to membrane bending and fusion. However, we recently discovered that Lo/Ld phase boundaries facilitate fusion in model systems and demonstrated that line tension at these boundaries might provide an additional previously unrecognized driving force for fusion (23) . This previous work was limited because no receptors or co-receptors were present and because it could be argued that pure lipid model membranes oversimplify biological membranes. To overcome these limitations, we demonstrated in this work that a very similar mechanism governs HIV fusion with biological host membranes containing its natural receptors. We directly observed that lipid domain boundaries are the portals for HIV binding and membrane fusion, presumably because they present the weakest points in the host membrane. On the basis of these results, we propose the following model: HIV gp120 binds to CD4 receptors located in cholesterol-rich lipid domains, which exist transiently in the plasma membranes of living cells. If located near CCR5 co-receptors at domain boundaries, this initial binding leads to structural changes of gp120 and binding to the CCR5 co-receptor, enriching bound virions at the boundaries (Fig. 6A) . After CD4 and CCR5 binding, gp41 changes its conformation to expose the fusion peptide to lipids in the boundary region (16) . The predisposed preference of CCR5 for membrane domain boundaries greatly facilitates the targeting of the fusion peptide to these same fusion-promoting areas of the host membrane. Although we did not examine the other HIV co-receptor, CXCR4, in this study, it might function equivalently to CCR5 in recruiting virions to domain boundary regions for more efficient fusion. Because receptors cooperate with membrane domain boundaries to form HIV entry sites, it would be interesting to examine in future studies the binding and fusion efficiencies of HIV particles with GPMVs or SPPMs, where CD4 and CCR5 are distributed differently or randomly.",

            "text": "In contrast to many other enveloped viruses, HIV displays only a few (~14) trimeric glycoprotein spikes on its envelope (36) . This small number is certainly inefficient for HIV entry and fusion. However, the cooperativity of HIV recognition and fusion at membrane domain boundaries may be a unique way to overcome this deficiency and may provide enough energy to drive fusion through its transition states with low Env copy numbers. Just as in the model systems (23) , line tension at the boundary likely serves as an additional driving force for fusion. It is well known that CD4 + T cells play a central role in the immune response following T cell antigen receptor engagement, which triggers T cell activation and proliferation against invading pathogens (37, 38) . T cell activation elicits the recruitment of a number of proteins to ordered lipid regions (39) and results in the formation of larger membrane domains, which can be exploited by HIV to facilitate entry (Fig. 6, B and C) . HIV exhibits infection at a much lower frequency in na\u00efve CD4 + T cells than in activated CD4 + T cells (40, 41) , suggesting that HIV infection may be associated with the coalescence of cholesterol-rich lipid domains. Just as in model systems, we have shown here that line tension may also be a dominant force that promotes membrane fusion in biological membranes. The boundaries of the larger lipid domains in activated T cells could contribute to the elevated fusogenic capacity of activated T cells versus resting T cells. It is possible that activation of the immune system against other invading pathogens makes the cells more prone to HIV entry through the described mechanism. Therefore, enhanced domain activation could lead to an elevated production of HIV in people infected by other pathogens and thus an acceleration of the progression of AIDS (Fig. 6D) .",

For control experiments, MLVs pseudotyped with VSV-G and MLV core proteins were also prepared. For bulk binding and lipid mixing assays, membranes of viral particles were labeled with 20 ml of octadecyl rhodamine B chloride (1 mg/ml; R18) in 50 ml of virus for 60 min at room temperature and then free R18 was removed on a Sephadex PD-10 desalting column (GE Healthcare). The infectious titer was determined by a luciferase assay, as previously described (42) , in CD4 + /CCR5 + HeLa cells for HIV Env pseudotyped viruses.",

GPMVs were produced and isolated from the cells, as previously described (17, 18) , with slight modifications. Briefly, CD4 + /CCR5 + HeLa cells were cultured in Iscove's modified Dulbecco's medium with 10% fetal bovine serum (FBS), G418 (0.2 mg/ml), 1% penicillinstreptomycin (PenStrep), and puromycin (1 mg/ml) in an incubator at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 . Plain (CD4 \u2212 /CCR5 \u2212 ) HeLa cells, which lack CD4 and CCR5, were grown in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium, 10% FBS, and 1% PenStrep in the same incubator. After growing the cells to a confluence of 70 to 90% in culture dishes, cells were washed three times with blebbing buffer [10 mM Hepes, 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM CaCl 2 (pH 7.4)]. Membrane vesiculation was then induced by adding 25 mM formaldehyde and 2 mM DTT or 2 mM NEM in Ordered membrane domains in resting T cell plasma membranes are nanoscopic and short-lived, but small dynamic domains can coalesce to create larger ones to function as signaling platforms upon pathogen invasion. Helper CD4 + T cells recognize the pathogen-derived antigens on the surface of antigen-presenting cells (APC) and become activated by coalescence of membrane domains. The activation of CD4 + T cells stimulates the ability of B cells and CD8 + T cells to defend against the invading pathogens. In this model, we propose that CD4 + T cells that are challenged by pathogens are more prone to HIV infection than resting T cells, as indicated by the red arrows. The HIV infection leads to apoptotic T cell death and ultimately results in the progression to AIDS.",

The prism-quartz interface was lubricated with glycerol to allow easy translocation of the sample cell on the microscope stage. The light source was an argon ion laser (Innova 90C, Coherent) emitting light at 514 nm, and fluorescence was observed through a 610-nm band-pass filter (D610/60, Chroma). The beam was totally internally reflected at an angle of 72\u00b0from the normal to produce an evanescent wave. The intensity of the laser beam was computer-controlled through an acousto-optic modulator (Isomet) or could be blocked entirely by a computer-controlled shutter. The laser intensity, shutter, and camera were controlled by a homemade program written in LabVIEW (National Instruments). To investigate the targeting of HIV particles to different regions of Ld/Lo phase-separated SPPMs, mKO-labeled particles were incubated with SPPMs that were stained with DiO for 60 min at room temperature. After unbound particles were washed away with Hepes buffer, phase-separated SPPMs were visualized by epifluorescence microscopy, and bound particles were visualized by TIRF microscopy. To analyze and quantify the distribution of SPPM-bound particles, we distinguished three regions of the SPPM: Lo domains, Ld phase areas, and Lo/Ld boundary regions with a 0.75-mm width centered on the perimeter of each Lo domain. Custom-built particle-tracking software (35) was used to automatically detect the position (x and y coordinates) of each particle. To monitor the fusion of single HIV particles with the SPPM, DiD-labeled HIV Env particles were injected into a chamber, one large window wall of which was formed by the SPPM. The light source for TIRF illumination was a diode laser (CUBE640, Coherent) to excite the lipid dye DiD through a 620-nm filter (ET620/60, Chroma) and via a dichroic mirror (660dclp, Chroma). DiD fluorescence was observed through a 665-nm band-pass filter (HQ665/60, Chroma).
