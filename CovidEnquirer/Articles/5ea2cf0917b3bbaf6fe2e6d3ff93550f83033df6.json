We generated a series of the full-length, reporter-tagged, clones of GLRaV-2 and demonstrated that they are systemically infectious upon agroinfection of an experimental host plant Nicotiana benthamiana. These clones and corresponding minireplicon derivatives were used to address L1 and L2 functions in GLRaV-2 infection cycle. It was found that the deletion of genome region encoding the entire L1-L2 tandem resulted in a~100-fold reduction in minireplicon RNA accumulation. Five-fold reduction in RNA level was observed upon deletion of L1 coding region. In contrast, deletion of L2 coding region did not affect RNA accumulation. It was also found that the autocatalytic cleavage by L2 but not by L1 is essential for genome replication. Analysis of the corresponding mutants in the context of N. benthamiana infection launched by the full-length GLRaV-2 clone revealed that L1 or its coding region is essential for virus ability to establish infection, while L2 plays an accessory role in the viral systemic transport. Strikingly, when tagged minireplicon variants were used for the leaf agroinfiltration of the GLRaV-2 natural host, Vitis vinifera, deletion of either L1 or L2 resulted in a dramatic reduction of minireplicon ability to establish infection attesting to a host-specific requirement for tandem proteases in the virus infection cycle.",

The several distinct classes of the viral proteases appear to have evolved independently following acquisition of the related enzymes of the host cells with the chymotrypsinlike proteases (3C proteases) of picona-like viruses being a prime example (Gorbalenya et al., 1989) . Another class of widespread viral proteases is papain-like proteases present in diverse families of the positive-strand RNA viruses (Gorbalenya et al., 1991) . Independent of their evolutionary origins, viral proteases can be subdivided into the categories of main and leader proteases. The main proteases typified by the picornaviral 3C-protease are responsible for multiple cleavages within the viral polyprotein. In contrast, leader proteases are typically located at the N-terminus of the polyprotein and cleave in-cis only at their own C-termini. A well-studied example of a leader protease is an eponymous protease of the animal aphtoviruses (de los Santos et al., 2006) . Interestingly, several diverse viral groups, e.g., animal nidoviruses (Ziebuhr et al., 2000) and plant potyviruses (Urcuqui-Inchima et al., 2001) possess two leader proteases arranged in a tandem.",

            "text": "In addition to self-processing, many leader proteases are required for efficient amplification or transcription of the viral genome. In particular, nsp1 papain-like protease of arteriviruses regulates synthesis of the subgenomic mRNAs (Tijms et al., 2007) , while the potyviral papain-like protease HC-Pro is required for efficient genome accumulation (Kasschau et al., 1997) . Another common theme in the functions of leader proteases is virus-host interactions. Thus, aphtoviral leader protease facilitates viral infection by interfering with regulation of the host protein synthesis and innate immune response (de los Santos et al., 2006) . The papain-like proteases of the potyviruses and fungal hypoviruses are the potent suppressors of the antiviral RNA interference (RNAi) response (Ding and Voinnet, 2007; Lakatos et al., 2006; Segers et al., 2006) . The fact that in different potyviruses either papain-like or chymotrypsin-like protease can assume the RNAi suppression function (Valli et al., 2006) highlights the evolutionary plasticity of the leader proteases. Indeed, many of these proteases contain additional domains such as insect transmission (Ng and Falk, 2006) or RNA demethylase Virology 383 (2009) ",

            "text": "Perhaps, the most conspicuous feature of closteroviruses is the complex molecular architecture of their exceptionally long filamentous virions. These virions contain an over 1000 nm-long 'body' assembled by the major capsid protein (CP) and a~100 nm-long 'tail' whose major component is a minor capsid protein (CPm) (Agranovsky et al., 1995) evolutionary related to CP (Boyko et al., 1992) . Tails encapsidate~700 nt-long, 5\u2032-terminal region of the virion RNA (Alzhanova et al., 2007; Peremyslov et al., 2004a Peremyslov et al., , 2004b Satyanarayana et al., 2004) . In addition to CPm, tails incorporate the Hsp70 homolog and~60-kDa protein Napuli et al., 2000; Peremyslov et al., 2004a Peremyslov et al., , 2004b Satyanarayana et al., 2000; Tian et al., 1999 ) that facilitate tail assembly by CPm and define the tail length (Alzhanova et al., 2007; Satyanarayana et al., 2004) . In BYV, tail exhibits a three-segment structure with the tip segment likely formed by the long-distance transport factor p20 (Peremyslov et al., 2004a) . Because the mutant tail-less virions formed by CP alone are capable of encapsidating the entire genome (Alzhanova et al., 2001; Satyanarayana et al., 2004) , and because each tail component is essential for virus transport (Alzhanova et al., 2000; Peremyslov et al., 1999; Prokhnevsky et al., 2002) , tail apparently evolved as a device for facilitating Closterovirus spread in the infected plants . Strikingly, tail-like structures potentially involved in virion transport were also discovered in potyviruses (Gabrenaite-Verkhovskaya et al., 2008; Torrance et al., 2005) .",

Interestingly, replacement of L-Pro by the proteases from other closteroviruses (Peng et al., 2001) or even from an animal arterivirus (Peng et al., 2002) can rescue the RNA amplification, but not the transport function of the leader protease. It seems likely that the role of L-Pro in systemic transport is dual. First, it has a specific, protein-mediated role that was revealed by the sitedirected mutagenesis (Peng et al., 2003) . Second, because tail encapsidates the 5\u2032-terminal one third of the protease-coding region, mutations in this area can interfere with the tail assembly and virus transport.",

The entire, 16,486 nt-long GLRaV-2 genome was sequenced (Genbank accession no.

Importantly, the level of GUS activity in a HA-tagged variant was~85% of that in the original mLR-GFP/GUS.

The processing competence of each variant was investigated using in vitro translation of the capped mRNAs encompassing the 5\u2032-terminal untranslated region, the entire L1-L2 open reading frame and a short downstream region that encodes a part of the methyltransferase domain (Fig. 1B) .

As shown previously for BYV minireplicon, GUS activity provides a reliable surrogate marker for measuring accumulation of the viral RNAs in the infected cells (Peng and Dolja, 2000) . Using this marker, we found that, unexpectedly, inactivation of the L1 cleavage resulted in more efficient GUS expression; almost 2-fold increase in GUS activity was detected in three independent experiments (Fig. 1B) . In contrast, inactivation of L2 cleavage virtually abolished minireplicon infectivity: the corresponding GUS expression level was less than 0.5% of that of the parental mLR-GFP/GUS (Fig. 1B) . This result is in complete agreement with the strict requirement for the cleavage by L-Pro for BYV minireplicon infectivity (Peremyslov et al., 1998) ; indeed fusion of either L-Pro or L2 with the replicase is likely to interfere with the synthesis of viral RNAs.",

Following agroinfiltration, virions were isolated from the inoculated leaves and the virion suspensions of the equal concentrations were used to manually inoculate N. benthaniana leaves and to characterize the resulting infection foci using GFP fluorescence at 8 days post-inoculation . For the parental LR-GFP variant, inoculation yielded 9.9 \u00b1 5.6 infection foci per leaf with the mean diameter of 4.3 \u00b1 1.4 cells. Very similar results (8.2 \u00b1 4.8 foci per leaf; mean diameter of 4.1 \u00b1 1.3 cells) were obtained for the LR-GFP\u0394L2 variant indicating that L2 is dispensable for both the infectivity and cell-to-cell movement of the GLRaV-2 in N. benthamiana. Strikingly, deletion of L1 resulted in a dramatic, 25-fold reduction in the specific infectivity of the LR-GFP\u0394L1 variant (0.4 cells per leaf). Furthermore, the very few detected GFP-positive foci were unicellular suggesting that either L1 or the corresponding coding region is essential for the virion ability to establish infection in the initially inoculated cells and to move to the neighboring cells.",

Because we generated functional, HA-tagged variant of L2, we were interested to determine if this protease is associated with the virions. The GLRaV-2 virions were isolated from systemically infected leaves and fractionated using sucrose density gradient. The peak of virions was detected in fractions 12-14 using CP-specific antibody (Fig. 4) . However, the immunoblot analysis of the same gradient fractions using HA-specific antibodies showed the peak of L2 in fractions 15-17, suggesting that L2 present in the virion suspension is not physically associated with the virions (Fig.  4 ). This conclusion was further supported by the immunogold-specific electron microscopy used to detect HA epitopes present in L2. Indeed, only very weak gold labeling was found in the fractions 12-14 that contained bulk of the virions. Furthermore, a few gold microspheres detected in these fractions were not directly associated with the virions (Fig. 4, upper inset) . The L2 peak fractions 15-17 contained much larger numbers of gold microspheres, but virtually no virions (Fig. 4 , bottom inset) suggesting that L2 is not directly associated with GLRaV-2 virions.",

The deletion of L2 resulted in a systemically infectious \u0394L2 variant, which, however, exhibited slower accumulation in the upper leaves ( Figs. 2A and B ). This result indicated that L2 is required for the efficient systemic spread of GLRaV-2 in N. benthamiana.",

In a sharp contrast to N. benthamiana where L2 was superfluous for minireplicon infectivity, \u0394L2 variant exhibited a~10fold reduction in RNA accumulation upon agroinfiltration into V. vinifera leaves (Table 1 ). The specific infectivity of the \u0394L2 variant measured as a mean number of the GFP-fluorescent infected cells per leaf was also reduced~10-fold. This correlation in the RNA accumulation and the numbers of infected cells points to a role of L2 in the virus invasiveness, i.e., the ability to establish infection in the inoculated cells. Such role in GLRaV-2 invasiveness in grapevine is even more dramatic in the case of L1 where L1 deletion resulted i\u00f1 100-fold reduction in the RNA accumulation and specific infectivity (Table 1) . We concluded that both L1 and L2 are essential for the ability of GLRaV-2 to establish infection in the initially inoculated grapevine cells, at least upon the conditions of agroinfection.",

            "text": "What is a functional significance of duplication of the leader proteases in GLRaV-2? We hypothesize that the answer, at least in part, lies in the host-specific effects of L1 and L2 whose functional cooperation is more important for the infection of grapevine than N. benthamiana. A tandem of viral proteases could have evolved to boost the function of a single protease in order to subvert a perennial woody host potentially recalcitrant to virus infection. This hypothesis is compatible with the fact that in addition to GLRaV-2, protease duplication is found in CTV (Karasev et al., 1995) , Raspberry mottle virus , and Strawberry chlorotic fleck virus , each of which infects woody and/or perennial hosts, but not in BYV or Mint virus 1 (Tzanetakis et al., 2005) that infect herbaceous annual hosts. Another example of a viral protein that apparently evolved to allow the viral infection of the woody or perennial hosts is provided by the AlkB demethylase found primarily in a subset of flexiviruses (Martelli et al., 2007; van den Born et al., 2008) . The generation of the GLRaV-2 variants tagged via insertion of the reporter genes or epitopes highlights a potential of this virus as a gene expression vector for the grapevine. In general, Closterovirus-derived vectors provide advantages of relatively large genetic capacity and stability Folimonov et al., 2007) . Utility of closteroviral vectors is further enhanced by a dramatic increase in the vector infectivity by co-expression of the homologous RNAi suppressors with p24 of GLRaV-2 being among the strongest (Chiba et al., 2006) . Obviously, full realization of the GLRaV-2 vector potential requires development of the efficient inoculation technique for the grapevine.",

Bacterial suspensions of each variant were mixed with corresponding cultures transformed to express an RNAi suppressor P1/HC-Pro from Turnip mosaic virus to enhance minireplicon infectivity (Chiba et al., 2006) . The final bacterial concentrations were 1.0 OD 600 for minireplicon-expressing variants and 0.1 OD 600 for the P1/HC-Pro-expressing variant. The induced bacterial cultures were infiltrated into lower surface of the N. benthamiana leaves using a syringe without a needle or vacuum infiltrated into the grapevine leaves. The GFP-fluorescent leaf cells were visualized using epifluorescent stereomicroscope Leica MZ 16F (Deerfield, IL) at 8 days post-infiltration.
