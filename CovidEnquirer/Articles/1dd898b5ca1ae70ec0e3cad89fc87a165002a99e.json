            "text": "In 2013, U.S. swine producers were confronted with the disruptive emergence of porcine epidemic diarrhoea (PED). Movement of animals among farms is hypothesised to have played a role in the spread of PED among farms. Via this or other mechanisms, the rate of spread may also depend on the geographic density of farms and climate. To evaluate such effects on a large scale, we analyse state-level counts of outbreaks with variables describing the distribution of farm sizes and types, aggregate flows of animals among farms, and an index of climate. Our first main finding is that it is possible for a correlation analysis to be sensitive to transmission model parameters. This finding is based on a global sensitivity analysis of correlations on simulated data that included a biased and noisy observation model based on the available PED data. Our second main finding is that flows are significantly associated with the reports of PED outbreaks. This finding is based on correlations of pairwise relationships and regression modeling of total and weekly outbreak counts. These findings illustrate how variation in population structure may be employed along with observational data to improve understanding of disease spread.",

Producers had for the previous 8 years been making steady increases in the average litter size of about 0.16 head per year. 6 By November 2013, the average litter size had begun an abnormal downturn, 6 dropping 0.66 head by March 2014. 7 The virus also affected swine production in Asia and other parts of America. 8, 9 The mechanisms by which PEDV spread among farms are not yet clear. Transportation-associated transmission of PEDV has been supported by the observation at harvest facilities that it spreads among trailers used to transport swine, 10 and some experts believe that current resources of livestock trailers, trailer-washing facilities, and transport personnel are insufficient to allow for a standard 3-hour trailer cleaning between every load. 11 With such concerns in mind, some states responded to PED by requiring that imported swine be from PEDV-free premises. Transportation-independent mechanisms such as airborne particles 12 and contaminated feed [13] [14] [15] [16] have also been implicated. Detailed investigations of outbreaks on farms can be inconclusive regarding the mechanism of PEDV introduction. 3 Much of the research on PED involves detailed investigations on a small scale. For example, there have been epidemiological investigations of infected farms in North Carolina and a cluster of infected farms in Oklahoma and adjacent states. 17 Such work is effective for determining the biological plausibility of different routes, but the risk factors identified in a small-scale study may be specific to the small area of the study. Modelling studies based on large-scale surveillance data [18] [19] [20] can thus be a valuable complement to such work by quantifying the overall importance of a transmission route across a large population.",

The lower bound would be roughly a week, as virus shedding from individuals has been observed in experimental settings to subside within 9 days of infection, 28 and an infected animal's diarrhoea has been observed in the field to typically last for 5 days. 25 However, it can take affected farms several weeks to return to baseline production levels. 9, 25 In summary, within a farm spread is often rapid and complete enough that assuming all animals on the farm to have the same status is justified when observation occurs at weekly intervals.",

All of the contiguous 48 states share some portion of the nation's swine but the Midwest and North Carolina are areas of major concentration ( Supplementary Fig. S1 ), holding some 88 percent of the inventory. 5 Thus considerable climactic and density gradients exist. Live swine are moved among farms for feeding and breeding purposes. We refer to aggregated measurements of these movements as transport flows. The value of these flows varies greatly between different pairs of states with the largest flows being into the Midwest (Supplementary Fig. S1 ). These heterogeneities may result in the spread of a disease resulting in a spatio-temporal distribution of outbreaks that is dependent on the mode of farm-to-farm spread, and for PED data on both the spatio-temporal pattern and the heterogeneities are available at the state level.",

To that end, we simulated the spread of a disease among individual U.S. swine farms, simulated a series of positive accessions, and then performed the correlation analysis on the simulated accession data. The model of disease spread included contact networks based on the spatial and transport structure of U.S. farms. The correlation analysis estimated the strength of association between the similarity of the time series of accessions between a pair of states with the measure of similarity according to either spatial or transport structure. Using previously described methods, 31, 32 we computed global sensitivity indices up to second order for the mean value of these correlations for the parameter space given in Table 1 . These indices estimate the fraction of the variance in the correlation that is due to variation in individual parameters or pairs of parameters. This exercise did not validate our modeling assumptions, but rather evaluated self-consistency by showing the extent to which we could quantify and distinguish between different modes of spread given our assumed models of spread and observation.

Often, the goal of a regression analysis is to obtain a model with good predictive performance and the weight is chosen by cross validation. 33 By contrast, we have no need of a predictive model and are instead more interested in determining what variables are important to include in a model. Stability selection 34 provides a general method of identifying relevant variables. The main idea is to select variables that across many random subsamples of the data are selected with high probability by the elastic net with a given set of weights for the penalty. We use this procedure because it is less likely to select noise variables than is cross validation. 34 Further details are given in the Supplementary Note.",

This relation held whether flows and cross correlations were treated as directional (Fig. 3a) , were averaged over both directions ( Supplementary Fig. S6 ), or were ranked ( Supplementary Figs. S7 and S8). The size of the correlation was comparable to those seen in our simulations for high transmission probabilities across network edges (Supplementary Fig. S3 ). The p values for these correlations were all below 0.05 / 6, which means that they would remain significant after using a Bonferroni method of limiting the probability that any false positives occurred in our tests to 0.05. On the other hand, in no case would the correlations between geographic distance and cross correlations remain significant after such a correction. The correlations between the cross correlation matrix and the shared border matrix were similar to or weaker than those of the distance matrix, were not significant after Bonferroni correction, and were not included in the plots to keep them simpler. Analogous results hold for lag-0 and lag-2 cross correlations.

Figure 4 displays the predicted and observed marginal relationships between flows and positive accessions for one of the models. Although our flow variables were based on the outcome of variable selection, they are not equivalent to any of the variables in the variable selection procedure and the data analysed here has a time dimension not present in the data used for variable selection. Thus to confirm the statistical significance of the within-state flows, we conducted a likelihood ratio test of the hypothesis that models lacking terms for within-state flow were sufficient. The test favoured rejection of models without within-state flows (\u03c7 2 1 = 12.9, p = 1.6 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ).",

The correlation between transport and cross correlations seemed to be driven in part by concentration of both high cross correlations and large flows in Midwestern states ( Supplementary Fig. S1) . The cross correlations of these states results from the presence of a small wave of positive accessions early in the outbreak and a much larger wave toward the end of our observations (Fig. 3b, left column) . Also, Kansas and Oklahoma share a distinctive period of high positive accessions in the middle of the time series and fairly large flows (Supplementary Fig. S9 and Fig. 3b) . Epidemiological reports suggest that windborne transmission was important for spread in Oklahoma, and thus the summer activity in Kansas and Oklahoma may also have been a consequence of short-distance, spatial spread. It is not known how the spread in these states occurred in spite of the high temperatures that were thought to have slowed PEDV transmission in other states during the summer. North Carolina is distinct from the Midwest in that no outbreaks occurred in the spring and many outbreaks occurred in October (Fig. 3b) . Epidemiological reports suggest that PEDV was introduced in the Midwest and eventually reached North Carolina via transport. The high number of sow farms in the state may have allowed for a largely self-sustained cluster of outbreaks following introduction. Although the matrices measuring spatial transmission may not have come out as significant in our analysis, consideration of the epidemiological explanations for the time series suggests that spatial transmission may to some extent explain the significance of the transport flow matrix.",

Two reasonable steps toward such an objective are to assemble as many relevant explanatory variables as possible about reporting rates and measures of exposure based on prior scientific knowledge and then to determine if the available data support the conclusion that these variables are relevant. Our general contribution has been to provide a worked-out example of how variation in the structure of the population across a large scale may allow for the identification of variables with relevance to mechanisms of spread. We have also demonstrated the use of stability selection and regularised regression for the task of filtering out noise variables from a set of candidates. These examples may serve to provide analysts with new ideas about how to make the most efficient use of often limited epidemiological data, hopefully leading to more rapid understanding of transmission and how to stop it. Table 3 . Summary of models. The models chiefly differ by how contact is assumed to depend on flows. In the null model, denoted by none, contact was independent of flows. In the internal model, contact was a function of within-state flows. In the directed model, contact was a function of flows moving into a state and within-state flows. In the undirected model, contact was a function of within-state flows and both flows into and out of a state. The column \"Fit \u03b7?\" indicates whether we estimated the value of \u03b7, which corresponds to risk that is independent of the number of infective farms. The symbol \u03b8 denotes the dispersion parameter of the negative binomial response. The symbol \u03c3 denotes the standard deviation of the random effect of (geographic) state on transmission rates. To display their density, they have been made transparent and jittered along the y axis. The y axis was transformed using y = log(Positive accessions + 1).",

Although it might seem preferable to analyse the 2014-2015 data on positive farms instead of positive accessions, the 2013 data may be more informative of transmission routes because farms protected by immunity rather than lack of exposure were most likely less frequent in 2013.

FromFig. 5we have the estimate for the directed model that one factor in the average pairwise transmission rate from farms in one area to those in another increases with the annual transport flow raised to the power of about 3.2/4.3 \u2248 0.75.

Likewise, 2009 interstate flow estimates for the U.S. cattle herd were in general agreement with 2001 estimates. 44 Of course, updated flow estimates are desirable for future modelling.The main limitation of this analysis is that flows are correlated with several other variables, and we cannot rule out that these other variables are the true drivers of the observed effect of flows. We have formulated our time series SIR model based on the relationship between flows and inventory.
