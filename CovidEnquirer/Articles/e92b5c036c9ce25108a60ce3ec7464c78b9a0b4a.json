Reliable methods of detection in clinical samples are needed for a better understanding of their role in pathology. As a first step in the design of such diagnostic procedures, the sensitivities and specificities of two viral diagnostic assays were compared in an experimental cell culture model: an indirect immuno-fluorescence assay using monoclonal antibodies and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification of viral RNA from infected cells. Immunofluorescence detected human coronaviruses in cells infected at a MOI as low as 10 \u2212 2 (log TCID 50 /ml =4.25 for HCV-229E and 2.0 for HCV-OC43; log PFU/ml= 4.83 for HCV-229E and 1.84 for HCV-OC43) versus 10 \u2212 3 (HCV-OC43) or 10 \u2212 4 (HCV-229E) for reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction amplification (log TCID 50 /ml =1.75 for HCV-229E and 1.5 for HCV-OC43; log PFU/ml= 2.3 for HCV-229E and 1.34 for HCV-OC43). There were no false positive signals with other human respiratory pathogens: influenza virus, respiratory syncytial virus and adenovirus. Moreover, each assay was coronavirus serogroup-specific. These results demonstrate the potential usefulness of immunofluorescence with monoclonal antibodies and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction RNA amplification for the rapid detection of human coronaviruses in infected cell cultures. Both methods could be applied to clinical specimens for the diagnosis of human infections.",

These ubiquitous but not well studied viruses have been associated with 30% of common colds in humans (Myint, 1995) . Experimentally, both the 229E and OC43 prototype strains can infect human astrocytes and microglia in primary cultures (Bonavia et al., 1997) and their RNA was detected in a significant proportion of human autopsy brain samples Arbour and Talbot, unpublished results) , which is consistent with their neurotropic potential. In clinical studies, various reports have associated human coronaviruses with nosocomial respiratory infections in premature newborns, as diagnosed by indirect immunofluorescence (Sizun et al., 1995) , and enterocolitis in neonates with evidence of human coronaviruses shown by electron microscopy (Chany et al., 1982) . Serodiagnosed human coronaviruses were also associated with exacerbations of asthma (Nicholson et al., 1993) , and pericarditis (Riski and Hovi, 1980) . Therefore, these viruses might be involved in diseases far more serious than mild upper respiratory tract infections.",

Various methods have been described for the detection of human coronaviruses. Virus isolation in cell culture is difficult, time-consuming and effective with adapted strains in specialised laboratories. Serological methods, mainly based on ELISA, were used for epidemiological studies but do not allow rapid virus identification (Kraaijeveld et al., 1980; McNaughton et al., 1983; Gill et al., 1994) . Immunofluorescence with rabbit antisera was developed for the rapid detection of human coronaviruses in nasopharyngeal secretions (McIntosh et al., 1978) . However, specificity of this technique was disputed because of cross-re-action between the two human coronaviruses strains, OC43 and 229E (Myint, 1995) and sensitivity was difficult to ascertain since no human coronaviruses antigen was detected in a prospective evaluation of 106 children hospitalized for respiratory tract infections. Detection of nucleic acids by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used in nasal aspirates (Myint et al., 1994) . Nested PCR was apparently as sensitive as a combination of viral isolation in cell culture and serology.",

No false positive signals were observed with human influenza virus, human respiratory syncytial virus and human adenovirus. Importantly, each mAb was human coronaviruses serogroup-specific. Polyclonal antibodies used in a previous study did not show such serogroup specificity since OC43-infected cells yielded a positive signal when the 229E-specific antibody was used (McIntosh et al., 1978) . Epidemiological studies have shown that patients infected with the 229E strain of human coronaviruses rarely have circulating antibodies against the OC43 strain (Kapikian et al., 1969) .

In the only other published report on the detection of human coronaviruses by RT-PCR, the sensitivity of a nested PCR technique was compared in clinical samples to two techniques, ELISA and cell culture, the latter being only available for HCV-229E (Myint et al., 1994) . The PCR technique appeared more sensitive than either cell culture or ELISA, but less than the two associated techniques. Specificity in clinical use was difficult to ascertain because of possible dual infections (human coronaviruses with either rhinovirus or influenza virus). These investigations used the classical single-step RNA extraction of Chomczynski and Sacchi (1989) , which requires 3 -4 h to execute, and they undertook two PCR amplification rounds. It would be difficult to obtain results within 1 day using this protocol. A simple cells lysis with DEPC-treated water and elimination of proteins and cell walls allowed us to perform RT-PCR for several samples very rapidly. The technique we used would be more appropriate for treating a large number of human samples containing few cells. We have already reported the use of the RT-PCR technique with clinical samples Bonavia et al., 1997) .",
