Intense diffuse 18F-fluorodeoxyglucose uptake was noted in the liver (Figure 1) . Subsequent liver and bone marrow biopsies demonstrated numerous fibrin ring granulomas (Figures 2 and 3) , raising suspicion for Coxiella burnetii infection. Serologies confirmed the diagnosis of acute Q fever with phase I and phase II IgM and IgG titers > 256 on indirect immunofluorescence assay (Focus Diagnostics, Inc., Cypress, CA). Q fever, originally called query fever, is a zoonotic disease caused by the gram-negative pleomorphic rod C. burnetii. It manifests as self-limited fever, granulomatous hepatitis, and pneumonia in the acute form. 1 Infection usually results from inhalation of dust or soil contaminated with livestock waste. 1 Many animals, including cattle, sheep, goats, pigs, cats, and dogs, are reservoirs for C. burnetii and shed the bacteria in milk, saliva, feces, and urine. 2, 3 Infected animals are generally asymptomatic; reproductive abnormalities, such as multiple abortions among members of a herd, can serve as the only evidence of disease. Bacterial concentrations are particularly high in animal products of conception. 4 Human-to-human transmission is very rare, but infection via placental and sexual contact has been documented. 5, 6 Symptomatic Q fever from ingestion of raw or unpasteurized milk has also been described. 7 Human infection, when symptomatic, tends to present as an influenza-like syndrome with general malaise, myalgias, nausea, fevers, and headaches-but up to 60% of acute infections are asymptomatic. 2 Moreover, the initial symptoms can differ by geographic location. In certain locales, granulomatous hepatitis is present in 9-67% of cases. 8, 9 The characteristic granulomas of Q fever hepatitis have a central lipid vacuole surrounded by histiocytes and lymphocytes; a fibrin ring that is periodic acid-Schiff-positive serves as the outer rim ( Figure 2 ). 9,10 Although classically described in association with Q fever, these lesions are nonspecific and have been identified in numerous diseases, such as leishmaniasis, boutonneuse fever, salmonella, toxoplasmosis, cytomegalovirus infection, Epstein-Barr virus infection, Mycobacterium avium-intracellulare infection, Hodgkin disease, and allopurinol reaction. 10 The immunofluorescence assay is the most widely used serologic test for Q fever. 2 ",

He demonstrated delayed defervescence, remaining febrile 10 days after restarting the drug, which is not uncommon in Q fever hepatitis. 11 Steroid therapy is an option for patients with prolonged pyrexia, as the elevated temperatures may be immunologic. 11, 12 Although the pathophysiology of delayed defervescence in Q fever hepatitis is unclear, patients with liver involvement have higher levels of tumor necrosis factor and interleukin-10 in comparison to those with fever alone. 13 Ultimately, this patient's fevers and elevated transaminases improved, and he was discharged home on doxycycline. When seen 10 days later, he was finishing a 3-week course of the antibiotic, and his symptoms had entirely resolved. Q fever is rarely diagnosed in the United States, with only 134 cases reported to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention in 2011. 14 However, seroprevalence of the disease in the United States is approximately 3.1%, suggesting that it is widely under-recognized. 15 Because C. burnetii remains a clinically important contributor to fevers of unknown origin worldwide, clinicians should reserve a high index of suspicion for this uncommon disease. Careful histories of exposure could aid in timely diagnosis. Figure 3 Bone marrow biopsy hematoxylin and eosin stain demonstrating a fibrin ring granuloma with a central vacuole.",
