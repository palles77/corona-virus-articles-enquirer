The anticodon may then re-pair with a now-nearby similar codon, so that synthesis continues downstream.

Hopping requires a \"takeoff site\" codon and a similar sequence acting as a \"landing site\" immediately 5' of the codon for the next amino acid on the resumption of synthesis. Hopping was first encountered over short distances by inserting test sequences early in the lacZ gene of Escherichia coli (Weiss et al., 1987) . For instance, CUU UAG CUA (Leu stop Leu) was decoded with an efficiency of 1% as a single leucine from the 9 nucleotides. Hopping was also detected when the takeoff and landing sites overlapped, as in the sequence WUA (Weiss et al., 1987; O'Connor et al., 1989) . At about the same time, tRNA mutants were isolated that increased the hopping at certain sites (Falahee et al., 1988; Hughes et al., 1989) , and hopping was detected over as many as three stop codons, albeit at decreased efficiency. The mutants have an extra base in a tRNA anticodon (O'Connor et al., 1989 ) that somehow promotes hopping. One inference to be made from their study is that there may be good reasons why almost all natural tRNAs have seven-membered anticodon loops! Even with these precedents, the discovery of high level, natural, programmed hopping was a surprise.",

Several key features required for ribosomal bypass of this coding gap have been defined utilizing variants generated as gene 60-/acZ fusions (Weiss et al., 199Oa ). The analogy to low level and tRNA suppressor-mediated hopping is supported by a strict requirement for a matched set of codons at the takeoff and landing sites.

Three of these elements are located at the coding gap: the matched codon set defining its borders, a stop codon at the 5'junction of the gap contained within a short stemloop structure, and an optimal 50 nucleotide spacing separating the 5' and 3' junctions. The fourth, and most surprising, feature is a stringent requirement for a specific amino acid sequence in the nascent peptide translated from the 46 codons preceding the coding gap. This nascent peptide enables the ribosome that has just synthesized it to bypass the coding gap, although its mode of action is undefined. This nascent-chain effect adds another example to an expanding list of interesting translation events mediated through the nascent protein chain, such as signal recognition particle arrest of elongation (Wolin and Walter, 1988 ) autoregulated instability of 8-tubulin mRNA (Yen et al., 1989) and regulation of the carbamoylphosphate synthetase A gene, CPA7, in Saccharomyces cerevisiae (Werner et al., 1987) .",

The high level of shifting at A AAA AAG is, in fact, utilized in the decoding of an E. coli gene, dnaX, which encodes two DNA polymerase III subunits (Flower and McHenry, 1990; Blinkowa and Walker, 1990; Tsuchihashi and Kornberg, 1990) . Frameshifting is utilized by one bacterial IS1 (\"insertion sequence 1\") element (Sekine and Ohtsubo, 1989) , and by extrapolation from the known sequences, is likely to be utilized by at least some members of the IS3 family as well (P&e et al., 1990) .

            "text": "Shifty runs alone, however, are not sufficient for high level shifting. Secondary signals programmed in the mRNA augment shifting at the slippery sequence to give high levels of frameshifting. We call these signals \"stimulators;' and they are very diverse (Figure 1 ). For the +l shift for decoding RF2, two stimulators are utilized. One is a Shine-Dalgarno sequence located 3 nucleotides 5'of the shift site that interacts with the 3'end of 16s ribosomal RNA of elongating ribosomes (Weiss et al., 1988a) . This finding leads to the surprising conclusion that ribosomal RNA is continuously monitoring mRNA sequences during translation. The second stimulator is a UGA terminator at codon 26 flanking the shift site on its 3' side (Weiss et al., 1987; Curran and Yarus, 1988) . The stimulators act independently with substantial activity, but their effects are synergistic. Use of both stimulators means that RF2 frameshifting utilizes both an interaction normally involved in initiation and one involved in termination, within the middle of a decoding region! At least in E. coli, a role of 3'flanking termination codons in promoting frameshifting has been uncovered with constructs made in a /acZ reporter system. This role of stop codons has been extensively investigated, and while it may act by causing a long pause in decoding, the alternative of an abortive termination event prior to release factor binding needs to be seriously considered (Weiss et al., 1990b) . The 5' RF2 stimulator, the Shine-Dalgarno sequence, which augments a +l shift, has the effect of forcing the mRNA in the direction it normally moves (3' to 5' [the ribosome normally moves 5' to 3' with respect to the message]), while the -1 shift at the retroviral tandem slippery sequence forces the mRNA backward (5'to 3'). When these two components are put together in an artificial hybrid, the Shine-Dalgarno stimulator for RF2 dampens the retroviral shift. In other words, a stimulator for a +l shift can act as an inhibitor for a -1 shift (Weiss et al., 1990b) .",

The question does, however, raise the general issue of how ribosomes open up mRNA secondary structure. Jacks et al. (1987, 1988a) proposed that the stem-loop structures appropriately positioned downstream of the retroviral shift sites cause pausing of ribosomes such that the shifting on the double slippery codons at the decoding site prior to peptide bond formation is facilitated. While the leading ribosome may be caused to pause by certain stem-loop structures, if the following ribosomes are closely spaced they may not encounter the stem-loop structure in the same way. Wolin and Walter (1988) have found that eukaryotic ribosomes can be tightly packed behind the leading ribosome at the stall site they examined in a preprolactin mRNA in vitro.",

Experiments with tissue culture cells are clearly needed, especially since reticulocyte lysate protein synthesis experients, or studies in yeast cells, showed little or no effect of S'sequences on human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) frameshifting . Whether this is due to a minor quirk of the in vitro system or is a basic difference of HIV from other retroviruses has not yet been determined. The HIV family of retroviruses is different in many important ways from the other retroviruses in which frameshifting has been studied, and it will be interesting to compare any HIV frameshifting stimulator, when found, with that of the other viruses. Results from tissue culture cells will need to be compared with the findings from infected cells where altered tRNA modification has been reported. The tRNAPhe present in cells infected with a retrovirus that utilizes a U run as the slippery sequence lacks the highly modified Wye base in its anticodon. Similarily, the tRNAASn decoding AAC in the A AAA AAC sequence lacks the Q base in its anticodon (Hatfield et al., 1989) . As the earlier results have shown, these undermodifications are clearly not essential for frameshifting, but to what extent they contribute needs to be assessed.",

However, for the tRNALeU that decodes the 0 frame CUU, it is a slippery sequence. This tRNA has the anticodon 3'GAU-5', with an unmodified uracil in its wobble position, so is able to decode the +l frame UUA after slipping forward 1 base. The stimulator in this case is a 3' adjacent rare arginine codon, AGG, decoded by a minor tRNA (see Belcourt and Farabaugh, 1990 ) that might cause a pause in translation. When the level of the minor tRNAAw is increased, the level of frameshifting decreases (Xu and Boeke, 1990 ).

Before the sequence became known, it was thought that a clever way to regulate the synthesis of RF2 would be to have an inframe UGA stop codon early in the gene. If there was an adequate level of RF2, termination would ensue and further RF2 would not be synthesized. If RF2 was limiting, then this would allow UGG-decoding tRNA'P the chance to insert Trp at the UGA and the readthrough would permit decoding of the bulk of the gene to replenish the supply of RF2. As discovered by Craigen et al. (1985) however, this model was only half correct. As introduced above, there is an in-frame UGA terminator at codon 26, but a +l frameshift is required to decode the main part (downstream) of the gene. The frameshifting can be at high levels (30% or more), which is higher than stop codon readthrough levels (except where selenocysteine is inserted; see below), and this may be one reason for the utilization of frameshifting rather than stop codon readthrough.",

The initial findings were with Rous sarcomavirus, where 5% of the ribosomes translating gag shift to the -1 frame shortly before the terminator and enter pal (Jacks and Varmus, 1985) . With HIV the situation is similar except that the level is higher, 12% Jacks et al., 1988b) . With MMTV, in contrast, two -1 shifts are required, as the protease gene lies between the gag andpol genes. A -1 shift at 23% efficiency brings ribosomes to the protease gene, and a second shift at 8% near the end of the protease gene brings ribosomes to the pol gene to generate a gag-pro-p01 fusion at an overall ratio to gag similar to that found with the single-shift situation with Roussarcomavirus (Moore et al., 1987; Jacks et al., 1987) . Sequences similar to those responsible for frameshifting in these three retroviruses (see above) are found in the great majority of other sequenced retroviruses, making it likely that frameshifting (all -1) is used by them to make the gag-pal fusion polyprotein. (The alternative of stop codon readthrough is seen in murine leukemia virus and a few other retroviruses; see below). The yeast \"killer\" particle uses a -1 frameshift mechanism similar to that of the retroviruses (Icho and Wickner, 1989; Diamond et al., 1989) . A -1 frameshift is used in the replicase gene of two coronaviruses, avian IBV and mouse hepatitis virus, to allow ribosomes to enter a region encoding a further, massive 350 kd of protein. It is likely also to be used by a number of (+)-stranded plant viruses (Miller et al., 1988; Veidt et al., 1988; Xiong and Lommel, 1989) and in at least one of these it is now being confirmed.",

The level of frameshifting appears to determine the level of transposition (see Sekine and Ohtsubo, 1989 ), but whether the frameshifting level is responsive to stress or other conditions is unknown. Double-stranded DNA phages have also responded to the lure of shiftiness: in phage k a relatively low level of -1 frameshifting (~2.5%) occurs at a double slippery codon near the end of gene G to generate a fusion product termed GT GT is an essential phage tail component, and translation of the T open reading frame except as part of the fusion has not been detected (M. Levin, R. Hendrix, and S. Casjens, unpublished data).

Readthrough of a leaky UGA terminator at the end of the Cl6 coat protein gene results in tryptophan being inserted in response to the UGA codon at the relatively low efficiency of ~3% (Weiner and Weber, 1973) . Readthrough results in a considerably elongated product that is incorporated into the virion and is essential for infectivity (Hofstetter et al., 1974) . In contrast, UAG readthrough is required for synthesis of a subunit of the pili of toxigenic E. coli (Jalajakumari et al., 1989) . A well-known example of UAG readthrough is found in the replicase gene of tobacco mosaic virus (Pelham, 1978) . Termination at the leaky UAG stop codon results in the synthesis of a 126 kd protein, whereas readthrough (at an efficiency of 10%) leads to the synthesis of a 183 kd product essential for infectivity. The UAG can be replaced by UAA without affecting infectivity (Ishikawa et al., 1986) .",

The conserved sequences are CAA UAG CAA @A. We wondered if the stop codon was hopped over by tRNAGrn, rather than read through. However, Skuzeski et al. (unpublished data) have evidence that rather than hopping being involved, there is a special context or stimulator for readthrough. A second group of plant RNA viruses has different sequences flanking the leaky UAG stop codon. This group, which includes maize chlorotic mottle virus (Nutter et al., 1989) has the sequence AAA UAG G. Readthrough is also used by several (+)-stranded animal viruses of the alphavirus family, such as Sindbis (Strauss et al., 1983) ; interestingly, other members of the same family, such as Semliki Forest virus (Takkinen, 1986) , have a sense codon in place of the stop codon. In Sindbis virus, stop codon readthrough (in the alphaviruses the stop codon utilized is UGA) is involved in expression of one of the replicase constituent proteins. Replacement of the UGA stop codon by either a sense codon or one of the other stop codons has subtle deleterious effects on the virus (Li and Rice, 1989). It is suspected, but not established, that the polyprotein plays some role independent of its processed components.",

A minority of other retroviruses, such as feline leukemia virus (Yoshinaka et al., 1985b) , are very likely to use a similar mechanism. The 10% readthrough efficiency of the UAG terminator of the gag gene of murine leukemia virus in vivo is dependent on preservation of a strong stem-loop structure containing the UAG in the loop (Jones et al., 1989; see also Panganiban, 1988) . It is presumed that the stem-loop structure is required for the readthrough process, and so it is a stimulator in the sense used above, but the possibility has not been excluded that this structure is required solely for some other viral function. ten Dam et al. (1990) have pointed out that the stem-loop containing the stop codon in the loop has not been preserved in feline leukemia virus; instead, one of the most stable potential stem-loop structures occurs just downstream of the UAG codon and is capable of forming a pseudoknot. This putative stem-loop begins 8 nucleotides 3' of the stop codon, a similar distance from the shift site in those viruses utilizing frameshifting, and a similar structure may also be able to form in murine leukemia virus. An investigation of the requirements for UAG readthrough in the feline leukemia virus context is clearly needed.",

The best studied occurrences of selenocysteine are in formate dehydrogenase of E. coli (Zinoni et al., 1986) and in glutathione peroxidase (Chambers et al., 1986) of several mammalian species. Selenocysteine is highly sensitive to oxidation, but its function is mostly unknown. Preliminary studies have shown that formate dehydrogenase containing cysteine in place of selenocysteine has 4-to 5-fold lower specific activity (Bock and Stadtman, 1988). However, apart from the evolutionary questions raised by the cotranslational insertion of selenium, the main interest raised by this remarkable discovery is in how it occurs, and what is \"special\" about the UGA codons that encode it.",

This tRNA can be converted to phosphoseryl-tRNA, which in turn (Lee et al., 1989) can be converted to selenocysteyl-tRNASer. However, in E. coli the conversion giving selenocysteine on tRNA does not occur by this mechanism (see Leinfelder et al., 1990) . Regardless of the details, in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes selenocysteine is the 21st amino acid found to be directly encoded. It will be interesting to see if incorporation of other natural nonstandard amino acids can be engineered by mutational alterations of aminoacyl-tRNA synthetases. A unique tRNA for selenocysteine incorporation has also been characterized in E. coli. It has the anticodon 3'-AC&Y, complementary to UGA in the mRNA, and an unusually long acceptor stem (Schdn et al., 1989 , and references therein). When the \"special\" UGA triplet decoded by this tRNA is replaced by a UGC cysteine codon (but not by a UCA codon with a second position change), the level of selenocysteine incorporation approaches that found when UGA is present (see Zinoni et al., 1990) . The selenocysteine-inserting tRNA can therefore compete effectively with tRNACfl, as well as with RF2, when the mRNA context is \"special.\"",

This type of frameshifting is not a general property of tRNAs but, at least at a high level, may be unique to tRNAp and tRNAjhr. Anticodon replacement experiments have shown that the shifting ability is a special property of the anticodon and not a peculiarity of the,rest of the tRNA (Bruce et al., 1986) . Increasing the ratio of tRNAp or tRNAghr in proportion to the levels of the tRNAs that normally decode the GCA alanine and CCG proline codons increases the level of frameshifting. This noncognate type of mechanism has been proposed to explain the frameshifting seen with (pX174.",

In some instances this also causes frameshifting, but in the cases analyzed it is due to cognate reading of an overlapping triplet codon rather than to noncognate reading of an in-frame doublet codon (Weiss et al., 1988b) . There is currently no evidence that frameshifting promoted by amino acid starvation is utilized in vivo, but it is not very different from the Ty case where a combination of rare codon and minor tRNA is the stimulator for frameshifting at a slippery codon. Before the mechanism of Ty frameshifting was discovered, frameshifting promoted by tandem rare AGG arginine codons had been investigated in E. coli. AGG AGG placed in a gene expressed from an efficient promoter off a high copy number plasmid showed +l frameshifting at this sequence at an efficiency of up to 50% (Spanjaard and van Duin, 1988) . The shift occurs at the rare codons, but is dependent on extreme expression levels that may result in sequestration of the tRNAArs at the first of the two codons so that the tRNA may be limiting even for the first codon and more so for the second codon.",

However, some frameshift mutants are leaky at much higher levels than others, owing to the chance occurrence of nearby sequences prone to shiftiness (Fox and Weiss-Brummer, 1980; Atkins et al., 1983) . A more revealing study has examined the level of frameshifting in a long natural sequence that is free of stop codons in one or another of the alternative frames. The value obtained for an aggregate of over 90 codons in each alternative frame was, at most, a few percent. Interestingly, the level of shifting was not higher when frameshifting from the alternative frame to the wildtype 0 frame was monitored (Weiss et al., 1990b) . This result argues against a recently proposed (Trifonov, 1987) intrinsic framing mechanism within the coding sequence.",

The first mutant sequenced had a tRNA antioodon enlarged by 1 base and caused a 4 base translocation (see Riddle and Carbon, 1973) . However, several frameshift suppressors first isolated (Riyasaty and Atkins, 1968) have the normal 7 base anticodon loops (with their changes elsewhere in the tRNA) and yet cause both doublet and triplet reading (C'Mahony et al., 1989) . The tRNA mutants do not permit a simple answer to the question of frame maintenance (Tuohy et al., 1990; see Culbertson et al., 1990) . Perhaps the most telling experiment is that reported by Spirin (1987) , where under certain conditions tRNA was translocated in mRNA-free ribosomes, implicating, as expected, tRNA as a principal component of normal mRNA movement. However, as has been pinpointed by the suppressor studies, many other components of the translation apparatus, such as EF-TU and rRNA, influence frame maintenance.",

This poses a problem for considering the evolutionary origin of decoding, which necessarily took place before the advent of ribosomes with their numerous protein constituents. One possibility is that the original codonanticodon interaction involved 5 bp, which would confer the necessary stability. Woese (1970) and Crick et al. (1976) proposed a model for how this may happen without disastrous consequences in subsequently changing to triplet codon-anticodon pairing on ribosomes. In their reciprocating ratchet model, the tRNA paired with 5 codon bases but only a 3 base codon was decoded. A modified form of this model (Weiss, 1984) seemed an attractive explanation for several of the anomalous results obtained with the hungry codon and noncognate frameshifting studies described in the last section, but further work has shown that this model is unlikely (Bruce et al., 1986; Weiss et al., 1988b) . Since then, a different type of explanation for the dilemma of the origin of decoding has been advanced. It has been proposed that ribosomal RNA, without protein involvement, can stabilize codon-anticodon interaction by coaxial stacking of ribosomal RNA (Noller et al., 1986) . Such stacking could, by strengthening codon-anticodon interaction, also help in maintaining the reading frame.",

However, the variety of new examples of single-base frameshifting, as well as hopping and high level readthrough, makes it likely that nature has many tricks in store. The stimulatory effect of RNA-RNA interactions, often as stem-loop structures, in enhancing an unusual translation event by elongating ribosomes is an interesting and new feature. A tempting thought is that the diversity revealed is a reflection of the varied mechanisms used to cause pausing, but there is clearly much more involved.
