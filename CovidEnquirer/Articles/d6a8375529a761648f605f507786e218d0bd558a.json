This study was conducted to detect canine parvovirus antigen in dogs presented with diarrhoea to the Government Veterinary Clinic in Kumasi, Ghana. Materials and Methods: Faecal samples from 72 dogs presented with diarrhoea were tested for the presence of canine parvovirus antigen using commercially available rapid test kit (BIT\u00ae Rapid Colour Canine Parvovirus Ag Test Kit, BIOINDIST Co. Ltd, Korea) based on the principle of immunochromatography. Influence of breed, sex, age, vaccination history and the nature of diarrhoea were assessed. Data obtained was analysed with SPSS and subjected to the chi-square test. Significance was at \u03b1 0.05 Results: We found 61.11% tested positive (44/72) for CPV. Based on sex, 61.54% of males (20/33) and 60.61% of females tested positive (24/39). A total of 65.67% of samples from puppies below 6 months were positive. 56.25% of CPV vaccinated dogs and 70.83% of unvaccinated dogs were positive respectively. 69.05% of samples from haemorrhagic diarrhoeic dogs and 50.00% from non-haemorrhagic diarrhoeic dogs were positive of CPV.",

In Ghana, there is an increasing interest in keeping of dogs for various reasons hence it is necessary to have a knowledge of diseases and common conditions of dogs in the country. Diarrhoea in dogs is a common occurrence with a myriad of causes (Hubbard et al., 2007) which if not promptly and properly treated could have fatal outcome. Canine Parvovirus (CPV) is considered by many researchers as the leading cause of diarrhoea in dogs under 6 months old (Hackett and Lappin, 2003; Prittie, 2004 , Yesilbag et al., 2007 , Schulz et al., 2008 . Other clinical signs associated with CPV include acute vomiting, anorexia, haemorrhagic diarrhoea, dehydration and depression (Mitchell, 2015) . However, not all dogs with CPV enteritis present with bloody diarrhoea or leukopenia. Furthermore, other diseases such as enteropathogenic bacterial infection, parasitic infection, coronavirus or rotavirus infections are possible differentials to CPV (Nahat et al., 2015) . For the diagnosis of CPV, use of Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is highly recommended to be used on faecal samples with accompanying histopathology and immunohistochemistry on necropsy specimens, however, in a poor resource setting, a rapid CPV Antigen test kit may be employed especially in dogs with diarrhoea.",

This further strengthens the notion of most clinicians in Ghana that the local breeds of dogs and hybrids of exotic and local breeds (mongrels) are less susceptible to CPV infection. Though (Ogbu et al., 2016) , which showed a higher prevalence in dogs less than 6 months old at a higher risk of infection. The high prevalence of CPV infection in dogs less than 6 months old could be due to interference of maternal antibodies, improper vaccination protocol, lack of maternal immunity and poor efficiency of the immune system of puppies (Klingborg et al., 2002 , Umar et al., 2015 .",

This corresponds with the findings of Singh et al., (2013) who had a prevalence of 64% in unvaccinated dogs and 50% vaccinated dogs. There was no dependence of the vaccination status of the dogs on the susceptibility to CPV infection in this study. This was similar to work done by Miranda et al. (2015) who found vaccination status not to be a risk factor for CPV infection but was in variance with recent work done by Ogbu et al. (2016) , implying a dependence of vaccination status on the susceptibility to CPV infection validating the claim that vaccinated dogs are protected against CPV. The high percentage of positive cases in vaccinated dogs in this study could be as a result of irregular vaccination or the use of improperly maintained vaccines (Singh et al., 2013) . The prevailing energy crises (unstable electricity) in Ghana could account for improper storage of the vaccines (break in the cold chain), rendering them inefficacious. Decaro et al. (2007) in their study found out that most clinical cases of CPV occurring shortly after vaccination are not as a result of reversion to virulence of the MLVs in the vaccines but are rather related to infection with field strains. Worthy of note therefore is the possible strain difference in the vaccine virus and those circulating on the field, this possible difference calls for characterization of CPV field isolates in Ghana. Also previously infected pens without proper disinfection could therefore serve as source of infection to puppies even before vaccination begins.",

This particular finding is very important to note, particularly in Ghana where most clinicians rely on the presence of profuse foul-smelling watery bloody diarrhoea as the main clinical sign to tentatively diagnose CPV. This study showed that absence of bloody diarrhoea may not be often presumed to be CPV negative.",

(2015) in a retrospective study from 2000 to 2013 reported the highest cases of CPV in local breeds of dogs and mongrels. These reports necessitate an in-depth study of the role of local breeds of dogs in the epidemiology of CPV in West Africa. Regarding sex, the study showed that it has no influence on the occurrence of CPV infection in dogs. This agrees with similar findings by Singh et al., (2013), Gombac et al., (2008) and Ogbu et.al., (2016). However, it is in contrast to Houston et al., (1996) who found males to be more susceptible and Umar et al., (2015) reported females to be more susceptible. With regards to age, results from this study agree with work done in India (Biswas et al., 2006; Singh et al., 2013), Slovenia (Gombac et al., 2008) and Nigeria",
