Pre-school wheeze has been defined in epidemiological studies, according to its natural history. 2 Symptoms with onset before 3 years may be termed transient (resolved by 6 years) or persistent (continuing after 6 years). Late onset wheeze refers to symptoms which commence after 3 years and persist. Whilst this classification may help with understanding the mechanisms and natural history of wheezing illness in young children, it does not help with clinical management. A pragmatic clinical classification has therefore been proposed 1 which divides wheezing illness in pre-school children into episodic (viral) wheeze and multiple-trigger wheeze and we will use these terms in this review. Children with episodic (viral) wheeze are well between episodes. The most common viral triggers include rhinovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), coronavirus, human metapneumovirus, parainfluenza virus and adenovirus, 5 ",

A pragmatic clinical classification is episodic (viral) wheeze and multiple-trigger wheeze. Diagnostic difficulties include other conditions that give rise to noisy breathing which could be misinterpreted as wheeze. Most preschool children with wheeze do not need rigorous investigations. Primary prevention is not possible but avoidance of environmental tobacco smoke exposure should be strongly encouraged. Bronchodilators provide symptomatic relief in acute wheezy episodes but the evidence for using oral steroids is conflicting for children presenting to the Emergency Department [ED] . Parent initiated oral steroid courses cannot be recommended. High dose inhaled corticosteroids [ICS] used intermittently are effective in children with frequent episodes of moderately severe episodic (viral) wheeze or multiple-trigger wheeze, but this associated with short term effects on growth and cannot be recommended as a routine. Maintenance treatment with low to moderate continuous ICS in pure episodic (viral) wheeze is ineffective. Whilst low to moderate dose regular ICS work in multi-trigger wheeze, the medication does not modify the natural history of the condition. Even if there is a successful trial of treatment with ICS, a break in treatment should be given to see if the symptoms have resolved or continuous therapy is still required. Maintenance as well as intermittent Montelukast has a role in both episodic and multi trigger wheeze. Good multidisciplinary support and education is essential in managing this common condition.",

            "text": "routine clinical practice microbiological diagnostic studies are rarely performed. Young infants, with episodic (viral) wheeze may be difficult to distinguish from those with acute bronchiolitis, not least because the definition used for the clinical syndrome of bronchiolitis varies in different parts of the world. In the UK, Australia and parts of Europe bronchiolitis is defined as the presence of upper respiratory tract symptoms with coryza and cough preceding the abrupt onset of lower respiratory symptoms, with a variable degree of respiratory distress, feeding difficulties and hypoxia. On auscultation there are widespread crepitations. Wheeze may or may not be present. In most of North America and parts of Europe the term bronchiolitis is generally applied to all conditions involving expiratory wheeze and evidence of a respiratory viral infection such as rhinorrhoea and cough. 6 Whether or not the initial episode is classified as bronchiolitis is irrelevant but recurrent wheezing is common following initial infection with RSV and other viruses. 7, 8 In the case of RSV, most studies show that this has disappeared by the age of 11 yrs, and is not associated with an increased risk of atopy. 9 For rhinovirus, such long-term data are lacking. Episodic (viral) wheeze most commonly declines over time, disappearing by the age of 6 yrs, but can continue as episodic (viral) wheeze into school age, change into multiple-trigger wheeze or disappear at an older age. Other factors that influence the frequency and severity of episodes include the severity of the first episode, atopy, prematurity and exposure to tobacco smoke. 1 Viral infections are also one of the most important precipitants of multiple-trigger wheeze but factors such as passive smoking exposure, allergens and exercise are also important. 1 Children with multiple-trigger wheeze may therefore have symptoms which are not confined to discrete episodes (interval symptoms) such as nocturnal cough and exercise induced dyspnoea. The phenotypes defined in the task force report 1 are not exhaustive, and individual patients may not fit into the categories described. Also there can be an overlap between phenotypes and patients can move from one phenotype to the other. 10 ",

Parents' understanding of wheeze is often different from the definition used in epidemiological studies 11 and many parents are better at locating sounds rather than labelling them. 12 In a series of interviews, 13 parents were first asked an open question, asking how they would describe their child's noisy breathing, followed by specific questions asking them to select the medical terminology which they thought was the best description. Finally they were asked to select the sound closest to the noise made by their child, from a number of options. Over half of parents used the word wheeze initially but only one third were still using the term at the end of the interview -whereas the use of the word ''ruttle'' doubled. Ruttle (also known as ''rattle'') is lower in pitch with a rattling quality and lacking any musical features. Parents may be able to feel this noise as a vibration over the baby's back. Ruttle may be related to excessive secretions or to abnormal tone in the larger airways. 13 Wheeze and ruttle have quite distinct acoustic patterns when assessed objectively using acoustic analysis. 14 There is also a different response to ipratropium when assessed by computerised breath sounds analysis with a clear reduction in breath sounds intensity evident at 5 minutes in infants with ruttles but not until 20 minutes in those with wheeze, suggesting a different pathophysiology. 15 Even amongst health professionals there are inter observer variations in assessing wheeze using a stethoscope. 16 Furthermore, lung function 17 and bronchoscopic findings 18 are different in preschool children with parent reported wheeze as compared to doctor confirmed wheeze. Risk factors and outcomes for different respiratory sounds are also different when children are followed up to school age. 19 In view of these difficulties clinicians should undertake a detailed clinical assessment of each child, which does not place undue weight on any one symptom. 20 ",

It follows therefore that young children, who have smaller airways are much more likely to wheeze and that the prevalence of wheeze will fall off steeply as children get older and their airways radius increases. In young children, any inflammatory process, causing airway oedema, may narrow the airway, leading to wheeze. Children who have smaller airways, to start off with (for example infants of smoking mothers) are more vulnerable. 2 It follows that wheezing is a common symptom in young children and has a wide differential diagnosis. Table 1 lists a number of differential diagnoses and the appropriate investigations. Most children with a characteristic history and examination findings in keeping with episodic (viral) wheeze or multiple-trigger wheeze do not need further investigations. Skin prick testing may identify triggers in multiple-trigger wheeze and help with allergen avoidance. Children should be investigated further if there are features in the history suggestive of other pathology, some of which have been listed in Table 1 .",

[30] [31] [32] [33] These interventions achieve a reduction in house dust mite allergens in the child's immediate environment, but not a reduction in symptoms of wheeze. A Cochrane review has concluded that reduction of exposure to single allergens, such as house dust mite, does not reduce the prevalence of physician diagnosed ''asthma'' in the under fives. 34 However, reduction of exposure to multiple allergens in early life, including dietary and inhaled allergens, leads to a reduction in the prevalence of doctor diagnosed asthma in the under fives of around 30%. 34 Environmental allergen reduction (e.g. occlusive bedding and mattresses) is expensive and dietary exclusion is inconvenient and intrusive. Therefore these interventions are only justified young infants at very high risk of asthma and with highly motivated parents (number needed to treat 17 per case prevented). 34 Amongst the many reasons for encouraging women contemplating pregnancy to quit smoking, the strong association between pre-school wheeze and maternal smoking 2 is one of the most compelling.",

It is important to make the distinction because bronchodilators produce at best a small and short lived benefit when given to infants with bronchiolitis. 35 There are few randomised controlled trials of inhaled bronchodilators in pre-school children with wheeze. Conner randomised 29 children under 3 years to receive albuterol (salbutamol) or placebo for one week periods, during episodes of episodic (viral) wheeze, and showed an improvement in parent rated symptom score in the active group. 36 Kraemer 37 studied 36 wheezy infants, randomised to inhaled albuterol (salbutamol) or placebo and measured pulmonary function before and after the intervention. Significantly more infants in the active group showed improvement (as measured by thoracic gas volume and airway conductance). In contrast Chavasse et al. using a cross over design, randomised 80 wheezy infants under one year to salbutamol or placebo each administered three times daily for a period of 4 weeks. 38 They found that salbutamol was not superior to placebo in terms of symptom control or lung function. However, the trial had a high attrition rate (48 infants completed the study) and employed a regimen of regular bronchodilator use for prolonged periods, which is now rarely used in clinical practice.",

However the evidence for this approach is conflicting.

[45] [46] [47] [48] The review concludes that the use of oral steroids may allow more children to be discharged early (around 4 hours) and may lead to a shorter length of stay. The randomized controlled trials which have been restricted to the pre-school age group are summarized in Table 2 . A randomised controlled trial by Csonka et al., published after the Cochrane review, studied children aged 6-35 months, with wheeze or breathing difficulty and symptoms of a viral infection. They randomised 230 children to receive prednisolone (2 mg/kg/day for 3 days) or placebo. In the prednisolone group there was a shorter hospital stay (one day shorter), a shorter duration of symptoms and fewer children needing additional medication. 49 Panickar et al., studied almost 700 preschool children randomised to prednisolone or placebo on admission to hospital. 50 In contrast to the earlier studies, they found no significant difference between groups in the time until children were considered fit for discharge or in the time until actual discharge. The differences seen between the two recent, large trials are difficult to explain. In the Panickar study, children were enrolled only after they had failed to respond to an initial dose of salbutamol and so may have been a more severe group than the patients studied by Csonka (half of whom were discharged from the emergency department). The dose of prednisolone used by Csonka was higher than that used in the Panickar study, although in the latter study the per kilo dose varied with age.",

Daugbjerg et al., in a four arm study of children aged up to 18 months, reported significantly earlier discharge in the group receiving prednisolone vs. terbutaline alone. 51 In contrast, Fox et al. studied children aged 3-14 months in a randomised trial and found that prednisolone, given with oral salbutamol, produced no difference in treatment failures compared to placebo plus salbutamol. 52 Parents of children who suffer from episodic (viral) wheeze are frequently given oral prednisolone, to keep at home, and administer at the first sign of symptoms in an effort to truncate the attack. Is there any evidence to support this practice? Here the evidence is consistently negative. The effects of a single dose of oral prednisolone (2 mg/kg), administered by the parents of children aged 2-14 years at the first sign of wheezing, were studied by Grant et al. in a double blind, placebo controlled, crossover study. 53 Follow up was for 12 months -6months of prednisolone vs. 6months placebo. There was no benefit from prednisolone, in terms of number of outpatient visits, number of attacks or hospitalisations. In a large randomised controlled trial, Oommen and colleagues enrolled over 200 children aged 1-5 years during an episode of viral wheeze and advised the parents to administer study medication (prednisolone or placebo) during the next episode. 54 Study medication was administered for 5 days and the outcome was the mean 7 day symptom score (day and night time symptoms). The children were stratified for eosinophil priming. There was no difference between steroid and placebo groups and no effect seen of eosinophil priming. The practice of giving parents a supply of oral prednisolone to administer to their children at the first sign of a wheezing episode cannot therefore be justified. A recent survey of physicians and parents suggested that such advice is still commonly given by doctors (though not always recalled by parents). 55 ",

The episode-free days, number of exacerbations, or lung function are not significantly different in patients who have previously been randomised to fluticasone or placebo but have stopped treatment. 64 Fluticasone (around 200 mcg/day), increases symptom free days, whilst reducing exacerbations and use of reliever medication, when commenced in children with a high asthma predicative index at around 1 year of age. 65 However, in the same study, fluticasone did not prevent lung function decline or reduce airway reactivity at age 5 years. Furthermore fluticasone had a significant negative effect on the increase in height achieved by treated children (around 1 cm less than the placebo group at 2 years).",
