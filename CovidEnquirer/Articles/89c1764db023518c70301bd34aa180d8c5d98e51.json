            "text": "This study examines the electrocardiographic (ECG) changes following rabbit coronavirus (RbCV) infection. We have shown that infection with RbCV results in the development of myocarditis and congestive heart failure and that some survivors of RbCV infection go on to develop dilated cardiomyopathy in the chronic phase. Serial ECGs were recorded on 31 RbCV-infected rabbits. Measurements of heart rate; P-R interval; QRS duration; QTc interval; and P-, QRS-, and T-wave voltages were taken. The recordings were also examined for disturbances of conduction, rhythm, and repolarization. The acute and subacute phases were characterized by sinus tachycardia with depressed R-and T-wave voltages as well as disturbances of conduction, rhythm, and repolarization. In most animals in the chronic phase, the sinus rate returned to near-baseline values with resolution of the QRS voltage changes. The ECG changes observed during RbCV infection are similar to the spectrum of interval/segment abnormalities, rhythm disturbances, conduction defects, and myocardial pathology seen in human myocarditis, heart failure, and dilated cardiomyopathy. Because animals often died suddenly in the absence of severe clinical signs of congestive heart failure during the acute phase, RbCV infection may increase ventricular vulnerability, resulting in sudden cardiac death. RbCV infection may provide a rare opportunity to study sudden cardiac death in an animal model in which the ventricle is capable of supporting veutricular fibrillation, and invasive techniques monitoring cardiac function can be performed.",

Myocarditis is thought to develop in approximately 2 to 5% of patients following acute viral infection (3, 4) . The diagnosis of viral myocarditis is problematic due to the lack of definitive clinical signs and the paucity of sensitive diagnostic tests (1) . Diagnosis can be further complicated by the variable time course of progression of viral myocarditis, with clinically unapparent viral infection (even early in childhood), potentially resulting in dilated cardiomyopathy weeks, months, or even years later (5) . Rapidly accumulating evidence based on nucleic acid hybridization and other molecular techniques supports the hypothesis that cardiotropic viruses play an important role in the pathogenesis of myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . Difficulties inherent in diagnosing and studying the pathogenesis of viral myocarditis have prevented an accurate assessment of the prevalence of virus-induced heart disease in the human population.",

An appropriate animal model could provide useful clinical diagnostic markers for the disease and serve as a model for potential therapeutic intervention once the natural history of the infection is known. A good model should induce a reproducible spectrum of disease clinically similar to that observed in humans. Recently, our laboratory has described a model of viral myocarditis, congestive heart failure (CHF), and dilated cardiomyopathy in rabbits infected with rabbit coronavirus (RbCV). The RbCV model of myocarditis and dilated cardiomyopathy has been divided into acute, subacute, and chronic phases based on duration of survival after infection, clinical signs, and pathologic findings (11-I3) . Survivors of RbCV infection (chronic phase) have been further categorized into those exhibiting slight myocyte hypertrophy and those with moderate hypertrophy based on myocyte diameter measurements (13) . The mechanism of death after infection is unclear, especially early in infection.",

All rabbits were acclimated to the recording procedure by collecting baseline ECGs daily for 5 days prior to inlection. After infection, ECGs were recorded twice daily from day 3 through 12 and then at weekly intervals through day 30 on all animals surviving infection. Five chronically infected animals were observed through day 70 postinfection, and three surviving animals were observed through days 83, 97, 120, 130, 160, and 200 postinfection. ECGs were recorded on control rabbits through day 200 at the same intervals as infected animals. ECG parameters measured included heart rate; PR interval; QRS duration; QT interval; and P-, QRS-and T-wave voltages. All measurements were made in lead II by two investigators (LKA, BLY) blinded to the animal's experimental group or phase of infection, and a mean of four sinusconducted beats was reported. The QT interval was corrected (QTc) for heart rate using three previously described methods. To assess whether the formulae commonly used to correct QT interval in humans and other species might be appropriately applied to rabbits, we plotted QTc as calculated by (24) against the RR intervals from normal rabbits over the range of heart rates available (160 to 300 by increments of 10 beats/ min, 150 sets of RR vs. QTc intervals total; QTc = corrected QT interval, QT = QT interval, RR = RR interval, and HR = heart rate). In the rabbit, the various regression-corrected QTc values are more useful than the uncorrected data, although Bazett's formula is also of some value for correcting changes based on heart rate (25) . We subsequently utilized the correction formula resulting in the flattest slope (Van de Water) to assess the effect of infection on the QT interval, and verified the effect of infection by comparing QT intervals measured at similar heart rates before and after infection. In addition, ECG recordings were examined for disturbances of conduction, rhythm, and repolarization. All ECGs were interpreted by an investigator (BWK) not present at their recording and blinded to the animal's experimental group or phase of infection.",

The ECG picture of acute RbCV infection mimics the spectrum of ECG abnormalities that may accompany myocarditis in humans (29) (30) (31) and is in contrast to findings in mouse encephalomyocarditis virus, where 38% of the mice dying early in the course of infection had complete AV block associated with damage to the His bundle (15) .",

            "text": "In RbCV infection, degeneration and necrosis of myocytes as well as infiltration of the conduction system with mononuclear ceils correlated with the findings of low-grade 2 \u00b0 AV block, occasional ventricular premature complexes, and borderline prolongation of the QTc interval recorded in one rabbit prior to death. The appropriate method of correction of the QT interval for heart rate remains controversial. Regoeczi in 1961 measured the QT interval in 11 rabbits and described dependence of the QT interval in the rabbit by the regression formula QT = 1.005125 ~] HR (32) . Because of the methodology by which the ECGs were recorded (with the legs bound together in lateral recumbency) and the high heart rates recorded in the study, we elected not to use this specific regression formula because of probable excessive sympathetic tone during its acquisition. Hayes et al. (25) recently examined the relationship between QT and heart rate in rabbits by six different formulas, including linear, square root, and polynomial methods, concluding that various regression-corrected QT distributions were much better than the uncorrected data, with little difference among them. They judged Bazett's formula to be of \"some value.\" We choose to correct our data with Bazett's formula and Frederecia's formula, as well as the simple linear regression equation proposed by Van de Water et al. (23) . Use of the Van de Water linear equation disclosed QTc prolongation in a greater number of infected rabbits than the Bazett correction, and resulted in a flatter regression line than either the Bazett or the Fredericia correction. These data support previous findings that linear regression equations may be more useful for QT correction for heart rate than Bazett's formula (33) . In studies of encephalomyocarditis, coxsackievirus B 1, and western equine encephalitis virus animal models, arrhythmias and conduction defects almost always corresponded to a myocardial or conduction system injury (14, 15, 18) . Interestingly, most animals (7) dying in the acute phase of RbCV infection had generally small, focal myocardial lesions with right ventricular dilatation and eccentric hypertrophy. ECG findings in three of these animals included one or more of the following: right bundle branch block, occasional isolated ventricular premature complexes, decreased voltage of T waves, and STsegment depression, but no ECG abnormalities were recorded in the other four rabbits that died during the acute phase. It seems likely that the prevalence of arrhythmias was underestimated by the method of ECG recording employed in this study (brief, intermittent monitoring periods). Similar findings in the coxsackievirus B1 model are seen when only very small patchy myocardial lesions are present, resulting in what the investigators termed \"false negative\" recordings (14) . No ECG abnormalities were recorded in the influenza A model, in which cardiac lesions were mild and resolved quickly (19) . It is possible that lesions in the central nervous systems of the rabbits may have resulted in the arrhythmias seen, although a careful examination of the brain and spinal cord of RbCVinfected animals revealed no pathologic lesions in these tissues (11, 15, 34, 35) .",

Fibrosis, myocyte hypertrophy, and persistent myocarditis are associated with ventricular conduction delays in dilated cardiomyopathy (50), producing ECG changes similar to those observed in the chronic phase of RbCV infection. Both PR interval (I \u00b0 AV block) and QRS prolongation were accompanied by microscopic myocardial fibrosis as well as the presence of per-sistent myocarditis and myocyte hypertrophy. Despite the ECG and histopathologic abnormalities, rabbits in the chronic phase did not have clinical or gross pathologic signs of heart failure, possibly reminiscent of asymptomatic human patients with cardiomegaly and nonspecific ECG abnormalities in whom the possibility of previous acute viral myocarditis has been raised (38) .",

RbCV infection may provide a rare opportunity to study a reproducible model of sudden cardiac death associated with viral infection in a species large enough to easily monitor the heart rate, rhythm, and function. Continuous telemetered or ambulatory ECG monitoring will be needed to completely disclose the ECG changes associated with RbCVinduced sudden cardiac death, myocarditis, and dilated cardiomyopathy.",
