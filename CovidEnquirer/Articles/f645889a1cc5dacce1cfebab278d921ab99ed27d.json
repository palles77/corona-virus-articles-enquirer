There are several different classes of DUBs, one of them belongs to the ovarian tumor (OTU) domaincontaining family of proteins [2] , which comprises a group of cysteine proteases homologous to the OTU protein of Drosophila [3] . The OTU domain-containing protein family includes more than a hundred proteins from eukaryotes, bacteria, and viruses [4] . Recently, it was found that the aminoterminal region of the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, known as L protein, of nairoviruses, including Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV) and Dugbe virus, contains an OTU domain based in homology with other OTU domain-containing proteins (Figure 499.1) [5, 6] .",

These viruses are the etiological agents of several types of hemorrhagic fever syndromes with high mortality in regions of Asia, Europe, and Africa [7, 8] . Nairoviruses must defeat the antiviral and inflammatory effects of innate immune cytokines such as type I interferon and tumor necrosis factor alpha, in order to replicate in mammalian hosts. Both the induction and the effects of antiviral cytokines are controlled by Ub (Ubiquitin) and Ub-like (UBL) molecules. An interesting example is the interferon-stimulated gene 15 (ISG15) system, responsible for the conjugation of ISG15, a UBL molecule, onto target proteins, resulting in antiviral effects [9] .",

The OTU protease activity of CCHFV L is not necessary for its RNA polymerase activity [10] . Rather, the deconjugating activity of CCHFV L disarms antiviral innate processes regulated by ubiquitination and ISGylation, such as the induction of nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) and the ISG15 antiviral activity [6] . Recently, the expression of the OTU domain of CCHFV in E. coli by three independent groups has permitted the enzymatic characterization of this protease and also allowed the determination of its structure [11\u00c013].",
