Using polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and in situ hybridization, CBoVs were detected in intestine and/or lung samples of 8 dogs (9.6%). To reveal the genetic characteristics of CBoVs, partial or complete regions of CBoVs were sequenced. In phylogenetic trees, 8 CBoVs fell into three clusters. The CBoV strains 13D226-1, 13D250, and 14Q216 were closely related to the CBoV HK831F strain, and the CBoV 14D142 strain was related to the CBoV HK882F strain. Lastly, CBoV 13D003, 13D095, 14D193, and 14Q209 strains were related to CBoV Dis-023, Dis-040, and Dis-046 strains. Interestingly, no canine pathogens were found in dogs in which four CBoVs (13D003, 13D0095, 14D142, and 14D193 strains) were detected and three of them (13D003, 13D095, and 14D193 strains) had a unique deletion (18 nucleotides) in the VP2 gene. Further, the open reading frame 4 (ORF4) region was absent in these 4CBoVs, but found in the other strains, which indicates that the absence of the ORF4 region rather than a unique deletion may have an influence on the pathogenesis of CBoV in dogs.",

The subfamily Parvovirinae has been classified into eight genera: Amdoparvovirus, Aveparvovirus, Bocaparvovirus, Copiparvovirus, Dependoparvovirus, Erythroparvovirus, Protoparvovirus, and Tetraparvovirus (Bodewes et al., 2014) . The genus bocavirus within the subfamily Parvovirinae contains small, non-enveloped, autonomously replicating, single-stranded DNA viruses with an icosahedral capsid. Bocaviruses are unique among parvoviruses as they contain a third open reading frame (ORF) between the non-structural and structural-coding regions and the genome length of the viruses is approximately 5.4 kb. The genus was originally named according to the initial two members, bovine parvovirus (BPV) and minute virus of canines (MVC) (Binn et al., 1970; Mochizuki et al., 2002; Spahn et al., 1966; Storz et al., 1978) .",

Further, the ORF4 region, which was not found in other bocaviruses, was found in a recent study (Kapoor et al., 2012; Lau et al., 2012) . However, a clear relationship between CBoV and respiratory or intestinal disease in dogs is yet to be established, and most of the clinical and epidemiological features of CBoV infection are still unknown.

            "text": "The genome organization of the CBoV strains assessed in the present study was varied in their forms (Fig. 4) . Each protein of bocavirus strains is known to possess varying lengths depending on the host species (Lau et al., 2012) ; however, bocaviruses from canine had different genome organizations and protein lengths in the same species. Recent studies have reported that CBoV genomes posses a second exon encoding the C-terminal region of NS1 and conserved RNA-splicing signals near the end of NS1, which may generate a longer NS1 (Lau et al., 2012) . The predicted NS1 protein of CBoV 13D095 and 14D193 strains was relatively long, encoding 793 aa, compared with 648-674 aa in the other CBoV strains examined in the present study. This longer length supports the possibility that the putative second exon and conserved RNA-splicing signals may generate a longer NS1. In addition, the presence of the ORF4 region, immediately downstream of ORF1, was found. In CBoV strains, the ORF4 region was reported previously (Lau et al., 2012) . The ORF4 region was found in 13D226-1, 13D250, 14Q209, and 14Q216 strains, but was not found in 13D003, 13D095, 14D142, and 14D193 strains, which are expected pathogens that can cause disease by a single infection. Further, CBoVs were detected in lung tissues of 13D003, 13D095, 14D142, and 14D193 dogs and all these dogs showed clinical respiratory system symptoms and histologically. Therefore, the absence of the ORF4 region can be one of the possible factors that influence the pathogenesis of CBoV. The ORF4 region encodes a 144 aa protein, which overlaps with the predicted second exon of NS1, which indicates that the ORF4 region might also be generated by a second exon and conserved RNA-splicing signals near the end of NS1. However, the ORF4 region may be translated discontinuously from the NS1 region by, for example, alternative splicing or specific cleavage by a protease, unlike the cases that have a continuous and long NS1 region. The ORF4 region made this way may affect the function of NS1 proximally, and it may influence the pathogenicity of CBoV. An earlier study suggested that typical bocavirus NS1 protein might be functional during virus infection, such as transactivation (Chen et al., 2010) . Until recently, the unique deletion in the VP2 gene of CBoV was the only possible factor that had been proposed to determine pathogenicity (Kapoor et al., 2012) . However, this study indicates that the absence of the ORF4 region rather than the unique deletion may have an influence on the pathogenesis of CBoV in dog. Further studies, such as animal inoculation using CBoV-positive samples or CBoV isolate, are necessary to determine which factors, unique deletion, the ORF4 region, or both, actually influence the pathogenesis of CBoV.",
