            "text": "Predictive models for the spatial spread of infectious diseases has received much attention in recent years as tools for the management of infectious diseas outbreaks. Prominently, various versions of the so-called gravity model, borrowed from transportation theory, have been used. However, the original literature suggests that the model has some potential misspecifications inasmuch as it fails to capture higher-order interactions among population centers. The fields of economics, geography and network sciences holds alternative formulations for the spatial coupling within and among conurbations. These includes Stouffer's rank model, Fotheringham's competing destinations model and the radiation model of Simini et al. Since the spread of infectious disease reflects mobility through the filter of age-specific susceptibility and infectivity and since, moreover, disease may alter spatial behavior, it is essential to confront with epidemiological data on spread. To study their relative merit we, accordingly, fit variants of these models to the uniquely detailed dataset of prevaccination measles in the 954 cities and towns of England and Wales over the years 1944-65 and compare them using a consistent likelihood framework. We find that while the gravity model is a reasonable first approximation, both Stouffer's rank model, an extended version of the radiation model and the Fotheringham competing destinations model provide significantly better fits, Stouffer's model being the best. Through a new method of spatially disaggregated likelihoods we identify areas of relatively poorer fit, and show that it is indeed in densely-populated conurbations that higher order spatial interactions are most important. Our main conclusion is that it is premature to narrow in on a single class of models for predicting spatial spread of infectious disease. The supplemental materials contain all code for reproducing the results and applying the methods to other data sets.",

In 48 particular, the extent to which migrants are more or less likely to be susceptible to 49 infection, or actually infected, than the general population can be critically important, 50 as can the age profile of the migrant pool, due to pronounced age-specific patterns of 51 behavior, susceptibility, and infectiousness [5, 7, 15] .

            "text": "Accurately predicting the geographical spread of emerging, re-emerging, and recurrent 14 epidemics in an increasingly globalized world is a matter of international urgency in the 15 wake of outbreaks of emerging pathogens such as severe acute respiratory syndrome 16 (SARS), Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS), and ebola virus disease (EBVD) as 17 well as re-emerging and resurgent pathogens such as influenza subtype A-H1N1, 18 whooping cough, and measles. In response to this challenge, various 'spatial interaction' 19 models describing human movement as a function of population distribution have been 20 proposed. Some of these borrow from economics and human geography while others 21 adapt models from movement ecology and the physics of reaction and diffusion on 22 heterogenous landscapes. 23 In recent years, the field has seen the widespread adoption of a family of so-called 24 'gravity' models from transportation theory and human geography (see, e.g., [1, 2] ). In 25 its most common form, the gravity model posits that the migration flux between a pair 26 of cities is log-linearly dependent on their respective sizes and on their separating 27 distance. The application of this simple model to disease spread was originally proposed 28 by Murray and Cliff [3] , but over the last decade, many studies have used it to explain 29 historical, or predict future, disease spread in a range of infections including measles [4] , 30 influenza [5] [6] [7] , cholera [8] , and yellow fever [9] . While its application has yielded 31 insights, the geography literature has highlighted a prominent shortcoming of the 32 gravity model. In particular, these models ignore the potential for competitive or 33 synergistic interactions among population centers ( Fig. 1 ; [10, 11] ). Thus, for example, 34 movement between Boston and Washington DC is assumed to be unaffected by the 35 presence of the intervening city of New York. 36 As it happens, there are distinct families of models, arising from economics and 37 geography, that predict human movement patterns while allowing for higher-order 38 interactions among cities. In particular, Stouffer's [12] 'law of intervening opportunities' 39 posits that \"the number of persons going a given distance is directly proportional to the 40 number of opportunities at that distance and inversely proportional to the number of 41 intervening opportunities\". This idea has given rise to alternative models for human can feed back onto migration. Most obviously, disease symptoms can influence 53 movement behavior, as seen, for example, in the fact that a mild cold may induce 54 minimal changes in movement behavior but severe hemorrhagic fever or acute paralytic 55 disease will typically slow the movement of the infected hosts. These two considerations 56 do not preclude the utility of spatial interaction models in the infectious disease context; 57 they do, however, complicate their use and the importance of understanding 58 transmission relevant migration fluxes, which will be some sort of 'effective average' of 59 movement as filtered through such aforementioned complications.",

However, in view 63 of the challenges just noted, the ultimate test of the models is against data on the actual 64 spread of infection rather than bulk movement of people or cell phones. Bj\u00f8rnstad and 65 Grenfell [18] proposed that for acute immunizing infections, the spatio-temporal 66 patterns of fade-outs (i.e., local disease extinction) across metapopulations provide 67 valuable information on disease spread because these patterns reflect spatial 68 transmission unclouded by local transmission. In this paper, we extract information 69 from fade-out patterns and a consistent likelihood framework to compare and contrast 70 to a suite of models including (i) the gravity model [1] , (ii) Fotheringham's competing 71 destinations model [10] , (iii) Stouffer's rank model [12] , and (iv) the radiation model [14] . 72 . We confront these models weekly data on measles incidence from all 954 cities and 73 towns in England and Wales from 1944 to 1965 [4, 19] . Comparing fits and predictions, 74 we show that while the gravity model is a reasonable first approximation, Stouffer's 75 rank model, an extended version of the radiation model, and the competing destinations 76 model all provide significantly better fits, Stouffer's model performing the best.",

We use the spatially resolved weekly measles data across all 954 82 cities and towns of England and Wales from 1944, when notification was made 83 mandatory by the UK Registrar General (OPCS), until 1965, which saw subtle shifts in 84 political boundaries around London. Vaccination was not introduced in the UK until 85 1967, so that these data span a period where measles dynamics were unaffected by mass 86 immunization. The data set is complete except for a region-wide underreporting rate of 87 around 50% [22, 23] . Grenfell et al. [19] give a detailed description of the data; the 88 entire data set has been made available by Lau et al. [24] . 89 An important feature of the system is that, between 29% and 38% of the population 90 (c. 47M during this period) resided in a small number (13-28 depending on exact 91 definition) of communities above a critical community size (CCS) of c. 250-300k. Cities 92 larger than the CCS tend to sustain local chains of transmission. The remaining 60-70% 93 were distributed among the more than 900 communities smaller than the CCS where 94 local extinctions are more or less frequent (depending on population size and degree of 95 isolation) and, consequently, the rate of reintroduction of the pathogen via spatial 96 transmission is an important determinant of measles incidence. In ecological terms, the 97 prevaccination measles system represented an epidemic mainland-island metapopulation 98 (e.g., [25, 26] ). Our analysis exploits this fact, using the timing and spatial pattern and 99 timing of reintroductions to inform the parameters of each of the spatial interaction 100 models.",

Stouffer's 223 model and the competing destinations model have rarely been applied in this field. It is 224 therefore useful to use the gravity model fit as a baseline and explore how the 225 better-fitting models diverge from this baseline. Comparing matrices with half a million 226 entries is very difficult, so we amploy a new 'spatial likelihood contrast' (SLiC) method 227 with which to study the relative merit of the different spatial interaction models. The 228 idea is to disaggregate the overall hazard likelihoods by individual cities to study how 229 particular communities contribute to improved or diminished relative fit of each model. 230 To do so we normalize each location's contribution to the overall likelihood by the 231 number of data points each conurbation contributes to the likelihood (the accumulated 232 stretches of measles absence) and then map the model-model differences onto the 233 landscape (Fig. 3) . Inspection of Fig. 3 suggests that the poorer fit of the gravity model 234 vs. the Stouffer or competing destinations models is primarily in the urban northwest. 235 The supplement provides the full set of pairwise SLiC contrasts among all models. To 236 test whether the apparent patterns are statistically significant, we compute local 237 indicators of spatial association (LISA; [34] ) statistics for all population centers with 238 fewer than 50k inhabitants (Fig. 3A, B) . The main failure of the gravity model is in (e.g. [35, 36] ). In the case of epidemics playing out within a population center, models 254 closer to the mean field model (i.e., with uniform connectivity) often do remarkably well 255 (see [37] for a social network perspective on this). However, such models generally do 256 not capture regional spread of human infections because of the complicated patterns of 257 human movement (the third wave of the 2009 influenza pandemic across the USA, 258 perhaps, being an unusually diffusive counterexample [7] ) . To elucidate these patterns, 259 many empirical studies have been performed and a variety of abstractions have been 260 proposed. The task of choosing among these abstractions for help in help predicting 261 spread of infectious disease is complicated by the fact that (i) model formulations may 262 differ with respect to how well they actually reproduce aggregate mobility patterns, and 263 (ii) model fit may be shaped by the manner in which mobility is filtered by transmission 264 and behavior.",

We 300 have found both strong evidence of higher-order interactions among population centers, 301 and that candidate models differ significantly in their ability to capture the empirical 302 patterns. We hope our findings will help stimulate a systematic, data-driven discussion 303 of the relative merit of alternative predictive models for the probable path for spatial 304 spread of infectious disease. Clearly, the prospects are good for good for further 305 refinements and improved parameterizations. Spatial interaction models predict the flux of human movements between population centers (cities, towns, villages) as a function of the distribution of the population on the landscape. In this diagram, the relative magnitude of the fluxes from a focal town to other population centers are represented by the widths of the arrows. In the widely-employed gravity models (A), interactions among cities is strictly pairwise. Thus the addition of a new town (B) has no effect on the movement to other towns. In Fotheringham's competing destinations model (C), however, competition or synergy among nearby communities can reduce or augment fluxes. Stouffer's model of intervening opportunities and the radiation model (D) posit that movement from one city to another is diminished by the presence of opportunities in communities more proximal to the source city. author/funder.

The two variants of the gravity model fall in the middle of the pack; 194 both are significantly inferior to the Stouffer variant, extended radiation and competing 195 destinations models, as judged by the QAICs. The evidence, therefore, suggests strongly 196 that higher-order interactions influence the spatial spread of measles in the 197 prevaccination era. The \u03b4 parameter of the competing destination model is significantly 198 negative suggesting that the disease transportation network is dominated by 199 antagonistic spatial effects. The diffusion (\u03c4 1 = \u03c4 2 = 0) and mean-field (\u03c1 = 0) models 200 are special cases of several of the models, and these are clearly far inferior in accounting 201 for the data. The original single-parameter radiation model variants performed 202 relatively poorly. However, when augmented with an additional parameter to allow for 203 spatially-random background seeding ('extended radiation') placed second between204    Stouffer's rank model and Fotheringham's competing destinations model. This may not 205 be too surprising since the radiation model may in spirit be seen as a reincarnation of206    Stouffer's original argument.207As discussed by Jandarov et al.[27], there are identifiability issues associated with 208 the parameterizing the various spatial interaction models for infection spread. This is in 209 the from of ridges in the likelihood surfaces over model parameter spaces (see210 Supplement). Since each model amounts to a parameterization of the 954 \u00d7 954 matrix 211 of interaction among England and Wales' cities and towns, the likelihood ridges mean 212 that different parameter combinations may map on to similar spatial interaction213",

By challenging these models to emulate patterns in the uniquely rich275 spatiotemporal data on incidence of measles in English and Welsh cities and towns 276 between 1944 and 1965, we obtain intriguing new insights. Although the gravity model 277 can capture many broad spatiotemporal patterns [4], among the alternative 278 formulations, both Stouffer's [12] rank model and Fotheringham's [10] competing 279 destinations model and a background-augmented variant of Simini et al's [14] radiation 280 model outperformed it.
