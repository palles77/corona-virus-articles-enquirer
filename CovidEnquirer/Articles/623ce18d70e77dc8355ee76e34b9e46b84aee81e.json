            "text": "The respiratory tract is a very common site at which virus infections are initiated, usually as the result of airborne infections. 8 \u2022 33 \u2022 51 \u2022 52 \u2022 79 Droplets often originate from the respiratory tract and mouth of infected animals, but aerosols of urine, fecal material, and so on can infect the respiratory tract. Small droplets of less than 100 J.lm in diameter dry to droplet nuclei of I to 3 J.lm in diameter that remain suspended for long periods and easily gain entrance to bronchioli and alveoli. Viruses that resist desiccation remain viable in droplet nuclei for extended periods of time. Film and mucus afford some protection, but myxoviruses that are entrapped by receptor-like mucoproteins in mucus may be released by the peplomere enzyme neuraminidase, thereby allowing the virus to move on and finally become attached to a cell surface receptor. 96,113,ns,121,132 A number of viruses remain localized in the respiratory tract during the course of infection-some in the upper respiratory tract (rhinoviruses, some herpesviruses) and others in the lower respiratory tract (parainfluenza virus). 8 \u00b7 33 \u00b7 79 Although restricted to the respiratory tract, some viruses (influenze, for example) still cause generalized clinical signs such as fever, malaise, and muscle pains as a result of the products and inflammation associated with cell injury and destruction. 33 \u00b7 79 \u00b7 125 Many viruses become rapidly disseminated throughout the body after the primary infection of the respiratory tract (canine distemper virus is a good example). 8 \u2022 33 \u00b7 62 \u00b7 79 Usually there is no evidence of respiratory tract infection in the initial phase of these diseases and the animal usually is not infectious during this phase. The virus spreads via macrophages or lymphatics to regional lymph nodes before spreading further. 33 Generally, viruses initiate infection in epithelial cells of the respiratory tract, but some viruses achieve this by successfully infecting alveolar macrophages. 29 \u00b7 51 \u00b7 52 Infection of alveolar macrophages has important sequelae in the pathogenesis of viral respiratory tract disease. 51 \u00b7 52 \u00b7 104 Viral respiratory tract disease is a consequence of mechanical and biochemical injury to epithelial cells and alveolar macrophages, which can, in the most severe instances, result in secondary bacterial infection, pneumonia, and death. 17 \u00b7 29 \u00b7 40 \u00b7 51 \u00b7 52 \u00b7 104 \u00b7 117 Denuded respiratory tract, impaired mucociliary escalator, and the growth medium provided by exudate have been thought to enhance bacterial growth and colonization in the respiratory tract. However, these mechanisms may not be as important as originally thought. Injury to various biocidal mechanisms may be of greater consequence. 17 \u00b7 40 \u00b7 52 \u00b7 53 The alveolar macrophage, which is of critical importance in pulmonary resistance to bacterial colonization, may be affected in several ways either as direct consequence of virus replication in this cell or as a result of immunemediated cytotoxicity directed at the virus-infected macrophage. The latter is of particular consequence. It occurs late in the disease process when the immune response is initiated and when macrophages are ingesting virusladen cell debris. Not only is the number of alveolar macrophages reduced by viral infection, the function of the remaining cells may be impaired.17\u00b740\u00b751-53\u00b7124\u00b7126\u00b7130\u00b7131 Evidence suggests that such macrophages have suppressed immunologic (Fe) and nonimmunologic membrane receptor binding activity, Fe and nonspecific receptor-mediated phagocytic ingestion, phagosome-lysosome fusion, intracellular killing, and bacterial degradation. Some of these observations are the result of low levels of lysosomal enzymes and impaired biochemically mediated killing mechanisms. The alveolar macrophage may be impaired also because of hypoxia (it is an aerobic cell) and reduced surfactant levels. 40 \u00b7 124 The latter facilitates phagocytosis and is produced by type-II alveolar pneumocytes. Viral injury to the latter causes reduced production of surfactant in the lung.",

Infection of neurons that regulate peristaltic functions of the intestinal tract results in gastrointestinal disease and subsequent starvation. 116 Certain viruses such as rinderpest and African swine fever initiate submucosal infection without infecting epithelial cells and appear to have the capacity to pass through the epithelial barrier. 12 \u00b7m Some enteric viruses destroy the absorbtive columnar enterocytes on the tips of intestinal villi. 66 \u2022 74 \u2022 76 The upper portion of the intestine is first affected, but infection often spreads throughout the entire length of the intestine. The affected cells are desquamated and are replaced by cuboidal or even squamous cells, resulting in a dramatic atrophy of the villi. These target cells are important for the digestion of disaccharides and the absorption of macrosaccharides, and contribute to osmoregulation. Replacement of these cells occurs by m'igration of undifferentiated cells from the crypts, which are resistant to infection. However, the new villous tip cells are immature (contain thymidine kinase instead of sucrase, which is an enzyme profile similar to crypt cells) and result in a disturbed sodium transport system with a net extracellular fluid-to-lumen flux of sodium ions. Pathophysiologic changes include loss of water, sodium, chloride, bicarbonate, and potassium. Metabolism of glucose and lactate becomes severely disturbed, and the hypoglycemia, lactic acidosis, and an elevated efflux of potassium to hypovolumic plasma may lead to acute shock, heart failure, and death. The disease is more severe in neonates because of their milk diet and their dependence on readily available nutrients, and because replacement of sloughed epithelial cells is slower.",

This apparently occurs only with retroviruses, in which viral genetic material (provirus) is passed along as a cellular gene insert. 11 8. 1 35,14 1 Fetal infection is a prominent feature of several viruses. The outcome of the disease in the fetus depends on both virus and host factors. Some cytolytic viruses (for example, some herpesviruses and parvoviruses) uniformly result in fetal death, whereas other viruses (bluetongue virus, bovine virae diarrhea virus) may not. 33 \u2022 75 \u2022 78 \u2022 79 The nature of the disease in the fetus with some of the latter viruses may depend on the age of the fetus. 54 \u2022 75 This has been quite well documented with porcine parvovirus, bluetongue virus, and bovine viral diarrhea virus. The fetus is very vulnerable in the first third of pregnancy, and infection at this gestational age often results in death, but the fetus becomes progressively resistant to the effect of virus infection. Infection in the last third of pregnancy may not have serious consequences. However, frequently the fetus is partially resistant only during the middle third of pregnancy, and infection during this stage may result in various lesions. The latter may include malformations of the central nervous system such as cerebellar hypoplasia (feline panleukopenia, bovine viral diarrhea virus), hypomyelinization (bovine viral diarrhea virus, border disease), hydranencephaly (bluetongue virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus), porencephaly (bluetongue virus, bovine viral diarrhea virus), and hydrocephalus (parainfluenza virus, Japanese encephalitis virus). Porencephaly is a later manifestation than hydranencephaly in lamb fetuses infected with bluetongue virus. Stillbirths, weak neonates, and skeletal malformations may also occur. The progressive development of resistance in a fetus is correlated with the ontogeny of the immune response.",

Virus concentration may be amplified by replication in the regional lymph node; secondary spread of the virus in blood vessels, either free or, more likely, within carrier cells, to other tissues and organs in the body may occur. This secondary spread of the virus may be detected clinically as the second part of a biphasic fever. In many instances, the critical event in viral dissemination is the successful infection of phagocytes. 77 \u2022 80 The macrophage provides an important resistance mechanism of viral infections, and virulent viruses overcome their antiviral action. Impaired macrophage function markedly enhances the susceptibility of animals to viruses. Neonatal and corticosteroid-treated animals may be more susceptible for this reason.

Defective interfering particles have been demonstrated in most groups of viruses. They may mediate the cessation of a viral disease or may convert an acute, lytic disease to a persistent or chronic infection. Evidence indicates that the generation of defective interfering particles is controlled by host cells. Blockage of host DNA synthesis blocks generation of these particles when vesicular stomatitis virus free of defective interfering particles is used as the infecting virus. Defective interfering particles are produced in such cells if they are introduced with the parenteral virus. This evidence, together with evidence that the defective particles can alter the pathogenesis of viral infections, suggest that cells may have evolved mechanisms to protect themselves against viruses that successfully enter and penetrate.",

Viral cytotoxins have been described for poxviruses and adenoviruses (the penton capsid protein which reversibly modifies cell membranes from the outside). These cytotoxins may be either structural virion components (preformed) or induced during virus replication. Vaccinia cytotoxin has been identified as a surface tubular virion protein, whereas adenovirus cytotoxin is contained in the penton capsomere (the hexon capsomeres and fiber antigen inhibit macromolecular synthesis). The cytotoxic effect is markedly amplified in certain virus infections. T lymphocytes infected with dengue virus produce a cytotoxin that induces macrophages to produce a cytotoxic factor. 41 The exact mechanism by which various viruses affect cell metabolism and produce cytopathogenesis is not well known. However, it is known that poxviruses rapidly cut off host macromolecular synthesis, disaggregate host polysomes, interfere with processing of RNA, and redistribute lysosomal enzymes. One hypothesis is that the cytopathic and pathophysiologic changes may be due to a common cause-an alteration of the permeability of cell membranes. Leakiness of cell membranes occurs during infection with viruses from several virus families and usually precedes cytopathogenesis. Certain physiologic and clinical manifestations of virus infections can be attributed to membrane leakiness. These include excess respiratory tract mucus production with rhinovirus infections, loss of vision in corneal keratitis caused by herpesvirus infections, and excessive loss of water and electrolytes from the gastrointestinal tract during rotavirus infections.",

Certain viruses, such as herpesviruses and picornaviruses, are cytolytic, and disease results from direct destruction of tissue cells. In such instances of viral infection, the immune response can limit infection by destroying infected cells before progeny virus is assembled and released. Immune-mediated cytolysis can be deleterious to the host if it occurs late in the replication cycle of the virus, because then it serves only to release infectious virus. Noncytolytic viruses often do not cause direct cell injury, but immune responses may injure cells persistently infected with such viruses. A chronic inflammatory response may occur when such cells are not rapidly destroyed by immune processes. Such responses frequently are harmful to the host, especially if they interfere with the function of certain tissues and organs. Immunopathologic chronic inflammation usually involves antigen-sensitized T lymphocytes and/or antibody immune complexes that also activate complement with inflammatory consequences.

Serotonin is released from platelets when they react with immune complexes in the presence of complement. Other mechanisms of immune complex-mediated vascular permeability, such as kinins generated from activated Hageman factor, may also occur. Such platelets may contribute also to immune complex lesions by causing capillary thrombosis. Increased vascular permeability facilitates trapping of immune complexes, usually those of small size that develop in moderate antigen excess and in the walls of arterioles and capillaries. The trapped complexes activate complement locally and chemotactically attract polymorphonuclear cells. The circulating and fixed macrophages can degrade immune complexes, but the phlogogenic effect with anaphylotoxins (and the consequent release of vasoactive amines), neutrophil release of cathepsins and proteolytic basic proteins, and subsequent activation of Hageman factor (which leads to kinin and plasmin production) cause direct vessel wall injury. Arteritis, glomerulonephritis, arthritis, and choriomeningitis are common sequelae of immune complex disease. Immune complex disease is particularly prevalent in infections with noncytopathic viruses such as those that cause equine infectious anemia, aleutian disease of mink, and feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), but it may also cause some of the lesions of cytocidal viruses (for example, canine distemper virus).

Another virus-induced response of cells is that of immortalization due to oncogenic transformation. The mechanism by which various viruses transform cells depends on the nature of the virus. Oncogenic DNA viruses belong to several virus families, but oncogenic RNA viruses are members of the Retroviridae. Viral oncogenesis is a complex phenomenon and is an area receiving considerable attention by the scientific community. Transformed cells have altered morphology, changed behavior, and altered biochemistry. Often new membrane proteins and glycoproteins appear (for example, tumor-and/or virus-specific surface antigens and fetal antigens). Co-carcinogens have been identified that appear to promote transformation by certain viruses. Immunosuppression, a prominent feature of infection by several viruses, may be an indirect oncogenic mechanism of these viruses. It is still not clear which of the complex of changes induced in cells by viruses cause transformation and which are secondary events. At best, this review can only summarize the information on viral oncogenesis, and in order to achieve this, the subject material is greatly oversimplified. For a more detailed description of viral oncogenesis, please consult the reviews by Dues berg, 3\u00b0 Fenoglio and Lefkowitch, 34 Weiss, 135 Generally, DNA viruses replicate in cells and destroy the cell after progeny is produced. Cells that support virus replication in this manner are known as permissive cells. However, in some cells (nonpermissive cells), virus replication is not completed and progeny virions are not produced. On rare occasions, these nonpermissive cells become transformed. Defective virus may also, on rare occasions, transform both permissive and nonpermissive cells.",

Indeed, poxvirus-induced tumors consist of hyperplastic rather than trans-formed cells. Neither the cellular site of integration nor the location on virus DNA is unique or even specific, and integration seems to be the result of random \"illegitimate\" recombination between nonhomologous regions of the virus and the host. There is insufficient evidence that oncogenes are involved in DNA virus transformation. Although the entire viral DNA genome may be integrated in transformed cells, all transformed clones contain at least part of the early region of the viral genome. Various early functions seem to initiate and/or maintain the transformed phenotype, whereas late viral functions do not have a role in transformation. Thus, many DNA viruses mediate transformation through the action of some viral gene products, which generally are required for the virus to complete its normal cytolytic cycle. It is not known exactly how the transformation genes originate, but, unlike the retroviruses, there is little evidence that they are derived from normal host genes. However, there is some evidence for limited transcription from virus DNA sequences into flanking host sequences. In addition, recent transfection experiments with Burkitt's lymphoma cells resulted in the discovery of an oncogene of cellular origin. This oncogene is activated in Burkitt's lymphoma. Furthermore, one locus in the human genome has some homology with the gene-enhancer sequences of a human papovavirus, indicating that some of the oncogenic enhancer DNA sequences of DNA viruses can be evolutionarily related to host cell sequences. It appears also that DNA virus oncogenes can interact with retroviral (or cellular) oncogenes. A synergistic interaction of the \"ras\" oncogene and an adenoviral oncogene has been reported.",

The virogene-oncogene theory was proposed in 1969 by Heubner. Temin introduced in 1972 the protovirus concept for viral oncogenesis and the existence of endogenous oncoviruses. However, considerable evidence now exists to support the cellular oncogene theory, which contains some of the concepts of the two hypotheses ofTemin and Heubner. An oversimplified explanation of this hypothesis is that most cells contain the so-called oncogenes, a highly conserved host gene with a useful function. This gene product seems to be a protein kinase catalyzing the phosphorylation of certain proteins and has been implicated in regulating growth of normal cells by activity on cell surfaces. This unique protein kinase differs from the normal cell kinases in that it phosphorylates tyrosine instead of serine or threonine. A large number of viral oncogenes and cellular equivalents have now been identified. They are distinguished by the prefix \"c\" for cell oncogenes and \"v\" for viral oncogenes. Viral oncogenes are probably of cellular origin and may be merely a passenger acquired by sarcoma viruses from the host DNA. Viruses with oncogenes are directly oncogenic, whereas oncoviruses without oncogenes are indirectly tumorogenic because they interfere with a cellular oncogene at or near the site of provirus integration. Two hypotheses have been proposed to explain the mechanism of oncogene transformation; the mutational hypothesis and the dosage hypothesis. The former requires that the viral oncogene differs, as a result of mutation, from the parent cellular oncogene and, upon expression of the gene, neoplastic transformation occurs instead of its normal regulatory function. Furthermore, in the instance of nononcogene-bearing leukemia viruses, a similar mutation occurs in cellular oncogenes during integration. Proto-oncogene (inactive) activation by one-point mutation has been best documented in the family of \"ras\" oncogenes. The dosage (or amplification) hypothesis requires that excessive production of the gene product occurs after infection with a sarcoma virus and formation of one or multiple copies of the provirus in the cell. Nononcogene-bearing leukemia viruses probably stimulate cellular oncogene activity because some are inserted as proviruses in the immediate vicinity of this gene. Recent evidence suggests that the latter theory may be accurate. Normal cellular control prevents the oncogene's transforming capacity. However, when an oncovirus includes an oncogene in its genome, the oncogene is removed from its controlled environment, resulting in increased production during viral replication. Enhanced activity of the oncogene probably is due to the viral promoter. An unexpressed oncogene (proto-oncogene), when introduced with its normal promoter into host cells, does not cause transformation; however, transformation occurs when the viral promoter accompanies the cellular oncogene in transfection experiments. The activation of normal cell oncogenes by leukemia viruses is probably due to the viral promoter inserted in the vicinity of these genes. The delayed tumor induction of leukemia viruses may be due to random integration of the viral genome. Thus, the location of the viral promoter at the appropriate site for affecting the cellular oncogene is an inefficient event. The appropriate point of integration of the promoter into the cellular DNA varies, and evidence indicates that the site can be some distance from the target oncogene.",
