A mechanistic understanding of 25 the impact of bats' virus hosting capacities, including uniquely constitutive immune pathways, 26 on cellular-scale viral dynamics is needed to elucidate zoonotic emergence. We carried out virus 27 infectivity assays on bat cell lines expressing induced and constitutive immune phenotypes, then 28 developed a theoretical model of our in vitro system, which we fit to empirical data. Best fit 29 models recapitulated expected immune phenotypes for representative cell lines, supporting 30 robust antiviral defenses in bat cells that correlated with higher estimates for within-host viral 31 propagation rates. In general, heightened immune responses limit pathogen-induced cellular 32 morbidity, which can facilitate the establishment of rapidly-propagating persistent infections 33 within-host. Rapidly-replicating viruses that have evolved with bat immune systems will likely 34 cause enhanced virulence following emergence into secondary hosts with immune systems that 35 diverge from those unique to bats. 36 37 38 39 40 41 42 43 44 45 46 .

Typically, the presence of viral RNA or DNA in the cytoplasm of mammalian cells will 63 induce secretion of type I interferon proteins (IFN-and IFN-), which promote expression and 64 translation of interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) in neighboring cells and render them effectively 65 antiviral (Stetson and Medzhitov 2006). In some bat cells, the transcriptomic blueprints for this 66 IFN response are expressed constitutively, even in the absence of stimulation by viral RNA or 67 DNA (Zhou et al. 2016). In non-flying mammals, constitutive IFN expression would likely elicit 68 widespread inflammation and concomitant immunopathology upon viral infection, but bats 69",

Pathogens can invade a host tissue culture when 0 > 1. Rapid rates of constitutive antiviral 208 acquisition ( ) will drive 0 < 1: tissue cultures with highly constitutive antiviral immunity will 209 be therefore resistant to virus invasion from the outset. Since, by definition, induced immunity is 210 stimulated following initial virus invasion, the rate of induced antiviral acquisition ( ) is not 211 incorporated into the equation for 0 ; while induced immune processes can control virus after 212 initial invasion, they cannot prevent it from occurring to begin with. In cases of fully induced or 213 absent immunity ( = 0), the 0 equation thus reduces to a form typical of the classic SEIR 214 model: 215 12 know a constitutively antiviral cell-receptor incompatibility to be at play). Because constitutive 251 immune assumptions can prohibit pathogen invasion ( 0 < 1), model fits to this time series 252 under constitutive assumptions were handicapped by overestimations of , which prohibited 253 pathogen invasion. Only by incorporating an exceedingly rapid rate of induced antiviral 254 acquisition could the model guarantee that initial infection would be permitted and then rapidly 255 controlled. 256 257",

In reality, we know that NPC1 receptor incompatibilities make PaKiT01 cell lines 328 constitutively refractory to rVSV-MARV infection (Ng and Chandran 2018) and that PaKiT01 329 cells also constitutively express the antiviral cytokine, IFN-.

By allowing the extent of constitutive immunity to vary with parameter values, we maintain consistency with the published literature, which suggests that, in constitutively antiviral bat cell lines (i.e. PaKiT01), some interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are perpetually expressed, like their IFN-< precursor, while others still require induction upon infection.

Baseline cell counts were also different across our three cell lines, which varied substantially in natural size. To correct for this variation, we opted to model the proportion of infectious cell spaces per hour for each well, rather than rely on the raw count data. To this end, we collected the maximum number of live cells counted in susceptible control wells at timepoint 0 and set this count to a rough measure of 100% well occupancy for the cell line in question. Using this method, maximum cell counts were, respectively, 103712, 82308, and 92233 for Vero, RoNi/7.1, and PaKiT01 cell lines, reflecting innate variation in cell sizes. We then converted all cell counts tabulated via our image processing code across the infectious time trials into proportions by dividing the counts by the total number of possible cell spaces for the cell line in question. Though clearly subject to some error, these methods nonetheless maintained internal consistency in our counting methods and generated reasonable time series. We originally experimented with directly tabulating the proportion of infected versus uninfected space in our binary images; however, this approach impaired our ability to generalize across more or less densely seeded trials, as well as trials on cell lines of disparate sizes. As such, we adopted the count-toproportion methods described here.",

We fit a separate GAM model to each unique cell -virus -MOI combination, incorporating a random effect of well ID (such that each trial was modeled individually), and we fixed the smoothing parameter at k=7 for all trials, as recommended by the package author (Wood 2001).

As before, we set time elapsed post infection as the predictor for the Hoechst stain data and produced a unique estimate of the proportion of uninfected cells per hour across the duration of the longest-observed trial. No random effects were included in this model, and the resulting time series were used to estimate natural mortality rates for each cell line, when fit to control well data depicting natural susceptible decline ( Figure  1-figure supplement 7) .",

In most non-Chiropteran mammals, henipaviruses, filoviruses, and 51 coronaviruses induce substantial morbidity and mortality, display short durations of infection, 52 and elicit robust, long-term immunity in hosts surviving infection (Nicholls et al. 2003; Hooper 53 et al. 2001; Mahanty and Bray 2004). Bats, by contrast, demonstrate no obvious disease 54 symptoms upon infection with pathogens that are highly virulent in non-volant mammals 55 (Schountz et al. 2017) but may, instead, support viruses as long-term persistent infections, rather 56 than transient, immunizing pathologies (Plowright et al. 2016). 57 8 infectious, capturing the 'eclipse phase' of viral integration into a host cell which precedes viral 161 replication.

In systems 166 permitting constitutive immunity, a second rate of cellular acquisition of antiviral status ( ) 167 additionally scaled with the global proportion of susceptible cells in the model.

In immune capable time 371 series, spatial antiviral cells acted as 'refugia' which protected live cells from infection as each 372 initial epidemic wave 'washed' across a cell monolayer. Eventual birth of new susceptibles from 373 these living refugia allowed for sustained epidemic transmission in cases where some infectious 374 cells persisted at later timepoints in simulation (Videos 1-3; reservoirs for several important emerging zoonoses but appear not to experience 378 disease from otherwise virulent viral pathogens. Though the molecular biological literature has 379 made great progress in elucidating the mechanisms by which bats tolerate viral infections (Zhou 380 et al. 2016; Ahn et al. 2019; Xie et al. 2018; Pavlovich et al. 2018; Zhang et al. 2013), the impact 381 of unique bat immunity on virus dynamics within-host has not been well-elucidated. We used an 382 innovative combination of in vitro experimentation and within-host modeling to explore the 383 impact of unique bat immunity on virus dynamics. Critically, we found that bat cell lines 384 demonstrated a signature of enhanced interferon-mediated immune response, of either 385 constitutive or induced form, which allowed for establishment of rapid within-host, cell-to-cell 386 rates ( ). These results were supported by both data-independent bifurcation 387 analysis of our mean field theoretical model, as well as fitting of this model to viral infection 388 time series established in bat cell culture. Additionally, we demonstrated that the antiviral state 389 induced by the interferon pathway protects live cells from mortality in tissue culture, resulting in 390 in vitro epidemics of extended duration that enhance that probability of establishing a long-term 391 persistent infection. Our findings suggest that viruses evolved in bat reservoirs possessing 392 enhanced IFN capabilities could achieve more rapid within-host transmission rates without 393 causing pathology to their hosts. Such rapidly-reproducing viruses would likely generate extreme 394 virulence upon spillover to hosts lacking similar immune capacities to bats. 395 To achieve these results, we first developed a novel, within-host, theoretical model 396 elucidating the effects of unique bat immunity, then undertook bifurcation analysis of the 397 model's equilibrium properties under immune absent, induced, and constitutive assumptions. We 398 considered a cell line to be constitutively immune if possessing any number of antiviral cells at 399 disease free equilibrium but allowed the extent of constitutive immunity to vary across the 400 parameter range for , the constitutive rate of antiviral acquisition. In deriving the equation for 401 0 , the basic reproduction number, which defines threshold conditions for virus invasion of a 402 tissue ( 0 > 1), we demonstrated how the invasion threshold is elevated at high values of 403 constitutive antiviral acquisition, . Constitutive immune processes can thus prohibit pathogen 404 invasion, while induced responses, by definition, can only control infections post-hoc. Once 405 thresholds for pathogen invasion have been met, assumptions of constitutive immunity will limit 406 the cellular mortality (virulence) incurred at high transmission rates. Regardless of mechanism 407 (induced or constitutive), interferon-stimulated antiviral cells appear to play a key role our model to in vitro data supported expected immune phenotypes for different 411 bat cell lines as described in the literature. Simple target cell models that ignore the effects of 412 immunity best recapitulated infectious time series derived from IFN-deficient Vero cells, while 413 models assuming induced immune processes most accurately reproduced trials derived from 414 RoNi/7.1 (Rousettus aegyptiacus) cells, which possesses a standard virus-induced IFN-response. 415 In most cases, models assuming constitutive immune processes best recreated virus epidemics 416 produced on PaKiT01 (Pteropus alecto) cells, which are known to constitutively express the 417 antiviral cytokine, IFN-(Zhou et al. 2016). Model support for induced immune assumptions in 418 fits to rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01cells suggests that the constitutive IFN-expression 419 characteristic of P. alecto cells may represent more of a constitutive immune priming process 420 than a perpetual, functional, antiviral defense. Results from mean field model fitting were 421 additionally confirmed in spatially explicit stochastic simulations of each time series. 422 As previously demonstrated in within-host models for HIV (Coffin 1995; Perelson et al. 423 1996; Nowak et al. 1995; Bonhoeffer et al. 1997; Ho et al. 1995), assumptions of simple target-424 cell depletion can often provide satisfactory approximations of viral dynamics, especially those 425 reproduced in simple in vitro systems. Critically, our model fitting emphasizes the need for 426 incorporation of top-down effects of immune control in order to accurately reproduce infectious 427 time series derived from bat cell tissue cultures, especially those resulting from the robustly 428 antiviral PaKiT01 P. alecto cell line. These findings indicate that enhanced IFN-mediated 429 immune pathways in bat reservoirs may promote elevated within-host virus replication rates 430 prior to cross-species emergence. We nonetheless acknowledge the limitations imposed by in 431 experiments in tissue culture, especially involving recombinant viruses and immortalized 432 cell lines. Future work should extend these cell culture studies to include measurements of 433 multiple state variables (i.e. antiviral cells) to enhance epidemiological inference. 434 The continued recurrence of Ebola epidemics across central Africa highlights the 435 importance of understanding bats' roles as reservoirs for virulent zoonotic disease. The past 436 decade has born witness to emerging consensus regarding the unique pathways by which bats 437 resist and tolerate highly virulent infections (Brook and Dobson 2015; Xie et al. 2018; Zhang et 438 al. 2013; Ahn et al. 2019; Zhou et al. 2016; Ng et al. 2015; Pavlovich et al. 2018). Nonetheless, 439 an understanding of the mechanisms by which bats support endemic pathogens at the population 440 level, or promote the evolution of virulent pathogens at the individual level, remains elusive. 441 Endemic maintenance of infection is a defining characteristic of a pathogen reservoir (Haydon et 442 al. 2002), and bats appear to merit such a title, supporting long-term persistence of highly 443 transmissible viral infections in isolated island populations well below expected critical 444 community sizes (Peel et al. 2012). Researchers debate the relative influence of population-level 445 and within-host mechanisms which might explain these trends (Plowright et al. 2016), but 446 increasingly, field data are difficult to reconcile without acknowledgement of a role for persistent 447 infections (Peel et al. 2018; Brook et al. 2019).We present general methods to study cross-scale 448 viral dynamics, which suggest that within-host persistence is supported by robust antiviral 449 responses characteristic of bat immune processes. Viruses which evolve rapid replication rates 450 under these robust antiviral defenses may pose the greatest hazard for cross-species pathogen 451 emergence into spillover hosts with immune systems that differ from those unique to bats.",

Viruses were selected to represent a 488 broad range of anticipated antiviral responses from host cells, based on a range of past 489 evolutionary histories between the virus glycoprotein mediating cell entry and the host cell's 490 entry receptor. These interactions ranged from the total absence of evolutionary history in the 491 case of rVSV-G infections on all cell lines to a known receptor-level cell entry incompatibility in 492 the case of rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cell lines. 493 Phenotypes via qPCR of IFN Genes. 499 Previously published work indicates that immortalized kidney cell lines of Rousettus 500 aegyptiacus (RoNi/7.1) and Pteropus alecto (PaKiT01) exhibit different innate antiviral immune 501 phenotypes through, respectively, induced (Biesold et al. 2011; Pavlovich et al. 2018; K\u00fchl et al. 502 2011; Arnold et al. 2018) and constitutive (Zhou et al. 2016) expression of type I interferon 503 genes.

Following 561 20 minutes, and re-incubated in their original humidified 37\u02daC, 5% CO 2 environment. 564After application of the overlay, plates were monitored periodically using an inverted 565 fluorescence microscope until the first signs of GFP expression were witnessed (~6-9.5 hours 566 post-infection, depending on the cell line and virus under investigation). From that time forward, 567 a square subset of the center of each well (comprised of either 64-or 36-subframes and 568 corresponding to roughly 60 and 40% of the entire well space) was imaged periodically, using a 569 CellInsight CX5 High Content Screening (HCS) Platform with a 4X air objective 570 (ThermoFisher, Inc., Waltham, MA). Microscope settings were held standard across all trials, 571 with exposure time fixed at 0.0006 sec for each image. One color channel was imaged, such that 572 images produced show GFP-expressing cells in white and non-GFP-expressing cells in black 573 (Figure 1-figure supplement 1). 574 Wells were photographed in rotation, as frequently as possible, from the onset of GFP 575 expression until the time that the majority of cells in the well were surmised to be dead, GFP 576 expression could no longer be detected, or early termination was desired to permit Hoechst 577 staining. 578 In the case of PaKiT01 cells infected with rVSV-EBOV, where an apparently persistent 579 infection established, the assay was terminated after 200+ hours (8+ days) of continuous 580 observation. Upon termination of all trials, cells were fixed in formaldehyde (4% for 15 min), 581 incubated with Hoechst stain (0.0005% for 15 min) (ThermoFisher, Inc., Waltham, MA), then 582 imaged at 4X on the CellInsight CX5 High Content Screening (HCS) Platform. colors cellular DNA, and viral infection is thought to interfere with the 588 clarity of the stain (Dembowski and DeLuca, 2015). As such, infection termination, cell fixation, 589 and Hoechst staining enables generation of a rough time series of uninfectious live cells (i.e. 590 susceptible + antiviral cells) to complement the images which produced time series of 591 proportions infectious. Due to uncertainty over the exact epidemic state of Hoechst-stained cells 592 (i.e. exposed but not yet infectious cells may still stain), we elected to fit our models only to the 593 infectious time series derived from GFP-expressing images and used Hoechst stain images as a 594 post hoc visual check on our fit only (Figure from the time series above were processed into binary ('infectious' vs. 598 'non-infectious' or, for Hoechst-stained images, 'live' vs. 'dead') form using the EBImage 599 package (Pau et al. 2010) in R version 3.6 for MacIntosh, after methods further detailed in 600 Supplementary File 7. Binary images were then further processed into time series of infectious 601 or, for Hoechst-stained images, live cells using a series of cell counting scripts. Because of 602 logistical constraints (i.e. many plates of simultaneously running infection trials and only one 603 available imaging microscope), the time course of imaging across the duration of each trial was 604 quite variable. As such, we fitted a series of statistical models to our processed image data to 605 reconstruct reliable values of the infectious proportion of each well per hour for each distinct 606 , image processing and counting code, and resulting time series data are freely 610 available for download at the following FigShare repository: the expression for 0 , the basic pathogen reproductive number in vitro, we 616 used Next Generation Matrix (NGM) techniques (Diekmann, Heesterbeek, and Metz 1990; 617 Heffernan, Smith, and Wahl 2005), employing Wolfram Mathematica (version 11.2) as an 618 analytical tool. 0 describes the number of new infections generated by an existing infection in a 619 completely susceptible host population; a pathogen will invade a population when 0 > 620 1 (Supplementary File 2). We then analyzed stability properties of the system, exploring 621 dynamics across a range of parameter spaces, using MatCont (version 2.2) (Dhooge et al. rate, b, and natural mortality rate, , balance to yield a population-level growth 626 rate, such that it is impossible to estimate both b and simultaneously from total population size 627 data alone.

We optimized parameters for MOI = 0.001 and 0.0001 simultaneously to 644 leverage statistical power across the two datasets, estimating a different transmission rate, , for 645 trials run at each infectious dose but, where applicable, estimating the same rates of and 646 across the two time series. We used the differential equation solver lsoda() in the R package 647 deSolve (Soetaert, Petzoldt, and Setzer 2010) to obtain numerical solutions for the mean field 648 model and carried out minimization using the 'Nelder-Mead' algorithm of the optim() function 649 in base R.

Finally, we compared fits across 656 each cell line-virus-MOI combination via AIC. In calculating AIC, the number of fitted 657 parameters in each model (k) varied across the immune phenotypes, with one parameter ( ) 658 estimated for absent immune assumptions, two ( and ) for induced immune assumptions, and 659 three ( , , and ) for constitutive immune assumptions.

We constructed our spatial model in C++ 667 implemented in R using the packages Rcpp and RcppArmadillo (Eddelbuettel and Francois 668 2011; Eddelbuettel and Sanderson 2017). Following Nagai and Honda (2001) and Howat et al. 669 (2006), we modeled this system on a two-dimensional hexagonal lattice, using a ten-minute 670 epidemic timestep for cell state transitions. At the initialization of each simulation, we randomly 671 assigned a duration of natural lifespan, incubation period, infectivity period, and time from 672 antiviral to susceptible status to all cells in a theoretical monolayer. Parameter durations were 673 drawn from a normal distribution centered at the inverse of the respective fixed rates of , c, as reported with our mean field model. Transitions involving the induced ( ) and 675 constitutive ( ) rates of antiviral acquisition were governed probabilistically and adjusted 676 dynamically at each timestep based on the global environment. As such, we fixed these 677 parameters at the same values estimated in the mean field model, and multiplied both and by 678 the global proportion of, respectively, exposed and susceptible cells at a given timestep. 679 In contrast to antiviral acquisition rates, transitions involving the birth rate (b) and the 680 transmission rate ( ) occurred probabilistically based on each cell's local environment. The birth 681 rate, b, was multiplied by the proportion of susceptible cells within a six-neighbor circumference 682 of a focal dead cell, while was multiplied by the proportion of infectious cells within a thirty-683 six neighbor vicinity of a focal susceptible cell, thus allowing viral transmission to extend 684 beyond the immediate nearest-neighbor boundaries of an infectious cell. To compensate for 685 higher thresholds to cellular persistence and virus invasion which occur under local spatial 686 conditions (Webb, Keeling, and Boots 2007), we increased the birth rate, b, and the cell-to-cell 687 transmission rate, , respectively, to six and ten times the values used in the mean field model 688 (Supplementary File 4). We derived these increases based on the assumption that births took 689 place exclusively based on pairwise nearest-neighbor interactions (the six immediately adjacent 690 cells to a focal dead cell), while viral transmission was locally concentrated but included a small 691 (7.5%) global contribution, representing the thirty-six cell surrounding vicinity of a focal 692 susceptible. We justify these increases and derive their origins further in Supplementary File 5. 693 We simulated ten stochastic spatial time series for all cell-virus combinations under all 694 three immune assumptions at a population size of 10,000 cells and compared model output with 695 data in Figure 5-figure supplement 3.

            "text": ". As in RoNi/7.1 cells, 294PaKiT01 parameter fits localized in the region corresponding to endemic equilibrium for the 295 deterministic theoretical model. Because constitutive immune processes can actually prohibit 296 14 initial pathogen invasion, constitutive immune fits to rVSV-MARV infections on PaKiT01 cell 297 lines consistently localized at or below the Branch point threshold for virus invasion ( 0 = 1). 298During model fitting for optimization of , any parameter tests of values producing 0 < 1 299 resulted in no infection and, consequently, produced an exceedingly poor fit to infectious time 300 series data. In all model fits assuming constitutive immunity, across all cell lines, parameter 301 estimates for and traded off, with one parameter optimized at values approximating zero, 302 such that the immune response was modeled as almost entirely induced or entirely constitutive 303(Table 1; Supplementary File 4). For RoNi/7.1 cells, even when constitutive immunity was 304 allowed, the immune response was estimated as almost entirely induced, while for rVSV-G and 305 rVSV-EBOV fits on PaKiT01 cells, the immune response optimized as almost entirely 306 constitutive. For rVSV-MARV on PaKiT01 cells, however, estimation of was high under all 307 assumptions, such that any additional antiviral contributions from prohibited virus from 308 invading at all. The induced immune model thus produced a more parsimonious recapitulation of 309 these data because virus invasion was always permitted, then rapidly controlled. 310Antiviral cells safeguard live cells against rapid cell mortality to elongate epidemic 312 duration in vitro. 313In order to compare the relative contributions of each cell line's disparate immune 314 processes to epidemic dynamics, we next used our mean field parameter estimates to calculate 315 the initial 'antiviral rate'-the initial accumulation rate of antiviral cells upon virus invasion for 316 each cell-virus-MOI combination-based on the following equation: 317where P E was calculated from the initial infectious dose (MOI) of each infection experiment and 319 P S was estimated at disease free equilibrium: 320Because and both contribute to this initial antiviral rate, induced and constitutive immune 323 assumptions are capable of yielding equally rapid rates, depending on parameter fits. Indeed, 324 under fully induced immune assumptions, the induced antiviral acquisition rate ( ) estimated for 325 rVSV-MARV infection on PaKiT01 cells was so high that the initial antiviral rate exceeded even 326 that estimated under constitutive assumptions for this cell-virus combination (Supplementary 327",

            "text": "Because spatial configurations elevate thresholds for pathogen invasion, as well for host cell persistence (Webb, Keeling, and Boots 2007), we were forced to elevate both birth rates (b) and transmission rates (!) above those used in the mean field model to apply to the spatial context. We here justify our chosen values for parameter increase:In Webb, Keeling, and Boots 2007, the authors approximate spatial dynamics using a series of differential equations tracking the pairwise neighbor-neighbor interactions of a regular square lattice with a Von Neumann neighborhood. Our goal is to find a scalar (8) by which to multiply the mean field birth (8 ' ) and transmission (8 6 ) rates to values appropriate for the spatial context, such that: From equation (7), it is straightforward to calculate (8 ' ) for our spatial model, since births are permitted only at the nearest-neighbor interface, and each cell has six adjacent neighbors. As such:To this end, we multiplied all mean field birth rates (b=0.025) by 6 to equal .15 in the spatial model.The dynamics are slightly more complicated in the case of the transmission rate modifier (8 6 ) because our spatial model allows cells to influence infection up to three 'rings' out from the nearest neighbor, such that each cell is affected by the proportion infectious in a 36-cell vicinity. These dynamics accurately reflect viral transmission, which, even in a plaque assay, can diffuse beyond the immediate neighbor-neighbor boundary, especially in a ten-minute timestep.As such, we chose to represent transmission processes in the spatial model under assumptions of & + = .075, allowing ~7.5% of transmission to be modeled globally and leading to a less extreme multiplication of the mean field transmission rate than assumed under the perfect pair approximation (8 = z) illustrated in equation (9) above. Under these new assumptions, we modify the mean field transmission rate for the spatial context as follows: Image Processing.All image processing and data analysis was carried out in R version 3.6 for MacIntosh (R Core Team 2019). Original images were imported into R and processed via the package EBImage (Pau et al. 2010). Composite images of each well were first split into the 36 or 64subframes from which they were composed (each subframe represents the visual region of focus for the microscope at the time of imaging). Each subframe was trimmed (to remove border effects), processed individually, and recompiled post-processing into binary form, such that light-colored regions of the original image were assigned a value of 1 (white), and dark regions were assigned a value of 0 (black). In the case of images of GFP-expressing cells, these white regions corresponded to \"infectious\" cells, while in images of Hoechst-stained nuclei, they indicated live, \"uninfected\" cells.Microscope focus was poor for control wells and for subframes early in the time series of each trial before GFP expression became apparent, and the original versions of any such subframes were light gray and grainy. Our image processing code identified these subframes as any which possessed a mean pixel value greater than .25 (a value substantially higher than any subframes in which true GFP-expressing or Hoechst-stained cells were visible) and subsequently converted the entire frame to 0 (black).All other subframes were processed following thresholding methods that have been previously described by the authors of EBImage (Pau et al. 2010). As a first pass, all pixels excepting the top 25% lightest pixels tallied were converted to 0 (black). Next, each image frame was walked through a series of secondary thresholding steps using if-else statements in R, such that the lightness threshold for \"infectious\" status was elevated in frames which were lighter overall due to manual variation in imaging and focusing. Processed subframes were then reconstructed into composite binary images, which were manually checked against original images to ensure consistent and reliable results.Post-processing into binary form, the number of discrete shapes with value of 1 were tabulated within each image, using the max(bwlabel(X)) function in EBimage, to determine a cell count per image, again corresponding to a count of infectious cells for GFP-expressing images and to a count of uninfected cells for Hoechst stain images.

            "text": "GFP-expressing images were processed and cells counted across the duration of each infection trial, thus generating a time series of infectious cells. For a subset of plates, infection was terminated, and cells were fixed, Hoechst stained, and imaged at periodic intervals across the duration of the time series. Processing of these images thus allowed for construction of a corresponding time series of live, uninfected cells. Because of logistical constraints (i.e. many plates of simultaneously running infection trials and only one available imaging microscope), the time course of imaging across the duration of each trial was quite variable. As such, we fitted a series of statistical models to our raw image data to reconstruct reliable values of the infectious proportion of each well per hour for each distinct trial in all cell line-virus-MOI combinations (Figure 1-figure supplement 2-3) .",
