            "text": "Background: The evaluation of children with purpuric rash and fever (PRF) is controversial. Although many of them have viral infections, on occasion such patients may be infected with Neisseria meningitidis. We described all children aged 0e18 years with PRF in southern Israel during the period 2005 2016 and compared their microbiologic, laboratory, clinical and outcome characteristics in relation to various etiologies of this syndrome. Methods: Data were summarized from electronic patient and microbiology files. Viral diagnoses were made by serology and/or PCR. Results: Sixty-nine children with PRF were admitted; 30 (43.48%), 9 (13.04%) and 30 (43.48%) had a syndrome of bacterial, viral or non-established etiology, respectively. N. meningitidis infection was diagnosed in 16/69 (23.19%) patients and in 16/30 (53.33%) patients with bacterial etiology; 14/30 (46.67%) patients suffered from a non-invasive bacterial disease (9 with Rickettsial disease). Adenovirus and Influenza B (3 and 2 cases, respectively) represented the most frequent etiologic agents among patients with viral etiology. More patients with PRF of bacterial etiology were older, of Bedouin ethnicity, looked ill on admission, had higher Pediatrics and Neonatology (2019) 60, 556e563 rates of meningitis and were treated more frequently with antibiotics compared with patients with non-bacterial PRF. Fatality rates among patients with bacterial, viral and non-established etiology were 5/30 (16.7%), 0% and 2/39 (5.1%). Conclusions: Although PFR was uncommon, high rates of meningococcal infections were recorded in children with PRF, which was associated with high fatality rates. Rickettsial infections were frequent, emphasizing the need for a high index of suspicion for this disease in endemic geographic areas.",

An initial maculopapular rash may be present in about 7% of these cases. 6 In patients with fulminant meningococcemia, the disease advances rapidly and within a few hours develops to septic shock, characterized by diffuse petechial rash, hypotension, disseminated intravascular coagulation, metabolic acidosis, adrenal hemorrhage, renal insufficiency, myocardial insufficiency and coma, with or without meningitis. 6 Of 402 patients younger than 21 years with invasive meningococcal disease diagnosed during 1980 2000, 80% were febrile, 40% had hypotension or impaired peripheral infusion and 50% had purpura fulminans. 6 Viruses, of which Respiratory Syncytial virus (RSV), Epstein Barr virus (EBV), Cytomegalovirus (CMV), enterovirus, adenovirus and parvovirus B19 represent the most common etiologic factors, were also reported in the medical literature as associated with occurrence of purpuric rashes. 7 Furthermore, relatively newly identified viruses, like human metapneumovirus, coronavirus and bocavirus have also been associated with upper respiratory infections and may also cause purpuric rashes. 8e11 The purpose of the present study is to describe all the cases with PRF occurring in children aged 0 18 years diagnosed and hospitalized at the pediatric departments of the Soroka University Medical Center, Beer-Sheva, Israel, during the period 2005 2016, and to compare their microbiologic laboratory, clinical, therapeutic and outcome characteristics in relation to the various etiologies of this syndrome.",

The study enrolled all the children presenting at the Pediatric Emergency Department and hospitalized due to occurrence of a new purpuric rash accompanied by fever >38 C, after exclusion of Idiopathic Thrombocytopenic Purpura and Henoch-Schonlein Purpura. The patients with PRF were grouped and analyzed according to their inclusion in one of the following 3 etiologic entities: patients with disease of bacterial, viral or non-established (microbiologically) etiology.",

            "text": "Our present study showed the following: 1. PRF was uncommon. 2. A bacterial etiology of PRF was established in 43.48% of the patients while the rest of 43.48% and 13.04% had a syndrome of non-established or viral etiology, respectively. 3. N. meningitidis infection was diagnosed in 23.19% patients hospitalized with PRF. 4. Rickettsial disease was diagnosed in a considerable number of patients (14.5%). 5. More patients were recorded in the group aged >1 year among the patients with bacterial etiology than in those with non-bacterial etiology. 6. Higher bands counts and prolonged INR were more common in patients with bacterial etiology compared with those with viral etiology. 7. The fatality rate in PRF of a bacterial etiology patients was high (16.7%) and N. meningitidis infection was reported in 80% of the fatal cases with established etiology. We showed that 23.19% of all enrolled children and 53.33% of all children with an established bacterial etiology who presented with PRF had meningococcal infection. The rate of meningococcal infection in our study was higher than previously described, both among all patients with PRF enrolled (0.5% 11%) 1e4 and also among all patients with proven bacterial etiology (4.2 24%). 2, 3 The overall mortality rate in our series was 10.2% and reached 16.7%% among the patients with PRF associated with a bacterial infection. Four of the 5 fatalities recorded in our series were due to proven meningococcal invasive disease and two additional fatalities were recorded in patients without recovery of any pathogen and a high suspicion of meningococcal disease, based on their clinical presentation and possible masking of the etiology by previous antibiotic therapy. In a study from 1989 enrolling 190 patients with PRF, 13 (7%) had meningococcal disease, but the most common bacterial association was with Streptococcus pyogenes (19 patients). 2 Viral infections were documented in 28 patients. Patients with invasive bacterial disease appeared more ill, were more likely to have neck stiffness and were more likely to have petechiae on the lower extremities than those with no bacteremic disease. A higher peripheral white blood count and absolute band form count was found in the patient with invasive bacterial disease. 2 Nguyen et al. reported in 1984 on 129 patients hospitalized with PRF in Syracuse, NY, and they found that 26 patients (20.2%) had culture-proven bacterial infection (13 and 8 had N. meningitidis and Haemophilus influenzae type B, respectively). 1 As in our study, the authors could not document any single laboratory test as sensitive enough to detect all patients with life-threatening bacterial infections. Mandl et al. reported in 1997 on 411 patients with PRF examined at the emergency department of the Pediatric Teaching Hospital in Boston. 3 Eight (1.9%) patients had bacteremia or clinical sepsis and 6 of them had serious invasive bacteremia (N. meningitidis recovered in 2 patients). None of the 357 well-appearing patients had serious invasive bacteremia. This study, by reporting invasive bacteremia less frequently than in previous series and being able to identify this condition by clinical criteria, supported the concept of the treatment of selected wellappearing children with PRF as outpatients. 3 In a study examining 233 infants and children younger than 15 years presenting with a non-blanching rash during the period 1998 \u0336 1999 in the UK, 11% had proven meningococcal infection. 4 The authors showed that most children with meningococcal infection were ill at presentation, had a purpuric rash, were febrile and had a delayed capillary refill. None of the children with a non-blanching rash confined to the distribution of the superior vena cava had meningococcal infection. In Israel, Ben-Shimol et al. 12 described the dynamics of childhood invasive meningococcal disease during a 22-year period (1989 2010). The authors reported on a total of 743 cases, 69.2% of them with meningitis and 30.8 with meningococcemia only. The mean annual incidence was 2 cases/100,000 children aged 0 15 years, an incidence similar to those reported from other developed countries. 12 The mean mortality incidence was 0.2 AE 0.1 cases/100,000 children and this was higher in children without meningitis (14.9%) compared to children with meningitis (7.9%). In Israel, meningococcal vaccine was not introduced in the national immunization program and it is administered only to high-risk patients. It is understandable that preventive, rather than therapeutic strategies will have a major contribution to the decrease of the serious morbidity and mortality associated with invasive meningococcal disease.",

Therefore, taking into consideration the high rates of Rickettsial infections reported in Israel and particularly in the southern area of the country and into the Bedouin population, we consider that Rickettsial infection should be highly suspected, in our geographic area, in the initial investigation of patients presenting with PRF and empiric treatment has to be administered to the patients with a high index of suspicion for this disease.",

The authors reported that a viral pathogen was found in 67% of the PCR examinations performed from the nasopharynx. 7 The most frequent pathogens associated with PRF were CMV and EBV (18% each of all patients) followed by enteroviruses and rotavirus (14% each) and H1N1 and human bocavirus (9% each); 41% of the patients were diagnosed with more than one viral pathogen. This study emphasizes that novel viral rapid detection methods (like multiplex q-PCR) are available and should be used in determining the possible viral etiology in a considerable number of patients with PRF and thereby avoiding unnecessary treatments and hospitalizations.",
