In the United Kingdom, Australasia, and parts of Europe, bronchiolitis is interpreted as the presence of tachypnoea, hyperinflation of the chest, and characteristically widespread fine end inspiratory crackles on auscultation. Wheeze is commonly but not invariably present. The pattern of illness is virtually always seen in the first year of life, most commonly in the first 6 months of life. In contrast, in North America and other parts of Europe, bronchiolitis is a term for any viral infection of the lower respiratory tract in the first 2 years of life, and may include children with recurrent wheeze. The confusion over definition is compounded by different types of study; many studies in inpatients will be closer to the UK and Australasian definition, while many studies in outpatients will include mostly children corresponding to the North American and European definition. Furthermore there is no widely accepted validated scoring system to measure illness severity, making comparisons between studies difficult. Commonly, outcome measures in interventional studies will include summation scores of symptoms and signs, oxygen saturations, respiratory rate, and length of stay in hospital.",

            "text": "Approximately 1-3% of infants will be hospitalized with bronchiolitis, of whom 1-2% will require ventilation for either respiratory failure or apnoeas. Hospitalization for bronchiolitis is commoner in boys and in lower socioeconomic groups. Preterm infants (less than 32 weeks) and infants with chronic lung disease, congenital cardiac abnormalities, or immune deficiencies are at higher risk of severe disease. Mortality rates in hospitalized infants are 0.5-1.7%. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) accounts for 50-90% of cases of bronchiolitis resulting in approximately 20000 UK admissions per year. Annual epidemics of RSV occur between late autumn and spring (October to March in the northern hemisphere). The virus rapidly infects the respiratory tract epithelium, causing epithelial necrosis and destruction of the cilia. There is a florid inflammatory response with neutrophil and lymphocytic cellular infiltration and oedema of the submucosa, and an imbalance in cytokines with an excess of TH type II over type I cytokines demonstrated by high interleukin 4 (IL4)/interferon \u03b3 ratio. There is increased mucus production from goblet cells which, in combination with the decimated epithelial cells, results in mucus plugging. Mucus plugging causes obstruction of bronchioles with resultant air trapping leading to areas of hyperinflation and airway collapse. As the respiratory epithelium regenerates, the new non-ciliated cells are poorly equipped to clear the inflammatory debris. Hypoxaemia is primarily due to ventilation/perfusion mismatch, and hypercapnoea is a relatively late phenomenon.",

Ultimately if the infant is unable to tolerate enteral feeds, fluids can be administered intravenously.

It is thought that the action of CPAP is through prevention of airway collapse during the respiratory cycle, so preserving ventilation and decreasing ventilation/perfusion mismatch. Observational studies suggest that in bronchiolitis CPAP decreases the respiratory rate, pulse rate, and partial pressure of carbon dioxide, and so decreases the intubation rate and consequently the rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia. CPAP does not appear to affect length of hospital stay or duration of ventilation. A controlled study demonstrated that if initiated early, nasal CPAP resulted in a significant decrease in PCO 2 and was well tolerated without any significant complications, suggesting that earlier intervention would improve outcome. If respiratory failure continues despite nasal CPAP, full intubation and ventilation is warranted. In those that are mechanically ventilated, administration of exogenous surfactant may decrease duration of mechanical ventilation. If mechanical ventilation is ineffective, there may be a role for extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO).",

The most recent Cochrane review of 22 trials involving 1428 infants with bronchiolitis who received inhaled bronchodilators (including \u03b2 2 agonists, ipratropium and adrenergic agents) reported a significant improvement in overall average clinical score, but had no effect on either pulse oximetry measurements or on risk of hospitalization.

Hypertonic saline is increasingly utilized in cystic fibrosis (CF) where it increases mucociliary clearance for at least 8 hours in a dose-dependent manner, and increases sputum expectoration. In a randomized placebo-controlled study 4 ml of 7% HS administered twice daily via a nebulizer resulted in significant decreases in the number of both mild and severe respiratory exacerbations, in the days antibiotics received per year; and in the number of days absent from work or school.

Other agents that attract water into the airway, such as the sugar alcohol mannitol, have similar effects. It is unclear whether a similar mode of action is applicable to bronchiolitis, and other postulated modes of action include breakdown of ionic bonds within airway mucus, resulting in decreased mucus viscosity and so easing clearance of airway secretions, and increased prostaglandin E 2 release which stimulates ciliary beat frequency; or possibly HS simply induces coughing, even in normal subjects, and so some of its action could be simply through its tussive effect.",
