More than 80 clones were selected from the library by using the whole inactivated SARS-CoV virions as target. One human scFv, B1, was characterized extensively. The B1 recognized SARS pseudovirus in vivo and competed with SARS sera for binding to SARS-CoV with high affinity (equilibrium dissociation constant, K d = 105 nM). The B1 also has potent neutralizing activities against infection by pseudovirus expressing SARS-CoV S protein in vitro. Finally, we found that the B1 recognized an epitope on S2 protein, especially within amino acids 1023-1189 of S2 protein. This study not only first made a human neutralizing antibody, which recognized an epitope on S2 protein like natural antibody in sera, but also may help us to better understand the immunological characteristics of SARS protein and SARS vaccine design.",

The SARS-CoV is highly contagious and the clinical course is severe with a high mortality. During the outbreak in 2003, there was no effective agent available for SARS prophylaxis and therapy [4, 5] . Although passive serotherapy using polyclonal immune sera from convalescent SARS patients has been shown to be an efficient treatment for SARS and potentially provides immediate protection against infection [6] [7] [8] , human sera are very limited in sufficient amounts and have a possible contamination with infectious agents. There-fore, a viable strategy for SARS prophylaxis and treatment is to produce human antibody by engineering technology.",

This B cell repertoire contains various antibodies with high specificity and matured affinity for SARS-CoV. Compared with na\u00efve or synthetic antibody library, the immune library is more likely to obtain nature-like antibody with high specificity and affinity. Another feature to obtain nature-like antibody is in using complete SARS-CoV virions, rather than a single recombinant protein, as antigen for selections. The reason is that viral particle antigen bears natural and intact conformational immunogenic determinant.

S1 protein and S2 protein have been verified as important epitopes that elicit neutralization antibody in a previous study on SARS-CoV and other coronaviruses [36, 37] .

This study would have significance not only for developing neutralizing antibody, but also for a better understanding of the immunogenic characteristics of SARS protein and the design of SARS vaccine. Fig. 7 . Epitope mapping of scFv B1 by Western blot analysis. (A) scFv B1 recognizes S (12-1194)-Fc protein but does not bind to S1 (12-672)-Fc protein; (B) the proteins S (12-1194)-Fc and S1 (12-672)-Fc are recognized by anti-human Fc antibody as control; (C) SDS-PAGE analyzes the expression of S2 protein and its fragments; (D) Western blot shows the binding of scFv B1 to S2 (680-1189) and S2 (1023-1189), but does not recognize the S2(680-1029) and S2 (680-879).",
