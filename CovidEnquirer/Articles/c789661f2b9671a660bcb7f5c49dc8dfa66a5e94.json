The 95% CI for individual predictions of periostin levels were plus or minus 7.7 ng/mL. The mean coefficient of variation for periostin for the 60 participants was 6.3% (95% CI, 5.7% to 7.0%).

Five participants had a severe asthma exacerbation during the study and required systemic corticosteroids (Fig 2) with a mean dose of 35 mg/d (range, 20-60 mg/d; courses lasting from 1-16 days; see Table E6 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org). The mixed linear model estimate of the difference in periostin levels between the first measurement after a severe exacerbation requiring systemic corticosteroids and the pre-exacerbation measurements for these 5 participants was 25.4 ng/mL (95% CI, 28.3 to 22.6 ng/mL; P 5 .002). The difference in periostin levels between the postexacerbation and pre-exacerbation levels was 24.5 ng/mL (95% CI, 27.0 to 21.9 ng/mL [P < .001]; which is smaller than the 95% CI for an individual prediction of periostin levels).",

The within-participant variance was 15.3, with a 95% CI for periostin levels of 67.7 ng/mL. These findings in adults receiving step 4 treatment according to Global Initiative for Asthma guidelines 9 are consistent with those of studies performed in populations with severe asthma over a period of 2 4 and 5 1 weeks, respectively. These studies reported a coefficient of variation rather than variance components, with point estimates of 5.0% and 5.3%, respectively. This is consistent with the low intraparticipant variability in periostin measurements observed in this study, in which the coefficient of variation was 6.3%. We found no evidence of a monthly or seasonal fluctuation in serum periostin levels between participants who were recruited over a 12-month period. Therefore it might not be necessary to consider seasonality when assessing periostin levels in candidates for treatment with the novel asthma biologic therapies. Periostin levels are modestly reduced by systemic corticosteroid treatment of a severe asthma exacerbation, but the effect lies within the level of variation expected in otherwise stable adults with asthma.",

It further suggests that, in distinction to null alleles, different therapeutic approaches may be needed for ''leaky'' mutations that permit survival beyond the typical time frame and for whom hematopoietic stem cell transplant at older age may be associated with excess risk. 8 We expand the clinical phenotype of hypomorphic ZAP-70 deficiency and provide proof-of-concept that mutation-targeted therapy can improve immune function.",

An older brother died at 16 months from suspected viral encephalitis; an older sister and parents were well. P1 had a history of failure to thrive, adrenal insufficiency, and inflammatory enterocolitis starting in infancy, recurrent respiratory tract infections starting at 9 months, and intermittent mucocutaneous candidiasis, recurrent herpes simplex virus stomatitis, and varicella-zoster virus infections 3 times. Investigations at the time revealed a visible thymus, normal immunoglobulin isotypes with poor response to vaccines, and persistent CD8 1 lymphocytopenia (1% to 3% of total T cells age-adjusted reference range). Beginning at approximately 3 years of age, serial testing demonstrated increasing proportion of CD8 1 T cells (8% to 10% of total lymphocytes). Further investigations were suggestive of ZAP-70 deficiency (Fig E1,  B and C). However, a reference laboratory reported identifying no mutation in ZAP70. Thus, bone marrow transplantation was not pursued. IgA nephropathy at age 16 years eventually required renal transplant from his mother at age 30 years. The subsequent years were marked by EBV viremia/lymphoproliferative disorder (with recurrence of viremia ;6 months after completing rituximab), cytomegalovirus viremia (with recurrence following cessation of (val)ganciclovir), polyomaviremia (BK and JC viruses), and epidermodysplasia verruciformis-like lesions (due to human papilloma virus-23) (see Fig E2 in this article's Online Repository at www.jacionline.org), which prompted reevaluation for an underlying immunodeficiency. He is currently aged 35 years, on immunoglobulin replacement for respiratory tract infection prophylaxis, and his viral infections are managed conservatively.",

This new splice site is predicted to create a 19-bp deleted product with a premature stop codon in exon 10. Sanger sequencing confirmed the homozygous c.1272C>T variant in P1; the unaffected family members were heterozygous (Fig 1, B) . RT-PCR from P1's PBMCs confirmed the predicted splicing effect, demonstrating a predominant mutant isoform with trace levels of WT isoform (Fig 1, C and D) . The heterozygous family members possessed both isoforms but with higher WT levels; unrelated healthy controls expressed only the WT isoform. Sequencing of gel-eluted bands confirmed the 19-bp deletion in the mutant isoform (data not shown). Thus, c.1272C>T variant creates a mutant mRNA isoform through aberrant splicing; in homozygous state, the mutant isoform predominates over WT in P1.",

            "text": "Although the mutant donor splice site (DSS mut ) is stronger than the native WT site (DSS wt ), the latter is still intact and functionally able to generate WT ZAP70 mRNA and protein. In P1's homozygous mutant state, this is clearly inadequate for T-cell homeostasis. However, in heterozygous family members, ZAP-70 WT protein is sufficiently produced to maintain an otherwise well state. We hypothesized that blocking the stronger DSS mut in P1 would favor usage of DSS wt to increase WT ZAP-70 levels and consequently, T-cell function. To prove this, we designed an antisense morpholino oligonucleotide (AMO) to target the c.1272C>T variant while sparing the native exon-intron junction so as to block the mutant splice effect during processing of ZAP70 pre-mRNA (Fig 1, F) . To confirm that the AMO specifically inhibited expression of the mutant ZAP70 isoform (ie, blocked its transition from pre-mRNA to mRNA), we treated P1's PBMCs and demonstrated correction of splicing (Fig 1, G) . Optimization studies demonstrated maximal corrective effect starting at 48 hours using 5 mM AMO, producing approximately 50% WT mRNA (confirmed by sequencing; data not shown). A similar AMO-induced effect on mutant mRNA was seen on the sister's cells (data not shown); there were insufficient number of cells from P1's parents for testing. To verify the specificity of this effect, we treated cells from healthy controls and observed no effect (data not shown). Immunoblot analysis of P1's AMO-treated PBMCs demonstrated increased ZAP-70 expression, confirming that the correction of aberrant splicing results in augmented production of ZAP-70 protein (Fig 2, A and B) . AMO-treated PBMCs demonstrated increased linker for activation of T cells activation following OKT3 stimulation compared with untreated cells (Fig 2, A and B) , indicating that this restored ZAP-70 retains functionally intact TcR signaling. To determine whether the AMO could improve cellular function, we evaluated the expression of prototypical T-cell cytokine genes, IL2, IL4, IL10, and IFNG (IFN-g) (Fig 2, C) . AMO treatment alone increased IL2, IL4, and IL10 expression; IL2 and IL4 expression was further enhanced by CD3/CD28 stimulation (Fig 2, C) . Treatment with AMO had no effect on IFN-g expression (data not shown), likely due to the reestablished T H 2-driven responses in the PBMCs polarizing away from T H 1 responses. Last, AMO treatment reestablished the proliferative response to CD3/CD28 costimulation in P1's primary T cells, an effect seen in both CD4 1 and CD8 1 T cells (Fig 2, D expression of WT ZAP-70 protein, which is molecularly intact and capable of restoring key T-cell functional responses.",

Interestingly, the autoimmune diseases here (colitis; nephropathy) were also reported by Chan et al, 1 who elegantly demonstrated that a fine molecular balance in ZAP-70 effect on T-cell signaling can be associated with autoimmunity only.

Although the breadth of T-cell functions could not be fully investigated pragmatically, to our knowledge this represents the first example in which AMO therapy successfully restored immune function in primary cells from a human with a genetically defined immunodeficiency. This approach could also extend to therapeutically modulate functional singlenucleotide polymorphisms in immune genes. Clearly, additional parameters will need to be addressed before this approach can be used in clinical practice (eg, pharmacokinetics and safety), although this strategy is in use for inborn errors of muscle or metabolism. 9 Overall, the insight gained from this work opens new avenues for individualized, mutation-targeting therapy for CID.
