Many genotypes circulate in a given area, and optimal protection relies on vaccination with live attenuated vaccines of the same genotype. As these live vaccines are derived from field viruses and circulate, understanding the prevalence of different IBV genotypes in any area is complex. In a recent study, the genome comparison of an IBV QX vaccine and its progenitor field strain led to the identification of vaccine markers. Here we developed a simplex SYBRgreen RT-qPCR assay for differentiation between QX-like field and vaccine strains and a multiplex SYBRgreen RT-qPCR assay for IBV genotyping with melting curve analysis, as each virus produced distinct and reliable melting peaks. Both the simplex and the multiplex assays showed excellent efficiency, sensitivity and specificity representing a low cost diagnostic tool for IBV genotyping and vaccine differentiation.",

            "text": "Infectious Bronchitis Virus (IBV) is a highly contagious avian coronavirus belonging to the family Coronaviridae, genus Gammacoronavirus. IBV infects primarily domestic fowl causing disease associated with respiratory signs, and in some cases with kidney lesions and proventriculitis, resulting in increased mortality in unprotected birds and in serious economic losses (Cook et al., 2012) . There is a wide variety of genetically distinct IBV genotypes; some have been continuously detectable since suitable typing techniques were developed, some have appeared, briefly caused a problem and then disappeared, some proved restrained to a particular geographical area, some widespread (Cook et al., 2012; Jackwood et al., 2012) . The control of the disease occurs mainly by vaccination using live attenuated homologous vaccines (Geerligs et al., 2011; Jackwood et al., 2003) , or a combination of two antigenically distinct live attenuated vaccines Jordan, 2017; Terregino et al., 2008) . Effective knowledge of the prevalence and circulation of different IBV genotypes is needed to decide upon the most effective vaccination protocol. However, this decision is complicated by the circulation and thus presence of the very live vaccines applied for disease control. For example, withdrawal of IBV 793/B (lineage GI-13) live vaccine in Northern Italy led to the disappearance of this previously thought ubiquitous genotype, suggesting that IBV 793/B virulent strains were absent in the area (Franzo et al., 2014a) .",

IBVs' differentiation and genotyping rely on serological analyses and/or on RT-PCR followed by sequencing of full or partial S1 gene, which, due to its variability and biological function, is the region commonly targeted for this purpose (Cavanagh et al., 1999; Worthington et al., 2008) . However, they both represent expensive and/or time-consuming methodologies. SYBRgreen RT-qPCR paired with melting curve analysis represents a more economic and time-effective strategy for IBV genotyping and for the differentiation between vaccine and field strains in a single analysis. Using this approach genotyping and/or vaccine differentiation relies on sequence variants identification based on their individual melting temperatures, a strategy successfully applied for typing of other avian viruses (Franzo et al., 2014b; Pham et al., 2005; Steer et al., 2011) . However, due to the high number of IBV genotypes (or lineages) (Valastro et al., 2016) and the lack of vaccine markers for most of IBV vaccines (Listorti et al., 2017) the development of effective SYBRgreen RT-qPCR assays represents a challenge for any research group embarking in this task.",

Comparison of the full genome sequences of vaccine Poulvac IB QX (Zoetis) and its progenitor 1148-A identified several vaccine markers, including three consecutive nucleotide changes in the S1 gene (Listorti et al., 2017) . Those unique vaccine markers affecting the GC content of the target region were targeted to develop a SYBRgreen RT-qPCR assay enabling the differentiation of vaccine Poulvac IB QX from QX-like field strains via melting curve analysis. Next we developed a multiplex assay for the simultaneous genotyping of IBV Mass-type (lineage GI-1) and IBV QXlike (lineage GI-19) strains, as those two genotypes represent a major threat for the poultry industry worldwide (Cook et al., 2012; de Wit et al., 2018; Jackwood et al., 2012) . To achieve this, specific primer sets were designed and RT-qPCR and SYBRgreen analysis settings were optimized in order to detect and differentiate the sequence variants of interest. Both the simplex and the multiplex approaches proved reliable and effective diagnostic tools, showing excellent sensitivity, specificity and repeatability within and between runs. The application of these protocols will aid in the understanding of the molecular epidemiology of IBV and they represent proves of principle for future developments and applications of melting curve analyses towards IBV diagnosis.",

QX-specific oligo pairs were designed to amplify the portion of S1 gene containing the two transversion (G\u2192T) affecting the GC content of the gene, hence affecting also the melting temperature of the amplicon. To confirm the higher GC content in QX-like field strains detected worldwide, the multiple sequence alignment was trimmed to include solely the target region. For easiness of analysis, the dataset was processed with cd-hit-est test of the CD-HIT Suite (http://weizhongcluster.ucsd.edu/cdhit_suite/cgi-bin/index.cgi?cmd = cd-hit-est) (Li and Godzik, 2006) to cluster sequences that shared 100 % identity, such as each cluster represents a unique prototype sequence. The resulting unique prototype sequences were processed using uMELT Melting Curve Predictions Software (https://www.dna.utah.edu/umelt/umelt. html) to compare the predicted melting curve of vaccine Poulvac IB QX to those of the field strains.

It is possible that the lower sensitivity of the multiplex assay is due to heterodimers assembling between QX-like and Mass-type oligo, reducing the availability of the QX-specific oligo during the annealing phase of the thermal cycle. The good efficiency and linearity at least up to one dilution above the limit of detection, together with the high repeatability observed for both the assays, suggest their suitability for viral quantification not only for diagnostic, but also for research purposes. To support, the simplex RT-qPCR has been successfully used in a study aiming to assess the tissue distribution of IBV-D388 at early time points after infection (manuscript in preparation). The same study showed that the efficiency of the protocol is not affected by the sample's matrix, as viral RNA was detected and quantified in tracheal and cloacal swabs, lungs and kidneys. The optimization of the designed oligo sets, reaction chemistries, thermal protocol and melting curve analyses avoided the presence of nonspecific amplifications, which, coupled with the in silico evaluation performed, ensured the high specificity of the assays, as demonstrated when tested against others IBV genotypes and different avian pathogens.",
