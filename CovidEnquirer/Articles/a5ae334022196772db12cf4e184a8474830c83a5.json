All tissues were studied under basal conditions during the first period and in the presence of 30mM glucose added to both sides of the tissue during the second period. For the third period, one-half of the segments were studied after adding 1 mM ouabain to both sides and one-half after adding 10 mM theophylline to both sides. Tissue was allowed to equilibrate for the first 15 min of each period, except in the case of ouabain, when a 25-min period was allowed t o permit the PD to fall to zero . One-milliliter samples were withdrawn from the bathing solutions at lO-min intervals for counting. The flux characteristics of the tissue were stable for at least 3 hr under the conditions of this experiment. 24Na+ was counted in a well-type crystal gamma counter (Biogamma, Beckman Instruments, Fullerton, Calif.) with the threshold set to completely exclude the weaker radiations from 22Na+. Three weeks later when 24Na+ activity had decayed, 22Na+ was counted in the same gamma counter, and the combined activities of 22Na+ and 36CI-were counted in a well-type beta scintillation counter (Nuclear-Chicago Corp., Des Plaines, 111.). Standards containing known amounts of 22Na + and 3\u00b7CI-, singly and in combination, were used so that the two isotopes could be separated by calculating differential efficiencies of the beta and gamma counters. The PD of the tissue was measured at lO-min intervals; the current necessary to short-circuit the tissue was manually applied from an adjustable current source. In all experiments correction was made for the drop in electrical potential between bridge tips and tissue surfaces by determining any electrode asymmetry, system potentials, and buffer fluid resistance between electrode tips before mounting the tissues . The short-circuit current (I.e) necessary to neutralize the PD of the tissue was calculated according to the graph method of Clarkson and Toole\" except if the current exceeded 200 ~a, when the method of Asano,' which gave comparable results, was used. Tissue conductance was calculated as the reciprocal of the tissue resistance and expressed as millisiemens per square centimeter.

In suspensions of epithelial cells, selectively isolated from villi by a vibration technique which excluded crypt cells, Na + efflux was measured using a technique described previously for rat cells except that the isolation solution and MgCh wash solution contained 5 mM Tris-Tris HCI buffer instead of 2 mM Tris buffer.\" In a previous preliminary experiment using isolated pig enterocytes, the technique used differed in that epithelial cells were isolated at 4\u00b0C , rather than 37\u00b0C, and sucrose K 2HPO. and albumin were not included in the isolation solution. 6 The harvested epithelial cells were loaded with radioactive Na+ by suspending them in incubation medium containing 22Na+. After being washed, the cells were resuspended in tracer-free medium and the Na+ efflux rate constant was ascertained by measuring the rate of appearance of radioactive Na+ in the medium .

            "text": "In jejunal epithelium, where previous in vivo experiments detected abnormal ion flux,6 a defect in glucosestimulated Na+ transport has now been identified. In the Ussing chamber experiments, infected and control tissue secreted equally under basal conditions, the only significant difference between the two being a modest increase in PD across the infected tissue. However, when glucose was added, increments in net Na+ and CI-fluxes, PD, and short circuit current in infected tissue were blunted. The data from enterocytes selectively harvested from villi of infected pigs, in which it was found that the response of Na+ efflux to glucose was totally abolished, confirm the Ussing chamber findings and suggest that the defect extends along a sizable segment of gut and that it is particularly severe in cells from villi. Because the 30-cm segment from which the cells were taken was adjacent to but always below the segment used for short-circuit chamber experiments, it may be that the functional lesion is of greater severity in the more distal segment. The in vitro findings could account for the decreased lumen-to-extracellular fluid Na+ flux observed in intact pigs, since these previous in vivo experiments were done with glucose-containing perfusate. The failure to responl fully to glucose is undoubtedly a brush border defect, and there is additional evidence incriminating the brush border in TGE. When electron microscopic lesions occur in this disease, they are seen in the brush border and consist of shortened and sparse microvilli. Furthermore, several brush border enzymes are diminished in activity when measured in mucosal homgenates from diseased pigs. 5 An additional factor contributing to decreased lumen-to-extracellular fluid Na + flux could be a defect in active Na+ extrusion at the basal-lateral cell membrane. Previously, diminished Na-K-ATPase activity was found in mucosal homogenates from TGE-infected pigs. 5 In the present study, under basal conditions, ouabain-sensitive active Na + efflux was diminished in villous enterocytes from TGE pigs, suggesting a defective active Na + pump in TGE. Although decreased active Na+ efflux' could be explained by diminished intracellular Na+ secondary to defective Na+ influx, this explanation seems unlikely. Passive efflux, that portion of the efflux rate constant remaining after maximal inhibition with ouabain, is also dependent on intracellular Na + concentration, and it was not effected by TGE infection. It is believed that these latter data, consistent and reproducible, differ from those reported in an earlier report from this laboratory because previously the cells were exposed to an inappropriate temperature during the isolation period. 6 The in vitro data do not fully explain the increased extracellular fluid-to-Iumen Na + flux found in the previous marker perfusion study. 6 Presumably, the increased transmural PD occurring in TGE would encourage secretion under basal conditions. Either factors other ~han active epithelial transport are involved or possibly these methods were not sufficiently discriminating to detect significant abnormalities. Jejunum has rarely been studied in short-circuited chambers, and because diseased tissue was worked with it was necessary to eliminate basal control periods for each of the pharmacological agents used. Nevertheless, diseased tissue was stable over the lengthy study period and the control data agree generally with previous findings in the rat, 12 rabbie a and man. H \u2022 1 5 Of these only the rabbit jejunum has been found similar to the pig in that it secretes under basal conditions. The transport defect in viral enteritis appears to differ from that occurring in response to the enterotoxins of Vibrio cholerae 15 -18 or Escherichia coli. 19 In cholera, glucose-faciliated Na + transport is intact, and secretion is mediated by increased cellular concentrations of cyclic AMP ; in ileal tissue exposed to choleragen, adenyl cyclase activity is increased and the normal electrical and transport responses to theophylline are suppressed. In TGE tissue, glucose-facilitated Na + transport is impaired, adenyl cyclase activity is normal,6 and no convincing evidence of an abnormal response to theophylline has been found . The few available in vitro data on ion transport in other invasive enteric infections have not suggested common mechanisms for these diarrheas. In a granulomatous enteritis associated with Coccidia infestation in rabbit ileum, abnormal glucose-facilitated N a + transport and a normal electrical response to theophylline were found. 20 However, in a diarrheogenic invasive salmonella infection, glucose-faciliated Na+ transport was normal and the response to theophylline was blunted. 21 As the understanding of the response of the gut to viral invasion evolves, it will be possible to determine whether data from TGE diarrhea can be applied to the problem of the human infant with viral gastroenteritis. Recent reports have clearly identified a specific virus as a major cause of acute infantile diarrhea throughout the world. 22-2 6 The disease in man, although caused by a different virus, bears many similarities to TGE in the pig; most notably it is an invasive infection of the proximal intestinal epithelium.",
