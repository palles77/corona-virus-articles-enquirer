Polyphyletic Not being connected to a common ancestor. Polythetic Sharing many, but not all characteristics of a common core set of characteristics. Species Currently the lowest-ranked taxon in virus taxonomy. Not to be confused with \"viruses,\" which are physical entities assigned to species. Taxon A man-made category for viruses that share certain characteristics. The now commonly accepted correct plural of \"taxon\" is the fake Greek \"taxa\" (\"taxons\" would actually be more correct but is not used in English). Taxonomy Virus classification into taxa and taxon nomenclature. The term \"taxonomy\" is a misnomer as the term is based on Greek \"t\u03ac\u03be\u03b9\u03c2 [t\u00e1xis]\". \"Taxinomy\" is a better derivation but is not used in English. Virions Particles produced by some, but not all viruses, during the viral lifecycle for transfer of the viral genome from one host cell to another. Not to be confused with \"virus.\" Virions differ from virus particles in that the former are assumed to be infectious, whereas the latter may be noninfectious or otherwise defective Virus A replicative non-cellular physical entity that is obliged to depend on a host cell for replication. Virus is not to be confused with \"species,\" which are man-made categories into which viruses are classified nor be confused with \"virion.\" which are particles that are produced by some, but not all, viruses ",

            "text": "Virus taxonomy arguably began with the discovery of \"ultrafiltrable\" (i.e., non-bacterial) agents today called \"viruses.\" This discovery began in 1886, when Adolf Eduard Mayer (1843 Mayer ( -1942 grouped a set of similar infectious diseases of tobacco plants under the name \"Mosaikkrankheit des Tabaks\" (German for \"tobacco mosaic disease\"). In 1892, Dmitrij Iosifovi\u010d Ivanovskij reported that the sap of a plant affected by tobacco mosaic disease retained its infectivity even after passage through a Chamberland filter that held back most bacteria. Unaware of Ivanovskij's experiments, Martinus Willem Beijerinck (1851 Beijerinck ( -1931 also observed that filtration of infectious sap did not result in sterility. In 1898, Beijerinck reported that filtered sap retained its infectious nature even after dilution and that the sap of a newly infected plant was similarly potent after passage. Beijerinck coined the term \"contagium vivum fluidum\" (Latin for \"contagious living liquid\") for this novel type of pathogen. The term \"virus\" (Latin for \"poison\"), previously used for any infectious agent or toxin, became ever more frequently used for this novel type of pathogen, variations of which were then discovered in animals (e.g., foot-and-mouth disease virus), including humans (e.g., yellow fever virus). The (partially) particulate nature of viruses was proven when F\u00e9lix d'Herelle reported the invention of the plaque assay for virus particle quantification in 1917, when he discovered viruses infecting bacteria. In 1935 , Wendell Meredith Stanley (1904 -1971 crystallized tobacco mosaic disease-causing particles and demonstrated that they consisted largely of protein. In 1939 , Gustav-Adolf Kausche (1901 -1960 ), Edgar Pfankuch, and Helmut Ruska (1908 -1973 published the first-ever electronmicroscopic images of virus particles, namely those of tobacco mosaic disease virus.",

            "text": "The first systematic classification of viruses was proposed in 1939 by Bennett on behalf of the newly formed Committee for Virus Nomenclature of the Council of the American Phytopathological Society. Accordingly, viruses were grouped by the type and morphological/cytological manifestation of symptoms they cause in their hosts, their host tropisms, their modes of transmission via disease vectors, and the antigenic, chemical, and physical properties of their particles. In 1941, a classification was suggested by Bawden that was based solely on chemical, antigenic, and morphological properties of virus particles. This suggestion was, in essence, followed by others for many years. In 1948 , Francis O. Holmes (1899 -1990 suggested a first all-encompassing taxonomic system that was somewhat reminiscent of that used for animals and plants. He proposed a top-rank taxon, the order \"Virales,\" that would include three suborders for viruses that infect bacteria (\"Phaginae\"), plants (\"Phytophaginae\"), or animals (\"Zoophaginae\"). Holmes further created 13 families, 32 genera, and 248 species. However, this system did not gain community support because Holmes separated viruses based on their host tropisms and ignored the considerable morphological similarities of the particles produced by all of the viruses that he separated into the 3 suborders. From 1953 -1957 , Andr\u00e9 Michel Lwoff (1902 -1994 created and expanded a set of criteria for the definition of \"virus.\" This definition informed a hierarchical virus taxonomy brought forth in 1961 by Peter D. Cooper, who divided animal viruses using particle characteristics into those that contain either DNA (\"deoxyviruses\") or RNA (\"riboviruses\"). Further division of each group was dependent on ether sensitivity, i.e., dependent on whether the particles were wrapped in lipid envelopes (\"lipoviruses\"), or ether resistance (\"clathroviruses\"). From 1963-1967, this system was improved to incorporate virus particle sensitivity to low pH and particle shape and symmetry as classification criteria.",

Each subphylum included classes based on the symmetry of virion capsids (e.g., the classes \"Deoxyhelica\" for \"helical DNA viruses\" and \"Ribocubica\" for \"cubical RNA viruses\").

Currently, \"[a] species is the lowest taxonomic level in the hierarchy approved by the ICTV. A species is a monophyletic group of viruses whose properties can be distinguished from those of other species by multiple criteria\". Both species definitions have been highly controversial, and discussions continue on how to improve them. However, scientists broadly agree that the lowest rank of species is needed. (2) In 2017, the ICTV acknowledged that most viruses of the global virome are unlikely to ever be cultured or otherwise characterized in a laboratory. Hence, the ICTV accepted virus classification based on information deduced from an at least coding-complete virus genome sequence. This step expanded the classification to include numerous viruses known only from metagenomic datasets and, thereby, opened the door for sophisticated phylogenetic analyses and a vastly improved official description of the virosphere. Importantly, this step by the ICTV only means that the minimum requirement for virus classification is the availability and analysis of a coding-complete virus genome, but it does empathetically not exclude taking other virus characteristics, such as particle morphologies, tissue and host tropism, or infection phenotype, into consideration.",

The ICTV Executive Committee (EC) consists of 19 elected members with term limits, including a President, a Vice-President, several Secretaries, and 6 Subcommittee Chairs who are experts for large groups of viruses of all cellular organisms. Next to the EC, the ICTV consists of 11 elected Life Members (experts who contributed significantly to the development of virus taxonomy in the past), 42 nominated National Members (national representatives of international microbiological or virologic IUMS member societies), and 101 Study Group Chairs. The latter are ICTV members appointed by EC Subcommittee Chairs, typically for a maximum of two 3-year terms, to assemble an unlimited number of experts, who are not part of the ICTV, but who have specific expertise on viruses of, typically, a viral family or order. All ICTV members perform their duties voluntarily without pay. Official statutes outline the ICTV remit, actions, and interactions within ICTV and with the community, and a code, the International Code of Virus Classification and Nomenclature (ICVCN), outlines the official rules and recommendations for virus classification into taxa and taxon nomenclature. Importantly, the ICTV is currently not responsible for the nomenclature of viruses (their names and abbreviations) or their subclassifications into isolates, strains, variants, genotypes, serotypes, lineages, or clades.

The (typically ICTV Study Grouprecommended) criteria for virus classification and the demarcation criteria that are used to decide whether a virus belongs to an already established taxon or requires the establishment of a new taxon are modified continuously based on improved understanding of virus micro-and macroevolution. These criteria often differ between taxa because distinct virus groups evolve with different speeds depending on their genome types, absence or presence of replication proof-reading mechanisms, and propensity to reassort genome segments and/or to engage in horizontal gene transfer. By today, no general methodology for virus classification is commonly accepted. Some ICTV Study Groups recommend complete-genome pairwise sequence comparisons to establish percentage similarity cut-offs for taxon demarcation. However, others Study Groups focus on the phylogenies of certain hallmark features (e.g., the core domain of RNA-directed RNA polymerases), concatenated open reading frames, network analyses of structural features of hallmark proteins, or phenotypic features of viruses. Such features may include host tropism, receptor usage, or type of induced host disease.

Consequently, in 2020, Koonin et al. outlined the first systematic top-down virus taxonomy since the LHT system. Accordingly, a total of four realms would be needed to classify most currently known viruses at all available principle/ primary ranks. The establishment of the realms was proposed to be justified based on the discovery of specific viral hallmark genes that can be used to evolutionary connect all their constituent viruses: (1) RdRps and RNA-directed DNA polymerases (RdDps) for most RNA viruses (Riboviria); (2) replication initiator proteins (Reps) of the His-hydrophobic-His (HUH) superfamily for all single-stranded DNA viruses; (3) vertical jelly-roll capsid proteins for many double-stranded DNA viruses; and (4) HK97-fold capsid proteins for viruses classified in Caudovirales and Herpesvirales. If accepted by the ICTV, virus classification would finally begin to resemble the classification schemes of cellular organisms.
