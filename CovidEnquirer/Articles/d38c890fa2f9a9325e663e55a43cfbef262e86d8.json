            "text": "Many detection methods have been used or reported for the diagnosis and/or surveillance of SARS-CoV-2. Among them, reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) is the most sensitive, claiming detection of about 5 copies of viruses. However, it has been reported that only 47-59% of the positive cases were identified by RT-PCR, probably due to loss or degradation of virus RNA in the sampling process, or even mutation of the virus genome. Therefore, developing highly sensitive methods is imperative to ensure robust detection capabilities. With the goal of improving sensitivity and accommodate various application settings, we developed a multiplex-PCR-based method comprised of 172 pairs of specific primers, and demonstrated its efficiency to detect SARS-CoV-2 at low copy numbers. The assay produced clean characteristic target peaks of defined sizes, which allowed for direct identification of positives by electrophoresis. In addition, optional sequencing can provide further confirmation as well as phylogenetic information of the identified virus(es) for specific strain discrimination, which will be of paramount importance for surveillance purposes that represent a global health imperative. Finally, we also developed in parallel a multiplex-PCR-based metagenomic method that is amenable to detect SARS-CoV-2, with the additional benefit of its potential for uncovering mutational diversity and novel pathogens at low sequencing depth.",

            "text": "A severe epidemic coronavirus (SARS-CoV-2) infection, now just characterized as a pandemic by the World Health Organization (WHO), started in December of 2019 in Wuhan China and quickly spread to many countries in the world [1] [2] [3] . It has caused over 7,000 deaths as of mid-March and made daily impacts on various aspects of societal life around the globe 4 . SARS-CoV-2 is a coronavirus with positive-sense, singlestranded RNA about 30kb in length. The genome of SARS-CoV-2 is currently under careful investigation [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] and being extensively modeled according to the Chinese National Center for Biological information (2019 New Coronavirus Information Database, https://bigd.big.ac.cn/ncov). Of note, SARS-CoV-2 exhibits over 99% sequence similarity among many sequenced isolates, and is also highly similar to other coronaviruses 5,9 . Present methods for detecting SARS-CoV-2 have been reported and discussed 10, 11 , including RT-PCR, serological testing 12 and reverse transcription-loop-mediated isothermal amplification 13, 14 . Currently, RT-PCR is considered the gold standard of diagnosis for SARS-CoV-2 due to its ease of use and high sensitivity. RT-PCR has been reported to detect SARS-CoV-2 in saliva 15 , pharyngeal swab, blood, anal swab 16 , urine, stool 17 , and sputum specimens 18 . In laboratory conditions, the RT-PCR methodology has been shown to detect 4-8 copies of virus, through amplification of targets in the Orf1ab, E and N viral genes, at 95% confidence intervals [19] [20] [21] . However, only about 47-59% of the positive cases were identified by RT-PCR, and 75% of RT-PCR negative results were actually found to be positive, with repeated tests required 17, [22] [23] [24] . In addition, there is evidence suggesting that heat inactivation of clinical samples causes loss of virus particles, thereby hindering the efficiency of downstream diagnosis 25 .",

The urgency to develop an effective surveillance method that can be easily used in a variety of laboratory settings is underlined by the wide and rapid spreading of SARS-CoV-2 [28] [29] [30] . In addition, such method should also distinguish SARS-CoV-2 from other respiratory pathogens such as influenza virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, rhinovirus, human metapneumovirus, SARS coronavirus, etc., as well as mycoplasma pneumoniae, chlamydia pneumonia and bacterial pneumonia [31] [32] [33] [34] . Furthermore, providing nucleotide sequence information through next generation sequencing (NGS) will prove to be essential for the surveillance of SARS-CoV-2's evolution [35] [36] [37] [38] . Indeed, SARS-CoV-2 phylogenetic studies through genome sequence analysis have provided better understanding of the transmission origin, time and routes, which has guided policy-making and management procedures 8, 36, 37, [39] [40] [41] .",

Theoretically, the multiplex PCR strategy, by amplifying hundreds of targets, has significantly higher sensitivity than RT-PCR and may even detect DNA molecules resulting from degraded virus genome fragments. Multiplex PCR has been shown to be an efficient and low-cost method to detect Plasmodium falciparum infections, with high coverage (median 99%), specificity (99.8%) and sensitivity. Moreover, this solution can be tailored to simultaneously address multiple questions of interest within various epidemiological settings 42 . Similar to a recently described metagenomic approach for SARS-CoV-2 identification 43 , we also establish a user-friendly multiplex-PCRbased metagenomic method that is not only able to detect SARS-CoV-2, but could also be applied for the identification of significant sequence mutations within known viruses and to uncover novel pathogens with a limited sequencing depth of approximately 1 million reads.",

To investigate the opportunity for further improvement on the sensitivity of RT-PCR, we built a mathematical model to estimate the limit of detection (LOD) for SARS-CoV-2. The reported RT-PCR amplicon lengths are around 78-158bp, and the SARS-CoV-2 genome is 29,903bp (NC_045512.2). Thus, in this mathematical modeling, we chose 100bp amplicon length and 30kb SARS-CoV-2 genome size for the estimation. With the assumption of 99% RT-PCR efficiency 20 , we found that RT-PCR assays could detect 4.8 copies of SARS-CoV-2 at 95% probability ( Fig. 1A) , which is consistent with the experimental results obtained in a previous report 19 . In this model, the probability of RT-PCR assays to detect one copy of SARS-CoV-2 is only 26% (Supplemental Fig. 1 ). This finding may explain, at least in part, the low reported 47-56% detection rates of SARS-CoV-2 in positive samples by RT-PCR 17, 22 . We further found that the LOD appears to be independent of the virus genome size. For genomes of 4 to 100kb, the detection limit remains 4.8 copies at 95% probability.",

The amplification efficiency of multiplex PCR is critical for LOD. We estimated that the efficiency of our multiplex PCR technology is about 26% by using Unique Molecular Identifier (UMI)-labeled primers to count the amplified products after NGS sequencing (Supplemental Fig. 2 and Supplemental Table 1 ). However, the amplification efficiency could be lower, and not all amplicons amplified successfully if the template used is one single strand of cDNA.

In addition, it has already been reported that 79% of variants are recovered when directly amplifying 600 amplicons from a single cell using our technology 44 . Therefore, we assume that 80% of amplicons would be amplified successfully.

We were able to detect 80% of the regions in S and N genes in libraries generated using 4,500 copies of plasmids, with an average base coverage of 5,000 for a total sequencing depth of 0.6 million reads. A few targets of 150 to 200 bp in length in S and N genes were preferentially amplified. Even when copy number went down to a few copies (3-14), these targets were still detected (Fig.4) . They represented 14% and 11% of the target regions when 14 and 2.8 copies of plasmids were amplified, respectively.",

With 172 pairs of primers, this method enables the detection of low copy numbers, potentially degraded fragments of the viral genome, or even a mutated variant, with high confidence. The 172 pairs of primers cover about 56% of the genome of SARS-CoV-2. When detecting limited copies of virus, fewer targets are successfully amplified. In the case of one copy of virus, we estimate that 20% of the viral genome, or 6kb of sequences, could be amplified. These are sufficient to produce a conspicuous peak in electrophoresis for an initial indication of positives. The use of NGS sequencing can provide nucleic acid-level information to further confirm the identification, and provide additional evidence for phylogenetic analysis. In addition, our method is robust, accurate and easily performed from different levels of expertise in various laboratory settings.",

Metagenomic technology usually requires about 20 to 100 million of sequencing reads in order to detect minuscule numbers of targets embedded in the massive amounts of human background. However, our method appears to selectively amplify target sequences. This bias permits the obtention of around 16% of target bases by sequencing at a depth of about 1 million total reads. It is thus especially suitable for the detection of novel pathogens and highly genetically unstable pathogens, such as influenza viruses. The exact mechanism of deselecting human sequences is currently under investigation. The random hexamer preference, chromosomal structure, sequence composition, target length, circularity, methylation status, telomeric and centromeric regions, as well as the edge effect, may influence such outcome. Ultimately, the observed preferential amplification towards more \"random\" sequences could provide us with an advantageous edge for the continuous improvement of this method.",
