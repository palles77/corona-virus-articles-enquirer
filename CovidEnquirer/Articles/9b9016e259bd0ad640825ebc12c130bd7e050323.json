SOGC CLINICAL PRACTICE GUIDELINE Management guidelines for obstetric patients and neonates born to mothers with suspected or probable severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) \u2606 No. 225, April 2009 a b s t r a c t Objective: This document summarizes the limited experience of SARS in pregnancy and suggests guidelines for management. Outcomes: Cases reported from Asia suggest that maternal and fetal outcomes are worsened by SARS during pregnancy. Evidence: Medline was searched for relevant articles published in English from 2000 to 2007. Case reports were reviewed and expert opinion sought. Values: Recommendations were made according to the guidelines developed by the Canadian Task Force on Preventive Health Care.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome, or SARS, emerged as a highly contagious and life-threatening condition in 2003. By the end of 2003, a total of 8096 cases had been identified internationally, and 774 deaths were reported [1] . Although the majority of cases occurred in South East Asia, 251 probable cases, 187 suspected cases, and 43 deaths were reported in Canada as of September 2003 [2] . It is now known that SARS is caused by a novel coronavirus [3] [4] [5] and is easily spread by respiratory droplets and nosocomial contact [6, 7] . Evidence suggests that health care facilities are the major source for new SARS infections; this was a major factor in the socalled \"second wave\" of SARS infections in April and May 2003 in the Greater Toronto Area. During this period, affected patients from outlying areas were transferred to a designated tertiary care hospital for treatment in order to limit the number of institutions with active SARS cases. Fortunately, only one case of SARS occurring in pregnancy was reported in Canada [8] .",

SARS has been responsible for serious illness in over 250 Canadians and for 43 deaths since 2003. Given the highly infectious nature of SARS, diagnosis, treatment and containment procedures must be aggressively pursued in all medical communities to prevent epidemic spread. Special consideration must be given to the labour and delivery ward where mothers, their babies, and families are potentially placed at risk by exposure to an infected individual. In addition, special procedures must be instituted to protect labour and delivery personnel, who may have prolonged contact with labouring women and substantial exposure to body fluids at the time delivery and neonatal resuscitation. This document outlines a suggested management strategy for pregnant patients with SARS on the labour and delivery ward. This protocol may be of use for other emerging life-threatening infectious diseases.",

Either regional or general anaesthesia may be appropriate for delivery of patients with SARS. (III-C) 6. Neonates of mothers with SARS should be isolated in a designated unit until the infant has been well for 10 days, or until the mother's period of isolation is complete. The mother should not breastfeed during this period. (III-C) 7. A multidisciplinary team, consisting of obstetricians, nurses, pediatricians, infection control specialists, respiratory therapists, and anaesthesiologists, should be identified in each unit and be responsible for the unit organization and implementation of SARS management protocols. (III-C) 8. Staff caring for pregnant SARS patients should not care for other pregnant patients. Staff caring for pregnant SARS patients should be actively monitored for fever and other symptoms of SARS. Such individuals should not work in the presence of any SARS symptoms within 10 days of exposure to a SARS patient. (III-C) 9. All health care personnel, trainees, and support staff should be trained in infection control management and containment to prevent spread of the SARS virus. (III-A) 10. Regional health authorities in conjunction with hospital staff should consider designating specific facilities or health care units, including primary, secondary, or tertiary health care centres, to care for patients with SARS or similar illnesses.
