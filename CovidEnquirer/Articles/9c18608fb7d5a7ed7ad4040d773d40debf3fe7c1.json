The application of a newly developed multi-criteria decision-making tool called RR-PARETO2 is presented. An example of HVAC design is used to illustrate how solutions could be selected within a multi-criteria optimization framework. In this example, five criteria have been selected, namely, power consumption, thermal comfort, risk of airborne infection of influenza and tuberculosis and effective differential temperature ( t eq ) of body parts. The goal is to select the optimal air exchange rate that makes reasonable trade-offs among all the objectives. Two scenarios have been studied. In the first scenario, there is an influenza outbreak and the important objective is to prevent the spread of infection. In the second scenario, energy prices are high and the primary objective is to reduce energy. In both scenarios, RR-PARETO2 algorithm selects solutions that make reasonable trade-offs among conflicting objectives. The example illustrates how objectives such as reduction of airborne disease transmission and maximizing thermal comfort can be incorporated in the design of a practical, full-scale HVAC system.",

Unlike traditional mathematical optimization, mathematical characteristics of the evaluation function including convexity, expression for the gradient, etc. are not needed.

[14] performed optimization of HVAC system based on energy consumption, investment cost and thermal comfort using generic optimization program. Hamdy et al. [15] used multi objective genetic algorithm to optimize HVAC system performance for primary energy conservation. However, the decision-making process involving multiple criteria is still not well established. For example, a building design that maximises natural day lighting may not perform well with respect to the total energy consumption, since it might have high cooling loads in tropical climates. Decision-making in such situations is not straightforward because trade-offs have to be made between user's preference for natural day lighting and the goal of reducing energy consumption.",

However, complex engineering artefacts such as building systems have to be necessarily evaluated according to multiple criteria. The task of selecting the best design is complex since it involves making trade-offs among conflicting objectives. Rarely, we find solutions that perform equally well with respect to all the criteria. One approach for accommodating multiple criteria in evaluation is the use of weight factors to combine the effects of all the criteria into a single utility function. A variation of this is presented in [16] , in which a multiplicative utility function is used and the weights are determined through an opinion based survey conducted on experts in the domain. The difficulties with this approach are the subjectivity of the importance factors and the efforts required to obtain a reasonable survey sample to improve the accuracy of assessment. Several other methods for multi-criteria decision-making involving the use of weight factors are summarized in [16] [17] [18] .",

However, they do not present a well-defined algorithm for selecting a single solution from the Pareto front. Instead, it is recommended that the practical selection of system configuration should be limited to the midrange spectrum of the Pareto front, where the curvature is the maximum. In fact, researchers have not paid much attention to the problem of selecting the best solution from the Pareto set. In many applications, the final selection of the solution is usually left to the designer (for example see [20, 21] ).",

BTM was used to measure the mean skin temperature under thermal neutrality for 26 body segments. Mean skin temperature (t s ) was used to calculate manikin based equivalent temperature for every BTM body segment. Manikin based equivalent temperature (t eq ) is defined as: \"the temperature of a uniform enclosure in which a thermal manikin with realistic skin surface temperatures would lose heat at the same rate as it would in the actual environment\". Value of manikin based equivalent temperature was used as air and radiant temperature for calculation of predicted mean vote (PMV) and percentage of people dissatisfied (PPD) [31] . Other ambient parameters used for this calculation were air velocity of 0 m/s, relative humidity 60% while metabolic rate used was 1.1 met and 0.7 clo for clothing level. When hybrid DPV system was used, predicting thermal comfort of occupants solely based on the t eq is not correct because local air movement in the facial region causes increase of forced convection heat transfer while rest of the body was exposed to dominantly natural convective heat transfer. This can cause thermal asymmetry since facial cooling is significantly higher than the rest of the body. Thermal asymmetry can further lead to thermal discomfort and can be indicated by facial region manikin based equivalent temperature difference ( t eq ). This criterion was added to the overall thermal body sensation to evaluate thermal performance of hybrid DPV system. This additional criterion is very important parameter because DPV supply temperature and flow rate are more critical than ambient temperature for occupant's thermal comfort [32] .",

Increase of the supply flow rates beyond 6 ACH reduces airborne infection risk marginally compared to the previous two regions and represents the third region of the curve hybrid DPV Flu curve.

However, if conventional optimization techniques are used to minimize absolute value of t eq for reducing draft sensation, it would result in the selection of 0 ACH which is clearly not acceptable. This shows that the problem has to be necessarily treated as multi-objective optimization and t eq has to be used in conjunction with PPD rating for a better evaluation of user comfort. The trade-off between infection risk and power consumption is shown in Fig. 9 . Increasing ACH reduces the infection risk of Influenza and TB, but at the cost of increasing power consumption. It can be seen that after a certain level, the reduction in infection risk is marginal, while the increase in energy is significant.
