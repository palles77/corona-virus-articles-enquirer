Calves were assigned to the following diets a 28.5% protein and 16.4% fat milk replacer [MR; 29/16 (n = 9)], 27.3% protein and 33.4% fat MR [27/33 (n = 8)], 20.6% protein and 20.6% fat MR [20/20 (8)], or whole milk [WM (n = 8)]. Calves fed 27/33, 29/16, and WM received 180 g/d of CP to support 650 g of ADG based on predictions from the 2001 NRC. Calves were fed 3 times daily for 4 wk. Weight, hip height, wither height, heart girth, and body length were measured weekly. Weekly plasma samples were analyzed for plasma urea nitrogen, nonesterified fatty acids, and glucose. A subset of calves from each treatment was killed [29/16 (n = 7), 27/33 (n = 6), 20/20 (n = 6), and WM (n = 5)] at the end of wk 4 of treatment; processed for whole-body analysis of fat, protein, ash, and DM; and compared with baseline slaughter calves to estimate composition of empty BW gain. Calves did not differ in average weekly scour score or medication days. Feed efficiency and ADG were greatest for calves fed WM and least for calves fed 20/20; calves fed 29/16 and 27/33 did not differ. Calves fed 27/33 or WM had the greatest % body fat and gained more grams of fat than calves fed other diets. Calves fed 29/16 or 20/20 had similar % fat in empty body as baseline. Differences in % CP, % ash, or % water in empty body and empty BW gain were not detected. Calves fed 27/33 had a trend toward higher NEFA in wk 1 and 2 than calves fed 29/ 16 or WM. Growth of calves fed 27/33 and 29/16 were similar except that calves fed 29/16 had lower body fat 5600 % than calves fed 27/33. Calves on all diets gained less than predicted by the 2001 NRC.",

Bartlett et al. (2006) and Diaz et al. (2001) reported an increase in body fat, ADG, and feed efficiency when rate of milk replacer feeding was increased. Increasing the percentage of CP in the diet up to 30% resulted in an increase in lean tissue gain, feed efficiency, and ADG compared with diets with lower levels of protein (Donnelly and Hutton, 1976; Gerrits et al., 1996; Diaz et al., 2001) . Different sources of energy in milk replacer (MR) also have been reported to alter the body composition of calves. Tikofsky et al. (2001) reported that increasing carbohydrate and decreasing fat in isonitrogenous and isocaloric intakes decreased body fat deposition in calves.",

Male Jersey calves were acquired from the Virginia Tech Dairy herd (n = 10) or a Jersey breeder (n = 32) located 100 km from the university. At birth, calves acquired from the Jersey breeder were fed 1 L of pooled colostrum obtained from cows in the Virginia Tech Dairy herd and 1 L of high quality colostrum from the farm of origin. Calves acquired from Virginia Tech received only colostrum procured from the Virginia Tech dairy. Prior to the study frozen colostrum from the Virginia Tech dairy herd was thawed and warmed to 20\u00b0C. A colostrometer was used to determine specific gravity of colostrum and make an indirect assessment of immunoglobulin concentration as described by Fleenor and Stott (1980) . Colostrum with a high immunoglobulin concentration (>50 mg/mL) was mixed in a clean, sanitized 189-L container and then transferred to 1-L bags and frozen (\u221220\u00b0C). A supply of frozen colostrum from the Virginia Tech Dairy herd was maintained at the other calf source farm. Calves were fed an additional 2 L of colostrum from the farm of origin at 12 h of age. Three of the purchased calves died after being transported but before being assigned to treatment and were not replaced due to the limited supply of Jersey bull calves.",

Calves were slaughtered by captive bolt and exsanguination in the necropsy facility of the Virginia-Maryland Regional College of Veterinary Medicine. Blood was collected into a tared plastic bag. The gastrointestinal tract was removed, weighed, stripped of its contents, and reweighed. The calf was separated into the following components: 1) head, hide, feet, and tail (HHFT); 2) internal organs and blood (BO); and 3) carcass (CAR). The carcass fraction was divided, and the left half was discarded. Each component was weighed, bagged, frozen (\u221220\u00b0C), and later transported to Cornell University for further processing.

However, calves fed WM consumed more DM and approximately 10% more fat than calves fed 27/33 milk replacer diet (Table 2 ).

Calves fed 29/16 and 27/33 were intermediate, although calves fed 27/33 consumed more energy than calves fed 29/16, but ADG, total weight gained, and feed efficiency were not different. Calves fed WM consumed similar amounts of protein as calves fed 27/33 or 29/16, but they consumed more fat, had greater ADG, greater total weight gains, and were the most efficient in conversion of feed to gain. Given that calves fed WM and 27/33 consumed similar grams of protein and that calves on both diets consumed more grams of fat than calves fed 29/16, it seems reasonable to expect calves fed 27/33 would exceed growth of calves fed 29/16 and show similar patterns of growth as the calves fed WM. The source of fat in MR formulations was edible lard and the nutrient content of MR was similar to WM in nutrient content (Table 1 ) and the MR met or exceeded (NRC, 2001) requirements. There are several possible reasons for unexpected responses. Superior growth and feed efficiency of calves fed whole milk may be due to coagulation of milk proteins in the abomasum, which delays digestion, allowing for absorption of amino acids and fatty acids to match insulin release (Bartlett et al., 2006) . In addition, milk fat contains a greater proportion of medium-chain length fatty acids as compared with fats composed of long-chain fats typically found in lard and tallow commonly used in milk replacers. Medium-chain length fatty acids are hydrolyzed more rapidly and completely than longchain fatty acids found in most milk replacers (Odie, 1997) . They are also oxidized more rapidly than longchain fatty acids probably leading to differences in energetic efficiency of the utilization of dietary fat.",

These calves gained 110 g per day, indicating that feeding Jersey bull calves a 20/20 MR at 15% of BW is adequate to maintain BW but supports only a modest rate of gain. Feeding MR at 8 to 10% of BW is a common recommendation (Davis and Drackley, 1998) . In this study, calves were not offered starter, which could account at least partially for the low rates of gain of calves fed 20/20. Jones et al. (2004) fed Jersey calves MR (20% CP, 20% fat) at 31% of metabolic weight (about 10% of BW as fed) and reported weight gains of 3 kg. The NRC (2001) predicts these calves would gain >7 kg. Results reported by Jones et al. (2004) and those of this study suggest that feeding Jersey calves a 20% CP, 20% fat MR at 8 to 10% of BW supports only modest rates of ADG. Therefore, current NRC recommendations for small breed calves may be inadequate to support desired growth.",

Scibilia et al.

Calves on this trial were not subjected to temperatures below \u22124\u00b0C, but if they had been, then differences in body composition of calves may have been more pronounced between those fed higher vs. lower levels of dietary fat. Quigley et al. (1991) and Quigley (1996) reported that calves have elevated NEFA at weaning due to stress, which results in mobilization of body fat. Therefore, the low body fat percentage of calves fed 29/ 16 or 20/20 is a concern. More research is needed to determine the importance of body fat reserves to health and performance of the preweaned calf.",

Although calves fed 29/16 and 27/33 showed similar EBG, calves fed 29/16 did not increase body fat percentage. If one assumes that whole milk represents the desired standard optimum percentage of fat in a MR for Jersey calves fed 660 g of powder per d, the concentration should be greater than 16%, but less than 33%. Feeding Jersey bull calves a 20/20 MR at 15% of BW is not advisable given that growth of these calves was inferior to other diets in feed efficiency, ADG, and total weight gain. That all calves grew less than expected in near thermoneutral conditions suggests that nutrient requirements and, more specifically, maintenance requirements for small breed calves may be underestimated.",
