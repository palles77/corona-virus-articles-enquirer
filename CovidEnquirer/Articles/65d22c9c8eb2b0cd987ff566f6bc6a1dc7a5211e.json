Intracellular retention of orf7a does not require other viral proteins. When an orf7a cDNA is used to transiently transfect 293T cells, very little orf7a can be detected at the cell surface using 2E11 (G). Again, saponin pretreatment allowed staining of the intracellular orf7a (H). Addition of a C-terminal GFP tag did not significantly alter this intracellular distribution. A good colocalization was observed between orf7a staining (red) and GFP fluorescence (green) in this transfectant ([I] and [J]"

A significant number of viral accessory proteins have been found to be critical for the evasion of host-mediated immunity, interfering with diverse processes, including apoptosis, complement activation, cytokine signaling, and innate and adaptive immune surveillance (Alcami and Koszinowski, 2000; Ploegh, 1998). While many of these proteins act at the plasma membrane or are secreted from infected cells, others have been found to operate within ",

            "section": "by cDNA transfection, a small amount of E is sufficient to trigger the formation of virus-like particles (Bos et al., 1996; Vennema et al., 1996). It is still unclear what makes the M and E proteins gather in the ERGIC during infection (Lontok et al., 2004). When expressed individually, both move past the virus-assembly site (Corse and Machamer, 2002; Swift and Machamer, 1991). Two other coronavirus proteins integrate into the budding membrane: the S protein and, in the subset of coronaviruses that express it, the hemagglutinin-esterase (HE) protein. Both localize to the pre-Golgi by forming specific interactions with M (Nguyen and Hogue, 1998). If SARS-CoV buds into the ERGIC as other coronaviruses do, then our data indicate that orf7a traffics through the budding compartment. It is conceivable that orf7a may play a role in viral assembly or budding events unique to SARS-CoV. In support of this idea, Tan et al. have presented coimmunoprecipitation data suggesting an interaction between orf7a and the product of another SARS-CoV accessory gene, ORF3a, a protein which in turn interacts with the structural proteins M, E, and S (Tan et al., 2004). Alternatively, orf7a may itself be packaged into virions, possibly to serve as a secondary attachment protein in a manner analogous to HE. So far, studies aimed at identifying the structural proteins of the SARS-CoV virion have failed to detect orf7a (Krokhin et al., 2003; Ying et al., 2004), although it is worth noting that these methods also have failed to detect the virion-associated E protein. We tested whether our anti-orf7a monoclonal antibodies could block the production of virus or its cytopathic effects in SARS-CoV-infected Vero cells. However, no neutralization effect was observed (data not shown)."
