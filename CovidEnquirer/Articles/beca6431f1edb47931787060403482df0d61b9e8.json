            "text": "Over the past few years, the tourism industry has been seriously undermined by the growing lack of safety and security. This factor has been identified as one of the five forces causing changes in the tourism sector in the new millennium. Crime, terrorism, food safety, health issues, and natural disasters are the main areas of concern. However, these issues only started to gain more visibility after the September 11 events. Terrorist attacks have also been experienced in other parts of the world and they are pushing the travel industry to deal with a major travel paradigm shift, which is based on the fact that tourism security is now a key concern for travelers. It is now widely accepted by the international community that the success of the tourist industry in a particular country or region is directly linked to its ability to offer tourists a safe and pleasant visit. Governments, travel agents, and news media periodically issue warnings about the risks associated with international tourism. Tourists are urged to buy guidebooks and obtain vaccinations as precautions against such risks.",

            "text": "For quite a long time the influence of safety and security for tourism had been ignored in the literature, particularly the issue of safety in the destination country as a determinant of tourism demand. Tourism literature is now turning its attention to matters of safety and security, which were classified among the ten most important world tourism issues for 2004. Previous research has pointed out four major risk factors: crime (de Albuquerque and McElroy, 1999; Alleyne and Boxill, 2003; Barker, Page, and Meyer, 2002; Barker, Page, and Meyer, 2003; Brunt, Mawby, and Hambly, 2000; Dimanche and Lepetic, 1999; George, 2003; Lepp and Gibson, 2003; Levantis and Gani, 2000; Lindqvist and Bj\u00f6rk, 2000; Mawby, 2000; Roehl and Fesenmaker, 1992) ; health-related risks (Cartwright, 2000; MacLaurin, 2001; MacLaurin, MacLaurin, and Loi, 2000) ; terrorism (Coshall, 2003; Kuto and Groves, 2004; Leslie, 1999; Pizam and Fleischer, 2002; Pizam and Smith, 2000; S\u00f6nmez, 1998; S\u00f6nmez, Apostolopoulos, and Tarlow, 1999; S\u00f6nmez and Graefe, 1998; Tarlow, 2003) ; and war and political instability (Ioannides and Apostolopoulos, 1999; Neumayer, 2004; Richter, 1999; Weaver, 2000) . Concern for crime and safety, whether real or perceived, has been clearly identified as adversely affecting tourism behavior, influencing destination choice and experience satisfaction. Political instability and war can increase the perception of risk at a destination. Similarly, terrorism can cause a profound impact on destination image. Health hazards are also regarded as potential issues that can undermine tourism development. All disasters can divert tourism flows away from affected destinations, but war, terrorism, or political instability have a much greater negative psychological effect on potential tourists when planning their vacations (Cavlek, 2002) . This applies not only to the time of crisis, but also to the period following it.",

Since safety and security directly influence decisions in international travel, this chapter researches the consequences of relevant events that have caused major disturbances in inbound tourism in the PRC, namely the Tiananmen Square incident and the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS). In addition to these two main issues, which until now were the only ones capable of deterring China's booming domestic and international tourism industry, other important issues will be discussed. Other epidemic diseases (such as HIV/AIDS, avian influenza, and mosquito-borne diseases); crime directed at foreigners in major cities and tourist areas; road and air safety; natural disasters (earthquakes, flooding, and typhoons); crossstrait relations; and restrictions on public demonstrations, political, and religious activities constitute important considerations that will be also addressed throughout the chapter.",

Although these do not constitute scholarly works, they convey the impressions of professional travel observers and are widely disseminated among prospective travelers, playing a large part in the creation of a destination image. Although nowadays there is no lack of travel guides, the present work has focused on Lonely Planet because it is one of the best-selling English-language guidebooks, and it was the first to be published on China (the next guide to be published on China-The Rough Guide-wasn't published until 13 years later). Lonely Planet's first edition was issued in October 1984, six years after the country's opening up to international tourism, targeting primarily budget and independent English-speaking travelers, particularly young people. The comparison between Lonely Planet's first edition (hereafter referred to interchangeably as the first edition or the 1984 edition) and the latest edition (the 8th, published in August 2002) is very useful to identify the consumer image of China's safety and security evolution over the past 18 years.",

The 8th edition expanded on the health risks section, but was more reassuring. It noted that although China had particular health hazards and that some problems can be encountered in isolated areas, it is a healthier place to travel to compared to other parts of the world. Sexually transmitted diseases, with special attention given to HIV/AIDS, were pointed out as something that foreigners should be cautious about, due to the fact that they are becoming more widespread in China.",

Foreigners were pointed out as natural targets for pickpockets and thieves, with certain cities, like Guangzhou, Guiyang, and Xi'an, as the most notorious examples of this type of crime. High-risk places were mainly train and bus stations. Nevertheless, some more violent crimes, with foreigners being attacked or even killed for their valuables, were reported in more rural locations, thereby stressing that individual traveling to those areas should be regarded as at high risk.

The old dual-pricing system for foreigners was identified in the 2002 edition as fundamentally racist. This discriminatory pricing was exemplified in the 1984 edition, referring several times to the higher costs charged to foreigners.",

Overseas Chinese (holders of a Chinese passport who reside outside China in countries or regions other than Taiwan, Macao, and Hong Kong) or compatriots (visitors from Taiwan, Macao, and Hong Kong) were frequently refused service, or given poor service (anyway the quality was generally low, as employees had very little knowledge of international standards), just because they paid less than foreign visitors. Foreign visitors, on the other hand, often felt embarrassed and annoyed by their preferential treatment (Zhang, 1995) .",

The hard-line communist leaders' way of thinking that characterized the Cultural Revolution period had fostered anti-foreign sentiments, resulting in foreigners in China being insulted and badly treated. Under the new government's kowtowing policy foreigners received special treatment, while the government relegated its citizens to an inferior condition (Richter, 1983) . The campaign against \"spiritual pollution\" from the West was launched in China in the mid-1980s, but it did not affect tourism, as the attack on spiritual pollution was deliberately kept as a low key internal affair, and most tourists were quite unaware of it (Lynn, 1993) . Nonetheless, the ambivalent Chinese attitude toward foreigners has naturally affected how they handle tourists. As a 1930s writer once said, \"throughout the ages, Chinese have had only two ways of looking at foreigners, up to them as superior beings or down on them as wild animals. They have never been able to treat them as friends, to consider them as people like themselves\" (quoted in Richter, 1989, p. 32 ).",

With the aim of acquiring a broad picture of the nature of those concerns, research was conducted in order to identify what type of information had been released to travelers to China in each world region. Government organizations, as well as some international agencies, were the main source of information regarding potential disruptions to tourism in China. Although nine countries were firstly considered as significant to analyze (Japan, USA, UK, Canada, Malaysia, Korea, Germany, Russia, and Australia), it was soon realized that only English-speaking countries, with the exception of Japan, had such information available to their citizens on the Tourism Security and Safety: From Theory to Practice Internet, which is a useful and rapid way to disseminate information. As tourists tend to be better informed about destinations prior to their trip, travel advisories issued by competent entities are of crucial significance. The facts presented below are thus based on the information collected from travel advisories issued by governmental agencies (the content of those warnings was found to be very similar), thus permitting the construction of an image of China's safety and security situation, and how it is regarded by its main tourist-generating markets.

Nonetheless, there is always the risk of indiscriminate attacks against civilian targets in public places, including tourist sites. These bombings are often the result of commercial disputes among Chinese. It is true that terrorist attacks are also common, many of which have been linked to the Eastern Turkistan Islamic Movement (ETIM), also known as the Xinjiang-Uyghur separatist movement. ETIM was designated a terrorist organization by the United Nations in 2002 and is currently active in the Xinjiang Autonomous Region. Xinjiang is largely constituted by Muslim Turkic-speaking minorities (Uygurs, Kazakhas, Kirghizs, and Uzbeks) and there has been ethnic tension between these four groups and the Han people for quite a long time.

Overall, China is a safe country, with a low but increasing crime rate. Serious crimes against foreigners are rare. Nevertheless, crime does occur both in Chinese cities and in the countryside. Crime directed at foreigners is becoming more frequent in major cities and at tourist sites, which attract thieves and pickpockets. Robberies and attacks on foreigners in popular expatriate bar and nightclub areas in Beijing and Shanghai, and in the shopping district of Shenzhen, are common. Minor thefts and sexual harassment on overnight trains and buses tend also to occur. The most remote areas of China are poorly policed and there is the risk of attack from armed bandits. In Yunnan, drug smuggling and related crimes are increasing. Money exchange on the black market at better rates is frequent in China.

In general, many accidents occur, some of them serious, resulting from the poor quality of roads, the often chaotic traffic, and the generally low driving standards (although driving etiquette in China is progressing). Safety standards in public transportation differ from those in the West as well; child safety seats and seat belts are not widely available. Pedestrians and cyclists, if not cautious, are also at risk while near traffic. They are frequently involved in collisions or encounter unexpected road hazards. In fact, it is not unusual to see a pedestrian or a cyclist on a sidewalk being hit by a car or bus driving in the wrong lane. Air accidents have been reported on internal flights, mainly in routes to the north and east of Beijing. Nonetheless, the US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) has assessed the Chinese civil aviation authority as Category 1, which means that it complies with international aviation safety standards for overseeing China's air carrier operations. Similarly, there have been several incidents of overcrowded ferries sinking, resulting in the loss of lives. Attacks of piracy in the South China Sea should also be regarded as a threat to yachting safety.",

As moral support for the democratic demonstrators in China, tourists cancelled their already scheduled trips or put off their travel plans to a later date. (Yu, 1992, p. 11) The drastic decline in the number of tourists was evident at Beijing's joint-venture hotels, where all hotels reduced both their Chinese and expatriate staffs, and most remaining employees were working at some 65% of their normal wage package (Breda, 2002) . It was also estimated that 620,000 tourism workers underwent compulsory political indoctrination aiming \"to cleanse their socialist minds, deepen their love of the Communist Party, and, alarmingly, to cultivate their suspicions of foreigners\" (Hall, 1994, p. 123) .",

Second, there was insufficient medical information on SARS and great uncertainty over the nature of the disease. The lack of accurate, timely, and transparent provision of information on the nature and extent of SARS increased the public's fears, caused second-guessing, and naturally led to an exaggerated perception about the danger of the disease.

Tourism was thus especially affected by the SARS-induced panic (McKercher and Chon, 2004) . Even some destinations that had not recorded any cases of infection suffered almost as much as the areas actually affected. The rapid and wide geographical spread of the disease by travelers, cases of transmission during hotel stays, in restaurants, places of entertainment, or even during airplane trips, made SARS a phenomenon that was perceived to be linked with tourism itself.",

It is vulnerable to variations in politics and economics, as well as any major change in policy or ideology, and these changes can significantly modify its development process. However, until now there is no evidence that China might want to change its reform and open-door policy; on the contrary, major policies within the tourism sector show a greater openness to the outside world. The increased dependence on tourism as a source of economic growth also shows that it would be extremely difficult for China to halt tourism development.

Particularly, regression analysis was used to develop equations to estimate the number of arrivals in 2003. The dependent variable, the yearly total number of visitors from a particular source, was modeled as a function of time. In all cases the linear trend was statistically significant at the 0.95 confidence level; thus, the derived equation was used to estimate arrivals in 2003.Table 2shows estimates of the impact of SARS on tourist arrivals in China from selected countries in 2003. If the growth trend in foreign arrivals had continued through 2003, the total number of visitors in China would have been nearly 15 million (as estimated by the regression of total foreign visitors against time, R 2 = 0.99), which means that foreign visitors registered 3 million fewer arrivals. Overall, in 11 of the 12 selected countries, when estimated arrivals for 2003 are compared to actual arrivals, the decline is greater than when arrivals in 2002 are used to estimate what should have happened in 2003. Similarly, regression results suggest that in 2003 China received 9 million fewer compatriot visitors than would have otherwise been expected. When applying the same model to compare estimated international tourism receipts (21,998.1 million US$) with actual receipts (17,396.0 million US$) in 2003, it reveals that the impact of SARS was greater than just comparing it to 2002 values (4,602.1 against 1,613.1 million US$).",
