            "text": "A 48 kDa, chitin-binding lectin with antifungal, antiviral and apoptosis-inducing activities was isolated from the rhizomes of Setcreasea purpurea Boom, a member of family Commelinaceae. Setcreasea purpurea lectin (designated as SPL) is a homotetrameric protein consisting of 12031.9 Da subunits linked by noncovalent bonds as determined by SDS-PAGE, gel filtration and MS. The N-terminal 25 amino-acid sequence of SPL, NVLGRDAYCGSQNPGATCPGLCCSK was determined and homology analysis suggested that SPL belongs to the family of chitin-binding plant lectins composed of hevein domains. The lectin exhibited strong hemagglutinating activity towards rabbit erythrocytes at 0.95 g/ml and the activity could be reversed exclusively by chitin hydrolysate (oligomers of GlcNAc). Its hemagglutinating activity was stable in pH range of 2.0-9.0 and it showed excellent thermal tolerance. SPL showed antifungal activity against Rhizoctonia solani, Sclerotinia sclerotiorum, Penicillium italicum and Helminthosporiun maydis. It also exhibited inhibitory effect on HIV-1 (IIIB) and HIV-2 (ROD), with an EC 50 of 13.8 \u00b1 1.3 and 57.1 \u00b1 15 g/ml, respectively. Subsequently, MTT method, cell morphological analysis and LDH activity-based cytotoxicity assays demonstrated that SPL was highly cytotoxic to CNE-1 cells and induced apoptosis in a dosedependent manner. Moreover, due to the caspase inhibitors analyses, caspase was also found to play an important role in the potential apoptotic mechanism of SPL.",

The family of chitinbinding lectins comprises all lectins possessing chitin-binding and/or GlcNAc/GlcNAc oligomer activities and containing at least one hevein domain. The term 'hevein domain' refers to hevein, a small 43 amino-acid protein from the latex of the rubber tree [3] . It should be noted that there are also chitin-binding lectins without hevein domain(s). For example, the Cucurbitaceae phloem lectins are a small family of chitin-binding agglutinins only found in the phloem exudate of Cucurbitaceae species and show no sequence similarity to the hevein-like chitin-binding lectins [3] . Since the first hevein-like chitin-binding lectin, WGA (wheat germ agglutinin) from Triticum aestivum L. was reported in 1972 [9, 10] , more chitin-binding lectins have been found. The lectins are widespread in the Gramineae and Solanaceae species and also found in roots and leaves of Phytolacca sp. seeds and rhizomes of Urtica dioica, seeds of Chelidonium majus, and in green tissues of Viscum album [3] .",

However, there are very few mass fingerprinting peptides from lectins in databanks and the successful protein identification of peptide mass fingerprintings depends on several factors, such as the sequence coverage obtained, protein/genomic sequence database size, the choice of proteolytic enzyme [44] , so peptide mass fingerprintings analysis is not remarkable enough to identify this lectin. To further identify this lectin, the N-terminal sequence of 25 amino-acid residues was determined and compared with several typical hevein-like chitin-binding lectins. The homology both in terms of amino-acid sequences and highly conserved cysteine residues suggested that SPL belongs to the family of chitinbinding plant lectins composed of hevein domains. Additionally, hevein-like chitin-binding lectins are widespread in the Gramineae family and typical lectins have been characterized from all species of the tribe Triticeae, the genera Brachypodium and Oryza, Agropyrum repens (couch grass) and Phragmites australis [3] . Setcreasea purpurea Boom is not a member of Gramineae family but a member of Commelinaceae family. However, it should be noted that both Commelinaceae and Gramineae family belong to the same Commelinidae subclassis, so Setcreasea purpurea may be considered a distant relative of the plants in Gramineae family. Thus, this chitin-binding lectin obtained from Setcreasea purpurea Boom may further reveal that the hevein-like chitin-binding lectins are relatively distributed in some species.",

Chitin is a naturally occurring polysaccharide composed of \u2424 (1 \u2192 4) linked N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) monomers that form a complex supermolecular structure [8] . Since GlcNAc is the basic element of chitin, some chitin-binding lectins showed specificity for Glc-NAc, such as Gramineae lectins and tomato lectins [3] . However, GlcNAc was not specific to SPL, which could only be inhibited by chitin hydrolysate (oligomers of GlcNAc). This feature also appears to UDA (Urtica dioica lectin) [34] , CBL3 (Cyphomandra betacea lectin) [45] and some other chitin-binding lectins. It is worth noting that the chitin-binding lectins, such as VisalbCBA (Viscum album lectin) and WGA (Wheat germ agglutinin) [3, 36] , though can be inhibited by both glcNAc and GlcNAc oligomers, the results showed that the GlcNAc oligomers were inhibitorier than glcNAc. It is confirmed that the sugar-binding activity and specificity of the chitin-binding lectins are determined exclusively by their hevein domains and the carbohydrate-binding sites of them have a complex structure that is most complementary to the trimer or tetramer of GlcNAc [3] . So this is capable of explaining why SPL was not inhibited by GlcNAc but could be strongly inhibited by chitin hydrolysate (oligomers of GlcNAc).",

Another chitin-binding protein, Hevein, also inhibits several chitin-containing fungi and is a more potent inhibitor than chitinase for several fungi [35] . In this present, SPL exhibited antifungal activity towards four phytopathogenic harmful fungi with quantitatively tested results, though to a somewhat lesser extent than UDA (Urtica dioica lectin) [35] . It is widely acknowledged that chitin or chitin oligomers and some other saccharides are important components of most fungal cell walls. Since SPL is a chitin-binding lectin, the antifungal mechanism of it may relate to its carbohydrate-binding property. The antifungal activity of SPL also appeared to be thermal tolerance, still possessing some activity by treatments of high temperatures, which was analogous with the hevein [35] . In view of the antifungal activity and excellent stability of SPL, it can be a potent candidate in plant genetic engineering for breeding antifungal plants.",

A number of galactose-, N-acetylgalactosamine-(N-GalNAc-), N-acetylglucosamine-(N-GlcNAc-) and glucose-specific plant agglutinines exhibited anticoronaviral activity as well [14, 47] . It is confirmed that the chitin-binding lectins isolated from Urtica dioica and from the tobacco plant are markedly active against the SARS-CoV [14] . In this study, SPL exhibited a suppressive action on HIV-1, HIV-2 and reproducible antiviral effect was observed. It is indicated that though the mannose-specific plant lectins are highly effective against HIV, some chitin-binding lectins, such as UDA (Urtica dioica lectin), also possesses anti-HIV activity [14, 48] . It should be emphasized that SPL is another chitin-binding lectin that is against HIV, although the anti-HIV activity of SPL is not so remarkable when compared with other known lectins, such as Polygonatum cyrtonema lectin [40] . It is possible that plant lectins with different specificity interfere with different targets necessary for viral entry, depending on the place of the glycans that are targeted [49] . As to HIV, it was recently indicated that plant lectins with different carbohydrate specificities (mannose-specific or N-GlcNAc-specific), represent carbohydrate-binding agents with a similar mode of antiviral action, but with different genetic barriers [49] . Therefore, the antiviral activity against HIV of SPL may be well associated with its N-GlcNAc-specificity.",

The antineoplastic activity is also known in chitin-binding lectins, such as STL (Solanum tuberosum lectin) and WGA (Wheat germ agglutinin) [13] . WGA, a representative chitin-binding lectin, was highly toxic to human pancreatic carcinoma cells in vitro, with high levels of membrane binding to sialic acid residues and lectin internalization. Studies also reported the effect of WGA on lymphoma cell survival and found that it restricted tumour growth when compared with the control [50, 53] . Our investigation confirmed that SPL, a new member of the chitin-binding lectin family, also possessed an obvious cytotoxic effect on CNE-1 cells (a well differentiated human nasopharyngeal carcinoma cells) and induced apoptosis in a timeand dose-dependent manner.",

            "text": "The apoptosis is an evolutionary conserved process that plays a crucial role in metazoan development [50, 54] . Therefore, if the molecules or pathways of apoptosis required to suppress the tumorigenesis are identified, apoptosis modulation can emerge as a new target for cancer therapy [50] . It is suggested that the sugar-binding part as well as the other part of the lectin molecule is responsible for the apoptosis-inducing activity [13] . ConA, the firstly reported legume lectin, is cytotoxic or strongly inhibitory to some tumor cells, which has been found to induce A375 cell death in a caspase-dependent manner as well as through a mitochondrial apoptotic pathway [55] . Polygonatum cyrtonema lectin and Polygonatum odoratum lectin, typical mannose-binding lectins, has also been found to induce apoptosis and autophagy in tumor cells through mitochondria-mediated pathways [56, 57] . As to SPL, we found a typical caspase-dependent apoptosis through participation of three caspase inhibitors, expecially the effects of caspase-3 and caspase-8 inhibitors. However, the apoptotic mechanisms of actions of chitin-binding lectins are not as clear-cut as some mannose-binding lectins or legume lectins, so the further research ought to be focused on elucidating the details of apoptotic mechanisms of this lectin.",
