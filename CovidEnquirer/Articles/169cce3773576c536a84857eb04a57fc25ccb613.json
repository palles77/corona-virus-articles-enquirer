            "text": "The objectives of this study were to investigate colostrum feeding practices and colostrum quality on commercial grassland-based dairy farms, and to identify factors associated with colostrum quality that could help inform the development of colostrum management protocols. Over 1 yr, background information associated with dairy calvings and colostrum management practices were recorded on 21 commercial dairy farms. Colostrum samples (n = 1,239) were analyzed for fat, protein, lactose, and IgG concentration. A subset was analyzed for somatic cell count and total viable bacteria count. Factors associated with nutritional and IgG concentrations were determined using both univariate and multivariate models. This study found that 51% of calves were administered their first feed of colostrum via esophageal tube, and the majority of calves (80%) were fed >2 L of colostrum at their first feed (mean = 2.9 L, SD = 0.79), at a mean time of 3.2 h (SD 4.36) after birth, but this ranged across farms. The mean colostral fat, protein, and lactose percentages and IgG concentrations were 6.4%, 14%, 2.7%, and 55 mg/mL, respectively. The mean somatic cell count and total viable count were 6.3 log 10 and 6.1 log 10 , respectively. Overall, 44% of colostrum samples contained <50 mg/mL IgG, and almost 81% were in excess of industry guidelines (<100,000 cfu/mL) for bacterial contamination. In the multivariate model, IgG concentration was associated with parity and time from parturition to colostrum collection. The nutritional properties of colostrum were associated with parity, prepartum vaccination, season of calving, and dry cow nutrition. The large variation in colostrum quality found in the current study highlights the importance of routine colostrum testing, and now that factors associated with lower-quality colostrum on grassland-based dairy farms have been identified, producers and advisers are better informed and able to develop risk-based colostrum management protocols.",

            "text": "Colostrum is the first secretion produced from the bovine mammary gland postcalving (Jaster, 2005) . It is composed of a range of compounds that are rich in nutritional, antimicrobial, and growth properties and are essential for stimulating cellular and humoral immune defense systems that the newborn calf needs to survive (Blum and Hammon, 2000) . Colostrum contains 3 major immunoglobulin isotypes-IgG, IgA, and IgM-and a range of subclasses. Immunoglobulin G antibody is the most abundant isotype found in colostrum; it represents over 75% of the total Ig concentration (Korhonen et al., 2000) , and consequently the quality of colostrum is assessed with reference to the concentration of this specific immunoglobulin class. Calves are born with a functional immune system, but it is considered naive until it is fully developed (Franklin et al., 2003) . Calves will acquire adequate immunocompetence only through passive transfer of immunoglobulins from colostrum. However, absorption of immunoglobulins ceases 24 h after birth (Stott et al., 1979) , and the quality of colostrum can vary between animals due to a number of physical and environmental factors (Quigley and Drewry, 1998) . Previous research has determined that colostrum is of satisfactory quality if it contains >50 mg/mL of IgG (McGuirk and Collins, 2004) .",

The test was performed on colostrum that had the fat removed though centrifuging before freezing. All kit components were brought to 21\u00b0C before use. The wash buffer was diluted 20-fold with distilled water. A calibration curve was developed as per the manufacturer's instructions (BioX, Jemelle, Belgium). The samples were diluted in PBS, and the diluted samples were added to the test plate and incubated at 21\u00b0C for 1 h. The test plate was washed 3 times with the wash buffer, and then chromogen solution (100 \u03bcL) was added to each well and incubated away from light for approximately 10 min. Stop solution (50 \u03bcL) was then added to each well. The optical densities were recorded using a microplate spectrophotometer with a 450-nm filter (Tecan, Magellan, Switzerland), and the concentration of IgG in samples was calculated from the standard reference curve containing known concentrations of IgG provided in the test kit. Any sample that resulted in an IgG concentration above or below the range of the standard reference curve was retested after further dilution according to the test kit recommendations.

Farm was fitted as a random effect, and the explanatory variables as fixed effects. We tested the following variables for association with IgG, fat, protein, and lactose concentration: herd size, season of calving, calving difficulty score (1 to 5), calving location, breed, parity, estimated live weight of cow precalving (kg), BCS at calving (1 to 5 scale), length of dry period (wk), first colostrum yield (L), sec-ond colostrum yield (L), immunization regimen (bovine viral diarrhea, leptospirosis, Salmonella, Escherichia coli, rotavirus, coronavirus, and clostridial disease), dry cow nutrition, description of supplements offered to dry cows, time interval from calving to colostrum collection (h), colostral TVC (cfu/mL), colostral SCC (10 3 /mL), and previous 305-d milk yield (kg). For each response variable, we developed a multivariate model to examine more complex associations, again using the linear mixed model methodology with farm as a random effect in all models. Any explanatory variable that had a P-value <0.15 from the REML analysis and a minimum of 900 observations was considered a candidate for the multivariate models. The multivariate analysis was also restricted to a subset of units that had a non-missing value for all variables. In each case, we used backward elimination to establish the multivariate model. At each step, the least significant variable was removed from the model, and the procedure was terminated when all remaining variables were significant at P < 0.05.",

Likewise, dry cow diet was recorded as yes/no answers according to feed type (i.e., grass silage, concentrate, grazed grass, and straw).

            "text": "The variation in colostral IgG concentration observed across all 21 farms (Figure 1 ) was similar to previous reports (Gulliksen et al., 2008; Morrill et al., 2012) . Of colostrum samples in this current study, 44% contained <50 mg/mL IgG, and were therefore deemed unsatisfactory in terms of quality. Consequently, a sizable proportion of newborn calves from these herds were at increased risk of receiving colostrum of inadequate quality and experiencing failure of passive transfer (FPT). Taking into account the variations in IgG concentration, it may be relevant to consider how much colostrum a calf requires to achieve apparent passive transfer (APT). A recent study has suggested an intake of 150 to 200 g IgG (Chigerwe et al., 2012) to achieve APT. Using the equation described by Quigley (2001a), we can determine how much colostrum is required to meet the needs of the calf. This involves making assumptions in relation to BW (40 kg), apparent efficiency of absorption (26.4%), plasma volume (9% of BW), and plasma concentration (10 mg/mL). If calves were fed the historical recommendation of 2 L of colostrum, a colostral IgG concentration of 69 mg/ mL would be required to achieve APT. In the current study, 61% of calves would have experienced FPT if fed 2 L of colostrum. On average, in the current study, calves were fed 2.9 L of colostrum for their first feed. Calves fed 2.9 L of colostrum containing at least 50 mg/mL IgG would have achieved APT, but 39% of calves would have experienced FPT if fed this volume at their first feed based on the colostrum IgG concentration. To manage this risk, feeding 4 L of colostrum would result in only 19% of calves experiencing FPT. A number of management practices can have a positive influence on the colostrum quality produced, but it is unlikely that calves from cows that produce colostrum with IgG below 20 to 29 mg/mL will achieve APT, independent of management practice. As reported by others (Tyler et al., 1999; Morrill et al., 2012; Conneely et al., 2013) , we found that increased parity positively influenced colostrum IgG concentration. However, on average, primiparous dams produced colostrum of adequate IgG concentration (50.8 mg/mL), and 44% of animals in their first and second parity produced high-quality colostrum (>50 mg/mL IgG), at an average yield of 5.4 L at the first milking postpartum. Consequently, 72% of the cows in their first and second parity produced an adequate IgG yield to provide the calf with a minimum of 150 g of IgG to achieve APT. This indicates that primiparous colostrum should not be automatically discarded and should be tested for IgG concentration. This study also showed that 73% of colostrum samples from cows in their fifth or greater parity were deemed high quality. Previous research has suggested that this is related to increased antigenic exposure in older cows, so that a greater array of antibodies are transferred from bovine serum to the colostrum (Donovan et al., 1986) . In addition, the development of the mammary gland may have a role to play: younger cows may not be fully developed, and the transport of IgG into the mammary gland may be reduced (Devery-Pocius and Larson, 1983) .",

Therefore, reducing the time from calving to colostrum collection is a simple way for producers to positively influence the quality of colostrum fed to their calves and reduce the risk of FPT. Colostrum feeding method has been found to affect FPT; Besser et al. (1991) reported that the highest rate of FPT occurred when the calf was left to nurse the dam (61.4%), compared with bottle-feeding (19.3%) and using an esophageal tube (10.8%). In addition, Vasseur et al. (2010) found that 22% of Holstein calves 2 to 6 h old were unable to consume 2 L of colostrum from bottle-feeding. In this study, we observed that over 25% of calves were left to suckle the dam and 17% were bottle-fed; to increase APT in calves, it may be necessary for farmers to use esophageal tubes.",

In agreement with others (Fecteau et al., 2002; Swan et al., 2007) , we found extremely high levels of bacterial contamination in the colostrum samples. It has been suggested that the bacteriological quality of maternal colostrum is influenced by storage method and management practices (Stewart et al., 2005; Houser et al., 2008) . We speculate that this may be the reason for the high bacterial contamination in this study. To avoid the risk of feeding pathogenic bacteria to naive calves best practice guidelines must be in place for producers to help prevent bacterial contamination of colostrum. One such practice is heat-treating, which has been shown by Elizondo-Salazar et al. (2010) to reduce bacteria levels: heating colostrum at 60\u00b0C for 30 or 60 min reduced the bacterial load.",

As suggested by Quigley et al. (2001b) , calves fed colostrum that is low in protein may have a reduced ability to achieve glucogenesis during the first 24 h of life. This metabolic process is essential in neonatal calves to produce glucose (Hammon et al., 2013) , which is necessary to provide a source of energy for the brain (Zierler, 1999) . Similar to IgG concentration, colostral protein concentration improved as parity increased, but this was expected, because IgG is a protein (Parrish et al., 1950) . Cows that calved in the winter produced 9 g/L more protein than spring-calving cows, but several factors tend to differ across seasons, including diet (Heck et al., 2009; Yasmin et al., 2012) , housing, and climate (Nardone et al., 1997; Cabral et al., 2016) . Dams immunized against infectious bovine rhinotracheitis before calving produced 11 g/L more protein than nonvaccinated cows. It is currently unknown why immunization is associated with the nutritional components of colostrum; this points to a need for further research.",

In comparison, Shoshani et al. (2014) reported that cows dry for 60 d had increased fat levels in their milk during the first month of lactation cows that were dry for only 40 d. In our study, heifers produced 22 g/L more fat than cows in parity 5+, in agreement with Morrill et al. (2012) . Limited research has been conducted into the effect of dry cow nutrition on colostrum nutritional properties. In the current study, we found a relationship between colostral fat concentration and cow diet at 7 to 9 wk before parturition. Lerch et al. (2015) found that a high-energy/high-protein diet may result in the mobilization of body reserves and affect colostral nutritional composition.",

In this study, we found that colostrum lactose concentration was negatively correlated (P < 0.001) with IgG concentration (R 2 = 0.34). Thus, increased lactose concentration may have a dilution effect and may result in reduced IgG concentration. This was likely related to the increase in lactose synthesis that occurs with time after parturition and related to a water dilution effect lowering IgG concentration.",

Colostrum IgG concentration averaged 55 mg/mL, with increased parity and sample collection earlier after parturition associated with the greatest IgG concentrations. Parity, prepartum vaccination, season of calving, and dry cow nutrition all affected the nutritional composition of colostrum. The results of this study also highlighted significant levels of bacterial contamination in colostrum, much greater than industry guidelines and an area for further investigation. Improvements should be made in colostrum feeding practices to reduce the number of calves left to suckle the dam and to feed a greater quantity of colostrum as soon as possible after birth. Because APT of immunity to the newborn is associated with the timing, volume, and quality of the colostrum offered to the calf, the findings from this study indicate the importance of measuring colostrum quality and highlight risk factors that dairy producers and advisers should consider when drawing up best practice management guidelines for colostrum management.",
