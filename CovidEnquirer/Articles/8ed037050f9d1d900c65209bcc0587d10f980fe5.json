            "text": "Background: Rhinoviruses (RVs) may cause pneumonia, but the characteristics of RV-associated pneumonia have not been adequately evaluated. Objective: We aimed to compare characteristics, complications, and outcomes between severe RV-and influenza virus (IFV)-associated pneumonia in adults. Study design: We used prospective cohort data of adult patients with severe pneumonia who had been admitted to the medical intensive care unit of a tertiary care hospital over a 4-year period. The clinical features and outcomes of 27 patients with RV-positive bronchoscopic bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid were compared to those of 51 pneumonia patients with IFV-positive BAL fluid or IFV-positive nasopharyngeal specimens. Results: Of 356 patients who underwent bronchoscopic BAL and respiratory virus polymerase chain reaction (PCR), RV was the most commonly identified virus (8.1%) from BAL fluid. Patients with RV-associated pneumonia were more likely to be immunocompromised than patients with IFV-associated pneumonia (81.5% vs. 33.3%, p < 0.001). Bacterial coinfection tended to be less common in the RV group (18.5% vs. 37.3%, p = 0.09). Although septic shock was less common in the RV group (29.6% vs. 54.9%, p = 0.03), other clinical manifestations, laboratory findings, and radiologic patterns were similar between the groups. The 28-day mortality of patients with severe RV-and IFV-associated pneumonia was similarly high (29.6% vs. 35.3% respectively, p = 0.61). Conclusions: Severe RV-associated pneumonia patients were more likely to be immunocompromised and less likely to present septic shock. Overall clinical features were similar and mortalities of both groups were comparably high. Studies of larger cohorts encompassing mild to moderate pneumonia patients are needed.",

            "text": "RV is a non-enveloped, non-segmented single-strand RNA virus of the genus Enterovirus and the family Picornaviridae [1] . In adults, RVs are a predominant etiology of upper respiratory tract infections, also known as 'common colds', and are frequently associated with exacerbation of asthma [2] and COPD [3] . RVs' ability to reach and infect the lower respiratory tract epithelium has been demonstrated recently [4] [5] [6] [7] , and the link between RV and pneumonia has gained recent attention [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . However, the role of RV in the pathogenesis of pneumonia remains controversial. Histopathological examination of lung tissue specimens, including in situ hybridization of RV RNA, would be helpful to establish the role of RVs in pneumonia development. However, such examination is rarely possible in clinical practice. A prior report suggests that RVs infect a small subset of lower airway epithelial cells [7] and activate marked inflammatory responses, rather than directly invade lower airways in the lower respiratory tract epithelium [13] [14] [15] . Therefore, RV detection using bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid specimens from severe pneumonia patients may be an indirect but meaningful indicator for the pathogenic role of RV. However, clinical data using BAL specimens from unselected adult patients with RV-associated pneumonia are scarce [10, 16, 17] , with some studies investigating small subsets of a retrospective series of respiratory virus infection [16, 17] . The majority of prior studies using BAL specimens were confined to small groups of hematopoietic stem cell transplant patients [12, [18] [19] [20] , which limits our understanding of RV-associated pneumonia.",

The main characteristics of these cases are summarized in supplementary Table 1 . All of the prior reports included small number of cases, most of which, with the exception of a report from a tertiary care hospital in U.S.A [10] , occurred in severely immunocompromised patients. This group retrospectively reviewed clinical features of 20 patients (including three children) who had RV cultured from their BAL over a 10-year period. Twelve (60.0%) needed mechanical ventilation. In-hospital mortality was relatively low (25.0%), which may be due to the lower frequency of severe immunocompromised conditions, such as hematopoietic stem cell transplant, in their patients. Notably, our study included five non-immunocompromised patients, two of which had underlying COPD and one who had undergone recent surgery. Another two elderly patients had no underlying illness or identifiable copathogen, suggesting that RV may be the sole cause of severe pneumonia in non-immunocompromised elderly patients.",

            "text": "Bacterial coinfection is a well-known complication of severe or fatal IFV infection, with reported rates of 18-55% [28] . The two most common bacterial co-pathogens, S. aureus and S. pneumoniae, are common colonizers of the nasopharynx [29] [30] [31] . In the present study, bacterial coinfection tended to be less frequent in the RV group than in the IFV group, and S. aureus was exclusively identified in the IFV group. Bacterial coinfection in influenza infection is likely caused by IFV propagation along the respiratory tree, together with mucociliary clearance impairment and IFV-induced respiratory tract epithelial cell damage [28] . By contrast, RVs involve only a small proportion of epithelial cells in the upper [32] and lower airway epithelium [7] . Therefore, the lower frequency of bacterial coinfection and septic shock may be due to the reduced extent of epithelial damage with RV infection. Since our study used different inclusion criteria for the two groups and included only patients with severe pneumonia admitted to medical ICU, the difference in the bacterial coinfection rate between the groups may have been biased. The proportion of individuals admitted to the ICU because of secondary bacterial pneumonia rather than viral pneumonia may be higher in the IFV group. Bacterial coinfection is a key cause of death in 20th century influenza pandemics [29, 30] , and bacterial coinfection was also associated with an increased risk of death in 2009 pandemic influenza A/H1N1 (pH1N1) [31, 33] . In our results, however, bacterial coinfection was not associated with poorer outcomes in either IFV group or RV group, although the small numbers in our group may limit the generalizability of our findings and warrant further investigation.",

Recently, a U.S. group compared the characteristics between 2009 pH1N1 and other respiratory viruses in patients hospitalized with respiratory illness [34] and found that the presence of fever, cough, and gastrointestinal symptoms increased the likelihood of pH1N1 almost 10-fold in the pediatric population. Our study was limited to severe pneumonia patients admitted to the ICU, and more than two-thirds of both groups had respiratory symptoms. Therefore, a symptom-based approach is likely not reliable in differentiating clinical diagnoses among adult patients with severe pneumonia. The seasonal distribution of each respiratory virus and the temporal occurrence of respiratory viral illness in the community may help predict viral pathogens. Nevertheless, PCR tests for respiratory viruses are reliable and should be included for etiological diagnosis in patients with severe pneumonia.",

Third, because we did not perform a molecular study for serogrouping and serotyping, the impact of RV species and strains could not be evaluated.
