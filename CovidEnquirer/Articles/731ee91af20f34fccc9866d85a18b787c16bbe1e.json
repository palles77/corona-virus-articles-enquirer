[23] [24] [25] However, the size distribution of airborne viral particles is rarely determined. Two mechanisms underlie the person-to-person transmission of viral infections of the respiratory system: exposure to large-droplet infectious nuclei that remain suspended in air for short periods, and exposure to small-particle infectious nuclei that can remain suspended in air for long periods. 26 Generally, large-particle aerosols are believed to account for viral transmission.",

In Taiwan, the predominant viruses isolated from patients with respiratory infections are enterovirus, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza A and B viruses, adenovirus, cytomegalovirus, herpes simplex virus-1, and parainfluenza virus. 27 Enterovirus causes herpangina, hand-foot-and-mouth disease, myocarditis, encephalitis, and death. RSV is the most common pathogen of the lower respiratory tract in infants 28 and a common cause of nosocomial infections in pediatric wards. 29 Influenza A and B viruses cause seasonal epidemics in Taiwan, especially in winter. 30 Adenovirus causes acute respiratory tract infections in children younger than 5 years of age and circulates throughout the year. 31 Further, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, a small bacterium, is a common pathogenic agent of community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in children and young adults. 32, 33 RSV has been detected in air samples collected at distances of 30 to 700 cm from the head of patients' beds, 34 and RNA analysis of such samples at distance of 700 cm from the bedside may be useful for identifying small RSV-containing particles in hospital wards. Moreover, ubiquitous objects (e.g., telephones, door knobs, tables, air filters, ventilators) in hospitals have been shown to harbor adenovirus, 35, 36 varicella-zoster virus, 37, 38 Staphylococcus aureus, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. 39 Few studies have investigated the concentrations of respiratory viruses and M pneumoniae aerosols in the rooms of pediatric wards. To provide more detailed information, we measured the concentrations of 4 respiratory viruses common in children (enterovirus, influenza A virus, RSV, and adenovirus) and M pneumoniae in air samples collected at 2 locations (relative to the head of the bed) in patient-occupied rooms in the pediatric wards of a university-affiliated hospital in northern Taiwan. We also inspected the objects in the pediatric ward rooms to determine whether they were contaminated.",

Adenovirus and M pneumoniae were detected in the air samples obtained at both the short and long distance relative to the head of the patient's bed. RSV was only detected at the short distance, and influenza A virus was only detected at the long distance. Surprisingly, there was no enterovirus RNA in the air samples or object surface swabs. The absence of enterovirus from the air samples indicates that the likelihood of air and/or droplet transmission of this virus was extremely low. Its absence from the objects in the rooms housing the children with enteroviral infections is most likely explained by our periodic disinfection of these rooms with a 0.5% sodium hypochlorite solution. Our detection of RSV RNA in air samples collected only at the short distance (60-180 cm) is at odds with a previous study showing RSV in air samples collected 30 to 700 cm from the head of the patients' beds. 34 Additionally, influenza A virus RNA was detected in 15% of the air samples obtained at the long distance but in no air samples obtained at the short distance. It is likely that differences in sampling flow rates, sampling durations at different distances, and the activities of the patients in the rooms affect the detection rates of these pathogens. To reduce the exposure risk of patients, their families, and healthcare workers, the ventilation system in pediatric wards should be maintained and inspected routinely. In our previous study, adenovirus and M pneumoniae were the most prevalent airborne pathogens in the pediatric outpatient department and emergency rooms. 41 In this study, aerosol particles containing adenovirus and M pneumoniae were also found in the ward rooms at the 2 locations tested. Collectively, these findings indicate that there is a risk of airborne or droplet transmission of both adenovirus and M pneumoniae in pediatric ward rooms.",

This study has 3 limitations. First, during collection of the air samples, the patients did not necessarily remain in bed, but sometimes walked about. Consequently, the short-distance samplings did not represent the potential ''droplet'' transmission mode, which was initially presumed, and the longdistance samplings did not represent the potential ''airborne'' transmission mode. Second, because the surfaces of the designated objects were sampled only once, rather before and after disinfection, we could not evaluate the effects of disinfection. Third, the number of patients enrolled and the number of pathogens examined were relatively small, and further studies should be conducted to allow definite conclusions.",
