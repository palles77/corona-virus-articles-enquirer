The fleas have a predilection for the ears where they can be found in clusters along the edges of the pinnae. The fleas are mobile and move between the environment and the host. Wild rabbit fleas are not usually found on pet rabbits. Spilopsyllus cuniculi is a small flea whose life cycle is influenced by the reproductive status of the host. Egg maturation is dependent on female reproductive hormones. Successful reproduction of the rabbit flea requires contact with a rabbit in late pregnancy or with a newborn nestling. Increased blood corticosteroid concentrations in late pregnancy attract fleas, which attach firmly to the doe to feed. Within a few hours of parturition, fleas move from the doe to the newborn babies to feed, copulate and lay eggs in the nest. The eggs hatch and the larvae feed on flea dirt deposited in the nest by the adult fleas feeding on the pregnant doe. In this way, fleas are spread from one generation to the next and are an important vector of disease, especially myxomatosis.",

Microsporidia are characterized by having small spores and one polar capsule. There are several Encephalitozoon species (e.g. E. intestinalis, E. hellum, E. bieneusi, E. septata) most of which are opportunist pathogens in immunocompromised humans. Diarrhoea, renal disease and keratoconjunctivitis are among the diseases that have been associated with encephalitozoonosis in humans. In animals, Encephalitozoon cuniculi is the most important member of the Microsporidia genus. E. cuniculi primarily affects rabbits but can be found in other species. Microsporidia are unusual in that they lack mitochondria, presumably gaining their nutrition from the host cells (Pakes and Gerrity, 1994) . They are characterized by a firm capsule that is strongly gram-negative (Owen, 1992) . A long polar filament is neatly coiled within it. The spore has a polar cap. Infection of the host usually occurs by oral ingestion of food contaminated with infected urine. Once in the alimentary tract, the spore comes in close contact with the mucosa and infects a host cell by extruding the polar filament. Sporoplasm is transferred through the polar filament into a vacuole in the host cell where multiplication takes place. Dividing organisms are lined up along the vacuolar membrane that is thought to be of host origin (Pakes and Gerrity, 1994) . The cells of the reticuloendothelial system are among those that are invaded and they distribute the parasite around the body. Eventually the organisms develop into mature spores that are oval in shape and measure approximately 2.5 \u03eb 1.5 \u00b5m with a thick cell wall (Pakes and Gerrity, 1994) . The vacuole becomes distended and the cell eventually ruptures releasing spores that invade new cells. Rupture of the cells is associated with an inflammatory response (Pattison et al., 1971) . Chronic inflammation results in the development of granulomatous lesions in target organs, primarily the kidney and brain, although the liver may be involved (see Plates 26 and 31). Myocarditis has also been reported (Pakes and Gerrity, 1994) . Clinical signs are associated with granulomatous encephalitis or nephritis, notably vestibular disease and chronic renal failure. E. cuniculi can also cause lens rupture, pyogranulomatous uveitis and cataracts in rabbits (see Section 11.7.3.1 and Plate 24). In utero infection of the lens in the developing embryo occurs and causes the lens to rupture in later life (Stiles et al., 1997) .",

Initially, target organs are those of high blood flow, such as the lungs, liver and kidney (Percy and Barthold, 1993) with infection of nervous tissue taking place later on in the course of the disease. An antibody response is initiated soon after infection. Antibodies to E. cuniculi can be demonstrated at least 2 weeks before intracellular organisms are demonstrated and 4 weeks before histopathological changes are seen in the kidney or organisms in the urine. Histopathogical changes in the brain are observed over 8 weeks after seroconversion (Cox and Gallachio, 1978) . In vitro studies of the effects of immune and non-immune rabbit serum on E. cuniculi suggest enhanced phagocytosis of the parasite by macrophages in immune animals (Niederkorn and Shaddock, 1980) . Serum antibody levels become detectable 3-4 weeks after infection, reaching high titres 6-9 weeks post-infection. Spores can be seen in the urine 1 month after infection and are excreted in large numbers up to 2 months post-infection. Shedding of spores is essentially terminated by 3 months postinfection (Percy and Barthold, 1993) . Spores of E. cuniculi survive for less than 1 week at 4\u00b0C but remain viable for at least 6 weeks at 22\u00b0C.",

Affected animals showed muscular weakness, emaciation, polydypsia, polyuria and occasional neurological signs. Other texts describe encephalitozoonosis as a chronic, latent disease of rabbits that is significant because of its effects on experimental results. Infection with E. cuniculi in laboratory rabbits has caused many problems to scientific studies. Subclinical infection has vitiated experimental results and lesions caused by the parasite have been wrongly attributed to a number of other ailments (Wilson, 1979) . Encephalitozoonosis can interfere with test results. Blood samples of rabbits with spontaneous encephalitozoonosis have been shown to have significantly lower levels of catecholamines than healthy rabbits (Levkut et al., 1997) .

In colonies that screen for the disease, affected animals are culled and in colonies that do not screen, infection can be subclinical with no obvious sign of disease. It is for the individual pet rabbit that treatment is usually sought. Observant owners may notice clinical signs that would be overlooked in the colony situation and are reluctant to have their animals euthanased. Several treatment protocols have been suggested based either on basic principles of therapy for granulomatous encephalitis or on in vitro susceptibility of E. cuniculi organisms to various therapeutic agents. Some cases appear to improve spontaneously without treatment, presumably due to the host's immune response. In the absence of a simple diagnostic test for the presence of the antigen in the live animal, it is difficult to monitor the efficacy of therapeutic agents in eliminating the parasite. Antibody titres have been used as a guide to the progress of the disease but controlled studies are needed to evaluate their significance as prognostic indicators. Clinical signs are not only associated with the presence of the parasite but also the associated inflammatory response that persists after the organism is eliminated. Some data have been obtained from the treatment of AIDS patients who are able to describe their symptoms and can therefore be assessed more easily than pet rabbits. Parasite excretion has been monitored using PCR assays that are not generally available for pet rabbits. In general, E. cuniculi in pet rabbits is either treated with corticosteroids to suppress the inflammatory reaction or with albendazole or oxytetracycline, both of which kill the organism in vitro.",

A wide range of other drugs was also tested, including some that are available in veterinary medicine. Metronidazole, doxycycline, sulphonamides and itraconazole could not be evaluated because of their toxic effects on the fibroblast tissue culture (Beauvais et al., 1994) . Fumigallin, an agent used to treat bees for nosematosis, was found to be effective against E. cuniculi as well as albendazole. Franssen et al. (1995) found that toltrazuril, metronidazole and itraconazole were ineffective in preventing spore formation in tissue cultures of E. cuniculi and confirmed the efficacy of albendazole and fumigallin.

Sporozoites invade neighbouring cells and are dispersed throughout the body via the blood and lymphatics. Once the host immune responses are established, the organisms can be found as cysts in various tissues where they can remain for years (Owen, 1992) . The source of infection for rabbits is feed contaminated by cat faeces and symptoms have been described in rabbits that grazed an area frequented by cats. Clinical signs are most common in the acute phase in young rabbits. Sudden anorexia, pyrexia and death are the usual signs, although CNS symptoms such as posterior paralysis or seizures can also occur (Leland et al., 1992) . Outbreaks have been described in commercial rabbits (Harcourt, 1967; Okerman, 1988) . High antibody titres have been found in wild rabbits collected from sewerage farms in Australia (Cox et al., 1981) . Positive serology only indicates exposure to infection. Gustaffson et al. (1997) compared the difference in susceptibility to toxoplasmosis between two lagomorphs; the mountain hare (Lepus timidus) and the domestic rabbit (Oryctolagus cuniculus). Domestic rabbits were found to be resistant to toxoplasmosis in comparison with the mountain hare. In the mountain hare, toxoplasmosis is acutely fatal and characterized by necrosis and tissue damage in the small intestine, mesenteric lymph nodes and liver. In the domestic rabbit, lesions are mild consisting of focal accumulations of mononuclear cells, mainly in the liver and heart. Histopathology is diagnostic. Antibodies are detected early as 7-8 days post-infection (Gustaffson et al., 1997) .",

In rabbits, P. multocida can reside in the nasal cavity without causing disease.

In colonies of rabbits kept for breeding, meat and fur production, or for laboratory purposes, pasteurellosis is a serious, infectious disease.

There are several capsular and somatic serotypes of P. multocida that are pathogenic for domestic livestock and poultry, but only a few are pathogenic for rabbits. Serotyping entails the identification of the capsular antigen and serotypes. In rabbits, serotypes 12:A, 3:A and 3:D are the usual types identified (Percy and Barthold, 1993) . Snuffles is most frequently associated with 12:A, whereas 3:A and occasionally 3:D are more frequently associated with disease of the lower respiratory tract. Virulence of infection varies between serotypes. Pasteurella multocida produces an endotoxin that varies with serotype. The role of the endotoxin in clinical disease is unclear, although it may be significant in septicaemic cases. The bacteria also produce adhesins which adhere the bacteria to epithelial tissue. Filamentous appendages elaborated by the bacteria may help P. multocida colonize mucous membranes (Deeb, 1993) . The adhesive properties vary with different serotypes of P. multocida and could be important in the pathogenesis of the disease (Manning et al., 1989) . Mucosal antibodies (IgA) inhibit growth of bacteria and are produced in response to exposure to P. multocida. High humoral (IgG) antibody levels are associated with chronic infection and have been used to identify infected rabbits in laboratory colonies (Deeb, 1993) .",

In pet rabbits, dental disease and nasal foreign bodies can cause similar signs (see Section 13.2.3). The thick sticky white discharge from the nose is wiped away with the forelegs leading to a yellow staining and matting of the fur. Poor husbandry, overcrowding, poor ventilation, dust conditions and ammonia buildup exacerbate the disease.

Surviving rabbits are bred from and after 3 years, the colony is considered to be disease free. Other methods of producing disease-free rabbits involve caesarean derivation with hand-rearing (Manning et al., 1989) or the transfer of fertilized ova to Pasteurellafree does. Early weaning and the use of antibiotics can increase the number of disease-free stock. To ensure an uninfected status, periodic serological testing for antibodies to pasteurella is necessary.

The disease affects the caecum, intestine and liver causing acute diarrhoea and sudden death in the acute stage and intestinal fibrosis, stenosis and liver necrosis in chronic cases. The myocardium can also be affected. The disease usually occurs in weanling rabbits 6-12 weeks old but can occur at any age and is often predisposed by stress. Recent advances in tissue culture have led to development of diagnostic tests and serological testing is now possible in some countries. The presence of antibody in apparently healthy animals suggests latent infection of the intestinal tract. Stress or immunosuppression can precipitate overt disease (Delong and Manning, 1994) . Transmission occurs by ingestion of spores that can survive in the environment for some time after an infected animal has been removed.

High dietary starch levels are believed to predispose to enterotoxaemia by causing 'carbohydrate overload' of the caecum. Residual starch that reaches the caecum can be broken down to release glucose as a substrate for iota toxin formation. This situation is more likely to occur in juvenile rabbits rather than adults. Immature rabbits do not digest starch efficiently in the small intestine, but in adult animals starch is broken down and absorbed before it reaches the caecum. In adults, enterotoxaemia is usually related to other factors such as stress or antibiotic therapy, which disrupt the caecal microflora and allow Clostridia spp. to proliferate.",

Rabbits were frequently kept as pets and there was outcry at the sight of blind, sick rabbits stumbling along roads or on commons and other public places.

Infected rabbits mount an immune response that can be detected by in vitro tests about 7 days after infection and reach peak levels by about 28 days (Fenner and Ross, 1994) . Antibodies persist for prolonged periods and give absolute immunity for many months. Maternal transfer of antibodies takes place and immunity lasts for 4-5 weeks in baby rabbits. Some rabbits have a genetic resistance to infection, which has limited mortality rates in outbreaks in wild rabbits. Genetic resistance to infection varies between rabbit populations and countries. British rabbits were slow to develop resistance in comparison with Australian rabbits (Fenner and Ross, 1994) . A phenomenon known as 'paternal resistance' is also described. It has been discovered that bucks mating within 7 months of infection sometimes confer partial resistance to progeny born to the mated doe within the following 7 months. Speculation about some immunogenic factor in semen has been made (Fenner and Ross, 1994 Shope fibroma virus is endemic in cottontails in the Eastern USA. It causes fibromas that remain localized but can persist for months. In newborn or immunocompromised individuals, generalized fibromatosis can occur (Fenner and Fantani, 1999) . Like myxomatosis, Shope fibroma virus is spread by insect vectors. Transmission by mosquitoes occurs more readily than in the European rabbit. In situations where cottontails and mosquitoes are common, generalized fibromatosis can occur in adults because multiple mosquito bites produce a fibroma at each site (Fenner and Fantani, 1999) .",

The discovery of Shope fibroma virus and its cross-immunity with myxomatosis led to the development of a live 16.6.1.6 Recovery from myxomatosis It is possible for rabbits to recover from myxomatosis. Apart from the virulence of the virus strain, certain environmental factors affect the resistance of the rabbit to myxomatosis, i.e. intercurrent infection and environmental temperature. Ambient temperature affects the course of the disease with high environmental temperature increasing recovery rate (85\u00b0C). Antibiotics, a warm environment and good nursing can be successful and some pet rabbits have survived myxomatosis although their chances are not good. The risk of secondary problems such as gastrointestinal stasis or pasteurellosis is ever present. Non-steroidal analgesics are useful but the use of corticosteroids is contraindicated due to their immunosuppressive effects. Opioid analgesics do not appear to be effective in ameliorating signs of pain. In a study of the effect of buprenorphine on the course of myxomatosis in laboratory rabbits, there was no difference in survival time. Treated rabbits refused food and water a day earlier than untreated rabbits and had lower rectal temperatures immediately prior to death (Robinson et al., 1999) .",

A disease broke out in a colony of Angora rabbits that had recently been imported into Germany (Fenner and Fantani, 1999) . Except for the suckling rabbits, all the rabbits died within a week and in less than 9 months the disease had spread over 50 000 square kilometres and reached Italy and Europe. By 1988, VHD had been reported in commercial rabbits in many countries worldwide, probably introduced through rabbit meat. In Europe, the disease spread into the wild rabbit population. In 1990, VHD reached Scandinavia. Wild rabbits in the densely populated island of Gotland became nearly extinct within 1 week (Gavier-Wid\u00e9n, 1996) . Hundreds of rabbits were seen dead in the fields and many more died in their burrows. Pet rabbits that had been kept indoors and fed on commercial food started dying indicating that humans can act as vectors for VHD.

Infected young rabbits survive and become immune so when the disease becomes endemic the morbidity and mortality rate falls. In wild rabbits, the disease appears to break out every second year. Insects mechanically transmit the virus in viraemic blood from one animal to another. VHD virus can survive for several weeks in carcasses and skin. Fleas, blowflies and mosquitoes are known to spread the disease (Fenner and Fantani, 1999) . PCR techniques have shown that virus can be retained in the body of blowflies for up to 9 days and bushflies for 7 days. Fly 'spots' (faeces) are also infective and can contaminate pasture. Flies can travel long distances and be carried along by the wind and spread the disease far and wide. It has also been demonstrated that domestic and wild carnivores can play an important role in the epidemiology of VHD since virulent material can be collected from faecal material after experimental oral inoculation. The virus is very stable in carcasses even after freezing and thawing (Lumeij, 1997) . Up until October 1996, VHD was a notifiable disease in Great Britain. It is now endemic and poses a real threat to the pet rabbit due to its resistance and ease of transmission. Deaths have been reported nationwide that have been confirmed at post-mortem to be due to VHD.",

Haematuria, haemorrhagic vaginal discharges or foamy exudate from the nostrils may be seen. Vascular infarcts can occur within the brain and occasionally convulsions or other neurological signs are seen just before death. Agonal vocalizing and cyanosis have been described (Donnelly, 1995) .

Young rabbits less than 4 weeks of age remain unaffected and develop a life-long immunity if they are exposed to the disease. Unexposed rabbits become increasingly susceptible until 6-10 weeks of age when physiological resistance to the virus disappears.

VHD only affects the European rabbit Oryctolagus cuniculi \u2022 The disease may be called 'rabbit haemorrhagic disease' (RHD) and the virus known as 'rabbit haemorrhagic disease virus' (RHDV). Sometimes the term 'rabbit calicivirus disease' (RCD) is used \u2022 The causative calicivirus of VHD has a predilection for hepatocytes. VHD is essentially a necrotizing hepatitis. Death is usually due to disseminated intravascular coagulopathy \u2022 VHD calicivirus can survive for long periods outside the host. Viable virus has been detected for as long as 105 days on cloth \u2022 VHD virus is spread by oral, nasal and parenteral transmission and is present in urine and faeces from infected rabbits. Contaminated foods can be a source of infection \u2022 When VHD is introduced into a susceptible population, the mortality rate is high and can be 90-100% in rabbits over 2 months of age \u2022 VHD has a short incubation period of 3-4 days. The disease can be peracute with animals being found dead within a few hours of eating and behaving normally \u2022 The 'classic' picture is a dead rabbit in opisthotonus with a haemorrhagic nasal discharge \u2022 Haematuria, haemorrhagic vaginal discharges or foamy exudate from the nostrils may be seen \u2022 Vascular infarcts can occur within the brain and occasionally convulsions or other neurological signs are seen just before death \u2022 There is no specific treatment for affected rabbits \u2022 Young rabbits, less than 4 weeks of age, remain unaffected and develop a lifelong immunity if they are exposed to the disease. Unexposed rabbits become increasingly susceptible until 6-10 weeks of age when physiological resistance to the virus disappears \u2022 The typical histopathological changes in the liver are usually diagnostic \u2022 An effective vaccine against VHD is available in the UK \u2022 Other viruses that affect rabbits include papillomavirus, coronavirus, rotavirus, and parvovirus \u2022 Fungal infections of domestic rabbits include Trichophyton mentagrophytes, Microsporum canis, Dermatophilus congalensis and aspergillosis.",

Like Cheyletiella parasitovorax, heavy infestation is linked to some underlying problem with grooming, such as dental disease, obesity or spinal disorders. The mite is just visible to the naked eye, especially in light-coloured rabbits. A simple method of detecting Leporacus gibbus is to comb through the fur with a fine-toothed flea comb and place the combings in a small, clear plastic bag. The contents of the bag are viewed microscopically under low power and the mites are seen moving along hair shafts. Eggs and empty egg cases can be seen attached to hair shafts. Immature and adult mites are visible. There are morphological differences between male (a) and female mites (b). Coenurus serialis is the larval stage of Taenia serialis, which is a tapeworm that affects dogs and foxes. A variety of mammals can act as intermediate hosts, usually wild rabbits and hares, but primates and even man can host the intermediate stage. Onchospheres from this tapeworm migrate to the subcutaneous tissue where they form cysts that are palpated as soft swellings under the skin. The cyst contains fluid and inverted secondary buds, each containing a scolex. Occasionally a cyst may be found in the orbit where it causes a retrobulbar swelling",
