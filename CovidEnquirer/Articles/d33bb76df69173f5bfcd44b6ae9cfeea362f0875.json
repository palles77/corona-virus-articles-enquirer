In addition to causing annual outbreaks during winter, the influenza virus can undergo antigenic drift/ shift and has the potential to cause worldwide pandemics every 10-40 years. Therefore, from a public health perspective, influenza is a disease that requires international surveillance and preparation [1] . To reduce the disease burden of influenza virus and improve public health, South Korea has implemented, with excellent results, the national immunization program (NIP) for influenza. Among the countries that are a part of the Organization for Economic Cooperation and Development, South Korea had the second highest influenza vaccination rate for people aged \u226565 years in 2013 [2] . However, to our knowledge, accurate Yun JW, et al. \u2022 The Korean Influenza National Immunization Program www.icjournal.org 248 summaries on the origins of influenza NIP and the changes made to reach its present form do not exist. Therefore, we sought to outline the course of influenza NIP transformation since its inception in 1997 and to review its present status.",

The NIP's management structure is comprised of the Korea Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (KCDC); provincial and city public safety units; and city, district, and county public health units. The following are the responsibilities of public health units: determining vaccine demands/requirements, conducting vaccination programs, and recording and reporting individuals' vaccination statuses and any adverse events (AEs). The provincial and city public safety units oversee the achievements of public health units concerning the vaccination and act as a bridge in conducting epidemiological investigations of AEs and reporting the results to the KCDC. The role of the KCDC is to manage the vaccine supply and registration, to review epidemiological investigations of vaccine-related AEs, and to manage compensations [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] .",

However, because of the delayed occurrence of influenza outbreaks, the vaccination period was later changed to September-November in 2002 and September-December in 2004. Considering the fact that the effects of a vaccination last up to 6 months on average, the vaccination period was adjusted to October-December in 2005 and has remained so until now (except for the 2009-2010 and 2010-2011 seasons when the vaccination period started early (September-December) to include the H1N1 influenza vaccine) [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] . In 2017, free vaccine recipients were expanded to cover young children from 6 months to <5 years old. As such, for those infants receiving their first twodose vaccination, their first dose was given in early September and the second dose was completed before the start of the season to develop sufficient immunity. Infants who reach 6 months of age after January 2018 will be allowed to receive free vaccinations until the end of April 2018 [17] .",

In 2010, the target group was extended to include children aged <5 years and people living with high-risk family members (Table 1) . Currently, pregnant women are included in the World Health Organization's first-priority influenza vaccination group, but were not included in the NIP's influenza target group until 2003. Even then, vaccination was not recommended for pregnant women who were in their first trimester, except for high-risk cases. In the 2005-2006 season, influenza vaccination was recommended for all pregnant women [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] .

As a result, the overall influenza vaccination rate among elderly adults aged \u226565 years increased from 73% to 80.9%, when compared to the 2014-2015 season. In particular, the influenza vaccination rate increased in elderly adults aged \u226585 years by approximately 13% (from 56.1% to 69.3%) [16] .

In July 2012, the vaccination registration systems were combined with the Integrated System for Disease Control/ Public Health (http://is.cdc.go.kr), so that physicians can report directly through this integrated system. In addition, patients or their care givers can report their vaccination and any AEs through the Vaccination Adverse Event Reporting System (https://nip.cdc.go.kr). If an AE is reported after vaccination, the epidemiological study team at the city/provincial level performs a basic epidemiological investigation, and then the epidemiological study team at the KCDC performs a more detailed investigation. The vaccination injury study team conducts an investigation of the injury and reports the results to the Vaccine Injury Compensation Program committee. Once the committee has completed reviewing the reports and the required compensation, the results are reported to the Ministry of Health and Welfare. The Ministry of Health and Welfare then decides on the amount of compensation, notifies, and pays the patient through the KCDC.",

However, the main problems that are unique to the influenza virus and vaccine, such as vaccine mismatching and low vaccine effectiveness in elderly adults and children, remain. Support/funding for influenza risk groups other than infants (6-59 months) and elderly populations is also lacking, and a considerable influenza disease burden remains in Korea [27, 28] . As the target influenza vaccination rate among elderly adults has been achieved, the next step is to conduct further research to evaluate the most cost-effective type of vaccine (e.g., quadrivalent, adjuvanted, or high dose). The NIP for influenza has been operating for 20 years, with the primary objective of reducing the disease burden in high-risk groups. However, for high-risk groups, other than elderly adults and children aged \u226459 months, there has been very little control of immunization, resulting in a blind spot. Thus, a strategy should be formulated to improve the vaccination rate among the two high-risk groups: (1) pregnant women and (2) people with chronic health conditions, who most likely experience complications associated with influenza.",
