            "text": "BACKGROUND: Thirty-day readmissions among elderly Medicare patients are an important hospital quality measure. Although plans for using 30-day readmission measures are under consideration for younger patients, little is known about readmission in younger patients or the relationship between readmissions in younger and elderly patients at the same hospital. METHODS: By using the 2014 Nationwide Readmissions Database, we examined readmission patterns in younger patients (18-64 years) using hierarchical models to evaluate associations between hospital 30-day, risk-standardized readmission rates in elderly Medicare patients and readmission risk in younger patients with acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, or pneumonia. RESULTS: There were 87,818, 98,315, and 103,251 admissions in younger patients for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia, respectively, with overall 30-day unplanned readmission rates of 8.5%, 21.4%, and 13.7%, respectively. Readmission risk in younger patients was significantly associated with hospital 30-day risk-standardized readmission rates for elderly Medicare patients for all 3 conditions. A decrease in an average hospital's 30-day, risk-standardized readmission rates from the 75th percentile to the 25th percentile was associated with reduction in younger patients' risk of readmission from 8.8% to 8.0% (difference: 0.7%; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-0.9) for acute myocardial infarction; 21.8% to 20.0% (difference: 1.8%; 95% confidence interval, 1.4-2.2) for heart failure; and 13.9% to 13.1% (difference: 0.8%; 95% confidence interval, 0.5-1.0) for pneumonia. CONCLUSIONS: Among younger patients, readmission risk was moderately associated with hospital 30-day, risk-standardized readmission rates in elderly Medicare beneficiaries. Efforts to reduce readmissions among older patients may have important areas of overlap with younger patients, although further research may be necessary to identify specific mechanisms to tailor initiatives to younger patients.",

Extensive research has attempted to better understand and prevent readmissions in elderly Medicare beneficiaries for these conditions. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] Although hospital readmissions have been extensively studied in the elderly Medicare population, readmissions are common among nonelderly adult patients. Younger patients are readmitted approximately 2 million times annually, which is similar in number to elderly Medicare beneficiaries. 5 However, overall patterns of and factors associated with hospital readmission in younger patients thus far have been examined using only single state inpatient data. [24] [25] [26] Broader knowledge of readmissions among a nationally representative cohort of younger patients with acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia may help tailor specific clinical and policy interventions. This is essential as commercial insurers and Medicaid programs begin to roll out initiatives to reduce readmissions in this population. [27] [28] [29] [30] Furthermore, it would be valuable to understand whether younger patients discharged from hospitals with lower readmission rates for elderly Medicare beneficiaries are at lower risk of readmission. If such an association exists, it would suggest that common strategies could be used to reduce readmission rates for both groups.",

Second, we found an unexpected association between the 30-day RSRRs in elderly Medicare beneficiaries and the risk of readmission in younger patients across conditions. A hospital's 30-day RSRR for heart failure was significantly associated with the risk of readmission for all 3 conditions, whereas that for acute myocardial infarction was related to acute myocardial infarction and heart failure but not pneumonia. However, there was no significant relationship between a hospital's RSRR for older adults with pneumonia and the risk of readmission for younger adults with acute myocardial infarction or heart failure.

This lower rate of readmissions might be explained by the inclusion of a larger, more nationally representative cohort of patients in our study along with continued declines in readmission rates for acute myocardial infarction and heart failure. 35 The modestly higher rate of readmission after heart failure hospitalizations among younger patients compared with elderly patients deserves brief mention (21.4% vs 20.7%). Although this finding has been demonstrated for heart failure, 24 the mechanism explaining this phenomenon remains unclear. We speculate on 2 potential mechanisms. First, perhaps differences in the common causes of heart failure between younger and older patients partially account for this phenomenon. For instance, heart failure with reduced ejection fraction is a more common cause of heart failure among younger patients and may be associated with a worse prognosis in this age group. 13 Second, socioeconomic factors, including lack of health insurance, may pose challenges to appropriate outpatient follow-up and management for younger patients.",

We extend prior literature by introducing the novel finding that 30-day RSRRs for elderly Medicare beneficiaries have a significant association with the risk of readmission for younger patients for acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and pneumonia. This finding has several important implications. First, because other insurers beyond Medicare are concerned with reducing readmissions, understanding the mechanisms by which hospitals with low 30-day RSRRs achieve reduced readmissions across the spectrum of age is an important step in designing and implementing readmission reduction programs more broadly. One possible mechanism may include similar patterns and timing of readmission. 24, 36 Second, there may be substantial costs associated with reducing a hospital's RSRR in elderly patients. 37 On the basis of our findings, a reduction in a hospital's RSRR by 1 percentage point is associated with an approximately 5% reduction in the relative probability of readmission and a smaller reduction in the absolute risk among younger patients across all 3 conditions. Thus, an increased understanding of the factors associated with readmissions in nonelderly patients may inform the development of more cost-effective strategies to reduce readmissions in this population.",

First, because of data limitations in the NRD, we were unable to account for complete measures of clinical and socioeconomic risk in our models. [47] [48] [49] Thus, residual confounding due to both elderly and younger patients being sicker at some hospitals remains an important concern as with most observational studies. Second, we were unable to use the specific case-mix adjustment method used by CMS for estimation of 30-day RSRRs for HRRP and Hospital Compare. 32 This method of risk-adjustment requires 12 months of claims data before admission, which was not available in this dataset. However, as in prior work, we used Elixhauser comorbidities for case-mix adjustment 50 ; the discrimination of our models compared similarly to models used by CMS. [21] [22] [23] Third, we did not have data available on vital status among patients who were not readmitted. Therefore, we were unable to account for the competing risk of death after discharge. However, most operational initiatives for programs targeted toward readmission consider mortality and readmission as separate outcomes. Fourth, there are important limitations of the NRD that deserve specific mention. The NRD includes only hospitalizations from community hospitals as defined by the American Hospital Association; therefore, admissions to federal hospitals such as the Veterans Affairs health systems are not included. Readmissions to hospitals in different states from the index hospitalization are not captured because the NRD is a compilation of various State Inpatient Databases. Also, readmissions when the discharge date occurred in 2015 were not captured. These limitations of the dataset may have led to a modest underestimation of the actual number of readmissions that occurred. Finally, we also recognize the limitations regarding our 30-day RSRR calculations due to the availability of 11 months of data in the NRD compared with the 3 years of historical data used in the CMS measures. This leads to the potential of measurement error in our 30-day RSRR calculations. Although there is no method to compare the hospital-specific RSRRs we estimated with Hospital Compare because of the de-identified nature of the NRD, our national observed readmission rates were largely comparable. Specifically, our 30-day observed readmission rates for elderly Medicare beneficiaries for acute myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and pneumonia were 14.9%, 20.7%, and 16.1%, respectively, whereas currently on Hospital Compare they are 16.8%, 21.9%, and 17.1%, respectively. 51 Overall, our calculated rates were modestly lower than the reported readmission rates on Hospital Compare that we suspect are due to the inclusion of generally healthier Medicare Advantage patients.",
