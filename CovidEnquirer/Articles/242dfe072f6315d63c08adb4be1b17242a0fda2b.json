Recombinant vaccinia viruses were generated by in vivo homologous recombination of the insertion vector with the WR strain of vaccinia virus. Nucleoprotein (N) expressed by both recombinant vaccinia virus and TGEV had a relative molecular mass (A.&) of 47,000 and was susceptible to degradation at the C-terminus yielding discrete breakdown products. The integral membrane protein (M) expressed by a recombinant vaccinia virus and TGEV was sensitive to endoglycosidase H reducing the mature polypeptide of M, 29,000 to a species of M, 27,000. Expression of M by recombinant vaccinia virus was inhibited during early infection due to a cryptic vaccinia virus transc~ptional te~nation signal within the TGEV coding sequence. Indirect immunofluorescence showed that both N and M were only localised in the cell cytoplasm of either TGEV or recombinant vaccinia virus infected cells. Antisera from mice infected with recombinant viruses immunoprecipitated specific TGEV antigens from lysates of TGEV infected cells but had little significant TGEV neutralising activity in vitro.",

Coronavirus proteins are expressed from a 'nested' set of subgenomic mRNAs, which have common 3' termini but different 5' extensions. The 5'-terminal region of each mRNA is responsible for the expression of a viral protein. The v&ion contains three major structural polypeptides; a surface glycoprotein (spike or peplomer protein) with a monome~c M, 200,0~, a glycosylated integral membrane protein (M) observed as a series of polypeptides of M, 28,~-31,O~ and a nucleoprotein (N), a basic phospho~lated protein of M, 47,000 associated with the viral genomic RNA (Garwes and Pocock, 1975) . The genes encoding TGEV N and M have been cloned, sequenced and expressed in bacteria and yeast from a virulent British field isolate, FS772/70 (B&ton et al., 1988a, b) . We have now extended this work to a vaccinia virus (VV) expression system in order to analyse the structure and function of the N and M proteins in more detail.",

The initiation codons of both the TGEV N and M genes were 28 nucleotides from the BamHI cloning site in pGS20 (Fig. 1) . Restriction endonuclease analysis and nucleotide sequencing confirmed the orientation and promoter/gene junction for the insertion plasmids. Following transfection of plasmids pGSN1 and pGSIMI into vaccinia virus infected (X-1 cells, 20% and 1% of the resulting TIC viruses were found to express N or M protein gene products respectively, as determined by i~~odot-blot. Recombinant viruses expressing the TGEV antigens were plaque purified three times and the recombinant viruses vTN1, expressing the TGEV nucleoprotein gene, and vTM1, expressing the TGEV integral membrane protein gene, were used for subsequent experiments. (1) pGSN1, (2) vTN1, (3) pGSIM1, (4) vTM1 digested with BornHI or (5) vTNl and (6) vTMl digested with HindlII. The DNA fragments were hybridised with \"2P~labelled eDNA from the N and M BarnHi gene cassettes. 209 (Fig. 2) . Digestion of vTN1 with BamHI produced a 1.58 Kbp fragment (Fig. 2 , lane 2) that comigrated with the BamHI fragment of pGSN1 (Fig. 2, lane 1) . Digestion of vTN1 with Hind111 cleaved the N gene into two fragments, a 1.48 Kbp fragment containing the first 439 bp of the N gene and a 5.35 Kbp fragment containing the rest of the N gene (Fig. 2, lane 5) . Similarly, the M gene fragment was detected as a complete 830 bp BumHI fragment in pGSIM1 (Fig. 2, lane 3) and vTM1 (Fig. 2, lane 4) . Digestion of vTM1 DNA with Hind111 should produce a 5.00 Kbp fragment as well as a smaller 1.07 Kbp fragment containing TGEV cDNA. The 1.07 Kbp fragment was not observed because cleavage with Hind111 provides this fragment with only 30 bp of M gene sequence, insufficient for hybridisation with the probe. Only the 5.00 Kbp fragment was detected (Fig. 2, lane 6) because it contained 800 bp of M gene sequence. Results from the Hind111 digestion data and the TK-phenotype of the recombinant viruses confirms that the TGEV gene sequences are integrated into the vaccinia TK gene within the Hind111 J fragment.",

Production of the TGEV antigens was assessed by titrating total cell lysates with TGEV hyperimmune serum. N gene expression was observed to be about 4-fold lower in the presence of araC (Fig. 4 ). This showed that N protein was still expressed by the early gene function of the P,.,, promoter.

Nucleoprotein breakdown products have been observed in TGEV LLC-PKl cell lysates, notably a product of it4, 42,000 that is also phosphorylated (Garwes et al., 1984) . Smaller nucleoprotein breakdown products are only detected with polyclonal serum and not with the anti-nucleoprotein mAb DA3 (Fig. 5) material contains a range of smaller nucleoprotein species (M, 38,000-42,000) (Fig.  5, lane 1) . A major N breakdown product of M, 40,000 seen in TGEV cells also appears to occur in CV-1 cells infected with vTN1 (Fig. 5, lane 4) . This indicates that when nucleoprotein is expressed in large amounts the pattern of de~adation products appear to be characteristic of the cell type infected. The M protein is observed as a series of polypeptides, &l, 28~000-31,0~, in TGEV infected cells (Garwes and Pocock, 1975) . Such a series of M protein polypeptides was not observed for vTM1 infected monkey (CV-1) cells (Fig. 6 ) or in human (HTK-) and porcine (LLC-PKI) cells (not shown). Cells infected with vTMl contain a major pdypeptide species of i%f, 23,000 (Fig. 6) , identical in size to the most abundant M polypeptide species found in TGEV infected cells.

            "text": "The TGEV N and M protein genes from strain FS772/70 have been singularly inserted into the W TK locus and expressed from the vaccinia P,.5K promoter. Using mAbs previously raised against the TGEV proteins the RW expressed proteins were found to be of a similar size and antigenicity to their TGEV counterparts. The low levels of early M gene expression during vTM1 infection is probably due to the presence of a W early transcriptional termination signal sequence, TTTT-TAT (Rohrmamt et al., 1986) 190 bp downstream of the M gene initiation codon (Britton et al., 1988b) . Browne et al. (1986) demonstrated that the human papilloma virus type 16 Ll coding region was poorly expressed by the P7.5K promoter because it contained two W early transcriptional termination signals. The presence of the TTTTTAT sequence in the TGEV M gene probably explains the different levels of product synthesised between early and early/late gene expression for this protein.",

(1984) showed that TGEV, strain FS772/70, infected LLC-PKl cells contained a phosphorylated polypeptide of J4, 42,000 that appeared late in infection, was not incorporated into vii-ions and was derived from the nucleoprotein. The polypeptide of M, 42,000 was shown to be co-precipitated with full size N using the mAb, DA3, but could not be detected by immunoblot with the same mAb. Welch and Saif (1988) have also co-precipitated smaller products with an anti-N mAb including a product of M, 44,000 from TGEV strain P115 and a polypeptide of M, 46,000, from the M6 strain, along with the full size A4,48,000 molecule. Zhirnov and Bukrinskaya (1981) have shown that two forms of the influenza virus major nucleocapsid protein, NP,, (M, 56,~O) and NP,, (~~53,~), appear at late times of infection and in varying amounts depending on the cell type. Peptide mapping demonstrated that the NP,, was cleaved to form NP,, and virions preferentially contained the full length form. Cells infected with RWs expressing the TGEV N protein also produce breakdown products. It seems unlikely that these smaller N products are the translational consequence of deleted transcripts arising from TGEV defective interfering particles, as vTN1 infected LLC-PKl cells also synthesise these smaller molecules (Fig. 5, lane 2) . The presence of smaller nucleoprotein products could be due to the release of proteolytic enzymes in dying cells in the late stages of infection. Variations in the quantity of nucleoprotein breakdown products, in different cell types, could be explained by a variable resistance of host cells to viral-induced damage as has been implicated for influenza A nucleoprotein (Zhimov and Burkrinskaya, 1981) .",

The predicted molecular weight for the M protein is J4, 29,459 (B&ton et al., 1988b) as deduced from its gene sequence. Because the M protein in TGEV and vTM1 infected cells is glycosylated it is quite likely that the potential 16 amino acid N-terminal sequence of the M protein is cleaved. Laude et al.
