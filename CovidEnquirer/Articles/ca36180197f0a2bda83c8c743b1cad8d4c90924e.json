            "text": "The purpose of this review is to present the evidence for the diagnosis and treatment of cough due to acute bronchitis and make recommendations that will be useful for clinical practice. Acute bronchitis is one of the most common diagnoses made by primary care clinicians and emergency department physicians. It is an acute respiratory infection with a normal chest radiograph that is manifested by cough with or without phlegm production that lasts for up to 3 weeks. Respiratory viruses appear to be the most common cause of acute bronchitis; however, the organism responsible is rarely identified in clinical practice because viral cultures and serologic assays are not routinely performed. Fewer than 10% of patients will have a bacterial infection diagnosed as the cause of bronchitis. The diagnosis of acute bronchitis should be made only when there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia, and the common cold, acute asthma, or an exacerbation of COPD have been ruled out as the cause of cough. Acute bronchitis is a self-limited respiratory disorder, and when the cough persists for > 3 weeks, other diagnoses must be considered. Methods: Recommendations for this review were obtained from data using a National Library of Medicine (PubMed) search dating back to 1950, which was performed in August 2004. The search was limited to literature published in the English language and human studies, using search terms such as \"cough,\" \"acute bronchitis,\" and \"acute viral respiratory infection.\" Results: Unfortunately, most previous controlled trials guiding the treatment of acute bronchitis have not vigorously differentiated acute bronchitis and the common cold, and also have not distinguished between an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and acute asthma as a cause of acute cough. For patients with the putative diagnosis of acute bronchitis, routine treatment with antibiotics is not justified and should not be offered. Antitussive agents are occasionally useful and can be offered as therapy for short-term symptomatic relief of coughing, but there is no role for inhaled bronchodilator or expectorant therapy. Children and adult patients with confirmed and probable whooping cough should receive a macrolide antibiotic and should be isolated for 5 days from the start of treatment; early treatment within the first few weeks will diminish the coughing paroxysms and prevent spread of the disease; the patient is unlikely to respond to treatment beyond this period. Conclusion: Acute bronchitis is an acute respiratory infection that is manifested by cough and, at times, sputum production that lasts for no more than 3 weeks. This syndrome should be distinguished from the common cold, an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis, and acute asthma as the cause of acute cough. The widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of acute bronchitis is not justified, and vigorous efforts to curtail their use should be encouraged.",

Cough with or without phlegm produc-tion can also be part of the common cold syndrome, which is a benign self-limited illness of all age groups. The common cold is a conventional term for a mild upper respiratory illness, the hallmark symptoms of which are nasal stuffiness and discharge, sneezing, sore throat, and cough. 2 At times, these symptoms are also accompanied by constitutional symptoms such as fever, muscle aches, and fatigue. The prevalence of cough due to the common cold is as high as 83% within the first 2 days of illness, 3 and because the common cold and acute bronchitis share many of the same symptoms the clinical distinction between acute and chronic bronchitis and the common cold is difficult, or at times impossible, to make. Cough associated with the common cold is an upper airway cough syndrome that is often associated with throat clearing and the sensation of postnasal drip. The presumed lower airway cough of acute bronchitis also, at times, is accompanied by an upper airway cough syndrome, which has previously been referred to as postnasal drip syndrome, further compounding the difficulties in diagnosis.",

Unfortunately, most previous controlled trials guiding the treatment of acute bronchitis have not vigorously differentiated acute bronchitis and the common cold, and also have not distinguished between an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis and acute asthma as a cause of acute cough. This is in part due to the lack of a uniform definition for acute bronchitis. 4, 5 In studies of acute bronchitis, acute asthma was misdiagnosed as acute bronchitis in approximately one third of the patients who presented with acute cough. 6, 7 For those patients who have had at least two similar doctor-diagnosed episodes of acute bronchitis in the past 5 years, 65% can be identified as having mild asthma. 8 Because the clinical picture of both disorders is frequently quite similar, the only diagnostic tool that the clinician can rely on is a prospective evaluation of the patient to see whether the \"acute bronchitis\" is an isolated event or a predictor of a chronic disease such as asthma.",

When asked, most individuals label an acute illness that causes cough and sputum production as a \"chest cold\"; considerably fewer suggest the diagnosis of \"bronchitis.\" Because colds, upper respiratory infections, and bronchitis have been targeted as conditions that are associated with excessive antibiotic prescription use in the general medical community, and much of this problem is fueled by public expectation, the descriptive term used with patients may be very important.

Influenza occurs in distinct outbreaks each year, and because of its rapid spread it causes considerable morbidity in the general population. The most frequently reported symptoms of influenza are weakness (94%), myalgia (94%), cough (93%), and nasal congestion (91%). Individuals with influenza are more likely than those with influenzalike illness to have baseline cough (93% vs 80%, respectively), fever (68% vs 40%, respectively), and cough and fever together (64% vs 33%, respectively). 15 When influenza is circulating within the community, the presence of both cough and fever within 48 h of symptom onset is a strong predictor of influenza infection. RSV has also been recognized as a substantial cause of morbidity and mortality in adults, especially in the elderly. Attack rates are very high in households with small children, 16 and in geriatric wards, senior day care settings, and nursing homes. 17, 18 In one outbreak, the clinical and serologic attack rates were 61.2% and 75%, respectively, with intense coughing reported by 96%. 17 In surveillance studies of influenza-like illnesses in adults in general practice, RSV has been identified as the causative agent in 20% of patients compared to 30% for influenza. 19 Another emerging infection that must be considered in patients with an acute influenza-like illness is severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), which was first defined by the World Health Organization in mid-March 2003. This viral illness is a highly infectious disease due to a novel coronavirus, the SARS-associated coronavirus. The infection was first seen in humans in China in November 2002 but has spread worldwide. Exposed health-care workers are at high risk of infection; in the Toronto outbreak, 77% of the patients were exposed to SARS in the hospital setting. 20 Nonproductive cough was seen in 69% of patients, with documented fever in 85%, myalgias in 49%, and dyspnea in 42%; only 2% had rhinorrhea. In a report from Taiwan, 21 74% of patients developed cough at a mean (\u03ee SD) time of 4.5 \u03ee 1.9 days after the onset of fever. Fifty-nine percent of these patients had an infiltrate that was consistent with pneumonia seen on the chest radiograph on admission to the hospital. This incidence rose to 98% of the patients during the hospital stay. Information on future outbreaks of the SARS virus can be found at www.who.int/csr/sars/archive/en/.",

The bacteria that have been causally linked to acute bronchitis in otherwise healthy individuals include only Mycoplasma pneumoniae, Chlamydophila pneumoniae, Bordetella pertussis, and Bordetella parapertussis. 1 Prospective surveys 22 of healthy adults and adolescents with a cough lasting \u0546 5 days have shown that M pneumoniae and C pneumoniae are rare causes (\u03fd 1%). Greater incidences have been described in community outbreaks of acute illnesses, and outbreaks among military personnel and on college campuses. [23] [24] [25] In these settings, as many as 36% of patients showed evidence of mixed infections with viruses and M pneumoniae, C pneumoniae, or B pertussis. 25 While the importance of other bacterial pathogens in the pathogenesis of acute uncomplicated bronchitis has been suggested, 26 there are few data to support this. In patients with chronic bronchitis, there is evidence that bacteria such as Streptococcus pneumoniae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Haemophilus influenzae play a role during an acute exacerbation of cough and sputum production. 27 However, an acute exacerbation of chronic bronchitis is a different disease than acute bronchitis. Because these three organisms may inhabit the upper airways of healthy adults, their presence in sputum cultures in patients with acute uncomplicated bronchitis may signify colonization and not acute infection. 28 The concept that acute bacterial bronchitis in healthy adults may be caused by these organisms remains unproven.",

In some patients, particularly in those with recurrent attacks of presumed uncomplicated acute bronchitis, asthma, and not acute bronchitis, may be the cause of the recurrent symptoms and abnormal airway reactivity. 35 In other patients, the symptoms of acute bronchitis may persist for \u03fe 3 weeks, and a diagnosis of asthma becomes apparent. Whether acute bronchitis caused by C pneumoniae, M pneumoniae, or viruses is a risk factor for the development chronic persistent asthma has been suggested but not established. 36, 37 The answer to this question will require large prospective population studies.

Because pneumonia is not usually a self-limited disease and has considerable morbidity and mortality when not adequately treated, the distinction between these two respiratory infections is particularly important. This is especially pertinent in the elderly population, in which a high index of suspicion is necessary because pneumonia in persons in this age group is associated with a lower prevalence of respiratory and nonrespiratory symptoms at the time of presentation. 38 Four prospective studies 39 -42 in younger and older adults have evaluated the patient medical history and physical examination for accurately diagnosing radiographically confirmed pneumonia. These studies and an evidence-based and qualitybased review 43 have concluded that the absence of the following findings reduces the likelihood of pneumonia sufficiently to obviate the need for a chest radiograph: (1) heart rate \u03fe 100 beats/min; (2) respiratory rate \u03fe 24 breaths/min; (3) an oral body temperature of \u03fe 38\u00b0C; and (4) chest examination findings of focal consolidation, egophony, or fremi-tus.

Elderly patients 98S are particularly likely to receive unnecessary antibiotic coverage, and more than one-half of prescriptions are for extended-spectrum antibiotics. 45 This trend to rely on broad antibiotic coverage has also been seen in the general population. 46 In cigarette smokers, it has been reported 5,44 that \u03fe 90% of patients with acute bronchitis receive an antibiotic; yet, there is no evidence that smokers without COPD are in more need than nonsmokers.

Because they can be effective in patients with chronic bronchitis, it is reasonable to presume that they would be effective for patients with acute bronchitis. Studies on the use of these agents for the cough due to colds or acute viral respiratory illnesses have shown mixed results and are not recommended for routine use [62] [63] [64] [65] (see the section on cough suppressant and pharmacologic protussive therapy). Some studies have shown these agents to be successful in reducing subjective cough scores. In one study, 63 710 adults with an acute upper respiratory infection and cough were given a single dose of 30 mg of dextromethorphan hydrobromide or placebo, and objective cough assessment was conducted using continuous cough recordings.

In a patient with an acute respiratory infection manifested predominantly by cough, with or without sputum production, lasting no more than 3 weeks, a diagnosis of acute bronchitis should not be made unless there is no clinical or radiographic evidence of pneumonia and the common cold, acute asthma, or an exacerbation of COPD have been ruled out as the cause of cough. Quality of evidence, expert opinion; benefit, substantial; grade of recommendation, E/A 2. In patients with the presumed diagnosis of acute bronchitis, viral cultures, serologic assays, and sputum analyses should not be routinely performed because the responsible organism is rarely identified in clinical practice. Quality of evidence, low; benefit, intermediate; grade of recommendation, C 3. In patients with acute cough and sputum production suggestive of acute bronchitis, the absence of the following findings reduces the likelihood of pneumonia sufficiently to eliminate the need for a chest radiograph: (1) heart rate > 100 beats/min; (2) respiratory rate > 24 breaths/min; (3) oral body temperature of > 38\u00b0C; and (4) chest examination findings of focal consolidation, egophony, or fremitus.
