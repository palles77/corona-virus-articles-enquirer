The selective b 2 -adrenergic receptor antagonist ICI 118,551 reversed the inhibitory effects of formoterol. Formoterol and GFB both reduced the expression of CD13, the HCoV-229E receptor [5] . An inhibitor of CD13, 2, 2 0 -dipyridyl, reduced the viral titers. These findings suggest that these drugs inhibit HCoV-229E replication partly via the regulation of receptor expression. There was a reduction in the HCoV-229E titer and CD13 expression in HNE cells pretreated with cAMP at similar levels to those secreted into the supernatant when cells were treated with formoterol. The inhibitory effects of formoterol on CD13 expression were consistent with the results of a previous report by Danielsen et al., which found that CD13 expression in the intestinal mucosa was decreased by forskolin, an activator of adenylate cyclase [25] , which is activated by formoterol [26] . Therefore, formoterol may decrease HCoV-229E replication partly by modulating receptor expression via cAMP production.",

Here, we used HNE and HTE cells because we previously used these cells in infection studies [11, 12, 15, 46] . However, because bronchi and alveoli are the main sites of the pathogenesis of COPD and bronchial asthma exacerbations, bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells were used to reveal the effects of viral infection on exacerbations and the effects of drugs [37, 47] . Therefore, further studies using bronchial and alveolar epithelial cells will be needed to confirm HCoV-229E replication and the effects of drugs.",
