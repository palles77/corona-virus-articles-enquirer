The aim of this study was to design and validate a questionnaire to measure the attitude of hospital staff toward work attendance during an influenza pandemic. Method: An online questionnaire was designed and electronically distributed to the staff of a teaching medical institution in the United Kingdom. The questionnaire was designed de novo following discussions with colleagues at Imperial College and with reference to the literature on the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic. The questionnaire included 15 independent fact variables and 33 dependent measure variables. A total of 367 responses were received in this survey. Results: The data from the measurement variables were not normally distributed. Three different methods (standardized residuals, Mahalanobis distance and Cook's distance) were used to identify the outliers. In all, 19 respondents (5.17%) were identified as outliers and were excluded. cases in the measured variables. To improve the quality of the data, missing value analysis, using Expectation Maximization Algorithm (EMA) with a non-normal distribution model, was applied to the responses. The collected data were checked for homoscedasticity and multicollinearity of the variables. These tests suggested that some of the questions should be merged. In the last step, the reliability of the questionnaire was evaluated. This process showed that three questions reduced the reliability of the questionnaire. Removing those questions helped to achieve the desired level of reliability. Conclusion: With the changes proposed in this article, the questionnaire for measuring staff attitudes concerning pandemic influenza can be converted to a standardized and validated questionnaire to properly measure the expectations and attendance of healthcare staff in the event of pandemic flu.",

Pandemic flu is one of the most important pathogens that cause outbreaks of disease, and it has a high risk of spreading rapidly because of the airborne nature of its dissemination. To identify the attitudes of healthcare professionals regarding work attendance during such an outbreak, a questionnaire was designed de novo following discussions with colleagues at Imperial College and with reference to the literature on severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) [1] [2] [3] [4] . The choice of pandemic influenza was pragmatic because preparations were underway to prepare for an expected pandemic in the near future. To aid planning for business continuity, an understanding of staff attitudes toward pandemic flu is invaluable. Pandemic flu was compared with SARS, the most recent example of a global infectious disease that spread quickly around the world and affected patients and healthcare staff. Published literature was consulted to determine the lessons that had been learned. The questions for the questionnaire were empirically chosen based on the assumption that generic issues arising from the way the SARS outbreak was managed would be relevant to the management of an influenza pandemic. Subsequently, questions from a Department of Health (DH) questionnaire about pandemic flu that asked respondents about the distance of their residence from the hospital were combined with this questionnaire.",

None of the respondents reported problems understanding the content of the questionnaire. The options for scaling questions consisted of 6 items that were compatible with the recommendation by Fowler [6] . The items were labeled from negative (strongly disagree) to positive (strongly agree). Labeling the items on a scale using minimal descriptive words helped to eliminate confusion about the value of the scale levels [7] . The next step was data preparation. First, we analyzed the pilot data for outlier responses. The risk of extravagant respondents is a possibility in any survey, especially when the survey is anonymous. To identify the outliers, we used three methods: standardized residuals, Mahalanobis distance and Cook's distance. After removing the outlier responses, we scanned the data for missing values. Missing values are a major factor in reaching valid conclusions. There are methods for calculating these values that remove the effect of hidden bias in the data. We used Expectation Maximization Algorithm (EMA) to calculate the missing values [8] .",

The first method involves comparing the result with a highly valid measure, such as the work attendance of the participants, to exclude the effect of confounding factors. The second method uses the level of correlation between the dependent and independent variables [9] . The first method was not possible because of the anonymous nature of the study; thus, we applied the second method. To ensure content validity in the second method, the questionnaire should be checked for two issues. The first issue ensures that the independent variables have a minimum level of correlation with the measured dependent variables. This procedure was used to identify irrelevant questions. The second issue involves the identification of highly correlated independent variables. If there is a high degree of correlation between these variables, the questionnaire should be checked again. If possible, it is recommended that these questions be merged, resulting in a shorter questionnaire with the same level of validity.",
