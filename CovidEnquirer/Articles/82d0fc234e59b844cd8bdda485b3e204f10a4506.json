A traveler who is staying at a hotel for a limited period of time is commonly described as a guest. Besides providing for lodging and meals, hotels usually have newsstands, retail shops [such as boutiques], restaurants, cocktail lounges, [coffee bars,] health clubs, concierges, and other quality services [which may include laundry and dry cleaning services and business centers with high-speed Internet connections]. Generally, parking facilities are available [many of which include self-park and valet service]. Some have recreational facilities, such as saunas [spas/hot tubs,] and swimming pools, while others may offer tennis and racquetball courts, gyms, and exercise rooms.\" 4 According to Bell, [Hotels] are unique in that they almost always combine several different occupancies under one roof. In addition to guest rooms or guest suites, which are residential occupancies, hotels usually provide space for assembly occupancies such as ballrooms, meeting rooms, exhibition halls, and restaurants; or mercantile r occupancies such as shopping areas, gift shops, and other retail areas; and offices and commercial establishments, or business rr occupancies.",

The close proximity of customers, as well sometimes-informal situations in which they find themselves, can lead to problems. These include a myriad of incidents that can be referred to as acquaintance assaults. Examples are two people sharing a room who are fighting with one another, people meeting and getting into an argument in a lounge area, and incidents where one guest reports that he or she was sexually assaulted by another. These crimes often occur without witnesses. 10 \"There is the possibility that an assailant who victimized a guest followed the victim back to the [guest] room after encountering him or her elsewhere. There will be many instances when criminals readily spot out-of-state visitors, either in tourist areas or other locations, and target them at that time.\" 11r Such crimes may lead to attacks in hotel parking garages, as well as in the hotel itself.",

The thief then can be identified for future reference or prosecution. The amount of loss is usually not worth the time required to prosecute, so it is recommended that the name and description of the individual be recorded and distributed to all outlets in the hotel. You may also try alternate means of payment (e.g., having a family member pay, or requesting [a] form of payment like cash). If the person tries to obtain food or drink again, they can be refused until they pay for the previous bill\u2026.",

However, prostitution is a problem that, if not controlled, can ruin a hotel's reputation. The word controlled was used intentionally, for prostitution cannot and will not be eliminated. The security objective should be to reduce such activity to an absolute minimum. A hotel's reputation is, without doubt, its single most important asset.

The housekeeping department will know if a certain guest room has heavy traffic going to and from it and can alert security. Secondly, hotel managers must maintain a no-tolerance attitude towards prostitution while supporting security in its efforts to deal with the problem. Common meeting places for prostitutes are lobby pay telephones [now less frequent due to the advent of mobile telephones], bars, and easily recognized hotel fixtures such as chairs, plants, and the like. 14 Sometimes, hotel staff may even be involved in the prostitution activities. \"In some cases, employees working in collusion with the front desk or even with security staff members have provided prostitutes to guests.\" 15 If the problem cannot be adequately dealt with, hotel management, in consultation with legal counsel, may want to seek the cooperation of local law enforcement. r Of course, the tight registration process requiring photo identification and a valid credit card is for purposes other than that of prostitution. For example, if the guest is a victim of an accident, a crime, or a medical incident that renders him or her unconscious, dead, or missing, such information will be crucial in contacting next of kin, reporting to law enforcement and medical authorities, and so on. Also, it will assist in investigation of the guest not paying the hotel bill, including guest services, or may provide information if he or she is suspected of committing a crime. rr A guest folio is a \"printout of guest activity while in [a] hotel\" ( The sale and use of illegal drugs by guests can also occur in hotels. According to Beaudry, It is very unlikely that a hotel manager will be able to prevent a guest from using drugs in the privacy of his or her room. If, however, the manager becomes aware of such use, action should be taken. Limited use (e.g., smoking a marijuana cigarette) may best be handled by warning the guest that repeated activity will result in removal from the hotel. However, evidence of a more serious use (such as large parties with cocaine left out in the open) may require assistance from the local police. It is common for drug dealers to use large urban hotels to conduct their drug deals, for the size of the hotel usually will ensure their anonymity. 16 In addition, the potential also exists for a guest room to be set up as a temporary, mobile laboratory manufacturing illicit drugs such as methamphetamine. r A room can even be used for \"surreptitious meetings among dangerous persons such as [gangsters,] terrorists, and drug dealers.\" 17 Of course, due to the openness of hotels, this is difficult to prevent.",

The distinctions between hotels and motels are gradually disappearing, however\" ( Other information was obtained from various agencies and news sources, many of which are identified in the summaries of a number of the incidents in Chapter 3. At times, reports of casualties were conflicting. Therefore, the number of persons killed and injured could not always be definitively determined. r According to the New York Times, \"No precise number of casualties for the Marriott exists, but it is likely, based on eyewitness accounts analyzed by the New York Times, that no fewer than 50 people inside the hotel were killed. At least 41 of those were firefighters, and the number could be much higher. Besides Mr. Keller [Joseph Keller the executive housekeeper], another Marriott employee, Abdu A. Malahi, was killed. As for guests, 11 of the 940 registered guests that day were 'unaccounted for,' said Cathy Duffy, a spokeswoman for Marriott. It is not known if they died in the building or were elsewhere in the complex\" (Dwyer J, Fessenden F. One hotel's fight to the finish; At the Marriott, a portal to safety as the Towers fell. The New York Times, September 11, 2002 The most recent published study by Hall shows that \"in 2002, 25 high-rise buildings in these four property classes combined had 7,300 reported structure fires and associated losses of 15 civilian deaths, 300 civilian injuries, and $26 million in direct property damage.\" 26 He concluded that \"these statistics generally show a declining fire problem over the nearly two decades covered\" 27 and, similar to his previous findings, \"most high-rise building fires and associated losses occur in apartment buildings.\" 28 However, Hall did caution that, due to a number of factors (one being lower participation in national fire incident reporting in recent years 29 ), \"the patterns shown in data available so far should be given limited weight.\" 30 It is worth noting here that, as previously mentioned, some buildings, particularly \"larger-scale hotel building configurations often have atria two or three stories high and sometimes up to sixty stories high, which are often the focal point of building design. Atrium areas themselves may include several occupancies or mixed functions associated with hotel operations.\" 31 The presence of an atrium constitutes a fire risk. If a fire occurs on the lower floors of the atrium (for example, in a restaurant or a retail space), then the resulting smoke and heat can rise up through the atrium and possibly reach guest rooms on upper floors located on corridors that face toward the atrium). To reduce this risk, according to Brannigan and Corbett, Building codes specify numerous requirements for atria: full sprinkler protection throughout the building (with the exception of the top of the atrium itself if it is more than 55 feet [16.8 meters] above the floor because it is felt that sprinklers will not activate so high above the floor), a smoke control system to minimize the movement of smoke onto the adjacent floors to the atrium and to move the smoke out of the building, and standby power for the building. 24 In addition, the fire code requires that the floor of the atrium be limited to \"low\" fire hazards. Author Corbett has seen this violated many times with moderate and high fire hazards such as live, cut Christmas trees; propane grills in food kiosks; and large plastic displays. This provision is difficult to enforce (hence the desire for sprinklers at the top of tall atria). 32 It is worth noting here that in his book, High Rise/Fire and Life Safety, O'Hagan stated that high-rise residential building fires, including those in hotel rooms, to some extent are different in nature and not as severe as fires in high-rise office buildings (see earlier discussion in Chapter 2). Two of his stated reasons for this position are (1) highrise residential buildings are typically of masonry construction and lack the empty spaces between the interior of their exterior walls and the outer edges of their floors (that typify the curtain walls of steel-framed [core construction] buildings) and (2) for privacy and usage reasons, residential buildings are typically compartmentalized with walls and partitions that have adequate fire resistance to withstand the fire until the arrival of the fire department; as a result, individual fires are considerably smaller in area. 33",

If the guest goes to the reception desk with their photo identification, hotel reception staff can simply program another card for the guest. If the guest has left their personal identification in their room, hotel security or other hotel staff can accompany the person to the room in question, use their own access card to permit the guest entry to the room, and observe the guest retrieving their identification for confirmation of identity. In the case of the guest having left their access card in the room, the guest can then retrieve it; in the case where the card is not working properly, or has been lost, a replacement card can be made for the guest by the hotel. r In the past, keys were commonly issued to hotel guests to access and secure their rooms. However, keys can be fairly easily duplicated and present problems if they are lost or stolen. Today, throughout the world, most hotels issue electronic access cards-sometimes simply called keycards-that operate guest room electronic door locks. 46 For security reasons, most hotel access cards will display no identifying marks (such as the hotel's trademark, its name, or its address) that indicate where it might be used. Then, if a card is lost, there are no identifiers to indicate from which hotel it came. If used with an insertion or a swipe-type card reader, there may be an arrow depicting the correct way to insert or swipe the card (or other simple step-by-step instructions on its use). An advantage of an electronic access card is that if it is missing (either lost or stolen) or when a guest leaves the hotel, the card can be immediately deactivated at a hotel computer without the need to retrieve the card itself. (Some hotels allow guests to keep the card as a memento of their stay. However, if the card does not contain identifying information, then much of the appeal for keeping the card is diminished.) regarding the value of access card-controlled door locks, lauer stated, Since the introduction of the recodable electronic door lock in the late 1970's, hotel security has been virtually transformed. The focus at the time of inception was increased guest security, but the benefit to the property was quickly realized. Hotel security experts, along with media pundits, the courts, and the insurance industry all agree-keycard locks, which can be easily changed so that every guest gets a new key, are the best way to boost security\u2026.",

In order for a property to be maintained efficiently, hotel personnel require their own means of entry to rooms in which they must perform daily routines or tasks. In the past, distribution of conventional keys to housekeepers, room service attendants, and maintenance personnel compromised guest belongings and increased the liability of the hotel. In some instances of theft, the victim was often the hotel (where even the negligent customer is king), and claims went unchallenged. The \"burden of proof\" is welcome by a hotel equipped with modern electronic locks, for the actual lock serves as a log, monitoring and recording up to 1,000 entries (about 100 days worth). Many reputations have been restored and many a thankful employee has been cleared of suspicion due to the success of these products. Employee key cards can be coded to allow access only to their assigned units of responsibility and only during the hours of their shift. Knowledge of these system capabilities may also serve as a deterrent to those less ethical. 47 In the case of a reported theft from a guest's room, the event history of cards used to enter the room and when entries occurred can be determined by interrogating r the lock at the door itself (using a small hand-held device); or if the lock uses a hardwired or a wireless system, rr this information can be determined with the use of an online central computer at the front reception desk or the security command center, eliminating the 47 lauer e. \"Hotel security: The evolving electronic lock.\" Spring 1999. \ue02cwww.hotel-online.com/News/ Pressreleases1999_2nd/Apr99_electroniclocks.html\ue02e; August 2, 2008. r In this context, interrogate means to examine the audit trail of events when access cards were used to operate an electronic lock. need to go to each individual lock.

Some guests, as a fire life safety precaution, on first arriving at their hotel room immediately familiarize themselves by walking to the emergency exits on their floor, in particular noting the route leading to the nearest fire exit. Guests can also play an important part in any hotel life safety program by promptly reporting things such as suspicious persons or activities, safety hazards, or the smell of smoke to hotel management and security staff. exit signage (as described in Chapter 6) is also a critical part of the life safety program for hotel occupants. This includes floor evacuation plans that show the building core, perimeter, stairwells, elevators, every wall that faces every exit route, exit routes to the appropriate stairwells, symbols depicting the location of fire equipment and manual fire alarm devices, the floor number, fire department and hotel emergency telephone numbers, what stairwells have roof access, and what the fire alarm looks and sounds like.",

Groner (p. 2) went on to state in his paper that Progress in helping building management and emergency responders achieve situation awareness will require a fundamental change in how we approach the design of building protection systems. At present, our buildings are not well designed to achieve the needed level of situation awareness, despite the availability of many technological tools. Addressable detection devices can pinpoint the locations of detection of hazards, but the building interfaces used to display the information [do] not supply an immediately comprehensible understanding of the situation. Technological devices like CCTV cameras and smoke detectors are not deployed in ways that help building management and emergency responders understand the status of key egress systems like stairs and corridors. Research and development towards the support of situation awareness in buildings is a priority.",

Once given that list, particularly at night when guests are returning to their rooms with visitors they may have just met in a local bar, the security officer can screen all incoming guests at the front door. (This works very well when hotel policy regarding visitor access after a certain hour is implemented.) This method has two benefits. First, the innkeeper [may be] entitled as a matter of law to additional revenue if a second person is staying in the room. Second, if in fact the \"visitor\" is a streetwalker, not only will she or he not have identification as noted above, but the guest may or may not want to risk having a second person listed on the registration folio. rr",

Oakland, CA: American Protective Services, Inc.; 1980:11.A penthouse is a structure on the roof of a building to cover a stairway, elevator shaft, or other equipment, or a dwelling on the top floor or roof of a building (derived from Webster's Third New International Dictionary, Springfield, MA: Merriam-Webster, Incorporated; 1993). rr A concierge floor is a floor specially catering to guests (particularly business travelers) who are offered extra service such as a room with upgraded bedding and turndown service, access to a private lounge (some staying open from 6 a.m. to 10 p.m. each day), separate meeting rooms, and complimentary meals, drinks, newspapers, concierge services, and other amenities. Many concierge floors are access controlled and therefore provide an extra layer of security. \"Women prefer the security of concierge floors, many of which provide access only with a special key\" (levere Jl.

Such actions should always be reasonable and appropriate.\" 44 As ellis and Stipanuk further cautioned, Unauthorized or undesirable persons (as determined by management for each individual property) should be discouraged from visiting the property, but again, extreme discretion and tact should be used. When deciding whether to evict persons from the premises, great care should be taken to react to what they actually do as opposed to who they are or seem to be. For example, persons suspected of being prostitutes should be evicted with great care. It can be a costly and embarrassing error to question the character or reputation of an individual. Such questioning, if unfounded, can serve as basis for legal action for slander. r The eviction of persons from public space (such as the lobby and any restaurants) is governed by laws applicable to places of public accommodation. Management should review the statutes applicable to its location. On the other hand, guestrooms, and guest corridors are not deemed open to the public. No one other than guests, legitimate visitors of guests, and the property's employees should be in these areas. The normal laws of trespass apply in these areas and should be consulted. If employees see a suspicious person on a floor or in an elevator, they have the right to ask if he or she is a guest or a visitor. They can also ask to see the person's room key [or a keycard] or accompany the person to the room he or she intends to visit. Unauthorized persons may be asked to leave the property and warned not to return. 45",
