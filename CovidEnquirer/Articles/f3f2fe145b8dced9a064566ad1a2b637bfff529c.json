Bacterial and viral nucleic acids were detected in MEF of 78.8% and 14.5% patients, respectively. The prevalence was as follows: Streptococcus pneumoniae, 70.4%; Haemophilus influenzae, 17.9%; Staphylococcus aureus, 16.8%; Streptococcus pyogenes, 12.3%; Moraxella catarrhalis, 9.5%; rhinovirus, 9.5%; and adenovirus, 3.4%. The overall rate of PCR-positive specimens for bacterial pathogens was 2.6 times higher, compared to culture results. The rate of PCR-positive results and the distribution of pathogens in the Nph were similar to those in the MEF. Nph PCR results had variable positive predictive values and high negative predictive values in predicting MEF findings.",

Bacterial species, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, Moraxella catarrhalis, and Streptococcus pyogenes, predominate among AOM pathogens, being responsible for 80-90% of etiologically verified cases (Vergison, 2008) . Respiratory viruses like human rhinovirus (hRV), adenovirus (AdV), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and some others are occasionally found in the middle ear; however, their role as independent (primary) AOMcausing agents remains under discussion (Chonmaitree et al., 2012; Heikkinen and Chonmaitree, 2003; Nokso-Koivisto et al., 2015; Pitk\u00e4ranta et al., 1998; Ruohola et al., 2006; Vergison, 2008) . Nevertheless, pathogenesis of AOM in children is clearly related to acute respiratory viral infections (ARVI) that, by various means, facilitate translocation of pathogen-containing secretions from inflamed nasopharynx into the middle ear (Lieberthal et al., 2013) . In many cases, ARVI precede AOM, and the latter is considered as a complication of ARVI (Chonmaitree et al., 2008) .",

Cultural analysis depends on viable microorganisms; it has limited sensitivity and is laborious and time consuming. Principal bacterial otopathogens, S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae, belong to fastidious microorganisms with special demands for plating time and culture medium that may preclude the proper isolation of these species (Ueyama et al., 1995) . The advent of molecular methods like PCR has increased the prevalence of positive MEF findings for bacterial pathogens and placed several new viruses among potential AOM pathogens (Bulut et al., 2007; Nokso-Koivisto et al., 2004; Pitk\u00e4ranta et al., 1998; Ruohola et al., 2006; Ueyama et al., 1995; Williams et al., 2006; Yano et al., 2009) .",

A diagnosis of AOM was defined by otolaryngologists when a patient had acute illness lasting \u22647 days with signs and physical symptoms consistent with AOM, including earache, tugging at the ear, fever, redness, and bulging of tympanum. Patients who received an antibiotic prior to enrollment or had spontaneous tympanum perforation were excluded from the present study. MEF specimens were collected by otolaryngologists after tympanocentesis and swabbing the tympanic cavity with an eSWAB kit (Copan, Italy). This procedure was performed after removal of debris and cleaning of external auditory canal (lidocaine solution with ethyl alcohol, exposure for 1 minute). Each patient contributed 1 AOM case to the study. In bilateral AOM cases, MEF specimens were obtained from both ears. At the same visit, Nph swabs were collected by means of the eSWAB kit.",

Total DNA and RNA were extracted from a 100-\u03bcL aliquot using the RIBO-prep nucleic acid extraction kit and eluted into the same volume of an elution buffer. cDNA was prepared by reverse transcription of 30 \u03bcL of RNA with the REVERTA-L RT kit.

DNA from S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, S. pyogenes, S. aureus, and M. catarrhalis was detected in a quantitative manner. S. pyogenes and S. aureus were analyzed using the AmpliSens\u00ae Streptococcus pyogenes-screen-titre-FRT PCR kit and the AmpliSens\u00ae MRSA-screen-titre-FRT PCR kit, respectively.

Comparison of PCR with culturing demonstrated a higher sensitivity of the molecular method in detecting bacterial pathogens. The increased sensitivity of PCR may be attributed, at least in part, to the fact that PCR does not depend on bacterial viability. This is of special importance for fastidious otopathogens like S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae. Our results corresponded to an earlier report demonstrating that, in patients with otitis media, PCR was more sensitive than the conventional culture method in detecting MEF H. influenzae by at least 5 times (Ueyama et al., 1995) . Another explanation for culture negative/PCR-positive results could be the presence of nonculturable bacteria remaining in MEF after previous AOM episode (Palmu et al., 2004) . However, nonviable bacteria or DNA from dead bacteria may reside in the MEF no longer than a few days, being efficiently eliminated from the middle ear (Post et al., 1996) . Instead, MEF-detectable DNA may originate from the nasopharynx through a continuous feed of the DNAcontaining media. Moreover, the presence of bacterial biofilms has been proposed as a reason for culture failure but positive PCR results (Ehrlich et al., 2002; Palmu et al., 2004) .",

Clinically evident ARVI has been shown to associate with increased risk of AOM, involving a wide range of mechanisms. Although the significance of viruses in development of AOM has been suggested in a chinchilla model in vivo (Bakaletz et al., 1993) , their importance as independent etiological agents remains controversial. A viral infection facilitates the passage of bacterial pathogens from the nasopharynx into the middle ear, supporting progression to clinical illness (AOM) (Lieberthal et al., 2013) . Moreover, respiratory viruses, particularly hRV, promote spreading of bacterial agents among the human population and may produce an imbalance of the Nph microbiota enhancing proliferation of S. pneumoniae or H. influenzae there (Heikkinen and Chonmaitree, 2003) . Similarly, our present results do not favor the direct role of respiratory viruses in development of AOM demonstrating, in the majority of patients with AOM, low prevalence of viruses in conjunction with the presence of significant bacterial otopathogens in the MEF or nasopharynx.",

This may have biased our sample toward a more severe AOM, thus disturbing the pathogen distribution and increasing the proportion of detected bacteria at the expense of viruses. Next, we did not examine patients with spontaneous otorrhea who may have a more aggressive AOM course associated with bacteria like S. pyogenes. Finally, swabbing the tympanic cavity after tympanocentesis could have been less effective comparing to aspiration of the MEF in terms of collecting detectable amount of viral pathogens.",

Using MEF specimens as the reference, we demonstrated that the parallel PCR examination of Nph specimens provided useful information on MEF pathogens that had a high predictive value for excluding a pathogen. Investigation of the Nph microbiota could be a reliable proxy for MEF examination in epidemiological studies and in trials looking for potential benefits of new vaccines for respiratory pathogens. In addition, PCR analysis of Nph specimens could be helpful in predicting bacterial complications during ARVI, for instance, AOM.",
