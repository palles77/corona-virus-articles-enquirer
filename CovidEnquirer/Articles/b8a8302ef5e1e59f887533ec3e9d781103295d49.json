Herc5, the major E3 enzyme for ISG15, mediates the ISGylation of more than 300 proteins in interferon-stimulated cells. In addressing this broad substrate selectivity of Herc5, we found that: (1) the range of substrates extends even further and includes many exogenously expressed foreign proteins, (2) ISG15 conjugation is restricted to newly synthesized pools of proteins, and (3) Herc5 is physically associated with polyribosomes. These results lead to a model for ISGylation in which Herc5 broadly modifies newly synthesized proteins in a cotranslational manner. This further suggests that, in the context of an interferon-stimulated cell, newly translated viral proteins may be primary targets of ISG15. Consistent with this, we demonstrate that ISGylation of human papillomavirus (HPV) L1 capsid protein has a dominant-inhibitory effect on the infectivity of HPV16 pseudoviruses.",

Induction by interferon implied, more than 20 years ago, that ISG15 was a component of the innate immune response (Farrell et al., 1979) ; however, it has only been recently confirmed that ISG15 has antiviral activity against several types of viruses, including influenza, sindbis, herpes, human immunodeficiency, and ebola (Hsiang et al., 2009; Lenschow et al., 2005; Okumura et al., 2006 Okumura et al., , 2008 . In addition, several viruses have evolved mechanisms for interfering with ISG15 function: the NS1 protein of influenza B blocks ISG15 conjugation (Chang et al., 2008; Yuan and Krug, 2001) , SARS coronavirus encodes an ISG15 deconjugating enzyme (Lindner et al., 2007) , and the vaccinia E3 protein binds to ISG15 and blocks its antiviral activity (Guerra et al., 2008) . The ability of ISG15 to be conjugated to other proteins has been shown in some cases to be essential for its antiviral activity (Giannakopoulos et al., 2009; Lai et al., 2009 ). The biochemical function of ISG15 conjugation and the basis of the antiviral activities of ISG15 conjugation remain unknown.",

The human ISG15 E1 enzyme is Ube1L (Yuan and Krug, 2001) , and the E2 enzyme is UbcH8/Ube2L6 (Durfee et al., 2008; Kim et al., 2004; Zhao et al., 2004) . The major E3 for human ISG15 is Herc5, a HECT domain ligase that contains N-terminal RCC1 repeats (Dastur et al., 2006; Wong et al., 2006) . Herc5 depletion results in a dramatic decrease in ISG15 conjugation, affecting conjugation to the vast majority of cellular target proteins (Dastur et al., 2006) , and coexpression of ISG15, Ube1L, UbcH8, and Herc5 in non-IFN-stimulated cells reconstitutes broad and robust ISG15 conjugation (Dastur et al., 2006; Takeuchi et al., 2006; Wong et al., 2006) . Herc5 has also been shown to have antiviral activity against influenza A virus (Zhao et al., 2010) . EFP, a RING E3, has been reported to be an additional E3 for ISG15; however, only a single target has been reported (Zou and Zhang, 2006) . Therefore, whereas additional proteins may play a role in ISG15 conjugation, Ube1L, UbcH8, and Herc5 represent the core IFN-induced components of this conjugation system in human cells.",

These targets were present in many cellular compartments, and no functional classes of proteins were particularly overrepresented, although 12 IFNinduced human proteins were identified (Zhao et al., 2005) . A common structural or primary sequence element that confers ISG15 conjugation has not been identified, nor have poly-ISG15 chains been observed. Importantly, only a small fraction of the pool of a given target protein is generally modified (Zhao et al., 2005) . These observations raise the following questions: (1) how can a single ISG15 ligase be responsible for targeting such a large and diverse set of proteins, (2) what is the biochemical effect of ISG15 conjugation on target proteins, and (3) how can modification of a small fraction of any individual target protein have a significant effect on the overall activity of that protein? The findings presented here lead to a model that accounts for broad substrate targeting in the ISG15 system and provide a basis for understanding the antiviral activity of ISG15 conjugation.",

Surprisingly, when such lysates were immunoblotted with antibodies against previously identified target proteins, it was difficult to observe their modification.

Whereas modification of both proteins could be detected on very long exposures, modification of Hsc70 ( Figure 1B ) and four other constitutively expressed target proteins could not be detected (Table S1 available online).

These results prompted us to assay, as presumptive negative controls, several epitope-tagged human proteins that had not been previously identified as ISG15 targets. Five out of seven of these were also found to be ISGylated, including E6AP, p53, Dlg, Herc4, and Herc6 (Figures 3A and S2 and Table S2 ). Several nonhuman proteins were also assayed, including E. coli b-galactosidase, Shigella flexneri OspG, Salmonella typhimurium SopA, the TAP epitope tag (two copies of the protein A sequence and the calmodulin-binding protein), and two viral proteins (HPV18 L1 and HIV integrase). All of these were modified when expressed along with the conjugation components (Figures 3B  and S2 and Table S2 ). Three proteins were identified that were consistently not ISGylated in this assay system: GFP, human Wbp2, and a 35 kD carboxy-terminal fragment of paxillin.

Figure 4A (left panels) shows the relative levels of exogenously and endogenously expressed proteins in the absence of ISG15 (expression of target protein with Ube1L, UbcH8, and Herc5, without ISG15), using an antibody that detects both proteins. The exogenously expressed proteins could be detected by 6 hr posttransfection for both TAP-Ube1 and TAP-IQGAP1. For Ube1, the levels of the exogenous protein did not exceed that of endogenous Ube1, even at 30 hr post-transfection, whereas, for IQGAP1, the levels of exogenous protein were similar and perhaps slightly higher than endogenous IQGAP1 at 24 and 30 hr posttransfection (correcting for the 50% transfection efficiency). However, at the 18 hr time point, when the exogenously expressed proteins were clearly less abundant than the endogenously expressed proteins, ISGylation of the exogenously expressed proteins was detected when the target protein was expressed with all four conjugation components ( Figure 4A , middle). In contrast, modification of the endogenous proteins was not detectable at any time point ( Figure 4A , right). Therefore, the preferential modification of exogenously expressed proteins was not due to a higher steady-state level of the exogenously expressed target proteins.",

Also, in the five-plasmid transfections, the mRNA levels encoding the exogenously expressed proteins were 10-fold higher than the corresponding endogenously expressed mRNAs (based on three examples, Figure S4A ), suggesting that the exogenously expressed proteins, though not present at a higher steady-state level, were translated at a higher rate. These distinctions suggested that ISG15 conjugation might be limited to the newly synthesized pool of any given target protein. An additional observation consistent with this was the relatively high success rate for validation of IFN-induced ISG15 targets (e.g., p56, MxA) in IFN-stimulated cells (see Table S1 ), wherein the entire pool of these proteins is, by definition, newly synthesized.",

Therefore, 293T cells were transfected with the four plasmids and then pulse- labeled with 35 S-labeled cysteine either before conjugation was occurring (6 hr posttransfection) or while conjugation was occurring (22 hr posttransfection). Total cell lysates were collected 24 hr posttransfection, and an anti-FLAG immunoprecipitation was analyzed by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. Our hypothesis predicted that 35 S-containing proteins labeled at the early time point would not be ISGylated, whereas proteins labeled at the late time point, while conjugation was occurring, would be susceptible to ISGylation. A broad range of labeled proteins were conjugated to ISG15 in cells labeled at the 22 hr time point, whereas the pattern of labeled immunoprecipitated proteins from the early labeling period was only slightly above that seen in control untransfected cells ( Figure 5B , compare lane 2 to lanes 1, 5, and 6). The slight signal over background in the lanes corresponding to the early labeling period may be due to either a secondary mode of ISG15 conjugation (e.g., a minor Herc5-independent conjugation pathway) or due to turnover of the 35 S-cysteine and re-incorporation into newly translated proteins at later time points. This experiment was also performed using a FLAG-ISG15 expression plasmid encoding an ISG15 mutant lacking the N-terminal ubiquitin-like domain (FLAG-ISG15-DN), which is conjugated similarly to wild-type ISG15. As above, 35 S-labeled proteins were coimmunoprecipitated with FLAG-ISG15-DN when cells were labeled at the 22 hr time point, but not when cells were labeled at the 6 hr time point ( Figure 5B, lanes 3 and 4) . An anti-FLAG western blot of total extracts indicated that conjugation was robust in all samples expressing the conjugation components, regardless of the point at which the cells were labeled with 35 S-cysteine ( Figure S5 ). TCA precipitations of the extracts indicated that total protein labeling (dpm/mg of total protein) was similar among all samples (data not shown). These results were consistent with the notion that proteins are only subject to ISG15 conjugation if they are synthesized in the window of time that the conjugation machinery is active.",

Our hypothesis predicted that puromycin treatment of cells that were actively conjugating ISG15 would lead to the generation of polypeptides that contained both ISG15 and puromycin. Cells were therefore subjected to a four-plasmid transfection (FLAG-ISG15, Ube1L, UbcH8, Herc5) or a three-plasmid transfection that omitted an individual enzyme component. Twenty-four hours later, cells were treated with puromycin for 2 min before preparation of cell extracts. ISG15 conjugates were immunoprecipitated with anti-FLAG antibody and then analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-puromycin antibody. As shown in Figure 5C , cells expressing all four conjugation components contained a broad range of polypeptides that were modified with both ISG15 and puromycin. (33). Cell extracts were prepared at the indicated time points after transfection and analyzed by immunoblotting with antibodies against Ube1 or IQGAP1 to compare exogenous and endogenous protein levels (left). (Middle) HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing TAP-Ube1 or TAP-IQGAP1 plus Ube1L, UbcH8, Herc5, and FLAG-ISG15 (43). Cell extracts were collected at the indicated time points and analyzed with an antibody against TAP to detect ISGylation of the exogenous targets. Asterisks mark the earliest detectable conjugates to TAP-Ube1 and TAP-IQGAP1. (Right) HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing Ube1L, UbcH8, Herc5, and FLAG-ISG15 (43, with no exogenous target protein), and extracts were analyzed for modification of endogenously expressed Ube1 or IQGAP1. (B) Schematic of experimental design: blocking synthesis of an exogenous target protein blocks its ISGylation. A plasmid expressing an epitopetagged target protein was transfected at time zero; target mRNA (solid line) and target protein (dashed line) accumulated over the next 24 hr. Plasmids expressing Ube1L, UbcH8, Herc5, and FLAG-ISG15 were then transfected, either without or with an siRNA that recognized the target protein mRNA. In the absence of the target siRNA (left), modification of the target protein was expected to occur as the ISG15 conjugation components (double line) accumulated and the target protein continued to be synthesized. In the presence of the target siRNA (right), target protein mRNA would be destroyed as the conjugation components are expressed, but previously synthesized protein persist as a function of their rate of destruction; if continued target protein synthesis is required for ISGylation, then ISGylation of the target protein should not occur. (C) Knockdown of target protein mRNA blocks target protein modification. HEK293T cells were transfected with plasmids expressing either TAP-IQGAP1 or TAP-p53 and transfected again 24 hr later with Ube1L, UbcH8, Herc5, and ISG15, without or with siRNAs against IQGAP1, p53, or an off-target siRNA against hTfr (human transferrin receptor). Cell extracts were prepared 22 hr after the second transfection and analyzed by immunoblotting with anti-TAP antibody.",

We therefore determined whether endogenously expressed Herc5 cofractionated with ribosomes and/or polysomes. HeLa cells were treated with IFN-b for 24 hr, and cell extracts were fractionated by sucrose gradient sedimentation. Ribosome-and polysome-containing fractions, including the 40S and 60S ribosomal subunits, were identified by characteristic absorbance profiles at 254 nm and confirmed by immunoblotting with antiribosomal subunit antibodies. As shown in Figure 6A , the vast majority of Herc5 protein was within the polysome-containing fractions. Herc5 cofractionated with 80S ribosomes when extracts were treated with RNase ( Figure 6B ), which destroys the polysomes and leads to a large increase in the number of 80S ribosomes. This suggested that Herc5 was associated with polysomes via ribosomes, rather than mRNA. Consistent with this, Herc5 cofractionated with 60S ribosomes when extracts were treated with EDTA ( Figure 6C ), which dissociates polysomes and 80S ribosomes into 40S and 60S subunits. EDTA also releases nascent polypeptides from the 60S subunit (Ullers et al., 2004; Valent et al., 1997) , suggesting that Herc5 was unlikely to be tethered to ribosomes via nascent polypeptides. Herc4 is a HECT domain ligase that has 57% primary sequence similarity to Herc5 (Hochrainer et al., 2005) , but it is not IFN induced and does not function in ISG15 conjugation. Neither endogenously expressed Herc4 nor another unrelated HECT E3, E6AP/Ube3A, cofractionated with polysomes ( Figure 6A ).",

Type 1 IFNs are secreted by virus-infected cells to establish an antiviral state in uninfected surrounding cells. As these cells are likely to be the next sites of virus infection, we propose that the ISGylation system is designed to target newly synthesized viral proteins. However, even among newly synthesized proteins, ISGylation is inefficient, raising the question of how modification of a small fraction of a viral protein could have a significant antiviral effect. The answer may lie in the fact that structural proteins are not only among the most actively synthesized of viral proteins, but must often assemble into precise repeating geometric configurations to form infectious virus particles (e.g., capsid proteins). Therefore, ISGylation of even a small fraction of the total pool of a viral structural protein might have a dominant-negative effect on production of infectious virus.",

We therefore employed an HPV pseudovirus (PsV) system to measure the effect of ISGylation on infectivity (Buck et al., 2004; Buck and Thompson, 2007) . Papillomavirus virions are composed of 360 molecules of the L1 capsid protein and up to 72 molecules of L2 (Buck et al., 2008) . When L1 and L2 are expressed in the presence of an 8 kbp GFP expression plasmid, the plasmid is packaged as if it were viral genomic DNA; these PsV can then be isolated on velocity-density gradients and their infectivity measured by quantitating the delivery of the GFP reporter plasmid to naive cells. HPV16 pseudoviruses were generated in 293TT cells in which ISG15 conjugation was either occurring (cotransfection of ISG15 and E1, E2, E3 enzymes) or not occurring (cotransfection of ISG15 and inactive mutant forms of the E1, E2, and E3 enzymes). The presence of assembled PsV at the expected gradient fractions (Buck et al., 2004) was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy (data not shown). In the ISGylated PsV fractions, 10% of the total L1 protein was ISGylated ( Figure 7B ). The total amount of L1 protein in ISGylated PsV fractions was 30% less than in the control PsV fractions. Together, these observations indicated that ISGylated L1 was incorporated into PsV particles but that the overall yield of PsV was decreased. To examine the infectivity of ISGylated and non-ISGylated PsV, the peak gradient fractions were added to the culture media of 293T cells, followed by quantitation of GFP-positive cells by FACS analysis. Without normalization for total L1 concentration, the infectivity of ISGylated PsV was decreased 80% relative to the non-ISGylated PsV in three independent experiments ( Figure 7C ). With normalization, the infectivity of ISGylated PsV was 70% lower than non-ISGylated PsV ( Figure 7C ). These results establish that low-level ISGylation of a viral structural protein can have a dominant-negative effect on virus infectivity.",

As the exit tunnel for nascent polypeptides is on the 60S subunit (Kramer et al., 2009 ), an attractive model is that Herc5 modifies newly synthesized polypeptides cotranslationally as they emerge from the exit tunnel. Of interest, other protein modification enzymes have been identified that are ribosome associated and function near the exit tunnel, including methionine isopeptidase (Raue et al., 2007; Vetro and Chang, 2002) , N-terminal acetyltransferases (Green et al., 1978; Pestana and Pitot, 1975) , and chaperones that aid in cotranslational folding of proteins (Kramer et al., 2009) . Polysome association of Herc5 suggests that the inclusion of a translation system will be a requirement for reconstitution of in vitro ISGylation, which, Figure 7B , formed either in the absence (PsV) or presence (PsV + ISG15) of the ISG15 conjugation system. GFP-positive cells were counted 60 hr postinfection by FACS. The infectivity of wild-type PsV was set to 100%. Results are presented both without (middle) and with (right) normalization for total L1 protein concentration.

The low degree of target protein selectivity of the ISG15 system is consistent with the requirement that the innate immune response protect cells against a wide range of pathogens. An implication of this model is that modification of cellular target proteins may be simply collateral damage in the attempt to target viral proteins. This, in turn, may be tied to the observation that ISGylation is relatively inefficient: an inefficient ISGylation system might protect against excessive damage to cellular proteins while at the same time still being an effective antiviral due to dominant-negative effects on abundantly expressed virus structural proteins, as shown here with the HPV pseudovirus system. These results are consistent with results showing that mutant forms of viral structural proteins can, themselves, have a dominant-negative effect on infectivity ). In addition, potential dominant-negative effects of ISGylation are not necessarily limited to effects on virus structural proteins; any viral protein that oligomerizes would be a potential biologically relevant target in our model.",

            "text": "The biochemical function of ISG15 conjugation remains unknown. The two most general possibilities are that ISG15 signals to another protein or protein complex (e.g., in the way that ubiquitin signals to the proteasome) or that it simply disrupts the function of proteins to which it is conjugated. There is evidence to support the latter in studies that have examined individual target proteins (Jeon et al., 2009; Zou et al., 2005) , and this may also be inferred by ISG15 protein sequence comparisons between mammalian species. Unlike ubiquitin and most other Ubls, ISG15 protein sequences are very divergent. Only 72 out of 157 residues (46%) are identical between the human, mouse, rat, dog, cow, and sheep ISG15 protein sequences. We suggest that these divergent mammalian ISG15 proteins are unlikely to have retained a common signaling function and that the similarity retained reflects that which is required for maintaining the ubiquitin-like folds of ISG15 and for productive interaction with the conjugation enzymes. We therefore suggest that the function of ISG15 is to generally disrupt target protein function and, in particular, the functions of viral proteins. The HPV pseudovirus system provides a proof of principle that low-level ISGylation of a virus structural protein can have dominant-negative effects on virus infectivity. The precise step in the infectivity of HPV pseudoviruses that is affected by ISGylation of HPV capsids is not yet known but could range from receptor recognition to a defect in endocytosis or release from endocytic compartments to the delivery of the packaged DNA to the nucleus. The effect of type 1 interferons on HPV replication is known to be complex (Beglin et al., 2009) ; however, multiple studies have indicated that HPVs interfere with expression and/or function of components of the interferon response (Barnard and McMillan, 1999; Chang and Laimins, 2000; Nees et al., 2001; Ronco et al., 1998) . In addition, topical IFN-a is an approved treatment for certain HPV lesions (Slade et al., 1998) . The results presented here warrant an examination of the role of the ISG15 system in the response of HPV lesions to type 1 IFNs and, more broadly, of the effect on ISG15 on proteins of many other classes of viruses.",
