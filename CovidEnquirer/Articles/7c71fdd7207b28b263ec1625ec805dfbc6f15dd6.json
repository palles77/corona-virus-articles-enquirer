Therefore, there is a remarkable demand to identify viruses in a fast, selective and accurate way. Several biosensors have been designed and commercialized for detection of pathogenic viruses. However, they present many challenges. Nanotechnology overcomes these challenges and performs direct detection of molecular targets in real time. In this overview, studies concerning nanotechnology-based biosensors for pathogenic virus detection have been summarized, paying special attention to biosensors based on graphene oxide, silica, carbon nanotubes, gold, silver, zinc oxide and magnetic nanoparticles, which could pave the way to detect viral diseases and provide healthy life for infected patients.",

            "text": "Viruses are the smallest infectious agents that can cause many diseases such as influenza, chicken pox, flu, acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Ebola and etc. Viruses are intracellular parasites unlike other microorganisms. These agents have only a few number of responsible genes for the synthesis of new viruses and most of them used different enzymes which created by the host cell [1] . So, fast and well-timed diagnosis of these diseases is very important due to the limited treatment options. Virus detection usually requires specific methodologies and equipment as: cell culturing, antigen or antibody detection (ELISA, immunofluorescence, immunoperoxidase) hemagglutination assay, nucleic acid detection (Polymerase chain reaction) and gene sequencing [2, 3] . Most of these methods are time consuming, labor intensive and often expensive. Table 1 offers a comparison of advantages and limitations of some of the most commonly used methods for virus detection. Therefore, we need rapid, simple, sensitive, and accurate methods for detection of pathogenic agents [4] . So in order to find alternative methodologies without the mentioned limitations, recently there has been growing attention for using biosensors in biomedical applications based on the advantages of these methods such as high speed results, excellent sensitivity and suitable selectivity [5] . Moreover, since viral and bacterial diseases are real menaces to human life, there is a growing demand to detect them meticulously by advanced methods [6] . Biosensors are highly accurate, sensitive and specific measurement systems that can determine very low analyte concentrations in biological samples. A biosensor is an analytical device which made up biological elements; such as microorganisms, organelles, cell receptor, enzymes, antibodies, nucleic acids, etc. that produces signals (electrical, optical or thermal) based on the interaction with tested element and a transducer that converts these signals into a measurable electrical parameter [7] . Due to the use of specific biological elements, these measurement systems have unique properties for the identification and measurement of target analytes. The importance of biosensor components is to assure a high level of specificity based on particular binding sites. Different medical and clinical applications are expected for biosensors such as: i) fast diagnosis and treatment of illness like cancer or diabetes, ii) detection of pathogens, iii) measurement of drugs and their metabolites, iv) discovery of new drugs and v) evaluation of drug activity, vi) assessment and measurement of analytes in biological samples and early detection of diseases using rapid tests [7e9] .",

Continuous decrease in material dimension, from large scale to small one in the range between 1 and 100 nm, does not change biosensor properties but significantly improves their applicability. The surface interaction of the sensors with analyte becomes highly efficient due to the extremely large surface to volume ratios in Nano-size devices [15] . Therefore, nanoscale materials show unique features, functionality, and effects. Nowadays, nanotechnology is focused on the elimination of disadvantages of existing methods for virus detection to minimize costs and time consuming. Furthermore, the use of nanomaterials in the construction of biosensors resulted in increasing of efficiency and sensitivity of these systems [16] . By designing the interaction between biological element and nanomaterial-based transducer, we can have biosensors by widely usage for the detection of biomolecules and disease diagnostics. These devices can detect patients physiological status at the moment and safety analyze the food and environmental samples for pesticides and water pollution quickly [17] . Several nanomaterials; such as nanorods, nanotubes, nanowires, thin films, and nanoparticles have been explored for biomedical applications due to their functional electrical and mechanical features for biomedical applications [18] .",

So, by illuminating small QDs with ultraviolet radiation, electrons move to high energy bar and loss additional energy by return to a steady state. Finally, visible light emitted from them has high energy and tends to blue. Also by using ultraviolet radiation to large QDs, visible light is emitted from them, in the reddish range, due to the loss of excess energy and return to a steady state, because of the small energy gap and less energy losing.

This method is a type of dual-stain imaging technique, based on streptavidin conjugated Qdot525 and Qdot655, for HIV1 gp120 envelope glycoprotein and its highmannose glycan capturing by an anti-gp120 antibody, immobilized on a microfluidic chip (see Fig. 1 ). The capabilities of this system are not only selective for capturing and detecting HIV virus in whole blood but also makes possible to obtain countable imaging. Considering the analytical features, it provides high detection speed, due to the lack of blood sample pre-processing (<10 min), even with 10 mL of blood sample, cost effectively, and portability, thus providing a new and effective tool for valid identification of HIV [24] .",

[48] used the ability of surface decorating of CNTs for making them ready to immobilize on gold sheets to synthesize a modified electrode. Horseradish peroxidase enzyme was set on carbon nanotubes which contain capture probes, and then joined to the gold layers by Au nanoparticles. This biosensor was used for the detection of HIV virus effects in human body by investigation of Nuclear paraspeckle assembly transcript 1 (NEAT1). Because of unique structure designing in this biosensor, the target capturing was very high due to the great surface area of CNTs. The LOD was considerably low (0.8863 fM mL \u00c01 ). Also the linear calibration ranged from 1 fM mL \u00c01 to 100 nM mL \u00c01 .",

This method can be applied to in-vitro selected aptamers for detecting a wide range of analytes such as small organic molecules and divalent cations. Lu et al. [70] proposed a FRET system, containing AuNRs and fluorescein (FAM), for the detection of hepatitis B virus DNA sequences.

Their designed, structure led to a fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) process from FAM to AuNRs. The fluorescence intensity of FAM was consequently quenched. The decline of the fluorescence intensity of FAM (DF) was linear with the concentration of the complementary DNA from 0.045 to 6.0 nmol L \u00c01 and the LOD was as low as 15 pmol L \u00c01 (signal/noise ratio of 3).",

Nanotechnologies offer new tools to overcome these challenges and perform direct detection of molecular targets in real time. Emerging graphene oxide, silica, carbon, gold, magnetic nanoparticles and nanotubes provide delicate and accurate platform in this field. Apart from mentioned advantages, to guarantee the profits of biosensors, further efforts should be considered concerning the appropriate selection of nanomaterials. The immobilization method of the concerned nanomaterials and biological elements is critical in order to minimize the risk of mistakes and errors in virus detection. Another important issue is lifetime of the assay, which is sometimes considerable. Indeed, great effort is required to provide portable and reusable devices capable for discriminating of viruses with high selectivity and sensitivity levels. To sum up, advances in nanotechnology will be in a near future a great breakthrough in medicine to halt viral diseases and provide a healthy life to potentially infected patients.",
