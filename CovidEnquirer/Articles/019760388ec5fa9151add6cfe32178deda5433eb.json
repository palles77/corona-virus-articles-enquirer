            "text": "Bluetongue virus (BTV) encodes a single capping protein, VP4, which catalyzes all reactions required to generate cap1 structures on nascent viral transcripts. Further, structural analysis by X-ray crystallography indicated each catalytic reaction is arranged as a discrete domain, including a nucleoside-2 0 -O-methyltransferase (2 0 -O MTase). In this study, we have exploited the structural information to identify the residues that are important for the catalytic activity of 2 0 -O MTase of VP4 and their influence on BTV replication. The effect of these mutations on GMP binding, guanylyltransferase (GTase) and methylase activities were analysed by a series of in vitro biochemical assays using recombinant mutant proteins; subsequently their effects on virus replication were assessed by introducing the same mutations in replicating viral genome using a reverse genetics system. Our data showed that single substitution mutations in the catalytic tetrad K-D-K-E were sufficient to abolish 2 0 -O MTase activity in vitro and to completely abrogate BTV replication in cells; although these mutants retained the upstream GMP binding, GTase and guanine-N7-methyltransferase activities. Mutations of the surrounding substrate-binding pocket (predicted to recruit cap0) had variable effects on in vitro VP4 capping activity. Only triple but not single substitution mutations of these residues in genome resulted in reduced virus replication kinetics. This is the first report investigating the importance of 2 0 -O MTase function for any member of the Reoviridae and highlights the significance of K-D-K-E tetrad and surrounding residues for the efficiency of 2 0 -O MTase activity and in turn, for virus fitness.",

            "text": "Eukaryotic cellular and most viral messenger RNAs (mRNAs) are modified at their 5 0 termini with methylated cap structures, which promote stability and efficient translation [6, 9] . Recent studies on selected viral methylated caps have revealed that cap structures may also have a function in cloaking viral messenger from sensors of the host cell innate immune response [5, 12, 16, 17, 34, 35] . Most viral transcripts are characterized by a cap1 structure [ m7 GpppN 2m ] consisting of a 7-methylguanosine ( m7 G) linked by a 5 0 -5 0 triphosphate bond to the 5 0 end of the mRNA and the methylation of the 2 0 -OH group of the ribose of the first nucleotide. The cap structure is formed by an orchestrated series of reactions including the RNA triphosphatase, guanylyltransferase and the two methylase activities, viz., guanine-N7-methyltransferase (N7MTase) and nucleoside-2 0 -O-methyltransferase (2 0 -O MTase). Members of the Reoviridae, such as Bluetongue virus (BTV), encode specific viral proteins that are responsible for synthesizing the cap1 structures at the 5 0 termini of their RNA transcripts, similar to most eukaryotic and viral transcripts [23, 36] . BTV VP4, a minor structural protein, alone catalyses the formation of cap1 structure and therefore possesses multiple catalytic activities [18, 23, 24] . VP4 forms a complex with the viral polymerase (VP1) and RNA helicase (VP6) proteins, this polymerase complex (PC) is closely associated with 10 segments of dsRNA genome [10, 21, 28] within the doublecapsid virion particle. The PC is located at the 5-fold axis of the inner capsid layer formed by a single protein, VP3, which in turn is enclosed by a second layer of VP7 protein. This double-layered capsid or ''core'' is further enclosed by an outer capsid, composed of two proteins, VP2 and VP5, which are involved in virus attachment and entry into the host cells [27] . After cellular entry, the outer capsid is lost, releasing the core into the cytoplasm [11] where an active polymerase complex, which remains within the http N7MTase, guanine-N7-methyltransferase; m7G, 7-methylguanosine; m7, methyl group associated with m7G; PC, polymerase complex; BSR4, BHK-21 sub-clone expressing VP4; AdoMet, S-adenosyl methionine; VSV, vesicular stomatitis virus; WNV, West Nile virus; JEV, Japanese encephalitis virus unassembled core, synthesizes and extrudes new transcripts through pores situated at the core 5-fold axis [29] . The 2.5 \u00c5 X-ray crystallographic structure of VP4 showed that the protein has a unique structural organisation whereby each functional domain is arranged in sequential fashion to facilitate each catalytic activity required to form the cap structure of the newly synthesized transcripts [33] . Thus, VP4 offers an ideal model for characterizing each functional domain and determining their relative contributions to the virus replication cycle.",

In this report, we focused on the 2 0 -O MTase domain of VP4, which although possesses the consensus fold of the typical class I AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases and displays some structural similarities with Vaccinia virus VP39 and Dengue virus NS5 methyltransferase as well as containing some unique features, the precise roles of which are unclear. We used structural information to identify key residues within VP4 2 0 -O MT and verified their importance employing a series of biochemical assays and the BTV reverse genetics system.

Currently, there is no direct evidence available that this domain is indeed responsible for 2 0 -O MTase activity, although it includes putative signature catalytic residues, K178-D265-K306-E335, similar to the other catalytic motif of class I AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases ( Fig. 1; [33] ). Based on previous VP4 ligand binding data [33] and studies on other viruses, we hypothesized that aspartic acid 265 (D265) is critical for 2 0 -O MTase activity. We focused on D265 rather than other catalytic residues as it is in proximate distance with the residues that bind S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) and guanosine of the cap structure (Fig. 1 ). In addition, we identified a cluster of surface exposed amino acids N311, Y334 and R367 that are in close proximity to the guanosine in the ligand binding pocket ( Fig. 1 ; [33] ). In particular, Y334 and possibly N311 are predicted to interact with guanine of the cap0 [33] , while R367 is believed to be responsible for recruiting the N7 cap ( Fig. 1 ; [33] ). Thus, these residues could be important in assisting the 2 0 -O MTase catalytic activity either through direct interaction with cap0 or by recruiting it within the catalytic domain. Site-specific mutations into the coding region of VP4 were introduced to generate D265E and D265V to either conserve the charge or change the polarity of the residue. Similarly, residues N311, Y334 and R367 were mutated to an alanine either singly or in combination (NYR). The mutated constructs were expressed using the baculovirus expression system and each protein was purified in soluble fraction indicating that the specific mutations, in particular, the surface exposed substitutions, have little or no effect on solubility (data not shown).",

Firstly, we analysed the GMP-VP4 complex formation by the mutant proteins to ensure the process of autoguanylation was retained. The mutant proteins (D265E and D265V, N311A, Y334A, R367A and NYR) and VP4 WT were incubated with a 32 P-GTP for 30 min and products were analyzed by SDS-PAGE, followed by autoradiography. All recombinant mutant proteins exhibited formation of VP4-a 32 P-GMP intermediate complexes, albeit at variable amounts ( Fig. 2A) . There was some reduction ($4-20%) in GMP binding by all mutant proteins in comparison to WT VP4 but this was not significant. A number of residues within VP4 have been shown to bind guanosine and phosphates including residues Y334 and D265 [33] . Thus the reduction in autoguanylation observed by mutant proteins was likely due to disruption of specific guanosine interaction ( Fig. 2A) . No complexes were detected in the control reactions either with baculovirus lysate or in absence of any VP4, confirming the specific interaction between VP4 and GMP ( Fig. 2A) . Overall, the mutations did not result in a significant decrease in autoguanylation consistent with the unaltered structural integrity of each mutant VP4.",

To investigate the effect of mutations at the putative catalytic tetrad on 2 0 -O MTase activity, recombinant D265E, D265V and WT VP4 proteins were incubated with cap0 analogue ( m7 GpppG) in the presence of Ado[methyl-3 H]Met for 2 h. The cap analogue was purified to remove the unincorporated Ado[methyl-3 H]Met and transfer of methyl-3 H was determined. While the WT VP4 efficiently methylated the cap0 analogue, the two mutant proteins failed to methylate the cap0 analogue (Fig. 3A) . The values observed for D265E and D265V were equivalent to the two negative controls, with no significant differences observed between the two mutants (D265E, p < 0.1; D265V, p < 0.73; Fig. 3A ). Our results demonstrated that only recombinant WT VP4 protein was able to methylate m7 GpppG while the mutation of D265 to either E or V abolished this catalytic function. To ensure that the catalytic activities of the 2 0 -O MT and N7MT domains of VP4 act independently, we performed the same reaction as above but substituted the cap0 analogue ( m7 GpppG) with an unmethylated cap analogue (GpppA); the later is not a natural substrate for VP4 as the 5 0 penultimate base for BTV transcript is a guanosine. Both D265 mutant and WT VP4 proteins were able to methylate the GpppA cap analogue to generate m7 GpppA when compared with the cell lysate, indicating that the mutant proteins had retained the N7MT activity, albeit at reduced levels (Fig. 3B ). This set of results demonstrated that the D265 residue within the K-D-K-E tetrad is essential for VP4 catalytic activity. Further, these results may indicate that the 2 0 -O MT and N7MT catalytic domains act independently.",

As these mutations were designed to disrupt the recruitment of the BTV transcripts with cap0 from the N7-MT domain, we used an uncapped BTV ssRNAs acceptor, instead of cap0 analogue, as it is representative of the reaction by VP4 that occurs within the core particle. Mutant and WT VP4 proteins, uncapped BTV ssRNAs and Ado[methyl-3 H]Met were incubated together, BTV ssRNAs were purified and amount of methyl-3 H transferred to an equivalent amount of ssRNAs was determined. All mutant proteins showed significant reduction in transferring methyl-3 H to the uncapped ssRNAs (Fig. 4B) . The data demonstrated that the mutation of the putative cap binding pocket retained 2-O MTase activity but the efficiency of formation of cap1 structure on ssRNAs acceptors, however, was hampered. These results supported that these residues are involved in the in vitro catalytic activity of VP4.",

Crystal structure of VP4 revealed that the protein consisted of four independent, discrete functional domains each with a discrete role in the capping pathway. The putative 2 0 -O MTase domain which is were detected using monospecific polyclonal antibodies; aVP3 or aNS1 respectively. As a loading control, cellular protein b-actin was detected using aActin antibody responsible for the last catalytic reaction of the cap structure, is attached via a small linker to the other upstream enzymatic domains including kinase-like, GT and N7-MT that are responsible for the upstream reactions of pathway. The highly ordered structure of VP4 highlighted the importance of synthesizing BTV cap in a sequential manner. To date no functions have been assigned to any domain of VP4 and the purpose of this report was to obtain structure-based biochemical evidence for function focussing mainly on the 2 0 -O MTase domain by generating a series of targeted mutations in the recombinant VP4 as well as in the replicating viral genome.",

We initially ensured that the substitution mutations did not adversely hamper the upstream activity of the other domains and that the domains acted discretely as predicted. Since autoguanylation and guanylyltransferase reactions are the basis for all the downstream catalytic activities of VP4 and essential for initiating the cap methylation pathway, any interruption of these reactions would prevent the methylation of the transcripts. When examined in vitro, the mutations in either the catalytic K-D-K-E tetrad or surrounding residues were still capable of the upstream catalytic activities including autoguanylation and guanylyltransferase highlighting that the activities of these domains are most likely to be separate from 2 0 -O MT domain. The slight decrease in the formation of a stable GMP-VP4 complex exhibited by the single substitution mutation D265 (K-D-K-E) and Y334 (one of the three residues in cap binding pocket) supported the crystal ligand binding data, indicating that the substitutions might have disrupted the interaction with the penultimate 5 0 guanosine of the transcript and G0 base of GTP, respectively. Unlike the single site specific mutations introduced into rotavirus VP3 that abolished autoguanylation [22] , single and triple amino acid substitution within BTV VP4 did not disrupt other proposed sites of GMP interaction, suggesting that the structural integrity of the protein was maintained.",

It was not surprising, as similar results have been reported for mutation of the aspartic residue for many class I AdoMet-dependent methyltransferases [1, 13, 26, 34] . The D265 residue of VP4 is closely aligned to the residues bound to AdoMet and the guanosine of Cap0 [33] highlighting its importance for 2 0 -O MTase catalytic activity. Previous biochemical analysis indicated that methylation of the cap structure by VP4 followed a conventional pathway with N7MTase preceding the 2 0 -O MTase activity [23] . As the D265 mutation had abolished the 2 0 -O MTase activity of VP4, it was of interest to investigate whether the activity of the N7MT and 2 0 -O MT domains were independent, unlike what has been reported for flaviviruses [8] . Our results demonstrated that the D265 mutant proteins were able to methylate the cap analogue GpppA (a cap structure that does not occur naturally for BTV), indicating that the N7MT activity had been retained albeit to lower levels than the WT. Although, further validation is required, these results would suggest that as hypothesized, N7MT activity was located in a discrete domain, separated from the 2 0 -O MTase domain.",

The fact that VP4 D265 mutations abolishes the 2 0 O-MTase activity and were lethal for virus replication, highlights the biological significance of this residue and the critical nature of 2 0 O-MT for BTV replication. The formation of cap1 structure through the use of viral 2 0 -O MTase has been demonstrated to be an essential activity for virus replication for a number of RNA viruses (VSV, Coronavirus, Dengue, WNV, JEV; [1, 5, 7, 16] ). Such a drastic effect on virus replication due to a single mutation within the 2 0 -O MTase catalytic domain is not always observed for all viruses, most often only a reduction in the virus titres and growth kinetics has been observed [15, 20] . There are a number of plausible explanations for the failure to recover BTV mutants in normal cells. It is currently not possible to test these hypotheses as the VP4 used to complement function is assembled into the virions. Unlike the capping enzyme for other viruses which are non-structural (Dengue, alphaviruses, coronaviruses) VP4 is a minor structural protein and therefore the WT VP4 present in the complementary cell line is assembled into the core particle and cannot be dissociated from the virus.",

We postulated that a disruption of the residues forming the substrate/cap binding pocket would have an effect on the overall function of the domain. The ligand interactions studies with VP4 [33] enabled us to identify three residues that may be involved in binding the cap0 and/or its recruitment. The substitution of the three residues (N311, Y334, and R367) in the cap binding pocket, whether singly or in combination, retained the upstream cap methylation activities (autoguanylation and guanylyltransferase). Initially, the N311 and Y334 residues were hypothesized to interact with the guanosine residue while R367 is in proximity of the m7 of cap0. Our autoguanylation and m7-GTP data suggest that residue R367 probably interacts with the guanosine residue while N311 interacts with the m7 as also corroborated with the ligand binding data from crystallisation studies [33] .",

Only the introduction of the triple mutation resulted in significant effect on in vivo virus replication. The diminished 2 0 -O MTase activity could have a 2-fold effect on the virus fitness; firstly decreased protein production would result in less virus progeny, and secondly the virus' inability to control the innate immune response. Previously, we and others have shown BTV proteins regulate the innate immune response during infection [25, 31] , lower viral protein production and growth may correspond with a more robust immune response early in infection.",
