For this type of determination, tests should detect the presence of antibodies to viral or bacterial antigens and provide semi-quantitative results.

Commercially available tests utilize ELISA, CPIA, or agglutination technologies. These include microwells, dipsticks, membrane filtration systems, immunochromatography devices, and lateral flow systems. Prior to 1995 most tests required some form of sample pre-treatment to break down immune complexes typical in occult infections. At present, with few exceptions, the protocols are pre-treatment free. All tests utilize monoclonal antibodies, a combination of monoclonal and polyclonal antibodies, or polyclonal antibodies. Manufacturers include Synbiotics with microwell, agglutination and immunochromatography devices, Heska and Abaxis with in-office CPIA based products and Antech with a reference laboratory-based multi-analyte assay for heartworm antigen and antibody to 3 tick-borne pathogens. IDEXX produces a microwell test, a heartworm only SNAP test (Canine Heartworm Antigen Test Kit), and three multianalyte SNAP format antigen/antibody combination products: the SNAP 3Dx \u00ae , SNAP 4Dx \u00ae , and SNAP 4Dx \u00ae Plus\u2122 tests.",

The assay is constructed such that specific antibody is sandwiched between two antigens, one immobilized and one labeled with horseradish peroxidase (HRPO). Positive and negative controls are integrated into the assay. The SNAP ELISA was compared with the indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and WB for the detection of L. infantum antibodies in dogs (Ferroglio et al., 2007) . SNAP sensitivity and specificity compared to IFA were 91.1% and 99.2% and compared to WB were 93.4% and 98.3%, respectively. In a second study, the SNAP ELISA was shown to be sensitive and specific for detection for Leishmania chagasi infection in dogs (Marcondes et al., 2011) .",

These tests can be used to monitor vaccine application, for surveillance or as a test to differentiate vaccination from field infection (antibody to the Erns protein [to detect field infection]) in combination with the E2 marker vaccine.

Such assays are available from IDEXX Laboratories, LDL (Labor Diagnostik Leipzig) and Synbiotics, As with pseudorabies, there are tests available that allow differentiation of field infection from vaccination. A test is available from IDEXX and is designed to detect antibodies to the gE antigen of BHV-1. The test is compatible with vaccines from Fort Dodge/Pfizer and Intervet/Schering-Plough where gE has been deleted. The assay is configured in a competitive format in which an anti-BHV-1-gE monoclonal labeled with HRPO competes with antibodies to gE in the sample for binding to a BHV-1 antigen coated microwell. The presence of anti-gE BHV-1 antibodies indicates a previous exposure to a field strain or application of conventional gE-positive modified-live or killed virus vaccines. The presence of BHV-1 antibodies detected by a standard screening test, but absence of antibodies to gE antigen, indicates a response to a gE-deleted vaccine.",

Transmission of BLV occurs through the transfer of infected lymphocytes from one animal to another. Once acquired, viral infection is lifelong. An assessment of exposure to BLV via natural infection can be made by the measurement of specific antibody titer to BLV. A positive antibody titer to BLV indicates that the animal has been exposed to BLV and may be persistently and chronically infected (Johnson and Kaneene, 1991; Miller et al., 1981) .",

It is one of the most important pathogenic viruses in cattle, causing considerable losses in the dairy and beef industries worldwide. The virus crosses the placenta in infected, pregnant cows causing reproductive losses due to abortions, stillborn calves or calves that die early in life. When this infection occurs between ~45 and ~120 days of gestation, the calves that survive are immunotolerant to the virus and are persistently infected (PI), excreting large amounts of virus, thus perpetuating infection in herds. It is important to identify these PI animals to break the cycle of infection. As a consequence of the in utero infection, BVDV is a frequent contaminant of biological products, such as vaccines and pharmaceuticals, because fetal bovine serum is used to formulate these products.",

It is believed that PrP Sc having an altered conformation is able to transform PrP C upon association, thereby multiplying the pathogenic prion. PrP Sc molecules tend to aggregate and form plaques in the brain resulting in neuron destruction and vacuole formation. It is important to note that PrP Sc , having an altered conformation with an increased level of \u03b2-pleated-sheet folding, is less susceptible to protease degradation.",

Importantly, infected cattle can become infectious long before they exhibit any obvious clinical signs of TB detectable even with the most careful veterinary examination. Even if present, the clinical signs of TB in cattle are not pathognomonic. As a result, effective ante-mortem surveillance for bovine TB must primarily rely on the detection of infected cattle at an early stage by the use of sensitive immunodiagnostic tests (Adams, 2001; Anon, 2004; De la Rua, 2006) . Bovine tuberculosis continues to be an important livestock disease in many countries and its control and eradication is complicated by the lack of sensitive tests as well as the presence of significant wildlife reservoirs (deer, elk, badger, and possum).",

Abnormal serum pancreatic lipase levels are an indicator of pancreatitis. The importance of pancreatic lipase in the diagnosis and prognosis of pancreatitis failure is well demonstrated.

To achieve high specificity, each kit incorporates two unique immunoaffinity-purified sheep antibodies; one pair is specific for canine and a second pair is specific for feline NT proBNP. If present in the sample, NT proBNP binds to the capture antibody pre-coated on the wells and forms a sandwich with the detection or conjugated antibody. After a washing step, substrate (TMB) is added to the wells and bound NT proBNP is quantified by an enzyme-catalyzed color change, detectable using a standard ELISA plate reader. A standard curve is plotted using the calibrator values, and the concentration of NT proBNP in samples is calculated from this curve. Results should be interpreted along with other clinical and diagnostic information. Separate kits are made for canine and feline applications because the NT proBNP protein sequences and reference ranges are different for each species.",

Potential uses include verification of estrus, monitoring of the estrus cycle and screening for ovarian dysfunction. There are limitations for using progesterone levels to determine pregnancy status. The test can only be used if the AI or breeding date is known because the sampling date is critical. Measurement of progesterone should occur between 21 and 24 days post AI to align with decreased progesterone levels in an open cow's estrous cycle. Low progesterone levels at this stage cannot support a pregnancy. Progesterone testing can be very accurate for identifying open animals. Higher progesterone test results are difficult to interpret because of variability in estrous cycle duration, embryonic loss and other conditions. In addition a cow that was bred, while not in heat, may have a high progesterone level even though the animal is not pregnant.",

This hormone functions to regulate uterine activity and plays an essential role in the co-ordination of the estrous cycle. In addition, progesterone is essential to the survival of the embryo in pregnant mares. The hormone is produced by the corpus luteum during the estrous cycle and early pregnancy and by the placenta later in pregnancy. In the mare, serum levels of progesterone are low (<1 ng/mL) during estrus (heat) and rise rapidly to 10-20 ng/mL during the luteal phase. If pregnancy does not occur, progesterone levels drop again to below 1 ng/mL and the estrous cycle begins again. In the event of pregnancy, the progesterone concentration remains high throughout gestation.Accurate measurement of progesterone levels in the mare provides valuable information for equine reproductive management. Specific applications include: l l confirmation of adequate progesterone levels to maintain pregnancy (progesterone >4 ng/mL). l l detection or confirmation of estrus (progesterone <1 ng/mL). l l monitoring ovarian function either during the normal cycle or in the event of persistent luteal phase syndrome. l l evaluation of progesterone levels in conjunction with:(1) prostaglandin therapy; and (2) embryo transfer practices.",
