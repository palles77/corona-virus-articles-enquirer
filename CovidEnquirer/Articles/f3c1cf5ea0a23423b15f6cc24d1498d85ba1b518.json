Methods: Pneumonia patients aged !65 years who visited a study hospital in Chiba, Japan, were prospectively enrolled from February 2012 to January 2014. Sputum samples were collected from participants and tested for influenza virus by polymerase chain reaction assays. Influenza vaccine effectiveness (IVE) against laboratory-confirmed influenza pneumonia was estimated by a test-negative design. Results: Among a total of 814 pneumonia patients, 42 (5.2%) tested positive for influenza: 40 were positive for influenza A virus, and two were positive for influenza B virus. The IVE against laboratoryconfirmed influenza pneumonia was 58.3% (95% confidence interval, 28.8-75.6%). The IVE against influenza pneumonia hospital admission, severe pneumonia, and death was 60.2% (95% CI, 22.8-79.4%), 65.5% (95% CI, 44.3-78.7%), and 71% (95% CI, \u00c062.9% to 94.8%), respectively. In the subgroup analyses, the IVE against influenza pneumonia was higher for patients with immunosuppressive conditions (85.9%; 95% CI, 67.4-93.9%) than for those without (48.7%; 95% CI, 2.7-73%) but did not differ by patients' statin use status. Conclusion: IIV effectively reduces the risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza pneumonia in older adults.",

The diagnosis of pneumonia was made by staff physicians according to clinical signs, symptoms, and radiological findings. Demographic and clinical information was collected from patients and medical charts. Sputum samples were collected from patients at the time of enrollment. If the patient was unable to cough up sputum, sputum was induced with the inhalation of hypertonic saline solution. Details of study settings and designs have been described previously [2, 13] .",

However, despite an observed lower antibody response compared with that of younger adults [25] , recent evidence supports the protective effect of influenza vaccination against medically attended influenza in older adults. According to a systematic review by Belongia et al, the pooled IVE was 24% (95% CI, \u00c06% to 45%) for the H3N2 strain, 63% (95% CI, 33-79%) for type B, and 62% (95% CI, 36-78%) for the H1N1pdm09 strain among adults aged >60 years [4] .

Previous studies have estimated the IVE against all-cause pneumonia or influenza-related hospitalization in older adults [9, [26] [27] [28] ; however, these studies used less specific outcomes and may have underestimated the true IVE [17] . The TND study by Grijalva et al demonstrated that the overall estimate of IVE against hospitalization with laboratory-confirmed influenza pneumonia was 56.7% (95% CI, 31.9-72.5%) [10] . However, their study included all age groups, and only 16% of their patients were aged !65 years. In their analysis restricted to patients aged !65 years, IVE showed a positive effect but did not reach a statistically significant level (48.4%; 95% CI, \u00c033.3% to 80%). Therefore, the authors concluded that additional studies were needed to establish the IVE against pneumonia in older adults. Our study targeted this age group and demonstrated that the vaccine effectively reduces the risk of laboratory-confirmed influenza pneumonia by 58.3% (95% CI, 28.8-75.6%).",

However, our estimates are not dissimilar to those of previous reports: in the study by Grijalva et al, the IVE against influenza pneumonia related to the H3N2 strain in all age groups was 45.1% (95% CI, \u00c09.3% to 72.4%) [10] , and in another study conducted during the 2011-12 influenza season when H3N2 was the dominant circulating strain, the IVE against influenza hospitaliza- [29] . The use of sputum samples in our study may also explain our high IVE estimate. Identification of influenza from sputum samples may be more sensitive and specific than that from upper respiratory tract samples in diagnosing influenza pneumonia and may provide less biased IVE estimates [17, 30, 31] . Consistent findings in our sensitivity analyses also support the robustness of our IVE estimates.",
