            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a Gammacoronavirus that causes a highly contagious respiratory disease in chickens. A QX-like strain was analysed by high-throughput Illumina sequencing and genetic variation across the entire viral genome was explored at the sub-consensus level by single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) analysis. Thirteen open reading frames (ORFs) in the order 5 0 -UTR-1a-1ab-S-3a-3b-E-M-4b-4c-5a-5b-N-6b-3 0 UTR were predicted. The relative frequencies of missense: silent SNPs were calculated to obtain a comparative measure of variability in specific genes. The most variable ORFs in descending order were E, 3b, 5 0 UTR, N, 1a, S, 1ab, M, 4c, 5a, 6b. The E and 3b protein products play key roles in coronavirus virulence, and RNA folding demonstrated that the mutations in the 5 0 UTR did not alter the predicted secondary structure. The frequency of SNPs in the Spike (S) protein ORF of 0.67% was below the genomic average of 0.76%. Only three SNPS were identified in the S1 subunit, none of which were located in hypervariable region (HVR) 1 or HVR2. The S2 subunit was considerably more variable containing 87% of the polymorphisms detected across the entire S protein. The S2 subunit also contained a previously unreported multi-A insertion site and a stretch of four consecutive mutated amino acids, which mapped to the stalk region of the spike protein. Template-based protein structure modelling produced the first theoretical model of the IBV spike monomer. Given the lack of diversity observed at the sub-consensus level, the tenet that the HVRs in the S1 subunit are very tolerant of amino acid changes produced by genetic drift is questioned.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses (family Coronaviridae, order Nidovirales) are enveloped, single-stranded RNA viruses with large genome sizes of $25-30 kb. The family is split into four genera: Alpha-, Beta, Gamma and Deltacoronaviruses, each containing pathogens of veterinary or human importance. A current evolutionary model postulates that bats are the ancestral source of Alpha-and Betacoronaviruses and birds the source of Gamma-and Deltacoronaviruses (Woo et al., 2012) . The Alphacoronaviruses infect swine, cats, dogs and humans. Betacoronaviruses infect diverse mammalian species including bats, humans, rodents and ungulates. The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which verged on a pandemic in 2003 with 8273 cases in humans and 755 deaths is a Betacoronavirus. Another member of this genus, the recently-discovered Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (MERS-CoV) has claimed 88 human lives from 212 cases since April 2012, and dromedary camels are the suspected reservoir (Briese et al., 2014) . Genus Gammacoronavirinae includes strains infecting birds and whales (Woo et al., 2012; McBride et al., 2014; Borucki et al., 2013) and deltacoronaviruses have been described in birds, swine and cats (Woo et al., 2012) . The diversity of hosts and genomic features amongst CoVs have been attributed to their unique mechanism of viral recombination, a high frequency of recombination, and an inherently high mutation rate (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997) .",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a gammacoronavirus which causes a highly contagious respiratory disease of economic importance in chickens (Cook et al., 2012) . IBV primarily replicates in the respiratory tract but also, depending on the strain, in epithelial cells of the gut, kidney and oviduct. Clinical signs of respiratory distress, interstitial nephritis and reduced egg production are common, and the disease has a global distribution (Cavanagh, 2007; Cook et al., 2012) . The IBV genome encodes at least ten open reading frames (ORFs) organised as follows: 5 0 UTR-1a-1ab-S-3a-3b-E-M-5a-5b-N-3a-3 0 UTR. Six mRNAs (mRNA 1-6) are associated with production of progeny virus. Four structural proteins including the spike glycoprotein (S), small membrane protein (E), membrane glycoprotein (M), and nucleocapsid protein (N) are encoded by mRNAs 2, 3, 4 and 6, respectively (Casais et al., 2005; Hodgson et al., 2006) . Messenger RNA (mRNA) 1 consists of ORF1a and ORF1b, encoding two large polyproteins via a ribosomal frameshift mechanism (Inglis et al., 1990) . During or after synthesis, these polyproteins are cleaved into 15 non-structural proteins (nsp2-16) which are associated with RNA replication and transcription. The S glycoprotein is post-translationally cleaved at a protease cleavage recognition motif into the amino-terminal S1 subunit (92 kDa) and the carboxyl-terminal S2 subunit (84 kDa) by the host serine protease furin (de Haan et al., 2004) . The multimeric S glycoprotein extends from the viral membrane, and the globular S1 subunit is anchored to the viral membrane by the S2 subunit via non-covalent bonds. Proteins 3a and 3b, and 5a and 5b are encoded by mRNA 3 and mRNA 5, respectively and are not essential to viral replication (Casais et al., 2005; Hodgson et al., 2006) .",

            "text": "Dozens of IBV serotypes that are poorly cross-protective have been discovered and studied by VN tests and molecular characterisation of the S protein gene. Most of these serotypes differ from each other by 20-25% at amino acid level in S1, but may differ by up to 50%. S1 contains the epitopes involved in the induction of neutralizing, serotype-specific and hemagglutinaton inhibiting antibodies (Cavanagh, 2007; Darbyshire et al., 1979; Farsang et al., 2002; Ignjatovic and McWaters, 1991; Meulemans et al., 2001; Gelb et al., 1997) . Most of the strain differences in S1 occur in three hypervariable regions (HVRs) located between the amino acid residues 56-69 (HVR1), 117-131 (HVR2) and 274-387 (HVR3) (Moore et al., 1997; Wang and Huang, 2000) . Monoclonal antibody analysis mapped the locations of many of the amino acids involved in the formation of VN epitopes to within the first and third quarters of the linear S1 polypeptide (De Wit, 2000; Kant et al., 1992; Koch et al., 1990) , which is where closely-related stains (>95% amino acid identity) also differ (Bijlenga et al., 2004; Farsang et al., 2002) . Cavanagh (2007) proposed that these parts of the S1 subunit are very tolerant of amino acid changes, conferring a selective advantage. Recently, the receptor-binding domain of the IBV M41 strain was mapped to residues 16-69 of the N terminus of S1, which overlaps with HVR1 (Promkuntod et al., 2014) .",

It was anticipated, based on the published literature, that certain regions, and the S1 subunit HVRs in particular, would display significant sub-genomic variation.

The E protein gene was the most variable at the sub-consensus level, with 5 missense mutations and only one silent mutation across its 333 bp ORF. Despite its small size, the CoV E protein drastically influences the replication of CoVs and their pathogenicity. In the SARS-CoV, it was experimentally demonstrated that the E protein is not essential for genome replication or subgenomic mRNA synthesis, but it does affect morphogenesis, budding, assembly, intracellular trafficking and virulence. In fact, in SARS-CoV the E protein is the main antagonist associated with induction of inflammation in the lung, which causes the acute respiratory distress syndrome from which the virus derives its name (DeDiego et al., 2014) . No studies have been published for the IBV E protein, but the high variability demonstrated here suggests that it may be an important virulence factor in poultry, and that a higher mutation rate possibly provides an evolutionary advantage in overcoming host cellular immune responses.",

The coronavirus N protein is multifunctional, playing vital roles in viral assembly and formation of the complete virion and is required for optimal viral replication. Additionally, the CoV N protein is implicated in cell cycle regulation and host translational shutoff, displays chaperone activity, activates host signal transduction and aids viral pathogenesis through the antagonism of interferon induction (reviewed by McBride et al., 2014) . Given its fundamental roles in RNA binding, formation of the ribonucleoprotein complex and in the virion, it is not surprising that this structural protein is the most conserved, as evidenced by its gene having the highest ratio of silent mutations of all the genes analysed. The importance of maintaining the Fig. 1 . Genome organisation of QX-like IBV strain 3665/11. sequence integrity in the N protein in IBV was demonstrated by Kuo et al. (2013) , who reported that two residues within the Nterminal domain of a Taiwanese IBV strain were positively selected, and that mutation of either of these significantly reduced the affinity of the N protein for the viral transcriptional regulatory sequence.",

IBV was demonstrated to induce a considerable activation of the type I IFN response, but it was delayed with respect to the peak of viral replication and accumulation of viral dsRNA (Kint et al., 2014) . IBV accessory proteins 3a and 3b play a role in the modulation of this delayed IFN response, by regulating interferon production at both the transcriptional and translational levels. Interestingly, IBV proteins 3a and 3b seem to have opposing effects on IFN production in infected cells: 3a seems to promote IFN production, and 3b is involved in limiting IFN production, antagonising each other to tightly regulate IFN production (Kint et al., 2014) . Field isolates lacking 3a and 3b displayed reduced virulence in vitro and in vivo (Mardani et al., 2008) .

            "text": "ORF 4b is present in many international IBV strains (Hewson et al., 2011; Bentley et al., 2013) but is rarely mentioned in the literature since a canonical transcription regulatory sequence (TRS-B) could not be identified upstream of the encoding RNA. However, Bentley et al. (2013) demonstrated that IBV was capable of producing subgenomic mRNAs from noncanonical TRS-Bs via a template-switching mechanism with TRS-L, the conserved TRS in the leader sequence in the 5 0 UTR, which may expand the Gammacoronavirus repertoire of proteins. They specifically demonstrated the transcription of the 4b ORF by this mechanism. Although no studies have been performed determining ORF 4b 0 s functional role in the pathogenesis of IBV, the homolog in MERs-CoV is a potent interferon antagonist (Yang et al., 2013) . A single SNP causing a missense mutation was present in 11.3% of the sub-consensus population of the 4b ORF in this study. The single mutation in ORF 4c was silent, and the predicted protein contained a low complexity region. Low complexity regions are regions of protein sequences with biased amino acid composition, and may be involved in flexible binding associated with specific functions (Coletta et al., 2010) . ORF 6b, a 73 aa protein with a signal peptide and two transmembrane domains, was identified in the genome of strain 3665/ 11, and ORF 6b was also reported in TCoV and Australian IBV strains (Cao et al., 2008; Hewson et al., 2011) . The homolog in SARS-CoV is 63 aa in length and was identified as an endoplasmic reticulum/Golgi membrane-localised protein that induces apoptosis. Apoptosis may play an important role in promoting CoV dissemination in vivo, minimising inflammation and aiding evasion of the host's defence mechanisms (Ye et al., 2010) . Protein 6 from SARS-CoV accelerated the replication of murine CoV, increasing the virulence of the original attenuated virus (Tangudu et al., 2007) . Presumably, this accessory protein plays a similar role in IBV pathogenesis, although this remains to be determined experimentally.",

            "text": "Template-based protein structure modelling was used to predict the secondary structure of the IBV spike monomer, based on the available crystal structure for the MERS-CoV S1 and S2 subunits (Fig. 6 ). S1 and S2 were modelled separately in Raptor X and then superposed. The IBV S1 structure was arranged as two beta barrels and S2 formed packed a-helices. The S2 protein was not complete and the transmembrane domain was not represented since there were no sufficiently similar structures on which to model this region, but this is the first model of the spike protein monomer for IBV. HVR1 and the putative receptor binding domain maps to the apical beta barrel (Fig. 7(a) ) and HVR2 is located on the flat plane on the base of the apical beta barrel and the peptide connecting it to the basal beta barrel (Fig. 7(b) ). HVR3 maps to a region in the basal beta barrel of S1 that was predicted to contact or interact with S2 ( Fig. 7(c) ). The locations of the missense mutations detected by SNP analysis in the S1 and S2 subunits are indicated in Fig. 6 . Many of these SNPs mapped to codons encoding amino acids on the surface of the predicted structure, but two regions were notable. Firstly, the highly variable region in S2 spanning amino acids 889-901 was exposed on the S2 stalk, although folding of the remainder of the COOH domain may have influenced this conformation. Secondly, 668 Ile was exposed on a projection at the top of the monomer. This residue precedes the second furin cleavage site in the S2 subunit with the sequence 667 PISSSGR/S 674 . The cleavage of the S1/S2 furin motif ( 517 RRRR/S 521 in strain 3665/11) was found to be non-essential for attachment of IBV to the cell. Rather, it promotes infectivity within the cell. In studies with the Beaudette IBV strain, the second furin cleavage site in the S2 subunit was required for furin-dependent entry and syncytium formation, and the current hypothesis is that interplay between the S1 and S2 subunits determines virus attachment to specific receptors, determining tissue tropism of the virus (Promkuntod et al., 2013) . The exact biological roles of these areas in S2 that are prone to mutation remain to be experimentally determined.",

Indeed, Cook and co-authors (2012) state that ''IBV is found everywhere that commercial chickens are kept''. The implication is that although IBV was only discovered some 80 years ago, the variety of serotypes we now observe are the results of hundreds if not thousands of years of genetic drift and recombination, accelerated by modern poultry farming practises where chickens are kept in high densities, and inter-regional trade in poultry and other avian species.",

Although S2 subunits most likely do not contain an additional independent receptor-binding site, S2 in association with S1 forms part of a specific ectodomain which is critical to the binding of the virus to chicken tissues, which implies that both S1 and S2 contain determinants important to viral host range (Promkuntod et al., 2013) .

Experimental and field studies provide substantial evidence that use of a homologous IBV vaccine is best, but sometimes, intriguingly, protection can be offered by an unrelated vaccine, or by the use of two heterologous vaccines (Jones, 2010) . Genotyping and phylogenetic analysis of IBV are typically focused on the S1 subunit sequence, and Liu et al. (2014) caution against drawing conclusions based on a single gene sequence, particularly a partial gene sequence. The roles of the IBV E and accessory proteins and their roles in the pathogenesis of IBV have been completely overlooked, even when the roles of the homologs in other CoVs have been proven significant. Accessory proteins of IBV and other CoVs may also offer a new generation of vaccine targets: the use of codon-deoptimization of non-structural virulence genes in influenza A virus and respiratory syncytial virus resulted in genetically stable viruses that retained immunogenicity but were attenuated (Nogales et al., 2014; Meng et al., 2014) . Evidently virulence and immunogenicity in IBV is a multi-genic trait, and future studies must aim to pursue a better understanding and exploitation of the roles of various viral proteins in the host, if any advances are to be made in controlling the disease in poultry.",
