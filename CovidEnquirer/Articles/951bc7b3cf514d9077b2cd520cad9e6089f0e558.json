Jonathan had reluctantly resigned as director, Global AIDS Activities, World Health Organization, to become full professor at Harvard School of Public Health. I had taken a year's leave of absence from my position in Maine to enroll in Harvard's Master of Public Health program.",

Moved by his pleas for global commitment to the epidemic, I sought out Jonathan at the opening reception for new Harvard students. I shared his dreams for public health activism. We believed in inspiring others to careers in applied public health, so we initiated a brown bag lunch series for students and faculty to share experiences about work in public health (1). The common thread throughout these discussions was universal human rights and respect for human dignity.",

His lectures on universal human rights centered on the idea that health transcends geographic, political, economic, and cultural barriers. Jonathan drew on his past experiences with the HIV epidemic to argue that the developing world would never achieve economic or political stability unless the health of its people improved. He maintained that, if not addressed, the health problems of the developing world would pose a global threat. \"Public health,\" he wrote, \"too often studies health without intruding upon larger, societal, inescapably laden issues\u2026. If the public health mission is to assure the conditions in which people can achieve the highest attain-able state of physical, mental and social well-being, and if these essential conditions predominantly are societal, then public health must work for societal transformation\" (2) .",

Jonathan very much admired Eleanor Roosevelt, chair, Declaration of Human Rights Drafting Committee, who on the 10th anniversary of the declaration asked, \"Where, after all, do universal human rights begin? In small places, close to home-so close and so small that they cannot be seen on any map of the world. Such are the places where every man, woman and child seeks equal justice, equal opportunity and, equal dignity. Without concerted citizen action to uphold them close to home, we shall look in vain for progress in the larger world\" (3).",

We cannot promote safety and security if we fail to recognize, and advocate for, people around the globe who do not have access to basic health care, adequate living and working conditions, or education to enlighten their response to life's challenges.

Of 8,500 probable cases since March, >90% were reported from China (including mainland, Hong Kong, and Macau) and Taiwan. Of the other 27 countries reporting SARS occurrences, 23 reported <10 cases and the others 1-3 cases. The small number of transmissions in these other countries suggests that the close contact required for transmission did not occur, whereas in China, community-based transmission has continued. In contrast, the relatively large number of cases in Canada, the United States, Singapore, and Vietnam (which comprise 7% to 10% of the total SARS cases worldwide) is related to the fact that relatively prolonged contact occurred because of the patients' close cultural ties with China. Why does Japan still have no cases of SARS, despite its geographic proximity to the most affected areas? We suggest that transmission has not occurred because Japan remains a society mostly closed to non-Japanese persons and has a his-",
