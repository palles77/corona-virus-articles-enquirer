Objectives: For common upper respiratory viruses that cause vURIs, to determine the relative frequencies of virus detection by PCR in subjects with and without CFLIs. Study design: Prospective follow-up of 170 children aged 1-8.6 years through the CFLI season by daily parental diary for CFLI episodes and nasal secretion sampling using PCR assays for adenovirus, coronavirus (types 229E and OC43), influenza virus (types A and B), parainfluenza (types 1-3) virus, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Results: Virus was detected in 415 of 956 independent assays: 425 CFLI episodes and 531 non-CFLI periods were sampled; samples from 270 (64%) CFLI episodes and 145 (27%) non-CFLI periods contained virus detected by PCR. Rhinovirus was most frequently detected at 64%, followed by mixed viruses at 12%, RSV at 7%, and the other viruses at 3-5% of all detections. About 85% of RSV, influenza A and adenovirus detections were associated with a CFLI, whereas less than 62% of other virus detections were associated with CFLI. Conclusions: The frequency of PCR virus detection without CFLI was different among viruses. This introduces virus-specific biases to estimating the frequencies of specific complications attributable to a vURI when ascertained by CFLI identification.",

Because vURIs without CFLIs are not apparent, coincidence estimates for vURI complications are usually calculated as events/CFLI episode, which introduces an ascertainment bias that underestimates the true frequency of a complication that is attributable to a vURI (Doyle et al., 1999; Winther et al., 2006 Winther et al., , 2007 Doyle et al., 1994 #15) . This study determined if that ascertainment bias is virus-specific by defining the relative frequencies of subclinical vURIs for the most common viruses causing vURIs. The hypothesis tested is that subclinical vURIs are rare and that their relative frequency is not different among viruses. ",

Because there is no generally accepted criteria for assigning a CFLI in infants and children, CFLI presence/absence for each day was not based on predefined illness criteria, but rather on assignment for that day as determined by the caretaker. The initial plans were to collect secretion samples at regular intervals with supplemental sampling during CFLIs in the child or a family member but this was not possible for a variety of reasons. Consequently, a convenience sampling strategy was adopted that concentrated on CFLI periods, periods when the child's sib had a CFLI and other non-CFLI periods when acceptable to the children. For all years, the number of samples processed in each month from October through April was 149, 229, 219, 181, 211, 195 and 115 with some variability in the frequency of monthly samples among years.",

However, there were insufficient numbers of virus detections to determine if this rate was virus-specific (Winther et al., 2007) . In that analysis, 26% of CFLIs were \u2212PCR and the current results approximate that value (i.e. 36%). Because we did not assay all viruses that can cause CFLIs (e.g. metapneumovirus, human bocavirus), procedural failures with our assay may have occurred, and the assay sensitivities depend on the unmeasured dilution of aspirated nasal secretions and may be virus-specific, a viral etiology cannot be ruled out for those episodes. Also, those episodes may be associated with bacterial infection (e.g. Strep Throat) or nasal atopy and, thus, these presentations are best classified as UR inflammation of undetermined etiology.",
