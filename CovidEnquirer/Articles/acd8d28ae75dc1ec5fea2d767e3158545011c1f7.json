Interleukins (IL) -35 and IL-37 are newly discovered cytokines that play an 51 important role in suppressing the immune system. However, the expression of these 52 interleukins in patients with Madurella mycetomatis (M. mycetomatis) induced eumycetoma 53 has not yet been explored. This study aims to determine the levels of the IL-1 family (IL-1\u03b2, 54 IL-37) and IL-12 family (IL-12, IL-35) in a group of these patients and the association 55 between these cytokines levels and the patients' demographic characteristics. The present, 56 a case-control study was conducted at the Mycetoma Research Centre, Soba University 57 Hospital, University of Khartoum, Sudan and it included 140 individuals. They were divided 58 into two groups; group I: healthy controls [n = 70; median age 25 years (range 12 to 70 59 years)]. Group II: mycetoma patients [n = 70 patients; median age 25 (range 13 to 70 60 years)]. Cytokines levels were measured in sera using enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay 61 (ELISA). 62 There was no significant correlation between the IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12 levels and the lesions size 63 and disease duration, whereas levels of IL-37 and IL-35 were significantly correlated with 64 that. The analysis of the risk factors of higher circulatory levels of IL-37 in patients of 65 mycetoma showed a significant negative association with IL-1\u03b2 cytokine, where a unit 66 increment in IL-1\u03b2 will decrease the levels of IL-37 by 35.28 pg/ml. The levels of IL-37 67 among the patients with a duration of mycetoma infection \u2264 one year had significantly 68 decreased by an average of 18.45 compared to patients with a mycetoma infection's 69 duration of \u2265 5years (reference group).

Levels of IL-35 72 among the patients with duration of mycetoma infection \u2264 one year had significantly 73 decreased (p-value = 0.002) on average by 41.82 compared to patients with a duration of 74 mycetoma infection \u2265 five years (reference group). In conclusion, this study indicates that 75 both IL-35 and IL-37 are negatively associated with the levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12 in 76 eumycetoma mycetoma infection; and high levels of IL-37 and IL-35 may have a negative 77 impact on disease progression. 78 79 Authors Summary 80 Mycetoma is a progressive chronic granulomatous fungal or bacterial infection that may 81 result in massive destruction of subcutaneous tissues, muscles and bones. Mycetoma is 82 a neglected disease which is endemic in many tropical and subtropical areas. If the 83 disease is not treated properly, eventually it ends up with amputation and adverse 84 medical, health and socioeconomic effects on patients and the community.",

This infection progresses to affect pre-existing Th2 environment caused by schistosomiasis promotes the development of 140 mycetoma as patients with mycetoma were significantly more positive for schistosoma 141 antibodies than healthy endemic controls [9] . These findings suggested that Th2 like 142 response and anti-inflammatory/immunosuppressive cytokines could have a negative impact 143 on mycetoma development and disease progression. 144 IL-1 is a polypeptide which has two forms; IL-1\u03b1 and IL-1\u03b2. It is involved in the acute-phase 145 response and is accountable for several alterations that are related to the onset of various 146 medical disorders [15, 16] . It is demonstrated recently that higher levels of IL-1\u03b2 cytokine 147 are strongly associated with surgically treated mycetoma patients, in comparison to those 148 treated without surgery [17] . It is known that IL-1\u03b2 is a pro-inflammatory cytokine that is 149 involved in cell death coordination [18] . IL-1\u03b2 cytokine is cleaved into the mature, active and disease severity in murine aspergillosis [29] . In addition to its role in innate immunity; IL-174 37 plays a pivotal role in regulating adaptive immunity by inducing regulatory T (T reg ) cells 175 and impairing activation of effector T-cell responses [30] . To our knowledge, there has been 176 no study to report the relationship between IL-37 and mycetoma pathogenesis so far. poorly understood. However IL-35 is recognised as a typical anti-inflammatory cytokine, and 189 the predominant mechanism of suppression is associated with its ability to suppress T cell (Table 2) . On the other hand, the 287 levels of cytokine IL-1\u03b2 were constitutively negatively correlated with IL-37 and IL-35, ( Table   288 2). Furthermore, the levels of cytokine IL-37 were constitutively positively correlated with IL-289 35 (Table 2) . However, the levels of cytokine IL-37 and IL-35 were constitutively negatively 290 correlated with IL-12 (Table 2) . (Table 3) . Whereas, levels of IL-37 were constitutively positively correlated with IL-35 (Table   .

Furthermore, the circulating levels of IL-37 had significantly decreased with 369 increasing age groups [(19-24 years; p-value = 0.0100), 25-29 years; p-value =0.030 and 370 (30-39) years; p-value = 0.022)] (Table 8) . Interestingly, levels of IL-37 among mycetoma 371 patients showed a statistically significant difference between Itraconazole compared to 372 Ketoconazole, p < 0.001, (Table 8) . (Table 9 ). Additionally, the circulating levels of IL-35 showed no 384 significant association with the different age groups (Table 9) . Interestingly, treatment with 385 Itraconazole significantly increased circulating levels of IL-35 among mycetoma patients 386 compared to treatment with Ketoconazole, p-value <0.001, (Table 9) .

It is possible that mature 151 IL-1\u03b2 secretion by macrophages activates IL-1R1 on macrophages, fibroblasts and epithelial 152 cells, inducing production of the CXC chemokine CXCL1/KC, which binds to CXCR2 on 153 neutrophils and mediates recruitment of neutrophils from peripheral blood to stimulate 154 inflammation at the site of mycetoma invasion. Therefore, these higher levels of IL-1\u03b2 155 cytokine advocate a crucial role in M. mycetomatis pathogenesis. 156 IL-37, which is a member of the IL-1 family, has emerged as a potent anti-inflammatory degenerative intervertebral discs [23] and Graves' disease (GD) [24]. IL-37 protein level in 164 PBMCs and dendritic cells (DCs) is up-regulated when stimulated by Toll-like receptor (TLR) 165 ligands or pro-inflammatory cytokines [25]. In vitro, overexpression of IL-37 in macrophages 166 or epithelial cells greatly inhibits the production of major pro-inflammatory cytokines such as 167 TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IFN-\u03b3 and macrophage inflammatory protein 2 [25, 26]. In vivo, IL-168 37 transgene protects mice from lipopolysaccharide-induced shock and chemical-induced 169 colitis [19, 27]. IL-37 interferes with the innate protective anti-Candida host response by 170 reducing the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines and suppressing neutrophil 171 recruitment in response to Candida infection, resulting in increased susceptibility to 172 disseminated candidiasis [28]. Moreover, IL-37 markedly reduced inflammasome activation 173",

Given the direct immunosuppressive effect of IL-191 35, many studies have been conducted to evaluate its role in the development of several 192 diseases. IL-35 can suppress several types of chronic inflammatory diseases such as 193 inflammatory bowel disease [26], and decreased the severity of collagen-induced arthritis in 194 animals via enhancement of IL-10 production [39] and suppression of Th17 cells [40]. In an 195 asthma model, intra-tracheal instillation of IL-35 decreased disease severity by diminishing 196 the Th2 cell counts [41] and by reducing the production of IL-17 [42]. In bacterial infections, 197 Shen and associates [35] found that mice without IL-35 expression demonstrated an 198 improved resistance to infection with the intracellular bacterial pathogen Salmonella 199 typhimurium. In addition, IL-35 has been increased in the serum of adults and children with 200 sepsis, and administration of anti-IL-35 p35 antibodies diminished dissemination of the 201 bacteria in septic animals [43]. Similarly, tuberculous patients exhibited an increase in serum Sample collection 231 One hundred \u03bcl of blood was collected on Whatman qualitative filter paper, Grade 1, circles, 232 diam. 42.5 mm (Sigma-Aldrich Chemical Co., St. Louis, MO, USA) for the determination of 233 cytokines.

            "text": "represents a major health problem in many tropical and subtropical393    areas, there are no prevention or control measures for this neglected disease[22, 23]. In 394 mycetoma endemic areas, most individuals have antibodies against the causative agents.395    However only a few develop the disease [4]. Few researchers believed that patients who 396 develop mycetoma seem to be deficient in their cell-mediated immunity[6]. Hence, we 397 aimed to investigate the profiles of the pro-inflammatory (IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12) and the anti-398 inflammatory immunosuppressive (IL-37 and IL-35) cytokines among mycetoma patients 399 and their association with disease characteristics. As far as we know, this is the first study 400 addressing the relation between immunosuppressive cytokines and mycetoma infection. Our 401 data showed that eumycetoma patients presented higher circulating levels of IL-1\u03b2, IL-12, 402 IL-37 and IL-35 compared to controls. Moreover, serum levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12 were 403 significantly decreased with increasing lesions' diameter and disease duration, whereas 404 levels of IL-37 and IL-35 were significantly higher with increasing lesions' diameter and 405 disease duration. These findings indicate that immunosuppressive cytokines like IL-37 and 406 IL-35, which could suppress cell-mediated immune responses, may have a negative impact 407 on the disease progression. 408 Data of the current study clearly showed the serum levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12 in eumycetoma 409 patients with different lesion size and disease duration were positively correlated with each 410 other, and negatively correlated with IL-37. It has been demonstrated that the first line of the 411 innate immune response against mycetoma infection is by phagocytes, from which 412 macrophages represent the major phagocytic cells [50]. In general, protective immunity to 413 fungal infections [51] involves activation of Toll-like receptors (TLRs) generating 53]. IL-1\u03b2 and other pro-inflammatory cytokines are produced early 416 in response to fungal infections and promote phagocytosis and other means of the innate 417 immune response [54, 55]. Following inflammatory stimuli, several cell types including 418 immune and non-immune cells produce IL-37, as a protective mechanism to prevent 419 runaway inflammation and excessive tissue damage [56]. IL-37 directly inhibits generation of 420 pro-inflammatory cytokines and down-regulates macrophage cytokine release, and therefore 421 innate immunity [57, 58].Moreover, IL-37 induces macrophages towards an M2-like 422 phenotype [59]. M1 macrophages are the most critical effector cells in the innate immune 423 defence system and are characterised by high expression levels of iNOS, subsequent NO 424 production and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12 [60]. 425 However, M2 macrophages secrete anti-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-10 [61] and 426 express arginase 1, which inhibits NO production, thus rendering these cells ineffective in 427 killing infectious agents including fungal agents [61, 62]. Furthermore, DCs expressing IL-37 428 secreted higher levels of IL-10 and reduced levels of IL-1\u03b2 and IL-12. Therefore, the 429 presence of IL-37 in DCs impairs their function in prime T cells and promotes their ability to 430induce Treg cells that produce IL-10, which is also a potent anti-inflammatory cytokine[30].",

Based on the aforementioned data, we can speculate that 435 IL-37 could play a role in damping inflammatory response in mycetoma infection which leads 436 to disease progression and this is not in the patient's favour.",

It binds to the heterodimeric IL-12 receptor, which is principally present in T cells 181 and on natural killer (NK) cells [31].
