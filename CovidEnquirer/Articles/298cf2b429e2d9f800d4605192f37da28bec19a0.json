            "text": "We describe the epidemiology of infl uenza virus infections in refugees in a camp in rural Southeast Asia during May-October 2009, the fi rst 6 months after identifi cation of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in Thailand. Infl uenza A viruses were detected in 20% of patients who had infl uenza-like illness and in 23% of those who had clinical pneumonia. Seasonal infl uenza A (H1N1) was the predominant virus circulating during weeks 26-33 (June 25-August 29) and was subsequently replaced by the pandemic strain. A review of passive surveillance for acute respiratory infection did not show an increase in acute respiratory tract infection incidence associated with the arrival of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 in the camp. P andemic (H1N1) 2009 emerged in April 2009 and subsequently spread around the globe. The World Health Organization issued a pandemic declaration on June 11, 2009 (1,2). By October 25, 2009 , >440,000 laboratory-confi rmed cases, including >5,700 deaths, had been reported to WHO (3) . The fi rst case of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection was diagnosed in Thailand on April 28, 2009 , and subsequently the virus was detected in all provinces. The Thailand Ministry of Public Health reported 27,639 confi rmed cases and 170 deaths as of October 10, 2009 (4) . Myanmar (Burma) reported its fi rst confi rmed case of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infection during the week beginning July 5, 2009 , and by the end of October 2009 had reported <100 confi rmed cases with no deaths (5) . Although most infections caused by this new virus have been mild, severe disease has been reported, particularly in young adults (6) .",

During May-August, the incidence of LRTI and URTI in cases captured by the passive surveillance system was higher each month in 2009 than in 2008. The rates of URTI were similar in September and October of both years, whereas the LRTI rate was higher in October 2008 than in October 2009. Pandemic (H1N1) 2009 did not clearly increase in case-patients with ARI after its fi rst detection in the camp in August 2009. However, surveillance did not capture mild infections that did not result in visits to the outpatient department. The occurrence of most infl uenza A infections in patients who had pneumonia most likely refl ects a sampling bias, although infl uenza is a generally underrecognized cause of pneumonia in the tropics (24) . ILI is not a routinely used diagnosis for the clinic staff at Maela, so most of the ILI case-patients likely were not interviewed and sampled. However, when infl uenza A was identifi ed, pandemic (H1N1) 2009 case-patients were less likely than seasonal infl uenza case-patients to have been hospitalized. This information suggests that, in this population, illness caused by pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was no more severe than illness associated with seasonal infl uenza A. Several confounding factors, unrelated to the innate pathogenicity of the viruses, may account for this fi nding: 1) the timing of the modifi cation of case defi nitions in relation to the appearance of pandemic (H1N1) 2009; 2) differences in age distribution; and 3) presence of underlying illnesses in the patient groups. Data regarding underlying medical conditions were not collected as part of this surveillance so the effect of other conditions cannot be assessed. To prevent spread of infection, public health systems may request persons with ILI to self-quarantine, which might result in underestimation of the number of cases identifi ed in clinic-or hospital-based surveillance systems. During the 2009 infl uenza season, announcements regarding infl uenza and the need for good hygiene were made on the Maela public address system; healthcare workers reinforced these messages by home visits. Whether this intervention had any effect on healthseeking behavior remains unclear. An infl uenza triage system was in operation at the hospital, but our surveillance staff had access to patients seen and treated in this area.",

Most importantly, not every patient eligible for sampling was included, frequently because the patient refused or clinic staff failed to identify patients with illnesses that met the case criteria. These data were not recorded, so the effect of this bias cannot be estimated. As previously discussed, ILI is not a frequently used diagnosis outside this surveillance program, and most cases with this clinical syndrome were diagnosed as common cold. Many of the ILI cases documented were miscategorized in the clinic as pneumonia but were subsequently found not to meet the case defi nition, explaining the presence of persons hospitalized with ILI. Overall, these factors may bias toward sampling of case-patients who had more severe symptoms. Also, screening took place in only 1 of the 2 hospital outpatient clinics. However, because both are general clinics, the impact of this screening is likely to be refl ected in the absolute number of cases detected rather than in the proportion of ILI and pneumonia cases caused by infl uenza viruses. Regarding laboratory data, the likelihood of confi rmation of infl uenza infection is associated with the clinical case defi nitions in use: the strict ILI case defi nition used in our surveillance has a sensitivity of 98.4%-100% but a specifi city of only 7.1%-12.9% (25) . In another study, the probability of having a positive infl uenza virus PCR was directly related to magnitude of fever (26) . Therefore, given the bias toward severe cases, we may have considerably underestimated the impact of infl uenza in Maela.",

Also, given the mobile nature of refugee populations, calculating accurate incidence rates is diffi cult, although the monthly census in Maela enabled generation of relatively accurate fi gures for this population.
