In this study, the extra-cellular domain of NiV G protein was fused with hexahistidine residues at its N-terminal end and expressed in Escherichia coli. The expression under transcriptional regulation of T7 promoter yielded insoluble protein aggregates in the form of inclusion bodies. The inclusion bodies were solubilized with 8 M urea and the protein was purified to homogeneity under denaturing conditions using nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) affinity chromatography. The denatured protein was renatured by gradual removal of the urea. Light scattering analysis of the purified protein showed primarily monodispersity. The purified protein showed significant reactivity with the antibodies present in the sera of NiV-infected swine, as demonstrated in Western blot analysis and enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Taken together, the data indicate the potential usefulness of the purified G protein for structural or functional studies and the development of immunoassay for detection of the NiV antibodies.",

Recent outbreaks of the NiV and Nipahlike viruses in Bangladesh (WHO, 2004a,b) demonstrate the existence of a time bomb that poses a major health problem worldwide, which could destroy the economies of many countries. Therefore, there is a demand for rapid detection as well as serological diagnosis of the virus for monitoring the presence of the virus and its antibodies in individuals and animals in high-risk areas. Currently, production of immunological reagents for these assays require biohazard level 4 (BL4) laboratories which are limited only to a few countries worldwide.",

A vol-ume of 250 l of NiV-infected cell culture medium was used to extract total vRNA using the TRIZOL LS reagent (Life Technologies, USA), as recommended by the manufacturer. Extracted vRNA was used as a template for cDNA synthesis using the Superscript II RNaseH (\u2212) reverse transcriptase (Life Technologies, USA), which was subsequently used in a PCR amplification using the Platinum TM high fidelity Taq DNA polymerase (Life Technologies, USA). Two synthetic oligonucleotides, TGNiV forward (5 -GGGGGATCC-ATGGACAATCAGGCCGTGATC-3 ) and TGNiV reverse primers (5 -GGGGGGAAGCTTCTCAACCA-ATGATATGCACCA-3 ) were used to amplify the coding sequence of the NiV G gene between nucleotides 231 and 1737. The underlined nucleotides represent BamHI and HindIII cutting sites, respectively. These two primers were designed to eliminate the transmembrane and signal regions of the G protein of NiV. The PCR product was digested with BamHI and HindIII and cloned into the pRSET plasmid (Life Technologies, USA) that had been digested with the same restriction endonucleases. The resulting construction was transformed into E. coli strain BL21 SI (Life Technologies, USA). The expression was confirmed with SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis before subjecting to purification and further analysis. Broad range protein markers (Gibco, BRL) were used in SDS-PAGE and Western blot analysis. Swine anti-NiV polyclonal antibodies (1/500 dilution) were used as the primary antibody. Appropriate species-specific immunoglobulin conjugated to alkaline phosphatase (1/5000 dilution) was used as the secondary antibody.",

Briefly, bacterial cells from 250 ml culture were centrifuged at 3440 \u00d7 g for 10 min and the pellet was washed with PBS (10 mM sodium phosphate, 0.15 M NaCl, pH 7.5) and centrifuged as above. The cells were resuspended in 20 ml of B-PER reagent and the mixture was gently shaken at RT for 2 h before centrifugation at 27,000 \u00d7 g for 20 min to separate inclusion bodies from soluble proteins. After repeating the above extraction for two times, the inclusion bodies were resuspended in 10 ml of B-PER reagent containing 200 g/ml lysozyme (Sigma, USA), and the mixture was incubated at RT for 20 min before adding 100 ml PBS. The inclusion bodies were collected by centrifugation at 27,000 \u00d7 g for 20 min. The pellet was resuspended in 100 ml of B-PER reagent in PBS (1:10 dilution) and centrifuged as above. The extracted inclusion bodies were dissolved in 5 ml of denaturing buffer (6 M guanidine HCl; 20 mM NaPO 4 , pH 7.8; 500 mM NaCl) and loaded onto a pre-equilibrated column packed with 5 ml of nickel-nitrilotriacetic acid (Ni-NTA) agarose (Life Technologies, USA). The protein-bound Ni-NTA resin was first washed with 10 ml of denaturing binding buffer (8 M urea; 20 mM NaPO 4 , pH 7.8; 500 mM NaCl) followed by washing with 20 ml of denaturing wash buffer (8 M urea; 20 mM NaPO 4 , pH 6.0; 500 mM NaCl). The column was washed with another 20 ml of the above washing buffer at pH 5. The bound recombinant protein was finally eluted with 10 ml denaturing elution buffer (8 M urea; 20 mM NaPO 4 , pH 4.0; 500 mM NaCl) and the sample fractions were analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting. The fractions containing the purified recombinant protein were pooled and first dialyzed against 6 M urea for 6 h. The dialysis was continued by the addition of 250 ml of 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5) every 12 h for three times and finally the dialysis solution was replaced with 25 mM Tris-HCl (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 0.2% Triton X-100 and 5 mM \u2424mercaptoethanol, and dialyzed for another 12 h. The purity of the sample was studied with a dynamic light scattering (DLS) instrument (DynaPro-MS/X, Proterion Inc., UK) at 20 \u2022 C, and at least 20 measurements were taken at each experiment. All DLS measurements were performed at 824.8 nm wavelength laser at 90 \u2022 angle.",

Flat-bottom polystyrene microtiter plates were used as solid-phase adsorbents (TPP Immunomax high binding flat-bottomed ELISA plate, USA). The plates were first coated with anti-swine IgG (1/3000) (KPL, USA) for overnight at RT. After washing, the plates were blocked with 200 l of SEA BLOCK blocking buffer (Pierce, USA) for 1 h at RT. Subsequently, the plates were washed and incubated for 2 h at RT with appropriate dilution (1/100) of the swine sera from infected and noninfected animals. Following another round of wash-ing, 100 l of optimum concentration (100 ng/well) of the recombinant G protein in TBS was added in the wells and the plates were incubated at RT for further 1 h.

A total of 20 NiV positive sera and 5 negative sera from healthy swine were tested, and the results showed that the purified G protein reacted specifically with antibodies in NiV positive samples (Fig. 2) . This reflects the reliability of the purification procedure in eliminating bacterial contaminants from the G protein.",

The process of growing the virus in cell cultures, however, requires BL4 laboratories. In addition, the use of NiV is restricted in certain countries due to biosecurity considerations. Therefore, an ELISA based on a recombinant protein, as capturing antigen, is simpler to produce and perform than ELISA based on inactivated virus. The latter is hazardous and not suitable for large-scale surveys.",

The results of the Western blot analysis and ELISA test suggest that the recombinant G protein exhibits the antigenic epitopes and conformation necessary for specific antigen-antibody recognition. The inclusion bodies before purification showed negligibly low background on Western blot but when used as the coating antigen in ELISA, a relatively high background was observed. This was probably either due to the presence of bacterial protein (s) and/or existence of some antibodies recognizing conformational epitopes in ELISA. The results of the light scattering also confirmed the impurity of the inclusion body sample and monodispersity of the purified recombinant protein. Based on the molecular mass of the recombinant G protein (57 kDa) and the assumption that it is spherical form, the calculated radius of the protein is about 3.4 whereas the R h of the purified protein detected by DLS was about 14 nm. This implies that the protein most probably exists in multimer forms (trimer or tetramer).",

The validation of the recombinant G protein ELISA was carried out using 25 samples of swine sera. The aim was to determine the variability of negative and positive sera using ELISA based on recombinant G protein. The newly established assay was able to distinguish clearly the two groups of samples based on their reactivity. However, the result of the ELISA should be interpreted cautiously, since proper standardization of the ELISA requires sera from experimentally infected animals followed by testing a more significant number of field serum samples. Unfortunately, it was not possible to obtain sera from experimentally infected animal sera due to lack of the BL4 laboratory throughout this study and also to the limited availability of the field sera.",
