Th e 90-day hospital readmission rate for survivors (n 5 7,637, 79.4%) was greatest for patients with pneumonia attributed to potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria (11.4%) followed by viral pneumonia (8.3%), pneumonia attributed to antibiotic-susceptible bacteria (6.6%), and culture-negative pneumonia (5.8%) ( P , .001). Multiple logistic regression analysis identifi ed pneumonia attributed to potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria to be independently associated with 90-day readmission (OR, 1.75; 95% CI, 1.56-1.97; P , .001). Other independent predictors of 90-day readmission were Charlson comorbidity score . 4, cirrhosis, and chronic kidney disease. Culture-negative pneumonia was independently associated with lower risk for 90-day readmission. CONCLUSIONS: Readmission aft er hospitalization for pneumonia is relatively common and is related to pneumonia pathogen characterization. Pneumonia attributed to potentially antibiotic-resistant bacteria is associated with an increased risk for 90-day readmission, whereas culture-negative pneumonia is associated with lower risk for 90-day readmission.",

By 2015, the policy is expected to include readmissions for COPD, coronary artery bypass graft surgery, percutaneous coronary interventions, and other vascular procedures. 3 In fi scal year 2013, the maximum payment reduction for hospitals with excess readmission rates was 1% but increases to 2% in 2014 and to 3% for 2015 and beyond. 4 ",

Th e assessment of readmission was performed among hospital survivors. We used a x 2 test or Student t test, as appropriate, for univariate analyses. Th e Mann-Whitney U test was used for continuous, nonparametrically distributed data. All analyses were two-tailed, and a P value of , .05 was assumed to represent statistical signifi cance. We relied on logistic regression for identifying variables independently associated with 90-day readmission. Based on univariate analysis, variables signifi cant at P , .10 were entered into the model. To arrive at the most parsimonious model, we used a stepwise backward elimination approach. We evaluated colinearity with correlation matrices. We report adjusted ORs and 95% CIs where appropriate. We conducted a cross-validation of the model to assess for overfi tting. We reran the logistic model on 90% of the sample, sequentially dropping 10% of the population with each run.

Previous pneumonia studies have shown that inappropriate initial antibiotic therapy due to infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria is associated with increased risk of mortality. 18 Micek et al 19 recently demonstrated that inappropriate initial therapy for communityacquired pneumonia in the ED setting was associated with a signifi cantly greater risk of hospital readmission. Multivariate analysis using hospital readmission as the dependent outcome identifi ed antibiotic exposure in the previous 30 days, presence of peripheral vascular disease, and increasing CURB-65 (confusion, blood urea nitrogen . 7 mmol/L, respiratory rate . 30/min, BP , 90 mm Hg, systolic or diastolic BP \u0545 60 mm Hg, \u0546 age 65 years) scores as predictors for readmission. Like the Department of Veterans Aff airs study, 16 pneumoniarelated variables did not predict readmission. However, Micek et al 19 also found that antibiotic exposure in the previous 30 days was independently associated with inappropriate antibiotic therapy, thus providing a link between inappropriate therapy and hospital readmission. However, it is likely that for most patients, infection with antibiotic-resistant bacteria is a marker for greater underlying disease severity and comorbidities, further supporting a plausible link between pathogen type and readmission risk. 13, 20, 21 Understanding the risk factors for hospital readmission in patients with pneumonia could provide insights into whether such readmissions are preventable as well as how to best tailor strategies to prevent readmissions. Moreover, such data could more objectively identify hospitals caring for patients at higher risk for readmission because of case mix, potentially mitigating fi nancial penalties for readmission in those patients. Th e latter is supported by a study by Shorr et al, 22 who found that patients with health-care-associated pneumonia were more than seven times as likely to be readmitted to the hospital compared with patients with communityacquired pneumonia. Th ese investigators showed that admission from long-term care, underlying immunosuppression, prior antibiotic exposure, and prior hospitalization within the preceding 90 days were predictors for readmission. None of these risk factors would be amenable to direct intervention by the treating clinicians to reduce the likelihood of readmission. Th ese investigators were also unable to establish a relationship between appropriateness of antibiotic therapy and being rehospitalized, thus illustrating that care delivery may have only a limited causal role in driving rehospitalization. Th e absence of a nexus between initial antibiotic therapy for the index pneumonia and readmission underscores that nonmodifi able patient or pathogen characteristics are likely key determinants of whether a subject with pneumonia is eventually readmitted. Our data would support this hypothesis by identifying pneumonia pathogen characterization as an important risk factor for readmission.",

Moreover, the retrospective nature of this investigation did not allow an assessment of specifi c treatment considerations such as the response to antibiotic therapy and pneumonia recurrence, and limited our ability to identify readmissions to nonsystem hospitals. Second, we focused on pathogen type as a determinant of readmission and not the appropriateness of antibiotic therapy. Th is was purposefully done, given the established strong association between antibiotic-resistant bacteria and host-specifi c risk factors (eg, prior antibiotics, recent hospitalization), as well as with the administration of inappropriate antimicrobial therapy. [11] [12] [13] 18, 19 Pathogen type seems to be a simple marker encompassing these risks, to include the administration of inappropriate therapy, and is in line with the Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services goal to discover more easily identifiable objective measures to assess patient risks and quality of care. 23 Third, we simply categorized pathogens into broad categories without determining whether certain pathogens, or pathogen subtypes, were more likely to be associated with 90-day readmission.",
