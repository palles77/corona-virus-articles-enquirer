The complex physiologic events that are associated within the estrus cycle, in pregnancy, or during the postpartum periods are accompanied by dramatic tissue changes in the gonads, tubular, and external genitalia, such as marked hyperplasia, atrophy, necrosis, hemorrhage, and tissue invasion. These are changes that pathologists usually associate with pathologic processes. Consequently, when presented with reproductive tissues, an examining pathologist must start with a firm understanding of the normal embryology, anatomy, and reproductive physiology of the species under study. Additionally, the reproductive tract co-opts cytokines, immunologic and inflammatory components for physiologic functions complicating interpretation. Awareness of these is essential.",

The classification of DSD is now based on as complete a description of the underlying abnormality as possible, beginning with the sex chromosome type, presence of SRY, gonad type, tubular genitalia, and external genital phenotype. As sex chromosome typing Initial development of the indifferent ducts, tubules, and external genitalia is the same in male and female embryos. Anatomically, the internal organs in the \"indifferent\" stage consist of 2 bilaterally symmetrical ductal systems-the mesonephric (Wolffian; male) and paramesonephric (M\u00fcllerian; female) ducts-and the developing, but uncommitted, gonad. Additionally, the mesonephric duct develops tubular extensions at its cranial end that extend into the hilar area of the gonad. Although the uterine tubes, uterine horns, body, cervix, and cranial vagina develop from the paramesonephric duct, the mesonephric tubes become the rete and contribute to the sex cords of the ovary. Normally the ducts of the opposite sex regress; however, their embryonic remnants are frequently encountered in otherwise normal adult animals, appearing as grossly detectable cystic structures in or near the ovary, uterus, cervix, or vagina. There is clitoromegaly and partial fusion of the vulvar lips.

If the hymen is complete, secretions may accumulate and subsequent bacterial infection of the contents can produce pyometra. In cows, moderate hypoplasia of the cervix, in which some rugae are absent and the canal widely patent, may prevent closure of the canal and predispose to persistent invasion of the uterus and chronic endometritis. Occasionally, the cervical canal is irregular in its course or even tortuous. Although this may not interfere with conception following natural breeding, insertion of an inseminating catheter may be difficult or impossible. Repeated attempts to pass a pipette can lead to cervical trauma, occasionally complicated by formation of traumatic inclusion cysts or abscesses. ",

Failure of a single follicle to ovulate need not interfere with pregnancy and single large cysts, 2-3 cm in diameter, may be found in pregnant animals. They are presumed to represent mature follicles that did not ovulate, but single anovulatory cysts may also be associated with irregularity of the estrous cycle. The association is more clearly manifested with multiple cysts. The cysts vary in type from follicular, which are lined by normal granulosa cells, to luteinized cysts. Multiple luteinized cysts, with some cysts up to 5 cm in diameter, are a distinctive feature of cystic ovarian disease in swine. The luteal tissue may form a complete rim or be present in patches. The endometrium in cases of multiple luteal cysts shows hyperplasia of progestational type, and in long-standing cases the clitoris is enlarged.",

But, as the original syndrome has been brought under control, a much more insidious form of estrogenic infertility in ewes has emerged as the result of chronic or repeated ingestion of low levels of phytoestrogens. This syndrome causes less severe reproductive losses, but the infertility tends to be permanent. Its anatomic basis consists primarily of subtle cervical changes that also impair sperm transport. The cervical lesions are those of blunting of the cervical folds, with a reduction of the number of folds and crypts associated with an increase in the stroma of the lamina propria. There is an increase in coiled tubular glands of the endometrial type in the cervical lamina propria. This change is most severe at the cranial end of the cervix. This glandular induction is the reason the disease has been referred to by the awkward name of estrogen-induced transdifferentiation. The persistent effects of estrogen also bring about modification of sexual behavior; some ewes develop a more male behavior, clitoromegaly, and fusion of the ventral labia. These changes are mild, and the disease can be best identified by careful cervical histologic examination, determining the number of folds, and quantifying the area of the lamina propria.

The epithelium has a cytokine profile that varies with the cycle and exposure to infectious agents.

The functional activity of the neutrophils migrating into the uterus may also be affected by the stage of the cycle, being more active during estrus than diestrus, but much of the reduced uterine resistance during diestrus and pregnancy is related to secretion into the uterine lumen of progesterone-induced immunosuppressants that are capable of inhibiting lymphocyte proliferation.

Probably all mares have uterine infections by streptococci within 1-3 days of parturition, but these do not persist for more than 2-3 days. In the cow, too, it has been observed that 25-30% are infected in the normal puerperium but that most recover spontaneously from these infections with T. pyogenes, E. coli, and other bacteria. Clearly, the outcome will be determined as much by the number and virulence of invading organisms as by the environment within the uterus. The recognized predisposing causes outlined previously will all be associated with retarded uterine involution, as will most cases of metritis. With the more virulent anaerobic bacteria, such predisposition is not essential.",

However, the demonstration of abnormal karyotypes in early bovine and porcine zygotes and in a high percentage of unselected spontaneous human abortions suggest that chromosomal or other genetic abnormalities are an important cause of this mortality. The frequency with which chromosomal abnormalities are found varies with the stage of pregnancy; they are most common in the early stages of pregnancy. This is the pattern one would anticipate because some of the most severe anomalies are not compatible with attachment or implantation. Most of these chromosomal abnormalities represent numerical changes such as monosomy, polysomy, polyploidy, and mixoploidy. Only a small percentage is structural. The monosomies and polysomies are the result of nondysjunction during meiosis or early cleavage stages. Triploidy can be caused either by 2 sperm fertilizing one egg or by the suppression of the second polar body and one sperm fertilizing a diploid egg; both possibilities increase with increased age of the gametes. Tetraploidy occurs as a result of suppression of the first cleavage division of the zygote. Mixoploids develop as a consequence of mitotic error during cleavage division of the zygote.

Infections that result in rapid death of the fetus (e.g., bovine herpesvirus, Trueperella pyogenes, Histophilus somni) usually result in a severely autolysed fetus, as time is required for the corpus luteum to lyse, the cervix to dilate, and for prostaglandin to contract the uterus and expel the fetus. In infections that are chronic and take time to kill the fetus (e.g., B. abortus, most mycotic abortions, Yersinia pseudotuberculosis), the preparations for abortion may be complete by the time the fetus dies, and therefore the fetus will be aborted in a relatively well-preserved condition.

The causes of infectious death of the conceptus during the period of the fetus are the same as previously, but the consequences, pyometra or acute endometritis, are usually more severe because of the presence of decomposing fetal remnants. The differences between pyometra and endometritis are as discussed earlier; in pyometra the corpus luteum may persist, the cervix remains sealed, and the uterus withholds its contents. If the corpus luteum and cervical seal break down, there is purulent discharge of the contents, and except for the presence of fetal remnants, this endometritis does not differ much from that of the puerperium. After about the third month of pregnancy in the cow, complete fetal maceration does not occur. Fetal bones, and to a degree, fetal hair resist maceration ( Fig. 4-66 ). They may be discharged or retained in the purulent exudate (pyometra) or remain in the uterine lumen indefinitely. The uterine pus is usually intensely fetid until maceration is complete.",

Some of these syndromes have been only partially defined, but in all cases adequately documented, evidence of fetal anomaly, either anatomic or functional, has been present. Two of the syndromes in cattle have a genetic basis, the trait being governed by autosomal recessive genes, the defective fetus being homozygous. \u2022 The first of these, which is most common in the Holstein and Ayrshire breeds, produces a nonviable large calf after a gestation period that is approximately 2 months longer than normal. The parturition is abnormal; the maternal preparations of relaxation of the pelvic ligaments and filling of the udder are minimal, and assistance is usually necessary. The calves are large, but of nearly normal proportions. They suffer from severe respiratory distress. Death is due to either these respiratory difficulties or uncontrollable hypoglycemia. The adrenals are hypoplastic, and this is thought to be the lethal defect in the syndrome. \u2022 In the second type of inherited prolonged gestation, which is seen in Guernsey, Jersey, and Swedish Red and White breeds, fetal monsters are common. Many of these animals have severe head anomalies of the cyclopian type, but in some the defect is discrete and consists only of the absence of the pituitary. Adenohypophyseal aplasia is common to all of them. These fetuses fail to develop after approximately the seventh month of gestation, and the length of gestation appears to be determined by the viability of the fetus. Some gestation periods last 17 months; at this time, presumably, the placenta can no longer adequately provide for the fetus, and the dead fetus, still developmentally immature, is expelled. Not all syndromes of prolonged gestation in cattle fit this pattern either genetically or anatomically, and sporadic of placentomes. The inadequate number of placentomes is primarily endometrial and may be congenital or acquired. There are normally 75-120 caruncles in the cow and 40-125 in the ewe and goat. Not all of them are fully used in a normal single pregnancy. Occasionally, the numbers are much less as a congenital disorder of endometrial organization; more commonly, the reduction in number is acquired by inflammatory destruction of portions of the endometrium. Compensation consists of a great increase in the size of remaining caruncles during pregnancy, many of which may fuse, and by the development of a more primitive villus placentation between the placentomes. The adventitious placenta tissues usually develop first adjacent to the placentomes; the process may remain localized or involve virtually the entire intercotyledonary placenta, chiefly along the floor of the uterus. In the latter instances, pregnancy is insecure and may not proceed beyond midterm. Hydrallantois is a complication. Adventitial placentation has not been observed in the sheep or goat placenta.",

Samples not required are easily discarded later. The results of serology are more easily interpreted on a herd basis than on an individual animal and may be particularly useful when samples are collected before pregnancy or at the time of pregnancy diagnosis and again at the time of abortion. This technique has proven very useful in the diagnosis of leptospirosis. Only a representative portion of the group need be sampled to establish a baseline titer. Two samples from a dam that has just aborted may contribute little useful information as many agents that subsequently cause abortion have initiated production of a high antibody titer long before abortion occurs. Serum antibody titers are often within the \"normal\" range at the time of abortion. Interpretation of the significance of antibody titers may be further complicated in that many animals may not respond to the agent with the production of antibody, and yet the animal may be carrying the organism and abort because of it. Up to 22% of cows aborting because of Leptospira hardjo infectious causes. Lesions are most frequently observed on the conjunctival surface and vary from a slight infiltrate of mononuclear cells to a severe necrotizing reaction. As in other areas, the cellular infiltrate may be determined by the duration of the infection before death of the fetus. In cattle, Yersinia spp., Ureaplasma, and mycotic infections are commonly associated with a heavy focal mononuclear cell infiltrate just under the conjunctiva, whereas T. pyogenes infection may result in complete loss of conjunctival epithelium, and the accumulation of large numbers of bacteria, but few inflammatory cells, on the surface. Many bacteria, including T. pyogenes and Listeria, continue to multiply after the death of the animal. BVDV infection may initiate perivascular lymphocytes and cause injury to hair follicles. The pattern of follicular hair growth when compared to the age of the fetus may determine the time of infection. Mycotic infections cause folliculitis; however, the lesion is very variable, not only as to its presence but also its severity, and although intracorneal pustules may be seen, frequently either no lesion is observed, or traces of inflammation and fungi are only found in the outer sloughing keratinized debris.

Diseased cotyledons are yellow and pulpy; many have yellow necrotic villi at the margins, and in others these are scattered throughout. There may be dense accumulations of neutrophils among the denuded villi and in the stroma. The degree of placentitis is quite variable and may be inconspicuous. The parasitism of the chorionic epithelium that is characteristic of Brucella occurs but is less evident in placentitis caused by C. fetus subsp. venerealis. Lesions in the fetus are nonspecific. Blood-stained fluid in the subcutis and body cavities is common, and there may also be fibrin on the serous membranes. The normal colorless thick viscid fluid of the stomach content becomes yellow, very turbid, and flaky.",

The syndromes of encephalitis and abortion may occur together in a herd or flock, but rather surprisingly, this is the exception. More commonly, one or the other syndrome occurs exclusively. L. monocytogenes varies greatly antigenically; serovars 1 and 4b are commonly isolated from cattle and serovars 4b and 5 from sheep. Serovar 5 (L. ivanovii) seems particularly pathogenic for sheep. L. ivanovii as a cause of abortion in sheep and cattle occurs less frequently than L. monocytogenes and rarely causes other conditions.

Type hardjobovis is distributed widely and is the only type isolated from cattle in North America. Type hardjoprajitno is a highly virulent type of Leptospira and has not been isolated in North America but has mainly been associated with cattle in Europe. Both hardjobovis and hardjoprajitno are spread by urine, postabortion discharges, infected placenta, and sexual contact, or by in utero infection to the fetus. L. interrogans serovar pomona is maintained by swine and some other animals and is a common cause of incidental leptospirosis in cattle. Exposure of nonvaccinated dairy cows to L borgpetersenii serovar hardjo type hardjo-bovis has been shown to be associated with increased breedings required per conception. Diagnosis may be confirmed using immunologically based tests to environment just beneath the surface of a silage bale provides conditions for productive growth of the bacteria.

Fetal infection is considered to be by hematogenous spread from the placenta, with an incubation period of about 5-12 days. Abortions in both cattle and sheep caused by Listeria occur during the last trimester of pregnancy. The percentage of pregnant animals that abort within any group is variable; usually the abortions produced are sporadic, but sometimes 50% of pregnant animals may abort. If uterine infection develops during the early part of the last trimester, the organism quickly invades the placenta, and the fetus dies as a result of septicemia. The dead fetus is expelled in approximately 5 days; by this time autolytic changes mask minor gross lesions produced by the organism, and all organs teem with bacteria, which continue to multiply after death of the fetus. Abortions at this stage are not usually accompanied by severe systemic disease in the cavity fluids by the time the organism has localized in the fetal kidneys. Cows aborting fetuses infected with L interrogans serovar hardjo may have high microscopic agglutination titers, but up to 40% are reported as not having a significant titer, and more than half of those may have no detectable titer. Prospective serology on a herd basis has been reported to be of considerable value in sorting out titers resulting from vaccination and either previous or present infections.",

Infected swine develop bacteremia before the leptospires localize in the kidneys and uterus, where they may persist and can be shed for months.

Human and domestic animal infection occurs when contaminated dust is inhaled; however, massive contamination of a paddock or pasture facilitates oral transmission. Infection apparently persists indefinitely in sheep and cattle, and organisms are shed at parturition and in the milk and feces. Abortion usually follows initial exposure and may be unusual in endemically infected flocks. Abortion tends to occur late in the gestation period, and weak lambs and kids may be born during an outbreak. The aborted fetus may be well preserved or autolysed. Gross lesions are confined to the placenta, which is thickened and leathery, with multifocal to confluent areas of mineralization.

The name is a misnomer, as epizootic bovine abortion (EBA) is actually provincial and endemic and also was the original common name for bovine brucellosis. Its distribution is apparently limited by that of the vector, the argasid tick Ornithodoros coriaceus. The precise geographic range of the tick is not known. It is known to inhabit brushy foothills of California and adjacent areas of Nevada, Oregon, and northern Mexico, hence the other common name-foothills abortion. The most common hosts of the tick are cattle and deer. The tick is presumed to transmit an agent from the deer to cattle, as the infection remains endemic in ranges on which no cattle have been grazed. The cause of EBA is a novel deltaproteobacterium detected in salivary glands and other tissues, in a high percentage of adult O. coriaceus ticks in areas endemic for EBA. Cattle exposed to the ticks for the first time are primarily at risk. The infection produces no recognizable clinical signs in cattle of any age, but if the animals are pregnant, especially at 2-6 months, the infection is passed to their fetuses, wherein a chronic disease develops. The fetus at this stage of gestation has not fully developed a functional immune system. This, coupled with a cow that has not been previously exposed to the agent, allows the agent to cross the placenta to the fetus and initiate chronic infection. There is a 3-month or longer incubation period between the exposure of the dam to ticks, development of the entire spectrum of lesions, and death and abortion of the fetus. Because the lesions gain their specificity only during the latter part of this prolonged period, the disease can only be confidently diagnosed in those animals exposed before the last trimester.",

Eating infected carcasses or placentas from infected fetuses may infect canids. Most reports of abortion involve dairy cattle and particularly cows on drylot. This is believed to be associated with the density of population and methods of feed storage, providing increased opportunity for contamination, transmission, and spread of the organism. However, beef cows also abort. Conception does not seem to be affected; however, animals have been reported to abort with N. caninum in 3 sequential pregnancies. Abortion storms, where fresh or autolysed fetuses are aborted, may be followed by the birth of mummified fetuses for several months. Animals aborting in one year may or may not abort in the next gestation. Herd investigations have shown that 23% of pregnant cows and heifers abort during the first year of infection. Although protective immunity develops in infected cows, this immunity does not prevent transplacental infection, and seropositive cows are more likely to abort than are seronegative cows. Seronegative cows probably always produce seronegative calves. Most Neospora-induced abortions occur at 5-6 months of gestation; this mid-gestation abortion frequency is distinctive from other kinds of abortion in dairy cattle. Pregnancy-induced immunosuppression is a possible, but unproven, cause of reactivation of latent Neospora infections. The economic impact of N. caninum infection in dairy cattle extends beyond that from abortion to include premature culling resulting from the diminished milk production that occurs in seropositive cows. Cows infected with N. caninum are usually not clinically ill, nor do they have an increased risk of dying compared to seronegative cows.",

For further discussion, see the section on border disease virus infection in sheep and goats, later. These 3 viruses have been shown to cross infect naturally between species. The various strains of BVDV, although similar, differ in virulence and can be distinguished antigenically. Two biotypes exist, one that is cytopathic for cell cultures (cp-BVDV = CB, cytopathic biotype) and one that is not cytopathic (ncp-BVDV = NCB, noncytopathic biotype). Both cause disease in cattle. In addition, there is type 2 BVDV, which can infect fetuses and exists in cytopathic and noncytopathic forms as well. BVDV and Akabane virus are probably the most important viral pathogens of the bovine fetus. BVDV is distributed worldwide, and persistently infected (PI) cattle are reported to make up about 1% of the general population. They do not develop antibody to the homologous strain to which they are infected, but may respond to heterologous strains used in vaccines. Cattle persistently infected with ncp-BVDV or temporarily infected with cp-BVDV may excrete virus in feces, semen, urine, milk, nasal, ocular, and uterine secretions. Susceptible animals can acquire the virus by inhalation, ingestion or when bred with contaminated semen. Cows may also become infected from contaminated embryo transfer fluids where serum from carrier animals is used. Cytopathic BVDV is derived from mutations of ncp-BVDV. The ncp biotype may persistently infect the immunologically incapable fetus. There is no report of a cytopathic biotype being isolated from an infected animal without the noncytopathic biotype also being present; the cp form has no means of maintaining itself in the population of animals without the ncp form.",

BDV can be transmitted by oral, conjunctival, intranasal, and genital routes. As congenitally infected sheep can have lifelong viremia, they are probably the main reservoir for the virus. PI ewes can transmit the virus to their fetus through the placenta (over several pregnancies), and in rams, the virus has been observed in the seminiferous tubules of the testes and can be transmitted in the semen. BDV has been demonstrated in the germinal cells of the ovaries of sheep; the significance of this site in the transmission of the virus is not known. A wide variety of fetal tissues are affected by BDV infection, and the name hairy shaker was coined because of the frequently observed hairy appearance of the wool and the tremor associated with hypomyelinogenesis.

As in many other tissues occupied by BDV in PI animals, little cell death or associated inflammation was present. Further support for the hormonal theory of hypomyelinogenesis came on finding significantly lower concentrations of the thyroid hormone-dependent enzyme 2\u2032,3\u2032-cyclic nucleotide-3\u2032-phosphodiesterase (CNP) in oligodendrocytes from affected animals. CNP is normally found in oligodendrocytes, and its activity, which is dependent on the presence of both thyroxine and growth hormone, increases with myelination.

It is reported to cause enteritis and diarrhea in young calves and abortion and birth of weak calves when infections occur in na\u00efve pregnant cows. The organism is not considered a major cause of abortion, but this may be because it is not looked for consistently in submissions. Anywhere from 10-100% of the cattle in a population will have antibody to parvovirus, and work in the United States suggests that when reproductive problems, including repeat breeding, embryonic mortality, and abortion, are considered, animals with antibody to BPV had about 3 times as many of these problems as compared to control seronegative animals. BPV is excreted in the feces of affected and normal animals, and the oral route is important in transmission. Inoculation of parvovirus into pregnant cows can cause in utero fetal death and abortion in the early stages of gestation. Some calves may be born with cerebellar hypoplasia because of lysis associated with the multiplication of BPV in cells of the external granular layer. Cerebellar hypoplasia is believed to follow infection occurring in the period of rapid cell multiplication (107-150 days of gestation) in the cerebellum. Intranuclear inclusions are seen in external granular cells, hepatocytes, adrenal cortical cells, and intestinal crypt cells associated with areas of necrosis. Bovine fetuses are capable of forming IgM antibody to the virus by 93 days of gestation; infections in the third trimester usually only result in antibody formation with no abortion.",

Farrow-to-finish farms are affected nearly twice as often as feeder pig farms, probably because of the maintenance of a continual reservoir of PPV in the finishing pigs. The virus is most commonly spread by the ingestion of contaminated feces and will adhere to the zona pellucida of embryos. Viremia develops in susceptible pigs, and in pregnant pigs the virus enters the placenta and passes to the embryo or fetus 23-32 days following oral inoculation. Up to a fetal age of 70 days, the virus may cause death of the embryo (with absorption) or fetus (with mummification); however, the porcine fetus becomes increasingly resistant to the effects of the virus after 36 days and is immunocompetent by about 70 days. Death of the fetus may be due to the total effect of the virus on rapidly dividing cells, including neurons and capillary endothelium of the cortical laminae in cerebellum and cerebrum, and in cells in the lung, liver, pancreas, and chorioallantois. Movement of virus from one fetus to another may be affected by development of maternal antibody, increasing resistance of fetuses with advancing age, and the variability of the circulation and contact between the placental membranes of adjacent fetuses. When PPV is introduced by the uterine route, it causes inflammation in the ovaries and degeneration of uterine epithelium, both of which may contribute to reproductive failure but do not otherwise cause clinical signs. Uterine changes may include marked variation in surface epithelial cell height, epithelial cell basophilia, degeneration, and ulceration. Light infiltration of neutrophils, eosinophils, and lymphocytes may be present throughout the endometrium. Corpora lutea contain foci of mononuclear cells, many of which are lymphoplasmacytic. In the fetus, lesions are most commonly observed in older fetuses and may be present in kidney, liver, brain, and placenta. In the cerebrum, which is the most dependable site, perivenous accumulations of plasma cells and other mononuclear cells occur in white and gray matter and in meninges.

It is widespread throughout the world and causes respiratory, neurologic, and generalized neonatal disease, as well as abortion. The virus can be separated into 2 distinct subtypes (1 and 2) on the basis of restriction endonuclease cleavage of the viral DNA. Both subtypes cause respiratory disease, abortion, and neonatal disease. Subtype 1, however, causes a more severe (but less frequently encountered) respiratory disease than subtype 2 and is the more frequent isolate from aborted foals and neonatal disease. Also, it is probably the only type causing neurologic disease. Subtype 2 is commonly isolated from mild upper respiratory disease in horses and less so from abortion. Respiratory disease caused by EHV-1 is common in some areas, whereas abortion is rare; this may be explained to some extent by the presence of a subtype less likely to produce abortion but capable of producing respiratory disease. EHV-1 is very widespread, and first exposure usually occurs before the foal is 1 year of age. Mild to severe upper respiratory disease is produced, and secondary bacterial infection, frequently with Streptococcus zooepidemicus or other streptococci, is common. Because the virus is so widespread and contact so likely at an early age, abortion usually occurs in an animal that has had previous experience with the virus. As with herpesviruses generally, the level of immunity is low, and the virus is transported in leukocytes through the bloodstream to the placenta and hence the fetus. Death of the fetus does not occur until the onset of the usually prompt and uncomplicated abortion. The dam shows no premonitory signs, and the fetus is aborted in a fresh state. The time from exposure, whether by recrudescence of latent virus or reinfection, until abortion varies from 9 days to several months. Respiratory disease in the mare is usually not observed following the infection that results in abortion. It is reported that tissue cultures. Results are also available quickly. Fluorescent antibody techniques on frozen tissue sections of kidney, liver, or placenta and tissue cultures of these samples can be used for detection of virus. Viral DNA may also be detected by PCR. To identify antibodies to BoHV-1, the ELISA has a higher validity in differentiating a negative from a positive sample than the serum neutralization test. With BoHV-1, cows abort such a long time after initial infection that most animals have very low titers to the virus at that time. On an individual basis, therefore, antibody titers are of little value in diagnosis. Also, as the fetus dies quickly, there is usually no evidence of fetal antibody production. Gould S, et al ",

Aborted fetuses had abnormally developed heads, spines, and limbs. Laboratorians were able to identify a novel orthobunyavirus that had the molecular structure of the Shamonda viruses.

An RT-qPCR test was developed which was subsequently used to identify the agent, conduct epidemiologic studies, and to examine the pathogenesis of the disease. Transmission of SBV is associated with exposure to biting midges, mosquitoes, and sandflies. SBV can be transmitted via the semen of infected bulls. Schmallenberg virus infection of pregnant sheep also results in similar teratogenic lesions, and significant losses have been reported in Europe. Experimental inoculation of pregnant sheep causes subclinical infections in most animals. Infection was established in only about half the ewes inoculated.

RVFV infects many domestic, wild, and laboratory animals and humans. It occurs in at least 18 countries over a 6,700-km north-south range in Africa, plus Saudi Arabia. Infection by RVFV causes a disease characterized by rapid onset and high mortality in lambs, low mortality in adult sheep and calves, and even lower or no mortality in cattle. There is frequently a high rate of abortion, approaching 100% in sheep and cattle. People may also become infected, often from contact with body fluids or organs of infected animals, and develop influenza-like illness; mortality is generally low, but morbidity is high and the degree of debility often extreme. Hepatic necrosis is the prominent lesion and occurs in all affected species and age groups, including the fetus. Host resistance to fatal hepatic disease has been shown in laboratory animals to be inherited as a simple Mendelian dominant gene. Susceptibility is age and sex related; the young are more susceptible, and males less resistant than castrates and females. Although 2/3 of sheep are genetically resistant to fulminant hepatic disease, sheep are regarded as the most susceptible domestic animal. RVFV is transmitted primarily by mosquitoes, and Culex pipiens is a major vector in parts of Africa. Generalized infection in the mosquito is necessary before transmission occurs effectively, and movement of virus from the insect gut is facilitated by the presence of microfilariae in ingested blood. Aedes spp. are capable of transovarial transmission. Aedes albopictus, a strain of mosquito in the United States, can transmit the virus, and movement of animals either incubating infection or in viremia raises the possibility of international spread of the virus. Biting midges and ticks are also implicated in transmission. The virus probably does not spread from animal to animal in the absence of insects; however, experimentally the virus can be transmitted by just about every route, including aerosols or application into nasal passages, to scarified skin, or on the conjunctiva. Aborted fetuses and membranes have a very high titer of virus. Epizootics often follow a period of heavy rain, particularly after drought, and outbreaks may be separated by periods of 10-15 years without a case.",

Virus was recovered from fetuses before 69 days but not after 76, regardless of when they were infected, and this was coincident with the development of neutralizing antibody in the fetus. The virus was recovered from allantoic fluid in 11 of 17 fetuses euthanized at <76 days of gestation. 1991 and has since been found in the United States and in many European and Asian countries. The disease primarily affects pigs 5-18 weeks of age and is characterized by failure to grow and eventual emaciation. Affected pigs may have gastric ulcers in addition to a wide variety of lesions, including pneumonia and diarrhea.",

In the cow, the epithelium lining the external os and the adjacent few rugae is of the simple vaginal type, and this is more susceptible to irritation than the mucus-secreting surface cranial to it. Most inflammations then are superficial, but there are some exceptions, such as necrobacillosis. The circumstances in which cervicitis occurs have been mentioned in the section on pathology of the uterus or will be mentioned under pathology of the vagina and vulva, later. The usual form of bovine simple cervicitis is seen as a swelling of the caudal annular rugae, which are edematous and hyperemic. They soon protrude through the external os into the vagina, and thin mucopurulent exudate accumulates between the folds and collects in the vagina. Histologically, there is epithelial degeneration and desquamation, and inflammatory cells are predominantly mononuclear. Neutrophils penetrate the epithelium and become mixed with mucus, or in more acute cases, there may be frank suppuration. Cervicitis is not usually more severe than this, although in older cows the prolapse and swelling of the rings may be grossly obvious. Although degrees of prolapse result from inflammation, they may also predispose to it. Slight but progressive degrees of eversion of the cervical rings occur with succeeding pregnancies to expose portions of the cervical mucosa to the contaminated environment of the vagina. Chronic cervicitis may lead in time to enlargement of the cervix with some stenosis, but enlargement is not a criterion of inflammatory sclerosis.

Lactoferrin is an iron-binding protein present in secretions and in neutrophils that inhibits multiplication of bacteria with high iron requirements. The high concentration of citrate in normal milk prevents the action of lactoferrin, but it is effective in the secretion of the nonlactating gland. Lysozyme is locally synthesized in the gland, and although the concentration in milk is low, there is some correlation between milk titer and susceptibility to infection. The titer may be increased during inflammation. The most common pathogens in cows are E. coli and Staphylococcus aureus. E. coli mediates inflammation through endotoxin and PRR such as TLR-4. S aureus mediates inflammation by exotoxins and lipoproteins, peptidoglycans, and lipoteichoic acid. TLR-2 is important. Adaptive immune mechanisms occur but are not as important as the innate system. There are differences between species in the nature of immunoglobulins in colostrum and milk. In the cow, the immunoglobulins are predominantly of the IgG class and are selectively transferred from serum to milk. The levels are low in normal glands, but permeability changes in inflammation allow the titer to increase. The same class of antibody is identified with the concentration of plasma cells in the distal papillary part of the lactiferous sinus and papillary duct, and may affect organisms resident in the papillary duct.

With increasing severity, there is death of the epithelium, sloughing of cells into the lumen, and erosion. Granulation tissue will form, and periductal fibrosis develops. In experimental infection, the bacteria enter the tissues and induce a severe reaction with interstitial edema and emigration of neutrophils throughout all the tissues. Stromal lymphatics are widely dilated and contain numerous neutrophils. The acinar epithelium becomes vacuolated and dies. Granulation and fibrosis progress and eventually obliterate many of the acini. The inflammation and retention of milk and exudate causes involution in affected and unaffected acini nearby. The processes of fibrosis and involution continue until the end stages, when some lobules blue and eventually black and are softer, insensitive, and cold. There is pitting edema of the inguinal area, flank, and ventrum, and the necrotic skin begins to exude serum and to slough, and gas bubbles develop beneath it. The amount of tissue involved in the gangrenous process is quite variable, and groups of necrotic lobules adjoin others that are near normal. Separation of the gangrenous areas begins a week after onset, proceeds slowly, and the surface is suppurative and fistulae develop.",

This disease begins with septicemia, during which the organism can be cultured from all tissues and from blood. It is often fatal. If the infected animal survives, there are signs of localization in the eyes, periarticular tissues and the lactating mammary gland. Lactating females and kids are particularly susceptible. Pregnant females may abort or deliver live but infected fetuses. Lameness, keratoconjunctivitis, and changes in the milk occur. Mastitis primarily affects the interstitial tissue with secondary changes in the acini. Mild inflammation causes cessation of lactation, but the more severe reactions may lead to progressive fibrosis with parenchymal atrophy. Lameness is from arthritis and periarthritis, particularly of the carpal and tarsal joints. The synovial membranes may be normal, or they may be red or ulcerated with an increased volume of turbid fluid that may be blood stained.

The presenting signs are reduced milk yield, poor preweaning growth of lambs, and progressive atrophy of both mammae. The virus is present in mammae shortly after exposure. The severity of the lesions increases with the duration of infection. The virus replicates in circulating monocytes and more freely in tissue macrophages.

These are prominent in the interstitial and periductal connective tissue, and lymphoid nodules form. Fibrosis is not a feature.

It does appear that older cats diagnosed with mammary carcinoma have a shorter survival time, but why is not known. Carcinomas usually occur in older cats, however. Mammary carcinomas >3-cm diameter have the worst relatively low. The schemes are based on degree of tubule formation (in mixed tumors, this is best done in the epithelialpredominant part), nuclear pleomorphism, and particularly, mitotic index (in the region with the highest number of mitoses) (Table 4-3) . Those with a grade of III have a worse prognosis.",
