The structures of the synthesized compounds were confirmed by NMR and FAB-MS spectral and elemental analyses. Subsequently, the compounds were examined for their cytotoxic effects on two different human breast tumor cell lines: MCF7 and MDA-MB468. Although all compounds examined were quite effective on both cell lines, the compound N 0 -(7-chloro-quinolin-4-yl)-N,N-dimethyl-ethane-1,2-diamine emerged as the most active compound of the series. It was particularly potent against MDA-MB 468 cells when compared to chloroquine and amodiaquine. The compound butyl-(7-fluoro-quinolin-4-yl)-amine showed more potent effects on MCF-7 cells when compared to chloroquine. Therefore, 4-aminoquinoline can serve as the prototype molecule for further development of a new class of anticancer agents.",

According to the World Health Organization (WHO), more than 11 million people are diagnosed with cancer worldwide every year and this number is expected to increase to 16 million by the year 2020. More than 8 million, or 13% of overall deaths, are directly caused by cancer worldwide every year. The relative rate of cancer-caused mortality is even higher in the developed countries, as it accounts for more than 20% of all deaths [1] . Although cancer therapies have improved significantly in recent years, the development of chemoresistance has severely limited the choice of available anticancer drugs. This clearly highlights the urgent need for novel chemotherapeutic agents for more effective treatment of cancer [2e5] .",

The class of compounds containing a 4-aminoquinoline moiety ( Fig. 1 ) was the first to be used for the successful treatment of malaria, and is still the drug of choice [6e8] . Chloroquine (CQ) is a well-known anti-malarial drug possessing a 4-aminoquinoline scaffold, and it has been shown to have antiviral effects on the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) causative agents [9e11] . CQ is currently in clinical trials as an investigational antiretroviral agent in humans with HIV-1/AIDS, who often develop tumors, particularly when survival has been prolonged by antiretroviral treatments [12, 13] . Recently, CQ has also been added to a conventional therapy protocol (i.e., surgery \u00fe radiotherapy \u00fe chemotherapy) for HIV-1 seronegative glioblastoma patients [14] . We have recently demonstrated that CQ significantly increases the cytotoxic effects on MDA-MB 231 cells when combined with radiation [15] . The present work is an extension of our ongoing efforts towards developing new, effective anti-cancer agents. To this end, we synthesized several 4-aminoquinoline derivatives and examined their cytotoxic effects on MDA-MB 468 and MCF-7 breast cancer cell lines. We found that some of these compounds are very effective.",

            "text": "Compounds described in this report were prepared as outlined in Scheme 1. The synthesis of desired 4-aminoquinoline compounds (2e11) were prepared by aromatic nucleophilic substitution on 7-substituted-4-chloro-quinoline (1) using excess of monoaminoalkane/diaminoalkane in neat conditions with a simple standard work-up procedure as described previously [16] . The alkyl aminoquinoline derivatives (2,3) were prepared by refluxing 7-substituted-4-chloro-quinoline with butyl amine in neat conditions. The aminoquinoline compound (4) was synthesized by refluxing 4,7-dichloroquinoline with an excess of ethane-1,2-diamine in which the temperature was raised slowly and maintained at 80 C over 1 h while stirring. The temperature was raised further to 130 C and maintained at that temperature for 7 h with continuous stirring. The dimethyl alkyl aminoquinoline derivatives (5e9) were also synthesized by a single-step reaction, in which appropriate 7-substituted-4-chloro-quinoline reacts with N,N-dimethylalkyl-diamine in neat conditions. The bisquinoline compounds (10, 11) were obtained by excess of 7-substituted-4-chloroquinoline reacting with one mole of alkyl diamine during which the temperature was kept at 130 C for 6 h. The mass spectra of all the synthesized compounds were in conformity with their assigned structures. The mass spectra of these compounds showed molecular ion peaks corresponding to their molecular formulas (Table 1) . Elemental (C, H, N) analysis satisfactorily confirmed elemental compositions and the purity of the synthesized compounds (Table 1) NMR spectra of these compounds (Table 2) have been found to be in agreement with their assigned structures. All the compounds synthesized were evaluated for their cytotoxicity against two cancer cell lines derived from human breast tumors. The drugs at the concentration of 100 mM were diluted to 1.625 mM by two-fold serial dilutions. Following the incubation for 48 h in a drug, the cells were treated with SRB to measure their growth/viability (% of the untreated control) using a spectrophotometer as described previously [17] . The reading of SRB staining is known to accurately reflect the levels of total cellular macromolecules [17] . The GI 50 concentration for each derivative was calculated with reference to a standard curve (control cells), which represents the concentration that results in a 50% decrease in cell growth after 3 days of incubation. For each compound, the 50% growth inhibition (GI 50 ) was determined and reported in Table 3 . The data for CQ, amodiaquine and mefloquine were included for comparison. The data showed that these derivatives have significant cytotoxicity against the cell lines screened. Among the nine compounds tested, two compounds showed a GI 50 range of 7.35e8.73 mM against MDA-MB468 cells, and one compound showed a GI 50 at 8.22 mM against MCF-7 cells. The remaining seven compounds showed GI 50 values above the 10.85 mM, but not more than 13.72 mM against MDA-MB468 cells. In the case of MCF-7 cells, the six compounds tested showed GI 50 in the range of 11.52e14.47 mM, the remaining two compounds showed GI 50 values above 36.77 mM, but not more than 51.57 mM. The differences in the GI 50 values may be attributable to factors such as the nature of substitution at the seventh positions, the side-chains, and the genetic and biochemical background of the cell lines.",

            "text": "As for compound 2, the replacement of the chloro group with a fluoro group (3) led to an increase in cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-468 cells. It also showed a similar result with MCF-7 cells. In case of the aminoquinoline compound 4 (GI 50 \u00bc 11.01 mM), cytotoxicity increased by 2-fold in comparison to CQ (GI 50 \u00bc 24.36 mM) against MDA-MB-468 cells. With MCF-7 cell lines, however, the compound 4 showed lower cytotoxicity (GI 50 \u00bc 51.57 mM) than CQ (GI 50 \u00bc 20.72 mM). The dimethyl alkyl aminoquinoline derivatives with the 7-chloro substitution of compound 5 showed drastically increased (5-fold) cytotoxicity (GI 50 \u00bc 8.73 mM) against MDA-MB-468 cells in comparison to CQ. However, replacement of the chloro group with a fluoro (6, GI 50 \u00bc 11.47 mM), trifluoromethyl (7, GI 50 \u00bc 12.85 mM) and a methoxy group (8, GI 50 \u00bc 14.09 mM) led to a decrease in cytotoxicity against MDA-MB-468 cells. Interestingly, in the MCF-7 cell lines, these results were in reverse order, and the compound substituted with a chloro group (5, GI 50 \u00bc 36.77 mM) was less active in comparison to that of substituted with a methoxy group (8, GI 50 \u00bc 12.90 mM). The bisquinoline compound 10 (GI 50 \u00bc 7.35 mM) showed 3-fold increased activity in MDA-MB-468 cells, compared to CQ. It is interesting to note that the same compound showed lower activity (GI 50 \u00bc 14.80 M) in the MCF-7 cell line. Compound 11 is insoluble in DMSO; therefore, we were not able to examine cytotoxicity on cultured cells. Further structural modifications are in progress to increase specificity and cytotoxicity on cancer cells by 4-aminoquinoline derivatives.",
