            "text": "Aerial spraying of products to kill larvae or adult mosquitoes is a public health measure used to control vectorborne diseases. In some outbreaks, the intervention has evoked controversy and community resistance. This study evaluated how local opinion leaders in US localities affected by Zika think about community engagement in public health policies for outbreak response. In December 2017 through March 2018, 4 focus groups were convened in Houston, TX, New Orleans, LA, Miami, FL, and Brooklyn, NY. They discussed a hypothetical scenario that featured vector control by aerial spraying. Participants (N = 20) more readily accepted this vector control method under 4 conditions: They were informed of alternatives, benefits, and risks for human health and the environment. Public health claims were backed by objective evidence and an authority figure genuinely working in the community's interests. They received timely notice about how to mitigate toxin exposure. And, aerial spraying helped to protect vulnerable individuals. The community engagement requirements of the local opinion leaders resonate with core principles of recent public health ethics frameworks: namely, personal autonomy, transparency, reasonableness, and solidarity. Participants foresaw problems with community consent in an era of growing social media use and mistrust in governmental and scientific authority. They also debated whether health authorities should use moral-based arguments, in addition to science-based ones, to communicate aerial spraying's risks and benefits.",

Features of the Zika virus disease and its control complicated the outbreak response; these included multiple modes of viral transmission (mosquito bite, sexual contact, mother-to-fetus); absence of an effective vaccine; prevention via individual behavior modifications and environmental interventions; and uncertain health impacts for affected infants (Oussayef et al., 2017) . As a result, public health professionals faced many ethics concerns: Was comprehensive reproductive healthcare available for women (Lancet Global Health, 2016; PAHO, 2016; Saenz, 2016) ? What outbreak controls were appropriate when most contagious individuals were asymptomatic (Jamrozik et al., 2018) ? Which prevention and treatment studies were morally defensible (Marston et al., 2016; Shah et al., 2017) ?",

The Pan American Health Organization and Nuffield Council on Bioethics, for instance, advised providing clear, timely, and culturally-aware public information about the health effects including congenital Zika syndrome, local incidence and prevalence, personal protective actions (e.g., repellent use), and public health interventions (e.g., surveillance) (Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 2016; PAHO, 2016) .

Interventions seen as out-of-sync with local values could foster community resistance. Releasing genetically modified mosquitoes, for instance, could trigger public worry about unnatural interventions that alter the environment in harmful ways. Accessing private property to identify mosquito habitats, too, could upset residents who cherish their independence, chafe at government interference, and value their property rights. By explaining control alternatives, eliciting community input on acceptable interventions, and sharing the rationale for specific choices, public health professionals have a greater chance of earning the public's confidence and cooperation (Jamrozik et al., 2018; Nuffield Council on Bioethics, 2016; Tambo et al., 2017) . Moreover, involving local residents in a coordinated campaign to reduce mosquito habitats at the community level -such as enlisting whole neighborhoods to empty/cover containers with standing water -can raise the likelihood of successful vector control (Jamrozik et al., 2018; WHO, 2017) . Control of other mosquito-borne diseases (e.g., Dengue, Chikungunya), has increasingly enlisted community members in decentralized campaigns (Alvarado-Castro et al., 2017; Andersson et al., 2015; Elsinga et al., 2017; Lucena et al., 2018) .",

Accordingly, the field's ethics typically acknowledge health's social nature: an individual's well-being depends on people around them. Principles deriving from this communal aspect are equity, justice, and solidarity (Kenny et al., 2010; Lee, 2012; Marckmann et al., 2015; Swain et al., 2018) . They oblige professionals to ensure that no one group disproportionately shares in benefits or risks, improve life and health conditions for society's worst-off members and generate public goods benefiting the entire community (e.g., safe food) (Marckmann et al, 2015; Spike, 2018) . Local opinion leaders were similarly attuned to health's interconnectedness. They argued that health officials should use grassroots ombudsmen to translate complex science into meaningful terms, giving diverse laypeople an equal chance to comprehend aerial spraying's risks and benefits. Noting a moral obligation to others, they expressed a willingness to suppress personal anxieties about spraying so that others could benefit from fewer Zika-carrying mosquitos, including people who had no money to buy repellent or spent a lot of time out-of-doors (e.g., the homeless, landscape workers).",

Larger sample size and further input from men could have yielded additional themes or more nuance to current findings. Nonetheless, given their social positions, the grassroots leaders queried had the capacity for a broad perspective on local sensibilities about aerial spraying. Despite its limits, the study establishes an important foundation for future inquiries. The thematic analysis may serve as the first phase of an explanatory sequential mixed methods design that would build to quantitative data collection and analysis (Creswell, 2014) . For instance, quantitative explorations of the same topics could better ascertain the frequency of attitudes, opinions, and perceptions and allow researchers to generalize more broadly (Liamputtong, 2011; Sullivan and Sargeant, 2011) . Future comparative research is also possible. For instance, one could examine how community members approach these same matters during a \"steady state\" (no active threat) versus a \"crisis state\" (Zika and pesticide risks are both present); varying risk perceptions could influence how people absorb, approve, and act on individual and collective protective measures. In addition, Aedes species mosquitoes (Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus the primary Zika vectors prefer to bite people and live both indoors and outdoors in close proximity to people (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019a). For vector control, health authorities might also consider targeted residual spraying in areas where screens and air conditioning are uncommon (US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, 2019b). Thus, one could investigate community views and values regarding this more intimate and immediate form of spraying.",
