            "text": "An ongoing epidemic of respiratory diseases caused by a novel coronavirus started in Wuhan in China at the end of December 2019 [1, 2, 3] . To date, more than 89,000 cases and more than 3,000 deaths have been reported across China due to SARS-Cov2, mostly in the region of Hubei (WHO). To date, two hundred cases have been exported from China to 65 Countries [4] . COVID-19 has been notably extended to three countries outside China; Iran, Italy and South Korea. The concept of quarantine goes back to the plague outbreak in 1377, and was initially empirically set at 30 days for ships and 40 days for land travellers [5] . Quarantine times have recently been adjusted to reflect the known incubation period of the disease. Based upon preliminary reports on COVID-19 [6] , the quarantine time was established at 14 days. At the end of January 2020, the French government decided to repatriate French nationals living in Wuhan and place them in quarantine in their home country. In the context of European collaboration, all European nationals living in Wuhan who wanted to be repatriated to their home countries were invited to join the French group. The availability of the country's largest military airport, an empty holiday centre, and proximity to the largest referral centre for preparedness and care of highly infectious diseases in France (the Institut Hospitalo-Universitaire M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection, IHUMI) made the area of Marseille appropriate for this quarantine procedure ( Figure 1 ). In such epidemics the most important thing is to manage anxiety, as this in itself can have a significant effect. With this aim, we investigated the presence of SARS-CoV-19 asymptomatic carriers by testing all repatriated individuals for this virus within the first 24 hours of their arrival in France and at day 5. Considering the duration of repatriation travel and the quarantine that began in China 2 to 7 days prior travelling back for all the individuals, this strategy seemed to be adapted to detect potential carriers.",

A team consisting of between two and seven infectious disease specialists was sent to the two quarantine bases to test asymptomatic persons. When an individual became symptomatic, they were transferred from the base to our Institute and cared for in the BSL3 ward while awaiting the results of the SARS-CoV-19 diagnosis. Once SARS-CoV-19 had been ruled out, the person was returned to the quarantine base. Individuals who presented respiratory symptoms during the flight were sampled at the airport, and were then referred to their quarantine base if testing for SARS-CoV-19 was negative.",

Timeto-results was therefore four hours and fifty minutes (290 minutes) and six hours and forty (400 minutes), respectively. For the second flight, samples were received in two different series, which made them easier to manage. In addition, we optimised the testing strategy by prioritising the extraction of RNA from the samples, rather than performing a complete registration of all samples in our laboratory computer system then preparing all aliquots from the samples including for preparation of the biobank. Thus, a first series of 20 samples was received at 6.20pm and the results were communicated at 9.10pm, two hours and fifty minutes later (170 minutes), while a second series of 75 samples was received at 8.25pm and the results were available \u00e0 11.30pm, two hours and fifty-five minutes later (175 minutes).

Acknowledgement : The authors thanks the regional Prefect and Philippe De Mester, general director of the regional health agency and their teams, the Red Cross, Dr Jouve and her team at the firefighters' training school for logistical support and easy access to the field, the nurses, laboratory technicians and engineers from the Institute for the days and nights they spent improving the rapid diagnosis procedure and caring for suspected patients, the ethics committee which dedicated a specific meeting to reducing the time required for the ethical review of the protocol, and the French General Directorate for Heath, which agreed to an exemption around the date of the start of the study, before the official agreement from the ethics board had been granted. This work has benefited from the French State support, managed by the 'Agence Nationale pour la Recherche' including the \"Programme d'Investissement d'avenir\" under the reference M\u00e9diterran\u00e9e Infection 10-IAHU-03. Funding are no any involvement in the study design; collection, analysis and interpretation of data; the writing of the manuscript. ",
