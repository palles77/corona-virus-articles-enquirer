This study explored the application of a combined visible and thermal image processing approach that uses a CMOS camera equipped with IRT to remotely sense multiple vital signs and screen patients with suspected infectious diseases. Methods: An IRT system that produced visible and thermal images was used for image acquisition. The subjects' respiration rates were measured by monitoring temperature changes around the nasal areas on thermal images; facial skin temperatures were measured simultaneously. Facial blood circulation causes tiny color changes in visible facial images that enable the determination of the heart rate. A logistic regression discriminant function predicted the likelihood of infection within 10 s, based on the measured vital signs. Sixteen patients with an influenza-like illness and 22 control subjects participated in a clinical test at a clinic in Fukushima, Japan. Results: The vital-sign-based IRT screening system had a sensitivity of 87.5% and a negative predictive value of 91.7%; these values are higher than those of conventional fever-based screening approaches. Conclusions: Multiple vital-sign-based screening efficiently detected patients with suspected infectious diseases. It offers a promising alternative to conventional fever-based screening.",

IRT remains the gold standard for border control, because it can rapidly mass-screen infected individuals without contact. [1] [2] [3] [4] However, IRT measurements are influenced by several factors, including the environmental temperature and humidity, alcohol consumption, and the consumption of antipyretic medications. 5 Body temperature, in particular, can be modified rapidly by the consumption of antipyretic drugs, which directly affects the sensitivity of IRT.",

            "text": "The concept underlying vital-sign-based screening is based on the association between infections and inflammation. Inflammation causes elevations in body temperature and in heart and respiration rates; therefore, integrating vital sign monitoring increases screening accuracy. This concept was used in previous studies by the present author group to develop a novel infection screening radar system to mass-screen individuals. This system utilizes a multisensor fusion technique to remotely measure heart and respiration rates using a microwave radar, and the facial skin temperature is measured using IRT. The results from case-control studies that investigated seasonal influenza screening showed a detection accuracy that ranged from 81.5% to 98.0% using the heart and respiration rates and the facial skin temperature, which is higher than the detection accuracies of the conventional feverbased screening methods. [6] [7] [8] [9] However, the radar system used to screen for infections incorporates expensive embedded multisensor modules, namely a microwave radar, a reflective photoplethysmography sensor, and IRT, and it requires large-scale systems. Consequently, the system is not used widely. Hence, to promote the widespread use of vitalsign-based screening, focus has been placed on systems with minimum hardware requirements to achieve a system that is more suitable for real-world settings. The most reliable solution is to enhance the functionality of the conventional IRT systems that are already installed at international airports. By incorporating the latest advances in image processing techniques, these IRT systems can acquire thermal and visible images together by integrating visible and thermal cameras.",

To measure the respiration rate from the thermal images, the temperature changes that occur around the nasal area during the inspiration of cold air from the environment and the expiration of warm air from the lungs was monitored, and the respiratory waveform was extracted from the differences in each of the thermal images. This enabled the respiration rate to be determined from the breath-to-breath intervals. The facial skin temperature was measured simultaneously using the thermal images. The image acquisition and processing programs were written in LabVIEW software (National Instruments, Texas, USA). Subjects were seated in front of the IRT system at a distance of approximately 0.5 m.

Of the patients with influenza, 14 (red dots) are enclosed within the red ellipse and they had positive Z-values, and two patients had negative Z-values ( Figure 2 ).

Therefore, the sensitivity, specificity, NPV, and PPV were 87.5%, 100%, 91.7%, and 100%, respectively. The fever-based screening, for which the cut-off value for the axillary temperature was set at 37.0 C, did not detect five influenza patients (false-negative). The sensitivity of the fever-based screening was 68.7%. Table 1 presents a more detailed comparison of the patients with influenza and the healthy control subjects. The influenza patients who had higher Z(x 1 ,x 2 ,x 3 ) values had more severe symptoms, namely higher body temperatures and more elevated heart and respiration rates. The classification model determined that some patients had influenza, even if they did not have a fever. The Z(x 1 ,x 2 ,x 3 ) values could be used to evaluate the severity of infections, and they could, therefore, support the clinical risk stratification of patients. The two influenza patients who were misclassified had negative Z-values because their vital signs were normal.",

The high level of accuracy of the automated IRT system has a number of clinical implications that could enable the system to be used to provide primary screening of people who may be carrying infections within emergency outpatient units or quarantine stations.

NS, not significant. professionals and medical facilities were severely affected by the disaster. 15, 16 In such settings, an automated IRT system could distinguish between individuals who are and are not carrying infections, thereby alleviating the workload of healthcare professionals. Therefore, the proposed integrated visible and thermal image processing approach may be a promising pre-examination technique in disaster settings. Limitations of the present study mostly pertain to data samples (16 patients and 22 healthy control subjects), which can be considered sufficient for evaluation by the CMOS camera-equipped IRT system for vital-sign measurement. However, the data samples are small for training in a logistic regression classification model. To refine the performance of the logistic regression classification model implemented in the IRT system, field testing with larger and completely random subject populations will be conducted in realworld settings. Moreover, to guarantee the accuracy of heart and respiration rate measurement by the IRT system, the authors are now working on the development of an automatic real-time human face tracking algorithm using visible and thermal images. Detecting and tracking human faces can significantly reduce motion artifacts, thereby extracting stable heartbeat and respiration signals. The face tracking algorithm can also be expanded to multi-person tracking, i.e., more than two human faces can be monitored simultaneously to avoid a 'human traffic jam' in places of mass gathering such as airports.",
