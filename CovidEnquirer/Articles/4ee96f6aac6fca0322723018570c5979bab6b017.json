Anti-TCoV hyperimmune turkey serum and normal turkey serum were used as positive or negative controls for optimization of the ELISA. Goat anti-turkey IgG (H+L) conjugated with horseradish peroxidase was used as detector antibody. Three hundred and twenty two turkey sera from the field were used to evaluate the performance of ELISA and determine the cut-off point of ELISA. The established ELISA was also examined with serum samples obtained from turkeys experimentally infected with TCoV. Those serum samples were collected at various time intervals from 1 to 63 days post-infection. The optimum conditions for differentiation between anti-TCoV hyperimmune serum and normal turkey serum were recombinant TCoV N protein concentration at 20 g/ml, serum dilution at 1:800, and conjugate dilution at 1:10,000. Of the 322 sera from the field, 101 were positive for TCoV by immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA). The sensitivity and specificity of the ELISA relative to IFA test were 86.0% and 96.8%, respectively, using the optimum cut-off point of 0.2 as determined by logistic regression method. Reactivity of anti-rotavirus, anti-reovirus, anti-adenovirus, or anti-enterovirus antibodies with the recombinant N protein coated on the ELISA plates was not detected. These results indicated that the established antibody-capture ELISA in conjunction with recombinant TCoV N protein as the coating protein can be utilized for detection of antibodies to TCoV in turkey flocks.",

Immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA) has been developed and successfully used in the serological diagnosis of turkey coronaviral enteritis (Patel and Pomeroy, 1976) . The IFA assay is simple to perform and highly effective in detecting antibodies to TCoV in turkey flocks infected with TCoV or recovering from TCoV infection. However, the IFA procedures are time consuming and labor intensive for handling large numbers of samples. In addition, IFA requires well-trained personnel to prepare frozen sections of TCoV-infected turkey embryo intestines or slides with epithelial cells exfoliated from the infected bursa of Fabricuis as well as to perform fluorescent microscopy.",

Attempts to propagate TCoV in cell culture in many laboratories have not been successful. When the viral antigen prepared from the intestines and intestinal contents http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.jviromet.2015.02.024 0166-0934/\u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V. All rights reserved. was used as the coating antigen, a strong non-specific reaction was observed in the ELISA (Loa et al., unpublished data). Nucleocapsid (N) protein of TCoV appears to be the most abundant viral polypeptide in coronavirus infected cells during all stages of infection. The only known post-translational modification of coronavirus N proteins is phosphorylation (Garwes et al., 1984) . The coronavirus N protein is immunodominant (Ignjatovic and McWaters, 1991) . Carboxyl-terminal 119 amino acids of nucleocapsid protein of IBV expressed by Fowlpox Virus has been shown to induce cross-protective immunity against infections among different IBV strains (Yu et al., 2001) . The N proteins from various RNA viruses, such as mumps, rabies, measles, and IBV have been used as coating antigens in antibody-capture ELISA for the diagnosis of infections (Reid-sanden et al., 1990; Hummel et al., 1992; Ndifuna et al., 1998) . Subcloning of the N gene to a prokaryotic expression system has resulted in a high-level induction of recombinant protein in our laboratory (Loa et al., 2004) . The recombinant TCoV N protein expressed from the prokaryotic system is expected to maintain its antigenic integrity because it is not glycosylated. The purpose of the present study was to develop a recombinant TCoV N protein-based ELISA for detection of antibodies to TCoV in turkey sera.",

In addition, there is cross-antigenicity between turkey and chicken immunoglobulins (Stephensen et al., 1999) . Therefore, both antibody to TCoV in turkey serum and antibody to IBV in chicken serum were detectable by the established ELISA as shown in the present study. The presence of antibody to IBV in turkey serum is not likely because infection of IBV to turkeys has never been established or reported. In the absence of IBV infection, antibody to IBV is not expected to be induced in turkey serum. If there were IBV infection in turkeys, it could be diagnosed by the established ELISA method.",
