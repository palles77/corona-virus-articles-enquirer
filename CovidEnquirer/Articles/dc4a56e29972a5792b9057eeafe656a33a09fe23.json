Generalized ileus is a common continuation of this condition, and may arise from mechanical obstruction or from defective propulsion. Mechanical obstruction (eg, dehydrated impacted ingesta secondary to chronic dehydration, foreign bodies, and infiltrative lesions) cause delayed gastric empting. Abnormalities in myenteric neuronal or gastric smooth muscle function or contractility result in defective propulsion. Primary factors associated with these functional disorders include anorexia, high-carbohydrate/low-fiber diet, postsurgical adhesions, lack of exercise, toxin ingestion (lead). Secondary factors include pain and environmental stressors such as proximity of predators or a dominant rabbit, change in group hierarchy, loss of a companion, change in housing, routine, or diet, transport, extremes of temperatures, or humidity [27] . Anorexia and chronic dehydration are both causal factors and consequences of gastric stasis and ileus. Systemic dehydration leads to gut content dehydration and impaction of normal stomach contents, which includes loose hair lattices or trichobezoars. One study found the prevalence of trichobezoars, weighing 1 to 24 g, to be 23.1% (n = 208) [16] .",

Analgesia, the author's preference, is for buprenorphine or pethidine (Pethidine; 5-10 mg/kg intramuscularly or subcutaneously), shock doses of intravenous or intraosseous crystalloid solution, and systemic broad-spectrum antibiotics should be administered. Prokinetics are contraindicated with an obstructive condition before surgery, but are useful postoperatively to stimulate gastrointestinal motility. Gastric decompression via nasogastric or orogastric tube should always be attempted. Where possible serum electrolyte concentrations and acid-base status should be evaluated, acidosis and ketosis may be present. Systolic arterial blood pressure should be measured, where hypovolaemic is suspected. Doppler measurement requires a 1-or 2-sized cuff (Critikon neonatal SOFT-CUF, GE Medical Systems, Information Technologies Gmbh, Freiburg, Germany) to be placed just proximal to the right elbow, ensuring cuff width was 50% of the circumference of this region. Conduction gel and the transducer are applied to the palmar distal, antebrachial surface, over the palmar common digital artery. Inflation of the cuff occludes the artery, then gradual deflation until the transducer detects the reentry of blood to the artery. The pressure measurement on the manometer correlates to systolic pressure. A mean of six readings should be used the reference range of 100-110 mm Hg, has been described in rabbits [41] . Following the same principles as used in cats and dogs, fluid therapy has been used to correct hypovolaemia in rabbits. Postsurgical adhesions have been minimized by the use of the calcium channel-blocking agent, verapamil (Verapamil, Securon) (200 lg/kg subcutaneously every 8 hours for 9 days) [42] . Analgesia, fluids, and nutritional support should be continued postoperatively. Prognosis is guarded to poor, as most rabbits have severe hepatic lipidosis, acidosis, ketosis, and severe gastric ulceration. Severe gastric ulceration could progress to perforation with subsequent peritonitis. Perforation carries a grave prognosis. Aggressive and early treatment will improve rate of recovery.",

Mechanisms for antibiotic associated enteritis include: (1) alteration in intestinal motility and enterocyte ion transport was shown in lincomycin, clindamycin, erythromycin, and gentamicin [49, 50] ; and (2) altered microbial flora and overgrowth of C difficile and its cytotoxin following to oral ampicillin administration, and C sporogenes and its enterotoxin, following intravenous cephalosporin administration [51, 52] .",

Lactobacilli and enterococcus have been studied in rabbits. Lactobacilli, in contrast with other mammals, are very rarely found in the rabbit GIT microflora. Although some strains of lactobacilli, (L fermentum) were shown to have relatively resistant to pH 2 of rabbit gastric juice, lack of adhesive capability may prevent them colonizing the rabbit GIT [59] . Enterococcus faecalis and Enterococcu faecuim, the predominant enterococcal species in the rabbit GIT, were found in the feces of 8 of 10 healthy rabbits and in intestinal content of only 1 of 10. The enterococci were found to be resistant to a pH 3 broth, and transient inoculated enterococcal populations were demonstrated, suggesting colonization may occur, although further investigation is required [47] . Transfaunation of fresh caecotrophs from healthy rabbits can provide the appropriate microflora to help reestablish cecal homeostasis.",
