In the past decades, such Biginelli type dihydropyrimidones have received a considerable amount of attention due to the interesting pharmacological properties associated with this heterocyclic scaffold. In this review, we highlight recent developments in this area, with a focus on the DHPMs, recently developed as anti-inflammatory, anti-HIV, anti-tubercular, antifungal anticancer, antibacterial, antifilarial, antihyperglycemic, antihypertensive, analgesic, anticonvulsant, antioxidant, anti-TRPA1, anti-SARS, and anti-cancer activity and a 1a binding affinity.",

            "text": "Heterocyclic chemistry is an important branch of organic chemistry accounting for nearly one-third of modern publications [1] . Heterocyclic compounds have vital role in our biological system. They are an integral part of many pharmacologically active molecules, natural products and nucleic acids. The base pair of DNA& RNA (guanine, cytosine, adenine and thymine) are also made up of heterocyclic compounds like purine, pyrimidine etc. Heterocyclic compound are also present in large variety of drug candidate like antitumor, antibiotic, anti-inflammatory, antidepressant, antimalarial, anti-HIV, antimicrobial, antibacterial, antifungal, antiviral, antidiabetic, herbicidal, fungicidal and insecticidal agents [2] . Some naturally occurring molecules are discovered and having a good biological activity against the many diseases e.g. quinine is used as an antimalarial drug, vinblastine and vincristine are also used as anticancer agent. In this review, our focus will be on the 3,4dihydropyrimidine (DHPM) ring. Basically it is a selective review on dihydropyrimidinones. Literature of last two decades is incorporated in this review. The pyrimidine is the most important heterocyclic moiety. Pyrimidine derivatives have various therapeutic applications in medicinal chemistry. One anticipated reason for their activity is presence of a pyrimidine base in thymine, cytosine and uracil, which are essential building blocks of nucleic acids, DNA & RNA [3] . Number of chemical compounds consisting of pyrimidine as core nucleus were synthesized and evaluated for antihypertensive [4] , anticancer [5] , antimicrobial [6] , antihyperglycemic [7] , antiarrhythmic, anti-inflammatory [8] , analgesic [9] , antibacterial [10] , anti-HIV [11] and antitubercular activity [12] . Due to the wide range of therapeutic properties scientist have attracted towards developing new dihydropyrimidine molecules. Recently in 2013, Dragovich et al. synthesized substituted 2-thio-6-oxo-1,6dihydropyrimidines inhibitors of human lactate dehydrogenase [5] . The DHPMs are synthesized with the help of Multi-component reactions (MCR) . MCR are special types of theoretically useful organic reactions in which three or more starting materials react to give a desired product [13] . Combine synthesis pathways generally show advantages over continuous or atypical approaches with respect to time, speed, yield and reproducibility. Among organic reactions, MCR with more than two starting materials are allowed to form a complex product. Therefore, they constitute a superior tool for diversity oriented and complexity-generating synthesis for drug discovery [14] . Commonly used multi component reaction for heterocyclic synthesis are Biginelli reaction and Hantzsch dihydropyridine synthesis [15] etc. Few pharmacologically active dihydropyrimidinones are shown in Fig. 1 .",

Interaction of aminophylline and topiramate has been studied carefully which revealed that aminophylline containing the dihyroprymidinone nucleus markedly attenuated the anticonvulsant potential of topiramate in the mouse maximal-electroshockinduced seizure model [22] . Seizure prolonging action of aminophylline has also been observed which is mainly attributed by blocking adenosine receptors [23] . However, seizure prolonging action was of aminophylline was antagonized by RO 15-1788 , which is partial benzodiazepine agonist [23, 24] . Interaction of 5flourouracil with misonidazole has revealed that the clearance of the former was significantly reduced.

Numerous synthetic strategies have been outlined for the synthesis of DHPMs illustrated in Scheme 1. In 1893, Pietro Bignelli's had reported the synthesis of dihydropyrimidine (monastrol) 4 by condensation of ethyl acetoacetate 3, 3hydroxybenzaldehyde 1 and thiourea 2 under slightly acidic condition using concentrated hydrochloric acid as catalyst in appropriate solvent such as ethanol [26] . Matthews et al. treated b-keto ester 5 with aldehyde 1 and urea 2 for the synthesis of DHPMs 6 [27] . In 2004, Holla et al. published one pot synthesis of thiazolodihydropyrimidinones 8 by condensing benzaldehyde1 with 2,4dichloro-5-fluoroacetophenones 7 and thiourea 2 in the presence of sodium hydroxide and ethanolic potassium hydroxide under the Claisen-Schmidt reaction conditions [28] . Yadlapalli et al. were synthesized DHPMs with the help of 1-(piperidin-1-yl)butane-1,3dione 9, benzaldehyde 1, an excess of thiourea 2 in ethanol under mild acidic condition provided the expected DHPMs in good to excellent yield [29] . In 2010, Shaabni et al. described the synthesis of a new class of 3,4-dihydropyrimidine-2(1H) one derivatives in a one-pot process by a four-component condensation reaction of an aliphatic or aromatic amine 11, diketene 12, an aromatic aldehyde 1 and urea/thiourea 2 in the presence of p-toluenesulfonic acid (p-TsOH.H 2 O) as a catalyst in dichloromethane at ambient temperature. Since the number of possible combinations in four-component reactions is greater than the three-component reactions, the diversity of Biginelli reaction is more explored under four-component reaction strategy [30] . Various efficient methods on the synthesis of dihydropyrimidines have been developed in the past decade which is very well described in Scheme 1 and 2. But still, various recent alternative approaches have been reported for the synthesis of this attractive molecule as described in Scheme 3. Multi-component reactions have been very successful in generating complex molecules in a reported the use of b-cyclodextrin-propyl sulfonic acid (2 mol %) as a catalyst in the synthesis of 3,4-dihydropyrimidinones 20 through a one-pot-multicomponent reaction of benzaldehydes 1, urea/ thiourea 2 and ethyl acetoacetate 3 under solvent-free conditions at 80 C [2] . Cyclodextrins are macrocyclic oligosaccharides, possessing hydrophobic cavities which bind to the substrate via noncovalent interactions. This property of cyclodextrin is utilized in various applications [33, 34] . Benazzouz et al. described a simple and efficient synthetic startegy for a new series of 4-aryl-6-methyl-5-(2-oxo-2Hchromene-3-carbonyl)-3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)ones/thiones 22 or 23 [35] . The reaction was initiated using 3-(acetoacetyl) coumarin derivatives as key synthon 21, parasubstituted benzaldehyde 1 and urea/thiourea 3 in the presence of sulfuric acid, acting as a catalyst, under refluxing acetonitrile.",

The keggin type polyoxometalates have acidic and oxidizing properties which are mainly dependent upon the nature of components and composition that can be easily modified according to the reaction needs. The Bignelli reaction was carried out using two solvent EtOH (polar protic) and MeCN (polar aprotic) under reflux conditions. The condensation of ethyl/methyl acetoacetate 3, benzaldehyde 1, and urea 2 in the presence of H 4 SiMo 12 O 4 as catalyst, using ethanol and MeCN as solvent for 1.5 h afforded 3,4-dihydropyrimidin-2(1H)-ones 20 in a moderate to good yields (52e82%) [36] . In 2015, Treptow et al. reported the fatty acid synthesis of 3,4dihydropyrimidinones 20 by utilizing the bignelli multicomponent reaction. The reaction was carried out by reacting aromatic aldehyde 1, urea or thiourea 2, b-ketoesters 3, in the presence of catalytic amount of InCl 3 (10mol %) using acetonitrile as solvent, thereby affording DHPM-fatty acid synthesis in good to excellent yields [37] . Qiu et al. described cerium (III) trislaurylsulfonate (Ce(LS) 3 ) as an efficient, stable catalyst which is a combination of lewis acid with surfactant. This catalyst is being ultilised to catalyse one-pot bignelli as well as solvent free esterification reactions. 3,4-dihyropyrimidinone were obtained in 83% yield by employing a reaction of benzaldehydes 1, ethylacetoacetate 3, and urea 2 in presence of catalytic amount of Ce(C 12 H 25 SO 3 ) 3 , and one drop of conc.

The reaction was carried out with similar substrates, as benzaldehyde 1, urea 2, and ethylacetoacetate 3. A comparative study was undertaken using solvent-free conditions at 40 C using diphenic acid under thermal conditions (condition A) and under microwave exposure at 80 C in acetonitrile without the use of diphenic acid (condition B) as described in Scheme 3. Diphenic acid is used to provide polar conditions to the reaction and to make the carbonyl group of aldehyde more polar for the nucleophileelectrophile attack. It was found that reaction carried out in microwave radiation was fast, clean, and produce excellent yields. The structure-activity relationship study has also been conducted for both the conditions and it was found that in case of aromatic aldehyde substituted with electron-donating groups afforded 80e85% yield. While aromatic aldehydes substituted with electronwithdrawing group afforded 80e95% yield and heteroaromatic aldehydes end up with 90e95% yields. In case of aliphatic aldehyde, like formaldehyde produce a yield of 92% whereas acetaldehyde and butanal afforded the product in trace amounts [39] . Many synthetic approaches have been conducted under solvent-free conditions for the synthesis of 3,4-dihyrdopyrimidin-2(1H)-one using Bignelli reaction conditions as described in [41] . Good yields were obtained when the reaction was carried out using aliphatic aldehydes and bismuth nitrate as catalyst. However, when bignelli reaction was carried out using bismuth nitrate in acetonitrile under the effect of microwave radiation in the absence of solvent, product was obtained in quanitative yield [41, 42] . In 2011, Mansoor et al. described the synthesis of DHPM using triphenylphoshphine (10 mol%) as catalyst under solvent free conditions at 100 C for 8 h from the use of similar three component substrates aromatic aldehydes 1, urea/thiourea 2, and b-ketoesters 3 [43] . Triphenyphosphine act as a lewis base by interacting with the electrophilic carbon of the aldehyde. The enolate of b-ketoester is formed by coordinating the aldehyde with PPh 3 , which helps in the deprotonation of b-ketoester. In 2014, Attri et al. utilized triethylammoniumacetae (TEAA) as a catalyst and reaction medium for the synthesis of 3,4-dihydropyrimidinone 20 and its derivatives under solvent free conditions using aldehydes 1, urea/thiourea 2, and b-ketoesters 3 as subtrates [44] . The reaction yield was obtained upto 92%. TEAA is relatively inexpensive, thermostable, non-toxic, recyclable and has vast applications as catalyst and reaction medium.",

It has been subdivided in two categories: metal-catalyzed enantioselective bignelli reaction and organocatalytic enantioselective bignelli reaction. In case of metal-catalyzed reaction, Mu\u00f1oz-Mu\u00f1iz and Juaristi reported enantioselective synthesis of DHPM 20, by utilsing CeCl 3 or InCl 3 -catalysed bignelli reaction in the presence of chiral ligand. Different chiral ligands were employed with CeCl 3 or InCl 3 to achieve the best enantioselective synthesis. It was found that ligand (R,R)-24 showed best results in inducing enantioselectivity whereas other ligands as benzylamine (S)-25 did not revealed any stereoselective synthesis because it directly incorporates to the aldehyde component. When the reaction occurred between the intermediate 26 and ethylacetoacetate 3 at \u00c078 C to 0 C, highest enantioselectivity was obtained upto 40% ee as described in Scheme 5 [45, 46] . In 2006, Chen et al. and co workers were able to synthesize a series of chiral-phosphoric acids which act as catalyst for the enantioselective synthesis of bignelli reaction. Chiral phosphoric acid 27, termed as H 8 -bino-based phosphoric acid was found to be effective in providing product 20 in yield upto 40e86% and 88e97% enantioselectivity was observed using threecomponent substrate as aldehydes 1, urea/thiourea 2, and bketoesters 3 [45, 47] .",

They synthesized three series of molecules with different functional groups which are mentioned by R & R 1 in Fig. 4 . We observed different molecules which have shown anti-inflammatory activity. Compounds 36, 40 & 44 were found the most potent among the all molecules. The presence of 4-methoxy group at C-4 plays an important role in the activity of compounds. It was observed that 4methoxy phenyl increases the activity of the compounds. On the other hand, C-6 phenyl group reduces the activity of the compounds but when the phenyl group was replaced by the p-chlorophenyl at C-6 & 4-methoxy phenyl at C-4 then the activity of the compound was found to be increased. When the methoxy group at C-4 was replaced by any other group then the activity decreased [52] . The structure and inhibitory percentage 50 value (IP 50 ) of the compound are given in Fig. 4 . evaluated for their enzymatic activity against HIV integrase [11] . Compound 46, 48, 53 & 55 inhibited strand transfer and submicromolar activities. They observed that C-6 substitution play an important role in the potency of the compounds. When the R 2 was substituted with methyl or ethyl groups, an enhancement of activity was observed. On the other hand, when R 2 was substituted with phenyl or isopropyl groups, a decremental effect in activity was observed. This proves that steric hindrance at C-6 was not tolerated. The structures of the potent compounds are given in Figs. 5 and 6 and their IC 50 values are shown in Table 1 , respectively. The different substitution R 1 , R 2 and R 3 are differentiated by the help of different color.",

The plates were then kept for solidification, after solidification 100 mL of the fresh culture was spread onto the surface of the solidified medium. The plates were then left for drying in a laminar fashion. After drying, five plain sterile disks were placed in the plate and 5 mL of test solution of different concentrations (*250.000e15.625 ppm) was loaded onto the individual disks.

The plates were then taken out from incubator and zone of inhibition was recorded for all the test compounds and control. The experiments were conducted in triplicate for each treatment against each bacterium. The MIC (Minimum inhibitory concentration) is defined as the lowest possible concentration of the test compound that is able to inhibit the organism and was measured using micro-dilution assay. It was determined on the basis of the serial dilution method by varying the concentration of test compounds ranging from 200 to 15 .625 mg/mL. Requisite concentrations of test compounds were added to all the sterile Erlenmeyer flask, each containing 10 mL nutrient broth and were sonicated for 10 min.

It is a discolouration assay, which is evaluated by the addition of the antioxidant or test compound to a DPPH solution in ethanol and the decrease in absorbance was measured. Fig. 16 with their IC 50 value [62] . Attri et al. and coworkers synthesized 3,4-dihyropyrimidinone derivatives (84e96) and were evaluated for their antioxidant and antibacterial activity. The antioxidant activity was determined using DPPH (1,1-dipheny-2-picrylhydrazyl) free radical scavenging and (cupric reducing antioxidant capacity) CUPRAC assays. DPPH assay is basically used to determine the free radical scavenging property of antioxidant compounds [44] . Gallic acid and quercitin were used as standard compounds and the working solutions of test extracts and standards were prepared in methanol. When the dark colored DPPH radical solution in the presence of antioxidant compounds change to yellow colored diphenylpicrylhydrazine, the absorbance of the solution generally decreases. Different concentration of test solutions were prepared such as 100 mg/mL, 50 mg/ mL, 25 mg/mL and 12.5 mg/mL and were pipetted to test tube and volume was adjusted to 3 mL using methanol. 1 mL of DPHH solution (0.1 mM) was mixed with 1 mL of the sample and standard separately. The samples were vortexed and incubated in dark for 30 min. Change in absorbance was measured at 517 nm using spectrophotometer. The absorbance was measured and radical scavenging activity was expressed as percent inhibition of DPPH racdical.

Whereas at 12.5 ppm, gallic acid and quercitin possessed inhibition percent of 62.4% and 55.3% respectively, but all the test compounds showed a decreased percent inhibition. Compound 88 was found to posses the lowest inhibition percentage of 17.3%. Thus, finally all the compounds revealed moderate antioxidant activity in comparison to the standard compound.

The basic priniciple employed in this assay is the redox reduction of Cu (II) to Cu (I) which is monitored by change in absorbance at 450 nm. This redox reaction is a result of the CUPRAC reagent, Cu(II)-neocuproine (Cu (Nc) 2 2\u00fe ), with an antioxidant (A-OH), to form the CUPRAC chromophore, Cu(I)-neocuproine (Cu(Nc) 2\u00fe chelate [44, 63] .

Sample solution and distilled water were added and mixed to obtain a total volume of 4 mL. The reduction capability is assessed by increased absorbance of the reaction mixture. The results obtained from CUPRAC assay can easily be extended possibly to in vivo reactions of antioxidants. The assay is basically performed at physiological pH closer to 7. The absorbance of Cu (I)chelate formed as a result of redox reaction with reducing antioxidant was measured at 450 nm. The color is possibly due to the formation of Cu (I)-Nc chelate. The increase in absorption indicates the higher antioxidant activity. All the compounds show moderate activity in comparison to the standard compounds. All the compounds were found to reduce copper ions from Cu (II) to Cu (I) in a concentration-dependent manner. At 100 ppm, compound 89 was found to have highest absorbance value of 0.87 in comparison to the standard gallic acid and quercitin having absorbance value of 1.4 and 1.2 respectively as described in Fig. 18 . Whereas at the lowest concentration 12.5 ppm, absorbance of test compounds range from 0.21 to 0.05 with compound 95 possessing the lowest absorbance value of 0.05.

The SAR study suggests that the presence of 5-nitro-2-furfuryl moiety and 4-chlorophenyl groups as substituent tend to increase the anticancer activity [28] . human) [37] . The relationship between antitumor activity and lipophilicity, unsaturation, number of carbon atoms, and functional group was also determined. A set of compounds derived from palmitic acid (set a), stearic (set b) and oleic acid (set c) was synthesized with the DHPM nucleus. Oxo-monastrol 141a-c and monastrol analogs 142a-c, as well as compounds 139a-c, 140a-c which lacked aromatic ring substitution were screened for cell viability in the C6 rat glioma cell line. The screening was conducted after 24 h of treatment with test compound at concentration ranging from 0 to 200 mM. Compound 139c was the only compound to reduce the C6 cell viability in a concentration dependent manner. Out of the compounds 141a-c, 142a-c only few were able to reduce the cell viability at 50 mM except compound 142b. However, compounds 139a-c, 141a-c, 142a-c were also screened in human glioma cell lines (UG-138-MG human) as described in Fig. 22 . The hybrid DHPM-fatty acid 141a-c and 142a-c were able to reduce the cell viability at 50 mM with 141a (hybrid oxo-monastrol-palmitic acid) being the most potent at 10 mM. Compound 139c again was found to decrease the cell viability in a concentration dependent manner. The result described that the hydroxyl group present in the aromatic ring are essential for the antitumor activity in hybrid DHPM-fatty acid against gliomas. It was also observed that all novel oxo-monastrol and monastrol fatty acid analogs were found to be more potent than monastrol itself. These fatty acid analogs tend to impart lipophilic character which is able to cross the blood brain barrier. This may be considered as a promising approach for overcoming resistance to chemotherapy and help in the development of new anti-tumor drugs. The cytotoxic activity of the compounds was evaluated using organotypic hippocampal slice cultures as models. This culture is composed of different neural cells and were prepared from 6 to 8 day old male Wistar rat using a McWallin tissue chopper and separated in ice-cold HBSS with pH maintained at 7.2. The slices were then placed into Millicell Culture insertsand further transferred to 6-well culture plate. The medium usually consists of 50% MEM, 25% HBSS, 25% horse serum which was changed after every three days and experiment was conducted after every 14 days. Cells were then treated with 200 mM concentrations of 139c, 141a, 141c, 142a and 142c for 24 h. Cellular death in organotypic hippocampal cultures was determined by flouroscent imaging analysis of PI uptake. 5 mM of PI was added to the cultures after 24 h of treatment ",

TRPA1 is believed to function as a mechanical and chemical stress sensor. The specific function of this protein may involve a role in signal transduction and growth control. All the synthesized compounds were tested on both the human and rat TRPA1 channel. In general, a similar activity was monitored for the human and rat channel, with most of the compounds, a slightly higher potency for rat TRPA1 was observed. At all concentrations the tested compounds behaved as true antagonists, in competition with the applied agonists. This is unlike many electrophilic ligands, which can display functional antagonism via desensitization of the channel, depending on their concentration. Introduction of various substituents on the aryl substituent of 143 had a strong effect on the potency of the tricyclic DHPMs. Ortho-and para-substituted compounds 144, 146 and 148 led to a drop in activity compared to unsubsituted compound 128. In variance, meta-substitution such as in 145, 147, 149, 150 and 151 increased the potency relative to compound 143. Especially meta-methoxy substituted compound 147 displayed a more than 10-fold enhanced potency and additional analogs around compound 147 were investigated. Combination of a meta-methoxy substituent with additional methoxy substituents as in 151e152 led to a loss in activity. Increase in the length of methoxy group proved to be better tolerated and compound 153 and 154 being the most potent compounds identified [67] . The structure and IC 50 value of the compound are given in Fig. 23 and Table 9 respectively. inhibited more than 50% of the protease activity at 50 mM were selected for the next assay run at 10 mM for IC 50 calculation. Only two compounds were found to be active against SARS-CoV 3CL pro among the fourteen molecules. The IC 50 values of the active (155 &156) compounds are given 10.6 and 6.1 mM respectively. Compound 155 was found to be the most potent molecule. The SAR study showed that when the R 0 position of the C-4 atom substituted by the nitro group and also R was replaced by Cl group. The potency of the molecule was increased markedly. When the both R 0 position was replaced with the nitro group. The activity of the compound was decreased markedly [68] .

Sehon et al. reported a new class of dihyropyrimidinone derieved amides (158e180) which were then evaluated for their activity against ROCK 1 [71] . The 4-OMe group present in the compound 158 was found to have better oral bioavailablity (35%) compared to compound 163 (0%) and therefore it was further studied. Compound 172 substituted with 2-F, 4-Cl group which are found to be optimal for the activity against ROCK1. It was found to possess good oral bioavailability at 58% and is 100 times more selective than other selected kinases. It revealed a remarkable IC 50 value of 200 nM when the rat aortic contraction assay was performed. However, IC 50 value against RSK1 and p70S6K was 510 and 2100 respectively. But it possessed significant P450 inhibition against CYP2D6 which appears to be general for the 4-OMe series and is insurmountable. Because of these issues, the focus was shifted to compound 163 which was substituted with pyridyl ring in which ROCK1 enzyme activity was maintained and CYP2D6 was substantially diminished but the oral bioavailability was decreased. Compound 176 and 178 were found to have improved oral bioavailability of 49% and 53% respectively as shown in Fig. 26 . Compound 176 consist of chloro group which showed improved half-life in rats (1.8 h), good selectivity upto 100 folds against a panel of 31 kinases, IC 50 of 256 nM and has improved P450 profile. It was therefore selected for in vivo efficacy study and was used in a spontaneously hypertensive rat (SHR) model for hypertension.

It has been estimated that it may affect atleast 50% of the male population in the United States by 50 years of age. However, the incidence rate may increase to 85% by the age of 80 [72, 73] . BPH is a result of two mechanistic components: mechanical and dynamic component. Mechanical component is a result of increased prostatic mass which is mainly attributed due to the 5a-dihydrotestosterone. 5a-reductase is the enzyme responsible for the conversion of testosterone to 5a-dihydrotestosterone. Various inhibitors of this enzyme such as finasteride have been clinically proven to reduce the size of the prostate gland and decrease the symptoms of BPH. The dynamic component of BPH is attributed to the endogeneous adrenergic tone which restricts the flow through urethra. Adrenergic receptor a 1 antagonists such as terazosin, relieves symptoms of BPH by relaxing lower urinary tract tissue and finally reducing prostatic and uretheral tone. Tamsulosin is considered as the 'prostate selective' a 1 antagonists and is currently marketed due to better therapeutic index when compared to terazosin as shown in Fig. 27 . Recently it has been found that niguldipine, a calcium channel blocker was found to be potent a 1a receptor subtype antagonists with 100 times greater selectivity than other a 1 receptor subtypes (see Fig. 28 ).",

Methylation of N-1 improves selectivity while methylation at N-3 decreased but both of them possessed similar potencies [181(0.18 \u00b1 0.025 nM), and 206(0.14 \u00b1 0.040 nM) vs 192(0.39 \u00b1 0.05 nM)]. On combining N-1 methylated DHP with 4-cyanopiperdines, extraordinary selective compounds were obtained (201e213). However on acylation of N-3 with acetyl 207(2.2 \u00b1 0.10 nM) and carbomethoxy 208(0.75 \u00b1 0.010 nM), a decrease in both selectivity and potency was observed. Compound 194 was the only compound to exhibit 1000 time greater selectivity and a 1a receptor binding affinity (0.24 \u00b1 0.050 nM) than any other compound synthesized.(see Fig. 29 ).",

The compounds were tested on rat models where the prostate of anesthetized rat was exposed. Compounds were tested for their inhibiton (AD 50 (mg/kg) value) of contractile response induced by the a 1a selective agoinst A61063 [26, 29] . Compounds containing flouro and cyano substituent on the 4-arylpiperidine were found to be quiet potent with AD 50 value below 2 mg/kg whereas the piperidine X \u00bc substituent followed a trend as OH < H < CN (203 vs 191 vs 204). The pharmacodynamic parameter i.e. duration of action for majority of compounds which was measured at agonist concentration and is 4 times greater AD 50 and was found to be short and is unexplainable. Compounds with marked plasma-half lives were also found to have short duration of action as others. Methylation at N-1 nitrogen of DHP was found to have increased duration of action (181, 185, 209 and 211e214) . The in vitro metabolism of most of the compounds (187, 188, 189, 194e196, 198, 209) was examined using human liver microsomal preparations (10e50 mM substrate, microsomal protein 2 mg/mL, for 1 h, LC-MS/ MS detection). These experiments revealed rapid N-dealkylation of the piperidine and N-3 methyl of the DHP as well as the desaturation of DHP nucleus to the pyrimidine nucleus as primary metabolic pathways.(see Fig. 30 ).",

Pharmacodynamic efficacy and selectivity was done by canine intraurethral pressure (IUP) assay for compound 194. This leads to the simultaneous monitoring of the heart rate and blood pressure. When determined for inhibition of phenylepherine-induced changes in IUP, Compound 194 was found to be more potent than terazosin. It was also found to have longer duration of action of more than 6 h.

Dihydropyrimidinones revolutionized the chemistry of purines as well as pyrimidines by their different biological activities which make them a advantageous scaffold. Their antagonistic nature towards the natural pyrimidines makes them powerful candidates for the synthesis of various effective and successful molecules. A number of drugs like 5-fluorouracil, idoxuridine, methythiouracil, emivirin, aminophylline containing dihydropyrimidinones are already discovered and effectively used in the prevention or treatment of multiple diseases. The DPHMS and their derivatives are the versatile molecules, which have been explored for the various diseases as antimicrobial, antihypertensive, anti-HIV, anticancer etc. The researchers explored their SAR, as well as binding mode through molecular modeling studies. In addition, recognition of a rational picture towards the appropriate substitutions accountable for its effectiveness and toxicity may be a future skeleton so that the toxicity problems related with the dihydropyrimidinones can be recognized and overcome.",
