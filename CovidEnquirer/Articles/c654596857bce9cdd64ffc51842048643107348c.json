Since initial treatment for H. pylori infection is often empirical, therefore it is very important to monitor the local resistance pattern. Objectives: The aims of our study were: to determine the prevalence of H. pylori resistance to clarithromycin, metronidazole and amoxycillin in children prior to eradication therapy, and to detect mutations responsible for clarithromycin resistance. Material and methods: During 2000 \u00c1/ 2001, 57 H. pylori strains were isolated from gastric biopsies. Susceptibility to antimicrobials was determined by the E -test. Mutations in the 23S rRNA gene associated with clarithromycin resistance were analysed by PCR-RFLP and direct sequencing. Results: Overall, 24 strains (42%) were resistant to metronidazole, 25 strains (44%) were resistant to clarithromycin, and 14 strains (25%) were simultaneously resistant to both drugs. All cultured isolates were sensitive to amoxicillin. Primary resistance to clarithromycin was mainly associated with an A2143G mutation in the 23S rRNA gene of H. pylori . However, isolates containing an A2142G mutation had higher MICs of clarithromycin. Conclusion: Our results show the high prevalence of H. pylori resistance to clarithromycin in Polish children, which implies a need for pretreatment susceptibility testing.",

Central Public Health Labortory, Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens, London, UK Pre-treatment resistance of Helicobacter pylori to clarithromycin (CLA) and metronidazole (MTZ) is a key factor in eradication therapy failure. Adenine (A) to guanine (G) or A to cytosine (C) mutations at nucleotide 2142, or A to G at 2143 in the 23S rDNA confer in vitro CLA resistance. Our aims were to determine if mutation type and high level CLA resistance was linked and to test for cross-associations with high level MTZ resistance. One thousand one hundred and fifty-one UK isolates from routine endoscopies were tested for susceptibility to CLA and MTZ using E -test. PCR-RFLP identified rDNA mutations in the 92 CLA resistant isolates using Mbo II and Bsa I, respectively for the A2142G and A2143G mutations, and by PCR assay for the A2142C mutation. Mutation frequency was: A2142G, 22.8%; A2143G, 63.0%; and A2142C, 3.3%. In addition, 3.3% were heterozygous for A2142G and A2143G. No mutation was detected in 7.6% of resistant strains (confirmed by sequencing). High level CLA resistance (MIC !/ 256 mg/ml) occurred in 43.3% strains representing 17/21 A2142G mutations. Fifty-six isolates were both CLA and MTZ resistant, of these 30 strains had high level CLA resistance and 27 high level MTZ resistance. No single mutation predominated in dual resistant strains. Our findings indicate that an A2142G mutation predicts a 81.4% likelihood of high level CLA resistance. Our mutation assays provide a specific basis to obtain CLA resistance data for treatment and surveillance.",

Central Public Health Laboratory, Laboratory of Enteric Pathogens, London, UK Helicobacter pylori colonizes the gastric mucosa of \u00c2/50% of the worlds human population. In a significant subgroup of infected hosts, H. pylori is associated with the aetiology of a number of gastric diseases, most notably gastric and duodenal ulceration. The macrolide antibiotic clarithromycin is a key component of many combination therapies used to eradicate H. pylori infection. However, resistance to clarithromycin is an important cause of treatment failure. Clarithromycin resistance is associated with mutations in 23S rRNA nucleotides 2142 and 2143 that inhibit the binding of the drug to the ribosome. A rapid, real-time PCR assay for the detection of 23S rDNA mutations conferring clarithromycin resistance was developed using the Roche LightCycler. The assay utilized a pair of biprobes, one specific for the A2142G mutation and one for the wild type sequence (A2142C and A2143G mutations were detected by characteristic reduction in biprobe Tm). The PCR assay was applied to DNA extracted from 150 selected H. pylori isolates from UK patients and identified the 23S rDNA as wild type (45), A2142G (17), A2142C (3), A2143G (70) and heterozygous (15). These results correlated (95%) with those obtained by disk diffusion sensitivity testing and PCR-RFLP based methodologies. The LightCycler assay was successfully applied to DNA extracted from 20 gastric biopsy samples, thus offering the potential to inform patient management without the necessity of culture.",

These include DNA-based methods such as macrorestriction analysis using pulsedfield gel electrophoresis (PFGE), ribotyping, and amplification-based methods such as rapid amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP). We used a homogeneous strain collection of 24 transconjugants resulting from filter-matings with different antibiotic-resistant E. faecium and a recipient isolate from our lab. The influence of transferred antibiotic-resistance determinants on the outcome of different typing methods was investigated. Results: Fragment patterns resulting from PFGE indicated minor differences between the transconjugants and the recipient. In respect to different primers used for RAPD, none or only a single fragment shift was detected in the resulting fragment patterns. AFLP clusters all transconjugants into a group of major relatedness, but the result was strongly dependent on the mathematical method used for cluster analysis. Fragment patterns of digested plasmids showed the possession of different or only widely related plasmids in the transconjugants. Conclusions: The results of this study clearly show that under certain situations typing methods commonly used for enterococci and related gram-positive bacteria come to their limits.",

Fifteen strains were serially and daily passaged in subinhibitory concentrations of these four antibiotics by a gradient plate method until acquisition of resistance.

Five strains were susceptible (S) to penicillin (P) (one reference strain, four clinical isolates: P MICsB/0.064 mg/l): five were intermediate (I) to P (one reference strain: P MIC 0.19 mg/l, four clinical strains P MICs: 0.5 \u00c1/1 mg/l), five were resistant (R) to P (P MICs 1.5 mg/l). Mean of number of passages (n ) necessary to reach I or R level with each FQ as selecting agent are in the following table: SPX and LEV induced resistance but more slowly than CIP.

Opaque SP has proven more virulent than the T form during systemic infection in a mouse model. Aim of this study was to evaluate phase variation in the nasopharynx of children. SP strains were isolated during a winter epidemiology study of NP samples in children from family DCC. MICs determinations were performed by E -test for penicillin (P), amoxicilline (AMX) and ceftriaxone (CRO). Serotypes were performed using the Quellung reaction. Upon oil immersion microscopic examination short chains of six to eight cocci were noted as 0, '/, '/'/, '/'/'/ for absence, 1, 2, !/3 chains by field, respectively. Phase variation was detected on catalase Trypticase Soja plates, AMX and CRO MICs and bactericidal activity was determined for 10 pairs of O and T variants with different serotypes and susceptibility to penicillin. Seventy strains of SP were screened for phase variation. Nine out of 42 with chain length 0, '/ had O variants while 23 out of 28 strains with chain length '/'/ or '/'/'/ showed O variants. Proportion of O variants was predominant when chain length increased. Serotype 23F was prevalent. Bactericidal activity of O variants showed a four-to eightfold increase of MBC. O variants may be present in NP of children while T are predominant form for colonization. These virulent variants with lower level of autolysis showed less susceptibility to killing by antibiotics.

Though the mean number of newly diagnosed AIDS p had a sharp drop in the HAART era, from 65 p/year in 1991 \u00c1/ 1995 to 22 p/year since 1997 (P B/0.001), the distribution of ADD and underlying immunodeficiency showed limited changes. When excluding a greater frequency of tuberculosis (TB) (P B/0.001) and wasting syndrome (P B/0.04), all other ADD did not show a different frequency before and after 1997. A tendency towards a higher mean CD4 count at AIDS disease was noticed: 78 vs 61 cells/ml (P B/0.003), with a significant difference for Candida esophagitis , toxoplasmosis, Kaposi sarcoma and TB (P B/0.002 \u00c1/B/0.03). The limited variation of clinical and immunological presentation are attributable to the poor impact of HAART before AIDS recognition: 88.4% of p detected since 1997 did not receive HAART or had insufficient compliance to antiretrovirals, so that 58.2% of p were AIDS presenters. During the HAART era, an increase of mean age and sexual transmission was found (P B/0.001). Notwithstanding the effects of HAART on the natural history of HIV disease, the consequences on ADD distribution and related immunodeficiency were negligible, since most p could not benefit from HAART before AIDS onset. A high clinical suspicion for ADD should be maintained when facing p with missed or undertreated HIV disease.",

There was no difference on CD4 cell counts and viral loads in the two groups and between the patients treated by NNRTIs and PIs at the diagnosis of tuberculosis, at the time of antituberculosis drug discontinuation and concerning cure rates of tuberculosis. On the other hand, the plasma HIV viral load was significantly better controlled in patients with NNRTIs than with PIs (P B/0.005). In HIV patients with active tuberculosis receiving HAART, antiretroviral combination including NNRTIs allows a better control of viral replication than regimen including PIs without impact of the use of rifampin or rifabutin.",

When 1570 community-acquired E. coli isolates were compared with 2687 nosocomial strains (tested in the years 2000 \u00c1/ 2001), a greater susceptibility of community-acquired E. coli isolates was limited to cotrimoxazole versus all other compounds in the year 2000 (P B/0.03), while it was extended to amoxicillin, cephalotin, nitrofurantoin and piperacillin in the year 2001 (P B/0.0001) (Fig. 2) . On the whole, E. coli showed an elevated sensitivity rate ( !/90% of tested strains) to nitrofurantoin, gentamicin, amikacin, and 2nd-and 3rd-generation cephalosporins, while only amoxicillin and piperacillin had a mean resistance rate !/30%, regardless of the community or nosocomial origin.

Although the levels of Bcr (100/200 mg/ml) in the Bcr mutants could be raised only by persistent efforts, an increase in the levels of Lzr (as cross-resistance) in the same mutants could be easily achieved. A correlation of actinomycin-D resistance with Lzr and Bcr of the mutant bacteria and the effects of lipase treatment on the same showed a 4 \u00c1/20-fold rise in actinomycin-D resistance of the Lzr and Bcr mutants of Gram-positive bacteria compared with their correspondence wild-types. These findings suggest that Lzr and Bcr are controlled by several genes accounting for reduced cell-wall and cell-membrane permeability and indirectly, by phenotypic alteration of the lipid content of the cell-wall. Thus, the alteration of cell-walls and membranes and a phenotypic extra lipid layer can work in conjunction with the efflux pump mechanisms finally determining the levels of drug-resistance.",

Pearsons's coefficient of correlation for the use of imipenem and the resistance against imipenem was 0.62 (P B/0.001), between imipenem use and PT resistance was 0.57 (P B/0.005), and between imipenem use and ceftazidim resistance 0.56 (P B/0.005).

Finding the important implications for the way in which physicians manage patients with mild \u00c1/moderate respiratory tract infections, and the relation of this management with the perception of antibiotic effectiveness, and the compliance with the antibiotic regimen has been the main purpose of the research. In a pan-European market research study of more than 3000 patients, designed to determine behaviour to the antibiotic management of mild-moderate respiratory tract infections, patient expectations of antibiotic therapy were identified, particularly those aspects that relate to efficacy and compliance. The study identifies three key drivers of patients perceived antibiotic efficacy: length of antibiotic course, time to onset of symptom relief and time to complete resolution of symptoms. The results demonstrate that once daily treatment for short periods is perceived by patients to be significantly more effective than longer antibiotic courses and thus better meets patient expectations of therapy. In this study, a macrolide, azithromycin, was selected as the drug therapy of shortest course, being the antibiotic with the shortest dosage schedule for common outpatient infections. The perception of efficacy with short course therapy also correlates with overall satisfaction with management by the physician and with patient compliance with antibiotic therapy. Purpose of the study: Group B streptococci (GBS) remain a major cause of neonatal infections. Consensus guidelines have recommended an intrapartum antibioprophylaxis by amoxicillin, which has reduced the incidence of early-onset neonatal GBS infections. However, an increased incidence of beta-lactam-resistant Gram-negative neonatal sepsis has been reported. The aim of our study was to analyse the consequences of this antibioprophylaxis on the intestinal microbial colonization of newborns. A study of the fecal flora was carried out on 50 stools samples from 3 days-old newborns divided into groups: group A intrapartum treated mothers (n 0/25); and group B untreated mothers (n0/25). Both groups were matched with regards to known factors affecting intestinal microbial colonization: gestational age, type of delivery and feeding.",

We analysed the biological 'weak-spots' of the mucor-rhizopus group and attempted to devise suitable drugs using their weak-spots. We have noted that like many free-living fungi, the M-Z fungi are facultatively chemoautotrophic (can grow on simple sources of carbon and nitrogen and a solution of mineral salts), like the human pathogenic chemoautotrophic nocardioform bacteria. We devised a minimal medium based on that of Davis and Mingioli, supplemented with simple chemical compounds as sole sources of carbon and nitrogen. The key chemical here was diphenylamine with trypan blue (DPA \u00c1/TB) and other similar sources of C and N. We found that while media free of these chemicals (controls) allowed good growth of different strains of M-Z fungi, a mixture of DPA \u00c1/TB completely prevented their growth over a wide concentration range. Experiments with immunocompromised mice showed that these drugs at the concentrations used are well tolerated; mice experimentally infected with several clinical isolates of M-Z fungi and receiving these chemicals showed that these fungi could not grow in vivo.",

Results and conclusions: All the strains were resistant to four or more of the following antibiotics: ampicillin, tetracyclines, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulphonamides and nalidixic acid. A high proportion of strains were intermediate or resistant to amoxicillin/clavulanate. We found no resistance to cephalosporins. Nevertheless, 26% were intermediate to first and/or second gen. cephalosporins. Cefotaxime and cefepime were the most active cephalosporins (MIC50: 0.1 mg/l). Though increasing fluoroquinolones resistance has been described among this kind of strains, no resistance to fluoroquinolones was found here.

Nineteen TB patients and seven healthy donors were enrolled in French Hospitals. Cellular immune responses were evaluated by lymphoproliferation and ex-vivo quantification of specific Th1 cells by ELISPOT-IFN-gamma assays. Four recombinant proteins of M. tuberculosis were tested: ESAT-6, 85B, Erp and TB B1.3 and compared with tuberculin. We confirmed that 85B (but not ESAT-6 in our study) gives higher responses in TB patients compared to donors according to the results in proliferation assay (P 0/0.04). In addition, frequencies of Th1 CD4 specific cells for ESAT-6 and tuberculin were statistical different between the two groups (P0/0.04 and 0.028, respectively). 41.1% for 85B and 70.5% for ESAT-6 of the patients tested were responders in ELISPOT-assay versus 57.9% for both in proliferation assay. For the new antigens Erp and TB B1.3, no difference was observed between the two groups. In conclusion, 85B and ESAT-6 are recognised by a large number of our patients. They seem to be promising antigens for the development of new methods of diagnosis or for the development of new vaccines. Erp and TB B1.3 are not preferentially recognised by TB patients. Other exported antigens will be tested. The incidence of tuberculosis (TB) is increasing worldwide. In recent some years, geographical differences in the incidence of TB in former Yugoslavia have been observed. An important rise in TB cases was registered in the bordering region of Bosnia. It is likely that poorer living conditions, influenced by war and emotional stress, may promote such rising incidence of TB.",

M. kansasi is detected as the most common atypical mycobacterium agent in pulmonary infections and attention to antibiogram is recommended before treatment. Buruli ulcer caused by Mycobacterium ulcerans , is the third most common mycobacterial after tuberculosis and leprosy in west Africa. Nowadays, the only effective treatment is surgery. It consists in a large excision of the lesions, often followed by a skin transplant. In this study, the effectiveness of rifampin, amikacin and their combination were estimated in the treatment of mice, which were infected experimentally by M. ulcerans . After 15 weeks of treatment with rifampin, amikacin or their combination, no more viable bacilli were found in infected tissues. The animals were kept for 3 other months. Among the mice treated with rifampin alone, two mice out of 30 relapsed. The minimal inhibitory concentration of these isolated strains went from 0.5 to 8 mg/ml. The DNA sequence, obtained from a 93-pb of the rpob gene from these strains, showed a missense mutations, which affect a Ser-415 replaced by a phenylalanine. This modification on the gene leads to an important inefficacy of treatment when rifampin was used alone. This study showed that rifampin and amikacin have a bactericidal action on M. ulcerans and that a combination of these antibiotics is necessary to avoid the selection of resistant mutants.",

The disease was started 2 years earlier with the appearance of lesions on the left feet and on the right knee. Absolute number of CD4 and CD8 were 1200 and 486 cells/dl, respectively with a decreased lymphocyte proliferation. Human herpesvirus type 8 had been detected in biopsy specimens and she placed on recombinant interferon alpha-2b. Follow up few months later the lesions decreased in size. Two years after the onset of the disease the patient readmitted because of a mass on the left paratracheal region along with mediastinitis. Her body temperature was increased. The patient underwent thoracic CT scan, which demonstrated mediastinal well defined soft tissue infiltration associated with mediastinitis and a well-defined mass in the left paratracheal region. The mass biopsy revealed squamous cell carcinoma. Several violaceus lesions were observed on the arms, hands and face. Severe bilateral lymphedema of the legs with a reddish papules nodules and tumors from 0.5 to 7 cm in diameter on the soles, toes and calves were present. This case illustrates the significant relapsing of the cutaneous Kaposi's sarcoma soon after the appearance of and the carcinoma and the mediastinitis.

Two weeks after surgery he developed mediastinitis and sternal osteomyelitis caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA). Twice, revisions and plastic surgery for sternal osteomyelitis were performed. The patient received initially treatment with vancomycin. Then the patient received intravenous outpatient treatment with teicoplanin for 6 weeks followed by by treatment with fusidic acid and then trimethoprim/sulfametrol. The fistula was closed. Four months later he presented again with substernal pain and purulent discharge. The culture revealed the growth of staphylococci which were first mistaken for coagulase-negative staphylococci. After closer investigation these staphylococci were identified as small variant MRSA. Computer tomography (CT) revealed multiple mediastinal abscesses. The patient was treated with intravenous linezolid 600 mg bid for 10 days and then switched to oral linezolid 600 mg bid. The oral therapy was pursued for 16 weeks under close surveillance. The patient improved substantially, the purulent discharge disappeared. The mediastinal abscesses were not detected any longer by CT at the end of treatment.

The condition at admission was critical due to trombocytopenia ( B/2000 platelets/ml) and hemorrhage syndrome. The evolution was favorable under antimicrobial treatment (imipenem), blood and platelet transfusion, intravenous immunoglobulins, granulocyte colony-stimulating factor, antifungal prophylaxis and supportive care. Blood and pus cultures revealed MSSA. In the 6th day of hospitalization she developed bronchopneumonia and respiratory failure. The sputum culture was positive for Stenotrophomonas maltophilia susceptible to ceftazidime, fluoroquinolones. Treatment was unsatisfactory until introducing ticarcilline \u00c1/clavulanate and ciprofloxacine. She had uneventful recovery despite remaining granulocyto-trombocytopenic.",

University of Bologna, Infectious Diseases, Bologna, Italy A LTR receiving cyclosporin, azathioprine and steroids, developed an extraordinary episode of sepsis and pleural effusion due to a multiresistant Listeria monocytogenes (Lm) isolate. A Lm strain serov. 4 showing the same, extensive resistance pattern (all penicillins and 1stand 2nd-generation cephalosporins), was isolated from multiple blood cultures and pleural fluid 2 weeks after surgery, while stool exam was negative. Our p spent her life in countryside and bred some animals, but denied consumption of uncontrolled food. Iv cotrimoxazole administration achieved a complete clinical and microbiological cure in 10 days. Underlying immunodeficiency may prompt unusual/severe Lm infection, but because of its usual community-acquired origin, Lm disease remains infrequent in hospitalized p. Only seven anecdotal reports of Lm infection were described in LTR, 1986 \u00c1/2000, all but 1 occurring months \u00c1/years after surgery. An early respiratory and systemic infection caused by a community-acquired Lm strain which proved resistant to first-choice antibiotics, but had a favorable response to cotrimoxazole (used only once in a LTR with Lm sepsis), characterized our episode. An epidemiological survey retrieved the possible source of this usually community-acquired infection. Lm should be regarded as an emerging opportunistic pathogen in LTR, and specific risk factors should be seeked. When immunodeficiency is of concern, the unpredictable sensitivity of Lm should prompt in vitro assays to adjust antimicrobial therapy Problems for discussion HBV \u00c1/HCV and liver carcinogenesis: where does the viral influence end? OR2.2 Pappas GA. University Hospital, Internal Medicine, Ioannina, Greece Hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC) is a major clinical problem worldwide, usually evolving over a long-standing liver pathology, in the latter stages in the form of cirrhosis. HBV and HCV chronic infection is a common etiology of cirrhosis, and hence, HCC. A number of studies have attempted to clarify the role of these viruses into the progression towards HCC. Does their end in the stage of cirrhosis? Is progression towards HCC independent of the etiology of cirrhosis (since alcoholic cirrhosis also proceeds to HCC)? Do the trials with interferon alfa for patients with HBV or HCV cirrhosis exhibit a favorable result due to the antiviral properties of interferon, or is interferon exhibiting anti-oncogenic potential?, and is HCC cytokine and hormone sensitive (view ongoing trials with somatostatine analogues versus HCC)? (hence, if we treat alcoholic cirrhosis patients with interferon could we have a favorable response?). Which patients with HBV or HCV cirrhosis are eligible for interferon treatment?: interferon treatment is a potential hazard for those with thrombocytopenia. How ethical is it to conduct a randomised trial where one leg of cirrhotic patients is left without antiviral therapy? And on the basis of which classification system should the two legs of such a trial be separated? Moreover, do viral proteins with oncogenic potential exist (the controversy over the recently discovered HBV protein is still, unresolved)? A major topic awaiting for a major debate. To assess the role of HIV-associated campylobacteriosis (C) according to HAART availability, 17 patients with positive culture were identified since 1991. Compared with the \u00c2/1000 HIV-infected P followed in the last decade, no epidemiological differences were shown, save a greater sexual exposure to HIV (P B/0.005). The introduction of HAART caused a drop of frequency of C (from 1.8 to 0.9 episodes per 1000 p-year; P B/0.0001), and modified clinical features, with disappearance of dissemination and mortality, reported in 7 and 2 patients before 1996 (P B/0.03). HIV-related immunodeficiency and disease stage were significantly related to C features before and after HAART availability: P B/0.0001 for CD4 and neutrophil count, P B/0.007 for AIDS diagnosis. Most cases (15) were community-acquired, but alimentary or environmental risk factors were never found. Ten patients received cotrimoxazole prophylaxis (nine before 1996; P B/ 0.03), while no relationship occurred with steroid or antibiotic use, caused 14 cases out of 17. A 100% sensitivity was found to quinolones, followed by cephalosporins (82.3%), gentamicin (76.5%), macrolides (64.7%), and cotrimoxazole (47.1%). A 8 \u00c1/18-day antimicrobial therapy cured 16 P , but relapses caused by similar strains occurred in 6 patients within 2 \u00c1/8 weeks, all in the pre-HAART era (P B/0.05). C still occurs in the HAART era, probably due to its varied mode of transmission. The frequency of C is greater in HIV-infected patients, but less frequent visceralization, recurrences, and mortality characterized the HAART era.

Recent events that began in September 2001 in US has gained the organism worldwide attention and heightened awareness of and concern about anthrax. Many cases of anthrax with a number of deaths have been reported as a result of contact with envelopes, sent through postal mail, containing B. anthracis endospores. A number of studies have shown that currency is colonized with bacterial organisms, that include enteropathogens (e.g. Shigella sp.), other enteric flora (e.g. Escherichia coli ) and potential pathogens (e.g. Staphylcoccus sp. , Pseudomonas sp. and Bacillus sp.). Furthermore, methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA) isolates that produced enterotoxin (SEB) and toxic shock syndrome toxin-1 also been reported. All of these studies do agree on that currency may be considered as a method of spreading potentially pathogenic and pathogenic bacteria in the community. Therefore, currency could also be a vehicle for spreading other highly pathogenic organisms that include B. anthracis . In addition, the introduction of the 'euro' could also allow such bacteria greater freedom to travel across the euro zone. The threat of using currency, particularly paper notes, in spreading lethal organisms should be investigated and proper measures to prevent the use of such a method by terrorists should be implemented.",

The decision to stop the vaccination against smallpox and the loss of specific immunity of a high proportion of the population made apocalyptic the perspective of a natural or provoked re-emergence of smallpox. Therefore, it is important to improve the current capacities to prevent or to treat the orthopoxvirus infections. Uracil DNA glycosylase (UDG) is one viral enzyme indispensable to the replication of poxviruses. UDG of the Copenhagen strain of Vaccinia virus (VV) was characterized with the aim of defining specific inhibitors susceptible to be used as a new class of active antiviral substances on the viruses of the Orthopoxvirus genus. The activity of this enzyme was analysed in real time, in an original method, on a PCR quantitative instrument by digestion of amplified DNA revealed by fluorescent intercaled molecules. This technique was used to screen and select several active antiviral substances on UDG. Moreover, the antiviral activity was estimated by the cytopathic effect of the VV on infected Vero cells. The cytotoxicity was determined by inhibition of Trypan Blue exclusion. The specificity of action of each tested compound was estimated by the selective index (50% cytotoxic dose/50% effective dose). Two antiviral compounds were selected for their inhibitory effect on UDG activity and on VV replication in Vero cell culture : ('/)-5-iodo-2?-deoxyuridine and 4-chlorouracil. These compounds are candidates for the chemotherapy of poxvirus infections. Objective: To study the efficacy and tolerance of Russian antiviral drugs produced from DNA in a limited resources context.",

On admission in the hospital the alanino-aminotransferase was1060 U/l, the aspartate-aminotransferase 1017 U/l, bilirubin 10,2 mg/dl, HBsAg, HBcIgM and HBeAg were positive, HBV DNA was 300.000 copies/ml. During the following days, the levels of AST and ALT gradually rose; on the 14th day prothrombine time was 39%, bilirubin 30 mg/dl and the patient developed signs of encephalopathy. Four plasmapheresis were practiced without benefit, so the patient was treated with lamivudine, 100 mg/day. After 24 days of therapy, lamivudine was discontinued because of the appearance of diffuse maculopapular rash. At this time the results of liver function tests were normal; after four months HBsAg and HBV DNA were no longer detectable. In our patient lamivudine prevented an acute hepatic failure. Our experience suggests a promising role of lamivudine in the treatment of acute hepatitis B, but how long such therapy have to be practiced and in which patients?

Periodic monitoring of the antimicrobial susceptibility profile of Neisseria gonorrhoeae in a high-risk population provides essential clues regarding the rapidly changing pattern of antimicrobial susceptibilities. In India, such a surveillance of the in vitro antimicrobial susceptibility of N. gonorrhoeae was established in 1997. Significant increasing trend of penicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance with high MIC of 2 \u00c1/16 and 1 \u00c1/32 mg/ml, respectively were found over the years (1997 \u00c1/2001) . The molecular basis of ciprofloxacin resistance, i.e. mutations in the gyr A and the par C genes of 170 isolates, were analyzed. Four isolates (with an MIC of 32 mg/ml for ciprofloxacin) harbored triple mutations (Ser-91 to Phe, Asp-95 to Asn and Val-120 to Leu) in the gyr A gene. The third mutation of Val-120 to Leu, lies downstream of the quinolone resistance determining region of the gyr A and has not been described before in gonococcus. In addition, these isolates had a Phe-100 to Tyr substitution in the par C, a hitherto unknown mutation. The alterations in the par C gene were seen in these isolates only in the presence of changes in the gyr A gene and comprised amino acid changes at codons 91, 100, 104, 109, and 131. The presence of b-lactamase plasmid among the penicillinresistant isolates was determined by their plasmid profiles and further confirmation was carried out by a PCR based protocol. Our findings suggest that emergence of penicillin and ciprofloxacin resistance in N. gonorrhoeae isolates from a major STD center in India, indicates the need for the increased awareness and prudent use of antimicrobials.",

The mean maximum plasma concentration of linezolid was 12.1 mg/ ml and of ciprofloxacin 2.4 mg/ml. The cumulative renal excretion (mean) of parent drug was 40%/41% for linezolid/ciprofloxacin. UBTs were determined for a reference strain and five Gram-positive clinical uropathogens with the following MICs (mg/ml) for linezolid/ciprofloxacin: S. aureus ATCC 27278 (4/0.25), S. aureus (MSSA) (2/32), S. aureus (MRSA) (2/128), S. saprophyticus (MSSE) (2/0.5), E. faecalis (2/1), E. faecium (2/2). Results: Median UBTs measured within the first 6 h for linezolid were 1:96 for enterococcal strains and 1:128 to 1:256 for the four staphylococal strains. Median UBTs for ciprofloxacin were 1:64 for the two enterococcal strains, 1:384 to 1:512 for the two ciprofloxacin susceptible, 1:1.5 for the two resistant staphylococcal strains. Areas under the UBT \u00c1/time-curve showed statistically significant differences only for the two ciprofloxacin resistant staphylococcal strains in favour of linezolid. Conclusion: Linezolid exhibited the same bactericidal activity against ciprofloxacin resistant as susceptible strains.

Conclusions: Linezolid was highly active against Grampositive isolates. Resistance to teicoplanin was similar to other reported series. There was no emergence of resistance to linezolid. MRSA colonization is often a limiting factor for discharge from ICU. Clearance of MRSA is seldom achieved with conventional glycopeptide treatment. The oxazolidinone, linezolid, has excellent soft tissue and respiratory tract penetration and might be expected to eradicate carriage in some patients. We recently performed a doubleblind randomized trial in 204 ICU patients with known/suspected Gram positive infection. 100 received intravenous linezolid, 600 mg b.d., and 104 patients received teicoplanin 400 mg o.d.

Here we report the concentrations and penetration of LZD for bone, fat and muscle in comparison with cefamandole (CMD). Twelve patients received 600 mg LZD as a 20 min infusion and 1000 mg CMD as a bolus injection immediately before hip arthroplasty. Bone, fat, muscle and blood samples were collected at timed intervals after the infusion and assayed by a validated HPLC method. For bone, peak levels of both agents occurred 10 min after administration with mean levels of LZD 9.1 mg/kg versus CMD 17.5 mg/kg, decreasing to LZD 5.7 mg/kg versus CMD 9.7 mg/kg at 30 min. Correction for blood concentrations gave penetration of LZD 51% versus CMD 25% at 10 min and LZD 46% versus CMD 23% at 30 min. For fat and muscle, peak levels occurred 20 min after infusion. Mean levels were LZD 5.2 mg/kg versus CMD 10.9 mg/kg (fat) and LZD 13.4 mg/kg versus CMD 10.9 mg/kg (muscle). Correction for blood concentrations gave penetration of LZD 37% versus CMD 19% (fat) and LZD 95% versus CMD 31% (muscle). We conclude that linezolid exhibits rapid penetration into bone and associated soft tissues achieving levels in excess of the MIC for sensitive organisms; with a similar distribution and penetration profile to agents currently used for treatment of infections in these tissues.",

Frequently the disease has a severe course with multiple organ lesions. The early and adequate treatment is of extreme importance for the outcome of the disease. Searching an alternative antibiotic treatment of this disease we considered macrolides for their good cell and tissue penetration and dose-dependent bacteriostatic and bactericide effect. We treated 27 MSF patients with doxycycline 2)/100 mg/day, 25 patients with clarithromycin 2)/250 mg/day, as well as 25 patients with midecamycin 2)/400 mg/day and midecamycin acetate 30 mg/kg/day. As a surrogate marker for treatment evaluation the effect on the febrile syndrome was used. Our findings showed that by the 5th day of treatment the fever normalized in 89.47, 88.24 and 76.47% of the patients treated with doxycycline, clarithromycin and midecamycin, respectively. For the same period the patient fever decreased below 38 8C in 100, 100 and 94.12%, respectively. The intoxication symptoms were influenced within the same period equally in all treated patients. Conclusions: We suggest that the new macrolides appear a good alternative of tetracycline on patients with MSF.",

We report two cases of E. faecium bacteremia in which the responsible isolate was not sensitive to Q/D. The first patient was a woman with acute leukemia and septicemia. E. faecium was cultured from blood samples: the species was resistant to almost all antibiotics, exhibiting sensitivity only to tetracycline (!), while its sensitivity to Q/D was indermediate. The second patient was a man with endocarditis, in whom blood cultures isolated E. faecium sensitive to a number of antibiotics, including ciprofloxacin and vancomycin; still the sensitivity to Q/D was indermediate. Q/D has not been officially introduced to the antibiotic arsenal of Greek medicine. Moreover, the drug has never been used in our hospital, not even experimentally. Other E. faecium species isolated in our hospital have been sensitive to Q/D. How much hope can be put on a drug that seems to be partly useless before its initiation?

The elevated nitric oxide production is assumed to be responsible for the pathological changes in many inflammatory conditions, mainly via peroxynitrite, a potential oxidant that is produced by the reduction of superoxyde anion with nitric oxide. The intensity and the distribution of the immunohistochemical staining of intrahepatic inducible nitric oxide synthase were studied in the biopsy specimens obtained from 63 patients with viral hepatitis and 13 patients with elevated transaminase levels from other etiology. Hepatic inducible nitric oxide synthase staining was significantly more intense in the viral hepatitis group (P 0/0.000). Inducible nitric oxide synthase staining levels correlated well with the severity of the viral hepatitis using the Knodell's liver histological activity index (r0/0.393, P 0/0.002). Among the viral hepatitis group, the pathological distribution of the inducible nitric oxide synthase staining favored the periportal regions whereas less staining was observed in the bile duct and parenchyma regions. As nitric oxide mediated nitration of hepatocellular proteins is found to be elevated in the inflamed hepatic tissues and it well correlated with the severity of the disease, we suggest that inducible nitric oxide synthase can possibly have a critical role in the pathogenesis of chronic viral hepatitis.",

We reviewed our experience in a well established London family clinic with a team including community nurses. We reviewed the records of the 23 African immigrant children, aged 2 \u00c1/14, treated with anti-retrovirals exclusively at our centre throughout 2001. Whereas 14 had undetectable HIV RNA within the year, only four had undetectable RNA throughout the year. Four failed therapy through proven resistance mutations, but nine were considered through circumstantial evidence to have rising viral loads primarily because of poor adherence. Three were known to have stopped taking drugs for extended periods. The three boys over 11 years were unreliable in adherence, but the one girl in this age-group was fully adherent. Our preliminary assessment is that for the children in our families, despite a team approach and home visits, nonadherence to HAART may be twice as common as selection of a dominant viral mutant as a primary cause of failure to sustain viral suppression.",

However, it may occasionally cause a severe disease with high morbidity and mortality, and loss of school or business days. In a previous study, we have shown that every one of two to three school children from upper social classes living in Adana carries high risk of HAV infection. It is well known that maternally transmitted anti-HAV antibodies interfere with HAV vaccination. In an effort to determine the optimal age for HAV vaccination, 122 babies (52% girls and 48.5% boys) born in our hospital were prospectively followed up at least 24 months for the presence of maternal antibodies to hepatitis A (anti-HAV IgG). Anti-HAV IgG titers were measured from the blood specimens obtained at birth from the mothers and from the offsprings at months, 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21 and 24. The prevalence of positive anti-HAV at birth (95%) was similar to those of HAV seroprevalance studies carried out in adults in our area. The disappearance of antibodies occurred between the 1st and 21st month of life. The prevalence of anti-HAV IgG among children aged 0, 9, 12, 15, 18 and 21 months were 95, 60, 32, 9, 4 and 0%, respectively. In light of these findings, we suggest that hepatitis A vaccination be given after 21 months of age. Earlier vaccination may be ineffective due to interference with maternally transmitted anti-HAV antibodies.",

Department of Microbiology, Iran University, Tehran, Islamic Republic of Iran Diarrhoea is a major public health problem in developing countries. Amoebiasis is one of the most common causes of diarrhoea in Iran as an endemic area for amoebiasis. Little, however, is known about the extent of the condition in our society. The aim of this study is to determine socio-demographic and clinical characteristics of patients with intestinal amoebiasis. During July and August 2001, we collected 90 patients with diarrhoea among 5000 patients who visited at a referral hospital in Shahriar area (in countryside of Tehran), Iran. Thirty out of 90 patients (33%) had intestinal amoebiasis and were followed up prospectively until the resolution of the illness. Nineteen of 30 (63.3%) patients were male and the remaining of 36.7% was female. The patients were aged 1 \u00c1/76 with mean of 28.4 years. Most of the patients (70%) were below 30 years of age and the peak of occurrence was between the age of 17 and 26 years. Watery diarrhoea with abdominal cramps was the main clinical feature. Seventy percent of patients were resident in urban area and the remaining (30%) in rural area. Average family income was low and all patients were in low socioeconomic level. Water supplying system for all patients was pipeline water. Low socioeconomic level associated with poor personal hygiene was the most important factor for highly prevalence of this problem in our society. Also it seems that food plays important role in transmission of protozoa then water.",

Monitoring the changes in prevalence of particular alleles of genes coding for these proteins in local B. pertussis populations is an essential issue in cases of the observed decrease of vaccination effectiveness. We have developed a new method for allele identification of these genes, which eliminates the necessity of DNA sequencing. The approach is based on the identification of the number of repeats or the presence of specific nucleotides in the polymorphic regions or residues, respectively, of the genes and utilises products of their full or partial PCR amplification. The nucleotide heterogeneity in each polymorphic site is analysed either by the differential digestion of the amplicons or by the ARMS (amplification-refractory mutation system) methodology. Numbers of repeats in particular regions of the genes are revealed by the size analysis of the adequate PCR products or their restriction fragments. In all cases the presence, size or pattern of DNA molecules obtained is visualised by the agarose gel electrophoresis. The preliminary analysis of the recent and archival B. pertussis strains identified in Poland was performed using the described approach. The presented strategy provides a much easier, faster and more cost-effective than DNA sequencing mean to study the polymorphism of the major B. pertussis antigens.",

The date of vaccination was often late regarding recommendations. Fifteen students had no history of varicella. One student had not received BCG vaccination. Fifty-eight students had received two, and 14 three BCG vaccines. Post-BCG tuberculin skin testing was missing after 28 first BCG, 14 second and 3 third BCG. The date of the first tuberculin test was often one or several years after BCG vaccination. Adverse effects of vaccination were rarely reported: two cases of fever (DT polio, measles); three cases of local reaction (DT polio, DTP polio). One case of contraindication for influenza vaccine: egg allergy. The survey shows failure in immunization coverage actually recommended in health care students.

In addition, the data obtained were compared with of 5 years ago. With respect to the resistance rates to antibiotics of UTI pathogens, the resistance rates of E. coli for carbapenems, aminoglycosides and third generation cephalosporins were 1, 10 and 10%, respectively as before, but the rates for ampicillin increased from 67 to 75% and for TMP-SMX it increased from 49 to 61%.

Penicillin consumption increased from 1.8 to 3.8 DDDs/100 b \u00c1/d mostly due to amoxicillin. The overall aminoglycoside usage remained comparable (0.95 vs. 0.82 DDDs/100 b \u00c1/d) though amikacin has considerably replaced gentamicin. There was a sevenfold increase of ciprofloxacin (0.03 vs. 0.2 DDDs/100 b \u00c1/d) along with the evident decrease of tetracycline and co-trimoxazole consumption found (1.5 vs. 0.9 DDDs/ 100 b \u00c1/d and 0.8 vs. 0.1 DDDs/100 b \u00c1/d, respectively).

Fifty-two patients older than 18 years of age with diagnosed chronic Chlamydial prostatitis were enrolled. The presence of CT in expressed prostatic secretion or urine specimen voided immediately after prostatic massage was confirmed by isolation on McCoy cells and Lugol staining. The majority of patients suffered from suprapubic pain and pain in the groin. Twelve patients had no clinical symptoms. According to rectal palpation, prostate gland was normal in 35 patients, tender and soft in 12 and firm in five patients. Clarithromycin was administered orally 500 mg twice daily for 14 days. Simultaneously the patients' partners received 500 mg orally twice daily for 7 days. Clinical efficacy and tolerability of administered clarithromycin were evaluated 1 \u00c1/7 days and 4 \u00c1/6 weeks after the end of treatment. Bactericidal efficacy of administered drug was evaluated 4 \u00c1/6 weeks after the end of treatment. The eradication of CT was achieved in 30 out of 40 patients, while 28 patients were clinically cured. Two patients had nausea and elevated serum transaminases. In asymptomatic patients, the eradication of CT was achieved in 10 of 12 patients who reported no side effects. This pilot study has shown an excellent efficacy and tolerability of clarithromycin in the treatment of patients with chronic Chlamydial prostatitis. Women with diagnosis of urinary tract infections (UTI) often demonstrate vaginal colonisation with alpha-haemolytic Escherichia coli strains. In the present study we decided to evaluate a distribution of virulence genes encoding for cytotoxic necrotizing factor type 1 (cnf1), P-fimbriae, S/F1C-fimbriae aerobactin (aer), and afa genes in alpha-haemolytic E. coli strains isolated from gynaecological material in our region and to compare the detected sequences in clinical isolates of other diagnostic groups. Of 127 alpha-haemolytic E. coli strains, 41 were isolated from urine, 44 from gynaecological specimen, and 42 were faecal strains. E. coli strains were tested for the production of haemolytic phenotype on blood agar plates. The amplification of virulence factors was performed by PCR according to previously described protocols (Le Bouguenec et al., 1992; Blanco et al., 1996; and Yamamoto et al., 1995) . We found that all gynaecological alphahaemolytic strains were positive for cnf1, (P B/0.001 compared to 78% of urine strains, and P B/0.0001 compared to 61% of faecal strains). Similarly, sfa/foc specific DNA sequences were found in 100% of gynaecological isolates (P0/0.01 compared to 85% of urine strains and P 0/0.005 compared to 83% of faecal strains). From this point of view, the female genital tract seems to be a potential reservoir of these uropathogenic E. coli strains.",

The sensitivity and negative predictive values of AFFIRM test and clinical signs were same (100%) in identifying of bacterial vaginosis. However, AFFIRM test was more specific (94 vs 72%) and also has higher positive predictive value (80 vs 53%) than clinical signs. We did not evaluate the results for patients with candidiasis because of less number.",

P. aeruginosa strains showed better susceptibility to tested parenteral antibiotics than to antibiotics for oral use which complicated treatment in outpatients. The best susceptibility was shown to imipenem, but this drug is inappropriate for use in outpatients setting, so the best choice for treatment P. aeruginosa UTI in our outpatients is treatment with ceftazidime, and the second choices are aminoglycoside drugs amikacin and netilmicin.",

In patients with a urinary catherer, the combination achieved a higher complete bacterial elimination rate /50%/ and clinical efficacy rate / 84%/ than CPF alone /30 and 61.5%, respectively/. While no significant difference was found in the bacterial elimination rate between the two groups, the clinical effect of the combination /40%/ was superior to that of CPF alone /23%/ in patients with an indwelling catherer. The better clinical efficacy of the combination may partly be attributed to the antibiofilm effect of CAM in the clinical setting. The results also indicated that difficulties still remain in the treatment of CUTI in patients with an indwelling catherer.

The most common site of involvement is the sacroiliac joint. The osteoarticular complications such as, sacroiliitis and spondylitis are diagnosed with radiologically. In the present study, we aimed to determine the severity (grade) of sacroiliitis by using some laboratory parameters such as ESR, CRP and tube agg test. Seventy-two (34 male, 38 female) patients with Brucellosis were included in the study. Osteoarticular involvement was present in 44 patients. The most common osteoarticular finding was sacroiliitis in the patients (86%). Twenty (20) healthy subjects were formed the control group. There was statistically significant difference between patients and controls regarding ESR, CRP, and tube agg test (P 0/0.000, 0.0017, 0.000, respectively). In addition, sacroiliitis has an effect on ESR and CRP. There was a positive correlation between the grade of sacroiliitis and the value of CRP (P0/0.006, r 0/0.414). In conclusion, it has been suggested that, CRP may be used as an auxiliary or a secondary parameter in grading sacroiliac joint involvement in Brucellosis.",

First Medical Department, 'Saint George ' General Hospital, Chania, Greece A severe frontal and/or retroorbital headache represents the most common neurologic manifestation of murine typhus. Other neurologic manifestations as confusion, stupor, nuchal rigidity and in severe cases delirium, extreme agitation or coma appear less commonly. Eightyfour patients with compatible clinical status of murine typhus and high serological titers of antibodies against Rickettsia typhi, were studied from our team. Seventy-four patients (88%) presented headache and nine patients (11%) presented confusion. One patient (1.1%) presented nuchal rigidity in combination with severe headache and confusion giving us the suspicion of meningitis. In this case a lumbar puncture was performed emergently and the cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) was examined. The findings of CSF were proteins: 9 mg/dl, WBC: 16/ml and glucose: 73 mg/dl and its culture was negative. All patients were treated with a specific anti-rickettsial treatment. The outcome of murine typhus was favorable for all 84 patients (100%). No one patient presented neurologic sequelae. Conjunctivitis usually accompany rickettsial diseases such as Rocky Mountain spotted fever, epidemic typhus and murine typhus. Eightythree patients with compatible clinical status of murine typhus and high serological titers of antibodies against Rickettsia typhi , were studied from our team, during a period of time between January 1993 and the first semester of 1998. The clinical examination of these patients revealed the presence of conjunctivitis in 21/83 patients (25.6%). In the same time these patients referred retroocular pain and mild photophobia. This study showed that in murine typhus the injection of conjunctivae is rather common. Almost a quarter of the patients presented conjunctivitis despite the fact, that this ocular manifestation is less severe than in other typhus and spotted fevers. Eighty-three patients with compatible clinical status of murine typhus and high serological titers of antibodies against Rickettsia typhi , were studied from our team, during a period of time between January 1993 and the first semester of 1998. Three blood samples were obtained from each patient for the study of their hematological abnormalities. The first sample was obtained on admission, the second sample 2 weeks after the first, the third sample, 1 month after the second. On admission 26/83 patients (31%) presented anemia, 6/83 patients (7%) presented leukopenia and 42/83 patients (51%) presented thrombocytopenia. The mean value of hematocrit, white blood cells and platelets was 12.4 g/dl, 6.1)/10 3 and 147)/10 3 /ml, respectively. Two weeks later anemia was presented in 45/83 patients (54%), 3/83 patients (4%) presented leukopenia, 3/83 patients (4%) presented leucocytosis and 15/83 patients (18%) presented thrombocytopenia. The mean value of hematocrit, white blood cells and platelets was 11.3 g/dl, 7.0)/10 3 and 248)/10 3 /ml, respectively. One month later 11/42 patients (26%) had anemia and 2/42 patients (5%) presented thrombocytopenia. The mean value of hematocrit, white blood cells and platelets was 12.4 g/dl, 6.4)/10 3 and 242)/10 3 /ml, respectively. Our study showed that early thrombocytopenia and anemia are frequent in murine typhus and that white blood cells count is usually normal.",

Advanced age and prolonged interval before administration of a specific anti-rickettsial treatment are correlated with severity of the disease. Renal function in murine typhus is usually unaltered except in elderly patients with prolonged hypotension. Eighty-three patients with compatible clinical status of murine typhus and high serological titres of antibodies against Rickettsia typhi, were studied from our team, during a period of time between January 1993 and the first semester of 1998. Three blood samples were obtained from each patient for the study of their renal function. The first sample was obtained on admission, the second sample approximately 2 weeks after the first, the third sample, taken from the half of the patients, was obtained one month after the second. On admission 4/83 patients (5.0%) presented acute renal failure. The outcome of murine typhus was favourable for all 83 patients (100%). The four patients who presented acute renal failure reversed after the administration of anti-rickettsial treatment and careful administration of fluids. In murine typhus the induction of hypovolaemia insufficiently corrected by normal homeostatic mechanisms may lead to prerenal azotaemia. In these cases the immediate onset of an antirickettsial treatment and the correction of hypovolaemia are essential for the rapid clinical improvement of the patient.",

Fifty-eight patients were clinically assessed for signs and symptoms of streptococcal infection. Laboratory confirma-tion was sought using three tests; culture, rapid Strepto Test and estimation of antistreptolysin (ASO). One or more tests were done in 47 of the 58 patients. Treatment was for 5 days, 25 mg/kg per day in children, 500 mg per day in adolescents. Patients were again clinically assessed on the 5th \u00c1/6th day. The results showed clinical success in 56 patients (96.5%) and in 46 of the 47 who had laboratory tests (97.8%). Two patients had treatment withdrawn because of nausea and abdominal pain (3.5%). Of the 47 patients with laboratory tests at least one test was ositive. The most helpful was the Strepto Test giving the quickest positive result in 92% of those tested (38/41). Culture was positive in 58% of those tested (24/41). The ASO test was of limited value.

Five patients were identified with the diagnosis of CCNF. Ages ranged from 33 to 71 years; there were three women and two men. Dental infection was the most common source of CCNF in 90%. One patient had acute tonsillitis leading to CCNF. All cases studied experienced infection of the neck with spread into the submandibular, submental, sublingual, retropharyngeal, and parapharyngeal spaces. All infections were polymicrobial. Diabetes mellitus was a co-morbidity in one case. All pts were treated with dual antibiotic coverage (vancomycin'/meropenem), rHuGM-CSF (10 mcg/kg/daily given s.c.) and aggressive wound care. rHuGM-CSF was given for 7 \u00c1/10 days. In spite of the severity of the infection all pts recovered and do not experienced local or systemic complications. Discussion: CCNF is a severe bacterial infection of the cervical fascia resulting in extensive fascial necrosis with widespread undermining of the surrounding tissues. Prompt antibiotic therapy combined with rHuGM-CSF resulted in a 100% overall survival in our experience. To our knowledge, this is the first report describing the successful treatment of CCNF with use of broad-spectrum antibiotics combined with rHuGM-CSF. The following case adds to the clinical manifestations and course of meningococcal disease. A previously healthy 3-year-old girl presented acutely with high fever purpuric rash including conjuctival haemorrhages and hypotension. The child had also neck stiffness. A presumptive diagnosis of meningococcal septicaemia was made and treatment with penicilline, chloramphenicole, fluids and inotropes was initiated. Laboratory investigations showed WBC: 4300/ml, Hb: 12.2 g/dl, Hct: 39.5%, ESR: 1 mm in the first hour, PT: 26 s, APTT: 90 s. Neisseria meningitidis Group B was isolated from the blood cultures. CSF obtained after antibiotics were started did not grow N. meningitidis . The patient had an adverse outcome. She died after 12 h of hospitalization. This patient developed a fulminating meningococcal septicaemia. Shock is a clinical diagnosis arising from the failure of compensatory mechanisms that maintain perfusion of vital organs at the expense of non vital. Septic shock results from loss of circulating plasma volume due to increased vascular permeability and maldistribution of intravascular volume. In young children there is a prevalence of serogroup B meningococcal disease which can be explained by the immaturity of the immune system and by the fact the group B capsule synthesis is known to inhibit alternative complement pathway activation. This case emphasizes the need for further protection against N. meningitidis group B. . Results: Forty-eight patients were included in this study. The etiological agents were: viral (n 0/26, 54.2%, mean ('x ) age0/28 years), Streptococcus pneumoniae (n 0/8, 16.6%,'x age0/53), Neisseria meningitidis (n0/7, 14.6%, 'x age0/28), S. viridans (n0/6, 12%, 'x age0/34), P. multocida (n0/1, age 75). The peak incidence of bacterial meningitis was in winter (pneumococcal 73%, meningococcal 86%, s. viridans 83%) .The cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) findings in viral meningitis were 'x white cells 0/340/mm 3 , 'x PMN0/27%, 'x glucose CSF/ serum 0.55, 'x protein 39 mg/dl and in bacterial meningitis were 'x white cells0/5800/mm 3 , 'x PMN0/80%, 'x glucose CSF/ serum0/ 0.2, 'x protein0/350 mg/dl, Gram stain was positive in 55%, culture was positive in 45%. All pneumococcal and meningococcal strains were susceptible to penicillin. The case fatality rates for pneumococcal and meningococcal meningitis were 25 and 14.3%, respectively. Conclusions: The cases of bacterial meningitis were according to typical epidemiological features of age and season. The case fatality rate of pneumococcal meningitis appear to be high regardless of susceptibility to penicillin. None had received pneumococcal vaccine prior to becoming ill.",

To investigate the anti-tuberculosis drug resistance pattern of pulmonary tuberculosis isolates in southern Taiwan, an area with higher tuberculosis incidence and mortality than other regions of the island, we performed a hospital-based surveillance at a southern Taiwan medical center from 1996 to 2000. The combined drug resistance rates to at least one of five first-line agents was 84.8%, and to both isoniazid and rifampin (multi-drug resistance, MDR) was 11.4%, indicating high resistance rates compared with those reported in the WHO/IUATLD global project and in northern Taiwan. The resistance rates to two second-line drugs, cycloserine, and kanamycin, were 75.7 and 23.7%, respectively. A significant decreasing trend in resistance rates to all drugs except streptomycin was observed during the 5-year period. Though combined drug resistance rate may not be the most accurate tool as it includes previously treated cases which inflates the resistance rate, the observation of trends in the susceptibility of pulmonary tuberculosis in accompany with the increasing percentages of tuberculosis patients receiving complete treatment course and the decreasing percentages of cases lost of follow-up in Kaohsiung after the institution of new governmental regulations for case management in 1997 suggest the usefulness of intervention programs.",

We report the in-vitro activity of this compound in combination with ceftazidime, cefsulodin, fosfomycin, piperacillin/tazobactam, aztreonam, ciprofloxacin and timentin. Drug combinations were evaluated against 20 Burkholderia cepacia strains, and 20 Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains isolated from patients with cystic fibrosis. For this purpose a chequerboard technique was adopted using doubling dilutions of each antibiotic incorporated into a highly defined agar medium free of antagonists. The minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) and fractional inhibitory concentrations (FICs) of all the antibiotic combinations were determined which revealed the antibiotic interaction occurring. Alafosfalin in combination with ceftazidime, meropenem, piperacillin/tazobactam and timentin demonstrated the highest percentages of synergy in both B. cepacia and P. aeruginosa . Synergy was shown to occur in 15, 15, 10 and 10% of B. cepacia strains respectively, and in 10, 5, 5 and 5% of P. aeruginosa strains.

Haemophilus influenzae and Streptococcus pneumoniae are the most frequent isolates, Gramnegative bacilli account for the severe cases, aggravating the inflammatory process in the airways eventually leading to respiratory insufficiency. The aim of this ongoing placebo controlled, parallel group, mono center study trial is to evaluate beneficial effect of cefixim to reduce bacterial load and pulmonary inflammation in patients (n0/ 30) with acute bacterial exacerbation of severe COPD. Thus, 30 patients received in randomized fashion either Cefixim (400 mg/day) or placebo (5 days). On days 1, 2, 5 and 8 breath condensate is collected using 'EcoScreen' (Jaeger Germany) for LTB4-, IL-8-, Nitrite-and PH-analysis. In parallel sputum gathered for detection of bacterial strains, and for LTB4-, and IL-8 quantification purposes. These data are compared to clinical outcome parameters such as lung function tests, radiographic findings, serum inflammatory markers and length of hospital stay. The preliminary data obtained confirm successful antibiotic therapy with oral Cefixim in bacterial related acute exacerbations of COPD is a useful approach to reduce bacterial load, and concomitantly lower inflammatory indices of the central and peripheral airways leading to clinical improvement of the patients.",

Assessments were made during therapy (day 3 \u00c1/5), after End of Therapy (EOT, day 12 \u00c1/14) and Follow Up (FU, day 38 \u00c1/46). The primary efficacy endpoint was the clinical response at EOT defined as success (cure/improvement) or failure. Both regimens were well tolerated; one or more drug-related adverse events (AEs) were reported in 17.2% (11/64) of bid patients and in 21.7% (13/60) of tid patients. The most frequently reported drugrelated AEs in each group were gastrointestinal symptoms (bid 11.5% vs. tid 13.5%), which were mainly of mild or moderate severity. Both regimens were clinically equivalent. The higher cure rates in the bid group suggest a possible higher benefit from bid therapy in children 5/ 2 years. Children attending family day-care (FDC) should be less exposed to upper respiratory tract infections than those in group day-care (GDC) and therefore to antibiotic treatment; fewer should thus carry resistant bacteria. To test this hypothesis, NP carriage of SP and HI with reduced susceptibility to penicillin (PDSP and HI BL'/, respectively) was investigated among children in FDC (maximum three children) and in GDC (25 \u00c1/100 children) in the Alpes Maritimes (France) between November 1999 and March 2000. A two stage cluster sample of children attending GDC or FDC was selected. NP samples were cultured for SP and HI. Penicillin susceptibility was tested by disk diffusion and E -test, and b-lactamase production by API-NH \u2020 tests (BioMerieux, Lyon). Two hundred and thirty-five children in FDC and 298 in GDC aged 6 \u00c1/36 months were sampled. Age and sex distribution were similar in both groups. SP was isolated in 80 children in FDC (34%), and in 163 (54.7%) children in GDC (P B/10 \u00c1/6 ). Proportions of PDSP were 52.5 and 55.8%, respectively (P0/0.6). HI was present in 37.6% of children in GDC vs. 23.8% in FDC (P B/ 0.001). Proportions of HI BL'/ were 40.2% vs. 46.4%, respectively (P0/0.4). Antibiotic exposure during the previous 3 months concerned 46.2% of children in GDC vs. 48.7% in FDC (P 0/0.6). There was no correlation between antibiotic use and carriage of PDSP or HI B'/ strains. SP and HI carriage rates are significantly lower among children in FDC than in GDC. Advising alternative types of daycare for children attending GDC should reduce exposure and thus limit the spread of resistant bacteria. However, the proportion of PDSP and HI BL'/ is similar in both groups and comparable patterns of antibiotic use are observed. Continued efforts must concentrate on parental education and enforcement of recommendations for management of pediatric upper respiratory tract infections. During a period between January 1999 and August 2001, 43 invasive Haemophilus influenzae (Hi) isolates had been collected at the Children's Hospital of Tunis. We used Haemophilus Test Medium to test antibiotic susceptibility. The MIC of beta-lactams was measured by E -test. Beta-lactamase production was determined by using the cefinase test and biotyping by ApiNH. Presence of capsular antigen was determined by using Hi typing anti sera. Hi strains were isolated from meningitidis (35), bacteremia (5) and arthritis (3). All strains were serotype b and 62.2% of them belonged to biotypes I and II. Amoxicillin resistance with beta-lactamase producing mechanism occured in 34.8%. MIC90 of beta-lactamase producing strains was 32 vs 0.5 mg/l in non-producing one. There is no betalactamasenegative amoxicillin resistant among these invasive isolates. Antibiotic resistance concerned chloramphenicol: 9.3%, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole: 11.6%, tetracycline: 4.6% and kanamycin: 11.6%. Invasive Hi infections in tunisian children's were always associated with type b strains. Introduction of a Hib vaccine programme in Tunisia is recommended.",

Results: Medical records of 63 patients who were admitted to the PICU and had a documented BSI were reviewed. There were 74 separate episodes of BSI's, with nine patients having multiple BSI's during their hospital stay. A casecontrol model was used. Cases were BSI's with eventual mortality (N0/27; 36.5%) and controls were those who survived BSI (N0/47; 63.5%). Patients who died were older (5.7 vs. 2.4 years; PB/ 0.01), more likely to have a nosocomial BSI (42.9 vs. 16.7%; PB/ 0.05), longer hospitalization prior to BSI (30.5 vs. 9.8 days; PB/ 0.05), and have a polymicrobial BSI (66.7 vs. 30.6%; PB/ 0.05).

Pavlenishvili, G, Iobashvili Tbilisi, Medical Academy Georgian Society of pediatrics Chemotherapy (GSPC) with collaborations of Drug and Therapeutic Committee (DTC) of Childers hospital 'Republic' finished the observation study about nosocomial infections of Neonatal ICU in above mentioned hospital. Study begins from November 2000. During this period we observe 45 cases of neonatal sepsis, most of them were due gram-negative bacteria. Thirty-four cases of neonatal sepsis were cause different stains of Escherichia coli , Proteus spp. and Acinetobacter . We notice that during last 2 years the role of Acinetobacter in etiology of neonatal sepsis and nosocomial complications of neonatal sepsis in our hospital is gradually increased. As our observation reveals most optimal in the case of complicated neonatal sepsis was (according criteria of DTS) use of Ceftasidime. Almost in all cases we used Ceftasidime with success. We have only one case of mortality. Since the macrolide resistance (MR) in Streptococcus pyogenes has been increasing in Europe, we studied the incidence and genetic basis of MR in S. pyogenes in Russia. S. pyogenes isolated at baseline and during follow-up visits from children with acute pharyngitis receiving penicillin or midecamycin (16-membered macrolide) were studied. MR was evaluated by agar dilution (NCCLS), resistance mechanisms */by PCR. A total of 149 S. pyogenes were obtained at the baseline, 21 (14%) of which were erythromycin-resistant: 19 strains (90%) were erm (A)-positive, one */mef (A)-positive, and one was negative for all primers used. All erm (A)-strains were inducibly resistant to clindamycin and represented seven PFGE profiles with one profile found in 11/ 19 strains. In three midecamycin treated patients MR was selected during the therapy (one strain had erm (A), one */mef (A), one */ unknown resistance determinant). mef (A)-strain obtained during follow-up visit had different PFGE pattern with mef (A) strain isolated at baseline, while both the baseline and follow-up strains with unknown mechanism of resistance had unique PFGE pattern. These data showed moderate incidence of erythromycin-resistant S. pyogenes in Smolensk. Ribosomal methylation (erm (A)) was the most common mechanism and though the polyclonal nature of MR was established, most erm (A)-strains belonged to only a few clones.",

All patients presented inferior members open fractures, frequently contaminated with telluric material and requiring external fixators. Genomic study of clinical isolates by pulsed field gel electrophoresis and Random analysis polymorphic DNA, allowed us to eliminate an outbreak. Furthermore, the reduced delay in which patients developed the infection (6 days'//-2) led us to re-evaluate the procotols used in our institution. Indeed, all patients had received amoxycillin '/ clavulanate IV 2g for antibioprophylaxis during anesthetical induction then relayed per os for 48 hours. Because of the production of a potent beta-lactamase by the bacteria, this association could not be efficient. Furthermore, accordingly to the AFNOR EN 1040 norm, we have tested clinical isolates' sensitivity to the principal antiseptics used for antisepsis and disinfection (iodophors, chloride derivated and biguanidines) and observed a major resistance of all strains tested. Even if these postoperative wound infections are considered as nosocomial because of the delay in appearance, we actually think that Bacillus cereus were initially present in telluric material. This fact led us to propose a systematic screening for Bacillus at admission for this type of wound and to administrate quinolones such as ciprofloxacin for prophylaxis.",

We now report that reactive oxygen species (ROS) are involved in the killing effect of hLF(1-11). Since internal thiols protect cells from oxidative damage, our observation that hLF(1-11) caused a 20% reduction of internal thiols in Candida is of interest. As expected, N-acetyl-L-cysteine (NAC), which is a precursor of glutathione and a ROS scavenger, inhibited the killing effect of hLF(1-11). Diamide, which oxidizes internal thiols, was candidacidal and hLF(1-11) and diamide acted synergistically in killing C. albicans and ROS production. Moreover, the hLF(1-11)-induced activation of mitochondria was inhibited by NAC, indicating that internal thiols/ROS affect mitochondrial activity.",

It usually occurs in diabetics or immunocompromised patients. The emergency physician will typically see patients with RCZ in its earliest stages masquerading as a variety of other less serious diseases. The key markers like necrotic patch on hard palate, nasal septum or turbinate, marked facial pain, and cellulites with marked eye and neurological signs may present late in disease. We report a case of RCZ caused by Rhizopus arrhizus [oryzae] in an 84 year old woman with poorly controlled diabetes. She presented with a right-sided facial droop of short origin and being generally unwell. CT scan was non-conclusive and delayed presentation of key markers of RCZ permitted disease to rapidly progress.

A 23F Streptococcus pneumoniae strain exhibiting a MIC of A/C and ERY of 1/0.5 and 0.12 mg/l, respectively, was used. Both antibiotics were tested at 2.5 and 10 mg/kg. Acetaminophen at 50 mg/kg was administered 30 min before each antibiotic dose. Antibiotic concentrations in serum and middle ear exudate were determined. Both antibiotics significantly reduced the number of culture-positive ears and colony counts, with serum concentrations over the MIC of the microorganism for ]/15% of the dosing interval. Antibiotic concentrations in middle ear exudate were almost identical in animals receiving and not receiving acetaminophen. Clinical and microbiological efficacy was correlated with antibiotic concentrations in middle ear exudate ]/1.7 times the MIC of the microorganism, for both antibiotics. Both antibiotics demonstrated efficacy in the treatment of pneumococcal AOM, with the same rate of OME.

For the first time, the structural and electronic features needed for their recognition by transpeptidase have been fully described, using innovative molecular modelling techniques to compare the conformational forms adopted by cell-wall peptides and blactams. Comparison of features in the backbone and C-terminal regions of conformers of active b-lactam antibiotics and model cellwall peptides, has allowed definition of the molecular recognition template required for substrate recognition by transpeptidase. These shared structural features allow both to act as substrates and to acylate the active-site serine. However, a significant difference in a critical backbone torsion between the two substrates, provides an explanation for the inability of the enzyme \u00c1/antibiotic complex to undergo the deacylation step that causes inhibition of transpeptidase. On the other hand, b-lactamases appear to have evolved molecular mechanisms that facilitate the deacylation reaction through compensating for the altered structural orientations in b-lactams caused by the different backbone torsion. Finally, analysis of the conformer repertoires of blactams for structural features required for substrate uptake by peptide transporters, provides insights into how their structures can be tailored for optimal oral absorption.",

The DDT seems to be a practical method for ESBL-screening; ATB-BLSE method is more sensitive. Our study display to be the first report of ESBL-producing A. baumanii strains from our country. Carbapenems seems to be the most active agents against A. baumanii . Salmonella infantis , strain 111, was isolated from a newborn baby at Wassila Bourguiba Maternity in Tunis. It exhibited high resistance to penicillins, extended-spectrum cephalosporines (cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, ceftazidime, cefpirome) and aztreonam but remained susceptible to cefoxitine and imipenem. Involvement and characterization of enzymatic mechanism in b-lactam resistance were investigated in strain 111. Isoelectricfocusing revealed that this strain produced a b-lactamase of pI 6. This enzyme had a broad-substrate profile, hydrolyzing amoxicillin, ampicillin, ticarcillin, cephaloridine, cefuroxime, cefotaxime, ceftriaxone, cefpirome and ceftazidime. The highest specific activity was observed with ampicillin. Cefotaxime was hydrolyzed the most efficiently of the extended-spectum cephalosporines. The pI 6 extended-spectrum b-lactamase (ESBL) was inhibited by clavulanic acid and sulbactam. No inhibition of the ESBL was observed with 1 mM EDTA. Thus, no metal ion is involved in hydrolysis for this b-lactamase. Resistance due to the production of the pI 6 ESBL was transferred with DNA plasmid into Escherichia coli . On the basis of substrate and inhibition profiles and isoelectric point, the pI 6 ESBL was not previously described in S. infantis in Tunisia. The presence of such a resistance on a plasmid raises concer for rapid dissemination among bacteria and loss of effectiveness of blactams.",

A total of 764 consecutive patients with chronic HCV viremia were studied and followed-up over a mean period of 5.1 years: 172 (22.5%) were infected with HTLV-I infection and 592 (77.5%) were not. The results obtained the annual HCC development rate was 3.4% in patients co-infected with HCV and HTLV-I and 1.4% in patients infected with HCV alone. HCC was significantly higher in 33 (19.2%) of the 172 patients co-infected patients than in 39 (6.6%) of the 592 patients infected with HCV alone (P B/ 0.001, Logrank test). In patients under the age of 55 years, HCC development was significantly higher in seven (17.1%) of 19 patients co-infected with HCV and HTLV-I than in eight (2.9%) of 220 patients with HCV alone (PB/ 0.05, Logrank test), whereas there was no significant difference in HCC development between patients over age 55 with or without HTLV-I infection (26 (2.0%) of 131 and 31 (9.9%) of 312, respectively). The conclusion reached HTLV-I infection accelerates the development of HCC in chronic HCV patients, especially among patients under the age of 55 years. To analyze HBV genotype-related clinical differences among patients with chronic HBV infection, all 158 patients were serially tested for serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and hepatitis B e antigen (HBeAg) and followed up for a mean 10.8 (6.4) year period. Genotypes B and C were found in 58 (36.7%) and 100 (63.3%) of the patients, respectively. HBeAg positivity and ALT abnormality rates at the start of the observation period were significantly higher in genotype C patients (66.0 and 84.0%) than in genotype B patients (34.5 and 22.4%). The annual rate of spontaneous HBeAg disappearance in genotype B patients was much higher than in genotype C patients (8.38 versus 2.34%, respectively). Patients with genotype C who were continuously HBeAg negative from entry had significantly higher ALT abnormality (58.8%) than those with genotype B (19.2%). Interestingly, patients with genotype C who became HBeAg negative by interferon treatment had high ALT abnormality (58.8%). All patients with ALT abnormality were serum HBV DNA positive. These findings indicate that HBV genotype C patients are more severe liver deterioration because of the delay of HBeAg disappearance and continued HBV replication after HBeAg disappearance.",

The aim of this study is to investigate the influence of molecular structure of macrocyclic pyridinophanes and their analogs on antiinfluenza and antiherpetic activity of these compounds. We used 4D-QSAR approaches on the basis of simple representation of molecular structure. Such representation for biologically active substances allows the description of the spatial structure of compounds with the complete stereochemical information. It determines spatial structures either promoting or interfering of the concrete biological activity. It is easy to realize the molecular design of compounds with the given level of activity with the help of the combinations of simplexes. Statistic characteristics for QSAR of Partial Least-Squares models are satisfactory (R0/0.92 \u00c1/0.97; CVR0/0.76 \u00c1/0.86). The molecular fragments that increase the antiviral activity were defined and will be demonstrated. This information was used for design and directed synthesis of several novel antiviral agents with predicted high anti-influenza or antiherpetic activities. Predicted activities were confirmed experimentally. 4D-QSAR approaches are useful for development of antiviral compounds.

E-ACA brings down proteolytic cleavage of HA-precursor to HA-1 and HA-polypeptides and reduces the infectious virus harvest. It shows the prophylactic and therapeutic action during the experimental influenza reducing the enhancement of alkaline proteases activity in lungs after infection. E-ACA promotes the intensification of specific antibodies production and cell immunity, prevents vessels' permeability and hemorrhagic phenomena, decreases the destruction of bronchi's epithelium. It reduces the duration of intoxication, catarrhal instances and hyperthermia in sick children. E-ACA improves the indexes of immunity, non-specific resistance and decreases the rate of bacterial complications. Application of E-ACA for treatment influenza and other ARVI in children is recommended in Ukraine on the base of results of our researches. The higher effects demonstrated as a result of combine usage of E-ACA with specific Ig, or Deitiforin, or Unithyol, or Ribavirin.

There was no huge difference in eythema and oedema scorings between studied groups, however in the group treated with denotivir, in contrast to others, no vesicles developed. Several clinical studies showed usefulness of denotivir in controlling herpetic infections in dermatology, ophthalmology and otolaryngology. In the majority of studies within few hours after the drug application itch and pain relief was noted and within 1 \u00c1/2 days the vesicular lesions were dried up.",

The major clone was defined as the most numerous of 10 analyzed clones, and observation periods ranged from 8 to 32 months (mean, 19.89/10.2 months). In five patients (one with primary-stage HIV-1 infection) receiving three antiretroviral drugs, HIV-1 RNA levels reduced to undetectable (i.e. B/100 copies/ml). HIV-1 proviral DNA levels and the number of major clones reduced in four of these patients. HIV-1 RNA levels reduced, but remained detectable, in five other patients. In the two remaining patients (both receiving two rather than three antiretroviral drugs) HIV-1 RNA levels increased.

The fluconazole sensitivities were also determined by the E -test. On the basis of the Fungitest data the three C. norvegensis isolates were sensitive to flucytosine, amphotericin B, and also to ketoconazole. In case of fluconazole and miconazole they proved to be susceptible dependent upon dose. The MIC fluconazole values determined by the E -test for the three C. norvegensis isolates were 96, ]/256 and ]/256 mg/ml, respectively.

Novosibirsk State Medical Academy, Dermatovenerology, Novosibirsk, Russian Federation At the present stage in Russia with a background of a high case rate of syphilis, it becomes necessary to exclude biological false positive serological tests. Because the serodiagnosis of syphilis has significant limitations, the direct detection of T. pallidum in suspect blood may serve as an alternate diagnostic strategy. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) has been the most widely used amplification method. The study of 56 patients receiving examination related and treatment for syphilis in STD clinic and persons directed from other hospitals where routine serologic examination revealed doubtful results. PCR reaction was carried out with nested primer pairs based on the DNA sequence of the 47 \u00c1/1 and 47 \u00c1/2 kDa gene of T. pallidum . PCR was utilized with whole blood. A complex of serological tests: FTA-abs and TIT was used as the &rdqup; gold standard''. As a result the sensitivity of PCR was 91.2% and specificity was 90.9%. Selective comparison of PCR results with VDRL, the FTA-abs and treponemal immobilisation test (TIT) has shown concurrence 96.8%. In conclusion, the preliminary results of PCR in whole blood in syphilis detection revealed its high sensitivity and specificity; possibility to obtain rapid results in unclear cases. Chlamydia pneumoniae (Cp) is an atypical pathogen whit intracellular location, whose eradication is very difficult. In the past years it has been objects of many studies that lead to the demonstration of a relationship between its presence and the development of widespread multifactorial pathologies such as atherosclerosis and asthma. The lack of its eradication can become an important clinical and social problem. The study objective is the comprehension of pathogen \u00c1/host interaction mechanism, to characterize therapeutics protocols that cold lead to complete eradication of Cp from organism. The research had been principally made on the studying the molecular mechanisms that are at the root of pathogen permanence inside host cell. Using proliferation and apoptosis tests we underlined a different behaviour of infected cells towards control cells. In presence of P1 (20 mg/ml), i.e. a peptide that can inhibit the proliferation and induce apoptosis in vitro inhibiting NF-kB, uninfected cells proliferation decreased of 35% in comparison whit the controls, while the one of infected decreased only of about 15%. Moreover, using various apoptosis-inducers, the infected cells showing apoptosis were about 10% while the uninfected were about 40%. The caspace III activity increased significantly in uninfected cells. In conclusion, Cp could delay its elimination from the host inhibiting the apoptosis via NF-kB activation.",

Twenty-five blood samples were taken for analysis from patients with infective endocarditis. IE was diagnosed according to Duke criteria including positive blood cultures. Suspicion of fungal superinfection was established on serological investigation in five patients, confirmed by blood culture in two patients. Control group consisted of 15 patients without infection. DNA was isolated using the commercially available S.N.A.P. kit. Amplification products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis stained with ethidium bromide. The results obtained: fungal DNA was found in two patients with fungal superinfection of bacterial IE confirmed by culture. In the remaining patients with IE and controls no fungal DNA was found. The conclusion reached: Broad-range fungal PCR is a fast and inexpensive tool for the detection of fungal DNA, but it is more prone to contamination than species-specific PCR.

Methods: PCR screening for integrons of 105 clinical urinary tract isolates was performed. Isolates were tested for resistance to 12 antibiotics. Integrons in 14 isolates were sequenced. Results: Integrons of class 1 were found in 43 isolates and class 2 integrons were found in 10. Eight isolates in the study were resistant to five antibiotics or more and not shown to carry any integron. Nineteen of 69 isolates resistant to trimethoprim did not carry integrons. Only one of these isolates was shown to carry sul1 and is thus probably also carrying an integron. None of the 19 isolates were shown to carry dfr8 , one of five trimethoprim resistance genes known to exist outside integrons. Three isolates were resistant to sulphonamides but were not shown to carry neither sul1 nor sul2 . Only dfr and aad gene cassettes were found in the sequenced integrons. Conclusions: Resistance to trimethoprim in 19 of 69 trimethoprim resistant isolates is mediated by genes not detectable, as in the case with three sulphonamide resistant isolates. Sequenced integrons that contain dfr genes do not carry any gene cassettes mediating resistance to modern antibiotics.",

The chronic inflammatory AE lesions have developed in the local lymphatic chain area of the bite site. To perform diagnosis in these very unusual forms of AE, it is necessary to add unusual tests such as specific PCR to classical tests. Antibiotic resistance in foodborne Salmonella is an emerging public health concern. Integrons are now recognized as the main genetic vehicles of antibiotic resistance in Gram-negative bacteria, including in Salmonella . The purpose of the present study was to investigate the presence of class I integrons in resistant isolates of several serotypes of Salmonella isolated from poultry products and to determine their association with multidrug-resistance phenotypes. A total of 20 isolates of Salmonella belonging to seven different serotypes were tested. The most frequent multiresistant phenotype, found alone or together with other resistances, was to streptomycin and tetracycline. All but seven were resistant to three or more antimicrobial agents, including quinolones and amoxicillin. PCR analysis with the 5?CS and 3?CS primers detected the presence of class I integrons of 1.5 kb in one isolate, with the multiresistant phenotype: amoxicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, trimethoprim-sulphametoxazol and tetracycline. Our findings suggest that the uncontrolled use of the antimicrobial agents in food animals may have contributed to the development of the pattern of resistance observed in Salmonella isolates. Also the presence of integrons in low prevalent human Salmonella serotypes but associated with food animals underscores the public health problem of antibiotic resistance acquisition and spread.",

Prevalence of Campylobacter jejuni and C. coli strains was 56.6% in standard, 51.3% in export and 80% in free-range broilers. In standard and export productions, the most often isolated species was C. jejuni , whereas C. coli was predominant in free-range production. 53.8% samples collected from pigs contained C. coli . The sensitivity of strains to ampicillin, nalidixic acid, enrofloxacin (broilers) or ciprofloxacin (pigs), tetracycline, erythromycin and gentamicin was tested by an agar dilution method. In broilers, the percentages of resistant strains were, respectively 22, 25, 17, 57, 0.3 and 0% for C. jejuni and 29, 43, 40, 70, 31 and 0% for C. coli . In pigs the percentages of resistant C. coli were, respectively 12, 21, 12, 83, 65 and 0%. In broiler production, significant differences between distributions of species or percentages of resistant strains were observed according to type of production or administrated antimicrobials. The enzyme DHPS (dihydropteroate synthase) participates in the folate synthesis pathway, and is well recognized as the target for sulphonamides. The enzyme preceding DHPS in this pathway, PPPK (dihydropterin pyrophosphokinase), is another interesting candidate drug target. The metabolic role of PPPK is to provide one of the substrates for DHPS. Earlier studies have suggested that PPPK and DHPS enzymes need to have physical contact with each other for full enzyme activity. Studies of potential interactions between the enzymes have been initiated. So far, indication of a weak interaction has been detected in gelfiltration experiments and the two-hybrid system. To confirm these results, we are currently developing a method to study substrate channeling, as interfering with such interactions could lead to impaired growth and thus be used as inhibitory drugs. We have also cloned and sequenced the operons coding for the enzymes in the folate biosynthesis from different clinical isolates of Streptococcus pyogenes . Comparisons revealed some isolates with a mosaic structure in the operon, suggesting that horizontal transfer of genetic material has occurred.",

We used latex-agglutination for this comparision. Throat specimens obtained from 490 cases were inoculated to Dio-Bacit plates, first to one side with 5% sheep blood agar and to the other side with B. After an overnight inoculation at 37 8C, colonies with beta hemolysis an 5% sheep blood agar but no growth with B, were inoculated to 5% sheep blood agar again and antibiogram identification discs containing 0.04 U B and 1.25 and 23.75 mg SXT (Oxoid, UK) were placed onto the plate and incubated overnight at 37 8C. After that, colonies with beta hemolysis were defined as B-sensitive while colonies resistant to SXT were defined to be GABS. All colonies are serologically classified by latex-agglutination (Oxoid, UK). Seventy-one (14.5%) inoculations revealed growth of GABS at Dio-Bacit plates. After inoculating these colonies to 5% sheep blood agar, 72 of them were found to be sensitive to B, while 67 were found to be sensitive to B but resistant to SXT and 58 of them were defined as GABS by Latex test. When compared with latex-agglutination test, we found Dio-Bacit method's sensitivity and spesificity to be 92 and 96.9%, respectively. Method: Agar diffusion technique as recommended by DIN 58940 was used to determine IZS (read using AURA and manually) for 178 Staphylococci and 22 Enterobacteriaceae .

            "text": "Reports of an increased clinical incidence of pertussis and the development of resistance by Bordetella pertussis to erythromycin prompted the collection and antimicrobial susceptibility testing of recent clinical isolates from patients, who were hospitalized in Rouen between 1991 and 1999. MICs of nine antimicrobial agents (erythromycin, josamycin, spiramycin, roxithromycin, ketolide HMR 3647, cotrimoxazole, ciprofloxacin, rifampicin and amoxicillin) were measured by agar dilution method on Mueller-Hinton agar containing 5% horse blood. MBCs of erythromycin and rifampicin were also determined against four isolates of B. pertussis . All isolates were fully susceptible to the nine antimicrobial agents tested. MICs 90 (mcg/ml) were 0.03 for erythromycin, ketolide HMR 3647 and ciprofloxacin, 0.06 for josamycin, 0.25 for spiramycin, roxithromycin and rifampicin, 0.5/2.5 for cotrimoxazole, and 1 for amoxicillin. MBCs (mcg/ml) were 0.125 \u00c1/0.5 for eyrthromycin and 0.5 \u00c1/1 for rifampicin. In conclusion, our isolates of B. pertussis remain extremely susceptible to all antimicrobial agents tested, especially macrolides. No resistance was detected. Finally, if erythromycin remains the molecule of choice, other macrolides (C14 and C16) also confirm their good in-vitro activity. In addition, the good in-vitro potency of rifampicin, together with its great diffusion within the respiratory tract, suggests that rifampicin has potential clinical efficacy in pertussis too. The emergence of Streptococcus pneumoniae (Sp) with diminished susceptibility to penicillin G (PSDP) suggests the use of other antibiotics such as newer fluoroquinolones (FQ). The resistance phenotypes of 252 consecutive pneumococcal strains isolated from patients of four hospitals (Observatoire R\u00e9gional des Pneumocoques du Nord-Pas de Calais) were studied: 39 strains were susceptible to penicillin G and 213 were PSDP. Reference strains provided from the Centre National de R\u00e9feacute;rence des Pneumocoques were added to the study. The activity of pefloxacin, ciprofloxacin, norfloxacin, sparfloxacin, levofloxacin and moxifloxacin was studied. Reserpine was used to detect the efflux phenotype. Methods used were performed according to the recommendations of the Comit\u00e9 de l'Antibiogramme de la Soci\u00e9t\u00e9 Fran\u00e7aise de Microbiologie. For each strain, the resistance phenotype to FQ was deduced by comparison of MICs or diameters obtained with those obtained with the reference strains of known phenotypes. FQ resistance phenotypes were not correlated to blactam agent susceptibilities. Wild type phenotype was observed among 76.9 and 77.5% of the susceptible and PSDP strains, respectively. A 'wild efflux' mechanism, deduced by addition of reserpine to norfloxacin, represented the predominant phenotype. It was detected among Sp susceptible to penicillin G (23.1%) as well as among PSDP (17.4%). The aim of this study was to determine macrolide resistance phenotypes of SP isolated in three French departments (Alpes Maritimes, Doubs, Nord) from nasopharyngeal aspirates of children aged 3 months to 3 years attending a DCC. A random sample of children attending randomly selected DCCs was obtained during three periods (Spring, Autumn and Winter 1999) in each department (10 494 children attending DCCs and 2565 children sampled). Analysis of macrolide susceptibility of SP strains was performed using the CA-SFM method. Out of 1262 strains, 64.7% had decreased susceptibility to penicillin (SPDP) and 77.5% were resistant to erythromycin. The triple disk diffusion method (erythromycin (E), clindamycin (Cl) and spiramycin) was used to determine resistance phenotypes. Macrolide resistance is a well known phenomenon in France and is confirmed by our study. These results show that the constitutive phenotype is predominant as in other parts of Europe and the frequency of efflux mechanism is lower than that observed in the USA and Canada.",

The mutation seems also to influence the strain's susceptibility to ampicillin and tetA (C )-mediated (plasmid-borne) tetracycline resistance. Although the TetA(C) protein retained its biological function, there was a considerable growth impairment of the mutant strain when cultured in tetracycline containing medium. Deletion of the acrAB locus prevented any growth in the presence of tetracycline. Upon the addition of ampicillin, the mutant underwent lysis more rapidly than the control strain. Such was also observed in acrAB deletion derivatives of other E. coli strains. We are trying to elucidate the role of the acrA gene product in the phenomena described above.",

Medical Microbiology and Parasitology, Calcutta University, Kolkata, India Efflux pumps possessed by the bacterial cells of different kinds of bacteria had presented as a newer mode of drug resistance in many organisms. The capacity of bacterial cells to cause outward flow of noxious agents was known, however, for a considerable time with respect to tetracycline. Recently, interest in the efflux pump system has brought to light some previously ill-understood mechanisms of drug resistance, involving noxious agents, toxins or poisons. We have found high level of resistance in pseudomonads towards cetrimide and other germicides for which no definite chromosomal/plasmid-mediated genes/mechanisms could be identified. Likewise, occurrence of nonantibiotic sensitive vibrios, staphylococci and pseudomonads in the background of their high level of resistance to most of the common antibiotics suggest a mechanism of interference with the efflux pump, which accounts for such sensitivity in such cases. Involvement of multiple resistance of marine isolates of V. parahaemolyticus to numerous clinically used antibiotics to which they have never been exposed also suggests a possible role of efflux pumps in determining such resistance */that these can simultaneously develop against multiple marine toxins/poisons and other noxious agents.",

In this work, we examined the interaction between oxacillin and glycopeptides against this teicoplanin-resistant mutant of S. epidermidis with reduced susceptibility to vancomycin. To study the combined antibiotic activity of oxacillin and glycopeptides, we used different methods: a modified disk diffusion test, the E -test, time-kill assays and population analysis profiles. The synergistic activity of glycopeptides in combination with oxacillin against the teicoplaninresistant mutant 353b TM256 was demonstrated with a bactericidal effect. No synergy was seen against the parental strain 353b SO. Moreover, the synergy between glycopeptides and oxacillin occurred with suppression of the subpopulation with the highest level of glycopeptides resistance.

We show the tendency in decreasing of frequency of R since 1998; this is more evident in private hospitals (b-lactam and aminoglicosides).

Our objective was to determine the antimicrobial susceptibility, with focus on b-lactam resistance, among Enterobacteriaceae strains isolated from raw drinking water samples. Several isolates (n0/107) of Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii obtained from drinking waters were screened for antibiotic susceptibility patterns, using the agar diffusion technique, according to NCCLS's procedures. Only 55% of E. cloacae strains, as well as 37% of C. freundii strains show resistance to amoxicillin and amoxicillin/ clavulanic acid. A reduced incidence of resistance to several others antibiotics was also observed. The obtained results suggest that strains isolated from raw drinking water have greater susceptibility to antimicrobial agents than pathogenic strains from hospital or outpatients infections. The 'natural' antimicrobial resistance phenotypes, usually described for C. freundii and E. cloacae , only seem to apply to strains isolated from human infections. Notwithstanding the high susceptibility of the tested isolates to b-lactams, the role of environmental bacteria as a reservoir of resistance genes justify its periodical monitoring as a valid index for resistance spreading.",

E.I.F.T. srl, Firenze, Italy A retrospective survey of antimicrobial chemotherapy use in 560 Intensive Care Units in Italy was carried out in 1999 using a computerized questionnaire under the auspices of the Journal of Chemotherapy. Of the ICUs contacted, 43.4% replied, being mainly general or post-surgical and pediatric units having a mean of 10 beds, nine doctors and 20 nurses. The antimicrobial agents used in these wards were almost always polychemotherapy with prevalent use of beta-lactams, aminoglycosides and glycopeptides or as empirical treatment during the first 72 h after hospital admission. The continual use of medium-high dose combinational antimicrobial chemotherapy was justified by microbiological testing, which revealed that more than one-third of bacterial pathogens were resistant. Approximately, 60% of Gram-positive bacteria were methicillin-resistant, whereas about 13% of Gram-negative strains were resistant to at least one of the tested antibiotics. Forty percent of the responding ICUs furnished microbiological testing data, of which three quarters indicated the incidence of chemoresistance of the isolated strains. Fungal infections were less frequent than bacterial, the most commonly isolated agent being Candida spp. In conclusion, the sample of ICUs examined showed adequate and reasonable use of antimicrobial agents, with heavy reliance on medium-high dose combination therapy due to the elevated incidence of resistant isolates found.",

In Bichat hospital 111 cases of malaria acute illness were reported during 2001. Among them, 96 patients were hospitalised and intravenously treated by quinine. This retrospective study consisted of comparing the therapeutic drug monitoring (TDM) of quinine distinguishing, respectively 36 and 60 patients cured in Infectious Medical Department (IMD) and Intensive Care Unit (ICU) where a standardised quinine regimen was established (62 and 47% malaria attacks, respectively). In ICU, the treatment consisted of an infused loading dose 16 mg/kg/4 h of quinine diluted in 5% glucose followed by 24 mg/kg/day. Plasma quinine maximal concentrations were assessed after selective liquid \u00c1/liquid extraction and spectrofluorometry detection. Statistical analysis was performed using t -test. Results showed that patients had comparable weight (71.49/19.7 and 70.89/17.9 kg) but quinine doses and plasma concentrations were significantly different in ICU and IMD, respectively (20.29/6.5 versus 22.79/3.7 mg/kg/day, PB/ 0.001 and 11.49/3.3 versus 10.39/3.2 mg/l, P B/ 0.01).

Conclusion: The serum concentration after oral administration is already sufficiently high to show the optimal bactericidal effect of MOX that can only be slightly increased by higher peak concentrations and higher AUC/MIC ratios. Thus the concentration dependence is not linear but ends already at concentrations achievable by oral dosing and documents that AUC/MIC calculations cannot easily be translated into dosing schedules.

There is no pronounced initial effect on the two gram-positive species but a general slow reduction in the viable cell count (ka.max is reached after 24 h). The efficacy of MOX (measured as AAC and ka.max) on S. pyogenes and S. pneumoniae is to some extent increased after the second dose. However, the analysis of the killing curves reveals no major difference between OD and BID. Even the OD nearly gives the maximal bacterical activity of MOX against gram-positive pathogens.

This led us to compare, in patients with pneumonia due to mechanical ventilation, two intermittent administration patterns: 4 g three times a day (usual pattern) versus 4 g four times a day (high dose pattern). This study is carried out in collaboration with intensive care unit, bacteriological department and pharmacy where antibiotic concentrations are determined. Twenty-three takings of blood are executed within a 48 h period, in addition to two bronchial secretion samples. Concerning P seric concentrations, the high dose pattern seems to be more adapted because of relatively high residual concentrations ( !/20 mg/ml). Three hours after each injection, T seric concentrations are lower than the 4 mg/ml activity threshold. First and second day residual bronchial concentrations of P seem to be sufficient although T concentrations are below activity threshold. These results are to be correlated with the MIC determined by the bacteriological department, and only this correlation will make us able to conclude the better efficacy of the high dose pattern in intensive care patients.",

MRSA were recovered from routine clinical material and from surveillance swabs (nose, throat, skin). For isolation, conventional culture media were used and for surveillance swabs MRSA-screening plate (manitol salt agar with 6% oxacillin) and Trypticase soy broth with 6.5% NaCl were added. S. aureus was identified by catalase, DNA-se and tube-coagulase test. Antibiotic susceptibility was determined by the disk-diffusion method according to NCCI guidelines. All 187 MRSA isolates were tested for sensitivity to the following antimicrobials: gentamicin, netilmicin, ciprofloxacin, erythromycin, chloramphenicol, tetracycline, cotrimoxazol, vancomycin and clindamycin. It was found that all MRSA isolates were sensitive to vancomycin and partially or totally resistant to the rest. There were no important differences between the years 1999 and 2000. Our MRSA isolates were completely (100%) susceptible to vancomycin, but resistant to the other antimicrobials in use to some extent. Although the monitoring of MRSA susceptibility to antimicrobials once a year did not show any important change in antimicrobial resistance, the periodical monitoring of MRSA susceptibility to antimicrobials and revaluation of current treatment regimens of MRSA infections is necessary.",

The antiseptics are used for prevention of infections by MRSA. Antisepticresistant MRSA strains have been isolated from clinical specimens. Antiseptic resistance genes confer resistance to many kinds of drugs structurally and the resistance mechanism is the energy-dependent drug efflux system. In addition, the fluoroquinolone (FQ)-resistance gene, norA , confers also resistance to many kinds of antiseptics. We studied the relation of the susceptibility to antiseptics and FQs of MRSA strains isolated in Japan. A total of 420 strains of MRSA were isolated from 14 hospitals in Japan from 1998 to 1999. Acriflavin (AF), acrinol, benzethonium chloride, benzalkonium chloride and chlorhexidine digluconate were used as the antiseptics. Norfloxacin and sparfloxacin were also used in this experiment. The MIC was determined by agar double-dilution method as recommended by the NCCLS. About 65% of MRSA showed resistance to AF (MIC: !/64 ug/ml). No strain was resistant to a specific antiseptic. FQ-susceptible strains were susceptible to all antiseptics. This study showed that antiseptic-resistant MRSA are widely spread at hospitals in Japan. The drug of choice in treatment of serious infections caused by MRSA was still vancomycin, however sometimes failures were observed, especially in monotherapy. Some conflicting are present in literature about an effect of combined action of vancomycin and betalactams. In the present work, the common effect of vancomycin and methicillin against chosen Staphylococcus aureus strains was examined. The investigated strains were characterized as VISA, h-VISA and clones obtained from h-VISA in population analysis. Two methods were performed: E -tests with methicillin and vancomycin placed on the media supplemented with the second antibiotic and the chessboard micro-analysis with increasing concentrations of both antibiotics. The FIC indexes were calculated for different combinations of concentrations. On the basis of the FIC indexes it was shown that the simultaneous action of vancomycin and methicillin was synergistic in all examined strains VISA and h-VISA, but only in appropriate concentrations. In different combinations the observed effect was addition or indifference. Antagonism was never observed. The synergistic effect was not observed in the case of standard S. aureus strain sensitive to methicillin. Supplementation of media with 4% of NaCl substantially decreased the observed effect.",

All MRSA were b-lactamase producer. They showed coresistance to erythromycin (53%), ciproflxacin (36%), amikacin (29%), netilmicin (23%) and mupirocin (10%). Multiple resistant MRSA strains to mupirocin'/tetracyclines'/chloramphenicol amounted to 0.9%. Triple resistance to oxacillin'/ciprofloxacin'/netilmicin was 14%. The detection of mecA gene by PCR in randomly chosen MRSA qualified with 1 mg oxacillin disc resulted in only 15% mecA positivity indicating that the traditional disc diffusion test overestimates the frequency of MRSA strains particularly in such an environment where the usage of penicillins and cephalosporins is so liberal as in Hungary. Consequently, the selective pressure for blactam-resistance and b-lactamase induction exists everywhere. This conclusion is coherent with the relatively low frequency of multiple resistant MRSA strains and urge the need of a routinely available genetic method to apply for MRSA detection. Objectives: The main objectives of this study were to monitor antibiotic resistance, identify new/emerging resistance mechanisms at an early stage, prevent their dissemination, early detection and prevent the outbreaks.",

Colonization with S. aureus , was a predictor of infection: nasal swabs, throat swabs, ear swabs, skin swabs and umbilical swabs were significantly more commonly observed in neonates infected with S. aureus , than with other infections. Etiological analysis showed that co-pathogens Escherichia coli and viridans streptococci were significantly more frequently associated with neonatal infection caused by S. aureus , in comparison to other organisms. According to localization of infection site, conjunctivitis and thrush stomatitis was the commonest S. aureus neonatal infections. Outcome was similar to other infections and without any significant differences between both groups.

Cultivation and identification of the strains were performed by conventional methods and by VITEK system (bioM\u0207rieux) and susceptibility testing by disc diffusion. Potentional pathogens were recovered in 324 cases (13.27%). Gram positive cocci, in particular Staphylococcus spp. proved to be the most commonly isolated bacteria. Coagulase-negative Staphylococcus (CNS) was isolated more frequently (48%), followed by S. aureus (28%), Enterococcus faecalis and E. faecium (11%), Gram-negatives (3%), anaerob isolates (7.5%). Resistance to individual antimicrobials of S. aureus and CNS were as follows: methicillin 8 and 47%, clindamycin 4.5 and 21.7%, fluoroquinolones 0 and 18%. Mupirocin resistant strains of S. aureus were not found, while 7.7% were among the CNS strains. Our results could be essential for the rational selection of treatment at our orthopedic wards.

One hundred and forty pts were retrospective control (they received II \u00c1/III generation cephalosporins or linkosamides only after operation). The rate of SWI in pts with CC, CV and OC was 13.5, 73, 29%, respectively; DWI */16.2, 0 and 21%, respectively; UTI */72, 80, 42.8%, respectively. The AP with AM/CL was more effective compared to CTX'/MTZ (SWI */6 vs 18%, respectively, PB/ 0.05, DWI */9.8 vs 14%, respectively, P B/ 0.05). The rate of postoperative UTI was equivalent in two groups (62 vs 74%, P 0/N.S.). Thus, AP with AM/CL is preferrable option in extensive operations in OG pts. Fifty-eight patients were randomized into two groups. Group 1, a treatment consisting of 31 patients and Group 2, consisting of 27 patients as a control. The patients were at the age of 679/1.2 and had had different surgical interventions with general anaesthesia from 1 to 3 h and accompanying COPD (89%). Artificial pulmonary ventilation was used in 45 cases. In the early post-surgery period the patients of Group 1 were administered inhalation therapy, including ipratopium of bromide in the combination with fenoterol (atrovent, berodual) and ambrocsol (lazolvan) through a nebulizer.

Five patients had postoperative complications: two deep venous thrombosis, one pulmonary embolism, two postoperative haematoma. In five patients we observed a wound dehiscence; two of these patients showed clinical sign of SSI and microbiological examinations were positive for MRSA. One patient recovered from infection with medical therapy, while the other patient showed a local tumour recurrence and was amputated at the thigh.

In 69 cases the injury causing object was a needle that had been used in known patients, 14 of which were hepatitis B positive. Fifty-five (48.2%) of the injured health workers had been previously vaccinated against hepatitis B; the protective antibodies to hepatitis B in the blood were found in 35/114 (30.7%) health workers only, while the tests for antibodies to hepatitis C and HIV were negative in all cases. Following the incident, the majority of the injured persons, i.e. 102, were vaccinated against hepatitis B, while 46 persons (34.6%) also received passive prophylaxis with human immunoglobulin against hepatitis B. None of the injured persons have developed the disease or showed evidence of sero-conversion. In the year 2000 the general as well as specific preventive measures practised in our hospital became more rigorous.

To improve measures preventing dissemination of multidrug-resistant bacteria (MRB), a cross-sectional survey (2000) was conducted to analyse healthcare workers' (HCWs) isolation precaution knowledge for MRB infection at 21 investigation and outpatient departments excluding four declaring not to be involved in care to MRB patients (emergency, obstetrics, nuclear medicine, and bacteriology). Two hundred and eight HCWs answered (67% of the paramedical staff, 28% of the physicians). Thirty-three percent of them reported they do not know frequently or always the patient MRB status. They (82%) wish MRB status to be mentioned on the test form or on the advice request letter. MRB patient visit or test was appropriately timed in 62% answers. Gowns (61%) or masks (58%) use were not systematically reported. Other HCWs (74%) reported better isolation precaution knowledge than physicians (58%) and nurses (81%) than investigation assistants (58%). Physicians declared lower compliance with use of gowns, gloves or draw-sheets than other HCWs. They had also lower education in isolation precautions and were less interested in education programs. This study suggests the necessity to improve MBR infection information. Physicians and investigation assistants seem to be insufficiently aware of hospital infection control. Therefore, education strategies targeted at physicians and investigation assistants working at outpatient and investigation departments should be developed.",

Clin Infect Dis 2001; 32:1718) . In an attempt to define its value in the diagnosis of localized infections in neutropenic hosts, daily determinations of PCT and of C-reactive protein (CRP) were performed before and after the onset of fever in 50 subjects 27 male and 22 female aged 48.69/18.7 years with various haematologic malignancies (AML 26, NHL 17, MDS 5, ALL 2) developing neutropenia ( B/500 PMNs/mm 3 ) after chemotherapy. Thirty-three patients were presented with fever of unknown origin (FUO) and 17 with localized bacterial infections (LBI; pneumonia 7, acute pyelonephritis 4, soft tissue infections 3, acute pharyngitis 3). PCT was determined by an immunoluminometric assay and CRP by nephelometry. It is concluded that febrile neutropenia followed by a localized bacterial infections is accompanied by significantly higher levels of PCT than in case of FUO (47.99/3.64 vs 0.519/0.16 ng/ml). Similar differences are not observed with CRP, which lacks the appropriate specificity. Our study included 35 patients who were categorized as having proven (9), probable (11), or possible (5) systemic fungosis according to EORTC criteria; 10 showed no sign of infection, and were used as controls. Blood samples were received on the 1st, 3rd, and 5th day from the onset of signs of a fungal infection, and then twice a week. PCT levels were determined by an immunochemioluminent assay, and Candida and aspergillus antigen levels by ELISA.",

Results: Sixty-one episodes of S. maltophilia infection were observed in 59 patients: sepsis/bacteraemia in 48 cases (78.7%), lower airways infection in five, urinary tract infection in four, pharyngitis in two, lymphadenitis and liver abscess in one case each. Forty-seven out of 61 episodes of S. maltophilia infections (77%) occurred as nosocomial disease, generally in association with advanced immunodeficiency, neutropenia, instrumentation, and prior antimicrobial therapy.

Pulsed field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) analysis was applied to 13 ESBLs; five Klebsiella pneumoniae and eight Escherichia coli . Results: Revealed the prevalence of ESBLs in 25.8% of clinical isolates. The sensitivities of the DDST, TDT, E -test and Vitek were 100, 73, 86.9 and 47.8%, respectively. In the DDST, aztreonam was the most sensitive indicator (93.4%). PFGE demonstrated that 80% of K. pneumoniae were derived from a single clone whereas 62.5% of E. coli isolates were derived from two different clones. Non-clonal origin was demonstrated in 20% of K. pneumoniae and 37.5% of E. coli . Conclusion: There is an increased prevalence of ESBLs. The DDST is the most sensitive, practical and cost effective diagnostic method reliable for routine use in our laboratory. Both clonal spread and plasmid dissemination contributed to the concurrent nosocomial outbreaks caused by ESBL-producing K",

The aim of the study was to investigate, if some chemical compounds in concentrations recommended by Polish Pharmacopoeia for skin disinfection, comply European Standards requirements. Methods: Basic bactericidal (EN 1040) and fungicidal (EN 1275) activity were investigated as well as bactericidal activity of products for hygienic and surgical handrub and hand wash used in human medicine (prEN 12054). All methods and used neutralizers were validated. Standard strains: Staphylococcus aureus , Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Escherichia coli , E. hirae , Candida albicans and A. niger were used, when EN standards were evaluated. Results: Ethanol, izopropanol and n -propanol caused viable microbial count reduction required by ENs in pharmacopoeial concentrations",

He received autologous peripheral blood stem cell transplants in May 1997 and August 2001. The second transplant was complicated by prolonged profound neutropenia ( !/ 100 days). During this period he developed a necrotic lesion on the palm of his right hand, which resembled ecthyma gangrenosum. However, repeated blood cultures yielded Alcaligenes xylosoxidans . The wound was extensively debrided and a small splinter was identified in the palmar fascia. Unexpectedly, intraoperative deep tissue samples demonstrated fungal hyphae on histology, and subsequently Aspergil-lus terreus was isolated from multiple specimens. A. terreus is often reported as resistant to amphotericin B, so intravenous itraconazole was commenced (200 mg bd). However, this isolate later proved sensitive to amphotericin B (MIC 0.5 mg/l). While receiving itraconazole the patient developed cavitation in his right lung, compatible with a septic embolus. He was then treated with intravenous caspofungin (50 mg od) for 3 weeks. His neutrophil count also gradually recovered. The palmar lesion improved clinically and thoracic imaging showed gradual resolution of his fungal lesions. This is the first reported use of the new echinocandin, caspofungin, in the management of disseminated A. terreus infection.Longterm-treatment with linezolid in a patient with mediastinitis caused by small variant MRSA OR1.4 Presterl EC a , Apfalter P b , Rath T c , Parschalk B a , Graninger W a . a Department of Medicine I, Division of Infectious Diseases, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria , b Department of Clinical Microbiology, Hygiene Institute, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria , c Department of Surgery, Division of Plastic Surgery, University of Vienna, Vienna, Austria",

The in vitro activity of this compound was investigated by E -test and standart discdiffusion methods in a group of clinical isolates. A total of 44 strains, 24 Escherichia coli and 20 Klebsiella , were included in this study. Standart disc-diffusion test was done according to NCCLS recommendations. E -test was performed according to the manufacturer's instructions (AB Biodisk, Sweden). Bacterial suspensions adjusted to 0.5 MacFarland standart were spread on to Mueller \u00c1/Hinton agar (BBL, USA) and then E -test strips were applied. Following overnight incubation at 35 8C, the MICs were interpreted on the gradient scales of test strips. Obtained results of FEP E -test susceptibility are 91% for E. coli , 80% for Klebsiella . These results show, FEP has a good activity on E. coli strains compared to Klebsiella isolates. The MIC90 value of Klebsiella group is quite high, however, 80% susceptibility rate indicates FEP would be still a choice for antibiotherapy, particularly among multiresistant strains.A novel therapy in prevention of antibiotic-induced changes in faecal microflora PM108Harmoinen JA a , Vaali K b , Lindevall K c , Heino P c , Westermarck E a . a Dep.

The aim was to observe the colonization status with microbes that may have a nosocomial potential and to establish circulating phenotypes in ICUs. The results obtained from a total of 226 samples 61 strains of gram negative bacteria (Enterobacteriaceae family) were isolated. Fourteen strains showed extended spectrum beta-lactamases (ESBL) phenotype (eight strains of Klebsiella pneumoniae , three of Escherichia coli , two of Klebsiella ornithynolitica , one of Klebsiella oxytoca ). We used both disc diffusion test (extended antibiotic susceptibility test and synergy test to visualize 'champagne stopper' pattern) and mini API \u2020 system.The conclusion reached: We put in evidence a massive colonization with germs that may have a nosocomial potential especially microbes that produce ESBL (22.9% from all enterobacteriaceae isolated) which implies a rational policy in prescribing antibiotics in hospitals from western part of Romania.Carbapenem activity against nosocomial Gram-negative rods PM236Sawicka-Grzelak A a , Rokosz A a , Meszaros J b , Luczak M a . a Department of Medical Microbiology, University Medical School, Warsaw, Poland , b Department of General and Transplantation Surgery, University Medical School, Warsaw, Poland Purpose: To determine a susceptibility of nosocomial Gramnegative rods to carbapenems.Methods: Two hundred strains of Gram-negative rods were cultured from clinical specimens from hospitalized patients (July \u00c1/November 2001). Identification of strains was performed in the automatic ATB system (bioMerieux, France). Susceptibility of strains to carbapenems: imipenem and meropenem was determined with disc diffusion method according to NCCLS recommendations. ESBL-producing strains were detected with double-disc synergy test (DDST according to Jarlier et al., 1988) or a novel method of ESBL detection (DD, diagnostic disc) according to Appleton (1999) . Two discs were applied in this test: with cefpodoxime (CPD) and with cefpodoxime/clavulanic acid (CD 01) (Oxoid, England) .Results: One hundred and ten strains of enteric rods and 90 strains of non-fermenting rods were cultured. Twenty eight (14%) ESBLpositive strains were detected. Carbapenems were active against 96% of enteric rods. The percentage of non-fermenting rods susceptible to imipenem was 70 and to meropenem */60.Conclusions: Carbapenems: imipenem and meropenem demonstrated high activity against clinical strains of enteric rods. However, the antibiotics were less active against nosocomial strains of nonfermenting rods.Inhaled antibiotics against multiresistant bacteria in bronchial secretions of ICU patients: a preliminary report PM237Horianopoulou M a , Kanellopoulou M b , Paraskevopoulos I a , Valakis K a , Kyriakidis A a , Lambropoulos S a . a Intensive Care Unit, Sismanoglio General Hospital, Athens, Greece , b Department of Microbiology, Sismanoglio General Hospital, Athens, Greece Purpose: The aim of this study was to assess the effectiveness of aerosolized ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime and colistin, in ICU patients with multiresistant Acinetobacter baumannii or Pseudomonas aeruginosa colonization of the respiratory tract.Methods: Fifty-three intubated, mechanically ventilated patients participated in the study. Multiresistant A. baumannii , sensitive only to ampicillin/sulbactam, or P. aeruginosa , sensitive to ceftazidime or colistin, were isolated from the bronchial secretions (10 5 \u00c1/10 8 CFU/ ml). All 53 patients were subsequently treated with intravenous ampicillin/sulbactam, ceftazidime or colistin, whereas 27 of them were also given the same antibiotic in aerosolized form.Results: A decrease in the number of colonies by 10 3 \u00c1/10 6 CFU/ml was observed, following 2 \u00c1/4 days of combined treatment with both intravenous and inhaled antibiotic. None of the 27 patients developed VAP. In the 26 patients who only received the antibiotic intravenously, the decrease ranged from zero to 10 4 CFU/ml, after 7 days of treatment. Two of 26 patients developed VAP.Conclusions: Our results suggest that the administration of aerosolized antibiotics represents an effective means of preventing ventilator-associated pneumonia caused by A. baumanni and P. aeruginosa . Introduction: Pseudomonas aeruginosa is an important nosocomial pathogen. Resistance to certain beta-lactam antimicrobial agents among P. aeruginosa is increasing. Despite the development of new antibiotics multiresistant strains of P. aeruginosa represent an important therapeutic problem. The aim of this study was to investigate the activity of imipenem, amikacin, piperacillin, ciprofloxacin, ceftazidime, against clinical isolates of P. aeruginosa .",

Minium inhibitory concentrations were determined using Walkaway, interpretation based on NCCLSM 100-S9, January '99.Results: The respiratory tract was the single site of isolation for this study. The best activity was showed by imipenem 25%, followed by amikacin 22%, piperacillin, pip/tazobactam, ciprofloxacin had the same sensitivity 11%.Conclusion: A high level resistance to antibiotics was observed to P. aeruginosa isolated from tracheal aspiration. Carbapenems seem to be the most active against P. aeruginosa in this study. Materials and methods: Clinical samples were collected from patients admitted to this hospital. Only one isolate per patient was included. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was performed as recommended by the NCCLS. All bacterial isolates were tested by DD and AD to provide a comparison of both test results. Very major error was considered when the strains were resistant (R) by AD and susceptible (S) by DD and major error when S by AD and R by DD. Categories of S and R were stablised using the breakpoints suggested by Mensura (2000) . Colistin R strains was typed by REP-PCR.Results: Among the 35 strains included in this study 30 (85.7%) were S to colistin and five (14.2%) were colstin R by AD, of this five colistin R strains four (11.4%) were S to colistin by DD and one was R by both methods. All R isolates were similar by REP-PCR.Conclusions: Most of the AD colistin resistant strains were S when tested by DD indicating that this method is not useful to determine the resistance to colistin. REP-PCR patterns show that the spread of a colistin R clone seems to be involved. Methods: GNB were isolated from per-operative biopsies (pob) and/ or from articular punction (ap). Patients (pts) received CFP, 2 g bid'/ OFL, 200 mg tid or CIP, 400 mg bid intravenously for 28 days, followed by a prolonged oral FQ monotherapy. Cure was defined as: resolution of all clinical signs of infection, normalization of the biological inflammatory profile at the end of treatment (EOT) and absence of infection at the same site during the post-treatment followup period (PTFU).Results: All of the 20 studied patients [mean age 0/48 years] had hospital acquired BJI. Seventeen/20 had an infected orthopedic device (prosthetic joints0/6, other orthopedic prosthetic devices0/11). Culture of 17 pob and 5 ap yielded to Pseudomonas sp. (11), Enterobacter cloacae (6), others (4). Vancomycin was added for six pts co-infected by GNB-MRSA. Nineteen/20 pts underwent a surgical intervention (debridement0/11, removal-replacement0/7, amputation0/1). After PTFU period of 17 months (range 3 \u00c1/29), the overall success rate was 12/17 (88.2%) without serious adverse events.Conclusion: CFP \u00c1/FQ combination was safe and efficient in the treatment of hypercase GNB, BJI.Treatment of posttraumatic MRSA osteomyelitis of the femur with longterm cotrimoxazole */a case report PM241 The authors report a case of posttraumatic osteomyelitis of the femur caused by methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA), following the shot injury. Relapses of the infection occured in 3 months interval and were treated by revision, debridement, lavage and vancomycin. Because of laboratory signs of renal insufficiency vancomycin became contraindicated for treatment of the third relapse of infection and the different approach was employed: classic open treatment of bone infection sec. Orr was combined with a long-term administration of high-dose cotrimoxazole. The patient was given cotrimoxazole 9600 mg daily divided in four doses (120 mg/kg/24 h) for 2 months, then for gastrointestinal complaints with lowered dose of 5760 g daily for next 6 months. The wound completely healed. During 18 months after the final surgery there was no relaps of infection, but the atrophic pseudoarthrosis of the femur resulted. The patient can walk with a rigid orthesis and two crutches. The whole treatment of the Objective: To present a variety of severe nosocomial infections due to Stenotrophomonas maltophilia in patients hospitalized in tertiary medical units from Cluj.Results: During the last year nine strains of S. maltophilia obtained from patients with severe infections and hospitalized in different wards were isolated. All but one were considered nosocomial infections: four cases of pneumonia, one urinary tract infection, three cases of surgical wound infections and one case of endocarditis under surgical treatment. The cases of pneumonia were either primary occurring in a granulocytopenic patient with leukemia or secondary in patients that underwent surgical treatment. In the case of endocarditis the ethiology was established after surgery from the damaged valve in a negative hemoculture patient with a poor outcome under medical treatment. In all cases of surgical wound infection bacteremia occurred diagnosed on clinical basis in the presence of severe sepsis or hematogenous dissemination in the lung. The urinary tract infection occurred in a patient after urinary surgery and having a catheter in place. The immediate evolution was favorable in all cases but treatment was difficult due to the highly resistant strains and to underling diseases.Conclusions: S. maltophilia should be considered in nosocomial severe infections and prophylaxis by interrupting environmental transmission has to be promoted.",

Department of Medical Microbiology, University Medical School, Warsaw, Poland Purpose: To identify and determine the drug-susceptibility of ESBLpositive strains isolated from urine samples.Methods: Seven hundred and twelve strains of Gram-negative rods were cultured from 4000 urine samples from hospitalized patients during 5 months (July \u00c1/November 2001). Identification and susceptibility were performed in the automatic ATB system (bioMerieux, France) using ID 32 E, ID 32 GN and ATB UR 5 strips. ESBL-activity was detected with double-disc synergy test (DDST according to Jarlier et al., 1988) or using a novel method of ESBL detection (DD, diagnostic disc) according to Appleton (1999) . Two discs were applied in this test: with cefpodoxime (CPD) and with cefpodoxime/clavulanic acid (CD 01) (Oxoid, England).Results: Five hundred and ninety-five strains (83.6%) belonging to Enterobacteriaceae family, 115 strains (16.1%) of non-fermenting rods and two strains (0.3%) of other Gram-negative rods were isolated. Eighty-two ESBL-producing strains (11.5% of all strains) were detected. Fifty-nine ESBL-positive strains were susceptible to nitrofurantoin, 58-to norfloxacin and ciprofloxacin and 54-to fosfomycin.Conclusions: ESBL-positive strains were detected most frequently among enteric rods (80 strains). Nitrofurantoin and quinolones were the most active in vitro antibacterial agents against examined ESBLpositive uropathogens. Results: The mechanisms of resistance were evaluated phenotypically using 12 different aminoglycosides. A total of 257 aminoglycoside resistant gram-negative strains were studied. One hundred fifty-eight strains were collected in 1995 \u00c1/1996, 52 in 1998 and 47 in 2000. The resistant profiles were determined: Enterobacteriaceae */152; Pseudomonas aeruginosa */62; Acinetobacter spp. */43. The most frequently phenotypes were GT (gentamicin, tobramycin) */48% and GTNet (gentamicin, tobramycin, netilmicin) */35%. The GT phenotype due to production ANT(2\u0192)-I enzyme, the GTNet \u00c1/AAC(3)-V (87 strains), AAC(3)-IV */one strain and AAC(2\u0192)-I */one strain. The resistance to amikacin in 7% strains was due to production AAC(6?)-I (3%) and APH(3?)-VI (4%). The most of examined strains were simultaneously resistant to kanamycin and neomycin caused by production of APH(3?)-I (69%). Only seven strains were resistant to all aminoglycosides due to impermeability of outer membrane. No substantial differences were observed between years.Conclusions: The main mechanism of aminoglycoside resistance is fermentative modification. The high rate to gentamicin and tobramycin was due to production of ANT(2\u0192)-I and AAC(3)-V. Amikacin and isepamicin were the most active aminoglycosides against gramnegative nosocomial isolates.The incidence of Clostridium difficile associated diarrhoea (CDAD) increased in our department from January to June 2001.Objective: To confirm the out break of CDAD, to identify the risk factors and assess the effectiveness of the measures implemented for controlling this outbreak.Methods: CDC definitions were used to identify the cases. The scope of the outbreak was defined. CDAD incidences during the outbreak period and during the same period in 2000 were compared. Risk factors (reduced mobility, antibiotic treatments . . .) were studied for patients whom length of hospital stay (LHS) was more than 6 days. Contact precautions and environmental cleaning with ClONa implemented were assessed.Results: Seventeen episodes of CDAD were identified. Sex ratio: 1.41, mean age0/58.5, mean LHS0/36 days, mean delay for CDAD occurring0/21 days. One hundred and fifty-two patients involved in the study of risk factors. Relative Risk (R.R.) evaluated were: blactams (R.R.0/7.62, IC95%: 1.03 \u00c1/56.56), reduced mobility (R.R.0/ 7.61, IC95%: 1.76 \u00c1/32.85). Incidence of CDAD was less than two cases per 1000 days of hospitalisation after June 2001.Conclusion: We confirmed the outbreak of CDAD in our department b-lactams and reduced mobility were identified as risk factors for CDAD. Measures implemented to control the outbreak were effectiveness.Positive heart transport fluid cultures associated with severe infections in heart transplant recipients PM255",

Methods: We perform a 15-year retrospective study for all patients (N 0/79 160), admitted to our department between 1986 and 2000.Results: Between 1986 and 2000, a total of 1577 patients developed 1763 episodes of nosocomial bloodstream infection. The crude infection rates increased linearly from 7.2 to 25.4 per 1000 discharges (1.11 \u00c1/1.93 episodes per 1000 patient-days) during the 15-year study period. Increases in the infection rates were due to gram-positive cocci, yeasts and essentially explained by infections caused by coagulasenegative staphylococci, Staphylococcus aureus , enterococci, and Candida species, respectively. Although the crude mortality in patients with nosocomial bloodstream infections decreased from 45% in 1986 to 28% in 2000, the in-hospital population-attributable mortality among infected patients increased from 5.5 deaths per 1000 discharges in 1986 to 8.2 per 1000 discharges in 2000. The etiologic fraction or the proportion of deaths in patients with bloodstream infection to all deaths occurring in the hospital increased from 15.4% in 1986 to 26.4% in 2000.Conclusions: The incidence and the population-attributable risk for death among patients experiencing nosocomial bloodstream infections increased progressively during the last 15 years in our department.Ventilator-associated pneumonia before and after intensive care unit temporary closure PM257 Results: We compared the incidence, causative organisms and mortality of VAP in two different time periods. Period 1 June to December 1999. Period 2 June to December 2000. Between those two periods the ICU remained closed for 4 months because of reconstruction works.Period 1: Sixty-seven consecutive patients (pts) were studied with bronchial secretions cultures at least 2 days after Mechanical Ventilation (MV) initiation. The VAP was diagnosed by clinical, radiological and microbiological criteria in 17 pts (26%). Causative organisms included: Pseudomonas aeruginosa 8, Acinetobacter 5, Staphylococcus aureus 4, Klebsiella pneum. 3, Enterobacter 1. In three cases VAP was proved polymicrobial. Fourteen (14) episodes of VAP (82%) were developed after 7 days MV (late VAP) and were attributed to multiresistant microorganisms. Mortality of VAP was 29%.Period 2: Among 66 consecutive pts, VAP was diagnosed in 21 (32%). Causative organisms included: Acinetobacter 10, P. aeruginosa 8, S. aureus 4, K. pneumoniae 3, Escherichia coli 1. Five (5) cases were polymicrobial and 14 cases were 'late VAP' (67%). Causative microorganisms had similar patterns of sensitivity to antibiotics (compared to period one). Mortality of VAP was 38%.Conclusion: Temporary ICU closure had no significant influence on the incidence, distribution of causative organisms, their sensitivities to antibiotics and mortality of the VAP.",

Therefore, the charts of 225 patients (102 men, median age 67 years) were reviewed.Results: Logistic regression analysis identified in both sexes four independent correlates of in-hospital mortality, the coefficients of which divided by 0.5 and rounded to the nearest interval, resulted in the following integer-based scoring system: Points (men)0/6* between concentrations of LPS of the two groups were statistically significant on the 2nd and the 4th day (P B/ 0.05).

To study the problem of nosocomial infections in our hospital, a prevalence study was made from our team in 1999. The study included 265 patients (the total number of hospitalized patients at the time of the study). From these patients 129 were males (49.0%) and 136 females (51.0%). One hundred and ninety-one patients (72.0%) belonged in the groups of age between 50 and 89 years. Fifty-seven patients had a urine catheter (22.3%). One hundred and fifty-five/265 patients (58%) received antibiotics and from these 99 patients received one antibiotic and the remaining 56 patients two or more. A nosocomial infection was found in 13 patients and consequently the prevalence of HAIs was 5.0%. Among these, urinary tract infections were six (46.1%), lower respiratory tract infections were three (23.0%), surgical site infections were three (23.0%), and bloodstream infections was one (7.7%). The incidence of multiresistant bacteria was primarily Enterococcus spp and secondary, Pseudomonas aeruginosa , Enterobacter spp, Klebsiella pneumoniae , Escherirchia coli , Staphylococcus aureus , Enterobacter cloacae . Unfortunately prophylactic chemotherapy of long duration was found despite the suggestions of the infection control committee. Regarding age the highest incidence of HAIs occurred in the third age group.",

Of the patients with post-operation complications, 60% of 518 Gram-negative cultures were sensitive to ceftazidime and 72% to amikacin. Sixty-nine percent of 143 Gram-positive cultures were resistant to penicillin G, but they were sensitive to vancomycin and nitrofurantoin in 100 and 92% of cases, respectively. Sixty percent of 366 isolates of Pseudomonas aeruginosa were sensitive to ceftazidime and 71% to amikacin. Rates of resistance to carbenicillin and gentamicin were 60 and 66%, respectively. One hundred and fortythree isolates of Escherichia coli were studied and 65% of them were resistant to ampicillin 67% to cephalothin and 70% to tetracycline. Of the isolates tested against ciprofloxacin, all were sensitive. One hundred and eight isolates of Staphylococcus aureus were studied and they were resistant only to penicillin G (69%). Staphylococcus aureus was sensitive to erythromycin (65%), tetracycline (65%), oxacillin (83%) and vancomycin (100%). All 34 isolates Enterococcus faecalis were sensitive to nitrofurantoin and 70% to ciprofloxacin.

The patient underwent a liver transplantation and splenectomy in 1985. She had followed immunosuppressive therapy until 1995 when tacrolimus was added for chronic rejection. In 1999 non-Hodgkin lymphoma was diagnosed and chemotherapy was started. Six months later because of the presence of two metastatic encephalic foci affecting the optic chiasm, a new chemotherapy course was started with the regression of lesions. In January 2000 she was treated with steroid recycle and cyclosporine \u00c1/azathioprine \u00c1/prednisone reintroduction. Fever occurred after 2 months and Cytomegalovirus (CMV) infection was diagnosed. Treatment with Ganciclovir was started with clinical remission. In November 2000 CMV infection recurred and blood cultures were positive for a bacterium that was identified as Campylobacter fetus . The patient was successfully treated with intravenous ciprofloxacin. Bacteremia frequently occurs in cancer patients. Bacteremia due to C. fetus are rare, occurring mainly in immunocompromised patients. C. fetus expresses a proteinaceous surface layer that confers serum resistance. In our patients steroid and immunosuppression may have contributed to the development of lymphoma. All of these factors and chemotherapy have contributed to CMV infection and all have made the patient susceptible to bacteremia with this infrequently found bacterium. The clinical microbiologist should be aware of this infection in immunocompromised host.",

            "text": "Minenko SV, Dmitrieva NV, Sokolova EN, Ptushkin VV. Bone Marrow Transplantation Department, N.N. Blokhin Cancer Research Center, Moscow, Russian Federation C'/A is the standard regimen as empirical therapy for febrile neutropenia (FN). Activity of C against g'/ bacteria and g(/ bacteria, producing chromosomally-mediated b-lactamases (e.g. AmpC) is suboptimal. CEP is active against a broad range of g'/ and g(/, including AmpC producing bacteria. The purpose of the study was to compare the efficacy of two regimens in the treatment of FN.Methods: Patients with FN received either CEP (2 g/8 h) or C (2 g/8 h) plus Amikacin (15 mg/kg/day) or Netilmicin (5 mg/kg/day). Data were collected prospectively.Results: A total of 35 pts with 41 episodes (35/41) of FN were included. Fifteen/19 in CEP group and 20/22 in C'/A group. The median duration of neutropenia grade 4, distribution of age, sex and underlying disease were comparable in both arms. MDI was in 37 and 24%, CDI in 21 and 18% FUO in 57 and 63% in FEP and C'/A groups correspondingly. Response to the initial empirical regimen according to IHS criteria was in 58% of CEP and 27.3% of C'/A groups (P 0/ 0.05). Modification of therapy with a change of CEP or C to carbapenem took place in 31 and 40% of CEP and C'/A groups (P0/0.5). No patient in either treatment group died due to the presenting infection. Tolerability of CEP was good and no laboratory abnormalities took place. Transient elevation of serum creatinin level was observed in two patients C'/A group.Conclusions: CEP monotherapy is as effective as C'/A combination in the treatment of patients with fever and granulocytopenia Purpose of the study: Retrospectively, we analysed 60 patients with intraabdominal infection for aetiology, risk factors, and outcome from 11 hospitals in Slovak Republic within 1 year (March 00 \u00c1/March 01). Results: In this group significantly more frequent were older patients ( !/65 years) with cancer (65 vs. 16%, P B/ 0.0007). Acinetobacter spp. (50 vs. 7%, P B/ 0.0001) and Enterobacteriaceae (83 vs. 39%, PB/ 0.04) were predictive for monoinfection. Pre-treated patients with other antibiotics had inferior prognosis and more risk factors: permanent urinary catheter (95 vs. 67%, PB/ 0.05), ventilation or intubation (91 vs. 17%, PB/ 0.0001) and polymicrobial infection (86 vs. 33%, PB/ 0.0002). The risk factors with poor prognosis were Enterobacteriaceae (30 vs. 14%, PB/ 0.04), diabetes mellitus as underlying disease (18 vs. 54%, P B/ 0.2) and uraemia (4 vs. 40%, P B/ 0.002). Surprisingly, negative prognostic factor was also non-effective previous antibiotic therapy. Failed patients died significantly more frequently patients due to underlying disease. Cefoperazone/sulbactam was shown to be useful, effective and well tolerated also in one group of patients with 75% efficacy of treatment, and it belongs to a group of antibiotics suitable for treatment of nosocomial infections.",
