Biochemical purification of kinetochore proteins through sequence-specific affinity purification with CEN DNA (Ng and Carbon, 1967; Lechner and Carbon, 1991) has proven to be difficult, apparently owing to the low abundance of the kinetochore proteins and the requirement of accessory factors for binding in vitro. To date, only one CEN DNA-binding protein, CPFl (also known as CPl or CBFl), has been extensively characterized (Baker and Masison, 1990; Mellor et al., 1990; Cai and Davis, 1990) . CPFl is a member of the helix-loophelix family of DNA-binding proteins and binds as a homodimer to CDEI. A null mutation in cpfl results in only a IO-fold decrease in chromosome segregation, indicating that it is important but not essential for kinetochore function.

The cff collection consists of 138 independent mutants that exhibit increased loss of a nonessential chromosome. This collection represents approximately 50 genes whose products are required for high fidelity chromosome transmission in the mitotic cell cycle (Spencer et al., 1990) . Two mutations, cff13-30 and ctf14-42, tested positive in both secondary screens. We found that CTF14 was identical to NDClOI CBF2, recently shown to encode a 110 kd kinetochore protein (Goh and Kilmartin, 1993; Jiang et al., 1993) . Through a combination of genetic and biochemical approaches, we have shown that CTF13 is a previously unidentified essential protein that is a component of the S. cerevisiae kinetochore.",

To test the hypothesis that a CfN DNA-protein complex was responsible for the transcriptional block, we replaced the wild-type CENG sequence with a CEN6 sequence containing a single-nucleotide point mutation (CDEIII-15C) in the central element of the palindrome of CDEIII (CCG). This transversion from G to C causes a 250-fold increase in the rate of mitotic missegregation of a chromosome fragment (Hegemann et al., 1988; Jehn et al., 1991) . Similar central element mutations have been shown by in vivo footprinting to result in decreased methylation protection of CEN DNA (Densmore et al., 1991) . The CDEIII-15C CEN mutant inserted in the actin intron allowed approximately 20% of the 8-galactosidase levels seen when no CfN was present ( Figure 1 ). Thus, a CEN DNA mutation affecting kinetochore integrity caused an increase in transcriptional readthrough that was detectable by increased levels of 8-galactosidase activity.

When this occurs, the DNA molecule usually breaks, and the dicentric chromosome is rapidly lost or is rearranged to a stable form (Mann and Davis, 1983; Haber and Thorburn, 1984) . A kinetochore mutant might assemble kinetochores that have a weakened attachment of chromosomal DNA to microtubules.

The actual sectoring phenotypes that resulted, shown in Figure 4 , were consistent with our hypothesis, indicating that the dicentric stability assay was a feasible screen for kinetochore mutants among the cff collection ( Figure 3C ). To screen the cff mutants for stabilization of a dicentric chromosome, the conditional nearly wild-type CEN, ACDEI, was integrated into the chromosome fragment present in each strain. The strains were maintained on galactose to induce the GAL.70 promoter and inactivate the conditional CEN (see Experimental Procedures and Figure 3A ). Two transformants of each cff strain were streaked onto medium containing dextrose to activate the dicentric state by repressing transcription from the GAL70 promoter. The stability of the dicentric chromosome fragment in the crf strains was visually assessed and compared with the stability of the dicentric chromosome frag-ment in the CTF+ strain. If the dicentric chromosome fragment was as unstable as in the wild-type background ( Figure 3B ), the cti strain was scored negative in this assay. With 27 cff mutants tested (see Experimental Procedures for list), 2 exhibited a reduction in sectoring frequency relative to the wild-type control and were thus identified as putative kinetochore mutants: ~30 (ctfl3), and ~42 (ctfl4) (see Table 2 ). The sectoring phenotypes exhibited by ~30 (ctfl3) and a representative mutant that was scored negative, ~16 (ctfg), are shown in Figure 4 .

We therefore explored further whether the cff13-30 and active on dextrose medium (the test chromosome behaves as a dicentric). (B) The stability of the test dicentric chromosome fragment can be monitored visually. A tRNA suppressor gene (SUP1 1) present on the chromosome fragment partially suppresses the accumulation of red pigment caused by the ade2-101 ochre mutation in our strain backgrounds. If the chromosome fragment is present, the strain is white; if it is lost, the strain is red. Thus, the numberof red sectors that develop during the growth of a colony founded by a haploid cell containing the chromosome fragment (white) is indicative of the rate of loss of the chromosome fragment in the strain. The lines within the circles represent the presence of such red sectors in a white colony. The sectoring phenotypes pictured are those predicted and observed (see Figure 4 ) when nearly wild-type (CEN*v) and highly defective (CEN-) CEN",

A 2.2 kb Sau3A fragment that complemented the temperature sensitivity of ctf73-30 was shown to correspond to CTF73 by the directing of an integration event in a heterozygous diploid. This event introduced a prototrophic marker at the genomic site of the cloned DNA segment and deleted approximately half of the 2.2 kb genomic sequence (almost the entire CTF73 open reading frame [ORF]; see Experimental Procedures and Figure  58 ). When the diploid transformants were dissected, it was found that viability segregated 2:2 (see Experimental Procedures). We concluded that the cloned DNA encodes wild-type CTF73 and that CTF73 is an essential gene in S. cerevisiae. CTf 73 was localized to the right arm of chromosome XIII using both physical and genetic mapping methods ( Figure 5A ).

This physical location was verified by using the 2.2 kb SauM fragment to probe a set of filters containing contiguous overlapping 1 clones that cover 66% of the yeast genome (L. Riles and M. Olson, unpublished data). CTF73 was localized to overlapping clones 4199 and 6643, placing it on an -15 kb segment of DNA located on the right arm of chromosome XIII between adh3 and i/v2 The temperature-sensitive cff7530 mutation was meiotically mapped and found to be located 34 CM proximal to the cin4 locus, which agrees well with the physical mapping data (see of CTF13 (see Experimental Procedures).

In theory, the degree to which the integrity of the kinetochore must be compromised to result in either of these phenotypes could be quite different. In a simplified view, mutations affecting the interaction of the kinetochore complex with the CEN DNA should be detected by both assays, while mutations affecting kinetochore to microtubule interactions may only be detected by the dicentric stabilization assay. However, we note that kinetochores participate in several distinct processes in vivo, including microtubule capture, congresaion to the metaphase plate, and poleward migration. In addition, a viable kinetochore mutation would most likely be a leaky mutation, which might exhibit complex consequences following the primary defect. Thus, in reality, it is quite possible that some of the mutations identified by only one of these secondary screens indeed disrupt kinetochore integrity but perhaps lead to more subtle alterations than cff73-30 or cff74-42. It is clear that these two screens, whether used alone or in combination, have the potential to aid in the identification of additional regulatory and structural components of the S. cerevisiae kinetochore.

A mutation affecting DNA metabolism was expected to cause increased rates of both chromosome loss and mitotic recombination, while a mitotic segregation mutant was expected to cause only an increase in chromosomal loss events. Phenotypic analysis of a known DNA metabolic mutant, DNA polymerase a (c&77; Hartwell and Smith, 1985) , and a known spindle mutant, B-tubulin (r&2; Huffaker et al., 1988), supported this model. Examination of these phenotypes for cff73-30 strains revealed a significant increase in the rate of chromosomal missegregation with only a very slight elevation in the rate of mitotic recombination (Table 38 ).

These dependencies can result from a substrate-product mechanism or from extrinsic control by a monitoring function termed cell cycle checkpoint control (Hartwell and Weinert, 1989) . Checkpoints are responsible for a subset of observed cell cycle arrests or delays. Cell cycle arrests or delays associated with kinetochore defects have been reported in several systems. In animal cells, a delay in the initiation of anaphase is correlated with the failure of chromosomes to achieve bipolar attachment to the spindle (Rieder and Alexander, 1989; Zirkle, 1970) and a metaphase arrest is observed with kinetochore disruption by injection of anti-centromere antibodies (Bernat et al., 1990) . In yeast, one abberant kinetochore on a single chromosome can cause a mitotic delay (Spencer and Hieter, 1992) . ctf73-30 strains exhibit a G2/M phase accumulation in logarithmic cultures at permissive temperature and a preanaphase arrest morphology at nonpermissive temperature. Cell morphology and DNA content do not critically distinguish G2 and M phases in yeast. However, at permissive temperature, crf73-30 strains exhibit a detectable increase in Hl kinase activity relative to CTF73 controls, and at nonpermissive temperature, Hl kinase activity levels in cff73-30 strains are equivalent to nocodazole-arrested strains (data not shown). Thus, Hl kinase activity measurements suggest that the cti73-30 mutation causes an accumulation in M phase. It is tempting to speculate that this cell cycle alteration is similar to those described above and that these are a result of checkpoint control exerted in the presence of defective kinetochores.",

The fact that the ctf73-30 defect does not lead to a permanent and uniform arrest morphology may simply be a result of the presence of a small amount of active CTF13 protein that eventually allows completion of mitosis, or mitosis may never be completed but cytokinesis may still eventually be attempted in some cells. Consistent with the latter possibility, we have observed the accumulation of cells with a cut-like phenotype: 10% of all cells exhibit this phenotype after 5 hr at the nonpermissive temperature. Bernat et al. (1990) describe a similar cut-like phenotype after injection of mammalian cells with anti-centromere antibodies and propose that it is a result of the cells' eventual attempt to undergo cytokinesis after prolonged mitotic arrest. Because it is not known whether this subset of the cff73-30 population is still capable of dividing, it is unclear whether cytokinesis has trapped nuclei in these cells or whether they are caught undergoing nuclear transits at the time of fixation (Palmer et al., 1989) .",

If there is checkpoint control exerted in response to events at the kinetochore, the ndclO-7 defect is not recognized. Perhaps this is because the NDC70 protein itself is involved in the recognition and/ or signaling of a dysfunctional complex, or alternatively, checkpoint control may be disabled by complete disruption of kinetochore structure. Future experiments addressing the relationships of kinetochore proteins to the control of progression through mitosis should help define important molecular determinants of the temporal order of events in chromosome segregation.",

At this time, analysis of the DNA sequence and protein component requirements of the kinetochore is significantly more advanced in S. cerevisiae than in any other eukaryotic organism, although there is great speculation about the relevance of these studies to the understanding of the much larger and morphologically more elaborate kinetochores present in other eukaryotes. While there may be a need for additional components to ensure fidelity in more complex eukaryotes, we think it is probable that the basic mechanisms of the segregational process, including those involved in centromere function, will have been conserved through evolution. A repeat subunit model for the centromere-kinetochore complex has recently been proposed by Zinkowski et al. (1991) .

True positives were verified in multiple independent transformants. One source of false positives was transformants containing two chromosome fragments, only one of which carried the conditional secondary centromere. These false positives were easily identified by the demonstration that sectored colonies were His+. For ~30 (ctft3), the phenotype of stabilization of the test dicentric chromosome was shown to be due to a mutation in the CTF73 gene product by transformation of a pKF76 derivative of ~30 with pKF1 I, a pRS3lCbased (Sikorski and Hieter, 1969) plasmid carrying the CTFf3 locus. The presence of the wild-type CTF73 gene product resulted in destabilization of the dicentric chromosome fragment back to the level seen in the wild-type parent, YPH276.",

Kroll, unpublished data). p414GEUl has a 460 bp GAL7 promoter fragment cloned into the Kpnl site and two tandem copies of the El tag sequence, described by Pluta et al. (1992) , inserted in frame into the Apal and Xhol sites of pRS414 (Sikorski and Hieter, 1969) . The GAL7 promoter directs transcription from its own ATG toward the polylinker. An EcoRl fragment containing the entire 2.2 kb insert of pKFl1 was cloned into the EcoRl site of p414GEUl in the appropriate transcriptional orientation. The 5' -600 bp of the CTF73containing fragment (up to the Bglll site; see Figure 58 ) were removed and replaced with an -200 bp polymerase chain reaction product containing sequences from the ATG of CTF13 to the Bglll site. This allowed the in-frame fusion of the tandem El tags to CTF73 under the transcriptional control of GAL7 (see Figure 5C ). pKF60 was transformed into YPH972 and shown to rescue the temperature sensitivity caused by the ctf73-30 mutation on both galactose-and dextrosecontaining media. The plasmid containing the HA epitope fused to CTF13, pSFl97a, was constructed by using a synthetic oligonucleotide to fuse the HA epitope and linker sequences to the amino terminus of CTF13 (see Figure 5C ). The fusion protein and -200 bp of 3'noncoding sequence from the CTFl3 locus were cloned into pRS315 (Sikorski and Hieter, 1969) downstream of a 625 bp fragment of 5' flanking DNA that is presumed to include the CTF73 promoter. pSF197a was transformed into YPH975. Transformants were streaked onto medium containing 5-fluoroorotic acid to select against the CTFl3-URA3 plasmid (Boeke et al., 1967) and it was shown that pSF197a would rescue viability in the resulting ctf73Al::H/S3 strain. The preparation and analysis of CBF3-DNA complexes was performed using a modification of procedures previously described by Lechner and Carbon (1991) .
