            "text": "Rhodopsin's oligosaccharide chains contain predominantly two types of sugar residues : mannose and Nacetylglucosamine. In the present work, bovine and rat rhodopsin were analysed biochemically for the presence of a third sugar, galactose. Treatment of bovine rod outer segments (ROS) with galactose oxidase followed by reduction with tritium-labeled sodium borohydride revealed the presence of existing molecules of galactose on rhodopsin. Rats injected intravitreally with [3H]galactose and [\"'Clleucine and maintained in darkness were killed 1 hr, 6 hr, 1, 3 or 5 days following the injection. Retinas were collected for subcellular fractionation and rhodopsin from each of the fractions was purified by ConA sepharose chromatography and SDS-PAGE. During the first 6 hr, galactose selectively labeled rhodopsin in the Golgi-enriched fraction resulting in increased [3H]/[14C] ratios in both Golgi and ROS. The data suggested that trimming was occurring at the transition from Golgi to ROS. Furthermore, a decrease in isotope ratio in the ROS between 6 hr and 1 day suggested further trimming of rhodopsin after membrane assembly in the ROS. Additional in vivo experiments demonstrated existing molecules of galactose on rhodopsin's oligosaccharide chain using lectin affinity chromatography. Rats injected intravitreally with [%]methionine were dark-adapted for 2 hr. Following subcellular fractionation of retinas, ConA purified rhodopsin from ROS was applied to one of two additional lectin columns: Ricinus communis agglutinin (RCA) or Grifjoonia simpficifofia I (GSA). Eight to nine per cent of the labeled rhodopsin was bound to and eluted from RCA, whereas none bound to GSA, indicating the presence of a /3-galactoside. The RCA agarose eluted protein co-electrophoresed with a rhodopsin standard and was light sensitive. Galactose was shown to be the terminal sugar on this subset of rhodopsin and was not capped by neuraminic acid. Binding of rhodopsin's oligosaccharide to RCA was abolished by pre-treatment with &galactosidase. Decreased binding of rhodopsin to RCA was observed following intravitreal injection of castanospermine but not swainsonine. Of those two inhibitors of glycoprotein trimming, only castanospermine would be expected to prevent the addition of galactose to the oligosaccharide. The association of galactose with rat rhodopsin appeared to be a transient one. At 2 hr. 8-9 % of rhodopsin contained galactose, at 6 hr only 2.2 % had galactose and by 24 hr less than 1% did. The galactose was trimmed from rhodopsin's oligosaccharide presumably after its role was complete. Separation of rhodopsin of the plasma membranes from rhodopsin of discs indicated that 75 y0 of the galactose-containing rhodopsin was in the plasma membrane and only 2 5 % was in the discs. These findings suggested a possible role for galactose in new disc formation with subsequent removal after the discs are sealed.",

            "text": "Rhodopsin contains two oligosaccharide chains linked to Asn, and Asn,, (Hargrave, 1977) . For the most part, these chains contain only two types of sugar residues : mannose and N-acetylglucosamine (Heller, 1968; Shichi et al., 1969; Heller and Lawrence, 19 70 : Plantner and Kean, 19 76) . The synthesis of asparagine-linked glycoproteins typically involves the rough endoplasmic reticulum for the initiation of oligosaccharide synthesis and both the rough endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi complex for modification of the oligosaccharide chain (Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 198 5 in more complex glycoproteins prior to the addition of a terminal trisaccharide consisting of N-acetylglucosamine, galactose and neuraminic acid. Rhodopsin actually contains the first sugar of the terminal trisaccharide as demonstrated by glucosamine incorporation studies (O'Brien and Muellenberg, 19 74 ; Bok, Hall and O'Brien, 1977) . The remaining sugars, galactose and neuraminic acid have not usually been detected in the rhodopsin oligosaccharide chain. However, O'Brien (19 76) demonstrated the direct transfer of galactose in vitro to bovine rhodopsin and showed chromatographically that the radiolabeledgalactose was incorporated as galactose since the radioactivity coincided with a galactose standard and was not converted to some other sugar (such as mannose). More recently, galactose was successfully incorporated into rat rhodopsin in vitro following incubation of whole retinas with [3H] galactose (St Jules, Smith and O'Brien, 1990) . Fukuda. Papermaster and Hargrave (19 79) analysed bovine rhodopsin's 0 1991 Academic Press Limited amino terminal glycopeptide using gas chromatography and mass spectrometry and reported that in addition to the major oligosaccharide structure which contained three N-acetylglucosamine residues and three mannose residues, a minor variation of rhodopsin contained 0.1 mol galactose per three Nacetylglucosamine residues and three mannose residues. These data suggested that up to 10% of rhodopsin contained galactose.",

Likewise, similar results were obtained in fluorescent microscopic studies detecting RCA binding in frog, monkey, mouse, human, rabbit, and fish retinas (Bridges and Fong, 19 79 ; Bridges, 19 8 1; Uehara et al., 19 8 3 ; Blanks and Johnson, 1984) .

The pooled crude ROS suspension was diluted with 3 volumes of buffered 10% sucrose, or in some cases 0.9% NaCl, and were sedimented by centrifugation at 27000 g for 15 min. Both the ROS and retinal debris were separately homogenized in 2 ml 20% sucrose made up in 65 mM NaCl, 2 mM MgCl,. and 5 mM Tris acetate pH 7-4 using seven strokes of a Dounce tissue grinder (Wheaton 7 ml. B pestle with 0.002 5-0.003 S-inch clearance). These homogenates were layered over separate linear 50.-25% sucrose gradients made up in the same buffer. After centrifugation for 2 hr in a Spinco SW7 41 rotor at 3 5 000 rpm, bands were removed with a Pasteur pipet. diluted with loo/, sucrose and sedimented by centrifugation for 15 min at 2 7 000 g. Two bands of unsealed and sealed ROS were near the top of the ROS gradient (Godchaux and Zimmerman. 1979) . Below these was a zone of fine particles, enriched in Golgi. In the retinal debris gradient was a trace of the Golgi-enriched fraction and a prominent zone of coarse particles, including the rough endoplasmic reticulum, nuclei and synaptosomes. These fractions are described in more detail in St Jules and O'Brien (1986) .",

This treatment was followed by exposure to tritium labeled sodium borohydride which chemically reduced the carbonyl group of galactose back to a hydroxyl with the introduction of a tritium atom (Gahmberg and Hakomori, 1973 ; Carubelli and Wen, 1990) . Figure 1 shows that without galactose oxidase treatment there was tritium incorporation into rhodopsin. There was a twofold increase in label following the galactose oxidase treatment. The galactose oxidase-dependent label tended to be in a species that migrated slower than rhodopsin as is indicated in the figure by the dashed line representing the difference between the two treatment groups. Table I illustrates another experiment in which the galactose oxidase incubation time was doubled and the amount of radioactivity in the galactose oxidase treated ROS was 6.8-fold greater (over 70000 dpm) than the samples not treated with the enzyme. Pretreatment with neuraminidase did not increase the labeling. The non-specific labeling of opsin in the samples not treated with the enzyme was due perhaps to reductions of the retinyl-lysine Schiff s base linkage. These experiments demonstrate the presence of galactose in the oligosaccharide chains of native rhodopsin in ROS plasma membranes and basal folds.

Rats were injected intravitreally with [35S]methionine and were maintained in darkness for 2 hr at which time 12 retinas were collected and crude ROS preparations were made using the vortexing procedure described. Linear 50-25 % sucrose gradients of crude ROS suspensions which have been centrifuged for 2 hr typically have four bands. A very faint uppermost band is approximately 1.5-1.8 cm from the top of the gradient. Two bands of unsealed and sealed ROS are below the 1.5 cm band (Godchaux and Zimmerman, 1979) . Below these is a zone of fine particles, enriched in Golgi. Pellets of each of these bands were detergent extracted and applied to separate RCA columns. As shown in Fig. 7 , the Golgi-enriched fraction and both ROS fractions (ROS 1 and ROS 2) bound to and were eluted from RCA. The uppermost band did not demonstrate RCA binding. SDS-PAGE of these fractions showed that the Golgi and ROS fractions coelectrophoresed with a rhodopsin standard.

To test this, a time course experiment was conducted. Rats were injected with [35S]methionine and [3H]galactose and groups of 6 animals were killed 2, 6 and 24 hr following injection. Retinas were collected for subcellular fractionation, ROS were extracted and rhodopsin was purified by ConA sepharose chromatography. A small fraction of the ConA eluate was applied to SDS-polyacrylamide gels and the remainder was applied to RCA. Table V provides the data obtained from gel electrophoresis of the ConA-and RCA-eluted samples. Electrophoresis of the RCA agarose eluates revealed that the percentage of the ConA-purified rhodopsin that bound to RCA decreased over time. At 2 hr, 8.69 % of the rhodopsin bound to RCA, after 6 hr 2.17 % was bound and by 24 hr only 0.89% was bound. Electrophoresis of the ConA-purified rhodopsin showed that the ratio of the isotopes (that is the ratio of [3H]galactose to [35S]methionine) decreased over tie from 0.40 at 2 hr to 0.15 by 24 hr. Clearly, trimming of galactose from rhodopsin had occurred suggesting that galactose may be an early component of rhodopsin, but as the molecule progresses through the ROS the galactose appears to be lost. In contrast, the ratio of the isotopes ([3H]galactose to [35S]methionine) in the rhodopsin that bound to RCA was higher than in the total pool eluted from ConA and did not change significantly over time. Thus, the ratio changes were due to removal of galactose residues. Retinas were collected at the indicated times. ROS were prepared and rhodopsin was purified on ConA sepharose. Aliquots were analysed by SDS-PAGE and the rest chromatographed on ricin agarose. Ricin eluates were also analysed by SDS-PAGE.",

After treatment with neuraminidase ROS were incubated with ricin-agarose. Subsequent to lysis and trypsin treatment, the ROS membranes were layered on linear 50-25x sucrose gradients underlaid with 60% sucrose. Following centrifugation, discs and the plasma membranes were removed. Detergent extracts of these two components were applied to RCA agarose columns. Elution patterns from RCA revealed significant binding of plasma membrane extracts and a small amount of binding of disc extracts. SDSpolyacrylamide gels of the eluates showed that the total amount of radioactivity present in rhodopsin of the plasma membrane (1149 dpm) was 3.6 times greater than the total amount of radioactivity present in disks (3 18 dpm).

These findings suggested that galactose may in fact be associated with rhodopsin of the ROS. if only for a short period of time. Perhaps the transient nature of its association explains its rather elusive detection by some biochemical techniques. In the current experiments, efforts were focused on demonstrating the presence of galactose by methods which could detect existing molecules, rather than solely by methods to show incorporation of exogenous galactose.",

The results clearly demonstrated that there were galactose molecules present on rhodopsin which were altered by the highly specific galactose oxidase treatment and were then reduced by the sodium borohydride with the introduction of radiolabel. The bovine model does not permit in vivo studies of oligosaccharide synthesis, however. so it became necessary to investigate the incorporation of galactose in the rat model. The studies in which galactose was injected intravitreally in rats and monitored over several days demonstrated a selective labeling during the first 6 hr in the Golgi-enriched and the ROS fractions. Thus, even though conversion of galactose to other sugars commonly found on rhodopsin's oligosaccharide chain probably occurred, the initial pulse of galactose was apparently incorporated as galactose in the Golgi where galactosyl transferase is known to be localized. The results strongly suggested that the galactose had been added to rhodopsin and then trimmed over time.",

This powerful technique allows for the separation of glycoproteins based on the affinity for certain sugar moieties (Cummings et al., 1989) . ConA. which has an affinity for mannose residues. has long been used in the purification of rhodopsin. In the present work. a portion of the ConA-purified rhodopsin was shown to bind to the lectin RCA which specifically recognizes terminal galactose moieties associated with either glucosamine or N-acetylglucosamine in a pl-4 linkage (Baenziger and Fiete, 1979) . whereas no rhodopsin bound to GSA which has an affinity for xlinked galactose (Blake and Goldstein, 1980) . Methionine was injected intravitreally into rats in order to label the polypeptide chain of rhodopsin. That the radiolabeled protein which bound to RCA was indeed rhodopsin was verified by light sensitivity experiments. In addition, the binding of the rhodopsin oligosaccharide to RCA could be decreased significantly by cleaving the galactose moiety with the highly specific enzyme /3-galactosidase. On the other hand, treatment with neuraminidase, which specifically hydrolyses neuraminic acid from oligosaccharide chains, neither increased nor decreased the binding of rhodopsin to RCA. These experiments indicated that the galactose of rhodopsin was not capped with neuraminic acid as is often the case with complex asparagine-linked oligosaccharides whose terminal trisaccharides contain N-acetylglucosamine linked to galactose capped with neuraminic acid (Kornfeld and Kornfeld, 1985) .",

In the present work, it was of interest to determine if galactose was associated with rhodopsin purified from the Golgi-enriched fraction as well as ROS. It was determined by subcellular fractionation and subsequent RCA chromatography that the rhodopsin of the Golgi-enriched fraction did indeed contain galactose. Furthermore, it was shown that the addition of galactose to the N-acetylglucosamine could be inhibited by in vivo exposure to castanospermine which specifically inhibits Glucosidase I. Glucosidase I is a rough endoplasmic reticulum enzyme that cleaves the terminal glucose from the Glc,Man,GlcNAc, (Repp et al., 1985) . With this early step in the processing of the oligosaccharide disrupted, the subsequent steps in the processing pathway could not continue. The addition of galactose to N-acetylglucosamine was prevented because the oligosaccharide chain was never processed to the point where galactose is typically added to N-acetylglucosamine. By way of contrast, the addition of galactose to N-acetylglucosamine was not affected by swainsonine which inhibits the Golgi mannosidase II. This enzyme typically cleaves two mannose residues from one of the branches of the oligosaccharide chain (Elbein, 1983) . The processing of the other branch of the oligosaccharide chain can continue normally. It is to this other chain, which contains a mannose and an Nacetylglucosamine, that galactose is typically added. However, it should be noted that a negative result with swainsonine is of limited significance since there is no assurance that it reached and inhibited the target enzyme. To the best of our knowledge, these experiments provide the first evidence in a mammalian system that glycoprotein processing can be modified in rhodopsin following in vivo exposure to the appropriate inhibitory agent. Chambers et al. (1986) reported that intraocular injection of frogs with up to 2 50 ,ug of castanospermine and swainsonine resulted in neither a decrease in rhodopsin content nor a change in the length of photoreceptor outer segments. Fliesler. Rayborn and Hollyfield (1986a) demonstrated that in vitro exposure of Xenopus retinas to castanospermine resulted in the hyperglycosylation of opsin. The opsin underwent normal intracellular transport and was utilized for the biogenesis of ROS membranes having normal disc morphology.",

It appeared from this work that trimming had occurred in the ROS over the course of several hours and also had occurred in transit from one subcellular compartment to another, namely, the Golgi-enriched fraction to ROS. We chose to investigate the trimming phenomenon which was apparently occurring in the ROS using lectin affinity chromatography. Two hours after the injection, approximately 8-9% of the labeled rhodopsin bound to RCA suggesting that about S-9% of newly synthesized rhodopsin contains a /3-galactose residue. The percentage of rhodopsin which contained galactose decreased by more than half within 6 hr and by 24 hr of the injection less than 1% of rhodopsin contained galactose. One might surmise that if the galactose concentration is greatest within 2 hr of injection, perhaps it constitutes a transient component of rhodopsin's oligosaccharide chain. One possibility is that it is associated with the rhodopsin of the plasma membrane and basal folds of the ROS and is removed as discs are sealed and move apically. The work of Hicks and Molday (1985) emphasized the presence at the basal area of the outer segments of ricin-binding compounds.",

It has been shown that the oligosaccharide of rhodopsin or some other ROS protein such as peripherin is essential for the process of disc morphogenesis by Fliesler and Basinger ( 198 5) and by Fliesler, Rayborn and Hollyfield (198 5) who successfully disrupted disc formation with tunicamycin, an inhibitor of oligosaccharide synthesis. Mechanisms have been proposed (Fliesler, Rayborn and Hollyfield, 1986b; Fliesler, 1988) showing how the oligosaccharide of rhodopsin could play an important role in disc formation. As new discs are formed, presumably the opposite faces of a newly forming disc must be aligned and brought into close apposition. It might be that the oligosaccharide plays some role in the process in much the same way that a lectin binds a ligand or a hydrolase interacts with an oligosaccharide substrate. If there were an enzymesubstrate interaction, perhaps a carbohydrate residue such as galactose on one surface might be cleaved by a hydrolase such as a galactosidase on the opposing surface. During this process the two membrane surfaces would come into close apposition with the exclusion of extracellular matrix allowing fusion of the new disc. This hypothesis led to the experiment in which ROS plasma membranes were separated from discs for the purpose of determining in which compartment the galactose-containing rhodopsin was most prevalent. The experiments showed that the greatest preponderance of the galactose-containing rhodopsin was in the plasma membrane component. This finding lends support to the hypothesis that a transiently present galactose is important in new disc formation in bovine and rat retinas because the galactose appears to be associated with the plasma membrane until the discs are finally fused. This proposed mechanism would not specifically require galactose as the substrate, only that the components of the oligosaccharide, however they may vary among species, be the substrates of the appropriate hydrolases.",
