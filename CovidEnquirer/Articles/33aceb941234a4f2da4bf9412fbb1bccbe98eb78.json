A total of 512.05 million livestock are present in India and most of these are reared by landless and marginal farmers and are the main source of their livelihood. Besides, organized sectors have also started showing interest in livestock farming; mainly in poultry and dairy sectors but their numbers are very small at the present. As livestock sector is a live market, they are very susceptible to different infectious diseases such as viral, bacterial, fungal, and parasitic diseases. These infectious diseases are posing a threat to the livestock production performance due to morbidity and mortality. Therefore keeping the livestock healthy to get better production is of paramount importance to agricultural economy. Vaccination of the animals against various infectious diseases prevailing in different geographical regions is the key measure of good husbandry practices and contributes a major role in maintaining animal health and minimizing economic losses due to production losses from infectious diseases.",

Around a century after him, Luis Pasteur made three vaccines for rabies, fowl cholera, and anthrax through the process of attenuation. Further, in 1886 Daniel Elmer Salmon and Theobald Smith gave the concept of inactivated or killed vaccine. Presently most of the vaccines used for immunization of animals or humans are either live or inactivated in nature. The conventional veterinary vaccines protect animals against the potential dangers of many infectious diseases. It stimulates the animal's immune system and prepares them to resist the infections caused by pathogenic microorganisms. Vaccination is the most effective way to prevent the transmission and the spread of animal disease epidemics which subsequently provide full security and public health.",

Vaccines against other diseases like brucellosis, rabies, foot and mouth disease (FMD) are being used as the main instruments in the eradication program of the respective diseases globally.

Various developments have taken place with regard to types of vaccines and methods of immunization. However, it is only during the last two decades where the veterinary world has observed significant development of novel prophylactics which are facilitated by the advent of biotechnological tools and techniques, and discovery of antigen/gene delivery systems or recombinant vaccines developed using biotechnological tools or genetic engineering represents an alternative strategy by which the limitations of conventional vaccines are taken care of. A number of genetically-engineered vaccines which are rationally designed such as, live flavivirus chimera vaccine (WN-FV) (PreveNile), live double-gene deleted [deleted glycoprotein E (gE 2 ) and deleted thymidine kinase (tk 2 )] bovine herpesirus type 1 strain (Hiprabovis IBR Marker), and feline immune deficiency vaccine (Fel-O-Vax) have already been introduced in the veterinary market.",

The vaccine against all pathogens is not available as there are some existing limitations in developed vaccines or difficulties in vaccine development. Reasons for unavailability of vaccines for certain diseases include that either it is not technically possible to develop vaccines that provide adequate protection against the etiological agent or it is not possible to develop safe and effective vaccines, or it may become ineffective in a short duration as pathogens change their characteristics. The vaccination cannot always be a universal option for control of animal epidemics. Many countries have vaccines against most viral or bacterial diseases but lack vaccines against parasitic diseases.

The objective of \"one health\" is to promote multisectoral response to food safety hazards, the risk from zoonotic diseases and its control (disease that can spread between animals and humans, e.g., rabies, West Nile fever, salmonella, and flu) (Vandersmissen and Welburn, 2014; Buttigieg, 2015) .

            "text": "Antibiotic resistance is the major concern in both veterinary and human medicine and arose due to excessive and indiscriminate application of antibiotics in treatment and as a feed additive in food animals. There are limited numbers of effective antibiotics for treatment against bacterial diseases but the possibilities of getting resistant against these are still a concern. Vaccine acts on the bacteria by eliciting host-immune response either through humoral or cellmediated immunity and there is no possibility to get resistance against host immunity (Vandersmissen and Welburn, 2014; Hoelzer et al., 2018) . Therefore vaccination is a safe and effective method to prevent bacterial infection in animals and humans. Bacterial vaccines minimize the treatment cost in food producing and companion animals which also involves the least use of antibiotics. Availability of inexpensive vaccines may reduce reliance on antibiotics for animal health. Live-attenuated vaccine is a live microorganism with very little or no pathogenicity which cannot cause disease but has the ability to induce protective immunity. Generally, they are produced by serial passages of agents in unnatural or heterologous hosts or cell lines and sometimes distant relative of pathogenic microorganisms which are not pathogenic to the target host . Viruses acquire random mutations in their genome after multiple serial passages in heterologous systems leading to loss of pathogenicity without compromise in immunogenicity (Meeusen et al., 2007) . They are able to replicate in the host and induce both cellular and humoral immunity. The immunity generated by live vaccines persist a longer duration and there is no need for adjuvant (van Gelder and Makoschey, 2012; Jorge and Dellagostin, 2017) . The limitations of live vaccines are adverse reaction and reversion of virulence inside the host. Besides, they have less shelf-life and are sensitive to high temperature. Therefore they require cold chain or refrigeration for storage and transportation. Examples: Brucella abortus S-19, Peste-des-petits ruminants virus vaccine, sheeppox vaccine, canine parvovirus vaccine, canine distemper vaccine, Newcastle vaccine, etc.",

Compared to conventional vaccines, these vaccines are safe to administer, nonreplicating, easy to produce, cost effective, and have no deleterious effect due to unwanted antigenic materials. They can be made by isolating antigenic protein(s) from any infectious organism after its disruption. This type of strategy is common in aviral subunit vaccine called split vaccine. The recombinant subunit vaccines are made by identification and selection of protective antigen gene coding region followed by their cloning in suitable vector and expression in a heterologous host system such as bacteria, yeast, mammalian and insect. Escherichia coli is used extensively for protein expression as heterologous host besides limitation in the form of yield, posttranslational modification and folding of expressed recombinant proteins. The limitations of E. coli expression system were improved by the introduction of methylotropic yeast (Pichia pastoris) which has the capacity of posttranslational modification and folding of expressed recombinant proteins. Since the subunit vaccines induce less immunity in comparison to whole bacteria or viral vaccine, they are used with a suitable adjuvant. Examples of such include Newcastle disease virus (NDV) subunit vaccine using hemagglutinin-neuraminidase (HN) gene, FMDV subunit vaccine using VP-1 gene, porcine circovirus type-2 (PCV-2) subunit vaccine based on open reading frame-2 (commercialized) and prM, and E envelope proteinbased subunit vaccine of Japanese encephalitis.",

Currently, the canary poxvirus vector system has been used for vaccines against rabies virus, canine distemper virus, feline leukemia virus, and equine influenza virus. The bacterial recombinant BCG has significant potential to express a large number of antigens and can induce solid immunity. The use of transgenic plants engineered to produce and deliver immunogenic antigens via food sources has potential perspective in vaccine industries. In veterinary vaccinology, transgenic plants are able to produce and deliver antigens through animal feed.

In addition to a desired exogenous antigenic gene, the plasmid contains a strong eukaryotic promoter, polyA tail, multiple cloning sites, and suitable selective marker. The basic aim of DNA vaccine system is that the antigen can be expressed directly by the cells of the host in a way similar to that occurring during viral infection and expressed antigen after processing will be represented either via major histocompatibility complex-I or major histocompatibility complex-II leading to cellular and humoral immune responses (Shi et al., 2014; Meeusen et al., 2007) . They are easy to manufacture, have low cost, and do not require cold chain facility. DNA vaccines were administrated either by intramuscular (I/M) injection or using a DNA particle delivery system called gene gun. Immunization of animals with DNA vaccine is comparatively safer than the use of other conventional vaccines as later unnecessarily expose the host to a wide variety of antigen . However, there is concern regarding possible integration of DNA in the host genome and might be inactivation of a tumor suppressor gene. A few examples of DNA vaccines are West Nile virus vaccine (first approved DNA vaccine), influenza virus DNA vaccine (passed clinical trial for ponies), and feline immune deficiency virus.",

Around two to three decades ago the veterinary vaccines used were mostly live attenuated, inactivated vaccines and toxoid but with recent advances in immunology and molecular biology, and sophisticated forms of genetically-engineered vaccines have been introduced. Although, live-attenuated vaccines are able to induce both cellular and humoral immune responses, they also can produce some side effects. Killed/inactivated vaccines are typically safer but may be less effective than attenuated vaccines whereas, commercial vaccines based on toxoids are difficult to produce.

Efforts to develop more effective vaccines against a large number of diseases using genetic engineering are in progress around the world. Genetically-engineered or recombinant vaccines are developed based on rationally designed recombinant and highly purified antigens through epitopes mapping and their prediction. Currently, a number of subunit or vectored veterinary vaccines using biotechnological tool have been commercialized ( Hemorrhagic septicemia (HS), an acute and highly fatal disease of cattle and buffalo, is caused by Pasteurella multocida. HS occurs as catastrophic epizootics in many Asian and African countries, resulting in high mortality and morbidity (De Alwis, 1992; Verma and Jaiswal, 1998) . Although, antibiotics is the main therapeutic to treat the disease and control the incidence of such microbial infection, remains of antibiotics in animal products and antibiotic resistance are the drawback of antibiotics use. The other alternative to control and prevention of HS is by vaccination of animals in endemic areas prior to the expected outbreak of HS. Immunity generated in HS is serotype-specific therefore selection of vaccine candidates depend upon circulating serotypes in that geographical regions. Various strategies have been used to develop HS vaccines such as killed vaccines (bacterins), live-attenuated, cellular vaccines, and genetically-engineered vaccines (Myint et al., 1987; Verma and Jaiswal, 1998; Hodgson et al., 2005) . But killed vaccines are used commonly for the vaccination against HS. Bacterins used against HS include formalized bacterin, aluminum hydroxide gel, and oil adjuvant vaccines (OIE, 2017) . Among these, aluminum hydroxide gel vaccine and oil adjuvant vaccines elicit a good immune response in the studies conducted in many Asian countries including India during the last few years, and are the vaccine of choice.",

Disease has wide host range and it is primarily caused by Brucella abortus and Brucella melitensis in large (cattle) and small ruminant (goat) respectively (OIE, 2017) . Abortions in late gestation, placentitis, epididymitis, and orchitis are the most common consequences. Direct or indirect contact and consumption of products from infected animals act as a source of human brucellosis. Therefore WHO, OIE, and other agencies collectively set a plan under one health program to control the brucellosis. Animal brucellosis can be prevented by applying good managemental and hygienic practices. Countries having a low prevalence of brucellosis are following the test and slaughter policy while it is not economical in highly endemic counties and vaccination is the only option. Currently, liveattenuated B. abortus strain 19 and RB-51 are used for immunization of cattle while B. melitensis Rev 1 is used for sheep and goat (Moriy\u00f3n et al., 2004; Corbel, 2006) . Most of the countries are using B. abortus strain 19 to immunize cattle because of its high protective efficacy, although it induces abortion in pregnant animals and is not capable of DIVA. While RB-51 is not abortogenic and capable of DIVA strategy due to lack of O-antigen of LPS and has similar protective efficacy. New generation vaccine strains based on attenuation organism, protein subunit, and DNA fragments were also tested experimentally to get safer vaccines (Golshani and Buozari, 2017) but none of them are yet commercialized for immunization purpose. Further, killed B. abortus 45/20 and B. melitensis H38 are also available but are less protective (Schurig et al., 2002; Plommet et al., 1970) .",

Bovine paratuberculosis is an infectious, granulomatous disease leading to loss of animal health while paratuberculosis (Johne's disease) is clinically characterized with chronic shooting diarrhea and emaciation (Gilardoni et al., 2012) . Both diseases are collectively causing huge economic loss of the dairy industry worldwide. M. bovis also causes infection in human beings and is one of the major zoonosis concerns of the present time (Grang, 2001) . Besides, M. tuberculosis, a pathogen of humans may also infect domestic animals and these infected animals become the source of its further transmission to other susceptible animals and human beings. This phenomenon is called reverse zoonosis. Mycobacterial infection shows synergism with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection in human beings and HIV/M. tuberculosis (dangerous couple model) copandemic is occurring and claiming million of lives each year (Shankar et al., 2014). Crohn's disease, a chronic inflammatory intestinal condition of human beings is considered to be caused by M. avium subsp. paratuberculosis. Good management practices and test and slaughter policy are used for the control and prevention of these diseases in bovines. The efficacy of a live vaccine made from the attenuated strain of M. bovis, BCG has proven variable and use of this vaccine might hinder the interpretation of current diagnostic tests (Balseiro et al., 2017; Cousins, 2001) .",

In bovine, the disease is characterized by septicemia, acute or chronic enteritis and abortions (Kemal, 2014) . Bovine salmonellosis is caused by Salmonella Dublin and Salmonella typhimurium. Salmonellosis has a significant economic impact on dairy and beef farming due to poor quality of milk and meat (McEvoy et al., 2003) . Besides, it also possesses human health concerns due to the consumption of contaminated meat and milk, and close contact of the animal's handlers and veterinarians. Further, Salmonella isolates particularly S. typhimurium definitive type 104 and have develops resistance to multiple antibiotics and can act as donor for resistant determinant to other opportunistic bacteria found as commensal in intestine (Piddock, 2002) . Therefore to avoid possibility of evolution of new resistant bacteria and disease manifestation in animals and humans, vaccination is the most important tool along with good animal husbandry practices. Both inactivated and modified live (MLV) Salmonella vaccines are licensed for immunization of cattle (Danielle, 2006; Adem and Bushra, 2016) . Most of the inactivated commercial vaccines are bivalent in nature and have S. Dublin and S. typhimurium formulated with suitable adjuvant (aluminum hydroxide). A genetically-altered aroA mutant S. Dublin live vaccine is also used for immunization of farm animals in different developed countries (Duncan et al., 1987) . Further, gram-negative core antigen bacterins such as ENDOVAC-Bovi (S. typhimurium lacking polysaccharide repeat of LPS) and J5 or J5-VAC (LPS core antigen made from mutant strain of E. coli) are commercially available, and it is claiming that they can cross protect animals from other endotoxin-producing bacteria such as E. coli, Salmonella, P. multocida, and Manheimia hemolytica.",

Besides, infected animals are also a potential source for human infections. ETEC infection is a noninvasive type of gastrointestinal infection, and mucosal immunity plays an important role in colonization of these bacteria. Therefore killed bacteria with fimbria or extracted fimbria with or without LT toxoid (heat labile enterotoxin) are used for immunization of dams before parturition. Commercial vaccines for cows include E. coli F5 isolates or F5 adhesin while purified F4, F5, F6, or F41 fimbria or killed E. coli expressing these fimbriae with or without LT toxoid are used for immunization of sows. Further, liveattenuated, oral subunit vaccine having purified fimbria and poly (lactide co glycolide) (PLGA)-encapsulated fimbria or live vaccine was also evaluated for prevention of colonization (Edelman et al., 1993) . For prevention of EHEC, whole bacteria, adhesin-intimin, fimbria, type III secretion system were tried (Smith, 2014) (Jamal and Belsham, 2013; Poonsuk et al., 2018) . The disease is characterized by high fever, lameness, formation of blister on mucosa of mouth, tongue, teats, and hoof. The disease has high morbidity and low mortality and affects all age groups of cattle. Due to high morbidity, the disease causes massive production loss and is considered as an economically important disease and a threat to livestock production worldwide. For the control of disease, virus (harvested from BHK-21 cell line) inactivated with binary-ethyleneimine is formulated with saponin/aluminum hydroxide or various oil-based adjuvant is used to potentiate the protective immune response in susceptible animals (Grubman and Baxt, 2004) . Immunity induces by one serotype or subtype does not protect animals from other serotypes or subtypes of FMDV infection. Therefore which serotype or subtype is used as a vaccine candidate depends on the circulating FMDV type in that geographical areas/ countries. In India, trivalent vaccine having \"O, Asia-1 and A\" serotypes are being used for vaccination of cattle and buffaloes (Jamal and Belsham, 2013) . Different FMDV eradication programs were launched in various countries, and disease was successfully eliminated from Western Europe and part of South America. But, the disease is still circulating in most parts of the world and posing a constant threat to dairy husbandry. Further, low quality vaccines, the simultaneous presence of various circulating types of FMDV in different countries and wildlife reservoir (African buffalo) are the main constraints in the control and eradication of this dreaded disease.",

It is associated with exposure of rabid animals, and incubation period of the disease depends on the extent of bite, site of bite from the brain, and quantum of virus entered by saliva at the bite wound (Blanton et al., 2009 ). The disease is reported from all the geographical areas of the world except Antarctica and has around 100% mortality in humans and animals. Over the last 100 years, a number of vaccines such as inactivated, MLV, and recombinant have been developed for the control and prevention of disease (Muller et al., 2001; Xiang et al., 2003; Singh et al., 2017) . The neural origin vaccines have been discontinued due to their adverse effects and use of animals for the propagation of the virus. Nowadays modern vaccines, cell culture, and embryonated egg-based inactivated vaccines (Beta-propiolactone) are being used prophylactically (preexposure) and therapeutically (postexposure) to protect humans and animals against rabies (Singh et al., 2017) . These modern vaccines are now available in most developing countries and have been successful to minimize the number of human exposures. Further, recombinant vaccines lack residual pathogenicity caused by rabies because they contain only single nonvirulent gene products. Various vectors such as animal poxvirus, human and canine adenoviruses encoding rabies virus glycoprotein G have been tested in different targets (dog, cat, fox, and raccoon) and nontarget wild animals via oral route (rabbit, deer, etc.). Among these vaccines, a vaccinia-based recombinant vaccine is used for immunization of wild animals as edible bait and are playing an important role in the prevention of rabies virus from wild animals to other domestic animals and humans (Yang et al., 2013) . The oral vaccines are Raboral V-RG (vaccinia recombinant virus expressing G protein) and with Rabigen SAG2 (double mutant avirulent strain SAG2).",

The disease may spread in a flock through the introduction of newly purchased sick animals from the market. The disease has a serious economic impact in terms of high morbidity and mortality as well as reduces production ability. Vaccination is the most effective way to control PPR. An earlier practice to control the disease was to immunize the animals with Plowright's live-attenuated tissue culture rinderpest vaccine (heterologous vaccine) but its use was stopped due to hindrance in the serosurveillance of rinderpest . Further, homologous PPR virus was used after passage in vero cell line. Presently, Nigeria75/1 strain of Africa, Sungri-96 strain isolated from goats developed by IVRI, Mukteswar or Arasur-87 strain of peste-des-petits ruminants (PPRV) isolated from sheep by TANUVAS are used for immunization of goat and sheep (Diallo et al., 1989 Palaniswami et al., 2005; Singh et al., 2004) .

The disease is transmitted by Culicoides species and affects mostly sheep, goats, and rarely cattle (Chand et al., 2015; Mayo et al., 2017) . The disease is prevalent in rainy seasons. For the control of disease besides management practice as well as vector control, immunization of susceptible animals is a more effective strategy. Presently, MLV vaccine and inactivated vaccines are used for the control of the disease in various continents of the world (Bhanuprakash et al., 2009; Chand et al., 2015) . As the immunity in BTV is serotype-specific and there are so many circulating serotypes in a geographical area at a time, the vaccine formulation is very difficult and challenging. Because of this reason, multivalent vaccines are used for immunization of animals. MLV vaccine produces viremia in animals which leads to further transmission of the virus and causes abortion, therefore this vaccine is generally not recommended for vaccination. Most of the countries are using inactivated BTV virus using BEI and hydroxylamine (Ramakrishnan et al., 2006) . Presently in India pentavalent vaccine having BTV-1, 2, 10, 16, and 23 serotypes are used for the vaccination (Reddy et al., 2010) . VLP-based genetically-engineered vaccine was also attempted but due to serotype-specific immunity and genetic drift in serotypes, this strategy was not successful (Chand et al., 2015) .",

In a susceptible herd, morbidity and mortality are 75%\u00c0100% and 10%\u00c085% respectively depending upon virulence of infecting virus strains. Most strains are host-specific and cause severe clinical manifestations in sheep or goat while some strains are equally virulent in both sheep and goats. For the prevention of disease both live-attenuated and inactivated vaccines are available, however inactivated vaccine provides a short duration of protection (Bhanuprakash et al., 2012; Boumart et al., 2016) . Liveattenuated vaccine elicits long-term protection against SPV and GPV but its use is limited due to stimulation of pock lesion or death for some animals. Usually, the homologous vaccination strategy is useful for the protection of animals and locally prevalent strains are used as vaccine strains for immunization of sheep and goats (Rao and Bandyopadhyay, 2000) . In India, live-attenuated vaccine incorporated with RM-65 strain for sheep pox and Uttarkashi strain of goat pox is currently used for immunization of sheep and goats, respectively (Madhavan et al., 2016) .",

Generally, JEV maintained in a natural cycle between mosquitoes and water bird, and pig acts as an amplifying host (Yun and Lee, 2014) . Accidentally, at peak of mosquitoes' prevalence in rainy seasons, the virus also infects dead-end hosts; human and horse due to mosquitoes' bite.

Both inactivated and live-attenuated vaccines are available for pigs, horses, and humans. MLV [produced in hamster or swine kidney tissue culture or hamster lung (HmLu) cell line] and inactivated (prepared in mouse brain, chicken embryo eggs, or cell lines, e.g., vero cells) are used for immunization of pigs and horses (Basu and Dutta, 2017) .

The disease is enlisted in the OIE. The disease is caused by bovine viral diarrhea virus-1 (BVDV-1) and bovine viral diarrhea virus-2 (BVDV-2) belong to genus Pestivirus of Flaviviridae family. At present at least 21 (BVDV-1a\u00c01u) and 4 (BVDV2a\u00c02d) subgenotypes of BVDV-1 and BVDV-2, respectively have been identified. On the basis of cytopathic effect on cell culture, each genotype is further classified into cytopathic (CP) and noncytopathic (NCP) biotypes. The clinical infections are of, acute and transient infection in immune-compromised cattle and persistent infection in new born calf when the virus infects the dam in the first trimester of gestation (before the development of the immune system) and chronic infection due to the invasion of virus in immune-privileged sites. The persistently infected (PI) animals act as a major source of disease transmission in the herd due to constant shedding of virus from all secretions. Economic impact in terms of reduction in milk yield, loss of fetus due abortion, still-birth, mummification, and low body score, led various countries to start a control program to curtail and eradicate the disease from the livestock population. In order to control and prevent, prophylactic vaccination of susceptible animals and test and culling strategy depending upon seroprevalence of disease, cattle density, and trade has been adopted in European countries and results were quite convincing. The primary goal of prophylactic vaccination against BVDV is to protect the fetus from in-utero infection to avoid birth of new PI calves. Both MLV and inactivated vaccines are used for immunization of animals (Beer et al., 2000) . It is considered that inactivated vaccine is safer than MLV and therefore MLV vaccine is not recommended to pregnant animals in their first 6 months. In contrast to NCP biotypes, most modern modified-live vaccines use CP biotypes of BVDV as these types of virus are not able to establish persistent infection in fetus. A Npro gene deleted and endoribonuclease activity inactivated NCP BVDV mutant was developed to deal with safety concerns which is not able to cross the placenta and provides immunity similar to field type BVDV. Marker vaccines based on glycoprotein E-2 expressed in baculovirus or transgenic plant and BVDV E-2 DNA vaccines have also been evaluated for immune response (Thomas et al., 2013) . Recently, truncated glycoprotein E-2 fused with single chain antibody (APCH) subunit vaccine (Pecora et al., 2015) (Vedevax) expressed in baculovirus was commercialized for field use. Protective immune response in BVDV is genotype-specific and is not effective in conferring cross-protection to heterologous genotypes. Therefore vaccine formulations require either one or both genotypes depending upon the prevalence of BVDV in a particular continent or geographical strata. To address this aforementioned problem, a novel mosaic polypeptide chimeras having three protective determinants; of BVDV-1a, BVDV-1b and BVDV-2 genotypes using adenovirus vector construct (adBVDV prototype vaccine) was evaluated and found better immunogenic with heterologous protection (Lokhandwala et al., 2017) .",

Bovine herpesvirus-1 (BoHV-1), a member of alphaherpesevirus is the etiological agent of IBR. This virus also causes infectious pustular vulvovaginitis in cows and infectious pustular balanoposthitis in bulls. Latency inside sensory ganglion is the most unique feature of BoHV-1 which is also seen in other herpes viral infections. Latent animals become clinically infected once again due to recrudescence of virus by stressful stimuli and subsequent reexcretion of infectious virus acts as a source of infection for other susceptible animals of the herd. It is a major economic problem in dairy and beef industries of the world due to huge production losses in the form of reduced milk yield, abortion, and less weight gain. The biosecurity, test and culling, and prophylactic immunization are used for control of the disease. Around 200 vaccines have been licensed for immunization against IBR worldwide. Among these most are conventional types (nonmarker) while very few are marker types. Conventional vaccines include either live or inactivated BoHV-1 strain while marker vaccines are gene deleted type mutants. Glycoprotein E, thymidine kinase (tk) gene or both, nonessential genes for virus replication, are targets of deletion from BoHV-1 virus and are well suited for DIVA. A double-gene deleted (gE 2 and tk 2 ) Bovine Herpes Virus type 1 vaccine is commercially available (van Engelenburg et al., 1994) . These vaccines are effective in preventing clinical disease and reducing virus transmission but are not able to prevent infection from field virus. Most of the European countries have banned the use of conventional live vaccine and are strictly using marker vaccines for effective protection and serosurveillance with the aim of disease eradication. Majority of these vaccines are licensed for immunization of pregnant animals. Most of these vaccines are licensed for use in the United States or European countries and manufactured by Zoetis UK, MSD Animal Health and Laboratorios Hipra, Spain.",

            "text": "Influenza in domestic animals is caused by members of genus influenza virus A and most of have a zoonotic impact worldwide. Influenza virus A infects bird (both domestic and wild), pig, horse, dog, seal, whales, including human (Webster et al., 1992) . Avian influenza, swine influenza, equine influenza, and canine influenza are the most common types of influenza virus A infection in birds, pigs, equines, and canines, respectively (Webster et al., 1992; Yoo et al., 2018) . At present 16 hemagglutinin (HA) and 9 neuraminidase (NA) subtypes have been recognized, while 2 additional HA and NA subtypes have been identified in bats and these subtypes can form thousands of antigenic combination (Gamblin and Skehel, 2010; Ciminski et al., 2017) . Influenza virus A subtypes; H7N7and H3N8 cause respiratory disease in horses, H1N1, H1N2 and H3N8 cause influenza in swine, H3N8 and H3N2 cause respiratory implications in dogs (Yoo et al., 2018) . Generally, all genetic combinations are reported from the domestic or wild bird that causes respiratory and systemic implication, but detection of H5 and H7 are prime importance due to their high virulence (Harfoot and Webby, 2017). In humans historically endemic H1N1, H2N2, H3N2, and more recently sporadic or limited H5N1, H7N3, H7N7, and H9N2 viruses caused respiratory diseases while H3N2 and H1N1 are currently circulating subtypes (Yoo et al., 2018) . Avian influenza on the basis of the presence of single or several basic amino acids at the cleavage site in haemagglutinin are classified into low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI) and highly pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) virus . Both types affect different avian species but wild and migratory birds act as a reservoir of LPAI. OIE has defined avian influenza as \"an infection of poultry caused by any influenza A virus with HPAI and by H5 and H7 subtypes with low pathogenicity (H5/H7 LPAI).\" Affected birds exhibit varying clinical manifestations from mild to severe respiratory, nervous, gastrointestinal, and reproductive system disease and sometimes birds are dead without any clinical appearance (Horby, 2014) . Further, LPAI viruses also cause a considerable loss due to anorexia, respiratory signs, reduce egg production, and less weight gain. OIE recommended eradication of HPAI virus from poultry due to severe economic consequences in poultry industries in terms of reduced egg production, low quality of eggs, mortality, and evolution of new antigenic mutants via antigenic shift and drift posing a threat to humans. In addition to the controlled elimination of infected poultry, strict biosecurity, restriction on movement and purchase of birds, and good hygiene in the poultry farm, vaccination of birds is also followed. Currently inactivated mono and bivalent vaccines having H5 and H7 strains and live recombinant vaccines (fowlpox-H5) are available for immunization of poultry (Swayne, 2012) . The reverse genetic-based recombinant H5N1 vaccine was also evaluated in mice and found to be a promising candidate vaccine against HPAI in poultry (Sedova et al., 2012; Lee and Song, 2013) . Swine influenza is another economically important disease caused by influenza virus A and affects the pork industry due to the significant reduction in growth rate and public health misperception about eating of pork. Besides, H1N1 is the most common flu which affects humans worldwide and causes mortality. Good management practices in swine farming and use of vaccines can limit the swine influenza and consequently the possibility of human transmission. Most of the available licensed vaccines have inactivated whole virus of H1 or H3 subtypes. For immunization of pigs bivalent vaccine having H1N1 and H3N2 are used through I/M route and are protective to antigenically identical or similar strains. Recently intranasal poly I: C adjuvanted vaccine was found more protective compared to conventional vaccines (Kim et al., 2015) . Further polyvalent vaccines containing multiple H1 and H3 clusters were commercialized with the goal of protection from new emerging antigenic cluster within subtypes of H1 and H3 (MaxiVac Excell 5.0, Merck Animal Health, Summit, NJ, USA; FluSure XP, Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ, USA). New generation vaccines based on reverse genetic strategy to make attenuated-live vaccine, DNA vaccine, subunit vaccine, and vectored 5 based vaccine were also evaluated experimentally for immunization of pigs but only alphavirus-like replicon particles (RP) having gene encoding the HA of a cluster IV H3N2 virus was licensed for pig use (\"Swine Influenza Vaccine, RNA\"; Harris vaccines, Ames, IA, USA) (Abente et al., 2019) .",

Bovine rotavirus (BRV) affects calves of 2\u00c08 weeks of age and its susceptibility decreases as age progresses. Clinical manifestation in each species is similar ranging from asymptomatic subclinical condition to severe enteritis. Clinically calves suffer from acute, watery, dehydrating diarrhea and may succumb to infection. The morbidity and mortality are very high, leading to huge economical losses in dairy and beef industries worldwide. Mucosal immunity plays a major role to inhibit intestinal infections by any infectious pathogen and it is transferred from the dam to new young ones via colostrum feeding. Therefore if the pregnant dam is immunized with a rotavirus vaccine sufficiently, she can transfer antirotavirus maternal antibodies in surplus to protect calves sufficiently long duration. Both conventional and new generation vaccine such as subunit, DNA vaccine, VLP, plant-based edible vaccine (used VP-4, VP-6, or capsid protein), reverse geneticbased vaccine and recombinant BCG expressing VP-6 gene were evaluated to generate protective immunity (Poelaert et al., 2018; Chen et al., 2012) . Commercially attenuated strains of BRV and coronavirus (Galf Guard, Zoetis, USA, PBS animal health, United States) are used to immunize calves and adult cattle. Inactivated BRV (serotypes G6 and G10) and coronavirus propagated on established cell lines and a K99 E. coli bacterin formulated with adjuvant (scourGuard, Zoetis, USA, MSD animal health) are used to immunize pregnant cattle and heifers.

Transmission of T. parva and T. annulata are through Rhipicephalus appendiculatus ticks, occurs in eastern and southern Africa, and by Hyalomma ticks, occurs around the Mediterranean basin, north-east Africa, the Middle East, India, and southern Asia, respectively. African buffalo and Asian buffalo are also susceptible to T. parva and T. annulata, respectively. Theileria species cause acute lymphoproliferative disease with a high level of morbidity and mortality and economic losses (Sivakumar et al., 2014) . For control of the disease, acaricides and buparvaquone (therapeutic compound) are used but due to regular use of acaricides and the high cost of buparvaquone, the overall control and treatment are very expensive. Besides, drug resistant T. annulata is also reported recently. Vaccination is the only sustainable alternative of these limitations (Nene and Morrison, 2016) . Immunization with T. parva and T. annulata infected cell line as live vaccines were attempted but found to be noneconomical. A live vaccine having infectious sporozoites was developed. Because of limitations in live vaccines, other alternatives were searched to develop subunit and viral-vectored vaccines based on the use of defined antigens of sporozoite (Knight et al., 1996) and schizont (Goh et al., 2016) developmental stages. But at present only live vaccines against both T. parva and T. annulata based on sporozoites are used to immunize the animals.",

For control of coccidia in poultry farm, prophylactic use of anticoccidial drugs were followed since long and still are the preferred method. But the problem is the quick development of resistance against available anticoccidial drugs and requirement of new drugs. In addition to chemotherapy, vaccination is also used to protect chickens (Tewari and Maharana, 2011) . Most commonly used vaccines for immunization of chickens are live oocysts either from attenuated or nonattenuated strains of coccidian (Chapman and Jeffers, 2014) . Nonattenuated live vaccines have variable numbers of wild coccidian strains depending upon their use in broiler breeders (up to eight strains, Coccivac-D, and Immucox-C2), or broiler industries (up to four strains Coccivac-B, Immucox-C1) but the main risk is development of severe reaction in vaccinated poultry. The live-attenuated oocysts vaccine strains (Paracox and HatchPak CocciIII) have fewer vaccines-induced risks (Price, 2012) . Indigenous live-attenuated quadrivalent coccidia vaccine having Eimeria tenella, E. acervulina, E. maxima, and E. necatrix (LivacoxQ, Hester) is available in India. DNA recombinant technology was also used to develop a recombinant vaccine based on an immunodominant portion of proteins of various stages either of sporozoites or merozoites or gametes of Eimeria species (Tewari and Maharana, 2011) .

            "text": "The poultry market is the biggest market in livestock sectors, as poultry farming such as chickens require less time to attain marketable age, produce nearly one egg each day, and require less investment. Chickens are reared mainly for broiler (meat) and layer (eggs) purposes. Along with nutritional and housing management, good health is of paramount importance to achieve better growth rates in broilers and to get good quality eggs from layers throughout year. Poultry are susceptible to many infectious diseases such as infectious bursal disease, infectious bronchitis, infectious laryngotracheitis, Marek's disease, Newcastle disease, Fowl pox, avian influenza, fowl cholera, fowl typhoid, bacillary white diarrhea, chronic respiratory disease, and coccidiosis, etc. (Deshmukh et al., 2015; Jordan, 2017; Garc\u00eda, 2017; Yuan et al., 2018; Alkie and Rautenschlein, 2016; Wua et al., 2011; Reddy et al., 2016) . Morbidity and mortality caused by the pathogens are very high leading to negative impact on production and human welfare due to shortage of food supply. These diseases could be controlled by immunization of poultry flocks with negligible expense on each bird. For immunization of poultry conventional (inactivated and live) and biotechnological or genetic engineering (subunit, vectored, DNA, and VLP) tools have been employed to develop effective vaccines. But, availability of recombinant (biotechnological based) vaccines for field use are very limited as most of them are in different phases of clinical trials or have some quality control issues. At present either inactivated or live-attenuated vaccines are being used for mass immunization of poultry flocks. The susceptibility toward different diseases depends on the age of birds. Therefore two types of vaccination schedule are recommended for poultry flocks, namely for boilers and layers (Table 20 .3). ",

Adverse effects caused by vaccines may be transient or for longer duration and can be caused either by antigens or adjuvants present in vaccines. Generally the side reaction is associated with live vaccine but killed vaccine also in some cases can cause a reaction. Latent infections can be caused by a certain vaccine virus, that is, herpesvirus vaccines. In some cases animal may fail to respond to vaccine or it may be excreting vaccine virus or bacteria in their secretion and excretion such as BVDV and Brucella vaccines. Sometimes MLV BTV vaccines regain virulence inside the host/vectors leading to development of clinical manifestations and raising the concern about possibilities of genetic assortment between vaccine and wild viruses. Feline leukemia virus vaccine at the injection site in leg causes development of a lump which regresses within few days but sometimes cats suffer with a lethal cancerous condition called fibrosarcoma. Rabies vaccines also lead fibrosarcoma development at inoculation site in cats similar to feline leukemia vaccines. Other common side effects include: transient swelling at the site of injection, coughing, fever, anaphylaxis, respiratory distress, salivation, vomiting, diarrhea, urticaria, reduced fertility, abortion, and fetal abnormalities.",
