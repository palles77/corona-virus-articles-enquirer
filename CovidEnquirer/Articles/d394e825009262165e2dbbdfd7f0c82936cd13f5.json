In this observational study, we systematically applied currently approved diagnostic techniques in patients hospitalized for CAP in order to determine the proportion in which an etiological agent could be identified. Methods: All patients admitted with findings consistent with CAP were included. Sputum and blood cultures, urine tests for pneumococcal and Legionella antigens, nasopharyngeal swab for viral PCR, and serum procalcitonin were obtained in nearly every case. Admissionrelated electronic medical records were reviewed in entirety. Results: By final clinical diagnosis, 44 patients (17.0%) were uninfected. A causative bacterium was identified in only 60 (23.2%) cases. PCR identified a respiratory virus in 42 (16.2%), 12 with documented bacterial coinfection. In 119 (45.9%), no cause for CAP was found; 69 (26.6%) of these had a syndrome indistinguishable from bacterial pneumonia. Procalcitonin was elevated in patients with bacterial infection and low in uninfected patients or those with viral infection, but with substantial overlap. Conclusions: Only 23.2% of 259 patients admitted with a CAP syndrome had documented bacterial infection; another 26.6% had no identified bacterial etiology, but findings closely resembled those of bacterial infection. Nevertheless, all 259 received antibacterial therapy. Journal of Infection (2013) 67, 11e18 Careful attention to the clinical picture may identify uninfected patients or those with viral infection, perhaps with reassurance by a non-elevated procalcitonin. Determining an etiologic diagnosis remains elusive. Better discriminators of bacterial infection are sorely needed. Published by Elsevier Ltd on behalf of The British Infection Association.",

Recent guidelines 1 recommend that antibiotics be administered empirically at the point of care when the diagnosis of CAP is first made.",

A CAP syndrome was defined as a newly recognized pulmonary infiltrate together with !2 of the following findings: subjective fever or documented temperature !99.4 F, increased cough, sputum production, or shortness of breath, pleuritic chest pain, confusion, rales, leukocytosis (white blood count [WBC] >12,000/mm 3 ), or a suppressed WBC count (<6000/mm 3 ). 1,10,11 All patients had CAP as one of the admitting diagnoses, and, in fact, all received antibiotic therapy in the Emergency Department, although this was not required for inclusion in the study.

Use of multiplex PCR for pneumococcal capsular polysaccharide on urine might have slightly increased this yield. 26, 27 Secular trends 21 may have led to a reduction in the prevalence of S. pneumoniae as a cause of pneumonia. Widespread use of pneumococcal polysaccharide vaccine in our population (about 85% of eligible patients served by MED-VAMC have been vaccinated) and conjugate vaccine in children in Houston (about 95% uptake in infants and toddlers) has certainly reduced the frequency of pneumococcal disease in adults by direct and indirect effects. 28 Pneumococcal colonies may be difficult to detect on blood agar plates because of the prevalence of other alpha-hemolytic streptococci. In contrast, laboratory identification of other potential pulmonary pathogens e e.g. S. aureus, H. influenzae, or Gram negative bacilli e is relatively easy. If pneumococci are not responsible for many of the cases of CAP and these other bacteria are not identified, then it is unclear what organisms are responsible. One wonders whether it could be mixed respiratory flora.

Another 17% had a viral infection, one-quarter of whom had a secondary bacterial infection. Although, with current PCR technology, it is relatively simple to detect viral infection, it can be much more difficult to exclude the presence of a secondary bacterial infection. Other patients who had fungal, mycobacterial and nocardial infections also were initially diagnosed with CAP, although in many there was good evidence at the time of admission that a bacterial infection was not responsible. Most important is the large group of patients e 45% in this series e in whom no diagnosis could be made. All of these patients received standard antibacterial therapy on admission. Inducing sputum in the emergency department might lead to a correct diagnosis in some proportion of cases, and additional techniques might help to identify pneumococci in sputum. Routine use of an assay for serum procalcitonin level may help in diagnosis, especially by indicating patients who do not have bacterial infection.
