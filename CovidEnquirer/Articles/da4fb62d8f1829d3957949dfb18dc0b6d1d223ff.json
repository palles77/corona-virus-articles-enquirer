With other infections such as tuberculosis, measles and chickenpox, the concept of aerosol transmission is so well accepted that isolation of such patients is the norm. With current concerns about a possible approaching influenza pandemic, the control of transmission via infectious air has become more important. Therefore, the aim of this review is to describe the factors involved in: (1) the generation of an infectious aerosol, (2) the transmission of infectious droplets or droplet nuclei from this aerosol, and (3) the potential for inhalation of such droplets or droplet nuclei by a susceptible host. On this basis, recommendations are made to improve the control of aerosol-transmitted infections in hospitals as well as in the design and construction of future isolation facilities.",

The literature on the risks of aerosol transmission of infection in hospital operating theatres is extensive. 58e65 Over 40 studies on the relationship between ventilation systems and the transmission of infection in hospitals, offices, aeroplanes and ships were reviewed recently by Li et al. 66 Studies have also been conducted on how infectious aerosols generated by various procedures in hospital environments can lead to infection in burns care facilities 67e69 and medical intensive care units. 70, 71 In particular, the use of oxygen masks, 72, 73 and power tools in dental practice 74e77 and orthopaedics 77e84 may pose a risk of aerosol infection. Aerosol dispersal of infectious agents has also been demonstrated in wastewater spray sites, 85 surface waves on the sea, 86 the flushing of the household toilet, 87 and even just opening a standard hinged door. 88 Definitions True long-range aerosol transmission becomes possible when the droplets of infectious material are sufficiently small to remain almost indefinitely airborne and to be transmitted over long distances. One set of infection control guidelines for healthcare settings suggested that only TB, measles (rubeola virus) and chickenpox (VZV) should be considered as 'true' airborne infectious diseases. 89 However, it is likely that other infectious agents may also behave as 'airborne', given a favourable environment, e.g. whooping cough (Bordetella pertussis), influenza virus, adenovirus, rhinovirus, Mycoplasma pneumoniae, SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV), group A streptococcus and Neisseria meningitidis. Many more organisms fall into this category, as it probably includes virtually all pathogens where replication and/or colonization occur in the respiratory tract. Table I lists organisms associated with varying degrees of aerosol transmission. 90 Each organism can also be transmitted through direct contact with infected body fluids.",

A study was performed recently (Xie et al., unpublished observations) to define more clearly the size of the droplets originally referred to by Wells. 92 These terms are also in common current use. This study proposes the following size definitions: 'large-droplet' diameter >60 mm, 'small droplet' diameter 60 mm and 'droplet nuclei' diameter <10 mm. Note that small droplets may also participate in short-range transmission, but they are more likely than larger droplets to evaporate to become droplet nuclei and then be considered as having the potential for long-range airborne transmission (see below). 93 Exhaled air from both nose and mouth is able to enter and mix with air in the breathing zone of another person standing nearby (e.g. patients and doctors on a ward round at the bedside). Thus, short-range transmission implies that air flows between individuals may interact to infect one another. 94 In addition, it has been shown that the use of a simple oxygen mask may also generate a short-range (<1 m) infectious aerosol, with a potential risk to nearby healthcare workers and other patients. 72, 73 Together with nebulizers, oxygen masks fall into this classification of potential short-range aerosol transmission sources, but some droplets generated by such masks can evaporate to become droplet nuclei that can also transmit infection over larger distances. 57 e Long-range aerosol transmission refers to the potential for agents to be carried long distances by air flows to cause infection, and includes the traditional terms 'small-droplet' or 'droplet nuclei' and 'airborne'. Virtually all infectious agents that can cause infection at long range can also cause infection at short range as well as by direct contact. Therefore, use of the term 'long range' refers to the greatest distance from their source at which these agents have the potential to cause infection.",

For truly airborne pathogens (TB, measles and VZV), the routes of acquisition and dissemination of the infectious particles are well recognized to be via the respiratory tract. In the other pathogens listed in Table I , acquisition of the infection is also via the respiratory tract, which is the primary site of infection and replication. Therefore, these other pathogens, such as parvovirus B19, enteroviruses and the organisms of atypical pneumonias [M. pneumoniae, Chlamydophila psittaci (previously Chlamydia psittaci), Chlamydophila pneumoniae (previously Chlamydia pneumoniae), Coxiella burnetti and Legionella pneumophila], have the potential to be transmitted via aerosols as their life cycle involves replication at some point in the respiratory tract. Regarding L. pneumophila, replication also occurs in water systems, and human infection can occur via infected water aerosols, such as showerheads and fountains. With SARS-CoV, viral RNA as well as viable (culturable) virus has been found in air samples. 95, 96 Therefore, SARS-CoV can potentially be transmitted by short-and long-range aerosols to cause disease, as has been strongly implicated by several studies. 1e5 With influenza, there is ongoing debate about the nature of transmission between people. A recent review suggested that 'aerosol-generating procedures.should be performed with proper infection control precautions', but the authors do not elaborate on exactly what these precautions should be. 97 Recent guidelines from the UK review the evidence for aerosol transmission of influenza more comprehensively. 98 The report concluded that whilst close contact with infected individuals seems to be responsible for the vast majority of transmission, most reports of influenza transmission By inhalation of dust from contaminated soil, grain or hay Virtually all of these pathogens are also transmissible by direct contact. Pathogens in bold are those which are considered to have the potential to be transmitted by the long-range airborne route. 89 The original wording of the reference text 90 concerning aerosol transmission routes has been retained as much as possible.",

The droplet size changes with time, depending on the environmental conditions. Humidity in the air alters the rate of droplet evaporation and therefore its size. Droplets in dry air evaporate quickly, reduce in size and fall to the ground more slowly. 57 The changing size of a droplet affects how it will respond to airflow patterns and how quickly it will settle. Movement in air is determined by Stokes' settling law, which governs how quickly a sphere falls under the opposing forces of gravity downwards and air friction upwards ( Figure 3 ). 92 Knight estimated the times taken for particles of various diameters to fall 3 m (corresponding to the height of a room). 10 Particles of diameters 1e3 mm remained suspended almost indefinitely, 10 mm took 17 min, 20 mm took 4 min, and 100 mm took 10 s to fall to the floor. 'Naked' viruses, bacteria and fungal spores (i.e. without associated water, mucus or pus droplets) range in approximate size from 0.02 to 0.3 mm, from 5 to 100 mm and from 1 to 10 mm, respectively. Infectious agents from patients can be expelled as individual or clusters of 'naked' organisms, or disseminated on skin cells, mucus or saliva. 107 The amount of solid matter in a droplet ultimately determines its minimal size limit. Temperature differences can set up large exchange flows between rooms, in a similar way to leaving a front door open on a cold day (Figure 4) . Opening a hinged door leads to a sweeping action, which can also move a considerable volume of infectious air across the open doorway ( Figure 4) . A typical hinged door (about 1 m wide) opening relatively slowly from closed to 45 sweeps out one-eighth of a circle of circumference (C) 2p \u00bc 6.3 m (C \u00bc 2pr). Therefore, the door edge travels about 6.3/8 \u00bc about 0.8 m in about 2 s, generating an air flow with speed of approximately 0.8/2 \u00bc 0.4 m/s. In practice, doors may be opened faster and wider than this. As the door opens, air inside the room is dragged (or 'entrained') into the region swept by the door, leading to a large exchange of air across the doorway. 117, 118 At least one case report has described a secondary case of chickenpox arising from infectious air being transported out of an isolation room containing a patient with severe chickenpox via the opening of a hinged door. 88 Closing a door does not seem to lead to any significant air exchange between rooms. Such problems with hinged doors may be reduced by the use of sliding doors.",

Seto et al. performed a study on the effectiveness of masks in reducing infection during the SARS outbreak, and found that surgical masks were effective in reducing infection from SARS to a certain extent. 141 However, with more infectious diseases such as TB, measles or chickenpox, a surgical mask alone may be insufficient aerosol protection, and masks with built-in filters, i.e. filtered face piece masks, may be required. Droplet nuclei produced during respiration, talking, coughing and sneezing from such patients are very small, less than 5 mm in diameter, and behave similarly to smoke particles in air. 142 Where susceptible hosts are widely separated in an indoor space, the potential for airborne transmission depends partially on the ventilation system present. In the community, some studies during the SARS outbreak in Hong Kong suggested that the use of facemasks and covering the mouth when sneezing may have contributed to an overall reduction in the incidence of viral respiratory infections at this time. 143, 144 For the control of long-range aerosol transmission, the architecture of the healthcare facilities requires consideration. Hospital rooms are connected by doorways, corridors, stairwells and lift shafts. Small pressure differences, induced by natural forces such as thermal buoyancy due to air temperature differences, the wind or mechanical fans, can generate air flows that move air from one room to another. These air flows are very sensitive to doors or windows being kept open, e.g. although opening a window can enhance natural ventilation, this can change the air pressure in neighbouring rooms and corridors, reducing, or even reversing, airflow directions ( Figure 4 ). This highlights the importance of keeping isolation room windows and doors closed.",

Besides simply increasing the number of air changes per hour, there are other ways in which manipulation of air flows can be used to reduce the spread of airborne infection in an indoor environment such as a hospital. One main difficulty in designing ventilation systems for removing airborne pathogens is due to the fact that air flow is generally turbulent. In a hospital environment, if a ventilation system can ensure that the inhaled air for each individual mainly consists of fresh outdoor air, the system would be considered effective as the purpose of ventilation is to protect individuals from inhaling hazardous, infectious air. 145 This principle can be broken down into three approaches, as follows.",

The fresh air stream mixes with convection currents, such as the heat plumes that arise above people and equipment. To remove infectious particles, existing guidelines recommend that the air flow should follow a path from the ceiling supply vents to the healthcare workers, then to the patients, then finally to the exhaust vents that are generally located at a lower level, near the floor. 147 Ventilation and air flows also affect the thermal comfort of both healthcare workers and patients. The air speed in the occupied zone of a room is designed to be below 0.2 m/s for reasons of comfort. 150 Due to differences in metabolic rate and clothing, the cooling or heating requirements of healthcare workers and patients can be different. Thermal discomfort such as sweating may also discourage the proper use of PPE by HCWs and thus limit its effectiveness. 141 To reduce the spread of airborne contamination between rooms, it is common to fit ventilation systems with the capability to produce negative pressures, so that the direction of flow around closed leaky windows and doors can be controlled. For instance, in a negative pressure room, the supply flow rate to the room is less than the exhaust flow rate. Such 'negative pressure' isolation rooms are generally separately air-conditioned and temperature controlled, but there is likely to be a temperature difference between adjacent rooms. Current guidelines recommend a minimum negative pressure of 2.5 Pa (0.01 inch water gauge) in Figure 6 Illustration of the two commonly used air distribution methods in rooms. (a) Mixing ventilation: the cool air is supplied at ceiling level at high velocity and returned at either ceiling or floor level. The air in the room is generally fully mixed due to the strong mixing created by the overall air recirculation in the room, governed by the strong supply momentum. (b) Displacement ventilation: the cool air is supplied at floor level at low velocity and returned at ceiling level. The air in the room is divided into two parts: the upper part with 'polluted' air and the lower part with 'clean' air.

These systems need to be regularly maintained because it is commonly found that some air-supply vents do not supply the air at their specified rate, vents may be blocked and fail to deliver any air, and/or negative pressure rooms are being operated in a positive pressure mode.",

            "text": "e The survival of such aerosolized pathogens depends upon environmental conditions, such as temperature and RH, both of which can vary with the season and the indoor building environment.e Such aerosols can be transmitted over short and long distances. Short-range transmission occurs over a distance of <1 m between individuals and is mediated mainly by the interaction of breathing zones of individuals. Long-range transmission occurs between distant locations and is primarily governed by air flows driven by pressure differences generated by ventilation systems, open windows and doors, movement of people or temperature differences.e Agents able to transmit infection over long distances can almost always transmit infection over short ranges and through direct contact.In addition, large droplets may become small droplets then droplet nuclei via the process of evaporation. This may explain why some infectious agents, normally only associated with short-range transmission, may occasionally cause outbreaks over greater distances.e Whether an individual acquires an infection depends on the final inhaled pathogen dose and the host's immune response. e The airborne transmission of diseases may be restricted in three ways: e control the source of infection by quarantine and the use of isolation facilities; e control airborne transmission routes by the use of negative pressure ventilation systems, sliding doors instead of hinged doors, and improving seals around doors and windows; and e protect exposed susceptible individuals from both aerosol and contact transmission of infection by the use of PPE.
