            "text": "A major antigen of the brush border membrane of Torpedo marmorata kidney was identified and purified by immunoprecipitation. The sequence of its 18 N terminal amino acids was determined and found to be very similar to that of mammalian aminopeptidase N (EC 3.4.11.2). Indeed aminopeptidase N activity was efficiently immunoprecipitated by monoclonal antibody 180KI. The purified antigen gives a broad band at 180 kDa after SDS-gel electrophoresis, which, after treatment by endoglycosidase F, is converted to a thinner band at 140 kDa. This antigen is therefore heavily glycosylated. Depending on sohibilization conditions, both the antigen and peptidase activity were recovered either as a broad peak with a sedimentation coefficient of 18S (2% CHAPS) or as a single peak of 7.8S (1% CHAPS plus 0.2 % CI2E9), showing that Torpedo aminopeptidase N behaves as an oligomer stabilized by hydrophobic interactions, easily converted into a 160 kDa monomer. The antigen is highly concentrated in the apical membrane of proximal tubule epithelial cells (600 gold particles//.tm 2 of brush border membrane) whereas no labeling could be detected in other cell types or in other membranes of the same cells (basolat~ral membranes, vacuoles or vesicles). Monoclonal antibodies prepared here will be useful tools for further functional and structural studies of Torpedo kidney aminopeptidase N.",

Binding of the mAbs 180K1 or 180K2 was indirectly visualized using antimouse IgG antibodies conjugated to 5 nm gold particles. A general view of the apical portion of a proximal tubule epithelial cell is presented in figure 6 . The apical membrane covers numerous microvilli, about 0.15 #m large and several microns long. This membrane is homogeneously decorated with numerous gold particles. In contrast, no labelling was associated to the basolateral membrane, or to the numerous vesicular or vacuolar membranes located under the brush border. In higher magnification views ( fig 7) the abundance and selectivity of the 180 kDa antigen distribution are demonstrated. The density of gold particles associated to the apical Membrane (about 600 particles/btm2) was estimated on membrane profiles perpendicular to the planes of the section.

The antigens were then identified, after SDS gel electrophoresis and electrotransfer onto nitrocellulose, using streptavidin biotinylated peroxidase complex. Surprisingly, considering the heterogeneity of the kidney membrane fraction, 17 supematants (out of 42) immunoprecipitated the same 180 kDa antigen. A typical example is illustrated in figure 1. Monoclonal antibody 180K1 immunoprecipitates a single biotinylated antigen (left panel, lane 3) which gives a broad band at 180 kDa. This procedure, in a single step, allows a high enrichment of this anti-Immunoprecipitation of the 180 kDa antigen. Crude kidney membrane proteins were solubilized and, in some samples (left panel), biotinylated. Solubilized proteins, before (lanes 1) or after immunoprecipitation by monoclonal antibodies 316 (lane 2) or 180 KI (lanes 3) were submitted to SDS gel electrophoresis. They were either stained in the gels by Coomassie blue (unbiotinylated samples, right panel) or electroblotted onto nitrocellulose and probed with streptavidin-peroxidase (biotinylated samples, left panel). gen, which is not a major component of the whole biotinylated solubilized kidney membranes (left panel, lane 1). The specificity of the immunoprecipitation is illustrated using another antibody (lane 2) which binds to two lower molecular mass polypeptides. In the absence of biotinylation, the 180 kDa antigen was still immunoprecipitated by mAb 180K1. In this case, it was directly detected in the polyacrylamide gels by Coomassie blue staining (right panel, lane 3), as a broad band of 180 kDa. Biotinylation, therefore, does not modify its electrophoretic behaviour. The Coomassie blue staining of kidney membrane proteins did not reveal an easily detectable band of 180 kDa (right panel, lane 1), showing again that this protein is not a major component of this crude membrane fraction. The bands at 50 and 28 kDa (right panel, lane 3) correspond to the heavy and light immunoglobulin chains.The 180 kDa antigen behaves as an integral membrane protein since it was not solubilized after treatment of the membranes at high ionic strength (0.5 M NaCI; 0.5 M MgC\u00bd) or at alkaline pH (50 mM Na2CO 3, pH 11; dot-blot experiments not shown).",
