Significantly higher CD4/ CD8 ratio, IFN-\u03b3 concentration and IL12/IL4 ratio and significantly lower IL-4 concentration and proportion of shedders were found in HB than in other breeds. No other differences were found. In conclusion, this study did not provide evidence of peculiar immune profiles in HB, except for a prevalent Th1 profile, that may explain why in our caseload the rate of shedders was lower in HB than in other breeds.",

            "text": "Feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is a lethal disease caused by the feline coronavirus (FCoV). FCoVs are widely diffused in feline populations, in which they usually infect enterocytes and replicate only at the intestinal level. The FCoV genome is highly unstable and replication errors frequently occur. As a consequence, every cat sheds a population of heterogenous \"quasispecies\" , characterized by a high adaptability (Domingo et al., 1996) : various studies have shown that FCoV genetic heterogeneity correlates with the spread of the infection in the population and with the severity of clinical forms (Battilani et al., 2003; Kiss et al., 2000) . The latter occur when the enteric biotype (feline enteric coronavirus or FECV) mutates into strains able to replicate within monocytes, thus inducing FIP (Vennema et al., 1998) . However, the pathogenesis of the disease in the presence of mutations is not completely understood. Currently, two theories about the role of mutated FCoVs exists: the \"internal mutation theory\" and the \"circulating virulent/ avirulent theory\" (Barker et al., 2013) . According to this latter theory, both virulent and avirulent biotypes may circulate in a cattery and the disease occurs when mutated viruses infect susceptible cats (Brown et al., 2009 ). In addition, Dewerchin et al. (2005) showed that the ability of the host monocyte determined the amount of virus replication, no matter whether the virus was virulent or avirulent.",

As further support of the protective role of immunity, FIP occurs frequently in young and old cats, that have a less efficient immune system (Pedersen, 2009) . Moreover, the comparison of results from FCoV-infected, clinically healthy cats and from cats with FIP showed some differences regarding indicators of innate or cell-mediated immunity, such as lymphocyte subsets, that decrease in blood and lymph nodes in FIP cats but not in FCoV-positive cats (Kipar et al., 1999 (Kipar et al., , 2001 Paltrinieri et al., 2003) , \u03b11-acid glycoprotein (AGP), that increases and is hyposialylated in FIP cats (Ceciliani et al., 2004; Duthie et al., 1997) , possibly depressing neutrophil functions (Rossi et al., 2013) and transiently increases and is hypersialylated in FCoV-positive cats Paltrinieri et al., 2007) , and proinflammatory cytokines or interferon-\u03b3 (IFN-\u03b3) whose expression and serum concentration decreases in FIP cats and increases in FCoV-positive cats (Gelain et al., 2006; Giordano and Paltrinieri, 2009; Gunn-Moore et al., 1998; Kiss et al., 2004) .",

Genetic factors can influence the efficiency of immune responses, and a genetic predisposition to develop FIP has been demonstrated (Foley and Pedersen, 1996) . Moreover, epidemiological studies suggested different individual responses in cats from the same cattery (Addie et al., 2003) : the large majority of cats are recurrent shedders, likely due to continuous reinfection by environmental FCoVs, which, in turn, depends on fluctuation of their level of immunity (Foley et al., 1997) while some cats persistently shed FCoVs and some others have only a transient episode of shedding (Addie et al., 2003) . Both these latter categories are in some way resistant to FIP. Finally, FIP has been reported to occur more frequently in some breeds, and especially in Holy Birman cats (Pesteanu-Somogyi et al., 2006) . The reason for this higher frequency of FIP is not clear, but a particular feature of the immune response against FCoVs has been hypothesized, also based on genomic analyses that identified some candidate genes, coding for molecules involved in immune responses, potentially associated with resistance/susceptibility to FIP (Golovko et al., 2013) .",

In almost all the catteries, the rate of positivity recorded in this study was similar to that recorded in the past by the owners. With rare exceptions, FIP occurred frequently in catteries (or in kittens sold out from catteries) of type H or V, independently of the breed. During the study period, cases of FIP were recorded either in Holy Birman cats (cattery 9) or in cats of other breeds (catteries 12, 13, 14, 23) . In total, 5 cases of FIP were recorded in catteries of Holy Birmans and 16 in catteries of other breeds. The proportion of cats with positive PCR was significantly lower (P < 0.05) in Holy Birman cats (23/73 cats tested; 31.5%) than in cats of other breeds (44/94; 46.8%). Conversely, no significant differences were found between the proportion of seropositive cats in Holy Birman (52/75, 69.3%) and in cats of other breeds (64/94; 68.1%) and between the proportion of cats with at least one positive test (e.g. PCR or serology) in Holy Birman cats (55/75; 73.3%) and in cats of other breeds (73/94; 77.7%). Similarly, antibody titers did not significantly differ in Holy Birmans (median 1:200; min-max 0-1:1600) compared with cats of other breeds (1:100; 0-1:800). There were no apparent associations between median antibody titers or number of seropositive or PCR positive animals and the occurrence of cases of FIP.",

The health status of the catteries was good in general or characterized by recurrent episodes of non specific infectious diseases. Only one rescue shelter of DSH had a history of frequent outbreaks of infectious diseases, likely related to the larger size of the group associated with a higher environmental circulation of infectious agents. Nevertheless, all the catteries had a history of FCoV positivity or of FIP cases, although the rate of positivity was different. The rate of positivity was assessed using both serology and PCR since this approach provides a more complete overview of the \"FCoV status\" than serology or PCR alone (Addie and Jarret, 2001; Addie et al., 2003) because seropositive cats may not shed FCoVs and, vice versa, seronegative cats, that do not have local immune defenses, may host the virus in the gastrointestinal tract, according to the susceptibleinfected-susceptible (SIS) model (Foley et al., 1997) . Therefore, differently from experimental studies on which the infection status of each cat can be precisely known, the actual presence of infection of each cat in field studies can only be estimated. However, the combined approach is the best method to actually know the overall rate of infection in a cattery. Although the proportion of positive cats and the level of positivity was different in the different catteries, this survey confirmed that the level of environmental infection by FCoVs in multicat environments is generally high, as reported in the literature (Addie et al., 2003; Pedersen, 2009 ). However, no evident association between the median titer and the number of seropositive cats was found. Additional information about the level of infection of single cats or of Birman cats compared with other breeds may have been drawn by a quantitative analysis of fecal shedding through a quantitative PCR or by a semi-quantification of PCR products used in previous studies (Gelain et al., 2006) . Unfortunately, none of these two approaches has been followed in this study.",

            "text": "There were no significant differences regarding the rate of seropositivity between Holy Birman cats and cats of other breeds or between the different catteries, in some case due to the high individual variability within each cattery. No association was found between the rate of positivity (serology or PCR) and the number of cats, the general health status or the management of the cattery (e.g. participation to cat shows, grouping of cats). However, a statistical comparison among groups of catteries with different management was not possible since most of the catteries had similar characteristics, and the number of observations was therefore unbalanced. Conversely, with a few exceptions (cattery 1 and 23), cases of FIP occurred mainly in catteries with more than 10 cats, supporting the association between cattery size and probability of FIP (Kass and Dent, 1995) . More importantly, the prevalence of positive cats, the magnitude of antibody titers and the frequency of FIP were not higher in Holy Birman cats than in the other breeds. The magnitude of antibody titers recorded in this study was similar to that recorded in a previous study (Bell et al., 2006a) . In a similar study the antibody titer of Holy Birman cats was higher compared with some other feline breeds (some of which, e.g. Persians, were included also in the current study) but not with others (e.g. Abyssinian, Russian Blue, etc.) (Bell et al., 2006b ) and therefore it is not surprising that in the present study, on which all the other breeds were merged into a single group, no significant differences were found. However, in this study results from the different \"non-Birman\" breeds were not analyzed separately, except in the tables describing the study population, since the focus of the study was to specifically analyze the indicators of innate or specific immunity in Holy Birman cats, that have been reported to be more predisposed to FIP (Pesteanu-Somogyi et al., 2006) . Our epidemiological results seem to contrast with this latter study, that, however, was based on a retrospective analysis of medical records at one teaching hospital and hence may have been biased by the referral hospital population. In addition, in the study cited above, the data referred to a longer period of time (16 years), while our results, although generated with a larger caseload and therefore potentially more adequate to reflect the general population of Holy Birman cats, were focused on the 5 years preceding the sampling. Interestingly, despite the fact that the prevalence of FIP or of seropositivity was similar to that of other breeds, the proportion of shedders was lower in Holy Birman cats than in other breeds. This may suggest that Birman cats are mostly recurrent shedders on which intestinal viruses stimulate an immune response that rapidly clear FCoVs from the intestine (Addie et al., 2003) .",

This evaluation did not find evidence for a particular activation of innate immunity, since electrophoretograms and leukograms were always within the reference intervals of the general feline population or of Holy Birman cats (Paltrinieri et al., 2014; Rizzi et al., 2010) and the few differences between Holy Birmans and other breeds were probably non-specific. Also AGP values were within the reference intervals, except for individual cats from type H or V catteries that had high serum concentration of AGP in the absence of other changes consistent with inflammation. The lack of electrophoretic changes in animals with high AGP values is not surprising since on one hand the baseline concentration of AGP is so low that even in the presence of strong increases the serum concentration remains low and on the other hand due to its acidic nature, AGP does not bind the stains routinely used in electrophoretic systems (Keren, 2003) . However, the lack of changes in inflammatory markers despite the increase of serum AGP may depend on the kinetics of this protein, which increases earlier than other inflammatory markers (Paltrinieri, 2008) . Additionally, the possibility that increases of AGP may be related in some way to early changes during the development of FIP can be excluded since all the cats included in this study were still alive and did not develop clinical signs potentially consistent with FIP during the year after sampling.",

This never occurred in cats of other breeds, despite the likelihood that exposure to circulating microorganisms was probably similar. This suggests that individual Holy Birman cats may have a more intense AGP response: this response may be induced by FCoVs as already hypothesized (Paltrinieri et al., 2007 . However, this hypothesis may not be proven since the temporal association between FCoV fecal shedding and the presence of high AGP values was not assessed in this study. Unfortunately, it was not possible to assess whether these changes were associated with peculiarities of the glycosylation pattern of AGP, as demonstrated in previous studies (Ceciliani et al., 2004; Paltrinieri et al., 2007) , since the procedure of AGP purification and of assessment of the glycosylation pattern requires high volumes of serum (Ceciliani et al., 2004; Rossi et al., 2013) .",

            "text": "Results regarding cell-mediated immunity were quite surprising since a significantly higher CD4 count and CD4/CD8 ratio, a higher concentration of IFN-\u03b3 and a higher IL-12/IL-4 ratio was found in Holy Birman cats, suggesting that cell-mediated immunity is even more efficient in these cats than in other breeds, independently on the rate of positivity, on the number of cases of FIP or on the general health status. However, it should be stressed that, although both suggestive of a strong cell mediated immunity, the cytokine profile and the CD4/CD8 ratio recorded in this study cannot be considered to be definitive proof of a stronger Th1 response. Definitive information on the efficiency of cell mediated immunity of Holy Birman cats compared with other breeds can be obtained by in vitro studies focused on cytokine production on isolated blood cells or by experimental studies on which the actual state of infection can be monitored without the external variables typical of field studies such as the current one. This may be particularly important since our results seem to contrast with what was reported by Pesteanu-Somogyi et al. (2006) . In their study, these authors found that Birman cats are predisposed to develop FIP, while the lymphocyte and cytokine profile found in the present study should theoretically protect FCoV infected cats from the development of FIP (Pedersen, 2009 ). However, this may explain why the catteries of Holy Birman cats included in our study did not have a higher prevalence of FIP compared with other breeds. However, this Th1 profile might theoretically be one of the factors that confer resistance to permanent colonization of the intestinal tract, thus explaining why most cats were seropositive sometimes with medium-high titers (and therefore likely recently infected) but PCR negative (i.e. not infected at the time of sampling). Further studies are needed to assess whether this possibly high re-infection rate plays a role in increasing the probability of mutation of FCoVs, thus predisposing infected animals to develop FIP.",

This Th1 profile is theoretically protective against FIP and it may explain why in our caseload, Holy Birman cats had a lower rate of shedders and did not show a higher rate of seropositivity or a higher prevalence of FIP cases than that recorded in other breeds.",
