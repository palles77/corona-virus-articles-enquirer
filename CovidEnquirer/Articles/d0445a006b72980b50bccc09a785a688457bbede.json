It consists of five subindices measuring each country's economic resources, public health communications, infrastructure, public health systems and institutional capacity. To evaluate the construct validity of the EPI, we tested its correlation with proxy measures for preparedness and response capacity, including the timeliness of outbreak detection and reporting, as well as vaccination rates during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic. results The most prepared countries were concentrated in Europe and North America, while the least prepared countries clustered in Central and West Africa and Southeast Asia. Better prepared countries were found to report infectious disease outbreaks more quickly and to have vaccinated a larger proportion of their population during the 2009 pandemic. Conclusion The EPI measures a country's capacity to detect and respond to infectious disease events. Existing tools, such as the Joint External Evaluation (JEE), have been designed to measure preparedness within a country over time. The EPI complements the JEE by providing a holistic view of preparedness and is constructed to support comparative risk assessment between countries. The index can be updated rapidly to generate global estimates of pandemic preparedness that can inform strategy and resource allocation.",

            "text": "Infectious disease epidemics and pandemics periodically threaten the health and livelihoods of people in wealthy and poor countries alike. 1 2 Evidence suggests that the risk of emerging infectious diseases has increased over time due to intensification of international travel, trade and livestock husbandry, as well as increasing human population density and changing interactions between humans and wild animals. 3 4 These drivers of disease emergence are likely to continue and intensify, 2 and additional drivers of ecological change and disruption such as global warming are likely to further amplify disease emergence risk. Given the public health risk posed by epidemics and pandemics, it is critical to systematically assess global preparedness, and BMJ Global Health to identify regions that are not well equipped to respond to such threats to public health. Despite significant investments in global health surveillance and capacity building, large parts of the world are unprepared to manage infectious disease threats. According to recent estimates drawing on the WHO-supported Joint External Evaluation (JEE) process, only a minority of countries for which data are available are fully compliant with the 2005 International Health Regulations (IHR), which require demonstrable capacity to mitigate public health risks. 5 Such capacities matter greatly to human health. There is clear evidence that the scale and severity of the 2013-2016 West Africa Ebola epidemic was exacerbated by the weak state of health systems in West Africa, and in particular, limited local capacity for public health surveillance and outbreak response. 6 National governments remain the primary actors and first line of defence in responding to high-priority infectious disease outbreaks. They are also the primary locus of capacity-building efforts aimed at improving preparedness. Improving global capacity to respond to infectious disease crises requires better data on national-level preparedness worldwide, in order to inform and calibrate both foreign and domestic investments in capacity. 7 Existing frameworks for measuring preparedness, including WHO's IHR Core Capacity Monitoring Framework and the JEE, have substantially improved our understanding of preparedness to mitigate global health threats, and have shed light on gaps in preparedness both by function and across geographies. However, these frameworks have two limitations. First, while both focus on public health competencies in great depth, they do not fully address the broader range of non-health system factors, including institutional, financial and infrastructural capacities, which are also fundamental building blocks for effective response to infectious disease epidemics. For example, the JEE includes an indicator for 'Linking Public Health and Security Authorities', which is important for assessing the coordination between these institutions. However, this indicator does not measure the capacity of the security authorities to perform their required functions. Given the importance of this and other enabling functions, metrics tracking these additional capacities should be incorporated into assessments of epidemic preparedness.",

Once an epidemic is underway, the healthcare and public health systems must be able to identify, investigate, monitor and manage abrupt surges in cases through the mobilisation of personnel and resources. Health systems must be able to manage the clinical care for infected persons, and limit further transmission in clinical facilities, and public health agencies must also be able to implement effective non-pharmaceutical measures to limit the spread of infection. 11 Lastly, the health system must be able to coordinate activity with other national and international agencies.

Several factors influence public acceptance of official communications, including the population's level of trust in authorities, 19 as well as overall level of public education.

Low-scoring EPI countries (ie, having lower preparedness levels) are geographically concentrated in West and Central Africa, Southwest Asia and areas within Southeast Asia. These geographies are also widely considered to be at heightened risk for disease emergence, particularly from zoonotic reservoirs. This suggests a potentially dangerous mismatch between infectious disease emergence and outbreak risk, and local capacity for its detection and mitigation. 30 These countries likely face BMJ Global Health Figure 4 Kaplan-Meier curves of country outbreak reporting timeliness by Epidemic Preparedness Index (EPI) cluster. elevated morbidity and mortality risk arising from infectious disease outbreaks, and weak preparedness may also increase the risk of regional or global disease spread. A comparison of preparedness metrics found good concordance between the EPI and JEE metrics, and weaker concordance between both metrics and the IHR. The EPI correlates well with the rigorous, yet slower moving and resource-intensive peer-reviewed assessments generated by the JEE. Because the EPI can be generated based on open-source data, it may shed light on preparedness in contexts where JEE estimates are sparse or not yet available. Additionally, the EPI can be updated quickly as conditions change in a country or region of interest, for example, during episodes of political instability or the onset of armed conflict that could adversely affect public health capacity. As such, it may serve as a leading indicator for the JEE during periods of instability and change, until the more resource-intensive JEE can be conducted and updated.",

The EPI can also be used to assess epidemic preparedness where other metrics such as the JEE have not been generated, or may be superseded by rapid institutional or societal change. The EPI can also be incorporated into infectious disease models and simulations to more realistically capture the effects of country-level capacity to detect and respond to disease outbreaks.",
