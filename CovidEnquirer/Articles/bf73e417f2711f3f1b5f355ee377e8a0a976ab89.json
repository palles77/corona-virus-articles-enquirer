In Taiwan, the average annual incidence of patients hospitalized with pneumonia was 1240 with 6.7 mortalities per 100,000 children younger than 18 years of age, costing NT$1,475,000,000 (about US$49 million) per year. 1 Occasionally, a child may develop an opaque pulmonary consolidation with unusually round shape, which raises the concern of a tumor in the chest, causing anxiety to the pediatrician and parents. Herein, we report the case of a patient with so-called \"round pneumonia\", whose initial chest X-ray (CXR) findings mimicked those of a lung mass, but subsequently showed complete response to oral antibiotics alone. Recent findings and recommendations in the literature are also reviewed.",

Under the working diagnosis of round pneumonia, the patient was suggested to be hospitalized and undergo antimicrobial therapy. However, due to family reasons, his mother requested that he be treated as an outpatient. His subjective abdominal pain had improved after an enema and intravenous administration of metoclopramide, and he was discharged and given oral amoxicillin/ clavulanate (87.5 mg amoxicillin/kg/day) and azithromycin (10 mg/kg/day).",

            "text": "Round pneumonia, also called spherical pneumonia, has been recognized since the 1970s as a clinical entity that usually occurs in children. 2 Young children are predisposed to round pneumonia because of their underdeveloped pores of Kohn and Lambert's channels that may cause the centrifugal spread of fluid or bacteria. 3 In a recent large study involving 109 children with round pneumonia, the consolidations tended to be solitary, have well-defined borders, and were located posteriorly and in bilateral lower lobes (63%), 4 which exactly matched the initial radiographic findings in our patient ( Figure 1 ). Although the exact term \"round pneumonia\" does not seem to be widely used by pediatricians in Taiwan, a previous study identified typical imaging features in 5% (2/39) of children with mycoplasmal pneumonia, whose lesions had been described as \"nodular or mass-like opacification\". 5 The diagnosis of classical round pneumonia in children should be kept straightforward. In comparison to that in adults, in whom neoplastic diseases such as bronchogenic carcinoma are more common and pneumonia only comprises less than 1% of \"coin lesions\", round pneumonia in children is likely to represent a benign process. 6 With the typical clinical presentation and radiographic appearance, misdiagnosis of round pneumonia is unlikely, and unwarranted additional imaging should be avoided. 3 Computerized tomography (CT) of the chest is recommended when (1) the clinical features are not consistent with pneumonia, (2) the round opacity does not resolve after appropriate antibiotic treatment, or (3) there are radiographic signs of a nonpulmonary origin on CXR. 3 Round pneumonia is most commonly caused by S. pneumoniae 3 and may rarely be caused by other bacteria, 4 while viral etiology such as severe acute respiratory syndrome has also been seen in adults. 7 In our patient, although the initial blood culture was negative, results of a urinary antigen test revealed the presence of S. pneumoniae. As Taiwanese children's nasopharyngeal carriage rate of pneumococcus has decreased to approximately 10% with the advent of conjugate vaccines, 8 urinary antigen positivity nowadays may serve as a reliable indicator of recent pneumococcal disease. By contrast, mycoplasmal pneumonia is prevalent in children older than 2e5 years of age, 9 and its diagnosis in most clinical laboratories relies solely on serology. 10 The patient's sera were tested with a microparticle agglutination assay (FTI Serodia Myco II; Fujirebio Taiwan Inc., Taoyuan, Taiwan), which detects both IgG and IgM simultaneously. The test was considered positive when the acuteand convalescent-phase sera showed a fourfold or higher increase in antibody titer, or when one sera had an antibody titer measurement of at least 1:160 (\u00fe), 11, 12 as was the case in our patient. The test kit had a sensitivity of 48.1% and specificity of 86.9%, 12 thereby indicating a high likelihood of concomitant M. pneumoniae infection in this child. However, neither imaging studies nor laboratory data can perfectly distinguish these two pathogens, and mixed infections are not uncommon in children with community-acquired pneuonia. 8, 13 Therefore, combination therapy was given to treat both pathogens.",

Meanwhile, the patient's good clinical condition permitted a therapeutic trial with oral antibiotics. As the lesion resolved completely after oral antibiotic use (Figure 2 ), the diagnosis of round pneumonia was confirmed, and therefore a chest CT was not indicated. Of note, with the recent emergence of macrolide-resistant M. pneumoniae, 15 mutation analysis may be considered in patients with poor improvement despite adequate antibiotic treatment.",
