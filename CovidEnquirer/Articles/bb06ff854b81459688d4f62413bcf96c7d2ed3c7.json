Five of six prepubertal colts inoculated intranasally remained infected in the reproductive tract from post-challenge day 28 to 93 and two of six from post-challenge day 120 to 180. No virus was detected in five of these animals killed on post-challenge day 210. Each of two peripubertal colts remained infected in the reproductive tract at post-challenge day 60 and one of nine was found to be persistently infected with EAV 15 months after challenge. These findings confirm that the virus can replicate in the reproductive tract of a significant proportion of colts for a variable period of time after clinical recovery in the absence of circulating concentrations of testosterone equivalent to those found in sexually mature stallions. Long-term persistent infection with EAV does not appear to occur in colts exposed to the virus before the onset of peripubertal development. We suggest that colts should be vaccinated at approximately 6 months of age, before peripubertal development but after the disappearance of maternally acquired antibodies.",

(Doll et al., 1957a,b) . The virus was named equine arteritis virus (EAV) and the disease equine viral arteritis (EVA), because of the distinctive vascular lesions found on histopathological examination of acutely infected cases (Doll et al., 1957a) . EAV is classified in the genus Arterivirus, and was formerly considered a member of the non-arthropod-borne group of Togaviruses (Westaway et al., 1985) . Recent studies have shown that the organization and expression of the EAV genome are similar to those of Coronaviruses and Toroviruses (Snijder et al., 1990) . It has been suggested, therefore, that EAV may be taxonomically related to these two virus groups and belong to a Coronavirus-like superfamily (den Boon et al., 1991) . The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses has recently removed the genus Arterivirus from the family Togaviridae and left it as a free-floating genus pending the assessment of current research (Pringle, 1992) .",

Since then, the number of confirmed outbreaks has increased due in part to heightened awareness. Investigation of the 1984 epidemic confirmed the existence of a carrier state in stallions, which appear to play a major role in maintaining and disseminating the virus months or years after clinical recovery (Timoney e! al., 1986b) . The rate of viral persistence in stallions varies from 25-65 per cent Neu et al., 1988; Timoney et al., 1992) . Little information is available on the frequency of the carrier state in colts infected before puberty or during peripubertal development. The testosterone dependency of EAV output from persistently infected stallions has been reported by Little el al. (1992) . The present study was undertaken in an attempt to establish persistent infection with EAV in prepubertal and peripubertal colts and, if successful, to determine the site of viral replication within the reproductive tract.",

However, although virus was no longer detectable in the body fluids, lung or liver, it could still be isolated from most of the reproductive tract sites as well as from all of the lymph nodes sampled. By post-challenge day 28, a few of the lymph nodes contained concentrations of virus, but none was detectable in the testes or bulbourethral glands of the two colts sampled (nos 60 and 69; Table 1 ). EAV was isolated from various tissues throughout the reproductive tract in the four colts killed on day 60 (peripubertal colts nos 28 and 31, and prepubertal colts nos 52 and 58), but none could be detected in the lymph nodes, testes or bulbourethral glands. Virus was isolated from both of the prepubertal colts II ;'; ~ II killed on day 56. In prepubertal colt no. 52, virus was detected only in the distal portions of the left epididymis and in the distal extremity of the left ampulla of the vas deferens. In contrast, virus was isolated from many sites throughout the reproductive tract of colt 58, from the epididymis to the prostate gland. EVA was isolated from reproductive tract tissues extending from the tail of the epididymis to the prostate gland of both peripubertal colts (nos 28 and 31) killed on day 63. It was also recovered from one of the two prepubertal colts (nos 50 and 59) killed on day 93. In colt 59 however, virus was no longer detectable in samples of the prostate, vesicular glands, testes or bulbourethral glands. It was isolated only from the right side of the reproductive tract, including the epididymis, vas deFerens and the ampulla of the vas deferens (Table 1) . Of the four animals killed on day 120 (two prepubertal colts [nos 49 and 64] and two peripubertal colts [nos 18, 20]) none yielded EAV.

The effects of sex steroids on immune response have been the subject of a review by Schuurs and Verheul (1990) , which suggested that normal physiological concentrations of circulating testosterone have immunosuppressive activity. The testosterone concentrations in the reproductive tract of the peripubertal colts may have been responsible for the drawn-out antibody response, which contrasted with the normal response found in the prepubertal colts, which had low serum testosterone concentrations (unpublished data). Another possible explanation for the variability in response may be that the peripubertal colts were immunosuppressed due to an earlier Streptococcus equi infection (J. F. Timoney, personal communication) which spread through this group of animals shortly before the start of the study. Whatever the cause, the delayed rise in antibody titres to EAV appeared to have little effect on the eventual percentage of colts persistently infected with the virus, with the exception of colt 29, which would have been under maximal immunosuppressive effects due to increasing testosterone levels. This colt entered the peripubertal phase of development before the study began (unpublished data).",

Constant shedding of virus in the semen of the mature stallion would appear to be testosterone dependent, according to Little el al.

Conversely, castrated stallions given testosterone supplementation to normal physiological levels did not show a significant drop in viral output in the semen or elimination of infectious virus from the reproductive tract tissues. These results are supported by the evidence of immunosuppressive activity of testosterone (Carlsten el al., 1989; Schuurs and Verheul, 1990; Vendramini el al., 1991) .

Oldstone (1989b) indicated that effectiveness of the humoral immune response can be blunted by changes in viral epitope expression, such as down-regulation of viral glycoprotein production to levels much lower than those found in the acute phase of infection. It was also proposed that in certain infections the antibodies themselves initiate persistent infections by binding viral antigens presented on host cell surfaces, thus removing or masking these antigens without slowing the progress of infection (Fujinami and Oldstone, 1984; Oldstone, 1989b) . This antigen masking would then render the infected cell resistant to T cell-mediated immune responses as well as possible antibody dependent cellular eytotoxieity. Whether or not EAV utilizes any of these mechanisms in the establishment of persistent infections is not known.",

Five of six prepubertal colts challenged intranasally remained infected in the reproductive tract from post-challenge day 28 to 93, and two of six from post-challenge day 120 to 180. None of the five remaining colts were still infected one month later. Each of two peripubertal colts remained infected in the reproductive tract at post-challenge day 60. These data from both groups suggest the existence of an intermediate carrier state, possibly lasting up to 6 months. A carrier state of intermediate duration is supported by data obtained from naturally infected stallions (Timoney and McCollum, unpublished data) . A significant reduction in persistent infection was seen 6-7 months after initial exposure of this particular group of stallions to EAV. Because the study of Neu (1988) was terminated at day 148 postchallenge, an intermediate-term carrier state of the range seen in the current study and in the cited field data may have gone undetected.",

If age at the time of inoculation is disregarded, and serum testosterone concentrations and the stage of reproductive tract maturity are the main criteria, none of the colts infected before undergoing peripubertal development remained long-term (>6 months) persistent carriers of EAV. This suggests that the onset of peripubertal changes, and not age alone, is the principal factor governing persistent EAV infection. It would therefore appear that weanling colts are at low risk of developing long-term persistent infection, whereas yearling colts may be at low to high risk, depending on the state of reproductive tract maturity at the time of exposure.",

Prepubertal colts are thus unlikely to become long-term carriers of EAV. This finding may have broad implications in controlling the establishment of a carrier state in the stallion. If colts were vaccinated at approximately 6 months of age, before peripubertal development but after the disappearance of maternally acquired antibodies, it is probable that the incidence of EVA and inapparent EAV infection would eventually decline because of a reduction in the population of carrier stallions.",
