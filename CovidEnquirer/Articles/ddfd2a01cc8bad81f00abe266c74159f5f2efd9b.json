A major reason for its continued dominance is its existence as many serotypes, determined by the surface spike protein (S), cross-protection being poor. Although controlled to some degree by live and inactivated vaccines, a new generation of IB vaccines is called for. Reverse genetic or 'infectious clone' systems, which allow the manipulation of the IBV genome, are key to this development. New vaccines would ideally be: genetically stable (i.e. maintain a stable attenuated phenotype); administered in ovo; and be flexible with respect to the source of the spike protein gene. Rational attenuation of IBV requires the identification of genes that are simultaneously not essential for replication and whose absence would reduce pathogenicity. Being able to modify a 'core' vaccine strain to make it applicable to a prevailing serotype requires a procedure for doing so, and the demonstration that 'spike-swapping' is sufficient to induce good immunity.",

Our current molecularly cloned IBV, strain Beaudette, is non-pathogenic, so we do not know what effect the absence of these proteins would have on pathogenicity. That said, plaque size and composition of various gene 3/5 recombinant IBVs in cell culture, and reduced output and ciliostasis in tracheal organ cultures, shows that they are less aggressive than the wild-type Beaudette. Consequently these genes remain targets for rational attenuation. We have recently obtained evidence that one or more of the 15 proteins encoded by gene 1 are also determinants of pathogenicity. Hence gene 1 is also a target for rational attenuation.",

The poultry industry is moving towards in ovo vaccination where possible. This has been achieved for Marek's disease. To date all IB vaccines have severely reduced hatching. We have two strategic goals. One, to modify the genome of our molecularly cloned cDNA of the Beaudette strain of IBV (non-pathogenic) to achieve optimum stimulation of protection whilst retaining its non-pathogenic phenotype in both chicks and 10-day-old embryos. Two, to swap the gene of the spike protein (S), which induces protective immunity, to make a vaccine appropriate for a prevailing serotype.",

The S protein comprises two subunits: S1 (\u223c520 amino acids), derived from the amino-terminal half of the S polyprotein, and the membrane anchoring S2 subunit (\u223c625 amino acids), derived from the carboxy-terminal half. The S1 spike protein subunit is necessary and sufficient to induce protective immunity [10] . Serotypes commonly differ from one another by 20-25% of S1 amino acids [1, 2] , although differences in as few as 5% of the amino acids in S1 can decrease cross-protection [11] . A new generation of IB vaccines will still require that S protein genes of different serotypes are available. S gene swapping could result in changes in pathogenicity, as has been demonstrated for porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (Enjuanes and colleagues [12, 13] ). Therefore we have investigated this, simultaneously examining the protection-inducing capacity of spike-swapped rIBVs [11] .",

The products of the polyproteins are associated with RNA replication and transcription [20, 21] . However, the IBV gene 1 does not encode a product equivalent to nsp1, expressed from gene 1 of the other coronaviruses, and therefore IBV gene 1 encodes 15 products, named nsp2-nsp16 to be consistent with the gene 1 products encoded by the other coronaviruses. In order to test the hypothesis that one or more of the four structural protein genes and/or accessory protein genes 3 and 5 of the pathogenic M41 strain were determinants of the pathogenicity, we made a rIBV that had gene 1 from Beaudette and all other genes from M41. The recombinant was viable but was not pathogenic and caused little ciliostasis in tracheal organ cultures (Maria Armesto, D. Cavanagh and P. Britton, in preparation). Looked at one way, Beaudette had not been made pathogenic by substitution of its non-gene 1 genes with those from pathogenic M41. An alternative way of looking at it is to say that the pathogenicity of the M41 strain had been attenuated by replacement of its gene 1 by that of Beaudette. Either way, it indicates that one or more of the gene 1-encoded proteins are determinants of pathogenicity. Our result does not negate the possibility that genes 3 and 5 have 'self-defence' roles but it does indicate that their affect can be overcome by proteins encoded by gene 1. Hence gene 1 is another target for rational attenuation for vaccine development.",

Therefore the rIBVs based on Beaudette but expressing the UK/4/91 S protein had to be recovered using 10-day-old embryonated eggs. We have also replaced the Beaudette S protein gene with the S protein gene of the Begian BE/B1648/87 strain. In this case, recombination between the S genes of B1648 (in a plasmid) and Beaudette (within the full-length IBV genome cDNA within the vaccinia virus genome) was allowed to happen randomly, resulting in recovery of several rIBVs with different cross-over points within the S gene, i.e. producing rIBVs with chimaeric S genes (S. Izadkhasti, D. Cavanagh and P. Britton, in preparation) . This demonstrated that recombination within the S gene can give rise to viable recombinant IBVs, at high frequency (\u223c50% in our experiments), providing hard evidence to support the circumstantial evidence (sequence comparison of field strains) that recombination is a feature of the evolution of IBV.

Deletion of some, but not all, of the accessory protein genes of feline coronavirus [18] reduced pathogenicity. Removal of accessory protein gene 3 of transmissible gastroenteritis coronavirus [19] did not reduce its enteropathogenicity. Thus the accessory protein genes of coronaviruses are targets for modification for the purpose of vaccine development, although each gene has to be investigated in its own right. It is becoming increasingly likely that one or more proteins encoded by gene 1 also influence pathogenicity. This stems from our own observations with chimaeric IBV, and those of Sperry et al. [25] with MHV; a single amino acid substitution in nsp14 encoded by gene 1 attenuated pathogenicity for mice. Gene 1, therefore, is another target for manipulation. As we have demonstrated, the extensive antigenic variation of IBV can be addressed by spike-swapping, and our molecularly cloned IBV has potential for the development of a vaccine that can be applied in ovo.",
