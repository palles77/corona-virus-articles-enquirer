The anti-ids specifically bound to cultured cells and identified a 50 kDa cellular membrane protein, which is thought to be a specific receptor for BVDV. In this study, flow cytometric analyses demonstrated that the anti-ids also specifically bound to different cell types, namely MDBK, EBK, BT, PK15, MA104, and Vero. Experiments on virus attachment and replication showed that BVDV adsorbed to all cells and replicated in them except monkey kidney cells MA104 and Vero (non-permissive). Results from plaque reduction assays indicated that cellular membrane proteins from all cell lines competitively inhibited BVDV attachment to cultured MDBK cells, suggesting the presence of BVDV receptor on all cells. Immunoblotting of cell membrane proteins with the anti-ids revealed a 50 kDa protein in both permissive and nonpermissive cells. Subcloned or synchronized MDBK cells demonstrated no significant difference of binding with anti-ids as compared to normal cultured cells.",

The interactions between specific viral surface proteins and receptors on target cells may play an important role in determining virus tropism and pathogenicity. Viral receptors so far identified are normal constituents of the cell membrane and usually function as receptors for physiological ligands (Fingeroth et al., 1984; Eppstein et al., 1985; Maddon et al., 1986; Kaner et al., 1990) . Some of the receptor molecules function as viral receptors for several viruses. Two neural cell-specific molecules, the acetylcholine and /3-adrenergic receptors, have been identified as attachment proteins for rabies virus and reovirus type 3 (Co et al., 1985; Kucera et al., 1985; Lentz, 1985) . Some molecules, like mannosedphosphate and heparin sulfate, which are used for initial binding by varicella-zoster and herpes simplex viruses (Gabel et al., 1989; Wudunn and Spear, 1989) ) are present on many types of cells. Therefore, the tissue tropism of the viruses must not be controlled by the receptor molecules alone. The receptor molecules for mouse hepatitis virus in some strains of mouse are functional, but the mice are resistant to infection by the virus (Yokomori and Lai, 1992) .",

Neutralizing monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) specific for the gp53 neutralized a majority of BVDV strains (Xue et al., 1990) ) and rabbit polyclonal anti-idiotypic antibodies (anti-ids) raised against the mAbs specific for gp53 mimicked the BVDV antigen (Xue et al., 1991) .

Briefly, MDBK cells in 75 cm* tissue culture flasks (Fisher Scientifics, St. Louis, MO) were infected with virus at a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 1 and incubated at 37\u00b0C in the presence of 20 @i [ 35S] -methionine (DuPont.

Three flasks of each BVDV-infected cells and non-infected cells were harvested for the virus preparation. The viruses were frozen at -70\u00b0C then thawed, and clarified by centrifugation for 30 min at 4000 g ( Sorvall RC-5B Superspeed centrifuge, DuPont Instruments). The clarified viruses were concentrated by centrifugation at 100 000 g for 5 h using SW27 rotor in a Beckman L5-65 ultracentrifuge. The pelleted viruses were purified by gradient centrifugation overnight through 10 to 40% potassium tartrate. The band in the centrifuge tube between 30% and 40% potassium tartrate layers contained highest virus titer (2 X lo* PFU/ml) as detected by plaque assay. The virus specific activity (0.3 X 1O-3 CPM/PFU) was determined by scintillation counting. The 35S-labeled uninfected MDBK cells were prepared in the same way as the viruses were prepared. The same band in potassium tartrate gradient was collected by using a long Pasteur pipet. The radioactivity of the cellular protein was detected by scintillation counting and finally the radioactivity concentration of the cellular protein was adjusted to 6 X 104CPM/ml that was the same as labeled viruses.

Results showed that the radioactive-labelled BVDV specifically attached to MDBK cells in a dosedependent manner ( Fig. 2A) . At concentration of 30 to 40 ,ul of viruses, the attachment reached to the highest level. However, the 35S-labelled cell proteins, which had the same radioactivity as virus proteins, did not attach to cells. The attachment was inhibited partially by pretreatment of cells with anti-D89 (Fig. 2B) . At concentration of 25 pg anti-D89, the attachment was blocked by about 50%. Anti-NMG did not inhibit this virus specific attachment. Preincubation of the cell monolayer with unlabeled (cold) BVDV also inhibited the subsequent attachment of 35S-BVDV to the cells (Fig. 2C) . The % inhibition was propor- tional to the increasing concentration of the virus. Control virus BHV-1 did not show inhibition of the virus attachment. The virus attachment was also studied in different cells using 30 ~1 of 35S-BVDV, and the results revealed specific virus adsorption in all cells (Fig. 2D) . These results indicated that BVDV specifically binds not only to bovine cells but also to porcine and monkey cells, and these all cells presumAbly have receptor components on the surface. Fig. 3 illustrates the titers of BVDV grown in different cells and harvested at varied times. At 0 h, the BVDV showed titer of approximately 5 X lo2 PFU/ml in all cells, suggesting that the virus adsorbed to all cells at the same level. In bovine cells (MDBK, BT, and EBK) , the virus titer increased gradually at different harvesting times and finally reached 1.6X IO6 PFU/ml at 48 h postinfection (PI). In PK15, the virus titer dropped slightly at 12 h PI and then increased gradually to 5 X lo5 PFU/ml at 72 h PI. Although BVDV adsorption did occur in monkey kidney cells, the virus did not replicate and the residual virus could not be detected after 12 -24 h. These results suggested that adsorption alone is not a unique function leading to BVDV productive infection of cells. Other factors, like entry and uncoating also may play crucial roles in the virus infection process.",

            "text": "In the previous study, using internal image anti-idiotypic antibodies, we isolated a 50 kDa putative BVDV receptor protein from MDBK cells (Xue and Minocha, 1993) . Present study revealed that this 50 kDa protein also exists in other cell lines, including BVDV permissive bovine cells, porcine kidney cells, and nonpermissive monkey kidney cells. BVDV attached and replicated in all bovine cells. The virus in porcine kidney cells needed a longer time to replicate to the same level as observed in bovine cells (Fig. 3) . BVDV did not replicate in monkey kidney cells, however, MA 104 and Vero cells expressed functional receptors for BVDV because BVDV anti-ids specifically bound to the cells and BVDV attached to the cells. Most importantly, immunoblotting with anti-ids revealed the 50 kDa protein from these cells. Recently, Harding and Molitor ( 1992) reported that a mAb that recognizes cell receptor for porcine parvovirus detected a virus receptor polypeptide from both permissive and nonpermissive cell lines. The receptor for mouse hepatitis virus also was found to be functional in the resistant mouse strain (Yokomori and Lai, 1992) . Therefore, it is reasonable to suggest that there are some post-attachment restriction to virus growth and some other factor(s) may be required for virus entry and replication and may determine the virus host specificity. It also could reflect that the receptors on different cells may either be functional or non-functional to virus infection. In our experiment, the 50 kDa protein, a putative receptor for BVDV might be functional in bovine cells and relatively weakly functional in porcine cells. On the other hand, monkey kidney cells may lack functional receptor protein. Attachment to a cell receptor may not be the only essential step for a virus to infect a target cell. In fact, cell receptor-independent infection by a neurotropic murine coronavirus has been observed (Gallagher et al., 1992) . Therefore, different viruses may have novel ways for infection of host cells.",

            "text": "Multiple receptors are involved in virus attachment and entry in several virus systems, such as reoviruses (Choi et al., 1990; Paul and Lee, 1987; Verdin et al., 1989) and alphaviruses (Wang et al., 1991) . For BVDV, virus attachment and penetration mediated by multiple receptors are very possible. Anti-ids against BVDV-specific mAb only partially inhibited BVDV infection (Xue et al., 1991) and specifically bind to only about 40-50% of the cells. A mAb that recognized a bovine cell surface protein could not completely inhibit BVDV infection (Collett et al., 1989) . We believe that the 50 kDa protein is an important receptor for BVDV, and more further studies need to be carried out to address if there are multiple receptors for BVDV or multiple binding sites on the same receptor. Besides the cell lines we described above, anti-D89 also bound specifically to baby hamster kidney cells (BHK), equine kidney (EK), and canine kidney cells (MDCK) (data not shown). This indicated that the membrane proteins bound by the anti-ids are very common to tissue culture cells. Studies on expression of human cytomegalovirus receptor revealed that the virus receptor proteins presented on several kinds of cells (fibroblast, epithelial, monocytoid, and lymphoid) from different species (human, simian, and rodent) except insect cells (Nowlin et al., 1991) .",

The SV40 receptor was expressed at high levels only by a subset of cells in the monol.ayer (Basak et al., 1992) . A controversy over the receptor expression for reovirus on Rl. 1 cells leads to a suggestion that two distinct subpopulations of Rl. 1 cells may exist (El-Ghorr et al., 1992) . We cloned MDBK cells and used anti-ids in the receptor binding assay. No differences were found among the cloned cells and between cloned and noncloned cells in binding by anti-ids, suggesting the lack of subpopulations of MDBK cells with greater affinity for BVDV. The low percentage of binding by anti-ids may have been due to a multiple receptor requirement for BVDV infection. Another explanation might be that only a small part of anti-id response is an \"internal image\" response (Urbain et al., 1984) . However, a subpopulation of MDBK cells was recently found to be non-susceptible to BVDV infection (Donis, University of Nebraska, Personal Communication). Therefore more studlies are needed to address this aspect.",

Some receptor expressions are cellcycle-dependent, and these include the SV40 (Basak et al., 1992) , CD4 (Martin et al., 1991) , and transferrin receptors (Kute and Quadri, 1991) . However, our results with synchronized MDBK cells demonstrated that the anti-id binding is cell-cycle-independent, suggesting that BVDV receptor expression does not depend on the cell cycle. Therefore, the relationship of receptor expression to cell cycle may be more pronounced in some viruses than in others and in some cells than in others.",

Cell membrane proteins (M.P.) from all cell lines reduced the plaque numbers of virus, and this reduction was reversed partially by preincubation of membrane proteins with anti-D89 (M.P. + > D89) but not anti-NMG (M.P. + > NMG). The results indicated that similar protein components which are attached by BVDV occur on the surface of cells from all sources. BVDV with the cell membrane proteins (M.P.) from MDBK, BT, EBK, PK15 and Vero cells and by 28.6% with membrane proteins from MA104 cells. To verify the specificity of the inhibition of virus infection by the membrane proteins, we incubated the membrane proteins with anti-D89 (M.P. + > D89) or anti-NMG (M.P. + > NMG) prior to the incubation of virus with the proteins.",
