Streptococcus equi subsp. zooepidemicus has been isolated from severe cases of respiratory disease that were frequently fatal [8] .

The presence of CRCoV in dogs was first described in a large study of dogs with CIRD [9] . In this investigation, performed at a shelter, clinical signs were graded by veterinary clinicians into (1) no signs of respiratory disease; (2) mild cough; (3) mild cough and nasal discharge; (4) cough, nasal discharge, and inappetence; and (5) severe respiratory disease with evidence of bronchopneumonia. Because of a small number of samples in grade 4, grades 3 and 4 were merged and referred to as ''moderate respiratory disease.'' CRCoV was most frequently detected in the trachea of dogs with mild clinical signs (grade 2). It was less frequently recovered from dogs with moderate or severe clinical signs or from dogs without clinical signs at the time of sampling. CRCoV was also detected in the lung, albeit less frequently. Table 1 summarizes the detection of CRCoV in clinical samples from dogs. After 3 weeks of stay at a shelter, almost 100% of dogs tested positive for antibodies to CRCoV compared with 30% on the day of entry, indicating that the virus was highly prevalent in the population and was easily transmitted. It was also found that the presence of antibodies to CRCoV on the day of entry led to a significantly reduced risk for contracting CIRD, supporting the hypothesis that CRCoV played a role in the etiology of the disease [9] .",

Almost all dogs housed at the kennel showed seroconversion to CRCoV after the outbreaks. Moreover, CRCoV was detected by PCR in two oropharyngeal swabs taken from dogs with clinical respiratory disease. Not all dogs that developed antibodies to CRCoV also showed signs of CIRD; nevertheless, this was the second study associating CRCoV with respiratory disease in dogs. Two further studies identified CRCoV in nasal and oral swabs from dogs in Japan that had respiratory disease [22, 23] . An analysis of 126 archival tissue blocks of cases of respiratory disease identified two CRCoV-positive samples by immunohistochemistry. Both were from dogs with bronchitis and bronchiolitis, and CRCoV antigen was found to be present in respiratory columnar epithelial cells. One of those dogs was also positive for canine distemper virus [12] . The detection rate of CRCoV in the archival study may seem quite low; however, the tissue samples were mostly derived from dogs with severe respiratory disease with a fatal outcome, whereas CRCoV has mostly been associated with mild respiratory disease so far.",

In those states that allowed a meaningful interpretation of seroprevalence (more than 10 samples), the prevalence ranged from 31.3% (Maine) to 87.5% (Kentucky). The prevalence in the United Kingdom and the Republic of Ireland was lower, with 36% and 30.3%, respectively [24] .

This is in contrast to the prevalence of enteric CCoV, which is frequently found in dogs younger than 1 year of age [10] . This may reflect different patterns of transmission of the two viruses. The seroprevalence of CRCoV was increasing after the age of 1 year for all studies and then reached a plateau between the ages of 2 and approximately 8 years. This is probably a consequence of the greater probability of exposure to the virus with increasing contact with other dogs. It is not certain how long CRCoV antibody levels in dogs remain stable after infection. One study showed a twofold decrease in antibody titers in 6 of 14 dogs tested and a fourfold decrease in 4 dogs in less than 1 year [21] . Because these were naturally occurring infections, it is not known if the antibody response measured reflected primary or repeated infections.

Nevertheless, they have the potential to reduce the number of circulating pathogens if given to all dogs on entry.

Coronaviruses are inactivated by disinfectants commonly used for surface disinfection in kennels and veterinary practices. The role of fecal shedding and the potential transmission of CRCoV among dogs sharing common facilities, such as outdoor runs, have yet to be resolved. Other generally recommended measures, such as washing one's hands after handling animals with respiratory disease should also help to reduce the spread of the virus. CRCoV has been detected in dogs up to 4 weeks after entry into a kennel. Because the time of infection in those naturally occurring cases is not known, it is unclear how long CRCoV is being shed. After experimental infection of dogs with BCoV, the virus was detected in a rectal swab after 11 days [29] . Quarantine of newly arriving dogs, if feasible in training kennels or shelters, should therefore last for at least 2 weeks.",

Although CCoV has been isolated from the lung after experimental infections [33] , it was generally considered to be restricted to the gastrointestinal tract during naturally occurring infection. Recently, an outbreak of a systemic fatal disease was described from which a type II CCoV was isolated [34] . Although the dogs presented with vomiting, diarrhea, and neurologic signs, postmortem examination also revealed bronchopneumonia. CCoV was detected in internal organs, including the lung, kidney, and brain. Sequence analysis of the CCoV isolate identified a mutation in open reading frame 3b, leading to a truncated nonstructural protein. It is not clear if this mutation is responsible for the extended tropism of this isolate [35] . Further studies are required to determine the presence of type II CCoVs in cases of severe systemic disease and in cases of respiratory disease.",

CRCoV is frequently detected in dogs with clinical respiratory signs and may contribute to the CIRD complex. Increased awareness of the existence of CRCoV and the development of routinely available diagnostic tests should enhance our knowledge of the presence of CRCoV in canine populations with and without respiratory disease. It is recommended to use PCR methods or serology on paired serum samples to diagnose CRCoV infections, because the sensitivity of virus isolation is low. Identification of causative agents during outbreaks of respiratory disease in canine populations ought to be performed more frequently. This would help to determine the importance of individual viruses and bacteria, not only in the investigated population but in the CIRD complex as a whole. The etiology of CIRD is multifactorial and is likely to change continuously, because some pathogens are controlled by vaccination, although other infectious agents emerge to take their place.",
