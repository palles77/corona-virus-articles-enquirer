Estimating the impacts of the swine flu for the first 12 months' post-swine flu period, we have predicted the number of tourists by fitting two auto regressive integrated moving average models: one for the swine flu and another for the global financial crisis which occurred and affected the number of tourist arrivals; and one intervention time series analysis model. It is shown that the number of tourists have been reduced significantly due to both the swine flu and the global financial crisis, which is reconfirmed by testing the coefficients of the fitted intervention time series analysis model. It is found that a small country like Brunei lost nearly 30, 000 (15%) tourists and B$15 million dollars due to the swine flu during the first twelve months' post-swine flu period.",

This may be a useful contribution to both policy makers, practitioners and to the tourism literature. Brunei is a small country with a population of 400,000 people. It is situated on the north-west side of the Island of Borneo and it has oil and gas reserves. The country is quite safe and tolerant for all types of ethnic people and it attracts many foreign tourists every year from various countries. For example, 226,000 tourists visited Brunei in 2008 (Brunei Tourism Development Department, 2010 .",

Then a small window of world economic recovery was observed. But then the world faced another crisis by the news of outbreak of A (H1N1) virus which is popularly known as swine flu (SF). Swine Flu occurs when people are in contact through talking or sitting or walking near the infected person/s and in contact with infected secretions produced through sneezing, coughing, spitting or transfer after touching infected areas. This is a serious infectious disease which people have every reason to fear (Denoon & Hitti, 2010; and Ministry of Health: Brunei Darussalam, 2010) . The presence of the A (H1N1) virus affected Brunei sharply and its effect on tourism was serious across the world including Brunei.",

Mahdini (2010) described how Brunei's government took every possible preventative measure to avoid SF and to boost the confidence of the people. Brunei's government was prepared to face the outbreak as early as May 2, 2009 but Brunei's residents were already panicking by the end of May 2009. These measures failed to protect some of the people of Brunei from SF. A student was identified with positive A (H1N1) virus on June 20, 2009. A 12 year old girl became the first fatality on July 2, 2009. The recorded infected numbers were increasing at a rapid pace and by the reopening time of schools the total number of SF infected cases reached 142 which is a very high rate in a country of less than 400,000 people (Ministry of Health: Brunei Darussalam, 2010; France Presse Agence, 2009; Melvin, 2009; and; Mahdini, 2010) . Stephen and Suni (2009) indicated that Brunei was hit very hard due to SF virus and they showed that there was a growth of 547% in H1N1 cases over the last 10 days of July 2009, which was the highest in the world, followed by Bolivia (326%). They further provided statistics and showed that 5.3 people were infected per 10,000 people in Brunei, the second highest in the world, just after Chile's 5.5 people infected per 10,000 people. All this information kept foreign tourists away from the country. Swine flu significantly reduced the number of tourists visiting Brunei, which was already suffering from the earlier GFC (World Tourism Organization, 2010) .",

This is because the ITSA is an important and useful method for analyzing the effects of crisis events on time series (TS) data. It is quasi-experimental in nature and the validity of the model depends on the timing of the intervention and the response of the process to it (see Gilmour, Degenhardt, Hall, & Day, 2006) .",

This predicted tourist number is then subtracted from the actual number for a certain post-event period and this is usually interpreted as the effect of the crisis. Most forecasting methods have the advantage of controlling long-term trends. Quantitative forecasting methods are mainly divided into two groups. First, time series (TS) methods (basic, intermediate, and advanced) which have many advantages. It is based on the assumption that the present and past behavior of the data will continue in the future, and observations at different points in time are statistically dependent. The ARIMA model is the most popular TS forecasting model. One can fit an ARIMA model to almost any TS data with the desired precision. However, there are some disadvantages for the ARIMA model such as (i) there is no way to know where to start the ARIMA model; (ii) it cannot be used for non-stationary data; (iii) it requires a large number of data points; and (iv) it is a univariate TS forecasting method and cannot be used for a multivariate TS data analysis. The ITSA model is a further development of the ARIMA model and it can measure and test the effects of intervention/s. It uses both the preand post-intervention data, whereas the ARIMA model uses only the pre-intervention data. It provides better forecasts than the ARIMA model for interrupted TS data. The vector auto-regression (VAR) model is one of the most successful, flexible, and easy to use models for the analysis of multivariate TS data and can provide better forecasts than the ARIMA model. It can be considered as one type of econometric model and it possesses all the advantages of the regression method. Also, the size of the model is not a concern. However, this can be estimated by various ways and hence it can give a wide variety of different forecasts.",

However, the difficulty of applying the causal methods is identifying the appropriate independent variables that affect the forecast variable. Structural models are more transparent as they can check if the predicted behavior by the model for each component corresponds to what is expected from the data. The structural forecasting method is relatively straightforward, and missing observations are easier to treat. It can also manipulate multivariate series by direct extension of the univariate structural formulation which is not possible with the ARIMA model. Many researchers forecast with structural models for economic analysis and use the term \"econometric model forecasts\" and these are routinely used for econometric policy analysis. The main advantages of econometric models are: (i) this method possesses all the advantages of the regression method, (ii) the size of the model is not a problem; and (iii) to estimate and solve the model using software packages is easy. However, the accurate forecasting of these two causal models depends on the quality of independent variables that affect the forecast variable (see Chen, Bloomfield, & Cubbage, 2008 for comparing forecasting models in tourism).",

For example, the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) is a serious disease which affected tourism in most Asian countries. Many authors have analyzed the impacts of various disease outbreaks on travel and tourism for various countries using econometric methods (Chen, Jang, & Kim, 2007; Chien & Law, 2003; Kou, Chen, Tseng, Ju, & Huang, 2008; McAleer, Huang, Kuo, Chen, & Chang, 2010; McKercher & Chon, 2004; WTTC, 2003; Wilder-Smith, 2006; Tung & Chao, 2011; Oukil, Channouf, & Al-Zaidi, 2016; Cuhadar, 2014) . By contrast, Cankurt and Subasi (2016) , Song, Li, Witt, and Athanasopoulos (2011), Turner (2015) and many others used structural TS analysis to model and forecast tourist demand. On the other hand, many authors such as Aboagye-Sarfo, Cross, and Mueller (2016), Zheng, Farrish, and Kitterlin (2016) , Hayashi (2013, 2014) , Chung, Ip, and Chan (2009) and many others used the ARIMA and ITSA methods to evaluate the impacts of various crisis events. An excellent survey of the literature on the evaluation of crisis events can be found in Hall (2010) and Goh and Law (2011) .",

Min (2008a) evaluated how Taiwan's inbound tourism was affected by the September 21st, 1999 Earthquake and SARS in 2003, using the ARIMA and ITSA methods. She showed that Taiwan was hit hard by these two calamities. Min (2008b) and Min and Kung (2007) analyzed inbound tourism demand for Taiwan using the ARIMA and ITSA models. Min, Wu, and Wu (2006) also forecasted outbound tourist arrivals using the ITSA model. Bonham and Gangnes (1996) used the ITSA to measure the effect of Hawaii hotel and room tax on tourism. Coshall (2003) , Lee, Oh, and O'Leary (2005) and Ismail, Suhartono, Yahaya, and Efendi (2009) evaluated the threat of terrorism on international travel flow using the ITSA method. Goh and Law (2002) also used the ITSA method to forecast tourism demand. Chen (2011), Engin (2015) and many others have evaluated the effects of various crisis events on tourism, using the ARIMA and ITSA techniques.

It should be noted that 126,000 tourists arrived in 2005 and it increased to 226,000 in 2008 just before the GFC, and then declined to 157,000 tourists after the occurrence of both the GFC and SF (Brunei Tourism Development Department, 2010) . The department only considered entry for overnight transit, government exhibition, business, holidays, visiting friends and relatives as foreign tourists. These are generally considered as the most accurate, complete, and authentic data and are used to estimate the number of tourists lost during the first 12 months post-SF period. At present, there is no information about the activities of tourists in Brunei. In order to get information about the activities of the tourists, we have randomly surveyed a representative sample of 600 (200 and 400 respectively in pre-and post-SF periods) eligible departing adult tourists from Brunei Airport as well as from various shopping centers and restaurants, who did not work and stayed at least one night in Brunei such that each person was selected only once. We then collected information from each of the selected foreign tourists about their length of stay and other costs associated with food, accommodation, transport, shopping and sight-seeing which can be seen from Table 6 , and these are used to estimate their spending while they stayed in Brunei. These are then used to estimate the total amount of money lost by the country due to the loss of tourists during the first 12 months post-SF period.",

First, we use the ARIMA model to predict the number of tourists using the pre-SF data on the assumption that the past and present behavior of the data will continue. The data series should be stabilized before forecasting. It is a general practice to plot the raw data to see if there is any irregular variation, trend, seasonality, and/or other behavior that can be observed. Most often differencing the data can be used to achieve stationarity. Otherwise more sophisticated techniques of TS data analysis such as the ARIMA model should be applied to predict the number of tourists for the post-SF period.",

Using the estimated parameters of the chosen model, forecasts are made for the post-SF period. In practice TS data are subject to various interventions and hence the ARIMA model alone cannot produce accurate forecasts. Under this situation, the ITSA method can incorporate various interventions with the ARIMA model and can produce a more reliable and accurate forecast.

More importantly it can test the intervention coefficients to see whether the interventions significantly reduced the tourist numbers by using a one-tailed t-test.",

Our test statistic of \u00c01.98 is greater than the interpolated Dickey and Fuller critical value \u00c03.49 for 66 observations indicating that the null hypothesis cannot be rejected. This means our data has unit root and it is non-stationary. It is also seen from Fig. 1 that our monthly tourist arrival data has seasonal variation which can be deterministic or stochastic (Hylleberg, 1995; Osborn, Heravi, & Birchenhall, 1999 and Taylor, 1998 . The regression model handles the deterministic process using seasonal dummies. Stochastic process can be stationary or non-stationary which can be investigated by testing the null hypothesis that the data has a seasonal unit root. Thus, the data should be made stationary to make reliable forecasts. In this study, we investigate the seasonal aspects of the data by various tests of seasonality and efforts are made to eliminate the seasonality to make the data stable before making forecasts.",

We then used the HEGY test due to Hylleberg, Engle, Granger, and Yoo (1990) to test the null hypothesis of a certain number of seasonal and non-seasonal unit roots in a TS against the alternative hypothesis that the data has no unit roots. The results of the HEGY test are provided in Table 1 and show that all the test statistics at various frequency levels are higher than the corresponding critical values and hence the null hypothesis H 0 cannot be rejected at all frequency levels. This indicates that the data has a non-seasonal unit root corresponding to zero frequency and hence our data is non-stationary. Therefore, its differentiation with filter (1 e B) is required. Moreover, the test accepts the null hypothesis H 0 at all frequency levels showing the presence of unit roots at all seasonal frequencies. Hence, the filter (1 e B 12 ) is required as recommended by Box and Jenkins (1970) depending on the fact that the series is integrated at the seasonal frequency at all levels of frequencies including zero. Because of this the product of the non-seasonal and seasonal filters: (1 \u00c0 B) (1 \u00c0 B 12 ) is applied to stablize the seasonal and non-seasonal variation of the data. The Canova and Hansen (1995) test is then employed to test the stability of the data. The Canova-Hansen test results are presented in Table 2 which shows that all calculated statistics are less than the corresponding critical values. Further, this shows that the data has no seasonal unit root and is now stable, although our original data had a stochastic trend and seasonality. To avoid these problems, we differenced our data at non-seasonal and seasonal levels and apply various tests showing that our data became stationary after first differencing at non-seasonal and seasonal levels with lag length one (Ng & Perron, 2001) .",

The estimated parameters of the best model for each of the data series have satisfied the stationarity and invertibility criteria. The best ARIMA models selected for each of the data series are presented in Table 3 . Further diagnostic checks of residuals and autocorrelations for each of the models clearly indicate that the models are acceptable. This can be seen from the Q statistic of Table 3 which shows that the calculated values of Q-statistic for each of the models are less than 1, which is < c 2 .05,8 \u00bc 15.50, indicating that we cannot reject the null hypothesis for any one of those selected best models, implying that each of the selected best models adequately fit the data. Also, the standard errors of both the fitted models are very small and hence can be expected to give good forecasts.

It is noted that the impacts of the GFC is long lived or, in other words, the recovery was prolonged and as such a pulse function is appropriate for the GFC. Thus, the SF shock was really a temporary deviation from the slow recovery of the GFC and hence a step function is appropriate for the SF shock. Thus, a combination of pulse and step functions were added to the best selected ARIMA model for the SF and used to estimate an intervention model of type (1), using the entire data set: January 2005eMay 2010.

The techniques used here successfully separate the effects of the SF from the GFC on tourism, which occurred earlier and continued after the occurrence of the SF for the period from June 2009 to May 2010. The use of a control group which is free from SF and the GFC may have produced better estimates, but it is difficult to find an appropriate control group. We did not consider other possible interventions that might have affected tourism in Brunei such as the 1997-98 East Asian Economic Crisis (particularly currency crisis in Indonesia and Malaysia), the 2007e2008 Oil shock, the 2010 Arab Spring, etc., (Hamilton, 2011) . It seems none of these factors, other than the GFC and SF affected tourism in Brunei during our study period. This is Table 7 Comparison of tourist arrival in Brunei from major countries and market areas in different years: JanuaryeJune a . because a wide range of tourist attractions across the region drew 81 million tourists to ASEAN in 2011, up by 30% compared to 62 million tourists in 2007. In 2010, 47% (34 million) of 73 million tourists in ASEAN countries came from other ASEAN countries (Association of Southeast Asian Nations, 2011). This implies that the reduction of tourists in Brunei may likely to be due to the GFC and SF. In addition to these the effects of cyclical components have also not been considered here which might have affected our estimates of tourists to Brunei.",

More importantly, the techniques used here can easily be extended to disentangle the effects of many interventions which may occur during a certain time-period. On the other hand, structural time series models provide a broader framework and allow the parameters to change over time which is not yet used widely to measure uncertain events.

These countries will benefit by adopting the methods presented in this study to measure the effects of unforeseen events for successful and sustainable tourism development. Marketers of these countries can continuously monitor the changes of attitudes in tourists and can develop appropriate policies accordingly. Thus, this study will help Brunei and other similar countries in South East Asia to improve tourist numbers by various marketing strategies such as advertisements, tour packages etc. To evaluate these strategies for a certain postcampaign period they can use the techniques developed here to measure any associated changes in tourism. Also, it is recommended that the tourism authority should strongly advertise about the safety and security of the environment and accommodation together with recreational facilities and the natural beauty of the country to minimize feelings of uncertainty, which helps tourists to overcome their fears in travelling to Brunei.",

Generally, May is considered as a high tourist arrival month but we notice that there is adownturn of tourists in the months of May and June 2009. Only 24,466 tourists came to Brunei in MayeJune 2009 compared to 42,787 in the same period in 2008, indicating that the combined effects of the GFC and SF reduced tourists by 18,321 (42.8%) in the months of May & June 2009. Also, 26,343 tourists came in the months of March & April 2009 showing that there was a reduction of 1877 (7.12%) tourists in the months of May & June, which may be due to SF. Therefore, we notice that there are two intervention points: June 2009 for SF and September 2008 for the GFC (Brunei Tourism Development Department, 2010).",
