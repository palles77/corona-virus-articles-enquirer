            "text": "Schmallenberg virus (SBV), discovered in 2011 in Germany, is associated with clinical manifestations of fever, diarrhea, reduced milk yield, abortions and congenital malformations in ruminants. Despite many studies performed for SBV, there is no detailed research on in vitro apoptotic effect of SBV. This study is aimed to determine apoptosis pathways and role of proapoptotic and anti-apoptotic molecules in Vero cells infected with SBV. The study results showed that SBV induced apoptosis via both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways by activating both caspase-8 and caspase-9, respectively. Expression analyses of pro-apoptotic (Bax, Bak and Puma) and anti-apoptotic (Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL) genes revealed that SBV-induced apoptosis causes upregulation of pro-apoptotic genes, dominantly via Puma gene, whereas Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL genes were downregulated. In conclusion, this is the first detailed report about SBV induced apoptosis in the Vero cells via both extrinsic and intrinsic cascades and apoptosis induction is seem to be regulated by Puma.",

            "text": "doi: 10 .1292/jvms. Apoptosis could occur in both physiological conditions such embryonic development, immune cell selection and in pathological status like mutations, DNA damage and certain infections [9] . Some viruses can induce or inhibit apoptosis in cells by their proteins. Inhibition of apoptosis could be needed for persistent infection and viral replication whereas induction of apoptosis could be because of lytic infection and viral spread without any inflammation. African swine fever virus, fowl poxvirus, bovine herpesvirus-5 are some viruses that inhibit apoptosis following infection of cells [5, 14, 19] . Certain apoptosis inducing viruses including Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, bluetongue virus, Akabane virus, Aino and Chuzan viruses [16, 18, 24] . Although apoptotic induction of CPT-Tert and HEK-293T cell lines by SBV was detected with caspase-3/-7 activation [7] there was no information about apoptotic effect of SBV on Vero cell line. Vero cell line is widely used for SBV isolation, plaque titration and plaque reduction neutralization tests and antigen preparation [17, 31] . There is one study about apoptosis and SBV in pubmed according to our knowledge [7] . Because of inadequacy of detailed information on SBV-induced apoptosis, in present study, apoptosis in Vero cell line was investigated with DNA fragmentation, caspase activation, Annexin-V/PI staining and expression analyses of pro-and anti-apoptotic genes, further time and dose dependent analyses were performed.",

Results of this study on DNA fragmentation of SBV infected Vero cells was detected as being dependent on infection time and dose of virus. First DNA fragmentation of SBV infected cells were seen on 18 hr pi at 0.1 MOI and on 24 hr pi at 0.01 MOI of SBV (Fig. 1) . Virus dose and infection time can affect the first DNA fragmentation appearance on virus-infected cells. A detectable DNA laddering at the 2 MOI of H9N2 virus infected A549 cells was detected at 16 hr pi [28] whereas all 0.1, 1 and 10 MOI of chikungunya virus infected cells showed DNA fragmentation at 48 hr pi [1] . Cells under physiological conditions have phosphatidylserine on inner leaflet of plasma membrane. During apoptosis induction in cells phosphatidylserine become exposed on outer leaflet of plasma membrane and display \"eat me\" signal to phagocytes [27] . Annexin V, an anticoagulant protein which binds to phosphatidylserine, is used for detection of apoptosis incidence in cells. Propidium iodide (PI) which is used widely with combination of Annexin V is a plasma membrane permeability marker. When used combined together cells could be seperated into 4 groups: live (Annexin V\u2212/PI\u2212), early apoptotic (Annexin V+/PI\u2212), late apoptotic (Annexin V+/PI+) and necrotic (Annexin V\u2212/PI+) cells [33] . Flow cytometry results showed that highest apoptotic cell rate were in 48 hr pi samples in infection of 0.1 MOI (Fig. 2A) . Early apoptosis rates were 24.04% and 17.1% while late apoptosis rates were 13.8% and 5.6% in 0.1 and 0.01 MOI of SBV infected cells, respectively (Fig. 2) . This is the first results of apoptosis detection of SBV infected Vero cells by using Annexin V/PI staining in flow cytometry. Apoptotic cell percentage could be affected by virus species/strain, virus dose, cell line and time of infection. Early and late apoptotic cells were detected as 61-75 and 13-19%, respectively, in HeLa cells transfected with canine parvovirus-2 NS1 encoding vector [25] . It is surprising that phosphatidylserine externalization starts in the early time in the flow cytometry results but it is not seen caspase-3 activation until 36 hr pi.",

Caspase-8 activation in cells at 0.1 MOI initiated from 18 hr pi and reached maximum level at 48 hr pi. Activated caspase-8 levels were slightly high at first hours of infection and interestingly peaked at 18 hr pi at 0.01 MOI (Fig. 3) . Caspase-9 activation of SBV infected cells was investigated to find out if intrinsic pathway is triggered. Likely caspase-8, activation of caspase-9 at 0.1 MOI has reached to highest level at 48 hr pi. Cell group infected with 0.1 MOI of SBV has higher proportion of activated caspase-9, while activation of caspase-9 indicated moderate but significant increases at 0.01 MOI and interestingly, stayed almost unchanged during the time (Fig. 3) . These data indicate that SBV induce intrinsic cascade. Crimean-Congo hemorrhagic fever virus (CCHV) which is another member of family Peribunyaviridae induces apoptosis via both extrinsic and intrinsic pathways [6] . Many research reported that pro-apoptotic genes like Bak, Bax and Puma are upregulated when apoptosis induced in cells. Bak gene was upregulated in Hepatitis C virus infected tissues and HepG2 cell lines associated with apoptosis induction [34] . Chicken fibroblast cells infected with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) showed increased Bak gene levels as 1.39 and 2.09 fold after 8 and 16 hr pi, respectively. Bak levels were 6.41 fold increased in IBV infected chicken embryos after 48 hr pi [35] . In this study, at 48 hr pi Bak gene levels normalized to GAPDH were found increased approximately as 0.93 fold in 0.1 MOI and 1.40 fold in 0.01 MOI (Fig. 4) , whereas levels normalized to Beta actin were found approximately 0.25 fold in 0.1 MOI and 0.14 fold in 0.01 MOI (Fig. 5) . In normalization to GAPDH reference gene, Bak gene expression was upregulated, whereas the gene was downregulated according to Beta actin normalization. These data indicates that SBV infection has minor effect on Bak gene. Although certain viruses can affect or interact with Bak [32, 35] , there is no study that investigate whether SBV interact with Bak protein in cellular level. Bax gene expression level was found to be increased in canine distemper virus infected dog's cerebellum as approximately 9.8 fold [8] . According to GAPDH normalization in this study Bax gene were increased approximately 1.47 fold in 0.1 MOI and 3.02 fold in 0.01 MOI of SBV in 48 hr pi in Vero cells (Fig. 4) . Bax gene was upregulated as 0.39 fold in 0.1 MOI and 0.30 fold in 0.01 MOI in 48 hr pi of SBV infection when expression level was normalized to Beta actin (Fig. 5) .",

In this study Bcl-2/Bax rate was 0.82 in 2 hr pi and 0.19 in 48 hr pi in 0.1 MOI of SBV, whereas 0.36 in 2 hr pi and decreasing to 0.16 in 48 hr pi in 0.01 MOI, according to both normalization with GAPDH and Beta actin, indicating that SBV induce apoptosis by affecting apoptosis related genes. Another anti-apoptotic gene Bcl-XL inhibits mitochondrial permeabilization in cells and prevents apoptosis. Bcl-XL/Bax rate in 0.1 MOI of SBV infected Vero cells was 0.86 in 2 hr pi and 0.88 in 48 hr pi. For 0.01 MOI, Bcl-XL/Bax rate was 0.48 in 2 hr pi and decreasing to 0.45 in 48 hr pi.

            "text": "Puma is pro-apoptotic gene which has critical role on apoptosis induced by wide range of stimuli such as toxins, endoplasmic reticulum stress, ischemia and infections. CCHV causes upregulation of Puma gene in Huh7 cell line at both 1 and 0.1 MOI [24] . Puma is found to be induced in HIV envelope transfected HeLa cells [21] . In present study Puma is upregulated in Vero cells at the highest level in comparison to other pro-apoptotic genes investigated (Figs. 4, and 5). In GAPDH normalization statistically significance (P<0.01) is determined for 0.1 MOI and 0.01 MOI infected cells in comparison to mock infected group at 48 hr pi and 36 hr pi, respectively, for Puma (Fig. 4) . The results of Beta actin normalization indicated that the cells at 18 and 48 hr pi of 0.1 MOI and the cells at 2, 6, 18, 24, 36, and 48 hr pi of 0.01 MOI have shown statistically significance (P<0.01) when compared to mock infected group, causing upregulation of Puma gene in Vero cells (Fig. 5) . These results are thought to be related with apoptosis of Vero cells by SBV could be induced dominantly via Puma gene, as given that Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV), another member of Peribunyaviridae, is shown to use p53 pathways and cause upregulation of Puma [3] . Activation and/or utilization of p53 pathways upon SBV infection still remain unclear. This is the first detailed study of apoptosis induction in Vero cells caused by SBV infection. Results of this study showed that SBV induce apoptosis via both intrinsic and extrinsic pathways and moreover intrinsic pathway induction could be modulated over Puma gene. To understand the whole molecular mechanisms used by SBV in both Vero and other cell lines, more detailed studies should be performed in future.",

DNA fragmentation assay of 0.1 and 0.01 MOI of SBV infected cells were visualized on 2% agarose gel. DNA fragmentation of SBV infected Vero cells was dependent on infection time and dose of virus, as DNA fragmentation of 0.1 MOI of SBV infected cells initiated on 18 hr pi while 0.01 MOI of SBV infected cells showed first DNA fragmentation on 24 hr pi. Positive control of apoptosis (Staurosporine) was positive in DNA fragmentation and mock infected control cells showed no DNA fragmentation(Fig. 1).",

In cells infected with 0.01 MOI of SBV, there is statistically significance (P<0.01) in different MOI doses and in between time points and mock infected group.

For Puma gene, the cells infected with 0.1 MOI (at 18 and 48 hr pi) and 0.01 MOI (at 2, 6, 18, 24, 36, and 48 hr pi) have shown statistically significance (P<0.01) and when compared to mock infected group. The Beta actin normalization results demonstrated that SBV causes upregulation of Puma gene in Vero cells, however does not increase the levels of pro-apoptotic genes Bak and Bax and SBV infection culminated in downregulation of anti-apoptotic genes Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL. According to both GAPDH and Beta actin reference genes, Bcl-2/Bax rate was 0.19 and 0.16 in 48 hr pi in 0.1 and 0.01 MOI infections, respectively. Similarly, Bcl-XL/Bax rates were identical when calculated according to GAPDH and Beta actin reference genes. Rate of Bcl-XL/Bax at 48 hr pi was 0.88 and 0.45 for 0.1 and 0.01 MOI infections, respectively.",
