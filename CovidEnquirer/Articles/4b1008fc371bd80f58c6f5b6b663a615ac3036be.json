There are various possible triggers associated with the development of AHE such as Upper Respiratory Tract related infections which have been reported in the literature. A typical case of AHE is a child less than 2 years of age having the symptoms of fever, Acral Targetoid Purpura, and Edema. The course of this illness is benign with a complete resolution within few weeks. This case report involves a patient having the classical symptoms of fever, Purpura and Edema, but with an unusual extensive truncal involvement. Moreover, Rhinovirus infection testing was positive in the child's case. The presence of the virus gives a suspicion of being the possible trigger for the boy's AHE. In the previous hospital, the treatment started with steroid for a course of one week without a significant improvement which brought the patients to the Emergency department. A decision of continuing a supportive treatment led to a complete resolution. After 3 weeks the AHE symptoms were gone without any complications.",

This disease has a higher incidence during the cold months (Sorensen et al., 2014) . The main cause of AHE is still questionable. Nonetheless, various associations have been reported such as infections that may play part of its pathogenesis (Fiore et al., 2008) . Other associations have been reported like after using drugs or vaccinations (Freitas and Bygum, 2013; Findal and Kura, 2013) . AHE has a male predominance and usually affects children less than 2 years of age. Usually, the affected children have typical triad of fever, Edema of the face and extremities, and purpura of Targetoid or annular pattern, classically called cockade (rosette or iris-like) pattern (Fiore et al., 2008) . AHE diagnosis is clinically based with the skin biopsy to confirm the typical leukocytoclastic vasculitis changes (Fiore et al., 2008) . Treatment is only supportive, although there are case reports of use of systemic steroid treatment (Sorensen et al., 2014; Fiore et al., 2008; Freitas and Bygum, 2013; Risikesan et al., 2014) .",

Henoch Schonlein Purpura (HSP) is an important differential diagnosis which is more likely to occur in an older age, and it has a risk of internal involvement. As well, it has a longer duration to resolve, and the relapse has been described (Sorensen et al., 2014) . A systematic review on 294 children in a study published in 2008 by Fiore et al suggested criteria for diagnosis: targetoid purpura, nonpitting Edema and platelet count of at least 150 \u00c2 10 9 /L. The biopsy is an important tool for confirming diagnosis. Fiore et al describe the typical patient as a boy with age from 6 months to 2 years and history of respiratory infection (Fiore et al., 2008) . The unusual symptoms in our patient were the extensive truck involvement, pruritus and the presence of urticarial wheels, all of which were an uncommon feature as described by Fiore et al. (2008) . AHE may show nonspecific changes like thrombocytosis, leukocytosis, elevation of acute phase reactants, and low complement levels (Alhammadi et al., 2013) . This type of leukocytoclastic vasculitis is transient with different triggers of which are the virus infections (Fiore et al., 2008) . Rhinovirus infection was confirmed with the positive PCR in our patient which may have a causality relationship with Acute Hemorrhagic Edema. Rhinovirus association was reported in the literature with evidence of coexisting echovirus and coxsackie virus infections in a case report (Oliveira et al., 2015) .",
