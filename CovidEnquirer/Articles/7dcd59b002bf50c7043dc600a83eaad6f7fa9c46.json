            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), an important pathogen of swine neonates, belongs to the Coronaviridae, a family of enveloped viruses with a large, positive-stranded RNA as their genome [1] . Earlier studies showed that the TGEV genome consists of a unique RNA molecule, approximately 20 kb in length, which is polyadenylated and infectious similar to that of other coronaviruses [2] . Although the total number of genes encoded has not yet been determined, the TGEV genome codes for at least four polypeptides on the basis of existing protein and nucleotide data. The virions are constructed of three polypeptides, the nucleocapsid (N), the membrane (El) and the spike or peplomer (E2) polypeptides, the complete sequence of each of which has been recently established [3 -5] . These three genes account for approximately 6.3 kb of coding information. In addition, at least one non-structural polypeptide is synthesized during virus replication, an RNA dependent-RNA pol3nnerase, which requires Mg 2+ cations and is probably membrane-bound [11 ] .",

The transcription strategy has been studied in detail on the murine hepatitis virus (MHV) and infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) models. The intracellular RNA species (7 and 6 in number, respectively, ineluding the genome RNA) have been shown to form a nested set with common 3' ends. The translated sequences correspond approximately to the 5' portion which is absent in the next smaller RNA. The subgenomic RNAs contain leader and body sequences joined through a discontinuous transcription. This process relies upon the presence of a short homologous sequence in each intergenic region, most likely acting as a recognition signal for the polymerase-leader complex [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . Less information is available concerning TGEV transcription. The number of subgenomic RNA species synthesized in infected cells varies from 4 to 9 in previous literature [ 11 -14] .",

The sequence was determined on polyacrylamide buffer gradient gels [241. The whole sequence was determined on both strands. Sequencing data were analyzed using the Microgenie sequencing program (March 1985 version, Beckman). The supercoiled plasmid dideoxy-sequencing method [25] was occasionally employed to confirm partial sequence data, using oligonucleotide primers synthesized on a Biosearch 8600 apparatus. pTG2.26 had common sequences exclusively with RNA 1 and 2, whereas clones pTG2.40 (and 2.27, data not shown) possessed sequences only present in RNA 1. This result is consistent with the fact that in corona~'uses, genome RNA and subgenomic RNA species form a nested set with 3' common sequences. Additional clones were probed against clones 2.26 and 2.15, using Southern blotting. All the selected clones were mapped by restriction en-zyme analysis. The overlapping clones were shown to stretch along the 7 kb DNA (Fig. 3 ). Clones 2.21, 2.15 and 2.26 were sequenced. Subsequently, a second library (pTG6) was produced using a synthetic primer pE2 located 3.8 kb from the 3' end [5] . Resulting overlapping clones were found to extend the continuum up to 14 500 bases (Fig. 3 ) of which 8300 bases starting from the 3' end have been sequenced. ",

As suggested for MHV and IBV (see introduction), these homologous sequences are likely to act as initiation sites for the transcription of each mRNA species. Accordingly, it was postulated that the CTAAAC located immediately upstream from the ORFs X2a and X1 ORFs should correspond to the start of the mRNAs 3 and 4, respectively (see Discussion). The nonoverlapping region of mRNA 4 appeared to contain a single ORF, XI* (246 bases). The predicted sequence of mRNA 3 might allow translation of two ORFs: X2a, 213 bases long and starting 24 bases downstream from the CTAAAC sequence; and X2b, 495 bases long and starting 570 bases downstream. Three more points were noted regarding X2b: 1) no stop codon occurred up to 267 nucleotides upstream from the potential initiation codon (position 715, Fig. 5 ); 2) with its 3' end partially overlapping the X10RF, X2b is the sole ORF to stretch into the 'unique' sequence of the adjacent smaller RNA; 3) the sequence of the whole X2 region was established on 4 independent clones (see Fig. 3) .

Thus, we believe that these homologous sequences correspond to the site of translation initiation in the TGEV genome. This assumption is strengthened by the finding that the measured size of the non-overlapping region of each intracellular RNA species was in accordance with their respective predicted size (data summarized in Table I ). It is worth mentioning that the sequence CTAAAC was never present internally in a TGEV ORF, except in one case, about 150 bases after the start of the E2 gene (Table I ; [5] ). The CTAAAC sequence located upstream from the X30RF, for which no corresponding intracellular RNA species was identified (see below), might also be nonfunctional for mRNA transcription.

On the other hand, the E1 and N genes are adjacent in both MHV and TGEV genomes. The coding regions of TGEV genome are densely packed overall, yet there are almost no overlaps. The intergenic regions consist of 0-15 bases, except the E2 -X2a junction, which is 120 bases tong (Fig. 5 ). Every subgenomic RNA species appears to be functionally monocistronic, except RNA 3, which potentially allows the translation of two nonoverlapping products, X2a and X2b. It is noteworthy that MHV RNA 5 and IBV RNA D also possess a sequence arrangement which might imply an internal initiation of protein synthesis [28, 29] . This shared feature might be of biological significance, as for instance a deliberate limitation of the synthesis of the product encoded by the downstream ORF.",

In particular, codon ATC is unfrequently used for isoleucine (1/14), a bias which would not be expected from a chance ORF. The first available ATG is in an unfavorable context (CxxAUGA) for translation initiation [31] . The mRNA 3 potentially allows the synthesis of two products, X2a and X2b, 71 and 165 amino acids long, respectively. Both ORFs have ATG codon flanking sequences (TxxAUGG, TxxAUGT) which function poorly as initiation signals [31] . Their codon usage suggests that they are not chance ORFs (data not shown). The hydrophilicity profile of X2a (7711 kDa) did not reveal any special feature. The X2b product (18 833 Da) was shown to be hydrophobic overall, with a markedly acidic C-terminus comprising a cluster of 4 glutamic acid residues (position 1180, Fig. 5 ). As pointed out, the sequence of 2 of the 4 clones spanning this region predicted an alternative product X2b', 67 amino acids shorter at the C-terminus than X2b (X2b'-11 413 Da).

In vitro translation of mRNA 3 produced a 24 kDa polypeptide which neither comigrated with any intracellular viral protein nor could be immunoprecipitated with anti-virion protein antibodies [14] . A 16-17 kDa non-structural polypeptide, which was unglycosylated and which induced a late antibody response in the host, has been characterized in TGEV-infected cells [32] . A nonstructural polypeptide of similar ~ffr (15 kDa) has been observed in our laboratory, but the latter was shown to incorporate [35S]cysteine (B. Delmas & H. Laude, unpublished results), whereas no cys residue is predicted in X2b. Finally, no smaller polypeptide with an M r approaching that of X1 or X2a has been identified so far.",

However, the TGEV X1 product (Fig. 7 ) and the highly hydrophobic 7. function. In addition, TGEV X2b shows some similarities with IBV 12.4 kDa (mRNA D) and MHV 10.2 kDa (mRNA 5) translation products [29, 28] . They are all produced from a downstream ORF, are hydrophobic overall except for the C-terminus and have an unusually high tyrosine content (7-10%). A low sequence homology between these IBV an MHV polypeptides has already been pointed out [29] . In conclusion, the marked resemblance between the structural polypeptides of coronaviruses does not extend to the abovementioned gene products. Some of them may prove to be key factors in the virus cycle, for instance in transcription-replication switching. One way to achieve their characterization would be to use antisera directed against synthetic peptides derived from the sequence so as to facilitate their identification in infected cell extracts.",
