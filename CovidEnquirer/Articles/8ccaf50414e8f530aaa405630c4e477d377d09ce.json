Zoonotic hepatitis E is associated mainly with genotype 3 (G3) and G4 HEV infection (3, 4) . In addition to deer, swine, and wild boars, other animals, including monkeys, rats, ferrets, chickens, and bats, harbor HEV or HEV-like viruses (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . The genus Hepevirus might include 3 additional species (avian HEV, bat HEV, and rat/ferret HEV) (10) . However, whether HEV from these animals is transmitted to humans is not clear.",

Figure. Phylogenetic relationships among genotypes 1-4 and wild boar, rabbit, rat, avian, bat, and ferret isolates of hepatitis E virus. Nucleic acid sequence alignment was performed by using Clustal X 1.81 (www.clustal.org/clustal2/). Genetic distance was calculated by using Kimura's 2-parameter method. Phylogenetic trees with 1,000 bootstrap replicates were generated by using the neighborjoining method ( ",
