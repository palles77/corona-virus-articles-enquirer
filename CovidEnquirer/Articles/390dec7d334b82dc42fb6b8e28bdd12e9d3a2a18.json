            "text": "There are many metabolic alterations that may account for the pathogenesis of fatty liver. Lipid accumulation in hepatocytes can result from an increase in the synthesis of triglycerides, with normal or decreased rate of secretion of lipoprotein into the blood. There may be one or more defects in the pathway leading to formation of secreted lipoproteins. Triglycerides may be synthesized in a part of the hepatocyte where they are unavailable for secretion (Plaa, 1980) . Although the specific etiology of the lesion is still undetermined, the development of periportal lipidosis in this study demonstrated that the AIN-76A diet is not suitable for use with male Fischer-344 rats. Livers of rats fed this diet developed the lesions as early as 4 weeks and by 8 weeks all rats had moderate to marked lipid accumulation in hepatocytes surrounding the portal triads. The degree of lipidosis progressed for 6 months in rats continuously fed the AIN-76A diet. Periportal lipidosis is a characteristic lesion of the human nutritional disease, kwashiorkor (Davies, 1948; Trowel1 et al., 1954) . Lipid accumulation occurs during the first few months in the progression of this disease with hepatic fibrosis developing at later times. Presumably the major cause of kwashiorkor is lack of adequate protein of high quality, because feeding affected children a mixture of skim milk powder and sucrose is the usual therapy (Trowel1 et al., 1954) . In the present study we also saw regression of the lesions when rats fed Bio-Serve AIN-76A diet were given a control cereal-based diet.",

Chronic ingestion of low doses of mirex, photomirex, or Kepone (1 ppm) or Aroclor 1260 or Aroclor 1254 (20 ppm) over 28 days all caused perivenous and midzonal accumulation of lipid in the livers of rats (Chu et al., 1980) . Casein, the most likely source for polychlorinated hydrocarbon contamination in the diets used in our study, was analyzed and nine chlorinated insecticides were detected at levels of 5 ppb or less.3 Total polychlorinated biphenyl contamination was less than 10 ppb. These levels are well below those required to produce hepatic lipidosis.

After reports of hemorrhagic lesions (Roebuck et al., 1979) this level was increased to 500 pg/kg (Bieri, 1980) . The AIN also suggested that Vitamin K be added in the stabilized form, menadione sodium bisulfite. The levels of Vitamin K in the AIN-76A diet manufactured by Bio-Serve and the Wayne Lab Blox were 1500 and 2800 pg/kg, respectively, as stated by the manufacturers. No hemorrhagic lesions were found in animals maintained on either diet. Other investigators have found that male Fischer and Sprague-Dawley rats had a higher incidence of death because of butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT)-induced hemorrhages compared to Wistar or Donryu strains when 1.2% BHT was added to the diet for 3 weeks (Takahashi et al., 1980) . BHT, an antioxidant, was not present in the corn oil in the AIN-76A diets supplied by Zeigler or Bio-Serve.
