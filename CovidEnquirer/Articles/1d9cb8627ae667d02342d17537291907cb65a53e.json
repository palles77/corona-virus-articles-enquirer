            "text": "Infectious disease interventions like contact precautions and vaccination have proven effective in disease control and elimination. The priority given to interventions can depend strongly on how virulent the pathogen is, and interventions may also depend partly for their success on social processes that respond adaptively to disease dynamics. However, mathematical models of competition between pathogen strains with differing natural history profiles typically assume that human behaviour is fixed. Here, our objective is to model the influence of social behaviour on the competition between pathogen strains with differing virulence. We couple a compartmental Susceptible-Infectious-Recovered model for a resident pathogen strain and a mutant strain with higher virulence, with a differential equation of a population where individuals learn to adopt protective behaviour from others according to the prevalence of infection of the two strains and the perceived severity of the respective strains in the population. We perform invasion analysis, time series analysis and phase plane analysis to show that perceived severities of pathogen strains and the efficacy of infection control against them can greatly impact the invasion of more virulent strain. We demonstrate that adaptive social behaviour enables invasion of the mutant strain under plausible epidemiological scenarios, even when the mutant strain has a lower basic reproductive number than the resident strain. Surprisingly, in some situations, increasing the perceived severity of the resident strain can facilitate invasion of the more virulent mutant strain. Our results demonstrate that for certain applications, it may be necessary to include adaptive social behaviour in models of the emergence of virulent pathogens, so that the models can better assist public health effort s to control infectious diseases.",

            "text": "Modern approaches to developing a theory of the spread of infectious diseases can be traced to 1927 when Kermack and McKendrick developed an integro-differential equation model now widely described as the SIR (Susceptible-Infected-Recovered) model ( Kermack and McKendrick, 1932 ) . The model tracks changes in the number of individuals susceptible to an infection S ( t ) , the number of infected individuals I ( t ) , and (implicitly) the number of recovered individuals R ( t ) . Compartmental models such as the SIR model are useful for mechanistic modelling of infection transmission in populations. They have since been further developed to study the evolution and epidemiology of multiple species of pathogens in a population or different strains of the same species ( Frank, 1996 ) . Some models focus on between-host competition while some others on within-host competition ( Mideo et al., 2008 ) . Bull suggested in the 1990s that coupling inter-host and intra-host dynamics in models may be desirable ( Bull, 1994 ) . Models linking between-host transmission dynamics to within-host pathogen growth and immune response are now becoming commonplace ( Alizon and Fraser, 2013; Feng et al., 2013; Handel and Rohani, 2015; Mideo et al., 2008 ) . One such approach is to link host viral load (which is a necessary condition of virulence) to the between-host transmission rate.",

            "text": "Compartmental models have also been used to study the phenomenon of pathogen virulence-the rate at which a pathogen induces host mortality and/or reduces host fecundity ( Anderson and May, 1982; Cressler et al., 2016; Murall et al., 2015; Thomas and Elkinton, 2004 ) . It was initially believed that hosts and parasites co-evolved to a state of commensalism (whereby parasites benefit from their host without harming them) ( Simon et al., 1960; Swellengrebel et al., 1940 ) but this hypothesis was later challenged ( Alizon et al., 2009 ) . In mathematical models, virulence is often treated as a fixed model parameter expressing the excess mortality rate caused by the pathogen. For instance, virulence has been assumed to depend on the intrinsic reproductive rate of the parasite ( Bremermann and Pickering, 1983 ) . Other research expresses the transmission rate \u03b2 and the recovery rate \u03bc in terms of a parameter \u03bd that represents virulence ( Day, 2001 ) . When the impact of human behaviour is discussed in such models, it is discussed in terms of hypothesized effects of human behaviour on the value of the fixed parameter representing virulence. A Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) virulence model by Massad (1996) shows that reducing the number of sexual partners could possibly drive HIV to be a more benign pathogen. However, the model assumes that the number of sexual partners can simply be moved up or down as a model parameter, whereas in reality the number of sexual partners in a population is the outcome of a dynamic socioepidemiological process that merits its own mechanistic modelling, and itself responds to pathogen virulence. In general, these models do not treat human behaviour as a dynamic variable that can evolve in response to transmission dynamics and influence the evolution of virulence. (A few exceptions exist, including work that allows virulence to be a function of the number of infected hosts, thus capturing a situation where the magnitude of the epidemics affects the ability of health care services to host patients ( Dieckmann, 2002 ) .) However, as human responses to both endemic and emerging infectious diseases show, human behaviour can have a significant influence on how infections get transmitted. For instance, an early and well-documented example shows how the residents of the village of Eyam, England quarantined themselves to prevent the spread of plague to neighbouring villages ( Scott and Duncan, 2001 ) . Individuals moved to less populated areas during the Spanish Influenza pandemic in the early 20th century ( Crosby, 2003 ) . More recently, masks became widely used during the outbreak of the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) at the beginning of the 21st century ( Lau et al., 2005 ) , and it has been shown pathogen virulence in Marek's disease can evolve in response to how vaccines are used ( Read et al., 2015 ) .",

For instance, Bagnoli et al. (2007) found that under certain conditions, a disease can be driven extinct by reducing the fraction of the infected neighbours of an individual. Zanette and Risau-Gusm\u00e1n (2008) showed that if susceptible individuals decide to break their links with infected agents and reconnect at a later time, then the infection is suppressed. Gross et al. (2006) also shows that rewiring of edges in a network (and thus social interaction) can greatly influence the spread of infectious diseases. Of the compartmental models, we focus on those that have used concepts from evolutionary game theory such as imitation dynamics ( Bauch and Earn, 2004 ) to describe the evolution of behaviour and its interplay with the epidemics. An example of imitation dynamics concerns, as described in detail in Bauch (2005) , the effect of vaccination on the spread of infectious diseases. Each individual in the population picks one strategy and adopts it: \"to vaccinate\" or \"not to vaccinate\". The proportion of vaccinators is modelled using an ordinary differential equation and is coupled with a standard SIR model. An important aspect of behavioural models is to couple them with epidemiological processes such as transmission. This coupling creates a feedback loop between behaviour and spread of the disease.",

Our objective in this paper was to explore how behaviour and virulence influence one another, in a coupled behaviour-disease differential equation model. The model allows individuals who perceive an increase in the prevalence of infection to increase their usage of practices that reduce transmission rates (such as social distancing and handwashing) and thereby boost population-level immunity. This approach can help us understand the effects specific social dimensions, such as level of concern for a strain or the rate of social learning, on the coupled dynamics of pathogen strain emergence and human behaviour in a situation where virulence imposes evolutionary trade-offs and is strain-specific. Instead of considering long-term evolutionary processes with repeated rounds of mutation and selection, we focus on the case of invasion of a single mutant strain with a large phenotypical difference compared to the resident strain. In the next section, we describe a model without adaptive social behaviour as well as a model that includes it, and in the following Results section we will compare their dynamics.",

The system switches between a longer-lived regime with relatively small epidemics of the resident strain, and a shorter-lived regime with very large epidemics of the mutant strain. Changes in the proportion adopting contact precautions, x , facilitates the switching. As x rises, it allows a series of periodic outbreaks of the mutant strain which in turn decreases the proportion of people adopting prevention and starts a series of outbreaks of the resident strain. This loop continues with diminishing switching-period as well as amplitude.

This regime shift occurs because a sufficiently high perceived severity of the resident strain creates a large pool of susceptible individuals, and coupled with a higher efficacy of infection control against the resident strain, this means that the invading mutant strain can take advantage of the increased pool of susceptible individuals to invade. This effect occurs only when the efficacy of infection control against the resident strain is relatively high (e.g. 1 = 0 . 9 and 2 = 0 . 6 ).

If we neglect social behaviour, the basic reproductive numbers of the qualitative results when for large 1 = 0 . 9 we get invasion of the mutant strain in the black region and co-existence with the resident strain in the red region. The invasion region is bigger when 2 is lower ( 2 = 0 . 1 in (b) and 2 = 0 . 6 in (c) ). Finally, in (e) and (f) we observe qualitatively different results when we vary \u03c9 2 in the 1 \u2212 2 parameter plane. In (e) , 10 8 = \u03c9 2 > \u03c9 1 , we have invasion of the mutant strain. In (f) , \u03c9 1 = 10 6 > \u03c9 2 , we have co-existence of the strains. The light gray region in the lower-left hand corner of subpanel (b) corresponds to both strains being extinct. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) two strains are sufficient to predict which of the strains will invade a population. However, adding adaptive social behaviour with asymmetric stimulation and effects on either strain to an epidemiological system completely shifts how we view whether a more virulent strain will be selected for. As we have seen, social behaviour can either act in favour or against the invasion of a more virulent strain, and we can describe these effects with reference to specific social parameters ( \u03c9 1, 2 ) quantifying how concerned individuals are about the two strains, and control parameters ( 1, 2 ) quantifying how well infection control measures like hand-washing work. Most interestingly, adaptive social behaviour enables invasion of the mutant strain under plausible epidemiological and social conditions even when it has a lower basic reproductive number.",

            "text": "Future work can generate further insights into how behaviour and virulence interact for specific infectious diseases, by building on existing research on the coupled dynamics of behaviour and infection transmission. For instance, an increase in the average number of sexual partners of an individual has been predicted by mathematical models to cause increased HIV virulence ( Massad, 1996; Park and Bolker, 2017 ) . These models use a fixed parameter to quantify the number of sexual partners, but the number of sexual partners could be made to evolve dynamically based on the number of infected individuals in a particular population, similar to seminal work using compartmental models to model core group dynamics ( Hadeler and Castillo-Ch\u00e1vez, 1995 ) . An increase in the number of sexual partners will decrease the efficacy of infection control against the more virulent strain and effectively increase its transmission and hence leads to higher virulence. Other future research could explore how adaptive social behaviour interacts with evolutionary trade-offs to determine virulence evolution. One of the most common hypotheses is that a trade-off exists for between-host transmission and virulence. To increase its probability of transmission, the parasite must replicate within the host. This replication, on the other hand, must be controlled because otherwise it might lead to the host's death and therefore prevent transmission. However, other trade-offs have been suggested, such as between transmission rate and host recovery rate ( Alizon, 2008 ) . Moreover, complicated host life cycles imply that many other types of trade-offs are also possible ( De Roode et al., 2008 ) , and the presence of multiple trade-offs may complicate the relationship between transmission rate and virulence ( Alizon and Michalakis, 2015 ) . Social behaviour could interact with evolutionary trade-offs to alter the virulence evolution of an emerging pathogen, and this process could be modelled by building on existing virulence evolution models.",
