The formed AgNPs were impregnated into cellulose fibers after confirming their formation by utilizing ultraviolet-visible (UV-vis) spectral studies, Fourier transforms infrared (FTIR) and transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The surface morphology of the developed cellulose-silver nanocomposite fibers (CSNCFs) were examined with scanning electron microscope-energy dispersive spectroscopy (SEM-EDS). The thermal stability and mechanical properties of the CSNCFs were found to be better than cellulose fibers alone. The antibacterial activity of the nanocomposites was studied by inhibition zone method against Escherichia coli, which suggested that the developed CSNCFs can function effectively as anti-microbial agents. Hence, the developed CSNCFs can effectively used for tissue scaffolding.",

Essentially, these public health materials should provide adequate barriers against highly communicable bacteria and viruses. The spread of HIV, hepatitis viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), etc., by contacting with contaminated materials, has created increased pressure for the protection of the personnel with functional clothing. In the surgical zone, a lot of priority has been given to the protection of the surgical team from the patient's infectious blood and other body fluids and vice versa. Therefore, surgical fabrics should possess more antimicrobial properties (Vaideki, Jayakumar, Rajendran, & Thilagavathi, 2008; Mucha, Hoter, & Swerev, 2002) . The cellulose fiber skin scaffolds contain cellulose, a homopolymer of \u2424-d-glucopyranose units linked together by (1\u21924)-glycosideic bonds (Gardner, Oporto, Mills, Said, & Samir, 2008) . Cellulose molecules are linear in nature and are aggregated through van der waals forces, intra-and intermolecular hydrogen bonds. The reactive sites in the cellulose are the three-hydroxyl groups which are also widely responsible for metal nanoparticles bonding characteristics (Gardner et al., 2008) .",

The current approach involves the use of 0.3, 0.5 and 0.7% (w/v) GA and GG solutions as reduction media for the preparation of AgNPs from 0.588 mM AgNO 3 . The conversion of Ag + ions into silver nanoparticles was due to the reduction action of functional groups present in GA and GG (Dorjnamjin, Ariuna, & Shim, 2008) , where the pendent hydroxyl groups of GA and GG were assumed to be actively involved in the reduction process. Further, the high molecular chains present in GA and GG provide stabilization for the formed AgNPs. The impregnation of AgNPs in to the cellulose fibers was done by immersing and rotating the cellulose fibers in the poly-AgNPs solutions of GA and GG at 300 rpm for 24 h at ambient temperature of 27 \u2022 C in the orbital shaking incubator, and subsequently taken out and dried. Silver nanoparticles deposited on the cellulose fibers were considered to be attached due to physical interactions with the surface hydroxyl groups of cellulose (Gardner et al., 2008) . The schematic representation of the formation of silver nanoparticles on the cellulose fibers was illustrated in Fig. 1 .",

The UV-vis spectra of the various GA and GG AgNP solutions taken after reduction time of 80 h was shown in Fig. 1A . From the figure, it was clear that increase in the maximum intensity was observed with corresponding increase of GA and GG concentrations. Furthermore, for the same concentration, GG showed high intense peaks than GA. Absorption peaks at 432. 51, 434.65, 435.71, 434.74, 437 .95 and 443.16 nm were observed for GA 0.3%, GA 0.5%, GA 0.7%, GG 0.3%, GG 0.5% and GG 0.7% respectively. Also for the same concentration, poly-AgNPs solution of GG showed absorption maxima at higher wavelength than poly-AgNPs solution of GA. This red shift indicates either an increase in size or aggregation of AgNP in GG solutions than in GA solutions (Hettiarachchi and Wickramarachchi, 2011) . The same can be confirmed by TEM analysis, where the GG-AgNPs were larger in size than GA-AgNPs were seen. The increase in absorption with time, up to 80 h was shown in Fig. 2 .",

From TEM analysis, it was concluded that the size of the formed AgNPs was in between 2 and 8 nm, which was about 62% size compacted than earlier work (Ravindra, Murali Mohan, Narayana Reddy, & Mohana Raju, 2010), where the size of AgNPs was around 21 nm. Furthermore, the size of AgNPs in poly-AgNPs solution of GG solutions was larger than size of AgNPs in poly-AgNPs solution of GA solution, which was further supported by UV-vis data where the surface plasmon resonance of the formed AgNPs form GG reduction were observed at higher wave length (red shift) than from GA reduction. It was expected that both GA and GG stabilize the AgNPs by well-established chemical bonding between the functional groups (Sreedhar, Keerthi Devi, & Deepthi, 2011; Abdel-Halim et al., 2011) . This can be technically concluded, as the aggregation of AgNPs was not found in TEM images, which may be attributed due to the effective passivation of the surfaces and the suppression of the growth of the nanoparticles through strong interactions via the functional molecular groups of GG ( OH) and GA ( OH, COOH).",

The primary thermograms of CSNCFs of GA and GG with reference to pure cellulose fiber (C) are shown in Fig. 6a and b respectively. The results indicated that, in case of AgNPs-loaded CSNCFs fibers, an initial weight loss at a temperature below 100 \u2022 C was observed and this was due to the loss of moisture present on the AgNPs and cotton fibers. Also, the maximum decomposition of all CSNCFs occurred at a slight higher temperature at around 398.68 \u2022 C when compared to that of pure cellulose fiber. Thermal studies led to the conclusion that with the increase in the percentage (%) of GA and GG, the stability also increased. This might be due to the rise in nanoparticles number on the cellulose fibres' surface, which occurred due to the strong bonding characteristics developed among AgNPs and cellulose fibers with increase in GA and GG concentrations. Overall, thermal analysis indicated that the CSNCFs designed were thermally stable.",

In the current approach, much smaller synthesis of AgNPs by green process was developed. These smaller AgNPs enter into the bacteria cell more effectively, causing damage to the nuclei and resulting to bacteria death at a faster rate. Also, the smaller AgNPs kill bacteria more effectively and Murthy, Murali Mohan, Varaprasad, Sreedhar, and Mohana Raju (2008) . The antimicrobial efficacy of the CSNCFs developed from AgNPs was tested against gram negative bacterium E. coli. The inhibition zone for all the fibers was found to be higher than 1.7 mm, shown in Fig. 7 . According to the Standard Antibacterial test \"SNV 195920-1992\", specimens showing more than 1 mm microbial zone inhibition can be considered as good antibacterial agents (Pollini, Russo, Licciulli, Sannino, & Maffezzoli, 2009 ). Hence, the developed CSNCFs from the current approach can be considered as good antibacterial agents and effective in killing the microbes. It was also concluded that the developed CSNCFs in the present investigation exhibited higher inhibition zone than earlier reported work of Ravindra et al. (2010) . This achievement was because of synthesing much smaller AgNPs in the current approach when compared with the work of Ravindra et al. (2010) . Hence, the improved result. Further, it was noticed that for the same concentration of polymer as reducing media, CSNCFs developed form GG show higher inhibition zone than those of CSNCFs developed from GA, which was evident form Fig. 7.

The CSNCFs exhibited good antibacterial activity against E. coli.
