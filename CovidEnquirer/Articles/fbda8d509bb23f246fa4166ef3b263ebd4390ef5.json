            "text": "Diagnosis of viral infections by observation of virus particles in thin sections of infected tissues has been a continuing but perhaps rather underused technique for the last 30 years. Observation of virus particles in suspension in metal-shadowed preparations had some diagnostic applications, but when the negative staining technique was introduced in 1959 and, as a result, virus particles were more readily recognizable, diagnostic use of the electron microscope became extremely practical. The presence in the world of smallpox infection and the consequent necessity for rapid differentiation between the smallpox virus and other viruses established the electron microscope as a n essential tool in a few selected laboratories. Naturally these instruments were utilized for other virus diagnostic problems and gradually experience accumulated. Confirmation of electron microscopy as a good diagnostic technique for samples direct from patients came in the late 1960s with hepatitis B serum testing. In the 1970s the essentially noncultivable fecal viruses of hepatitis A and various diarrheal conditions were discovered and in these studies electron microscopy played an indispensable role.",

Viral structure is thus the basis for the use of the electron microscope for diagnosis and viruses having the same structure constitute a morphologic group, which may be a family of viruses or a genus. Within a group individual viruses cannot be differentiated on appearance and more sophisticated methods of antigenic analysis must be used, but it is often sufficient for diagnostic purposes merely to place a virus within such a group. Many diagnoses are made by recognition of the characteristic viral structure in the image displayed on the microscope screen and need not await confirmatory micrographs; for this an appreciation of the full range of viral morphology by the operator is essential.",

Negatively stained particles are brick-shaped, 220 to 270 nm long, and 180 to 220 nm wide. When penetrated by stain the particles appear larger than when unpenetrated. The latter display a random arrangement of 9-nm-wide surface filaments. Members of the Parapoxvirus genus causing human infections are orf virus and milker's nodule virus. The negatively stained particles are ovoid, 220 to 300 nm long, and 150 to 180 nm wide. The single surface filament is narrower than on Orthopoxvirus particles and is arranged in a regular spiral which usually gives a criss-cross appearance because both sides of the particle are imaged. Stain-penetrated particles are identical with orthopoxviruses except in the ovoid shape and generally greater length and lesser width. A probable member of the poxvirus family is molluscum contagiosum virus which has brick-shaped particles resembling orthopoxviruses but with more rounded corners. The slightly narrower surface filaments are arranged rather more regularly than on orthopoxviruses. Stainpenetrated particles closely resemble the orthopoxviruses except in the rounded corners. In thin sections of infected cells it has been shown that all poxviruses mature within a cytoplasmic matrix. In mature particles a n outer coat encloses two lateral bodies which lie on each side of a dense core. Particles are released by cell lysis.",

Often particles have surface blebs or tails but these are probably preparation artifacts. Beneath the envelope the core is probably icosahedral and contains the ribonucleoprotein which may be helical. In thin sections the particle outer envelope encloses a nucleoid which resembles a n A type particle and is eccentrically placed in mature type B oncoviruses and is central in type C oncoviruses. Mature type B particles are 90 to 200 nm in diameter and type C particles are 85 to 110 nm diameter (Dalton, 1972; de Harven, 1974) . Although viruses of this family are found in mam-mals, the morphological evidence for human oncoviruses is very slight.

Negatively stained particles are enveloped, about 90 nm in diameter, with 12-to 15-nm-long surface projections. In thin sections of infected cells virus particles are observed in the cytoplasm budding into cytoplasmic vacuoles and through the plasma membrane.

In practice it is useful to have a size marker in the instrument so that a rough estimate of virus particle size can be made using the image on the fluorescent screen. The microscope itself must be calibrated to ensure the accuracy of any given magnification as manufacturing tolerance is generally only within 5%. At high magnifications, such as those used for virus work, calibration based on crossgrating replicas is inaccurate and calibration using measurements of the lattice spacing in negatively stained catalase crystals is considered more reliable (Wrigley, 1968). Even small height changes of the specimen in the microscope affect magnification (Agar e t al., 1974) and this creates problems as it is almost impossible to ensure that specimen grids will stay perfectly flat and will be positioned at exactly the height of the calibration grid. Another cause of possible error is that lens currents vary over a period and this too can affect magnification.",

In thin sections virus particles are usually smaller than in negatively stained preparations as a result of the processing used (Glauert, 1975) .",

The technique was first described in 1959 (Brenner and Horne, 1959) and was soon applied successfully to viral diagnostic specimens. The usual method for viral diagnosis is to mix virus suspension and negative stain in equal volumes, place a drop of mixture onto a Formvar-carbon-coated grid, remove excess fluid by touching the edge of the grid to filter paper, and allow the grid to air-dry. Alternatively virus suspension can be applied to the grid and dried before stain is added. The stain used most commonly is phosphotungstic acid.",

A further refinement is purification by density gradient centrifugation. Virus may be concentrated from samples by adding Lyphogel, which is a polyacrylamide hydrogel capable of absorbing water, salts, and small molecules to leave virus particles in a greatly reduced volume (Ashcavai and Peters, 1971; Whitby and Rodgers, 1980) . Virus can be concentrated from very large volumes by membrane filtration (Torrella and Morita, 1979) or can be adsorbed to a polyelectrolyte and eluted to a smaller volume (Chaudhary and Westwood, 1972) . Virus particles can be released from infected cells of solid tissues, cell cultures, and organ cultures by lysing the concentrated cells in a small volume of distilled water (Almeida et al., 1967c; Almeida and Tyrrell, 1967) and, if necessary, further concentration of virus in such cell lysates can be effected by one of the techniques mentioned above.",

When the drop has dried the fluid, salts, and low-molecular-weight substances have diffused into the agar leaving virus particles and larger debris on the grid ready for negative staining. Salts may also be removed by careful washing of grids after airdrying the viral sample onto them (Cartwright et Bond and Hall, 1972) .

The technique has been used successfully with diagnostic samples (Burtonboy et al., 1978; Lee et al., 1978) but is perhaps unnecessarily complicated.",

It is generally accepted that the threshold concentration of virus necessary for detection in negatively stained preparations is lo5 to lo6 particles per milliliter (Galasso, 1967; Monroe and Brandt, 1970; Ball and Harris, 1972; Chaudhary and Westwood, 1972) .

When optimal proportions of virus and antiserum are used the virus particles are agglutinated by the antibody into immune complexes.

            "text": "The simplest method for negative stain IEM is to mix small volumes (i.e., 0.1 ml) of viral suspension and antiserum, incubate at 37\u00b0C or room temperature for 1 hour, dilute to a reasonable volume, and ultracentrifuge to pellet the immune complexes for negative staining (Almeida and Waterson, 1969a) . When reagents are scarce smaller volumes (0.01 to 0.02 ml) can be mixed and incubated, then microdrops are removed to a n agar surface and grids are floated on the drops. When the fluid has dried the grids are treated with negative stain (Kelen et al., 1971) . Alternatively, microdrops of virus-serum mixture may be applied directly to the grids, but before negative staining repeated washing is necessary to remove salts and low-molecular-weight substances which would otherwise obscure the immune reaction (Milne and Luisoni, 1977) . Unfortunately it is necessary to use salt-containing fluids for immune electron microscopy to ensure optimal combination of virus with antibody (Ball and Brakke, 1968) . For routine virus identification specific antibodies can be incorporated into agar in microtiter plate wells and the plates can be stored with a grid on top of the agar in each well. When required, microdrop samples of the virus to be identified are added on top of the grids in the wells and allowed to dry into the agar. Grids are removed and treated with negative stain (Doane, 1974) . Gel immunodiffusion test precipitin lines can be cut out, homogenized, and negatively stained to show virus-antibody complexes (Beale and Mason, 1968) . A method of specific attraction of virus particles to antiserum-treated grids was developed for plant viruses (Derrick, 1973) and further refined by Shukla and Gough (1979) who used staphylococcal Protein A to enhance antibody coating of the grid. The technique has recently been used successfully in rotavirus diagnosis (Nicolaieff et al., 1980) but it was noted that coronaviruses and small round viruses also present in the samples were not seen on the rotavirus-antiserum-treated grids. Virus particles specifically adsorbed onto antiserum-coated grids may be treated further with antisera to investigate their antigenic nature (Milne and Luisoni, 1977) .",

For example human parvovirus-like particles have been compared antigenically by this technique as have rotaviruses from humans and from veterinary samples (Woode et al., 1976) . The system can be reversed and, using known viral antigens, specific viral antibodies can be detected in human sera. Again the technique is most useful when the antigen is a noncultivable virus such as hepatitis A virus (Dienstag et al., 1976a) or Norwalk agent (Parrino et aZ., 1977) .",

Such enhanced sensitivity depends upon the titer of the antiserum used (Lamontagne et al., 1980) and Zissis et al. (1978) found negative stain IEM did not in fact increase sensitivity of rotavirus detection. When single virus particles are readily recognizable, such as rotaviruses, it is probably more sensitive to have many scattered single particles in an ordinary negative stain rather than a much smaller number of virus aggregates in immune preparations. Perhaps the main advantage of IEM in virus detection is the specific aggregation of virus particles of unremarkable morphology so that their viral nature can be appreciated. This was the method used to identify rubella virus (Best et al., 1967) and the small round virus particles such as hepatitis B antigen (Almeida et al., 1969b) , rhinoviruses (Kapikian et al., 1972a) , and hepatitis A virus (Feinstone et al., 1973) .",

Paraffin sections can be marked to indicate cells with inclusions and the appropriate areas of the section reembedded for electron microscopic examination of the same cells (Blank et al., 1970; Rossi et Pinkerton and Carroll, 1971; Bhatnagar et al., 1977) . Cytologic preparations have been reembedded in a similar fashion and virus particles seen in cells (Takeda, 1969; Coleman et al., 1977b) . Cells positive for viral antigens by immunofluorescence have also been reembedded and the same cells have been found to contain the expected virus particles (Epstein and Achong, 1968 ). Tissue and cell structure is generally adversely affected in reprocessed samples, because the original processing for light microscopy is not suitable for electron microscopy, but viral structures rarely disintegrate so far as to be unrecognizable.

Certain factors limit the technique for diagnostic virology: prolonged fixation and the use of standard concentrations of fixatives reduce antigenicity and also limit the penetration of reagents into fixed cells, thus making it difficult to investigate intracellular antigens (Smit et al., 1974; Brown and Thormar, 1976) . The average diagnostic schedule is not oriented toward light fixation of specimens immediately followed by intricate processing. Various methods are available to process already heavily fixed tissues but the preservation of fine structure is generally poor (Miyamoto et al., 1971; Hadler and Dourmashkin, 1975; Mohanty, 1975; Wendelschafer-Crabb et al., 1976; Bohn, 1980; Sisson and Vernier, 1980) . Reactions can be attempted on already thin-sectioned material but nonspecific staining is a problem (Thomson et al., 1967; Hansen et al., 1979; Takamiya et al., 1979) . Trypsin digestion has restored viral antigenicity to formalin-fixed material for immunofluorescence and might be useful for thin section IEM (Huang et al., 1976; Swoveland and Johnson, 1979; Johnson et al., 1980) . The antibody markers used in thin section IEM are usually ferritin or peroxidase and the methods have been reviewed by Howe et al. (1974) and by Kurstak and Kurstak (1974) . Cytochrome c has also been used to label antibodies (Singer, 1974) and peroxidase-antiperoxidase methods based on those used in light microscopy have recently been developed (Hsu and Ree, 1980) .",

Before the advent of negative staining techniques viruses extracted from such samples were examined, with variable success, after metal shadowing (Nagler and Rake, 1948; Van Rooyen and Scott, 1948; Melnick et al., 1952) and tissue biopsies have been thin sectioned to demonstrate virus particles (cf. Sutton and Burnett, 1969; Kimura et al., 1972) . However with negative staining a rapid diagnosis can be made. Vesicular fluid is a suitable starting material for this technique; equally good are dried smears of lesion scrapings, rehydrated in a minimal quantity of distilled water. Crude extracts of solid tissue in distilled water may also be utilized (Macraeet al., 1969) . Because of the high viral content of the lesions it is usually unnecessary to concentrate virus before negative staining. Samples are best unfixed as this facilitates extraction of virus from the cells and fixation before negative staining may hinder virus recognition, especially of herpesviruses. Because of variation of viral content in different samples it is advisable to prepare specimens from more than one lesion (Cruickshank et al., 1966; Harkness et al., 1977) .",

Although smallpox has been eradicated other diagnostic problems remain for solution by electron microscopy. Human monkeypox infections were diagnosed by electron microscopy and in some cases other laboratory tests were negative (Breman et al., 1980) . Orf virus grows only with difficulty and electron microscopy is the only practical diagnostic method; similarly, laboratory diagnosis of molluscum contagiosum is possible only by electron microscopy. Compared with virus isolation and gel precipitin tests electron microscopy was conspicuously effective in diagnosis of varicella zoster virus infections (Cruickshank et Macrae et al., 1969) . Although poxviruses and herpesviruses are morphologically distinguishable, individual orthopoxviruses (vaccinia, variola, and cowpox) cannot be differentiated morphologically nor can the herpesviruses (herpes simplex and varicella zoster). Negative stain IEM is not useful in this diagnostic situation because of the small sample size and because other laboratory tests can be more simply used to give precise identification (Macrae et al., 1969) .",

In thin sections paracrystalline arrays of papillomavirus particles have been observed (Strauss et al., 1949; Bunting, 1953) and these thin section appearances have been correlated with intranuclear inclusions seen by light microscopy . The virus particles reacted with wart virus antiserum in thin section IEM preparations (Viac et al., 1978) . Negative staining was successfully applied to homogenates of skin warts and negative stain IEM was used to study antigenicity of extracted virus . Some skin warts contain only a small number of virus particles in thin sections (Maciejewski et al., 1973) and genital warts usually have a low viral content. Oriel and Almeida (1970) suggested that the best method to extract virus from biopsies of genital warts was by light grinding to disrupt only the surface layers rather than complete homogenization of the tissue. A recent study of the wart virus lesions of epidermodysplasia verruciformis showed that negative staining was slightly more sensitive than thin sections to detect virus in the early malignant lesions where viral content is very low (Yabe and Sadakane, 1975 al., 19771 , but as yet there has only been one report of a successful negative stain diagnosis (Goodfellow and Calvert, 1979) . Laryngeal wart thin sections have shown scanty papillomavirus-like particles some of which were not entirely convincing in the published micrographs (Dmochowski et al., 1964; Boyle et al., 1971; Spoendlin and Kistler, 1978) , but these findings were confirmed when papillomavirus antigen was found in laryngeal papillomas by light microscopy peroxidase-antiperoxidase techniques (Lack et al., 1980) . Papillomavirus particles have also been observed in thin sections of atypical genital warts resembling early dysplasia in the cervix and vagina (Laverty et Morin and Meisels, 1980) .",

In samples revealing paramyxovirus particles studied by Doane et al. (1967) all yielded parainfluenza virus type 1 in cell culture . Joncas et al. (196913) examined lysates of cells in nasopharyngeal secretions by negative staining and also used Doane's method and found that several samples contained paramyxoviruses. These were differentiated into respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) and other paramyxoviruses according to the width of the nucleocapsid. Isolation studies confirmed all the RSV identifications. However adenoviruses and picornaviruses isolated from these samples were never detected by electron microscopy. In a large survey of routine specimens examined by electron microscopy and virus isolation it was shown that electron microscopy was comparatively insensitive for the detection of myxoviruses and paramyxoviruses (Pavilanis et al., 1971 ) although Valters et al. (1975) found that negative stain IEM increased the sensitivity of electron microscopy for detection of viruses in throat swabs. The difficulty of differentiating the paramyxoviruses seen has made it necessary to continue either routine virus isolation or immunofluorescence, which has proved the most useful rapid and specific diagnostic method providing suitable samples are available (Gardner and McQuillin, 1980; Minnich and Ray, 1980) .",

Shortly after this negative stain IEM was used to aggregate the particles so rendering them more recognizable (Almeida et al., 1969b; Hirschman et al., 1969) . This was immediately useful in diagnosis and sera began to be widely examined by negative stain IEM after concentration. Circulating immune complexes were observed in some sera which were examined without adding antibody (Almeida and Waterson, 1969b) . Sera with such complexes frequently gave false-negative results in the other relatively crude detection tests then available (Krohn et al., 1970; Cossart et al., 1971) . It has been suggested that electron microscopy is more sensitive than the modern radioimmune and hemagglutination assays for detection of immune complexes (Trepo et al., 1974) . Dane described the larger particles bearing his name in 1970 (Dane et al., 1970) and Almeida et al. (1971) showed that the cores of the Dane particles could be extracted and, by negative stain IEM, were antigenically distinct from the other particles. Positive sera always contain the small round particles; long particles are next in frequency and Dane particles are the least common (Dane et al., 1970; Stannard et al., 1973) . The extra sensitivity of modern tests has rendered electron microscopy less useful in routine detection of hepatitis B antigens but it is a relatively easy way to identify sera containing Dane particles and their presence can be correlated with high risk of hepatitis transmission. Gel precipitin techniques are still used in routine testing and confirmation of the specificity of these tests by negative staining of extracted gel lines is useful.",

The samples examined were gel precipitin lines formed between patients' sera and animal sera raised against them, a system susceptible to nonspecific reactions. Some particles illustrated resembled common artifacts found in human sera which will be discussed in Section VI, A. It is uncertain if non-A, non-B hepatitis has one etiologic agent or many. Studies are underway to examine sera by negative staining for possible particles but the results which have been obtained are inconsistent with each other. In one study seemingly specific gel precipitin lines between sera were examined by a n unusual method: the gel containing the line was fixed in osmium and embedded in araldite blocks before negative staining. No significant particles were seen (Tabor et al., 1979) . In another study particles 60 nm in diameter with 40-nmdiameter cores were seen in some sera (Coursaget et al., 1979) . Hantz et al. (1980) reported the presence of particles closely resembling those of HBsAg in size and shape; however these were antigenically distinct from HBsAg, were present in very low concentration, and were not reactive in negative stain IEM with antisera which gave gel precipitin lines with the same sera. The gel lines were not examined . Yoshizawa et al. (1980) reported the presence in very low concentrations of viruslike particles approximately 27 nm in size detectable only by negative stain IEM using large volumes of sera from patients with non-A, non-B hepatitis. Similar particles were observed in chimpanzee sera after experimental infection. Mori et al. (1980) , in a negative staining study of density gradient fractions of non-A, non-B sera, showed hexagonal 32-nm enveloped particles with 22-nm hexagonal cores as well as free 22-to 24-nm particles, but no IEM was done.",

They also noted that cytomegalovirus isolation in suitable cell cultures, although slower than electron microscopy, was much more sensitive. This was confirmed, comparing isolation with pseudoreplica methods, by Lee et al. (19781, who observed however that electron microscopy was most sensitive in tests on children younger than 6 months; presumably in these congenital infections large numbers of cytomegalovirus particles are excreted. In contrast Henry et al. (1978) found that negative staining of ultracentrifugation pellets from 5-ml samples of urine was more sensitive than virus isolation, however, they were using a detection level of only four or five virus particles to a grid indicating prolonged examination in the electron microscope. The same authors examined thin sections of cells excreted in urj ne but saw no herpesvirus particles.

It is more usual to employ some method, usually ultracentrifugation, to concentrate virus . Portnoy et al. (1977) compared three methods: direct examination of uncentrifuged fecal extracts; a pseudoreplica method using clarified fecal extracts; and virus concentration by ultracentrifugation. They found that the last two techniques were more sensitive than direct examination and that the small viruses were more readily detected by ultracentrifugation than by the pseudoreplica method. Concentration of enteroviruses from fecal extracts by adsorption onto a polyelectrolyte followed by elution into a smaller volume for negative staining was successful for detection of lo6 poliovirus particles per milliliter (Chaudhary and Westwood, 1972) . Concentration of virus in fecal extracts by selective removal of water, salts, and low-molecular-weight substances into Lyphogel had a sensitivity equal to or greater than ultracentrifugation and the viral morphology was not affected (Whitby and Rodgers, 1980) . Ammonium sulfate precipitation of viruses from fecal extracts has been found useful and the morphology of coronaviruses was particularly well preserved (Caul et al., 1978) . Narang and Codd (1980a) found that low-speed centrifugation of lightly clarified fecal extracts onto grids placed at the base of specially shaped tubes was sufficient for most fecal diagnostic work although smaller virus particles (20 to 35 nm) did not appear on the grids unless present in large aggregates (Narang and Codd, 1980b) . Comparing Narang and Codd's method with other techniques, Roberts et al. (1980) found that leaving the prepared centrifuge tubes on the bench gave the same results as the low-speed centrifugation and they suggested the aggregates of virus seen were released from infected cells which had settled on the grid to be lysed in the subsequent staining. Narang and Codd's experiments show that the comparatively high centrifugal forces used in most laboratories to clarify fecal extracts might rid the preparation of much of the desired virus particularly if it is aggregated. Juneau (1979) suggested incorporating normal human immunoglobulin into agar used in the agar-filtration techniques thus making virus particles in fecal extracts more easily recognized by coating them with antibody. However, if there is too much antibody on the particles viral structure may be obscured and identification becomes difficult. It has also been shown that human antibodies are capable of indiscriminate coating of viruses, virus-like particles, and bacteriophages Locarnini et al., 1974) .",

Tests other than electron microscopy to detect rotaviruses are available (WHO Scientific Working Group, 1980) but are all limited by a requirement for high quality viral antisera. Rotaviruses have a typespecific antigen on the outer layer of capsomeres and a group-specific antigen on the inner layer. Loss of the outer layer is common and immune detection methods are imprecise a s a result. Rotaviruses may already be coated with antibody when excreted (Watanabe and Holmes, 1977) which also renders detection by immune methods more difficult. This has ensured a continued role for electron microscopy in rotavirus diagnosis. In addition electron microscopy is a nonselective method and in the search for rotaviruses other agents may be rev e a 1 e d.",

Identification of parvoviruses depends upon the smooth-surfaced morphology; the size, which is slightly smaller than the morphologically similar enteroviruses; and the density, which is higher than enterovirus density. Because of overlap in both size and density ranges between these two groups precise identification is often impossible. Fecal parvovirus-like agents are noncultivable whereas enteroviruses can usually be grown in cell cultures. Appleton et al. (1977) described 26-nm parvovirus-like particles with density 1.38 to 1.40 gm/ml in feces from a school outbreak of winter vomiting disease (the Ditchling agent) and other 25-to 26-nm parvovirus-like particles with density 1.40 gm/ml (Appleton and Pereira, 1977) in feces of patients with gastroenteritis after eating cockles (cockle agent). Negative stain IEM showed that these two agents differed antigenically, both were unrelated to Norwalk but Ditchling was related to the W agent, an earlier reported parvovirus-like particle (Paver et al., 1973) . Another school outbreak of gastroenteritis was associated with a 23-to 26-nm parvovirus-like particle but no density estimations or cross-reactions with other parvovirus-like agents were described for the Paramatta agent (Christopher et al., 1978) . Although Norwalk was assumed to be the cause of the Australian oyster-associated gastroenteritis, parvovirus-like particles, 22 to 25 nm in diameter, were also seen in many of the fecal samples and similar particles were seen in one oyster sample . Negative staining examination of feces of hepatitis patients, originally in a search for HBsAg and latterly for hepatitis A virus, has revealed interesting particles . Cross et al. (1971) found 15-to 25-nmdiameter small round particles and 35-to 45-nm-diameter particles resembling Dane particles. By gel diffusion and negative stain IEM there was no antigenic similarity between the smaller particles and the small round particles of serum HBsAg but slight cross-reactivity between the larger particles and the Dane particles of HBsAg was observed. Moodie et al. (1974) observed that gut digestive enzymes would degrade all hepatitis B antigen with the exception of the Dane particle cores and in fact there have been no convincing electron microscopy reports of hepatitis B particles in feces.",

Immunofluorescence and other light microscopy immune methods have greater diagnostic potential because they are simpler, larger samples are used, and precise virus identification is possible. Nevertheless, electron microscopy has been important in revealing viral etiology, often for the first time, and it has frequently been the impetus for development of the more convenient light microscopy techniques. Of recent years examination of tissues for viruses by electron microscopy has concentrated upon three major areas: the brain, the liver, and tumors.

Lesions were later shown by thin section electron microscopy to contain papovavirus particles by Zu Rhein and Chou (1965) . Extracts of formalin-fixed brain were negatively stained and typical papovavirus particles were observed which were 41 nm in diameter and were clearly members of the polyomavirus subgroup (Howatson et al., 1965) . Virus particles were also demonstrated in unfixed PML brain homogenates by negative staining (Schwerdt et al., 1966) . It was not until 1971 that a new polyomavirus, JC virus, was cultivated from PML brain (Padgett et al., 1971) . The following year two isolates of a polyomavirus antigenically similar to simian virus 40 (SV40) were reported from PML brains (Weiner et al., 1972) but all subsequent strains isolated from such material have been identified as J C virus (Padgett et ul., 1976) . In thin sections of brain typical spherical polyomavirus particles are found in the nuclei and cytoplasm of oligodendrocytes and filamentous forms of the virus are also frequently present (Fig. 13) . Brain homogenates may be so rich in virus that concentration by ultracentrifugation before negative staining is unnecessary. Filamentous particles have not been seen in negatively stained brain extracts even when they were plentiful in the thin sections (Field, unpublished observations) . When JC virus had been grown in uitro and specific antisera were prepared, virus particles extracted from infected brains were identified by negative stain IEM and parallel immunofluorescence studies were performed on brain sections (Narayan et al., 1973) . For successful negative stain IEM virus content of the brain sample must be high and virus particles must be free of cell debris. Because J C virus is relatively difficult to cultivate this technique has great potential. Although diagnosis of the polyomavirus infection by recognition of the typical particles in thin sections and negative stains of formalin-fixed brain is straightforward, it has proved impossible to identify the virus antigenically by negative stain IEM after formalin fixation (Narayan et al., 1973; Padgett et al., 1976; Field and Gardner, unpublished observations) .",

The nuclear particles are clearly tubular and have no surface coating but cytoplasmic nucleocapsid is usually coated with a granular substance. There have been only two reports of clearly recognizable paramyxovirus nucleocapsid in negatively stained SSPE brain homogenates (Dayan and Cumings, 1969; Dayan and Almeida, 1975) . We have examined concentrated homogenates from nine SSPE brains, of which four contained typical SSPE viral tubules in thin sections and two contained measles antigen by immunofluorescence, but in none have we seen any paramyxovirus nucleocapsid by negative staining (Richmond and Field, unpublished observations). Antigenic identification of the virus seen in brain is thus dependent Richmond.) upon thin section IEM with all its attendant technical difficulties (Jenis et al., 1973) . SSPE brain cells cultured in uitro have been shown to contain paramyxovirus nucleocapsids in nuclei and cytoplasm (Chen et al., 1969; Katz et al., 1969) and typical negatively stained paramyxovirus helix has been seen in extracts of these cultured cells .",

Herpesvirus particles are found in thin sections (Fig. 15 ) in nuclei and cytoplasm of neurons and glial cells (Harland et al., 1967; Roy and Wolman, 1969 ; Baringer and Swoveland, 1972; Viloria and Garcia, 1976) . The thin section technique is too slow for rapid diagnosis and as virus-infected cells are distributed unevenly sample selection is a major problem. Virus can be seen in negatively stained brain homogenates but this procedure is comparatively insensitive (Flewett, 1973; Ross, 1973; Joncas et al., 1975) . In our experience virus particles are extremely sparse even after ultracentrifugation of brain homogenates (Field, Porter, and Richmond, unpublished observations al. (1969) saw herpesvirus particles in glial cells in thin sections of the brain from a patient with encephalomyelitis and cultured varicella zoster virus. In the absence of virus culture complete identification of an observed herpesvirus is difficult. Thin section IEM is technically difficult although possible (Kumanishi and Hirano, 1978) ; negative stain IEM is unsatisfactory because there is insufficient virus and even by immunofluorescence there are problems with antigenic crossreactions with other herpesviruses (Emmons and Riggs, 1977) .",

Similar particles in other human choroid papillomas were shown to be glycogen (Carter et al., 1972) . Early reports claimed ultrastructural evidence for association of a papovavirus with the SSPE paramyxovirus (Koprowski et Oyanagi et al., 1970) but none of the published micrographs has convincingly demonstrated papovavirus and the particles were never intranuclear and were seen only in cultured brain cells and not in the original tissue. A large number of 45-nm-diameter granules with irregular edges were observed in astrocyte cell processes in a Creutzfeldt-Jakob diseased brain and were identified as papovaviruses although the morphology was not convincing (De Reuck et al., 1976) . Kirk and Hutchinson (1978) believe that these cytoplasmic papovavirus-like structures are probably reticulosomes and related structures normally present in cells.",

Parvovirus-like particles were fist described in hepatocyte nuclei in thin sections by Nowoslawski et al. (1970) and these observations were soon confirmed (Nelson et al., 1970; Scotto et aZ., 1970) (Fig. 16) . For some time it was assumed that these particles were identical to the small round particles of HBsAg in negatively stained serum and immunofluorescence and thin section IEM using human antisera tended to confirm this impression (Gerber et al., 1972; Huang et al., 1972) . Meanwhile cytoplasmic particles resembling the pleomorphic forms of serum HBsAg were seen in liver cells in thin sections (Huang, 1971; Stein et al., 1971) . By immunofluorescence, sera specific for HBsAg revealed antigen in cytoplasm and sera specific for HBcAg traced a nuclear antigen and so it was suggested that the nuclear, parvovirus-like particles must be HBcAg and the pleomorphic cytoplasmic particles HBsAg (Gerber et al., 1974; Gyorkey et al., 1974) . Thin section IEM has confirmed this and has also shown HBcAg in cytoplasmic maturing Dane particles (Huang and Neurath, 1979) . Examination of liver homogenates with negative staining had already shown the three morphologic forms of HBsAg and when 25-to 27-nm round particles were also seen it was suggested that these might be the intranuclear, parvovirus-like particles since they were certainly antigenically different from the particles of HBsAg Huang and Groh, 1973a) . Extracts of heavily infected human liver are a good source of HBcAg for detection of antibodies by negative stain IEM (Cohen and Cossart, 1977; Cohen, 1978) .",

In the course of laboratory tests on such samples electron microscopy can be used to detect the presence of virus in inoculated cell cultures, in the precipitin lines of gel immunodiffusion tests, and following passage of an agent in laboratory animals. Morphology can be very helpful in the preliminary identification of the virus, and, provided suitable controls are examined, electron microscopy can also detect contamination with endogenous viruses from cell cultures. Density gradient studies to characterize a virus are often monitored by electron microscopy, particularly if the virus is noncultivable. Simple negative staining techniques are most useful and negative stain IEM can be used for more specific identification of viruses seen. Thin sections are useful to detect viruses which do not have clear negatively stained morphology, such as rubella virus, and thin sections are also useful in examination of tissues from inoculated laboratory animals.",

But early electron microscopic examination of cultures, before cytopathic effects are well advanced, is often fruitless (Field, unpublished observations) . However, the use of negative stain IEM in-creased the sensitivity of virus detection so that cultures examined only 24 hours after inoculation showed virus particles (Edwards et al., 1975) . Rhinoviruses are particularly difficult to detect in cell cultures by negative staining and Kapikian et al.

On the other hand simian foamy virus, a retrovirus, can be easily detected by its cytopathic effect but by electron microscopy is more difficult, thin sections being more sensitive than negative staining (Anderson and Doane, 1972b) . Polyomaviruses have been detected by electron microscopy in Vero cell lines (Waldeck and Sauer, 1977; Gardner and Field, unpublished observations) and in pig kidney cell lines (Newman and Smith, 1972; Tischer et al., 1974) .

Parallel studies showed the particles with 1.43 gm/ml density contained normal nucleic acid while those at 1.34 gm/ml had little if any nucleic acid.",

The interpretation of results in the absence of infectivity experiments can be difficult as shown by the discrepancy in original estimates of the density of hepatitis A virus. Some estimates gave a peak density around 1.4 gm/ml, consistent with parvoviruses (Feinstone et al., 19741 , while other estimates were 1.34 gm/ml, consistent with enterovirus density (Provost et al., 1975b; Maynard et al., 19751. Eventually, general agreement was reached that the latter estimates were correct (Moritsugu et al., 1976; Schulman et aZ., 1976) .

Most cellular membrane projections tend to be globular rather than spike-like, particularly those on mitochondria1 internal membranes, and with practice it is easy to differentiate such artifacts from virus particles. Particles with 5to 10-nm projections are occasionally seen in sera and have been tentatively identified as coronaviruses, but Ackermann et al.

It is worth noting that negatively stained cell debris is indistinguishable from mycoplasmas (Wolanski and Maramorosch, 19701, thus the negative staining technique should not be used for the detection of mycoplasma contamination of cell cultures and thin sectioning and even scanning electron microscopy are the methods of choice (Boatman et al., 1976) .",

In high-quality micrographs Schurch and Fukuda (1974) demonstrated continuity between the tubules and the cisternal membranes, proving that the tubules arose as invaginations of the membrane and were cellular rather than viral. Eady and Odland (1975) confirmed this in wounded tissue and suggested the phenomenon occurred in regenerating cells. Intranuclear filaments which sometimes appear to be tubular have also been identified as paramyxovirus nucleocapsid, but the interpretation generally favored is that this is a postmortem chromatin change (Blin- Richmond. ) zinger et Hayano et al., 1976) (Fig. 18 ).

The immunofluorescence test on cells after centrifugation with rotavirus-containing fecal extracts was not as sensitive as electron microscopy, perhaps because particles lacking the outer capsomere layer were not taken into the cells Bryden et al., 1977) . Direct immunofluorescence on the fecal extract, however, was as specific as electron microscopy and slightly more sensitive (Yolken et al., 1977) . RIA and ELISA tests have greater sensitivity than electron microscopy (Middleton et al., 1977; Birch et al., 1979; Sarkkinen et al., 1979; Seigneurin et al., 1979) and usually specificity is good, though ELISA false positives have been observed (Yolken and Stopa, 1979) .",

Generally these tests are a t least as sensitive for antibody detection as negative stain IEM and have advantages for mass screening. Because of the limited excretion period of hepatitis A virus the detection of antibody, particularly immunoglobulin M, is more likely to be used to establish the diagnosis. Specificity of some of these tests may be a problem and negative stain IEM can be used to monitor this aspect.",

It is necessary to use fractionated serum; otherwise, the IgM structure would be obscured by any IgG present.
