Selection of hybrid cell colonies was based on the ratio of bovine and murine chromosomes, the presence of cell-surface immunoglobulins and growth characteristics. First-generation fusion partners were compared for fusion efficiency and the number of antigen-specific antibody-producing clones generated. Hybrid cell colonies that initially secreted antibodies were selected from first-generation heteromyelomas to function as second-generation fusion partners. Although fusion efficiencies for both generations did not differ, the second-generation heteromyelomas yielded a higher number of specific antibody-producing clones. Fusion of heteromyelomas with either lymph node cells or splenocytes indicated that fusion with lymph node cells results in a higher number of specific antibody-producing clones, whereas fusion efficiency was found to be higher with splenocytes. The optimal time intervals between the final booster injection and fusion were found to be 4 days for splenocytes and 7 days for lymph node cells. Finally, the characterization of bovine monoclonal antibodies against bovine rotavirus and pregnant mare serum gonadotrophin and their neutralizing capacities in vitro are described.",

In addition, monoclonal antibodies can be used to optimize physiological processes such as growth and reproduction, and are important in the treatment of certain animal diseases (Booman, 1988) . Their murine or rat origin may limit the use of monoclonal antibodies in passive immunization of other species. In human clinical trials with murine monoclonal antibodies, almost all non-immunocompromised patients developed anti-mouse immunoglobulin antibodies which inhibited the therapeutic effect (Cole et al., 1985 ) . In pigs, repeated administration of murine antibodies generated a significant antibody response to mouse immunoglobulins (Arri~ns and Booman, 1989 ). In addition, immunoglobulins have species-specific effector determinants, which allow co-operative cellular effects not possible with heterologous antibodies (Nose and Wigzell, 1983) .",

            "text": "The production of antibodies other than those of murine or rat origin has been greatly hampered, however, by the lack of suitable myeloma fusion partners. Nevertheless, some success has already been achieved in the development of monoclonal antibodies from livestock species. Srikumaran et al. (1984) demonstrated the potential of interspecies hybridomas produced by fusing mouse myeloma cells with bovine lymphocytes. Such interspecies fusions resulted in bovine antibodies against bovine enteric coronavirus (Raybould et al., 1985) as well as in antigen-specific ovine monoclonal antibodies (Beh et al., 1986; Groves et al., 1987b ) . A severe limitation to interspecies hybridomas, however, is their genetic instability, due to the selective elimination of the nonmurine chromosomes. In another approach, followed by Tucker et al. (1984; , Groves et al. ( 1987a; 1988 ) and by us, bovine-murine hybrid myelomas (heteromyelomas) have been constructed in an attempt to obtain a better fusion partner for the production of bovine monoclonal antibodies. It was expected that a heteromyeloma would retain the superior fusion characteristics of the mouse myeloma cells and be better able to support stable bovine antibody production because of the presence of bovine chromosomes.",

Seven years previously, this cow had been experimentally infected with BLV strain J 5 (Ressang et al., 1974) . The supposedly transformed lymphoid cells were selected from spots in the popliteal lymph node with a hyalin appearance. After fusion, growth characteristics such as doubling time, viability after freezing and subsequent thawing, and homogeneity of cell type of the colonies of hybrid cells were determined. In addition, the ratios of numbers of bovine and murine chromosomes and of bovine and mouse cell-surface Ig, and the secretion of bovine Ig, were assessed. Selected hybridoma colonies were cloned twice by limiting dilution and the subclones checked for chromosomal content, cell-surface Ig and growth characteristics. Subclones chosen to be fusion partners were made hypoxanthine, aminopterin, thymidine (HAT)-sensitive by growing them for at least 2 months in medium supplemented with 30 /~g/ml 8-azaguanine (Sigma). Cells were tested at intervals for HAT sensitivity by culturing them in HAT medium. The fusion partners were screened for the presence of BLV by the procedures described below.",

From the observation that two hybrid cell lines retained cell-surface Ig from the parent BLV-cells and secreted bovine IgM, it was reasoned that they would be able to support stable bovine antibody production after fusion with stimulated bovine B lymphocytes. Although the number of cell lines secreting antigen-specific antibodies was low, the expectation has been confirmed. Whether two additional non-secreting hybrid cell lines that had been selected as fusion partners based only on a relatively high number of bovine chromosomes and favorable growth characteristics would also sustain secretion of immunoglobulins could be evaluated, as the fusion efficiency of both of these heteromyelomas was negligible. The results of the karyotype analysis of the four lst-generation heteromyelomas suggest that there is no direct relationship between the number of bovine chromosomes and characteristics important for the selection of the lst-generation fusion partners. This was likewise reported by Murphy et al. (1986) in human monoclonal antibody production. The few bovine chromosomes present in the cells of heteromyeloma 1 II are apparently sufficient to support endogenous Ig production as well as the generation of stable hybridomas that secrete relatively high yields of bovine Ig. Yarmush et al. (1980) reported that they could not detect any rabbit chromosomes in rabbit-mouse interspecies hybridomas secreting rabbit immunoglobulins, and presented evidence for translocation of the relevant rabbit genes to a mouse chromosome. On the other hand, there seems to be a correlation between bovine chromosome content and bovine Ig production, since the higher number of bovine chromosomes present in 3 V compared to 1 II corresponds to the percentages of hybrid Ig-secreting cell lines (50 and 20 percent, respectively). Hybrid cell colonies generated by fusion of the lst-generation fusion partners retained much more bovine chromosomes than the cell colonies produced by fusion of the mouse myeloma cells with the lymph-node cells of the BLV-positive cow.",

            "text": "It was expected that the 2nd-generation non-secreting heteromyelomas would still have the apparatus for support of immunoglobulin secretion and would generate a higher yield of antibody-producing cell lines. Indeed, substantially more antigen-specific antibody-producing lines were obtained with the 2ndgeneration than with the lst-generation fusion partners. This cannot simply be ascribed to differences in bovine chromosome numbers (see 3 V and 33 VI and their fusion products). The number of bovine chromosomes in iII and 13 XIII was indeed different, but in the fusion products of both heteromyelomas this difference had largely disappeared. For that matter, Tucker et al. (1987) , using the same approach, found an increase in the retention of bovine chromosomes in 2nd-generation fusion partners compared with 1st-generation fusion partners, and an increase in number of antigen-specific clones. On average, fusion of the 2nd-generation fusion partners with bovine B lymphocytes resulted in an increase in the absolute number of bovine chromosomes, while the relative number tended to rise to a certain limit. There was considerably less variability in chromosome number. Apparently, the number of bovine chromosomes has an upper limit. In human-mouse heterohybrids a similar threshold seems to be observed. Hybrids usually have at most five times more mouse than human chromosomes (Raison et al., 1982; Teng et al., 1985) . Whether a 3rd-generation bovine-routine heteromyeloma cell line will improve the levels of antibody secretion and ensure that high levels of secretion are sustained is currently being explored.",

However, in general their secretion level was very low, and within 6 weeks they lost their activity. The numbers of this type of colony were about twice as high as in the mouse-mouse system. A similar limitation occurs in human monoclonal antibody production, generally attributed to either overgrowth by non-secreting lymphocyte 'contaminants' or to the loss of structural genes coding for immunoglobulin. As suggested by James and Bell (1987) , other factors include deficits in growth and differentiation factors and their receptors, structural and regulatory gene defects and imperfections in the synthetic and secretory machinery of the cells.",

Apart from our work no comparative studies of this nature have been published in the area of bovine monoclonal antibody production. In contrast to human monoclonal antibody technology, where no differences between spleen and lymph-node fusions were found (Jahn et al., 1988) , in mice fusion of popliteal and inguinal lymph-node lymphocytes also induced a higher fusion efficiency as well as a higher frequency of hybridomas secreting specific antibody than fusion with splenocytes (Mirza et al., 1987) .",

Both antibody-producing cell lines showed good cloning efficiency (about 30% ), cells can grow in a minimal medium even under serum-free conditions, and secretion levels obtained are relatively high in comparison with other reports in bovine (Tucker et al., 1984; Groves et al., 1987a) as well as in human monoclonal antibody production (for references, see Kozbor and Croce, 1985) . In addition, preliminary results from our laboratory indicate that it is possible to obtain bovine monoclonal antibodies via ascites production or high serum titers in irradiated (300 rad), pristane-treated calves by inoculation of at least 1 \u00d7 l0 s hybrid cells (data not shown). Although the anti-rotavirus antibody was directed against an outer capsid glycoprotein which might theoretically carry antigenic sites for virus neutralization, the antibody did not neutralize bovine rotavirus in vitro. The in vitro neutralizing capacity of the anti-PMSG monoclonal antibody was very potent. Further studies on the in vivo neutralizing capacity of this antibody are currently in progress. Since a murine anti-PMSG monoclonal antibody has recently become available commercially (Neutra-PMSG, Intervet), a comparative study of the inhibitory capacity and the efficacy of the bovine and murine antibodies after repeated treatment is now possible.",
