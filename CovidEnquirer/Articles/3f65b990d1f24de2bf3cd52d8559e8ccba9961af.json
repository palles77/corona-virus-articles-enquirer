The effect of dengue control interventions on A. aegypti infection prevalence is also poorly understood. Moreover, the high prevalence of dengue in southern Taiwan and the consecutive large dengue outbreaks in the period 2014-2015 suggest that current control strategies are suboptimal.",

[4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] For vector-borne diseases, the vectorial capacity and the basic reproduction number (R 0 ) are usually used to characterize the critical components involved in vector-human transmission dynamics. [10] [11] [12] [13] The vectorial capacity captures key components of an insect's role in pathogen transmission, 10 whereas R 0 quantitatively characterizes the average number of secondary cases that are generated by a primary infectious case via the vectors in an entirely susceptible population. 11 R 0 is also a key epidemiological determinant that establishes threshold criteria for control practices and provides an index for the intensity of control interventions necessary to contain an outbreak. 11 It is recognized that temperature fluctuations have significant impacts on the time when mosquitoes become infectious and consequently affect vectorial capacity, R 0 , and disease burden. [14] [15] [16] [17] Fraser et al 18 derived a control measure model from von Foerster equation-based criteria for the likely success of public control measures in containing outbreaks of infectious diseases. The R 0 and the proportion of asymptomatic infectious (q) are two major determinants indicating whether the disease is under control. The Fraser's control measure model has been applied to evaluate the control effectiveness for several infectious diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), HIV, smallpox, and influenza, 1, 2, 18 but not yet for dengue.",

            "text": "Recently, the parameter of disability-adjusted life years (DALYs) estimates the amount of time, ability, or activity of an individual lost because of disease-induced disability or death. 19 These composite measures incorporate several estimates, including the incidence, prevalence, duration of a particular condition, as well as the outcome of a specific disease, either disability or premature death. Hence, a DALY represents 1 year lost of healthy life. 19 Nowadays, several studies have used DALYs to estimate the disease burden of dengue in various regions, including Mexico, 20 USA, 21 Southeast Asia, 22 and globally. 23 It is estimated, on average, 115.3 (range 6.3-934.3) DALYs per million population annually were lost to dengue for the period 1998-2014 in Taiwan. 24 In epidemic years, direct costs associated with dengue result mostly from hospitalization (86.09%), followed by emergency (7.77%), outpatient (6.10%), and drug costs (0.03%). 24 For indirect costs, lost productivity due to death (70.76%) was the dominant contributor. Overall, the costs were 12.3 times higher in epidemic years than those in nonepidemic years (Wilcoxon rank sum test, P<0.05). 24 Taken together, the relationship among temperature, vectorial capacity, R 0 , and disease burden in terms of DALYs lost is still poorly understood in Taiwan. A better understanding of the complex relationship is helpful for designing more effective public control programs. Therefore, this study aims 1) to explore the temperature-R 0 -DALYs relationship; 2) to examine the impacts of temperature on the risk of dengue health burden in terms of DALYs lost; and 3) to evaluate the effectiveness of various control interventions to design more effective control strategies for achieving the optimal containment of dengue epidemics. To achieve these goals, we developed an integrated framework with a combination of a dengue-mosquito-human transmission model, probabilistic risk assessment, and multi-efficacy control model.",

The incorporation of a discount rate in the calculation of DALYs reflects a similar practice in economic analysis and gives policymakers incentives to invest society's resources in currently available health interventions for immediate benefit, though they may be less effective than from saving resources for possible future eradication programs. 19 Disabilities are then classified into six categories or grades, with each grade allocated a scalar value weighting between 0 and 1. The lower the value, the less impact the disability has on a person's life. 19 Dengue cases were classified into different age groups at 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5-9, 10-14, 15-19, 20-24, 25-29, 30-34, 35-39, 40-44, 45-49, 50-54 , 55-59, 60-64, 65-69 and >70 years, based on data collected from Taiwan CDC (2015). 26 To capture the relationship among temperature, R 0 , and model-derived temperature-associated DALYs were estimated. Specifically, monthly DALYs during 2001-2014 were estimated using Eq.

Likewise, temperature-R 0 relationships were constructed under the same temperature range of 17\u00b0C-31\u00b0C using TableCurve 2D. A three-dimensional model was then constructed to describe the temperature-R 0 -DALYs relationship. TableCurve 3D packages (Version 4.0, AISN Software Inc., Mapleton, OR, USA) was used to perform the model-fitting techniques. The optimal model was selected based on the least squares criterion from a set of linear and nonlinear models provided by TableCurve 3D packages.",

We assigned D as 0.197 and 0.542 and L as 4.015 and 14.016 for dengue fever and dengue hemorrhagic fever/dengue shock syndrome cases, respectively. The DALYs for each age-specific category and degree of severity were multiplied by the number of cases in each year and then summed to give annual totals. the highest T max , the maximum value of the estimated total DALYs may occur (Figure 2 ). We also showed that the logistic equation was capable of well describing the relationship between temperature and larvae survival percentage (S L ) (r 2 =0.83, P<0.001, Figure 3C ). The fitted equations with parameters (Eqs. (T1)-(T3)) are listed in Table 2 . Results showed that in the interval of 10\u00b0C-35\u00b0C, the extrinsic incubation rate increased with temperature ( Figure 3A ). By contrast, an opposite result was found in the female mosquito death rate, which decreased with elevated temperature between 10\u00b0C and 20\u00b0C and subsequently increased slightly after 20\u00b0C (Figure 3B ). Moreover, Figure 3C reveals that the peak value of larvae survival was found to be 89.4% at 24\u00b0C with an increasing phase in the interval of 0\u00b0C-24\u00b0C with a falling phase after the peak. Figure 4 demonstrates the uncertainty and sensitivity analysis result for contribution of simultaneous variation in each parameter to the variance of temperature-derived R 0 .

Figure 5 presents the best-fitted results of temperature-R 0 -DALYs relationship by using three-dimensional models. The optimally fitted models and associated parameter values were listed in Table 3 . Results highlighted that the R 0 and DALYs increased with temperature but turned to decline at a specific temperature. For instance, the highest estimates of R 0 (2.37) and DALYs (2532.02) were found in the fall at 25\u00b0C and then decreased dramatically ( Figure 5B ). Compared to fall and winter, summer had the lowest DALYs with the estimated range from 0.78 at 17\u00b0C to 248.27 at 29\u00b0C ( Figure 5A ). In winter, a peak DALY of 270.44 was observed at 20\u00b0C, and meanwhile, the R 0 estimate was 2.08 ( Figure 5C ). We also summarized data to obtain the overall temperature-R 0 -DALYs relationship by pooling temperature data, DALYs, and R 0 s from seasons including summer, fall, and winter ( Figure 5D ). We found that R 0 and DALYs peaked at 25\u00b0C with estimates of 2.37 and 1386.56, respectively ( Figure 5D ).",

Figure 6C -F displays ER profiles conceived with DALYsbased dengue health burden given temperature and R 0 variability. Generally, most dengue cases occurred in the fall with a risk probability of 50% (ER=0.5) and had DALYs estimates of 323 (95% CI: 267-379) ( Figure 6D and Table 4 ), whereas the least dengue cases were likely to occur in winter with DALYs estimates of 60 (45-75) ( Figure 6E and Table 4 ). Taking all seasons into consideration, DALYs estimates were more likely (ER=0.8), likely (ER= 0.5), and less likely (ER =0.2) to be 127 (95% CI: 91-163), 148 (115-181), and 419 (358-479), respectively ( Figure 6F and Table 4 ). Among all interventions, repellent spray alone by hosts can achieve the highest control effectiveness of 70.76%, 75.75%, 72.79%, and 76.39% in all seasons, summer, fall, and winter, respectively ( Figure 7E ). Although the combination of the two (e R +e S ) and three (e R +e S +e C ) highest efficacy control measures being considered simultaneously, >77% and >83% control effectiveness for the fall season can be reached, respectively. In addition, in order to achieve optimum containment of dengue outbreak, we further considered a four efficacy control strategy.

The extrinsic incubation rate (n m ) can be an index of mosquito vector competence and is deeply dependent on temperature change. 36, 37 Capturing all aspects of the disease is a daunting task, but newer temperature-dependent parameters that incorporate a more holistic view of the viral ecology can be implemented as new information on transmission models. Besides the three temperature-dependent parameters in the estimation of R 0 considered in this study, the other two mosquito-related parameters (transmission probability and biting rate) depend on the temperature and seasonality as well. Due to the lack of experimental data from previous studies, we applied the probabilistic approach to simulate the parameter distribution of these parameters.",

In general, the dengue transmission pattern in Taiwan is unique compared to other Southeast Asia countries that has been repeated annually: beginning with imported case from Southeast Asia countries in the early summer, spreading out through southern Taiwan in fall, and dying out in winter because of the cold weather with temperatures dropping to below 15\u00b0C. The summer weather in southern Taiwan is hot and wet, which provides perfect conditions for vector A. aegypti to thrive and facilitate the dengue transmission. Since annual dengue cases emerge in early summer, the authorities concentrate mainy on physical and chemical interventions (eg, breeding site clean-up and pesticide spray) during summer, dengue transmission is under controlled. 43 If the control measures are not successful, the outbreak then spreads out gradually and peaks around October. Compared with the conditions in summer, the frequency and strength of dengue control measures are reduced during late fall and temperatures drop to below 15\u00b0C during late winter, which may lead to a little higher dengue burden in early winter compared to that in late summer.",

In this study, four commonly used control measures were combined for modeling the control effectiveness in different seasons. Repellent spray (R) alone by hosts can achieve the higher control effectiveness of 71% whereas the other interventions -pesticide spray (S), water container clean-up (C), and Wolbachia infection (W) can only achieve control effectiveness of 21%, 12%, and 10%, respectively, in all seasons. Therefore, the implication for repellent spray could be expedited in an epidemic setting in the future as the primary preventive response beginning in early summer to contain further dengue outbreaks in the following seasons. Although other interventions, due to lower efficacies compared with that of repellent spray, could serve as complemented and combinative interventions to prevent and contain dengue outbreaks. Repellent spray alone by hosts is the highest control effectiveness. In considering the repellent product as a control measure against mosquito vectors, it is important to understand specific-repellent efficacy on the length of use 45, 46 and mosquito species. 47 Two essential oils (Melaleuca leucadendron and Callistemon citrinus) have been demonstrated to have higher adulticidal activity with 8 hours of exposure than with 5 hours in A. aegypti and Culex quinquefasciatus. 45 Soonwera et al 47 found that Cymbopogon citratus oil exhibited repellent activity with 98.7% protection from bites from female A. aegypti and 99.8% from female C. quinquefasciatus. Therefore, future research should investigate the length of use and specific mosquito species to develop repellent spray formulations in the control of dengue vectors.",
