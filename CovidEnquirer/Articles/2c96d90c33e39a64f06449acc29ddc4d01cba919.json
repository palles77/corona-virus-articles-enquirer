Airflow limitation in COPD is caused by an abnormal chronic inflammatory response to noxious particles or gases and subsequent airway remodeling ( Figure PP10 -1). The primary cause of COPD is tobacco smoke, but the burning of biomass fuels is also considered to be a risk factor. A key feature of COPD is the occurrence of acute exacerbations (AECOPD), defined as a sudden worsening of symptoms beyond the usual day-to-day variation. Exacerbations of COPD are associated with reduced quality of life and accelerated decline in lung function and represent a substantial socioeconomic burden. Therefore, prevention and adequate management of exacerbations should be an integral part of the comprehensive care of COPD patients. ",
