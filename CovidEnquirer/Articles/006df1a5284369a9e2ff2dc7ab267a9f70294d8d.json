The specificity of LAMP was confirmed by bidirectional sequencing of the amplicons. The sensitivity of the LAMP assay was tested using different concentrations of HSV-1 DNA. To evaluate the application of the LAMP assay in clinical diagnosis, we tested vitreous samples from 20 patients with suspected viral retinitis using LAMP and real-time PCR for HSV-1. The LAMP primers amplified only HSV-1 DNA; no LAMP products were detected with the DNAs of HSV-2, CMV, VZV, adenovirus A. flavus and S. aureus.",

The most common aetiological agents of viral retinitis are herpes simplex virus (HSV), varicella zoster virus (VZV) and cytomegalovirus (CMV) [4] . Rapid detection of the specific causative agent helps in the timely institution of specific antiviral therapy because this differs for each group of herpes viruses [5] . Conventional diagnostic methods for viral retinitis include the detection of viral antigen and virus isolation from intraocular specimens [4] .These tests have been shown to have low sen-sitivity in the detection of viruses and are not currently recommended for the diagnosis of viral retinitis [4] . PCR comprises a sensitive and specific technique that has been successfully used to detect viral DNA in ocular samples from patients presenting with viral retinitis [6] . However, PCR requires high-cost precision instruments (a thermal cycler) for amplification, which is a major obstacle to its widespread use.",

            "text": "The diagnosis of viral retinitis is generally based on clinical examination. However, overlapping funduscopic findings may make a clinical diagnosis of CMV, VZV or HSV retinitis difficult, particularly early in the course of the disease [6] . PCR assays are used for the diagnosis of viral agents in intraocular fluid samples in cases of retinitis where the diagnosis cannot be established by clinical examination [6] . PCR requires precision equipment such as a thermal cycler for the amplification of DNA and an electrophoretic apparatus and gel documentation system for the detection of the amplified product. In the present study, we developed and evaluated a LAMP assay, a novel nucleic acid amplification method for the detection of herpes simplex virus 1 in vitreous samples. The LAMP assay is a simple diagnostic tool in which the reaction takes place in a single tube that contains buffer as well as target DNA, Bst DNA polymerase and primers. The tube containing this reaction mixture is incubated at 65\u00b0C in a regular laboratory water bath or heat block that maintains a constant temperature. There is no need for a thermal cycler because the entire amplification cycle can be achieved at a constant temperature. Moreover, there is no need for electrophoresis apparatus and a gel documentation system for the detection of amplified product in the LAMP assay. The final amplified product in this assay is detected by unaided visual examination by adding SYBR green dye to the reaction tube. A positive reaction is indicated if the product turns yellowish-green in colour in the reaction tubes and remains reddish-orange (i.e. the colour of the unbound dye) in the negative reaction tubes. The time required for the amplification and the detection of product is approximately 75 min in the LAMP assay compared to 4 h for PCR. Additionally, unlike a regular PCR, LAMP is less prone to inhibitors that can otherwise hamper the amplification process. LAMP is highly specific because it uses four primers (excluding the loop primers) to detect six distinct regions on the target DNA [7] . In the present study, the assay specifically amplified only HSV-1 and no cross-reactivity was observed with other viruses, bacteria or fungi, and the amplified product on sequencing was similar to the HSV-1 sequences deposited in GenBank. The LAMP assay is highly sensitive; we found that the lower detection limit of the assay was 10 copies of DNA/lL. This indicates that the LAMP assay has almost the same sensitivity as real-time PCR.",

A 100% concordance was observed between the two techniques. We cannot rule out infection with other viral agents such as HSV-2, VZV, CMV or Epstein-Barr viruses in the remaining 16 patients who were negative for HSV-1, and the vitreous samples of the 16 patients were not tested for other viral agents. These initial findings are extremely promising and suggest the need to evaluate this test further in different laboratories using a larger cohort of patients.",

In the present study, we evaluated LAMP for the detection of HSV-1 in patients with retinitis and found a good correlation between real-time PCR and LAMP in the detection of the HSV-1 virus. To conclude, HSV-1 LAMP assay comprises a highly sensitive, specific, rapid, cost-effective and reliable diagnostic tool for the detection of HSV-1 in patients with retinitis.",
