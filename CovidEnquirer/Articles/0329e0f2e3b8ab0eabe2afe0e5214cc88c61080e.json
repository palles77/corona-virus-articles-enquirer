Acyclovir targets herpes simplex virus and varicella-zoster infection, and individual antiviral agents target one viral infection caused by one virus or two viruses of the same family (Elion, 1982; Shiraki, , 2018 . Among antiviral agents, one of the unique features of favipiravir (T-705) is its broad spectrum activity toward RNA viruses, including influenza virus, rhinovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus, but not DNA viruses, as shown in Fig. 1 (Furuta, et al., 2002; Furuta, et al., 2005; Furuta, et al., 2009) . Favipiravir shows better efficacy in treating influenza infections than oseltamivir (Tamiflu) (Takahashi, et al., 2003; Tanaka, et al., 2017) , and its efficacy in treating pathogenic avian influenza A(H5N1) and oseltamivir-resistant viruses has been confirmed in animals (Kiso, et al., 2010; Sidwell, et al., 2007) .",

Favipiravir has been evaluated and developed as a broad spectrum anti-RNA virus drug, including lethal RNA virus infections. The anti-RNA virus activity of favipiravir was analyzed at the cellular level, and efficacy studies were performed in animal models of human lethal RNA virus infections, as shown in Table 1 . Patients with an Ebola virus infection in West Africa in 2014 and patients with other RNA virus infections have been treated with favipiravir (Avigan\u00ae) based on the efficacy in human lethal RNA virus infections, clinical experience, efficacy in patients with seasonal influenza, and its licensure for human use.",

We are convinced that favipiravir will be developed as an influenza drug for humans after the confirmation of its therapeutic activity in two species of animals, mice and ferrets, infected with influenza virus. (Takahashi, et al., 2003) . Favipiravir and oseltamivir show similar efficacy in low-dose infections, but the efficacy of favipiravir as an influenza drug is clearly increased compared with oseltamivir in high-titer virus infections (Fig. 3) . Mice in the control group die on day 3 after a high-dose infection, and an oseltamivir treatment prolongs the survival period for three days but does not prevent death.

Influenza infection induces TNF-\u03b1 production in mouse macrophage-derived P388D1 cells, and the suppressive effects of favipiravir and oseltamivir were compared in this P388D1 cell-based system. Favipiravir significantly suppresses the production of TNF-\u03b1 in influenza virus-infected P388D1 cells compared with the active form of oseltamivir (Tanaka, et al., 2017) . TNF-\u03b1 appears first and disappears first in P338D1 cells among TNF-\u03b1, IL-1, and IL-6 (Kurokawa, et al., 2003) , and we observed a significant reduction in the levels of TNF-\u03b1 in P388D1 cells and influenza-infected mice treated with favipiravir. The antiviral activity of favipiravir has been attributed to a decrease in the pulmonary viral load and TNF-\u03b1 level in the airways of influenza virus-infected mice compared with oseltamivir, and the reduction in the viral RNA load induced by favipiravir might have resulted in a reduction in TNF-\u03b1 production and alleviation of lung pathogenesis (Damjanovic, et al., 2011; Tanaka, et al., 2017) . Based on these findings, the intracellular viral RNA is less recognized by intracellular Toll-like receptors and results in a decrease in drugs. The viral hemagglutinin binds to sialic acid on the cell surface, and the viral particle is incorporated into the endosome. When the endosome is acidified and the pH decreases to a value of 5, which is characteristic of the late endosome, the structure of the hemagglutinin changes through a process mediated by the Matrix-2 (M2) ion channel. Then, the endosomal membrane and the viral envelope fuse, and the viral genome in the viral particle is released into the cytoplasm (uncoating). The viral genome and RdRp complex are transported to the nucleus where the transcription (replication) of viral RNA synthesis begins. The synthesized RNA does not contain the Cap structure required for mRNA, and the Cap structure from the host mRNA is excised and transferred to the viral RNA by the Cap-dependent endonuclease of viral RdRp complex, resulting in the formation of the viral mRNA (Cap-snatching). After the viral mRNA is produced, the viral protein is translated. The viral proteins and RdRp-RNA complex form viral particles that subsequently bud from the cell membrane. Hemagglutinin However, influenza A virus becomes resistant, even in an epidemic occurring in a closed facility, and the current influenza A viruses are not susceptible to amantadine.",

Pandemics occur when novel influenza A viruses emerge that are able to infect people easily and spread from person to person in an efficient and sustained manner. Two decades have elapsed since an avian influenza case was reported in Hong Kong in 1997, and a decade has elapsed since the most recent influenza pandemic that occurred in 2009. Sporadic cases of A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) influenza infections have been accumulating, and we must prepare for these strains or other novel influenza strains that might progress to an influenza pandemic and spread globally, such as A(H1N1)pdm09. Influenza pandemics can cause severe pneumonia, Favipiravir is significantly more effective in treating mice with severe influenza infections characterized by a high viral load than oseltamivir (Takahashi, et al., 2003) , and a J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof favipiravir-resistant virus does not emerge during treatment.

The viral replication period is 6 days or longer for seasonal influenza (Lina, et al., 2018; Memoli, et al., 2014) . When drug administration is stopped during the virus replication period or when resistant strains appear, virus replication and fever relapse. Thus, 10 days of administration may be required for severe influenza or novel influenza. whether the next pandemic will occur are difficult to determine, but researchers are currently concerned about the A(H5N1) and A(H7N9) strains with high lethality. When these strains adapt to humans and become pandemic, their pathogenicity may be milder, similar to previous pandemics. If an influenza pandemic causes severe disease, it may cause substantial damage to human health and social dysfunction. The need for pandemic countermeasures is an important consideration.",

Treatment with favipiravir from 6 to 13 days after lethal infection with Ebola virus cured all mice when the treatment was started at the initiation of liver damage (elevation of AST and ALT) and virus detection in blood. However, the administration of favipiravir from 8 to 14 days prolonged survival, but four of five mice died when the liver damage and viremia advanced. Early treatment with favipiravir was effective, but when the disease is advanced, including liver damage, the efficacy in prolonging survival is limited to one of five mice, indicating that treatment should be started before liver damage progresses to irreversible levels. Thus, favipiravir may be able to cure an Ebola virus infection in the early phase of infection, but the curative activity of favipiravir may be limited in patients with an advanced infection.",

Favipiravir functions as a purine analogue, as expected from the chemical structure, and it is incorporated instead of guanosine and adenosine. Favipiravir terminates elongation after the incorporation of a single favipiravir molecule (Sangawa, et al., 2013) and after the incorporation of two consecutive favipiravir molecules (Jin, et al., 2013) , and the synthesis of this complementary viral RNA strand cannot be completed. In contrast, the anti-RNA virus drug ribavirin is incorporated into the replicating strand, which further elongates and accumulates mismatched nucleotides at the incorporated sites. Base pairing with ribavirin in the complementary strand during replication, transcription, and translation of the RNA strand causes mismatched base pairing, the production of nonfunctional proteins, and a loss of viral infectivity. Accumulated mutations (mismatched nucleotides) cause the replicated viruses to lose their replicative capability, which is known as \"lethal mutagenesis\" (Vignuzzi, Stone, & Andino, 2005) , as shown in Fig. ",

Favipiravir-RTP and ribavirin TP inhibit the RdRp activity in a dose-dependent manner, with 50% inhibitory concentrations (IC 50 s) of 0.14 and 2.4 \u03bcM, respectively (Furuta, et al., 2005) . The RdRp activity was determined by measuring the incorporation of labeled GTP in the elongating RNA strand. Favipiravir-RTP has a higher affinity for RdRp than GTP, and when incorporated, favipiravir-RTP stops the elongation of the RNA strand in which it is incorporated. This termination prevents the incorporation of radioactivity, and thus favipiravir-RTP exhibits high inhibitory activity and a low IC 50 (0.14 \u03bcM). On the other hand, ribavirin induces competitive inhibition with GTP, and incorporation results in mismatch mutations; the strand continues to elongate and incorporate labeled GTP without stopping at the incorporation site. Thus, ribavirin has a high IC 50 value (2.4 \u03bcM) because its RNA strand is further elongated by incorporating radiolabeled GTP. Therefore, its ability to inhibit enzyme activity becomes weaker, and it displays a higher IC 50 value than favipiravir.",

Thus, the increased mutation rates observed in response to favipiravir treatment are unlikely to be due to the incorporation of favipiravir into viral RNA followed by elongation, similar to ribavirin or acyclovir (Fig. 5) . Favipiravir is unlikely to induce mismatches upon its incorporation into the RNA strand and transitions in the influenza virus genome. The increased rate of transition mutations observed after favipiravir treatment is presumed to be due to the biased nucleotide pool induced by the increase in the level of favipiravir-RTP and the properties of viral RdRp.",

Influenza RdRp complex is composed of PB1, PB2, and PA and requires four nucleotides, ATP, GTP, CTP, and UTP, as substrates for RNA synthesis. Influenza RdRp incorporates mismatched nucleotides in a primer-extension-based misincorporation assay in the presence of completely biased nucleotide pools consisting of only three nucleotides instead of all four nucleotides (Aggarwal, et al., 2010) . Even if one of the four nucleotides is missing, its absence is compensated by other nucleotides, and the RNA strand continues to elongate, causing mismatches.

The mutation frequency of influenza RdRp is 7.06 x 10 -4 nucleotides in wild-type H3N2 virus (Cheung, et al., 2014 ) and > 7.26 x 10 -5 nucleotides deduced from 108 sequenced clones of an average of 849 bases from the database (Drake, 1993) , and these values are much larger than those of herpesvirus DNA polymerases with proofreading activity at the levels of 1.38 x 10 -7 per nucleotide (Lee, et al., 2015) to 3 x 10 -9 substitutions per site per year (McGeoch, Dolan, & Ralph, 2000) . These results indicate the low fidelity of the RdRp activity of influenza lacking proofreading activity. Jurkat cells exposed to 500 \u03bcM guanosine for 24 h show an increase in GTP pools to 600% of the control and a decrease in ATP to 40% of the control (Batiuk, Schnizlein-Bick, Plotkin, & Dagher, 2001) . Thus, the intracellular condition of biased nucleotide pools alone is sufficient to increase the ratios of mismatched transition mutations without treatment with mutagens such as ribavirin. Ribavirin reduces GTP levels by inhibiting inosine monophosphate dehydrogenase, but favipiravir has little effect on GTP levels (Furuta, et al., 2005; Vanderlinden, et al., 2016) .",

Then, we decided to deny the possibility of replacement with the resistant virus. Spontaneous mutation rates of the influenza virus RdRp complex and poliovirus 3D RdRp are both approximately 1 x 10 -4 (Cheung, et al., 2014; Drake, 1993; Gubareva & Fry, 2019) . Titers of influenza virus and poliovirus in the culture reach approximately 10 8 viral particles/mL in 5 mL of media in a 25 cm 2 flask, and their genomes contain approximately 13,600 and 7,500 base pairs, respectively, stochastically indicating 10 4 alterations per nucleotide in the genome. Therefore, every type of mutant should be generated during replication, and continuous cultivation for a month might increase the favipiravir-resistant virus population. If favipiravir induces mutations more frequently than natural processes, mutants resistant to favipiravir should be isolated easily, and the culture should be replaced by the favipiravir-resistant mutants. We isolated susceptibility variants of influenza virus and poliovirus in the cultures treated with favipiravir for a month and identified nucleotide substitutions (mutations) in their RdRp genes, but these mutations were not related to resistance or mutations common to favipiravir Daikoku, et al., 2014) . Therefore, theoretical resistant mutants should be generated but are unable to replicate or replicate with reduced fidelity to replace the entire virus population. The favipiravir-resistant mutant replicates as an artificially generated clone but does not become dominant among the entire virus population that grows in the presence of favipiravir (Abdelnabi, et al., 2017; Delang, et al., 2014; Goldhill, et al., 2019) .

Subsequent stockpiling of doses for 2 million people has been performed as a countermeasure against novel influenza in Japan. Favipiravir has been used to treat lethal infections in humans because its efficacy has been confirmed in a wide range of animal models of lethal RNA infections. Severe human RNA infections are sporadic, and the number of cases is limited. In patients with these infections, favipiravir has been used for urgent and life-saving purposes because there is no standard effective treatment, rather than to show efficacy. Clinical trials have been performed to compare historical control patients and patients treated with favipiravir for Ebola virus infection (Bai, et al., 2016; Jacobs, et al., 2015; Sissoko, et al., 2016) and SFTS (Yasukawa, 2016) . Subsequently, favipiravir has been submitted for additional indications based on clinical trials for SFTS in Japan. The establishment of a placebo group that does not receive an effective drug in a le thal animal model is a challenging problem to confirm the efficacy of favipiravir by a randomized placebo-controlled trial. As an example of this situation, PEP of human immunodeficiency J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f Journal Pre-proof virus has been performed to protect against needle sticks or occupational exposures and has become a standard procedure in the guideline due to its prophylactic effect as a result of many years of implementation (Kuhar, et al., 2013) .",

Although there was immunity against influenza A(H1N1)pdm09 among the elderly, it caused health problems for young people and a substantial social impact. As a next candidate for a pandemic influenza, avian influenza, such as A(H5N1) or A(H7N9), causes a severe infection and pneumonia due to the prolonged viral replication caused by the lack of immunity and its tropism to the pulmonary epithelium with a high mortality rate (Lai, et al., 2016; Li, et al., 2014; Shinya, et al., 2006) .

Cinnamyl compounds from medicinal herbs, anti-IFN antibody, anti-IL-1 antibody, and nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) (aspirin) act at each step of this process. Cinnamyl compounds and NSAIDs inhibit the induction of IFN and cyclooxygenase activity, respectively, in the fever cascade to work as antipyretics in influenza. Regarding pneumonia, IL-12 and IFN-\u03b3 production are induced in the bronchoalveolar fluid (BALF) on the second and third day of infection, respectively, and an increase in IL-12 levels reduces the viral load in the BALF and the area of pneumonia throughout the lungs.",

The endosomal membrane and envelope are then fused, and the genomic RNA and RdRp complex in the virus particle are released into the cytoplasm (uncoating) and transported to the nucleus through the cytoplasm. The transcription (replication) of genomic RNA by the RdRp complex occurs in the nucleus, and the genomic RNA is abundantly produced. Genomic RNA lacks the Cap structure required for mRNA function, and the Cap portion of the host mRNA is removed by a Cap-dependent endonuclease. Then, the Cap portion is coupled to genomic RNA, and viral mRNA synthesis is complete (Cap-snatching). Viral proteins are synthesized from the mRNA, and viral proteins and genomic RNA are transported to the cell surface and bud from the membrane to form viral particles. Since the budding virus is bound to the sialic acid on the J o u r n a l P r e -p r o o f infected cell surface via the HA protein of virus particles, it is unable to leave the infected cell and infect new cells. For this reason, the sialic acid-HA bond is cleaved by neuraminidase",
