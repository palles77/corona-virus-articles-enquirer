            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis is a highly contagious viral disease with economic effects on poultry agribusiness. The disease presents multi-systemic clinical signs (respiratory, renal, enteric, and reproductive) and is caused by one coronavirus (infectious bronchitis virus, IBV). Infectious bronchitis virus is classified into different serotypes and genotypes (vaccine strains and field variants). This study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of IBV in commercial poultry flocks from 3 important producing regions in Brazil and to determine the tropism of the main circulating genotypes to 3 different avian physiological systems (respiratory, digestive, urinary/reproductive). Clinical samples with suggestive signs of IBV infection were collected from 432 different poultry commercial flocks (198 from broilers and 234 from breeders). The total number of biological samples consisted of organ pools from the 3 above physiological systems obtained of farms from 3 important producing regions: midwest, northeast, and south. Infectious bronchitis virus was detected by reverse-transcription, real-time PCR of the 5\u2032 untranslated region. The results showed 179 IBV-positive flocks (41.4% of the flocks), with 107 (24.8%) from broilers and 72 (16.8%) from breeders. There were similar frequencies of IBVpositive flocks in farms from different regions of the country, most often in broilers (average 54%) compared with breeders (average 30.8%). reverse-transcription was more frequently detected in the digestive system of breeders (40%), and in the digestive (43.5%) and respiratory (37.7%) systems of broilers. Infectious bronchitis virus genotyping was performed by a reverse-transcription nested PCR and sequencing of the S1 gene from a selection of 79 IBV-positive flocks (45 from broilers and 34 from breeders). The majority of the flocks were infected with Brazilian variant genotype than with Massachusetts vaccine genotype. These results demonstrate the predominance of the Brazilian variant (mainly in the enteric tract) in commercial poultry flocks from 3 important producing regions in Brazil.",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis is a highly contagious viral disease that may be associated with multi-systemic clinical signs (respiratory, renal, enteric, and reproductive) and reduced production in poultry commercial flocks. Besides these, airsacculitis due to co-infection with Mycoplasma or Escherichia coli is responsible for the condemnation of a large number of carcasses in slaughterhouses, generating great economic impact on the poultry industry (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008) . Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a member of the Coronaviridae family and has a single-strand positive sense RNA genome with approximately 27 kb. The IBV has 4 structural proteins: nucleocapsid, membrane, envelope, and spike (S), and this last protein is cleaved in the S1 and S2 subunits after translation (Cavanagh, 2007) . The S gene is highly polymorphic and is the main responsible for the antigenic variation of the virus .",

Lunge * \u2020 1 in epithelial cells of trachea (eventually also in nasal turbinates, lungs, and air sacs) and the main clinical signs are of a cold. Afterward, the virus replicates in other parts of the body, as the oviduct of the female reproductive tract, urinary system (renal tubular epithelial cells), and several organs of the digestive tract (esophagus, proventriculus, duodenum, jejunum, cloacal bursa, cecal tonsils, rectum, and cloaca). According to the physiological system affected by IBV, the chickens can present evident clinical signs as respiratory disease, false layers syndrome, decreased egg production, nephritis, and enteric disorders. All these different pathogenic forms have been reported in different poultry producing regions of the world, including Brazil (Cavanagh, 2007; Villarreal et al., 2007; Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008; Di F\u00e1bio and Buitrago, 2009; Cook et al., 2012) . Confirmation of the IBV infection must be carried out by laboratory testing. Classical methodology includes virus isolation in embryonated SPF eggs and subsequent identification by serum neutralization. The whole process is lengthy and laborious because field isolates usually require more passages to cultivate the virus in embryonated eggs (De Wit, 2000; Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008) . Molecular techniques, such as reverse transcription (RT) followed by PCR, do not require prior isolation and therefore have been widely used for detection and genotyping the virus directly from clinical samples (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008) . The main clinical specimen for this analysis is traditionally the trachea, considered the first replication site in the beginning of the infection. However, the cloaca and cecal tonsils are also recommended because IBV can replicate in the digestive tract in later stages of the infection (De Wit, 2000; Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008) .",

Three decades later, IBV isolates of at least 5 different antigenic types were found in commercial chickens throughout Brazil (Di F\u00e1bio et al., 2000) . More recent molecular epidemiological studies revealed the predominance of local field variants (identified as BR genotypes) in the majority of the important poultry-producing regions in Brazil (Villarreal et al., 2007; Felippe et al., 2010; Villarreal et al., 2010; Chac\u00f3n et al., 2011; Fraga et al., 2013) .

Despite these previous works, information about the frequency and distribution of IBV in geographic regions with an increase in poultry production (such as northeast and midwest) as well as the spread of the different genotypes in the physiological systems of the chickens is still scarce and not available, hindering the control and prevention of disease. This field study aimed to evaluate the occurrence of IBV in commercial poultry flocks from 3 important producing regions in Brazil and to determine the tropism of this virus (and the main circulating genotypes) to 3 different avian physiological systems (respiratory, digestive, urinary/reproductive) in commercial poultry flocks (broilers and breeders).",

The samples identified as Mass displayed a high identity with Massachusetts reference sequences (H120, M41), demonstrating these flocks were probably infected with vaccine-derived strains. Although there was no information about the IBV immunization status of the flocks, the higher frequency of Mass genotype in young broiler flocks is probably related to the use of commercial Mass vaccines (usually held in the hatchery in the first day of life; Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008; Maclachlan and Dubovi, 2011) . The comparative analysis of samples from different physiological systems demonstrated a higher frequency of IBV-positive samples (mostly BR genotype, but even Mass vaccine strains) in the digestive tract than in the other physiological systems. Coronaviruses support the harsh conditions of the gastrointestinal tract (Flint et al., 2000) . Further IBV strains have tropism and grow in cells of the digestive system (esophagus, proventriculus, duodenum, jejunum, cloacal bursa, cecal tonsils, rectum, and cloaca) and may establish persistent infections in birds of different ages without any pathobiological clinical effect (Cavanagh, 2003) . Different strains have been isolated from cecal tonsils, cloacal swabs, and feces, many of them persisting for long periods (Raj and Jones, 1997; Cook et al., 2012) . Other studies have already shown that intensive virus replication occurs in the cecal tonsils, ileum, and rectum, but not in the duodenum or proventriculus (Raj and Jones, 1996; Dolz et al., 2012) . These viruses are probably being excreted in the feces, where they can still remain for a long period and be a potential source of infection (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008; Cook et al., 2012) . This is a likely explanation for the IBV persistence in the commercial flocks (mainly BR genotypes) and consequently the high prevalence of these field variants in studies performed previously in Brazil (Villarreal et al., 2010; Chac\u00f3n et al., 2011; Fraga et al., 2013) . Further studies should be conducted to assess the occurrence and viability of the different genotypes (BR-I, BR-II, and Mass) in feces under field conditions.",

The respiratory tract is the main site for the multiplication of the IBV strains, especially during the first 3 to 5 d after infection (De Wit, 2000) . The viral titer decreases rapidly in the second week after infection; however, IBV can persist for a period up to 77 d in the trachea in some special situations (Naqi et al., 2003) . In the present study, Mass and field variant genotypes were detected in the trachea of birds with different ages. Mass genotypes were detected primarily in younger broilers (between 0 and 4.5 wk of age, corresponding to the probable multiplication period after vaccination), although they were also observed in 3 additional breeder flocks with older ages (24, 28, and 49 wk). However, strains from the BR genotype were detected in a different number of ages in breeder and broiler flocks. Infectious bronchitis viruspositive breeder flocks had a minimum of 13 wk and a maximum of 61 wk of age, whereas positive broiler flocks had a minimum of 1.4 and a maximum of 6.5 wk (data not shown). This wide age variation is probably related to the different episodes of initial infection with BR strains that are circulating in the flocks (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008) . However, the possibility should not be ruled out that strains from the BR genotype have a longer persistence in the trachea, as found with the Arkansas strain (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008; Jackwood et al., 2009 ).",

The only positive sample of these system in broilers belonged to the Mass genotype, whereas all the positive samples found in the oviducts (n = 3) and kidney (n = 9) of breeders belonged to the BR genotype. The Mass genotype was detected in a sample of broilers at 4.1 wk of age (probably related to the dissemination of the Mass vaccine strain in immunized flock), whereas the BR genotype was found in breeder flocks with different ages (13 to 30 wk). Infectious bronchitis virus replication in the kidney or oviduct is not directly correlated with evident renal disease, but some IBV strains are intrinsically nephropathogenic (Cavanagh, 2007) . Specifically, strains from the BR genotype have already been detected in poultry flocks with nephritis and reproductive disorders (Villarreal et al., 2010; Chac\u00f3n et al., 2011) . Furthermore, Dolz et al. (2012) detected IBV in epithelial cells of the ureters by immunohistochemistry, suggesting that retrograde tubular peristalsis, a physiological characteristic of poultry (Laverty et al., 2006) , can contribute to the successful replication of IBV in this system. In Brazil, veterinary laboratories usually recommend collecting and analyzing samples of the respiratory system for IBV detection. In the present study, trachea and tracheal swabs were the only samples collected and evaluated by RT-qPCR in approximately half of the commercial poultry flocks (45.5% breeders and 48.2% broilers; Table 2 ). Although infectious bronchitis is initially a respiratory disease, viral titers are often lower in the trachea than in the enteric organs (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008) . Previous studies also reported a higher probability to detect IBV with the use of digestive tract samples than with respiratory samples (El-Houadfi et al., 1986; Almeida et al., 2012; Boroomand et al., 2012; Dolz et al., 2012) . Therefore, an important recommendation would be to collect samples of at least these 2 systems (respiratory and digestive) to a more conclusive diagnosis of the IBV status in the flocks.",
