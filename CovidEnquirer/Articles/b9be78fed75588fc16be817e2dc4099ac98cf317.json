However, by day 12 pi, T cell infiltration into the CNS of infected CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea and CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice was similar and both strains exhibited comparable viral titers, indicating that CCR5 expression is not essential for host defense. Following MHV infection of CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice, greater than 50% of cells expressing CCR5 antigen were activated macrophage/microglia (determined by F4/80 antigen expression). In addition, infected CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice exhibited reduced (P \u0545 0.02) macrophage (CD45 high F4/80 \u03e9 ) infiltration, which correlated with a significant reduction (P \u0545 0.001) in the severity of demyelination compared to CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice. These data indicate that CCR5 contributes to MHV-induced demyelination by allowing macrophages to traffic into the CNS.",

Mice deficient in CCR5 (CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea ) exhibit altered T cell activity and impaired macrophage function (Sato et al., 1999; Zhou et al., 1998) . Furthermore, macrophage trafficking in response to antigen is impaired in CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice, indicating that CCR5 is required for migration of this population of cells (Huffnagle et al., 1999) .",

MHV infection of the CNS results in an acute encephalomyelitis followed by a chronic demyelinating disease that is similar to the pathology observed in the human demyelinating disease multiple sclerosis (MS) (Houtman and Flemming, 1996; Lane and Buchmeier, 1997) . A robust expression of chemokine genes occurs within the brains and spinal cords of MHV-infected mice which precedes then accompanies leukocyte infiltration (Lane et al., 1998) . Among the chemokines expressed within the CNS of MHV-infected mice are the CCR5 ligands CCL3, CCL4, and CCL5, suggesting an important role for these chemokines in attracting leukocytes into the CNS. In support of this are studies demonstrating that treatment of MHVinfected mice with neutralizing antisera specific for CCL5 resulted in reduced lymphocyte infiltration into the brain and enhanced viral recovery . Moreover, anti-CCL5 treatment resulted in decreased macrophage infiltration, which correlated with a significant decrease in the severity of demyelination. Therefore, these data suggested that CCL5 contributes to demyelination in MHV-infected mice by attracting macrophages into the CNS following binding and signaling of chemokine receptors expressed on the surface of these cells.",

To this end, we have evaluated the severity of neurologic disease following MHV infection of CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice (Andres et al., 2000) . The results presented indicate that MHV infection of the CNS of CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice results in the development of an effective immune response, as characterized by cytokine and chemokine gene expression and clearance of virus from the CNS. However, both macrophage infiltration and demyelination was significantly reduced in MHV-infected CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice compared to CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice, indicating that CCR5 contributes to the pathogenesis of MHV-induced demyelination by attracting macrophages into the CNS.",

Approximately 40% of infected mice die during the acute stage of disease and surviving mice develop a severe demyelinating disease characterized by persistence of viral RNA and antigen within white matter tracts accompanied by mononuclear cell infiltration and white matter destruction. Chemokines are expressed within the CNS of MHV-infected mice and these molecules contribute to both host defense and disease development through attraction of T cells and macrophages (Lane et al., 1998 Liu et al., 2000 Liu et al., , 2001 . In order to characterize the chemokine receptor profile in the brains of MHV-infected mice, total RNA was isolated at day 7 postinfection (pi) and subjected to RPA using a multitemplate probe set containing mouse chemokine receptor riboprobes. The results shown in Fig. 1 clearly demonstrate increased expression of mRNA transcripts for CCR1, CCR2, and CCR5 in CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice following MHV infection of the CNS. As expected, CCR5 transcripts were not expressed in CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice. In addition, there was an approximate twofold reduction in mRNA transcript levels for both CCR1 and CCR2 in CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice. Neither sham-infected CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 nor CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice exhibited increased expression for any of the chemokine receptors tested. Confocal microscopy revealed that greater than 55% of cells positive for CCR5 also expressed F4/80 (an antigen expressed by activated microglia/macrophages) (Fig. 2) . CCR5 antigen was not detected on F4/80-positive cells within the brains of CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice. Although not determined, it is likely that T cells as well as activated astrocytes constitute the remaining population of CCR5-positive cells, as these cells have been shown to express this receptor (Mack et al., 2001; Dorf et al., 2000) .",

There were no marked differences in either clinical disease severity or mortality, with approximately 60% of CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea FIG. 1. (A) Chemokine receptor mRNA expression in the brain following MHV infection. CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 and CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice were infected with MHV or sterile saline (sham), brains isolated at 7 days pi, and total RNA was subjected to RPA. The free probe set is indicated in the lefthand margin. These fragments run higher than protected fragments due to additional cloning sequences. Each lane indicates a single mouse and infected (V5A13.1) or sham mice are indicated at the top of the autoradiograph. Note the decreased levels of mRNA transcripts for CCR1 and CCR2 within infected CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice compared to CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice. CCR5 transcripts are absent in CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice. The RPA shown is representative of three separate experiments. Sample sizes are as follows: CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 , n \u03ed 2; CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea , n \u03ed 2; sham, n \u03ed 2 for both groups of mice.

Densitometric analysis of each lane representing a brain sample from an individual mouse was performed on the scanned autoradiograph (A). Data are presented as the average \u03eeSEM. and CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice surviving until day 12 pi. Analysis of viral titers within the brains revealed a fivefold increase in virus present (P \u0545 0.03) in CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice (5.9 \u03ee 0.1 PFU/g, Log 10 , n \u03ed 12) compared to CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice (5.1 \u03ee 0.1 PFU/g, n \u03ed 9) at day 7 pi (Table 1) .

In addition, no differences were detected in the distribution of viral antigen within the brains of infected CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 or CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice at either day 7 or day 12 pi, indicating that lack of CCR5 did not alter the cellular tropism of the virus (data not shown).

FACS analysis of infiltrating mononuclear cells at day 7 pi revealed decreased infiltration (P \u0545 0.03) of CD4 \u03e9 T cells (12.2 \u03ee 1.9%, n \u03ed 8) and CD8 \u03e9 T cells (14.1 \u03ee 1.6%, n \u03ed 8) into the brains of CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice compared to CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice (CD4 \u03e9 , 19.5 \u03ee 1.3%, n \u03ed 13; CD8 \u03e9 , 22.1 \u03ee 1.6%, n \u03ed 13) ( Table 1) . By day 12 pi, however, there were no significant differences in the infiltration of CD4 \u03e9 or CD8 \u03e9 T cells into the CNS of infected CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea or CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice (Table 1) . Macrophage/microglial staining as assessed by F4/80 antigen expression was decreased by 30 and 60% in CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice at day 7 (CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 , 27.2 \u03ee 2.4%, n \u03ed 13; CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea , 18.8 \u03ee 2.3%, n \u03ed 8, P \u0545 0.03) and day 12 pi (CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 , 29.1 \u03ee 1.5%, n \u03ed 3; CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea , 11.8 \u03ee 0.7%, n \u03ed 3; P \u0545 0.001), respectively (Table 1) . Collectively, these data indicate that T cell infiltration into the CNS is affected during acute disease in CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice, yet these cells are ultimately able to enter the CNS and participate in elimination of infectious virus. Further, these data indicate that macrophage/microglial activation and/or infiltration is compromised in the absence of CCR5.",

We have used the MHV model of viral-induced demyelination to better understand the complex mechanisms by which chemokines and chemokine receptors contribute to neuroinflammation, host defense, and myelin destruction. Through use of specific neutralizing antibodies we have demonstrated important roles for CXCL9 (Mig) and CXCL10 in promoting a protective Th1 response following MHV infection characterized by CD4 \u03e9 and CD8 \u03e9 T cell infiltration and IFN-\u2425 production (Liu et al., , 2001 .

Ligands for these receptors that are expressed within the CNS of MHV-infected mice include CCL2, CCL3, CCL4, CCL5, and CCL7 (MCP-3) (Lane et al., 1998) .

In support of a role for CCR5 in host defense following viral infection are studies by Dawson et al.

Further, CCR5 expression is considered important in host defense following infection with Cryptococcus neoformans and Listeria monocytogenes, as CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice exhibited increased mortality and enhanced microbial recovery from infected tissues (Huffnagle et al., 1999; Zhou et al., 1998) . Moreover, recent studies have revealed important roles for the chemokine receptors CCR1 and CCR2 in mediating host defense through leukocyte recruitment following viral infection Domachowske et al., 2000) .

The delay in response to infection during acute disease is similar to findings by Sato et al. (1999) that demonstrated a decreased host response following Leishmania donovani infection of CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice compared to CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice. However, by day 12 pi no differences in CD4 \u03e9 or CD8 \u03e9 T cell levels were observed within the brains of infected CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 or CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice and both strains of mice exhibited comparable viral titers. These data suggest that CCR5 is important in directing T cell migration into the CNS during acute disease but is not required for T cell infiltration at later times. This may be the result of differential expression of CCR5 by T cells, which is dictated by the stage of disease, e.g., acute versus chronic. Alternatively, it is possible that CCR5 signaling is important in attracting T cells during acute disease but that T cells respond to different chemotactic signals at later stages of disease. More importantly, these data clearly indicate that CCR5 is not essential in host defense following MHV infection of the CNS. In addition, these studies illustrate the importance of the challenging antigen/microbe with regard to the role of CCR5 in contributing to host defense and the outcome of infection.",

The fact that CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice displayed levels of IFN-\u2425 mRNA similar to those of CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice despite close to a 40% reduction in the number of T cells present in the brains suggests that T cell production of IFN-\u2425 is increased in the absence of CCR5. These results are consistent with those of Zhou et al. (1998) that demonstrated enhanced IFN-\u2425 production by T cells obtained from CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice following in vitro stimulation. Despite equivalent levels of IFN-\u2425 mRNA between the two strains of mice at day 7, CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice exhibited increased viral titers compared to CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice. IFN-\u2425 has been determined to exert a potent antiviral effect in MHV-infected mice, leaving these data to be somewhat surprising. However, it is possible that reduced levels of IFN-\u2425 protein are present in infected CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice and/or that expression of other antiviral effector molecules such as perforin are reduced compared to CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice (Lin et al., 1997) . CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice expressed increased levels of mRNA transcripts for CCL5 at day 12 when compared to CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice. These data suggest that CCR5-mediated and/or other chemokine receptor signaling pathways regulate CCL5 expression, as has been suggested to occur in other chemokine/receptor interactions (Sallusto et al., 2000) .",

The mechanism(s) responsible for this decrease in chemokine receptor expression is not clear. These receptors are expressed on activated T cells as well as macrophages . Therefore, reduced transcript levels for these receptors may simply reflect the lowered levels of infiltrating T cells and macrophages within the brains of infected CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice at day 7 pi. Alternatively, it is possible that in the MHV model system, CCR5 signaling may modulate expression of other chemokine receptors, e.g., CCR1 and/or CCR2, through the release of soluble factor(s) which regulate chemokine receptor expression on inflammatory cells as well as resident cells of the CNS.",

The overall reduction in activated macrophage (CD45 high F4/80 \u03e9 ) infiltration into the CNS of CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice correlated with significant reduction in the severity of demyelination compared to CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice at day 12 pi (Table 2) . These data support and extend earlier studies that have shown an important role for macrophages in participating in myelin destruction within MHV-infected mice (Wu and Perlman, 1999; Wu et al., 2000; Lane et al., 2000) . More importantly, the data presented in this paper clearly indicate that CCR5 is important in contributing to demyelination, in part by allowing macrophage migration into the CNS following MHV infection. This is further supported by the demonstration that the majority of F4/ 80-positive cells present within the brains of MHV-infected mice express CCR5 (Fig. 2) . Collectively, these data suggest that ligand binding, e.g., CCL5 and/or CCL3, and signaling to CCR5 results in macrophage migration and infiltration into the CNS. However, the fact that we have previously demonstrated that CCL3 is expressed only at low levels during acute disease and is not detectable during chronic demyelination, whereas robust expression of CCL5 is detected during both phases of disease, suggests that CCL5 may be the primary CCR5 signaling chemokine in this model. This is supported by earlier studies that showed an important role for CCL5 in attracting macrophages into the CNS following MHV infection . Therefore, the data presented in this study suggest that one mechanism by which CCL5 contributes to demyelination is via attracting macrophages into the CNS through CCR5mediated signaling pathways. Additional evidence supporting this is provided by the observation that even in the presence of increased CCL5 expression at day 12 pi, demyelination is reduced in CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice. This suggests that CCL5 does not directly exert a toxic effect on oligodendrocytes (the myelin-producing cell of the CNS) but contributes to disease by attracting CCR5-positive macrophages into the brains and spinal cords.",

No differences were detected between CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice and CCR5 \u03e9/\u03e9 mice with regard to production of Th1 cytokines, kinetics and severity of disease, or leukocyte infiltration into the CNS. This is in contrast to the results presented in this paper, which clearly demonstrate reduced macrophage infiltration and demyelination in MHV-infected CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice. Further, Siebert et al. (2000) show that CCR5 \u03ea/\u03ea mice are indistinguishable from their wild-type counterparts with respect to myelin density and spinal cord macrophage infiltration following transection injury. Collectively, these results illustrate the differences in the roles of chemokines and chemokine receptors with regards to different models of neurodegenerative disease. Although CCL5 is expressed within the brains of mice with EAE, Kennedy et al. (1998) demonstrated that antibody-mediated neutralization of CCL5 did not affect disease outcome. In contrast, anti-CCL5 treatment of MHV-infected mice resulted in diminished macrophage migration to the CNS and reduced demyelination . Therefore, these differences emphasize the importance of using different models of demyelination to study how chemokine/chemokine receptor expression and usage influence disease outcome.",

The T cell chemoattractant CXCL10 is expressed very early (day 1 pi) following MHV infection and serves to attract antiviral T cells into the CNS. Infiltration of activated T cells results in increased expression of IFN-\u2425 that promotes expression of another T cell chemoattractant, CXCL9. Both CXCL9 and CXCL10 are important sentinel molecules and serve to protect the host by attracting antiviral T cells into the CNS. Expression of CCL5 increases as T cells accumulate and this chemokine serves to attract additional T cells and macrophages into the CNS by binding and signaling to CCR5 that is expressed on the surface of these cells. Following the acute stage of disease, activated T cells are retained within the CNS and express CCL5, which results in macrophage accumulation and myelin destruction. Finally, these data support and extend earlier studies from our laboratory and others which indicate that strategies designed to target chemokines and/or their receptors may offer unique opportunities for the treatment of neuroinflammatory diseases such as MS.",

Cytokine, chemokine, and chemokine receptor transcripts were analyzed using the mCK-3, mCK-5, and mCR-5 multitemplate probe sets, respectively (Pharmingen). RPA analysis was performed with 15 g of total RNA using a previously described protocol (Lane et al., 1998 . Probes for L32 and GAPDH are included to verify consistency in RNA loading and assay performance. For quantification of signal intensity, autoradiographs were scanned and individual chemokine, cytokine, or chemokine receptor transcript bands were normalized as the ratio of band intensity to the L32 control (Lane et al., 1998 Liu et al., 2000) . Analysis was performed using NIH Image 1.61 software.",
