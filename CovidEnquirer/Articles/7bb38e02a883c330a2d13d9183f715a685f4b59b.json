After exposure of bacteriophage T2 to a commercially available cranberry (Vaccinium macrocarpon) juice cocktail (CJ), virus infectivity titer was no longer detectible. After a 60-min exposure to orange (OJ) and grapefruit juices (GJ), phage infectivity was reduced to 25-35% of control, respectively. Similar data were observed for the bacteriophage T4. CJ inactivation of phage T4 was rapid, dose-dependent, and occurred at either 4 or 23 1C. Neither pH nor differences in sugar/carbohydrate levels among the juices may be ascribed to the recognized antiviral effects. Further studies were performed to identify the occurrence of antiviral activity by CJ to a mammalian enteric virus. The treatment of the simian rotavirus SA-11 with a 20% CJ suspension was sufficient to inhibit hemagglutination. Under scanning and transmission electron microscopy, CJ was observed to inhibit the adsorption of phage T4 to its bacterial host cells and prevented the replication of rotavirus in its monkey kidney (MA-104) host cells, respectively. The data suggest, for the first time, a non-specific antiviral effect towards unrelated viral species (viz., bacteriophages T2 and T4 and the simian rotavirus SA-11) by a commercially available cranberry fruit juice drink.",

Kontiokari et al. (2003) , for example, reported a reduction in urinary tract infections (UTIs) among women following the addition of cranberry juice (CJ) to their diets. Cinatl et al. (2003) reported that glycyrrhizin, a component of licorice roots, inhibited the in vivo replication of the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS)associated corona virus and alluded to the use of glycyrrhizin as a possible therapeutic agent. These and similar findings have broad implications, as consumption of defined foods containing antiviral/anti-microbial agents may benefit the health and well-being of diverse populations including, but not limited to infants, geriatric, and the immunocompromised.",

Using poliovirus as a model system, selected juices were found to reduce in vivo poliovirus infectivity significantly. More recent studies showed in vivo and/or in vivo antiviral activity against human immunodeficiency virus type-I and Freund's leukemia virus by the plant extracts hypericin and pseudohypericin, from Hypericum perforatum (St. John's wort) (Degar et al., 1992; Meruelo et al., 1988) . New classes of antiviral compounds in the edible gypsy mushroom Rozities caperata, were reported recently. Specifically, in vivo antiviral activity by extract RC-183 from this mushroom was deemed effective in inhibiting the replication of herpes simplex virus types 1 and 2, varicella-zoster virus (chicken pox, zoster), influenza, and respiratory syncytial virus (Piraino and Brandt, 1999) . In the mouse model, intranasal and intraperitoneal administration of flavonoids (watersoluble plant pigments) inhibited the replication of influenza virus types A and B (Nagai et al., 1995) .",

However, temperature-induced inactivation rates may differ between viruses (Babich and Stotzky, 1980; Feng et al., 2003) . In the current study, temperatures of 4 and 23 1C had no effect on control titer yields. These data not only denote the relative stability of the bacteriophage T4 at 23 1C, but further indicate the significant antiviral effect mediated by CJ.

Non-CJ-treated rotavirus, as expected, resulted in a hemagglutination reaction (Plate 3b). PBS-treated GP-RBC's alone imparted no aggregative effect (Plate 3a,b). It is proposed that a modification by CJ of rotavirus glycoprotein spike moieties may have occurred, thereby preventing virus binding to its complementary cellular receptor sites. However, alteration or blockage of receptor sites on RBC's may not be excluded as a mechanism ascribed to the CJ-mediated inhibition of the hemagglutination reaction. At neat, the pH of all juices were essentially within one order of magnitude of each other [OJ (pH 3.7), GJ (pH 3.1), CJ (pH 2.9)]. Upon dilution with equal volumes of rotavirus and bacteriophage suspensions, pH readings for each juice were 4.2, 3.8, 3.6, and 3.9, 3.3, and 2.9, respectively. Importantly, rotavirus is stable at pH 3 for ca. 30 min and virtually unaffected at pH 4.0 (Weiss and Clark, 1985) .

(a) CJ-treated rotavirus did not affect hemagglutinate ( \u00c2 400). (b) Hemagglutination occurred following inoculation of RBCs with untreated rotavirus ( \u00c2 400). Inoculation of the guinea pig RBCs with PBS yielded a pattern identical to that observed with the CJ-treated rotavirus. Table 2 .

The higher concentration of solutes in CJ, which could result in an increase in osmotic pressure, does not appear to be a factor in antiviral activity of the CJ. These data show, for the first time, non-specific antiviral activity by CJ upon unrelated viral species. The antiviral effect by CJ on bacteriophage T2 and, to a lesser extent, upon bacteriophage T4 effected a 490% loss of virus infectivity titer. This effect was rapid, dosedependent, and appeared to be related to the adsorption stage of the viruses' replication cycle. Antiviral activity by CJ was addressed further by testing with the simian rotavirus SA-11, a pathogenic primate enteric virus. CJtreated rotavirus failed to effect a productive infection in its primate host cell cultures. In contrast to 5-day-old controls, characteristic ca. 70 nm ''wheel-like'' rotavirus particles were absent from CJ-treated rotavirus experimental eukaryotic system. CJ-mediated antiviral activity moreover, was observed by the juice's inhibitory effect upon the hemagglutination reaction. Further studies are needed to elucidate the mechanism(s) of our findings and, of equal importance, proceed to animal model systems. ",
