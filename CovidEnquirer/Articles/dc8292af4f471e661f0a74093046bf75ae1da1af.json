Its receptor-binding motif (S-RBM) is located between residues 424 and 494, which folds into 2 anti-parallel \u03b2-sheets, \u03b25 and \u03b26. We have previously demonstrated that fragment 450-650 of the S protein (S450-650) is predominantly recognized by convalescent sera of SARS patients. The N-terminal 60 residues (450-510) of the S450-650 fragment covers the entire \u03b26 strand of S-RBM. In the present study, we demonstrate that patient sera predominantly recognized 2 linear epitopes outside the \u03b26 fragment, while the mouse antisera, induced by immunization of BALB/c mice with recombinant S450-650, mainly recognized the \u03b26 strand-containing region. Unlike patient sera, however, the mouse antisera were unable to inhibit the infectivity of S protein-expressing (SARS-CoV-S) pseudovirus. Fusion protein between green fluorescence protein (GFP) and S450-650 (S450-650-GFP) was able to stain Vero E6 cells and deletion of the \u03b26 fragment rendered the fusion product (S511-650-GFP) unable to do so. Similarly, recombinant S450-650, but not S511-650, was able to block the infection of Vero E6 cells by the SARS-CoV-S pseudovirus. Co-precipitation experiments confirmed that S450-650 was able to specifically bind with ACE2 molecules in lysate of Vero E6 cells. However, the ability of S450-510, either alone or in fusion with GFP, to bind with ACE2 was significantly poorer compared with S450-650. Our data suggest a possibility that, although the \u03b26 strand alone is able to bind with ACE2 with relatively high affinity, residues outside the S-RBM could also assist the receptor binding of SARS-CoV-S protein.",

It is the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and infected over 8000 people around the world in 2002 (Peiris et al., 2003 Rota et al., 2003) . The genome of SARS-CoV encodes several structural proteins including the spike (S) glycoprotein, nucleocapsid protein, membrane protein and envelope protein (Marra et al., 2003) . The S protein of SARS-CoV is consisted of 1255 amino acid residues with approxi-mately 25% homology to that of the other human CoVs (Ho et al., 2004; Spiga et al., 2003) . It mediates viral binding to angiotensin-converting enzyme-2 (ACE2), a cell surface zinc peptidase . The S protein receptor-binding domain (S-RBD) was mapped to a fragment between residues 318 to 510 . Li et al. (2005) have recently solved the crystal structure of S-RBD complexed with ACE2 at 2.9 \u00c5 resolution. Their results demonstrate that S-RBD contains 2 subdomains: a core (residues 318 to 423) and an extended loop (residues 424 to 494). The latter, referred as the S protein receptor binding motif (S-RBM), is formed by 2 anti-parallel \u03b2sheets (\u03b25 and \u03b26) folding into a gently concave surface, which makes all contacts with the ACE2 molecule . Interestingly, 9 out of the 14 amino acid residues of S-RBM in direct contact with ACE2 are in the \u03b26 strand (residues 450 to 494), suggesting a possibility that the \u03b26 fragment alone might be able to bind with ACE2 with considerable affinity.",

DNA encoding truncated fragments covering the sequence of S450-650, namely S-I (450-510), S-II (511-560), S-III (546-595), S-IV (581-630) and S-V (601-650), were amplified by PCR using vector pET28a-S450-650 (encoding for S450-650 of SARS-CoV) as template. The resultant products were inserted into prokaryotic expression vector pET28a. DNA encoding GFP was inserted downstream the S protein genes for preparation of GFP fusion proteins S450-650-GFP, S450-510-GFP and S511-650-GFP (Fig. 1A) . Glycine-and serine-rich linkers of various length have been widely used in protein engineering since these linkers may offer little structure hindrance to folding proteins in their own constructs Nardella et al., 2004) . A linker sequence (GSGGSGS) was therefore introduced between S fragment and GFP. The recombinant products, expressed in E. coli, were purified to more than 90% homogeneity using Ni columns and examined by SDS-PAGE electrophoresis (Figs. 1B and 2).",

S-RBD-Fc is a fusion protein between the S-RBD domain (residues 318-510) and Fc fragment of human IgG1. It has been shown to be able to bind with ACE2 receptor with high affinity (Kuba et al., 2005) . As controls, S-RBD-Fc and human IgG-Fc were used to treat Vero E6 and also ACE2-negative 293T cells. After washes, the cells were subsequently treated with FITC-conjugated secondary Abs for FACS analysis. As illustrated in Figs. 4A and B, S450-650-treated Vero E6 cells were specifically recognized by patient serum PT31 or mouse anti-S450-650 antiserum, indicating specific binding of the recombinant S450-650 to the cell surface. To further locate the site for receptor binding within the 450-650 construct, we next employed fusion proteins S450-510-GFP, S511-650-GFP and S450-650-GFP for direct staining of Vero E6 and 293T cells. As expected, S450-650-GFP was able to label Vero E6, but not 293T cells and deletion of the 450-510 sequence completely abolished its ability of doing so (Figs. 4D and E). It is noteworthy that the intensity of Vero E6 cell staining by S450-650 ( Fig. 4B ) and S450-650-GFP ( Fig. 4D ) was approximately 50% of that by S-RBD-Fc ( Fig. 4C) , while the fluorescence intensity of the S450-510-GFP-stained cells was only 1/20 of that stained by S-RBD.

It has been demonstrated that the S-RBD (residues 318-510) contains immunodominant B cell epitopes and some of which are recognized by neutralizing Abs He et al., 2004; Sui et al., 2004) . Presumably, the neutralizing epitopes are located within the S-RBM region (residues 424-494) which forms direct contacts with ACE2 . However, this has so far not been confirmed by experimental data. In our WB assays, the \u03b26 strand (i.e. SI or S450-510) was not recognized by convalescent patient sera (Fig. 2) . Although the \u03b26 strand was predominantly recognized by antisera from mice after immunization with the S450-650 construct (Fig. 2) , such Abs did not show neutralization ability against SARS-CoV-S pseudovirus infection (Fig. 3) . By immunizing mice with the S-RBD-Fc, which adopts a natural fold of the S-RBD (Kuba et al., 2005) , He et al. (2005) generated a panel of mAbs, two of which were specific for linear epitopes between residues 450 and 510, neither of these mAbs was able to neutralize viral infection. This is in agreement with our data, shown in Fig. 3 , and indicates that the lack of neutralization ability of the mouse Abs specific for linear sequences in the \u03b26 strand is likely a genuine phenomenon rather than the result of improper presentation in the context of the peptides.",

Additionally, our computer modeling results show that the \u03b26 strand contributes significantly more than \u03b25 in terms of contact area (238 vs. 17 \u00c5 2 ) as well as binding energy (139 vs. 30.6 kJ/mol) when interacting with ACE2 (Fig. 7 ).",

            "text": "An unexpected finding of this study is that construct S450-510, either alone or in fusion with GFP, was relatively poor in binding to ACE2 compared with S450-650, as determined in both Vero E6 cell staining (Fig. 4D ) and SARS-CoV-S pseudovirus inhibition (Fig. 5B ) experiments. There are several possible explanations for this phenomenon. In the case where GFP-fusion proteins were employed, it is possible that the Fig. 4 . Staining of Vero E6 cells with S450-650 or its GFP fusion proteins. For indirect staining (A, B), Vero E6 cells were treated with S450-650 (0.5 \u03bcM) in PBS at 4\u00b0C for 1 h, followed by convalescent patient serum (PT31), or mouse anti-S450-650 antiserum (MAS), or serum sample from healthy blood donors (HDS), or normal mouse serum (NMS). FITC-conjugated goat anti-human, or goat-anti-mouse, IgG Abs were employed as secondary Abs. As controls, Vero E6 cells and 293T cells were treated with S-RBD-Fc, or human IgG (0.5 \u03bcM), at 4\u00b0C for 1 h and followed by FITC-conjugated goat anti-human IgG (C, F). For direct staining, Vero E6 (D), or 293T (E), cells were treated with GFP, S450-510-GFP, S510-650-GFP or S450-650-GFP (0.5 \u03bcM) at 4\u00b0C for 30 min. After washes, the cells were subjected to flow cytometric analysis. ACE2-binding site on a \u223c5.5 kDa peptide could be physically blocked by the > 20 kDa GFP. This blocking effect is significantly lessened in S450-650-GFP construct that binds ACE2 efficiently, perhaps because of a buffering effect of residues 511-650 between \u03b26 (i.e. 450-510) and GFP. In addition, by starting the molecule from the middle of the S-RBM fold, the S450-650 might be prone-to-misfold. Thirdly, sequences adjacent to S-RBM may also assist the receptor binding of S-RBM in a yet unknown mechanism. By virtue of the formation of inter or intra-molecular disulfide bonds, the binding of S450-650 polypeptide for ACE2 could be stabilized and enhanced as well. Xiao et al. (2004) found that a dimeric state of S1 portion of the S protein could contribute to an increased overall affinity that may enhance fusion efficiency. This hypothesis may help explaining the fact that Abs against regions adjacent to the S-RBM exhibit neutralizing potential.",

If the recombinant S450-650 polypeptide can specifically bind with cellular receptors for S protein, it should also be able to block the infection of host cells by SARS-CoVor SARS-CoV-S pseudovirus. As shown inFig. 5B, S450-650 inhibited the infection of Vero E6 cells by SARS-CoV-S pseudovirus with an IC 50 of 0.8 \u03bcM, while the S511-650 polypeptide did not show any significant inhibitory effect. Coinciding with the direct staining results illustrated inFig. 4, the S-I fragment (residues 450 to 510) was much less efficient in blocking the SARS-S pseudovirus infection of Vero E6 cells(Fig. 5B).",
