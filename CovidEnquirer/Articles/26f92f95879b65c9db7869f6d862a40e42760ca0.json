Asthma, rhinitis, other respiratory diseases Background: Although known as common causes of upper respiratory infections, rhinoviruses, enteroviruses, and coronaviruses are poorly studied as inducers of wheezing in infants, and their possible role in the development of childhood asthma has not been investigated. Objective: The purposes of this study were to assess the occurrence of RV, enterovirus, and coronavirus infections in wheezing infants and to evaluate the association of these viral findings with early school-age asthma. Methods: In 1999, outcome in relation to asthma was studied in 82 of 100 initially recruited children who had been hospitalized for wheezing in infancy during the period 1992-1993. In 2000, etiologic viral studies regarding the index episode of wheezing were supplemented by rhinovirus, enterovirus, and coronavirus detection by RT-PCR from frozen nasopharyngeal aspirates in 81 of the children for whom adequate samples were available. Of these children, 66 had participated in the follow-up in 1999. Results: Rhinoviruses were identified in 27 (33%) of the 81 children, enteroviruses in 10 (12%), and coronaviruses in none. Rhinoviruses were present as single viral findings in 22 (81%) of the 27 rhinovirus-positive cases, and rhinovirus infections were associated with the presence of atopic dermatitis in infancy. Enteroviruses were commonly encountered in mixed infections and had no association with atopy. As single viral findings, rhinoviruses were associated with the development of asthma (P = .047; odds ratio, 4.14; 95% CI, 1.02-16.77 versus rhinovirus-negative cases [by logistic regression adjusted for age, sex, and atopic dermatitis on entry)]. Conclusion: Our results present rhinoviruses as important inducers of wheezing even in infancy. The association with atopy and subsequent asthma calls for reevaluation of the role of rhinoviruses in the development of asthma. (J Allergy Clin Immunol 2003;111:66-71.)",

Rhinoviruses (RVs) and coronaviruses, in contrast, are well-known causes of upper respiratory infections at all ages. There is increasing evidence that RVs also cause lower respiratory infections in young children, 1,2 and they might precipitate wheezing symptoms. [3] [4] [5] In older children, RVs appear to be the most important viruses in producing exacerbations of asthma. 6 Likewise, there is recent evidence that enteroviruses might be more common than expected in respiratory infections. 7 Viral isolation, antibody assays, and antigen detection tests are available for common respiratory viruses such as RSV. 8 For RVs, in contrast, isolation has thus far been the only available diagnostic method. There are more than100 currently known serotypes, a fact that has hampered the development of antigen and antibody assays. 9 The recent development of PCR for RVs and enteroviruses 10 and for coronaviruses 11 has allowed reevaluation of the role of these viruses in respiratory infections of young children.",

The medical records of our university hospital were available, and the cards of regional hospitals and public health care centers were checked in case the child had been treated in one of them. The presence of asthma was defined according to the following criteria: the child (1) had ongoing continuous maintenance medication for asthma at the study visit or (2) had had asthma-suggestive symptoms (repeated parent-reported episodes of wheezing [\u22652 episodes] and/or prolonged cough [\u22654 weeks] apart from infection during the preceding 12 months), and the exercise challenge test was positive. 15, 16 Eightytwo children attended the follow-up visit in 1999, as seen in Fig 1.

The primers were from the conserved region of the RV and enterovirus genomes (a biotinylated positive-sense primer with map-position 454-473; a negative-sense primer with map-position 548-568). The PCR products were detected by agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. The results were confirmed in a liquid-phase hybridization assay through use of the oligonucleotide probes, a maximum difference between RVs (a samarium-labeled probe with map-position 528-544) and enteroviruses (an europium-labeled probe with map position 534-549) being used to differentiate the RV and enterovirus amplicons. The probes could be detected simultaneously by timeresolved fluorometry. 17, 18 The sensitivity and specificity of the RT-PCR and hybridization methods have been validated against prototype (American Type Culture Collection) RVs and enteroviruses. In a study by L\u00f6nnrot et al, 10 the 30 most common enterovirus serotypes (obtained from American Type Culture Collection) among 64 known human serotypes were tested; each gave a positive signal by RT-PCR. Nine known RV serotypes (obtained from American Type Culture Collection), among 101 known serotypes, and 20 clinical isolates of unknown serotypes were tested, and the RT-PCR assay amplified all tested RVs. All but 1 amplicon gave a positive signal in the subsequent hybridization assay.",

However, when the later occurrence of asthma among RSV-positive children (15%) is compared with the prevalence of asthma (4%) among nonselected school-aged children of our area, 16 the risk for asthma is increased among RSV-positive children as well. However, the RSV-associated risk for later asthma was not as high as that in a controlled study by Sigurs et al, 20 in which the risk was increased up to 12-fold. Enteroviruses were as common as parainfluenza viruses in the wheezing infants. Similar proportions-5% to 10%-have been suggested in earlier studies of respiratory infections in wheezing children. [3] [4] [5] No association was found, however, between enteroviruses and atopy or later asthma. There is 1 previous study stressing the role of coronaviruses in lower respiratory tract infections in children. 21 In accord with findings by Rakes et al, 5 we were not able to identify any coronavirus positive cases. RVs are considered the most common causative agents in upper respiratory infections at all ages. 22 There is evidence that RVs might also cause lower respiratory infections in young children. 1 The figure in the present study (33%) is close to that published by Juv\u00e9n et al 2 for pneumonia in children. In asymptomatic children with no preceding or concurrent respiratory symptoms, RVs have been detected in 12% to 13% of the NPAs by RT-PCR. 23, 24 Those detection rates are clearly lower than the RV detection rate in wheezing children in the present study.",

            "text": "It is not fully established how RVs trigger wheezing in susceptible people, but several mechanisms have been proposed. 25 Respiratory epithelial cells are the host cells for RV replication, and the ability of RVs to infect respiratory airway epithelium seems to depend on the density of viral receptors on the cell membrane. 25 Most (90%) of the RV serotypes use intercellular adhesion molecule 1 receptor, 26 which is highly expressed in bronchial epithe- Asthma, rhinitis, other respiratory diseases lial cells, especially during asthmatic airway inflammation. 27 Consequently, high expression of intercellular adhesion molecule 1 in bronchial epithelial cells would render asthmatic persons more susceptible to lower airway RV infections. 25 In addition, in vitro and in vivo studies indicate that RV infection promotes secretion of several cytokines, such as IL-6, IL-8, IL-11, and GM-CSF from epithelial cells. [28] [29] [30] IL-11 might have direct effects on bronchial hyperresponsiveness, 29 and the other cytokines have profound effects on inflammatory cells that can potentiate asthma. 25 The present study has 2 main strengths. First, it was prospective, the follow-up time being long (6 years on average) and the attendance (despite the length of the follow-up time) good (>80%). At the follow-up visits at early school age the children were 7 years old, on average, and at that age, the continuing symptoms can be considered to be asthma rather than transient wheezing. 31 Second, the viral studies were extensive; 7 conventional respiratory viruses had been studied on each child's entry into the study in infancy, 14 and the findings were later supplemented by RV, enterovirus, and coronavirus studies. RT-PCR, used in the present study, has been shown to be more sensitive than conventional virus isolation for RVs and enteroviruses. 9,10 Liquid-phase hybridization assay, done after RT-PCR, further increases the sensitivity and specificity. 10 In comparison with virus isolation from clinical respiratory samples, the sensitivity of PCR has been excellent (98%). 9 Inasmuch as RVs were rarely involved in mixed viral infections, it was possible to study their specific effect on outcomes in the children.",

Viral PCR was studied approximately 6 years after the acute episode, and therefore good-quality frozen NPA specimens obtained on entry into the study were available for only 80% of the children. Thus the risk analyses for the later outcome at early school age had to be restricted to those 66 cases with both NPA specimens and adequate follow-up data available. In addition, we did not have a control group with no history of early childhood wheezing. Nevertheless, there was a recent Finnish study on RV, enterovirus, and coronavirus findings by RT-PCR in asymptomatic children 24 that showed the viral detection rate by RT-PCR to be low (5%) when no preceding, concurrent, or following respiratory symptoms were reported. In the present study, the viral detection rate by RT-PCR in wheezing children was greater than 8-fold (44% in all). In case of RVs, the detection rate in wheezing children was approximately 3-fold. Consequently, we consider RVs to be important infective agents that are able to induce wheezing in susceptible children. In addition, the prevalence of school-age asthma has been carefully studied in our area in recent years, the criteria for asthma being with minor modifications similar to the criteria used in the present study; the prevalence in those studies has been stable (4% to 4.5%). 16, 32 Thus, RVinduced wheezing in infancy was associated with multiplied occurrence of asthma (up to 70%) in later childhood.",

The association with atopy suggests that there is active asthmalike bronchial inflammation in children wheezing during RV infection. Thus, our results call for reevaluation of the role of RV in the development of asthma. ",
