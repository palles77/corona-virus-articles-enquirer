Prevalence of mental illness rose from 9.1% in 2006 to 10.2% in 2011, and a prevalence of a lifetime of mental illness increased from 12.6% to 14.4% [1, 2] In spite of the high prevalence of mental illness, it was found that the proportion of patients receiving counseling from a psychiatrist or another mental health professional was 15.3% in 2011, and thereby approximately 85% of the patients had no experience of using mental health services [3] . Compared to 39.2% in the US (2010), 34.9% in Australia (2009) and 38.9% in New Zealand (2006) , mental health services were significantly underutilized [4] . Thus, it is important to prepare national strategies for mental health problems in all age groups in Korea.",

In particular, it was shown that mental health R&D projects have great effectiveness in reducing socio-economic costs relative to the investment [8, 16] . This is because disease prevention through early intervention and mental health promotion, may reduce national health expenditure, and indirectly improve human productivity, and reduce public sector expenses (for instance judicial administrative expenses) [8, 16] . Mental health R&D investment in Korea, may be disparate at each research stage, and application and diffusion of research outcomes to local communities are insufficient compared to developed countries. Therefore, support and enhancement of translational research are required to improve mental health research [8, [16] [17] [18] . This study was conducted as a preliminary analysis to examine R&D projects in mental health in Korea, and to evaluate crucial projects according to the relative priority of national policy coordination meetings assessing the mental health problem in 2016 [5] . This may be considered as the current national mental health policy of Korea. The aim of this study was to assess the validity in establishing medium-and long-term plans for national mental health R&D strategies.",

With respect to the proportion of investment, translational research, service and intervention research accounts for 35% or more in National Institute of Mental Health, and NIDA invests approximately 42.1% in translational clinical research and epidemiological research. The National Institute on Alcohol Abuse and Alcoholism actively performs and supports research for the prevention of alcohol abuse and addiction and its development, and carries out an exchange program with other nations and state governments [10]. In the UK, the R&D budget to support mental health was increased by 1.5% (about 58 million euros) from 2004 to 2014 [14], with approximately 45% of the proportion of national R&D healthcare investment for basic research (fundamental research, research for investigating the causes) from 2004 to 2014, 10%-17% for T1 (screening and diagnostic research, treatment development research), and about 45% for T2 (treatment evaluation research, research for prevention and health promotion, disease control research, and research for healthcare service), thereby indicating a high percentage of investment for translational and service research [14].

Priorities of 32 policy projectsFigure 1 illustrates the results of drawing priorities of 32 policy projects by providing the weighted values derived from pairwise comparison among policy objectives. After comparing the average values of the 3 evaluation criteria according to each policy project, 3 projects among the upper 5 projects turned out to be suicide-related policy projects. The policy of 'Establishment of a response to suicidal risk and post-management systems' was evaluated as high at 6.45 points, the policy of 'Establishment of evidence-based research systems for suicide prevention' was evaluated as 6.42 points, and the policy of 'Establishment of a social support systems for suicide prevention' was evaluated as 5.72 points. Moreover, the policy of 'Improvement of health insurance and medical benefit cost system' (5.50) from the institutional aspect relevant to the rate of mental health care service use was evaluated as the 4th priority, and the 5th priority turned out to be the policy of 'Reinforcement of crisis psychological support such as that for disaster victims' (5.47). Discussion In this study the grounds for suggesting strategies, and policy projects that should be prioritized in mental health service R&D, were based on the possibility of successful technology development, necessity of a national response, and magnitude of the ripple effect. Analysis of the online survey contents using AHP, supported by the application of weighted values to the questionnaire results, proved reliable. The relative priority evaluation of 32 policy projects of a comprehensive plan on mental health promotion, showed that suicidal problems ranked high. R&D project support in the field of mental healthcare service, related to a number of policies, such as establishment of a social support system, enforcement of lifetime suicide prevention plans and establishment of a response to suicidal risk and postmanagement system, reinforcement of education relevant to suicide prevention, and establishment of an evidence-based suicide prevention research system are required.",

            "text": "The expansion of mental health R&D projects is necessary to reduce the prevalence of domestic mental illness and social problems[21][22][23]. According to the results of this study, thededuced R&D projects in the field of mental health are based on 4 national policy objectives of a comprehensive plan on mental health promotion: Firstly, the policy objective of 'Promotion of national mental health' should consider promotion of mental health in local communities, management of mental health through lifestyle choices for prevention/diagnosis, development of treatments, and mental health management in high risk groups. The aim is for emotional anxiety of people involved in disasters such as the Sewol ferry accident and earthquakes, to have a national mental healthcare response policy for these crises. Projects including development of mental health management programs customized according to age/region/ special group targeting ordinary people and verification of clinical effectiveness (conducting application evaluation of the samples), development of indices for mental health and community restoration models, development of mental illness treatment and intervention models and verification of their effects, and model development for early detection of mental illnesses and prevention would provide useful information for generating national policies. Secondly, the policy objective of 'Integration of patients with serious mental disease into local communities' puts emphasis on system improvement, rehabilitation through local community programs, and the importance of improving recognition. Establishment of policy enables the rehabilitation of patients with mental illness that would reduce economic costs by avoiding unnecessary hospitalization. Rehabilitation of patients with mental illness should be encouraged by providing the necessary information related to mental illness, increasing treatment, whilst preventing long term intensive treatment. Projects such as construction of effective mental disease management systems and local community models, reduction of the stigma and discrimination relevant to mental illness, and reduction of rehospitalization rate for mental disease may help to increase rehabilitation. Thirdly, the policy objective of 'Minimization of health impediment and social harmful effects caused by addiction' focuses on development of addiction prevention models, development of early selection/diagnosis of addiction treatment and restoration and development of social connection, establishment of countermeasures for prevention of long term addiction, and minimization of socially harmful effects. Addiction problems can cause all types of crimes and vulnerable social groups requiring national prevention management[24]. One out of 8 Koreans is an addict within the 4 major addiction groups (alcohol, drugs, gambling, and internet), and the cost of socio-economic loss is estimated to be more than 109 trillion won[25,26]. In particular, addictionproblems among adolescents may affect the national economy in the future. Development of projects and guidelines for treatments at each stage of addiction and verification of clinical effectiveness, would enable an effective national response. Fourthly, the policy objective of 'Realization of a safe society without suicidal risk' considers establishment of suicide prevention countermeasures and construction of systems managing a suicide high risk group as crucial factors. Analyzing the psychological, biological and social factors required for a targeted and separate suicide prevention strategy in Korea. Projects involved with obtaining data (i.e. creating a suicide statistics database, psychological autopsy), for establishing customized suicide prevention plans may enable continuous monitoring systems for persons vulnerable to committing suicide (development of a platform). T2 translational research applied to local communities centered on clinical application, as well as T1 translational research including basic mechanistic studies for major mental illnesses, and development of treatments, should be strengthened to conduct evidence-based national mental health promotion and management projects, to obtain effectiveness of local community mental health promotion projects. However, study outcomes of field applications in Korea are unsatisfactory because of lack of translational research for mental health problems, especially investment for T2 translational research. Total periodic approaches to develop technologies that enable us to solve mental health problems from basic original research to clinical or business applications,",
