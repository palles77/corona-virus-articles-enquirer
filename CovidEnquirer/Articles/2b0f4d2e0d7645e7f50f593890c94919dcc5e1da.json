We describe the epidemiology of severe influenza in a defined population 1998-2014. Method: Retrospective study of annually collected data of virologically confirmed influenza in hospitalized children 0-17 years living in the catchment area (230,000 children). We gathered information about comorbidity and complications from case records, and compared Influenza A, B and A(H1N1)pdm09 with respect to these factors. Results: A total of 922 children with influenza were hospitalized. The mean rate remained unchanged at 22.5-24.2 per 100,000 children per year. There were two major outbreaks: influenza A(H3N2) in 2003-2004 and the A(H1N1) pandemic in 2009-2010. The proportion of children with influenza B increased from 8% during the first half of the study period to 28% during the second half. The highest admission rate was found in children <3 months of age, 169 per 100,000. Children with influenza B were older than those with influenza A. Comorbidity was found in 34%, complications in 41%, and 11% needed intensive care management. The mortality rate was 0.17/100,000 children. Conclusion: Influenza remains an important reason for the hospitalization of children, especially during the first years of life. The increasing proportion of influenza B may have to be considered when recommending influenza vaccines.",

During the pandemic, adjuvanted monovalent H1N1 vaccine (Pandemrix \u00ae , GlaxoSmithKline Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium) was offered to all children from 6 months of age. However, except during the pandemic season, when 60% of all children accepted the offer, the vaccine uptake has been low (<5%), perhaps due to fear of side effects or unawareness of the severity of influenza [2] [3] [4] .",

Previous epidemiologic studies used different methods for estimating the number of influenza cases, such as excess of cases with influenza-like illness during influenza seasons, virus isolation, and rapid methods like immunofluorescence and PCR [22] . At our laboratory immunofluorescence and viral isolation were replaced by the more sensitive PCR in October 2007. To what extent this has contributed to our observed increase of influenza B can be discussed. The initial PCR system had a higher sensitivity for influenza B compared to immunofluorescence and virus isolation, while the sensitivity for influenza A was lower. The influenza A PCR has since then been continually improved, and in a review by Mahoney et al. it is stipulated that well optimized RT-PCR assays have 5-10% higher sensitivity than virus isolation [23] .",
