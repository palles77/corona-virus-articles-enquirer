The disease was termed ''infantile periarteritis nodosa.'' 2, 3 In children, seasonality (ie, peak incidence in winter/spring) and clustering of cases suggest an infectious cause yet to be identified. Kawasaki's disease is not seen in children aged less than 3 months and is rarely seen in adults, which supports the presence of an infectious agent for which passive maternal immunity is protective. After childhood, most adults have developed protective immunity. This theory is widely accepted. 2 Many pathogens have been associated with Kawasaki's disease, for example, Rickettsial sp., Propriobacterium acnes, Leptospira, Streptococcus sanguis, retrovirus, Epstein-Barr virus, cytomegalovirus, toxic shock syndrome (TSS), coronavirus, human Boca virus, and Coxiella burnetti, [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] but the evidence to support their causality is lacking/unconfirmed.",

            "text": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is the most frequently reported infectious disease associated with Kawasaki's disease in the rare cases in adults. 9 It has been hypothesized that Kawasaki's disease in adults is more commonly associated with HIV because the disease may be caused by a pathogen acquired in childhood and then reactivates in adulthood because of HIV-related immunodeficiency. [4] [5] [6] [7] It has been shown that there is infiltration of IgA plasma cells in Kawasaki's disease with CD8 T lymphocytes/CK8 macrophages present in inflammatory infiltrates of the affected tissues, and intra-cytoplasmic RNA inclusion bodies in ciliated bronchial epithelium have been demonstrated in acute Kawasaki's disease and after its resolution. These findings support a potential intracellular infectious agent acquired via the respiratory route and remaining in a dormant state until it later reactivates. 10 In adult patients, the initial differential diagnosis of Kawasaki's disease includes infectious diseases that present fever with rash, mucosal involvement, and cervical adenopathy, for example, Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever, scarlet fever, TSS, adult Still's disease, systemic lupus erythematosus, meningococcemia, Arcanobacterium haemolyticum, staphylococcal scaldedskin syndrome, Stevens-Johnson syndrome, toxic epidermal necrolysis, parvovirus B19, roseola, rubella, measles, and dengue. 3, 9, [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] An experienced clinician who performs a careful clinical history, physical examination, and some nonspecific laboratory tests should be able to make a presumptive diagnosis of Kawasaki's disease. A clue to the clinical diagnosis of Kawasaki's disease stems from the fact that the disease has 3 phases: The acute phase lasts for approximately 7 to 14 days, manifested by fever, conjunctival suffusion, pharyngitis, cracked lips/strawberry tongue, swelling/erythema of the dorsum of the hands/feet, and a maculopapular scarlatiniform rash or erythema multiforme type of rash. Tachycardia caused by myocarditis is common during this phase. During the subacute phase, the fever, rash, and adenopathy usually resolve, but the conjunctival suffusion persists. Periungual desquamation ensues. Thrombocytosis, which is common in this phase, occurs from days 10 to 25. Although nonspecific, Beau lines (transverse grooves in the nails) and temporary hair loss also can be seen during this phase. The convalescent phase begins when all these signs have resolved and lasts until the complete normalization of the erythrocyte sedimentation rate (ESR). Recurrence or persistence of fever can be seen with some frequency and is associated with increased risk of late coronary complications. The clinical phases described are typical of Kawasaki's disease in children, but there is no classic description of the phases in adults (Tables I and II) . 3, 9, 15 ",

If Kawasaki's disease is untreated, it usually resolves spontaneously after several weeks. The major pathologic feature of Kawasaki's disease is acute systemic vasculitis. Inflammation of the coronary arteries usually develops early in the acute phase until 4 weeks after onset of disease. Coronary artery biopsy specimens reveal that there is marked endothelial cell edema, proliferation, necrosis, and adhesion of polymorphonuclear leukocytes to endothelium in these lesions. Specifically, there is an acute inflammatory response with elevated levels of circulating cytokines and CD4 and CD8 cells, polyclonal hypergammaglobulinemia on serum protein electrophoresis, and circulating IgG and IgM immunocomplexes. [2] [3] [4] Cardiac manifestations of Kawasaki's disease in the acute phase include pericarditis, myocarditis, endocarditis, inflammation of the conduction system, and coronary artery involvement. Thrombosis and infarction may occur predominantly in the first year, and these processes are associated with aneurysm formation. A large Japanese study demonstrated that 25% of patients with acute Kawasaki's disease were shown by coronary angiography to have coronary aneurysms. 3, 4 Generally, myocarditis usually occurs during the acute phase of Kawasaki's disease and usually re-solves spontaneously. The presence of myocarditis does not correlate well in predicting concomitant coronary artery aneurysms. Clinically, patients may develop a pericardial effusion and an associated S3 or S4 gallop on physical examination. The presence of a pericardial effusion may manifest as low-voltage amplitude on electrocardiogram and transient left ventricular dysfunction on echocardiography. Longterm impairment of left ventricular function rarely occurs. However, if there is coronary artery disease then persistent valvular disease may coexist, particularly affecting the aortic and mitral valves. [16] [17] [18] Long-term complications are related to the persistence of coronary artery aneurysms, seen in the chronic phase of the disease, and associated with increased risk of ischemic heart disease, thrombotic occlusions, and premature atherosclerosis. Coronary artery aneurysms occur in 20% to 25% of cases. Associated conditions with aneurysmal formation include the fever height/duration, elevated ESR, leukocytosis, and disease duration. However, none of these are absolute predictive of coronary artery aneurysm.",

            "text": "The natural history of coronary artery aneurysms is related to aneurysmal size. Small (<5 mm) to moderate-sized (5-8 mm) aneurysms are detected after the acute stage regress in approximately 50% of cases. However, approximately 1% of patients who recover from acute Kawasaki's disease develop giant coronary artery aneurysms (>8 mm in diameter) or coronary artery obstruction caused by thrombosis or stenosis. Giant coronary aneurysms have the lowest regression rate, highest risk of stenosis, and strongest association with myocardial infarction. Coronary artery aneurysms occur predominantly in the proximal segments and at bifurcations of the coronary arteries, and there is usually multivessel involvement. Systemic aneurysms also may occur in approximately 2% of patients, particularly in the axillary and iliac arteries. [16] [17] [18] Salicylates and intravenous gamma globulin therapy have been shown to reduce the morbidity and incidence of coronary abnormalities from approximately 25% to less than 5% at 6 to 8 weeks after initiation of therapy. Furthermore, coronary aneurysms regress within 1 to 2 years in most patients. [1] [2] [3] Coronary artery screening should be conducted early with echocardiography, and electrocardiography should be performed in children with suspected Kawasaki's disease to evaluate for ischemic or arrhythmic changes; this should be repeated at 10 to 14 days to look for new lesions. It is uncertain whether children who have had Kawasaki because there is an absence of prospective or retrospective long-term follow-up data. 17, 18 Coronary angiography provides adequate luminal visualization of blood vessels, but it is limited in that it cannot specifically detect intramural changes in the coronary tree. Several postmortem examinations of patients with Kawasaki's disease who have angiographically documented regression of coronary artery aneurysms revealed intimal proliferation and fibrosis not apparent on angiography. Intravascular ultrasound imaging of the coronary arteries may allow more thorough evaluation to visualize the cross-section coronary wall morphology and the healing process.",

            "text": "The frequency of follow-up visits for patients with a giant or medium solitary aneurysm or multiple aneurysms is based on the patient's baseline clinical condition. If noninvasive studies or clinical symptoms suggest myocardial ischemia, then radioisotope myocardial perfusion scanning, coronary angiography, or both are indicated. The specific type of study should be performed on the basis of the particular area of interest to be evaluated. As mentioned earlier, although coronary angiography may allow visualization of the intraluminal aspect of a coronary vessel, myocardial perfusion imaging may better assess the endothelial function of the coronary tree. Patients with no evidence of aneurysm or ectasia at the 1-year evaluation are not likely to benefit from further repeated echocardiography, although patients with transient coronary artery ectasia early in the illness may be followed up at 3-to 5-year intervals. 19, 20 Magnetic resonance imaging can also assess coronary morphology with low temporal resolution (20-50 ms). The 3-dimensional spatial resolution achievable is marginal for coronary arterial imaging and is not as reliable as multidetector computed tomography. However, magnetic resonance imaging has been shown to be useful in evaluating for severe proximal multivessel coronary artery disease or coronary aneurysms in selected patients with Kawasaki's disease. [21] [22] [23] Kawasaki's disease in adults can be confused with other infectious disorders associated with a fever and rash. The most likely infectious disease disorders likely to be confused with Kawasaki's disease include group A streptococcal scarlet fever, TSS, and Rocky Mountain Spotted Fever (RMSF). As with all differential diagnostic problems, accurate presumptive clinical diagnosis rests on identifying the characteristic physical findings/nonspecific laboratory tests that are not consistent but that are characteristic of the disorder. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] In addition to fever and a diffuse rash, the cardinal findings in streptococcal scarlet fever are circumoral pallor and Pastia's lines. Nonspecific laboratory abnormalities associated with scarlet fever include eosinophilia, an elevated ASO titer, and normal liver function test results. 12 In contrast with scarlet fever, in TSS there is a scarlatina form rash resembling scarlet fever but also conjunctival suffusion and edema of the dorsum of the hands and feet. In TSS, the physical findings in scarlet fever are not present, but in addition, patients with TSS have increased liver function test results, no eosinophilia, and elevated ASO titer. Also, unlike scarlet fever, hypotension/shock will be present in the sickest patients with TSS. Diagnosis of TSS is made by clinical criteria. In addition, S. aureus of the TSS-1 toxin-producing variety may be cultured from mucosal surfaces. TSS may result from TSS-1 colonization or infection in addition to being associated with tampon use. 12, 13 RMSF presents characteristically presents with a maculopapular rash that occurs on the wrist/ankles 3 to 5 days after the onset of infection. Later, the maculopapular lesions become petechial and may extend centripetally. Typically, RMSF presents with severe headache/confusion that may suggest neurologic infection. RMSF with abdominal pain suggests an intra-abdominal infection. In addition to the typical distribution of the petechial rash, clinical findings of RMSF include conjunctival suffusion, splenomegaly, and edema of the dorsum of the hands/feet. Nonspecific laboratory tests in RMSF include a normal/slightly elevated white blood cell count, relative lymphopenia, and thrombocytopenia. Serum transaminases are usually mild to moderately transiently elevated. The ESR is not highly elevated with RMSF. Diagnosis is confirmed by demonstrating increased Rickettsia rickettsii titers (Tables III-V) . 15 Kawasaki's disease has no specific diagnostic tests, and the diagnosis is necessarily based on clinical criteria. Kawasaki's disease resembles scarlet fever in having a diffuse maculopapular rash. Unlike HEART & LUNG VOL. 39, NO. 2 www.heartandlung.org 171 from scarlet fever, TSS, and RMSF in terms of therapy, that is, intravenous immunoglobulin/acetylsalicylic acid are the preferred therapies for Kawasaki's disease versus antimicrobial therapy for scarlet fever, TSS, and RMSF. [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] Pathologically, the involved lymph nodes in Kawasaki's disease shows prominent polymorphonuclear cell infiltration, patchy necrosis, and small-vessel thrombocytosis.",
