In looking at these events from a system perspective, we should be aware that the point at which a system fails is often a weakness due to failure in other parts of the system. A system is defined as \"a dynamic order of parts and processes standing in mutual interaction with each other\" (von Bertallanfy, 1968) . Therefore it is necessary for all professionals reading this text to examine all of the parts and processes, especially the interactions among the parts.",

Shortly after the cases emerged, Soviet officials explained that the source of the outbreak was related to the ingestion of contaminated meat. According to their report, contaminated animals and meat from an anthrax epizootic south of Sverdlovsk caused 96 cases of human anthrax (Meselson, 1988) . Of these cases, 17 were cutaneous anthrax and 79 were gastrointestinal anthrax. Of the 96 cases, 64 of the gastrointestinal anthrax cases were fatal. At the time, there was great debate among officials from other nations as they tried to determine if the outbreak may have actually been due to covert Soviet bioweapons production.",

Four days later, seven or eight persons from the military installation were admitted to hospital number 20 in the suburbs where the military installation is located. Their symptoms were high fever (104\u00b0), blue ears and lips, choking, and difficulty breathing. They died within 6-7 h, and autopsies revealed severe pulmonary edema plus symptoms of a serious toxemia. About 6 days after the illness first appeared, the source and other doctors from various hospitals were called together by the district epidemiologist. The number of fatalities had risen sharply, and the source estimated deaths by this time at 40. The epidemiologist announced the outbreak of an anthrax epidemic and gave a lecture on the disease. He claimed the epidemic was caused by an illegally slaughtered cow suffering from anthrax in a town about 10 km northeast of Sverdlovsk. He said the beef had been sold in the suburb where the fatalities were occurring. This explanation was not accepted by the doctors in attendance because the fatalities were caused by pulmonary anthrax as opposed to gastric or skin anthrax, which would be more likely if anthraxcontaminated beef were eaten or handled.",

Victims presented with severe respiratory distress and died within a few days of the onset of symptoms. This belief came from epidemiological data showing that most victims lived or worked in a narrow zone extending from the bioproduction facility to the southern city limit. Furthermore, livestock downwind from the point of release died of anthrax along the same zone's extended axis. The zone paralleled the northerly wind that prevailed shortly before the outbreak (Meselson et al., 1994) . Other scientists harbored doubts about the official US accusation, noting that an accidental release of anthrax spores could have been in connection with a defensive biological warfare research program, which was allowed under the 1972 convention. It was later concluded that the escape of an aerosol of anthrax pathogen at the military facility caused the outbreak.",

In the 1980s during the Reagan administration, Sverdlovsk would become one of the major points in the US indictment of the Soviet Union to build the case that the Soviets were violating the ban on the use of biological weapons imposed by the 1972 Biological Warfare Convention, which both the United States and the Soviet Union had signed. Despite the proof that Western scientists had, the Soviets (see Fig. 7 .1) refused to discuss the incident and maintained their position that they did not have a program in bioweapons development and production. In fact, the strain of anthrax produced in Military Compound 19 near Sverdlovsk was believed by experts to be the most powerful in the Soviet arsenal (\"Anthrax 836\").",

These events, in addition to the poor refuse disposal and sewer services, created an abundant food supply for rats and other vermin. Some reports point to a possible precursor event, which involved the die-off of rats in Mamala village to such an extent that they were \"falling off rafters, dead, in great numbers\" (John, 1994) . By mid-September, despite the available epidemiological clues, 10% of the village population was ill with bubonic plague.",

Public health authorities were alerted, word began to spread through the medical community, and the one hospital was designated for new suspected plague admissions. Shops began closing in the most heavily affected region of the city, medical practitioners began to leave the city, and local pharmacies sold out of available tetracycline. Hospital admissions continued to grow and public health authorities were barely able to locate sufficient antibiotics to treat the ill and their care providers. Within 3 weeks the case-fatality rate had dropped from 80% to below 10%. Until adequate government supplies of tetracycline begin to arrive, approximately 30% of Surat's population fled, businesses closed, and public facilities (schools, swimming pools) shut down.

According to researchers, the index case for this outbreak came from a 1-year-old boy in the small village of Meliandou (Gu\u00e9ck\u00e9dou Province), in the West African nation of Guinea. The researchers learned that children in Meliandou had been playing near the hollow of a large, dead tree. The tree had a colony of bats. The bats were believed to be infected with Ebola virus (Mar\u00ed-Sa\u00e9z et al., 2015) . This has relevance because of what is currently believed to be the role of bats in the epizootic transmission cycle of Ebola virus (see Fig. 7 .7). We also know that the 1-year-old boy mentioned previously died from a mysterious febrile illness, which spread throughout his family, to other villagers and then outside his village.",

By that time it had spread to neighboring African countries (Liberia, Nigeria, Senegal, and Sierra Leone). Limited public health resources (see Fig. 7 .8) and volunteer medical groups worked to quell the quickly spreading epidemic, but they were overwhelmed by the number of patients and patient contacts. It was not until August 8, 2014, that the WHO declared the epidemic to be a public health emergency of international concern (WHO Report, 2014). This begs the obvious question, \"Why did it take nearly 5 months to make such a declaration?\"",

Before getting on the plane in Liberia, Mr. Duncan assisted an ill pregnant woman by helping her out of a taxi and into a hospital. It is believed the woman was an EVD patient, but he was not aware of this. Regardless of what he knew, Mr. Duncan arrived in Houston feeling well with no fever or other symptoms. Six days later Mr. Duncan felt very ill, which prompted him to seek medical attention at a hospital in Houston, Texas. His travel history was not discussed at that time, so he was discharged from the emergency room (ER) with some antibiotics for what was believed to be a routine illness. He went back to the apartment, and a few days later his condition was so severe that he reported to the ER at Texas Health Presbyterian Hospital in Dallas where it became apparent that he was a suspect EVD patient. He was admitted to the intensive care unit and ended up in an isolation ward. His condition worsened and he later died. Unfortunately, infection prevention standards at the hospital were not entirely adequate. This resulted in two nurses (Nina Pham and Amber Vinson) being infected with Ebola virus. They were both treated successfully and fully recovered 2 weeks later.",

Meanwhile, state and local officials in Texas had an incident on their hands. Emergency management and public health agencies had to work together to ensure that the apartment where Duncan had been staying did not become the cause of more infections. All of Mr. Duncan's contacts had to be identified, placed under strict quarantine, and monitored. After their quarantine period the apartment became a hot zone that required thorough decontamination by a commercial hazmat clean-up group, Cleaning Guys, LLC (refer to Fig. 7.9) . None of Mr. Duncan's contacts outside of the hospital became infected and the apartment he resided in and all its contents were rendered safe using technical decontamination procedures.",

For example, how does a government begin to strengthen its core public health capacities as demanded by the international health regulations? What counts as a global health security concern? In the context of the governance of global health, including WHO reform, it will be important to distil lessons learned from the Ebola outbreak. The Lancet invited a group of respected global health practitioners to reflect on these lessons, to explore the idea of global health security, and to offer suggestions for next steps. Their contributions describe some of the major threats to individual and collective human health as well as the values and recommendations that should be considered to counteract such threats in the future. Many different perspectives are proposed. Their common goal is a more sustainable and resilient society for human health and well-being (Heymann et al., 2015) . What will make for an interesting postoutbreak study are the geopolitical implications of a largescale outbreak of a Category A agent, such as Ebola hemorrhagic fever. Remember that we will always be one simple border crossing or international flight away from the beginning of the next outbreak.",

The Rajneeshee incident involving the intentional contamination of food with bacteria was the largest act of bioterrorism to occur in the United States. Acquisition of the agent, the ease of production, and the covert and simple nature of the attack emphasizes the indiscriminate and insidious nature of biological terrorism.

This emphasizes the importance of early detection and standard procedures for containment. The Amerithrax incident of 2001 showed us how vulnerable a nation is to a small amount of formulated biological material. Looking back on that time, the events, as they unfolded, seemed surreal. It was hard to believe that we were under attack and no one really knew for some time how widespread it was or when it would end. Many have criticized public officials for how they handled or mishandled the event. However, we believe that public health officials moved quickly to disseminate information and increase the awareness of the public (potential victims) and the vigilance of healthcare providers (alert guardians).",

The \"international community\" will have to act more quickly to resource and assemble the teams of experts needed to quell the next outbreak in its early stages. Once a viral hemorrhagic fever leaves a small village and moves into a large metropolitan area, public health control measures become extremely difficult, if not impossible.
