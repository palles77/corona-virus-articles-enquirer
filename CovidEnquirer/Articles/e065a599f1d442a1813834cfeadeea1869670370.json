The study drugs were administered after a 12-hour overnight fast. After the study drug administration, serial blood samples were collected for 72 hours after administration. Plasma drug concentrations were determined using high-performance liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Several pharmacokinetic parameters, including C max , T max , t 1/2 , AUC 0-t , and AUC 0-\u221e , were determined from the plasma concentrations of the 2 formulations of arbidol using noncompartmental analysis. The formulations were to be considered bioequivalent if the log-transformed ratios of C max and AUC were within the predetermined bioequivalence range of 80% to 125% established by the State Food and Drug Administration (SFDA) of the People's Republic of China. Tolerability was assessed by monitoring vital signs (blood pressure, heart rate, temperature, and electrocardiography), laboratory analysis (hematology, blood biochemistry, hepatic function, and urinalysis), and subject interview on adverse events.",

It is indicated for the prevention and treatment of influenza A and B, respiratory syncytial virus, severe acute respiratory syndrome (including exacerbation of bronchitis and pneumonia), secondary immunodeficiency, overall therapy for chronic bronchitis, pneumonia, and recurrent herpesvirus infections, and for the prevention of postoperative infections and stabilization of immune status. [1] [2] [3] [4] [5] Arbidol might prevent contact and entry of viruses into cells by inhibiting the fusion of viral lipid membranes with cell membranes. It has also been reported that arbidol has interferon-inducing activity, activated phagocytic activity of macrophages, and stimulated humoral and cell-mediated immunity, and that it heightens the body's ability to fight infection. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] T max with a single 50-mg dose of arbidol has been reported to be 1.2 hours; with 100 mg, 1.5 hours. Arbidol is metabolized in the liver. The t 1/2 of the drug in the body is 17 to 21 hours. Approximately 40% is excreted unchanged, mostly (38.9%) through the bile, with an insignificant amount (0.12%) excreted through the kidneys. Within the first 24 hours after administration, 90% of the drug has left the body. 11 The aim of the present study was to compare the pharmacokinetic properties and determine bioequivalence of two 200-mg formulations of arbidol: a newly developed generic formulation (dispersible tablet; test) and a branded capsule formulation (reference) in healthy Chinese fasted male volunteers.",

The results would be instructive for administration in patients in the different states of illness in clinical practice. The present study had a few limitations that should be considered. First was the small sample size; singledose, open-label design; and assessment of clinical relevance of the adverse events by the investigators. The pharmacokinetic data in this study were obtained only from healthy Chinese male volunteers; the pharmacokinetic properties of arbidol might be different in women and in infected patients in clinical practice. Because this study was conducted in fasted subjects, the results cannot be applied to predict the pharmacokinetic properties of arbidol concurrently administered with food. The methods used for the assessment of the tolerability were not perfect, and the sample size was not large enough to observe all of the possible adverse events. The sample size, 20 volunteers, is typical in bioequivalence studies according to the SFDA guideline. 16 However, a larger sample size may be needed to assess tolerability and to represent pharmacokinetic properties in the Chinese population in future studies.",
