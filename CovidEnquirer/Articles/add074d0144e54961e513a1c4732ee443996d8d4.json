            "text": "Avian infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) that causes respiratory and nephritic diseases in chicken is a major poultry pathogen leading to serious economic loss worldwide. The nephropathogenic IBV strains cause nephritis and kidney lesions intrinsically and the pathogenic mechanism is still unclear. In the present study, SPF chicks were infected with three nephropathogenic IBVs of different virulence and their gene expression profiles in chicken kidney were compared at transcriptome level. As a result, 1279 differentially expressed (DE) genes were found in very virulent SCDY2 inoculated group, 145 in virulent SCK2 group and 74 in non-virulent LDT3-A group when compared to mock infected group. Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG pathway enrichment analysis on SCDY2 group displayed that the up-regulated DE genes were mainly involved in cell apoptosis, and the downregulated genes were involved in metabolic processes and DNA replication. Protein-Protein Interaction (PPI) analysis showed that DE genes in SCDY2 group formed a network, and the core of the network was composed by cell apoptosis and immune response proteins. The clustering of gene expression profile among the three virus inoculated groups indicated that the majority of up-regulated DE genes on apoptosis in very virulent SCDY2 group were up-regulated more or less in virulent SCK2 group and those down-regulated on innate immune response in SCDY2 group were also down-regulated differently in SCK2 group. In addition, the number of apoptotic cells detected experimentally in kidney tissue were very different among the three virus inoculated groups and were positively accordant with the viral titer, kidney lesions and viral virulence of each group. Taken all together, the present study revealed that virulent nephropathogenic IBV infection modified a number of gene expression and induction of apoptosis in kidney cells may be a major pathogenic determinant for virulent nephropathogenic IBV.",

            "text": "The pathogenesis of IBV is complicated. In clinical case, infection of IBV is commonly followed by secondary bacterial/virus infections, which is the main cause of death and severe lesions [12] . Under the experimental conditions, the dynamic distributions of H120, M41 (respiratory type) and SAIBK (nephropathogenic) were described. They exhibited similar titers in lung, however titer of SAIBK in kidney was higher than H120, M41 at 4-10 days of post infection (dpi) [13] . Virus loads in kidney at early stage of infection may be responsible for interstitial nephritis and tubule lesions. In addition, using two dimensional gel electrophoresis, the differentially expressed proteins after infection with IBV strains were mainly relate to cytoskeleton, binding of calcium ions, the stress response, anti-oxidative and macromolecular metabolism [14] . In order to understand the host cellular genes involved in the pathogenesis of IBV, high throughput techniques such as microarray [15] [16] [17] and RNA sequencing [18] [19] [20] were carried out. The immune responses to IBV were analyzed and a diversity of innate immunity and helper T-cell-type-1-biased adaptive immunity were activated in the host cell during early defense against IBV. Several immune factors were involved to active mucosal immunity, including toll-like receptors, type 1 interferon, interleukin 1 beta, complement, T-cell signaling molecules, surface markers and effector molecules [21] . The differential expression (DE) genes in chicken kidney after infection of ck/CH/LDL/ 091022 were also analyzed, 1777 DE genes were detected, including focal adhesion pathway, cytokine receptor interaction pathway, production of cell adhesion molecules and peroxisome function [15] . In addition, the DE genes in the lung tissues of IBV infected 18-days-old chicken and DE genes in the spleen of two chicken lines L10H and L10L were analyzed [16, 22] . These studies exhibited a view of the molecular antiviral mechanisms of chicken response to the IBV infection. However, only one strain was used in these two reported experiments, it is difficult to compare the transcriptomics of these two strains under different animal experiments.",

These results provided invaluable information on the cellular signaling pathways involved either in the cellular response to viral infections, or the viral manipulation of cellular machinery to ensure their own survival. Previous studies demonstrated that IBV could induce apoptosis in cultured cells, which may be related to the virus pathogenicity [26] [27] [28] . Only few recent studies have investigated the changes in the expression of cellular proteins during IBV infection in ex vivo or in ovo [29] [30] [31] . However, in vivo infection model could yield more biologically relevant insights into pathogenesis.",

The very virulent SCDY2 induced apoptosis in kidney cells was characterized as 1.) more genes functionally related to apoptotic processes were significantly up-regulated (Fig. 5 D) ; 2.) metabolic stress in these cells was high as shown in GO, KEGG and clustering analysis; and 3.) more cells in the kidney became apoptotic ( Fig. 6B and C) .

A research carried out by the same group on regulation of IBV replication by host encoded siRNAs in chicken kidney cells indicated that some host genes related to innate immune response such as TLR3 and MYD88 were negatively regulated by host encoded siRNAs [49] , indicating the molecules direct regulation of host cells into apoptosis post virulent IBV infection is more complicated and largely unknown at present.",

The up-regulation of apoptosis pathway and down-regulation of genes on innate immune response and cell metabolism were observed in comparative transcriptome analysis and positively correlated to the virulence of the virus inoculated. In addition, increased viral reproductive replication and cell apoptosis were detected in very virulent SCDY2 inoculated group. These data indicated that induction of apoptosis in kidney cells may be a key pathogenic determinant and associated with the virulence of nephropathgenic IBV. ",
