These are physiologic responses to PS but the Ebola virus displays PS molecules on its membrane's surface and the huge numbers of viruses cause a pathologic inflammatory cytokine storm and a hemorrhagic consumptive coagulopathy.

            "text": "Phosphatidylserine (PS) molecules are present in cell membranes where they are actively kept on their inner leaflets. In senescent and otherwise damaged cells PS moves to their surface where it becomes a signal for their phagocytic removal [1] , the platform upon which the coagulation cascade takes place [2] , a ligand for the TIM-1 receptor on T helper one (Th1) cells that activates its inflammatory cytokine secretion [3] and a ligand that binds to TIM receptors on mononuclear immune cells to provide the wakeup call for the innate immune response [4] . Billions of cells become apoptotic daily and display PS on their surface but they are rapidly removed by phagocytes that recognize it [5] and the Th1inflammation [3] , cascade generated blood coagulation [2] and the innate immune activation do not take place [4] . In Ebola PS on the surface of its virus activates Th1 inflammatory cytokine secretion and the PS exposure is so great that a cytokine storm is produced [3] and all the thrombin generated on the cascade's PS platforms generates enough thrombin to consume coagulation components and produce a hemorrhagic consumptive coagulopathy [2] . Macrophages and dendritic cells are phagocytes that secrete inflammatory cytokines when TLRs on their surface recognize foreign or damage associated molecular patterns but they also display TIM-1 receptors and in Ebola those receptors bind to and phagocytize the PS+ viruses and they become infected [6] . When infected these cells are prime viral replicators that generate viruses to infect other cells. In addition, the infected dendritic cells may no longer be able to MHC present antigenic pathogen peptides to immune cells in the adaptive immune response producing immunologic depression. In 2017 it was discovered that PS on the Ebola virus could bind to the TIM-1 receptor on Th1 cells and independently produce a lethal cytokine storm in mice [3] . This was proven when an Ebola infection in knockout TIM-1 \u2212/\u2212 negative did not produce a cytokine storm and the mice survived even though the viral load was only minimally affected [3] . The hypothesis presented here is that annexin V's therapeutic administration in Ebola can prevent its Th1 cell generated inflammatory cytokine storm, stop the cascade generated hemorrhagic consumptive coagulopathy and prevent macrophage and dendritic cell infection. Unfortunately when annexin V cloaks PS the cascade can't function and hemostasis will not be possible so let us very briefly examine the components of inflammation, blood coagulation and annexin V with regard to the possibility that its administration can prevent Ebola's cytokine storm and coagulopathy without causing bleeding. T continued in a late mediated inflammatory response when some of the cells damaged by those cytokines become necrotic causing high mobility group box one (HMGB1) molecules release by nuclear disruption. The HMGB1 molecules then bind to the TLR4 receptors on dendritic cells and cause their inflammatory cytokine secretion [7] . The PS exposed on the surface of cells damaged by the innate and late mediated inflammatory responses binds to the TIM-1 receptor on Th1 cells and they begin a feedback cycle of inflammatory cytokine secretion that expose more PS and amplifies the inflammation [3] . This amplified inflammation damages and kills both pathogens and healthy cells and the PS displayed on the latter activate the innate immune response when an infection is present and make hemostasis possible when a vascular wall is breached. This physiologic PS feedback generation contrast with the pathologic cytokine storm and hemorrhagic consumptive coagulopathy in Ebola where membrane displayed PS is on every virus.",

In the tenase complex activated factor VIIIa and IXa bind to membrane displayed PS and are joined there by factor X to be activated [9] . The activated factor Xa then joins factor Va on PS in the prothrombinase complex and the factor Xa, factor Va and PS amalgam catalytically begins changing prothrombin to thrombin and exponentially increases its generation making hemostasis possible [10] .

This increases thrombin generation but not exponentially. This is a good thing because though fibrin generation is desirable during cellulitis intravascular blood coagulation is not. For the cascade's exponential thrombin generation to take place factor XII must activate factor XI so it can activate factor IX and to do this factor XII must be activated by binding to sulfatide on activated platelets [12] . This is not possible intravascularly because activated platelets secrete a factor XII activation inhibitor [13] . It is possible when a vascular breach is present and collagen is exposed because platelets displaying sulfatide and PS on their surface bind to the collagen and the blood flow washes away the inhibitor. In a vascular breach TF and PS are only exposed at the breach site and factor IX is activated there by factor XIIa making the cascade's exponential increase in thrombin generation possible. The same thing happens when an atherosclerotic plaque ruptures and collagen is exposed.",

The following 2016 study by Park supports the hypothesis that annexin V can block cytokine storms and consumptive coagulopathies [14] . In this study gram negative septicemia was induced in mice where the lipopolysaccharide (LPS) molecule on those bacteria generated a lethal cytokine storm and generated excess fibrin (not a coagulopathy). LPS generates thrombin by binding to TLR4 on dendritic cells. It was found that a single injection of annexin V stopped the cytokine storm, reduced fibrin generation and enabled the mice survival [14] . The annexin V did this by cloaking PS on damaged cells and by blocking the binding of LPS to TLR4. Let us now take a brief look at annexin V.",
