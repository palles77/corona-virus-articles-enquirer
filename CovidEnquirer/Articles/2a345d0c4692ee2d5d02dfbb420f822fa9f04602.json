C 0 t curve A graphical method that can be used to indicate the complexity (or size) of DNA. The DNA is heated to make it single stranded, then allowed to cool. The kinetics of renaturation (reannealing) of the DNA can be followed spectroscopically and the rate is affected by the length of the DNA fragments and by the extent of repetition. Highly repetitive DNA anneals much faster than unique sequence DNA (single copies sequences). C 0 is the starting concentration of the specific DNA sequence in moles of nucleotides per liter and t is the reaction time in seconds. The C 0 t value varies depending on the temperature of reassociation and the concentration of monovalent cations and it is usual to use fixed reference values: a reassociation temperature of 65 C and a Na 1 concentration of 0.3 M NaCl. (Cot1 DNA has a C 0 t value of 1.0).

The heteromultimeric holoenzyme (500\u00c0600 kDa) has 10 or 12 subunits with the ratio of \u03b1,\u03b2,\u03b3 and \u03b4 reflecting that present in the cell. It has been implicated in various neuronal functions including synaptic plasticity. It is highly concentrated in the postsynaptic region and undergoes autophosphorylation at several sites in a manner that depends on the frequency and duration of Ca 21 spikes. Constitutively active CaMKII produces dendritic exocytosis in the absence of calcium stimulus. CaMKII activation is the primary event leading to inactivation of both CSF (cytostatic factor) and MPF (maturation promoting factor; cyclin) in mammalian eggs. Other CaM kinases with restricted tissue distribution are also known, e.g. DAP kinases, protein kinase IV. Calcium/calmodulin-dependent protein kinase kinase 1 (CaMKK1, EC 2.7.11.17, 505aa) phosphorylates CaM kinases and is involved in regulating apoptosis.",

CheW (167aa) bridges CheA to the methyl-accepting chemotaxis proteins to allow regulated phosphotransfer to CheY (129aa) and CheB. CheA (EC 2.7.13.3, 654aa) is a histidine kinase activated by autophosphorylation in proportion to the degree of receptor methylation, and passes phosphate to CheB (a two-component system) or CheY. When phosphorylated or acetylated CheY exhibits enhanced binding to FliM (see fli genes) and reverses the direction of flagellar rotation (causes tumbling). CheB (EC 3.1.1.61, 349aa) is a methyl esterase activated by CheA phosphorylation, that demethylates (and upregulates) receptors that have been desensitized (methylated) by CheR (EC 2.1.1.80, 286aa). The degree of receptor methylation allows the bacterium to 'remember' chemical concentrations from the recent past, a few seconds, and compare them to those it is currently experiencing, thus 'knows' whether it is travelling up or down a gradient. Other proteins such as CheZ (214aa), CheC (CheY-P phosphatase, 219aa in B. subtilis) and CheD (chemoreceptor glutamine deamidase, EC 3.5.1.44, 166aa in B. subtilis) are involved in regulation.

By testing different concentrations of putative chemotactic factor in non-gradient conditions, it is possible to calculate the enhancement of movement expected due simply to chemokinesis and to compare this with the distances moved in positive and negative gradients. Good experimental design thus allows chemotaxis to be distinguished from chemokinesis. checkpoint Any stage in the cell cycle at which the cycle can be halted and entry into the next phase postponed.

Starting with the known sequence of a gene shown by classical genetics to be near to the novel gene, new clones are picked from a genomic library by hybridization with a short probe generated from the appropriate end of the known sequence.

CLIP-1 binds to growing ends of microtubules that have bound plus end-binding proteins such as EB1 and is part of the microtubule plus end tracking system that regulates microtubule dynamics. CLIP-2 (CAP-Gly domaincontaining linker protein 2, CLIP-115, 1046aa) links microtubules to the dendritic lamellar body and may be involved in control of brain-specific organelle translocations.

Type II collagen (COL2A1, 1487aa) is a homotrimer of alpha 1(II) collagen (chondrocalcin) specific for cartilaginous tissues and defects are the cause of a variety of chondrodysplasias. Type III collagen is found in soft connective tissues and is composed of three identical alpha-1(III) (COL3A1, 1466aa) chains. Collagen type IV does not form fibrils and is characteristic of basal lamina. Collagen type V is fibril forming, Collagen type VI acts as a cell-binding protein. Many other forms are known, often with restricted tissue distribution, some glycosylated (glucose-galactose dimer on the hydroxylysine), and nearly all types can be crosslinked through lysine side-chains.

Activation of the complement cascade occurs through two convergent pathways. In the classical pathway the formation of antibody/antigen complexes leads to binding of C1, the release of active esterase that activates C4 and C2 that in turn bind to the surface. The C42 complex splits C3 to produce C3b, an opsonin, and C3a (anaphylatoxin). C423b acts on C5 to release C5a (anaphylatoxin and chemotactic factor) leaving C5b that combines with C6789 to form a cytolytic membrane attack complex. In the alternate pathway C3 cleavage occurs without the involvement of C142, and can be activated by IgA, endotoxin, or polysaccharide-rich surfaces (e.g. yeast cell wall, zymosan). Factor B combines with C3b to form a C3 convertase that is stabilized by Factor P (properdin), generating a positive feedback loop. The alternate pathway is presumably the ancestral one upon which the sophistication of antibody recognition has been superimposed in the classical pathway. The enzymatic cascade amplifies the response, leads to the activation and recruitment of leucocytes, increases phagocytosis and induces killing directly. It is subject to various complex feedback controls that terminate the response (see Factor H, Factor I). A third pathway, the lectin-mediated pathway is similar to the classical pathway but is initiated by the binding of mannose-binding lectin and ficolins, instead of C1q (the recognition subunit of C1). There are separate entries for most of the components: see also decay accelerating factor and complement regulatory protein. complement fixation Binding of complement as a result of its interaction with immune complexes (the classical pathway) or particular surfaces (alternative pathway).",

In humans contactin-1 (1018aa) is involved in the formation of paranodal axo-glial junctions through an interaction with CNTNAP1 (contactin-associated protein 1, neurexin-4) and in oligodendrocyte generation by acting as a ligand of NOTCH1. It is GPI-anchored. Contactin-2 (axonin-1, 1040aa) is involved in the initial growth and guidance of axons. Contactin-3 (brain-derived immunoglobulin superfamily protein-1, BIG-1, Plasmacytoma-associated neuronal glycoprotein, 1028aa), contactin-4 (BIG-2, 1026aa), contactin-5 (neural recognition molecule NB-2, 1100aa) and contactin-6 (neural recognition molecule NB-3, 1028aa) are thought to have similar roles.

The G1/S transition is regulated by G1/S cyclins, entry into mitosis by G2/M cyclins. Cyclin A (A1, 465aa; A2, 432aa) interacts with cdk2 and cdc2 and is essential at both G1/S and G2/M transitions; the G1/S transition also involves cyclin D (295aa) interacting with cdk4 and cdk6 and cyclin E (410aa) interacting with cdk2. Cyclin B1 (433aa) is essential for the G2/M transition and interacts with cdc2 to form a serine/threonine kinase holoenzyme complex (maturation promoting factor, MPF); it is ubiquitinated and destroyed abruptly at the end of mitosis. Cyclin B together with cdkK1 regulates the S to G2 progression. Various other cyclins are known: cyclin C (283aa) is a component of the mediator complex. Cyclin-F (786aa) is probably involved in control of the cell cycle during S phase and G2. Cyclin G1 (295aa) is associated with G2/M phase arrest in response to DNA damage. Cyclin-H (323aa) regulates cdk7, the catalytic subunit of the cdk-activating kinase complex. Cyclin-I (377a) does not change in concentration during the cell cycle, cyclin-J (372aa) has an unknown role but is phylogentically ancient. Cyclin-K (580aa) may play a role in transcriptional regulation, cyclin L1 is a transcriptional regulator involved in the pre-mRNA splicing process, cyclin-M (cyclin-related protein FAM58A, 248aa) may have a role in regulating the cell cycle; defects cause STAR syndrome. Cyclin-O (EC 3.2.2.-, uracil-DNA glycosylase 2, 350aa) will remove uracil residues accidentally incorporated into DNA or arising by deamination of cytosine. Cyclin-T1 (726aa) is the regulatory subunit of the CDK9/ cyclin-T1 complex (positive transcription elongation factor B, P-TEFb), which is proposed to facilitate the transition from abortive to productive elongation by phosphorylating the CTD (carboxy-terminal domain) of the large subunit of RNA polymerase II. distantly related, are usually heterodimers or multimers with a high and a low affinity component and signal through JAKs.

Acetaminophen (paracetamol) has been postulated to act on a third isoform, COX-3, but this has remained elusive and there are alternative explanations. COX3: http:// www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/15705740 cyclodextrins Cyclic polymers of six, seven or eight \u03b1-1,4-linked D-glucose residues. The toroidal structure allows them to act as hydrophilic carriers of hydrophobic molecules.cycloheximide Antibiotic (281Da) isolated from Streptomyces griseus. Blocks eukaryotic (but not prokaryotic) protein synthesis by preventing initiation and elongation on 80S ribosomes. Commonly used experimentally.CYCLOIDEA Gene that regulates dorsoventral asymmetry in flowers. Encodes a transcription factor of the TCP family. cyclopiazonic acid A mycotoxin produced by Penicillium cyclopium that selectively inhibits the sarcoplasmic-endoplasmic reticulum Ca 21 -ATPase (SERCA).cyclosis Cyclical streaming of the cytoplasm of plant cells, conspicuous in giant internodal cells of algae such as Chara, in pollen tubes and in stamen hairs of Tradescantia. Term also used to denote cyclical movement of food vacuoles from mouth to cytoproct in ciliate protozoa.cyclosome See anaphase-promoting complex.cyclosporin A See ciclosporin.Cyclotella A genus of small drum-shaped diatoms with cells 3\u00c05 \u03bcm in diameter. Cyclotella meneghiniana is perhaps the commonest species, widely used in growth experiments. Image: http://silicasecchidisk. conncoll.edu cylindrospermopsin A protein synthesis inhibitor, a tricyclic alkaloid hepatotoxin originally isolated from the cyanobacterium Cylindrospermopsis raciborskii and subsequently found in other species of cyanobacteria. The mechanism of toxicity differs from that of microcystins.cypermethrin Synthetic pyrethroid used as an insecticide. Acts on sodium channels of neurons. Highly toxic to aquatic organisms, including fish. Usually a mixture of several isomers. cypin A mammalian guanine deaminase (cytosolic PSD-95 interactor) that increases dendrite number when overexpressed. Cypin contains zinc binding, collapsin response mediator protein (CRMP) homology, and PSD-95, Discs large, zona occludens-1 binding domains. Binds tubulin via its CRMP homology domain to promote microtubule assembly; this interaction is blocked by snapin.cypris Larval stage of Cirrepedia (barnacles) following nauplius stage.cyst (1) A resting stage of many prokaryotes and eukaryotes in which a cell or several cells are surrounded with a protective wall of extracellular materials.(2) A pathological fluid-filled sac bounded by a cellular wall, often of epithelial origin, found on occasion in all species of multicellular animal. May result from a wide range of insults or be of embryological origin.cysteine Cys, C The only amino acid to contain a thiol (SH) group. In intracellular enzymes the unique reactivity of this group is frequently exploited at the catalytic site (as in cysteine endopeptidases). In extracellular proteins found only as half-cystine in disulphide bridges or fatty acylated.cysteine peptidase A clan of endopeptidases (thiol proteinase, thiol protease, subclass EC 3.4.22). All have a cysteine residue in the active site that can be irreversibly inhibited by sulphydryl reagents. Includes cathepsins and papain. Natural inhibitors are alpha-2-macroglobulin and cystatins.cysteine phosphatases A large family of phosphatases that utilize a conserved 'CX5R' sequence motif to hydrolyze phosphoester bonds in proteins and in non-protein substrates. They can be divided into seven categories: (i) protein tyrosine phosphatases (PTPs); (ii) dual-specificity phosphatases (DSPs); (iii) Cdc25 phosphatases; (iv) myotubularinrelated; and (iv) low molecular weight phosphatases;(v) inositol 4-phosphatases; and (vi) Sac1-domain phosphatases.

Considered to have important roles in the regulation of pathogen defence and programmed cell death they are transcriptionally induced by oxidative stress, pathogen attack and application of salicylic acid. Transcriptional regulation: http://www.biomedcentral.com/content/pdf/1471-2229-10-95.pdf cysteine-rich secretory proteins A family of proteins (CRISPs) with 16 conserved cysteine residues. Cysteine-rich secretory protein-1 (CRISP-1, 249aa) is found in the male reproductive tract and may have a role in sperm-egg fusion; CRISP-2 (243aa) is found in testis and epididymis. CRISP-3 (245aa) is found in the salivary gland, pancreas and prostate, also in the specific granules of neutrophils. Some of the other members of the family have LCCL domains (e.g. CRISP-11, 497aa, which promotes matrix assembly). See helothermine, resistin.cysteine string proteins Membrane-associated protein (CSP, DnaJ homolog subfamily C member 5, 198aa), composed of a string of palmitoylated cysteine residues, a linker domain, and an N-terminal J domain characteristic of the DnaJ/Hsp40 co-chaperone family. May regulate calcium-dependent neurotransmitter release at nerve endings. In Drosophila, cysteine string protein (249aa) is also thought to be important in presynaptic function.cystic fibrosis Generalized abnormality of exocrine gland secretion that affects pancreas (blockage of the ducts leads to cyst formation and to a shortage of digestive enzymes), bowel, biliary tree, sweat glands and lungs. The production of abnormal mucus in the lung predisposes to respiratory infection, a major problem in children with the disorder. A fairly common (1 in 2000 live births in caucasians) autosomal recessive disease. See cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR). cystine The amino acid formed by linking two cysteine residues with a disulphide linkage between the two sulphydryl (SH) groups. The analogous compound present within proteins is termed two half cysteines.",

Seemingly obsolete.cytochalasins A group of fungal metabolites that inhibit the addition of G-actin to a nucleation site and therefore perturb labile microfilament arrays. Cytochalasin B from Helminthosporium dematioideum inhibits at around 1 mg/ml but at about 5 mg/ml begins to inhibit glucose transport. Cytochalasin D from Metarrhizium anisopliae is preferable because it only affects the microfilament system.cytochemistry Branch of histochemistry associated with the localization of cellular components by specific staining methods, as for example the localization of acid phosphatases by the Gomori method. Immunocytochemistry involves the use of labelled antibodies as part of the staining procedure.cytochrome b6-f complex A multi-subunit complex that mediates electron transfer between photosystem II (PSII) and photosystem I (PSI cytohesins A family of guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) for ADP-ribosylation factor (ARF) GTPases. Cytohesin-1 (PH, SEC7 and coiledcoil domain-containing protein-1, SEC7 homologue B2-1, 398aa) is ubiquitous, and acts on ARF1 and ARF5. Cytohesin-2 ( ARF nucleotide-binding site opener, ARNO, 400aa) acts on ARF1, ARF3 and ARF6, cytohesin-3 (general receptor of phosphoinositides 1, Grp-1, 400aa) acts on ARF1 and binds the inositol head group of phosphotidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate. Cytohesin-4 (394aa) is found mainly in leucocytes. Cytohesin-interacting protein (359aa) is a scaffolding and modulator protein that binds to cytohesin-1 and modifies the activation of ARF. cytokine receptors Cytokine receptors can be classified into several sub-types: Type I recognize and respond to cytokines with four a-helical strands and are heterodimeric with different cytokine-binding and signalling subunits. The signalling subunits are often shared between receptors for different cytokines. Includes receptors for interleukins 2\u00c07, 9, 11\u00c013, 15, 21, 23 and 27, receptors for erythropoietin, GM-CSF, G-CSF, growth hormone, prolactin, oncostatin M and LIF.
