            "text": "Serving as a spatial information management, analysis and presentation system, geographic information systems (GIS) have been applied in many fields for solving spatial-related problems, where spatial analysis and querying are two major GIS functions used for these applications. In order to describe spatial entities in GIS, two aspects are designed in its data structure: (a) description of single objects based on corresponding object elements and (b) description of spatial relations between objects, for example, whether a car moving on the road X or road Y is a matter for a GIS query. To answer this query, we should know the spatial relations between a point (a car in this example) and a line segment (a road in this example). Another example is that a GIS user may request information about the effects of the distribution of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in his or her home. In these and other possible GIS queries, topological relations between spatial objects perform a fundamental role and thus, have been identified as a major theoretical issue for research. This issue is also essential for GIS-based spatial analyses. Another major area where topological relations are used is quality control, i.e. to check logical consistence between basic elements of GIS including points, linear features and polygons according to a GIS data model applied. For instance, logical consistence www.elsevier.com/locate/jag International Journal of Applied Earth Observation and Geoinformation 9 (2007) 264-275 between digitized spatial features for corresponding objects can be checked automatically after map digitization based on the topological relations among them. Mathematically, there are many different kinds of topologies with point set topology being the most fundamental one. Both algebraic topology and fuzzy topology have been further developed based on the point set topology. The algebraic topology is the theory of assigning a cohomology group and a fundamental group to the manifold, which helps to classify manifolds. This, in turn, can help us to understand spatial relations between objects in the real world by applying the theory of classification of manifolds. The fuzzy topology is a generalization of the ordinary topology by introducing the membership function (Liu and Luo, 1997) . Fuzzy topology can be used to model fuzzy objects which exist in the real world. Overall, the theory of point set topology has been well developed and many of its theories are well known and useful in solving GIS problems. For example, the structure of the interior, boundary and exterior of a set has been studied.",

Some alternative solutions to these problems will be to model these topological relations by using other tools such as an infinite sequence of numbers or matrices.",

Associated with every point of a topological space, there is a fundamental group that expresses the one-dimensional structure of this space surrounding that given point. This fundamental group is the first homotopy group. The idea of fundamental group will be described in terms of nonmathematics as follows. For a given space, pick a point in it and consider all the loops at this point (see Fig. 1 ). Two loops are considered to be of the same class if there is a continuous deformation (i.e. continuous change without breaking) on the space such that one can be deformed to the other without b. In Fig. 1 , with the base point p, loop 1 and loop 2 are of the same class as they can be deformed to a circle, while loop 3 and loop 4 are of the same class as they can be deformed to a point. The set of all classes of the loops with this method of combining them is the fundamental group and denoted by p 1 . Although, in general, the fundamental group depends on the choice of base point, it turns out that, up to isomorphism, this choice makes no difference if the space X is pathconnected (Armstrong, 1983; Bredon, 1993) . Moreover, in surface space, the first fundamental group measures the one-dimensional hole structure of a space. In Fig. 1 , the first fundamental group of space X is hZ, *i as it is a path connected space and has one and only one hole. In other words, if the space has n holes, then the first fundamental group of the space will be hZ n , *i.",
