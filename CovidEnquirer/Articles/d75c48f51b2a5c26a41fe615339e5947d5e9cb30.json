By February 20, 2020, COVID-19 has infected more than 70000 cases and led to more than 2000 deaths [6] . Based [7, 8] . The first COVID-19 patient in Shenzhen was admitted on January 9, 2020, and 416 cases have been confirmed by February 20, 2020 . Most of the confirmed cases were imported cases from Hubei province until now. There was no large-scale transmission and nosocomial infection in Shenzhen city so far. Therefore, the purpose of the study was to analyze the epidemiology and preventive strategies in Shenzhen in order to understand the main transmission route and effective preventive strategies in cities with risk of imported cases, which may provide clue for better preventing outbreak of potential respiratory infectious disease, such as COVID- 19 in cities with heavy population density and high proportion of external population.

Suspected patients would be isolated and observed in single room for each case with special preparation of infection control measures in the hospital. Confirmed patients will be transferred to the Second Affiliated Hospital of South University of Science and Technology (Shenzhen infectious disease hospital) for treatment with negative-pressure ambulance, which was a designated hospital for inpatient management of infectious disease. All medical staff involved in the management of COVID-19 patients implemented infection control procedures, which included work clothes, disposable work caps, disposable gloves, disposable medical protective clothing, medical protective masks or powered air supply filter respirators, protective screens or goggles, work shoes or rubber boots, waterproof boot covers.",

Patients in the same family may be infected by other patients simultaneously or by other family members. 4. The transmission in hospital environment There were reports from Wuhan, Hubei where the pandemic started, infection acquired in hospital environment accounted up to 41.3% of the COVID-19 patients [12]. Subjects infected in hospital environment included medical staff and patients admitted into hospitalized for other reasons. In comparison with those reports from Wuhan, Hubei, there was no infection among medical staff or patients infected in hospital environment in Shenzhen hospitals until February 20. Discussion The pandemic of COVID-19 started in Wuhan, Hubei, China in December 2019 and has spread throughout China and many countries worldwide. Based on the data release from the National Health Commission of People's Republic of China by February 20, 2020, Shenzhen ranked the top cities outside Wuhan with reported 416 confirmed cases. However, the outbreak in Shenzhen was under control so far in a relatively short time with limited cases with regard to its population density. Among the 416 confirmed cases, 87.7% of the COVID-19 patients were imported cases from Hubei or patients contacted with families from Hubei. Only a few of patients were probably caused by community transmission or contact with other people in Shenzhen. Through the data analysis, the implementation of early preventive strategies and measures coincided with peak of daily new confirmed cases and started to decline All rights reserved.

There are about 20 million people living in Shenzhen, of which the external population from the internal area of China, including Hubei province, account for a large proportion. High population density, high proportion of external population and high mobility may increase the possibility of COVID-19 outbreak[7, 8]. In addition, the time around Chinese New Year (January 25) was the peak time period for people to travel from the coastal cities to inland cities or backward. All these factors put Shenzhen into the high risk of outbreak. Through the analysis, it was revealed that majority of the confirmed cases was imported cases from Hubei. Families cluster was another important characteristic of the patients. Subjects in incubation or early stage of illness (with minimal symptoms) who came to Shenzhen and lived together or closely contacted with relatives or friends (such as having dinner together), were important route of infection in Shenzhen. These cases demonstrated the need to reduce gatherings. The early preventive strategies and measures in Shenzhen focused on the early identification and isolation of COVID-19 patients (the main source of infection) and cutting off the route of transmission. For cities with risk of imported cases, population inflow was the most important factor of transmission of infectious diseases. Therefore, screening suspected patients and persons from epidemic areas in city entrances, and isolation according to the incubation period can find possible sources of infection early and prevent the spread of infection diseases, which were also widely used in the prevention of other respiratory infectious diseases, such as influenza in United States and SARS",

History of contact with Hubei patients was defined as those who contacted with COVID-19 patients from Hubei within 14 days before the onset. History of contact with non-Hubei COVID-19 patients was defined as those who contacted with COVID-19 patients from other areas except Hubei within 14 days before the onset. No contact history was defined as those who denied contact with any other COVID-19 patients. Familial clustering was defined as 2 or more patients from the same family.

Other definitions were consistent with previous studies[10, 11]. Analysis of variance or Chi square test were used for the comparison of 3 groups. Statistical analysis was performed in SAS 9.4 (SAS Inc, Cary, NC, USA), and P<0.05 was considered as statistically significant.",
