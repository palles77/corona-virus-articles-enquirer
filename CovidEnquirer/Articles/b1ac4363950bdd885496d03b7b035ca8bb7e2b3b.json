            "text": "Drugs that reverse epigenetic silencing, such as the DNA methyltransferase inhibitor (DNMTi) 5-azacytidine (AZA), have profound effects on transcription and tumor cell survival. AZA is an approved drug for myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemia, and is under investigation for different solid malignant tumors. AZA treatment generates self, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA), transcribed from hypomethylated repetitive elements. Self dsRNA accumulation in DNMTi-treated cells leads to type I IFN production and IFN-stimulated gene expression. Here we report that cell death in response to AZA treatment occurs through the 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase (OAS)-RNase L pathway. OASs are IFN-induced enzymes that synthesize the RNase L activator 2-5A in response to dsRNA. Cells deficient in RNase L or OAS1 to 3 are highly resistant to AZA, as are wild-type cells treated with a small-molecule inhibitor of RNase L. A small-molecule inhibitor of c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinases (JNKs) also antagonizes RNase Ldependent cell death in response to AZA, consistent with a role for JNK in RNase L-induced apoptosis. In contrast, the rates of AZAinduced and RNase L-dependent cell death were increased by transfection of 2-5A, by deficiencies in ADAR1 (which edits and destabilizes dsRNA), PDE12 or AKAP7 (which degrade 2-5A), or by ionizing radiation (which induces IFN-dependent signaling). Finally, OAS1 expression correlates with AZA sensitivity in the NCI-60 set of tumor cell lines, suggesting that the level of OAS1 can be a biomarker for predicting AZA sensitivity of tumor cells. These studies may eventually lead to pharmacologic strategies for regulating the antitumor activity and toxicity of AZA and related drugs.",

Methylation of cytosine residues in CpG islands of DNA results in epigenetic silencing of transcription, while removal of these methyl groups has the opposite effect of promoting transcription (2) . Currently, the DNMTi's 5-azacytidine (AZA) and 5-aza-2\u2032-deoxycytidine (DAC) are approved for myelodysplastic syndromes, and also improve survival in acute myeloid leukemia (3) (4) (5) (6) . In addition, DNMTi's are under investigation for the treatment of various solid tumors, including non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) and breast and colorectal cancer (7, 8) . DNMTi's deplete cellular levels of DNA methyltransferases, leading to DNA hypomethylation and wide-ranging effects on cancer cells (9) (10) (11) (12) . However, there remains a critical need to better understand the molecular mechanisms for the antitumor and cytotoxic effects of DNMTi's, to increase their clinical efficacy while minimizing toxicity.",

DNA demethylation caused by treatment with nanomolar levels of DNMTi's induces the bidirectional transcription of human endogenous retrovirus (ERV)-like genes, leading to the formation of dsRNA, an IFN response, and inhibition of cell proliferation (14, 15) . dsRNA, a common viral pathogen-associated molecular pattern, induces an innate immune response that includes the expression of type I IFN and IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) (14, 15) . Therefore, expression of self dsRNA accounts for the long-known observation that DNMTi's induce ISGs (16) . However, the connection between self dsRNA induction by AZA and tumor cell death induced by DNMTi's is less clear.",

In addition, AZA is being investigated for use against a range of different types of solid tumors, including lung and colorectal cancers. Treatment with AZA causes demethylation of DNA, thus increasing RNA synthesis, including the synthesis of double-stranded RNA, which is otherwise produced in virus-infected cells.

Previously, we reported that CRISPR-mediated knockout of RNase L prevents the lethal effect of ADAR1 deletion in A549 NSCLC cells (28) . ADAR1 converts adenosine to inosine, destabilizing dsRNA and preventing or reducing the activation of OAS and, indirectly, also suppressing RNase L activation. Together, the presence of dsRNA, IFNs, and ISG expression (including OASs) in DNMTi-treated cells and the requirement for RNase L in cell death due to ADAR1 knockout led us to examine whether RNase L contributes to the elimination of cancer cells by DNMTi's. Here we report that cells lacking RNase L or OAS1 to 3 are protected from the cytotoxic effects of AZA. Furthermore, small-molecule inhibitors of either RNase L or c-Jun NH 2 -terminal kinases (JNKs), which have been implicated in RNase L-mediated apoptosis, protected cells from AZA (29) . Conversely, deletion of the 2\u2032-phosphodiesterases (PDEs) that degrade 2-5A (PDE12 and AKAP7) (30, 31) , deletion of ADAR1 that edits and destabilizes dsRNA (28) , or ionizing radiation (IR) that activates IFNdependent signaling (32) each increased the RNase L-dependent cytotoxic effects of AZA. Basal OAS1 expression in the NCI-60 set of human tumor cell lines correlated with AZA sensitivity. These findings suggest potential targets for enhancing the antitumor activity and mitigating the toxicity of AZA.",

While there was no detectable dsRNA in untreated cells, accumulation of dsRNA in the cytoplasm was apparent after AZA treatment. To determine whether RNase L affects AZA sensitivity, we compared parental vector control A549 cells (wild type; WT) with RNase L knockout (KO) cells, previously generated with CRISPR-Cas9 technology (33) (SI Appendix, Fig. S2A ). Cells treated with different amounts of AZA were monitored for survival as a function of time using an IncuCyte real-time cell imaging system (Essen Bioscience) and a dual-dye method. While the majority of WT cells appeared dead after 48 h of AZA treatment, the AZA-treated RNase L KO cells appeared normal ( Fig. 1 A-D) . Quantification of WT cell survival showed that 63 and 77% of the cells had died by 60 h in response to 50 or 100 \u03bcM AZA, respectively (Fig. 1E ). Cell death in WT cells was observed at concentrations of 6 \u03bcM AZA or greater.

Thus, AZA induction of both caspase-3/7 activation and PARP cleavage in WT but not in RNase L KO cells indicates cell death occurred through the proapoptotic activity of RNase L (25, 26, 36) . Death. To further validate the involvement of RNase L in AZAmediated cell death, a potent small-molecule inhibitor of RNase L, valoneic acid dilactone (VAL), was used. Treatment of A549 cells with 10 \u03bcM VAL protected them against the cytotoxic effect of AZA (Fig. 4 A and B) .

Therefore, to increase 2-5A accumulation and RNase L activity during AZA treatment, the genes encoding AKAP7 and PDE12 were knocked out in A549 cells, individually and in combination (Fig. 5A) . Previously, ablation of either AKAP7 or PDE12 increased 2-5A levels by retarding its degradation (31, 37) . Deletion of AKAP7 slightly increased cell-death rates in the presence of AZA, whereas PDE12 knockout had a much larger effect (Fig. 5B) . The DKO for both AKAP7 and PDE12 greatly increased cell death in response to AZA (Fig. 5B) . These results suggest that extending the half-life of 2-5A in cells by depleting or inhibiting 2-5A catabolic enzymes increases sensitivity to AZA. (Fig. 5C ). In contrast, RNase L KO cells were completely resistant to AZA, 2-5A, or the combination of both agents (Fig. 5D) . These results demonstrate that exogenous 2-5A increases the cell-lethal effect of AZA and that the mechanism of action is entirely dependent on RNase L. ADAR1 Knockout Increases the Susceptibility of Cells to AZA. ADAR1 edits adenosine (A) to inosine (I) in dsRNA, which destabilizes dsRNA because A:U base pairs are more stable than I:U mismatches (38) (39) (40) . Our prior study suggested that the accumulation of constitutively produced self dsRNA in ADAR1 KO cells leads to OAS-RNase L activation and cell death (28) . Because the knockout of ADAR1 is lethal in A549 cells, it was necessary to use combination knockout cells for these experiments. To determine whether ADAR1 antagonizes the cell-lethal effect of AZA, A549 cells of different ADAR1, MAVS, and RNase L genotypes were treated with AZA.

However, the combination of AZA and IR significantly increased the cell-death rates in WT cells compared with AZA treatment alone, whereas the RNase L KO cells were resistant to IR and AZA (Fig. 5 I and J) . These results suggest that IR increases RNase L-dependent cell death triggered by AZA treatment.",

In these 60 cell lines, representative of the histologic and genetic diversity of cancer, the expression levels of OAS1 (Fig. 6A) and OASL (Fig. 6B ) predict sensitivity to AZA; that is, the higher the expression levels of these enzymes, the greater the sensitivity of the cells to the lethal effect of AZA.

DNMTi's have long been known to induce an IFN response that is characterized by ISG expression (16) , although the molecular mechanism has only recently been elucidated. Hypomethylation of DNA resulting from DNMTi treatment leads to production of self dsRNA from ERVs, short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs), and other repetitive DNA elements, triggering an innate immune response that resembles the response induced by viral infections, or by ADAR1 KO in the absence of viral infection (14, 15, 28, 42) . dsRNA signals through the MDA5-RIG-I/ MAVS/IRF3-IRF7 pathway to induce type I and III IFNs which, in turn, induce the expression of ISGs, including OAS1 to 3, that mediate most biological effects of these IFNs. For example, DAC was shown to induce an IFN response in colorectal cancerinitiating cells (CICs) through the MDA5/MAVS/IRF7 signaling pathway (14) . Long-term growth of CICs was inhibited following transient treatment with a low dose of DAC. Similarly, the cellular response to DNMTi's (AZA or DAC) was characterized by high expression of ERVs and IFN, which sensitized melanomas to immunotherapy with anti-CTLA-4 (15) .",

The only well-established function of 2-5A is activation of RNase L, an antiviral protein with proapoptotic activity (21, 25, 26, 36) . Here we observe that deletion of RNase L or OAS1 to 3 isoforms renders cells highly resistant to AZA-induced death. These results are in contrast to the consequences of viral infections of cells, in which OAS3 is the dominant OAS isoform, at least in some cell types (33) . In addition to demethylating DNA, AZA treatment leads to RNA demethylation (44) , which increases RNA immune signaling through TLR3 (45) . However, the dependence on the dsRNAactivated OAS-RNase L pathway for AZA-induced cell death suggests that it is DNA demethylation leading to dsRNA, and not RNA demethylation, that is responsible for the cytotoxic response. RNase L causes apoptosis through a ribotoxic stress pathway involving JNKdependent signaling (29) . Consistent with the involvement of RNase L in AZA-induced cell death is the observation that a smallmolecule inhibitor of JNK suppresses apoptosis in response to AZA.",

Very interestingly, many different primary malignant tumors, including those of the head and neck, lung, prostate, breast, and high-grade gliomas, express high levels of OAS expression as part of the IFN-related DNA damage resistance signature (41) .

MAVS deletion reduced but did not prevent cell death by OAS-RNase L in response to AZA treatment, a result similar to our findings in ADAR1 KO cells (28) . Therefore, basal levels of OAS isozymes are sufficient to mediate cell death through RNase L activation ( Fig. 1 and SI Appendix, Table S1 ). Prior studies on mouse hepatitis virus showed that, in mouse bone marrow macrophages, basal levels of OAS are sufficient for RNase L activation (33, 50) . Taken together, these results reveal that IFN does not need to be induced for an antiviral or cell-death response through OAS-RNase L, provided that sufficient basal levels of OAS and RNase L are present. Furthermore, the correlation of basal OAS1 and OASL levels with AZA sensitivity in the NCI-60 tumor cell panel indicates that OAS1 (or OASL) can be a biomarker for AZA sensitivity in cancer.",

Prior studies on the antitumor activities of AZA and DAC showed effects against melanoma through increased immune checkpoint therapy (15) and against colorectal cancer through targeting of colorectal cancer-initiating cells (14) . Also, an earlier study showed that DAC could overcome resistance to IFN-induced apoptosis in renal carcinoma and melanoma (51) . DNMTi treatment of mouse cells with mutant p53 led to massive dsRNA accumulation, originating at least in part from the transcription of repetitive DNA elements, culminating in a cellsuicidal type I IFN response (42) . The transcribed repetitive DNA elements included SINEs, satellite repeats, endogenous IAP retroviral DNA, and noncoding RNA genes (42) . However, A549 and HME cells are p53-wild type (52, 53) , yet both are AZA-sensitive. Fig. 6 . Basal OAS1 and OASL expression correlate with AZA sensitivity among NCI-60 tumor cell lines. Drug sensitivity to AZA is represented as GI 50 , the drug concentration resulting in a 50% growth reduction, quantified by measurement of total RNA at day 6 (raw data were downloaded from the National Cancer Institute Development Therapeutics Program; dtp.nci.nih. gov) (higher GI 50 indicates less sensitivity to drug). GI 50 was correlated with expression of OAS1 (A) and OASL (B) in the cell lines (gene expression values by microarray from the Gene Expression Omnibus database, accession no. GSE5846). Probe sets were 205552_s_at (for OAS1) and 210797_s_at (for OASL). The statistical method is Spearman's ranked correlation coefficient test, calculated using SAS v9 software. The data are the averages \u00b1 SD of three identical replicates. Three biological replicates were performed, each with a minimum of three technical replicates. (H-J) Percent cell survival after IR (10 Gy) for 30 min, followed by AZA treatment in comparison with mock treatments. The data are the averages \u00b1 SD of three identical replicates. Two biological replicates were performed, each with a minimum of three technical replicates. **P < 0.01, ****P < 0.0001. Therefore, AZA sensitivity, and the involvement of RNase L in AZA-induced cell death, is not limited to cells with mutant p53, at least not in the human cell types examined in this study.",

For instance, combining AZA with IR was highly effective in eliminating tumor cells in an RNase L-dependent manner. We also showed that knockout of PDE12 or AKAP7, which impair 2-5A degradation, increased tumor cell killing by AZA. Therefore, treatments that increase RNase L activity directly or indirectly, for instance by inhibiting PDE12 (30, 37) and/or AKAP7 (31) , are predicted to increase the antitumor activities of AZA or DAC. Alternatively, inhibitors of RNase L, such VAL, are expected to mitigate the cytotoxicity of AZA. Therefore, our studies have therapeutic implications for either increasing the efficacy of DNMTi treatment of cancer or mitigating its toxicity.",
