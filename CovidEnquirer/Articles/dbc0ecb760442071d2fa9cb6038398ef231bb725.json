In IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 recipients, demyelination is decreased, but not eliminated, while viral titers are significantly increased when compared to IFN-\u03b3R1 +/+ RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 recipients. IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 CD8 T cells retain virus-specific effector function regardless of IFN-\u03b3R1 expression.

After the initial innate response to a viral infection, effector CD8 T cells traffic to the inflamed CNS, playing a critical role in viral clearance through lytic and non-lytic antiviral mechanisms. However, these mechanisms are tightly regulated in the CNS during infection as well as in the resting state to prevent unnecessary autoimmune destruction of this vital, nonregenerative tissue. Furthermore, mechanisms that protect the CNS from immune-mediated damage may ultimately lead to incomplete viral clearance, persistent CNS infection, and chronic disease. Therefore, the generation of appropriate immune res-ponses to infection results in clearance of virus while protecting the function of host tissues.",

MHV-JHM is a member of the family coronaviridae, which includes pathogens that are responsible for an array of human diseases ranging in pathogenicity from the relatively innocuous common cold to the more damaging severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). Immunocompetent mice infected with an attenuated MHV-JHM variant, J2.2v-1, also develop demyelinating disease (Fleming et al., 1987; Stohlman et al., 1998) . Demyelination, a hallmark of the human disease multiple sclerosis (MS), is characterized by dense infiltration of macrophages into areas of white matter of the CNS, in some instances appearing in direct contact with myelin-stripped axons in MS lesions (Trapp et al., 1998) and in the spinal cord of MHV-JHM-infected mice (Templeton et al., in press ). It has been hypothesized that, in addition to genetic factors which increase susceptibility, environmental factors such as chronic viral infection may play an important role in the etiology of MS (Hemmer et al., 2002) . Studies that examine the pathogenesis of an autoimmune model of MS, experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE), have largely focused on CD4 T cells as mediators of demyelinating disease. However, increasing evidence suggests that CD8 T cells also play an important role in autoimmune myelin destruction (Brisebois et al., 2006; Huseby et al., 2001) . Therefore, CD8 T cells are implicated in both viral clearance and autoimmune destruction of myelin in the CNS.",

However, transfer of splenocytes from MHV-JHM-immunized B6 mice infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice reconstitutes demyelination (Wu et al., 2000) . In this model, development of demyelination is T cell-mediated, as depletion of both populations from the donor splenocyte suspension abrogates disease. Removal of either CD4 or CD8 Tcells from the donor population does not abrogate demyelination, although recipient RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibit distinct clinical courses. Mice receiving CD4 T cells (CD8 depleted) develop more severe encephalitis with little demyelination around 6-7 days post-transfer. After receiving CD8 T cell-enriched (CD4 T cell-depleted) splenocytes, infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice develop extensive demyelination, and display only a mild encephalitis when compared to mice receiving CD4 T cell-enriched splenocytes. CD4 and CD8 T cells mediate demyelination by different mechanisms. When CD8 T cell-enriched splenocytes are isolated from an MHV-JHMimmunized IFN-\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 donor, demyelination is significantly reduced when compared to mice receiving wild type CD8 T cellenriched splenocytes . Transfer of IFN-\u03b3 \u2212/\u2212 CD4 T cell-enriched splenocytes into infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice results in increased demyelination .",

            "text": "IFN-\u03b3 is a pleiotropic antiviral cytokine that is critical for CD8 T cell-mediated clearance of MHV-JHM from oligodendrocytes (Parra et al., 1999) . In addition to activation of antiviral genes in infected and adjacent uninfected CNS cells, IFN-\u03b3 induces MHC expression and the production of chemokines such as the macrophage chemoattractant CCL2 (MCP-1) (Tran et al., 2000) . After recruitment of macrophages by CCL2 and other cytokines/ chemokines, IFN-\u03b3 acts to increase both production of nitric oxide and phagocytic function, (Schroder et al., 2004) which increases the demyelinating potential of these cells. In further support of the connection between IFN-\u03b3-production and demyelination, Huseby et al. (2001) demonstrated that antibody blockade of IFN-\u03b3 in a CD8 T cell-mediated EAE resulted in decreased disease. A recent study of a spontaneous model of CD8 T cellmediated demyelination using mice that constitutively express the T cell costimulatory molecule CD86 in microglia also supports this connection, as IFN-\u03b3R \u2212/\u2212 mice did not develop disease (Brisebois et al., 2006) . Collectively, these results show that IFN-\u03b3 is a central component in both CD8 T cell-mediated viral clearance and demyelination. Previous studies have focused on the requirement for IFN-\u03b3, but not on the target of IFN-\u03b3. Herein, we use MHV-JHM-infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice sufficient or deficient in IFN-\u03b3 receptor expression, to determine the target cell for IFN-\u03b3 expressed by CD8 T cells. Unexpectedly, our results showed that enhanced virus replication with subsequent demyelination occurred in the absence of IFN-\u03b3R expression in recipient mice.",

Donor T cells, but not macrophages and DCs, traffic to the spinal cord in infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 recipient mice J2.2v-1-infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice that receive splenocytes from MHV-JHM immune B6 mice develop demyelination, while demyelination is absent in infected mice that receive splenocytes depleted of CD4 and CD8 T cells (Wu et al., 2000) . Thus, T cells are necessary for induction of demyelination in J2.2v-1-infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. However, since demyelination is characterized by dense infiltration of F4/80 + and CD11c + macrophages/microglia and DCs, it is possible that transferred phagocytic cells play a role in myelin destruction. Therefore, in the absence of an activating factor such as IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness in recipient mice, donor IFN-\u03b3R + phagocytic cells may be able to compensate in the presence of T cells to mediate demyelinating disease. To rule out the presence of donor F4/80 + and CD11c + macrophages as a contributing factor in the diseased spinal cord of chronically infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, we transferred donor splenocytes from MHV-JHM immune mice expressing green fluorescent protein (GFP) (Fig. 1) . At 8 days post-transfer, the spinal cords of infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice exhibited infiltration of GFP + cells, many of which were positive for the T cell markers CD4 and CD8 (Fig. 1A,  B) . However, F4/80 + macrophages were uniformly GFP \u2212 (Fig. 1C, D) . Furthermore, CD11c + cells were also GFP \u2212 , and were clustered in the spinal cord near GFP + cells (Fig. 1E, G) or appeared in a circular, perivascular arrangement (Fig. 1) . Therefore, F4/80 + and CD11c + cells in the MHV-J2.2v-1infected spinal cord were not donor-derived. ",

We examined this possibility by transferring IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 CD8 T cell-enriched (CD4 depleted) splenocytes into J2.2v-1-infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, and analyzed the amount of demyelination and virus levels in the CNS. Our results showed no significant increase in demyelination in infected recipients of IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 compared to wild type CD8 T cell-enriched splenocytes ( Fig. 2A, C, F ). In addition, the recruitment of macrophages to areas of demyelination was equivalent in both groups (Fig. 2D, G) , and the ability of recipient mice to clear virus from the CNS was not significantly altered (Fig. 2B, E, H) . Thus, donor IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness does not significantly contribute to CD8 T cell-mediated demyelination or viral clearance.",

As expected, demyelination was decreased in recipient mice that lacked IFN-\u03b3R1 when compared to IFN-\u03b3R1 sufficient mice Fig. 3 . IFN-\u03b3 recipient responsiveness contributes to CD8 T cell-mediated viral clearance and demyelination with wild type donor cells. Infected IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice receiving CD8-enriched splenocytes i.v. from MHV-JHM-immune B6 mice were sacrificed on days 8-10 post-transfer, and spinal cord sections were stained for demyelination with luxol fast blue (C and F). Immunohistochemical analysis of adjacent sections detected macrophage infiltration (E and H) and viral antigen (F and I), as described in Fig. 2 . Demyelination was slightly decreased in IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 recipient mice (white bar, A, and G) compared to IFN-\u03b3R1 +/+ RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 recipients (black bar, A, and D), although this difference was not statistically significant (p N 0.05).

Data are presented as a summary of two experiments. (Fig. 3A , D, G) while macrophage infiltration remained associated with areas of demyelination in both groups (Fig. 3E, H) . Furthermore, viral titers were higher in recipient mice lacking IFN-\u03b3R1, up to one and a half log pfu/ml higher when compared to infected IFN-\u03b3 responsive RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 3B, F, I) .

To eliminate this potentially complicating factor, we transferred IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 donor CD8 T cell-enriched splenocytes into J2.2v-1-infected IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice or RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice. Similar to mice receiving wild type splenocytes, infected IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice receiving IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 CD8 T cellenriched splenocytes exhibited decreased demyelination and increased virus titers when compared to RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 recipients (Fig. 4A, B) . Furthermore, when the ratio of demyelination to Fig. 2 and depicted in Figs. 2 and 3) . Demyelination was decreased in IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 recipient mice (white bar, A) compared to IFN-\u03b3R1 +/+ RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 recipients (black bar, A), although the difference between recipients was not statistically significant (p N 0.05). The amount of infectious virus in brain homogenates (p b 0.0001) and distribution of virus antigen near areas of demyelination was increased (IFN-\u03b3R1 +/+ , squares, B. IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 , triangles, B). Virus was detected in 8/8 IFN-\u03b3R1 +/+ and 11/11 IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 recipient mice. When the ratio of demyelination to viral titer was compared for each sample, the decrease in demyelination in IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 recipients was magnified (IFN-\u03b3R1 +/+ black bar, IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 white bar, C, p = 0.0425). Data are presented as a summary of three experiments. viral titer is compared between IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 and IFN-\u03b3R1 +/+ recipients of CD8 T cell-enriched IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 splenocytes, the difference between groups is increased (Fig. 4C) . Therefore, IFN-\u03b3 recipient responsiveness contributes to both CD8 T cellmediated demyelination and viral clearance in RAG1-deficient mice.",

IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness does not contribute to viral clearance in the absence of CD8 T cells J2.2-v1-infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice do not develop demyelination despite the presence of high levels of infectious virus in the CNS (Wu and Perlman, 1999) . It is possible that NK cells, which are capable of producing significant amounts of IFN-\u03b3, may contribute to viral clearance in the absence of T cells. To test this possibility, we infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice or IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice with MHV-J2.2v-1 and compared virus titers in the brain at day 4 post-infection. As expected, viral titers were equivalent in both groups (Fig. 5A) , suggesting that viral clearance is not mediated by an IFN-\u03b3-dependent mechanism in the absence of CD8 T cells. Furthermore, no differences were detected in clinical disease or mortality between infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 and IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice (Fig. 5B ). 3.5. Equivalent MHV-JHM-specific CD8 T cell responses in infected IFN-\u03b3R \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 and IFN-\u03b3R1 +/+ RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice Although T cell IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness regulates antigen induced cell death, (Lohman and Welsh, 1998; Refaeli et al., 2002) a recent study demonstrated that IFN-\u03b3 also acts indirectly on other cells as a negative feedback regulator of T cell responses (Feuerer et al., 2006) . Therefore, the ability of antigen-specific T cells to traffic to the CNS, exhibit their effector functions, and survive in situ may be altered in the absence of IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness in recipient cells, thus decreasing both CD8 T cell-mediated macrophage activation and viral clearance. To examine this possibility, we assessed virus-specific CD8 T cell number and function by measuring IFN-\u03b3 production by cells harvested from the infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 CNS after direct ex vivo stimulation with an MHV-JHM-specific CD8 T cell peptide. At days 8-10 post-transfer, equivalent frequencies (Fig. 6A , B) and total numbers (Fig. 6C ) of CD8 T cells were isolated from RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 or IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, regardless of donor responsiveness to IFN-\u03b3. Furthermore, the number of virusspecific CD8 T cells in pre-transfer splenocyte suspensions were comparable in IFN-\u03b3R1 +/+ and IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 donors (data not shown), and were consistent with previously published results (Wu et al., 2000) . Based on these results, we conclude that decreased demyelination and increased viral titers are not a result of decreased virus-specific CD8 T cell responses in J2.2v-1infected IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice.",

Direct recruitment and activation of macrophages/microglia in the spinal cord of MHV-JHM-infected mice are sufficient to induce demyelination in the absence of T or B cells, since myelin destruction is detected in RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice infected with a recombinant MHV-JHM that expresses the macrophage chemokine CCL2 (MCP-1) (Kim and Perlman, 2005) . In wild type mice, IFN-\u03b3-mediated activation and recruitment of macrophages and microglia to sites of viral infection may also occur indirectly through other resident CNS cells.

This result is consistent with previous studies which demonstrated IFN-\u03b3 and IFN-\u03b3 responsiveness are critical for MHV-JHM clearance from myelin-producing oligodendrocytes of the CNS (Gonzalez et al., 2006; Parra et al., 1999) . The observation that IFN-\u03b3R1 deficiency in infected RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 recipient mice does not decrease demyelination as extensively as IFN-\u03b3 deficiency in transferred CD8 T cells may be explained by enhanced virus replication in the first group . Further, IFN-\u03b3 deficiency is limited to the donor population in CD8 T cell-enriched splenocyte transfers. Other non-T cells present in RAG1-deficient mice are capable of producing IFN-\u03b3, (Schroder et al., 2004) and thus may contribute to viral clearance in the absence of CD8 T cell IFN-\u03b3 production. In IFN-\u03b3R1 \u2212/\u2212 RAG1 \u2212/\u2212 mice, however, this alternative mechanism is not possible, as the effects of IFN-\u03b3 on any host cell type are eliminated, regardless of the source of IFN-\u03b3. Thus, diminished virus clearance may result in substantial demyelination even in the absence of IFN-\u03b3R1. The primary mechanism for virus clearance from myelin-producing cells is IFN-\u03b3-mediated and our results suggest that IFN-\u03b3R1 expression in infected recipient mice is likely more critical for CD8 T cell-mediated viral clearance than for CD8 T cell-mediated demyelination.",
