During recent years, most of these programmes have been developed in the field of antimicrobial resistance and nosocomial infections, but efforts have also been made in other areas. Recent experiences of emerging microbial threats, including severe acute respiratory syndrome and new influenza variants affecting humans, the re-emergence of infectious disease problems and the possibility of bioterrorism have evidenced the need for implementation of infectious disease surveillance programmes. Clinical microbiology laboratories play a pivotal role in these programmes. They have the first opportunity to detect these problems and should participate in the design of reporting strategies and dissemination of this information. Policies for the flow of data to national and international authorities should be established using passive surveillance strategies. However, active surveillance programmes taking advantage of new methodologies, including virtual tools and mathematical programs, should be the goal for early detection of unusual patterns of microbial pathogens, outbreaks and healthcare-associated infections. In addition, early implementation of response strategies should be designed and performed with the cooperation of microbiology laboratories, and intervention and response protocols should be defined with the participation of clinical microbiologists.

            "text": "In the last decade, new organisational models for microbiology laboratories have emerged, due to drastic changes in healthcare systems and the emergence of microbial threats in infectious diseases. The former have been deeply analysed [11] and are related to changes in patient demographics, technical developments and changes in the workforce. In addition, the objective of healthcare cost containment has had a drastic influence on this situation [12, 13] . As a result, most microbiology laboratories have changed their organisational structures or may be required to do so in the near future. Externalisation of the microbiology assistance in central laboratories belonging to the private sector has been accomplished in some countries [14] . Also, consolidation is an attractive way for microbiology laboratory survival [14] . In some cases, routine microbiology processes such as serology or urine screening are concentrated in a core laboratory, which can provide a rapid-response at a low cost. Most of these core laboratories have emerged from biochemistry and haematology laboratories, due to the necessity of incorporating automatable processes in a rapid-response and cost-effective structure. Redundant instruments capable of multiple analyses are eliminated, and those remaining are concentrated in a core laboratory. Nowadays, core laboratories, including microbiology and immunology processes, have a horizontal organisational model (Fig. 1 ). Theoretically, with this organisation, microbiology processes are under the supervision of senior clinical microbiologists. An inherent advantage is that nonrepetitive microbiology techniques can be developed in specific microbiology laboratories. This may consolidate microbiology laboratories. They can improve techniques in the field, including molecular techniques, implementing traditional microbiology-based techniques, and restoring the consultation role of the clinical microbiologist [13] . This has led to the active participation of microbiologists in nosocomial It is worth noting that organisational models of microbiology laboratories may drastically affect infectious disease surveillance. The emergence of West Nile viruses in the USA has shown the need for the maintenance and revitalisation of microbiology laboratories [14] . The experience gained with emerging viral infections, including Ebola and influenza A viruses, and particularly with SARS, has revealed that microbiology laboratories might act as sentinels of emerging infectious disease threats [16] . Rapid alert to outbreak situations may be accelerated with microbiology laboratories integrated into national and supra-national global surveillance programmes. Open cooperation with international networks has been essential for the design of control strategies. In addition, the application of new molecular diagnostic techniques and the involvement of basic research microbiology laboratories have been effective in resolving new microbiological threats (e.g., the SARS experience).",

They are frequently promoted to improve data quality and efficiency of collection, but they are essential for outbreak detection. In this sense, the availability of internet access permits rapid feedback and even interactive interventions for the exchange of interpretation and action plans. In the Pennsylvania experience, which covered a large population area [20] , several laboratories implemented their computing systems and connected them to the regional healthcare electronic information system. Automatic reporting was found to be more effective than the conventional system, reducing the time needed for a paper-based report (median, 5 days), to a median of 1 day for an electronic report. Similar systems have now been developed in some European countries [22] . Features include the use of a flexible algorithm for daily analysis of data and presentation of signals on the internet for interpretation by health professionals. These systems are designed to complement, but not replace, conventional methods, as they receive reports from sources other than laboratories (e.g., clinician-based surveillance of notifiable diseases). Electronic \u2044 laboratory-based surveillance will allow early implementation of response and control strategies. Moreover, electronic reporting is highly sensitive and specific, with a low rate of false-positive and false-negative results.",
