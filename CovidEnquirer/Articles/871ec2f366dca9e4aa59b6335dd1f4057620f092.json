While in developed countries, sanitation coverage is almost 99% as a result of a clear commitment of governments to provide it as part of the public services, in developing ones it is only around 50% (WHO-UNICEF, 2006 ). In addition, in the developed countries, the term sanitation applies not only to the installation of sewers but also to the full implementation of systems for the safe disposal and reuse of treated wastewater, sludge, and septage. In contrast, in developing countries, the term sanitation mostly applies to the use of sewers not always ending in treatment plants. In fact, reported sanitation figures frequently do not reveal the disposal of wastewater or excreta uncontrolled into the environment, the existence of malfunctioning wastewater treatment plants, or the use of rudimentary and inefficient basic sanitation facilities sometimes contributing to increased environmental pollution rather than to control it. As a result, waterborne diseases affect millions of people in the developing world, and the water quality of surface and groundwater bodies is increasingly deteriorating. The aim of this chapter is to assist the process of increasing sanitation in low-income regions by contrasting the differences in needs and solutions' options with high-income regions. Most technical publications have traditionally grouped developing countries together as low-income societies without considering that in them there are high-and low-income areas and that among the latter ones there are several factors that create differences that need to be taken into consideration to provide suitable solutions, that rarely fall under the logic used in developed countries to provide sanitation. Most people lacking sanitation include the millions of poor people ( Figure 1 ) living under precarious institutional conditions and under an economical and social situation that avoids the use of conventional solutions. This renders the provision of sanitation in low-income areas a major challenge.",

As sanitation is a broken subject in developing countries, the story of these three is also the same. When mankind was nomadic and lived in very small communities, sanitation was not an issue. Nature could absorb human wastes. Later, when villages grew, there was the need to set up special practices and facilities. In ancient Egypt (B3000 BC), each household had the responsibility to dispose of their garbage and excreta at the communal dump, in irrigation canals, or in open fields. Irrigation canals were the first drainage and waste disposal systems. At that time, toilets were a luxury that only the wealthier people could afford in cities. Toilets were carved of limestone, and the used water was disposed of into pits in the streets (MSU, 2009) . Flushing toilets -some of them communal -existed in India since the twenty-sixth century BC. Reports on the use of toilets and other safe sanitation practices in ancient civilizations from Asia, Latin America, and Africa were common in places where nowadays lack of sanitation is a problem.",

It is useful in identifying conventional and nonconventional sources of pollution, in particular those that are specific to developing countries. It is important to understand the difference in order to be able to apply proper solutions to sanitation that go beyond the simplistic approach of merely installing wastewater treatment plants. A similar analysis could be made for rural areas. The urban water cycle is important because of the large increase in urban population that is being experienced worldwide. By 2030, the urban proportion of the global population is expected to be around 60%. Over the next 50 years, in developing countries, most of the population growth will occur in urban and periurban areas. Furthermore, most of the 19 cities with the most rapid growth are located in chronically water-short regions in the developing world (UN-Habitat, 2006) . Providing water sources to urban areas from the developing world is a challenge because nearly one-third of the population (31.2% compared to a 6% in developed countries in 2001) are poor people living in slum areas. The slum growth rate is of 2.37%, a value significantly higher than the average world urban growth rate of 1.78%.",

When not treated, the main environmental concerns relate to conventional pollutants, such as biological, biodegradable, and nonbiodegradable organic matter, and heavy metals, in that order of importance. The content of almost all these of pollutants is similar around the world, tending to be more concentrated in arid and semiarid areas because of lack of water. In some cases, higher concentrations of pollutants result from increased industrialization of cities. Unfortunately, even when treated, municipal discharges introduce used water containing used compounds, some of which are pollutants, to water bodies. Municipal wastewater is never treated to recover its original quality (the one it had at the water source) as the selfcleansing and dilution capability of nature is used to complete the task. This is confirmed by the increasing amount of trace pollutants, such as endocrine disrupters, found in water sources. The presence of these compounds might be considered as an indicator that we have surpassed the natural depollution capability of the environment. Despite this, the idea of using water bodies or soil to depollute wastewater is still very common, and it could be reduced in water bodies as the depollution capability is lost as result of the water temperature increase due to climate change. In developing countries, the environment is frequently used to depollute wastewater, included when not treated at all, explaining the low quality of water bodies and the widespread presence of diarrheic diseases.",

There are more than 150 types of enteric viruses capable of producing infections or illnesses that multiply in the intestine and are expelled in feces. Unlike bacteria, pathogenic viruses are found in wastewater and feces when people are infected, independently of whether they display symptoms. In regions where viral diseases are endemic, they are constantly isolated from wastewater. The presence of viruses and their concentration in wastewater is linked to the season of the year and the age distribution of the population. Concentrations are usually higher during summer and lower in the autumn months. The composition, type, and especially the content of viruses contained in wastewater are poorly known, particularly in developing countries, as a result of the complex and costly analytical techniques required to identify them (Jim\u00e9nez, 2003) . The enteric viruses most relevant to man are enteroviruses (polio, echo, and coxsackie viruses), Norwalk, rotaviruses, reoviruses, caliciviruses, adenoviruses, and hepatitis A viruses. Rotaviruses are responsible for between 0.5 and 1 billion cases of diarrhea per year in children under 5 years of age in Africa, Asia, and Latin America and up to 3.5 million deaths. Usually, between 50% and 60% of the cases of children with gastroenteritis that are hospitalized are caused by rotaviruses. Reoviruses and adenoviruses are the main causes of respiratory illness, gastroenteritis, and eye infections and have been isolated from wastewater. To date, there is no evidence that the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) causing the acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) can be transmitted via a waterborne route. It is recognized that low virus levels may cause infection or illness; wastewater contains thousands of them, some of which are much more resistant to chlorine disinfection than bacteria (Jim\u00e9nez, 2003) . Viruses discharged in polluted water can migrate long distances in soil and groundwater. The reported horizontal migration varies between 3 and 400 m, while vertical migration ranges from 0.5 to 70 m depending on soil conditions. ",

However, it is becoming increasingly evident that they are not useful to simulate the behavior of all enteric viruses, protozoa -in particular with regard to Giardia and Amoeba -and helminth eggs that are of concern in low-income regions. Despite this, it is frequently, but wrongly, assumed that fecal coliforms are indicators of all kinds of biological pollution. Even though they can be useful indicators of fecal pollution in developed countries' drinking water, this is not always the case for water and wastewater from developing ones, owing to the presence of a wider variety and larger quantities of microorganisms (Jim\u00e9nez, 2009 ). This does not mean that fecal coliforms are not useful for developing countries; it simply means that care must be taken to select additional indicators for specific purposes, such as for wastewater and sludge reuse in agriculture and aquaculture. In these cases, the helminth egg content (WHO, 2006) needs also to be specified. It is worth mentioning that the treatment procedures to inactivate helminth eggs are frequently developed using Ascaris eggs as models as they have been informally considered as indicators for all helminth eggs, although this has not been fully proven experimentally. In other cases, Taenia saginata or Ascaris galli, types of eggs that are rarely present in wastewater, are used to test treatment procedures.",

The first consists of separating helminth ova from the other particles contained in wastewater or sludge (where there are many) and then identifying and counting different genera using a microscope. Some examples of these techniques used the US-EPA (United States-Environment Protection Agency), the membrane filter, the Leeds I and Leeds II, and the Faust techniques. The most widely used technique seems to be the US-EPA (1992) . A comparison of the performances of the above-mentioned methods has been made by Maya et al. (2006) . The recovery rate among them varies from 20% to 80%. Sensitivity for each notably varies as well and not all are capable of measuring the criteria values set by WHO (2006) of 1 egg l \u00c01 for wastewater and 1 egg g \u00c01 TS for sludge.",

They are based on measuring either the total suspended solids (TSS) content or the particle size distribution (PSD), and then correlating the concentration to the helminth egg content. Calibration curves need to be established for each type of wastewater and treatment process. Nevertheless, it is a worthwhile method because the helminth egg determination costs US$7-12 if TSS are used, and US$3 with the PSD, instead of US$70, which is the cost of direct methods. It is important to distinguish between fertile viable and nonfertile eggs as only the viable eggs are infectious.

In addition, it should be remembered that, for humans, water is not the only source of risk, as food and air are also sources of pollutant ingestion and, in some cases, they may be the main ones. In terms of the differences of biological risks to humans in developing and developed countries, there are additional aspects to consider as humans develop immunity to pathogens depending on the type of environment they are exposed to, and thus infectious doses may be higher.

For basic sanitation -sanitation provided in rural or poor periurban areas, the term sanitation includes a wide variety of on-site sanitation options going from simple pit to highly comfortable package treatment plants, which may or may not be functioning. To overcome this, the Joint Monitoring Programme (JMP) from WHO-UNICEF proposed in 2000 to introduce the term 'improved sanitation' . Improved sanitation is a system in which excreta are disposed of in such a way that the risk of fecal-oral transmission to users and to the environment is reduced (WHO-UNICEF, 2008).

In these, sewers of reduced size result in a lower capital cost (around 30%) due to the smaller diameter and length of the used pipelines. In addition, they offer the following benefits (Lenghton et al., 2005; Correlje and Schuetze, 2008) : (1) they allow investments to be made stepwise, in line with available funds, local development, and population growth; (2) they are used in smaller areas of service that are easier to manage; (3) they allow the use of different technologies to provide services to different socioeconomic groups; and (4) they facilitate the reuse of water on-site. Nevertheless, all these advantages need to be assessed in practice, as they cannot be taken for granted universally. As for many water utilities, decentralized systems represent a higher number of systems to manage, which is difficult and complex; to overcome this limitation, centralized management of decentralized systems is recommended. This way it is possible to ensure high performance and reliable operation, reduce costs, and also ensure the need for specialized operators (Hughes et al., 2006) .",

They are built where a constant water supply is available and are used to partially treat domestic wastewater and to digest the settled sludge. They remove around 50% of the organic matter and suspended solid content in 2-4 days. For sludge digestion, 0.5-1 year is required; during this time, sludge is mineralized and its volume is reduced. Septic tanks are made up of a series of communicating chambers. They must be water sealed to avoid underground infiltration and are built using bricks, mortar, or concrete. A variation of the septic tank is the Imhoff tank, having the advantage of a shape that allows the removal of suspended solids and the control of foul odors in a better manner. Septic tanks need to be periodically cleaned (1-2 times per year, leaving 20% of the mature sludge as inoculum for digestion). This represents an additional cost that cannot always be afforded by poor people. Septage (the slurry taken out of septic tanks) is sent to wastewater treatment plants or treated separately. To treat septage, lime is frequently added until a pH of 12 is reached, over a period of 30 min (Jim\u00e9nez and Wang, 2006) . Effluents from septic tanks are discharged into trenches for subsoil infiltration or diverted to the sewerage system (when available).

They are constructed with two vaults or chambers. When the first vault is full, the pedestal is moved over to the second vault, and the first hole is closed. When the second vault is full, the first vault is emptied and so on. The urine is diverted to a soakaway. In comparison to VIP latrines, they have a lower cost associated with emptying the pits (Snyman, 2008) . Urine is collected in small cans (10-20 l) and can be used to enrich the soil after a stabilization period of 30 days. Feces are treated using an aerobic composting process. To control odors and to assist in the mineralization of feces, materials, such as ashes or pieces of wood, are used daily to raise the pH. The pathogens in fecal matter are inactivated over time through the drying process so they can be safely removed by the owner at no cost to the municipality. Once the sludge is digested, disinfected, and removed, it is used as fertilizer. UD toilets are seen as a viable option for rural applications. The main reasons are that they are cost-effective and, since the rural community is accustomed to the use of manure, the UD toilet is socially acceptable. However, its use in periurban areas is more problematic. The emptying of the vaults requires large-scale programs for which small businesses can contribute to the emptying of tanks (from UD or VIPs) either manually, using appropriate safety equipment, or by the use of a tanker. The disposal of the fecal matter in periurban areas is challenging due to the lack of land. If space allows, fecal sludge is buried on-site. Where this is not feasible, the sludge is blended into the waterborne system. This frequently leads to the complete overloading of the wastewater treatment plant (Snyman, 2008) . There are several options of composting toilets (see section titled 'Relevant websites').",

            "text": "Pour-flush toilets have been developed based on traditional flush toilets, which rely upon a water seal to perform cleansing and to control odors and insect infestations. The system works via a manual flush, where 2-3 l of water are poured into the toilet. The water, urine, and excreta are collected in an anaerobic chamber, which works similarly to a septic tank. The chamber needs to be periodically emptied and the partially treated wastewater needs to be disposed of, normally to land (Hughes et al., 2006) . In the context of water-scarce areas, a very interesting option is combining graywater reuse with basic sanitation using pour-flush toilets. This concept was developed by United Nations International Children's Emergency fund (UNICEF) on a system called the Wise Water Management scheme (Godfrey et al., 2007) . This system was conceived to provide both water supply and sanitation services for water-scarce areas and can be used for both rural and lowincome urban areas. It was conceived in Madhya Pradesh, India, a densely populated and poor area. The WWMS uses groundwater as the primary source of water and also includes rainwater harvesting, used to dilute groundwater when polluted with fluoride to reduce its content for human consumption ( Figure 10) . First-use water is employed for cooking, handwashing, and bathing. Water from these two activities is recovered and properly treated in a sand filter to be used for toilet flushing and kitchen garden irrigation. The graywater reuse system can be installed independently of the rainwater harvesting system. By matching water demands, in quantity and quality, to different conventional and nonconventional water sources, the WWMS increases water availability by nearly 60%. Sanitation using low-consumption reused water flush toilets has proven sustainable under the prevailing local conditions and has eradicated open defecation.",

Investment costs are linked to the type of sanitation system selected, the construction materials, and labor. Frequently, to reduce costs, cheap materials and the users are employed to build the facilities. However, this may result in failures, as cheap material frequently means low quality and the users are not people experienced enough, even if trained. It is thus preferable to invest in good and durable material and to use experienced workers. In India, for instance, sanitation programs using professional well-trained masons are being implemented in which the same masons for whom sanitation is a source of income become at the same time sanitation promoters. Norms and institutional capacity to provide basic sanitation constitute another weak link in the complex chain needed to implement and provide services. How to build institutions, policies, and human resources to provide successful sanitation services is better known in high-income countries than in developing ones. Each country/region needs to look for the proper way to solve their problems. Finally, concerning basic sanitation, it needs to be considered that in several places, providing basic sanitation means to change open defecation habits and to handle domestic solid wastes (Box 6). It means as well to properly dispose of the toilet paper.",

Investment, construction, or installation costs vary significantly and depend on the specific system and design.

Due to the large size of the storage and composting chambers, these toilets require a large space underneath; if this is not possible, then they need to be regularly emptied and feces need to be transported to treatment facilities.

The criteria to select an extraction method -a task that is never pleasant -depend on (1) the TS content and (2) the funds available. Sludges with less than B2% TS, such as those produced in septic tanks, can be pumped; but, for the rest of facilities producing all sludge with 10% TS, pits need to be emptied using cesspit trucks or manually by laborers (Kon\u00e9, 2010) . Even though when mechanically emptied and water is used for toilet cleansing, 20-50% of the contents in the lower pit part need to be manually emptied to extract the thicker sludge. The use of mechanical equipment allows carrying away the sludge several kilometers for disposal on controlled sites or on treatment facilities, but this is often expensive and needs proper equipment and skilled laborers. In contrast, when sludge is manually emptied, this is deposited in nearby lanes or on open spaces representing a source of risk. According to Kon\u00e9 (2010) 30-50% of the on-site sanitation facilities from West African countries are emptied manually. In addition, in almost every developing country, fecal sludge collection and haulage are conducted by private entrepreneurs. However, their important role and responsibilities as key stakeholders are not yet fully recognized and legalized (Kon\u00e9, 2010 In many low-income areas, the sanitation problem begins with the lack of sewerage. One option is to build sewers of small extent coupled with on-site sanitation systems. Sewers carry the treated effluent to disposal (usually to soil for infiltration, to irrigation canals, or into water receptors), to wastewater treatment plants, and/or to reuse sites located within a short distance. As these sewers frequently convey partially treated wastewater (such as septic tank effluents), they are designed for self-cleaning using a high wastewater velocity and/or a steep slope. This option is applicable for rural areas or urban ones where adequate land is available.",

Small sewers are built to reduce the infrastructure and maintenance costs, as well to allow high operational flexibility. Inspection chambers such as manholes are replaced by inspection cleanout. The life expectancy of such sewers is in the order of 20 years rather than the 30 years quoted for conventional sewers. Such sewers are short and shallow (Hughes et al., 2006) . One example of simplified sewers are condominial ones in which pipelines are laid through housing lots instead of on the side street, in a way that allows isolated and stepwise construction (UNEP, 2002) . Condominial sewers were developed in the 1980s in Brazil with the aim of extending sanitation services to low-income communities. This technology has now become a standard sanitation solution for some urban areas in Brazil, irrespective of income levels. Condominial sewers reduce the per capita costs of service by replacing the traditional model of individual household connections to a public sewer with a model in which household waste is discharged into branch sewers, and eventually into a public sewer through a group (or block) connection (Watson, 1999 cited in Lenghton et al., 2005 .",

Sewers in tropical areas produce a high amount of sediments to be disposed off, which turns out to be a peculiar and difficult-to-solve problem not frequently commented upon in specialized literature but that needs proper methods to extract sludge and handle it. In addition, when conveyed in sewerage systems, stormwater must be treated in treatment plants at the same time as wastewater; but, if transported separately, it can be discharged to surface water or into wells for groundwater infiltration receiving treatment in soil. In this case, it must be kept in mind that stormwater quantity and quality are determined by rainfall, catchment processes, and human activities, which cause its flow and composition to vary in space and time. Normally, for the first rains of the year, stormwater has higher suspended solids, heavy metal content, and bacterial numbers than nontreated wastewater, and lower dissolved solids, nutrients, and oxygen demand than secondary-treated sewage effluent.",

Although it cannot be considered a caveat for all the negative impacts produced by wastewater, it is still a very important option, and, in many cases, the only one. There are several steps to treat wastewater. The primary step basically serves to remove easily decantable and floating solids. The secondary one, generally a biological process, is used to remove biodegradable (mostly) dissolved suspended material. The tertiary step is used to refine the quality of the effluent produced by a secondary treatment. It may have different purposes, most commonly being the removal of nutrients (N and P). As the treatment steps were conceived following treatment needs, in practice, they are usually implemented in separate tanks or in well-defined sections of wastewater treatment facilities; however, it is possible to use compact processes eliminating physical separation among steps and thus reducing costs (Jim\u00e9nez, 2003) . Wastewater treatment plants are not common facilities in low-income countries. In contrast to developed countries, in developing ones, the sanitation figure (50% according to WHO-UNICEF (2006) ) does not include the treatment of wastewater, which barely reaches 15% (US-EPA, 1992). Moreover, when available, the treatment merely consists of a primary step or including eventually a secondary step that is not always properly functioning. In many developing countries, the main issue concerning treatment is still the proper disposal of feces, particularly in low-income urban or rural areas. This, combined with a high content of pathogens in wastewater, sludge, or fecal sludge, implies the need to properly select the treatment process in order to effectively control disease dissemination. In general, coupling any kind of secondary wastewater treatment process (biological or physico-chemical) with a filtration step before disinfection will considerably reduce the pathogen content. However, this is rarely feasible for economic reasons and therefore it is sensible to consider the use of other technologies alone or combined with other type of intervention methods to build up a multiple barrier system to control wastewater risks (Jim\u00e9nez, 2009b) . In the following sections, guidance will be provided to support the selection for treatment options, based on the type of pollutants.",

Table 9 differs from the one presented by WHO (2006) in showing the removal efficiency data for helminth eggs in terms of a percentage instead of log removal. This is because helminths eggs' content is by far much lower and log units are meaningless. For developing countries, the removal of protozoa and helminths eggs is the main concern, considering their content and the occurrence of diseases caused by these types of agents. To remove protozoa, filtration is a good treatment option.

WSPs are capable of removing organic matter with efficiencies similar to the activated sludge process and all kind of pathogens. They are easy to design and operate but require long retention times (several weeks). WSP systems comprised several ponds connected in series. Lagoons are made through the shallow excavation of around 1-2 m, and they are frequently unlined to reduce investment costs. After a period of time, soil percolation and sedimentation form an impermeable barrier. If the water table is very high at the site, ponds need to be impermeable from the beginning. WSPs remove up to 6 bacteria log, up to 5 viruses log, and almost all the protozoa and helminth ova. To control Cryptosporidium spp., almost 38 days' retention time is needed . In developing countries with wet warm climates, the use of stabilization ponds is recommended if land is available at a reasonable price. For arid and semiarid regions, high evaporation rates limit their application as there is a net loss of water of 20-25% due to evaporation. This, in addition, increases the salinity of the effluent limiting its use for agricultural irrigation . Sludge production in ponds is low but if extracted it needs disinfection as helminth ova remain viable in ponds for more than 9 years (Nelson et al., 2004) . WSPs can be coupled with aquaculture systems that are shallow ponds or wetlands where fish, duckweed, or aquatic vegetables are produced as is frequently done in Indonesia, China, and Thailand. Ponds can be used to produce only one crop such as duckweed that is used as food for the next pond where grass carp are grown. Different species can also be cultured in the same pond, as happens in nature. To operate the system, wastewater is applied to ponds at the required rate (estimated in terms of the organic load applied per hectare of ponds per unit time), and the organic matter and the nutrients contained serve as food for plant and animal production (Hughes et al., 2006) . In order to avoid health problems, wastewater needs to be previously disinfected according to WHO guidelines (2006) .",

Nutrients are also removed by plant uptake and pathogens by competition and sun UV-light inactivation (Jim\u00e9nez, 2003) . Wetlands are shallow ponds where aquatic macrophytes are planted in soil, sand, or gravel. There are three main types: surface-flow, horizontal-flow subsurface, and vertical-flow systems. Juncus spp. or Phragmites are commonly used plants but any local plant can be employed. Construction requires expertise and skilled labor. Once installed, operation is relatively easy. Wetlands remove nitrogen, phosphorus, and heavy metals. Up to 90-98% of thermo-tolerant coliforms, 67-84% of MS2 coliphages, and 60-100% of protozoa are inactivated or removed using hydraulic retention times of 4-5 days. In practice, pathogen removal is highly variable and depends on climate, type of wetland, and the kind of plant used. To completely remove helminth ova, it is necessary to couple wetlands with filtration, otherwise effluent with variable content may be produced. Breeding of mosquitoes and unpleasant odors can be a problem if wetlands are not operated correctly. Subsurface wetlands are used to avoid mosquito breeding (Correlje and Schuetze, 2008) .",

There are several types of land treatment options in specialized literature that can be consulted. For efficient functioning, hydraulic loads (29-111 m 3 m \u00c02 yr \u00c01 ) and mass loads should be limited. To avoid aquifer pollution, application of wastewater (preferably partially treated) is restricted to sites where groundwater is a minimum of 3 m in depth. Applied as primary or secondary treatment, land treatment produces a consistently high-quality effluent (TSS o1 mg l \u00c01 , organic carbon 3 mg l \u00c01 , and total nitrogen 6 mg l \u00c01 , with a phosphorus removal of almost 50% with minimal pre-treatment).

UASBs are considered as the most successful anaerobic process applied to treat wastewater due to low hydraulic retention time compared to other anaerobic processes thanks to the high density of biomass attained in the blanket (Campos, 1999) . The reactor is designed to not only produce the biological reaction but also to sediment and filter suspended solids from wastewater. In addition, sludge retained in the bottom part of the reactor is anaerobically digested (Campos, 1999) . The UASB produces better results when the wastewater has a high organic matter content. As by-products, it produces methane and partially treated sludge. The gas can be used as a source of energy, while the sludge remaining, after proper treatment to control the pathogen content, can be used to fertilize soil. UASBs remove 65-75% of BOD and COD and helminth eggs through filtration in the sludge blanket and through sedimentation. However, their efficiency with regard to the removal of helminth eggs is very variable. From wastewater containing 64-320 eggs l \u00c01 , they produce effluents with 1-45 eggs l \u00c01 (60-96% removal). Therefore, UASBs are frequently coupled with other treatment process such as stabilization ponds or filtration to completely and reliable remove helminth ova and to inactivate other pathogens. Several stand-alone UASB plants or those coupled with WSP are currently under operation in Curitiba, Brazil. UASB reactors require careful design and operation to avoid bypasses (Campos, 1999 ). The construction, operation, and maintenance of improved anaerobic technology such as biogas installations require considerable expertise and skilled labor as well as space (Correlje and Schuetze, 2008) . UASB reactors have a low capacity for tolerating toxic loads, need several weeks to start up the process, and require a post-treatment step.",

Both sedimentation and aeration play an important role in this. Sedimentation eliminates heavy and large pathogens, while aeration promotes antagonistic reactions between different microorganisms, causing their elimination. As a result of becoming entrapped within the flocs (which are subsequently sedimented), there is fairly good removal of small nonsedimentable microorganisms, such as Giardia spp. and Cryptosporidium spp., which remain concentrated within the sludge (Jim\u00e9nez, 2003) . Helminths eggs are also removed, but due to continuous difficulties in achieving efficient and reliable sedimentation of suspended solids in secondary decanters, protozoan and helminths eggs may be found in effluents along with flocs. For an initial helminths egg content of 20-120 eggs l \u00c01 , effluents with 3-10 eggs l \u00c01 are produced .",

The introduction of new chemical products, in particular flocculants, combined with the possible reuse of treated effluent for agricultural irrigation and ocean disposal, has been instrumental in its reintroduction. Coagulation-flocculation removes helminths eggs while preserving nutrients and organic matter in contents suitable to grow plants. When this process is applied using low coagulant doses combined with a high molecular weight and high charge density flocculants, it is called chemical enhanced primary treatment (CEPT). If, a high-rate settler is used instead of a conventional settler, it is referred to as advanced primary treatment (APT). As a result, CEPT has a total hydraulic retention time of 4-6 h while, for APT, this is only 0.5-1 h. Among the coagulants that have been used, iron and alum compounds are the most common. APT removes 50-80% of protozoan cysts (Giardia, Entamoeba coli, and E. histolytica) and 90-99% of helminths eggs. From a content of up to 120 eggs l \u00c01 , an APT can consistently produce an effluent containing 0.5-2 eggs l \u00c01 . This process produces an effluent with a low content of suspended solids or turbidity, which leads to greater disinfection efficiency, either with chlorine or with UV light. Likewise, the process allows the use of sprinkler irrigation in high-tech countries or countries where water is scarce. The effluent quality is improved by the soil effect, and aquifers can be used as water supply storage (Jim\u00e9nez, 2003 .",

It is effective for the inactivation of bacteria, less so for viruses and protozoa, and not at all for helminth eggs. With regard to virus and bacteria, chlorine has inactivation efficiencies of up to 5-7 log. However, chlorine is a very reactive agent and, therefore, before attacking microorganisms, it reacts with many substances contained in wastewater, in particular with organic matter, hydrogen sulfide, manganese, iron, nitrites, and ammonia. As a result, chlorination is a process that, in order to be efficient, needs to be applied at the end of treatment schemes to avoid interferences. If, in treated wastewater, ammoniacal nitrogen and organic matter are still presented, chloramines and organo-chlorinated compounds are formed. These are compounds that increase cancer risks. Notwithstanding such risks, it is always preferable to chlorinate wastewater as microbial diseases have faster and often more dramatic health effects (Jim\u00e9nez, 2003) . 2. Ozonation. Ozone is very effective at inactivating viruses and bacteria. It inactivates 3-4 log concentration units in a very short time, provided there is a low demand for oxidizing agents by wastewater. There is abundant information in the literature concerning the design and operation of the processes. Required ozone doses for several microorganisms are also available in the literature but, frequently, they are not affordable. As happens with chlorine, by-products generated during ozonation are a source of concern as many of them have been reported in the literature as toxic (Jim\u00e9nez, 2003) . 3. UV light. Nowadays, UV-light disinfection closely competes with chlorination because it does not generate by-products that are too costly to remove from wastewater. Besides, compared to chlorination, UV light does not need storage facilities, does not imply the handling of hazardous chemicals, and uses very small-size treatment tanks as disinfection contact times are very small (in the range of seconds or minutes). Furthermore, due its simplicity of operation and high adaptive potential, it is suitable for rural and isolated communities.",

As cost is an important barrier to spread sanitation services, one would expect that these data is a well-known parameter. Despite this, in many developing countries there are no reference costs, as exist in developed ones. As result of this situation, in many bids, costs are established using international data that do not necessarily reflect the local conditions (Table 10) . Differences are due not only to build the sanitation facilities but also for the use of fuel and electricity, two important inputs to operate wastewater treatment plants. Sludge management and disposal ( Figure 12) is another source of different affecting costs ( Figure 12 ). Table 10 also shows that the cost of emptying onsite sanitation systems is not negligible.",

In this chapter, the term 'reintegration' is introduced in order to emphasize that water needs to be returned to the environment or used once again (reuse). By reintegrating the water to the environment, the responsibility of using it and then restoring it back to the environment in a proper way may be realized. As, well water can be reintegrated into the hydraulic cycles in which is been used by the society, thus reducing the negative impact of extracting water from the environment beyond the amount needed for ecological use (environmental flow). Water can be reintegrated to the environment by discharging it to the soil or into water bodies. In the following, different ways to reintegrate used water are discussed.

The water quality of receiving water should be preserved to facilitate a safe water supply. For this, it is important to control pollutant content in the effluent, notably pathogens, organic matter, and nutrients (especially for surface water bodies with slow flow). Two aspects need to be monitored: oxygen depletion in rivers and eutrophication in dams and lakes. To avoid oxygen depletion, biodegradable organic matter needs to be removed before introducing the wastewater. There is considerable literature available concerning this aspect as it has been the main target for most wastewater treatment processes. Control of eutrophication is achieved by removing N and/or P from effluents; this is an operation costly to perform in wastewater treatment plants for most developing countries. As an alternative, land treatment can be used or treated wastewater used first for agricultural irrigation recovering it from the agricultural drainage before sending it to on lakes. Eutrophication of dams and lakes is a frequent problem in developing countries; alternatives for its control are discussed in Box 7.",

Due to the increase in the human population and the increased use of water for almost all human activities, water is becoming scarce and new tools are needed to use it better. Such tools are (1) the efficient use of water (using less water for the same activity -this is beyond the scope of this chapter) and (2) water reuse. Water reuse is a key component to alleviate the mismatch between water supply and water demand. At the global level, water availability is of around 8500 m 3 inhab \u00c01 yr \u00c01 but with important variations at a regional, national, and local level. For instance, it is estimated that around 700 million people (11% of the total population) in 43 countries live in areas with less than 1000 m 3 inhab \u00c01 yr \u00c01 . By the year 2025, 38% of the total world population will live under such water stress, increasing to 50% (in 149 countries) by the year 2050 (UNDP, 2006) . As shown in Maps 3, 4, and 9 (Annex 4), most of the affected people live in developing countries. For these countries, three aspects can be highlighted concerning water stress and water demand. First, water is needed for economic development and a better quality of life (even if industrialized countries are not completely making an efficient use of water; they use 30-50 times more water than developing ones (UN/WWAP, 2003) ). Second, agriculture is the dominant user of water worldwide, but, in addition, for developing countries, agriculture is usually the Criteria for selecting wastewater treatment operation and processes",

To reduce aquatic weed density (plants m \u00c02 ), five methods are available: * Biological control. It consists of using living organisms to control weeds. In theory, it is a cheap option as no equipment or chemicals are required but it has an associated labor cost in order to perform maintenance. To be completely effective, the rate of grazing needs to be higher than the plant growth rate, which is very difficult to match in practice. A wide variety of fish, arthropod, fungi, and bacteria have been used for this purpose. * Mechanical Control. These methods remove or cut weeds into pieces using mechanically or manually operated equipment. It is an expensive option that can play a role in quickly reducing the extent of infested areas prior to the application of another control method. * Chemical control. Pesticides are also used to control weeds. Some substances that have been used are terbutryn, diquat, 2,4-D, glyphosphate, paraquat, and simazine. However, due to their toxicity, they can only be applied under controlled conditions and for a limited period of time. * Water level control. In this method, the water level is decreased so the weeds located close to the edges of the water body dry out. The applicability of this method is limited to dams where water levels can be controlled, and to the dry season in which rain would not convey plants once again to the water. * Nutrient control. Weed growth is caused by high N or P content in water, and so, lowering their concentration through wastewater treatment is another alternative. Unfortunately, the cost remains high.",

This is a practice that happens almost naturally because of the combination of the high demand for water for irrigation (81% of total use compared to only 45% in developed countries, Figure 13 ), the availability of wastewater, the productivity boost that the added nutrients and organic matter provide, and the possibility to sow crops all year round (Jim\u00e9nez, 2006) .

            "text": "Approximately one-tenth of the world's population consumes crops irrigated with wastewater, diluted or not. As an example, in Hanoi, Vietnam, wastewater is used in the production of 80% of the vegetables consumed locally (Ensink et al., 2004) . The use of nontreated wastewater is also common for urban agriculture, which is practiced in urban and periurban areas of arid or wet countries where there is local demand for fresh food products, and people live on the verge of poverty with no job opportunities (Jim\u00e9nez, 2009b) . For urban agriculture, wastewater flowing in open channels is used to irrigate very small urban plots of land where trees, fodder, or any other product that can be introduced to the market in small quantities (flowers and vegetables) or be used as part of the family diet are grown (Ensink et al., 2004) . In terms of volume, reuse of nontreated wastewater is at least 6 times higher than of treated wastewater (Jim\u00e9nez, 2006; Jim\u00e9nez and Asano, 2008) . As a consequence, any sanitation project in localities using wastewater should consider its actual use. 2. Unintentional reuse for water recharge. Since groundwater is not water that can be observed as in lakes or dams, very often its pollution and nonintentional recharge is not perceived. Infiltration may result from agricultural irrigation, leakages from wastewater and water urban networks, unlined dams, tanks or reservoirs, and on-site sanitation systems. Little information on the extent of this problem is reported in literature, but some cases (a summary is presented in Table 12 ) have been described highlighting the importance of this phenomenon as a source of water supply. For the one referring to the Tula Valley, it has been the best documented (Jim\u00e9nez, 2008b ) that recharge with wastewater amounts to at least 25 m 3 s \u00c01 , and the aquifer is used to supply 500 000 people. Infiltration and pollution of groundwater supplies varies from negligible to severe, and the recognition of unplanned reuse is needed in order to advance understanding of how to manage the risks. This may involve continuing groundwater recharge with water of improved quality and/or separating the recharge areas further from points of water abstraction. Appropriate monitoring information will allow the most cost-effective investments to be identified (Dillon and Jim\u00e9nez, 2008) . 3. Nonintentional reuse for human consumption. Nonintentional reuse for human consumption occurs as described previously, not only through aquifer recharge but also through surface water sources when effluents, treated or nontreated, are discharged into them. This has been documented in developed countries. For instance, in the River Thames in England, during dry periods, 70% of the water used as supply downstream comes from treated effluent. In California's Santa Ana River, a large part of the supply consists of treated wastewater (Gray and Sedlak, 2003) and in Berlin, 17-35% of the city's water supply comes from an advanced treated effluent that is discharged to a nearby water supply (Jekel and Gruenheid, 2008) . The increasing evidence of the presence of emerging contaminants in water sources is an indication of the nonintentional reuse of water. Information on this subject for developing countries is very poor, and possibly only reported as pollution cases. Recognizing the nonintentional reuse of water for human consumption will help society to acknowledge that water reuse is unavoidable in the future and also to understand that, to properly reintegrate used water to the environment is needed. For this, tools other than wastewater treatment plants will be needed.",

In such a context, safe wastewater reuse can be a sanitation option that could also be coupled with food security and economic development goals. Under prevailing land and water management practices, a balanced diet represents a depleting water use of 1300 m 3 inhab \u00c01 yr \u00c01 , which is 70 times more than the 50 l inhab \u00c01 d \u00c01 required for basic household water needs (SIWI-IMWI, 2006) . For several middle-and low-income countries, agriculture is currently, and will continue to be, a key sector representing 80% of export earnings. Limited and unreliable access to water is a determining factor in agricultural productivity in many regions, a problem rooted in rainfall variability that is likely to increase with climate change (Lenghton et al., 2005) . To feed this sector, water reuse can be one option. Planned reuse of water for agricultural irrigation in developing countries is a convenient strategy for many reasons (Jim\u00e9nez and Gardu\u00f1 o, 2001; Jim\u00e9nez, 2006 Jim\u00e9nez, , 2009a WHO, 2006; Keraita et al., 2008) , such as \u2022 It is an easy option to increase controlled reuse when nontreated wastewater is already in use as it allows more profitable and safe products.",

            "text": "\u2022 It can be part of a strategy to secure food and increase poor people's income in water-scarce areas. To obtain all the advantages from reusing wastewater for agriculture in planned projects, it is important (1) to control possible negative effects (Jim\u00e9nez, 2006; WHO, 2006) such as those related to health; (2) to keep in mind that in many cases nontreated wastewater is being reused at low or even no cost by poor farmers and, hence, they will be unable to afford reuse costs; and (3) from the legal aspect, the historical use of nontreated wastewater by farmers confers riparian rights. 2. Reintegrating water for industrial reuse. Industrial reuse (reclamation of wastewater from a different use, i.e., reuse of a municipal effluent for industrial cooling) differs from municipal and agriculture reuse as it involves the private sector that has its own rules and well-defined needs driven by economic factors (Jim\u00e9nez and Asano, 2008) . Before reusing water, industries always prefer to implement watersaving projects as these immediately reflect on their budgets; for reusing water, investments to provide proper treatment and monitoring programs are needed. To promote industrial reuse, the best government strategy is to provide incentives rather than setting compulsory regulations (Jim\u00e9nez and Asano, 2008) . Among the different industrial reuse options, cooling is the most popular due to its high water demand, and the possibility of using secondary-treated municipal effluents, sometimes coupled with filtration or softening processes. As a consequence, power plants located near urban areas are potential sites of industrial water reuse. 3. Reintegrating water to the environment. More than 1.4 billion people live in river basins where the intense use of water threatens freshwater ecosystems (Smakhtin et al., 2004) . Reintegrating water to the environment is a practice that is gaining momentum, as it is being recognized that (1) the environment needs water and (2) the environment has the same entitlement to water as other uses. Unfortunately, these two aspects are better recognized by developed countries than developing ones. Overuse of water tends to occur in regions heavily dependent on irrigated agriculture or where there is rapid growth of densely populated areas (UNDP, 2006) , two characteristics common in developing countries. Among the more prominent examples (UNDP, 2006) of water overuse, the exploitation of the Yellow River basin, in northern China, can be cited: Human withdrawal currently leaves less than 10% of the flow remaining in the river. The river ran dry 600 km inland for a record 226 days in 1997. The drying up of the river caused a drop in agricultural production averaging 2.7-8.5 million tons a year, with losses estimated at US$1.7 billion for 1997. The purified effluent from sewage treatment plants can be used for the augmentation of river flows, to raise the level of wetlands or lakes, to recover dried lakes, or even to create new lakes or wetlands. In doing so, biodiversity may recover. Care must be taken when restoring water into water bodies to preserve or improve the actual quality of water. Used water reclamation can be combined with rainwater reclamation. Water reuse with environmental restoration can be coupled with projects of urban image improvement or programs to provide better facilities at recreational areas. 4. Restoring water to aquifers. Aquifer recharge is not, itself, a use of reclaimed water but is often part of the pathway to reuse. It is a convenient way to reintegrate water into the environment but can be used only under certain circumstances related, in particular, to the type of soil and groundwater. Aquifer recharge can be performed to recover groundwater levels, to control saline intrusion, to augment drinking water sources, to protect and, in some cases, to improve underground water quality, to protect surface water bodies from contamination by effluents, to increase water availability for any use, and simply to store water for the future (Dillon and Jim\u00e9nez, 2008; Corrleje et al., 2008) .",

It also provides low-cost storage that occupies a minimum of valuable urban land, while stored water is protected from pollution and evaporation. There are two methods to recharge aquifers. The first is known as land-spread infiltration where treated wastewater infiltrates through soil by gravity. This option has relatively low operating and maintenance costs. The second method for recharge is direct well injection. In this option, wells are used to convey a highly treated effluent directly to aquifers. Regulation to recharge aquifers are very different from one country to another; some are set at a national level while others are defined using a case-by-case approach (Jim\u00e9nez, 2003) . Most of the projects to recharge aquifers are found in developed countries. In developing ones, some examples are found in Atlantis, South Africa (for drinking and agricultural purposes, using pond infiltration), in Windhoek, Namibia (for drinking purposes and using injection wells), in New Delhi, India (for irrigation using infiltration ponds for treated urban wastewater and stormwater), in Beijing, China (for drinking purposes using wells and recharge basins), and in Mexico City, Mexico (for drinking purposes on a limited scale and using infiltration ponds; Dillon and Jim\u00e9nez, 2008) . In all these cases, wastewater is treated to at least at a secondary level (see section titled 'Relevant websites'). 5. Reintegrating water for municipal use. In 20 years, 60% of the world's population will be living in cities (UN, 2006) . This being the case, more water will be needed for municipal use and, at the same time, more municipal wastewater will be produced. This situation, therefore, represents an opportunity to increase municipal wastewater reuse. Water reuse in cities represents an opportunity to conveniently treat wastewater, with environmental and even economic advantages. Opportunities to reuse wastewater in cities are classified into two groups: (1) those demanding relatively low-quality water and involving low health risks, and (2) those demanding high-quality water where health risks are high. In the first group, there are several types of uses, such as: (a) the filling of recreational lakes or the operation of fountains; (b) car, truck, or street washing; and (c) green area irrigation. Options demanding high water quality include reuse for drinking supply. Around the world, there are successful examples of both types of reuse, low risk options being the most common. Water reuse for human consumption, although less common, is no less important. Moreover, the only two examples of the reuse of water for human consumption in the world are notably from two countries from the developing world: Namibia and Singapore (Box 8).",

Typical sources of graywater are bathing, laundry, dishwashing, and food preparation. Due to its comparably low and easily degradable contamination, it can be relatively easily treated for reuse. Graywater reclamation entails the production of less wastewater to be treated in centralized plants. Graywater reuse is performed at the same facilities where it is produced and, as a result, a short storage time is needed (1 day retention time). Graywater reuse can be performed individually (for a single home) or collectively (several groups of houses or larger buildings). Treated graywater may be used for watering plants, kitchen gardens, and for the safe augmentation of ground-or surface water. Treatment can be very simple or highly sophisticated, ranging from simple manually operated sand filters to biomembrane reactors, hence, covering the needs for rural areas or buildings located in upmarket areas in megacities. Further details on design and operation can be found in Correlje and Schuetze (2008) . Graywater reuse can be as well an important component for basic sanitation, as described in Section 4.06.6.1.",

From information coming from 10 middle-income countries, including Africa (Namibia and South Africa), the Middle East (Iran, Jordan and Turkey), Asia (China and Russian Federation), and Latin America (Brazil, Colombia and Mexico), it is shown that wastewater treatment facilities serve mostly urban areas using preliminary, primary, and, in some cases, secondary processes. For rural or poor periurban areas, basic sanitation facilities are provided. Although sludge is produced in these facilities, this is not always managed as part of the sanitation service. The disposal options for the sludge from wastewater treatment plants produced are landfill dumping, dumping into sewers, storage at wastewater treatment plants, land application, and agricultural reclamation. Land application and agricultural reclamation are options limited by space problems, while the use of landfills is restricted in densely populated urban areas, where solid wastes compete for space with sludge. As sludge production is still low in the few wastewater treatment plants available, sludge management policies are novel, and are still in a maturation phase. Some of these policies offer new approaches different to those used in developed countries (LeBlanc et al., 2008) . With regard to fecal sludge, the main constraint for their management is the cost to empty on-site sanitation systems as these are often located in inaccessible areas, are large in number, and are frequently highly dispersed. It is noted that the high cost of latrine emptying is not sustainable, even for large municipalities. Extracted fecal sludge is often buried on-site, dumped into landfills or sewers or sent to uncontrolled discharge sites. Discharge of sludge and fecal sludge in sewers often lead to surpass the wastewater treatment plants' capacity when available. 2. For low-income countries. Data from different African countries (Burkina Faso, Cameroon, C\u00f4 te D'Ivoire, Ethiopia, Mali, Mozambique, Namibia, Nigeria, Senegal, and South Africa) demonstrated a similar situation focused on the need to provide basic sanitation services either in rural or urban areas. Few cities have complete sewerage systems and, when available, sewers frequently feed into partially functioning wastewater treatment plants. In these countries, the use of on-site sanitation systems, such as septic tanks, bucket latrines, pit latrines, and dry latrines, produces fecal sludge, which is often 'contaminated' with domestic waste. In dense informal settlements, the challenges to properly handle fecal sludge are significant as besides the technical constraints other factors related to the social, political, and cultural aspects come into play. Fecal sludge handling includes the need to provide reliable and low-cost options to emptying the facilities, to provide proper and affordable treatment and transportation, and to have suitable sites for safe disposal.",

            "text": "Windhoek, Namibia, has been reusing wastewater for human consumption for more than 40 years (Van der Merwe et al., 2008) as result of an original idea in 1956. Since its operation, no measurable health risk has been observed and neither have people drinking reused water displayed associated health problems. The reclamation plant has undergone several modifications to improve the technology used. The quality of the water supplied can be consulted every day in the local newspaper. The amount of water reused is around 250 ls \u00c01 , which is distributed after dilution by a factor of 1-3 with first-use water. The monitoring program for the facility represents 20% of the operating costs, and is performed by the wastewater treatment plant and also by three independent laboratories. The system is operated using a multiple barrier concept that goes beyond the wastewater treatment plant. The astute words ''Water should be judged by its quality; not its history'' are attributed to Dr. Lucas van Vuuren (van der Merwe et al., 2008) , one of the pioneers of the Windhoek reclamation system. This refers to the fact that fear of reused water should be based on rational aspects. The other example of direct reuse of wastewater for human consumption comes from Singapore (Funamizu et al., 2008) and is known as the NEWater project. It started in 2003 and uses a secondary effluent that is further treated with a membrane system (microfiltration (MF) and reverse osmosis (RO)) and UV-light disinfection. The water produced is cleaner than tap water as it fulfills all the requirements set by US-EPA and WHO for drinking purposes. Treated water is channeled to a reservoir, from which it is taken as supply after dilution with first-use water. Water is distributed through the network for use for domestic and industrial purposes. When the NEWater project was launched, it operated at a rate of 870 l s \u00c01 . This will be progressively increased to reach 2400 l s \u00c01 by 2011 (B0.5% and 2.5% of total water consumption, respectively). In both cases, Namibia and Singapore, before the implementation of the reuse programs, stringent industrial pre-treatment programs and segregation of industrial effluent from the sewer were put in place.",

Bissau, Guinea, in West Africa is a city attracting huge numbers of people from the surrounding countryside. Most of them have settled in squatter new areas around the old colonial center. During a study performed in the 1990s, it was found that the newly piped water taps ran dry several times per day. As a result, many people returned to the old wells. These were often more contaminated than before because the new pit latrines installed close to the wells polluted the groundwater. Groundwater quality was also impacted by solid waste thrown into the pits dug for the production of adobe blocks to build new houses. Moreover, the new network of gutters was now efficiently removing most of the clean rainwater that used to recharge the groundwater. The gutters caused an extra problem. On the edge of the settlements, where the gutters ended, storm water peaks caused serious soil erosion. This created problems for a newly developed scheme of vegetable gardens on the urban fringe, and even threatened houses.The original problem -the lack of water in piped water taps -was related to electrical power failures causing water pumps to stop. Similar situations can be encountered in many developing countries and they cannot be easily solved as long as their roots are not properly and integrally tackled.",

The lack of political will and commitment at the highest level (WHO/UNICEF, 2000) is a barrier that is greater than, for instance, the lack of economic resources, the capacity for building, or the acquisition of appropriate technology, since all these may be overcome by a strong political support. In order to develop political will, politicians and society need to appreciate the value of sanitation. An understanding that it is through the provision of water supply and sanitation that industrialized countries build up strong societies with good health and good economic conditions is needed (Box 12). 2. The second challenge is to put in place accountability mechanisms to ensure that resources provided to fulfill In Cameroon, some houses are equipped with a 2 m-deep hole for a latrine, surrounded by pieces of timber. When the hole is full, it is covered with earth and medicinal or aromatic plants, and another facility is built. If the family has no land to dig another hole (as frequently happens), they call the tanker to empty it at a cost of US$120. Sometimes, while the family saves up the money, excreta overflows and pollutes the nearby area where wells and boreholes are located, threatening drinking water quality. When feces are removed by tanker trucks, they are often dumped into rivers or the forest, because there are no treatment facilities. Houses in modern residential areas have septic tanks, and their effluents are directed into wells for filtration. Often, this does not happen in the correct way because builders have not mastered the technology. Some collective residential areas, universities, and hospitals are connected to sewers that convey wastewater to a treatment plant, from where treated water is directed to a river.",

To allow the city to return to normal conditions, health experts advised constant handwashing and the disinfection of school toilets. At this point, politicians realized that 200 public schools had no water at all, 195 had malfunctioning toilets and 90 more had no facilities at all. Before the swine flu epidemic, politicians had not understood the link between water, sanitation, and health and had not addressed this problem, although on many occasions parents' associations had requested the services. The president of one parents' association commented on the news that, in contrast to most Mexicans, he believed that the swine flu had been a blessing as it was the only way to ensure proper sanitation facilities at schools.

As a result, services are being provided by other means. Data from India indicate that as much as 8% of rural households across the country invest their own money and use small private providers to construct latrines. Self-provision accounts for about 1 million privately installed septic tanks in Manila and in Jakarta. Research in Africa confirms that the role of the small-scale private sector in sanitation provision is significant. These findings are further supported by data from the JMP (WHO-UNICEF Joint Monitoring Programme): between 1990 and 2000, the increase in the number of people served by sanitation reported by the JMP was much larger than the expected impacts of the public investment that occurred during this period. The reorientation of public programs to either modify their structures or to promote and assist the provision of sanitation services by small private and even familiar companies is needed.

Figure 15 shows the origin of investments. In the case of Asia and Latin-America, almost all the finances have come from governments, while, for Africa, it represented nearly a half. From the previous analysis, it is evident that there is need to invest money to catch up with the level of services needed. Before calling for funding, it is convenient to analyze (preferably only within each country, without the input of donors or enterprises) what the money should be used for. To sustainably increase sanitation coverage, economic resources are needed not only to build sanitation infrastructure, but also for planning according to local needs and possibilities, developing research and technology, and developing institutional capacity in a local context. Unfortunately, most of the time, funding is provided only for some of these activities (mostly for infrastructure); one major reason being that, often, this is the only type of funding that is sought.",

As such, in 1976, the Ministry of Health launched an intensive national campaign for the self-help construction of latrines. Many thousands of latrines were constructed during a relatively short period. However, there were numerous problems, including insufficient awareness about environmental conditions, a lack of technical guidance in latrine design and construction, and shortages of critical building materials. Consequently, many of the latrines became structurally unsafe and unusable. In response, a research project was initiated in 1979 to ''identify and develop a suitable technology and method for large-scale implementation of improved sanitation in periurban areas.'' The result was the development and successful pilot testing of an appropriate and cost-effective technology. From 1979 to 1994, around 135 000 improved latrines were produced. In addition, an awareness campaign was carried out on the use of the latrine, hygiene promotion, and capacity building. In 1996, the program was extended to the rural areas. Prior to 1998, more than 230 000 latrines were constructed and installed. In December 1998, the program was formally transferred to the National Directorate of Water Affairs. Overall, it has been a long and steady scaling-up process over more than 10 years that ended by ensuring a progressive withdrawal of the government from latrine production. The emphasis now is given to decentralization and privatization for the services, although the responsibility for the program remains with the government. From this experience, some lessons learned, are * Although technology must be simple, it is important for massive use to ensure its local production and commercialization. There must be several types of sanitation facilities with different prices in order to commercialize. * A good network needs to be established between users (periurban communities, the government, nongovernmental organizations (NGOs), small private companies, and donors) to ensure that the program progressively developed its own dynamism. * Latrines need to be emptied and the service needs to be provided.",

Private funding includes not only international or national firms, but also self-provision schemes provided by nonconventional private enterprise. These nonconventional private enterprises have been called by some 'informal' although for several developing countries, they have in many cases proven to be more formal, useful, and to provide more reliable services than formal ones. For example, in India, an NGO named Sulabh has installed 5500 pour-flush toilets that are operated on a fee-paying basis and are maintained by attendants who live at the facilities. Through providing good reliable service, Sulabh's facilities have become a model for sustainable public sanitation services.

In Britain, for example, urban authorities borrowed more than d7.7 million for sewerage work during the period 1880-91. Eventually, the public provision of sanitation became an uncontroversial and indeed, an expected part of life. Similarly, for many municipalities in the United States, public financing of sanitation infrastructure was seen as the only option for ensuring investment adequate to protect public health. In the nineteenth century, Boston, for example, had lower-than-expected connection rates among households to the city's new water and sewer network; this prompted the city to cover the cost of service pipes for all unconnected households. In 1850, an influential state sanitary survey concluded that governments must accept responsibility for financing public sanitation infrastructure because, left to their own devices, a large proportion of Massachusetts residents would be unable or unwilling to take on personal responsibility to conduct their lives in accord with recommended sanitary principles. Until recently, grants of up to 70% or more were provided for innovative sanitation technologies in the United States. One aspect to keep in mind concerning public and private participation is that for the sanitation field, these funding options combine better with certain type of sanitation systems, characterized in terms of their size and used technology (Table 14) .",

For some, these are figures difficult to reach even if the use of loans is considered. For them, external donors can play an important role. Middleincome countries have fewer needs and more economical capacity to meet their MDGs. For some, it is estimated that they could use up to 15% of their GDP, and hence it is considered that no external finance is needed (Lenghton et al., 2005) . Moreover, this situation, from the point of view of some authors, offers to inform the private sector of great opportunities to conduct a business and, as a result, in several middle-income countries private funding is being promoted. One possible risk, which needs to be considered by local government and known by society in general, is that through private participation and international loans, technology and sanitation schemes from other countries are promoted, which do not always effectively solve local problems in the cheapest and most efficient way. Another risk is the use of the money for additional purposes. To deal with this, it is important, on the one hand, for the government to be accountable and, on the other hand, for society to demand transparency. In any case, it is certain that developing countries need to be creative to raise funds for sanitation. One option is to raise them as part of other projects in which sanitation can be a component; these include those considering goals for food security, health, land remediation, environmental problems control, and adaptation to climate change, for which several donors may be available.
