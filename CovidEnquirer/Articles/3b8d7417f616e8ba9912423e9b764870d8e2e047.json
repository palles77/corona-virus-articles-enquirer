RNA viruses have extremely high mutation rates and thus represent a significant source of these infectious diseases. In the present study, we showed that a plant-pathogenic RNA virus, tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV), could replicate and produce virions in honeybees, Apis mellifera, resulting in infections that were found throughout the entire body. Additionally, we showed that TRSV-infected individuals were continually present in some monitored colonies. While intracellular life cycle, species-level genetic variation, and pathogenesis of the virus in honeybee hosts remain to be determined, the increasing prevalence of TRSV in conjunction with other bee viruses from spring toward winter in infected colonies was associated with gradual decline of host populations and winter colony collapse, suggesting the negative impact of the virus on colony survival. Furthermore, we showed that TRSV was also found in ectoparasitic Varroa mites that feed on bee hemolymph, but in those instances the virus was restricted to the gastric cecum of Varroa mites, suggesting that Varroa mites may facilitate the spread of TRSV in bees but do not experience systemic invasion. Finally, our phylogenetic analysis revealed that TRSV isolates from bees, bee pollen, and Varroa mites clustered together, forming a monophyletic clade.",

Here we provide evidence that a pollenborne plant virus, tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV), also replicates in honeybees and that the virus systemically invades and replicates in different body parts. In addition, the virus was detected inside the body of parasitic Varroa mites, which consume bee hemolymph, suggesting that Varroa mites may play a role in facilitating the spread of the virus in bee colonies. This study represents the first evidence that honeybees exposed to virus-contaminated pollen could also be infected and raises awareness of potential risks of new viral disease emergence due to host shift events. About 5% of known plant viruses are pollen transmitted, and these are potential sources of future host-jumping viruses. The findings from this study showcase the need for increased surveillance for potential host-jumping events as an integrated part of insect pollinator management programs. YP. 2014.

This discovery raised concerns about a possible role of pollen in spreading viruses and suggested that viruses could possibly contribute to the observed pollinator decline around the world. In order to advance our understanding of the role of pollen in virus transmission of honeybees, we carried out a study to screen bees and pollen loads of bee colonies for the presence of frequent and rare viruses. Our study resulted in the serendipitous detection of a plant virus, tobacco ringspot virus (TRSV), in honeybees and prompted us to investigate whether this plant-infecting virus could cause systemic infection in exposed honeybees.",

            "text": "Generally, the majority of plant viruses are dependent upon herbivorous insects for their spread from one host plant to another in nature but cause infection only in plants that the insect vectors feed upon. To date, only a few plant viruses are known that also infect their insect vectors. Rhabdoviridae, a family of arboviruses carried by arthropods, has long been recognized to have a broad range of hosts throughout the animal and plant kingdoms (12) . Flock house virus (FHV), a positive-stranded RNA virus of insect origin belonging to the family Nodaviridae, has been shown to replicate in plants as well as in yeast (Saccharomyces cerevisiae) and mammalian cells (13, 14) . A recent study (15) showed that a plant-pathogenic virus, tomato spotted wilt virus (TSWV), which is a member of the family Bunyaviridae, could directly alter the behavior of thrips that vector it. The phenomenon of viral host range spanning the plant and animal kingdoms adds an additional layer to the already complex plant-pathogen-pollinator interactions and could have important epidemiological consequences.",

            "text": "TRSV is a type species of the genus Nepovirus within the family Secoviridae (16) . TRSV infects a wide range of herbaceous crops and woody plants, some of considerable economic importance. The infected plants show discoloration, malformation, and stunted growth, accompanied by reduced seed yield or almost total seed loss due to flower and pod abortion. Of a number of plant diseases caused by TRSV, bud blight disease of soybean (Glycine max L.) is the most severe. It is characterized by necrotic ring spots on the foliage, curving of the terminal bud, and rapid wilting and eventual death of the entire plant, resulting in a yield loss of 25 to 100% (17) . Like other members of the genus, TRSV has a bipartite genome of positive-sense, single-stranded polyadenylated RNA molecules, RNA-1 and RNA-2, which are encapsidated in separate virions of similar size. Both RNA molecules possess a genome-linked protein (Vpg) covalently bound at their 5= ends. RNA-1 encodes a large polyprotein precursor that is proteolytically processed into protease cofactor (P1A), putative ATPdependent helicase (Hel), picornain 3C-like protease (Pro), and RNA-directed RNA polymerase (Pol). RNA2 encodes a virion capsid protein (CP), a putative movement protein (MP), and an N-terminal domain involved in RNA-2 replication (P2A). Proteins encoded by RNA-1 are required for RNA replication, while proteins encoded by RNA-2 function in cell-to-cell movement and viral RNA encapsulation. RNA-1 is capable of replication independently of RNA-2, but both are required for systemic infection. Transmission of TRSV can occur in several ways. The numerous vectors include a dagger nematode (18) , aphids, thrips, grasshoppers, and tobacco flea beetle (19) (20) (21) ; however, vertical transmission through seeds is important for long-distance dispersal of the virus (22) . It has also been shown that honeybees transmit TRSV when they move between flowers and transfer virusborne pollen from infected plants to healthy ones (23) (24) (25) (26) . It was, however, unknown prior to our study whether honeybees could become infected by plant viruses they physically encounter or consume.",

Instead, our data indicate that the replication of TRSV occurs widely in the honeybee body but not in the gut or salivary gland and that TRSV in conjunction with other bee viruses is correlated with winter colony level declines. Further, virus was found in a common ectoparasite mite of honeybees, Varroa destructor, but was restricted to the gastric cecum.

            "text": "Honeybees carry a strong electrostatic charge that ensures the adherence of pollen to their bodies, and they also actively store pollen in specialized pollen baskets on their hind legs. It is therefore not unexpected that the foraging behavior of honeybees could move virus-contaminated pollen to the flowers of healthy plants (26, 36) . However, this study represents the first evidence that honeybees exposed to virus-contaminated pollen could also be subsequently infected and that the infection could be systemic and spread throughout the entire body of honeybees. About 5% of known plant viruses are pollen transmitted, and the genomes of the majority of plant viruses are made of RNA (37, 38) , providing a large set of potential host-jumping viruses. The finding from this study illustrates the complexity of relationships between plant pathogens and the pollinating insects and emphasizes the need for surveillance for potential host-jumping events as an integrated part of insect pollinator conservation. For a virus to successfully establish infection in a novel host, the virus must overcome three major hurdles. First, it must have the opportunity to come into contact with a prospective host for the viral particles to gain entry into the host cells. Second, the virus must undergo genetic changes that mediate the entry of virus into host cells, typically through host receptors on the cell surface. The virus must also undergo genetic changes that can lead to the ability to bypass the host's immune defense and replicate its genome using the host's cellular machinery. Finally, the virus must gain the ability to spread horizontally between individuals of the same gen- Food-borne transmission is one of the most important routes for virus transmission in honeybees. Infections of several honeybee viruses occur through ingestion of virus-contaminated food followed by dissemination of the viruses from the midgut into other tissues through the hemolymph (39) . Since TRSV is a known pollen-borne plant virus, we initially believed that the presence of TRSV was restricted to the bees' digestive tract. However, titers of TRSV in our study were unexpectedly low in the gut. Viral replication was not detected in either the gut or the salivary gland. Instead, high titers of negative-stranded virus were found in the wing, nerve, antenna, trachea, hemolymph, and fat body, indicating replication in those tissues. The absence of virus replication in the tissues of the gut and salivary gland excludes the possibility of TRSV as a persistent-propagative virus which must first replicate in epithelial cells of the midgut and then migrate to the salivary glands to be ejected together with saliva. Our quantitative analysis suggests that TRSV is neurotropic in honeybees, with more extensive infection detected in the nervous system than in other internal tissues, and therefore it is conceivable that severe TRSV infection can cause functional impairment of the nerve and muscle in honeybees. The low levels of TRSV in the gut suggests a possible result of sloughing off of infected epithelial cells from midgut as a host defensive mechanism or the possibility that TRSV might utilize some alternative invasion routes such as the neural or tracheal route. Further investigation of the virus transmission and pathogenicity is warranted.",

In addition to its direct detrimental effects on host life span and colony vigor (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) , the feeding of mites on bees provides an entry for microbial pathogens (44) . Indeed, the roles played by Varroa mites in acquiring and transmitting honeybee viruses have been experimentally demonstrated in several studies (46) (47) (48) (49) . The observation of the positive signal of TRSV within the storage organ of the mites suggests that the Varroa mite is not merely a mechanical vector that physically transports viruses from host to host with its mouthparts. More work is needed to confirm whether Varroa mites can act as a biological vector to support TRSV replication.",

Nevertheless, substitution of a single or a few amino acids at the surface of virus particles can be sufficient to alter receptor recognition and thereby alter host range (51) . Thus, the few amino acid polymorphisms observed in TRSV strains infecting honeybees may still be associated with cell tropism and host adaptation. It would be helpful to further characterize the complete genome of TRSV isolates from honeybees as well as from Varroa mites to deepen our understanding of genetic diversity of this virus.

While findings from this study have important implications for understanding TRSV transmission and pathogenesis, much remains to be learned about the intracellular life cycle, species-level genetic variation, and pathogenesis of the virus in honeybee hosts. Although the cause(s) of CCD and the decline in the worldwide bee population is not yet fully understood (52), a growing body of evidence has indicated that parasites and pathogens are key culprits involved in widespread disappearance/death and population declines of honeybees (3, 5, (53) (54) (55) (56) (57) . The observation that increasing prevalence of TRSV in conjunction with other bee viruses in infected colonies is associated with gradual decline of host populations and winter colony collapse supports the argument that virus infections could have a significant negative impact on colony survival. While the simultaneous presence of multiple viruses and asymptomatic viral infections in honeybees as well as lack of a cell culture system for virus production (58, 59) makes Koch's postulates of disease causality difficult to fulfill, the observed negative correlation between the level of TRSV infections and size of host populations suggests that TRSV, in combination with other viruses, is likely a contributing factor to poor survivorship of honeybee colonies.",
