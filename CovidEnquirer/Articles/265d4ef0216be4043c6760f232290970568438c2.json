The evidence for increased transmission of infectious diseases at international sporting mass gatherings that attract many visitors from all over the world is not clear, and the evidence base for public health surveillance, epidemiology, and response at events such as the Olympics is small. However, infectious diseases are a recognised risk, and public health planning is, and should remain, a crucial part of the overall planning of sporting events. In this Series paper, we set out the planning and the surveillance systems that were used to monitor public health risks during the London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games in the summer of 2012, and draw attention to the public health issues-infectious diseases and chemical, radiation, and environmental hazards-that arose. Although the absolute risk of health-protection problems, including infectious diseases, at sporting mass gatherings is small, the need for reassurance of the absence of problems is higher than has previously been considered; this could challenge conventional public health surveillance systems. Recognition of the limitations of health-surveillance systems needs to be part of the planning for future sporting events.",

Across all four regions where the Games were located, in areas representing 51% of Greece's population, salmonellosis accounted for about 50% of the mandatory notifi cations, tuberculosis 17%, hepatitis B 5%, aseptic meningitis 4%, and bacterial meningitis 3%. Recorded morbidity from infectious diseases was very low (2-3%). 14 small clusters (2-4 people) and eight large clusters (6-38 people) of foodborne or waterborne disease were reported in August, 2004. None of these outbreaks was reported from an Olympic venue, highlighting the tendency for all events in an Olympic City during the Games to be labelled as Olympics-related. 4 In disease outbreaks were reported. 5 Enhancement of health-protection measures, particularly food safety and hygiene along the entire food-supply chain, might have caused an absolute decrease in morbidity. 6 However, the experience of the Democratic National Convention in Boston, MA, USA, where a reduction in health attendance was also noted during the event, suggests that movement of the resident population out of the mass-gathering environment might also partly explain the reduction in reported cases of communicable diseases.",

Several gastrointestinal incidents have been reported from mass gatherings such as festivals and sports events. [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] Respiratory illnesses have always been major concerns for mass gatherings, as evidenced by the Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus. Indeed, airborne spread of microorganisms in the context of a mass gathering could result in not only respiratory tract diseases but also clusters of diseases such as measles, mumps, and meningococcal infection. 13 Infl uenza has frequently been recorded at sporting and music events such as the 2002 Winter Olympics in Salt Lake City, UT, USA, 14 and music festivals in 2009 in Belgium, 15 Serbia, 16 and Hungary, 17 and also at the World Youth Day in Sydney, NSW, Australia, in July, 2008. 18 However, sustained control measures, including vaccination, during the global pandemic in 2009 averted outbreaks of infl uenza A H1N1 at the Hajj and the Asian Youth Games, Singapore. 19, 20 The extent to which information needs at these mass gatherings are driven by politics and the media rather than by epidemiology or public health risk is not clear from published work. Demand is huge for information about any possible risk to the Games and to the reputation of the host city. Politicians and decision makers often seek reassurance that nothing is happening-this negative fi nding is not easily and reliably available from traditional surveillance systems. Recognition of the limits of surveillance systems needs to be part of massgathering planning.",

This testing would provide early warnings of exposures to infectious or toxic hazards, ensure satisfactory standards of food and water for consumption were achieved, and guarantee environ mental controls (particularly of water in new or vacant buildings and facilities) were properly applied. Additional tests are often requested by event organisers-eg, for the 2012 Games additional tests were done on samples from marinas, hotels, training camps, and ships, as well as on samples from swimming pools, spa pools, water systems, food services, and mobile food vendors. An additional request was to assess the water quality of the architectural water features in the Olympic Park.",

A process of assessment for inclusion in the reports submitted to the OCC was agreed, and then a further review to identify what would be included in the situation report.

These outbreaks were managed by following of routine public health measures, such as isolation of people who were ill and provision of information about signs and symptoms of infections. The main risk was that of the athletes with norovirus transferring to the Athletes' Village (a closed community) while infectious-action was therefore taken by LOCOG, on the HPA's advice, to delay and manage the transfer of athletes. Figure 1 shows the number of events reported in HPA's daily situation report, by primary source of report. Across the 73 days of the HPA's daily Games-time monitoring (July 2-Sept 12), the HPA's situation report included 58 new events (not including the routine daily environment information from the Centre for Radiation, Chemical and Environmental Hazards), and 95 updates on these events.

However, some events reported were associated with athletes, and the HPA managed these appropriately by the provision of expert advice and close working with LOCOG.

Because the need for this reassurance emerged in the planning discussions, enhancements to surveillance systems and to the coordination and communication of public health activity were necessary to ensure the need could be met. Surveillance systems are not primarily designed to prove that nothing is happening, so they need to be reviewed and enhanced to fulfi l this role eff ectively.
