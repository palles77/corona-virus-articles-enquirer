Synthetic peptides containing the sequence of site D induced TGEV neutralizing antibodies when inoculated subcutaneously in both rabbits and swine. A synthetic oligonucleotide encoding residues 373-398 of TGEV S protein, including antigenic site D, was cloned in frame with the 3' end of LT-B gene, into a plasmid used to transform S. typhimurium Aasd Z3730. A collection of 6 recombinant plasmids designated pYALTB-D I-VI encoding LTB-site D fusions with a variable number of site D sequences were selected. Four of the 6 LTB-site D fusion products expressed in S. typhimurium Z3730 formed oligomers (pentamers) that dissociated at > 70 \u00b0. S. typhimurium Z3730 (pYALTB-D) V and VI expressed the oligomer forming products with higher antigenicity. Partially purified LTB-site D fusion product expressed from S. typhimurium Z3730 (pYALTB-D) V induced anti-TGEV neutralizing antibodies in rabbits. Recombinant vaccine strain S. typhimurium zJcya AcrpAasd X3987 transformed with plasmid pYALTB-D V expressed constitutively products that formed oligomers presumably containing 20 copies of site D, and showed a high stability in vitro. This recombinant strain was orally inoculated in rabbits and induced TGEV specific antibodies in both serum and intestinal secretion.",

            "text": "Passive immunity is of primary importance in providing newborn piglets with immediate protection against TGEV infection (Saif and Wesley, 1992) . This type of protection can be achieved by the induction of lactogenic immunity (Hooper and Haelterman, 1966; Stone et al., 1977; Wesley et al., 1988; de Diego et al., 1992) , which can be stimulated by presentation of selected antigens to the immune system in gut associated lymphoid tissues (GALT) (Montgomery et al., 1974) . One possible approach to deliver antigens to the GALT is the use of vectors with tropism for Peyer's patches, such as Salmonella . S. typhimuriumzlcyaAcrp mutants, which are deficient in the synthesis of adenylate cyclase and the cyclic AMP (cAMP) receptor protein (CRP), are both avirulent and immunogenic in orally immunized mice and swine, while retaining their ability to colonize and persist in the GALT (Curtiss and Kelly, 1987; Coe and Wood, 1992) . The expression of heterologous antigens as fusion products with E. coli heat-labile toxin B subunit (LT-B) in attenuated Salmonella has been described as an optimal strategy for the induction of secretory immunity against foreign proteins (Pierce et al., 1980; Spangler, 1992) . LT consists of 5 non-covalently bound B subunits and 1 A subunit. The non-toxic B subunits are responsible for binding the protein to GM 1 ganglioside located on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells, while the A subunit bears enzymatic activity. LT and its B subunits are potent oral immunogens which can function also as oral adjuvants eliciting high-titer serum and secretory antibodies when administered into the gut (Houghten et al., 1985; Lipscombe et al., 1991) . Several asd \u00f7 LT-B \u00f7 plasmids allowing fusions of foreign genes to the C terminus of LT-B have been constructed (Jagusztyn-Krynicka et al., 1993) . The asd \u00f7 plasraids ensure stable in vivo maintenance in attenuated Aasd S. typhimurium vaccine strains in the absence of external selection. This is because the Aasd mutation confers a requirement for diaminopimelic acid (DAP) (which is not present in animals), such that loss of the vector leads to cell death (Nakayama et al., 1988; Galfin et al., 1990) .",

This peptide includes residues 373-398 of TGEV S protein and contains the core sequence SFF-SYGEI recognized by neutralizing MAbs specific for site D of the S protein (Posthumus et al., 1990a) . It was of interest to determine if site D would also elicit TGEV specific antibodies in swine, since this animal is the objective of a potential TGEV vaccine. Peptide D was oxidized with (NH4)2CO 3 to form cyclic monomers via a disulfide bridge between the N-and C-terminal cysteines and used to immunize rabbits and swine without coupling to a carrier protein. Animals were subcutaneously inoculated with 400 /~g of peptide in Freund's complete adjuvant (FCA) on day 1 and received subsequent boosters of 200/~ g of peptide on days 35 and 57. Samples of sera were taken on day 65 and assayed by RIA against TGEV and peptide D as described (Sanz et al., 1985) . Both rabbit and swine sera bound to the synthetic peptide D and to TGEV (Table 1) . All the animals seroconverted. Furthermore, the specific TGEV antibodies raised in both animal species had neutralizing activity against the virus. Neutralization index was measured as previously Table 1 TGEV and peptide D specific antibody titers and neutralization index in sera from peptide D immunized animals a aTwo-month old rabbits (New Zealand White) and 2-month old haplotype defined miniature swine (Sachs et al., 1976) were used. bSamples of sera (day 65) were pooled in each case (n = 3). CRIA titer is expressed as the -log~o of the last dilution that bound 3-fold the background radioactivity. dNeutralization index was determined by dividing the number of PFU of virus per ml mixed with non-immune serum by the number of PFU of virus per ml in the presence of immune serum. N.I. is expressed as the lOglo of this ratio.",

LT-B was selected to be fused to site D sequence to enhance the immunogenicity of this epitope for oral administration. It was also of interest to express multiple repeats of site D fused to LT-B to increase the immunogenicity of this epitope. Two synthetic complementary oligonucleotides encoding residues 371-400 of TGEV S protein, corresponding to site D sequence, were hybridized, cloned into the asd + LT-B expression plasmid pYA3048 (asd + LT-B +) (Jagusztyn- Krynicka et al., 1993) , and electroporated into the restriction negative, modification positive strain S. typhimurium hsdLT hsdSA hsdSB Aasd Z3730 (pYA232) . The vector:insert ratio used in the ligation was 1:10 in order to obtain a collection of recombinant plasmids in which the LT-B genes were fused to a variable number of sequences of site D combined in the two possible orientations. The nucleotide sequence of site D that was cloned (5'-ATCTCCT-GTTACACCGTTTCCGACTCCTCCTTCTTCT-CCTACGGTGAAATCCCGTTCGGTGTTAC-CGACGGTCCGCGTTACTGCTACGTT-3') was not exactly the same as that of the S gene from TGEV genome, since some triplets present in the viral sequence were substituted for other synonymous triplets of high frequency of use in Enterobacteriaceae. The fusion of site D sequence to LT-B was done to the carboxyl end of this molecule through a linker coding for 6 amino acids containing two prolines, in order to preserve the molecular properties of LT-B, such as pentamerization and GM1 binding (Jagusztyn- Krynicka et al., 1993) .",

Fifty pl of several dilutions of sera or intestinal secretion from the inoculated rabbits were added to wells and incubated at room temperature for 3 h. Direct incubation with 125I-labeled protein A was used to determine the IgG response. Duplicates of the intestinal secretion samples were incubated with goat anti-rabbit sIgA (Cappel) as a second antibody prior to incubation with 125I-labeled protein G in order to determine the IgA response. One third of the rabbits that received the recombinant bacteria showed TGEV specific antibodies in both serum and intestinal secretion ( Fig. 3A and Fig.  3B ), indicating that both systemic and secretory immunity had been induced in these animals. In serum the response was of the IgG isotype, while in intestinal secretion only IgA was induced. The antibodies induced in intestinal secretion showed a neutralization index of one logarithmic unit above the control, while in serum no neutralizing activity was detected, probably due to the low antibody titer. Samples of intestinal secretions were diluted 1:10 in PBS supplemented with fetal calf serum 2% and used in the neutralization assay as it has been previously described (Jim6nez et al., 1986) . Both strains of bacteria used in the experiment also induced Salmonella specific antibodies in serum and secretions of all the inoculated animals (results not shown) In this study, recombinant bacteria expressing a TGEV epitope fused to LT-B has induced antibodies that recognize viral particles in orally inoculated rabbits. A similar epitope derived from site D fused to E. coli CS31 capsule-like antigen also induced TGEV specific antibodies when the purified recombinant product was used to immunize mice. Live bacteria expressing this hybrid protein, however, failed to induce antibodies that recognized virus particles when inoculated intraperitoneally in mice (Bousquet et al., 1994 ). An effective vaccine against TGE requires the induction of secretory immunity in swine. The recombi-nant vectors tested in this work induced a TGEV neutralizing response in intestinal secretions which makes them suitable candidates to be tested as oral vaccines in swine. The immunogenicity of these recombinant vectors in orally inoculated swine will be investigated using containment facilities for large animals with a P3 safety level.",

Characterization of a purified LTB-site D recombinant product and its constitutive expression in S. typhimurium. (A)Purification of pYALTB-D V expression product by preparative PAGE-SDS and electroelution from IPTG induced S. typhimurium Z3730. The total amount of protein was determined in every step of the purification procedure by PAGE-SDS and AgNO 3 staining(lanes 1 and 3). In parallel, the presence of pYALTB-D expression product in each sample was determined by Western blot analysis with site D-specific MAbs(lanes 2 and 4). Lanes 1 and 2, total protein after precipitating a lysate of the recombinant bacteria with (NH4)2SO 4 (100 mg/ml); lanes 3 and 4, total protein after cutting and electroeluting a polyacrylamide band containing expression product. (B) Constitutive expression of LTB-site D in S. typhimurium Z3987. This strain was electroporated with recombinant plasmid pYALTB-D V and the expression of the LTB-site D fusion product was analyzed by Western blot with site D-specific MAbs (1). S. typhimurium X3730 (pYALTB-D) V was used as a positive control (2). S. typhimurium Z3987 (pYA3048) was used as a negative control and it was not recognized by site D-specific MAbs (results not shown). Samples were not heated in order to study oligomer formation. M, molecular mass markers. performed in order to evaluate both the IgG and IgA response. Briefly, 0.25/tg of partially purified TGEV (PUR 46-MAD strain) was adsorbed to each well of a polyvinyl disposable flat-bottom plate (Titertek, Flow Laboratories) diluted in 50 /tl of PBS, by overnight incubation at 37\u00b0C.",
