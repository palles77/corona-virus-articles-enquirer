Polio eradication and elimination of measles and rubella from the Americas is a result of successful collaboration, made possible by timely supply of affordable vaccines. After decades of intense competition for high-value markets, collaboration with developing countries has become critical, and involvement of multiple manufacturers as well as public-and private-sector investments are essential, for developing new vaccines against emerging infectious diseases. The recent Zika virus outbreak and the accelerated Ebola vaccine development exemplify the need for international partnerships to combat infectious diseases. A new player, Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI) has made its entrance in the global health community, aiming to stimulate research preparedness against emerging infections. Face-to-face panel discussions facilitated the dialogue around challenges, such as risks of viability to vaccine development and regulatory convergence, to improve access to sustainable vaccine supply. It was discussed that joint efforts to optimizing regulatory pathways in developing countries, reducing registration time by up to 50%, are required. Outbreaks of emerging infections and the global Polio eradication and containment challenges are reminders of the importance of vaccines' access, and of the importance of new publicprivate partnerships.",

Then came small groups, such as Louis Pasteur and colleagues. Innovation subsequently became the work of a large team, sometimes spanning several corporations. Now, after decades of intense competition for high-value markets, collaboration with developing countries has become critical, and involvement of multiple manufacturers as well as public-and private-sector investments are essential. The 10-year Meningitis A project and the 30-year malaria vaccine development illustrate the efforts for developing vaccines for African epidemics. The accelerated Ebola vaccine development in 2014 required urgent collaboration between manufacturers, regulatory authorities and funding agencies to respond to and contain the emerging outbreak [2] . Following the registration of the first dengue vaccine in 2015, the most advanced dengue vaccine, a collaboration between Butantan and National Institutes of Health (NIH) [3] , encourages partnerships with DCVMs and public-sector entities. Full participation of DCVMN members in future innovative collaboration will require increased development capability, novel production processes and regulatory skills, along with equal partnerships, justified investments and national regulatory agencies (NRAs) capabilities. She concluded that commitment to public health as a joint responsibility is essential.",

Manufacturing capability and capacity for vaccines is a bottle-neck during crises, thus the effort will focus on driving vaccine manufacturing pipelines, while also funding diagnostics and therapeutics. CEPI seeks multi-year donor contributions of up to one billion dollars between 2017 and 2021 from those aligned with the strategic objectives and mission. The operating principles are: equitable access, cost coverage and shared risks and benefits. Funding from CEPI will be available to vaccine producers or consortia with a track record of bringing vaccine candidates to human clinical trials. The founders of CEPI are the governments of India and Norway, the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation, Wellcome Trust and The World Economic Forum (WEF).

To achieve it, accurate forecasting, availability of funding and appro-priate contracting with a diverse supplier base is critical. Therefore, continued engagement with DCVMs is essential. Beyond securing Expanded Programme on Immunization (EPI) vaccines, UNICEF is engaged in supply of pipeline vaccines, during outbreaks or health and humanitarian emergencies, and improving access to affordable new vaccines in middle-income countries (MICs). UNICEF supports the development of healthy markets through leveraging its procurement, transparency on pricing and building procurement capacity in countries. Pentavalent vaccine is an example of a market, which is now considered healthy, 16 years after procurement of the first dose.",

Fitzsimmons provided an overview of PAHO's technical cooperation strategies with countries in the Americas, including considerations for national decision-making on introducing new vaccines in national immunization programs. PAHO's sustainability model for immunization consists of national vaccine forecasting, national budgetary financing, legislation and the Revolving Fund mechanism which together facilitate access to vaccines. After four decades of experience, this model has proven to be effective: the Americas enjoy high immunization coverage for traditional and new vaccines. The success of the PAHO Revolving Fund has been enabled by the high-level commitment from member countries, its business model and the high-quality vaccines supplied by DCVMs and other suppliers (Fig. 1 ). A panel discussion moderated by J. Chu, from CHAI, focused on management decisions that can contribute to increased success and greater commercial viability of vaccines. Vaccine manufacturing is a critical component of global health, but it comes with risks. One example is the decline in success rate of clinical trials for pharmaceuticals, including vaccines, over the past 20 years [7] . Both scientific and management factors contribute to four risk categories: 1 -Large potential return/High Feasibility e.g. innovative Respiratory Syncytial Virus (RSV) and Group B Streptococcus (GBS) vaccines; 2 -Small potential return/ High feasibility; 3 -Large market opportunity/ Low feasibility; 4 -Small market opportunity/ Low feasibility (Fig. 2) and emphasized that a balanced portfolio is critical to ensure that companies remain viable.",

Biological E, for example, takes pride in supporting EPI needs of India as well as Gavi countries. There are also few follow-on vaccines and limited new product introductions, so many companies end up with similar pipeline. Both under-capacity and over capacity of supply influence sustainability for customers and manufacturers respectively. Pentavalent vaccine is a prime example of over-capacity, as the demand is now divided among a larger group of manufacturers. Reduction in market shares will challenge manufactures' sustainability as their business models depend on reasonable market shares. MICs have unique characteristics, such as size of birth cohort, ability to procure, local registration requirements and reluctance to join pooled procurement. However, they are seeking vaccines at Gavi prices posing another challenge to manufacturers' sustainability. High-income countries have different barriers to entry, requiring heavy investments, due to the need for more clinical trials. Access to funding for vaccine development is also getting increasingly difficult as it takes about 6 years for a vaccine to reach the market, and most investors prefer faster and higher returns.",

Eradication of poliovirus is a global endeavour and can only be achieved by engaging all stakeholders. The globallysynchronized switch from trivalent (type 1, 2, 3) OPV to bivalent OPV (type 1, 3) in April 2016 [14] started the poliovirus type-2 containment period to eliminate vaccine-derived type 2 poliovirus (VDPV2) infection. However, there have been delays: poliovirus production facilities, research facilities and repositories should have demonstrated implementation of GAPIII, and National Authorities for Containment (NACs) should have certified containment. This has not been realized in many countries due to lack of national regulatory frameworks to implement containment.

From December 2015 to March 2016, 650 million doses of OPV (tOPV and bOPV) were delivered in a timely manner for planned activities. Towards tOPV cessation, however, perceptions of risk increased among both suppliers and programme managers. An industry survey emphasized the necessity for involving suppliers from early stages of decision-making for final OPV cessation to allow for integration into their strategies and ensure sufficient supply. The recent polio outbreak in Nigeria required 200 million vaccine doses. DCVMs provided a large quantity through flexibility, stockpiles and response capacity. Due to a shortage of IPV, UNICEF is not currently able to meet the WHO recommendation of at least one IPV dose in all countries. Therefore, in October 2016, SAGE recommended a fractional-dose IPV (fIPV: one-fifth of the normal IPV intramuscular dose delivered intradermally) [15] , and catch-up on IPV vaccination when it becomes available. Currently 43 countries do not have access to IPV [16] .",

Further, it also interferes with immune responses to type 1 and 3 polioviruses. In response to the shortage of IPV, WHO has recommended two doses of fIPV delivered intradermally at 6 and 14 weeks, along with routine bOPV as well as campaign immunization. IPV supply constraints are expected to remain an issue until 2018. BMGF priorities include reliable supply of bOPV, introducing and maintaining IPV in routine immunization, and assessing the potential of new mucosal-immunity enhancing adjuvants and more genetically stable OPVs.",
