Recurring outbreaks of EV71 have been reported in several countries. The current lack of approved anti-EV71 therapy has prompted intense research into antiviral development. Several strategies -ranging from target-based chemical design to compound library screenings -have been employed, while others revisited compound series generated from antiviral developments against poliovirus and human rhinoviruses. These efforts have given rise to a diversity of antiviral candidates that include small molecules and nonconventional nucleic-acid-based strategies. This review aims to highlight candidates with potential for further clinical development based on their putative modes of action.",

While efforts to eradicate poliovirus through vaccination programs have limited the number of polio-endemic countries to just four (Afghanistan, India, Nigeria and Pakistan) [2], EV71 has emerged as an important non-polio neurotropic enterovirus. EV71 was first isolated from patients with central nervous system diseases in California between 1969 and 1974 [3]. The same authors also described the EV71 prototype strain, BrCr, isolated from a twomonth-old patient who presented with aseptic meningitis. Since then, EV71 outbreaks have been reported in several countries beyond North America, including Taiwan, Australia, Malaysia and Singapore [4]. These outbreaks have mainly involved young children, with most cases displaying mild, self-limiting hand, foot and mouth disease; however, EV71 outbreaks have also been associated with a variety of severe neurological complications that can deteriorate rapidly to involve cardiopulmonary failure with high mortality rates. Transmission of EV71 can occur rapidly via the fecal-oral and droplet and/or aerosol routes. During the largest EV71 outbreak to date, in Taiwan in 1998, more than 100,000 children were affected, with 405 severe cases involving neurological or cardiopulmonary complications, of which 78 were fatal [5] .",

The recent characterizations of EV71 receptors have opened the door to the development of antiviral strategies targeting EV71 entry into host cells. At least three cellular receptors for EV71 have been reported to date. Human scavenger receptor class B, member 2 (SCARB2) was described as a receptor for EV71 strains from all three genogroups (A, B and C) [17] . SCARB2 is a type III double-transmembrane protein primarily located in endosomes, although surface expression of SCARB2 has also been demonstrated [17] . The second EV71 receptor, human P-selectin glycoprotein ligand-1 (PSGL-1/ CD162), is a sialomucin membrane protein expressed mainly in leukocytes, including dendritic cells and macrophages [18] . PSGL-1 was postulated to facilitate the viremic phase of EV71 by enabling replication in circulating leukocytes [19] . Using monoclonal antibodies targeting different parts of PSGL-1, the authors identified the N-terminal region as a crucial interaction site for EV71. The sialic acid residue of PSGL-1 might also be important for EV71 interaction. In the study by Yang et al. [20] , sialidase removal of sialic acid residues from plasma membrane proteins was able to protect EV71-susceptible DLD-1 intestinal cells from infection. In another study, EV71 was found to infect immature dendritic cells via DC-SIGN. Infection was reduced by up to 50% when anti-DC-SIGN antibody was used to block DC-SIGN [21] .",

Likewise, soluble PSGL-1, monoclonal antibodies targeting the Nterminal of PSGL-1 [19] and sialylated glycans purified from human milk [20] displayed dose-dependent inhibition of EV71 in co-infection and pretreatment experiments. Unfortunately, these were unable to inhibit EV71 infection completely at the highest concentrations tested, suggesting the involvement of multiple receptors during EV71 infection. This can be addressed in the future by the combined administration of inhibitors targeting different EV71 receptors. The potential discovery of more EV71 receptors in the future (in particular, neural-specific receptors) might eventually lead to the development of effective receptor inhibitors that can prevent EV71-induced neuropathology.",

Some of the more prominent series of capsid-binding compounds include the WIN series from Sterling-Winthrop (e.g. Pleconaril) [23] , the SCH series from Schering Plough (e.g. SCH 48973) [24] and R 77975-related compounds from the Janssen Research Foundation (e.g. Pirodavir) [25] . Although antiviral activity was claimed for a broad spectrum of picornaviruses, EV71 was notably absent from the list of picornaviruses tested in these studies. The characteristics and clinical developments of picornavirus capsid-binding molecules are detailed in several comprehensive reviews [9, 13, 15] . After the 1998 Taiwan outbreak of EV71, Pleconaril was tested against EV71 but failed to prevent virus-induced cytopathic effects in cell cultures [26] . In view of the emergence of EV71 as a clinically important picornavirus, there is a need to re-evaluate more of these compounds against EV71.",

A compound, 10b, was identified as a potent inhibitor with EC 50 of 0.018 mM while showing no toxicity (CC 50 > 25 mM). Further studies are needed to evaluate the compound's efficacy in vivo. More recently, rupintrivir was shown to inhibit EV71 with an EC 50 of 0.8 mM using a real-time, cell-based fluorescence resonance energy transfer assay and plaque reduction assay [46] . Compound 1, an orally bioavailable 3C pro inhibitor developed in parallel with rupintrivir, also showed in vitro antiviral properties against several other human enteroviruses and should also be evaluated for anti-EV71 properties [47] .",

Several theories have been proposed, including host immune-mediated inflammation of the central nervous system (CNS) and neural apoptotic cell death as EV71 infection spreads to the CNS [80] . A murine study reported retrograde axonal transport to be the major transmission route for EV71 neuroinvasion, in contrast to a hematogenous transmission with virus crossing the blood-brain barrier. Skeletal muscle was found to serve as an important site for viral replication and entry into the CNS via peripheral nerves innervating the infected site [81] . In fatal EV71 infection cases, patients usually present with three to five days of fever, headache, oral ulcers and vesicular rashes on hand, foot or buttocks that test positive for EV71 before rapid deterioration to severe disease [82] . The lag time between primary infection to severe neural disease might prove to be an important window of opportunity for antiviral intervention. Although the neuropathogenesis of EV71 would argue for a systemic antiviral that can cross the blood-brain barrier, other routes of administration might also prove to be useful in preventing EV71 neuroinvasion and transmission by inhibiting EV71 replication at other sites of infection (e.g. skeletal muscle, gastrointestinal lining and vesicular rashes on the skin).",
