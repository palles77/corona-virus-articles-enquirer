Princeton mice were consistently resistant. Intraperitoneal injection in Swiss mice was generally followed by focal or diffuse necrosis of the liver but was not attended by nervous manifestations. On intracerebral injection the virus produced significant changes in the brain, with some destruction of nerve cells. Lymphocytic infiltration was commonly observed in brain sections but polymorphonuclear leukocytes were absent. Lesions produced in the liver, following carriage of the virus from the brain, were generally focal in character. The death rate was variable. In one series of passages, 12 of 25 mice died between the 3rd and the 5th day after injection. Survival after the 3rd day was irregularly attended by paralysis of the hind legs. The most common sign was a rigid backward extension of one or both limbs. The affected leg was functionless and was dragged by the mouse in moving. This type of paralysis was observed in 9 of the 25 mice. At autopsy on the 5th or 6th day, 5 of them were erect and active while 4 were prone and unable to move. A tendency to roll sideways, if lightly prodded, was observed in one of the latter mice. All of the cranially injected animals showed weight losses of 1 to 3 gin.",

By the 3rd transfer, leukocytes were demonstrable in direct films 179 and later in sections from the brain. A cerebral suspension prepared from the mice of the 5th transfer yielded a pure growth of PPLO. The passage series was continued with a Coors filtrate of the contaminated suspension and subsequently maintained in the absence of PPLO. In 1938, Sabin (2) described a nervous disorder of mice that appeared during the cerebral passage of toxoplasma. The characteristic sign was a rolling motion on the long axis of the body. It was also observed after intraabdominal and intrathoracic injection. The incidence was 20 to 40 per cent. Two kinds of brain lesions were found in sections. The first one was indicated by destruction of the periventricular tissue and extensive leukocytic infiltration. It was present in all mice. The second lesion, consisting of almost complete necrosis and lysis of the posterior pole of the cerebellum, occurred only in mice with rolling signs.",

The disease was fully reproduced by intracerebral injection of the agent in pure culture. If grown in glucose-serum broth the organism produced a true exotoxin which resulted in the same nervous signs and cerebellar lesion on intravenous injection. Findlay et al. (4) , also in 1938, noted that mice injected intracerebrally, in series, with a neurotropic strain of yellow fever virus developed nervous signs within 2 days, instead of 4 to 5 days. Rolling with a sideways motion was observed in some of the mice. An agent that was not cultivable in ordinary media was separated from the brain but was subsequently lost on passage.",

There was no indication of specificity in relation to the type of PPLO, as earlier reported by Findlay et al. (4) . Multiplication of the virus in the brain was a prerequisite but encephalitis was not essential.

The outer horn of the ganglion showed marked nerve cell destruction which is not well brought out by the black and white print. There was no ventricular distension. X 20.5. FIG. 3. Hydrocephalic reaction in cerebrum of a mouse injected with PPLO and agar. The ground substance was compressed and displaced by the greatly distended ventricles. Lymphocytes were scattered throughout these spaces but leukocytes were absent. X 6.3. FIG. 4. Inflammatory reaction in cerebrum of a mouse injected with PPLO and agar. The circumscribed area between the bilateral horns contained both lymphocytes and mononuclear cells, as well as leukocytes. There was no destruction of nerve cells in the ganglia. X 20.5. FIG. 5. Cerebellar reaction in a mouse injected with MHV(C) and the B strain of PPLO. This mouse was a \"roller.\" In the central portion there was practically complete destruction of nerve cells. Along the outer margin of this area was a band of migratory cells, chiefly leukocytes. )< 20.5.",
