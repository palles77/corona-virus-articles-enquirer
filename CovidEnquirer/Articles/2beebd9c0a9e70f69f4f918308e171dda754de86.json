            "text": "A reverse transcription multiplex real-time PCR (RT-MRT-PCR) was developed for rapid detection and genotyping of classical swine fever virus (CSFV). The universal primers and specific TaqMan probes for each of the three genotypes, genotypes 1, 2, and 3, were designed within the 3 -UTR of the CSFV. Non-CSFV swine virus and clinical samples from specific pathogen-free (SPF) pigs were both demonstrated to be CSFV-negative by RT-MRT-PCR. The diagnostic sensitivity of RT-MRT-PCR was determined to be 1 viral copy/l for each genotype of standard plasmid. For the analytical sensitivity experiment, 100 samples of 14 CSFV genotype 1 strains and 86 samples from CSFV outbreak farms were all detected as CSFV-positive by RT-MRT-PCR, and the genotype results were consistent with the results of sequencing from a previous study. The intra-assay and inter-assay variations of RT-MRT-PCR were below 3% in all experiments. The sensitivity of RT-MRT-PCR was the same as the reverse transcription nested PCR (RT-nPCR) and higher than reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) and viral isolation from clinical samples. This assay was used further to evaluate the duration of viremia of wild-type CSFV in vaccinated exposed pigs. The results indicated that pigs vaccinated with the E2 subunit vaccine had longer viremia than pigs given the Cstrain vaccine, which is compatible with the findings of previous studies. Thus, the new RT-MRT-PCR is a rapid, reproducible, sensitive, and specific genotyping tool for CSFV detection.",

The genus pestivirus, including CSFV, BVDV, and BDV, can be differentiated by the sequences of their 5 -UTR fragments (Hofmann et al., 1994) . At the genetic level, CSFVs can be divided into genotypes 1, 2, and 3, based on the partial sequences of the E2 and NS5B genes. Each genotype can be classified further into three or four sub-genotypes, referred to as 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3; 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3; and 3.1, 3.2, 3.3, and 3.4, respectively (Paton et al., 2000) .",

            "text": "Detailed genetic information about CSFV field isolates can be used to form an important database for molecular epidemiology of CSFV, which allows for a greater understanding of the origin of CSFV as well as for improvements in eradication programs against CSF (Vilcek and Nettleton, 2006) . Currently, CSF is still spreading gradually and evolving worldwide. In Europe, all CSFV strains were genotype 1 prior to the 1970s, but the various sub-genotype strains 2.1, 2.2, and 2.3 were isolated from different European countries during the 1980s and 1990s (Paton et al., 2000; Stegeman et al., 2000; Biagetti et al., 2001) . CSF is still endemic currently in various European countries. In Latin America, only strains of genotype 1 have been reported thus far, and sub-genotypes 1.1, 1.2, and 1.3 are circulating currently within that region (Paton et al., 2000; Pereda et al., 2005; Sabogal et al., 2006) . In Asia, CSF epidemics are also fairly ubiquitous and strains of genotypes 1, 2, and 3 have been isolated in different Asian countries (Paton et al., 2000; Blacksell et al., 2005) . In Taiwan, all CSFV strains were found to be subgenotype 3.4 prior to 1996. However, genotype 2 strains of CSFV, identified as sub-genotype 2.1 or 2.2, have been isolated since 1994 and have replaced gradually the sub-genotype 3.4 strain (Pan et al., 2005) . Currently, genotyping of isolated CSFV is based on the amplification of the E2 and NS5B sequences by reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR), which requires nucleotide sequencing for further confirmation and takes approximately 2-3 days for completion. From the perspective of CSF control, a more rapid and accurate method for viral detection and genotyping is essential for the emergency responses to the disease outbreak. Reverse transcription multiplex real-time PCR (RT-MRT-PCR) has been successfully demonstrated for simultaneous detection of many pathogens, including BVDV (Baxi et al., 2006) , dengue virus (Lai et al., 2007) , influenza virus (Payungpom et al., 2006) , yellow fever virus, Japanese encephalitis virus, West Nile virus, and St. Louis encephalitis virus (Chao et al., 2007) . The aim of this study was to develop RT-MRT-PCR for the detection and genotyping of CSFV.",

RT-MRT-PCR has the ability to identify the genotypes of clinical samples much more quickly than a sequencing assay. This method was used for a retrospective study of the epidemiology of CSFV that occurred in Taiwan from 1989 to 2003, and all results were consistent with the sequencing analysis (Table 2) . However, there is difficulty in utilizing RT-MRT-PCR in areas that are endemic for wild-type CSFV genotype 1 virus and are using currently the attenuated CSFV genotype 1 vaccine, such as C-strain, to control CSFV. In this case, the G1 probe is not able to differentiate between the wild-type and attenuated CSFV genotype 1 vaccine virus using the RT-MRT-PCR products, except when further electrophoresis of the RT-MRT-PCR products is applied (Pan et al., 2008) . The difference in product size is due to the 3 -end sequences of the attenuated CSFV genotype 1 vaccine strains, which contain a T-rich insertion that the wild-type CSFV lacks (Pan et al., 2008) .",

It has been widely considered that real-time PCR is one of the most sensitive methods for CSFV detection, more sensitive than the methods of viral isolation, antigen ELISA, RT-PCR, and RT-nPCR (Hoffmann et al., 2005; Haegeman et al., 2006; Depner et al., 2007) . It was shown that the sensitivity of RT-MRT-PCR is comparable to those of RT-nPCR and viral isolation, and higher than RT-PCR for the samples of CSFV diluted serially (Table 4 ). However, it was also found that among the 68 CSFV-negative samples of clinical samples tested by viral isolation, 7-11 samples were detected as CSFV-positive by RT-PCR, RT-nPCR, and RT-MRT-PCR (Table 5 ). The false-positive samples were repeated three times by RT-PCR, RT-nPCR, and RT-MRT-PCR and the sequenced PCR products were all highly homologous to the attenuated lapinized C-strain (data not shown). The results indicated that RT-MRT-PCR, RT-PCR, and RT-nPCR have higher sensitivity than viral isolation for clinical samples. The discrepancy in the sensitivity of those methods between samples of CSFV diluted serially and clinical samples could be due to the different detection targets of each method. The detection targets for viral isolation are infectious CSFV, whereas those for RT-PCR, RT-nPCR, and RT-MRT-PCR are all nucleic acids isolated from CSFV. The detection of infectious CSFV by viral isolation is affected by several factors, including the viral stage, anti-CSFV antibody, storage stage of clinical samples, and stage and type of cell lines used, resulting in lower positive results than expected. However, it must be noted that molecular assays cannot replace completely viral isolation. This is due to the fact that the presence of viral genetic materials detected by molecular assays does not represent viral infectivity. For example, the viral genetic material may be isolated from inactive viruses trapped in, for example, the phagocytic cells or immune complexes, in addition to infectious viruses. On the other hand, the sensitivity of the RT-nPCR was equivalent to the RT-MRT-PCR; however, the RT-nPCR has lower reproducibility than that of the RT-MRT-PCR (data not shown) and requires a longer processing time than RT-MRT-PCR. Thus, the RT-MRT-PCR is a superior method for CSFV detection as compared to virus isolation, RT-PCR, and RT-nPCR.",

These data are in agreement with the shorter duration of viremia in the viral challenged-pigs with C-strain group vaccination, as compared to that with the E2 subunit group in this RT-MRT-PCR study and previous studies. Previous studies have demonstrated that vaccination with the C-strain vaccine could induce complete protection against subsequent CSFV challenge (Ferrari, 1992; Uttenthal et al., 2001; van Oirschot, 2003; Suradhat et al., 2007) , in which neither viremia nor viral shedding was observed in vaccinated pigs that had been challenged 1 week after vaccination. However, the pigs vaccinated with C-strain in this study showed a further transient viremia in the plasma at 8 DPC (Table 4) . It was also found that viremia in E2 subunit vaccinated pigs was similar to C-strain results in that vaccinated exposed pigs in our experiment had longer durations of viremia than those in other studies. A period of wild-type CSFV viremia in pigs treated with the E2 subunit vaccine was detected by RT-MRT-PCR (Table 6 ). This period was longer than the one reported in the study by Uttenthal et al. (2001) in which either complete protection or only transient viremia at 6 days post-infection was detected. The differences in the viremic periods of wild-type CSFV in this study and previous studies might be due to the different challenge methods used or the different sensitivities of the methods of detection used.",

It has been shown that pigs vaccinated with a dose of less than 100 TCID 50 or 1/100 dose of C-strain viral particles do not develop complete protection and often have viremia and viral shedding after challenge with virulent CSFV (Jong et al., 1988 (Jong et al., , 1989 . In Taiwan, there are two types of commercial C-strain vaccines, which are prepared either from cell cultures or from visceral organs of rabbits. The viral titer of the cell culture-derived C-strain vaccine can be evaluated and titrated during its preparation; however, such a procedure cannot be performed in the preparation of the C-strain vaccine from the visceral organs of rabbit. According to official regulations, the viral load per dose of cell culture-derived C-strain vaccine must contain at least 10 3.5 of 50% of the fluorescence assay infected-dose (FAID50), but no official regulations have been established for the rabbit visceral organ-derived vaccine. The 10 3.5 FAID50 is equivalent roughly to 10 6.6 viral copy, as determined by the RT-MRT-PCR used in this study (data not shown). The lack of any evaluation systems and official regulations on rabbit visceral organ-derived C-strain vaccine may have certain negative impacts on the quality of this kind of vaccine. This may result in further adverse effects on the CSFV prevention program in the field. The RT-MRT-PCR was also used for evaluation of the viral load on all available commercial C-strain vaccines in Taiwan, including two cell culture-derived vaccines and six rabbit visceral organ-derived vaccines. These results indicate that none of the commercial C-strain vaccines have met the minimum requirement of the official regulation. The established RT-MRT-PCR could be utilized to evaluate not only the quality of the rabbit visceral organ-derived C-strain vaccine, but it could also be used as an alternative for monitoring the quality of cell culturederived C-strain vaccine. However, since real-time PCR does not differentiate between infective and non-infective viral particles, then if the viral copy number in the vaccines tested, determined by RT-MRT-PCR, meets the official regulation, the assay measuring of viral infectivity, such as viral isolation and titration, should be a supplemental analysis to confirm the potency of the tested vaccines.",

            "text": "In summary, the RT-MRT-PCR is a rapid, reproducible, specific, and sensitive assay for the detection, quantitation, and genotype identification of CSFV. Additionally, RT-MRT-PCR can also be used in CSFV studies in various areas, including epidemiology, pathogenesis, and vaccine quality evaluation. RT-MRT-PCR appears to be more functional than all of the existing assays and may be suitable for routine laboratory diagnosis, both for the detection and the genotyping of CSFV. In the future, the two-step RT-MRT-PCR could be improved into a one-step approach in which reactions are performed generally in smaller reaction volumes and a positive control can be included to preclude false negative results.",
