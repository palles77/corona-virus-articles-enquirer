Although much has been learned from previous outbreaks, present surveillance systems have their inherent weaknesses, and recent experiences with MERS-CoV 14 show that pandemic preparedness still faces major political and scientifi c challenges. 15 An important priority for control of infectious disease is to ensure that scientifi c and technological advances in molecular diagnostics and bioinformatics are well integrated into public health. More eff ective and wider partnerships based on equity and best ethical practice, across governments, health care, academia, industry, and with the public, are essential to eff ectively galvanise economic, political and scientifi c measures required to develop core capacities, including legislation, national focal points, and pandemic planning to reduce risk of global spread and reduce the burden of respiratory tract infectious diseases. An urgent need exists to establish trusting and eff ective meaningful collaborations between countries to tackle new emerging microbial threats. This will facilitate early and rapid detection of potential pandemic infectious diseases through public health actions within the framework of the International Health Regulations. 16 outbreak and prevent human-to-human and animalto-human transmission; an appropriate management algorithm, including best-practice guidelines for accurate diagnosis, infection control, intensive care, emergency medicine, and treatment; prioritise research related to the MERS-CoV outbreak such as case-control and cohort studies, seroprevalence studies, and clinical trials; and to eff ectively monitor outbreak control activities.",
