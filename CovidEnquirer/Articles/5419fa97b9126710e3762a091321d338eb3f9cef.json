PATA recommended to travellers that the best advice regarding travel advisories was to use a wide range of sources. However, travel advisories are also announced by organisations other than governments. For example, the World Health Organization issued SARS travel advisories for a number of destinations in 2003, including parts of China, Toronto, Hong Kong and Taiwan. Universities also provide travel advisories for students and staff. For example, Australia's Griffith University maintains a travel advisory website (see www.gu.edu.au/travel/). Public pressure groups can also exert pressure on private tour companies. Australian environmental groups have been urging tourists to boycott travel to Tasmania, in a protest against the felling of native forests there (www.travelmole.com, 23/3/04).

As David Beirman stated in the opening line of his text Restoring Destinations in Crisis, the first to focus on the topic: \"No tourism destination is immune from crisis\" (2003: xiii). It could be expected that preparing contingency plans for crises would be an important element of any DMO planning. However, from the author's experience, at a RTO level at least, it is rare for such a topic to dominate much meeting time. Observations of publicly available strategic plans for NTOs and STOs also indicate contingency planning for many has not been a priority. In the quest for increased visitors and spending, which is how a DMO is ultimately judged, crisis planning may be viewed as a luxury of time if a disaster hasn't actually occurred nearby to stimulate discussion. The author is aware of one RTO that had regularly ignored pleas from the local civil defence co-ordinator to consider contingency plans in what is a recognised earthquake zone. The co-ordinator's concern was the fact that all entrances to the destination were via bridges, which risk collapse in a significant quake. This would severely impact the ability to evacuate visitors. The rationale for contingency planning was that a major earthquake was likely to strike the destination at some unknown time in the future -maybe not for 10,000 years, but maybe next week. The approaches literally fell on deaf ears at the RTO. To be fair to the tourism industry however, until recently there has also been an absence of any case studies in the literature to guide DMO crisis planning.",

However, Leslie (1999) found the even though the violence associated negative publicity of the 1970s had decreased considerably, Northern Ireland had become increasingly substitutable as a destination for U.K. travellers.

The guest editors advised the 11 published articles represented a cross section of those presented at the 1997 War, Terrorism: Times of Crisis and Recovery conference held in Dubrovnik, Croatia.

Other than war and terrorism, the most recent significant man-made disaster to impact negatively on the tourism industry was the 1997/1998 Asian Economic Crisis. Heavy, and some would argue reckless, short term borrowing by banks and businesses in the region for investments in real estate and the share market were poorly managed (Henderson 2002) . Consequently, the withdrawal of capital and loss of confidence in the region's financial sector created a domino effect through national economies, which at one point created fears of a collapse of the world economy. Prior to the economic crisis, the Asia-Pacific region was experiencing the world's fastest growth in international visitor arrivals. For example, Asia Pacific had been the world's fastest growing tourism region, increasing its share of international arrivals from 1% in 1960 to 13% in 1992 13% in (PATA 1996 . PATA had forecast the region to grow at 7.5% per annum until 2000 and then 6.5% until 2010. International tourist arrivals were expected to increase to 101 million in 2000 and 190 million in 2010. The immediate effect of the crisis on tourism was a reduced growth of 1% in arrivals in 1997 and a loss of 1% in 1998 (WTO 1998 , 1999 , in Henderson 2002 . As a result of the boom in intra-regional travel within the Asia-Pacific region many businesses became over exposed to markets within the region, and paid the price when the crisis emerged.",

During October 2003 there was violent rioting in the streets in leading Jamaican destination, Montego Bay (www.eturbonews.com, 28/10/03). A month earlier, the tranquil Maldives was hit by rioting that led to late-night curfews (www.travelmole.com, 23/9/03). Arguably, violent crimes such as these are representative of a management failure by government to manage security. Excessive crime and unruly behaviour can affect the image of a destination, and crime against visitors has led to negative reputations for many urban destinations around the world. For example, violent crimes in Miami and Orlando reached such a level in 1993 that they caused a decrease in visitor arrivals to the entire state (Pizam 1999). Dimanche & Lepetic (1999) provided a case study of the impact of crime levels on tourism in New Orleans, where the murder rate was eight times the national average and five times that of New York. In 1997 the New Orleans CVB hired an outside consultant to develop a marketing plan to address the negative crime image of the city. However, Dimanche and Lepetic found that while the tourism industry in the city was under siege from a high crime rate, there was a lack of concern among the tourism community, due to no noticeable drop in revenues. They strongly urged operators to heed the warning signals before the situation became a crisis.",

Tourism is a key element of the local economy, employing one in every five workers. In 1978, two hundred delegates at a New Zealand Travel and Holidays Association branch meeting reached consensus that Rotorua was losing its \"oomph\" in tourism against other centres (Stafford 1988). However, denial from local government was strong in the mid-1980s, perhaps best encapsulated in a quote by then Mayor John Keaney: \"It is in the interests of other centres to carry out a vendetta against Rotorua to put tourists off coming here\" (Rotorua Daily Post, 13/8/86). Keaney's comments came in the wake of a report in Wellington's Dominion newspaper under the heading \"Death of a Tourist town,\" and an associated national television news item. The frustration of local tourism operators was so bad by 1988 that the industry co-operative that was contracted to the council to undertake destination promotion resigned en masse and withdrew from the council contract.

Changes in international arrivals led to a greater diversification of the market. Prior to this, tourism in New Zealand had mostly focused on \"passive sightseeing of a range of natural scenic resources\" (Cushman 1990: 13) . Rotorua tourism operators had relied on the district's status as the country's most popular holiday area and prominence in NTO promotions overseas. At this time, Pearce (p. 40) claimed that at the time overseas marketing by the New Zealand regions had been limited to \"modest campaigns on the East Coast of Australia.\" Also, the Government Tourist Bureaux (GTB), including the Rotorua branch, were sold in 1990. The GTB had been the main tourist information office in Rotorua since 1903, almost the last remaining icon of the Rotorua tourism industry's strong reliance on central government. This reliance on government left Rotorua tourism interests unprepared for the new era of competition and market changes.

However, the CACVB plan immediately proved to be of limited value as all scenarios were based on local events such as hurricanes and floods. There was no scenario for an incident 500 miles away. Faulkner & Vikulov (2001) examined the role of a tourism disaster management plan in the case of the 1998 Australia Day flood at Katherine. Located in the Northern Territory, in Australia's tropical north, Katherine receives heavy rainfall that is a routine of the wet season. However, the 1998 flood was the worst in the town's history, inundating half of the homes, all of the CBD, and most tourism businesses. This natural disaster challenged the survival of the local tourism industry, and occurred so quickly that the Katherine Regional Tourism Association (KRTA) was involved in a surprise crisis with a very limited decision time (343):",

In 2003, Hong Kong Tourism Board executive director Clara Chong announced funding of HK$400 million for a series of special events to repair the post-SARS image of Hong Kong (www.eturbonews.com 19/8/03). The Indonesian government allocated $44.6 million for a global campaign to lure visitors back to Bali following the October 2002 bombings (Osborne 2003). The Canadian federal government pledged an additional C$15.5 million to promote Toronto and Canada as safe destinations (www.eturbonews.com, 17/6/03). The Florida state government provided US$20 million for tourism advertising post-September 11 (Word 2003) . The Financial Times reported the Thailand government took the unusual step of promising US$100,000 to any tourist catching SARS while visiting the country (www.travelmole.com, 21/5/03). Authorities made the offer due to concern over the April arrival Figures which were down by almost half, even though Thailand had been declared a SARS-free zone. The initiative followed a U.S.$100,000 SARS-free guarantee by Thai Airways.",

This, despite an average estimation they stood a 40% chance of facing a crisis. In most cases a taskforce is instigated during the crisis. For example, the PATA Bali Recovery Taskforce was established immediately following the October 2002 bombings to assist Indonesia. Within a week of the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the U.K., the BTA had set up its Immediate Action Group (Frisby 2002) . Two weeks after the September 11 terrorist strikes, the London Tourist Board (LTB) established the London Tourism recovery Group (London Tourist Board 2001 , in Hopper 2002 .

While it would be futile to attempt to predict the future (Drucker 1995) , what can be valuable is the use of scenarios. Scenario building attempts to construct views of possible futures, in an effort to better plan for uncertainty (see Johnson & Scholes 2002; Schwartz 1992) . Strategic choices can be made based on how the different scenarios might unfold. In theory, this then offers the relative security of being prepared for, to varying degrees, whatever scenario happens. Scenarios should be seen as carefully constructed plots, rather than predictions. When attempting to envision the future, assumptions must be made for each scenario. Since the assumptions are the key elements in determining the basis for each plot, the number should be kept to a minimum, to reduce complexity. For each scenario, a number of questions can be developed, including for example:",

Quarantelli (1996 ( , in Faulkner 1999 observed four key characteristics in the role of the media in U.S.A. disasters. Interestingly, the first has been a lack of disaster preparedness planning by the mass media. Second, tensions have emerged between local media and national media over disaster ownership. Third, the media have tended to selectively report activities of organisations with which they have an established relationship. Fourth, television has been prone to perpetuate disaster myths. Hopper (2002) reported that misinformation in the U.S.A. about the 2001 outbreak of foot and mouth disease in the U.K., led to perceptions the disease being a human condition and that all of England was \"closed.\" One of the greatest communication challenges was maintaining a positive outlook in destination promotion, while simultaneously promoting the negative impacts to government (83):",

During the Asian Economic crisis the STB concentrated on markets unaffected by the economic downturn (Henderson 2002) . During the U.K. foot and mouth disease outbreak in 2001 the BTA focused attention on 11 key markets (Frisby 2002). On the correct assumption that Americans would be reluctant to fly in the short term following September 11, the CACVB focused attention on cities within a 10 hour drive (Litvin & Alderson 2003) . All scheduled advertising was pulled immediately and replaced with a new campaign featuring the tagline \"A short drive down the road, a million miles away.\" Beirman (2003a) proposed DMOs facing a continuing crisis could segment the market into three distinctive categories -stalwarts, waverers/fair weather friends, and disaffected/discretionary. Stalwarts represent those likely to have solidarity with the destination. Examples include the stimulation of a \"travel local\" campaign in the U.S.A. domestic market following September 11, and the promotion by Israel to Diaspora Jews and Christian Zionists. Waverers are those who form the mainstay of the visitor market during periods of normality, and will be the first to return when a crisis is resolved. Examples include business travellers and those with an affinity for the destination. The discretionary market will select substitute destinations at the sign of any trouble that might add stress to a visit. Such holidaymakers are the major segment of tourism and will be the group most influenced by mass media reporting.",

This phenomenon has been labelled \"dark tourism\" (Lennon & Foley 2000) , and \"thano tourism\" (Seaton 1996) , where tourists visit scenes of death and disaster for reasons of remembrance, education or entertainment. Lennon and Foley's text provided examples of such sites in Europe and U.S.A., including: the death camps of Poland, World War Two occupation sites in the Channel Islands, the death site of U.S. President John F. Kennedy, war sites and the U.S. Holocaust Memorial Museum. That so many travellers are attracted to scenes of disaster is perhaps representative of our innate sense of curiosity, which in part manifests in our desire for travel to explore, rather than a purely morbid inclination. Alternatively, the visit might represent a pilgrimage or merely a photo opportunity. There has been little research however into the significance of such visits by travellers (Lennon & Foley 2000) . In some cases curiosity might be immediate to view the devastation. For example, immediately following the 2003 War in Iraq, U.K. travellers were signing up for tours of the country. A report in the Daily Express cited bookings by travellers to a tour organised by Hinterland Travel to \"see what has happened to the country\" (www.travelmole.com, 6/8/03). Although armed guards were employed to accompany the travellers, a spokesperson of the U.K. Foreign and Commonwealth Office warned against such a trip: \"Anyone organising a trip or planning to go should not do so.\" In other cases a sustained curiosity is developed. In New Zealand, disaster struck in June 1886 when Mount Tarawera erupted, destroying three Maori villages with the loss of 150 lives, and obliterating the fledgling destination's most notable tourism attraction at the time, the Pink and White terraces. This was a devastating blow for tourism (Stafford 1986) , only 40 years after the first tourist arrivals. However, by 1888 Rotorua's annual visitor arrivals were higher than pre-eruption levels (Reggett 1972 Visits to sites of death is not a modern phenomenon (Seaton 1996) . Lennon & Foley (2000: 8) arbitrarily selected the 1912 sinking of the Titanic and the First World War of 1914-1918 as the start of the modern dark tourism era. These events coincided with the introduction of cinemas:",

Immediately following events visitation to show respect for the dead is acceptable, such as following the massacre of Scottish schoolchildren at Dunblame. Often, floral tributes are laid at the site.

Unfortunately most advisories are issued against less developed countries that can ill afford the resultant tourism downturn.

For example, one politician from the Republic of Ireland labelled Britain as the \"leper of Europe\" for the negative image being tagged to the wider region (Frisby 2002). Ironically, it was London, an urban destination with minimal farming activity and no incidence of foot and mouth, which experienced the greatest negative economic impact of the foot and mouth disease (Hopper 2002). \u2022 The 1999 Izmit eruption in Turkey (see Beirman 2003a). \u2022 The 1995 Kobe earthquake. \u2022 The 1993 Sydney bushfires (see Christine 1995). \u2022 Hurricane Andrew on Florida in 1992 forced the closure of Miami Beach for a week (Portorff & Neal 1994).",
