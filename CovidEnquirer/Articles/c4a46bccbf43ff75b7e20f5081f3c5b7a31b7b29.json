To study how different glial cell types are affected by the disease process, we combine three-color immunofluorescence labeling with tritiated thymidine autoradiography on 1-t~m frozen sections of spinal cord. We use three different glial cell specific antibodies (a) to 2' 3' cyclic-nucleotide 3' phosphohydrolase (CNP) expressed by oligodendrocytes, (b) to glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) expressed by astrocytes, and (c) the 04 antibody which binds to O-2A progenitor cells in the rat. These progenitor cells, which give rise to oligodendroeytes and type 2 astrocytes and react with the 04 antibody in the adult central nervous system, were present but rare in the spinal cord of uninfected mice. In contrast, cells with the O-2A progenitor phenotype (04+ only) were increased in number at one week post viral inoculation 1. Abbreviations used in this paper: CNP, 2\"3\" \u00a2yclic-nucleotide 3' phosphohydrolase; CNS, central nervous system; GFAP, glial fibrillary acidic protein; WPI, weeks post inoculation.",

Both GFAP+ only and GFAP+, 04+ astrocytes were also increased in the spinal cord at 1 WPI. Between two and four WPI, the infected spinal cord was characterized by the loss of (CNP+, 04+) oligodendrocytes within demyelinating lesions and the presence of O-2A progenitor cells and 04+, GFAP+ astrocytes, both of which could be labeled with thymidine. As remyelination proceeded, CNP immunostaining returned to near normal and tritiated thymidine injected previously during the demyelinating phase now appeared in CNP+ oligodendrocytes. Thus 04 positive O-2A progenitor cells proliferate early in the course of the demyelinating disease, while CNP positive oligodendrocytes do not. The timing of events suggests that the O-2A progenitors may give rise to new oligodendrocytes and to type 2 astrocytes, both of which are likely to be instrumental in the remyelination process. I s small rodents, regeneration of central nervous system (CNS) ~ myelin is often efficient after a demyelinating episode (reviewed in Ludwin, 1981) . In contrast, in multiple sclerosis, the paradigm of demyelinating diseases in human CNS, remyelination is often insufficient (reviewed in Silberberg, 1986) . Thus it appears important to elucidate the exact cellular and molecular events underlying CNS remyelination.",

In contrast, recent Catherine Godfraind's present address is Service dAnatomie Pathologique, Cliniques Universitaires St we, Avenue Hippocrate 10, B1200 Bruxelles, Belgium. Victor Friedrich's present address is Brookdale Center for Molecular Biology, Box 1128 A, Mount Sinai Medical Center, One Gustav L. Levy Place, New York, NY 10029. studies have elucidated the nature of the cell lineage involved in myelination during development (reviewed in Raft and Miller, 1984; and Raft, 1989) . A bipotential progenitor cell has been demonstrated to give rise to oligodendrocytes and to type 2 astrocytes which are both involved in the construction of myelinated tracts (ffrench-Constant and Raft, 1986) . Therefore this progenitor is called the O-2A progenitor and the cells derived from these cells constitute, with their progenitor, that O-2A lineage (Raft et al., 1983b ). An antibody crucial to the identification of this lineage in optic nerve has been the A2B5 antibody which reacts with a subset of gangliosides on the cell surface (Eisenbarth et al., 1979) and was used both in vitro and in vivo to stain O-2A progenitors (Raffet al., 1983b (Raffet al., , 1984b David et al., 1984; Miller et al., 1985; Behar et al., 1988) . In vivo studies with this antibody in other parts of the nervous system have been difficult because these specific gangliosides are also expressed in neuronal components (Eisenbarth et al., 1979) .",

When 04 positive cells are sorted from the murine neonatal brain and cerebellum, they can differentiate into type 2 astrocytes or oligodendrocytes (Trotter and Schachner, 1989) . In addition, differentiated oligodendrocytes and type 2 astrocytes isolated from the CNS of adult rats and mice express the 04 antigen (Wolswijk and Noble, 1989) . The 04 antibody reacts only weakly with neurons (Schachner et al., 1981) and appears to stain glial cells of different species in a consistent way (rat, mouse, chicken, human; Sommer and Schachner, 1981 ; our own unpublished observations). In contrast, A2B5 antibody does not consistently stain putative glial precursor cells in mouse (our own unpublished observations) and human (Kim et al., 1986) . For all these reasons, we have used the 04 antibody to study O-2A lineage cells in the normal mouse spinal cord and in mice affected with a demyelinating disease. The A59 strain of mouse hepatitis virus reliably caused demyelination in C57 black mice, with a predominance of lesions in the spinal cord. (Woyciechowska et al., 1984; Lavi et al., 1984a,b; Kristensson et al., 1986) . The virus replicates exclusively in glial cells of both white and grey matter of the spinal cord in the early phase of the disease (Godfraind, C., unpublished observations; Jordan et al., 1989b) . At two weeks post inoculation (WPI), the virus becomes restricted to the white matter where demyelination occurs and, at 4 WPI, virus is mostly cleared probably because the infected mice develop a vigorous immune response to the virus (Woyciechowska et al., 1984) . Clinical recovery and myelin repair proceed efficiently in the following weeks (Woyciechowska et al., 1984) . Thus cellular events related to demyelination and to successful remyelination can be followed closely in the spinal cord of these infected mice. We have previously used in situ hybridization to study myelin basic protein gene expression in this model (Kristensson et al., 1986) . At the start of remyelination, a subset of MBP transcripts which are highly expressed in developing animals during normal myelination are increased in abundance (Jordan et al., 1989a,c) .",

We used three-color immunofluorescence labeling to show simultaneously the 04 antigens, the 2', Y, cyclic-nucleotide 3' phosphohydrolase (CNP) protein (expressed by oligodendrocytes) and the glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) (expressed by astrocytes). The use of the 1-#m frozen section technique (Tokuyasu, 1973 (Tokuyasu, , 1980 Griffith et al., 1984) allows detailed localization of each antigen in different glial cell types (David et al., 1984; Miller et al., 1985) . Using these techniques, we have identified O-2A lineage cells (Raff et al., 1984a) in the spinal cord of normal and diseased mice and followed how these cells are affected by the demyelinating disease. Our results demonstrate that rare 04 precursors present in the normal adult CNS are triggered to divide early in the disease and may give rise to new oligodendrocytes and type 2 astrocytes which both appear instrumental in the reconstruction of myelinated white matter.",

Nevertheless, some separation of elements was unavoidable in actively demyelinating specimens with abundant vacuolization. After sucrose infiltration, each piece was trimmed to an appropriate size, mounted on a specimen holder, and frozen by immersion in liquid nitrogen. The specimens were stored in liquid nitrogen until use. Transverse sections 1 pm thick were cut from those blocks using glass knives and a Reichert-Jung Ultracut E microtome with ultracr~tomy system FC4D.

Cells with these exact same antigenic phenotypes can also be isolated from these spinal cords and cultured (Armstrong, R., V. Friedrich, K. V. Holmes, and M. Dubois-Dalcq, manuscript in preparation). The in vivo morphology of the cells with each anti-genic phenotype is illustrated in Figs. 2 and 3 . The oligodendrocytes displayed CNP staining along the plasmalemma of their cell bodies and processes but not in compact myelin, as described before (Braun et al., 1988 : Trapp et al., 1988 . Thus, of the myelin sheaths, only the outer and inner cytoplasmic loops were stained (Fig. 2 b) . Most oligodendrocytes also bound 04 within the perikaryal cytoplasm (Fig. 2, filled  arrow) . As expected, more CNP+ 04+ oligodendrocytes were detected in the white than grey matter. Interestingly, a few cells which only reacted with CNP antibody were present in the grey matter, mostly in the dorsal horn. The GFAP antiserum showed intense filament staining in cytoplasmic bundles, both in cell bodies and in processes, as described (Levine and Goldman, 1988) . Many cells were stained only for GFAP; these are thought to represent type 1 astrocytes (Raft et al., 1983a) . In addition we found numerous astrocytes which stained for 04 in addition to GFAE We identify these as type 2 astrocytes (Raft et al., 1983a) (Fig. 2 , c and d and Fig. 3, c and d) . 04 staining was distributed in these cells as fine cytoplasm granules often prominent in regions of intense GFAP staining. Finally, we found 04+ C N P -GFAP-putative progenitors with a shape similar to that of oligodendrocytes. These cells were smaller than oligodendrocytes and their processes could never be followed to myelin sheaths (Fig. 3, bottom) . They were very rare in normal animals (average one per section and present only in the white matter [ Fig. 3]) .",

GFAP+ only type 1 astrocytes were scattered in grey matter as well as in deep regions of the white matter. The white matter appeared to be divided in two zones with respect to the GFAP and 04 staining. A number of radially oriented 04 + GFAP+ astrocytes were detected in the peripheral regions of the white matter. By analogy with the optic nerve Miller et al., 1985) , we had expected that the radially oriented astrocytes forming the glial limiting membrane of the spinal cord would be type 1 astrocytes unreactive with the O4 antibody. Instead we found cell bodies, radial processes, and pial endfeet strongly 04 as well as GFAP positive. These peripheral astrocytes have also been stained with the monoclonal antibody A2B5 as well as with the antibody to the GD3 ganglioside (Hirano and Goldman, 1988) and therefore exhibit the type 2 astrocyte antigenic phenotype. However, the radial glia of the spinal cord differentiates well before myelination and in that regard must be distinguished from the type 2 astrocytes described in optic nerve (Miller et al., 1985; Liuzzi and Miller, 1987) . Except for these radially oriented astrocytes at the periphery of the white matter, the other 04+ GFAP+ cells of spinal cord fulfilled both the antigenic and positional criteria for type 2 astrocytes since they were located deeper in the white matter (Miller et al., 1985; Liuzzi and Miller, 1987) . These type 2 stellate astrocytes were more frequent in the ventral zone than the dorsal zone. Their processes were much thinner than those of the peripheral radial glia (Fig. 2 d and Fig. 4 f) .",

CNPstained myelin debris was found in the extracellular space and in putative macrophages during later stages (Fig. 6, b and d). 04+ only progenitor cells similar to those seen at 1 WPI (Fig. 5 a) were now found in these lesions (Fig. 6, f and h,  arrowheads) , and were sometimes labeled by tritiated thymidine (Fig. 7) . In addition, large stellate cells expressing both 04 and GFAP were also frequent in the lesions (Fig. 6 , f and h and Fig. 7 ) compared to the normal (Fig. 6 , e and g) and occasionally incorporated thymidine (Fig. 7) . In the grey matter, the 04 + astrocytes were less prominent than at 1 wk. Their number progressively decreased to normal levels within the next few weeks. GFAP+ only astrocytes remained common and were located mostly in regions adjacent to the demyelinated areas.

We identify some of these cells as members of the O-2A lineage based on their reactivity with the 04 antibody which reacts with sulfatide and another putative glycolipid and which labels O-2A progenitors isolated from the adult rodent nervous system (Wolswijk and Noble, 1989) . In our mice, O, antibody stained cells that were also GFAP+ or CNP+, and stained other cells which were negative for both of these differentiation antigens.

GFAP+ 0 4and GFAP+ 04+ astrocytes were also more prominent throughout the spinal cord at that time. Later on, antigenic changes were mostly associated with the demyelinating lesions: while CNP reactivity disappeared, cells with 04 reactivity increased in the lesions and both putative O-2A progenitors and type 2 astrocytes were found to incorporate tritiated thymidine after a 2-h :pulse.

A CNP+ 04+ GFAP+ cell in the spinal cord of an infected mouse, 2 WPI. Such cells were found infrequently in spinal cord of infected mice but never in controls. They were most abundant at 2 WPI and were never labeled by [3H]thymidine injected shortly before killing. Bar, 10 #m. dividing. While not definitive, the evidence at hand suggests that these O4+ GFAP-C N P -cells, seen in situ for the first time, might give rise to oligodendrocytes formed in these adult animals during recovery from viral infection. Similarly, induction of oligodendrocyte proliferation and remyeli-nation after chronic demyelination in guinea pigs and multiple sclerosis has been described (Raine et al., 1988) . In addition to the 04 + only O-2A adult progenitor cell, we found increased numbers of 04+ GFAP+ cells in infected mice. Many of these cells also incorporated tritiated thymidine, as was seen previously in developing optic nerve (Miller et al., 1985) . Type 2 astrocytes are normally formed during developmental myelination, where they extend processes to the nodes of Ranvier (ffrench-Constant and Raft, 1986) ; the 04+ GFAP+ cells which proliferate in the infected animals might play the same role during remyelination. In addition, we found occasional cells with the mixed phenotype 04+ GFAP+ CNP+. The existence of this intermediate form raises the possibility that transdifferentiation of type 2 (04+ GFAP+) astrocytes might also contribute to the generation of oligodendrocytes. Interestingly, the expression of GFAP in immature oligodendroglia has been described before in the developing human spinal cord (Choi and Kim, 1984) and coexistence of the oligodendroeyte marker carbonic anhydrase and GFAP have been reported in radial Figure 9 .

Such cells were never found in control specimens. Bars: (a-c) 50 tzm; (a'-c') 20 ~m. fibers of developing spinal cord (Hirano and Goldman, 1988) . Similarly cultures of spinal cord from our remyelinating animals yield a substantial number of cells expressing both oligodendrocyte and astrocyte markers (Armstrong, R., V. Friedrich, K. V.

            "text": "The mechanisms by which CNS tissue reacts to a demyelinating virus and reconstructs myelinated and functionally ensheathed axons after a dramatic tissue destruction are completely unknown. It is likely that polypeptide factors can trigger mitosis, migration, and differentiation in vivo during remyelination just as they do in vitro. Interleukin 2 has been shown to induce proliferation and differentiation of oligodendroglial cells (Benveniste and Merrill, 1986) Whatever the polypeptide factors involved may be, the end result of the glial cell reaction to mouse hepatitis virus infection is the birth of new oligodendrocytes (see also Herndon, 1977) and efficient remyelination. We cannot exclude that some oligodendrocytes might be able to dedifferentiate, and turn off the expression of myelin protein genes but the presence of a small number of O-2A progenitors in the normal mice suggests that this pool of precursors might be amplified in the course of this demyelinating disease. CNP + oligodendrocytes persisted throughout the course of the infection in many areas not demyelinated, but we rarely saw them labeled after 2 h exposure to tritiated thymidine. Thus, in contrast to previous observations in other models in rat (Aranella and Herndon, 1984; Ludwin and Bakker, 1988), we found no evidence for proliferation of differentiated oligodendrocytes as a substantial component of response to injury. Instead, our results indicate that newly formed oligodendrocytes arise from mitotic 04 + CNP-GFAP-precursors. In vitro analysis of these cells may lead to a more detailed understanding of their behavior and the identification of signal factors which control gliogenesis during remyelination.",

In CNS extracts (CNS), 04 reacts strongly with a pair of bands identified by their migration pattern on TLC plates as sulfatides (SF). 04 reacts much more weakly with bands identified galactocerebroside (GC). The identity of a fifth band (X), intermediate in intensity, is not known. Lanes marked SF and GC contain purified sulfatide and galactocerebroside standards, respectively. Crodfraind et al. Glial Cell Phenotypes in Demyelinating Disease Figure 2. 1-#m-thick section of spi-nal cord white matter from normal mouse stained with three-color immunofluorescence. The same field is shown by phase contrast (a) and illuminated for each of the three antigens studied (b--d). Myelin shealhs can be recognized in phase contrast; they remain reasonably well compacted (a). CNP immunoreactivity (b) is absent from compact myelin but is present in rings immediately inside (left arrowhead) and outside (right arrowhead) of compact myelin. An oligodendrocyte in the section shows a rim of CNP immunoreactivity along the plasmalemma of its cell body and large process (solid arrow). O, immunoreactivity (c) is somewhat granular within processes and often surrounding the nuclei of stained cells (solid and open arrows). GFAP immunoreactivity (d) appears as bands or small dots representing radially and longitudinally oriented processes, respectively, but the label does not fill the entire cytoplasm (e.g., open arrow in c and d). Note that the 04+ GFAP+ ceils have rather thin GFAP containing processes (c and d). Bar, 10/~m.",

            "text": "and insulin-like growth factor 1 has an effect on proliferation and differentiation of 04 precursors in oligodendrocytes in the developing rat (McMorris and Dubois-Dalcq, 1988). Platelet derived growth factor is a potent mitogen for the O-2A neonatal progenitor (Richardson et al., 1988; Noble et al., 1988) but it is not known whether it also influences the growth of O-2A adult progenitors. In vitro studies have shown that O-2A neonatal and adult progenitors are migratory cells (Small et al., 1987; Wolswijk and Noble, 1989) and that adult optic nerve glia can migrate >~0.6 mm to myelinate naked axons (Wolf et al., 1986). Ciliary neurotrophic factor which is synthesized by type 1 astrocytes in vitro can induce transient GFAP expression in O-2A progenitor cells in developing optic nerve and brain cultures (Hughes and Raft, 1987; Lillien et al., 1988). Ciliary neurotrophic factor molecules are released locally in CNS tissue after a lesion (Nieto-Sampedro et al., 1983). Such factors could also be released in the spinal cord of our infected mice.",
