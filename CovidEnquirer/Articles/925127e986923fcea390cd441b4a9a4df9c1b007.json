Our flexible model and the accompanying analysis show that the traditional threshold dynamics apply. In order to control the spread of an infectious disease for which one of these paradigms applies, one can study the effect that varying certain parameters has on R 0 . If R 0 can be reduced below one, then an endemic disease can be eradicated. Disease eradication, of course, is a lofty goal and may not always be feasible. Fortunately, the model also provides a platform for performing analysis of how the level of endemicity depends on the various parameters.",

Thus, the avirulent strains can be omitted from the model.
