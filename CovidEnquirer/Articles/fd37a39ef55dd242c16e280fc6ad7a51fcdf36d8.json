Four DDX58 polymorphisms, in high LD, demonstrated also associations (after correction for FDR) with variations in both measles-specific IFN-\u2425 and IL-2 secretion in Caucasians (p \u2264 0.001, q = 0.193). Two intronic OAS1 polymorphisms, including the functional OAS1 SNP rs10774671 (p = 0.003), demonstrated evidence of association with a significant allele-dose-related increase in neutralizing antibody levels in African-Americans. Genotype and haplotype-level associations demonstrated the role of ADAR genetic variants, including a non-synonymous SNP (rs2229857/Arg384Lys; p = 0.01), in regulating measles virus-specific IFN-\u2425 Elispot responses in Caucasians (haplotype global p-value = 0.017).

However, measles is still a public health issue with approximately 164,000 deaths in 2008 worldwide [1] and with a relative increase in reported cases in several European countries and in the United States, including cases in individuals after two doses of MMR vaccine [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] . Therefore, establishing effective measles immunity across the population is crucial and requires providing both immunization coverage and surveillance to detect new cases and outbreaks [7] . Despite measles control (but not eradication), questions still remain regarding the documented 2-10% primary failure rate after vaccination, and the immunogenetic causes of vaccine response heterogeneity and/or vaccine failure. Deeper understanding of the observed inter-individual differences in immune response to measles vaccine is needed to provide new insights for improving vaccine-induced humoral, cellular, and innate immune responses, and for designing better vaccines [8, 9] .",

Cellular viral sensors, type I and III interferons (IFNs, IFN\u2423/\u2424, IFN 1, IFN 2, IFN 3) and IFN-triggered antiviral proteins have long been recognized as crucial mediators of innate antiviral defense with important effects on the magnitude and quality of innate and adaptive immune responses. Important antiviral factors and pathways, such as the retinoic acid-inducible gene I protein (RIG-I/DDX58), melanoma differentiation associated protein-5 (MDA-5/IFIH1), mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (MAVS/VISA/IPS1/CARDIF), dsRNA-activated protein kinase R (PKR/EIF2AK2), the 2 -5 -oligoadenylate-synthetase (OAS) -ribonuclease L (RNASEL) pathway, Mx protein GTPases, adenosine deaminase, RNA-specific 1(ADAR), the ISG15 ubiquitin-like pathway and others play a role in viral sensing, control, pathogenesis and outcome of viral infections [10] [11] [12] [13] . Polymorphisms in IFN-stimulated antiviral effector genes and cellular viral sensors are potential genetic determinants of immune response heterogeneity that may influence the immune responses to viral vaccines by altering the functionality and antiviral effects of the corresponding proteins. Genetic variants in these genes have been implicated as important regulators of immunity and host response to infection [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .",

We binned SNPs with a minor allele frequency (MAF) \u2265 0.05, a pairwise LD threshold of r 2 \u2265 0.90, and successful Illumina predictive genotyping scores, for the Caucasian sample and African-American sample separately, using the ldSelect program [31] . To accommodate a set of Illumina platform constraints, the SNP list was further post-processed and refined using the SNPPicker program. We also added a set of functional \"obligate\" SNPs (coding: nonsynonymous, synonymous, 5 or 3 untranslated regions) to the final list. A total of 348 SNPs across 12 antiviral genes were selected based on this approach.

Simple linear regression was used for measles antibody levels, for which we had only one measured value per individual. Repeated measures approaches were implemented for the cytokine secretion and IFN-\u2425 Elispot variables, simultaneously modeling the multiple observed measurements and using an unstructured within-person variance-covariance matrix to account for within-subject correlations. This was achieved by including the genotype variable in the regression model, together with a variable representing stimulation status. The resulting genotype-by-stimulation status interaction was then tested for statistical significance. Tests of association assumed an ordinal (logadditive) SNP effect using simple tests for trend. Because of the lack of seronegative subjects (PRMN titer < 1:8) in our cohort and the low number of subjects (68) with antibody concentrations less than the protective threshold of 210 mIU/mL (corresponding to PRMN titer of 120) [25] , our statistical approach rationale was to assess associations between SNPs and quantitative humoral/cellular immune outcomes across the entire cohort using linear regression methodologies rather than assess the distribution of SNPs across extremes of humoral/cellular immune responses (such as seronegative subjects and/or subjects with antibody concentrations less than the protective titer).",

Analysis in the Caucasian group revealed seven significant SNP associations with measles-specific IFN-\u2425 secretion, which remained significant at the q-value = 0.20 [38] after adjusting for FDR (p \u2264 0.001, q = 0.193; Table 5 ). Two MX2 intronic SNPs demonstrated an allele-dose relationship with lower IFN-\u2425 secretion levels (p \u2264 0.001). In addition, the minor alleles of four DDX58 SNPs (in high LD; for rs12555727, 12006123 and rs17289116, r 2 = 1) were associated with a significant allele dose-related decrease (approximately 30%) in secreted IFN-\u2425 in the Caucasian group (Table 5) . Interestingly, the same four DDX58 SNPs demonstrated a more than 2-fold reduction in measles-specific IL-2 secretion levels (with the representation of the minor allele) in the Caucasian group and still remained significant after adjusting for FDR (p \u2264 0.001, q = 0.193, Table 6 ). Of note, three of the DDX58 SNPs (rs12555727, 12006123 and rs17289116, r 2 = 1) were also found to be associated at the haplotype level with variations in measles-specific humoral immunity in Caucasians ( Table 4 ).",

We have previously demonstrated that specific variations in antiviral sensor genes (DDX58/RIG-I and MAVS/VISA) and key IFN-induced antiviral genes (particularly polymorphisms in the OAS gene cluster) were associated with differences in rubella vaccine-induced adaptive immunity [14] [15] [16] , while little is known regarding the importance of these genes or variations in measles-specific immunity. Furthermore, multiple previous genetic association studies revealed that polymorphisms in the MX1, OAS1, OASL and PKR genes correlate with response to IFN therapy and/or susceptibility to viruses such as WNV, HCV, HBV, SARS-coV, and measles virus [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] .",

Mitochondrial antiviral pathways involve the detection of viral RNA by cytosolic helicases belonging to the RIG-I-like helicase family (RIG-I/DDX58 and MDA5/IFIH1), and downstream signaling through interaction with the IPS-1 (VISA/MAVS/CARDIF) adaptor protein [49, 50] . In addition, vitamin A and its metabolites, which are known to affect measles replication and antibody responses after vitamin supplementation, are linked with RIG-I/DDX58 through RAR\u2423 and IFN type I-dependent mechanism [51, 52] . Genetic variants within these antiviral sensor genes were associated with different measles-specific immune outcomes in our study (including common DDX58 genetic variants regulating both antibody responses, and measles-specific IFN-\u2425 and IL-2 secretion in the Caucasian group), which is consistent with a recent report of the recognition of measles virus by RIG-I and MDA5 to instigate interferon-specific innate immune responses [53] . Interestingly, a common coding functional DDX58 polymorphism (rs10813831/Arg7Cys), known to modulate IFNB1 and DDX58 transcription in dendritic cells [54] , and suggested as a plausible regulator of rubella vaccine-induced humoral immunity [15] , was associated with measles-specific IFN-\u2423 secretion in the African-American sample, although did not remain significant after adjusting for FDR (p = 0.005, q = 0.447, data not shown).",

The interferoninduced OAS1 protein is known to catalyze the synthesis of 2 ,5 -oligoadenylates, which activate RNase L, resulting in antiviral (viral RNA degradation, inhibition of viral replication) and pro-apoptotic activities, and genetic polymorphisms in the coding genes have been linked to various immunological and infectious outcomes [21] [22] [23] [24] . The involvement of OAS genetic variants in regulating measles vaccine-immune responses is highly plausible bearing in mind that OAS genetic variations are likely involved in modulating the adaptive immune responses to live attenuated rubella vaccine [14] . Particularly convincing is the association of OAS1 SNP rs10774671, a polymorphism with established functionality, with variations in measles-specific humoral immune responses (more than 3-fold increase associated with the homozygous minor allele genotype) in the African-American sample (p = 0.003). This genetic variant is located in intron 5, at the spliceacceptor site, and has been demonstrated to regulate splicing, resulting in isoforms with different enzyme activity [39, 55] . Recent data from the literature suggests that genetic variation in OAS1 (rs10774671) can alter viral replication in human lymphoid tissue and is a risk factor for infection with West Nile virus [39] . In addition, our previous work links this same polymorphism in addition to other OAS polymorphisms with variations in rubella vaccine-induced cytokine secretion [14] .",

Our data show evidence for an association of a nonsynonymous SNP (rs2229857/Arg384Lys, in LD with other significant ADAR SNPs, r 2 \u2265 0.96) with measles virus-specific cellular immunity (IFN-\u2425 Elispot responses) in Caucasians (p = 0.01, Table 3 ). Consistent with the current findings, our previous rubella vaccine study demonstrated an increase in rubella-specific IFN-\u2425 responses (p = 0.021) with the representation of the minor allele genotype for this ADAR polymorphism [14] , which further suggests the involvement of this gene/genetic variant in immune response variations after vaccination. In addition, other regulatory and intronic SNPs within the same gene were associated at the genotype and haplotype level with variations in measles-specific cellular immunity, particularly in the Caucasian group (haplotype global p-value = 0.017, Table 4 ), implying cooperative effects of multiple SNPs in the genetic regulation of the immune outcome. This is in concert with the identification of ADAR as a critical determinant of local and systemic inflammatory responses through RNA editing and modulation of protein production [56] . It is important, however, to note that we did not find similarities between the genes/genetic variants associated with measles-specific IFN-\u2425 Elispot responses and IFN-\u2425 cytokine secretion in our analyses in Caucasians, and while the genetic associations with secreted IFN-\u2425 remained significant after adjusting for FDR, none of the SNPs associated with IFN-\u2425 Elispot responses remained significant after adjustment. Both our IFN-\u2425 assays quantify IFN-\u2425 responses, but as reported previously these assays do not correlate well with each other [57] . IFN-\u2425 Elispot measures the number of cytokine-producing cells, while the IFN-\u2425 ELISA measures the cytokine protein concentration released in the culture supernatant by virus-stimulated cells. We speculate that the lack of correlation (or weak correlation) between the two assays [57] is likely the main reason for the different genetic associations found in our analyses for these two immune outcomes.",

Viral nucleic acids stimulate the OAS-RNase L pathway resulting in RNA degradation. Viral RNA is also targeted by ADAR, which deaminates viral replication intermediates. In addition, viral RNA activates RNA helicase-like receptors, including RIG-I, to initiate signaling and transcription of IFNs (through IRFs), which feed back through their receptors to increase the expression of antiviral proteins, thus augmenting the antiviral response [10, 58] . Hence, our findings imply that key genetic variants/genes involved in the initial antiviral response to viral nucleic acids are modulating immune responses after vaccination with a live viral vaccine, likely due to alterations in viral sensing and/or direct antiviral activity that restricts viral replication and antigen load/antigenic stimulation. Although some of the genes such as DDX58, ADAR and OAS1 (and even genetic variants: OAS1 rs10774671) were found to be associated with variations in both rubella vaccine [14] [15] [16] and measles vaccine-induced immune responses in our studies, most of the identified genetic variants and association patterns appear to be virus-specific, possibly due to differences between viruses with respect to their ability to induce and/or counter some of the involved proteins and antiviral pathways [11] [12] [13] 58] .",

After correction for FDR, 15 SNPs (out of 32 reported single-SNP associations at the level p \u2264 0.01; 11 SNPs in Caucasians and 4 SNPs in African-Americans) still remained significant at the q-value < 0.20 [38] . As this is the first study assessing polymorphisms in antiviral genes and their possible effect on measles vaccine-induced immunity in a race-specific manner, we chose to also use the less stringent q-value cutoff value of 0.5 (roughly corresponding to p-values \u2264 0.01 for single-SNP associations) believing that the risk of false negatives outweighs that of false positives.",

Follow-up replication and functionbased studies are planned to validate and extend our results, and increase our understanding of the mechanisms, involved in immune response variations after measles vaccination. This will potentially inform the development of new and/or improved vaccines and support a novel paradigm of vaccine development, a concept we have called vaccinomics [9] .",
