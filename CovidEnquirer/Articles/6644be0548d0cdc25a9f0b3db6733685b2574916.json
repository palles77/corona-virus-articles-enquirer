The aim of this study was to establish the most pathognomonic radiological sign(s) to diagnose MERS CoV. Patients and methods: This is a retrospective descriptive study. All patients were subjected to serial X-ray. High resolution non-contrast CT chest was also obtained for 10 patients. The scans were reviewed for findings including consolidation, ground-glass opacities, nodules, reticular opacities and hilar and mediastinal adenopathy. Results: A total of 12 patients were included in our study with prevalence of males (2:1) with ages ranging between 18 and 76 years having an average age of 36 \u00b1 2 years. The outcome of these patients was as follows: 6 were treated with average hospital stay ranging between 21 and 35 days, one case died after 14 days, and 5 cases were transferred to Central Governmental hospital according the local authority rules. Conclusions: MERS CoV virus may have a specific pattern in chest X-ray and CT developing a single or multiple opacities progressing into a widespread multifocal bilateral patches of ground glass opacities or confluent consolidation resembling organizing pneumonia.",
