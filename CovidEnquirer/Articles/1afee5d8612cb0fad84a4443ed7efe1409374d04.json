Sixty, 28-day-old mice were divided into 4 groups and treated with streptomycin or sterile water for 2 days followed by 1 day without treatment. The control group was unchallenged whereas the mice in the other three groups were treated twice with 10 9 CFU mL \u22121 S. typhimurium. For the next 3 days, control mice continued to receive no treatment whereas the mice in the remaining three groups were orally administered with 20 mg mL \u22121 of specific IgY, 20 mg mL \u22121 of nonspecific IgY or PBS. S. typhimurium activated gut-associated lymphoid tissue, increasing the release of IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 in the mucosa and increased the number of activated T-lymphocytes and cytotoxic T-\u03b3\u03b4. Specific IgY attenuated the increase in IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 and the decrease in IL-10. S. typhimurium induced mobilization of CD8 + and CD8 + TCR\u03b3\u03b4 T cells in the epithelium and CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in the lamina propria reflecting an inflammatory process that was attenuated by IgY. These results suggest that specific IgY modulates intestinal mucosal immune responses during a S. typhimurium infection.",

This binding may block surface structures on bacteria or neutralize toxic components such as lipopolysaccharide as well as preventing the adhesion of bacteria to the target surface (e.g. epithelial cells and M cells) of the host and penetration of bacteria into deeper tissue.",

Our study highlights the interaction between IgY and the intestinal mucosal immune response during infection. Specific IgY positively modulates the intestinal mucosal immune response of organized and diffuse GALT, including reducing the lymphocyte populations in Peyer's patches, epithelium and lamina propria thus protecting these sites from possible excessive activation evoked by S. typhimurium. These effects were accompanied by an attenuation of the increase of the proinflammatory cytokines IFN-\u03b3 and TNF-\u03b1 in the intestinal mucosa. Whether or not IgY functions in other tissues remains to be determined.",
