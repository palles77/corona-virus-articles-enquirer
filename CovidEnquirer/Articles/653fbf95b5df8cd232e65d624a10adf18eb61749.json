Carcasses were stored in a cold room at 4 \u2022 C. After 1, 3, 6, 9, 12 or 24 h of storage, necropsies were carried out. Trachea, lung, kidney and rectum were collected for virus isolation by tracheal organ culture (TOC) or embryonated chicken eggs (ECE), and detection by nested reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). IBV was detected by RT-PCR at all sampling times, except for 1 and 6 h of storage in kidney and 9 h of storage in kidney and rectum. For ECE, isolation was obtained at all sampling points, except at 1 and 24 h of storage in lungs. Isolation by tracheal organ cultures was less successful, except from rectum. In addition to sampling for virus, tracheal washes were collected from each carcass to measure the ability to detect local antibodies after storage. Levels of IgA in tracheal washes remained high for up to 9 h of storage, suggesting that accurate sampling for research purposes when required must be carried out within this time.",

Diagnosis of infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is confirmed by isolation of the virus using either chicken embryonated eggs (ECE) or tracheal organ culture (TOC) and detection by reverse-transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003; Gelb and Jackwood, 1998) . Tracheal swabs, oropharyngeal swabs and tissues such as trachea, lungs, kidney, oviduct and caecal tonsils are normally used for isolation (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003; Gelb and Jackwood, 1998) . It is recommended that carcasses should be submitted to the laboratory as soon as possible but no reports are available to indicate an appropriate time limit, beyond which virus detection is impossible. This paper provides information on the probability of IBV recovery from target tissues in carcasses stored at 4 \u2022 C for up to 24 h post-killing. Three different methods of demonstrating the presence of IBV, namely isolation by TOC or ECE, and detection by nested RT-PCR were used.",

This suggests that in difficult circumstances, necropsy examination and tissue collection of carcasses kept at 4 \u2022 C could be safely delayed up to 24 h post-killing. Interestingly, irrespective of the method of isolation, consistently higher numbers of recoveries were obtained from the rectum. It is known that clearance of IBV infection first occurs from the respiratory tissues followed by other tissues, with later clearance from kidney and digestive tract (Lucio and Fabricant, 1990 ). In addition, Ambali and Jones (1990) reported IBV isolation from rectal tissue and replication in the epithelium, suggesting that apart from excretion of the virus via this route, the tissue may play an important role in generating new virus when respiratory replication has declined. Thus, the rectum could be an important but additional tissue for diagnosis of IBV. As for the kidneys, since we have used a non-nephrotropic virus, the frequency of virus detection was low and to be expected. The host, agent and environmental factors may have influenced the results of this experiment (Dhinakar Raj and Jones, 1997) and a change in these factors, particularly the strain of virus used may have produced a different outcome.",

For diagnosis of the disease, use of pooled swabs is a routine practice as it is convenient, and represents a flock rather than individual birds. In our study, we also used pooled swabs taken from homogenised tissues where RNA was extracted for RT-PCR. This appears to be the first report where such an extraction has been performed. Other workers have extracted RNA from allantoic fluid (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003; Gelb and Jackwood, 1998) , directly from tracheal or oropharyngeal swabs (Capua et al., 1999; Cavanagh et al., 1999; Jackwood et al., 1997; Elhafi et al., 2004) or directly from non-processed tissues (Falcone et al., 1997) . In this study, positive PCR reactions were found on all occasions, except after 1, 6 and 9 h of storage for lungs and 9 h of storage for rectum. This could have been due to low amount of viral genomes in the tissues or other non-specific inhibitory factors (Kwon et al., 1993) , as positive isolations at these times were obtained by ECE. Generally, it appears that RT-PCR has detected positive samples at similar rate as ECE, and was better than TOC. This may demonstrate that direct swabs from homogenised tissues could be used for detection of IBV by nested RT-PCR, which may take no more than 48 h.",
