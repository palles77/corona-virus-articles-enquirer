            "text": "Background and aims: Inflammation plays a key role in atherosclerosis. The complement system is involved in atherogenesis, and the complement receptor 1 (CR1) plays a role facilitating the clearance of immune complexes from the circulation. Limited evidence suggests that CR1 may be involved in cardiovascular disease. We investigated the relationship between CR1 gene polymorphisms and cardiovascular risk. Methods: Single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) within the CR1 region (n \u00bc 73) on chromosome 1 were assessed in 5244 participants in PROSPER (PROspective Study of Pravastatin in the Elderly at Risk) (mean age 75.3 years), who had been randomized to pravastatin 40 mg/day or placebo and followed for a mean of 3.2 years. Logistic regression, adjusted for gender, age, country and use of pravastatin, was used to assess the association between the SNPs and cardiovascular disease. Results: All 73 SNPs within the genomic region of the CR1 gene on chromosome 1 were extracted. In this region, strong LD was present leading to the occurrence of two haploblocks. Twelve of the 73 investigated CR1 SNPs were significantly associated with the risk of fatal or nonfatal myocardial infarction (all p < 0.05). Moreover, most of the associated SNPs were also associated with levels of serum C-reactive protein (CRP). The global p-value for the tail strength method to control for multiple testing was 0.0489, implying that the null hypothesis of no associated SNPs can be rejected. Conclusions: These data indicate that genetic variation within the CR1 gene is associated with inflammation and the risk of incident coronary artery disease.",

All statistical analyses were performed with PLINK statistical software (http://pngu.mgh. harvard.edu/~purcell/plink/download.shtml#download). To control for multiple testing, we calculated global p-values using the tail strength method [30] . In short, the tail strength measures how much p-values in a set differ from the expected uniform distribution under the null hypothesis and sums up these differences into single-test statistics. The tail strength is powerful when many small effects exist in the data [30] . Since SNPs are not independent, empirical p-values were computed using permutations. SNPs were permuted as a block, keeping intact the relationship between covariates and outcome. Individual tests were based on a Coxmodel (coxph) and 2 \u00c2 10 4 permutations were used. Computations were parallelized using package parallelize.dynamic [31] . Global p-values were computed using R version 3.2.

The lower risk of MI, which we observed in carriers of the minor allele rs12034383 and rs6691117, and lower levels of CRP in rs12034383, are in line with the previously reported lower inflammation in these subjects [35] .

This may affect cardiovascular risk in several ways. Firstly, polymorphisms leading to lower expression of CR1 on these cells may result in reduced clearance of immune complexes from the circulation, resulting in a pro-inflammatory and therefore, a proatherogenic situation. Secondly, lower erythrocyte-CR1 expression may be pro-atherogenic due to less binding of atherogenic lipoproteins to erythrocytes. We have previously demonstrated in vivo that circulating human erythrocytes are able to bind atherogenic apolipoprotein B-containing lipoproteins [12, 39] . The binding of these lipoproteins by circulating blood cells was associated with a reduced prevalence of atherosclerosis [12, 39] . Possibly, this binding of atherogenic particles by blood cells prevents their interaction with the endothelium, and we have speculated that erythrocytes contribute to removal of the lipoproteins from the circulation [40] . In vitro and ex vivo work from our group indicates that CR1 is a likely candidate receptor for the binding of lipoproteins to circulating blood cells [13] .",

            "text": "A limitation of the present study is that we did not quantify erythrocyte-bound CR1 in our patients. We do not know whether these SNPs lead to functional changes in the CR1 protein, although the observed relationship with CRP levels and the previously reported relationship with erythrocyte sedimentation rate suggest functionality. Another limitation is that we did not correct for multiple testing with the more common Bonferroni correction. Due to the large number of SNPs analyzed, the Bonferroni adjusted pvalue would have been 6.8 \u00c2 10 \u00c06 (0.05/73). However, we noticed by checking the haplotype structure within the gene, that there were only two major haploblocks with very strong LD. This indicates that the 73 investigated SNPs were not all independent of each other and that using the Bonferroni correction would have been too conservative. Instead, we used the tail strength method to control for multiple testing, since this test is powerful for studies with strong LD (dependency) and with small effect sizes. Since we found a significant p-value with this test as well, we consider our results to be valid and not false-positive. Another limitation is that these data were obtained in a single cohort, and these findings need to be confirmed in an independent cohort. In addition, we investigated a group of subjects aged 70 years and above. While the impact of CR1 gene polymorphisms, and their influence on inflammation and atherosclerosis, may be most pronounced in a group of elderly individuals, if CR1 gene polymorphisms lead to premature death before the age of 70, we may underestimate the true effect of these polymorphisms. Furthermore, future studies investigating the functionality of these CR1 SNPs are necessary.",
