Here we report the step-by-step construction of a prototype mimic of the AIS which we call Adaptive Immune Response Simulator (AIRS). DNA and enzymes are used as simple artificial analogues of the components of the AIS to create a system which responds to specific molecular stimuli in vitro. We show that this network of reactions can function in a manner which is superficially similar to the most basic responses of the vertebrate acquired immune system, including reaction sequences that mimic both humoral and cellular responses.

Functionally, each step in the sequence of humoral and cellular immune response involves the activation and deployment of B and T lymphocytes via highly complex signaling pathways. A fully implemented artificial AIS has not been well studied, possibly resulting from the difficulty of controlling programmability and transferring the high-level biological codes into simple artificial modules and physical implementations. In addition, the formation of robust molecular structures and precise control of their temporal dynamics may be other difficulties. However, in the present work, we have hypothesized the feasibility of designing a network of reactions able to function in a manner similar to the vertebrate acquired immune system, using DNA and enzyme as simplified artificial analogs to mimic the activation and deployment of acquired immune response at its most fundamental level.",

A key function is antigen presentation which provides the mechanism for recognition and response. While B cells secrete antibodies, which bind to and tag an antigen, T cells perform the job of attacking target cells. Both T and B cells also have roles in forming memory cells. As shown in Figure 1 , we divided this series of events into three steps, including Recognition and Tolerance, Immune Response, and Killing and Memory, under the control of four functional DNA components, including DNA duplexes AM (Antigen Presenting Cell (APC) Mimicry), BM (B Cell Mimicry), PG (Primer Generator, which generates primers for analog antibody) and single-stranded circular DNA CT (Circular Template, which controls the sequence of analog antibody), as well as two enzymes (Phi29 DNA polymerase and SsPI restriction enzyme) able to autonomously and programmably respond to an incoming piece of singlestranded DNA pathogen input (P 0 ) taken from bacterial genome. When no P 0 is present, the system is maintained in a steady, balanced state by effective blocking of the functional domains in each component. However, when challenged by P 0 , these functional domains are activated in a series of steps designed to mimic the three steps noted above.",

Mimicking immune tolerance, the unresponsive state of immune defense, the reaction priority of P 0 to duplex DNA AM, as well as to BM, is controlled through the lengths of their corresponding toeholds, which are short single-stranded DNA overhang segments in duplexes. Accordingly, we designed a 10-nucleotide (nt) toehold in AM with a displacement reaction rate k of 10 6 M \u22121 s \u22121 and a 0-nt toehold in BM with a k value of 10 3 M \u22121 s \u22121 for initial P 0 hybridization. 17, 18 AM can display P 0 , which has two ssDNA domains, one having a sequence taken from the genome of Bacillus anthracis, a Gram-positive, rodshaped bacterium (P), and the other designed (ssDNA domain 2-3-4) for controlling downstream reactions through a DNA displacement reaction.

As previously noted, during the depletion of AM by displacement reaction, one of the displaced products, ssDNA TM (T Cell Mimicry), accumulates and can be used as a catalyst to increase the reaction rate between P 0 and BM, thus releasing a primer (ssDNA domain 12a), for DNA polymerase-catalyzed rolling cycle amplification (RCA), which this system will employ to produce DNA \"antibody\" mimicry (P*) to the antigen B. anthrasis (P). Thus, to replicate host defense immune response, we incorporated two B. anthracis genomic sequence fragments (P) in the circular template (CT), resulting in rapid generation of the complementary sequences P*, essentially by enzymatic amplification, using Phi29 DNA polymerase, the replicative polymerase from the Bacillus subtilis phage phi29, and deoxyribonucleotide triphosphate (dNTP), to mimic the fast and antibody-specific generation naturally produced by B cells.",

To accomplish this, three infectious states were assumed: original pathogen strand P 0 and displacement reaction products (with AM and BM) P 1 and P 2 . Together, these all contain infectious pathogen domain (P). Then, to form the antibody-antigen complex in the system, the P domain in P 0 , P 1 and P 2 hybridizes with a large amount of P* and forms stable duplex regions PP*. However, while the vertebrate host immune system uses phagocytosis as a key strategy in removing pathogens, we designed a purely biomechanical method to mimic activation of humoral immune response, i.e., the binding between generated P* and P domain from the pathogen, followed by a restriction enzyme-based step that mimics cell-mediated killing by specifically cutting the \"antibody-antigen\" duplex. More specifically, this latter step is accomplished when the hybridization of P domain with P* creates an active recognition site for restriction enzyme SsPI, which is extracted from an E. coli strain that carries the cloned and modified (Y98F) SspI gene from the Sphaerotilus species restriction site. In this way, P domain in P 0 , P 1 and P 2 can be specifically cut into two fragments with the nucleotide numbers 56 and 15, 19 thus losing infectivity.",

These memory cells will trigger much faster immune response upon subsequent exposure to the same pathogen. Therefore, to create a mechanism to mimic the memory function of B cells, we turned to ssDNA TM, which is produced by the displacement reaction between P 0 and AM and remains in the system from the first exposure to P 0 . We also described its catalysis of P 0 and BM displacement to release primer quickly, thus triggering a faster RCA reaction creating antibody for the next exposure to the same pathogen sequence. This reaction is defined as entropy-driven because it is one that spontaneously evolves towards thermodynamic equilibrium ( Figure S7 ). 18 Without TM, the displacement rate between P 0 and BM would be slow by the effective blocking of active domains on BM. However, in the presence of TM, BM can hybridize with TM through its 4-nucleotide toehold (domain 5*) and then release ssDNA side product W 1 , resulting in a new toehold binding region (domain 3*) for the hybridization between P 0 and BM, which is driven forward thermodynamically by the entropic gain of the liberated molecules. Thus, the effect of memory is produced by speeding up the reaction rate between P 0 and BM by using the catalytic effect of remaining TM produced by the initial recognition. Thus, by leaving TM as \"catalytic fuel\" in the system, memory effect for a specific pathogen input is achieved.",

To examine the precision of the threshold function of AM, we used a F\u00f6rster resonance energy transfer (FRET)-based method to study the hybridization order of P 0 with AM and BM. A fluorophore (FAM) and quencher (DABCYL) pair was coupled in the PG duplex to indicate the released amount of primer for RCA reaction. Fluorescence restoration only occurs if the threshold level of AM is exceeded, after which the reaction proceeds to step 2, immune response, based on strand displacement reactions that can release the quencher-labeled primer strand. Therefore, in the presence of 80 nM AM, 100 nM BM and 100 nM fluorophore/quencher-labeled PG, different concentrations of P 0 (from 0 nM to 150 nM) were introduced to the system with fluorescence monitoring at 517 nm. As shown in Figure 2A , the fluorescence restoration exhibited a sharp upturn at the P 0 concentration of 80 nM, but little increase while under 80 nM, indicating that the reaction between P 0 and BM had begun at the depletion point of AM. In other words, the threshold value of AM to P 0 is adjustable by changing the concentration of AM. In this case, the depletion point, or threshold level, of AM was reached at 80 nM, indicating that the reaction between P 0 and BM could initiate step 2, which, in human, is the production of antibodies by B lymphocytes. To further confirm this result, fluorescence kinetics of the above system was monitored. Initially, 80 nM AM, 100 nM BM and 100 nM PG were mixed in the buffer, and a small amount of P 0 (30 nM) was added. Because of the excess amount of AM and its reaction priority to P 0 by the requirements of step 1, slow fluorescence restoration kinetics occurred. However, when more P 0 (30 nM each time) was continuously added to the system, a sharp increase (after 90 nM in total) was seen in the fluorescence kinetics, indicating that the reaction could proceed to step 2. Different threshold values were tested by changing the concentrations of AM and BM (Fig. S1 ). Gel electrophoresis was also used to indicate the order of reactions (Fig. S2 ). Since the same recognition domain (2-3-4) is shared, similar experimental results were also observed by substituting P 0 for another pathogen sequence, P 0 -SARS (severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus genomic DNA and Fig. S3 ). All assays confirmed the effective threshold function of AM relative to the reaction between BM and P 0 , thus providing a macroscopic mimicry of the \"recognition and tolerance\" state of AIS.",

It will be recalled that ssDNA TM is not only important in facilitating the hybridization between P 0 and BM, but it is also key to the formation of \"mimetic memory cells.\" Therefore, to prove the catalytic effect of TM, we continued to use our FRET-based reporting model, as described above. Accordingly, 80 nM AM, 100 nM BM, and 100 nM FAM/DAB-labeled PG were incubated in buffer. Afterwards, 150 nM P 0 were added to the system. It should be noted that we used an excess amount of P 0 to AM in order to overcome the threshold value. TM is generated in step 1 as a result of the reaction between P 0 and AM. Thus P 0 , when it exceeds the threshold, as set by controlling the concentration of AM, in turn results in a catalytic reaction between excess P 0 and TM by entropy that can quickly restore the fluorescence of the system. As a comparison, the same concentration of P 0 was directly added to a solution with 100 nM BM and 100 nM FAM/DAB-labeled PG, but no AM. As shown in Figure 2C , measurements of the fluorescence kinetics of the catalyzed reaction exhibited over 500-fold acceleration in contrast to that without catalysis. 18, 20 Thus, as explained above, the released TM could serve as specific memory mimicry, resulting in a stronger and faster immune response for the next exposure to the same pathogen. Afterwards, we also confirmed that the quantity of P* generated from enzymatic amplification for hybridization with domain P in P 0 , P 1 and P 2 could be determined by the amount of primer, thus making the enzymatic reaction controllable by upstream reactions in steps 1 and 2 (see supplementary materials). In addition, the restriction enzyme-based digestion of the generated \"antigen-antibody\" complex was studied and shown in the supplementary materials.",

To confirm the tolerance of AIRS, a small amount of P 0 (100 nM) was then added to the system, and fluorescence was monitored in real time. We then designed a DNA molecular beacon (MB-R) to report the amount of RCA product fluorescently by using the pathogen B. anthracis genomic sequence P as its loop. MB-R could be opened by the RCA products, i.e., P*, thereby exhibiting fluorescence restoration that represents different amounts of P*. It can be observed from Figure 3A that the fluorescence kinetics is similar to that without P 0 , confirming that the system is not activated to produce P* when the amount of pathogen is under the level of immune tolerance (i.e., threshold of 200 nM). However, when another 150 nM P 0 were added to the system to mimic a second exposure to the same pathogen, the fluorescence restoration showed much faster kinetics behavior, indicating the production of a large amount of P* and successful triggering of immune response. In addition, the faster response during the second exposure also confirmed the memory effect of this system for specific pathogen. If P 0 -SARS is used as a pathogen input and a molecular beacon (MB-R-SARS) encoded with SARS genomic DNA (P 0 -SARS) is used as reporter, similar fluorescence response trends are seen, as shown in Figure 3B , indicating that AIRS potentially works for a second pathogen input.

As shown in Figure 4A , only one sharp high molecularweight band can be seen when the amount of pathogen exceeds the threshold level (100 nM +150 nM), which is consistent with the previous fluorescence result. To study the binding between pathogen input strand (P 0 ) and antibody mimicry strand (P*) in step 3, we modified P 0 with a fluorophore (FAM). After the generation of P*, the hybridization between P 0 and P* was confirmed to be present, as a high molecular weight band could be seen in the FITC imaging channel (Fig. S13) . With further addition of more FAM-labeled P 0 (from 1 \u00d7 to 250 \u00d7 excess) to the system, the hybridization between excess P 0 and generated P* was still observed, indicating that AIRS could sufficiently bind excess pathogen input strand (P 0 ) by RCA. Finally, we incubated SsPI restriction enzyme (2 U/\u00b5L) together with all other components (200 nM AM, 200 nM BM, 200 nM PG, 50 nM CT, 0.5 U/\u00b5L Phi29 and 250 \u00b5M dNTP). After introducing excess concentration of FAM-labeled P 0 (500 nM) to surpass the immune tolerance of the system, the digestion fragment band with FAM modification (56 nt) was discovered under the FITC channel, leading to the conclusion that the pathogen had been successfully digested (Fig. 4B) . Interestingly, if P 0 is substituted by a doublenucleotide polymorphism input P 0 -mis, antibody mimicry P* can still be generated with excess concentration of P 0 -mis. However, the hybridization between P 0 -mis and P* cannot be digested by the SsPI restriction enzyme, demonstrating that the AIRS system is sensitive to recognition of nucleotide polymorphism of the pathogen input (Fig. S11 ). AIRS has been designed with two layers of selectivity, making it possible for the system to differentiate P 0 from double-nucleotide polymorphism input P 0 -mis. To explain, the relatively weaker binding ability between P 0 -mis and P*, when compared to that of P 0 and P*, makes the P 0mis -P* duplex less stable. Additionally, P 0 -mis-P* mismatch duplex cannot form an effective recognition binding site with the restriction enzyme SsPI (AAT-ATT), thereby reducing the enzyme's digestion rate, which, in turn, results in much less cleavage product from input P 0 -mis (Fig. S11) . In contrast, because the hybridization of P 0 -SARS with P* creates a recognition binding site identical to that of restriction enzyme SsPI, similar gel electrophoresis results were found (Fig. 4C) , again confirming that AIRS can work for different pathogen inputs.",

            "text": "We began by hypothesizing the feasibility of designing a network of chemical reactions able to function in a manner similar to the vertebrate acquired immune system, using DNA-DNA and DNA-enzyme interactions as simplified artificial analogs to mimic the macroscopic behaviors of the vertebrate adaptive immune system. Accordingly, the designed artificial acquired immune response simulator, or AIRS, was de novo demonstrated to superficially mimic three basic steps of host immune response, including recognition/tolerance, immune response, and killing/memory, but without the presence any living component to achieve functionality. Moreover, even though the designed system is entirely synthetic, biocompatibility was shown by its ability to of using only biological molecules (DNA/ enzyme). Consequently, since the cellular state can be controlled by DNA or RNA, it could be possible to encode cellular functions to the system output (i.e., DNA/RNA strand), 5, [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] making it possible to scale up this prototype to increasingly intelligent molecular nanocontrollers and nano-operators. However, to achieve that, our current construction design will need to be improved and integrated with other chemistries.",

Fluorescence intensities were tested after incubation for 1 hour at room temperature. When the signal transduction in the entire system was tested by Working principle of the Acquired Immune Response Simulator. AIRS consists of consists of three steps: (I) Recognition and Tolerance, (II) Immune Response and (III) Killing and Memory. These functions are blocked in the absence of ssDNA pathogen (P 0 ) input, but once P 0 is introduced to the AIRS system, it is driven by a series of DNA toehold-mediated strand displacement and DNA-enzyme reactions. Colored lines indicate DNA strands with different domains. All \u00d7 domains are complementary to x*; P 0 is the pathogen sequence which possesses infection ability in ssDNA form. AM (Antigen Presenting Cell (APC) Mimicry), BM (B cell Mimicry), and PG (Primer Generator, which generates primers for analog antibody) are initially present as duplex components, along with circular DNA template CT (Circular Template, which controls the sequence of analog antibody) and two functional enzymes: Phi29 polymerase and SsPI restriction enzyme.
