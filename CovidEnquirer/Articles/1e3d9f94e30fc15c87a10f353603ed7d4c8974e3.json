However, bats that are naturally or experimentally 41 infected with these viruses do not demonstrate overt signs of disease (Munster et al., 2016, 42 Hayman, 2016). These observations have led to studies that have explored innate and intrinsic 43 antiviral immune responses in this intriguing mammalian order and the unique ability of bats to 44 control virus infection-induced immunopathology (Pavlovich et al., 2018 , Schountz et al., 2017 . In light of these discoveries and speculations, we hypothesized that co-existence with RNA 81 viruses has imposed strong selective pressures on bat antiviral signaling molecules, resulting in 82 robust antiviral responses to virus infection or immune activation signals. Since IRF3 is a key 83 transcription factor in several virus-sensing pathways, we conducted computational and 84 functional analyses of bat IRF3 across both suborders of bats, Yinpterochiroptera and 85",

We next determined if the role of S185 in 152 enhancing IRF3-mediated antiviral protection was dependent on phosphorylation. Since anti-153 phospho antibodies to S185 are not available, we substituted the serine residue at the 185 th 154 position with aspartate (S185D mutation) in human and bat IRF3. Aspartate mimics the charge 155 on a phosphorylated serine residue and has been used to study cellular functions that are 156 modulated by phosphorylated serine residues in proteins (Leger et al., 1997). We repeated our 157 bioassays and compared antiviral responses in cells expressing L185, S185 and D185 forms of 158 IRF3. Indeed, human and bat IRF3-D185 conferred enhanced antiviral protection in human and 159 bat cells, respectively, relative to IRF3-L185, suggesting that the activity of S185 is dependent 160 on a charge that is similar to a phosphorylated serine residue ( Figures 3A-C) . Interestingly, 161 IRF3-D185 conferred enhanced protection in PakiT03-4G cells, relative to IRF3-S185 162 expressing cells that were stimulated with poly(I:C) ( Figure 3B ).

However, in the presence of poly(I:C), 100 ng of plasmid transfection of 167 D185 and S185 forms of human IRF3 conferred comparable and significant protection in THF-168 IRF3 KO cells, relative to IRF3-L185 ( Figure 3C ).

The lack of cell lines and reagents from additional bat species did not 286 allow us to explore the role of S185 and other mutations in the serine-rich region of IRF3 in 287 other species of bats. As IRF3 deleted cell lines from other bat species become available, it will 288 be interesting to identify species-specific adaptations and the role of S185 in antiviral responses 289 against emerging bat-borne RNA viruses, such as filoviruses, paramyxoviruses and 290 coronaviruses, including the recently emerged SARS-CoV-2. Another limitation of this study is 291 the use of one non-bat cell line from humans. As more IRF3 knockout cell lines from additional 292 mammalian species are generated, it will be interesting to observe the effect of S185 on IRF3-293 mediated antiviral responses. ",

Replacing the serine residue in bat IRF3 with the human leucine residue decreased 27 antiviral protection in bat cells while the addition of this serine residue in human IRF3 28 significantly enhanced antiviral protection in human cells. Our study provides genetic and 29 functional evidence for enhanced IRF3-mediated antiviral responses in bats and adds support to 30 speculations that bats have positively selected for multiple adaptations in their antiviral immune 31 responses. INTRODUCTION 33 Bats are reservoirs of several emerging RNA viruses, such as filoviruses (ebolavirus and 34 Marburg virus), paramyxoviruses (Nipah and Hendra viruses) and coronaviruses [severe acute 35 respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS) coronaviruses 36 (CoVs)] that cause serious and often fatal disease in humans and agricultural animals (Forbes et 37 al., 2019, Yang et al., 2019, Swanepoel et al., 2007, Ge et al., 2013, Anthony et al., 2017).

These adaptations include constitutive expression of interferon alpha (IFN\u03b1) (Zhou et al., 49 2016), wider tissue distribution of interferon regulatory factor 7 (IRF7) (Zhou et al., 2014), 50 stricter regulation of pro-inflammatory processes (Banerjee et al., 2017, Ahn et al., 2019) and 51 atypical expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) (De La Cruz-Rivera et al., 2018, H\u00f6lzer 52 et al., 2019). Most antiviral and innate immune signaling studies in bat cells have used surrogate 53 virus (poly I:C, a synthetic double stranded RNA molecule) and virus infections to stimulate 54 downstream expression of IFNs and ISGs; however, the evolution and function of critical 55 cells (Lui et al., 2016, Ding et al., 2014, Chen et al., 2014), bats have likely evolved sophisticated 78 mechanisms of IRF3 activation to mount a robust antiviral response to low levels of infection. 79 80",

To determine if IRF3-S185-mediated antiviral responses in bat cells were 174 dependent on TBK1 and IKK\u03b5-mediated phosphorylation, we first validated the cross-reactivity 175 of the inhibitor in wildtype E. fuscus (Efk3B) and P. alecto (PakiT03) cells. We treated Efk3B 176 and PakiT03 cells with varying concentrations of the inhibitor and stimulated the cells with 177 poly(I:C) for 3 hrs. We used a cross-reactive phospho-IRF3 S396 antibody to detect 178 phosphorylation of IRF3 (see supplementary Figure S1A). The inhibitor blocked 179 phosphorylation of the 396 th serine residue, a marker of IRF3 activation, in cells from both 180 species of bats in response to poly(I:C) stimulation (see supplementary Figures S1B and C).",

            "text": "Wildtype and IRF3-S185-mediated antiviral responses in bat and human cells are191 dependent on IFNAR complex 192 Activation of IRF3 following an exogenous stimulus induces the expression of type I IFNs 193 (Honda et al., 2006) and the subsequent expression of antiviral interferon stimulated genes 194 (ISGs) via binding to the IFN \u03b1/\u03b2 receptors 1 and 2 complex (IFNAR1 and IFNAR2) (de Weerd 195 et al., 2007). We and others have also shown that IRF3-mediated signaling can induce ISG 196 expression independent of IFN production (Noyce et al., 2011, Ashley et al., 2019). To 197 determine if antiviral protection observed in cells expressing S185 or L185 forms of IRF3 was 198 dependent on type I IFN signaling, we repeated our bioassays (Figure 2A) in IRF3 and IFNAR1 199 double knockout (dKO) human cells (THF-IRF3-IFNAR1 dKO) and IRF3 and IFNAR2 dKO P. 200 alecto (PakiT03-IFNAR2-IRF3-G6) cells. Expressing hu IRF3-WT (L185) or hu IRF3-S185 in 201 THF dKO cells (Figure 4B) did not induce antiviral protection upon poly(I:C) stimulation 202 (Figure 4A). Similarly, expressing Pa IRF3-WT (S185) or Pa IRF3-L185 in PakiT03-IFNAR2-203 IRF3-G6 dKO cells (Figure 4D) did not induce antiviral protection in response to poly(I:C) 204 (Figure 4C). These data demonstrate that IRF3-L185 and S185-mediated antiviral responses to 205 double-stranded RNA in human and bat cells are dependent on canonical IFN signaling via the 206 IFNAR complex. The lack of antiviral protection in IRF3 and IFNAR deleted human and bat 207 cells demonstrate that antiviral protection in our bioassays are mediated through type I IFNs 208 (Uz\u00e9 et al., 1990). 209 210 DISCUSSION 211 Bats harbor many zoonotic RNA viruses and do not demonstrate signs of disease when they are 212 naturally or experimentally infected with these viruses (Munster et al., 2016, Schuh et al., 2017, 213 Amman et al., 2015). Multiple studies have demonstrated the ability of bat cells to produce 214 antiviral IFNs and downstream ISGs; however, the role of key transcription factors, such as IRF3 215",

In addition, we also observed that transfecting 231 increasing concentrations of the IRF3 expression plasmid, in the absence of poly(I:C) stimulation 232 (mock treated), did not induce strong antiviral protection in bat cells, unlike in unstimulated 233 THF-IRF3 KO cells that were protected by higher concentrations of transfected plasmid alone 234 (Figures 2B-D). This observation is consistent with the recent finding that bats have evolved 235 dampened DNA sensing and stimulator of IFN genes (STING)-mediated signaling to limit innate 236 and intrinsic responses to self-DNA (Xie et al., 2018). 237 238",
