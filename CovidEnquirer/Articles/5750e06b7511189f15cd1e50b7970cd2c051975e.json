As detailed by geographer and ecologist Diamond (1997 Diamond ( , 2002 , populations grew as agriculture developed, because larger sedentary populations both demanded and enabled more food production. Local ecological disruptions became more numerous and widespread and more intense. With animal domestication, contagious diseases of pets and livestock adapted to new, human hosts. Diseases spread more quickly in crowded conditions; inadequate sanitation compounded the effects. From agriculture, civilization followed and, with it, cities, writing, advanced technology, and political empires. In just 10,000 years, these developments led to some 7.5 billion people on Earth, industrial societies, and a global economy founded on complicated technologies and fossil fuels. Humans have emerged as ecosystem engineers on a global scale. The ecological disruptions we cause are no longer just local or regional but global, and we have become the principal threat to the environment.",

Chemicalsas varied as pesticides, heavy metals, prescription drugs flowing out of sewage plants, and cancer-causing by-products of countless manufacturing processesnow lace the world's water, soil, and air and the bodies of all living things, including people. Chemicals directly poison organisms; they accumulate in physical surroundings and are passed through and, in many cases, concentrated within portions of the food web. Chemicals cause cancer, interfere with hormonal systems, provoke asthma, and impair the functioning of immune systems. They have intergenerational effects, such as intellectual impairment in children whose mothers have eaten contaminated fish. What's more, over half a century of pesticide and antibiotic overuse has bred resistance to these chemicals among insects, plants, and microbes, giving rise to new and reemerging illnesses.",

US farmers routinely plant their fields with corn whose genetic material incorporates a bacterial gene resistant to certain pathogens. More than 40 genetically altered crops have been approved for sale to US farmers since 1992, with genes borrowed from bacteria, viruses, and insects. The United States accounts for nearly two-thirds of biotechnology crops planted globally. Worldwide in 2013, 174 million hectares in 24 countries on six continents were planted with genetically modified crops, as compared with 1.7 million hectares in 6 countries in 1996a 100-fold areal expansion in less than two decades.",

Integrity implies a wholeness or unimpaired condition. In present biological usage, integrity refers to the condition at sites with little or no influence from human activity; the organisms there are the products of natural evolutionary Benthic index of biological integrity: the highest possible score is 50, the lowest is 10. b See Fig. 2 for graphs of selected B-IBI metrics at these sites. and biogeographic processes in the absence of people. Tying the concept of integrity to an evolutionary framework lays down a benchmark against which to evaluate sites that people have altered. Directing policy toward protecting biological integrityas called for in the United States' Clean Water Act, Canada's National Park Act, and the European Union's Water Framework Directive, among othersdoes not, however, mean that people must cease all activity that interferes with some \"pristine\" Earthly biota. The demands of feeding, clothing, and housing billions of people mean that few places on Earth will maintain a biota with evolutionary and biogeographic integrity. Rather, because people depend on living systems, it is in our interest to manage our activities so they do not compromise a place's capacity to support those activities in the future; that capacity can be called ecological health.",

At these places, it is impractical to set a goal of integrity in an evolutionary sense, but we should avoid practices that damage these places or places elsewhere to the point that we can no longer receive the intended benefits indefinitely. For example, agricultural practices that leave behind saline soils, depress regional water tables, and erode fertile topsoil faster than it can be renewed destroy the land's biological capacity for agriculture. Moreover, they can degrade places downstream and downwindlocally, regionally, and across an ocean or continent. Such practices are unhealthy in both ecological and economic terms.",

It begins to turn our attention away from questions such as, How much stress can landscapes and ecosystems absorb? to ones such as, How can responsible human actions protect and restore ecosystems? In contrast to risk assessment, striving to protect biological integrity would lead us away from technological fixes for environmental problems and toward practices that prevent ecological degradation and encourage ecological restoration. Leopold (1949, pp. 224-225) , in A Sand County Almanac, was the first to invoke the concept of integrity in an ecological sense: \"A thing is right when it tends to preserve the integrity, stability, and beauty of the biotic community. It is wrong when it tends otherwise.\" Managing for biological integrity requires the kind of ethical commitment inherent in Leopold's words. We are called to restrain consumerism and limit population size, to embrace less-selfish attitudes toward land stewardship, and to understand that the biosphere matters. Instead of calling on human technical and spiritual wellsprings to manage resources, we have to call on them for managing human affairs.",

The amendment's goal is to phase out the production and use of industrial chemicals called hydrofluorocarbons, which have thousands of times the global warming potential of carbon dioxide.

In fact, Ernst Haeckel, who coined the term in the 1860s, defined ecology in an 1870 article as the body of knowledge concerning the economy of nature. Neoclassical economics, in contrast, reinforced humans' self-appointed dominion over nature's wealth. It brought unparalleled gains in societal welfare in some places, but it also divorced the human economy from the natural one on which it stands (see Fig. 1 ).",
