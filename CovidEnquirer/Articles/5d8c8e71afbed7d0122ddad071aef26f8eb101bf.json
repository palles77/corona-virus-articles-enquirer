[7] [8] [9] [10] Onset in an infant younger than 3 months heightens suspicion of anatomic anomaly, ciliary dyskinesia, or cystic fibrosis. Accompanying sinusitis, otitis media, or pneumonia raises consideration of an immunologic deficiency (especially immunoglobulin deficiency or dysfunction, as in hypogammaglobulinemia or human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infection), neutrophil defect, cystic fibrosis, or ciliary dyskinesia. URIs are conspicuously severe in such instances, with recrudescence almost immediately after discontinuation of antibiotic therapy. Unilateral nasal discharge and obstruction should prompt investigation for a foreign body, mass lesion, or unilateral posterior choanal atresia. Table 21 -2 shows differentiating features of important or common causes of acute mucopurulent rhinorrhea; allergic rhinitis is included because it is frequently part of the differential diagnosis in older children and adolescents.",

Furthermore, \"high\" rates of isolation of S. pneumoniae in 25% to 46% of subjects do not exceed those in healthy young children when fastidious technique is used. 22 Only two systematically performed studies on the course of mucopurulent rhinorrhea have been published. In one study, prospective evaluation showed that there was no difference in duration of illness or complications in children with clear or purulent nasal discharge. 14 In a placebo-controlled, blinded study of 142 children 3 months to 3 years old with mucopurulent rhinorrhea of any duration, antibiotic therapy (cephalexin), systemic use of an antihistamine-decongestant, or both had no effect on the course or complications of mucopurulent rhinorrhea. 12 In a small pilot study of 13 children younger than 2 years whose purulent nasal discharge had persisted for at least 10 days without improvement, amoxicillin-clavulanate (40 mg/kg per day divided into 3 doses for 10 days) was significantly associated with resolution of symptoms in comparison with placebo. 15 Response to antimicrobial therapy does not necessarily validate an entity of bacterial nasopharyngitis, however; it seems more likely that some children with such responses have an incomplete symptom complex of ethmoid sinusitis. Acute bacterial adenoiditis is postulated to be another cause of purulent nasal discharge when: (1) tympanic membranes are normal; (2) S. pyogenes is not found in culture specimens; and (3) radiographs show an enlarged adenoid shadow but no sinus abnormality. 23, 24 Critical study has not been performed to validate this entity.",

Because the extrathoracic airway normally narrows during the inspiratory phase of respiration, stridor due to upper-airway disease occurs during inspiration (or is more pronounced during inspiration if severe narrowing causes obstruction during inspiration and expiration). Because the intrathoracic trachea normally narrows during expiration, obstruction of the intrathoracic trachea, such as that due to extrinsic compression of vascular ring or intraluminal obstruction of foreign body, inflammation, or tracheomalacia, causes a loud noise, acoustically like stridor, heard during both phases of respiration but is more pronounced on expiration. Extrathoracic obstruction (inspiratory stridor) is associated with prolonged inspiration and underaeration of the chest, whereas intrathoracic obstruction (expiratory stridor or wheezing) is associated with prolonged expiration and overinflated chest. Stridor can be associated with mild tachypnea, but a respiratory rate >50 breaths/minute should not be ascribed to upper-airway obstruction alone.",

Bacterial tracheitis is usually a complication of viral laryngotracheitis (with concordant peak age and season) but can occur at any age or as a complication of oropharyngeal surgery. 43 Staphylococcus aureus is the most common cause, followed by Streptococcus pyogenes; the role of anaerobic bacteria is less clear. 41, 43 With the universal use of H. influenzae b vaccine, epiglottitis is a rare cause of stridor; current cases of supraglottitis are more likely to affect the aryepiglottic region and to be caused by streptococci.

Careful assessment of a pathologic coughits onset, duration, clinical context, and association with other findings as well as its specific timbre, pattern, and productivity -frequently predicts the site of pathophysiology and narrows the differential diagnosis to a limited number of entities. Cough usually is defined as acute (<3 weeks), subacute (3-8 weeks), or chronic (>8 weeks). A \"wet\" or \"moist\" cough in children, frequently referred to as productive (although young children rarely expectorate), is associated with detectable secretions by bronchoscopy and can be reported accurately by parents and clinicians. 47 Etiology A dry cough is expected in allergic rhinitis/sinusitis or asthma while a wet cough is typical in infectious sinusitis, bronchitis, bronchiectasis, and pneumonia. The vast majority of coughs are related to self-limited viral upper respiratory tract illness (URI), with up to 40% of school-aged children still coughing 10 days after onset of a common cold, and 10% of preschool-aged All references are available online at www.expertconsult.com children coughing 25 days after a URI. 48 Isolated subacute cough (in absence of other symptoms), which usually is dry and follows viral infection, frequently is related to increased cough receptor sensitivity. 49 Chronic cough is pathologic. Differential diagnosis also can be focused by age, history, and clinical findings; algorithm for sequential evaluation and management is specific and sometimes complex 50 -best performed by a pediatric pulmonologist. Most common causes of chronic cough evaluated in older (mean 8-9 years) U.S. 51 and Turkish 52 children were: allergic or nonallergic rhinitis and sinusitis, asthma, protracted bacterial bronchitis, and gastroesophageal reflux disease. An important minority of children have cystic fibrosis, non-CF bronchiectasis, or ciliary dyskinesia syndrome. The focus of management is etiology. No evidence supports the use of medications aimed at symptomatic relief of acute or chronic cough and some data suggest potential harmful effects. Cough should not be accepted as a sign of self-limited URI in infants younger than 3 months. The mnemonic CRADLE may be useful to call to mind important considerations for such patients: 53 C, cystic fibrosis; R, respiratory tract infections (especially pneumonia and pertussis); A, aspiration (swallowing dysfunction, gastroesophageal reflux, tracheoesophageal fistula); D, dyskinesia of cilia; L, lung, vascular, or airway malformations; E, edema (heart failure, pulmonary lymphangiectasia). Table 21 -6 provides a framework for consideration of cough illnesses. Comments on certain infections follow. There is considerable overlap in symptomatology of cough caused by certain infectious agents, such as Bordetella pertussis or Mycoplasma pneumoniae in adolescents, 54 because of a common tracheobronchial site of pathophysiology and frequent dual infection by microbes. 55 B. pertussis causes a dramatic, debilitating paroxysmal cough without airway or lower tract abnormalities (unless secondary pneumonia occurs, leading to fever and toxicity), whereas C. trachomatis causes pneumonia with prominent tachypnea: the cough is only important because it brings the child to medical attention (see Chapter 162, Bordetella pertussis (Pertussis) and",

Except in the first few days of life, when pneumonia is due predominantly to bacteria acquired from the mother's genital tract or to organisms acquired transplacentally, nonbacterial pathogens are overwhelmingly predominant. 68 As perinatally acquired agents persist, community exposures increase, and maternally derived antibody protection wanes, the infant between 3 weeks and 3 months old is vulnerable to a unique array of lower respiratory tract pathogens. 71 Clinical setting, specific symptom complex, and severity of illness in proportion to findings on physical examination aid distinction of likely causes and guide the diagnostic and therapeutic approach (see Table 21 -8) . Although the pathogens listed in Table 21 -8 frequently are referred to as causing \"afebrile pneumonia,\" this is a misnomer, because Bordetella pertussis infrequently causes lower respiratory tract abnormalities, and respiratory syncytial virus and especially other respiratory viruses frequently cause fever. 11, 68, 72, 73 A causal role for Ureaplasma urealyticum is not completely defined, because the situation is confounded by the asymptomatic presence of this organism in women and young infants.

Tachypnea is thought to be the best clinical predictor of lower respiratory tract infection in children. The World Health Organization defines pneumonia primarily as cough or difficult breathing and tachypnea, which definition is age-related: respiratory rate (RR) in breaths/minute >60 in infants 0-2 months of age, >50 in infants 2 to 12 months, >40 in children 1 to 5 years, and >20 in children >5 years of age. 59 Tachypnea has sensitivity of 50% to 85% for diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infection with specificity of 70% to 97%. 60, 61 The younger the patient under 24 months of age, the less likely that pneumonia is present if tachypnea is absent. In one study, for infants younger than 2 months, respiratory rate of 60 breaths/minute, retractions, or nasal flaring had sensitivity for diagnosis of pneumonia of 91%. 61 Tachypnea also can be a response to fever, dehydration, or metabolic acidosis. In a study from a U.S. emergency department of children younger than 5 years of age who were undergoing chest radiography for possible pneumonia, respiratory rates in those with and without documented pneumonia did not differ significantly. However, 20% of those with WHO-defined tachypnea had pneumonia confirmed compared with 12% in those who did not. 62 Performance of a chest radiograph in febrile infants without an apparent focus of infection to exclude pneumonia \"missed\" by physical examination has low yield in the absence of tachypnea. 63, 64 Cough is a more sensitive but nonspecific symptom of pneumonia. Other symptoms and signs associated with pneumonia, such as nasal flaring, intercostal retractions, and cyanosis, have less sensitivity (25%, 9%, and 9%, respectively) but high specificity (87%, 93%, and 94%, respectively). 60 Although fever, cough, and tachypnea are cardinal features, any or all of them can be overshadowed or overlooked in patients who come to medical attention for pneumonia-associated stiff neck, abdominal pain, or chest pain or for nonspecific symptoms of illness, such as feeding difficulty in infants. While chest radiograph is not necessary routinely in children with any of these complaints, it should be considered if the patient has fever and cough or tachypnea. 65, 66 Classic symptoms of pneumonia reported in adolescents and adults are fever, chills, pleuritic chest pain, and cough productive of purulent sputum, with less noticeable tachypnea. 67 Grunting is an expiratory sound produced in the larynx when vocal cords are adducted to generate positive end-expiratory pressure (self-induced PEEP) and increased resting volume of the lung. Its causes are myriad but never trivial. Grunting can be a sign of surfactant deficiency in the neonate, or of pulmonary edema, foreign-body aspiration, severe pneumonia, mediastinal mass or severe mediastinal shift from any cause, pleuritic or musculoskeletal chest pain, or myopericarditis or other cardiac abnormalities at any age. 68 Retractions (intercostal, subcostal, or suprasternal) and grunting have been associated with severe pneumonia; and nasal flaring and head bobbing with hypoxemia.",

Wheezes are musical continuous sounds present predominantly on expiration and are a sign of airway obstruction. Widespread bronchiolar narrowing, as most commonly occurs with the inflammation of virusassociated lower respiratory tract infection, produces heterophonous high-pitched, sibilant wheezes of variable pitch and presence in different lung fields. Fixed obstruction in a larger airway, as from in history or finding on examination is unique for any agent, but when they are taken together, a working diagnosis emerges and guides intervention or further diagnostic testing. Chest radiography and laboratory tests usually are reserved for patients who are ill and hospitalized or whose clinical picture is not compelling for a category of etiologic agents. A number of studies using complex diagnostic methodologies have confirmed the specific cause of pneumonia in 45% to 85% of cases. 72-76 Viral etiologies predominate, and, currently, most are amenable to diagnosis. 72 The efficacy trial and postmarketing studies of PCV7 infers Streptococcus pneumoniae as a relatively common cause of pneumonia with patchy or consolidative infiltrates. 77, 78 Urine antigen detection test in children with lobar pneumonia also supports the important role of S. pneumoniae; 79 however, the test is positive in >15% of children with asymptomatic colonization. 80 Testing for Mycoplasma pneumoniae using IgM enzyme immunoassay serologic test is problematic because of false-positive tests, and may be best utilized in school-aged children and adolescents with findings consistent with mycoplasma infection in those whose pretest probability is moderate or higher. 58, 81 Currently, ascribing a causal role of pneumonia to Chlamydophila pneumoniae is confounded by the findings of prolonged asymptomatic carriage and inconsistent serologic results among studies. 82",
