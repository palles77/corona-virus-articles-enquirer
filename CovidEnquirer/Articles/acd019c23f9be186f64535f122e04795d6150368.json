Member countries differ widely in terms of their GDP per capita, their size, aviation policies and the strength of their aviation industries. Granted these differences, several possibilities for facilitating the move are examined. These include taking an economic approach to aviation negotiations, liberalising within sub-regional groupings, a staged framework of liberalisation, and increasing the scope for lowcost carriers to compete, possibly through development of secondary markets. Moves will also necessitate attention being given to complementary issues, such as competition and subsidy policies and ownership. r",

This move will essentially be a negotiated move, with individual countries agreeing to policy changes which will bring open skies into effect. Examples of negotiated moves to open skies are very rare. The best example of open skies being implemented within a region is in Europe; however, this was not a negotiated move. Rather, open skies was imposed on European Union (EU) member countries by the European Court of Justice. It is very doubtful whether substantial European liberalisation would have come about if it had been up to the individual countries, with their very different policy stances, to negotiate an agreement. Bilateral open skies agreements are common, and there do exist some regional ''Open Skies'' arrangements; however, these rarely involve anything beyond minimal liberalisation.",

In 1995 the ASEAN Leaders adopted the Agenda for Greater Economic Integration 1 in Bangkok which included the development of an Open Sky Policy as an area of cooperation in the Plan of Action for Transport and Communications (1994-1996) . The ASEAN Vision 2020 prepared in 1997 aimed at forging closer economic integration within the region. 2 Furthermore, the Successor Plan of Action in Transport 1999-2004 identified enhanced regulatory and competition policy options for the ASEAN civil aviation sector as one of its strategic thrusts (ASEAN, 1999) . It aimed to promote a more competitive environment for air transport services and operations, by way of liberalisation initiatives and agreements that may be a gradual step towards an Open Sky Policy in ASEAN. Specifically, it called for the following: (a) development of the liberalisation policy for air freight services; and (b) adoption of more liberal and flexible air services arrangements, initially in the ASEAN sub-regional groupings like Brunei-Indonesia-Malaysia-Philippines East ASEAN Growth Area (BIMP-EAGA), and the Cambodia-Laos-Myanmar-Vietnam group (CLMV). In 2001, the ASEAN Transport Ministers at the 7th Air Transport Meeting (ATM) agreed to launch a regional initiative for the progressive and phased liberalisation of air services in ASEAN, by providing greater market access, flexibility and capability in air services operations. The ASEAN Memorandum of Understanding (MOU) on Air Freight Services signed in September 2002 is a first step towards the full liberalisation of air freight services in ASEAN.",

Low-cost carriers (LCCs) have had a major impact on airline competition in the US, Europe, and in other areas, and they have now begun to have a major impact in the ASEAN region. The deregulation of the domestic markets paved way for the birth of LCCs which have also opened up of new ASEAN routes. The best-known carrier is Air Asia, although Cebu Pacific in the Philippines was established as early as 1997 and operated domestic routes. Other start-ups include Thai Air Asia, One-Two-Go and Nok Air in Thailand, ValuAir, Jetstar Asia and Tiger Airways in Singapore and Lion Airlines in Indonesia. At present, the scope for LCCs to operate in ASEAN is limited: they can operate only in deregulated domestic markets and on specific liberalised international routes. Many LCCs in the region have found that their growth has been stymied by their inability to gain access to regulated international routes.",

Some ASEAN airlines are extremely cost competitive by world standards and these have been successful in international markets (Oum and Yu, 1998a, b ) (see Tables 3 and 4 ). Other airlines appear to be much less cost competitive, and less financially successful. There is evidence of wide dispersion of air fares. Fares on tightly regulated routes are higher than on the more competitive routes. There are considerable directional imbalances in fares on some controlled routes-this suggests that not all fares are closely based on costs. A further piece of evidence comes from the fares now being offered on domestic routes by LCCs. These are significantly lower than on international intra-ASEAN routes of similar distance and density. Overall, while systematic studies of fares and productivity are yet to be done, the evidence which is available strongly suggests the possibility of strong gains from liberalisation.",

Countries which generate tourism, such as Singapore, will gain. Those countries which are not in a position to generate much air travel, because their per capita incomes are low, will not gain much by way of consumer benefits. If they have tourism industries, lower air fares will stimulate these, and provide a source of gain. It is improbable that any country will be a net loser from Open Skies-for this to be the case, losses at the airline level would have to outweigh the gains at the consumer and tourism levels.

They are operating in secondary markets or gateways, developing new routes and providing indirect competition to incumbent carriers. 5 Since these routes are less likely to be served by major carriers, they offer the LCCs the scope to develop during the early stages without encountering head-to-head competition from strong airlines. However, even this indirect competition is forcing incumbent FSCs to review their productivity and cost competitiveness to address their low productivity labour arrangements and inability to respond to market changes. Some FSCs have responded to new competition by setting up their own low-cost subsidiaries (e.g. SIA has a 49% stake in Tiger Airways).",

Many ASEAN routes are blocked to new entrants, and this is constraining the growth of the LCCs. These LCCs are seeking multiple designation, pursuing more liberal traffic rights and greater transparency in the allocation of traffic rights.

Cross-border investment between more than two states requires a regional approach, however it is a process, which outside of the EU, has not proceeded well.

In Europe, the merger between two large airlines, KLM and Air France, has been permittedcompetition from other airlines was judged sufficient to eliminate the possibility of dominance. It is possible that mergers between major carriers in ASEAN (assuming relaxation of current ownership restrictions) would lead to dominance by a few airlines.

Pressure from rapidly developing LCCs may assist in breaking down restrictions, and it could lead to liberalisation ahead of the proposed schedule. Opening up secondary markets is giving LCCs scope to expand, and demonstrate the potential gains from more extensive liberalisation. The process will be helped if countries move away from the legalistic approach to aviation negotiations, emphasising rigid reciprocity and non-interchangeability of aviation and non-aviation trades, to one which assesses the benefits and costs of liberalisation to countries, and which seeks to promote the country's overall economic interests. Finally, the institutional and policy environment in which the move takes place will have a significant impact on its success-open skies will work better if competition policy, subsidy, and ownership issues are explicitly addressed.",
