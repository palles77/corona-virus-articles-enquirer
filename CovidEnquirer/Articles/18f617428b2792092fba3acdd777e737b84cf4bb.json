In particular, most enveloped viruses are capable of inducing membrane fusion as a consequence of their infectious strategy: successful delivery of the viral genome into the host cell requires fusion either with the surface membrane of the cell (Dales, 1973) or with internal vesicles following endocytosis (White et a/., 1983) . Later in infection, the appearance of viral fusion proteins on the surface membranes of infected cells may cause the fusion of adjacent cells with each other, but for reasons not yet entirely understood, the extent of such fusion can vary considerably among different cell types infected with the same virus (Holmes and Choppin, 1966; Wang et al., 1982) .",

The average srze of fusron products, range of srzes, and overall extent of fusron was highly reproducible (cf. error bars In Frg. 2). overall level of fusion was not very extensive (129/o fusion; median size of fusion products = 45 nuclei). Figure 3 presents a more detailed analysis of the size of syncytia formed during PEG-or MHV-induced fusion. We have previously reported on the spectrum of sizes of fused cells formed following PEG treatment (Roos and Davidson, 1980) . In general, PEG-induced fusion can be viewed as a stochastic process, with the probability of fusion between any two adjacent cells being determined by the cell lines involved and the conditions of treatment (Rohme, 1981; Rijhme and Thorburn, 1981) . Such conditions produce a smooth distribution in the sizes of syncytia formed, as illustrated by the lines without symbols in the background of Fig. 3 representing the PEG-fusion response of Clone 1 D and several PEG-resistant cell lines. For example, PEG treatment of FZ4 cells (uppermost background line) left 77% of all cells as unfused mononucleates, 88% as mono-or dinucleates, 99% as syncytia containing five or fewer nuclei, and no fused cells containing more than 20 nuclei. Extensive fusion, as found in PEGtreated Clone 1 D cells, produced a broad spectrum of fusion products of all sizes (standard deviation > 100%; Table 1 ). This picture is very different from the spectrum of syncytia observed in virus-infected cells, as shown by the lines with symbols in Fig. 3 . Slightly less than 50% of all cells in MHV-infected F4,, cultures remained as unfused (mononucleate) cells, similar to the effects of PEG on F,6 cells. But while only 7% of the PEG-treated F,6 cells formed giant cells containing more than 20 nuclei, the great majority of fused cells in virus-infected FaO cultures were found in large syncytia-84% of all those FJO cells which fused at all fused into giant cells with 220 nuclei. The average size of fusion products in PEG-treated F16 cultures contained only 3 nuclei: average size in MHV-infected F4,, was 29 nuclei (Table 1) . Fusion was rare in MHV-infected Clone 1 D cells (12% in the experiments from which this figure was compiled), but virtually all of those fusions which did occur produced very large multinucleates (as seen in Fig. 1 E) . Overall, while PEG fusion produces a wide spectrum of fused cells of many sizes, most fusion observed in MHV-infected cells tends to be in the form of large syncytia.",

FdO cells also contain unusually high concentrations of neutral ether-linked lipid, which may serve to deliver saturated fatty acids to the cell membrane (Roes, 1988) .

We have used the same procedures of lipid alteration which were effective in controlling PEG-induced fusion to determine the effects of fatty acyl-chain saturation on coronavirus-induced fusion. Figure 4 shows cultures of MHV-infected Clone 1D or Fe0 cells grown in normal medium or in medium supplemented with 1 Oe4 AA linolenic (1 8:35) or nonadecanoic (19:O) acids. As already seen, MHV infection of control cells produces little fusion in cultures of Clone 1 D and extensive fusion of F4,, cells (cf. Figs. 4A and 48) . However, when the acyl chains of F40 cells were induced to become more like Clone 1 D by preincubation in the presence of 1 Oe4 n/r polyunsaturated fatty acid (18:3) for 18 hr prior to virus infection, these lipid-altered F4,., cells became highly resistant to MHV-induced fusion (Fig. 4D) . Conversely, Clone 1 D cells which were preincubated in saturated fatty acid (19:O) were extensively fused by MHV (Fig. 4E) , as normally seen only in F,, cells.",

Acylchain composition of both Clone 1 D and F40 cells grown with added 18:3 became highly unsaturated, and the MHV-fusion response changed accordingly, to levels even lower than normally seen in untreated Clone 1 D cells. The addition of 19:O to Clone 1 D cells increased both chain saturation and cell fusion to levels observed in untreated cultures of F4,., More detailed study has indicated that fatty acid supplements are incorporated into both neutral and phospholipids throughout the cell, including the plasma membrane, and that there is little metabolic alteration of the incorporated acyl chains over the course of these experiments (Roos and Choppin, 1985b) .

These cell lines are also intermediate between Clone 1 D and F4,, in their response to fusogenie viruses, as seen in Fig. 2 . Figure 5 demonstrates that parallel cultures of Fls cells can be supplemented with lipids so as to control their fusion response at will. Unsupplemented cultures of F,6 exhibit moderate fusion following treatment with either PEG or MHV (Figs. 5A and 58, respectively) . By the addition of appropriate lipid supplements to the medium, parallel cultures of F,6 can be made either to resemble the PEG-susceptible/virus-resistant phenotype of Clone 1 D (Figs. 5C and 5D; treated with PEG or virus after growth in linolenit acid [18:3]), or to resemble F40 in their resistance to PEG and susceptibility to MHV-induced fusion (Figs. 5E and 5F; grown in nonadecanoic acid [19:0] ). This figure also illustrates the characteristic morphological differences between PEG-and MHV-induced fusion.

Two aspects of their lipid composition are particularly well correlated with the PEG-resistant phenotype: increased acyl-chain saturation and the presence of high concentrations of ether-linked neutral lipid. Although these two phenomena may be metabolically linked, a variety of experiments indicate that acyl-chain saturation is the key factor in regulating the fusion response of these cells (Roos, 1988) . Through the use of lipid supplements added to the growth medium of cells in culture, it has been possible to exert virtually complete control over the response of cells to chemical fusogens such as PEG (Roos and Choppin, 1985b) . As reported above, we have now found that the alteration of acyl-chain saturation can be successfully exploited to control virusinduced fusion as well. Thus F,, cells, which are intermediate in their response to both PEG and MHV, can be pushed in either direction: toward the MHV-fusible/ PEG-resistant phenotype of F,, cells or the MHV-resistant/PEG-fusible phenotype characteristic of Clone 1 D, solely by manipulation of the fatty acid content of the medium (Fig. 5) . These findings apply equally to a variety of other cell lines (Roos et a/., 1987) . BHK cells are often studied because of their extreme sensitivity to virus-induced fusion (as noted above), but these cells can be rendered virus-fusion-resistant (and PEG-fusible) by growth in polyunsaturated lipids (unpublished observations). The ability to control both viral and chemical fusion in parallel (although in opposite directions) may reflect similarities in the site (albeit not the mechanism) of action at the cell membrane.

Clone 1 D cells infected wrth murine hepatitis vrrus were fixed and processed for microscopy as described under Materials and Methods, using a polyclonal mouse antiserum directed against MHV structural proteins. Viral antigen was found only in multinucleated giant cells, one of which is shown here. Thin extensions can be seen connecting the central syncytium with those outlying cells which stained positively for viral antigen. Neither fusion nor viral protein productron was observed in uninfected cultures (not shown) found control over cell fusion in vitro may also prove useful in technological applications (Roos, 1989) . Mizzen et a/. (1983) studied MHV-induced fusion in an LM TK-mouse cell line closely related to our Clone 1 D cells. These investigators also found LM TK-cells to be resistant to virus-induced fusion (by comparison with the MHV-sensitive cell line L2; Rothfels et a/., 1959) due to some \"inherent property of the LM TKcell membrane.\" Our finding that acyl-chain composition serves to regulate MHV-induced fusion provides a possible biochemical basis for these authors' obsetvations.",

The patterns of fusion, antigen distribution, and virus yield observed in MHV-infected Clone 1 D cultures suggest that once inside, the virions readily replicate in these cells, but that release of infectious virus may be inhibited so that the spread of infection is limited to fusion with adjacent cells (Fig. 6 ). This pattern of infection is characteristic of cases where the maturation of virus particles is blocked at the cell membrane, by external experimental manipulations (Graves eta/., 1978; Merz eta/., 1981) , because of a viral defect (Hall and Choppin, 1981) , or through a viral genetic lesion introduced through recombinant techniques (Mc-Cune et al., 1988) . Particularly for enveloped viruses, assembly of new virions appears to be a difficult step, requiring complex membrane interactions (Dubois-Dalcq et a/., 1984) . In attempting to determine the basis for the inhibition of virus production in Clone 1 D cells it may be instructive to examine not only viruspermissive mutants (such as Fa,, cells) but also precursors in the isolation of the LM TK-cell line (Kit et al., 1963) , as mouse fibroblast cell lines are generally susceptible to MHV infection (Mizzen eta/., 1983; Frana et a/., 1985; Kooi et al., 1988) .",
