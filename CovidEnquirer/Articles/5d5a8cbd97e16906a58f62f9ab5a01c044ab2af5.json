Besides reactions with vinylphosphonate the additions proceeded regioselectively to produce mixtures of major cis and minor trans 3,5-disubstituted isoxazolidines (d.e. 28e82%). From vinylphosphonate up to 10% of 3,4-disubstituted isoxazolidines was additionally produced. Vicinal couplings, shielding effects and 2D NOE correlations were employed in configurational assignments as well as in conformational analysis to find out preferred conformations for several isoxazolidines and to observe anomeric effects (pseudoaxial orientation of phosphonylmethoxy groups) for those obtained from vinyloxymethylphosphonate. None of the tested compounds were endowed in vitro with antiviral activity against a variety of DNA and RNA viruses at subtoxic concentrations (up to 250 mM) nor exhibited antiproliferative activity towards L1210, CEM, and HeLa cells (IC 50 \u00bc !100 mM).",

This is exemplified by a replacement of the ring oxygen atom by a carbon atom leading to the formation of carbanucleosides. 6, 27, 28 This modification results in a greater metabolic stability of nucleoside analogues lacking the natural N-glycoside bond. A similar increase in stability can be achieved in 1 0 -homonucleosides which are formed by insertion of the methylene group between the nucleobase and the sugar or sugar mimetics as illustrated by 1 0 -homoadenosine 6 29, 30 Moreover, the biological activity of 1 0 -homonucleosides is also influenced by greater conformational flexibility and slightly improved lipophilicity. Among 1 0 -homonucleosides 31, 32 containing fivemembered rings as ribofuranoside mimics several compounds showing pronounced biological activities were identified 7e13 (Fig. 2) . 33e38 In most cases these compounds retain the hydroxymethyl group to allow for their sequential phosphorylation to active triphosphate metabolites.",

This could be predicted because the spatial and stereoelectronic influence of the substituents at C3 (CH 2 eBase) and at C5 (CH 2 eOH in 21/22, CH 2 eP in 27/28 and CH 2 eOCH 2 P in 29/30) have an indistinguishable impact on the preferred conformations of the isoxazolidine rings in the cis and trans isomers. Although we were unable to unequivocally establish these conformations in addition to 2D NOE spectral data 22 further support for our configurational assignments comes from the comparison of the chemical shifts of H-C5 protons in the cis and trans diastereoisomers (Fig. 4) . Thus, in the 1 H NMR spectra of all transconfigured isoxazolidines (22, 28, 30) resonances of H-C5 are significantly shifted upfield in comparison to the cis isomers (21, 27, 29) , e.g. 4.12 ppm in 22a vs. 4.40 ppm in 21a, because the H-C5 protons in the trans isomers are positioned in the shielding cone of the heteroaromatic ring. The same phenomenon can be observed for the Hb-C4 protons in both the cis and trans isoxazolidines but the shielding effects are much better pronounced for the cis isomers, e.g. 1.79 ppm for Hb-C4 vs. 2.59 ppm for Ha-C4 in 21a and Tables 2 and 3. 2.10 ppm for Hb-C4 vs. 2.31 ppm for Ha-C4 in 22a. Although 1 H and 13 C NMR spectra of isoxazolidines cis-31 and trans-32 prepared from vinyloxymethylphosphonate resembled each other regardless of a nucleobase present they significantly differed from those of the already discussed cis-21/27/29 and trans- On the other hand, when diethyl vinylphosphonate 26 was applied, in addition to major 3,5-disubstituted isoxazolidines cis-33a-e and trans-34a-e (Scheme 3, Table 3 ), the formation of minute amounts (less than 10%) of regioisomeric 3,4-disubstituted products 35a-e and 36a-e was also noticed. Their presence in the crude products as well as in the fractions obtained after column chromatography was detected by the 31 P NMR spectroscopy (Table 4) and additionally proved by careful analyses of the 1 H NMR spectra where diagnostic signals of nucleobase protons could be assigned to four different cycloadducts, namely cis-33a-e, trans-34a-e, and 35a-e/36a-e.",

In general cycloadditions were regioselective and led to the formation of cis and trans mixtures of 3,5-disubstituted isoxazolidines with moderate to good diastereoselectivities. However, in cycloadditions to vinylphosphonate in addition to major 3,5-disubstituted isoxazolidines also 3,4-disubstituted isomers were formed (up to 10%).",

To unequivocally establish relative configurations in regioisomers 35 and 36 the attempts at separating them from major 3,5-disubstituted isomers cis-33 and trans-34 and eventually isolating at least one pure 3,4-disubstituted isomer (35 or 36) were undertaken. For this purpose, a 22:2:49:27 mixture of compounds 33c, 34c, 35c and 36c significantly enriched in the isomer 35c after column chromatography was subjected to separation on an HPLC column to give minute amounts of pure 35c sufficient enough to perform full characterization by NMR spectroscopy including the 2D NOE experiment. The cis configuration of this regioisomer was proved based on the vicinal H-H, H-P and P-C couplings [J(HC5b-HC4) \u00bc 9.2 Hz, J(HC5a-HC4) \u00bc 9.2 Hz and J(P-HbC5) \u00bc 9.2 Hz, J(P-HaC5) \u00bc 0 Hz as well as J(HC4-HC3) \u00bc 5.5 Hz, J(P-C4C3-H) \u00bc 16.1 Hz and J(P-C4C3-CH 2 B) \u00bc 8.1 Hz] which allow to establish the preferred conformation 41(Fig. 6)for this compound. To further support this assignment one should notice that since H-C4 and the CH 2 B moiety are in a near antiperiplanar orientation neither shielding of H-C4 (2.57 ppm) by the heteroaromatic ring and a respective NOE cross peak nor HC5 e HC3 NOE correlation were detected.2.1.

Confluent cell cultures in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID 50 of virus (1 CCID 50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque forming units (PFU) (for VZV) and the cell cultures were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity or plaque formation (VZV) were recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 or compound concentration required to reduce virus-induced cytopathicity or viral plaque formation by 50%.",
