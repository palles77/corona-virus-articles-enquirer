Whilst other countries' public health strategies were immediately focused upon mitigating the effects of a potential worldwide pandemic, Hong Kong's authorities initially directed efforts towards disease containment and preventing community-wide spread. This was exemplified by the stringent quarantine of 300 guests at the hotel of the H1N1 influenza index case in the city. 1, 2 Such an action was applauded by the public, who were shown to be adopting enhanced hygiene behaviours, continuously informed by daily press updates. 3 By June 2009, however, it was clear that community spread had occurred, and the Government moved into the mitigation phase of handling the pandemic with the objective of minimizing spread and reducing the potential disruptive effect of H1N1 influenza in the community.",

Exchange students also served as a potential source of transmission. The Chinese University of Hong Kong was expecting students from a large number of countries to attend its international summer school programme. Due to the high-risk environment of the university, and pressure to comply with government recommendations during the containment phase, the Committee for Health Promotion and Protection (CHPP), established after the SARS outbreak, adopted a proactive approach to the potential risk of H1N1 influenza based upon the experience of SARS. All incoming students were informed of the community outbreak in Mexico and the USA, best practices in protective behaviours, and Hong Kong's first case on 1 May 2009. They were signposted to the CHPP website for further advice, and asked by summer school staff to record their daily temperatures on a health declaration form in the 7 days prior to their arrival on campus. 4, 5, 6 Upon arrival, the orientation programme included an update on H1N1 influenza in Hong Kong and a detailed description of campus-based precautionary measures. Such measures included temperature checkpoints that were set up outside classrooms and hostels with staff equipped with temperature guns, and the provision of free emergency safety packs containing face masks and disinfectant alcohol solution.",

            "text": "This study investigated compliance with preparedness measures and response to an outbreak of influenza H1N1 influenza amongst summer school students from abroad at an early stage of the pandemic. Prior to arrival on campus, most summer school students reported complying with a number of infection control measures, such as hand washing and temperature checks, but they were less likely to seek additional information about H1N1 or to think of needing emergency coverage, and only one-third had ready access to face masks, mirroring findings from previous studies. 7, 8, 9 At the summer school, the students were generally compliant with and supportive of the measures being taken when the first case occurred, despite the inconvenience of online classes and curtailment of student activities. This finding is reassuring to university authorities with responsibility for student welfare, implying reasonable compliance by all students with the steps that were taken. However, different response patterns were observed dependent on country of study. Singapore, Hong Kong and US students each comprised approximately one-quarter of the summer school students, although nearly half (40.7%) of all students were of Hong Kong origin. Each of these three countries of study had taken a different approach to the threat of the pandemic, which was in its earlier stages at the time of the summer school. Both Hong Kong and Singapore had adopted containment strategies, influenced by factors such as their experiences of SARS, the global nature of their cities, pneumonia being a primary cause of death amongst citizens, and the ever-present threat of avian flu to their relatively small and highly mobile populations. 10, 11 At this stage of the pandemic the Singaporean strategy on pandemic response was more rigorous than that of Hong Kong, but both were more stringent than that of the USA. Since SARS, the Singaporean Government had developed plans to enforce community mitigation measures against emerging infections. A centralized, structured pandemic preparedness regime has been constructed which includes the designation of pandemic preparedness clinics throughout the country, the establishment of contact tracing and quarantining guidelines, and widespread dissemination of health promotion materials related to preventing spread of influenza. 12, 13 Such measures were also planned and implemented within Hong Kong. 14 The different behavioural responses mirrored those of the SARS period to some extent when, despite disruptions to daily life, there was widespread support amongst the population for the policies and contingency measures, although Singapore based students demonstrated a higher frequency of self-administered preventive measures than Hong Kong based students during that period. 15 Prior to the students' arrival in late June, Singapore remained in a late containment phase, focusing on contact tracing, hospital isolation and home quarantine before the transition to mitigation in early July. Thus, the finding that students studying in Singapore were more likely than US students to wear face masks, carry information in case of need of an emergency contact and attend informational sessions is not entirely unexpected. Wearing face masks is more common in Eastern cultures, which may contribute to the greater likelihood of wearing/carrying a face mask and having an emergency contact amongst Hong Kong students. Overall, those students studying in Singapore were the most compliant with infection control advice, as well as being supportive of precautionary measures and taking Tamiflu. Differing levels of compliance may be related to the specific policy responses of the student's home country. For instance, the health system of the USA, where state health departments exist as autonomous entities from federal-level agencies such as the CDC and the Department of Health and Human Services, demonstrated a much less uniform and more decentralized response to H1N1. Community response plans for pandemics varied among states in surveillance techniques, home quarantining and community interventions. 16 Attempts to centralize the response system by appointing a director for pandemic preparedness in the executive office were largely ignored in lieu of an assistant secretary of health and human services providing broad recommendations and appropriations towards state health departments, rather than playing a conglomerate role. 17, 18 In addition, the close proximity between the initial outbreak in Mexico and the USA meant rapid spread, with a large number of US cases in a short period, forcing the Government to proceed immediately to a mitigation policy in late April, aiming to minimize the effects of infection rather than attempting to target and shut down its spread. 19 Thus, students arriving from the USA are likely to have been exposed earlier to mixed messages of the severity of the H1N1 pandemic, which may partially explain their lower compliance with campus measures, deeming them to be less useful. While the Hong Kong Government shares a similar system with Singapore in terms of pandemic response, the study results show that Hong Kong-based students were less likely to practice certain measures and perceive contingency measures as necessary compared with students from the USA. Unlike Singapore, the Hong Kong Government transitioned to mitigation on 11 June 2009 upon the first local cases of H1N1 influenza in the city. 20 Daily press updates and information about the virus were displayed in all forms of the media in the city. At the time of the survey on 23 July 2009, the number of influenza H1N1 cases in Hong Kong stood at 2207 with one death. 21 The low mortality rate and the move to mitigation might have, at that time, alleviated concerns about the pandemic within the local population. In addition, local students may have been supported by an extended support network beyond the university, leading to a lesser sensitivity towards its guidance.",

First, although the events surrounding the study provide a certain degree of representation on how students would react to precautionary measures related to a pandemic, the results may not demonstrate how students would react to a pandemic preparedness plan without the existence of an ongoing pandemic. Although they were visiting a city known to have been affected by several epidemics over the past decades, an examination of the perception of students studying in a locale that had not experienced the full brunt of many large-scale epidemics may yield substantively different results. Other limitations include possible self-reporting bias due to social desirability, and the use of cross-sectional data which does not provide clues of trends. Future studies assessing behavioural compliance with similar preventive measures within a campus setting would provide additional data for comparison.",
