In recent years, many EIDs have revealed the close links between human, animal and plant health, highlighting the need for multi-scale, multisectorial EID management. Human beings play a dual role in EID because they can promote their development through numerous humanenvironment interfaces and expanding international trade. On the other hand, their ability to analyze, interpret and act on the determinants of EID allows them to access the expertise necessary to control these EIDs. This expertise must be constantly adapted to remain relevant as the EID evolves, particularly in its virulence or transmission channels. Flexibility should become an inherent part of the expertisebased decision-making process even if it means going backwards. A certain degree of transparency and feedback to citizens is necessary for the acceptability of political decisions basing on expertise. A key step in the management of EID is the appropriate management of the early signal of infectious emergence. This step combines multidisciplinary skills allowing access to the best pathway for containing EID by implementing early countermeasures adapted to the situation. New digital technologies could significantly improve this early detection phase. Finally, experts have a fundamental role to play because they are located at the interface between operational actors and decision-makers, which allows multidirectional feedback, ideally in real time, between professional actors and decision makers. To combat current and future EIDs, expertise should be based on a multi-sectorial approach, promotion of collegiality and continuously adaptation to the evolving nature of EIDs. C ",

Therefore, considering our inability to predict the next emergence and to contain its possible expansion and collateral effects, a better coordination must be implemented at all levels [2] . The global diffusion of highly resistant bacteria (HRTs) is favoured by large-scale movement of populations either human or animal, as observed for other EIDs such as influenza, but also by agro-food products transport [3] . Some projections suggest that notably highly resistant bacterial (HRB) strains could represent a major cause of global mortality by 2050 [4] . Consequently, the anticipation of emergence and its rapid control become obligations before the emergence reaches an advanced, irreversible and sometimes disastrous stage. The spread of certain EIDs, such as plant diseases and zoonotic infections, now raises fears of very significant international economic consequences and hard-to-control, and sometimes devastating, social consequences [5] . The acceleration of apparition of EIDs over the past 40 years, as a result of globalization, also reveals the strong interconnections that exist between human-, animal-, plant health and their social and ecological environment [6] .",

First of all, human may be responsible for these emerging issues, since EIDs often arise from human-environment interactions via agriculture practices and the agro-food industry for example, but also from population movements, wars, etc. He is also a victim of EIDs, with flagrant disparities between Northern and Southern countries in terms of access to knowledge, health care and expertise, high-tech technologies in a context of diminishing development aid funding. Finally, human is an actor through his capacity to develop research and expertise during an EID outbreak and inter-epidemic periods, namely his ability to understand, analyse, comment on the multifactorial determinants, including human behaviour and social attitudes that favour the development of an EID. All this will contribute to human decisions and actions to limit the consequences of EIDs. However, this expertise can be limited by the lack of precise and validated methodology, or when the involved experts limit their analysis to their own fields of competence without considering other relevant and sometimes key elements outside these fields. These elements, and in particular the notion of collegial expertise and structured-decision making, must be reinforced into the functioning of organisations and agencies in charge of managing EIDs being institutional, associative, etc. [7] .",

Another attitude, that still seems to be neglected, would consist in seeking, before the appearance of symptoms in populations, an asymptomatic carrier susceptible to trigger an EID. This ultra-early screening could be a tempting approach because it could potentially reduce the time between the period of ''invisible'' presence of an emerging pathogen and its recognition as an EID. However, this approach could be costly and ineffective in situations where a pathogen circulates for a long period of time without any significant consequences. In all situations, microbiological diagnosis is crucial from the very beginning to confirm the clinical suspicion of EID, despite the costly technical resources and logistical difficulties involved. An essential element is then the ability of Reference Centres and any other organizations capable of issuing an alert to communicate quickly and effectively the signal of the emergence using preestablished channels [11] . The organisations responsible for implementing the response to this EID will thus be able to activate the necessary management measures. Those measures should take into account both existing references and newly acquired data at this stage of development of the emergence (dissemination mode, incubation time, necessary therapeutic resources, etc.) to try to control the dissemination of the EID during this early phase.",

For example, in Europe the expertise and management in plant health often take place at the European community regional level, and are secondarily implanted at the national level. Animal and human health coordination and management appear to be less active, or less visible, at the European scale, even if it exists now for human health a European Centre for Disease Prevention and Control created in 2005 and located at Stockholm, Sweden.",

These new methods could revolutionize the detection of future EIDs (see Graham et al., 2019 [13] for a recent illustration). However, it seems necessary to integrate anthropological, sociological and economical elements into massive data analyses in order to make them more in line with the reality of emerging issues and thus more relevant.

These differences can result in misunderstanding and operational dysfunctions. They can also allow reinforcing complementary interactions. A real-time feedback from operational actors to decision-makers via experts is necessary to increase the efficiency of the response. Indeed this feedback enables to modulate certain recommendations and thus better adapt political decision-making. The feedback from political decision-makers to operational actors seems also important to take into account in the fight against EIDs so that operational actors understand the measures taken by decision-makers, which are sometimes compelling and difficult to implement the field.",

This temporality of expertise, which is one of its inherent limitations, raises the problem of the gap between the progressive and evolutionary scientific approach during the EID and the necessarily more immediate political decision. More generally, better explaining the progressive and iterative aspects of the scientific and medical approaches to the general population can be considered as a current challenge.",

A shared expertise that would better integrate teams from the South and the North seems to be a next logical step in the management of EIDs. By considering the cultural diversity from the outset and simplifying the approach, this translation of expertise to the South could lead to more fluidity, efficiency, relevance and adequacy of the means implemented and the decisions taken towards local populations. Indeed, the perception and integration of cultural elements into the very early phase of managing an emergence, such as the Ebola virus, may have posed difficulties in deploying diagnostic and care devices in the field. Thus, the use of local channels and organizations familiar with the specificities of the concerned region and population seems essential to promote the proper functioning of local interventions and subsequent control measures.",

This seminar is designed for decision-makers, experts and scientists interested in human and animal health, social sciences, environmental sciences, prospective analysis, biosecurity and defence. It is placed under the patronage of the French Ministry of Solidarity and Health and the Ministry of Solidarity and Ecological Transition.The 2018 seminar opened with a lecture conference on the subject of EIDs, travel and human migration (speaker: Olivier Bouchaud, moderator: Jean-Francois Gu\u00e9 gan). This intervention was followed by an interactive session on the expertise and role of experts in health crises affecting plants (speaker: Charles Manceau), animals (speaker: Gilles Salvat) and humans (speaker: Thierry Debord), which was commented by Jean-Claude Desenclos and Daniel Benamouzig (moderators: Henri Bergeron and Didier Che). The seminar ended with a second lecture conference on socalled precision health in the era of big data, and social networks (speaker: Antoine Flahault, moderator: Patrick Zylberman). The authors thank the speakers and the moderators who generously brought their contributions to this seminar. The authors also thank the following institutions, agencies and learned societies for their continuous human and financial support: Agence Nationale de S\u00e9 curit\u00e9 Sanitaire de l'Alimentation, de l'Environnement et du Travail (ANSES), Chaire sant\u00e9 de Sciences-Po, Ecole du Val-de-Gr\u00e2ce (EVDG), Ecole des Hautes Etudes en Sant\u00e9 Publique (EHESP), Haut Conseil de la Sant\u00e9 Publique (HCSP), Institut Pasteur de Paris (IPP), Institut de Recherche pour le D\u00e9 veloppement (IRD), Instituts Th\u00e9 matiques Multi-Organismes (ITMOs) Sant\u00e9 Publique (SP) et Immunologie, inflammation, infectiologie et microbiologie (I3M) de l'Alliance nationale pour les sciences de la vie et de la sant\u00e9 (AVIESAN), Agence Sant\u00e9 Publique France (SpF), Service de Sant\u00e9 des Arm\u00e9 es (SSA), Soci\u00e9 t\u00e9 de Pathologie Infectieuse de Langue Fran\u00e7aise (SPILF), and Universit\u00e9 Paris Diderot.
