            "text": "Background: In May 2015, an imported case of Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) infection occurred in China, so rapid and reliable diagnosis of suspected cases was necessary. Objectives: An external quality assessment (EQA) program for the molecular detection of MERS-CoV was organized by the National Center for Clinical Laboratories (NCCL). Study design: MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs) encapsulating specific RNA sequences of MERS-CoV were prepared as positive specimens. The assessment panel, which comprised of three negative and seven positive samples with different concentrations of VLPs, was distributed to 56 laboratories from 16 provinces, municipalities, or autonomous regions for molecular detection. Results: Among the received data sets, three employed an in-house-developed real-time reversetranscription polymerase chain reaction (rRT-PCR) assay and the others applied various commercial rRT-PCR kits. Overall, the majority of laboratories (46/56, 82.1%) could achieve 100% accuracy for MERS-CoV detection, but three laboratories (5.4%) still had room for improvement. Consequently, all negative samples were identified correctly, reaching 100% specificity. The false-negative rate was 3.1%, and most of the false-negative results were obtained from samples with relatively low concentration, indicating an urgent need to improve detection in weak-positive specimens. Conclusions: The majority of participants possessed reliable diagnostic capacity for the detection of MERS-CoV. Moreover, EQA is indispensable because it can help enhance the diagnostic capability for the surveillance of MERS-CoV infections and allow comparison of the results among different laboratories.",

MERS-CoV is a kind of novel enveloped virus with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome, which can cause severe respiratory complications and renal failure in infected patients [2, 4] . Although most MERS-CoV infections occurred in the Middle East, cases have been reported in Europe, North America, and Asia through people traveling from the Middle East or their contacts [5] . Since May 2015, the Republic of Korea has newly been affected, causing the largest outbreak of MERS-CoV outside the Arabian Peninsula [6] ; this highlighted the importance of a surveillance system to prevent further spread [7] . Simultaneously, China increased its efforts to detect MERS-CoV because of an imported case of MERS from Korea, which was a threat to public health [8] . Hence, rapid and effective diagnosis of the infectious agent is crucial for the timely control and management of this disease.",

The chimeric sequences were amplified (primers listed in Table 1) , gel-purified, and separately subcloned into Kpn I/Pvu I and Kpn I/Pac I sites of the pACYC-MS2 vector [14, 15] to form the recombinant plasmids, pACYC-MS2-upE and pACYC-MS2-ORF 1ab/N, respectively. These two kinds of MS2 virus-like particles (VLPs) packaging specific sequences of MERS-CoV were expressed and purified according to previously published protocols of our laboratory [14] [15] [16] . Then, they were identified by transmission electron microscopy (TEM), enzymatic digestion test, sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE), and RT-PCR.",

It suggested that the assay targeting the upE gene is more sensitive than that targeting ORF 1a/1b, which is in accordance with reported studies [11] and clarified the fact that the upE gene with higher sensitivity is more appropriate as a screening assay.",

Among them, the assay from BioPerfectus Technologies was the most widely used by participants and reached 98.7% sensitivity. However, two laboratories using the commercial assay from Tianlong Bio-Tech Co., Ltd., reported five false-negative results each for ORF 1b gene and were classified into the improvable group. Specifically, one participant chose TIANGEN kit applying spin column method in manual and the other used Tianlong kit applying magnetic bead method automatically when extracting RNA. Moreover, the sensitivities of ORF 1a/1b detection from the other ten assays (Table 3) were all acceptable, suggesting that the MERS-CoV sequences of VLPs met the requirements for molecular detection. Then, we could not conduct an in-depth analysis owing to the limited number of the users. We will implement a follow-up to evaluate the performances of these two participants, because further laboratory practice optimization and external quality management are required.",

In comparison, MS2 VLPs encapsulating specific sequences of MERS-CoV RNA were used in our study as surrogates, which exhibited superior advantages, such as being noninfectious, nuclease resistant, stable, and safe for transport. Moreover, RNA of VLPs can be quantified so that the results are credible and comparable. Stability analyses suggested that the MERS-CoV VLPs could be stable for at least two weeks at 37 \u2022 C, one month at 25 \u2022 C, and two months at 4 \u2022 C (Fig. S2) .",

Nevertheless, the poor score exhibited by a small number of participants suggested a serious need to improve laboratory practices, standardize operating procedures, and strengthen daily quality management. EQA can help improve the diagnostic capability of laboratories and find the best solution to solve existing problems, such as low detection sensitivity for samples with lower viral concentrations. Thus, a wider EQA for MERS-CoV molecular detection incorporating more laboratories and other human coronaviruses such as OC43, NL63, HKU1, and 229E is expected and will be planned and conducted in the future.",
