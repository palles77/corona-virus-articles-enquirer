Human adenovirus type 55 (HAdV-55) (1), formerly known as HAdV-11a (2) , is a reemergent respiratory pathogen that has caused severe pneumonia outbreaks in military and civilian populations in Europe and Asia (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) . However, household transmission of HAdV-55 is rarely reported. We report a case of household transmission of HAdV-55 involving 3 confirmed adult cases with 1 death. Epidemiologic, clinical, and laboratory investigations, along with whole-genome sequencing, elucidate the disease progression and the pathogen origin.",
