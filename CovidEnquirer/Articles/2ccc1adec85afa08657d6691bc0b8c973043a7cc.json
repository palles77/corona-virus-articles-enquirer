            "text": "Swine acute diarrhea syndrome coronavirus (SADS-CoV) is a novel coronavirus which was first reported in southern China in 2017. It can cause severe diarrhea disease in pigs. In order to detect this new emerging virus rapidly and reliably, a TaqMan-based real-time RT-PCR assay was established in this study. Specific primers and probe were designed and synthesized based on the conserved region within the N gene of the viral genome. Results showed that the lowest limit of detection was 3.0 \u00d7 10 1 copies/\u03bcL. This approach was specific for SADS-CoV, and there were no cross-reaction observed against other 15 swine viruses. It was 10 times more sensitive than the conventional PCR and gave higher SADS-CoV positive detection rate (70.69%, 123/174) than the conventional PCR (51.15%, 89/174) from clinical samples. These data indicated that the TaqMan-based realtime RT-PCR assay established here was an effective method with high sensitivity, specificity and reproducibility for faster and more accurate detection and quantification of SADS-CoV.",

SADS-CoV can cause severe and acute diarrhea and rapid weight loss in piglets less than 6-day-old. From January 2017 to May, the outbreak of SADS-CoV has led to the death of almost 25,000 piglets in southern China and resulted in significant economic losses (data unpublished). Considering the clinical symptoms of this new emerging virus that are similar to those caused by other known swine enteric coronaviruese in China, there is an urgent need to establish a faster and reliable diagnostic technique for identification and quantification of SADS-CoV (Dong et al., 2015; Sun et al., 2016) .",
