This sensitivity comes at a cost, however, in terms of time, complexity of assay, and robustness of measurements, and this can have a negative impact on patient care. The prognosis for the majority of serious infections is vastly improved by early intervention, so the development of rapid detection and identification methods is essential, but this must not come at the expense of sensitivity. In the case of hepatitis C infection, for example, diagnosis needs low levels of virus to be detected [3] , and this demands a high level of assay sensitivity. For these reasons there is an ever-increasing requirement for rapid, sensitive technologies that provide better diagnosis and clinical management of infectious diseases. In an effort to address that need, modern medicine has seen a revolution in new high-throughput approaches. Advances in genomics, microarrays and imaging technologies, in particular, have revolutionized the way in which infectious-disease problems are being addressed. Here, we briefly examine how such technologies are being applied to the detection and identification of viruses and the impact such systems might have in the clinic.",

One of the primary immunological techniques is the use of enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) for the detection of circulating virus-specific antibodies. By contrast, reverse transcriptase (RT)-PCR is used to detect the presence of viral genomes or specific viral genes. A combined approach using both techniques overcomes detection problems when either the infection produces a weak antibody response or when virusspecific transcripts are in low abundance. Both these approaches have well documented limitations, however. Immunological tests are hampered by the need for specific antisera that are both laborious and time-consuming to produce, whereas PCR, while being a definite advance in sensitive virus detection, is prone to failure and false recordings and is limited in its ability to identify multiple",

But the microarray concept is not limited to the use of just DNA or protein probes. Indeed, in recent years the concept has been greatly expanded to include the production of all manner of arrayed probes: cells, glycans and carbohydrates, to name but a few. The significance of the microarray to the field of infectious diseases is the parallel detection capabilities of the system (covered in more detail in [5] ). Microarrays offer the ability to achieve simultaneous detection of many targets, and through optimization this can be achieved without detriment to sensitivity.",

In 1999, we and colleagues [6] described the first viral DNA microarray for the temporal profiling of viral (human cytomegalovirus, HCMV) gene expression. Treatment of infected cells with cycloheximide or ganciclovir was used to block de novo protein synthesis or viral replication, respectively, and the microarray was then used to generate expression profiles of the viral genes represented on the chip. Using this approach, HCMV genes were assigned to immediate-early, early or late expression classes, depending on their expression profile in response to the drug treatments. If the expression profile is sufficiently unique, it can be used as an identifying hybridization signature for the molecular staging of an infection.",

The authors [4] described the use of viral DNA microarrays to produce hybridization signatures of viral sequences that effectively serve as 'viral barcodes' for the identification of known, related or novel viruses. By taking advantage of the highly conserved regions within gene families, the authors were able to produce an array that could identify related viruses and discriminate between serotypes. The ability to distinguish subtypes is critical to effective infection management in the clinic: variola virus, for example, is an orthopoxvirus that causes smallpox and has two subtypes, variola major and variola minor, of differing pathogenicity. Laassri et al. [7] addressed the problem of orthopoxvirus subtype discrimination by producing an array capable of correctly identifying four of the orthopoxvirus species. Similarly, arrays have been developed for the detection and distinction of hantaviruses [8] and are capable of distinguishing between isolates that have up to 90% sequence similarity. Other groups have focused on the genotyping of viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and influenza [9, 10] .",

Antibody probes can be used to detect antigens from an infected cell, and vice versa, following sample preparation and labeling. In both cases (a,b) the hybridized chip is scanned and the image processed to provide corresponding profiles.

It is still possible, however, to generate protein analyte 'signatures' by using a specific selection of targeted proteins. For instance, cytokine responses to viral infection can vary greatly between viruses; by arraying antibodies to a spectrum of cytokines it is possible to generate a 'cytokine signature' of infection that is readily identifiable. The application of such technology to the clinic would, however, require a concerted effort to characterize and collate such cytokine signatures.

B lymphocytes were engineered to express calciumdependent bioluminescent aequorin in the cytosol as well as pathogenspecific antibodies on the cell surface. Ligation of the antibody by the pathogen causes an elevation in intracellular calcium ions, thus triggering emission of light from the aequorin within seconds of pathogen contact. express the calcium-dependent bioluminescent protein aequorin together with membrane-bound pathogen-specific antibodies. Binding of the pathogen to the cell-surface antibodies triggers an elevation in intracellular calcium ions that in turn causes the aequorin to emit light, all within a matter of seconds. One of the engineered B-cell lines described by the authors could detect spores of Bacillus anthracis, a pathogen already feared by the general public in relation to terror attacks, highlighting the relevance of such a technique. These investigators [19] used naturally occurring patternrecognition molecules -antibodies -but such systems are by no means restricted to the natural world; for instance, Golumbfskie et al.

Although the results are in the context of drug treatments, one can easily imagine the application of such a technique to the detection of infectious diseases.

One approach to maximizing the effectiveness of existing technology is to combine complementary technologies (Figure 3 ).

Cellular systems, such as the light-emitting B cells engineered by the Rider group [19] , while individually not having the parallel capabilities of the array, provide an extremely rapid detection system. In the future, therefore, we could see the production of hybrid technologies: 'cell-omic sensors', which have the parallel highthroughput capabilities of arrays coupled with the speed of the engineered B cells. This may take the form of microarrays constructed by arraying a panel of engineered cells, for instance, or even synthetic biomimetic systems. Alternatively, advances could allow arrays to be constructed that combine cellular sensors with gene or protein probes. It may be possible to take advantage of the immune system's natural pathogen sensors -macrophages or dendritic cells for example -arrayed onto protein probes or sensors of some description in such a way that cellular changes induced by contact with a pathogen can be measured in real time.",

Although various responses can be used to identify an infection, the heterogeneity of the system we propose (Figure 3 ) may be too variable, and thus the detection of these responses would require all patients to present within a very narrow characterized window for their output to be informative. In clinical terms, this scenario is obviously completely unrealistic. The question is whether infections leave early footprints that are unique and readable, or whether the response to infection as a whole is simply too dynamic. Answers to these questions are tractable but will require carefully controlled and appropriately powered studies as well as standardization of data measurements and quality assurance.

Antibody probes can be used to detect antigens from an infected cell, and vice versa, following sample preparation and labeling.
