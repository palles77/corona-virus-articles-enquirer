RNA interference is a novel approach showing promise for therapeutic use in outbreak situations. This study examined the effect of small interfering RNA (siRNA) on clinical signs as well as the presence of live virus and viral DNA in nasal secretions and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) in horses experimentally infected with EHV-1. siRNA targeting two EHV-1 genes (glycoprotein B and the origin binding protein) was administered 12 h before and 12 h after intranasal infection with EHV-1. Control horses received siRNA targeting firefly luciferase. A significantly smaller proportion (0/10) of horses receiving siRNA targeting viral genes required euthanasia due to intractable neurologic disease as compared to horses in the control group (3/4; p = 0.01). There was no significant difference in the presence of live virus or viral DNA in the nasal secretions or PBMCs between the two groups. Future studies are necessary to define the relative contributions of host and virus factors in the development of the neurological form of the infection and to determine an optimal dosing regimen for metaphylactic or therapeutic use of siRNA for treating EHV-1 infection.",

Epidemiologic factors also reduce vaccine efficacy; foals are often infected for the first time at a very young age, despite the presence of maternal antibodies (Gilkerson et al., 1998) . Conventional vaccines may mitigate clinical signs of respiratory disease and abortion and decrease viral shedding, but have not been found to prevent infection, to stimulate long-lasting immunity or to protect against the neurologic syndrome caused by EHV-1 infection, equine herpes myeloencephalopathy (EHM) (Goodman et al., 2006; Patel et al., 2003) . Treatment of horses with clinical disease has traditionally been limited to supportive care. More recently antiviral drugs (including acyclovir and valacyclovir) have been investigated, but poor bioavailability, lack of controlled clinical evidence, and extensive cost of treatment have precluded their wide use in the field (Bentz et al., 2006; Garre et al., 2009 Garre et al., , 2007 Henninger et al., 2007; Maxwell et al., 2008) .",

One novel approach that has shown promise both in vitro and in other species in vivo is the use of RNA interference. RNA interference involves the recruitment of endogenous or exogenous short interfering RNA (siRNA) into RNA-induced silencing complexes (RISCs) resulting in degradation of target mRNA (Stevenson, 2004) . For human diseases, in vivo studies in Rhesus macaques 0168 showed a beneficial effect of RNA interference in both prevention and treatment of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus, including significant decreases in fever, viral load and lung pathology (Li et al., 2005) . Moreover, clinical trials in humans were started using siRNA in the treatment of respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) infections (Haasnoot et al., 2007) . For equine viruses, in vitro studies have shown that siRNA can reduce viral titers in cell cultures infected with equine arteritis virus (Heinrich et al., 2009) , African horse sickness virus (Stassen et al., 2007) or Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus (O'Brien, 2007) . More specifically for EHV-1, RNA interference has been effective both in vitro and in vivo, as assessed by a reduction in plaque formation in cell cultures and a reduction in clinical signs (weight loss) and viral replication within lung tissue in a murine model of EHV-1 infection (Fulton et al., 2009) .",

            "text": "In both experimental and field studies it has been suggested that a number of horse-related characteristics, most notably age and immune status can influence the nature and severity of disease resulting from EHV-1 infection (Allen, 2008; Henninger et al., 2007) . These factors were either not controlled or not known in this study, and might have influenced the results in ways that are not quantifiable. The epidemiological characteristics of EHV-1 infection also introduce the potential for variability. EHV-1 is endemic in equine populations worldwide, infecting foals at very young ages (Foote et al., 2004) and establishing latent infections that can recrudesce in times of stress (Slater et al., 1994) . The stress associated with transporting the study horses from a herd setting into an isolation unit might cause recrudescence of latent virus, possibly confounding some of the results. Although we examined the status of the horses to exclude acute recrudescence (by SN titers and clinical observations), reactivation of latent virus or more severe expression of the disease by co-infection(s) cannot formally be excluded. Our random allocation of the horses would have helped to distribute such confounding evenly between the two groups.",

Our small sample size in the siLuc control group was further affected by the fact that three of the four horses in that group required euthanasia prior to the end of the study. In the sigB3/siOri2-treated group, an impact was made by one horse that showed an unexpectedly severe and unusual course of the challenge infection. On day 3 pi, this horse developed nasal discharge of a character and volume different from that observed in all other horses and from what is typical after EHV-1 infection. Mucopurulent, blood-tinged nasal discharge was produced in very large amounts. At that time a nasopharyngeal swab was obtained and cultured for Streptococcus equi subspecies equi, but was negative. Additionally, nasal swabs and submandibular lymph node samples obtained post-mortem were negative for S. equi on PCR and nasal swabs were negative for equine influenza on PCR. Virus isolated from this horse was sequenced and was identical to the strain administered in this study (rAb4). This horse was one of the two sigB3/siOri2 horses that developed neurologic disease, and alone accounted for extended virus isolation from PBMCs on days 10, 12 and 14 in this group. We were unable to document intercurrent disease, viral recrudescence or viral mutation to justify subject exclusion; the impact of this one horse's unusually severe signs was much greater than it would have been in a larger population.",

Peak content of viral DNA in nasal secretions was lower in the sigB3/siOri2 group, and although this did not retain significance with Bonferroni correction, it lends support for the value of further study on the use of siRNA in EHV-1.",

Infection with neurovirulent EHV-1 strains results in higher levels of viremia compared to non-neurovirulent strains (Allen and Breathnach, 2006) , and a single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) in the DNA polymerase gene has been identified to account for this increased level of viremia (Goodman et al., 2007; Nugent et al., 2006; Van de Walle et al., 2009 ). Characteristics of the host's immune system including a slow rise in EHV-1 specific antibody titers and a low concentration of EHV-1 specific cytotoxic T-lymphocytes prior to infection have also been implicated as risk factors for horses developing EHM (Allen, 2008; Allen and Breathnach, 2006; Henninger et al., 2007) . Because all horses in this study were inoculated with the same EHV-1 strain, the neurovirulent rAb4, we expected that both temperature and viremia would be decreased in the sigB3/siOri2-treated group. The findings in the present study showed that neurological disease was mitigated in horses with the EHV-1 specific siRNAs compared to the control group, but no significant reduction in viremia or temperature was observed upon sigB3/siOri2 treatment. There was also no difference in viremia or SN titers of neurologic versus non-neurologic horses, irrespective of the treatment the horses received. These data considered together suggest a much more complex pathogenesis of EHM than our current understanding provides.",

Although there was no significant difference in viral shedding and viremia between the treated and control groups, euthanasia necessitated by intractable neurologic signs was sig-nificantly reduced after application of EHV-1 specific siRNA, which had been shown previously to interfere with virus replication in vitro and in a murine model of EHV-1 infection (Fulton et al., 2009) . Given the success seen thus far with the use of siRNA in other models of respiratory disease, we believe that modifications of the siRNAs and/or the dosing regimen used in this study would result in improved outcomes with respect to viremia and virus shedding, and a move towards the ultimate goal of an effective siRNA treatment for this devastating disease. Although progress has been made in recent years towards a better understanding of the disease, additional research to elucidate the relative contribution of viral, host and environmental factors is clearly warranted.",
