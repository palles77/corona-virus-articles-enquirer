We conducted histologic analysis and immunofluorescence (IF) staining for the detection of PDCoV antigens, and TUNEL assay in singly or serially cut tissue sections from the small and large intestines of four, 11-to 14-day-old gnotobiotic pigs, inoculated orally with 8.8-11.0 log 10 genomic equivalents (GE) of US PDCoV strains OH-FD22 or OH-FD100 (n = 3), or mock (n = 1). Similar comparative assays were done on LLC-PK and ST cells inoculated with the cell-adapted PDCoV strain OH-FD22-P44 (passage 44) in cell culture medium with 2.5-10 mg/ml of trypsin and 1% pancreatin, respectively. At post-inoculation days 3-4, infected pigs showed severe watery diarrhea and/or vomiting and mainly, diffuse, severe atrophic enteritis, with mild to moderate cytoplasmic vacuolation of the enteroctyes lining the atrophied villous epithelium. By IF, PDCoV antigens were evident in villous or crypt epithelial cells. No PDCoV antigenpositive, small and large intestinal villous or crypt epithelial cells, of which cytoplasm was also either vacuolated or morphologically normal, showed positive TUNEL staining. In contrast, by double IF and TUNEL staining, most of the TUNEL-positive signals (apoptotic nuclear fragmentation) were found in PDCoV antigen-positive LLC-PK and ST cells that also showed cytopathic effects, such as cell rounding, detachment and clumping in clusters. Secondary annexin V/propidium iodide (PI) staining revealed increased numbers of annexin V-or PI-positive LLC-PK and ST cells at 21 h after inoculation, compared to the negative controls. Thus, PDCoV does not induce apoptosis in the infected intestinal enterocytes in vivo, but in two infected cell lines of swine origin, LLC-PK and ST cells.",

In the US, PDCoV was reported from clinical cases of diarrhea in young pigs in early 2014 by Wang et al. in Ohio (Wang et al., 2014) , Marthaler et al. in Illinois (Marthaler et al., 2014) , and Li et al. in Iowa (Li et al., 2014) . The virus has spread continuously nationwide, causing deaths among nursing pigs. The disease is clinically and pathologically similar to porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) and transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) , but with reportedly lower mortality rates. Experimental infection studies showed that PDCoV infects large numbers of villous epithelial cells of the small intestine at 3-4 days after oral inoculation (Chen et al., 2015; . Infected enterocytes appeared to acutely undergo vacuolar, or hydropic, degeneration and exfoliated extensively from the villous epithelium, followed by villous atrophy (Chen et al., 2015; . This process appeared to be associated with necrosis of infected cells. However, further studies are needed to verify whether PDCoV-infected enterocytes in vivo undergo necrosis or apoptosis.",

The viral RNA titer of the OH-FD22-P44 used in this study was 9.9 log 10 GE/ml, and the infectious titer was 9.7 log 10 plaque forming units/ml. When a multiplicity of infection (MOI) of 0.1 was used for viral inoculation in LLC-PK and ST cells, a diffuse (up to 100%) cell clumping and moderate cell detachment as cytopathic effects (CPE) was generally observed in LLC-PK cells (treated with 2.5-10 mg/ml of trypsin) and ST cells (treated with 1% pancreatin) at PID 1. On the other hand, when a MOI of 0.01 was used for viral inoculation in LLC-PK and ST cells, only a 2-5% CPE was observed at PID 1 but a sudden, complete cell detachment was observed at PID 1.5-2 in LLC-PK cells (treated with 2.5-10 mg/ml of trypsin) and ST cells (treated with 1% pancreatin). Therefore, a MOI of 0.1 was used for viral inoculation in LLC-PK and ST cells for an adequate detection of apoptotic cell death as tested at PID 1 and earlier time-points. Compared with the original OH-FD22 strain, OH-FD22-P11 and -P20, passaged in both ST and LLC-PK cells, each had five nucleotide changes in the S genes . In both cell culture lines, the mutations observed at P11 were sustained through P40, with 100% nucleotide identity in P11, P20, and P40 (Hu et al., 2015, unpublished data) . The pathogenicity of the OH-FD22-P40 in inoculated Gn pigs also appeared to be similar to that of the original field OH-FD22 virus (Hu et al., 2015, unpublished data) .",

In general, acute vacuolation or swelling of cytoplasm characterizes cell death caused by hypoxia as a result of failure of the sodium-potasium ion pump mechanism (Jones et al., 1997) . Cytolytic viruses cause necrosis of infected cells by interfering with their ability to synthesize proteins and produce energy essential for maintaining cell life and homeostasis; and mechanically damaging cellular organelles and membranes with accumulations of large amounts of viral nucleic acids and/or proteins (Jones et al., 1997) . We speculate that these are possible Apoptotic cells are pathologically characterized by nuclear and cytoplasmic shrinkage and nuclear fragmentation without significant damage of nuclear and cytoplasmic membranes. On the other hand, when necrotic cells acutely undergo swelling or vacuolation of the cytoplasm and then irreversible injury of cytoplasmic membrane, they are mostly characterized by irreversible nuclear alterations, such as pyknosis, karyorrhexis, or karyolysis, due to permanent disruption of nuclear membranes. These distinct pathological aspects may differentiate necrosis from apoptosis.",

The latter example includes classical swine fever virus (CSFV) causing no death of infected SWC3+ granulocytes as the major replication site of the virus in infected pigs, but apoptosis of bystander cells, CD4+ and CD8+ T cells (Ganges et al., 2008) . Viral inhibition of necrosis or apoptotic cell death of infected cells may also prolong survival of intracellular virus (Miller and Fox, 2004) . In contrast to the capacity of PDCoV to induce necrosis of infected enterocytes in vivo, death of PDCoV-infected LLC-PK or ST cells is via apoptosis, directly related to viral infection and replication. In our study, TUNEL-positive signals (apoptotic nuclear fragmentation) were mostly in LLC-PK or ST cells positive for both PDCoV antigen and virus-induced CPE. Our study also identified increased numbers of inoculated LLC-PK or ST cells positive for annexin V as a marker of one of early apoptosis-related physiological changes, cell membrane alteration. Based on our annexin V/PI staining results, in LLC-PK cells at 21 h after inoculation, the cells positive for both annexin V and PI might include late-stage apoptotic cells or necrotic cells. On the other hand, in ST cells at 21 h after inoculation when the extent of CPE was similar to that in inoculated LLC-PK cells, there were both early-stage apoptotic cells and late-stage apoptotic cells or necrotic cells.",

Our present study revealed that PDCoV does not induce apoptosis in the infected intestinal enterocytes in vivo, but apoptosis is induced in two cell lines of swine origin which have been used for the isolation and propagation of PDCoV, LLC-PK and ST cells. Future studies are needed to delineate the detailed mechanisms involved in cell death of PDCoV-infected cells in the in vivo and in vitro microenvironment.",

(C) In situ TUNEL staining of a serial section of the jejunum of inoculated pig 1 (Panels A and B), showing no increase of TUNEL-positive (apoptotic) cells (red staining) in the villous epithelium positive for PDCoV antigen, compared to Panel D (negative control). (D) In situ TUNEL staining of formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded jejunum of non-inoculated, negative control pig 4, showing few TUNEL-positive (apoptotic) cells (red staining) in the intestinal villous epithelium.
