The meanings of quarantine and isolation are quite often different between first responders and first receivers (i.e., those who work in hospitals). Within each first responder discipline (e.g., emergency medical technician [EMT] and paramedic, firefighter, and police officer), there are different roles to play and connections or responsibilities, as determined by position, training, and/or experience. Confusion often occurs between the terms isolation and quarantine; many people use the term quarantine to mean either isolation or quarantine. Both are public health measures used to control the spread of contagious disease: \u2022 Isolation is used to separate and restrict the movement of those who are ill with a communicable disease. \u2022 Quarantine is used to separate and restrict the movement of those who are still well but who may have been exposed to a communicable disease.",

Although restrictive measures discussed in this chapter may be of significant benefit to the afflicted society as a whole, they may meet resistance and raise ethical dilemmas. This may be alleviated by attempting to induce voluntary compliance by always proposing restrictive measures that are proportional to a given threat and providing transparency at all stages of a restrictive quarantine. 1 In the United States in particular, balancing personal liberties with societal benefit rapidly becomes an ethical dilemma without a clear resolution. The word quarantine often carries a stigma and negative connotation-to restrict movement, isolate, and maintain a safe distance from \"contaminated\" individuals. This becomes especially problematic when a rapid quarantine is clearly the safest option for the nation as a whole following a significant communicable exposure event.",

            "text": "For thousands of years humankind has recognized the need to isolate from the general population persons, animals, and goods that have been exposed to contagious elements. As early as 583 AD, authorities restricted the association of lepers and healthy people, building on the biblical sources in Leviticus. 1 History reveals that the use of the term quarantine only recently entered the first responder lexicon despite its having been in practice back to biblical times. 4 In the fourteenth century, Europe endured repeated episodes of the plague, with an estimated loss of one third of the population. The plague spread rapidly throughout Europe, beginning in the south in 1347, and reaching England, Germany, and Russia within 3 years. 5 Fear, combined with the severe impact of the plague, led to the development of intense measures to attempt to control the spread of the disease-measures we would currently call infection control. Some of the more severe measures include the abandonment of the ill in the fields outside Reggio, Italy, in 1374. By order of Viscount Bernabo, patients were left in the fields to recover or die on their own. 6 Similarly, in the area currently occupied by the modern city of Dubrovnik, Croatia, the chief physician of the city, Jacob of Padua, advocated the establishment of an area outside of the city walls for those needing treatment for the \"black death.\" 7 This separation was motivated by an early theory of contagion; however, the efforts were only modestly effective. It was this lack of effectiveness that prompted the Great Council of the city to develop more aggressive methods to prevent the spread of future epidemics. 6 In 1377 the Great Council established a four-pillared approach to a trentino, or 30-day isolation period. 6 The four pillars include the following: 1. The exclusion of citizens or visitors from plague-endemic areas from the city of Ragusa until they had been in isolation for 30 days 2. The restriction that no person from Ragusa could go to the isolation area without remaining there for 30 days 3. That any person who was not assigned by the Great Council to care for those in quarantine was not permitted to bring food or other items to someone in isolation without having to remain there for 30 days 4. That anyone who did not follow these regulations would be fined and subjected to isolation for 30 days Similar laws were introduced in Marseilles, Venice, Pisa, and Genoa during the following 80 years, 8, 9 although during this time the period of isolation was extended from 30 to 40 days. This 40-day period was known as a quarantino, which was derived from the Italian quaranta or forty. 3, 10 Although the rationale for extending the period to 40 days is not known, it has been suggested that the shorter trentino period of 30 days was found to not be long enough to prevent the spread of the plague. 11 Others have suggested that the change was related to the 40-day period of the Christian observance of Lent 4 or the 40-day period associated with many other significant biblical events (the great flood, Moses' time on Mount Sinai, or Jesus' time in the desert). 12 Still others have suggested that the foundation for the quarantino came from the Greek doctrine of \"critical days,\" which stated that contagious disease occurs within 40 days of exposure. 5, 11 Regardless of the rationale, the duration embodied within quarantino provides the fundamental concept for our present-day quarantine.",

This strategy allows first responders to rapidly determine whether the incident is of a biological, chemical, or radiological/nuclear etiology and adjust quarantine recommendations accordingly.

However, in modern practice, the term also applies to detention, in holding areas, following exposures and prior to decontamination for chemical and radiological or nuclear events. Modern quarantine may be initiated whenever an individual or group is known or suspected to have contracted, or been exposed to, a highly contagious or dangerous disease or a chemical contamination. Public health authorities must ensure that there are resources available to provide care for those in quarantine and to implement and maintain the quarantine. It is also imperative that authorities provide for the expeditious provision of health care for those in quarantine, including coordination with the local health care delivery system, heightened surveillance and monitoring, expedited diagnosis and treatment, and preventive treatment (vaccination, prophylactic antibiotics, and PPE). 15, 16 Within any potential circumstance in which a modern quarantine might be issued, the primary goal is to reduce disease transmission by increasing the \"social distance\" between persons (i.e., reducing the number of people each person comes into contact with). 17 To accomplish this there are a wide variety of strategies for disease control that may be implemented individually or in combination with one another. These strategies include shelter-in-place, short-term voluntary home curfew, restrictions on public gatherings and events (including travel and mass transit restrictions), and cordoning off an area with a sanitary barrier. 18 Modern quarantine can be effective in some cases even when it is only partial quarantine (i.e., where many or most, but not all, exposed persons are quarantined). 17 This partial or \"leaky\" quarantine, particularly when combined with a program of vaccination, has been effective in slowing the rate of the spread of disease, including SARS and smallpox. 19 Distance and duration of exposure are commonly found to be important predictors of transmission. Accordingly public health authorities employ modern quarantine procedures that involve limited numbers of exposed persons in small areas. These small areas or zones are designed as \"rings\" or concentric circles drawn around individual disease cases. 20 Only those who fall within the ring of exposure duration or distance would be quarantined along with the individual disease case, with the most intensive disease control activities in the inner ring.",

First responders may be called upon by the incident commander to assist with provision of needed services throughout the duration of the incident and/or quarantine.

For each of these items, it is critical that the first responder understands the signs, symptoms, and effects of CBRN substances (weaponized or nonweaponized CBRN materials that can cause significant harm) and is familiar with HazMat management. 1 Under control of their respective governor, each state possesses assets that may be deployed to assist in the event of an incident. The National Guard Civil Support Teams (CSTs) are one of the most critical components for quarantine responses. A state's Office of Emergency Services coordinates the request for and deployment of the CSTs.

Recognition not only protects each individual and other first responders, but also enables first responders to initiate the system-wide responses necessary to manage these incidents. Most training also emphasizes the adherence to established protocols designed to detect hazardous agents on a minute level by the first arriving units. One aspect of these protocols establishes the criteria for involving the highly advanced capabilities of specialized HazMat and weapons of mass destruction (WMD) teams and state and federal resources, if necessary. Recognition that an incident is beyond the management capability of local resources and involves HazMat or WMD would be an initial reason for an incident commander to reach out through an EOC for state or federal resources. This is particularly true when combined with patients exhibiting signs and symptoms of exposure to HazMat or WMD. State resources that may be called upon include agencies such as CSTs. Federal assistance may be requested by the incident commander in coordination with an EOC at the local and state levels through the proper channels. State and federal authorities throughout a state's Office of Emergency Management and Department of Homeland Security (DHS) monitor incidents of significance and of larger magnitudes.

Unexposed individuals within a quarantine zone may benefit from immunization or prophylactic therapies. These prophylactic measures do not have to include the entire at-risk population; however, as evidenced by the 2009 U.S. H1N1 and oseltamivir programs, it may be of benefit to prophylactically treat vulnerable populations, including those with high risk of exposure and immunocompromised individuals, depending on the agent of concern. 28 The decision to offer prophylaxis to some members of the population must be done carefully and with clear dissemination of public information to avoid confusion and unnecessary treatments. For example, the public fear of radiation exposure and misguided rush for iodine tablets following the 2011 Fukushima nuclear disaster caused undue stresses and unnecessary treatments even in distant European nations. 29 Close, at-home observation remains a viable option, as does the performance of serial examinations on those with known exposure to a contagion or environmental toxin.

However, depending on the type of exposure it may be acceptable to enforce at-home isolation with relief of work duties and other activities that would place a known contagious individual in public spaces. Depending on the natural history of the disease, any isolative measures should be lifted as soon as possible once a contagious period has passed to avoid any further public distrust. 1 Restricting movement in any capacity will likely displace individuals from their homes, as may already be the case in any large-scale disaster associated with nuclear or airborne toxins. Shelter provisions should clearly be provided to those displaced by circumstance, though front-line medical care teams must remain vigilant for signs of communicable exposures. If water sources and other sanity conditions decline, the ease of disease transmission will exponentially increase. As a result disaster response teams should consider ways to quarantine and potentially isolate infectious individuals under even the worst conditions, if at all possible, to help reduce new cases in a refugee shelter situation.",

For example, during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak, the United States and Canada instigated voluntary home quarantine of sick individuals and closed public meeting places, including schools and malls, with moderate success. In comparison China enacted a strict quarantine lasting 60 days in many major urban areas, including Beijing, with military enforcement to restrict personal movement until the quarantine period was cleared. 30 Although differences in governmental policies and ability to rapidly restrict travel and public space usage exist, restricting the movement of individuals in and out of a quarantine zone will be critical to help prevent additional spread of the targeted exposure. In particular, careful screening of major air and seaport passengers will likely become necessary, again depending on the type of contagious material and natural history of the disease. Travel restrictions can be especially effective in the early phases of a quarantine to help limit the rapid spread of undetected cases, though sensitive measures are difficult to discern early in a disease process, as evidenced by the questionably ineffective efforts during the 2009 H1N1 outbreak to fever screen airport passengers at airports. 31, 32 Restriction of clearly symptomatic individuals from making both local and international travel can be a method to help prevent rapid spread, though as with any restrictive measure this must be carried out in an evidence-based method and tailored to the pathogen at hand.",

For example, given initial suspicions that the SARS pandemic of 2002 and 2003 may have originated in civet cats sold in public markets, China quickly moved to ban the sale or transport of these animals. Civet farms were closed until additional information became available, to prevent any further animal-born spread of SARS cases. 33 In the present-day, globalized economy, this prospect can be especially difficult, making strict port-of-entry precautions, including freight examination, testing, and quarantine, necessary to combat a given zoonotic exposure. 34 These policies will certainly come with economic consequences and the decision to enact mandatory culling, isolation, or trade restrictions on a specific animal or animal product must not be taken lightly, but instead enacted with clear intentions and clear public information regarding necessity.",

In addition to standard hospital policies already in place for infection isolation and environmental decontamination, quarantine measures may include cohorting of patients and health care workers among institutions to reduce the exposure spread to all institutions.

Schools can also be temporarily repurposed as shelters, outbreak clinics, or government rally points for further management after a major disaster. The decision to close individual or entire systems of schools should be based on the nature of the exposure and the need for facility repurposement. Simulated influenza pandemic models also suggest that school closures can alleviate strain on local health care assets by reducing new cases in both children and adults. 35 After schools are reopened it is prudent to instruct school officials regarding signs and symptoms of exposure-related illness in order to detect any new cases early and prevent further spread. School events, including sports and social gatherings, should be treated like other mass gatherings after a major disaster with quarantine rules extending to these events as well. Isolation measures within schools could help to facilitate ongoing educational concerns; however, the logistics of effective isolation inside of most schools are likely near impossible.

Business closures and mandatory sick days can be difficult to enforce, especially in open-market settings with many small business owners operating independently. As evidenced by China's actions to ban the sale or transport of civet cats during the SARS pandemic, direct interventions on commerce can help to alleviate further exposure spread during a quarantine. 33 It is also important to note the impact of quarantine measures on local business and commerce. Areas highly dependent on tourism and international travel can be dramatically impacted by public fears associated with voluntary or mandatory quarantine. Some estimates place Beijing at a U.S. $1.4 billion loss with regards to tourism alone as a result of the SARS outbreak of 2003. 36 Ideally, rapid action and site control can help to minimize the spread of a radiological, nuclear, or biological agent, with hopes to minimize the spread initially and prevent any need for long-term quarantine with significant financial impact. As a quarantine continues, business will suffer from supply shortages and product stagnation-things that must be considered and will certainly account for ongoing financial losses.

            "text": "\u2022 Balancing civil liberty with quarantine: Any quarantine or isolation will fundamentally restrict certain civil liberties. In the health care setting, specific policies regarding patient isolation are at the discretion of the treating facility, but in the public sphere, isolation measures become ethically challenging. As previously emphasized, the principle of utilizing the least restrictive means possible to accomplish public protection must be at the forefront of any quarantine planning. This strategy will ideally optimize voluntary compliance, which in turn will yield an overall higher protection rate than an overly aggressive quarantine with very poor public compliance. As with any public health crisis, every effort should be made to maintain personal privacy, especially regarding infectious status, whenever possible. Throughout history, quarantines and restriction of societal rights have been utilized in ethical atrocities, and this must be guarded against with well-defined checks and balances to prevent any unintended consequences of a public health effort. \u2022 Restricting personal movement and travel capabilities can quickly lead to civil unrest and social stigma. It is important to differentiate and remove any growing blame on infected individuals and redirect focus toward treatment and prevention of further spread. A study of the 2003 SARS outbreak quarantine in Toronto demonstrated that those entering an enforced quarantine were especially concerned with their ability to maintain work wages, obtain groceries, and continue their prior way of life after the quarantine was lifted. All of these concerns are certainly legitimate and are exacerbated by the intentional interruption of daily routine and removal of routine civil rights. Regardless, during times of significant natural disaster, nuclear fallout, or biological terrorism, civil rights may need to be temporarily restricted to help protect the interests of society as a greater whole. The challenge for public officials will be to ensure that this is done in an equitable and reasonable fashion, with allowances and appropriate support for those placed within a quarantine zone, and removal of restricted measures as quickly as the situation permits. \u2022 Obtaining compliance: Whenever rights or activities are restricted by a governing body, a significant amount of civil unrest can result. This can be especially problematic following a major disaster when societal fears and media frenzy have reached maximum levels. Utilizing quarantine as a means of greater public defense and disaster response must always take the forefront of any restrictive efforts with careful attention to ensure that it is not being utilized as a punishment or political tool against a specific population. Clear public communication forums to reinforce that the goal of any isolation or restriction is to prevent the spread of disease and minimize the overall impact of a natural or terrorist-driven exposure. \u2022 Unified and consistent statements and stances regarding the best methods for preventing new cases, treating those already exposed, and minimizing civil disruption are critical for the front-line physicians and public health officials. Issues of compensation for lost wages, care for family members, and similar concerns of persons subject to quarantine cannot be ignored. As evidenced by the North American influenza pandemics of 2008 and 2009, education and communication with the public are key components to encourage voluntary cooperation. Public health officials must ensure that restrictive measures are appropriate and proportional for the targeted exposure, implemented uniformly across all socioecomonic statuses, and followed with highly transparent official communications to maintain public engagement. 1 Just as careful planning is required to set up an appropriate and effective quarantine, health policy makers must be equally prudent as they deescalate any restrictive measures. Emphasis on resumption of normal routine and the importance of continued monitoring throughout all levels of the health care system can assist in this transition and help to reduce the chances of post-event turmoil. \u2022 Attention fatigue: Constant vigilance is necessary to maintain quarantine, isolation, and infection control measures following a massexposure event. Initial disbelief, even if scientifically justified, can lead to a low index of clinical suspicion. This is especially true in the early phase of a major disaster when the exact details and etiology behind a patient's symptoms may be unclear. In the modern era of sophisticated biological weapons and the potential for multiplemodality terrorist events, clinicians cannot allow tunnel vision to prevent them from noticing and differentiating pathology. It is also worth noting that even during a mass-exposure disaster, there will still be more typical medical problems requiring emergency intervention. As a result, front-line physicians and other health care providers must maintain attention to clinical details and prevent diagnostic momentum from building based on recent local events. That being said, erring on the side of caution is likely prudent given an unexplained clinical picture with undifferentiated terrorist or natural exposures and with an accepted number of false positives receiving treatment or isolation for precautionary measures. \u2022 Conflicting goals: Physicians and other medical professionals are already accustomed to placing the needs of their patients first. This becomes especially difficult when a specific diagnosis mandates additional isolative measures. After any anxiety-provoking disaster, there will be a significant number of patients seeking reassurance following the development of suspected symptoms. Making decisions that will require treatment can be compounded by additional ethical dilemmas given a patient's entire socioeconomic sphere, in particular if removing a breadwinner from standard duties. It becomes difficult for the front-line physician to protect an entire population from further exposures while also advocating for their individual patients. Preexisting relationships with patients and community members can also exacerbate a clinician's ethical dilemma, especially when a particular diagnosis holds isolating repercussions. \u2022 This conflict between medical responsibility to individuals and entire populations creates many of the pitfalls surrounding a mass-exposure event. It is especially difficult to maintain professional relationships with patients when trust is questioned following instigation of restrictive measures. Clinicians must communicate clearly and provide effective education to their patients, especially regarding prophylaxis and treatment options. In the initial phase of a mass-exposure event, the front-line provider will be faced with difficult decisions, only further compounded by often conflicted goals of individual and community protection. \u2022 Communication: Communication between health care professionals (including first responders) and law enforcement, between the health care professionals and the community, and between governmental authorities and the public require honesty, clarity of message, and frequent updating. Trust, consistency, and credibility are essential. Professional public information officers (PIOs) should manage all communication strategies.",
