M AJOR histocompatibility complex (MHC) 1 class 1I molecules are polymorphic cell surface glycoproteins expressed primarily on specialized antigenpresenting cells such as macrophages, dendritic cells, and B lymphocytes. They bind peptides derived from exogenous proteins and present them to CD4 + helper T cells as part of the mechanism for recognizing foreign antigens and stimulating an immune response. MHC class II molecules displayed on the cell surface are ct/3 heterodimers, but during their intracellular transport to the cell surface, they are transiently associated with a third nonpolymorphic polypeptide, the invariant chain (Ii) . Ii is a type II membrane protein with different isoforms that arise from alternative splicing of one exon and the use of two translation initiation sites (Strubin et al., 1986; O'Sullivan et al., 1987; Koch et al., 1987) .",

Ii determines the membrane trafficking of MHC class II a/3 dimers (Bakke and Dobberstein, 1990; Lotteau et al., 1990) and also blocks their peptide-binding site during transit through the biosynthetic pathway (Roche and Cresswell, 1990; Teyton et al., 1990; Roche et al., 1992) . Ij is assembled with class II a and 13 polypepfides in the endoplasmic reticulum, and, after its transport through the Golgi region, the a/3Ii complex is sorted out of the constitutive biosynthetic pathway to an acidic compartment within the endocytic system (Cresswell, 1985; Lamb et al., 1991; Pieters et al., 1991) . Within this prelysosomal (Peters et al., 1991) , early lysosomal (Harding and Geuze, 1993) , or endosomal com-pa~i,uent (Guagliardi et al., 1990) , Ii dissociates from class II a/3 dimers, permitting binding ofpeptides from exogenous foreign antigens generated in the endocytic pathway. Class II a/3 dimers loaded with peptide are then transported to the cell surface, while the free Ii is rapidly degraded (Blum and Cresswell, 1988; Pieters et al., 1991) . Although a/3Ii complexes are thought to be delivered to an endocytic compartment predominantly by an intracellular mute, small amounts of Ii and aflli complexes have been detected on the cell surface, and rapid internalization of a/3Ii complexes has been reported (Wraight et al., 1990; Lotteau et al., 1990; Roche et al., 1993) . These data suggest that at least some newly synthesized li molecules are transported to an cndocytic compartment via the plasma membrane, a route analogous to that taken by some integral lysosomal membrane proteins, e.g., lysosomal acid phosphatase (Braun et al., 1989; Peters et al., 1990) .",

Both signals contain two adjacent large hydrophobic nonaromatic residues suggesting that this may be a common feature of non-tyrosinebased sorting signals. Trafficking of Ii-TR chimeras to an cndocytic compartment where they are degraded is dependent upon these signals but occurs predominantly by a direct intracclhlar route, implying that the non-tyrosine-based sorting signals arc efficiently recognized by sorting machinery located in the trans-Golgi. This cndocytic compartment is distinct from the sorting and recycling endosomal compartments traversed by the wild-type TR, and, therefore, is located within the prelysosomal/lysosomal branch of the endocytic pathway. In addition, wc show that efficient delivery of Ii-TR chimeras to this endocytic compartment requires an independent signal in the Ii transmembrane region.",

However, the Ii cytoplasmic tail contains three leucine residues (residues 7, 14, and 17) within the first 17 amino-terminal residues (Fig. 1) , suggesting that internalization of the Ii-TR chimeras may be mediated by signals related to the dileucine-based sorting signals previously identified in the cytoplasmic tails of the T cell receptor CD3\"y chain and the cation-independent and cation-dependent mannose-6-pbosphate receptors (Letourneur and Klausner, 1992; Johnson and Kornfeld, 1992a,b) . Although first identified as a lysosomal targeting signal, the CD37 chain di-leucine signal has been shown to function as an internalization signal (Letourneur and Klausner, 1992; White, S., J. F. Collawn, and I. S. Trowbridge, unpublished results). Di-leucine-based sorting signals have not been extensively characterized; however, isoleucine can substitute for the second leucine, but not the first, in the CD3~/di-leucine signal without loss of lysosomal targeting activity, whereas alteration of either leucine to alanine substantially reduces activity (Letourneur and Klausnet, 1992) . Because of the stricter requirement for leucine in the first position of the CD3~, chain signal, we initially thought that the two internalization signals identified by deletional analysis may involve I.,\u00a2uTIle s and Leu~4pro is, respectively. To investigate this possibility, the two residues of either one or both of these di-peptides were altered to alanine. Strikingly, independently altering each di-peptide to two alanine residues reduced the apparent internalization efficiency of the Iicr chimera by ~,50%, whereas alteration of both dipeptides completely abrogated high efficiency endocytosis (Table ID . These results supported the idea that the Ii cytoplasmic tail contains two non-tyrosine-based signals with similar internalization activity that are related to the CD3\"y chain di-leucine signal.",

However, whereas alteration of Pro ~s to alanine abolished the internalization activity of the membrane-proximal signal, alteration of Leu 14 to alanine increased its efficiency. This result implied that the membrane-proximal signal was novel and led us to examine whether the two hydrophobic residues, Met ~6 and Leu ~7, on the carboxy-terminal side of Pro ~5 were required. As shown in Table HI , alteration of either Met ~6 or Leu 17 to alanine completely abrogated the activity of the membrane-proximal sorting signal in the Ii cytoplasmic tall.

In contrast, the wild-type TR had a half-life of '~24 h, consistent with previous estimates of wild-type human TR turnover rates in CEF . The Iicr\u00f7a~ chimera was consistently degraded >2-fold more rapidly than the Iier chimera, implying that the Ii transmembrane region influences intracellular trafficking. After 2 h (Fig. 2) , the Mr of TR and Ii-TR chimeras increased to that of the mature glycoprotein and the molecules became partially resistant to endoglycosidase H digestion (data not shown). This indicates that the Ii-TR chimeras traverse the Golgi where glycosylation is completed and are degraded in a post-Golgi compartment. The Ii-TR chimera lacking the non-tyrosine-based signals was degraded more slowly, indicating that these signals are required for delivery to this compartment. Further, the rate of synthesis of the Iicx and Iicr+m chimeras was 4-and 8-fold higher, respectively, than that of wild-type TR even though the chimeric receptors were expressed in lower amounts on the cell surface suggesting most of the chimeric molecules were trafficking by a direct intracellular route to the endocytic compartment where they were degraded. Degradation of Ii is partially inhibited by lysosomotropic agents such as chloroquine, monensin, and leupeptin (Ilium and Cresswell, 1988; Nguyen and Humphreys 1989; Pieters et al., 1991; Zachgo et al., 1992) . Similarly, leupeptin significantly inhibited the degradation of the Iicr+rM chimera, as indicated by the slower rate of disappearance of the intact molecule and the appearance of partial proteolytic products derived from the TR external domain (Fig. 3) , which is consistent with degradation occurring in an endocytic compartment. Comparable results were obtained with chloroquine treatment (data not shown).",

The same or overlapping signals are recognized in the trans-Golgi and mediate direct sorting along an intracellular route to the endocytic pathway. One signal involves Leu 7 and Ile s and appears to be analogous to the di-leucine lysosomal targeting signal identified in the cytoplasmic domain of the CD3\"y chain (Letourneur and Klausner, 1992) . Deletion of residues 2-5 from the Icr chimera cytoplasmic tall reduces the internalization activity to ,~50%, implying that, as for the di-leucine signal of the CD33, chain (Letourneur and Klausner, 1992) , residues to the amino-terminal side of Leuqle s are required for activity. The second sorting signal requires prols, Met16, and Leu ~7, and, therefore, differs significantly from the dileucine and leucine-isoleucine motifs identified previously (Letourner and Klausner, 1992; Johnson and Kornfeld, 1992a,b; Ogata and Fukuda, 1994) . Nevertheless, all these signals, including both 11 signals, contain two adjacent large nonaromatic hydrophobic residues and may, therefore, represent a family of related structural motifs specified by short linear arrays of amino acids that differ in specific sequence, analogous to tyrosine-based signals (Trowbridge et al., 1993) . Additional mutagenesis is required, however, to define these sorting signals more precisely, to identify any common features they may share, and to delineate any differences between signals recognized in the trans-Golgi or at the plasma membrane. At present, we believe it most appropriate to refer to them as non-tyrosine-based signals, a neutral term that serves to distinguish them from tyrosine-based signals.",

Ii-TR chimeras trafficking to the plasma membrane can be quantitated because receptors appearing transiently at the cell surface can be labeled with exogenous Tf. Thus, the surface-accessible pools of the Ii-TR chimeras can be determined by measuring ~25I-labeled Tf bound to surface and internalized chimeric receptors under steady-state conditions. The surface-accessible pool of the Iicr+rM chimera was only 19% of the wild-type TR pool despite the fact that the ,,o 8-fold increase in the degradation rate of the Iicr+rM surface-accessible pool is offset by a similar increased rate of biosynthesis relative to wild-type TR (see Materials and Methods for details of the calculation). Assuming that essentially all wild-type TRs bind Tf under steady-state labeling conditions, it can be calculated that only 19 % of the Iicr+rM chimera traffics via the cell surface, and, therefore, that >80% of the chimera must be delivered by a direct intraceilular route to the endocytic compartment where it is degraded. Similarly, \u202250% of the Iicr chimera is degraded without ever being displayed on the cell surface. The lysosomal membrane glycoprotein, Lgp-A (LEP100, LAMP-1), also traffics along the endocytic pathway to the lysosome by a direct intracellular route or via the cell surface, although which route is the major pathway is less clear and may depend upon expression level (Williarns and Fukuda, 1990; Mathews et al., 1992; Halter and Mellman, 1992) .",

However, the data also indicate that the Ii-TR chimeras which enter directly from the trans-Golgi are delivered to a degradafive compartment more efficiently than those which enter from the plasma membrane. Our recent observations on the TR-contalning endosome in CEF (Hopkins et al., 1994) show that it is a morphologically complex compatmient and suggest that it consists of at least two interconnected subcompartments in which internalized TRs are processed at different rates. Receptors entering the TR-containing endosome can either be recycled rapidly (tee in 10 rain) or remain for more prolonged periods (t~r2 in 30 min) before returning to the surface. The data on Ii-TR chimeras can thus be explained by proposing that most of the chimeras which enter from the cell surface travel via the rapidly recycling pathway and that on each cycle only \u202230% of them are sorted towards the lysosome. Direct transfer from the trans-Golgi, though more efficient, probably occurs via the subcompartment of the endosome which lies within its immediate vicinity in the pericentriolar area and through which TR are processed more slowly.",

Pieters et al. (1993) showed that the Ii cytoplasmic tall was sufficient to target a heterologous protein, influenza neuraminidase, to the endocytic pathway. However, they noted significant differences between the localization of the Ii-neuraminidase chimera and Ii within the endocytic pathway and concluded that other sorting information may be contained within the Ii transmembrane region and/or extracellular domain. In a second study, Nilsson et al. (1991) reported that an Ii chimera containing the cytoplasmic tail of 8-1,4 galactosyltransferase, an enzyme normally localized to the trans-Golgi by a retention signal within its transmembrane region, paradoxically had a subcellular distribution similar to wild-type Ii (p31). The galactosyltransferase cytoplasmic tall contains a dileucine sequence which may function as a sorting signal and when complemented by the Ii transmembrane region signal promote similar trafficking to wild-type Ii.",
