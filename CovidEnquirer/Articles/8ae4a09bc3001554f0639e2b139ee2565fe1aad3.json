            "text": "Background: We and others have shown that dipeptidyl peptidase-IV (DPP4) expression is increased in obesity/ atherosclerosis and is positively correlated with atherosclerotic burden. However, the mechanism by which DPP4 expression is regulated in obesity remains unclear. In this study, we investigated the pathways regulating the expression of DPP4 on macrophages. Methods: Flowsight\u00ae Imaging Flow Cytometry was employed for the detection of DPP4 and immunophenotyping. DPP4 enzymatic activity was measured by a DPPIV-Glo\u2122 Protease Assay kit. Findings: Human monocytes expressed a moderate level of membrane-bound DPP4. Obese patients with body mass index (BMI) \u2265 30 had a higher level of monocyte DPP4 expression, in parallel with higher levels of HOMA-IR, blood glucose, triglycerides, and non-HDL cholesterol, compared to those in the non-obese (BMI b 30) patients. Oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), but not native LDL, up-regulated DPP4 expression on macrophages with a preferential increase in CD36 + cells. OxLDL mediated DPP4 up-regulation was considerably diminished by Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) knockdown and CD36 deficiency. TRIF deficiency, but not MyD88 deficiency, attenuated oxLDL-induced DPP4 increase. Interpretation: Our study suggests a key role for oxLDL and downstream CD36/TLR4/TRIF in regulating DPP4 expression. Increased DPP4 in response to oxidized lipids may represent an integrated mechanism linking postprandial glucose metabolism to lipoprotein abnormality-potentiated atherosclerosis.",

In addition to its catalytic function, DPP4 interacts with a number of ligands such as adenosine deaminase (ADA), caveolin-1, Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) spike protein, fibronectin, and is thought to play an important role as a mediator of inflammation [3] [4] [5] [6] .",

            "text": "In addition to its cell surface membrane-bound form, DPP4 also exists as a cleaved catalytically active extracellular domain circulating in plasma [7] . DPP4 is highly expressed on T cells, monocytes and antigen-presenting cells in adipose tissue and associated with T cellmediated inflammation [8, 9] . In addition, DPP4 is increased in obese patients with expression positively correlating to the degree of insulin resistance [8, 9] . Membrane bound DPP4 on hematopoietic and adipocytes may contribute to a substantial proportion of plasma DPP4 [9, 10] , implicating that DPP4 on these cell types acts as an important regulator of incretin action. Studies by our team and other groups have suggested an important role for immune cell-expressing DPP4 in diabetes and cardiovascular disease [8, [11] [12] [13] . However, the mechanisms and mediators of DPP4 expression on these cells are poorly understood. Given the central role of monocyte/macrophage in atherosclerosis, we recently reported that the expression of DPP4 on monocytes and plasma DPP4 activity were increased in patients with atherosclerosis and positively correlated with atherosclerotic plaque volume [14] . In addition, the DPP4 expression level on monocytes was also associated with plasma levels of non-HDL cholesterol and triglycerides [14] . However, the mechanisms by which DPP4 is up-regulated in cardiometabolic disease remain elucidated. In this study, we found that treatment of oxidized low-density lipoprotein (oxLDL), but not native LDL, elevated DPP4 expression on macrophages, which was attenuated by the inhibition of Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4) or downstream Toll/IL-1R domaincontaining adaptor-inducing IFN-\u03b2 (TRIF). DPP4 expression almost exclusively occurred on CD36 + monocytes and CD36 deficient macrophages showed an attenuated up-regulation of DPP4 in response to oxLDL. For the first time to our knowledge, these findings demonstrated an important role for oxidized lipids in immune cell DPP4 regulation and may provide an integrated mechanism linking abnormal postprandial glucose metabolism with oxidized lipids and inflammation.",

A written informed consent was obtained from all the participants before the study. A total of 27 patients with previously documented cardiovascular disease enrolled in the ALPINE trial were included in this study. The ALPINE, a phase 4 clinical trial (ClinicalTrials.gov Identifier: NCT01417104), has been described elsewhere [15] . Patients with established cardiovascular disease were recruited in Columbus, Ohio from 2009 to 2011 and randomized to receive either placebo or aliskiren treatment. Cardiovascular disease was defined as at least 1 of the following: myocardial infarction, cerebrovascular accident, previous coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and/or percutaneous coronary intervention or peripheral arterial disease (ankle-brachial index b0.9 and/or prior peripheral intervention or surgery). HOMA-IR was calculated as follows: HOMA-IR = Fasting Serum Glucose (mg/dL) \u00d7 Fasting Plasma insulin (\u03bcU/mL) / 405. Patients with one or more of the following conditions were excluded from the study: history of malignancy, diagnosis of type 1 diabetes or use of hypoglycemic drugs, uncontrolled hypertension (N145/ 90 mmHg); renal insufficiency defined as glomerular filtration rate b 40 mL/min (derived with the Modified Diet in Renal Disease equation); unstable cardiac syndromes. Data from atherosclerotic patients within the placebo group were re-analyzed. Fourteen age-and racematched healthy volunteers without cardiovascular disease as defined above were served as controls.",

While the role of global DPP4 in diabetes and cardiovascular disease has been well studied, the function of immune cell-derived DPP4 in cardiometabolic disease remains elucidated. To determine the role of immune cell-expressing DPP4 in cardiovascular disease, we first examined the expression of DPP4 on circulating immune cells using Flowsight\u00ae imaging flow cytometry. Results indicate that monocytes and T cells are the major populations expressing DPP4 in the human peripheral blood, while the majority of granulocytes and B cells did not express DPP4 (Fig. 1a ). In addition to membrane-bound DPP4, DPP4 can also be cleaved from the cell membrane and present as a soluble form in the plasma [2] . We next detected the enzymatic activity of membrane-bound DPP4 on the white blood cells and soluble DPP4 in the plasma. As a result, leukocytes contributed considerably to the enzymatic activity of DPP4 in the circulation (Figs. 1b & 1c) . To examine if immune cells also contribute to the generation of soluble DPP4 in the plasma, DPP4 knockout mice were irradiated and transplanted with wild-type (WT) or DPP4 \u2212/\u2212 bone marrow. Plasma was isolated for the detection of DPP4 activity after 12 weeks. As depicted in Fig. 1d , mice with WT bone marrow showed a significantly higher level of plasma DPP4 activity compared to those with DPP4 \u2212/\u2212 bone marrow, suggesting that immune cells contribute to the generation of soluble DPP4. In addition, enzymatic inhibition of DPP4 inhibitor (DPP4i) for 4 weeks increased the expression of DPP4 on macrophages (Figs. 1e & 1f) , suggesting that there may be a negative feedback loop to control DPP4 expression and enzymatic activity.",

After 24-h treatment with 25 Fig. 2b ). Dose response experiments revealed that oxLDL dose-dependently enhanced DPP4 expression on macrophages (Supplemental Fig. 1 ). Similar findings were observed in peritoneal macrophages from C57BL/6 mice (Fig. 2c) . Furthermore, the upregulation of DPP4 following oxLDL treatment was accompanied by an increased expression of inflammatory cytokine IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 2d) . There was also a trend of increase in the expressions of NLRP3 and Caspase-1, two important components of NLRP3 inflammasome complex which is responsible for the maturation of IL-1\u03b2 (Fig. 2d) . To further confirm this result in humans, we prepared monocyte-derived macrophages (MDMs) from human peripheral blood monocytes and treated these cells with oxLDL. oxLDL increased DPP4 expression on human macrophages by nearly two fold (Fig. 2e) . We next examined if 27-hydroxycholesterol (27OH-Ch), an oxidized cholesterol and important component of oxLDL, could induce DPP4 upregulation. Interestingly, DPP4 was not significantly upregulated after 27OH-Ch treatment, suggesting that the upregulation of DPP4 may not be mediated by free form of oxidized cholesterol (Supplemental Fig. 2 ).",

In contrast, there was even a slight increase of DPP4 expression after oxLDL treatment in Myd88 \u2212/\u2212 BMMs (Figs. 4a-4d) . We then used Trif \u2212/\u2212 mice to examine the involvement of MyD88-independent pathways of TLR4 mediated DPP4 expression.

However, given the relative neutrality of recent trials with DPP4 catalytic inhibitors [21, 22] , the role of DPP4 has been questioned. One potential reason for the lack of efficacy in these studies may relate to a divergent role/ function of the catalytic versus non-catalytic function of DPP4 particularly in cell types such as monocytes and T cells. Thus our investigation was focused on the expression of membrane bound DPP4 in atherosclerosis. We have previously shown that DPP4 on macrophages and dendritic cells may enhance adipose tissue inflammation via non-catalytic pathways [8] . A recent study by Ghorpade et al. also reported that DPP4 acts with plasma factor Xa to inflame adipose tissue macrophage. Silencing expression of DPP4 in hepatocytes, but not enzymatic inhibition of DPP4 by sitagliptin, reduced adipose tissue inflammation and insulin resistance [23] . In the current study, we observed that catalytic inhibition of DPP4 increased the expression of DPP4 on macrophages. These results indicate that the compensatory upregulation of DPP4 by DPP4 catalytic inhibition may promote inflammation, which could be a possible explanation for the neutral effects of DPP4 inhibitors on cardiovascular outcome.",

            "text": "In a large cross-sectional study in China, plasma DPP4 activity was shown to correlate with carotid intima media thickness. DPP4 activity in this study associated positively with the degree of insulin resistance (HOMA-IR), oxidized LDL and other measures of oxidative stress including nitrotyrosine and 8-isoPGF2a [24] . Interestingly, our recent study indicates there is no correlation between plasma DPP4 activity and atherosclerosis, suggesting that catalytic activity of circulating/soluble DPP4 alone may not be sufficient to serve as a mediator of atherosclerosis [14] . Additionally, one could conclude that monocytes may not be an important source of circulating DPP4. Indeed, adipocytes, endothelial cells and bone marrow derived cells (other than monocytes) have been confirmed as important sources of circulating DPP4 [10, 25] . We have previously shown that monocyte DPP4 expression is positively associated with non-HDL cholesterol and triglycerides, but not with fasting blood glucose or insulin levels, suggesting that the increase of monocyte DPP4 in obese patients might be related to dysregulated lipid metabolism in insulin resistance [14] . Since both LDL and its oxidatively modified forms are highly prevalent in atherosclerosis and may link diabetes with accelerated atherosclerosis [18, [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] [32] , we examined the effect of both native LDL and oxLDL on DPP4 expression. Interestingly, only oxLDL, but not native LDL and free form of oxidized cholesterol (27OH-Ch), enhanced the expression of DPP4 on macrophages. In addition to DPP4 upregulation, IL-1\u03b2 expression was also upregulated following oxLDL treatment, accompanied by a trend of increase in inflammasome components NLRP3 and caspase-1. This result is consistent with previous reports [33, 34] . Recent studies have demonstrated that CD36 may coordinate with TLRs to enhance oxLDL-induced NLRP3 inflammasome activation and atherosclerosis [35] [36] [37] . However, the causal relationship between DPP4 upregulation and IL-1\u03b2 production was not examined in this study and requires further investigation. Activation of TLRs and downstream inflammatory signaling could be activated by excessive free fatty acids, very low density lipoprotein, apolipoprotein CIII, and lipoprotein oxidation [18, [38] [39] [40] [41] [42] [43] . In addition, the expression and activation of TLRs were also reported to increase in patients with metabolic syndrome [18, 38, [43] [44] [45] . In line with previous findings, we found that TLR4 knockdown or deficiency of downstream molecule TRIF abolished oxLDL-mediated up-regulation of DPP4 on macrophages. This suggests that oxLDL-induced TLR4/TRIF signaling may be responsible for elevated monocyte DPP4 in obesity. MyD88 and TRIF are the two major downstream adaptor proteins for TLRs. In the present study, we found TRIF rather than MyD88 is required for oxLDL-induced DPP4 up-regulation. TRIF is responsible for mediating the activation of NF-\u03baB and IFN-\u03b2 production mediated by TLR3 and TLR4 [46, 47] . In our study, oxLDL-induced DPP4 upregulation was even slightly enhanced in MyD88 deficient macrophages. This could be a result of the compensatory enhancement of TRIF signaling in MyD88 knockout macrophages [48] . The role of TRIF signaling in Fig. 6 . CD36 is associated with DPP4 expression on macrophages. A&B, Peritoneal macrophages were co-stained with CD36 and DPP4 and then examined by imaging flow cytometry. CD36 + and CD36 \u2212 macrophages were gated for the analysis of DPP4 expression. Representative images (A) and histograms (B) showing the expression of DPP4 on CD36 + and CD36 \u2212 macrophages. C, Human MDMs were co-stained with CD36 and DPP4 and DPP4 expression on CD36 + or CD36 \u2212 MDMs are shown. atherosclerosis is complex. Depending on the cellular context and upstream pathways such as TLR4/3, TRIF could be proatherogenic or atheroprotective. Loss-of-function mutation of TRIF improved atherosclerosis in Ldlr \u2212/\u2212 mice, while TLR3 deficiency in Ldlr \u2212/\u2212 mice enhanced atherosclerosis development [49] . Since TRIF signaling is primarily induced by TLR3 and TLR4, these data suggest TLR4-mediated TRIF signaling promotes atherosclerosis, while the TLR3-dependent TRIF responses may be atheroprotective [49] . However, another study reported TLR3 and TLR4 signaling in bone marrow cells had proatherogenic effects in Ldlr \u2212/\u2212 mice [50] . Studies by Ohnuma suggest that DPP4 may induce NF\u03baB activation and monocyte maturation by interacting with caveolin-1 [4, 51, 52] . Therefore, up-regulation of DPP4 by oxLDL-induced innate signaling may in turn activate inflammatory signaling, resulting in a feed-forward loop. Stewart et al. previously reported that TLRs cooperate with CD36 to mediate oxLDL-induced inflammatory response [18] . CD36 is wellknown as a scavenger receptor responsible for oxLDL uptake and foam cell formation [53, 54] . We found in this study that CD36 is also involved in oxLDL-induced DPP4 up-regulation. Almost all DPP4 + cells also expressed CD36. Treatment of oxLDL increased the expression of CD36, which is consistent with previously reported findings [55] . In addition, deficiency of CD36 at least partially abolished oxLDL-induced DPP4 up-regulation. These findings suggest an important role for CD36 in oxLDL-induced DPP4 up-regulation.",

            "text": "We acknowledge a number of important limitations in this study. Importantly, we have not demonstrated a link between mediators of triglycerides such as post-prandial remnants. Remnant lipoproteins are markedly increased in diabetic dyslipidemia and may represent a fraction that could potentially participate in linking disordered lipid metabolism in the post-prandial state with abnormalities in glucose metabolism. In addition, we acknowledged that the DPP4 expression in human monocytes was not examined in a large sample of patients. However, one critical finding in our human study that DPP4 is increased in obesity and atherosclerosis is supported by other reports with a larger population size [9, 24] . We have also not provided additional mechanisms that link changes in TLR4 expression with downstream activation of TRIF and further kinase pathways that may function upstream of DPP4. In conclusion we demonstrate a role for oxidized lipids mediated up-regulation of DPP4 in atherosclerosis via TLR4/TRIF and CD36 dependent pathways. Our data provides a link between disordered lipid metabolism in atherosclerosis and impaired glucose intolerance through upregulation of DPP4.",
