From the 1950s to 1960s, TB, bacterial pneumonia, and lung abscess were the most prevalent lung infections, which shifted to hospitalacquired pneumonia (HAP) and community-acquired pneumonia (CAP) in the 1980s. The isolation of antimicrobial resistant strains in CAP [29] [30] [31] and HAP 32 has raised concerns for the misuse of antibiotics. Chinese guidelines on HAP and CAP have been developed. 33, 34 The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 triggered extensive research 35 and led to the establishment of an effective system in controlling the emerging respiratory viral diseases. [36] [37] [38] [39] Corticosteroids were effective to reduce fatality and hospital stay in critically ill patients with SARS, 40 and a vaccine has been developed for its prevention. 41 With the experience of dealing with SARS, the Chinese medical community and public health system responded quickly to the later epidemic of avian have been established.

The group conducted a series of multicenter studies on PTE, 62-64 which effectively increased awareness and improved diagnosis and management of PTE, leading to a decrease in PTE fatalities in China. 65 Genetic polymorphisms associated with PTE among the Chinese were characterized, and several genetic traits in fibrinogen b 66 and plasminogen activator inhibitor-1 67 were linked to an increased risk of PTE in the Chinese population. However, the low incidences of factor V Leiden, prothrombin gene G20210A, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase gene C677T muta tion suggest that they are not the major genetic risk factors for PTE in the Chinese population. [68] [69] [70] Great efforts have been made to fi nd the optimal regimens for treating PTE. Wang et al 71 demonstrated that a short regimen of 2-h urokinase IV showed similar effi cacy and safety as standard 12-h urokinase IV in treating acute pulmonary embolism. The new regimen signifi cantly reduces the cost of the treatment. In another multicenter trial, the same group reported a similar effi cacy, but better safety, when the dosing infl uenza in 2009. 42, 43 The clinical features, such as incu bation period and common symptoms, were reported. 44 The effi cacy and safety of oseltamivir and maxingshigan-yinqiaosan, a formula of traditional Chinese medicine, in treating 2009 infl uenza A(H1N1 ) were tested. 45 Studies on the effectiveness of traditional Chinese drugs are especially important, because these drugs are widely accepted by Chinese people, and some of them have been applied for thousands of years. The rapid and successful control of the A(H1N1) pandemic in China was highly praised. 46 After the SARS epidemic was brought under control, the Chinese government implemented a series of measures to strengthen its public health system. This was reinforced by the efforts in TB control. 47 With increased inputs on TB control, China achieved its major goals in the fi ght against TB from 2001 to 2010. 48 However, TB control in China will remain a long-term public health challenge because of the high rates of multidrug resistance and the emerging TB and HIV coinfection. In the foreseeable future, advances in DNA sequencing and genomic technology will allow the rapid identifi cation of new pathogens and facilitate studies on the gene-gene and gene-environment interactions under specifi c disease conditions and studies on the interactions of the lung microbiome with microbial populations located in other organs/systems.",

The Chinese Thoracic Society developed guidelines with recommendations for mechanical ventilation in 2007 76 and for noninvasive positive pressure ventilation (NIPPV) in 2009. 77 In 2005, the concept of a pulmonary infection control (PIC) window was proposed to facilitate transition from invasive to noninvasive ventilation during COPD exacerbation. 78 The PIC window denotes that, in the management of ventilator support in patients with COPD with acute respiratory failure triggered by pulmonary infection, early extubation followed by noninvasive mechanical ventilation during the time of the PIC window will signifi cantly reduce the risk of ventilatoracquired pneumonia and improve the prognosis. The PIC window was subsequently proven useful in replacing intubation with sequential noninvasive ventilation in a nationwide multicenter prospective randomized controlled trial. 78 Another multicenter randomized controlled trial showed that early use of NIPPV in acute exacerbation of COPD could alleviate respiratory muscle fatigue and prevent worsening of respiratory failure. 79 Application of NIPPV was also shown to be benefi cial in severe hypercapnic encephalopathy 80 and for acute lung injury. 81 A multicenter, randomized, controlled clinical trial with a larger sample size is being conducted in China to assess the benefi t of NIPPV use in patients with acute lung injury.",
