Using immunohistochemical staining of FFPE tissue, we identified subgroups of cervical cancer patients where IFITM1/3 protein expression is inversely related to metastasis. Guide RNA-CAS9 methods were used to develop an isogenic IFITM1/IFITM3 double null cervical cancer model in order to define dominant pathways triggered by presence or absence of IFITM1/3 signalling. A pulse SILAC methodology identified IRF1, HLA-B, and ISG15 as the most dominating IFN\u03b3 inducible proteins whose synthesis was attenuated in the IFITM1/IFITM3 double-null cells. Conversely, SWATH-IP mass spectrometry of ectopically expressed SBP-tagged IFITM1 identified ISG15 and HLA-B as dominant co-associated proteins. ISG15ylation was attenuated in IFN\u03b3 treated IFITM1/IFITM3 double-null cells. Proximity ligation assays indicated that HLA-B can interact with IFITM1/3 proteins in parental SiHa cells. Cell surface expression of HLA-B was attenuated in IFN\u03b3 treated IFITM1/IFITM3 double-null cells. SWATH-MS proteomic screens in cells treated with IFITM1-targeted siRNA cells resulted in the attenuation of an interferon regulated protein subpopulation including MHC Class I molecules as well as IFITM3, STAT1, B2M, and ISG15. These data have implications for the function of IFITM1/3 in mediating IFN\u03b3 stimulated protein synthesis including ISG15ylation and MHC Class I production in cancer cells. The data together suggest that pro-metastatic growth associated with IFITM1/3 negative cervical cancers relates to attenuated expression of MHC Class I molecules that would support tumor immune escape.",

Many biological functions have been described for the interferon pathway. Among them, the best characterized are anti-tumor activity, immunomodulatory effects, antipathogen, and anti-viral activity [2] . IFN effects rely on three different types of receptors: Type I (IFN\u03b1, IFN\u03b2 and IFN\u03c9), Type II (IFN\u03b3) and Type III (IFN\u03bb) [3, 4] . IFNs increase in response to a broad range of factors such as persistent viral infection or DNA damaging agents which activate the JAK kinase-STAT pathway. Ultimately, this signalling cascade will regulate the transcriptional synthesis of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) [5, 6] .",

By contrast, it has been demonstrated that sustained low level of IFN causes a steady-state expression of the interferon resistance DNA damage signature (IRDS) which is comprised of a subset of interferon-stimulated genes [7] .

It is a membrane protein that plays a key role in restriction of anti-viral immune response and belongs to the interferon induced transmembrane family (IFITM) [17] . IFITM1 is coded by the IFITM1 gene located on chromosome 11p15.5 and flanked by IFITM2 and IFITM3 genes. The IFITM immunity-related protein family are composed of short amino-terminal and carboxy-terminal domains, two transmembrane domains, and a cytoplasmic domain. IFITM1 is slightly different from IFITM2 and IFITM3, with some studies demonstrating that IFITM1 is uniquely expressed at the cell surface [18, 19] .",

They suppress the entry of viruses such as influenza A virus (IAV), West Nile virus, dengue virus, SARS coronavirus, filoviruses, VSV, and HCV among others [20] . IFITM family proteins inhibit cytosolic entry of viruses by preventing fusion of viral and host membranes. The protein-protein interaction networks by which IFITM proteins inhibit viral propagation are just emerging. One study using yeast two-hybrid methodology has identified an interaction of IFITM3, IFITM2, and IFITM1 with VAPA that in turn mediates an accumulation of cholesterol in multivesicular structures [21] . This reduces the fusion of intraluminal virion-containing vesicles with endosomal membranes and thereby inhibits virus release into the cytosol. In addition, different family members exhibit specific viral preferences. In the case of IFITM1, it is more active in controlling filoviruses, Influenza A, and SARS [17, 20, 22] . In this report, we focus on applying methodologies in interactomics, gene editing, SWATH-immunoprecipitation mass spectrometry, and pulse-SILAC mass spectrometry to propose an IFN\u03b3 responsive biochemical function for the IFITM1/3 proteins.",

The column was hydrated in 0.1% FA for 15 min following centrifugation at 1800 rpm at room temperature for 3 min. The sample was loaded into the column and centrifuged at 2300 rpm for 3 min. After washing the column three times with 0.1% FA, the peptides were eluted in three consecutive centrifugations at 2300 rpm for 3 min using 50%-80% and 100% AcN with 0.1% FA. Subsequently, peptide eluates were evaporated and dissolved in 5% AcN with 0.05% FA.",

            "text": "There were three distinct mass spectrometric screens used in the manuscript. The rationale for replicates in each distinct approach is as follows; (i) the SWATH-IP (immunoprecipitation) to identify IFITM1enriched associated proteins (Fig. 8) . The immunoprecipitation and immunoblots of SBP-IFITM1 vs SBP control is representative of experiments performed at least three times. The representative enrichment of IFITM1-associated proteins (in Fig. 8 from Supplementary Table 2 ) was processed by label free (SWATH) mass-spectrometry in technical triplicates. The measured fold-changes and p-values for quantified proteins are listed in Supplementary Table 2 and Fig. 8 ; (ii) the siRNA SWATH-MS ( Fig. 9A and B). Targeted siRNA to deplete IFITM1 in SiHa cells was performed in at least three separate experiments. A representative depletion of IFITM1 protein (Fig. 9A ) was performed in technical triplicates using two different biological states (48 and 72 h). The statistical rationale for performing two biological states (equivalent plating of cell number and differing by time of interferon exposure) rather than two biological replicates at the same time point, was due to the variable induction and suppression of the interferon cascade over this time frame. Thus, any proteins that are observed in two biological states as a function of time are thought to have higher significance than an analysis performed in duplicates at one time point. The samples in the two biological states were processed in technical triplicate for label-free (SWATH) analysis ( Fig. 8 ; Supplementary Table 2 ); (iii) Pulse SILAC to measure protein synthesis as a function of genotype. Twelve enzymatically digested samples (four samples of parental SiHa, four samples of IFITM1 null, and four samples of IFITM1/IFITM3 double null), each of them as independent biological triplicates, were processed using isotopically labeled amino acids and were separated using LC-MS/MS analysis ( Table 1 ). The statistical rationale for using three biological replicates with one injection per replicate, rather three technical replicates from one biological sample, relates to the dynamics and variability in the interferon dynamics. By using biological triplicates, any common overlaps are deemed to be more significant because of the possible variability in the cell plating and interferon cascade. Peptides were loaded on a pre-column (\u03bc-precolumn, 30 mm i.d., 5 mm length, C18 PepMap 100, 5 \u03bcm particle size, 100 \u00c5 pore size) and further separated on an Acclaim PepMap RSLC column (75 mm i.d., length 500 mm, C18, particle size 2 mm, pore size 100 \u00c5) with a 300 nl/min flow rate using a linear gradient: 2% B over 4 min, 2-40% B over 64 min, 40-98% B over 2 min, with A = 0.1% aq. formic acid and B = 80% AcN in 0.08% aq. formic acid. Peptides eluting from the column were introduced into an Orbitrap Elite (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Massachusetts, USA) operating in Top20 data dependent acquisition mode. A survey scan of 400-2000 m/z was performed in the Orbitrap at 120000 resolution with an AGC target of 1 \u00d7 106 and 200 ms injection time followed by twenty data-dependent MS2 scans performed in the LTQ linear ion trap with 1 microscan, 10 ms injection time and 10,000 AGC.",

Subsequently, their corresponding MS/MS spectra were measured. Precursor exclusion time was set to 12 s. Precursor ions with intensity below 50cps were suspended from the IDA experiment. The extraction of mass spectra from chromatograms, their annotation and deconvolution were performed using Protein Pilot 4.5 (SCIEX, Toronto, Canada). MS and MS/MS data were searched using the Uniprot+swissprot database (02. 2016, 69,987 entries) restricted to Homo sapiens taxonomy. Fixed modificationalkylation on cysteine using iodoacetamide and digestion using trypsin was set for all searches. FDR analysis was performed by searching the shotgun data against the decoy search database. The resulting group file was imported into Peakview 1.2.0.3 (SCIEX, Toronto, Canada), where only proteins with FDR below 1% were imported into the spectral library (465 proteins for SBP-IFITM1 pull down SWATH). In SWATH mode, the mass spectrometer operated in high sensitivity positive mode. Precursor range was set from m/z 400 up to m/z 1200. It was divided into 67 precursor ion windows with the width of 12 Da and 1 Da overlap. Accumulation time was 50 ms per SWATH window and the duty cycle was 3.0 s, which enabled acquisition of at least 10 data points across a chromatographic peak. Product ions were scanned from m/z 400 up to m/z 1600. Data extraction was performed in Peakview 1.2.0.3 (SCIEX, Toronto, Canada) with the spectral library. The retention time window for extraction was manually set to 4 min for SBP-IFITM1 pull down SWATH and for the siRNA SWATH ( Fig. 9 ). Protein quantification was performed using up to 4 peptides and 6 transitions per protein to define the statistically significant proteins. Scope of peptides used for quantification was narrowed to only those with peptide confidence higher than 99% and without any variable modification. Protein summed peak areas were normalized using total area sums option in MarkerView 1.2.1.1 (SCIEX, Toronto, Canada). Samples were compared pairwise using paired t-test.

Attenuation of IFITM1 protein expression can inhibit growth, invasion, and/or migration of cancer cells [34] . Patient subgroups with clinically relevant expression data are not welldefined. We developed a panel of monoclonal antibodies to a N-terminal peptide with a high homology between IFITM1 and IFITM3 (Supplementary Fig. 1A , B). This would allow the development of monoclonal antibodies that detect the co-expression of both IFITM1 and IFITM3 proteins. We aimed to use such tools to screen a large panel of human cancers for those that express IFITM1/3 proteins. This would identify clinically relevant models for a focus to dissect IFITM1/3mediated signalling pathways. The monoclonal antibody chosen (named Mab-MHK; Supplementary Fig. 1B) can bind to IFITM1/3 antigens in a range of human cancer cells ( Supplementary Fig. 1C ). Some cancer cells exhibit no expression of IFITM1/3 such as the lymphoma cell line WHU-NHL ( Supplementary Fig. 1C ). Further studies confirmed that Mab-MHK can bind to both IFITM1 and IFITM3 proteins, as defined using single IFITM1 single null and IFITM1/IFITM3 double null cells (see below).",

We could detect differential expression of IFITM1/3 in breast cancer, colon cancer, and oesophagus cancer (data not shown). We could also detect differential expression of IFITM1/3 protein in a cervical cancer array ( Fig. 1A-F) . Squamous cervical cancer samples expressed either high levels of IFITM1/3 (Fig. 1A) , lower levels of IFITM1/3 (Fig. 1B) , or undetectable levels of the antigens (Fig. 1C ). Cervical adenocarcinoma often exhibited high expression (Fig. 1D) . Interestingly, some normal squamous cervical epithelium exhibited high expression in the basal 'stem' cell or pluripotent layer only (Fig. 1E ), but not the differentiating cell layers. We can conclude that 64 out of 74 cervical cancer specimens are positive for IFITM1/3 proteins using the Mab-MHK (Fig. 1F, top  panel) .

We first generated an isogenic IFITM1 null cell panel through gene editing to validate the guide RNA. IFITM1 knockout mice are viable [40] so it was likely we would be able to generate IFITM1 null cells. Guide RNAs targeting exon 1 in the IFITM1 gene ( Figure 2A) were cloned into pLentiV2. Cells were transfected and selected for resistance to puromycin to allow stable integration of the IFITM1 targeting guide RNA cassette. Cell clones were chosen for sequencing across the guide RNA targeting site ( Fig. 2A) using PCR (Fig. 2B ). Both IFITM1 alleles were gene edited in a representative IFITM1-null clone that creates two distinct frameshifts ( Fig. 2C and D) . We examined four representative IFITM1 null cells in DNA damage response assays and all lines were shown to be either chemosensitive or X-irradiation sensitive (data not shown). Since all single knock-out clones behaved similarly, we chose one representative IFITM1 null cell line for continued study. The IFITM3 gene was next targeted using guide RNA methodologies (Fig. 3A) to to create a IFITM1/IFITM3 double null cell ( Fig. 3A-C) . IFITM3 null mice, and mice with the entire IFITM chromosomal locus deleted, are also viable [40, 41] . This created an isogenic cell model that removed any redundancy of IFITM3 in the IFITM1 interaction landscape, especially as they both are reported to interact with VAPA [21] . Immunoblotting confirmed that IFITM1 and IFITM3 proteins are not detected in the IFITM1/IFITM3 double null cell, respectively ( Fig. 3D ; lanes 5 and 6). We chose a representative doublenull cell line for subsequent studies.",

The parental SiHa, IFITM1 single null, and IFITM1/IFITM3 double null cells were treated with heavy isotopic amino acid labeling media (the SILAC method) for 6 or 24 h, in the absence or presence of IFN\u03b3 (Fig. 4) . Cell lysates were then processed by FASP [30, 31] and then analyzed for IFITM1/3-dependent protein synthesis using mass spectrometry. The SILAC methodology has been subjected to an analysis of random error associated with the multiple steps in this approach including; cell plating in biological replicates, switch to heavy isotopic media, cell recovery from plastic plates, cell lysis, centrifugation, filter assisted trypsinization, and tryptic peptide recovery and processing. This error can be reduced by employing multiple replicates (n = 3) as highlighted previously [42] . To highlight the importance of biological replicates and the inherent error in this multiple step process, we plot the data not as an average of three replicates, but as individual points from all three replicates (as in Supplementary Fig. 2 and Fig. 5) .",

This suggests that IRF1 is partially dependent upon IFITM1/3 signalling and this was confirmed using IRF1 transcriptional reporter assays (data not shown). This data provides some degree of confidence that the methodology is able to identify a known IFN\u03b3 responsive target (IRF1). There are other proteins whose synthesis was detected at 6 hours post-isotopic labelling including STAT1, EIF1, and B2M ( Supplementary Fig. 2I-K) . EIF1 is not known to be linked to interferon signalling, but it is known to regulate the accuracy of AUG codon selection by the scanning pre-initiation complexes [43] . EIF1 might prove to be involved in regulating interferon dependent anti-viral mRNA selection. Nevertheless, all three proteins are also IFTM1/3-independent ( Supplementary Fig. 2I-K) . STAT1 and B2M are also both known IFN\u03b3 responsive proteins further validating the methodology used to measure quantitative changes in protein synthesis. That all three proteins (STAT1, EIF1, and B2M) exhibit equivalent protein synthesis rates in the parental and double-null cell model indicates that the double null has retained many key regulatory features of the parental cell. This suggests that many IFN regulatory features of the double null cell have been retained despite the selection process creating the cell model.",

The synthesis of MHC Class I molecules was IFITM1/3-dependent (Fig. 5B vs 5F ; quantified in biological triplicates in Fig. 5L ). All three, major HLA alleles exhibited attenuated synthesis in the double null cell, as defined using the tryptic peptide coverage (Supplementary Fig. 3 ). Isotopically labeled ISG15 tryptic peptides are also not observed in the early interferon response ( Supplementary Fig. 2) , and the isotopically labeled ISG15 peptide recovery after 24 h is attenuated in the IFITM1/IFITM3 double null cells (quantified in biological triplicates in Fig. 5G ) suggesting that ISG15 protein synthesis is largely IFITM1/3 dependent. By contrast, STAT1 protein synthesis at 24 h appears largely IFITM1/3-independent (quantified in biological triplicates in Fig. 5I ). Providing another internal control, another well-known inducible IFN\u03b3 protein, B2M, exhibits equivalent synthesis in the IFITM1/IFITM3 double null cell (quantified in biological triplicates in Fig. 5K ).

            "text": "We next also examine whether there is any direct protein-protein interaction between IFITM1 and HLA-B since they are both co-synthesized, have transmembrane localizations on the cell surface, and are both IRDS components. In vivo proximity ligation assays are emerging methodologies that have been shown to demonstrate the \"association\" of two endogenously expressed proteins in fixed cells without the need for harsh lysis [44] . The method can be considered as an in situ mimic of an \"immunoprecipitation assay\". Proximity ligation assays can identify a protein-protein interaction/association with a distance of 10-30 nm that is in the upper range of that observed using FRET (5-20 nm) and this methodology can detect authentic endogenous proteins in situ that does not rely on transfected or artificially GFPtagged protein vectors [45] . We evaluated whether IFITM1/3 and HLA-B co-associate using this methodology using antibodies to HLA-B and Mab-MHK (that can bind to both IFITM1 and IFITM3 proteins; Supplementary Fig. 1) . A significant protein-protein interaction was observed in the IFN\u03b3 treated cells (representative images; Fig. 7A-D) . These foci were absent in the IFITM1/IFITM3 double null cells (Fig. 7E-H) . Together, these data validate the pulse-SILAC data that identified HLA-B as a downstream effector of IFITM1/3. ISG15 was not easily visualized using immunofluorescence in situ Table 1 ). Cells were incubated with IFN-\u03b3 for 24 h in B, D and F. Data were plotted as a function of log10 fold change of heavy/light peptide intensities. Triplicates were represented in the x, y, and z-axis. In samples (G-L), representative peptides used for quantification in biological triplicates are highlighted to demonstrate a protein that is induced independent of IFITM1/IFITM3 (STAT1, I and EIF1, J) and proteins that are IFITM1/3 dependent (ISG15; G, HLA-B, L). (data not shown) nor could we identify a protein-protein association between IFITM1/3 proteins and ISG15 using proximity ligations (data not shown). We thus used an independent assay for orthogonal validation of ISG15 induction. We developed a SBP-tagged IFITM1 expression construct in order to ectopically express the protein in the parental SiHa cells and design methodologies for capturing IFITM1 associated proteins. The transfection of the SBP-IFITM1 expression could be detected as migrating at a higher mass (due to the SBP tag) than endogenous IFITM1/3 proteins in the parental SiHa cells (Fig. 8A , lane 3 vs lane 1) and specifically captured after affinity purification following expression in the IFITM1/IFITM3 double null cell (Fig. 8A Table 2 ). The data first highlight the detection of peptides belonging to a homologous sequence for IFITM1/2/3 proteins (Fig. 8B,  Fig. 8C ). Since IFITM1 was our bait protein we presume that it was the detected isoform, serving as an internal positive control (Fig. 8A) . Nevertheless, IFITM1 may also be interacting with IFITM2 or IFITM3. The previously identified IFITM1/2/3 interacting protein VAPA was also detected (Fig. 8B and C) , Supplementary Table 2. The proteins with the most significant p-values were enriched in IFN-\u03b3 treated cells, relative to non-treated cells ( Fig. 8B and C, Supplementary Table 2 ). These included several proteins involved in cell-cell or cell matrix interactions including cornifin, galectin-7, desmocolin, JUP, hornerin, and desmoglein ( Fig. 8C; Supplementary Table 3 ). This is suggestive of a pathway interaction of IFITM1 with membrane-dependent cell-cell communications. The enrichment of higher confident targets in IFN-\u03b3 treated cells also suggests that IFN-\u03b3 treatment may be required to fully 'activate' the IFITM1 protein interaction landscape. Interestingly, proteins related to IFN\u03b3 signalling were also detected; ISG15 and HLA-B ( Fig. 8B and C) . Immunoblotting also confirmed that ISG15ylation was For quantitation, three independent assays were performed, and each assay had two independent biological replicates. For each assay, fluorescence was measured in at least 50 cells per condition. Fluorescence was measured using ImageJ software. Statistical study was performed with 1-way Anova and Bonferroni correction (p-value < .0001). (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) attenuated in IFITM1/IFITM3 double null cells after IFN\u03b3 stimulation (Fig. 8D) . By contrast free ISG15 protein remained equivalent in both cells (Fig. 8D) , suggesting that the ISG15 synthesis detected using pulse SILAC is directly linked to IFN stimulated protein conjugation. The ratio changes of conjugated to free ISG15 is summarized in Fig. 8E . Together, the orthogonal validation of HLA-B and ISG15 is consistent with the pulse SILAC data; IFITM1/3 proteins are required for maximal induction of HLA-B and ISG15ylation in IFN\u03b3 treated cells.",

As such, we took an independent approach to define dominating IFITM1-dependent signalling pathways and whether these overlap with the signalling proteins identified using the pulse-SILAC experimental methods. Although the majority of analyses identified HLA-B and ISG15 protein expression changes using IFITM1/IFITM3 double null cells, we did create an IFITM1 single null cell that revealed similar reductions in ISG15 and HLA-B after IFN\u03b3 treatment (Fig. 5D, G, and L) . As such, we examined IFITM1 dependence in the steady-state proteome levels using IFITM1 targeted siRNA treatment of parental SiHa cells (Fig. 9A, lanes 4  and 2 vs 3 and 1) to determine if attenuation of IFITM1 by this method gave rise to similar proteome changes. However, there is a caveat to this method. Similar to plasmid transfection [46] , double stranded RNA can also induce an IRF-1 dependent transcriptional interferon response [47] . Accordingly, we have also found that siRNA transfection methodologies can induce an IRF1 transcriptional response (data not shown). Nevertheless, siRNA is a powerful tool to determine gene dependencies in cell models. When parental SiHa cells, treated from 48 and 72 h with control siRNA or IFITM1-targeted siRNA, there was Table with selected binding proteins detected by mass  spectrometry for SBP-IFITM1 enrichment without or with IFN-\u03b3 stimulation (from Supplementary Table 3 ). (D). Cells (parental SiHa; lane 1; or IFITM1/IFITM3 double null (lane 2) were transfected with empty vector (as in 8A) and treated with IFN\u03b3. Samples were processed by immunoblotting with antibodies to ISG15. Free, monomeric ISG15 protein is highlighted, as well as conjugated ISG15. Free ISG15 protein is expressed at similar levels in both cells whilst conjugated ISG15 is attenuated in the IFITM1/IFITM3 double null cell (lane 2 vs 1). This suggests that ISG15ylation protein synthesis is linked to covalent conjugation under these conditions, under conditions where attenuated ISG15 protein synthesis was observed using pulse SILAC (Fig. 5 ). Antibodies to \u03b2-actin and IFITM1/3 proteins were used as loading controls, as indicated. (E). Free and conjugated ISG15 were quantified using ImageJ software. The relative units (in A.U.) define expression as a function of free or conjugated ISG15 in parental and IFITM1/IFITM3 double null cells. The relative change in ISG15 conjugation over free ISG15 was 5.58 A.U. in parental cells. The relative change in ISG15 conjugation over free ISG15 was 3.63 A.U. in IFITM1/3 double null cells.",

Some of these proteins, including IFITM1 itself, are also components of the interferon-stimulated DNA damage resistant signature of proteins [9, 10] . Interestingly, ISG15 and HLA-B are also lowered after the treatment of SiHa cells with IFITM1 targeted siRNA. However, there is one notable difference in the pulse-SILAC (Fig. 5 ) vs the siRNA methodology (Fig. 9B) ; STAT1 and B2M are IFITM1/3-independent as defined using pulse SILAC (Fig. 5) ; whilst STAT1 and B2M are IFITM1-dependent using the siRNA methodology Fig. 9 . The impact of IFITM1 targeted siRNA on the steady-state proteome. (A). Immunoblotting to demonstrate that IFITM1-targeted siRNA can attenuate IFITM1/3 protein levels. Cells were treated with the indicated control or targeted siRNA for two time points to capture the overlap in the transient dynamics of the interferon signalling cascade. Lysates were immunoblotted with the Mab-MHK antibody (the MHK monoclonal antibody cross reacts to a common N-terminal epitope in IFITM1 and IFITM3, see Supplementary Fig. 1 ) to quantify IFITM1/3 protein and the loading control (GAPDH), as highlighted. (B). Evaluation of the total steady-state proteome in response to siRNA targeting of IFITM1 in SiHa cells using SWATH-MS (data from Supplementary Table 3 ). The impact of IFITM1-targeted siRNA treatment for 48 and 72 h. These time points were a point of focus since the siRNA treatment activates the IRF1 transcriptional response over these two-time frames (data not shown). As such, the screen is conducted under experimental conditions in which we consider that the IRF1 response is activated by RNA treatment. The data from these two biological states are plotted as log2 fold change in protein levels (using SWATH-MS) as a function of either the 48 or 72-hour time point. The key proteins whose steady-state levels were suppressed after IFITM1-targeted siRNA treatment are highlighted in red, in the lower left quadrant. (C) The IFITM1 signalling model. Pulse labelling using SILAC methodologies identified STAT1 as a dominant protein synthesized after IFN\u03b3 treatment. This forms an internal positive control and is consistent with the classic JAK-STAT response to IFN\u03b3 treatment. (I). STAT1 can produce mRNAs that are translated in response to IFN\u03b3 treatment including IRF1 and other interferon effectors such as B2M. (II). By contrast to STAT1 and B2M, some of the IFN\u03b3 stimulated factors are IFITM1 dependent including MHC Class I molecules and ISG15 (Fig. 5G and L) . The siRNA-mediated depletion of IFITM1 represents an orthogonal assay that identified reductions in ISG15 and MHC Class I molecules (Fig. 9A) . STAT1 protein reflects a distinct mechanism of control by IFITM1/3. Although pulse SILAC revealed that STAT1 synthesis is IFITM1/3-independent (Fig. 5) , the steady state levels of STAT1 protein are reduced after targeted depletion of IFITM1 in SiHa cells (Fig. 9A) . These data suggest that turnover of STAT1 protein might be dependent on IFITM1/3, but its synthesis is independent of IFITM1/3. However, these methodologies are complicated to compare directly, since the siRNA methodology uses an intrinsic RNA signal (double stranded RNA) that stimulates IRF1 but without exogenously added IFN\u03b3, whilst the pulse SILAC used IFN\u03b3 without RNA ligands. Altogether, these data place IFITM1/3 proteins as a coordinator of the synthesis and/or steady state levels of a subset of key players in the IFN\u03b3 response. The notable induction of MHC Class I molecules and ISG15 in an IFITM1/3 dependent manner identifies a coordinated signalling pathway with potential clinical relevance (Fig. 1) . The recent observation that lowered HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C alleles correlates with poor prognosis and enhanced metastatic growth in cervical cancers [54] is further consistent with the existence of an IFITM1/3:HLA signalling pathway regulating cervical cancer outcomes. (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) (Fig. 9B, Supplementary Table 3 ). This might reflect that fact that the RNA ligand (siRNA) induces additional RNA-activated pathways in the targeted siRNA proteome screen than IFN\u03b3 alone.",

These data suggest that IFITM1 might alone function as an effector to these two proteins. However, we cannot rule out a role for IFITM3 in the IFITM1 single null cell, since IFITM3 is also reduced by IFITM1 targeted siRNA treatment of SiHa cells (Fig. 9B) .

The molecular functions of the IFITM family in the anti-viral response are just beginning to be defined. Yeast-two hybrid, with IFITM3 as a bait, was used as a methodology to discover new protein-protein interactions within the IFITM family that mediate viral restriction [21] ; a protein-protein interaction was identified for IFITM3 and the Vesicle-membrane-protein-associated protein A (VAPA). The VAPA interaction occurred with IFITM1, IFITM2, or IFITM3 and these three were not distinguished from each other in this assay. Nevertheless, the study focused on defining how VAPA interaction with IFITM3 results in reduction of VAPA binding to oxysterol-binding protein (OSBP), disrupting cholesterol homeostasis, and preventing viral maturation. As IFITM1 and IFITM2 are also reported to bind to VAPA, it is not yet clear whether they play minor and/ or redundant roles in controlling cholesterol-mediated viral maturation [21] . Interestingly, VAPA was also identified in our SWATH-IP using SBP-tagged IFITM1 (Fig. 8) , which is consistent with VAPA being a dominant interactor for the IFITM family. In addition to VAPA, palmitoylation of IFITM1/2/3 family members has been reported to be required for some anti-viral functions [48] . Whether the anti-viral associations with VAPA or palmitoylation by the IFITM family impact on cancer growth control is not yet known.",

It is not known if the anti-viral and prooncogenic functions of the IFITM family overlap. Within the IFITM1 family, IFTM1 is the most well documented to have pro-metastatic roles and it is the only IFITM family member with a partial residence in the plasma membrane [19] . IFITM1 is also the only IFITM family member that is a component of the Interferon-regulated DNA damage resistance (IRDS) pathway [10] . The IRDS contains a subset of approximately 30 interferon responsive genes that are up-regulated late in the viral response, upregulated during development of radiation resistance, and upregulated as a result of chronic exposure to lower levels of type I or type II interferons. IRDS pathway expression is mediated by 'unphosphorylated' STAT1 [49] and can be stimulated by IRF9 [50] . Interestingly, two IRDS genes (ISG15 and HLA-B) are induced after IFN\u03b3 exposure in a 'IFITM1-dependent' manner (Fig. 9C ). Our unpublished data also indicate that IFITM1 single null cells are X-ray sensitive or cisplatin-sensitive, consistent with the hypothesis that IFITM1 expression is linked to chemo or irradiation resistance. The mechanisms whereby IFITM1 itself regulates such chemoresistant or pro-metastatic cell signalling events have not been mechanistically defined.",

Of particular interest was the inverse correlation between IFITM1/3 protein expression and lymph node metastasis ( Fig. 1F) suggesting that loss of IFITM1/3 protein expression correlates with evasion of the immune system.

The methodologies that highlighted such classic pro-metastatic roles for IFITM1 include over-expression by ectopic transfection of plasmid encoded genes or attenuation of gene expression using targeted siRNA [14] . By such experimental approaches, IFITM1 does indeed promote cancer cell growth and/or 'cell invasion' (i.e. a model of metastatic growth) [16] . Consistent with this, using clinical material IFITM1 protein has often been shown in literature to be over-produced in cancers using immunohistochemistry and this often correlates with poor prognosis [12, 52] .",

IFITM1/3 negative cervical cancers might also be more pro-invasive due to immune escape. This is based on the data indicating that the most dominant proteins whose synthesis depends on IFITM1/3 using the pulse SILAC methodology are in fact HLA family members (Figs. 4 and 5). HLA family members are components of the IRDS, they play a role in anti-viral immunity through the presentation of viral peptides through the MHC Class I system, and HLA expression is linked to immune rejection of cancer cells [53] . This suggests that although IFITM1/3 might be pro-oncogenic under some conditions, IFITM1/3-HLA signalling would presumably function as a 'tumor suppressor' signal via engagement of CD8+ T-cells. Such IFITM1/3 and HLA positive cancers might not metastasize because they produce neoantigen presenting MHC Class I molecules that keep the primary tumor in a local chronic state of equilibrium with the immune system. IFITM1/3-negative cancers by contrast might be expected to produce lower amounts of MHC Class I molecules following IFN\u03b3 stimulation ( Fig. 9 ) resulting in lowered neoantigen expression, immune escape, and metastasis. Such hypotheses are consistent with two clinical observations in cervical cancers. First, an inverse correlation exists between IFITM1/3 expression and lymph-node positive cancers (Fig. 1) . Second, a recent study has highlighted that lowered MHC Class I expression also predicts poor prognosis in cervical cancers [54] . This data is also consistent with several studies that highlight elevated rates of metastatic cancer cell growth in vivo are inversely correlated to MHC Class I expression including deletion of the MHC Class I locus [53] .",

Expression was not observed even on one cell layer up from the basal layer. In squamous human skin, this basal layer is reflective of p63 (a squamous stem cell transcription factor) and phosphorylated p53 positive stem cell populations after UV irradiation [55] . Thus, this expression might reflect a role for IFITM1 in squamous stem cell pluripotency. We do not have very many samples reflecting a 'normal' human cervical epithelium, but the few cases we have exhibit very strong staining in the basal layer (data not shown). During the course of these studies the Human Protein Atlas has also populated their immunohistochemical library with expression patterns of IFITM1 protein in normal tissues. We can see in this library that IFITM1 protein is also confined to the \"basal stem cell\" layer in normal squamous oesophagus, cervix, and oral mucosa ( Supplementary Fig. 4) . Together, these data would suggest that IFITM1 might play a role in squamous stem cell physiology as its expression appears specifically confined to the basal layer and is not expressed in suprabasal normal squamous cells. As the 'normal' squamous cervical epithelium we have used is from patients undergoing screening for cervical cancer or dysplasia, we cannot rule out a role for HPV in this expression in normal cervical cells. However, as the oesophagus squamous epithelium also exhibits IFITM1 protein expression in the basal cells of normal squamous epithelium (Protein Atlas, Supplementary  Fig. 4) , and the normal oesophagus is not noted for HPV infection, we would suggest that the expression of IFITM1 protein in basal cells is not related to HPV status. The signalling pathways that might trigger basal IFITM1 protein expression in squamous stem cell populations are not precisely defined. However, at the mRNA level, differential expression patterns of ifitm1 gene expression were identified in the uteri of mice and there were correlations between the patterns of ifitm1 gene expression and Wnt/\u03b2-catenin expression [56] . These data might suggest a role for Wnt signalling as an upstream regulator of IFITM1 in stem cells.",

We do not have any data that defines the HPV status of the cervical cancers we have analyzed (Fig. 1) , as the main clinically approved assay for diagnostics is p16 positive cancer cells [58] . There is a close relation between persistent viral infection, development of cancer and failure in immune response. As an example, cervical as well as vulvar intraepithelial neoplasia are pre-cancerous conditions characterized by sustained HPV-16 infection. A clinical study shows favorable prognosis related to an increase in IFN\u03b3-producing CD8+ cytotoxic T following to robust cell response induced by vaccination [59] . Vaccination delivers a high dose of specific antigen against HPV-16 oncoproteins E6 and E7 and mediates MHC-binding peptide complex presentation [60] . A similar outcome was also observed after vaccination of a preclinical mouse model of HPV positive cervical cancer [61] . There is a significant correlation between MHC Class I (not found for MHC Class II) expression on malignant cells and T-cell infiltration (TIL) in human ovarian cancer [62] , being a positive prognostic factor.

At the outset, we relied less on the use of siRNA to deplete IFITM1 since this would only give a transient reduction in a target protein but also siRNA itself can induce an interferon response (data not shown; [46] ). This would have complicated our analysis of the interferon-responsive nature of any IFITM1 protein interactions we visualize and measure. Nevertheless, siRNA was used as a final orthogonal approach to define IFITM1 signalling events (Fig. 9A, B) . By contrast, the limitation of using gene knockout tools to reduce expression of a protein requires that loss of the protein is not a lethal event. In the case of IFITM1 and IFITM3 knock-out mice are reported as viable [41] , thus it was not unexpected that we were able to generate single IFITM1 null and double IFITM1/IFITM3 double null cell panels (Figs. 2 and 3) . However, we were unable to generate single IFITM3 null cells under experiments carried out in parallel to those reported in this manuscript (data not shown).",

We chose to use a pulse-SILAC approach to identify the isotopically labeled tryptic peptides with the most significant fold change after IFN\u03b3 treatment and which are altered in the double IFITM1/IFITM3 or IFITM1 single null cells. The most significantly suppressed proteins in the double IFITM1/IFITM3 or IFITM1 single null cells after IFN\u03b3 treatment were MHC Class I orthologues encoded by the HLA-A, HLA-B, and HLA-C genes (Fig. 5) . As rationalized above, the data suggested an inverse correlation between IFITM1/ 3 protein and HLA expression with metastatic growth in cervical cancer.",

The fact that ISG15 and HLA-B are enriched in the SBP-IFITM1 protein affinity purification after IFN\u03b3 treatment (Fig. 8) suggests a co-operative activity exists between the two proteins. Indeed, as HLA-B can interact in situ with IFITM1/3 after IFN\u03b3 treatment (Fig. 7) , and as ISG15 is a high-confident IFITM1-associated protein using SWATH-IP mass spectrometry (Fig. 8) , these data suggest that the two proteins are directly involved in the IFITM1/3 dependent IFN\u03b3 response. ISG15 is also a component of an interferon and immune responsive gene cluster that are suppressed by stem cell pluripotent gene product expression [63] , suggesting that, like HLA suppression, ISG15 suppression might be co-incident with immune escape. In the case of IFITM1/3 signalling, we do not see defects in 'free' monomeric ISG15 in the double IFITM1/IFITM3 null cells, but reductions in the conjugation of higher molecular mass ISG15ylated adducts (Fig. 8D) . These data suggest that conjugation of proteins to ISG15 during interferon stimulation might play a coordinated role in the IFITM1/3 dependent immune-tumor cell interactions. Overproduction of ISG15 has been reported previously to stabilize IFITM3 [64] , consistent with our data that ISG15 is detected in the SBP-IFITM1 complex (Fig. 8) . Ubiquitination of IFITM3 might counteract the stimulatory effect of ISG15 on the anti-viral functions of the protein [65] . How ubiquitination and ISG15ylation regulate IFITM1 and/or IFITM3 in a coordinated fashion is not defined.",

Both antigen presentation and ISG15ylation signalling events are important for anti-viral signalling as well as immune regulation of cancer cells at the immune-cancer synapse [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] .
