Here we show that RNA spreads further in honey bees, and is horizontally transferred between individuals and across generations. We found that honey bees share biologically active RNA through secretion and ingestion of worker and royal jellies. Such RNA initiates RNA interference, which is a known defense mechanism against viral infection. Furthermore, we characterized diverse RNA profiles of worker and royal jelly, including fragmented viral RNA. Our findings demonstrate a transmissible RNA pathway with potential roles in social immunity and epigenetic signaling among members of the hive.",

Systemic RNAi, initiated by double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) ingestion, has been reported in diverse invertebrates, including honey bees, demonstrating environmental RNA uptake that undermines homologous gene expression. However, the question why any organism would take up RNA from the environment has remained largely unanswered. Here, we report on horizontal RNA flow among honey bees mediated by secretion and ingestion of worker and royal jelly diets. We show that ingested dsRNA spreads through the bee's hemolymph associated with a protein complex. The systemic dsRNA is secreted with the jelly and delivered to larvae via ingestion. Furthermore, we demonstrate that transmission of jelly-secreted dsRNA to larvae is biologically active and triggers gene knockdown that lasts into adulthood. Finally, RNA extracted from worker and royal jellies harbor differential naturally occurring RNA populations. Some of these RNAs corresponded to honey bee protein coding genes, transposable elements, non-coding RNA as well as bacteria, fungi and viruses. These results reveal an inherent property of honey bees to share RNA among individuals and generations. Thus, our findings suggest a transmissible RNA pathway, playing a role in social immunity and epigenetic signaling between honey bees and potentially among other closely interacting organisms.",

In essence, their finding represents a form of horizontal regulatory RNA transfer. To date, susceptibility to environmental RNAi has been established in fungus and animals from different phyla including Nematodes, Plathelminthes and Arthropods [reviewed in [9] ]. Environmental RNAi experiments mostly utilize bacterially expressed-or in vitro synthesized dsRNA through ingestion, suggesting that dietary consumption is an effective RNA uptake pathway. Further supporting this, potent RNAi transmission from transgenic dsRNA-expressing plants to invertebrate herbivores has been widely reported [10, 11] . Accordingly, host to-parasite RNAi transfer (commonly termed \"host-induced gene silencing\"; HIGS) has been applied to agriculture in recent years, demonstrating a potential practical strategy to control various pest and viral related diseases [12, 13] .",

Recently, transmission of parasitic nematode-derived miRNA to its mammalian host has been shown to compromise immunity of infected mice [14] . Similarly, pathogenic fungi exploit mobile small RNA signals to modulate via RNAi plant immune responses [15] . Reciprocally, arabidopsis plants secrete and transfer vesicles-containing small RNAs that could suppress virulence fungal genes [16] . Furthermore, ingestion of pollen-derived plant miRNA induces worker bee sterility in a sequence specific manner [17] . Interestingly, while the aforementioned examples provide evidence that some organisms acquire, and are affected by foreign regulatory RNA, it is still puzzling why would they allow it? This evolutionary maintained susceptibility to non-self regulatory RNA is intriguing in light of the fact that the most well-known transmissible RNA are viruses.",

This developmental flexibility of genetically identical individuals is driven by differential diet consumption.

Epigenetic regulation has been suggested to play a role in the honey bee's clonal phenotypic variation. Knockdown of DNA methyl-transferase 3 (dnmt3), a key enzyme in DNA methylation process, has a royal jelly-like effect, and semi-queen workers emerge with fully developed ovaries and a transcriptome profile similar to naturally reared queens [22] . Moreover, the methylation imprint varies between the brain's DNA of workers and queens, demonstrating unique epigenetic profiles among workers and queens [23] . Consistently, (E)-10-hydroxy-2-decenoic acid (10HDA), a fatty acid that comprises up to 5% of the royal jelly, has been characterized as a histone deacetylase inhibitor (HDACi) [24] . Nonetheless, although the general involvement of epigenetics has been established, it is still not clear how caste-specific DNA methylation marking is directed.",

Field trials, in which this environmental RNAi system was employed, indicated that the colony performance of virus-inoculated hives deteriorated following virus infection in control hives, whereas that of dsRNA-treated hives remained strong [26] . Interestingly, dsRNA-treated hives also produced more honey, when the main honey flow was 3-4 months after the last dsRNA treatment. By that time, most of the originally treated bees would have been replaced by new generations. Honey bee viruses can be transmitted among individuals in the hive both horizontally and vertically [27] . It was therefore expected that hives would become virus-affected once the new generation gradually replaced the previous, dsRNA-treated one. Potential persistence of disease protection raised the question whether treated honey bees may serve as vectors for RNA.",

To answer this question, we established a minimal hive system in plastic boxes containing ca. 150 workers and a comb with eggs and young larvae. The adult bees were fed for eight days on sucrose solution (untreated), sucrose solution mixed with dsRNA-GFP (non-specific dsRNA control) or dsRNA that matched the vitellogenin mRNA sequence (dsRNA-Vg). When the brood cells were sealed, the adult bees were removed and the combs were kept until new workers emerged. We then collected ten days old workers and analyzed the expression levels of vitellogenin by RT-qPCR. Consistent with persistence of jelly-transmitted dsRNA ( Figure 2B ) and in agreement with the aforementioned reports [29] [30] [31] , we observed vitellogenin knockdown in adult workers that were nourished as larvae by dsRNA-fed nurse bees ( Figure 2F ). Therefore, we concluded that transmissible RNA, at least in a dsRNA form, is biologically active in recipient bees.",

The cycle is engaged by consumption of RNA-containing diet by an individual bee.

A systemic RNA signal reaches the food secretion glands of nurse bees, and is transmitted to the progeny, again, through RNA-containing jelly consumption ( Figure 6 ).

However, the ability of bees to efficiently take up dietary small RNAs (e.g. miRNAs, siRNAs) is currently debatable [17, 30, 34, 35] . While exchange of dietary RNA among adult bees can reasonably occur via trophallaxis [36] , in our experiments, secretion of jelly that contained dsRNA-GFP required systemic distribution of the environmentally consumed dsRNA within the nurse bee. A few RNA uptake mechanisms have been reported including internalization by extracellular vesicles, dsRNA channels and receptor-mediated endocytosis [37] [38] [39] [40] . Although these mechanisms have demonstrated cellular RNA import, little is known about the systemic spread of RNA through the insect's circulatory system. Here we show that ingested-dsRNA is exported into the bee's hemolymph where at least part of it is not naked, but associated with proteins, forming extracellular ribonucleoprotein complexes. In agreement with previous studies, which determined import preference of long dsRNA [39] [40] [41] in c. elegans and drosophila, we found that the hemolymph dsRNA-protein complex is comprised of long and mostly non-processed dsRNA ( Figure 1B ). These findings led us to propose potential parallel complementary functions of the extracellular dsRNA-protein complex involving stabilization, translocation and introduction of the circulatory RNAi signal to recipient cells and tissues in a specific and/or non-specific manner. Yet, investigating such potential roles would require the identification and characterization of the RNA binding hemolymph proteins in future studies.",

RNAi maintenance via dsRNA amplification, driven by the viral RdRp and/or endogenous expression [42] [43] [44] , can explain silencing persistence in an individual bee. Nevertheless, it is unlikely to explain long-term protection at the colony level since the honey bee's life span during the summer is ca. six weeks. Worker larvae are fed exclusively royal jelly for three days, and then predominantly jelly, honey and pollen mix. Therefore, the presence of dsRNA-GFP in royal jelly demonstrated jelly-secretion mediated RNA transfer to next generations ( Figure 1C ). Further supporting such nurse to-larva transfer, dsRNA-GFP could be detected in larvae originated from untreated hives, but nourished by workers fed on dsRNA ( Figure 2D ). Reciprocally, dsRNA-GFP could not be detected in eggs laid by a dsRNA-treated queen in an untreated hive ( Figure 1C) . These experiments show that horizontal RNA transfer is the main route to share and spread RNA, at least in a dsRNA form, among the bee population in the hive. However, our results cannot rule out additional vertical transmission of RNA from queen to eggs. Ingestion of dsRNAsupplemented jelly under natural or in vitro conditions has been reported to confer efficient endogenous and exogenous gene silencing in honey bee larvae and newly emerged adults [17, [29] [30] [31] . Here, we show that dsRNA that is secreted into the jelly and consumed by larvae is also biologically potent and can induce a long lasting RNAi that persists until adulthood ( Figure 2B ). Therefore, an interpretation of our results leads us to conclude that RNA transfer to larvae could potentially prime anti-viral RNAi and explain the suspected long term protection against viral disease in infected hives fed on IAPV-dsRNA [26] .",

During infection, local RNAi develops into a systemic signal to control viral spread and propagation in distant cells and tissues. Our data indicates that systemic RNAi signal is not limited to the infected bee, but spreads beyond to other individuals in the hive. Diverse fragments of bacterial, fungal and viral RNA naturally occur in both jellies, representing 25% and 16.75% of total worker and royal jelly RNA, respectively ( Figure 3B , 5A). The presence of both sense and antisense viral sequences suggests secretion of viral RNA originated from cells. Additionally, potential Dicer substrates seem to be common among natural viral jelly RNA ( Figure 5C, Supplementary Figure 3 ), supporting transfer of naturally occurring RNAi triggers to the larvae. Yet, the relative amount of viral RNA is somewhat low in jelly samples collected from healthy looking hives ( Figure 3B ). We previously demonstrated cross species bi-directional RNAi transfer between the honey bee and Varroa mite, which has been applied for Varroa control [13, 46] . Thus, in addition to individual-defense, transmissible RNA could elicit a colony-level protective outcome. Relative to other insects, the honey bee's genome encodes a reduced number and variety of immune gene families. It has been therefore suggested that the bees' behavioral group-defense provides a complementary level of immunity, compensating for the reduction of immune genes [47] . We hypothesize another form of collective defense; social immunity that is engendered through transfer of pathogen-related RNA among members in the hive.",

The presence of differential naturally occurring RNA among worker and royal jellies points towards a potential effect of transmissible RNA on genome function in recipient bees. Indeed, supplementing jelly with endogenous or exogenous miRNAs that are naturally enriched in worker jelly affected gene expression as well as developmental and morphological characters of newly emerged workers and queens [17, 30] . We speculate that bee to-larva RNA transfer could also play a role in epigenetic dynamics among honey bees. A general involvement of epigenetics in the phenotypic plasticity of female bees has been demonstrated [22] [23] [24] . Nonetheless, it is still not understood how castespecific epigenetic marking is directed. Continuous uptake of regulatory jelly RNA could contribute towards a specific gene-expression profile of a genome with a potential to differentiate into two castes; hence, shifting towards an emergence of worker or queen. Making of a queen is a multilevel process and presumably there are numerous factors interplaying one with the other. Further research should molecularly determine the impact of jelly RNA and its relation to other identified players, such as Royalactin [21] .",

Briefly, Illumina NEXTflex small RNA 5' and 3' adapter sequences were trimmed from paired-end fastq sample files, while retaining sequences that were at least 23 bp long. Due to the two colour method of sequencing and other technical sequencing considerations, reads that were shorter than the total number of sequencing cycles had a poly-A tail followed by a poly-G tail that were both trimmed. Then, the four random index bases were trimmed from both ends of the sequences. Next, 5' and 3' Illumina NEXTflex small RNA adapter sequences were trimmed anew and only sequences for which the length of both paired reads was at least 15bp long were retained. QC, performed with FastQC, revealed low quality bases at both ends of the reads. These low quality bases were trimmed using fastx_trimmer and an additional QC run indicated that all the samples are properly trimmed. Total number of reads that passed trimming and QC per library is summarized in Supplementary Table 1.

Common peak sizes are marked in black font, and differential sizes in red font. A) A working model for transmissible RNA pathway in honey bees. Bees are able to take up RNA from the environment through ingestion. The ingested RNA is taken up from the digestive system through the epithelial gut cells to the circulatory system, the hemolymph. In the hemolymph, ingested extracellular RNA is associated with a protein complex and systemically spread, including to the jelly producing hypopharyngeal and mandibular glands. Then, ingested and other RNAs are secreted in the royal and worker jellies. A new environmental RNA cycle is initiated through ingestion of jellycontaining RNA. A few potential RNA sources could participate in the transmissible RNA pathway including systemic antiviral RNAi and endogenous mobile RNA, jelly-.
