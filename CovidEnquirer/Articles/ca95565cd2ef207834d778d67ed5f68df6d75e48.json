Surveillance studies in the 1950s showed that the infection was present in as many as 84% of prostitutes and 5% of the general population in some large cities, and 2-3% of rural residents. 3, 4 Mao Zedong and his government prioritised health care, and the control of syphilis and other sexually transmitted diseases (STD) was one of their key aims. 4 In 1952, China developed an unprecedented and unique campaign to eliminate STD. The government instituted mass screening, provided free treatment to infected individuals, and closed brothels. 5, 6 This programme seemed to be highly eff ective, and studies by Chinese and international teams verifi ed the virtual eradication of STDs by the 1960s. [7] [8] [9] [10] However, long-term control of STD in China has proved elusive. Economic and social reforms designed to open China to the world have been successful, but also appear to have laid the foundation for the reemergence of STD. Increased personal wealth, greater geographical mobility, and more relaxed government control 11 set the stage for the spread of STD. The fi rst cases of syphilis in China after the death of Mao were reported in 1979. 12 These changes led to the establishment of the Chinese National Center for STD Control in 1986, followed by the launch of a national STD surveillance system by the Ministry of Health in 1987. The purpose of this report is to describe the growth and magnitude of the Chinese syphilis epidemic on the basis of Chinese governmental surveillance data.",

According to national guidelines, 13 primary syphilis was defi ned as a clinically compatible case characterised by one or more chancres and inguinal lymphadenopathy, and laboratory confi rmation of Treponema pallidum in clinical specimens by dark-fi eld microscopy or reactive non-treponemal rapid plasma reagin, or toluidine red unheated serum test and treponemal T pallidum haemagglutination, or particle agglutination assay for antibody to T pallidum; secondary syphilis was defi ned as a clinically compatible case characterised by maculopapular rash and, in many cases, lymphadenopathy, and laboratory test confi rmation as for primary syphilis; latent syphilis was defi ned as an asymptomatic case with a possible history of infection supported by two consecutive reactive non-treponemal tests (rapid plasma reagin), a reactive treponemal test (particle agglutination assay), and normal cerebrospinal fl uid; and tertiary syphilis was defi ned as a case with a history of primary, secondary, or latent syphilis with clinical manifestations involving the cardiovascular or central nervous system and laboratory confi rmation with reactive non-treponemal tests, or cerebrospinal fl uid abnormalities characterised by higher than normal amounts of white blood cells or protein. A case of congenital syphilis was defi ned as a neonate or child younger than 2 years aff ected by associated signs and symptoms such as rash, hepatosplenomegaly, and lymphadenopathy, with an infected mother, supported by detection of T pallidum in lesions by dark-fi eld microscopy or reactive serological test. 14 To increase the accuracy with which STD incidence could be assessed, a network of 16 sentinel surveillance sites was established in 1987 in areas with high rates of STD. This network was subsequently expanded in 1993 to 26 sites in various cities throughout China. A map of these sentinel sites is shown in fi gure 1. Each site has a designated organisational centre from either the dermatovenereology institute or Center for Disease Control hospital networks that coordinates mandated STD reporting from all STD service providers in their jurisdiction, which is in most places a city district or in some an entire city. These sites have strengthened manage ment, standardised diagnosis and treatment protocols, and established laboratory quality assurance measures, for STD surveillance. By comparing the number of STD diagnoses recorded in clinic and laboratory registries at sentinel sites with case reports in the surveillance system, twice-yearly quality control studies indicate that sentinel sites report all but less than 5% of newly diagnosed STD cases.",

STDs treated at hospitals, family planning centres, gynaecological clinics, pharmacies, and private practitioners go largely un reported, 25, 26 although these venues represent important access points for patients with STDs. A study in Shenzhen and Guangzhou 27 showed that 27% of patients with STDs sought initial care at a site other than a government dermatovenereology centre; in Chengdu 28 and Hangzhou, 29 18-40% of patients sought care from private doctors and pharmacists. In an internal, unpublished quality-control study done in 1999, STD surveillance offi cials found that in one province, more than 75% of STD cases were not reported. Private practitioners were the least reliable, reporting only 0\u00b72% of cases, followed by district-level hospitals (7\u00b79%), provincial-level hospitals (15\u00b74%), and city-level hospitals (35\u00b75%).",

Syphilis can have devastating health consequences, especially if untreated. 1 The increasing privatisation of health care in China has left many people without resources to seek care, particularly for problems like syphilis that on the surface appear to be self-limiting. In a 2004 survey, half the respondents from three provinces reported foregoing health care in the previous year because of its prohibitive cost. 30 This proportion is probably much higher in rural areas, as shown by results from one study done in a rural county outside Beijing where 80% of women with symptoms of STD did not seek health care because of its high cost and their own lack of knowledge about STD. 31 Obviously, any defects caused by congenital syphilis would be devastating. Additionally, syphilis can contribute to the spread of HIV infection by raising the viral burden in HIV-infected individuals 32 and by increasing susceptibility to infection. 33 Cotransmission of syphilis and HIV has been reported in Pune, India, 34 and syphilis infection in pregnant women might facilitate the vertical transmission of HIV. 35 Although the gravity of syphilis during pregnancy cannot be overstated, detection and treatment of the disease could be overshadowed by focus on the prevention of vertical HIV transmission. 36 The rapid spread of syphilis in China is probably attributable to a combination of biological and social forces. Grassly and co-workers 37 have argued that the Reported incidence of total syphilis from sentinel sites Reported incidence of total syphilis from nationwide STD surveillance system Incidence (per 100 000) extent of syphilis observed in a population most closely indicates the degree of herd immunity. In their analysis of changes in syphilis incidence in the USA over the past 50 years, they concluded that 10-year cycles of disease resurgence could result from depletion of individuals with immunity resulting from natural infection. 37 In view of the virtual absence of syphilis in China for 20 years, the general population of young, sexually active individuals would be completely susceptible to this infection. Social forces could be of even greater importance. Although prostitution in China has an extensive history, 38 strict governmental intervention restricted such practices for nearly 40 years. 6, 38 However, economic reforms (so obvious in China's growth and globalisation) have led to income gaps and a cultural climate that favours reemergence of sex work. 11 A substantial majority of men and a huge migrant population of male workers have created an increasing demand for sex work. 39 It is not a surprise that a high prevalence of syphilis in sex workers has been well documented. 16 Sexual practices are also changing. Young Chinese people are increasingly likely to experiment with sex at earlier ages and before marriage. 40 Additionally, reduced governmental emphasis on public-health services, increasing costs of individual health care, and reduced availability of health insurance 41 might have contributed to reduced recognition and treatment of syphilis.",

One key component of this intervention is aff ordable syphilis screening, the tool that proved so powerful in the earliest days of Mao's government. 6 The southern city of Shenzhen has pio neered free syphilis screening for all pregnant women, a programme that has been shown to be cost eff ective and sustainable. 42 Further eff orts should also be directed at groups in which high syphilis prevalence has been documented, such as men who have sex with men 43 and female sex workers. 44 Thousands of health centres in China already off er free voluntary counselling and testing for HIV, and additional testing for syphilis in these centres would expand coverage of syphilis screening and help to integrate STD and HIV prevention eff orts. However, these strategies will need much support from local and national leaders, as part of the overall urban and rural health reforms. 45 STD prevention programmes need to be scaled-up for a mass audience. Preliminary results from the 100% condom use programmes for sex workers promoted in Jiangsu, Hubei, Hunan, Guangxi, and Hainan provinces are favourable, with sharp drops in the prevalence of syphilis in female sex workers. 46 These targeted interventions have been complemented by mass education campaigns directed at younger people.",

Incidence of total syphilis cases reported by the enhanced surveillance network rose continuously from 1\u00b74 cases per 100 000 individuals in 1993 to 32\u00b79 per 100 000 in 1999 (fi gure 5).
