She is normally an active girl, with no smoking history, no second hand smoke exposure at home, and no history of illicit drug use. About 2 weeks prior to her presentation, she was seen by her primary care physician for an abscess on her thumb. She started a course of sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Shortly thereafter, she developed a fever, cough, and a diffuse rash. She stopped taking the sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim after 2 days due to decreased oral intake.",

She promptly stopped taking it due to profuse vomiting and an urticarial type rash. She then presented to an urgent care facility. Her work up included a rapid flu and strep both of which were negative. She was given a prescription for topical hydrocortisone and oral diphenhydramine. She started to improve so her mother re-started the original sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim. Shortly after re-starting the sulfamethoxazole/trimethoprim, she developed diffuse myalgias, dyspnea, and fever to 39.8 C. She then went to an emergency department. Work up included another rapid flu (negative), a rapid strep (negative), WBC 3 thousand/ mm 3 , and a chest roentgram (CXR) which was consistent with a \"viral process.\" She was discharged on oral prednisone 60 mg a day.

A peripherally inserted central catheter (PICC) line was placed in her left upper extremity. The following day a computerized tomography (CT) Scan of the chest with pulmonary embolism protocol revealed saddle thrombus located in the right pulmonary artery seen within the middle and lower lobe lobar, segmental, and subsegmental arteries with a probable tiny amount of thrombus within the left lower lobe segmental and subsegmental arteries, also noted to have ground glass appearance of the lower lobes bilaterally.

            "text": "The eosinophilic pneumonias encompass a wide variety of different interstitial lung disease, but all typically have eosinophilic infiltration of the lungs. 1 The exact role of the eosinophil is these disease processes are unknown, but may be related to tissue injury from inflammation and eosinophilic degranulation. 1 The eosinophilic pneumonias are generally placed into two large categories: Idiopathic and Secondary. 2 The idiopathic group contains eosinophilic granulomatosis with polyangiitis, idiopathic chronic eosinophilic pneumonia, and idiopathic acute eosinophilic pneumonia. 2 The secondary group includes parasites, drugs, toxins, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis and neoplasms. 2 Many drugs have an association with eosinophilic pneumonia, but not all have a proven causal relationship. 3 Some of the associated drugs include the following: Antibiotics (beta lactams, tetracycline, sulfonamides, nitrofurantoin, isoniazid, ethambutol, pentamadine), antiepileptics (carbamazapine, phenytoin), Illicit drugs (heroine, cocaine), non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (ibuprofen, naproxen, indomethacin, diclofenac, piroxicam), antidepressants (amitriptyline, trazodone, venlafaxine), chemotherapeutic agents (bleomycin, camptothecin), cardiovascular drugs (angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitors, amiodarone, B-blockers), biologics (infliximab, interferon alpha, granulocyte e macrophage colony stimulating factor), and nutraceuticals (L-Tryptophan). 3 Eosinophilic pneumonia is not common in the pediatric population. The mean age is typically in the late 20s. The exact incidence is unknown. There appears to be an association with HIV, smoking, and hypersensitivity to drugs or toxin exposure. Our patient seemed to have a causal relationship with Sulfamethoxazole/ trimethoprim. The presentation is typically rapid over the course of 1e5 days, and generally involves fever, myalgias, pleuritic chest pain, crackles on lung exam, plus or minus peripheral eosinophilia as was the case in our patient. A CXR typically shows non-specific findings but includes consolidation, hilar adenopathy, pleural effusions, and reticulonodular densities. 3 CT scans of the chest usually show ground glass opacities, nodules, or irregular lines. 3 The CT chest in our patient demonstrated a ground glass appearance as well as a pulmonary embolism. Bronchoalveolar lavage is the diagnostic study of choice to diagnose an eosinophilic lung disease as it may be the only clue revealing a high eosinophil count (typically >25% when the normal in BAL fluid is <1%). Our patient had a slight elevation in her BAL eosinophils likely due to the fact that she had been partially treated with corticosteroids prior to her hospital presentation. A recent search of the available literature has revealed only a few papers that describe an association with a pneumothorax related to an eosinophilic pneumonia (in the setting of a Paragonimiasis infection). 4 There have been very few reported cases of organizing eosinophilic pneumonia being associated with pulmonary embolism or a pneumomediastinum. Our patient's condition was associated with a pneumothorax, pneumopericardium, and pneumomediastinum. The exact etiology of the pulmonary embolism is unclear. Some possible etiologies could include the PICC line, an undiagnosed hypercoagulable disorder, or related to the inflammation of the eosinophilic disorder. Her hypercoagulable work up was negative but an undiagnosed mutation is always a possibility. Eosinophilic pneumonia has no obvious association with pulmonary embolism but still could be the possible etiology. The PICC line was present for less then 24 hours, but theoretically could have been the cause.",
