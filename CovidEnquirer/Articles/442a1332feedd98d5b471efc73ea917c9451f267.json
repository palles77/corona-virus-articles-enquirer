A new capillary electrophoretic method has been developed for the separation and quantification of glycyrrhizin, \u2424-glycyrrhetic acid and its isomer \u2423-glycyrrhetic acid. Separation of the analytes was achieved in less than 3 min on a fused silica capillary, by injecting the samples at the short end of the capillary (effective length: 8.5 cm). The background electrolyte was composed of pH 10.0 carbonate buffer, methanol and ethylene glycol (80/10/10) and contained 0.4% \u2424-cyclodextrin; indomethacin was used as the internal standard. Diode array detection was used, with quantitative assays carried out at 254 nm. Linearity was found over the 5-200 and 2.5-100 g mL \u22121 concentration ranges for glycyrrhizin and glycyrrhetic acid, respectively. This method has been applied to the determination of the analytes in different matrices (liquorice roots and commercial confectionery products), and to the purity control of \u2424-glycyrrhetic acid obtained from the hydrolysis of glycyrrhizin. When analysing \u2424-glycyrrhetic acid and its epimer in roots, the samples were purified by means of a suitable solid-phase extraction (SPE) procedure with Oasis HLB cartridges, which granted good selectivity, eliminating matrix interference.",

The best-known organoleptic property of G is its sweet taste; it is 170 times sweeter than sucrose [3] (\"Glycyrrhiza\" means \"sweet root\" in ancient Greek), and this explains the wide use of G as a sweetener and masking agent in pharmaceutical products.",

Some authors have investigated the pharmacological effects of \u2424GA and \u2423GA, demonstrating that their activity is qualitatively very similar, but with different intensity: for instance, the antihepatotoxic activity of \u2424GA is higher than that of \u2423GA, while its anti-inflammatory activity is considerably lower [15, 16] . Differences were also observed in the activity of cis and trans isomers in inhibiting the mutagenicity in Salmonella typhymurium [17] . Other authors have described the metabolism of G to GA, by observing the formation of the two isomers in animal species [4] . GA can be commercially produced by hydrolysis of G; this procedure yields mainly \u2424GA isomers, but \u2423GA may also be present [18] .",

A peak corresponding to G is also present in this electropherogram, however its quantification is not important because G can be determined by direct injection. The peaks of \u2423GA and \u2424GA are well defined in Fig. 6b , corresponding to the same root sample which was spiked with the analytes and subjected to the SPE procedure. The extraction yield values obtained were satisfactory, being 77% for \u2423GA and \u2424GA and 80% for the I.S.",
