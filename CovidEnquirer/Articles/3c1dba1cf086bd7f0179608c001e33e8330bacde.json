            "text": "Porcine deltacoronavirus (PDCoV), a newly discovered enteric coronavirus, is a causative agent of severe clinical diarrhea and intestinal pathological damage in piglets. As a first step toward understanding the effect of PDCoV on host cells, we elucidated mechanisms underlying the process of apoptotic cell death after PDCoV infection. The use of a pan-caspase inhibitor resulted in the inhibition of PDCoV-induced apoptosis and reduction of PDCoV replication, suggestive of the association of a caspase-dependent pathway. Furthermore, PDCoV infection necessitated the activation of the initiator caspase-9 responsible for the intrinsic mitochondrial apoptosis pathway. Experimental data indicated that PDCoV infection led to Bax-mediated mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP), resulting in specific relocation of the mitochondrial cytochrome c (cyt c) into the cytoplasm. Treatment with cyclosporin A (CsA), an inhibitor of mitochondrial permeability transition pore (MPTP) opening, significantly suppressed PDCoV-triggered apoptosis and viral replication. Moreover, cyt c release was completely abrogated in PDCoV-infected cells in the presence of CsA, suggesting the critical role of MPTP in intrinsic apoptosis in response to PDCoV infection. Altogether, our results indicate that PDCoV infection stimulates MOMP either via Bax recruitment or MPTP opening to permit the release of apoptogenic cyt c into the cytoplasm, thereby leading to execution of the caspase-dependent intrinsic apoptosis pathway to facilitate viral replication in vitro.",

ST cells were infected with PDCoV and CPE were monitored after infection. Light microscopy of PDCoV-infected ST cells indicated typical CPE characterized by cell rounding, clumping as clusters, and detachment, which were visible starting at 6 hpi and became prominent by 12 hpi (Fig. 1A , upper panels). To detect the intracellular fragmented DNA, cellular DNA from mock-or virus-infected cells was harvested and subjected to a DNA laddering assay. Consistent with the results of CPE observation, intracellular DNA fragmentation appeared at 6 hpi and the DNA ladder pattern was apparent at 9 hpi ( Fig. 1A , lower panel). This characteristic of apoptosis was further verified using a TUNEL assay. As shown in Fig. 1B , TUNEL-labeled (DNA damage and dead) cells were only observed within virus-infected cells as compared to mock-infected cells. The process of PDCoV-induced apoptosis was then assessed by staining the virus-and mock-infected cells with Annexin V/PI followed by FACS analysis to quantitatively determine the percentage of viable, apoptotic, and dead cells. PDCoV infection produced a significant level of apoptosis (Annexin V positive/PI negative) at 6 hpi. The percentage of earlystage apoptotic cells increased with the progression of infection and reached a maximum of 41.6% at 24 hpi ( Fig. 1C ). In addition, comparable kinetics of apoptosis were observed in ST cells infected with PDCoV at an MOI of 0.1 (data not shown). Taken together, these data confirm that PDCoV infection induced apoptosis in vitro.",

The results of the MTT assay revealed that none of the tested Z-VAD-FMK doses caused any change in the cell viability (data not shown).

Z-VAD-FMK inhibited viral replication by nearly 90% at the highest concentration tested (Fig. 2C ).

To identify the apoptosis pathway induced by PDCoV, specific inhibitors of caspase-8 or caspase-9 were used. ST cells were pretreated with Z-IETD-FMK (caspase-8 inhibitor) or Z-LEHD-FMK (caspase-9 inhibitor) at concentrations of 50 and 100 \u03bcM or DMSO and subjected to virus infection. PDCoV growth measured by CPE observation and IFA was similar between cells treated with Z-IETD-FMK and DMSO (Fig. 3A ). In contrast, treatment with Z-LEHD-FMK dramatically weakened PDCoV infectivity in ST cells. The level of PDCoV replication was indirectly measured by the quantification of cells expressing N protein using flow cytometry (Fig. 3B ). No impairment in PDCoV propagation was observed in the presence of Z-IETD-FMK, while the treatment of cells with 100 \u03bcM Z-LEHD-FMK resulted in \u226580% decrease in PDCoV infection as compared with the control group (DMSO-treated cells). The expression level of PDCoV N protein in the presence of each inhibitor or DMSO was also evaluated with Western blot analysis. Only caspase-9 inhibitor Z-LEHD-FMK exerted a detrimental effect on the viral protein production (Fig. 3C ). Densitometric analysis of Western blots revealed that the intracellular expression of N protein was effectively prevented by Z-LEHD-FMK, with an approximately 70% reduction at the highest concentration tested.",

Mitochondrial outer membrane permeabilization (MOMP) leads to the release of cyt c, which sequentially activates initiator caspase-9 and downstream effector caspase-3, thereby orchestrating the final apoptotic response ). To study the potential role of MOMP in the caspase-dependent pathway of PDCoV-induced apoptosis, we determined the subcellular localization of Bax and cyt c in PDCoVinfected cells using immunofluorescence confocal microscopy. As shown in Fig. 6A , Bax continued to be localized broadly in the mitochondria after PDCoV infection, evident from its colocalization with a mitochondrial-specific marker. On the other hand, cyt c was present in the cytosolic region and failed to colocalize with the mitochondria marker in the majority of cells infected with PDCoV. These observations were confirmed by Western blot analysis with mitochondrial and cytosolic or nuclear extracts. In comparison with mock-infected cells, PDCoV-infected cells exhibited an independent increase in levels of Bax and cyt c in the mitochondrial and cytosolic extracts, respectively (Fig. 6B, first and second panels) . To eliminate the possibility of association between caspase-independent process and PDCoV-triggered apoptosis, we analyzed the translocation of another apoptogenic molecule, apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF), which is proteolytically cleaved and released into the nucleus by MOMP to execute caspase-independent intrinsic apoptosis (Galluzzi et al., 2012) . In contrast to cyt c, AIF was detected in the mitochondria but absent in the nucleus throughout PDCoV infection period, as demonstrated from AIF and MitoTracker colocalization and AIF detection in mitochondrial fractions ( Fig. 6A and  B) . AIF retention in the mitochondria during PDCoV infection was concurrent with the execution of caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death by PDCoV as described above. Thus, PDCoV infection triggers Bax recruitment into the mitochondria, leading to MOMP and the consequent release of mitochondrial cyt c to commit cells to death. PDCoV-specific CPE was observed daily and photographed at 24 hpi using an inverted microscope at a magnification of 200\u00d7 (first panels). For immunostaining, infected cells were fixed at 12 hpi and incubated with MAb against PDCoV N protein, followed by incubation with Alexa green-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (second panels). The cells were counterstained with DAPI (third panels) and examined using a fluorescent microscope at 200\u00d7 magnification.

Cyclophilin D (CypD) is localized to the mitochondrial membrane matrix and acts as a key component in the process of MPTP opening (Baines et al., 2005; Schinzel et al., 2005) . Therefore, we evaluated if CypD inhibition may prevent apoptotic cell death induced by PDCoV. ST cells were treated with cyclosporin A (CsA), a chemical inhibitor of CypD, to prevent MPTP opening upon PDCoV infection. Following CsA treatment, PDCoV-induced apoptosis was quantitatively measured by Annexin V/PI flow cytometry. As shown in Fig. 7A , treatment with CsA notably decreased the percentage of PDCoV-induced early apoptotic cells (second panel) by 7.7-11.8% during the course of PDCoV infection (compared to Fig. 2A) . DNA laddering assay indicated that Z-VAD-FMK or CsA treatment in PDCoVinfected cells completely abolished the intracellular DNA fragmentation (Fig. 7B, lanes 3 and 4) , while cells infected with PDCoV alone clearly displayed a DNA laddering pattern (Fig. 7B, lane 2) . These results indicate that CsA-mediated CypD inhibition efficiently suppressed apoptotic cell death executed by PDCoV, suggesting that PDCoV infection may regulate the opening of MPTP.",

PDCoV-specific CPE were observed daily and photographed at 24 hpi using an inverted microscope at a magnification of 200\u00d7 (first panels). At 12 hpi, virus-infected cells were subjected to IFA with an anti-PDCoV N antibody (second panels), followed by DAPI counterstaining (third panels) and examination under a fluorescent microscope at 200\u00d7 magnification. (B) PDCoV production in the presence of each inhibitor was calculated by measuring the percentage of cells expressing N proteins through flow cytometry. (C) Viral protein translation in the presence of Z-IETD-FMK or Z-LEHD-FMK. Inhibitor-treated ST cells were mock-infected or infected with PDCoV for 1 h and cultivated in the presence or absence of each inhibitor. At 24 hpi, cellular lysates were examined by western blotting with an antibody against PDCoV N protein. The blot was also reacted with a mouse MAb against \u03b2-actin to verify equal protein loading. Each viral protein expression was quantitatively analyzed by densitometry in terms of the density value relative to that of \u03b2-actin. Inhibitor-treated samples were compared to DMSO-treated control. The values shown are the representative of the means from three independent experiments and the error bars denote standard deviations. *, P < 0.05; **, P < 0.001. retained during the infection and subsequent incubation. PDCoV replication was determined by monitoring virus-specific CPE and verified by IFA at 24 hpi (Fig. 8A) . In contrast to vehicle-treated control cells, cells treated with CsA showed a strong inhibitory effect on PDCoV propagation, as evident from the dramatic decrease in virus-induced CPE and viral gene expression. The number of cells expressing viral antigen, as quantified by N protein staining, reduced during CsA treatment, with almost 90% inhibition observed at 10 \u03bcM concentration (Fig. 8B) . We also treated cells with an AIF inhibitor, N-phenylmaleimide (N-PhMI), as a negative chemical control that prevents AIF-induced caspase-independent apoptosis (Kim and Lee, 2014; Susin et al., 1996; Wang et al., 2007) . Unlike CsA, N-PhMI treatment was incapable of inhibiting PDCoV infection even at the highest concentration used (Fig. 8A and B) . To further examine the antiviral activity of CsA against PDCoV replication, virus production was determined in the presence or absence of CsA. Western blot analysis revealed that 10 \u03bcM CsA treatment significantly prevented the intracellular expression of the viral protein (Fig. 9A ). After infection, viral supernatants were collected at 24 hpi and viral titers were measured. As shown in Fig. 9B , CsA treatment significantly reduced the release of viral progeny in a dose-dependent manner. The peak viral titer was determined as 10 7 \u00b7 5 TCID 50 / ml for the vehicle-treated control, whereas the addition of 10 \u03bcM CsA declined PDCoV titer to 10 2 \u00b7 7 TCID 50 /ml (almost 5-log reduction as compared with the control). The study of growth kinetics further demonstrated that the overall process of PDCoV replication was severely interfered by CsA (Fig. 9C) . Taken together, CsA proficiently suppressed PDCoV replication and inhibited PDCoV-induced apoptosis.",

In this direction, we determined whether CsA specifically affects the cytosolic translocation of cyt c mediated by PDCoV infection. Confocal microscopy results demonstrated that cyt c release in PDCoVinfected cells was distinctly hampered following CsA-mediated inhibition of CypD and cyt c was distributed in the mitochondria during PDCoV infection (Fig. 10A) . Mitochondrial retention of cyt c in the presence of CsA was confirmed by a cell fractionation assay. As expected, the level of cyt c in cytosolic fractions was barely detectable in the presence of CsA, demonstrating that CypD inhibition failed to cause the release of cyt c from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm (Fig. 10B , first panel). Although an increase in Bax level was observed in the mitochondria after 12 hpi (Fig. 10B , lanes 3 and 4 in second panel), CsA treatment reduced mitochondrial Bax (lane 2) and enhanced cytosolic Bax in PDCoV infected cells than in mock-infected cells (lanes 6-8). Altogether, these results indicate that CypD-dependent MPTP activation upon PDCoV infection directly modulated cyt c release, the commitment step in mitochondria-mediated apoptosis, thereby favoring viral replication in vitro.",

Considering apoptosis as one of the innate immune defense mechanisms, viruses may evade the apoptotic cell death and prolong the survival of infected cells to maximize the production of the viral progeny (Thomson, 2001) . However, several viruses promote apoptosis to facilitate the release and dissemination of the viral progeny for further invasion of the neighboring cells. This irreversible death event is characterized with cytolytic features after viral infections, including CPE in vitro or/and important biological processes promoting cell damage, tissue injury, and disease severity in vivo ( Kim and Lee, 2014; Lan et al., 2013; Lee and Kleiboeker, 2007; St-Louis and Archambault, 2007; Sarmento et al., 2006; Suzuki et al., 2008; Zhang et al., 2015) . The present study demonstrated that PDCoV triggers apoptosis in ST cells, as evident from apoptotic parameters including oligonucleosomal DNA fragmentation and PS exposure. This finding strongly suggests that the cytopathology of PDCoV infection represented by cell rounding, clumping, and detachment is associated with the apoptotic process that contributes to viral replication.",

To understand the molecular mechanisms underlying apoptosis caused by PDCoV, we focused on the potential involvement of the caspase cascade in the process of apoptosis upon PDCoV infection. Chemical inhibition of caspase activation was shown to prevent PDCoV-induced apoptosis and viral replication. Furthermore, treatment of cells with caspase-9 inhibitor, but not a caspase-8 inhibitor, greatly restricted PDCoV infection, indicative of the involvement of the mitochondria-mediated intrinsic apoptotic pathway in PDCoV infection. The upstream initiator caspase-9 and its downstream effector caspase-3 were proteolytically activated to induce the execution phase of apoptosis. PDCoV infection sequentially activated cleaved (active) forms of caspase-9 and caspase-3 at 6 and 12 hpi, respectively, and their levels increased thereafter with the progression of infection (Fig. 5) . Thus, the caspase-dependent apoptotic pathway seems to be manipulated by PDCoV to ensure competent viral replication in target cells.",

            "text": "As a response to various intracellular stimuli, both pro-and antiapoptotic signals converge toward the mitochondrion-centered control mechanism to provoke intrinsic apoptosis. Under this circumstance, MOMP, an irreversible step leading to apoptosis execution, may be initiated at the outer membrane of the mitochondria through the poreforming activity of pro-apoptotic Bax subfamily after their mitochondria relocation from the cytoplasm or via an abrupt increase in cell permeability through the opening of MPTP at the inner membrane (Brenner and Grimm, 2006; Galluzzi et al., 2012; Tait and Green, 2013) . This phenomenon permits the release of several apoptosismediating molecules, normally retained within the mitochondrial intermembrane space, into the cytosol (Galluzzi et al., 2012) . Of these, cytosolic cyt c assembles with other pro-apoptotic factors to form the apoptosome, which triggers the caspase-dependent proteolytic cascade (Galluzzi et al., 2012; Li et al., 1997) . On the other hand, AIF, a ubiquitously expressed flavoprotein, critically functions in the caspase-independent apoptosis process by relocating into the nucleus and promoting large-scale DNA fragmentation and cell death (Galluzzi et al., 2012; Joza et al., 2001; Susin et al., 1999) . As caspases are relevant to both PDCoV-induced apoptosis and viral replication, we investigated the status of cyt c release from the mitochondria of PDCoV-infected cells. The translocation of Bax into the mitochondria was observed during the early stage of PDCoV infection, wherein it likely participates in the formation of pores in MOM. At the same time, the majority of cyt c was detected and retained thereafter in the cytoplasm of PDCoV-infected cells. On the contrary, the displacement of AIF from the mitochondria to the nucleus was completely absent in PDCoV-infected cells, although porcine epidemic diarrhea virus, another swine enteric coronavirus, is known to relocate mitochondrial AIF to the nucleus to trigger apoptotic cell death (Kim and Lee, 2014) . This result further supports the hypothesis that PDCoV triggers apoptosis in a caspasedependent manner. The association between PDCoV-induced apoptosis and cyt c release and the subsequent caspase activation without AIF nuclear translocation suggest that cyt c is the key pro-apoptotic factor released via alterations in the mitochondrial membrane permeability mediated by Bax proteins and acts directly to execute apoptotic cell death in PDCoV infection.",

            "text": "It is anticipated that apoptosis related to mitochondrial dysfunction may contribute to commitment of PDCoV-infected cells to death. Although we observed continuously lower levels of cytosolic Bax in PDCoV-infected cells than in mock-infected cells, we were unable to consistently detect increased levels of mitochondrial Bax throughout the entire period of PDCoV infection (Fig. 6B ). This observation leads us to speculate that an alternative mechanism with regard to the opening process following MPTP formation may exist to regulate MOMP during PDCoV infection. CsA acts as a specific inhibitor of MPTP opening by inhibiting the activity of CypD that constitutes the MPTP complex in the mitochondrial inner membrane. Our results show that the pharmacological inhibition of MPTP opening with CsA suppressed PDCoV-induced apoptosis, as 80-90% cell survival was observed in CsA-treated cells after PDCoV infection (comparable to mock-infected cells). Furthermore, CsA exerted its antiviral activity through the inhibition of multiple steps of PDCoV life cycle, including viral protein translation and spread of viral progeny. Inhibitory activities of CsA on PDCoV infection were more efficient than those of caspase inhibitors in terms of antiviral effects (5-log versus 3-log reduction) and effective minimal doses (5 \u03bcM versus 50 \u03bcM), albeit independent treatment with each pan or specific caspase inhibitor also exhibited significant suppression of PDCoV replication in its own way. This discrimination may be attributed to the wide-spectrum antiviral effect of CsA as an inhibitor members of the cellular cyclophilin (Cyp) family via multiple simultaneous mechanisms. In particular, CsA is known to suppress the replication of a variety of RNA viruses, including nidoviruses, by affecting the function of other Cyps, such as CypA and CypB, involved in viral biosynthesis and the interaction with viral constituents (de Wilde et al., 2013; Kambara et al., 2011; Kim and Lee, 2014; Nakagawa et al., 2004; Pfefferle et al., 2011; Qing et al., 2009 ). Since the present study primarily focused on CypD as an MPTP opening component associated with PDCoV-induced apoptosis, no experiments were conducted to investigate the participation of other Cyps in the replication of PDCoV. However, we cannot exclude that CsA could synchronously inhibit cellular CypA and CypB that may contribute to PDCoV infection in vitro. Although potential roles of these Cyps in PDCoV replication remain to be determined, thus, it is feasible that CsA may synergistically elicit its anti-PDCoV activity through the inhibition of CypD as well as CypA or/ and CypB.",

Therefore, CypD-activated MPTP modulation plays a pivotal role in caspase-dependent apoptosis of cells by controlling cyt c release after PDCoV infection. Bax translocation into the mitochondria was also inhibited by CsA at 6 dpi ( Fig. 10B) when Bax recruitment into the mitochondria was maximum (Fig. 6B) . Bax is displaced toward the mitochondria and may directly interact with CypD to facilitate the formation of MPTP to regulate the cyt c release (Favreau et al., 2012; Kumarswamy and Chandna, 2009; Oka et al., 2008) . As the transient MPTP opening provides a feedforward signal to augment Bax translocation into the mitochondria, these observations may be consistent with CsA-mediated inhibition of the amplification step.",

            "text": "In summary, our findings reveal that PDCoV induces apoptosismediated cell death, a cytolytic mechanism causing CPE in vitro. PDCoV-induced apoptosis was accompanied with the activation of caspase cascades and promoted effective viral replication in vitro. The mitochondrial translocation of Bax and concomitant cytosolic release of PDCoV-infected cells were further maintained for 48 h in the presence of vehicle or CsA. PDCoV-specific CPE was observed daily and photographed at 24 hpi using an inverted microscope at a magnification of 200\u00d7 (first panels). For immunostaining, infected cells were fixed at 12 hpi and stained with an anti-PDCoV N protein antibody, followed by incubation with Alexa green-conjugated goat anti-mouse secondary antibody (second panels). The cells were counterstained with DAPI (third panels) and examined using a fluorescent microscope at 200\u00d7 magnification. (B) Virus production in the presence of CsA or N-PhMI was calculated by measuring the percentage of cells expressing N proteins with flow cytometry. The values shown are the representative of the means of three independent experiments and error bars represent standard deviations. **, P < 0.001. cyt c strongly indicated that Bax-mediated MOMP induces the intrinsic cell death event after PDCoV infection. We demonstrated the essential role of MPTP in apoptosis in response to PDCoV infection. MOMP is the consequence of MPTP opening that results in the collapse of the mitochondrial membrane potential, followed by the characteristic and specific relocalization of cyt c into the cytoplasm to mediate caspasedependent apoptosis. Furthermore, pharmacological inhibition of MPTP opening abrogated the life cycle of PDCoV at subcytotoxic doses. Although MOMP necessarily contributes to the execution of PDCoVinduced apoptosis, the upstream intracellular regulatory signal(s) and the viral protein(s) associated with this mitochondrion-centered intrinsic apoptotic pathway mediated by PDCoV are still unclear. Future studies are warranted to identify cellular and viral factors involved in this process. In conclusion, PDCoV infection causes the release of cyt c through MOMP activation mediated by two non-mutually exclusive mechanisms, apoptosis signaling events (Bax translocation and mitochondria permeabilization) and MPTP opening, thereby triggering caspase-dependent apoptotic cell death that is required for PDCoV replication. Our results provide insights into the comprehensive understanding of the relationship between PDCoV and host cells. ",

For DNA fragmentation assay, DNA was extracted from mock-or PDCoV-infected cells and nucleosomal DNA fragmentation of cells was analyzed by agarose gel electrophoresis (bottom panel). As a positive control (PC), cells were treated with staurosporine for 24 h to induce apoptosis. Lane M represents a 1-kb ladder as a DNA molecular-weight size marker. (B) TUNEL labeling of PDCoV-infected cells. Mock-infected control and PDCoV-infected cells fixed at 24 hpi were labeled with TUNEL (green) and sequentially stained with an anti-PDCoV-N antibody (red). Cells were counterstained with DAPI, and photomicrographs of TUNEL labeling and N protein staining in virus-infected cells were obtained using a confocal microscope at 400\u00d7 magnification. In a merged image, all TUNEL-positive cells were localized within the nuclei of the corresponding PDCoV-infected cells. (C) Cell death analysis by flow cytometry with dual Annexin V-PI cell labeling. PDCoV-infected cells collected at different time points were subjected to dual Annexin V and PI labeling and analyzed by FACS. Lower left quadrants represent intact cells (Annexin V negative/PI negative); Lower right quadrants represent early apoptotic cells (Annexin V positive/PI negative); Upper right quadrants indicate late apoptotic and/or necrotic cells (Annexin V positive/PI negative); and Upper left quadrants indicate necrotic cells (Annexin V negative/PI positive).

At 12 hpi, mock-infected or PDCoV-infected ST cells were labeled with MitoTracker Red CMXRos (red), fixed, and independently incubated with a primary antibody against Bax, cyt c, or AIF (green). Bax mitochondrial translocation is represented as the merger of Bax and mitochondrial marker (yellow), while the residual cytosolic localization is indicated by single staining signal (green). Conversely, cyt c cytosolic translocation is represented by single staining signal (green), and residual mitochondrial accumulation is indicated as the merger of cyt c and MitoTracker (yellow). AIF mitochondrial retention is represented as the merger of AIF and mitochondrial marker (yellow). The inset images are enlarged versions of parts of the picture. (B) Western blot analysis for Bax, cyt c, and AIF. The mitochondrial, cytosolic, and nuclear fractions were subjected to western blotting with an antibody directed against Bax (top panel), cyt c (second panel), VDAC (mitochondrial protein marker; third panel), \u03b1-tubulin (cytosolic protein marker; fourth panel), AIF (fifth panel), or Sp1 (nuclear protein marker; bottom panel). Lane M, mockinfected samples. All subcellular protein markers served as loading controls. The number under each band represents the fold change in each apoptosis-related protein level expressed as the densitometric unit of the band normalized to the corresponding loading control level as compared to the mock-infected control.
