Pathologic features were consistent with disease in primates.

From December 2013 through January 2016, the devastating emergence of ZEBOV in Western Africa resulted in overwhelming societal tolls in the region. The already weakened public health infrastructure of the region, coupled with a dearth of available, approved diagnostic assays, vaccines, or therapeutic agents, likely contributed to the severity of this epidemic. During the course of the epidemic, a number of medical countermeasures were introduced, but screening and validation of these interventions in animal models were limited by the use of host-adapted small-animal models or the availability of nonhuman primate (NHP) resources [1] .",

Several immunocompetent small-animal models have been developed for ZEBOV, including mice, hamsters, and guinea pigs. However, all of these small-animal models require host adaptation of the challenge virus [1] . Some severely immunodeficient models have been described, allowing the use of wild-type virus, but there are substantial limitations in the usefulness of these models in the development of countermeasures for circumstances in which dependency on an intact immune response is central [1, 2] . A further limitation is that only the NHP models account for the different species of Ebolavirus beyond ZEBOV, with the recent exception of guinea pig models of SEBOV [3, 4] .",

None of these ferret models require adaptation of the challenge virus to produce a lethal infection. Recent availability of an annotated genome for the ferret has suggested that the susceptibility it shares with humans to these infections is potentially attributable to substantial homologies to many disease-relevant human proteins, including viral entry receptors [6] . Collectively, these data provided the rationale to assess the utility of the ferret as a model for Ebolavirus disease. Here, we performed a narrowly focused study to determine whether ferrets have the potential to serve as a small-animal model for 3 species of Ebolavirus.",

Subjects were challenged intranasally with 1000 plaque-forming units (PFU) of ZEBOV strain Kikwit (n = 5), SEBOV strain Gulu (n = 5), and BEBOV (n = 5), respectively. The passage history of challenge viruses can be found in the Supplementary Methods. To account for variations between challenge events, 2 independent studies were completed, with the initial experiment having 3 animals, followed by a repeat confirmatory study with 2 additional ferrets per virus group. Whole-blood, ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid-associated plasma, and citrated plasma samples were collected from the superior vena cava for hematologic, serum biochemical, and coagulation assays and viremia determination on days 0, 2, 4, and 6 and at the time of euthanasia.

Clinical scores were determined on a scale of 0-12, based on coat appearance, social behavior, and provoked behavior.

Progressive increases in levels of circulating fibrinogen were also noted beginning on day 4, which were followed by marked depletion in all terminal animals. Circulating activated protein C activity was diminished to approximately 50% in terminal SEBOV-and BEBOV-infected animals. Interestingly, a sharp increase in activity was noted in all terminal ZEBOV-infected animals ( ",

The Gulu and Kikwit strains have been used by much of the filovirus research community as prototype strains for validating countermeasures in NHPs, and thus screening in ferrets may increase predictive efficacy of such interventions.",

The mucosal route of infection has been implicated as an important means of Ebolavirus transmission and has also been demonstrated as an effective method of artificial infection by small-particle aerosol [9] [10] [11] . Accordingly, we challenged ferrets intranasally, a commonly used route in challenge experiments, to assess the mucosal route of infection prior to attempts using less natural routes of infection (eg, parenteral injection). The resulting uniform lethality demonstrates the utility of this intranasal infection model in potential mucosal-mediated transmission experiments or small-particle aerosol challenge, the latter being highly relevant for biodefenserelated concerns. A remarkable point about the intranasal mode of infection is that, despite having direct access to the lungs upon infection, we observed minimal evidence of gross lung pathology; rather, the most impressive pathology and viral burdens were noted in the liver and spleen, just as in NHPs experimentally infected via the intramuscular route.",
