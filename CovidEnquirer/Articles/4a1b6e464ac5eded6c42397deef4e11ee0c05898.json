Efficacy apparently proven in a well-recognized disorder may or may not prove to be attainable in a closely related disorder or in certain subgroups of patients. On occasion, the dose estimated in the initial studies might ultimately prove inadequate: From 1969 onwards, clinical studies with ibuprofen concluded that it was effective in rheumatoid arthritis in doses of 400 mg or 600 mg daily, though higher doses were tolerated. (Martindale 1977 at p. 193) Thirty years later, in 1999, commonly cited anti-inflammatory doses were 2000 mg to 2400 mg or more. (Felleskatalog 1999) During hearings before the passage of the 1962 Kefauver-Harris Amendments to America's Food, Drug and Cosmetic legislation, both scientific and public representatives had stressed the need for legal and medical certainty in drug regulation (Nielsen 1986); the legislation as amended required both efficacy and safety to be proven, the applicant being firmly obliged \"to show whether such drug is safe for use under the conditions prescribed, recommended or suggested in the proposed labelling thereof \"(Art 355d). The authorities were nevertheless entitled to withdraw their approval if efficacy or safety were subsequently found not to have been established, thus introducing an element of doubt. In the meantime the pioneering legislation in The Netherlands (WOG 1958) had exhibited even greater caution; the efficacy and safety were to be demonstrated \"according to the judgement of the reasonable man\" and the judgement of the reasonable man could clearly change as time went by. What all this meant was that a firm applying successfully to market a new drug was by no means handed a guarantee of its future and permanent acceptability. The need for continued watchfulness on the part of the company was also apparent from the obligation to maintain records of apparent adverse reactions and report them to the FDA, but also from the requirement that the manufacturer maintain records on other matters relating to the drug, communicating new developments to the agency in the same manner. Provisions such as these, which have subsequently found their way into many other national laws and regulations, mean that the manufacturer or other licensee for a drug today has continuing duties with respect to the drug so long as it remains on the market.",

For some drugs it may be necessary to require the originator company to undertake intensive monitoring, set up supplementary studies or perform particular tests during treatment. New Zealand was a pioneer in \"intensive monitoring\", an arrangement by which a limited patient population receiving a drug is followed in great detail so that all events, wanted and unwanted, can be recorded. Now known as \"monitored release\" it can be required where an agency cannot take a firm decision on the future of an apparently valuable drug without more detailed information from the field. The exact duties differ from one regulatory system to another, but for all drugs, post-marketing surveillance in the form of adverse reaction monitoring and submission of new findings from other sources will be necessary.

Standards in medicine or biology are rarely as sharply defined as they can be in pharmacy or any other of the exact sciences. Some aspects of the quality of a drug can be defined in exact mathematical terms, but neither safety nor efficacy can be so rigidly circumscribed. Estimates of each inevitably vary; no drug can be expected to prove effective in 100% of the patients for whom it is prescribed, and no drug is entirely free of adverse reactions. In all three fields therefore one encounters difficulties in interpreting the law when taking decisions on particular drugs, either at the outset of their career or later.",

In 1930, with no antibiotics available, lobar pneumonia was commonly a fatal disease, and had a drug been created at the time that was capable of saving 30% of lives it would have been a godsend.

There is no single, simple and universally relevant means of expressing quality or setting a quality threshold. Desmond Laurence's admirable \"Dictionary of Pharmacology and Allied Topics\" does not define quality beyond ruling that \"It is essential that manufactured medicines be of high and consistent quality.\" (Laurence 1998 at p. 282) Even plain water has various levels of quality: alongside water approved for human consumption (aqua potabilis, aqua communis) the pharmacopoeias provide specifications and modes of preparation for both purified water (aqua purificata) which is prepared by distillation, reverse osmosis or other suitable methods and then stored in inert airtight containers, and water for injection (aqua ad injectionem) which is sterile and free of pyrogens. Physiological saline -plain salt solution -has at least five measures for quality and several standards; one must know its actual concentration, the degree to which that concentration can be allowed to vary, its degree of chemical purity and the permissible degree of contamination with bacteria, viruses or pyrogens. For a finished medicine there will be far more measures of quality and numerous matters on which experts (and regulatory agencies) may disagree regarding the necessary standards, ranging from issues of colour to stability and from disintegration time to bioavailability. If the quality standards are set too low the medicine may be ineffective or dangerous, whereas if too much is demanded the work of making the medicine and checking the quality of every batch may be so laborious as to render it unaffordable. These are not minor matters, since they have both medical and judicial consequences; the law requires in general terms that drugs be of adequate quality and imposes sanctions if they are not; there are detailed and legally established procedures for setting the standards applicable to any individual medicine and testing to these standards; finally one will be obliged to ensure that the medicine attains all those standards throughout its shelf life, and to reject or discard any medicine that fails to do so.",

Most significant pharmacopoeias are state publications authorized by law; 3 a well-equipped laboratory is likely to have some 30 current pharmacopoeias to hand including three regional or international volumes (the International, European and Nordic Pharmacopoeia). Although in recent years an increasing number of national pharmacopoeias have been assimilated in whole or in part into the regional volumes, a number of newly independent countries are currently preparing to institute national pharmacopoeias of their own, particularly where there is a national (e.g. herbal) medicinal tradition.",

During the twentieth century, in which time medicine has moved largely to the use of single substances (synthetic or extracted from natural materials) the choice of medicines in daily use has become more uniform throughout the world. The various pharmacopoeias have therefore drawn closer together in their selection of monographs and actual content, often sharing complete monographs.

In addition, the existing governance structure excludes many of the stakeholders affected by the process, including developing countries, consumers, and health professionals\u2026 The motivation behind extending the guidelines beyond ICH countries is not clear. Nevertheless, it is notable that the multinational pharmaceutical industry -far more than drug regulators -stands to benefit commercially and strategically from the globalisation of ICH guidelines, and therefore has likely been the driving force behind it. For example, higher standards for the quality of raw materials and drugs may allow ICH countries to protect themselves from lower-priced (generic) imports from other markets that do not hold to ICH quality standards, while ensuring continued access to high quality raw materials from non-ICH countries for their domestic manufacturers.

The nature of contaminants would affect the extent to which their presence could be tolerated in the finished product. Some of the pharmacists on the other hand were prone to insist on the highest attainable standard of quality, for example with product content varying only between 99% and 101% of the norm. Discussions tended to end in a compromise in view of evidence adduced by manufacturers as to the expense of maintaining quality at an unnecessarily high level, especially once a drug was out in the field.

They brought actions for damages against the defendants, the authorities responsible for the production of blood and blood products. During the period when most of the claimants were infected, the risk of such infection through blood transfusions, though known to the medical profession, was impossible to avoid, either because the virus itself had not yet been discovered or because there was no way of testing for its presence in blood. Accordingly, the claims were brought not in negligence, but under the Consumer Protection Act 1987 which implemented the European Product Liability Directive of 1985 under which a product was defective when it did not provide the safety which a person was entitled to expect, taking all circumstances into account, including the presentation of the product, the use to which it could reasonably be expected that the product would be put and the time when the product was put into circulation. Article 7(e)b of the Act provided the producer with a defence if he could establish that the state of scientific and technical knowledge at the time when he put the product into circulation was not such as to enable 'the existence of the defect' to be discovered. In the trial of the six lead cases, the defendants accepted that a producer's liability under art 6 of the Act was irrespective of fault. They nevertheless contended that, in assessing whether the infected blood was defective, the unavoidability of the risk was a circumstance to be taken into account, and that the The Law and Ethics of the Pharmaceutical Industry 151 most that the public was entitled to expect was that all reasonably available precautions had been carried out, not that the blood would be 100% clean. In so contending, the defendants submitted that the infected blood was to be regarded as an inherently risky standard product (i.e. one which performed as the producer intended) rather than a non-standard product (i.e. a product which was deficient or inferior in terms of safety from the standard product, and whose harmful characteristic, not present in the standard product, had caused the material injury or damage). They also relied on the fact that they were obliged to produce blood and had no alternative but to supply it to hospitals and patients, as a service to society. Alternatively, the defendants sought to rely on the art 7(e) defence, contending that an unavoidable risk qualified for protection under it if the producer was unable to discover, by means of accessible information, the defect in a particular product.",

In that provision, 'all circumstances' meant all relevant circumstances. Avoidability was not a relevant circumstance since it fell outside the purpose of the directive, which was intended to eliminate proof of fault or negligence. That was not simply a legal consequence. It was also intended to make it easier for claimants to prove their case, such that not only would a consumer not have to prove that the producer had not taken reasonable steps, or all reasonable steps, to comply with his duty of care, but also that the producer had not taken all legitimately expectable steps either. Even without the full panoply of allegations of negligence, the adoption of tests of avoidability or of legitimately expectable safety precautions would inevitably involve a substantial investigation. If it had been intended that avoidability would be included as a derogation from, or a palliation of, the directive's purpose, it would have been mentioned. It would have been an important circumstance, and it was intended that the most significant circumstances were those listed. In the case of a non-standard product, the circumstances specified in art 6 might obviously be relevant, as well as the circumstances of the supply. However, the primary issue might be whether the public at large accepted the non-standard nature of the product, i.e. whether they accepted that a proportion of the products was defective. That was not the end of the matter, because the question was one of legitimate expectation, and the court might conclude that the expectation of the public was too high or too low. Questions such as warnings and presentations would be in the forefront, but the avoidability of the harmful characteristic, the impractability, cost or difficulty of precautionary measures, and the benefit to society or the utility of the product (except in the context of whether, with full information and proper knowledge, the public had and should have accepted the risk) were not relevant. In the instant case, the infected blood products were non-standard products since they were different from the norm which the producer intended for use by the public. They were defective within art 6 because the public at large was entitled to expect that the blood transfused to them would be free from infection. There had been no warnings and no material publicity. The knowledge of the medical profession, not materially or at all shared with the consumer, was of no relevance. Nor was it material to consider whether any further steps could have been taken to avoid or palliate the risk that the blood would be infected.",

Once the existence of the defect was known, there was the risk of that defect materialising in any particular product, and it was immaterial that the known risk was unavoidable in the particular product. It would be inconsistent with the purpose of the directive if a producer, in the case of a known risk, continued to supply products simply because, and despite the fact, that he was unable to identify in which of his products that defect would occur or recur, or, more relevantly in a case where the producer was obliged to supply, he continued to supply without accepting the responsibility for any injuries resulting, by insurance or otherwise. Such a conclusion did not mean that non-standard products were incapable of coming within art 7(e).

From 1960 onwards however, a neurological condition known as Subacute Myelo-opticoneuropathy (SMON) became frequent in Japan, proceeding to paralysis, blindness and sometimes death. An official enquiry into the cause of the disease led to the discovery of a clioquinol metabolite in the urine of the victims, and a close correlation was subsequently found between use of the drug (which in Japan was unusually heavy) and the occurrence of the disease; cases were also reported in other countries. (Soda 1980, Dukes 1981) The drug was rapidly prohibited or withdrawn in Japan and in many western industrialized countries, but continued to be produced on a large scale for use elsewhere. Ultimately, prolonged pressure by officials of the World Health Organization appears to have led to corporate reassessment of the situation and the manufacture was after a number of years discontinued. (Dunne 1993) Where a drug is shown, rapidly and convincingly, to bring with it disproportionate risks, a manufacturer will commonly withdraw it without protest and even at his own initiative, believing this to be in the common interest. Serious conflicts between the public and the commercial interest can however arise where the business interests at stake are large and longstanding, and especially where the proof of injury is less than absolute. The legal and other mechanisms which might provide a basis for global public action are still not in place, although much-publicized restrictive actions in one major country or region are often emulated in another.",

A relevant question for a Court will clearly be whether occurrence of the injury was attributable to the drug's use in a particular nonapproved indication or not. If so, the patient might be able to bring a case against the prescriber rather than the manufacturer of the drug, e.g. if the prescribing was ill-considered.

Methods for the detection of adverse reactions are also heavily attuned to detecting physical damage.

As late as 1941, standard medical texts declared that addiction to these drugs probably did not occur (Goodman Gilman 1941), but by 1950 addiction to high doses had been proven and by 1958 \"chronic barbiturate addiction\" had been demonstrated. In 1957 Hoffmann La Roche introduced the first benzodiazepine tranquillizer, chlordiazepoxide (Librium) and many benzodiazepines followed either as daytime sedatives or nighttime hypnotics (Medawar 1992). The belief was widely propagated that these drugs did not produce dependence and they largely replaced the barbiturates for this reason. In fact addiction had been demonstrated from 1961 onwards but was dismissed by investigators associated with the company as occurring only with excessive doses or in addiction-prone personalities. By 1973 the Third US District Court of Appeals in Philadelphia, considering a move to have two benzodiazepines listed as controlled drugs, noted that they produced euphoria, tolerance, withdrawal reactions and paradoxical rage and had a substantial potential for abuse; (Pekkanen 1973) nevertheless, by 1979 benzodiazepine use in Britain alone peaked at 30 million prescriptions yearly. The Roche company long continued, through its associated experts, to deny any significant dependence risk (Marks 1978); the dangers however became increasingly clear with the introduction of short-acting benzodiazepines where the withdrawal reactions appeared earlier and were more violent. Agitation, amnesia and psychotic reactions, including murderous and suicidal behaviour, were documented. There has since been massive litigation against the manufacturers of the benzodiazepines. Though some cases have been sidetracked (notably by the withdrawal of legal aid to 12,000 litigants in Britain) very large sums have been paid out in damages. The injuries concerned were matters which could to a large extent have been recognized, acknowledged, and publicized many years earlier and thereby largely avoided. However, many millions of patients have for much of their lives become accustomed to a tranquillized state in which they are cocooned from worry and stress and concerned about the effects of withdrawing the drugs; so long as their physician is willing to continue to prescribe benzodiazepines they have therefore seen no reason to complain.",

During the period of ascendancy of the tranquillizers they had been used for \"anxiety\" while depression had been treated mainly with the \"tricyclic antidepressants\" which were effective but somewhat toxic; both types of drug were often given together. In 1989 the first of a new class of drugs -termed by their makers \"selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors\" (SSRI) was introduced to treat depression. Fluoxetine (Prozac) was followed by others including paroxetine (Paxil) and sertraline (Zoloft). There has been criticism both of the literature claiming to prove efficacy and of the hypothesis that depression is linked to serotonin levels. Since it is well known that the majority of cases of true depression recover spontaneously, the true indications for treatment are limited, but sales of the various SSRI inhibitors have attained levels similar to those reach by the benzodiazepines at the peak of their popularity. Popular books, the mass media and some advertising have portrayed the SSRI inhibitors as being suitable for the relief of various forms of unhappiness and worry and have disseminated the notion that these constitute depression; there is also a wide public impression that the products induce a marked form of euphoria (\"the happiness pill.\") However Medawar (2004) The above histories illustrate the fact that the study of drug safety is by no means a simple question of collating and reporting unpleasant physical symptoms. The unwanted effects on an individual, especially when they concern states of mind, can be extraordinarily difficult to recognize as such; they may even be mistaken for welcome effects and underlie a demand for the product concerned, a demand that can all too easily be further stimulated.",

Individual practitioners observing unexpected and unwanted effects might report them in a journal letter, and an occasional study might be performed and published of an unwelcome phenomenon, but that was all. Within companies one might find a \"complaints register\" in which reports of apparent problems of all types were collected, but again unsystematically. From 1964 onwards however a series of countries established national adverse reaction monitoring centres and invited practitioners to report suspected adverse reactions for evaluation. As a rule such a centre would also communicate the reports in outline, without identifying names, to the companies concerned and seek their comments. In the United States the FDA considered it appropriate for physicians to hand their reports to the company's travelling representative and the firms themselves were obliged to pass these reports to the FDA; physicians however also had a right to report to the FDA directly if they so wished, though only a minority did so. The World Health Organization established an International Centre (in Geneva, later in Uppsala, Sweden) where the reports from the national centres could be collated and examined; as of 2004, 55 countries were contributing to the system. The European Union has its own centre (EUDRAVigilance), processing reports from national agencies. More recently, following successful experience in Sweden with direct reporting of adverse reactions by patients, agencies have begun to establish contacts with the public in both directions, both receiving reports and making Drug Analysis Prints publicly available. (Yellowcard 2005) The legal framework for pharmacovigilance of medicinal products for human use in the Community is given in Council Regulation (EEC) No 2309/93 and Council Directive 2001/83/EC and is based primarily on ICH guidelines. Both the marketing authorisation holder (MAH) and the competent authorities are obliged to maintain pharmacovigilance systems and all relevant information should be shared between them, as well as with other EU and EEA member states. The marketing authorisation holder must ensure that it has an appropriate system of pharmacovigilance in place in order to assure responsibility and liability for its products on the market and to ensure that appropriate action can be taken, when necessary. The marketing authorisation holder should have permanently and continuously at its disposal in the European Economic Area (EEA), a \"qualified person\" responsible for pharmacovigilance who if not medically qualified should report to, or have access to a medically qualified person. National regulations in some Member States require in addition a nominated individual in that country who has specific legal obligations in respect of pharmacovigilance at a national level. The qualified person is responsible for the establishment and maintenance of a system which ensures that information about all suspected adverse reactions which are reported to the personnel of the marketing authorisation holder, including medical representatives, is collected and collated in order to be accessible at least at one point within the Community for the preparation for competent authorities of the Member States, where the medicinal product is authorised, of the adverse drug reaction (ADR) reports, Periodic Safety Update Reports (PSURs) and company sponsored post-authorisation study reports. Ongoing pharmacovigilance evaluation ensures provision of information requested by the authorities in the countries where the product is marketed, including figures on sales and prescriptions if required. The marketing authorisation holder is responsible for reporting suspected adverse reactions to the authorities of the Member States and the European Agency. For medicinal products authorised through centralised or national procedures, including through mutual recognition, suspected adverse reactions received from health-care professionals should be reported. Spontaneously reported suspected adverse reactions, suspected adverse reactions from post-authorisation studies and those reported in the world-wide literature are included.

            "text": "The major problem with the current system for ensuring the safety of medications is that drug manufacturers are largely responsible for collecting, evaluating, and reporting data from post-marketing studies of their own products. This approach has many inherent problems. For instance, it appears that fewer than half of the post-marketing studies that manufacturers have made commitments to undertake as a condition of approval have been completed and many have not even been initiated. Moreover, despite the mandatory adverse event reporting system for companies subject to the FDA's post-marketing safety reporting regulations, drug manufacturers may be tempted to conceal available data that may signal the possibility of major risks. In some cases, the FDA and drug manufacturers may fail to act on that information and fail to conduct appropriate studies to examine a potential risk rigorously and promptly.\" (Fontanarosa 2004) In the same issue of the same Journal, Psaty and co-authors, from their own experience with a major adverse reaction problem leading to withdrawal of a drug, express similar concern. Summarizing the changes in recent years in the U.S. drug regulatory environment aimed at more rapid approval of new drugs, they conclude that that this approach \"relied increasingly on the pharmaceutical industry to conduct its own post-marketing safety evaluation.\" They raise the concern that \"a pharmaceutical company's appraisal of suspected ADRs may be influenced by economic considerations,\" and call for legislation to \"mandate and provide adequate support for independent reviews and analysis of post-marketing data.\" (Psaty et al. 2004) In the light of such concerns and evidence of practice to date, one is bound to ask how dependable the industrial input from some companies into the new European network and central register (EUDRA 2004) can be made. In the US, a thorough re-examination of the process is now being undertaken with a view to improve both its input and its central authority. It could be that the output of that re-examination could be of value in other countries as well, and helpful to the industry in putting its own house in order.",

Both the Divisional Court and subsequently the Court of Appeal found for the company: the latter considered that under Section 28 of the Medicines Act the Licensing Authority had discretion to make comparisons with other drugs in forming its judgement, and that such comparisons could relate to safety in overdose where this was relevant. (Brahams 1990) This particular case is exceptional to the extent that antidepressant drugs pose a special problem; many older antidepressants are dangerous in overdose, yet they have to be employed in patients who because of their depression are prone to commit suicide by taking the product in excessive doses; it is not clear that overdose is equally relevant when assessing the overall safety of drugs in other classes.",

In the years following, the \"hormonal pregnancy tests\" in use at the time were accused of disrupting some pregnancies by inducing uterine bleeding despite the presence of a foetus. The anti-nausea combination Bendectin (also known in modified form as Debendox), specifically intended to relieve nausea of 168 Chapter 4 pregnancy, was withdrawn on suspicion (probably incorrect) of being a mild teratogen. (Bryan 1980) The most serious of the dramas was that involving diethylstilbestrol (DES) and it illustrates both the medical and legal problems which can surround drug-based teratogenicity: (Noller 1990 , Anon. 2003 Diethylstilbestrol was developed in the United Kingdom prior to 1940 as an effective low-cost oestrogenic hormone. For altruistic reasons the inventor left it unpatented and the drug was therefore soon marketed by many companies. Two U.S. physicians intensively propagated its use in pregnancy for treating threatened abortion or preventing habitual abortion. Few clinical trials were ever performed and the reasons for thinking that it might be useful in pregnancy were mainly theoretical; it is doubtful whether it had any useful effect whatsoever. However, some 12-15 years after the peak of its use had passed it was found that female children of these pregnancies tended to develop vaginal changes when reaching adolescence or adulthood and that these could become cancerous; there was also a high incidence of fertility disturbances among these daughters. Analogous changes were found in some male offspring. The scale of the DES disaster apparently much exceeds that of thalidomide, since the drug was used in many hundreds of thousands of pregnancies, with a particularly high incidence in the U.S.A. and The Netherlands (Buitendijk 1984). Some thousands of cases have been brought to court, most directed against former manufacturers but some against the U.S. FDA. Problems in dealing with liability arise mainly because of the very late manifestation of the injury (making it difficult to prove that the drug was taken) and the multiplicity of former producers. As with the thalidomide case, however, an important element in determining causality is the characteristic nature of the defect. Though the material is not homogeneous and strict statistical analysis of some of the epidemiological data inevitably points to shortcomings, there is overwhelming evidence of a cause-and-effect relationship. There is also increasing evidence that some defects can appear in the third generation, i.e. the grandchildren of the original users (Lynch et al. 1990 ).",

As a general rule of English law, the fact that a defendant has adhered to standards demanded by statute 17 is not decisive in cases where negligence is at issue.

The cost would be refunded if the drug failed to improve symptoms within six months or if the patient needed prostatic surgery within two years. A urologist commented that most cases of prostatic hyperplasia indeed reacted well to antiandrogen therapy, though a significant minority failed to improve at all. However, since most patients were only being treated for their symptoms, any subsequent assessment of benefit was bound to be largely subjective. A company spokesman noted that patients \"had to comply with treatment at least three quarters of the time for the offer to hold\". (BMJ 1994) There is some advertising for pharmaceutical products which carries with it such emphatic implied promises that an analogous situation could The Law and Ethics of the Pharmaceutical Industry 175 on occasion arise 21 and it is common in US litigation for statements of claim to allege that the defendant manufacturer has breached \"express and implied warranties of merchantability and fitness for a particular purpose\" 22 which can rely heavily upon texts which appear to constitute a warranty. A relevant issue in this connection could be the custom of many manufacturers, noted above, to use extremely emphatic printed advertising texts and visual messages, while approved textual material from the data sheet is appended only in much smaller print. While a strictly formalistic approach would lead to the view that the small print counterbalances the exuberance of the main message, a court might more realistically look to the promises made or implied in those parts of the promotional effort which the physician or patient is most likely (and is indeed intended) to assimilate. 23 It is indeed notable that courts in the United States, where \"warranty\" plays a more prominent role than elsewhere, have been willing to interpret various forms of promotional text as implying warranties. In the case of vaccines (see Chapter 9) the implied promise of efficacy is particularly strong. The oral contraceptives constitute a special case, largely because their degree of efficacy is commonly claimed (and correctly assumed) to approach 100%.",

This is not the place for detailed presentation of the technicalities of clinical-pharmacological proof. They are massively documented and widely agreed. Only when dealing with an individual medicine will one be able to decide precisely which clinical-experimental model and which degree of certainty will suffice if one is to conclude that this medicine is truly effective. Reasonable certainty that a drug is truly effective can only emerge from a complex of studies that have to be considered together; they complement each other and in some instances one may override another; in some situations particular studies may be superfluous, and in others additional work may be required. Table 4 .B provides no more than an ultrasummary, for the present purpose, of the elements of proof likely to be needed to satisfy those implementing current legislation and regulation that a drug is effective. . . . Studies sponsored by pharmaceutical companies were more likely to have outcomes favouring the sponsor than were studies with other sponsors (odds ratio 4.05; 95% confidence interval 2.98-5.51; 18 comparisons).

Among the many patient groups that suffer and die, only a few could make a stronger claim on our compassion than those who suffer and die from Alzheimer's. Or, to put it in simpler terms, NICE has forgotten that it is not enough to be effective, one also needs to be compassionate and nice. (Holm 2005) Compassion should indeed be an element both of medicine and of law.",

(FDA 1992) Prior to 2000, as later evidence showed, Warner-Lambert had failed to reveal what it knew about liver toxicity caused by Rezulin, which led to the drug's withdrawal from the market (Chernavsky 2005) From 1980 onwards, a number of companies had, as noted above, been less than open as regards the risks of their benzodiazepines (Medawar 1992, Revill 2004; see also sub-section 4.3.2. above). In 2004 it appeared that Merck had delayed by four years the release of its information on the cardiovascular effects of Vioxx (rofecoxib) (J\u00fcni et al. 2004, Horton 2004) In 2004 there was a public call on the FDA for a criminal investigation of AstraZeneca for allegedly delaying the submission of reports of serious reactions to Crestor (rosuvastatin) (HRG 2004) In 2004, again, the media reported that Lilly had long been aware of the potential of Prozac (fluoxetine) to precipitate suicide (CNN 2005).",
