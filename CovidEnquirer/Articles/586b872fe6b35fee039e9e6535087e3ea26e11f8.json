            "text": "The ruminant pestiviruses, bovine virus diarrhoea virus (BVDV) and border disease virus (BDV) are highly successful and important pathogens which infect ruminant species worldwide. Mthough the serological relationships among ruminant pestiviruses require further clarification, there is growing evidence for two antigenic groups, one of which predominates in cattle and one in sheep. The success of pestiviruses stems from the ability of the non-cytopathic (NCP) biotype of the virus to cross the placenta and establish a persistent infection (PI) in the developing foetus. This biotype should be regarded as the 'normal' biotype with the cytopathic (CP) biotype being an abnormal virus that is usually isolated only from PI animals dying fi-om mucosal disease. Recent molecular evidence points to CP viruses arising from their NCP counterparts by recombination events that include the insertion of host RNA and/or the duplication of viral RNA sequences. However, the biological mechanism through which CP viruses kill cells remains unknown. Virtually all CP and NCP viruses cause only mild, transient clinical symptoms in health), adult animals and stimulate a protective immune response. Despite the urgent requirement for a safe, effective vaccine, there is still no commercial vaccine that has been shown to immunize dams so that foetal infection is prevented. In the absence of an effective vaccine, reliable diagnostic techniques are essential to implement effective conu-ol measures. There is now a range of monoclonal antibody-based enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays for identifying PI or convalescent animals. These tests are specific, rapid, sensitive and reliable but may themselves become redundant as they are superceded by ever-increasing molecular biology-based techniques.

            "text": "Internationally, the threat to pig production by HCV represents the most serious pestivirus infection of domestic livestock. The virus is highly infectious and spreads rapidly, causing an acute systemic haemorrhagic disease with high morbidity and mortality. The impact of such disease requires prompt control and in many countries the disease has been eradicated by slaughter or controlled by vaccination (see review by Terpstra, 1991) . In conu'ast, the ruminant pestiviruses rarely cause such dramatic disease but nevertheless are important widespread pathogens in their natural hosts. The success of the ruminant pestiviruses is due to their ability to cross the placenta, invade the foetus and set up a persistent infection (PI) which continues into post-natal life. These PI animals excrete virus continuously and spread infection wherever they go; sometimes for years. This review will focus on the pivotal role of congenital infection with particular emphasis on recent molecular information which has allowed partial elucidation of how virus persistence is established, maintained and can lead ultimately to drarnatic disease in the virus carrier itself. Modern approaches to diagnosis and possible ways forward for the control of pestivirus infections will also be highlighted.",

These are designated non-cytopathic (NCP) or cytopathic (CP) depending on their effect on cultured cells. The NCP biotype is by far the most important and should be considered the genuine pestivirus. This biotype only has been reliably shown to cross the placenta; invade the foetus and set up the persistent infection so crucial for successful virus spread. NCP pestiviruses are the cause of a wide range of congenital, enteric and other diseases. By contrast, CP virus is usually associated only with lnUCosal disease (MD); a severe and invariably fatally disease now known to occur only in PI animals. Because animals dying of MD yield both CP and NCP viruses, so-called 'pairs' of biologically cloned CP and NCP viruses from a single animal have proved useful in elucidating the origin of CP biotypes. The CP virus appears to arise by mutation from NCP virus within the PI animals. Although they signify a 'dead-end' for the spread of virus, CP viruses have, until recently, attracted much more attention than NCP isolates because they are recovered from cases of dramatic disease and their growth in cell cultures is more easily detected and monitored.",

Of the three mature envelope glycoproteins (gp48, gp25, and gp53) two are involved in important host recognition functions.

A bovine mab against this protein has also shown neutralizing activity (Onisk et al., 1991) . The gp48 of BVDV also contains a neutralizing epitope (Xue et al., 1990) suggesting that it is also exposed on the surface of the virion. There is no such evidence, however, for gp25, which probably represents a transmembrane protein. The remaining 75% of the ORF represents the non-structural coding region. Only the first protein of this region, the p125 (p54/80), will be discussed here.

Insertion sequences have been found in the NADL and Osloss reference strains of BVDV (Meyers et al., 1990) . Both insertions were located in the area of the genome encoding the p54. The insertion sequence in the Osloss strain encoded a complete ubiquitin-like element, however that in NADL is almost identical to a bovine mRNA sequence. A nbiquitin-encoding insertion sequence was subsequently found in another CP BVDV isolate but not in its 'paired' NCP biotype, and it was proposed that recombination between viral and cellular RNA is responsible for the development of the CP virus (Meyers et aL, 1991) . However, not all CP isolates of B\",q)V and BDV have insertion sequences in the region encoding the p54 (De Moerlooze et al., 1990) . Further studies on four 'pairs' of CP and NCP BVD viruses have revealed that although viral gene duplications with cellular RNA insertions were present in three CP viruses no insertions or duplications were found in the fourth CP virus (Qi et al., 1992) . Of additional interest in this study was the observation that there was greater sequence homology between pairs than to the NADL stain, supporting the hypothesis that CP virus originates by mutation from NCP virus, thereby precipitating MD. In two other 'pairs' of CP and NCP BVD viruses, both CP viruses were distinguishable from their NCP partners only by duplication and rearrangements of two regions of their genomic RNAs (Meyers et al., 1992) . Thus there is evidence that the generation of CP BVDV is not restricted to recombination between cellular and viral sequences but can also be achieved by rearrangement of viral sequences.",

It is likely that yet further mechanisms remain to be elucidated since there are two reports in which the majority of CP pestiviruses examined had neither RNA insertions nor gene duplications in the p54 coding region (De Moerlooze et al., 1991; Greiser-Wilke et al., 1993) .

Discrimination among pestiviruses has been possible using polyclonal antisera in cross-neutralization tests and direct staining with mabs. Both methods readily distinguish HCV from the ruminant pestiviruses (Wensvoort et al., 1989; Edwards et al., 1991) .

Mild pyrexia, transient diarrhoea and increased nasal and ocular discharges may be observed for up to 2 weeks. Leucopaenia due to a decrease in both T and B lymphocytes is common and usually coincides with detectable viraemia 3-14 days post-infection. Recovery coincides with the first detection of serum antibody at 2-3 weeks after infection, and peak antibody levels occur 8-10 weeks later. It is generally accepted that animals with high serum antibody titres following acute infection are immune to reinfection, but antibody titres do decline indicating that immunity following natural infection may not be lifelong (Howard, 1990) . In addition to antibody there is a cellular component of the response to acute infection. It is known that peripheral blood leukocytes (PBL) recovered from acutely-infected cattle can be stimulated to proliferate in response to live BVDV (Larrson & Fossum, 1992) . The importance of the cellular response to BVDV has also been demonstrated by the in vivo depletion of T lymphocyte subsets in acutely infected gnotobiotic calves. The removal of CD4-positive cells but not CD8-positive cells resulted in prolonged viraemia and increased virus titres in the blood (Howard et al., 1992) . Other effects of pestiviruses on the immune system following acute infection are shown in Table I .",

The ovine foetus can first respond to an antigenic stimulus between approximately 60 and 80 days gestation. Before this time virus replication is uncontrolled and approximately 50% of all foetuses will be killed. Death may occur rapidly leading to resorption or the unnoticed abortion of small foetuses or may be delayed until months after infection when the subsequent abortion or stillbirths are obvious. In lambs that survive infection in early gestation, virus is widespread in virtually all organs, and there is no evidence of an), inflammatory reaction. The principal pathological findings are myelin deficiency in the CNS which accounts for the tremor and an increase in the number of primary hair follicles causing 'hairiness'. The low pathogenicity of some virus strains, however, means that some lambs can be born persistently infected with virus without showing any clinical signs and with only minimal pathological lesions (Bonniwell et al., 1987) . Pre-colostral blood samples from 'hairy-shaker' and other PI lambs contain readily detectable amounts of infectious virus. Such lambs are tolerant to the virus and have a persistent infection which continues long into post-natal life (Terpstra, 1985; Nettleton et al., 1992a) .",

Pestiviruses have been reported to affect cell proliferation and exper-imentally infected cells appear capable of producing soluble factors which affect immune function.",

First, it is more difficult to identify potential differences, in parameters such as cell proliferation between PI and control animals since the range in responses to mitogens or nominal antigens in outbred animals is highly variable. Second, die reagents to study ilnmune mechanisms in detail in ruminants have become available only recently. Third, different pestivirus isolates probably affect animals in different ways; and finally there is tim variation between individual PI animals, since every PI animal is unique in the degree of damage suffered by its vital organs during its intrauterine development.",

In contrast, the younger stock among which PI calves were widespread all seroconverted rapidly (Barber et al., 1985) . Studies of 19 Danish dairy herds have also demonstrated high antibody prevalence among groups of calves containing PI animals confirming rapid virus spread among such groups (Houe & Meyling, 1991) . There is little available information on the spread of BVDV in beef suckler herds, but virus spread appears to be efficient.

Infection before mid-gestation commonly results in foetal death leading to resorption, mummification or abortion which can pass unnoticed. Animals, therefore, present as repeat breeders the cause of which is notoriously difficult to establish. Paired serology on at least 10 animals can be helpful. Absence of pestivirus antibody conclusively excludes this agent as the cause, but presence of antibody requires careful interpretation. Evidence of seroconversion in several animals would be needed to confirm recent infection, whereas high antibody titres in virtually all sera would be suggestive of infection contributing to the disease under investigation. Foetal death rates due to pestivirus infection in early gestation vary among ruminant species. Goats appear most susceptible with deaths approaching 100% (Depner et al., 1991) . Sheep foetuses have approximately a 50% mortality rate (Nettleton et al., 1992a) , while approximately 30% of infected cattle foetuses die before birth (Brownlie, 1991) . The demonstration of pestiviruses from aborted or stillborn foetuses is difficult but can be attempted from thyroid, thymus, brain, spleen and kidney. Serum from heart blood or pleural, pericardial or peritoneal fluid should be tested for the presence of pestivirus antibody since its detection will confirm intrauterine infection later in gestation.

The captured antigen was then detected using a standard polyclonal anti-BDV oxdne serum. A similar assay has been published using the same capture mab but a bovine anti-BVDV serum for the detection of infected cattle (Fenton et al., 1991a) . Both ELISAs correlated well with the more protracted, labour intensive and expensive technique of conventional virus isolation. However, the risk associated with using a single mab to capture virus antigen is that if the epitope that is recognized by that mab is not present in any particular isolate then it will not be detected by the ELISA. Therefore, a modified ELISA has been developed that incorporates two pan-pestivirus mabs in the capture phase. Both mabs recognize different epitopes on the p125/p80, as determined by competitive binding studies. In addition, the polyclonal sera in the detection phase have been replaced with two directly conjugated mabs which recognize different epitopes on the p125/p80 from the capture mabs. This further standardizes the test by eliminating the use of polyclonal sera which are limited reagents and also has the advantage that the same test can be used for both cattle and sheep (Entrican et al., 1995) .",

The uhimate aim of these assays is to have a diagnostic test which is rapid, sensitive and reliable. The advantage of mabs over polyclonal sera is the specificity which they confer and their unlimited availability. However, loss of the epitope recognized by the mab will l'esult in failure to detect the virus. Incorporation of more than one mab greatly reduces this possibility. One potential drawback of these ELISAs and of the previous virus isolation technique comes in the identification of young PI animals. The presence of colostral antibody to pestiviruses has long been known to be a problem in conventional virus isolation techniques. However, this may also be a problem for detection of antigen by ELISA. Shannon et al. (1992) have reported that PI calves which tested negative for BVDV antigen by ELISA in the first few weeks of life, subsequently tested positive when retested at 8-15 weeks of age. It is not yet clear if this is due to the antibody inhibiting ~4rus replication in vivo thereby resulting in low virus antigen yields during extraction or due to residual serum antibody directly masking antigen in the ELISA.",

Instead of coating plates with antigen, plates were coated with a pan-pestivirus mab which then specifically captured the p 125/p80 from detergent extracts of tissue cuhure-gown infected cells. Antibodies in test sera then reacted specifically with the capture p125/p80, thereby eliminating high background staining. This ELISA gave a poor quantitative correlation with SNT but there was a good qualitative agreement between the two tests. This is most probably due to the fact that the ELISA measures antibodies to non-structural proteins whereas the SNT measures neutralizing antibodies to structural virus components. This raises the question of reliability of any particular test. The p125/p80 would appear to be the protein of choice for developing a diagnostic pestivirus antibody ELISA, due to its highly conse~-ved nature. The choice of isolate used to prepare the test antigen is also important. Another critical factor is the length of time which antibody can be detected in serum following infection. Antibody titres to the p80 and also to neutralizing epitopes have been found to persist in some calves held in controlled conditions for up to 3 years following experimental infection (Paton et al., 1991a) .",

However, correlation with existing virus isolation techniques can prove difficult, as in cases of acute infection where serum antibody can mask the presence of virus. Dot blot hybridization has also been used to detect pestivirus RNA in infected cells. Its potential advantages as a diagnostic tool are that many samples can be run simultaneously and that RNA does not need to be purified from the cells. Critical factors for success are the selection of the correct probes and conditions for hybridization. Lewis et al. (1991) showed that under certain conditions a single base mismatch for any of six 20-base probes examined would prevent hybridization. Less stringent conditions resulted in hybridization but this obse~wation illustrates the potential problem of failure to detect certain isolates due to sequence variation in the genome. A cocktail of probes hybridizing to different areas of the genome may overcome tiffs. A dot blot comparison of four probes hybridizing to different areas of the genome of BVDV was performed by Kwang et al. (1991) . They found that a probe hybridizing to the p80 region of the genome was the most successfnl at detecting a number of CP and NCP isolates, highlighting the need for probes to highly conselwed sequences to ensure success. More recently, probes fi'om the 5'-untranslated region have been shown to be useful for the rapid detection of rmninant pestiviruses from cell culture samples by dot blot hybridization (Qi et al., 1993) . In situ hybridization has been performed on cells from infected sheep using a probe to the p80 region, but this technique is laborious and while it has great potential as a research tool it has limited use for diagnosis (Entrican et aL, 1991) .",

Computer comparison of the five pestiviruses whose genome sequences are now known identif T conserved regions notably in the 5' and 3' non-coding regions and the region coding for the p125/p80 non-structural protein. The accumulated data suggest that the 5' non-coding part of the pestivirus genome, which probably contains sequence elements important for replication, is the most useful region from which to select PCR primers that detect the maximum number of isolates. Ridpath et al. (1993) used primers from this region which amplified all bovine isolates tested but only a minority of porcine and ovine isolates. Wirz et al. (1993) also selected primers from the 5' region which amplified all 57 pestivirus isolates tested but their primers gave a product of only 72-74 bp which is relatively hard to detect. More recently, primers have been identified in this region, which amplified a 288 bp product from all 129 pestiviruses tested (Vilcek et al., 1994) . If such apparent 'universal' primers are shown to detect all pestiviruses they could play an important role in the development of future diagnostic tests.",

Aanong closed cattle herds, many have a high rate of BVDV seroprevalence without experiencing any apparent associated disease. Very often the first reported evidence of disease due to pestivirus is a case or cases of mucosal disease. Cases of MD can occur at any age but occur only in cattle that have been PI since early intrauterine infection. The source of the infection can often be traced back to a change of husbandry, usually with the introduction of PI cattle, around that time.

Modified live virus, temperature sensitive mutant virus and killed virus vaccines have all been developed for the control of pestivirus infections in cattle. Several are licensed for use in the United States and most countries in Europe but none has yet been licensed for use in the United Kingdom. The MLV vaccines raise concern over their safety because they may be immunosuppressive, can induce postvaccinal disease resembling MD, and cross the placenta to cause foetal disease. Although killed BVDV vaccines are safe, they fail to stimulate sufficient immunity to prevent transplacental infection (Bolin, 1990) . There have, however, been reports of foetal protection in sheep using killed pestivirus vaccines. Vantsis et al. (1980) achieved approximately 50% protection of foetuses born to ewes receiving two doses of formalin inactivated, concentrated BD virus in Freund's adjuvant, while Carllson et al. (1991) achieved 86% foetal protection when ewes were vaccinated with an affinity-purified BVDV-ISCOM preparation. In both these trials ewes were infected parenterally with challenge virus. More realistic challenge systems using intranasal delivery or exposure to PI carriers have been suggested. Another important consideration in vaccine development is whether or not single strains of pestivirus are capable of inducing sufficient immunity against the antigenic spectrum of wild-type pestMruses. Available evidence suggests that effective cattle vac-cines could be produced from a single strain whereas sheep vaccines for the conu'ol of BD will have to contain at least two strains of pestivirus; one antigenically similar to the majority of BDV isolates and the other similar to the antigenically distinguishable viruses that have been recovered from sheep but that are more closely related to BVDV isolates fi'om cattle.",
