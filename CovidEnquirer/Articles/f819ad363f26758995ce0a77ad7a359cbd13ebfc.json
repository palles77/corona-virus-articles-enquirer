The young female fossa undergoes a period of masculination during when the animal has an elongated clitoris, which contains an os clitoris, and may have scrotumlike swellings. The os penis disappears at maturity. A notable anatomic feature of the viverids is their enlarged perianal scent glands. These glands vary in size and complexity among the species. The glands' secretions are used to mark territories and may also be used as a defense. The perianal glandular secretion from the genera Civetticitis, Viverra, and Viveriricula is known as \"civet\" and is used in the manufacture of perfume and medicines.",

In captivity, red pandas are typically fed a mixture of commercial \"primate\" biscuits, fruits, vegetables, and bamboo. If at all possible, bamboo should make at least 50% of the diet.

The disease is best described in raccoons, and epizootics of canine distemper regularly occur in wild North American populations. Distemper has also been reported in coatimundis, kinkajous, red pandas, palm civets, and binturongs. 3, 35, 37 Vaccine-induced canine distemper has been seen in kinkajous and red pandas vaccinated with modifiedlive virus domestic dog distemper vaccines. 2, 18 Clinical signs in raccoons resemble those seen in domestic dogs but commonly include diarrhea in addition to upper respiratory signs. Hyperkeratosis of foot pads (\"hard pad\") is also a typical sign. Canine distemper in raccoons seems to progress to central nervous system (CNS) disease more rapidly than in domestic dogs. This is important, as distemper-induced neurologic signs in raccoons are indistinguishable from signs of rabies, and rabies may only be ruled out after death. Wild raccoons may act as vectors for both distemper and rabies to susceptible captive animals such as red pandas. Pathologic lesions of distemper in raccoons are similar to those seen in distemper-infected dogs. On the other hand, masked palm civets with canine distemper showed neurologic lesions but no GI lesions. 35 Rabies is endemic in the wild raccoon population in eastern United States. The disease was disseminated by relocation of raccoons from southern United States to the upper Atlantic seaboard states for hunting, and the range extended rapidly.

            "text": "Parvovirus infections have also been recognized in raccoons and many viverids, but the taxonomy of the etiologic agents has been the subject of some debate. Early raccoon cases were thought to be caused by feline parvovirus (feline panleukopenia virus) or \"raccoon parvovirus.\" 37 However, recent outbreaks in wild raccoons in southeastern United States have been caused by canine parvovirus 2. 1 Morbidity was largely restricted to juveniles and neonates, and mortality was high. Serologic evidence of parvovirus infections has been observed in red pandas, but clinical disease has not been described in this species. Feline parvovirus has caused deaths in Asian palm civets. 6 Several viral diseases of viverids have caused more limited outbreaks. Recently, pandemic flu (H1N1) caused clinical disease in a binturong. 34 An outbreak of cowpox virus in captive banded mongoose showed high morbidity (100%) and mortality (30%), and the virus was later transmitted to humans. 22 Masked palm civets (Paguma larvata) were found to be serologically positive for the coronavirus that caused severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in people and were implicated as the source of the infection in humans. Experimental infection of palm civets resulted in clinical disease, suggesting that civets were not natural reservoirs for this agent. Subsequent investigations have shown that fruit bats are the natural reservoirs for this agent. 24 In young red pandas, dermatophytosis is an important disease. 19 The disease is uniformly caused by Microsporum gypseum and of 31). No thyroid pathology was found at necropsy of feral raccoons captured in the same region of the captive animals. The feral animals were, however, considerably younger than the captive animals examined. One North American raccoon with thyroid carcinoma was obese and had a palpable cervical mass when examined. 27 The animal' s total thyroxin (TT4) concentrations were within domestic carnivore reference intervals; thus this neoplasm was considered nonfunctional and similar to the thyroid carcinomas seen in domestic dogs. Another captive North American raccoon was obese, and a cystic thyroid gland was discovered during an attempt at jugular venipuncture. This animal had an increased TT4 concentration, and an excisional thyroid biopsy revealed adenomatous hyperplasia. The thyroid disease in this animal closely resembled that seen in older domestic cats. This animal' s hyperthyroidism remained even after surgery and was successfully managed for years with a topical methimazole gel. 27 Numerous neoplasms have been described in procyonids and viverids (Table 49-6), but as noted above, thyroid neoplasms in raccoons are notable. A large number of nasal carcinomas described in procyonids and genets are all from a group of animals housed in the same building at the Philadelphia Zoo and was, no doubt, likely the result of an environmental issue. 25",

Animals seem to have partial seasonal sheds or patchy hair coats, with hair loss usually starting in the caudal half of the body and extending to the tail. Dermatophytes have not been found in these animals. Hypothyroidism has been reported in one red panda, but thyroid hormone concentrations in most of these animals are within the reference intervals for domestic dogs and cats. In the majority of these cases, the problem seems to be seasonal and requires no treatment.Osteoarthritis is commonly seen in older procyonids, and chronic renal disease is frequently observed in aged red pandas. Hypertrophic cardiac disease has been reported in kinkajous and binturong. 8, 14 Pancreatitis and trichobezoars have been observed in meerkats.Thyroid pathology has been reported at an unusual frequency in raccoons. 38 Early reports were from captive animals from Germany, but a recent report is of captive animals in North America. 27 One European study identified 77.5% of the raccoons necropsied as having thyroid lesions, almost half of which (15 of 31) were thyroid adenocarcinomas. 38 Other thyroid lesions included follicular hyperplasia (7 of 31), follicular adenomas (4 of 31), and colloid goiters (4",
