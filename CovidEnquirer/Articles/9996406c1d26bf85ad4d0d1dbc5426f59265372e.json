            "text": "Formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) belong to the classical G protein-coupled chemoattractant receptor family. They are mainly expressed in mammalian phagocytic leukocytes and play important roles in inflammatory and immune responses. N-formyl peptides produced by Gram-negative bacteria were among the first chemotactic factors identified for two FPRs in human beings: FPR1 (originally termed FPR) and FPR2 (originally termed FPRL1). During the past few years, a variety of novel pathogen-and host-derived agonists as well as antagonists for the FPR family have been identified, indicating a broader spectrum of the biological significance of these receptors. Activation of FPRs in leukocytes by agonists induces cell chemotaxis, phagocytosis, release of proinflammatory mediators and gene transcription. Despite these new developments, the in vivo functions of FPRs and their ligands in disease states are not yet fully understood.

            "text": "Inflammation is essentially a protective attempt by the organisms to remove the injurious stimuli and to initiate the healing process. The migration of leukocytes is crucial in the progression and resolution of inflammation and is tightly regulated. Leukocytes accumulate at the sites of inflammation by responding to pathogen-and host-derived chemotactic factors named chemoattractants. Numerous chemoattractants have been described including chemokines, activated complement fragments, lipid mediators, and pathogen-derived molecules. 32 Most chemoattractants use G protein-coupled receptors (GPCRs) classified as GPCRs for chemokines and for classical chemoattractants. Formyl peptide receptors (FPRs) belong to the family of classical GPCRs. These receptors are named based on their capacity to recognize the N-formyl methionine motif in synthetic neutrophil chemotactic peptides and in peptide fragments released into the culture supernatants by Escherichia coli. 32 The FPR family members are coupled to pertussis toxin (PTX)-sensitive Gi proteins and mediate neutrophil and monocyte chemotaxis and activation. 11 Although FPRs were identified and cloned in the early 1990s, 19 the biological function of these receptors remains poorly understood. However, with the identification of a number of novel nonformylated and host-derived agonists for FPRs, it is becoming evident that these receptors and their peptide ligands play important roles in innate and adaptive immune responses.",

            "text": "The prototype human FPR was cloned from differentiated HL-60 myeloid leukemia cells. 32 Two additional human FPRs were subsequently cloned and were named as FPR like-1 (FPRL1) and FPRL2. Recently, these GPCRs were renamed as FPR1, FPR2/ALX (FPRL1), and FPR3 (FPRL2). FPR1 and FPR2 share 69% identity at the amino acid level, whereas FPR3 has 56% amino acid sequence identity to human FPR1 and 83% to FPR2. 32 Both human FPR1 and FPR2 are expressed in many cell types, such as myeloid cells including monocytes/macrophages, neutrophils and immature dendritic cells (DCs), endothelial cells, hepatocytes, astrocytes, microglial cells, and fibroblasts. 32 The expression of human FPR3 is more restricted and is detected in monocytes/macrophages and DCs but not in neutrophils. 32 FPR3 is also expressed in plasmacytoid DCs and is upregulated on cell maturation. 10 The signal transduction pathways of FPRs have been more extensively studied with FPR1 in phagocytic cells and in cell lines transfected with cloned receptor. The interaction of FPR1 with its agonist peptide fMLF uncouples trimeric G proteins to elicit a signaling cascade that activates phospholipase C (PLC), protein kinase C (PKC) and PI3 kinases (PI3Ks), which are translated into biological functions of receptor-bearing cells including chemotaxis and mediator release. FPR1 and FPR2 also crosstalk with some receptor tyrosine kinases, such as nerve growth factor (NGF) receptor TrkA and the epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR). 12, 15 In the mouse FPR gene family, there are at least eight members, Fpr1 and Fpr-rs1 to Fpr-rs7. 32 Fpr1 encodes mFPR1, which is the ortholog of human FPR1 and binds fMLF with a relatively high affinity, whereas both Fpr-rs1 and Fpr-rs2 encode receptors most similar to human FPR2. 32 The gene product of mouse Fpr-rs2, mFPR2, is a low-affinity receptor for fMLF. 19 The biological functions of other six mouse Fpr gene homologs have not been characterized. 32 The high sequence divergence between species orthologs (\u223c25-30% between human and mouse) indicates the complicated evolution of the FPR gene family. 32 In vivo, mFPR1-KO mice were more susceptible to infection by Listeria monocytogenes, indicating the role of FPR1 in antibacterial defense. 32 More recently, FPR1 (mFPR1) was shown to mediate trauma reaction in severe inflammatory response syndrome 34 and neutrophil accumulation in the necrotic center of the liver injury, presumably by responding to N-formylated mitochondrial peptides released by ruptured cells. 24 mFPR2-KO mice have also been generated recently and show diminished allergic airway inflammation and accompanying immune responses. 2 FPR2 (mFPR2) expressed in human and mouse neutrophils interacts with an acute-phase protein serum amyloid A (SAA) produced by liver and also by melanoma cells to promote the release of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10, which increases the interaction of neutrophils with invariant natural killer (NK) T cells. These NKT cells limit the immunosuppressive activity of neutrophils by decreasing IL-10, but increasing IL-12 production, thereby enhancing the anti-melanoma host responses. 8 These new developments highlight the critical function of FPR1 and FPR2 in innate and adaptive host responses.",

The chemotactic activity of fMLF for neutrophils is increased by an oligoethylene glycol substituent. 16 In addition to its chemotactic activity for myeloid cells, fMLF also induces intestinal epithelial cell migration and participates in epithelial restitution and wound closure. 32 The activity of fMLF on intestinal epithelial cells is attributed to FPR1, which is located along actin filaments in lamellipodial and filopodial extrusions associated with activated PI3K, Rac1, and Cdc42. 32 In human mesenchymal stem cells, fMLF stimulates signaling pathways coupled to FPR1 that drive phospholipase C (PLC)/phospholipase D (PLD)-Ca 2+ -calmodulin-dependent kinase II-ERK-CREB during osteogenic differentiation. By contrast, fMLF inhibits the expression of PPAR\u03b31 and suppresses adipocytic commitment during differentiation. 28 Thus, FPR1 and its agonist fMLF also display important functions in nonhematopoietic cells. In addition to fMLF, there are other N-formyl peptides derived from bacteria. For example, a pentapeptide fMIVIL from L. monocytogenes and a tetrapeptide fMIFL from Staphylococcus aureus preferentially activate mFPR1. 32 fMFEDAVAWF derived from Mycobacterium avium also activates FPR1. 32 Although formylated peptides are believed to be mainly of bacterial origin, three hexapeptides fMLKLIV, fMMY-ALF, and fMFADRW corresponding to the N terminus of mitochondrial NADH dehydrogenase subunits 4 and 6 and cytochrome c oxidase subunit I 32 are also potent chemotactic agonists for FPR1 and FPR2. Other mitochondrial N-formyl peptides (e.g. mitochondrial transcription factor A (TFAM) released during cell necrosis) also activate monocytes to release IL-8 (CXCL8), a neutrophil specific chemokine. 4 Mitochondria are considered to be evolutionary endosymbionts derived from bacteria and may thus contain bacterial molecular motifs. On cell injury, mitochondrial \"damage\"-associated molecular patterns (DAMPs) are released into the circulation and elicit neutrophil-mediated organ injury. The effect of mitochondrial DAMPs (MTDs) containing formyl peptides on neutrophils is mediated by FPR1, while mitochondrial DNA in MTDs activates Tolllike receptor (TLR) 9. 34 Some functional \"cryptic\" peptides hidden in protein structures are termed \"cryptides,\" one of which, mitocryptide-2 (MCT-2) in mitochondrial cytochrome b, was a specific agonist for FPR2 and may play a role in inflammatory host responses. 27 ",

N36 from gp41, which partially overlaps with T21/DP107, solely signals through FPR2. 32 Two peptide domains in HIV-1 gp120 are potent chemoattractants and activators for FPR2, but not for FPR1, in human phagocytic leukocytes. 3 One peptide domain, F peptide, consists of 20-amino acid residues and is located in the C4-V4 region of gp120 of the HIV-1 LAI strain. Another peptide of 33 amino acids (V3 peptide) is derived from a linear sequence of the V3 region of the HIV-1 MN strain. 3 However, despite the existence of peptide domains in HIV-1 envelope proteins that interact with FPRs, it remains unclear whether such domains are released by enzymatic cleavage of the envelope proteins in vivo during HIV-1 infection.",

In synovial tissues of patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA), highly expressed SAA promotes the proliferation of human fibroblast-like synoviocytes (FLS) and induces the expression of matrix metalloproteinases by FLS. 32 SAA also protects RA FLS from apoptotic death induced by serum starvation, anti-Fas IgM, and sodium nitroprusside 32 by interacting with FPR2. In addition, SAA stimulates CCL-2 production via FPR2 by human umbilical vein endothelial cells and monocytes contributing to the progression of atherosclerosis. 21, 22 SAA also stimulates M-CSF and CCL-2 expression in human and mouse hepatocellular carcinoma cells. 23 SAA may interact with other receptors; the nucleotide receptor P2X7 was reported to mediate the protective role of SAA in human neutrophil apoptosis. 1 A\u03b2 42 is a 42-amino acid cleavage product of the amyloid precursor protein in the brain and a pathogenic factor for Alzheimer's disease (AD). 19 FPR2 mediates the migration and activation of monocytic phagocytes, including macrophages and brain microglia, induced by A\u03b2 42 . FPR2 also promotes the endocytosis of A\u03b2 42 by macrophages and microglia in the form of receptor and ligand complexes. If the exposure of macrophages to A\u03b2 42 is transient, the internalized A\u03b2 42 is degraded and FPR2 is rapidly recycled back to the cell surface. However, prolonged exposure results in accumulation of A\u03b2 42 and FPR2 complexes in macrophages, which culminates in progressive fibrillary aggregation of A\u03b2 42 and the macrophage death. 3 These observations suggest that FPR2 not only mediates the proinflammatory activity of A\u03b2 42 but it may also play an important role in the fibrillary deposition of A\u03b2 42 , a typical pathologic feature of AD. 3 PrP 106-126 is a prion protein fragment that is produced in human brains with prion disease. 19 PrP 106-126 induces the migration and activation of human myeloid cells through FPR2 and may thus contribute to the inflammatory responses seen in the prion disease.",

Thus, uPAR may facilitate fibrinolysis and serve as a source of chemotactic proinflammatory peptides necessary for host defense. SRSRY, a peptide corresponding to residues 88-92 in uPAR is an agonist of FPR1. 32 In addition, uPAR 84-95 induces basophil migration by interacting with both FPR2 and FPR3 and mobilizes hematopoietic stem cells by activating FPR1 by desensitizing the chemokine receptor CXCR4. 32 FPRs interact with some bactericidal peptides contained in human neutrophil granules. LL37, an enzymatic cleavage fragment of neutrophil granule protein cathelicidin and its mouse homolog CRAMP (see the Cathelicin Chapters in Bacterial/Antibiotic Peptides section of this book), activate FPR2 to promote myeloid cell chemotaxis. 32 LL-37 also induces angiogenesis via FPR2 expressed on endothelial cells. In CRAMP-deficient mice, neovascularization is decreased during cutaneous wound repair. 32 Another antibacterial neutrophil granule protein, cathepsin G, is a serine protease (see the Peptide Biosynthesis/Processing section of this book) and a specific agonist for FPR1. 32 It is therefore conceivable that the capacity of antimicrobial neutrophil granule peptides to interact with FPRs may aid in the recruitment of phagocytic leukocytes to the sites of infection and thus accelerate the killing and clearance of the invading bacteria.",

Anx A1, also named lipocortin I, is a glucocorticoid-regulated, phosphorylated-binding protein possessing both proinflammatory and anti-inflammatory activity mediated in part by FPR1. Expressed in a variety of cell types, Anx A1 is particularly abundant in neutrophils where it is located on the outer cell surface and serves to inhibit neutrophil transendothelial migration. At low concentrations, Anx A1 and its N-terminal peptides (Ac2-26 and Ac9-25) elicit Ca 2+ transients through FPR1 to desensitize neutrophils and inhibit its transendothelial migration induced by the chemokine IL-8 (CXCL8). 32 At high concentrations, the Anx A1 peptides activate neutrophils as potent proinflammatory stimulants. The antimigratory activity of exogenous and endogenous Anx A1 has been shown in both acute and chronic models of inflammation. More recent studies revealed that Anx A1 peptides may also use FPR2 and, to a lesser extent, FPR3, suggesting a complex role for FPRs in Anx A1-mediated regulation of host responses. In addition to neutrophils, Anx A1 also regulates T cell receptor 30 signaling. Stimulation of T cells via TCR leads to the secretion of endogenous Anx A1 and a simultaneous externalization of its receptor FPR2 on the plasma membrane, highlighting a \"coordinated\" signaling of \"Anx A1 -FPR\" system. 5 In the presence of Anx A1, naive T cells differentiate toward Th1 cells, whereas Anx-A1-deficient T cells produce high levels of Th2 cytokines. 5, 7 Also, in Anx A1-deficient T cells, the production of IL-17 as well as FPR2 signaling is impaired during differentiation in Th17skewing conditions. 6 In addition, tumor growth and metastasis are markedly decreased in Anx A1-KO mice, whereas the survival and tumor necrosis are significantly increased, due to impaired angiogenesis. 33 These observations demonstrate a complex role of Anx A1 and FPR2 in multiple pathophysiological processes.",

It was subsequently found that WKYMVm uses both FPR1 and FPR2, and is by far the most potent peptide agonist for FPR2 to chemoattract and activate human phagocytic cells. 32 The WKYMVm analog, produced by converting the D-amino acid methionine at the C-terminus into to an L-amino acid, becomes a more selective agonist of FPR2 and also a weaker activator of FPR3. 3 Another peptide, MMK-1, which is also derived from a random peptide library, is a potent and very selective chemotactic agonist for FPR2.

            "text": "LXA4, biosynthesized from arachidonic acid metabolism, is the first described endogenous lipid ligand for FPR2. However, despite the original observation of LXA4 being a chemotactic agonist for FPR2, this lipid metabolite has been shown to mainly exert inhibitory activities on a variety of inflammatory responses. LXA4 inhibits the production of inflammatory cytokines by epithelial cell lines in response to TNF\u03b1 and LPS, while it simulates the expression of the anti-inflammatory cytokine IL-10. 32 In DCs, LXA4/ATL activates the suppressor of cytokine signaling (SOCS)-2 and in T cells, LXA4 attenuates TNF\u03b1 release by impairing ERK signaling. 32 LXA4 also prevents renal fibrosis by inhibiting PDGF-induced TGF-\u03b2 production in mesangial cells. 32 In addition, LXA4 attenuates inflammation-induced pain and displays proresolution properties in various disease models, including dermal inflammation, ischemia/reperfusion injury, peritonitis, colitis, cystic fibrosis, asthma, parasitic infection and glomerulonephritis. 32 The multiplicity of the anti-inflammatory activity of LXA4 raises the question of how this lipid mediator shares FPR2 with other peptide agonists that trigger a proinflammatory signaling pathway. One plausible explanation was that LXA4 binds to an FPR2 domain, which is different from the domains utilized by peptide agonists. However, because LXA4 has been reported to interact with multiple receptors depending on the cell types, it remains to be clarified whether the biological function of LXA4 is the consequence of interaction with more than one receptor.",

            "text": "In this chapter, we attempted to provide a comprehensive overview of FPR ligands including agonists and antagonists. It is now clear that FPRs play important roles in the regulation of inflammatory and immune responses. The process of understanding of the biological roles of FPRs has been considerably prompted by the identification of a variety of ligands from different sources, in particular, from microbes and human. In addition to the evidence that the FPRs are involved in antimicrobial defense and inflammation, they are also implicated in the progression of cancer. For example, FPR1 is selectively expressed by highly malignant human glioma cells and increases the motility, growth, and angiogenesis of human glioblastoma by interacting with host-derived agonist(s) released by necrotic tumor cells. 35 An effort to identify potential FPR1 agonist(s) in glioma cell supernatant revealed Anx A1 as a major component. 31 Therefore, FPR1 and Anx A1 axis may constitute targets for novel antiglioma therapy. Human FPR2 is also expressed in astrocytoma cell line, 9 hepatocellar carcinoma, 23 and breast cancer 17 with yet unclear pathophysiological implications. It is intriguing that FPR1 and FPR2 exhibit a promiscuity to interact with a broad range of ligands that do not share significant primary or tertiary structure similarities. How a single FPR could bind such a diverse array of ligands, from small peptides to nonpeptide compounds, remains to be elucidated, possibly through classical receptor chimera approaches and site-directed mutagenesis. Further investigation should not only benefit better understanding of the role of FPRs and their ligands in disease states but also the identification of pharmacological targets for the development of therapeutic agents.",
