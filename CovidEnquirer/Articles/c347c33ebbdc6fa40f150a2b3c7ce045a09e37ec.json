Other permissive cell lines differed according to the treatment period and drug level required for restricting productive infections. The inhibitory effect of indomethacin was progressively reduced if infection of cells was delayed for increasing times after drug removal. Strong inhibition of viral replication also occurred in cells treated with the cyclooxygenase antagonists naproxen, phenylbutazone, and oxyphenylbutazone whereas phenacetin, which does not block cyclooxygenase function, was inactive. Enhanced viral replication occurred in indomethacin-treated HEp-2 cultures when these cells were subsequently exposed to such substances as prostaglandin El, cyclic AMP, or insulin. Conversely, indomethacin-treated cells remained restrictive for VSV if they were subsequently exposed to metabolic inhibitors of functional DNA (actinomycin D or mitomycin C), messenger RNA synthesis (cu-amanitin), or protein synthesis (cycloheximide) at concentrations that normally do not compromise viral replication. Pretreatment of HEp-2 cells with mitomycin C markedly shifted the dose response for indomethacin-mediated inhibition of VSV from a 90% inhibitory dose of about 10e4 M to one of lo-' M or lower. These findings suggest that preexisting host factors essential for replication of WV, although rendered nonfunctional by the drug indomethacin, can be replenished unless their synthesis is blocked by various classes of metabolic inhibitors.",

BHK-21 cells, which produce relatively high yields of infectious VSV particles , were found to be more refractory to the action of indomethacin than other cell lines tested. This property is illustrated in Table 3 where it is seen that a 2-day drug treatment period was required to reduce subsequent yields of VSV in BHK-21 cells by 99% or greater.

Since indomethacin is one of a series of nonsteroidal drugs known for their ability to compromise conversion of arachadonic acid into cyclic endoperoxides (McGiff, 1981) , it was of natural interest to test additional drugs of this class for possible inhibitory effects against VSV in permissive cells.

The first seven substances listed in Table 5 lication in cells rendered nonpermissive by indomethacin, in which case metabolites such as PGEl and CAMP increased virus yields about 150-fold. The substances present in normal serum having this stimulatory effect were not identified although a nonspecific drug-binding effect of serum proteins cannot be excluded. The compounds sodium buyrate, sodium fluoride, and GTP greatly intensified the inhibitory effect of indomethacin resulting in a total block of viral growth. It is likely that such combined treatment causes a general metabolic debilitation of cells rendering them nonpermissive.",

The finding that certain prostaglandins, cyclic nucleotides, or modulators of these effector molecules could enhance the recovery of indomethacin-inhibited cells prompted us to study the kinetics of this process under various conditions. Figure 2 illustrates that the progressive increase of virus yields from cells infected at different times after a HEp-2 cells (2 X ld cell&O-mm plate) were pretreated with lo-* indomethacin in RMEM (2% NCS) for 24 hr at 37' after which they were infected with VSV (m.o.i. = 10). All cultures were washed with BSS after virus adsorption and incubated for 24 hr at 37\" with RMEM containing the substances listed above at the concentrations indicated per milliliter of medium.

All cultures were incubated for 24 hr at 37\" after infection and the virus content of cell lysates obtained by freezingthawing was measured by plaque assay in BHK-21 cells. The histogram shows virus yields for the different infection groups following post indomethacin incubation with unsupplemented medium (broken bars), medium with CAMP (open bars), and medium with actinomycin D (solid bars). The virus yield from infected control cultures that were not exposed to indomethacin or other drugs was 7.8 X 108 PFU/ml (arrow). removal of indomethacin is accelerated by CAMP and repressed by low concentrations of actinomycin D. Since the biosynthesis of VSV is not normally inhibited by even higher amounts of actinomycin D, we conclude that the drug effect observed was directed against cellular DNA-dependent RNA synthesis needed for restoration of the viral permissive state. Other inhibitors of functional DNA such as mitomycin C can also block reversal of the indomethacin effect (data not shown).",

Table 6 shows that cycloheximide strongly blocked the reversal of indomethacin inhibition over a 24-hr incubation period based on virus yields that were only 1% of the control. Our use of low concentrations of cycloheximide to obtain this differential effect was suggested by the earlier observation of Cho and Rhim (1979) that such low drug levels can reverse the phenotype of virus-transformed cells without impairing either cell growth or total protein synthesis. It was also found that a-amanitin, a potent inhibitor of RNA polymerase II, partially blocked the recovery of HEp-2 cells from indomethacin inhibition (Table 6 ). At the concentration used, cu-amanitin inhibits the activity of RNA polymerase II in the synthesis of eukaryotic mRNA species but does not impair replication of VSV (Evans and Simpson, 1979) .",

Accordingly, we used mitomycin C since this drug can effectively block DNA function at low concentrations without inhibiting growth of VSV (data not shown). Sequential treatment of cells first with mitomycin C (0.1 pg/ml) for 48 hr and thereafter with indomethacin over the dose range of low3 to lo-l2 M for 24 hr, respectively, markedly increased the indomethacin sensitivity of viral replication (Fig. 3) . With this dual treatment regimen, the 90% viral inhibitory dose for indomethacin was shifted from about 10T4 to lo-' M or lower. This pronounced alteration of the dose response for indomethacin inhibition of VSV in per- ' HEp-2 monolayers were incubated at 37' for 24 hr with fresh RMEM (2% NCS) containing or lacking 10m3 M indomethacin. After this pretreatment, the cultures were washed with BSS and infected with VSV (m.o.i. = 10) either immediately (0 hr) or after further incubation at 37' for 6 or 24 hr with either regular RMEM or medium containing cycloheximide (0.1 pg/ml) or cY-amanitin (10 pg/ml). The cultures infected at 0 hr were treated with these drugs during the postinfection incubation period (24 hr at 37'9, whereas cultures from the other groups received unsupplemented serum-free medium after infection.

In this experiment, the total treatment time with indomethacin was 24 hr, whereas the minimum and maximum period that cells were exposed to mitomycin C was 6 and 48 hr, respectively.

Protein kinase activity in vitro is also blocked by these high drug levels (Goueli and Ahmed, 1980) whereas much lower concentrations of indomethacin are also inhibitory for several other enzyme systems including phosphodiesterase (Flower and Vane, 1974) , presumably owing to the affinity of this anti-inflammatory drug for lipophilic peptide sequences (Humes et a& 1981) . Although multiple targets apparently exist for indomethacin, some of the findings obtained in this study suggest that the inhibition of VSV by this drug involves one or more elements of the prostaglandin biosynthetic pathway. First, other potent antagonists of fatty acid cyclooxygenase such as phenylbutazone exert a strong antiviral effect in our test system whereas phenacetin, an anti-inflammatory drug not active against cyclooxygenase, was inactive in suppressing VSV infections (Table 4) . Second, exogenous addition of PGEi or CAMP to infected cells following indomethacin treatment can substantially reduce the inhibitory effect of this drug, suggesting that the metabolic block imposed can be bypassed in this manner. The recovery of the permissive state for viral replication following removal of indomethacin is also significantly accelerated by such physiological effecters and both CAMP and serum are known to stimulate prostaglandin biosynthesis in cultured mammalian cells (Samuelsson et aL, 1978) . Substances such as theophyllin or isoproterenol which increase intracellular CAMP levels were also found to counteract the inhibitory effect of indomethacin seen in this study.

            "text": "Various metabolic inhibitors of cellular macromolecular synthesis were shown to modify both the sensitivity of cultured cells to inhibition by indomethacin and the recovery of these cells after drug treatment based on their permissiveness for viral replication. The ability of relatively low concentrations of actinomycin D to retard the progressive reversal of indomethacin inhibition in HEp-2 cells suggests that active cellular transcription is required for replacement of labile host factors that are compromised by indomethacin treatment. Further support of this concept comes from the finding that a-amanitin, the inhibitor of RNA polymerase II, exerts a similar effect on the recovery of indomethacin-inhibited cells. Since both actinomycin D and a-amanitin do not normally impair VSV biosynthesis, the effects obtained with these drugs indicate that active cellular transcription is an important event in the recovery of cells from indomethacin inhibition. The protein synthesis inhibitor, cycloheximide, at low concentrations that do not adversely affect VSV replication also strongly interferes with restoration of the viral permissive state after treatment of cells with indomethacin. Cycloheximide and actinomycin D may prevent reversal of the indomethacin effect by directly interfering with prostaglandin biosynthesis since Pong et al. (1977) have shown that these drugs block release of membranebound archadonate as a substrate for cyclooxygenase.",

Indomethacin at lo-' M concentration becomes inhibitory for viral replication in HEp-2 cells or HeLa cells under appropriate conditions of treatment with mitomycin C, suggesting that indomethacin may be acting on cyclooxygenase-dependent prostaglandin biosynthesis rather than on other enzyme systems which are known to be sensitive to indomethacin at relatively higher drug concentrations (Flower and Vane, 1974; Goueli and Ahmed, 1980) . The observation that BHK-21 cells require a more prolonged treatment with mitomycin C than HeLa/Ohio cells to affect a significant shift in their indomethacin dose response, could signify that the indomethacin-sensitive host factors involved are either more abundant in BHK-21 cells or have a lower binding affinity for this drug as an allosteric inhibitor.",
