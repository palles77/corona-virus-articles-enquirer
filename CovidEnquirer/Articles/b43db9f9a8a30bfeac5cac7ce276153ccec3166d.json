Recent studies revealed that 3a could interact specifically with many SARS-CoV structural proteins, such as M, E and S protein. Expressed 3a protein was reported to localize to Golgi complex in SARS-CoV infected cells. In this study, it was shown that 3a protein was mainly located in Golgi apparatus with different tags at N-or C-terminus. The localization pattern was similar in different transfected cells. With the assay of truncated 3a protein, it was shown that 3a might contain three transmembrane regions, and the second or third region was properly responsible for Golgi localization. By ultra-centrifugation experiment with different extraction buffers, it was confirmed that 3a was an integral membrane protein and embedded in the phospholipid bilayer. Immunofluorescence assay indicated that 3a was co-localized with M protein in Golgi complex in co-transfected cells. These results provide a new insight for further study of the 3a protein on the pathogenesis of SARS-CoV.",

This product was cut with XhoI and EcoRI and cloned into the multiple cloning site (MCS) of the pEGFP-N1 vector (Clontech), producing a 3a/pEGFP-N1 plasmid. The 3a/pEGFP-C1, truncated 3a, 3a/pCMV-myc, M/pCMV-myc and M/pDsRed-N1 constructs were made in a similar fashion, and the oligonucleotide primers were listed in Table 1 .

As shown in Fig. 1C , merged images (3, 6, 9 and 12) were represented regions of overlap between the EGFP fluorescence or myc-staining (green-) and Hoechest-labeling (blue-) image. The results showed that EGFP protein was distributed throughout the entire cell in both cytoplasm and nucleus, however, the pattern of 3a-EGFP was located in the cytoplasm and plasma membrane in a punctate pattern with condensing into discrete loci and spot fluorescence. The fluorescence distribution of EGFP-3a was similar to that of 3a in infected cells (Tan et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2004) , and EGFP or myc tag at N-or C-terminus had little effect on the cellular localization (Fig. 1C) . Similar patterns in immunofluorescence of 3a were observed in Vero, COS-7, A549 and 293 cells (Fig. 1D) . Expression of 3a was emerged from 12 to 48 h after transfection in 293 cells (Fig. 1E) .

(B) Western blotting analysis. 293 cells were transiently transfected with pEGFP-N1, 3a/pEGFP-N1, pEGFP-C1, 3a/pEGFP-C1, pCMV-myc and 3a/pCMV-myc plasmids separately. Cell lysates were prepared at 48 h after transfection and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins transferred to PVDF membrane was probed with monoclonal anti-GFP or anti-myc antibody. Sizes (kDa) of molecular mass markers were indicated on the left. (C) Cellular localization of 3a protein with different tags. 293 cells were transfected with described plasmids separately. Cellular localization of 3a was observed by scanning fluorescence confocal microscopy. Green represented EGFP fluorescence (1, 4 and 7) from original EGFP, 3a-EGFP or EGFP-3a fusion protein; blue (2, 5, 8 and 11) represented Hoechest stained cell nuclei; 3, 6, 9 and 12 images represented overlapping green and blue fluorescence.

Green represented EGFP fluorescence from expressed 3a-EGFP protein. reticulum (ER) and Golgi complex, respectively, it was shown that 3a-EGFP was mainly distributed in Golgi apparatus, and partially in ER ( Fig. 2A) . Further, with the Golgi vector marker -Golgi/pDsRed-N1, it was confirmed 3a was localized well in Glogi complex (Fig. 2B) . Using COS-7 cells, similar results were obtained (data not shown).

To further characterize the region responsible for Golgi localization, a series of truncated 3a were constructed according to the bioinformation results. This approach was used in an attempt to avoid major disruption in protein folding that could result in cut-ting the protein in all transmembrane domains. Different truncated 3a proteins were expressed and migrated at the expected molecular mass separately (Fig. 3B) . Cellular localization of truncated 3a protein was performed as before. As shown in Fig. 3C (A-F and V-X), the fluorescent pattern of 3a D1-147, D1-103 and D 77-274, containing two or three functional regions, was similar to that of wild-type 3a protein (Fig. 1C) , distributing in the cytoplasm and somewhere condensing to spots fluorescence. However, construct 3a D147-274 gave rise to preservation of EGFP in the cytoplasm and nuclear ( Fig. 3C (P-R) ) as did pEGFP-N1 (Fig. 1C) . These results suggested that the N-terminal 147 amino acids of 3a were mainly responsible for the Golgi localization. Furthermore, as shown in Fig. 3C (G-O and S-U), constructs, containing only one transmembrane region of 3a, all localized in the cytoplasm, but more disperse than that of wild-type 3a protein.",

As expected, the cytosolic EGFP protein was detected mainly in the supernatant fraction. When fused with 3a, however, it was detected mainly in the pellet fraction, and expressed at the expected molecular mass. Moreover, the cell lysate pretreated with NP-40 before ultra-centrifugation, 3a-EGFP protein was found exclusively in the supernatant fraction (Fig. 4A) . These results were supportive of the suggestion that 3a protein was closely associated with membrane. Subsequently, the mode of membrane association was further investigated using different buffers to extract the membrane fraction. According to previous reports (de Jong et al., 2003) : 1 M NaCl can increase the ionic strength of buffer; 4 M urea function as mild chaotropic salt conditions; 0.5 M EDTA can chelate divalent cations; 0.1 M Na 2 CO 3 (pH 11.5) providing alkaline conditions, convert membrane to sheet and release soluble proteins that are trapped inside membrane vesicles. The cell lysate was first centrifugated to separate supernatant and pellet fractions, and the pellet fractions were then extracted with the indicated buffers for 1 h (Fig. 4B ). As shown in Fig. 4B , after second ultra-centrifugation, 3a-EGFP protein remained attached to membranes on extraction with PBS (control) and the buffers that extract peripheral membrane proteins, such as 1 M NaCl, or 0.5 M EDTA. In addition, the protein was mainly detected in the pellet fraction when membranes were extracted using 0.1 M Na 2 CO 3 (pH 11.5) and 4 M urea (de Jong et al., 2003) , arguing for integral association attribute of 3a protein. While upon solubilization of membrane pellet using 1% Triton X-100, a non-ionic detergent that released integral membrane proteins, the 3a-EGFP protein was detected in the supernatant fraction. From these results, it was confirmed that 3a protein was integral membrane protein, which embedded in the phospholipid bilayer.",

As shown from previously known coronaviruses, coronaviruses are enveloped positive-strand RNA viruses, which acquired the membrane envelope by budding into the lumen of Golgi complex (de Haan et al., 1999) . Lateral interactions between the coronavirus membrane proteins are thought to mediate the formation of virion envelope. The coronavirus envelope contains three main structural proteins M, S, and E. The S protein is a type I glycoprotein, which is transported to the plasma membrane when expressed on its own, and co-accumulates with the M protein on Golgi complex in coronavirus infected cells (Corse and Machamer, 2000) . The M protein is the most abundant envelope protein of coronaviruses, and the physical nature of coronavirus envelope is largely determined by the characteristics of M protein. M protein accumulates with E and M proteins in the Golgi complex, where they assemble into virus particles in coronavirus infected cells or co-transfected cells. Indirect immunofluorescence and Western blotting assays confirmed the interactions of M protein with E and S proteins. The E protein is a minor but essential viral component. Many studies confirm that coronavirus M protein, interacting with E protein and nucleocapside, plays an important role in viral budding through the membrane (de Haan et al., 1998 (de Haan et al., , 1999 (de Haan et al., , 2000 Lim and Liu, 2001; Narayanan et al., 2000) .",

The merged image was represented region of overlap between the 3a-EGFP (green-) and M-DsRed (red-) or 3a-EGFP (green-) and myc-M (red-) image. All four panels of a row had the same field of view. and in Vero E6 cells. Previous research was shown that 3a could specifically interact with many SARS-CoV structural proteins such as M, S and E proteins, and was distributed mainly in Golgi complex in infected cells (Tan et al., 2004; Yu et al., 2004; Zeng et al., 2004) . To further characterize the subcellular localization and reveal possible functions of 3a protein, 3a was fused with different tag at N-or C-terminus and transfected into different cells. The results showed that the localization of 3a with myc or EGFP tag was similar and mainly distributed in Golgi complex (Figs. 1 and 2) . Golgi complex and rough endoplasmic reticulum (RER) were the sites of coronavirus assembling and budding. Many coronavirus structural proteins, such as M and E proteins, were targeted to the Golgi complex when expressed alone or in coronavirus infected cells (Corse and Machamer, 2003; de Haan et al., 2000; Locker et al., 1992) . These proteins are demonstrated to membrane-associate proteins, having one or more transmembrane regions. Ultra-centrifugation assay was a common method to analyze the interaction of membrane proteins. With this approach, 3a was revealed to be a membrane associated protein, which was resistant to 0.1 M Na 2 CO 3 (pH 11.5) and 4 M urea buffer, but resolved in Triton X-100 buffer. This suggested that 3a was an integral membrane protein, which embedded in the phospholipid bilayer. Bio-information assay predicted that 3a protein contained three transmembrane regions, which spanned from 34 to 56, 77 to 99 and 103 to 125 amino acid. According to the bioinformative results, a series of truncated 3a were constructed. Through analyzing the cellular or subcellular localization patterns of the constructs of 3a protein, 3a was confirmed to be a triple-spanning protein, and the second or third region was reliable for Golgi complex localization (Fig. 3) . Topology analysis showed that 3a, like coronavirus M proteins, also had its NH2 terminus translocated to the lumen of intracellular membrane and its COOH terminus exposed in the Golgi complex (not published data). M protein is type III glycoprotein, which forms homogeneous or heterogeneous complex (with M, S, N and E proteins) in the cytoplasm and functions during host cell entry and virion morphogenesis and release, facilitating the assembly of the virion particles. As provided in this article, co-localization of 3a and M proteins mainly in Golgi complex further confirmed the spatial interaction of 3a and M proteins. These results suggested that 3a protein might take part in processes of SARA-CoV assembling or budding. In addition, Zeng et al. (2004) detected 3a protein in the crude virions with anti-3a antibody. Therefore, 3a protein might be a structural protein, which distributed in Golgi complex membrane or virion surface.",

Moreover, 3a protein was demonstrated to be an integral membrane protein, which embedded in the phospholipid bilayer. In additional, it was shown that 3a was co-localized with M protein along the Golgi complex. The results of 3a protein presented above provided a new insight for further studies on the potential role of 3a protein in viral budding and cell injury.",

Kozak consensus translation initiation site was indicated. The animo acid positions for 3a were given at the low (a, b and c represented the three transmembrane regions). C or N from localization represented the cytoplasm or nuclear localization. (B) Western blotting analysis. 293 cells were transiently transfected with described plasmids separately. Cell lysates were prepared at 48 h post-transfection and separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins transferred to PVDF membrane was probed with anti-GFP antibody. Sizes (kDa) of molecular mass markers were indicated on the left. (C) Cellular localization of truncated 3a protein. At 24 h post-transfection with indicated mutants, 293 cells were analyzed by confocal fluorescence microscopy. Left row (green) showed fusion EGFP fluorescence; middle row (red) showed PI stained cell nuclei; right row (yellow) represented overlapping green and red fluorescence. The fluorescent pattern of 3a D1-147, D1-103 and D77-274 (A-F, V-X), like wild-type 3a, was distributed in the cytoplasm and somewhere condensed to spots fluorescence. And mutant 3a D1-77, D77-103, D99-147 and D99-274 were localized in the cytoplasm (G-O, S-U). However, construct 3a D147-274 gave rise to preservation of EGFP in the cytoplasm and nuclear (P-R). (D) Subcellular localization of deletant 3a protein with Golgi-DsRed protein. 293 cells co-transfected with the deletant 3a and",
