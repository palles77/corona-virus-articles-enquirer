Commonly reported side effects of all clinically used TKIs include lung injury and repair, loss of stem cells from epithelial surfaces, and drug-associated cell injury. However, these adverse reactions depend on individual susceptibility. Imatinib is generally tolerated well by most patients, although its use at high doses can cause grade 3 and 4 nonhematological toxicities and severe pulmonary adverse events in the early chronic phase of CML.

Chest computed tomography (CT) showed dense cord-shaped or grid-shaped fibers distributed along the surrounding bronchi. Both lungs, particularly the upper lobes, were involved, and the findings were typical of interstitial pneumonia ( Fig. 2A) .

In one Japanese study including 27 patients with ILD who were treated with imatinib, varied CT findings were documented; however, no diffuse alveolar damage was observed. Among 24 patients who received prednisone, 19 received high doses and five received moderate doses. The remaining three patients were untreated. Most of the treated patients exhibited an improvement and recovered, with only five patients showing no improvement. [3] Imatinib-induced ILD is likely to develop in previous damaged lungs [3] or in lungs with a history of tuberculosis, [4] with the mechanism of lung injury possible related to inhibition of platelet-derived growth factor receptor by imatinib. [5] Our patient had no history of smoking or lung disease, and tumors and rheumatic disease were excluded by laboratory tests. Reintroduction of imatinib caused disease relapse, consistent with the findings in a previous study. [3] In contrast, another case report documented successful rechallenge with imatinib in a patient with imatinib-induced pneumonitis. [6] Our patient did not show obvious improvements in imaging findings after prednisone treatment; moreover, he showed poor tolerance when imatinib was reintroduced in his treatment regimen.

            "text": "An interesting finding for the present case was the recovery of lung function despite the lack of improvement in imaging findings during a follow-up period of almost 2.5 years. This phenomenon is generally observed in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome, [7, 8] where imaging findings do not improve despite a clinically improved condition. The precise reason for this finding in our patient remains unclear, and we cannot predict whether the CT findings will improve with time. We hope to get some clarity as we continue to monitor the patient. Nilotinib is an analog of imatinib, and it can block BCR-ABL kinase with a 20-fold higher intensity. [6, 8] Nilotinib has been approved for use in patients with CML showing imatinib resistance or intolerance. [1, 9] A previous study showed that lung abnormalities caused by imatinib could be reversed approximately 3 months after switching to nilotinib treatment. [9] Imatinib intolerance may occasionally occur when the dose is increased, and nilotinib can play an important role in the subsequent treatment of such cases. [1] However, it remains unclear whether the patient can tolerate the initial dose of imatinib or recover from the lung damage. In the present case, the patient did not tolerate imatinib after rechallenge and was eventually switched to nilotinib, following which his lung function improved with any improvement in the fibrosis. The irreversible lung fibrosis could have been caused by imatinib rechallenge, although we cannot confirm this. A previous report documented irreversible architectural distortion in a patient who used imatinib for 4 years. [10] Thus, the severity of imatinibinduced lung damage seems to be time-dependent, particularly in dose-independent patients; however, the exact treatment duration that can cause irreversible damage remains unclear. According to our experience and other reports, this duration is probably 3 to 9 months.",

The possible reason was the long-term use of imatinib for >9 months. The findings from this case suggest that clinicians should consider the possibility of severe irreversible ILD and carefully monitor patients receiving imatinib treatment.",
