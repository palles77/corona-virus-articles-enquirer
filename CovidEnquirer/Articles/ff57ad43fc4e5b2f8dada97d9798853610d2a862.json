After further passages in SK-K cell monolayers with undiluted culture fluid, CPE developed earlier and became complete within 48 h postinoculation (p.i.). Viral specific antigen was detected in the cytoplasm of the infected SK-K cells by indirect immunofluorescence using rabbit antiserum against the mouse-passaged virus. The SK-K-passaged virus as well as the original mouse-passaged virus formed clear plaques on SK-K cell monolayers under simple overlay medium. The plaque assay system for HEV 67N was established by studying various factors influencing the plaque formation in the SK-K cell cultures. By this system more than lo6 PFUIO.2 ml of the virus yield was detected in the fluid phase of the infected cultures at 48 h p.i. The SK-K-passaged virus caused fatal infection in 4-week-old mice by intracerebral inoculation, but was inhibited by rabbit antiserum against the mouse-passaged virus. Plaque formation and hemagglutinating activity of the virus were specifically inhibited by antisera against the mouse-passaged and SK-K-passaged 67N virus.",

Incubation for 72 h increased the plaque size and number. The plaque size was 2.G2.5 mm in diameter (Fig. 3) . Further incubation resulted in the degeneration of the uninfected cell monolayers and decrease of plaque count. Incubation for 72 h was therefore adopted as a standard procedure. Table 2 , the addition of DEAE-dextran (50 @ml) to the virus adsorption medium and overlay medium increased the plaque count by 50% but the condition of the SK-K cell cultures became worse in comparison to the control cultures without DEAE-dextran. When trypsin was added, no significant difference in the size and number of plaques was found between added and control cultures, but the cells were damaged by trypsin. The addition of both DEAEdextran and trypsin enhanced damage of the cells. Based on these results, the standard technique of plaque assay was established as described in Materials and Methods. Using this technique, the plaque count was shown to be directly proportional to virus concentration. In the serial passages of the virus in SK-K cells described above, the virus yield in the fluid phase ranged from 106.' to 1o6.3 PFlJO.2 ml after 2 days of incubation, although the titers in the early passages were lower. \"Virus material was incubated with an equal volume of either MEM or rabbit antiserum against mousepassaged virus (HI titer 1:128) at room temperature for 30 min, and then 0.02 ml of the mixture was inoculated intracerebrally into 4-week-old ICR mice. bNumber of mice dead/number of mice tested; mean death time in days was shown in parenthesis.",

In the SK-K cell system, DEAE-dextran did not show the significant enhancing effect on plaque formation, and plaques developed earlier and clearer than in ESK cell system. FCS is known to inhibit adsorption of coronaviruses onto cell membrane (Gerna et al., 1980) .
