This chapter examines how these activities expose them to increased risks of infection and disease. Along with many other factors that predispose to clinical infection, recreational behavior may either expose the host to infective organisms or modify the immune response, thereby increasing susceptibility to infection and disease. Recreational infection can be classified by recreational activity or according to the particular infections (or systems infected, see Table 71 -1). Inevitably there is considerable overlap with other sections of this book, such as international medicine (see Section 6) and zoonotic infection.",

Yellow fever is a life-threatening mosquito-borne, zoonotic viral infection and the illness remains a risk for travelers and residents during outdoor activities in endemic regions of Africa and South America. In certain parts of Europe, tick-borne encephalitis (TBE) is regularly reported and a major risk factor is outdoor recreation (in particular, walking through long grass while wearing short trousers). The increased incidence TBE in recent years is thought to be due in part to increased time spent outdoors due to the warm weather. 19 An inactivated vaccine is available.",

            "text": "Leptospirosis (see Chapter 130) is traditionally regarded as a significant risk. It is estimated that on average in the UK there are 5 million recreational water users each year exclusive of bathers, and yet amongst this at-risk population there are only 2.5 cases of leptospirosis a year. 29 The annual total incidence of leptospirosis in England and Wales is more than 10 times that figure; it occurs principally among agricultural workers. Leptospirosis is a zoonotic infection that is mainly carried by rodents; it is estimated that about 25% of the rats in UK are infected. The risk of contracting infection relates less to the overall water quality than to the density of the local rodent population. Triathlon and other forms of 'adventure racing' have led to outbreaks of leptospirosis. 30 Sejvar et al. described the outbreak that occurred during the 2000 'Eco-Challenge' event in Sabah, Borneo. 31 Of 304 competing athletes, 42% met the case definition for leptospirosis. The authors suggest that taking 200 mg of doxycycline weekly during exposure may limit infection and disease (a strategy previously demonstrated to be effective by the US military).",

The cercariae of human schistosomes penetrate intact human skin and then migrate to their favored site to commence their maturation. Within 24 hours the penetration of the skin can produce a pruritic papular rash that is called 'swimmers' itch' . Avian schistosomes are found in temperate climates, including in the Great Lakes of North America, and although they are unable to mature past the cercarial stage in a human host and therefore cannot give rise to later stage schistosomiasis, they can be responsible for producing a significant 'swimmers' itch' . Schistosoma mansoni, and S. haematobium are particularly recognized in swimmers who have bathed in Lake Malawi and the other rivers and lakes of East Africa.",

This is highly infectious and may spread rapidly between players. Aciclovir is effective treatment.

It was established that 95% of orienteers received scratches or wounds during the competition.
