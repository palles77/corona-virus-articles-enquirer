The publication of this second theme issue attests to the frequency, visibility, and attention that these diseases are receiving. A year ago, we commented on several prevailing factors worldwide that facilitate the emergence of zoonotic infectious diseases, among them a growing human population, increased interaction between species, global climate changes, and rapid movement of people and animals (1). These factors continue to exert their influence, and we continue to see a plethora of emerging zoonotic infectious diseases.",

The authors suggest that we must learn to cooperate if we are to effectively combat emerging microbial threats. In the past year, improved cooperation has been evident. We have observed early detection and response to several important zoonotic diseases threatening the public's health. These responses were made possible by several strategic partnerships across human and animal health sectors-partnerships that have been long in the making.",
