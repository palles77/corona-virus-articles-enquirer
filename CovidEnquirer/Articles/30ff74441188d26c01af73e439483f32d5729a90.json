During this period the World Health Organisation issued a global alert about SARS and together with the Centre for Disease Control have coordinated their efforts to investigate its pathogenesis and treatment. The outbreak in Hong Kong has been dramatic due to its geographical proximity with Guangdong province, China where the first case of SARS was reported. SARS has been described as a rapidly progressive, sometimes fatal pneumonia with a case fatality rate of 7.6% requiring intensive care. The four case reports illustrate a number of important points concerning the recognition, treatment, management and prevention of SARS, and highlights the importance of considering vigilant assessment and monitoring of patients with SARS. The purpose of this paper is to share our experiences in caring for critically ill patients with SARS in the intensive care unit to nurses globally in order to reduce SARS' morbidity and mortality as well as to protect nurses and other healthcare workers from this disease that is so far threatening the community at large. r",

In March, preliminary data on two causative agents of SARS, metapneumovirus and coronavirus, have been implicated by the medical staff of the two universities in Hong Kong. However, the WHO and CDC scientists around the world have been searching for the causative agent of SARS. Clinical specimens from patients with SARS were analysed to detect the unknown virus. Drosten et al. (2003) conducted virologic testing from respiratory and blood samples of SARS patients in Frankfurt, Germany and detected a novel coronavirus. They concluded that the extremely high concentration of the virus particles in sputum specimen were consistent with high level of contagiousness, its presence in the serum suggested a long viremic phase, and during the convalescent period, presence of the virus in feces could increase its period of infectivity which compared to the typically short infectivity of acute viral respiratory infections. Ksiazek et al. (2003) and Peiris et al. (2003) also used virus isolation technique and also isolated a novel coronavirus from patients who met the case definition of SARS. As of April 19, WHO (2003a) reported that the agent that causes SARS has now been conclusively identified as a new coronavirus unlike any other known human or animal virus in the coronavirus family.",

Patients with hypoxaemia received oxygen via the nasal cannula and were closely monitored. However, within 1-8 days after admission, these patients were transferred to the Intensive Care Unit (ICU) due to severe respiratory failure that required intubation and mechanical pressure controlled ventilation with high positive end expiratory pressure (PEEP) and a fraction of inspired oxygen (FiO 2 ) of 1.0 (Tsang et al., 2003) .

However, nurses also have the responsibility to educate the patients' relatives and make sure that they have understood the government guidelines. Since Hong Kong is a highly dense community, the government also emphasised the importance of avoiding: (1) places and restaurants that are too crowded, (2) traveling to areas considered as ''hot spots'' (places and building were SARS infections have been confirmed), (3) children's outings while schools are suspended, (4) kissing and shaking hands in social encounters, and (5) the importance of hand hygiene.

Depending on the age and fitness of the patient, the course of the disease can vary from patient to patient as illustrated in the case reports. However, the medical management and nursing care provided for these patients basically followed the routine care received by the four case reports presented in this paper. The combination of ribavirin and corticosteroid in treating the cases in Hong Kong have stabilised and improved the outcome of most patients with most recovering from the disease after being in the critical list for nearly a month. Since the ICU was converted to SARS-ICU, strict adherence to infection control measures, and use of goggles, visors, and protective clothing, we were able to contain the spread of the disease to other areas of the hospital and to the healthcare providers. These practices were found effective and were supported from a case-control study in five Hong Kong hospital, Seto et al. (2003) found that staff who used N-95 masks, gowns, and handwashing were less likely to develop SARS than those who did not use them. On reflection, the nursing care provided to ICU patients has been effective in spite of limited resources in personnel and equipment.",

Initial diagnosis is according to clinical symptomatology which will be confirmed by virological studies.

In order to support the staff, the hospital has established a telephone counseling hot-line for staff as well as training and preceptorship program for new nurses working in ICU. The infection among healthcare providers was a sombering reminder of the importance of adhering to infection control measures. The Hong Kong Department of Health released a set of updated infection control measures at home for staff caring for patients with SARS available through the Hong Kong government website (http://www.info.gov.hk/dh).
