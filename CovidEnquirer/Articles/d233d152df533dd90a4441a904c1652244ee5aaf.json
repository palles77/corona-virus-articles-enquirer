We aimed to determine the proportion of subjects with pathologic chest radio graphic findings and the clinical predictors associated with pathologic chest radiographic findings in young children admitted with the typical presentation of bronchiolitis. Methods: We obtained the following data at admission: sex, age, neonatal history, past history of hospitalization for respiratory illnesses, heart rate, respiratory rate, the presence of fever, total duration of fever, oxygen saturation, laboratory parameters (i.e., complete blood cell count, highsensitivity Creactive protein [hsCRP], etc.), and chest radiography. Results: The study comprised 279 young children. Of these, 26 had a chest radiograph revealing opacity (n=24) or atelectasis (n=2). Multivariate logistic regression analysis showed that after adjustment for confounding factors, the clinical predictors associated with pathologic chest radiographic findings in young children admitted with bronchiolitis were elevated hsCRP level (>0.3 mg/dL) and past history of hospitalization for respiratory illnesses (all P<0.05). Conclusion: The current study suggests that chest radiographs in young children with typical clinical manifestations of bronchiolitis have limited value. Nonetheless, young children with clinical factors such as high hsCRP levels at admission or past history of hospitalization for respiratory illnesses may be more likely to have pathologic chest radiographic findings.",

Multivariate logistic regression analyses results determined that after adjustment for potential confounding factors, including sex and age, pathologic chest radiographic findings were significantly positively associated with hsCRP (>0.3 mg/dL) and a history of clinical predictors in young children hospitalized for bronchiolitis at a general hospital. We were able to demonstrate that the ma jority of children (90.7%) admitted with the typical presentation of bronchiolitis showed benign chest radiographic findings at admission; however, those with high hsCRP levels at admission or a history of admission due to respiratory illnesses prior to the current admission were approximately 1.2 times more likely to have pathologic chest radiographic findings. Subjects with bronchiolitis may also have pneumonia detected by chest Xray 710) . A previous study analyzing patients less than 24 months of age admitted via the emergency department with the diagnosis of bronchiolitis found that 15 subjects out of 122 patients (12.3%) showed abnormal chest Xray findings such as atelectasis or consolidation 8) . Another study assessing 410 chest radiographs performed on children admitted with bronchio litis through the Emergency Department suggested that 40 (9.7%) were considered abnormal 7) , a number similar to our finding of 9.3%. A previous study determined that young children with oxy gen saturation \u226492% or a Respiratory Disease Assess ment Instrument (RDAI) clinical score \u226510 of 17 points were more likely to have pathologic chest radiographic findings than their coun terparts 10) . Another study found that body temperature \u226538\u00b0C and oxygen saturation <94% were associated with infiltrates/atelec tasis 9) . Finally, a recent study reported that the presence of fever was the only significant clinical predictor of radiographic abnor malities among their cohort 7) . In contrast to previous studies, we did not find fever or hypoxia to be a risk factor for chest abnor malities. We found that high hsCRP levels at admission or a his tory of admission due to respiratory illnesses prior to the cur rent admission were clinical factors predicting pathologic radio graphic findings in this cohort. This discrepancy may be ascribed to differences in characteristics of the populations such as age, sea sons during which the tests were performed, or causa tive agents.",
