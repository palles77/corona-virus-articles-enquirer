The outbreak was caused by a newly emerged virus now known as the SARS-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV), which is believed to originate from animals. Most of the early index cases in Guangdong Province were concentrated in food handlers, and workers in live-animal markets had higher rates of antibodies to SARS-CoV than persons in other occupations (2, 3) . Studies have indicated that Chinese ferret-badgers (Melogale moschata), masked palm civets (Paguma larvata), and raccoon-dogs (Nyctereutes procyonoides) could be naturally infected by SARS-CoV or a closely related virus (4) . Furthermore, experimental infection studies indicated that a variety of animals, including monkey, cat, ferret, mouse, and pig, are susceptible to SARS-CoV infection (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) . These findings highlight the difficulties facing investigation into the origin of SARS-CoV.",

However, no conclusive evidence suggests that civets are the natural reservoir host of SARS-CoV or that civets in their natural habitat are infected with SARS-CoV. Lack of access to wild civets and regulatory issues involved make conducting detailed field studies of wild civets difficult, if not impossible, for the foreseeable future. Since most civets in markets are sourced from civet farms, we have conducted a preliminary serologic study on the prevalence of antibodies to SARS-CoV in civets from the market and farms.",

Animals selected from one market in Guangzhou in January 2004 had a much higher prevalence of SARS-CoV antibodies than those selected from farms in the same period or from farms in two other provinces in June 2003. These results raise the possibility that civets, rather than being the natural animal reservoir of SARS-CoV, are infected mainly in markets or during other trade-related activities. Our results suggest that mass slaughter of civets on farms might not be necessary to control SARS-CoV spread. A more effective approach might be to implement testing in live animal markets and farms for susceptible animals and to apply quarantine regulation and targeted slaughter for markets or farms with infected animals. Results of these studies and those from our current study are similar. We observed a high percentage of infected civets in one particular market at a specific time. However, no indication of civet infection was seen on most farms during the same period. These results support the hypothesis that civets are highly susceptible to SARS-CoV, perhaps especially when they are stressed, and that most infections occurred in the market.",

            "text": "We observed a number of practices during our study. First, most animal traders deal with multiple species. Second, housing different animals in close proximity is common. Third, although civets are in high demand in Guangdong Province, they are expensive, so a batch of animals may remain in a storehouse for weeks. All of these factors facilitate interspecies transmission, which would be followed by rapid transmission among the civet population. Finally, civet farming and trading has been in practice in China for >10 years, but SARS has not been observed in workers until recently, which points to a recent introduction of SARS-CoV in the civet population in markets.",

One important observation from this study was that patients who became ill early in the epidemic were more likely than those who became ill later to report living near a produce market but not near a farm, which supports the notion that no widespread SARS-CoV infection occurred among farmed animals.",

These animals were collected in the same market at the same time, but they originated in different regions of southern China; consequently, most, if not all, of these animals were likely infected in the market. In addition, SARS-CoV infection was also observed in at least one raccoon dog (Nyctereutes procyonoides) and one Chinese ferret-badger (Melogale moschata) from the same market at the same time, which demonstrates possible interspecies SARS-CoV transmission during trading. Sequence analysis of the S genes showed that one civet isolate (SZ16) was more closely related to the raccoon dog isolate (SZ13) than the other two civet isolates (SZ1 and SZ3), which further supports interspecies transmission in the market (4) . Since that study, several experimental infection studies have shown most mammalian species tested to be susceptible to SARS-CoV infection (5) (6) (7) (8) (9) , and animal-to-animal transmission can occur under experimental conditions as well (6) . Caution should be taken in determining the origin of SARS-CoV; data collected from markets where a wide variety of species are housed in close proximity may be unreliable.",

Improved serologic tests should be developed that can detect SARS-CoV-specific antibodies from different animal species, without relying on live SARS-CoV. Other issues that remain to be resolved include the rate of new infections in susceptible animal species, the characteristics of the animals that become infected, and the nature of the exposures that lead to interspecies transmission.",

The diagram on the left identifies the six provinces relevant to this study. The diagram on the right is an enlarged map of Guangdong Province showing the locations of the four farms and the capital city Guangzhou, where the live animal market was located. Also shown is Shenzhen, where civets from live animal markets were tested by Guan et al. in May 2003 (5). in May 2003, a similar study conducted by us in the same period yielded different results. In our study, we collected civets from Xinyuan Live Animal Market in Guangzhou (n = 7), the Guangdong Centre for Rescue and Care of Wildlife Animals, also located in Guangzhou (n = 9), and a civet farm in neighboring Jiangxi Province (n = 15). While 2 civets from the market and 2 from the center were positive for SARS-CoV by RT-PCR, all 15 farmed animals from Jiangxi had negative results (C. Tu et al., unpub. data).",
