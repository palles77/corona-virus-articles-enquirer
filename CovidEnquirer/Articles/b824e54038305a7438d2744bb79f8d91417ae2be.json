Some additional information is gleaned from examining rates of ventilator-associated pneumonias (VAP). Among surgical type critical care units, the pooled mean rate per 1000 ventilator days was a low of 0.6 in pediatric cardiothoracic units to a high of 8.1 in trauma units. However, it is difficult to distinguish how much of a direct impact intubation and anesthesia had on the development of these pneumonias. One study by Rello and colleagues 24 examined the development of pneumonia within the first 48 hours of intubation. Eighteen of 250 intensive care unit (ICU) patients developed pneumonia within the first 24 hours. There were 65 surgical patients included in this study. The 2 most important risk factors for pneumonia in patients were undergoing cardiopulmonary resuscitation and receiving conscious sedation.

Yet Loftus and colleagues 30 raise the issue of transmission of bacteria in the anesthesia work area. These investigators cultured 2 specific areas of the anesthesia machine and the sterile stopcock just before the beginning of the case and again at the end of the case. Their results showed that 32% of the stopcocks were contaminated by the end of the case. The work area showed a significant increase in bacterial contamination as well. Two cases of methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) were transmitted to the work area intraoperatively. One case of vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus transmission was documented between the anesthesia work are and the stopcock. The investigators also noted a trend toward increased HAIs among patients with contaminated stopcocks. The machine and stopcocks appear to have become contaminated by contact with providers' hands or lapses in aseptic technique. These results reinforce the need for rigorous attention to hand hygiene not only before the start of surgery but also intraoperatively. Most studies indicate that adherence to hand hygiene by health care workers needs to be improved. McGuckin and colleagues 31 report only modest improvement to 51% compliance among non-ICU staff after a year-long program of observation and feedback. A 2004 report by Pittet and colleagues 32 found a 23% compliance rate among anesthesiologists. Hand hygiene is clearly a challenge in the operating room because of the multiple functions being performed. Limited access to hand hygiene products within the operating room undoubtedly contributes to poor compliance in the room.",

It is difficult to determine the actual number of occupationally acquired blood-borne infections in the discipline. In a 1998 study among anesthesia personnel, the estimated average 30-year risks of HIV or hepatitis C virus infection per full-time equivalent was 0.049% and 0.45%, respectively. 36 In addition, there may be exposure to bacterial pathogens such as MRSA and Clostridium difficile. The AANA supports the CDC's recommendations to use standard precautions in the care of all patients. 28 In summary, standard precautions entail:",
