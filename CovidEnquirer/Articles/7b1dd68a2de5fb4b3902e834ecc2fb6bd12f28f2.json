We hypothesized that chloroquine could have a dual effect in liver ischemia/reperfusion (I/R) injury: chloroquine on the one hand could protect the liver against I/R injury via inhibition of inflammatory response, but on the other hand could aggravate liver I/R injury through inhibition of autophagy. Rats (n \u00bc 6 per group) were pre-treated with chloroquine (60 mg/kg, i.p.) 1 h before warm ischemia, and they were continuously subjected to a daily chloroquine injection for up to 2 days. Rats were killed 0.5, 6, 24 and 48 h after reperfusion. At the early phase (i.e., 0-6 h after reperfusion), chloroquine treatment ameliorated liver I/R injury, as indicated by lower serum aminotransferase levels, lower hepatic inflammatory cytokines and fewer histopathologic changes. In contrast, chloroquine worsened liver injury at the late phase of reperfusion (i.e., 24-48 h after reperfusion). The mechanism of protective action of chloroquine appeared to involve its ability to modulate mitogen-activated protein kinase activation, reduce high-mobility group box 1 release and inflammatory cytokines production, whereas chloroquine worsened liver injury via inhibition of autophagy and induction of hepatic apoptosis at the late phase.",

The signaling events contributing to cellular and tissue damage are diverse and complex, and consist of complex interactions of multiple inflammatory pathways. [3] [4] [5] Proinflammatory cytokines, such as high-mobility group box 1 (HMGB1), tumor necrosis factor (TNF)-a and interleukin (IL)-1b are known to increase in serum and liver tissue on reperfusion and have a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of hepatic I/R injury. [6] [7] [8] [9] Chloroquine, a well-known anti-malaria drug, has also been frequently used in the treatment of inflammatory diseases, including rheumatoid arthritis and systemic lupus erythematodes. 10 It has been suggested that the therapeutic effect of chloroquine in these diseases is related to its immunoregulatory potency. Recent evidences have shown that chloroquine inhibits proinflammatory cytokine production by macrophages or monocytes after stimulation with lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or CpG oligonucleotide (CpG ODN). [11] [12] [13] In vivo, chloroquine protected mice from lethal doses of LPS or CpG ODN through a decrease of proinflammatory cytokine release. 11 Furthermore, chloroquine protected mice from sepsis-induced acute kidney injury and decreased serum inflammatory cytokines levels. 14 Prompted by these results, we hypothesized that chloroquine could also possess anti-inflammatory abilities to protect from or reduce hepatic I/R injury, which is characterized as inflammatory injury.",

Liver warm I/R resulted in significant increase in serum levels of alanine transaminase (ALT) and aspartate aminotransferase (AST). As shown in Figure 1a , following 60 min of warm ischemia, chloroquine treatment decreased I/R injury at 0.5 and 6 h as indicated by lower liver enzymes (Po0.05). However, the serum levels of ALT and AST were much higher following 24-and 48-h reperfusion when compared Figure 1 Chloroquine treatment prevented liver I/R injury at early phase, but worsened at late phase following I/R injury. Rats were pre-treated with either chloroquine (60 mg/kg) or vehicle (saline) 1 h before warm ischemia, followed by an additional chloroquine injections at 24 h after reperfusion. Following 60 min (a) or 90 min (b) of warm ischemia, liver injury was assessed at various time points following reperfusion by determination of serum AST and ALT levels. Data are shown as mean \u00b1 S.D. *Po0.05 compared with vehicle-treated I/R group.

Representative images from six rats per group were selected with vehicle-injected rats (Po0.05). To further confirm the dual effects of chloroquine on liver I/R injury, additional rats were subjected to 90 min of warm I/R. Chloroquine treatment caused a similar dual effect in terms of liver injury when rats were subjected to prolonged warm ischemic insult ( Figure 1b ). Liver histology confirmed the findings regarding liver injury described above. Moderate hepatocellular necrosis, cytoplasmic vacuolization of hepatocytes and sinusoidal dilation were observed 6 h after reperfusion in vehicle-treated rats. In contrast, minor hepatocellular necrosis and slight sinusoidal dilation were observed in chloroquine treatment group. However, chloroquine-treated rats showed more severe cytoplasmic vacuolization and hepatocellular necrosis 24 h after reperfusion when compared with vehicle-treated rats ( Figure 1c ; Table 1 ).",

To study the effects of chloroquine on proinflammatory cytokine gene expression, rats were preconditioned with chloroquine before the ischemic insult. We demonstrated that following 60 min of warm ischemia, chloroquine treatment reduced TNF-a, IL-6, IL-1b and iNOS gene expression at 0.5 and 6 h after reperfusion. These cytokines are known to have a pivotal role in the pathophysiology of hepatic I/R injury. 6, 7, 28 Recent studies suggest that extracellular HMGB1, released from damaged liver cells, causes a proinflammatory intra-hepatic micro-environment in the post-ischemic liver. Therefore, we investigated whether chloroquine treatment could modulate the release of HMGB1. Consistent with the findings in our previous studies and from other groups, HMGB1 was mainly present in the nucleus of hepatocytes in normal livers, and translocated from nucleus to cytoplasm on liver I/R injury. 8, 9, 29, 30 Chloroquine treatment reduced hepatic HMGB1 translocation and serum levels in the early phase. HMGB1 release induced the synthesis of proinflammatory cytokines and caused further liver damage in liver after I/R injury. 8, 9 Treatment with a neutralizing antibody to HMGB1 significantly decreased liver I/R injury. 9 These data suggest that the inhibition of hepatic HMGB1 translocation and subsequent release is involved in the hepatoprotective effect of chloroquine in the early phase of reperfusion.",

            "text": "To elucidate the molecular basis of chloroquine-mediated injury in the late phase in liver I/R injury, we investigated its effect on the activation of autophagy. Autophagy is a highly conserved regulated cellular process by which cytoplasmic constituents, including organelles are broken down and are recycled through the lysosomal degradation pathway. 23, 24 The execution of autophagy involves a set of evolutionarily conserved autophagy-related gene (Atg) proteins, which are required for the induction of autpophagy, and the generation, maturation, and recycling of autophagosomes. 35 LC3, a homologue of yeast Atg8, exists in two forms, LC3-I and its proteolytic derivative LC3-II. After synthesis, pro-LC3 is cleaved by Atg4B to expose a C-terminal glycine residue, which represents the cytosolic LC3-I form. LC3-1 is subsequently conjugated with phosphatidylethanolamine to become LC3-II, which localizes on the isolation membrane and the autophagic membranes. As the amount of LC3-II correlates with the number of autophagosomes, LC3-II thus can be used to estimate autophagic activity. 36 p62 is selectively incorporated into autophagosomes via direct binding to LC3 and is identified as one of the specific substrates that degrade through the autophagy-lysosomal pathway. Thus, the total cellular expression levels of p62 inversely correlate with autophagic activity. 36 Chloroquine has been recently used to inhibit autophagy in vivo without noticeable side effects. Chloroquine raises the lysosomal pH, which leads to inhibition of lysosome-autophagosome fusion and lysosomal protein degradation. In this study, chloroquine blocked autophagic flux as shown by LC3-II and P62 accumulation and aggravated liver I/R injury after reperfusion. Impaired autophagy leads to the development of MPT in hypoxic hepatocytes. 37 Onset of the MPT leads to a pH-dependent necrotic cell death as well as apoptotic cell death by releasing proapoptotic proteins factors, which are normally sequestered in the mitochondrial intermembrane space. [38] [39] [40] Indeed, induction of autophagy is associated with attenuation of I/R injury in liver, as demonstrated recently. 21, 41, 42 As treatment with chloroquine significantly decreased autophagy and worsened liver injury, we concluded that the decreased autophagy accounted, in part, for the hepatic harmful effects of chloroquine in the late phase after reperfusion.",

Recent studies have suggested possible molecular mechanisms for crosstalk between autophagy and apoptosis. [44] [45] [46] Bcl-2 family proteins, the well-characterized apoptosis regulators, has recently become clear that they reduce Beclin 1-mediated autophagy by inhibiting the formation of the Beclin 1-hVps34 PI3K complex and Beclin 1-associated class III PI3K activity. 44 It has been demonstrated that inhibition of autophagy by chloroquine prevents the fusion of autophagosomes with lysosomes via a disruption in the pH of acidic vesicles. Thus, the increased cellular burden of autophagosomes has been shown to precede and possibly induce Bax-and mitochondrial-dependent apoptosis. [17] [18] [19] [20] These previous results led us to investigate whether chloroquine could also increase hepatic apoptosis after I/R injury. Our results showed that chloroquine treatment increased apoptotic cell death as indicated by increased I/Rinduced caspase protein cleavage. Together, these data suggest that chloroquine-mediated hepatic harmful effects may involve induction of apoptosis.",

The mechanism of protective action of chloroquine in the early phase seems to be related to its ability to decrease inflammatory cytokines and HMGB1 release, and to alter I/R-induced MAP kinase activation. The harmful side effects of chloroquine in the late phase appear to involve its ability to induce apoptosis and to inhibit autophagy. These data suggest that the dual role of chloroquine should be considered when using chloroquine as an inhibitor of inflammation or autophagy in I/R injury.",
