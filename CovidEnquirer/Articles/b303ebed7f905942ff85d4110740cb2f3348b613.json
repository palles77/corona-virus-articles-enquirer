We used H5N1 pseudotyped and reverse-genetics (RG) virus particles to study their ability to bind with DC-SIGN. Electronic microscopy and functional assay results indicate that pseudotyped viruses containing both HA and NA proteins express hemagglutination and are capable of infecting cells expressing a-2,3-linked sialic acid receptors. Results from a capture assay show that DC-SIGN-expressing cells (including B-THP-1/DC-SIGN and T-THP-1/DC-SIGN) and peripheral blood dendritic cells are capable of transferring H5N1 pseudotyped and RG virus particles to target cells; this action can be blocked by anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibodies. In summary, (a) DC-SIGN acts as a capture or attachment molecule for avian H5N1 virus, and (b) DC-SIGN mediates infections in cis and in trans.",

Results from clinical laboratory diagnoses indicate the presence of H5N1 viral RNA in patient plasma, and the virus has been isolated from plasma specimens [4] . This suggests H5N1 dissemination from a primary infection site (the lungs) to other organs, where they cause systemic diseases [5] .

When pathogens invade a host, DCs sense and capture them via two pattern recognition receptors: toll-like receptors and C-type lectins [6] . A C-type lectin known as dendritic cell-specific ICAM-3 grabbing non-integrin (DC-SIGN)(CD209) is an important factor in DC immune regulation. DC-SIGN may be capable of capturing or internalizing pathogens as a means of mediating antigen presentation for T-cell activation and proliferation [6] . During interactions between DC-SIGN and pathogens, the latter would take advantage of this mechanism for immune escape. DC-SIGN was initially identified as an attachment molecule for the human immunodeficiency virus [7] , but has since been identified as a receptor for several viruses [6] . In addition to enhancing viral infections in trans [8] , it also serves as a receptor for virus entry and replication in DCs [9] . DC-SIGN binds distinct carbohydrate structure, such as mannosecontaining glycoconjugates and fucose-containing Lewis blood group antigens, suggesting that it governs a broad pathogen-recognition pattern [10] . Since the HA protein of H5N1 is a glycoprotein with 9 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, we hypothesized that DC-SIGN interacts with the HA protein, consequently facilitating viral infection or dissemination.",

The external globular structure is primarily composed of the HA1 domain; N -g lyc o s yl a t i o n N-glycosylation sites 26, 27, 39, 170, 181, 2 0 9 209, and 302 are likely candidates for interaction with DC-SIGN (Fig. 1B) . The pseudotyped virus system is useful for analyzing functional domains for the receptor-binding property of viral envelopes. Pseudotyped lentiviral particles expressing heterologous viral glycoproteins have been reported for SARS, HCV, Ebola, and dengue viruses [11, 17, 18] . It has also been reported that lentiviral particles pseudotyped with HA from H5N1 (H5) have entry characteristics (i.e., receptor usage, pH requirements, and neutralization) that are similar to those for the real H5N1 [11] . We therefore used a HIV-1defective genome carrying a luciferase gene to generate two types of pseudotyped viruses: HA alone and HA/NA of the H5N1 virus. Results from TEM examinations revealed that both H5 and H5N1 pseudotyped virus particles contained spike-like HA structures on their surfaces (Fig. 1C) . We also observed higher numbers of pseudotyped virus particles generated by HA/NA co-transfection compared to HA alone. Nefkens et al. [11] used a similar system to produce lentiviral pseudotyped viruses with HA from H5N1, adding neuraminidase to culture medium to harvest larger quantities. Their data are consistent with our observation that pseudotyped virus particles bearing both HA and NA proteins are much more easily released from cell surfaces compared to particles bearing the HA protein only.",

Cells were incubated with H5N1 pseudotyped viruses; viral infectivity was determined with luciferase assays. As shown in Fig. 2A , B-THP-1/ DC-SIGN cells expressed twice as much luciferase activity as the B-THP-1 cells, and the ability of the H5N1 pseudotyped virus to infect B-THP-1/DC-SIGN cells was reduced when the cells were pre-treated with an anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibody. Similar results were observed using the combination of THP-1 and THP-1/DC-SIGN cell lines (data not shown). To rule out the possibility that enhanced infectivity was due to differential expression levels of avian influenza viruses that bind only to the a 2 , 3 -l i n ke d a-2,3-linked SA receptor, both cell lines were stained with SNA and MAA. As shown in Fig. 2B -1 B-1 and -2, both cell lines had identical distributions of a-2,3and a-2,6-linked SA receptors. To clarify whether DC-SIGN is a receptor that mediates the entry of H5N1 pseudotyped viral particles or if it simply enhances viral entry via SA receptors, we used vibrio cholerae sialidase to eliminate a-2,3-linked SA from the cells. Our results show that almost all of the a-2,3-linked SA was removed but DC-SIGN levels remained unchanged (Fig. 2B -3 ) . B-3) . Following treatment with sialidase, B-THP-1 and B-THP-1/DC-SIGN cells were incubated with H5N1 pseudotyped viral particles; we detected very low luminescence levels in the resulting cell lysates (data not shown). This strongly suggests that H5N1 pseudotyped viral particles interact with DC-SIGN and facilitate viral entry into target cells in cis via SA receptors. Transmission electron microscopy images demonstrate the attachment of many H5N1 pseudotyped viral particles to the surfaces of cells expressing DC-SIGN (Fig. 2C) ; indirect immunofluorescent antibody assay (IFA) results further indicate a colocalization between H5N1 pseudotyped particles and DC-SIGN (Fig. 2D) . In addition to transmission electron microscopy and IFA colocalized staining, we also used HIV p24 quantification to study the binding of H5N1 pseudotyped virus particles to DC-SIGN, and found that p24 antigen levels in the cell lysates of DC-SIGN-expressing cells were significantly higher than those in the B-THP-1 and THP-1 control cells. Furthermore, p24 levels were reduced in the presence of anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibodies, with inhibition percentages of 23% and 28% for B-THP-1/DC-SIGN and THP-1/DC-SIGN cells, respectively (Table 1) . These results are similar to those found in a previous report on HCV pseudotyped virus binding to DC-SIGN [ 33 ] ; [14] ; those authors reported that the anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibody (MAb 612X) had a 19 -41 % 19-41% inhibitory effect on HCV pseudotyped virus binding to DC-SIGN.",

Compared to immature DCs (iDCs), mature DCs (mDCs) expressed higher percentages of CD80, CD83, and CD86 cell markers (Supplementary Fig. 2A ) and displayed both multiple pseudopods and irregular morphologies ( Supplementary Fig. 2B ); iDCs also expressed higher levels of DC-SIGN than mDCs (Supplementary Fig. 2A) . Furthermore, the morphologies of both mDCs and iDCs changed dramatically 24 h post-infection with H5N1 pseudotyped viruses. At 48 h postinfection, both mDCs and iDCs adhered to the bottom of culture plates (Fig. 3B ). Following incubation with the H5N1 pseudotyped virus at 4 \u00b0C for 1h r, h, DCs were co-cultured with MDCK cells and the resulting luciferase activity of MDCK lysates was measured. The results show that iDCs had a significantly higher capture ability compared to mDCs, and that this effect can be blocked by pre-treatment with anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 3C ). Based on these findings, we conclude that iDCs play an important role in the dissemination of H5N1 pseudotyped virus infection due to its ability to capture and transfer viral infections to target cells. Finally, we used H5N1 A/Vietnam/1194/04 reverse-genetics (RG) virus particles to confirm the phenomenon described in this study. As shown in Supplementary Fig. 1 , B-THP-1/DC-SIGN cells had significantly higher copy numbers of H5N1 RG viruses than B-THP-1 cells 48 h post-infection (lanes 1 and 2, p < 0.05). Infection was significantly blocked when cells were pre-treated with anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibodies (lane 4). Results from a capture assay show that compared to the B-THP-1 control, the B-THP-1/ DC-SIGN cells captured and transferred significantly higher numbers of H5N1 RG viruses to MDCK cells, and that the effect can be blocked by anti-DC-SIGN monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 3D) . According to these results, DC-SIGN is capable of mediating H5N1 RG virus infection in cis and in trans.",

            "text": "We found evidence indicating that DC-SIGN does not function as a main entry receptor in the same manner as a-2,3-linked SA for the avian H5N1 virus, but instead acts as a capture or attachment molecule for the virus and as an infection mediating factor both in cis and in trans. Thitithanyanont et al. [20] previously showed that DCs express both a-2,3-linked and a-2,6-linked SA, and that H5N1 viruses are capable of escaping viral-specific immunity and dissemination to other organs through infection and replication in DCs. There are several existing reports indicating that iDCs and mDCs differ in viral infection susceptibility-for example, in HIV-1 and SARS CoV [21, 22] . Consistent with these studies, we found that iDCs had higher capture and transfer capabilities than mDCs. Thitithanyanont et al. [20] also demonstrated that 24 h postinfection with the avian H5N1 virus, the majority of DCs died at a very low MOI. Our results indicate that the H5N1 pseudotyped virus induced extensive activation of iDCs and mDCs after 48 h of incubation, but mDCs showed lower susceptibility to the H5N1 virus. Our results also imply that a reduction in DC-SIGN expression may lead to the phenomenon described in this report. Based on our findings, we suggest that iDCs residing in the lower respiratory tract or deep lung compartments are susceptible to H5N1 virus infection via the a-2,3-linked SA receptor and DC-SIGN. Infected iDCs then migrate to lymphoid tissues and other organs and transfer the H5N1 virus to other target cells expressing a-2,3-linked SA receptors, resulting in a systemic infection. Another recently published study suggests that CD4+ T-cells may be an important target for H5N1 virus infection [23] .",
