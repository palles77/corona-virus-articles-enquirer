            "text": "Numerous microorganisms produce lectins of different kinds that are specific for animal cell surface carbohydrates. 1, 2 In viruses, the lectins occur as membrane constituents, in bacteria they are generally present on the cell surface, often as submicroscopic multisubunit surface appendages known as fimbriae or pili, and occasionally in intracellular soluble form, while in protozoa they are constituents of the cell envelope. Most of these lectins serve to tether the organisms to a substratum (e.g., soil bacteria to clays or marine bacteria to corals) in order to better access nutrients, escape deleterious agents, and withstand cleansing. In animals, they serve for the attachment (or adhesion) of the microorganisms to host tissues or cells, a prerequisite for infection, and are therefore among the virulence factors of the microorganisms. Detailed knowledge of the specificity and combining sites of these lectins is of importance not only for the understanding of a basic mechanism conserved throughout evolution, but also for the development of powerful inhibitors of the lectins for blocking microbial adhesion to tissues. This is the aim of antiadhesion therapy of microbial diseases. 3, 4 Most of the microbial lectins have only been poorly characterized. Their existence and specificity have been inferred primarily from inhibition experiments, in which the effect of different carbohydrates is examined on adhesion of the organisms to animal cells or on the agglutination of erythrocytes or other kinds of cell, such as yeasts. 1,2 Specificity for the carbohydrate of glycolipids or glycoproteins is usually assessed by binding of the bacterial lectins to these glycoconjugates separated on thin layer chromatograms or on blots of gel electrophoresis, respectively. Recently, the application of glycan microarrays for specificity studies of viral and bacterial lectins has been described. 5,6 In a few cases, the specificity and association constants of carbohydrates to the isolated lectins have been measured by physicochemical techniques, for example, by surface plasmon resonance. 64 Binding of carbohydrates to lectins, including those of microbial sources, is generally characterized by a low affinity for monovalent ligands, a drawback balanced by multivalency, which provides high avidity for complex glycans or cell surfaces. In general, millimolar affinity is observed for lectin binding to monosaccharides, although cases of lectins 623 with micromolar affinities are known. 7 When oligosaccharides act as ligands, corresponding to an extended binding site on the lectins, increased affinity up to the micromolar range can be observed. These interactions are typified by a favorable enthalpy term, due to the high number of hydrogen bonds that is offset by an unfavorable entropy contribution, attributed either to solvent rearrangement or loss of ligand conformational flexibility.",

The amino acids that form the combining sites are not necessarily contiguous, and are brought together in space by the folding of the polypeptide chain. Changes in the spatial position of the amino acid residues may occur upon binding of the carbohydrate, bringing them to an orientation which improves stereocomplementarity with the ligand. The fit between the binding site on the protein and the carbohydrate is also affected by the shape of the ligand. Oligosaccharides are flexible molecules with considerable freedom of rotation around the glycosidic bonds connecting the individual monosaccharide constituents. As a result, they may assume different shapes, only one of which may fit the combining sites.",

Swine influenza viruses bind sialic acid in a2-6 and sometimes also a2-3 linkages, and sialic acid in both linkages is detected in porcine tracheae.

The hemagglutinin is a glycoprotein, with six N-linked oligosaccharides attached to HA1 and one to HA2. One of these glycans is an oligomannoside, while the others are complex bi-or triantennary structures, several of which contain sulfated galactose. X-ray crystallography showed that the hemagglutinin subunit consists of a hydrophilic, C-terminal domain, a hydrophobic membrane spanning region of 24-28 residues, an elongated triple-helical coiled stem, and a globular domain projecting 135\u00c5 from the membrane. The globular domain consists of HA1 only, and contains the carbohydrate-binding site of the lectin. The subunits associate noncovalently to form trimers. The affinity of the hemagglutinin of the influenza virus for its receptor is downregulated by the two N-linked oligosaccharides attached to Asn123 and Asn129 in the vicinity of the combining site. 25 Thus, a mutant hemagglutinin devoid of these oligosaccharides bound to human erythrocytes much more strongly than the native lectin.",

An understanding of how these changes occur, and a better insight into the combining sites of the HAs, have been provided by the recent study of John Skehel and co-workers of the structures of HAs from the 1918 pandemic virus (1918-human) with the use of HA expressed from the DNA recovered from tissues infected with virus in 1918 and from the prototype human (1934-human) and swine (1930-swine) H1 influenza viruses. 27 Overall structure and receptor binding subdomain. The overall trimeric structures of the HAs of the three H1 viruses (1918-human, 1934-human, and 1930-swine) HAs are similar ( Figure 2 ), but they show notable differences to HAs of other subtypes with respect to the arrangements of the receptor-binding subdomain among others, both within the HA trimer and also within individual monomers. The receptor-binding sites are located as in other influenza A virus HAs at the membrane-distal tip of each subunit of the HA trimer. Three secondary structure elements, the 190 helix (residues 190-198) , the 130 loop (residues 135-138), and the 220 loop (residues 221-228), form the sides of each site, with the base made up of the conserved residues Tyr98, Trp153, His183, and Tyr195. The conformations adopted by the 130 and 220 loops of the three H1 HAs are similar, but they are significantly different from those of the equivalent loops in the HAs of other influenza subtypes (Figures 2b, 3, and 4 ). As observed with other HAs, the terminal sialic acids of the human and avian receptors interact with binding site residues through a series of conserved hydrogen bonds to the carboxyl and amide of the sialic acid ( Figure 3) . The 1934-human HA/human receptor complex. The electron density maps reveal well-ordered features for the Sia-1, Gal-2, and GlcNAc-3 of the sialopentasaccharide (the numbers in bold refer to the positions of the monosaccharides in the ligand) in this complex (Figure 3a) . Gal-2 forms five hydrogen bonds that have not been previously observed in other HA/receptor complexes. Four bonds are possible between the 2-and 3-hydroxyls of Gal-2 and the side chains of Lys222 and Asp225, and a fifth between the 4-hydroxyl of Gal-2 and the main-chain amide of 227 that is mediated by a water molecule.",

The side-chain carbonyl of Gln226 forms a hydrogen bond with the 4-hydroxyl of Gal-2, as observed in other HA/avian receptor complexes. In addition, there is a previously unknown water-mediated interaction between the 4-hydroxyl of Gal-2, the main-chain carbonyl of residue 225, and the side chain of Lys222 (Figure 3b ). The 1930-swine HA/human receptor complex. The sialic acid of the receptor is located similarly in the 1930-swine and 1934-human HA receptor binding sites, but in the 1930 swine complex all five saccharides of the receptor analog are detected ( Figure 3c ). Lys222 again forms hydrogen bonds with the 2-and 3-hydroxyls of Gal-2, although in the present case this residue sits higher in the binding site. Asp190 hydrogen bonds to the amino nitrogen of GlcNAc-3, Ser193 hydrogen bonds to the 2-hydroxyl of Gal-4, and there is a water-mediated interaction between Thr189 and GlcNAc-5. The last three interactions have not been observed before in HA receptor complexes. In addition, the sialopentasaccharide exits the binding site in an orientation not previously seen, crossing the 190 helix near its N-terminus, about parallel to the threefold symmetry axis of the HA trimer.",

            "text": "The 1930-swine HA/avian receptor complex. The electron density for the avian receptor analog bound to the 1930swine HA is weak and mainly represents the sialic acid moiety (Figure 3d) . A similar situation was observed for an H5 avian HA in complex with a human receptor analog, where only a subset of the atoms for the sialic acid could be located. These observations probably reflect the low affinity of the HAs for their respective ligands, consistent with the preference of the 1930-swine virus for human receptor in hemagglutination assays. Human receptor complexes. Complexes of the human receptor analog bound to 1934-human HA (green) and 1930swine HA (blue) and to human H3 HA (red) are superimposed in Figure 4a . Perhaps the most important feature of this comparison is the difference in structure adopted by the 130 and 220 loops of the receptor-binding site between Figure 3 Interactions of 1934-human HA (top) and 1930-swine HA (bottom) with human receptor and with avian receptor analogs. The view of the receptor binding site is about the same as in Figure 2b . The three secondary structure components of the binding site are labeled in this backbone representation together with some of the most relevant side chains. The broken lines indicate potential hydrogen bond interactions between the protein and the receptors; residues making interactions via main-chain carbonyl groups are shown as red spheres, whereas those interacting via main-chain nitrogens are shown as blue spheres. In all four panels, the sialosaccharides are colored yellow for carbon atoms, blue for nitrogen, and red for oxygen. the H1 and H3 HAs. One consequence of the change in the 130-loop structure is that the sialic acid of the receptor is tilted about 10 into the receptor-binding sites of the H1 HAs. This effect, together with different orientations about the glycosidic bond, contributes to Gal-2 being located almost 2\u00c5 lower in the H1 HAs than in the human H3 HAs. Gal-2 is able to adopt this position because structural differences in the 220 loop locate Gln226 lower in the binding site than the equivalent Leu226 of human H3 HA. Consequently, in the H1 HAs, Gal-2 is located closer to the 220 loop and is able to form hydrogen bonds with Lys222. In the case of the 1934-human HA, Gal-2 also interacts with Asp225. Thus, a combination of factors relating to the structure of the 130 and 220 loops enable the H1 HAs to make favorable hydrogen bond interactions with Gal-2 of the human receptor. Gln226 plays an essentially passive role in this process, in marked contrast to the role played by Leu226 in the binding of human H3 HA to human receptor. In that case, Gal-2 makes hydrophobic contacts with Leu226, and the higher position and the nature of this side chain are important for human receptor binding. Avian receptor complexes. Complexes of avian receptor analogs with 1934-human HA (green), 1930-swine HA (blue), and an avian H3 HA (red) are overlaid in Figure 4b . Again, the differences in the structure of the 130 loop between the H1 and H3 HAs result in the sialic acid of the avian receptor being located lower in the receptor binding site of the H1 HAs. Comparison of the 1934-human and avian H3 complexes also reveals that Gal-2 of the avian receptor is located about 1\u00c5 lower in the binding site of the H1 complex, as is Gln226. In both complexes, the 4-hydroxyl of Gal-2 hydrogen bonds with the side-chain carbonyl of Gln226 (Figure 4b) , and the coordinated differences in position of the bound receptor and Gln226 enable this interaction to be conserved. It seems therefore that the 1934-human HA is able to bind the avian receptor in a manner reminiscent of avian HAs, with Gln226 playing a key role.",

It has been suggested that the 1930-swine HA binds less effectively to avian receptors than the 1934-human HA because the position adopted by Gln226 in 1934-human HA is about 1\u00c5 higher in its complex with the avian receptor than it is either in the human receptor complex or in the uncomplexed form ( Figure 5 ). By contrast, the position of Gln226 in 1930-swine HA is about the same as uncomplexed and in the human and avian receptor complexes. The apparent inability of Gln226 to adopt a higher position in the receptor-binding site seems to explain the failure of 1930-swine HA to interact as effectively with the avian receptor. This explanation is supported by the structural observation that in the 1934-human HA complex with avian receptor Glu190 interacts through two water molecules with Gln226 ( Figure 5 ). This network of hydrogen bonds may be necessary to position Gln226 in the binding site for its interaction with Gal-2. Glu190 is conserved in avian H1 HAs, all of which specifically bind a2-3-linked receptors. By contrast, residue 190 of 1930-swine HA is an aspartic acid, which does not interact with either the 9-hydroxyl of Sia-1 or Gln226 and is thus unable to facilitate binding to avian receptor. Irrespective of the single amino acid difference of Asp or Gly at residue 225 between the sequences of 1918-human HAs, by recognizing human receptors, all would fulfill the first requirement of an epidemic virus: the ability to spread in the human population. The importance of this requirement was emphasized in the 1997 outbreak of H5 'chicken' influenza in Hong Kong, when the virus was extremely virulent but did not acquire the ability to bind 2-6-linked sialosides and was therefore unable to spread. With the ability to ensure the efficiency of the initial stages of virus infection, coupled with novel antigenicity, the human-1918 HA may have been the prime determinant of extensive mortality in the 1918 pandemic.",

This conformation was presumed not to be representative of natural receptors because of the presence of glucose rather than N-acetylglucosamine at position 3 and the lack of glycosylation beyond this position. The mode of Sia2-6Lac binding, however, further demonstrates the plasticity of the HA receptor binding site in accommodating oligosaccharides in different conformations. By contrast, Sia2-6Lac binds in a manner very similar to that of the pentasaccharide, LSTa, again suggesting that there is no role in avian receptor binding for the saccharides beyond GlcNAc-3. It is therefore possible that some avian HAs are capable of binding sialic acid in a2-6 linkage to galactose, but are not capable of infecting humans because the saccharides beyond GlcNAc-3 sterically clash with the HA. For an avian HA to change its binding specificity from avian to human receptors may therefore involve two sorts of changes, the first, to allow binding of the a2-6-linkage, either via mutation of Gln226 to Leu226 as in H2 and H3 HAs or via a specific positioning of Gln226 as in H1, and the second, to accommodate the additional saccharides linked to Gal-2 in the natural receptor side chain.

It consists of a 65kDa N-terminal subunit HEF1 and a 30kDa C-terminal subunit HEF2 that is membrane anchored. Despite an overall primary sequence identity of only 11%, the similarity between the three-dimensional (3-D) structure of HEF and the hemagglutinin is astounding ( Figure 6 ). 16, 28, 29 The main differences are within the N-terminal subunits, which form the globular part of the spikes and which, in the case of HEF, contain the receptor-binding R and RDE esterase domains. The C-terminal HEF2 subunit, together with segments of HEF1, comprises the fusion domain F. In the trimer, HEF2 subunits constitute the elongated membrane-anchored stalk, at the core of which long central helices form a triple-stranded interphase. Each HEF1 subunit contains two sites that can accommodate Neu5,9Ac 2 . The actual receptor-binding sites are cavities at the tip of the globular head domain with Tyr127, Thr170, and Gly172 involved in ligand binding. Interaction with the 9-O-acetyl group, the most critical determinant for receptor recognition, is mediated among others by the hydroxyl group of Tyr224 and the guanido group of Arg236, which contact the acetyl carbonyl oxygen. Moreover, Phe225, Phe293, and Pro271 form a nonpolar pocket into which the acetyl methyl group can be fitted ( Figure 7) . The importance of the latter site for receptor recognition is underlined by the observations that mutations of residues adjacent to Pro271 (Asp269Asn, Thr270Leu or Ile, and Thr272Ile) are associated with increased binding efficiency to Neu5,9Ac 2 receptors.",

The affinity of different phenotypes of E. coli type 1 or of the isolated fimbriae to mannose or MeaMan may differ within a factor of 15 and they can be functionally subdivided into either low-mannose-binding (M1L) or high-mannosebinding (M1H) phenotypes. 43 E. coli exhibiting these two basic phenotypes have been found to predominate in different niches. Most isolates from the large intestine of healthy humans (c. 80%) express a distinct M1L phenotype, whereas most isolates from urinary tract infections (>70%) express M1H variants. These naturally occurring variations dramatically change the tissue tropism of E. coli and can be a major factor in shifting the bacterial adaptation from commensal to pathologic habitats, a phenomenon known as pathoadaptation. 44 Typically, type 1 fimbriae of E. coli have a considerably higher affinity (up to 40 times as compared to mannose) for oligosaccharides such as Mana3-Manb4GlcNAc or Mana6(Mana3)Mana6(Mana3)Man that are constituents of cell surface glycoproteins. 45 In the urinary tract, the fimbriae mediate binding of the bacteria to the oligomannosides Man 9 GlcNAc 2 to Man 6 GlcNAc 2 of uroplakin Ia, a major glycoprotein of urothelial apical plaques. 46, 47 Anchorage of E. coli to the urothelial surface via type 1 fimbriae-uroplakin I interactions may play a role in their colonization of the bladder and eventual ascent through the ureters, against urine flow, to invade the kidneys.",

            "text": "Structurally, the fimbriae are 1-2mm long and 7nm thick fibers, that are rod like, made up largely of repeating immunoglobulin-like FimA subunits (m.w. 17kDa) arranged helically in a structure referred to as 'shaft' (Figure 16) . 48, 49 The shaft is joined to a short 3nm thick distal tip fibrillum that consists of two adapter proteins, FimF and FimG, and a third of a different kind, FimH (m.w. 29-31kDa). The latter is the only subunit that possesses a carbohydrate-binding site and is thus responsible for the sugar-binding activity of the fimbriae. 50 FimH is also present in small numbers at intervals along the fimbrial filament, but only the subunit at the tip appears to be able to mediate mannose-specific adhesive interactions, whereas the subunits at the other positions are inaccessible to the carbohydrate ligand. 51 Minor sequence variations in FimH alleles from different clinical isolates have been shown to correlate with altered carbohydrate-binding profiles of the fimbriae. 44 The FimH subunits of E. coli and K. pneumoniae are 88% homologous. Still, the two organisms differ in their fine specificity, for example, in their relative affinity for Mana3Manb4GlcNAc and p-nitrophenyl a-mannoside. [52] [53] [54] Other aromatic a-mannosides are also high-affinity ligands (up to 1000 times stronger than MeaMan) for E. coli type 1, suggesting the presence of a hydrophobic binding region next to the monosaccharide-combining site of FimH. With several Salmonella species examined, aromatic a-mannosides, as well as the trisaccharide Mana2Manb4GlcNAc, were weaker inhibitors than MeaMan. The combining site of Salmonella species appears thus to be smaller than that of E. coli and K. pneumoniae, and to be devoid of an adjoining hydrophobic region. Different combining sites were found in other mannose-specific bacterial lectins. Therefore, although classified together on the basis of their monosaccharide (primary) specificity, these lectins differ in their fine specificity. Swapping experiments with genetically engineered hybrid fimbriae, in which the FimH of one species (e.g., E. coli) was presented on the shaft of the other species (K. pneumoniae), have shown that the shaft plays a role in modulating the specificity of fimbriae, probably by imposing conformational constraints on the carbohydrate-binding subunit. 55 The first 3-D structure of a fimbrial carbohydrate-binding subunit to be solved was that of FimH in complex with the FimC chaperone (see below) to which the mannose analog cyclohexylbutanoyl-N-hydroxyethyl-D-glucamide was bound. 56 FimH is seen folded into two all-b class domains connected by a short extended linker ( Figure 17 ). One of these, located in the N-terminal half of the subunit (residues 1-156), is the lectin domain, with the mannose-binding site at its tip. The C-terminal half (residues 160-279), known as the pilin domain, serves to anchor the subunit to the fimbriae. It binds in the cleft of FimC, although there is only limited contact between FimH and the C-terminal domain of the chaperone. The carbohydrate recognition domain of FimH is an 11-stranded elongated b-barrel with a jellyroll-like topology, while the pilin domain has an immunoglobulin fold that lacks the seventh (C-terminal) b-strand present in the canonical immunoglobulin fold. In the FimC-FimH complex, the missing b-strand is donated by the seventh strand of the N-terminal domain of the chaperone to complete the immunoglobulin-like fold of FimH. This kind of 'donor strand complementation' is thought to initiate folding of FimH directly on the chaperone, thus accounting for the function of the latter in biogenesis of the fimbriae. 57 The 3-D structure of the FimC-FimH in complex with bound mannose has also been elucidated by X-ray crystallography. 58 Although mannose exists in solution as a mixture of aand b-anomers, only the former was found in the crystal (Figure 18 ). It is buried at a deep and negatively charged site at the edge of FimH, opposite to the region through which the latter combines with the chaperone. All the mannose hydroxyls, except the anomeric one, interacted extensively with combining site residues, almost all of which are situated at the ends of b-strands or in the loops extending from them. Part of the hydrogen-bonding network is identical to that found in mannose complexes of other lectins. Thus, Asp54 makes cooperative hydrogen bonds with the 4-and 6-OH and Asn140 with the 3-and 4-OH of the ligand, similar to those made by the equivalent residues with the same sugar in the combining sites of legume lectins with the same primary specificity. 59 In addition, the N-terminal amine of the FimH polypeptide is H-bonded to the 2-OH, 6-OH, and the ring oxygen of the mannose. 58 This is one of the rare cases in which an N-terminal amine of a protein participates in ligand binding. Phe142 of FimH interacts hydrophobically with the C2-C3 bond of the mannose. The same residue, together with Ile13, Tyr 48, and Ile52, form part of a hydrophobic ridge that surrounds the site and which may help to direct the ligand into it. Site-directed mutagenesis showed that combining site residues Asp54, Gln133, Asn135, and Asp140 are essential for carbohydrate binding by FimH, since their replacement by alanine, asparagine, or aspartic acid resulted in complete loss of this activity.",

It is likely that the hydrophobic character of the ridge of the mannose-binding site of FimH distinguishes E. coli type 1 fimbriae from those of Salmonella species that neither exhibit an increased affinity for mannose with hydrophobic substituents nor for the oligomannosides mentioned earlier. Nearly all mutations in the combining site of FimH abolished or decreased its binding not only to mannose, but also to urinary epithelial cells, indicating that the site may be highly conserved. 44, 61 Support for this conclusion comes from the finding that there are very few variations in the sequences of the mannose-binding site of over 200 uropathogenic strains of E. coli examined, in contrast to enterohemorrhagic strains of E. coli, in which there are sequence variations at this site. 61 On the other hand, replacement of residues 185-279 within the FimH pilin domain with a corresponding segment of the type 1C fimbrial subunit FocH has led to a loss of the multivalent mannotriose-specific binding property accompanied by the acquisition of a distinct mannose-specific (i.e., monovalent, M1H) binding capability. Bacteria expressing the monovalent hybrid FimH were capable of binding strongly to uroepithelial tissue culture cells and guinea pig erythrocytes. They could not, however, agglutinate yeasts or bind human buccal cells, functions readily accomplished by the E. coli expressing mannotriose-specific FimH variants. Based on the relative potency of inhibitory compounds of different structures, it was concluded that the receptor-binding site within the monovalent FimH-FocH subunit has an extended structure with an overall configuration similar to that within the multivalent FimH of natural origin. Another class of high-affinity ligand for type 1 fimbriated E. coli are mannose-derived neoglycoproteins and dendrimers (see Chapter 3.23 ). 61a The former are proteins to which varying numbers of a-mannose residues are covalently attached, while the latter are multifunctional spherical branched polymers of well-defined molecular size that carry large numbers of such residues on their surface.",

The presence of a hydrophobic group on the anomeric position of the monosaccharide, either in aor b-configuration, enhances the affinity, as observed with other lectins, such as E. coli type 1 fimbriae, with the tightest binding obtained for phenyl b-thiogalactoside. As for disaccharides, only those containing a terminal a-galactose residue are recognized, such as Gala3Gal, Gala4Gal, and Gala6Glc, to which the lectin displays the highest affinity; PA-IL binds also to a large number of glycoconjugates. 72, 73 The latter include compounds containing terminal unsubstituted Gala4Gal disaccharide, that is, the human P1 and Pk blood group antigens, present on either red blood cell glycosphingolipids or on pigeon egg white glycoproteins, as well as Gala3Gal, the human B blood group antigen, and the xenoantigen present on pig tissues. PA-IIL is characterized by an unusually high affinity for L-fucose, with a K a of 1.6\u00c210 6 M -1 and binds the Le a trisaccharide [Galb3(Fuca4)GlcNAc] more strongly, with a K a of 4.7\u00c210 6 M \u00c01 . 7, 74 Thermodynamic studies indicate that these interactions are dominated by enthalpy.

The high-resolution X-ray structures of two complexes of PA-IIL with Le a and LNnFP-V (lacto-N-neofucopentaose-5, Galb4GlcNAcb4(Fuca3)Galb4Glc), allowed the precise determination of the conformation of a trisaccharide and a pentasaccharide (see later, Figure 28 ).

Such a protein-carbohydrate binding mode involving two calcium ions has never been observed before ( Figure 27 ). Three hydroxyl groups of fucose participate in the coordination of those calcium ions: O2 to the first calcium, O4 to the second calcium, and O3 to both of them. In addition to these electrostatic interactions, the three hydroxyl groups of the monosaccharide participate in hydrogen bonds with acidic groups of the calcium-binding site. The ring oxygen of fucose is involved in one hydrogen bond with the main chain, resulting altogether in a network of seven direct hydrogen bonds between the Analysis of the mode of binding of Le a by PA-IIL revealed a large number of contacts between the sugar and the protein ( Figure 28 ). All monosaccharide units of the trisaccharide interact with the protein surface either directly (hydrogen bonding and coordination of calcium) or indirectly through bridging water molecules. In addition to the nine direct hydrogen bonds between the fucose of Le a and the protein described, the GlcNAc residue establishes a hydrogen bond between its O6 atom and the main-chain carbonyl group of Asp96. Two water molecules play an important bridging role in the interaction: one bridges O1 and O2 of fucose to the amide nitrogen of Thr98, whereas the other bridges the Gal residue (O2 and O1) to the side chain of Ser23. Hydrophobic contacts are very limited and only involve the methyl group of fucose with that of Thr145. The conformation adopted by Le a in the binding site is similar to that predicted by those earlier studies, confirming the rigidity of the trisaccharide. Among the four independent molecules of the PA-IIL-LNnFP-V complex, clear electron density can be observed for two complete pentasaccharides ( Figure 28 ), whereas only a tetrasaccharide and a trisaccharide can be located for the two remaining sites. The fact that two of the oligosaccharides can be completely visualized is due the rigidity of their linear part resulting from fortuitous crystal packing that generates extensive contacts between two adjacent sugars centered on a pseudo twofold axis of symmetry (Figure 28c) . It is this interaction that allows the very highresolution structure of milk pentasaccharide to be described here for the first time. The protein-binding site, together with the calcium ions and fucose moiety, are identical with those described previously. Additional interactions with the protein surface are established by the glucose and galactose residues of the Le x glucose analog moiety (Figure 28b) . The glucose establishes a direct hydrogen bond between its hydroxyl group at position 2 and the side chain of Asp-96. In addition, five interactions are mediated by a water molecule, involving O1 of fucose, O1 and O6 of glucose, and O1, O2, and O6 of galactose. Hydrophobic interactions are observed for the methyl group of fucose, but also for C6 of galactose, which interacts with the carbon of a glycerol molecule located at the protein surface. The other part of the pentasaccharide, that is, the Glcb4GlcNAc linked to position 3 of galactose, does not interact with the protein surface, but instead is involved in extensive interactions with the neighboring carbohydrate in the crystal lattice ( Figure 28c) .",

They do not seem to be related evolutionarily, even though they both adopt a jellyroll fold and they both use calcium for carbohydrate binding. In PA-IL, calcium, together with a unique network of hydrogen bonds, generates a binding site endowed with a selective specificity for galactose. In contrast, in PA-IIL, the two calcium ions are associated with a very high affinity (micromolar range) and a wide specificity for binding different monosaccharides. The occurrence of metal ions in lectins is well known. Carbohydrate binding by legume lectins depends on the presence of manganese and calcium ions, whose main role is to maintain the architecture of the binding site and not to make contacts with the sugar ligand. Direct calcium-sugar interactions have been observed in only two families of animal lectins: pentraxins and C-type lectins. The first family includes serum amyloid P component (SAP) and C-reactive protein (CRP), which contain two close calcium ions involved in binding of diverse ligands. The lectin activity of SAP differs from that of PA-IIL, since it is only directed to sulfated or phosphorylated carbohydrates. Despite the lack of sequence or fold similarity, the galactose-binding mode of PA-IL shows a striking resemblance to those of two C-type animal lectins complexed with galactose, that is, the QPDWG mutant of rat mannose-binding protein A and the tunicate galactosespecific C-type lectin, TC14, from Polyandrocarpa misakiens. 7, 78 Nevertheless, in PA-IL, the occurrence of an additional strong interaction with the galactose O6 group can explain the 10-fold higher galactose affinity compared to that of the C-type animal lectins.",

The binding loop of the cations is fully conserved in RS-IIL as in PA-IIL, whereas the preference for mannose versus fucose can be attributed to the change of a three-amino-acid sequence in the 'specificity loop'. The RS-IIL crystal contains one monomer of 113 amino acids per asymmetric unit, together with two Ca 2\u00fe ions and one MeaMan molecule ( Figure 30) . The overall topology of RS-IIL is that of a nine-stranded antiparallel b-sandwich consisting of two sheets of four and five strands respectively. In the tetrameric quaternary structure, one interface between two monomers is created by strong complementary packing of the one hydrophobic curved b-sheet to its counterpart, and the other interface is created via sheet extension ( Figure 30 ). Both monomeric and tetrameric structures are very similar to those described in detail for several crystal structures of PA-IIL. 77, 78 The binding site is occupied by two Ca 2\u00fe ions and a mannose residue. The two ions are located close together, 3.75\u00c5 , and both display a classical seven-ligand coordination, mainly involving one loop, the conserved 'calcium-binding loop', via the side chains of Glu94, Asp98, Asp100, Asn102, and Asp103. A second loop is involved through the side chain of Asn21. In addition, the acidic group of the C-terminus Gly113 of the other monomer, which is involved in the head-totail interaction, also participates in the coordination of the Ca 2\u00fe ions. All amino acids of the calcium-binding site are strictly conserved between PA-IIL and RS-IIL, and the Ca 2\u00fe ions are bound in a similar manner.",

The O3, O4, and O6 hydroxyl groups of mannose are involved in hydrogen bonds with acidic amino acids of the calcium-binding loop extending from Glu94 to Asp103. The O2 hydroxyl group establishes hydrogen bonds with the backbone oxygen of Asn21 as well as with the C-terminus from the adjacent monomer. The ring oxygen O5 receives a hydrogen bond from the backbone nitrogen of Ala23. One water molecule makes an additional interaction by bridging between O4 and the backbone nitrogen of Thr97. Hydrophobic contacts appear to be very limited: only the methyl group of the MeaMan ligand is in relatively close position to Ala23. The comparison with the binding mode of mannose in PA-IIL shows similar contacts except in the region of O6. Figure 31 Structure of the N-linked undecasaccharide Man 9 GlcNAc 2 (Man(9)) where the outer mannose residues are labeled as D1, D2, and D3. In the corresponding decasaccharide (Man (8) they do not form, however, separate domains, since the overall fold is dependent on numerous contacts between them. Rather, two symmetrically related domains are formed by strand exchange between the two repeats. Among the properties of CVN is its ability to block HIV envelope-mediated fusion. The affinity of oligosaccharide ligands to CVN was measured by their ability to inhibit the fusion-blocking activity of CVN in an HIV fusion assay. By this assay, it was found that CVN binds to gp120 with an equilibrium association constant K a of 2.4\u00c210 7 M -1 and an apparent stoichiometry of 2 equiv. of CVN per gp120; Man(8) acts as a divalent ligand (2 CVN:1 saccharide) with a K a of 5.4\u00c210 7 M -1 , and Man(9) functions as a trivalent ligand (3 CVN:1 saccharide) with a K a of 1.3\u00c210 8 M -1 . Isothermal titration calorimetry experiments of CVN binding to Man(9) confirmed the nanomolar affinity of K a of 1.5\u00c210 8 M -1 , and the fitted data indicated a stoichiometry equal to approximately 1:1 CVN:Man(9).",

The high-affinity site has a K a of 7.2\u00c210 6 M -1 and the low-affinity site a K a of 6.8\u00c210 5 M -1 , as determined by isothermal titration calorimetry. The specificity studies indicated that the minimum structure required for high-affinity binding comprises the Mana2Mana that represents the terminal disaccharide of all three arms of Man (9) . High-resolution NMR experiments demonstrate that CVN binds the above disaccharide via two distinct binding sites of differing affinities located on opposite ends of the protein. 83 Further NMR analysis of the solution structure of a complex of CVN-Mana2Mana at a molar ratio 1:2 revealed that the lectin recognizes the stacked conformation of the disaccharide through a deep hydrophilic-binding pocket on one side of the protein (site 2) and a semicircular cleft on the other (site 1) 85 ( Figure 33 ). With the prominent exception of the C1 hydroxyl group of the reducing mannopyranose ring, the bound disaccharide is positioned so that each hydroxyl group is involved in a direct or water-mediated hydrogen bond to the polar or charged side chains comprising the binding pocket. The approximately 40\u00c5 spacing of the two binding sites provides a simple model for CVN:gp120 binding. The CVN: Mana2Mana complex provides the first high-resolution structure of a mannose-specific protein-carbohydrate complex with nanomolar affinity and presents a new carbohydrate-binding motif, as well as a new class of carbohydrate-binding protein, that facilitates divalent binding via a monomeric protein.",

However, it is is distinct among oligomannose-binding proteins in that it exhibits fine specificity for the Mana6Manb4GlcNAcb4GlcNAc tetrasaccharide core found in N-linked oligomannosides. MVL in solution is a monodisperse homodimer with four independent carbohydrate-binding sites. Each subunit comprises two homologous domains, each consisting of 54 residues with 50% sequence identity between them, connected by a five-residue linker. MVL exhibits no significant sequence similarity to any other known protein family. X-ray crystallography of MVL free and bound to the pentasaccharide Man 3 GlcNAc 2 confirmed that the protein is a homodimer stabilized by an extensive intermolecular interface between monomers 87,88 ( Figure 34 ).
