Another important defense mechanism is the degradative activity of macroautophagy (herein autophagy), mediated by the coordinated action of evolutionarily conserved autophagy proteins (Atg). We show that the Atg5-Atg12/Atg16L1 protein complex, whose prior known function is in autophagosome formation, is required for IFNg-mediated host defense against murine norovirus (MNV) infection. Importantly, the direct antiviral activity of IFNg against MNV in macrophages required Atg5-Atg12, Atg7, and Atg16L1, but not induction of autophagy, the degradative activity of lysosomal proteases, fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes, or the Atg8-processing protein Atg4B. IFNg, via Atg5-Atg12/Atg16L1, inhibited formation of the membranous cytoplasmic MNV replication complex, where Atg16L1 localized. Thus, the Atg5-Atg12/Atg16L1 complex performs a pivotal, nondegradative role in IFNg-mediated antiviral defense, establishing that multicellular organisms have evolved to use portions of the autophagy pathway machinery in a cassette-like fashion for host defense.",

Furthermore, IFNg has direct antiviral activity against many viruses, including single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses (Kimura et al., 1994; Shrestha et al., 2006) . The antiviral role of IFNg likely provides a host counterpoint to the capacity of many viruses to inhibit the antiviral activities of IFNa/b using highly evolved immune evasion strategies. Autophagy and autophagy proteins play important roles in host defense against infection, development, cellular energy homeostasis, and multiple diseases, including cancer and inflammatory bowel disease (Levine et al., 2011) . Since autophagy proteins expressed by macrophages, which are key innate immune cells, have a role in IFNg-mediated resistance to both mycobacteria and the apicomplexan parasite Toxoplasma gondii (Levine et al., 2011; Zhao et al., 2008) , we hypothesized that autophagy proteins also participate in the antiviral activities of IFNg.",

This process requires the ordered activity of protein complexes that induce autophagosome formation, envelopment of specific cargoes or bulk cytoplasm, elongation and closure of autophagosome membranes, fusion of the outer autophagosomal membrane to the lysosome, and degradation of cargo within the autophagosome by lysosomal enzymes active at low pH (Levine et al., 2011) . One protein complex required for autophagy contains Atg16L1 bound to a covalent Atg5-Atg12 conjugate that is generated by the action of Atg7. The known activity of this complex is to promote elongation and closure of the autophagosome via an E3-ligase-like role in the generation of lipidated forms of LC3 (microtubule-associated protein 1 light chain 3, Atg8) family proteins and their localization to the autophagosome membrane (Weidberg et al., 2010; Fujita et al., 2008b) .

Relatively little is known about the mechanisms of host resistance for this important class of pathogens. While human noroviruses have not been cultured efficiently and do not infect small animals, murine norovirus (MNV) can be cultured in macrophages and thus provides a model of infection for this important genus of human pathogens (Glass et al., 2009; Wobus et al., 2004; Karst et al., 2003) . The replication of MNV in macrophages is, as for other singlestranded positive-sense RNA viruses, associated with extensive membrane rearrangements that generate membranous replication complexes within which viral RNAs and proteins are produced and assembled into infectious virions (Hyde et al., 2009; Wobus et al., 2004) . Using the MNV model, we investigated the role of the autophagy pathway and protein components of the autophagy machinery in host antiviral defense. We show here that IFNg-activated macrophages use portions of the autophagy machinery, in a cassette-like fashion, to block norovirus infection by inhibiting formation of the replication complex.",

We first confirmed that mice lacking both IFNa/b and IFNg receptors (IFNa/b/ gR \u00c0/\u00c0 ) succumb to lethal infection with 3 3 10 4 plaque forming units (pfu) of MNV ( Figure 1A ) (Karst et al., 2003; Mumphrey et al., 2007) . In contrast, mice lacking either the IFNa/bR or the IFNgR alone are resistant to lethal MNV infection ( Figure 1A ). These data indicate that IFNa/b and IFNg share overlapping but nonredundant roles in defense against MNV. As for many viruses, the antiviral role of IFNg, and therefore proteins required for IFNg control of MNV infection in vivo, may then be detected when compensatory IFNa/b responses are absent. Atg5 is essential for autophagosome formation and Atg5-deficient mice die soon after birth (Levine et al., 2011) . To test the role of Atg5 in IFNgdependent resistance to MNV infection, we generated IFNa/ bR \u00c0/\u00c0 mice lacking Atg5 in macrophages and neutrophils that express lysozyme M. We crossed Atg5 flox/flox mice expressing lysozyme-M promoter driven cre-recombinase (Atg5 flox/flox +LysMcre) (Zhao et al., 2008; DeSelm et al., 2011) to IFNa/bR \u00c0/\u00c0 mice, generating IFNa/bR \u00c0/\u00c0 x Atg5 flox/flox + LysMcre mice. We then compared MNV infection of IFNa/ bR \u00c0/\u00c0 x Atg5 flox/flox +LysMcre mice to infection of control IFNa/bR \u00c0/\u00c0 x Atg5 flox/flox mice. Mice deficient in Atg5 in macrophages and neutrophils succumbed to lethal MNV infection while control mice did not ( Figure 1B ). While MNV replication is confined to certain tissues (mesenteric lymph node, intestine, spleen, and liver) in immune-competent mice, MNV replication is widely disseminated in immune-compromised mice (Karst et al., 2003; Mumphrey et al., 2007) . Consistent with this, MNV replication was significantly increased in all tissues examined from IFNa/bR \u00c0/\u00c0 x Atg5 flox/flox +LysMcre mice compared to tissues of control IFNa/bR \u00c0/\u00c0 x Atg5 flox/flox mice (Figures S1A-S1F available online). These data demonstrate that Atg5 expression in macrophages and/or neutrophils was essential for control of MNV infection in mice with compromised IFNa/b signaling.",

It has been reported that autophagy protein-deficient but transformed murine fibroblast cells exhibit abnormal IFNg-induced JAK-STAT activation (Chang et al., 2010) . Therefore, we used microarrays to measure transcript levels in control and Atg5-deficient primary macrophages with or without IFNg treatment ( Figure 2 and Table S1 ). While IFNg induced major changes in cellular transcription as expected, no statistically significant differences were observed in the transcriptional profiles induced by IFNg treatment of control and Atg5-deficient macrophages ( Figure 2B ). When evaluating the fold change of induced genes between IFNg treated control and Atg5deficient macrophages, there were some genes that exceeded either the biological relevance threshold [shown on the x axis as log2 (fold-change-ratio) >1 or <\u00c01; indicated by vertical dashed lines] or the statistical significance threshold [shown on the y axis as significance >-log10 (0.05); indicated by horizontal dashed line]. However, none of these genes exceeded both thresholds ( Figure 2B ). These data demonstrate that IFNg-mediated transcriptional modulation in macrophages is not Atg5 dependent. We also considered the possibility that Atg5 deficiency resulted in the general disruption of cell homeostasis or IFNg-mediated activation of macrophages. However, Atg5-deficient macrophages had normal levels of ATP (Figure S2A ), exhibited normal phosphorylation of STAT1 and induction of IRF1 protein ( Figure S2B ), and were able to inhibit the ",

To monitor the flux of the autophagy pathway in response to IFNg, we analyzed the conversion (lipidation) of LC3-I (unconjugated) to LC3-II (conjugated to phosphatidylethanolamine) in the presence and absence of chloroquine. Chloroquine blocks the degradation of LC3-II that occurs after fusion of lysosomes and autophagosomes . Treatment of macrophages with chloroquine led to the accumulation of LC3-II ( Figure S3A ). As a control we showed that the autophagy-inducing drug rapamycin increased the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, and accumulation of LC3-II in combination with chloroquine, in treated cells compared to untreated cells . In contrast, neither high (100 U/ml) nor low (1 U/ml) doses of IFNg affected the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, suggesting that effects of IFNg on MNV replication are not associated with significant changes in bulk autophagy. It has been shown that IFNg induces autophagy in cell lines and that autophagy facilitates IFNg-induced Jak2-STAT1 signaling in specific transformed cell lines by negatively regulating reactive oxygen species (ROS) (Levine et al., 2011; Delgado et al., 2008; Chang et al., 2010) . However, in primary mouse macrophages, we did not detect a significant difference in IFNg signaling in the absence of Atg5 (Figures 2 and S2B ) and IFNg did not significantly induce autophagy ( Figure S3A ). Furthermore, downregulation of ROS using antioxidant treatment (Tal et al., 2009 ) did not effect IFNg-mediated control of MNV replication ( Figure S2C ). This discrepancy between our findings and published data may be due to differences in experimental design or to differences between primary cells and transformed cell lines.",

To analyze the replication of MNV in macrophages within a single replication cycle, we developed a flow cytometry-based assay in which cells were inoculated with MNV (MOI = 5) and stained with an antibody to the MNV polymerase ( Figure S3B ). Treatment of macrophages with rapamycin, chloroquine (blocks lysosomal degradation), or wortmannin (inhibits the initiation of autophagy in nutrient-rich conditions (Wu et al., 2010) either before or after viral infection had the expected effects on autophagy (Figure S3G ) but did not significantly affect MNV replication or its control by IFNg ( Figures 3A and 3B) . To examine the role of later steps in canonical autophagy in antiviral activity mediated by IFNg, we used lentiviral transduction to overexpress a dominant negative form of ras-related protein 7A (Rab7A/T22N), which blocks fusion of autophagosomes and lysosomes, as well as bacterial autophagy (Yamaguchi et al., 2009) . As expected, Rab7/T22N expression inhibited degradative autophagy leading to the accumulation of p62, which is a well-known substrate degraded through autophagy ( Figure S3C ). However, this inhibitor of degradative autophagy did not prevent IFNg-mediated control of MNV replication ( Figures 3E and 3F) . Similarly, inhibitors of lysosomal proteases or lysosomal acidification (E64D/ PepstatinA and BafilomycinA 1 ) blocked the degradative activity of the autophagy pathway ( Figure S3G ) but did not block the antiviral effects of IFNg against MNV ( Figures 3C and 3D ). Further, induction or inhibition of autophagy initiation (starvation, wortmannin, LY294002) also did not significantly affect the IFNgmediated control of MNV replication ( Figures 3C and 3D ). Lastly, protein kinase R (PKR) is involved in autophagic control of herpes simplex virus replication (Levine et al., 2011) , but PKR was not required for IFNg-mediated blockade of MNV replication (Figure S3D) . Taken together, these data demonstrated that, while Atg5 is required for IFNg-mediated inhibition of MNV replication, the degradative autophagy pathways, as well as other pathways known to be involved in the antiviral effects of autophagy, were not involved in the control of MNV replication by IFNg.",

Atg5 functions in autophagy as a covalent conjugate with Atg12. To examine the role of Atg5-Atg12 conjugation, we expressed Atg5/K130R, which cannot be conjugated to Atg12 (Levine et al., 2011) . Expression of Atg5 in Atg5-deficient macrophages significantly restored expression of the Atg5-Atg12 conjugate, the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II, and reduction of p62 level ( Figure 4E ). In contrast, expression of Atg5/K130R generated an unconjugated form of Atg5, did not restore the conversion of LC3-I to LC3-II and increased, rather than decreased, the level of p62. IFNg suppressed the replication of MNV in all lentivirus-transduced control macrophages ( Figures 4A and 4B) . Importantly, while Atg5 reconstituted IFNg control of MNV replication in Atg5-deficient macrophages, Atg5/K130R did not ( Figures 4C and 4D) , In all graphs, data represent mean \u00b1 SEM.

We therefore determined whether the binding of Atg5-Atg12 to Atg16L1 was required for IFNg-mediated control of MNV using two approaches. First, based on the structure of the yeast Atg5 and Atg16L1 complex (Matsushita et al., 2007) , we generated Atg16L1 binding-defective mutants of Atg5. Several single amino acid substitutions in Atg5 (R41A, G84A, D88A, G242A) reduced the binding of Atg5 to Atg16L1, but none of them completely blocked the interaction ( Figure S4B ). Therefore, we made an Atg5/G84A/D88A mutant combining two single amino acid substitutions, and we observed that this mutant exhibited a substantial deficit in Atg16L1 binding ( Figure S4B ). We then tested the effects of two Atg5 mutants, with differing ability to bind Atg16L1, in control and Atg5-deficient macrophages. In control macrophages, neither mutant significantly affected the replication of MNV or its control by IFNg (Figures 5A and 5B) . However, in Atg5-deficient macrophages Atg5/D88A partially restored the control of MNV replication by IFNg but Atg5/G84A/ D88A did not ( Figures 5C and 5D ). Although we cannot rule out the possibility that this partial restoration by Atg5/G84A but not by Atg5/G84A/D88A might be caused by differences in expression ( Figure S4C ), given their differing capacity to bind Atg16L1 ( Figure S4B ), these data suggest that Atg5 binding to Atg16L1 was also required for IFNg to control MNV replication.",

Autophagy was defective in Atg16L1-deficient macrophages (e.g., accumulation of p62), but expression of wild-type Atg16L1 in the Atg16L1-deficient macrophages restored autophagy ( Figure S4D ). Similar to Atg5-deficient macrophages, MNV replication was controlled by IFNg in control macrophages ( Figures 5E and 5F ) but not in Atg16L1-deficient macrophages ( Figures 5G and 5H) . However, upon reintroduction of Atg16L1 in Atg16L1-deficient macrophages, MNV replication was controlled by IFNg treatment. These data demonstrate that Atg16L1 was required for IFNg to control MNV replication. Taken together, the data shown in Figures 4 and 5 indicate that the Atg5-Atg12/Atg16L1 protein complex is required for IFNg to control MNV replication.",

There was no significant difference in MNV replication between control and Atg7-deficient macrophages ( Figure 4F ). However, IFNgmediated inhibition of MNV replication required Atg7 ( Figure 4F ). In addition to generating the Atg5-Atg12 conjugate, Atg7 participates in canonical autophagy through its required role in the lip-idation of LC3 family members. To determine the role of this function in control of MNV replication, we studied macrophages lacking LC3b (Cann et al., 2008) , but we detected no effect of LC3b deficiency on either growth of MNV or the effect of IFNg on MNV replication ( Figure S3E) . The lack of a role for LC3b might be explained by the extensive redundancy of LC3 family members (Reggiori et al., 2010; Weidberg et al., 2010) . Therefore, we examined the role of Atg4B, which is the predominant Atg4 family member involved in canonical autophagy via its role in preparing LC3 proteins for conjugation to phosphatidylethanolamine through proteolytic processing. Accordingly, we overexpressed the dominant negative form of Atg4B (AtgB/ C74A) (Fujita et al., 2008a) , which blocks the proper processing and lipidation of LC3 proteins. As expected, this protein inhibited autophagy ( Figure S3C ). However, expression of this dominant negative form of Atg4B had no significant effect on MNV replication or its control by IFNg ( Figures 3E and 3F) . Furthermore, Atg4B deficient macrophages isolated from mutant mice (Mari\u00f1 o et al., 2010) exhibited a striking deficiency in autophagy (Figure S3F ), but exhibited no significant change in MNV replication or the control of MNV replication by IFNg ( Figures 3G and 3H ). These data indicate that a highly selective portion of the autophagy machinery, including only one of the two known activities of Atg7, is required for the antiviral effects of IFNg against MNV replication.",

We utilized this system because localizing endogenous autophagy proteins in infected macrophages has been difficult using the antibodies available. We confirmed that IFNg inhibits the replication of MNV in MEFs in an Atg5-dependent manner (Figure S5A ). In wild-type MEFs, Atg5 and Atg12 were localized throughout the cell ( Figures 6A and 6B) , while Atg16L1 had a punctate localization, which colocalized with the MNV polymerase ( Figure 6C ). Interestingly, this colocalization of Atg16L1 with the MNV polymerase was also detected in Atg5 KO and Atg7 KO MEFs ( Figure S5E ). Although it is not clear whether Atg5 and Atg12 specifically colocalize with the MNV polymerase due to their diffuse cytoplasmic localization, the punctate localization of Atg16L1 with the MNV polymerase strongly suggests that Atg16L1 localizes on the MNV replication complex. To examine this colocalization at high resolution, we used stochastic optical reconstruction microscopy (STORM), a nanometer-resolution fluorescence microscopy method that is based on high-accuracy localization of photoswitchable fluorophores (Rust et al., 2006) . Using STORM, we confirmed that Atg16L1 colocalized and was tightly coassociated with the MNV polymerase ( Figure 6D ). Interestingly, we observed a spectrum of colocalization between Atg16L1 and the MNV polymerase with the two proteins in some cases closely adjacent but separated while in other cases they were comingled (Figure 6D and Movie S1). These localization data place a protein, Atg16L1, which is required for the blockade of MNV replication In all graphs, data represent mean \u00b1 SEM. See also Figure S4 .",

As observed in a previous study, expression of the nonstructural MNV polymerase in untreated control macrophages was detected by western blot by 5 to 6 hours postinfection (hpi) (Changotra et al., 2009) . Treatment with IFNg did not alter this initial burst of viral protein synthesis in either control or Atg5-deficient cells ( Figure 7B ). Of note, early synthesis of viral proteins was detected even after pretreatment with 1000 U/ml of IFNg treatment ( Figure S5B ) or in the presence of 200 U/ml of IFNg throughout the course of infection (data not shown), demonstrating that detection of normal levels of polymerase expression at early time points was not due to insufficient amounts of IFNg. These data further indicated that the initial steps in MNV infection are not altered by IFNg although it is See also Figure S5 and Movie S1. blocked by IFNb (Changotra et al., 2009 ). It has been reported that autophagy increases the degradation of herpesvirus proteins in interferon treated cells (Levine et al., 2011) . Thus, we examined the stability of the MNV polymerase in control cells treated with IFNg. We allowed infection to proceed to a point at which polymerase was expressed and then added cycloheximide at a dose that prevents protein synthesis ( Figure S5C ). When polymerase levels were followed through the rest of the MNV replication cycle, there was no significant degradation of MNV polymerase in IFNg-treated control cells ( Figure S5D ). In contrast to the lack of effect on early steps in the MNV life cycle or polymerase stability, the increase in MNV polymerase expression observed 7-12 hr after inoculation was inhibited by IFNg and this inhibition required Atg5 ( Figure 7B ).",

IFNg inhibited expression of both positive-sense genomes (encoding the polymerase protein and other nonstructural proteins) and subgenomic RNAs (encoding the capsid proteins) in an Atg5-dependent manner ( Figure 7D ). Furthermore, IFNg inhibited expression of the negative-sense viral RNA used as a template for positive-sense genomic and subgenomic RNA transcription (Rohayem et al., 2006) in an Atg5-dependent manner ( Figure 7E) . Consistently, the expression of MNV capsid protein, which is expressed after viral replication, was inhibited by IFNg in an Atg5-dependent fashion ( Figure 7C ). Viruses with single-strand positive-sense RNA genomes, including MNV, form cytoplasmic membranous replication complexes for efficient generation of negative-sense and positive-sense viral RNAs (Hyde et al., 2009; Wobus et al., 2004) . The MNV replication complex is a membranous structure consisting of all MNV nonstructural proteins, including the viral polymerase, as well as components from the ER, Golgi, and endosomes, but not lysosomes (Hyde et al., 2009 ). Since IFNg blocked synthesis of viral RNAs in an Atg5-dependent fashion without effects on early steps in the viral life cycle, we examined the effects of IFNg on the replication complex by analyzing the subcellular distribution of the MNV polymerase. By 12 hr after inoculation, we observed the MNV replication complex around the nuclei of macrophages ( Figure 7F ). However, the formation of detectable MNV replication complexes was inhibited by treatment with IFNg in an Atg5-dependent manner ( Figure 7F) , likely explaining the effects of IFNg on subsequent steps in the viral life cycle including production of infectious virus.",

Here we report that a subset or ''cassette'' of the machinery involved in canonical autophagy is essential for the antiviral effects of IFNg against MNV, a positive-sense single-stranded RNA virus within a genus including the human pathogens responsible for the majority of epidemic viral gastroenteritis world-wide. We found that expression of Atg5 in macrophages and perhaps neutrophils is required for resistance to MNV in the absence of the IFNab receptor, a situation in which the host relies heavily on IFNg to prevent death and disease. This could be explained by the failure of IFNg to control MNV replication in the macrophage in vivo, as shown in our in vitro experiments. Alternatively, an independent autophagy gene-dependent function of macrophages or neutrophils, such as secretion of cytokines (Saitoh et al., 2008; Dupont et al., 2011) , might play a determining role in MNV resistance.",

Previous work from our laboratory (Wobus et al., 2004) has shown that the membranous MNV replication complex is morphologically quite distinct from autophagosomes. Unlike autophagosomes, the replication complex contains complex arrangements of convoluted and sometimes closely apposed membranes without a concentric double membraned structure or obvious intra-vesicular cytoplasmic contents or organelles.",

Analysis of macrophage homeostasis, signaling, and gene expression indicates that the role of the Atg5-Atg12/Atg16L1 proteins in IFNg-mediated inhibition of MNV replication is posttranscriptional. Previously, we and others have shown that Atg5 is required not for the expression of, but for the recruitment of, the IFNg-inducible p47 GTPase (IIGP1 or Irga6) to the parasitophorous vacuole membrane in order to clear Toxoplasma gondii infection, without the apparent direct involvement of autophagosomes (Zhao et al., 2008 ). Here we report a distinct role for autophagy proteins comprising the Atg5-12/Atg16L1 complex in IFNg-mediated alterations in intracellular membranes-in this case preventing the formation of the membranous norovirus replication complex. Collectively, these data support the concept that the Atg5-12/Atg16L1 complex may function as a versatile antipathogen module for IFNg-dependent blockade of membrane rearrangements required for the replication of certain pathogens.",

In fact, the degradative activity of the canonical autophagy pathway likely contributes to many of the antipathogen roles of autophagy proteins (Levine et al., 2011; Levine and Deretic, 2007; Dreux and Chisari, 2010) . However, as shown here for IFNg-mediated control of MNV replication, other studies also support the concept that individual autophagy proteins or cassettes of autophagy proteins may function in infection or host defense in other ways. For example, autophagy proteins, but not canonical autophagy, function in phagocytosis and presentation of viral antigens to the immune system (Sanjuan et al., 2007; Lee et al., 2010; Huang et al., 2009 ). Atg5 and Atg7, but not canonical autophagy, are required for the secretory function of osteoclasts, a macrophage-lineage cell type related to the macrophages analyzed here (DeSelm et al., 2011) . Further, it has been reported that Atg5 can interact with IFNa/b-inducing molecules RIG-I and IPS-1 to negatively regulate the IFNa/b pathway and enhance viral infection (Levine et al., 2011) . The autophagy proteins Beclin-1, Atg4B, Atg5, and Atg12 have a role in initiating infection with Hepatitis C virus (Dreux and Chisari, 2010) . The formation of replicative compartments utilized by Brucella abortus for generation of bacteria and cell-to-cell spread is dependent on Atg14L1, Beclin-1, and ULK1 but independent of Atg5, Atg7, and Atg16L1 (Starr et al., 2012) . Similarly LC3a and b, a subset of the autophagy pathway proteins, but not Atg5 and Atg7, are required for coronavirus replication (Reggiori et al., 2010; Zhao et al., 2007) . Thus, proteins required for the highly conserved and essential autophagy pathway likely have, in addition to their essential role in degradative autophagy, key independent roles in multiple aspects of infection and host defense.",
