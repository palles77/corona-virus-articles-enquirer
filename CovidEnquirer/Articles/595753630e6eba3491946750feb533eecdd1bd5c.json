Filters are installed in the heating, ventilation, and air-conditioning (HVAC) systems of buildings to protect ventilation equipment and maintain healthy indoor air quality. These filters process enormous volumes of air. This study was undertaken to determine the utility of sampling used ventilation filters to assess the types and concentrations of virus aerosols present in buildings. Methods: The HVAC filters from 2 large public buildings in Minneapolis and Seattle were sampled to determine the presence of human respiratory viruses and viruses with bioterrorism potential. Four air-handling units were selected from each building, and a total of 64 prefilters and final filters were tested for the presence of influenza A, influenza B, respiratory syncytial, corona, parainfluenza 1-3, adeno, orthopox, entero, Ebola, Marburg, Lassa fever, Machupo, eastern equine encephalitis, western equine encephalitis, and Venezuelan equine encephalitis viruses. Representative pieces of each filter were cut and eluted with a buffer solution.",

Two passages of eluates in cell cultures or these eggs did not reveal the presence of any live virus. The eluates were also examined by polymerase chain reaction or reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction to detect the presence of viral DNA or RNA, respectively. Nine of the 64 filters tested were positive for influenza A virus, 2 filters were positive for influenza B virus, and 1 filter was positive for parainfluenza virus 1. Conclusion: These findings indicate that existing building HVAC filters may be used as a method of detection for airborne viruses. As integrated long-term bioaerosol sampling devices, they may yield valuable information on the epidemiology and aerobiology of viruses in air that can inform the development of methods to prevent airborne transmission of viruses and possible deterrents against the spread of bioterrorism agents.",

Similarly, exotic Newcastle disease virus was detected in commercial poultry flocks using wetted-wall, cyclone-style air samplers. 2 Filters are used in the heating, ventilation, and airconditioning (HVAC) systems of large buildings to remove particulate pollutants from both outdoor and indoor air, protecting ventilation system components and maintaining acceptable indoor air quality. 8, 22 Although these filters are not designed specifically to capture virus-sized particles and have not been evaluated as such, they can be expected to trap viral aerosols because they filter large volumes of air continuously, and aggregates of viruses and particles laden with one or more viruses are likely to be deposited on their surfaces. The role of ventilation filters in the epidemiology of adenovirus-related respiratory disease was documented by Echavarria et al, 23 who conducted a study in buildings occupied by unvaccinated US Army trainees for adenovirus-related infections. The percentage of filters that were positive for adenovirus type 4 by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis was directly proportional to the number of hospitalizations of the trainees housed in those buildings, indicating that these filters could trap the aerosolized infectious pathogens. Another study found that a commercial air filtration system prevented the transmission of porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus aerosols from infected to noninfected pigs, indicating that the virus was removed by the intervening filters. 24 These studies demonstrate that HVAC filters can be used as a sampling medium to collect virus aerosols for further study.",

Both filters were designed to be dust filters (tested against American Society of Heating, Refrigerating and Air-Conditioning Engineers standard 52.1: dust-spot efficiency test). Both the prefilters and final filters were constructed from fiberglass or synthetic material, designed to not support microbial growth. The pleated prefilters (60 cm 3 60 cm 3 3 cm) were designed to capture large particles from the air (with ;30% efficiency).

The authors sampled filter surfaces by wiping them with swabs premoistened with cell culture medium. In the present study, we opted for elution of viruses from filters, based on previous laboratory studies indicating that the eluent will remove not only the viruses present on filter surfaces, but also those embedded within the filter media. 26 In phase I, we eluted small pieces (;15 cm 2 ) of filtersin PBS and found 4 samples (total n 5 16) that were positive for influenza A, influenza B, and PIV-1 (Table 4 ). In phase II, we increased the filter test size to 900 cm 2 and eluted the filter in BE buffer (pH 8.5) because separate preliminary trials had judged this buffer better than PBS for virus elution. To decrease the volume of eluates to a manageable amount, we compared 2 commonly used methods, organic flocculation and PEG precipitation. 29 We used the 2 concentration methods in an attempt to increase the chance of identifying all listed viral pathogens, as well as to find a suitable method to concentrate filter eluates of this kind.",

These viruses are a major cause of respiratory infections in humans and are known to spread via the aerosol route. 36 Sequence analysis of all identified influenza A viruses revealed their close relation to H1N2. These subtypes are prevalent in the United States 37 and are a product of reassortment between subtypes H1N1 and H3N2. 38 This subtype is not a component of the influenza vaccine used in the United States. 39 Thus, these viruses might have been aerosolized by infected individuals and then removed from the air by the ventilation filters. The influenza B detected in this study is related to influenza B/Ann Arbor/1/ 66/, a component of cold-adapted, live attenuated vaccine currently in use. 40 Because there are no vaccines available for PIV-1, the identified PIV-1 was likely released by an infected individual. All identified viruses are etiologic agents of common respiratory diseases in humans and might have existed as live bioaerosols at some point in time. More filters were positive for influenza A than the other 2 pathogens. No pathogen of exotic nature or bioterrorist potential was identified. In this study, small areas of filters were examined for virus isolation and detection. More pathogens may have been detected if a larger area from each filter had been examined. Moreover, the distribution of virus aerosols in these filters might not be uniform so the results may depend on which area was chosen for study. Low copy numbers of the target genome may not have been detected by the PCR used. Low quantity of target DNA is one of the common problems encountered in environmental samples for PCR analysis. 41 The AHUs are designed to include a variable amount of outdoor air during the process of filtration. One prefilter and 1 final filter that processed 100% outdoor air also were positive for influenza B and influenza A, respectively (Tables  1 and 4 ).
