Some tests are definitive of a genus or species, for example the universal production of catalase enzyme and cytochrome c, respectively, by Staphylococcus spp. and Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Other characters may be unique to individual species and serve to differentiate them from organisms with closely similar biochemical activity profiles. Some bacteria do not grow in the laboratory (leprosy bacillus, treponemes), and identification by genetic methods may be necessary.

This process can be readily demonstrated with suitably heated homologous DNA extracted from a single species, but it can also occur with DNA from two related species, so that hybrid pairs of DNA strands are produced. These hybrid pairings occur with high frequency between complementary regions of DNA, and the degree of hybridization can be assessed if labelled DNA preparations are used. Binding studies with messenger RNA (mRNA) can also give information to complement these observations, which provide genetic evidence of relatedness among bacteria. Organisms with different G + C ratios are unlikely to show significant DNA homology. However, organisms with the same, or close, G + C ratios do not necessarily show homology. A novel real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) (see pp. 31 and 79-80) has been described for estimation of G + C content.",

Far fewer full-length gene sequences are known for 23S rRNA than for 16S rRNA and 16S-23S internal transcribed sequences. In practice the DNA of the test organism is extracted and amplified by PCR using universal primers. The DNA sequence of the product is determined and the sequence compared against databases to find the closest fit. It is generally accepted that sequence similarity between 0.5% and 1.0% (with the type species) is required for the identification of an unknown organism, and less than 97% similarity is a common cut-off point for the differentiation of species. However, different species of Mycobacterium statistical coefficient that takes account of the widest range of characters, all of which are considered of equal weight. It is clear, of course, that some characters, for instance cell shape or Gram-stain reaction, represent a much wider and permanent genetic commitment than other characters which, being dependent on only one or a few genes, may be unstable.

Highly recombining populations are termed panmictic, in contrast to clonal populations where recombination is infrequent (Table  3. 3). Species such as Neisseria gonorrhoeae and Haemophilus influenzae are naturally transformable, that is, they are able to take up DNA (foreign and native) from their environment, and their populations are characterized by a high frequency of recombination, segregation of alleles and relatively low mutation. In clonal populations such as Salmonella enterica, recombination is rare and there is non-random association of alleles in a background of limited genetic exchange. Mutations occur as a result of natural and selective pressures, but these are not sufficient to disrupt the clonal lineage and daughter cells continue to resemble the ancestral parent. Bacterial clones are therefore not identical to their parents but display a number of characteristics in common with their ancestors.

The phage adsorbs to a specific receptor on the bacterial surface and injects its DNA into the host. Phage DNA may become stably integrated into the bacterial chromosome and this state is referred to as lysogeny; phages capable of this are called temperate phages. In lysogeny, a small proportion of host cells express the phage genes, and some cell lysis and liberation of phage progeny occurs. Alternatively, the phage DNA may enter a replicative cycle, leading to the death of the host and the production of new phage particles. These lytic or virulent wild phages lyse the bacterium at the end of the replicative cycle and release a large number of daughter phage particles that infect neighbouring cells.",

For some species the criteria of Tenover (see recommended reading list) can be applied to establish the significance of differences in banding profiles of strains. As a rule of thumb, isolates from an incident under investigation that show no difference in profiles can be considered indistinguishable, those with one to three band differences as closely related, four to six bands as possibly related, and seven or more band differences as indicating distinct strains. However, this rule should be applied with a degree of caution as some species (e.g. Enterococcus faecium) can exhibit significant variation (six to ten band differences) apparently within members of the same clone. A number of computer-assisted analysis packages are available that calculate coefficients of similarity between strains and represent these as dendrograms (Fig. 3.4) . Two commonly employed coefficients, the Jaccard and Dice, use the number of concordant bands in profiles and the total number of possible band positions to calculate the percentage similarity between the isolates. The Pearson coefficient gives the advantage that specific band positions do not have to be defined. A cut-off point of 85% similarity is often used but, as for the band difference rule, this should be set by experiment with related and unrelated strain sets. cuts infrequently in the AT-rich genome of Staph. aureus, whereas enzyme XbaI (5\u2032-T\u2193CTAGA-3\u2032) is a rare cutter in most Gram-negative species with a high GC content. Both plasmid and chromosomal DNA can be analysed by this means. Frequent-cutting endonucleases generate numerous small fragments that can be resolved by conventional electrophoresis in agarose gel and detected by staining with a dye. The resolution of conventional agarose gel electrophoresis does not exceed 20 kb and optimal separation in standard length gels is achieved between 1 and 15 kb.",

In this technique, bacteria are encased in an agarose plug (to minimize shearing of DNA) and the cells are digested with proteinase K enzyme before the DNA is digested with the enzyme. By introducing a pulse or change in the direction of the electric field, fragments as large as 10 Mb can be separated. The time taken by fragments to reorient to the alternate electric field is proportional to their molecular size and where they migrate in the electric field. The most widely used apparatus is the contourclamped homogeneous electric field (CHEF), which has 24 electrodes arranged in a hexagonal array. Run times are often of the order of 30-40 hours, but shorter, more rapid, protocols have been described. A number of factors influence the quality of results, than indirectly from the electrophoretic mobilities of their gene products, as was the case with its parent technique, multilocus enzyme electrophoresis. Housekeeping genes are not subject to selective forces as are variable genes and they diversify slowly. Multiple genes (usually seven) are employed to overcome the effects of recombination in a single locus, which might distort the interpretation of the relationship of the strains being compared. Multilocus sequence typing (MLST) can rightly be referred to as definitive genotyping as sequence data are unambiguous and databases of allelic profiles of isolates of individual species are accessible via the internet. The level of discrimination of MLST depends on the degree of diversity within the population to generate alleles at each locus, but some highly uniform species such as M. tuberculosis are not amenable to analysis by the technique. Recently, increased discrimination has been sought in virulence-associated genes necessary for survival and spread of the organism on the basis that these genes are exposed to frequent environmental changes and thus provide a higher degree of sequence variation. Intergenic regions of selected genes are amplified by PCR and a 500-bp internal fragment sequenced to identify allelic polymorphisms.",

Multiple copies of regions of the genome defined by specific oligonucleotide primers are made by repeated cycles of amplification under controlled conditions. Such methods can be used to study DNA from any source. Several variations on the PCR theme have been described, and use of these techniques continues to expand and develop. PCRmediated DNA fingerprinting makes use of the variable regions in DNA molecules. These may be variable numbers of tandem repeat regions or areas with restriction endonuclease recognition sequences. To perform PCR typing, it is necessary to know the sequences of the bordering regions so that specific oligonucleotide primers can be synthesized. Primers may be specific for a known sequence or be random. Random primers are extensively used in the techniques of random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD) and arbitrarily primed PCR (AP-PCR). Both of these approaches have problems with reproducibility as a result of false priming, faint versus sharp bands and variation in electrophoretic migration of products. Repetitive sequence-based PCR (rep-PCR) indexes variation in multiple interspersed repetitive sequences in intergenic regions dispersed throughout the genome. An automated, standardized rep-PCR system has proven useful for strain typing of a number of species and is reported to give similar discrimination to PFGE (Bacterial Barcodes, Houston, Texas, USA). Amplified fragment length polymorphism is a DNA sequencebased technique that combines restriction endonuclease digestion with PCR. Incorporation of a fluorescent label and the use of a capillary DNA sequencer allows optimal standardization of reproducibility and resolution of single base-pair differences between genomes.",
