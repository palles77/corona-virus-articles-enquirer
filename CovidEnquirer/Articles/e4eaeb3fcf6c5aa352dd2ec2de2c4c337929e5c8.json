It is the directing and coordinating authority for health within the UN system. It is responsible for providing leadership on global health matters, shaping the health research agenda, setting norms and standards, articulating evidence-based policy options, providing technical support to countries, and monitoring and assessing health trends. It was established on 7 April 1948, headquartered in Geneva, Switzerland. The WHO is a member of the UN Development Group; its predecessor, the Health Organization, was an agency of the League of Nations. The constitution of the WHO had been signed by 61 countries on 22 July 1946, with the first meeting of the assembly (World Health Assembly (WHA)) finishing on 24 July 1948. It incorporated the International Office of Public Hygiene and the League of Nations Health Organization. Since its creation, it has played a leading role in the eradication of smallpox. Its current priorities include communicable diseases, in particular HIV/AIDS, Ebola, malaria, and tuberculosis. Among the remaining foci are mitigation of the effects of noncommunicable diseases; sexual and reproductive health, development, and aging; nutrition, food security, and healthy eating; occupational health; substance abuse; and driving the development of reporting, publications, and networking. The WHO is responsible for the World Health Report, a leading international publication on health, the World Health Survey, and the World Health Day (7th of April every year).",

Due to resource constraints in 1990s, the WHO places emphasis on meeting the most pressing health needs. In seeking to prevent and overcome malnutrition, the WHO promotes the tailoring of approaches to fit situation. While the rapidly increasing threat of noncommunicable diseases accounts for at least 40% of all deaths in developing countries and 75% in industrialized countries, many millions still cannot meet basic needs for energy and protein, are deficient in essential micronutrients, or are severely malnourished. Thus, coordinated action is called for on both fronts. The WHO has played a unique normative, scientific, and advisory role for the last half century. It strives to support all its member states in developing food and nutrition policies that will make healthy choices the easy choices for their populations.",

            "text": "The middle of eighteenth century saw the first international exhibition in London, at which products of technical skill and craftsmanship of many countries were displayed. This was possibly due to the increased speed and facility of transportation. But the same factor was also responsible for rapid and extensive spread of cholera that arrived in Europe and became a prominent reason for the origin of International Sanitary Conference, which opened in Paris on 23 July 1851. Eight years later, the second conference was held in Paris; it lasted for 5 months, during which a new draft was signed. This, in turn, was followed by a conference in Constantinople (1866), which ended in an agreement on a number of technical questions. On 1 July 1869, the fourth conference was held in Vienna, which resulted in a plan for a permanent International Commission on Epidemics followed by conferences in 1885 (Rome), 1892 (Venice), 1893 (Dresden), 1894 (Paris), and 1897 (Venice) with a focus on cholera or plague and removal of bars on trade. In 1903, the 11th conference was held at Paris with a more scientific approach toward epidemics. A proposal for translating scientific knowledge into practical public health measures by establishing the International Public Health Office was favorably received and acted upon on 9 December 1907, with the creation of the International Office of Public Hygiene (OIHP) in Paris. It was the first international office with the intent to disseminate to member state information on general public health, epidemics, and the ways to prevent and remedies for the same. Before the outbreak of the First World War, OIHP was working with an aim of controlling epidemics, opening and managing hospitals, and establishing food hygiene and biological standardization. Its activities were suspended in 1914, due to the outbreak of war, with the exception of the publication of its Bulletin. While OIHP was being formed, the Americans came up with International Sanitary Bureau in 1902, which was renamed as Pan American Sanitary Bureau in 1923. Besides these, there were various other regional councils of health in the eighteenth and nineteenth century in Egypt, in the Ottoman Empire, in the Moroccan region, etc.",

The world observed a breakdown of the sanitary conditions that caused the outbreak of cholera and typhus, both of which were endangering millions of lives in Poland, Russia, and other parts. The task of reestablishment of sanitary decency was a Herculean one, demanding an organization with a larger-scale, vaster outreach, more solid budget, and greater efficiency and effect. On the request of the Council of the League of Nations, International Health Conference met in London from 13 to 17 April 1920. After a lot of trials and tribulations, the league came up with its own health committee to work in coordination with OIHP. The two worked parallel for many years until after the Second World War, when the globe started making attempts to establish public health as fundamental to attainment of peace and prosperity. The UN Conference on International Organization in San Francisco was held in 1945, at which an international health organization was established. The constitution of the WHO was approved in 1946 at the International Health Conference in New York. Along with 18 states, the Interim Commission took over the work of OIHP, the Health Organization of the League of Nations, and the Health Division of the UN Relief and Rehabilitation Administration. In 1948, the WHO Constitution obtained enough support to bring it into force and was established on 7 April 1948.",

The committee has a regional director that is selected every 5 years. It holds a meeting annually where the agenda for the coming year is decided upon and progress reports regarding earlier agendas are assessed.

During food safety emergencies, INFOSAN along with the WHO helps to identify and stop the supply of contaminated food from one country to another among its member states. Recently, in August 2014, decisions were taken for linking the activities of INFOSAN with other food safety programs in the region and must also be bridged with the IHR (2005). It states that food safety and nutrition are inextricably linked, particularly in places where food supplies are insecure. It is observed that with rise in food scarcity, the chances of manufactures to ignore hygiene, safety, and nutrition increase. Less availability of good food makes people shift to less nutritious diets and consume more unsafe food, and to overcome this problem, the WHO has the Department of Nutrition for Health and Development, which has set global targets 2025 for improving maternal, infant, and young child nutrition. The targets include the Healthy Growth Project, aiming at a 40% reduction in the number of children under age of 5 years who are stunted, and the Iron Deficiency Anemia Project, targeting a 50% reduction of anemia in women of reproductive age. Other goals across the agenda include care of the preterm/low-birth-weight infants: reducing low birth weight by 30%, increasing the rate of exclusive breastfeeding in the first 6 months up to at least 50%, and reducing and maintaining childhood wasting to <5%.",

The WHO has come a long way since then in terms of both manpower and the vastness of issues it encompasses under its umbrella. The WHO covers health problems that were not even known in 1948, including relatively new communicable diseases such as HIV/AIDS, Ebola, malaria, and tuberculosis. It also is responsible for the mitigation of the effects of noncommunicable diseases; sexual and reproductive health, development, and aging; nutrition, food security, and healthy eating; occupational health; substance abuse; and driving the development of reporting, publications, and networking. The major functions of the WHO are enlisted in the succeeding text:\u2022 To provide leadership on matters critical to health and engage in collaboration in joint ventures \u2022 To shape the research agenda and stimulate the generation, translation, and dissemination of valuable knowledge \u2022 To set norms and standards and to promote and monitor",
