The virus is new, rapidly spreading, with a mortality rate of about 2% at the time of writing this editorial, and there are many uncertainties concerning its origins, nature, and course. The number of 2019-nCoV infections continue to rise, as do the number of deaths. People are being quarantined. Surgical masks and gloves, often used as a barrier to viral transmission, are selling out, even though health authorities such as the World Health Organization (WHO) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) advise people that masks and gloves are not useful or necessary for avoiding infection in healthy people.",

An Angus Reid poll of 1354 Canadian adults conducted in early February 2020 indicated that onethird of respondents were worried about the virus and 7% were \"very concerned\" about becoming infected (Angus Reid Institute, 2020). At the time of the poll, only 4 Canadians were infected, indicating a very low risk for a country of approximately 37 million; yet, 7% of the population-that is, 2.6 million people-were very concerned. There was also an increase in hygienic and avoidance behaviours. Since hearing about the outbreak, 3% of respondents in the Angus Reid poll had purchased a facemask, 41% washed their hands more often, 4% avoided taking public transit, and 12% avoided public places (Angus Reid Institute, 2020). Consistent with findings from previous epidemics and pandemics (Taylor, 2019) , many people in this poll (33%) were not confident that the healthcare system in their community was prepared to deal with new cases of the coronavirus. Lack of faith in the healthcare system is likely to fuel fears about the consequences of becoming infected.",

Fear of 2019-nCoV is much greater than fear of seasonal influenza, even though the latter has killed considerably more people. According to the Morning Consult (2020) poll, 37% of Americans were very concerned about 2019-nCoV whereas 27% were very concerned about seasonal influenza, and most respondents (62%) were more worried about 2019-nCoV than they were about seasonal influenza. These figures contrast sharply with the actual number of infections and deaths in the U.S. due to these viruses. As of February 8, 2020, there had been 11 cases of 2019-nCoV in the U.S. and no fatalities. Yet during the seasonal flu season in the U.S. (i.e., from October 2019 to February 2020) there had been 22 million flu illnesses, 210,000 hospitalizations because of influenza, and 12,000 flu-related deaths (CDC, 2020). In other words, the American public was more worried about 11 cases of 2019-nCoV with no fatalities than it was about 22 million cases of flu infection and 12,000 fatalities.",

Research on the psychological reactions to previous epidemics and pandemics suggests that various psychological vulnerability factors may play a role in coronaphobia, including individual difference variables such as the intolerance of uncertainty, perceived vulnerability to disease, and anxiety (worry) proneness (Taylor, 2019) . More research is needed to understand the relationship between coronaphobia and coronavirusrelated xenophobia. Research from other outbreaks of infectious disease suggests that individual difference variables such as the perceived vulnerability to disease may play a role in both coronaphobia and coronavirus-related xenophobia (Taylor, 2019) . Likewise, lack of information and misinformation, often aided by sensational popular media headlines and foci, have been shown to fuel health-related fears and phobias (Taylor & Asmundson, 2004) . These factors may also play a significant role in coronophobia.",

The current outbreak of 2019-nCoV represents a call to action for psychosocial researchers and practitioners. It is vitally important to understand the psychosocial fallout of 2019-nCoV, such as excessive fear (or lack of concern and due caution) and discrimination, and to find evidence-based ways of addressing these issues. This will be important not only for 2019-nCoV, but also for future outbreaks of infection. Regardless of whether 2019-nCoV becomes a pandemic, virologists predict that the next severe pandemic is inevitable and may arrive in the coming years (Taylor, 2019) .",
