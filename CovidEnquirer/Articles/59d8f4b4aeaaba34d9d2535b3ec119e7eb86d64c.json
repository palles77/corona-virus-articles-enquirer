Peplomers on most particles are short, 7-9 nm (Breda virus serotype 1) or long, 20 nm (Berne virus and Breda virus serotype 2). Many particles of Breda virus have short stubby peplomers, making the virus readily distinguishable from Coronavirus (Fig.  119 ). If Breda virus is pelletted at 80-100000 \u03c7 g, most of the long projections are lost, leaving the short peplomers. This is not observed with bovine Coronavirus. The integrity of the Breda virus peplomers is maintained better at 30000 \u03c7 g.",

            "text": "Thin sections of jejunal epithelial cells infected with Breda virus 1 or 2 show brick-shaped or elongated virus particles with rounded ends, with dimensions of 80-100 \u03c7 35-42 nm. The particles are pleomorphic and vary considerably in length. The outer membrane bears short projections and there is an internal core measuring 23-25 nm in diameter. Virus particles are observed most frequently in autophagolysosomes and in the gut lumen closely associated with the epithelial cell membrane and damaged microvilli (Pohlenz et al., 1984) . Breda virus serotype 2 infection has been studied in gnotobiotic calves, which were killed at different time intervals following infection. From this data the morphogenetic pathway for the virus was proposed. The virus enters the intestinal epithelial cells by receptor-mediated endocytosis, through coated pits situated between microvilli. It does not attach to the microvilli of goblet cells nor to the microfolds of M cells associated with Peyer's patches. Viral uncoating and release is related to lysosomal or other degradation of the virus-containing vesicles. Virus replication is associated with the Golgi system. Tubules with the same dimensions as the viral nucleocapsid are seen both in the cytoplasm associated with the Golgi apparatus and in the nucleus. Thus the virus appears to have a nuclear phase in its replication, as does Berne virus (Horzinek et al., 1985 . Virus nucleocapsid passes through the rough endoplasmic reticulum, at which site the envelope proteins are taken up by the virus. Virions are most frequently seen in swollen vesicles of the Golgi apparatus. Viral release probably occurs following fusion of the vesicles with the plasma membrane (reverse pinocytosis). The replicative cycle and release of the virus occurs before cytopathic changes are observed in the cell. Morphologically, Breda virions in infected cells most closely resemble the \"bacillary\" forms of rhabdoviruses in which both ends are rounded. The virion core (nucleocapsid) is highly electron-dense with an electron-lucent central channel (Fagerland et al., 1986; Pohlenz et al., 1984) .",

At all sites there is focal necrosis in association with mild to moderate inflammatory response in the small intestine. Cytopathic infection occurs of dome epithelium over Peyer's patches. Fusion of regions of the villi or folds occurs, with the \"bridge\" frequently composed of virus-infected cells. Ultrastructurally, the epithelial cells are rounded, vacuolated and separating from each other. There are no pathological signs which might distinguish this infection from Coronavirus, except possibly the lesions in the crypts (Woode et al., 1982; Pohlenz et al., 1984) .",

Breda virus is stable morphologically in fecal samples for at least 10 days at 18-25\u00b0C, and the hemagglutinin retains its specificity under these same conditions. Infectivity is probably lost within a day or two at temperatures above 4\u00b0C, and is not stable unless frozen at -70\u00b0C. EM detection of the virus using 3-4% potassium phosphotungstate, pH 7.0, can be used to identify infected animals, but few calves excrete highly characteristic particles in sufficient numbers for diagnostic purposes. Breda virions can be distinguished from Coronavirus particles by IEM. As the virus has not been grown in cell culture, the best diagnostic methods at present available are the HI test, ELISA and IEM. Viral hemagglutin titers of fecal samples vary from 20 000 to > 500 000 in different calves. Normal, virus-negative feces have titers of 16-32. Specific Breda virus antisera will block the hemagglutinin, and this test distinguishes between the two Breda virus serotypes which do not share common HA antigens. The HI test will not identify other serotypes of Breda virus, as this is a serotype-specific test. As all Breda virus isolates share common antigens in IF, frozen sections of the large intestine (particularly spiral colon) can be examined, and the antigen persists in large intestinal epithelial cells for 3-4 days p.i. ELISA has been used to identify Breda virus purified from feces, and again this test demonstrates antigens shared amongst all Breda virus isolates. This test can also be used for a survey of serum antibodies, in contrast to the HI test, which is not satisfactory because of the relatively low HI response of convalescent animals. These various diagnostic methods have been described in detail by Woode et al. (1982 Woode et al. ( , 1983 Woode et al. ( , 1985 .",
