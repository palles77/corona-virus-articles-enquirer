A number of variants with deletions and mutations in the S protein have been isolated from naturally and persistently infected animals and tissue cultures. Here, we report the emergence and isolation of two temperature sensitive (ts) mutants and a revertant in the process of cold-adaptation of coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) to a monkey kidney cell line. The complete sequences of wild type (wt) virus, two ts mutants, and the revertant were compared and variations linked to phenotypes were mapped. A single amino acid reversion (L 294 -to-Q) in the S protein is sufficient to abrogate the ts phenotype. Interestingly, unlike wt virus, the revertant grows well at and below 32 jC, the permissive temperature, as it carries other mutations in multiple genes that might be associated with the cold-adaptation phenotype. If the two ts mutants were allowed to enter cells at 32 jC, the S protein was synthesized, core-glycosylated and at least partially modified at 40 jC. However, compared with wt virus and the revertant, no infectious particles of these ts mutants were assembled and released from the ts mutant-infected cells at 40 jC. Evidence presented demonstrated that the Q 294 -to-L 294 mutation, located at a highly conserved domain of the S1 subunit, might hamper processing of the S protein to a matured 180-kDa, endo-glycosidase H-resistant glycoprotein and the translocation of the protein to the cell surface. Consequently, some essential functions of the S protein, including mediation of cell-to-cell fusion and its incorporation into virions, were completely abolished. D",

The S1 and S2 subunits are noncovalently associated to each other. A hydrophobic transmembrane domain (TM) of S2 anchors on the envelope with a short cytoplasmic-tail inside. One Leucine-zipper (heptad repeats) domain overlaps with the TM domain and another extends outside the envelope, folding into a-helices and coiled-coil structures involved in oligomerization (de Groot et al., 1987) .

            "text": "Although S protein is dispensable for the formation of virus-like-particles (VLPs), its incorporation into virion is critical to the assembly of infectious virus particles. The S protein is cotranslationally N-glycosylated in the ER and also forms stable complex with M in the pre-Golgi membrane (Holmes et al., 1981; Opstelten et al., 1995; Sturman et al., 1985) . It was then transported to the Golgi apparatus where its high mannose side chains are subsequently trimmed and further modified. The matured S protein is an Endo-glycosidase-H-resistant (Endo-H), 180-kDa form (Luytjes et al., 1997) . At the trans-Golgi, the matured virions are encapsulated into vesicles of the constitutive secretory pathway and released from infected cells. A portion of S protein might be transported to the plasma membrane and responsible for the cell-to-cell membrane fusion, resulting in the formation of typical syncycia and spread of virus infection to neighboring cells. The TM, Cysrich and Leucine-zipper domains of S2 and the disparate region of S1 are associated with the membrane fusion activity of the protein (Chang et al., 2000; Gallagher et al., 1991; Krueger et al., 2001; Luo et al., 1999; Tsai et al., 1999) . Cleavage of the S protein enhances the membrane fusion, though not necessarily required. The S protein contains receptor-binding domains in the S1 subunit (Kubo et al., 1994; Godet et al., 1994; Saeki et al., 1997; Suzuki and Taguchi, 1996) . Upon binding of the S protein to the receptor(s), conformation changes induce the virus -cell membrane fusion and subsequently unloading of the ribonucleocapsid inside the cell. It has been demonstrated that the cell-to-cell spread of MHV infection does not need the presence of the receptor, but the S protein is required to mediate the cell-to-cell fusion (Gallagher et al., 1992; Nash and Buchmeier, 1996) . For coronaviruses, however, the detail of molecular mechanisms of membrane fusion, especially those linked to the S1 region, is yet to be fully elucidated.",

Comparison of the sequence of wt6501 with ts291602 revealed 22 point mutations, a 5-base-deletion, a 1-base-, 3-base-and a 9-base-insertion (Table 2 ). These alterations caused 15 amino acid substitutions in eight mature viral proteins, a single amino acid insertion in the 3a protein, a truncated 3b (compared with early passages of wt virus) caused by a single base insertion in the 3b of ts291602, and a 3-amino acid insertion in the N protein. In ts282902, similar point mutations, deletion and insertion were found ( Table 2 ). The most different feature of the two ts mutant is the insertion in the 3b gene. In ts291602, a single A insertion was found at a poly-A stretch at positions 24075 to 24080, causing frameshift of the 3b gene and resulting in a C-terminally truncated 3b protein (Shen and Liu, 2003) . However, a three-A-insertion at the same poly-A stretch was found in ts282902, which does not affect the open reading frame of the 3b gene. Comparison of the sequence of rev-1 with the two ts mutants showed only one amino acid change (Q 294 -to-L 294 ) in the S protein and one amino acid deletion in the nonstructural protein 3a (I 28 ), which exists in both ts291602 and ts 282902 but not in rev-1 and wt virus. The genotype of the rev-1 at these two positions (Q 294 and I 28 ) are therefore the same as that of wt6501, but different from the two ts mutants. As both wt virus and the revertant could form plaques at 32 and 40 jC, these two mutations might be responsible for the ts phenotype. A Blast search of GenBank clearly showed that the amino acid at position 294 of the S protein was a conserved glutamine. The Leu 294 residue in the two ts mutants is located immediately downstream of a hypervariable region and the upstream of a conserved region of the S1 subunit. One additional mutation, D 709 -N 709 , was found in ts291602 only, and an I 769 -M 769 mutation in the two ts mutants and rev-1.",

The S protein derived from rev-1 (lanes 5, 6, 7, and 8) and ts291602 (lanes 9, 10, 11, and 12) were expressed in Vero cells at 32 jC (lanes 5, 6, 9, and 10) and 40 jC (lanes 7, 8, 11, and 12), using a T7-vaccinia expression system. The radiolabeled proteins were immunoprecipitated with anti-IBV antibodies, the eluted proteins were Endo-H-(lanes 6, 8, 10, and 12) or mock-treated (lanes 5, 7, 9, and 11) and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. (b) Detection of the less matured S protein from ts291602 at 40 jC and the defect in cleavage of the mutant S protein. Cells were infected with ts291602 and rev-1 for 5 h at 32 jC, one of the duplicates was maintained at 32 jC (lanes 1, 3, 5, and 7), and the other one was shifted to 40 jC (lanes 2, 4, 6, and 8).

A considerable diversity in S protein among coronaviruses exists, which contributes to host specificity, cell and organ tropisms, and pathogenesis. Characterization of mutants with point or deletion mutations in the S protein has helped to establish links between the variations and the functions or altered antigenicity and virulence of viruses. Through sequence analysis of wt virus, two ts mutants, a revertant and different passages of a cold-adapted IBV, data presented in this study not only mapped the defects of the ts mutants to the S gene, but also revealed the molecular events occurred during evolution of the IBV S gene. Compared with the parental wt virus, mutations that are identical in the two ts mutants and the revertant might be associated with the cold-adaptation phenotype, while those identical only in the two mutants but different from the revertant and wt virus were considered to be linked to the ts phenotype. According to this criterion, the Q 294 -to-L 294 mutation in the S protein that exists in the two ts mutants, and interestingly, occurred at a highly conserved domain among IBV viruses immediately downstream a variable domain in the S1 subunit may be responsible for the ts phenotype. The mutants with this mutation accumulated and became dominant under selective pressures, in this case, changes in the hosts and temperatures. The I 769 -M 769 mutation emerged earlier than the Q 294 -L 294 mutation, which among variations in other gene products may be associated with cold-adaptation, suggesting potential segregation of mutations responsible for either cold-adaptation or ts phenotypes. Further confirmation of the possibility that the Q 294 -to-L 294 mutation may cause the ts phenotypic changes is currently being carried out by introducing the mutation to an infectious IBV clones and isolation of a recombinant virus containing this mutation only.",

            "text": "The S protein is co-translationally N-glycosylated in the ER, oligomerized (Luytjes et al., 1997) if folded properly, and associated with the M protein in pre-Golgi membrane (Opstelten et al., 1995) . One of the essential steps in Nlinked glycosylation is transfer of a preformed, 14-coreunit-oligosaccharide to a specific Asn residue in the sequence Asn-X-Ser/Thr (where X is any residue except Pro, Asp, or Glu). The oligosaccharide chain is donated by dolichol-pyrophosphate-oligosaccharide to the protein chain in the ER. It is trimmed down in the ER and cis-Golgi, and different external sugars are then added to the trimmed chain in the medial-and trans-Golgi. Glycoproteins with high mannose oligosaccharides in the ER and cis-Golgi remain sensitive to Endo-H. They become Endo-H resistant after being processed by the medial-and trans-Golgi resident enzymes to glycoproteins with complex oligosaccharides. The acquisition of Endo-H resistance is therefore an indication that viral N-linked glycoproteins are properly processed and transported to the Golgi apparatus (Luo and Weiss, 1998; Luo et al., 1999; Luytjes et al., 1997) . Examination of the amino acid sequence of IBV S protein showed that there are 13 and 9 potential glycosylation sites in the S1 and S2 subunits, respectively. The calculated molecular weight of the S protein is 128 kDa. If all 21 sites are used, the initially transferred oligosaccharides account for 50 kDa. In cells overexpressing S protein, core-glycosylation of the S protein in the ER resulted in a 180-kDa product as expected. Trimming of the S glycoprotein in the ER and cis-Golgi led to a partially processed 155-kDa form, larger than the Endo-H-treated 130-kDa form which only has one sugar residue left at each site. Both the trimmed 155-and core-glycosylated 180-kDa forms were sensitive to Endo-H digestion. At the permissive temperature, further modification of the mutant S protein in the medial-and trans-Golgi by addition of sugars to the trimmed chains resulted in the maturation of S, which co-migrates with the core-glycosylated 180-kDa form but is resistant to Endo-H digestion. At the nonpermissive temperature, however, no mature form of the Fig. 6 . Analysis of the structural proteins on purified ts291602 and rev-1 virions. Immunoprecipitations were performed using virions, purified from ts291602-(lanes 1 and 2) and rev-1-infected (lanes 3 and 4) Vero cells at 32 jC (lanes 1 and 3) and 40 jC (lanes 2 and 4) . The viral proteins were separated on 12.5% polyacrylamide gels and detected by autoradiography. Numbers on the left indicate molecular masses in kilodalton and the positions of the three structural proteins are indicated on the right. mutant S protein was produced. In virus-infected cells, the Endo-H sensitive, 155-kDa form of ts291602 was abundant at the nonpermissive temperature, clearly indicating that the mutant S protein was trimmed in the ER and cis-Golgi but was not transported to the trans-Golgi. Furthermore, the mutant S protein was not cleaved into S1 and S2 at the nonpermissive temperature, which usually occurs in the trans-Golgi shortly before the release of virions from cells (Frana et al., 1985) . As only spikeless virions were produced, these results demonstrated that the core-glycosylated or the trimmed forms of S were unable to incorporate into virions. In addition, the mutant S protein fails to induce cell -cell fusion at the nonpermissive temperature. As the Q 294 -to-L 294 mutation is not in the fusogenic domain of S, it renders support to the conclusion that the mutation causes the defect in its modification and intracellular transport, instead of having direct impact on the fusion process. Taken together, these studies clearly indicate that the mutant S protein could not reach the site where the S protein is incorporated into virions.",

            "text": "The reasons for the retention of the mutant S protein in the ER and cis-Golgi are yet to be explored. Previous studies show that the retention of monomeric S protein in the ER is due to misfolding induced by disruption of disulfide bonds (Opstelten et al., 1993) , and also caused by lack of oligomerization of Endo-H-sensitive S protein of ts mutants though the locations were not determined (Luytjes et al., 1997) . It is not clear whether mutations in IBV S protein have an effect on its folding or oligomerization. Nevertheless, in both circumstances, the intracellular transport, modification of the S protein and its incorporation into virion would have been affected. Studies with some of the other enveloped viruses demonstrated that molecular chaperones (like calnexin and calreticulin) in the ER transiently and specifically interact with partially trimmed, monoglycosylated form of viral N-linked glycoproteins (Tatu and Helenius, 1997) . For instance, calnexin interacts with the influenza hemagglutinin and vesicular stomatitis virus G protein (Hebert et al., 1996; Hammond and Helenius, 1994) . These and other proteins could facilitate proper folding and ensure quality control for viral glycoproteins. Proteins that fail to fold and oligomerize are prevented from transport and ultimately degraded. With the ts mutants, it is possible to explore the interaction of the S protein with molecular chaperones and folding enzymes. This approach would provide new insights into the maturation and assembly of the coronavirus S protein.",

This low thermostability indicated that even if the mutant S protein was synthesized, fully modified and assembled into virions at the permissive temperature, the resulting particles were relatively unstable and lost infectivity at the nonpermissive temperature. It suggests that the Q 294 residue in the conserved S1 domain of IBV may also play an essential role in maintaining the thermal stability of the spike in the virion, resembling the S 287 residue in the S1 region of an MHV ts mutant (Ricard et al., 1995) . In addition, if cells were incubated with the ts mutants at the nonpermissive temperature, viral proteins were hardly detected, indicating that at the nonpermissive temperature, the ts mutant S protein may be unable to either bind efficiently to the receptor or induce virus -cell membrane fusion in contrast to the S protein of the revertant and wt virus.

After 16-h incubation at temperatures appropriate for each virus, cells were harvested and virus stock was prepared by freezing and thawing three times. Cell debris was removed by centrifugation at 5000 rpm for 15 min (Beckmen, 25.50). The supernatant was centrifuged through a 20% sucrose cushion and the resulting pellet was resuspended in TNE buffer (50 mM Tris -HCl, pH 7.4, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM EDTA). The viruses were further purified by centrifugation through a 20-55% su-crose gradient in TNE buffer at 45,000 rpm (Beckmen, SW50) twice. Fractions containing the virus were pooled together and used for protein analysis.",
