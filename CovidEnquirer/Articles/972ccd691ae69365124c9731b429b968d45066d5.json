Methods: Two hundred ninety-one adult and pediatric patients visiting the emergency department during the 2015-2016 influenza epidemic were prospectively included and immediately tested 24/7 using the FilmArray Respiratory Panel. The results were communicated to the practitioner in charge as soon as they became available. Clinical and biological data were gathered and analyzed. Findings: Results from the FilmArray Respiratory Panel do not appear to impact admission or antibiotic prescription, with the exception of a lower admission rate for children who tested positive for influenza B. Parameters that account for the clinical decisions evaluated are CRP level, white blood cell count, suspected or proven bacterial infection and, for adult patients only, signs of respiratory distress. Length of stay is also not significantly different between patients with a positive and a negative result. A rapid influenza test result permits a more appropriate prescription of oseltamivir.",

            "text": "Multiplex molecular techniques for respiratory virus detection have already shown benefits in terms of sensitivity gained and a greater range of detected pathogens in comparison to conventional techniques. Recent progress has made it possible to shorten turnaround time (TAT) and to allow delivery of results in a timely manner, especially in comparison to cell culture and direct fluorescence assays (DFA) (Hodinka and Kaiser, 2013; Xu et al., 2013; Zumla et al., 2014) . However, molecular techniques have not clearly shown cost-effectiveness. Studies report conflicting results, possibly due to differences in study design. What seems to be agreed upon is that results of molecular tests should be delivered rapidly in the course of patient management. The availability of results in the emergency room (ER) would most likely help avoid antibiotic use and ancillary test prescription, improve antiviral prescription and shorten length of stay in the ward by facilitating discharge of patients or cohorting of hospitalized patients, namely for influenza viruses (Xu et al., 2013; Rappo et al., 2016; Busson et al., 2017) . Selecting the population for which the test should be applied also seems of great importance to increase cost-effectiveness (Boeckh, 2008; Valli\u00e8res and Renaud, 2013) . To shed some light on this important issue, we report the results of a prospective interventional study including selected adult and pediatric patients visiting the emergency departments of the tertiary care hospital Saint-Pierre in Brussels during the 2015-2016 influenza epidemic. All patients were immediately tested 24/7 with the same standard of care, the FilmArray (FA) Respiratory Panel (bioM\u00e9rieux, Marcy L'Etoile, France). The evaluated outcomes were antibiotic and antiviral prescriptions, admission, length of stay of hospitalized patients, prescription of ancillary tests and patient isolation.",

The 2015-2016 influenza season in Belgium was moderate and lasted from week 4 to week 13. More than 90% of influenza A isolates collected in Belgium were A(H1N1)pdm2009. Regarding influenza B, circulating strains were almost exclusively from the Victoria lineage, according to the Belgian Public Health Institute (2016) . Adults and children visiting the emergency room and presenting with upper or lower respiratory symptoms were prospectively included if either they were expected to be hospitalized or if they had any of the following conditions: chronic respiratory diseases (such as cystic fibrosis, asthma or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), sickle-cell disease, asplenia, neuromuscular diseases, severe neurological impairments, hereditary metabolic disorders including diabetes, congenital or acquired immunosuppression, heart defects, chronic nephropathies, chronic liver diseases and pregnancy. Children under 3 months of age with a fever without focus (FWF) were also included.",

Signs of respiratory distress were also associated with hospitalization and antibiotic prescription for adults but not for children. This difference could be explained by the fact that respiratory distress in adults occurred mainly in patients with decompensated chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, which is often caused by an infection. For children, respiratory distress was mainly encountered during bronchiolitis or decompensated asthma; these conditions do not systematically imply antibiotic prescription or hospitalization if the symptoms improve following aerosol treatment in the emergency room. A correction for age had to be applied for children concerning admission and for adults concerning admission and antibiotics prescription. This finding indicates that younger age for children is associated with a higher admission rate and older age for adults with higher admission rates and antibiotic prescriptions. This can be explained as children <1 month of age attending the emergency room are consistently hospitalized according to the local management algorithm. They represented 15 of the 149 included children (10%). However, hospitalized patients are still significantly younger than nonhospitalized ones even after removing the subset of patients aged <1 month from the calculation (1.6 years old vs 2.8; p = 0.032).",

            "text": "Statistical analyses comparing hospitalization status and prescription of antibiotics showed no significant difference between patients with a positive FA result and patients with a negative result. This could be explained by the fact that virology results are not crucial in management algorithms. Indeed, guidelines regarding patients' management with community-acquired pneumonia state that the detection of a virus in a respiratory sample makes a bacterial infection less likely, provided there are no other clinical, biologic or radiographic signs of such an infection (Bradley et al., 2011; Woodhead et al., 2011) . When antibiotic prescription is necessary in our institution, it relies on the association of intravenous ampicillin and cefotaxime for children <3 months old. For children >3 months old, cefotaxime alone is prescribed for systemic infections or cefuroxime for respiratory infections. For adults, respiratory infections are treated with cefuroxime or amoxicillin/clavulanic acid. The administration can be intravenous or oral depending on the severity of the symptoms. Antibiotics are maintained at least 48 h for hospitalized patients and reevaluated based on the evolution of the symptoms and the results of the microbiological and blood analysis. The impact of the FA result on antibiotic discontinuation for hospitalized patients would need further evaluation. Keske et al. (2018) observed that in addition to providing a rapid molecular test result, offering training sessions for physicians about the diagnosis and the management of respiratory tract infections could decrease antibiotic use, at least for children. Other studies did not find a difference in antibiotic use when testing adult or pediatric patients with molecular techniques (Hernes et al., 2014; Rogers et al., 2015; Andrews et al., 2017; Semret et al., 2017; Trabattoni et al., 2018) ; however, some pediatric studies report a shorter antimicrobial treatment duration (Rogers et al., 2015; Schulert et al., 2013) . In these studies, the results of molecular tests were not delivered in a timely manner, which can explain the lack of impact on the initial prescription of antimicrobial treatment even though there was an impact on the duration. Duration of antimicrobial treatment was not recorded in our study.",

As previously described, FA results had no impact on the isolation of children, as all children with a proven or suspected contagious infectious process are to be kept in isolation. Nevertheless, rapid delivery of the FA result allowed better management of hospitalized children by cohorting, as individual rooms are not available for every patient. The delay in the emergency room before admission was not recorded but was shortened according to the pediatricians involved in this study. For adults, screening patients with a molecular technique having a broad panel of detected pathogens triggers more isolations and avoids few. This approach, albeit expensive, permits better application of isolation procedures and likely diminishes nosocomial spread of respiratory viral pathogens, which has been shown to be an underappreciated cause of morbidity and mortality in hospitalized patients (Gilca et al., 2014; Chow and Mermel, 2017) .",

The result was also communicated before oseltamivir was prescribed in 40 cases, reminding its institution. However, the total expense for the utilization of FA tests was approximately 40 000 euros. The use of a sensitive and specific molecular technique targeting only influenza A and B might be a more cost-effective option in adult populations (Trabattoni et al., 2018; You et al., 2017) .

We would expect that a positive FA result could explain clinical symptoms of the patients and thus limit further investigations. For adult patients admitted after the ER, we paradoxically observed more blood samples and blood cultures taken for patients with a positive FA result. For children, it was the opposite; we observed less blood samples, blood cultures and other microbiological samples taken in the group with a positive FA result. A hypothesis would be that admitted adults with a viral infection are more likely to already have complications from the infection. For children, the respiratory viruses might more probably be responsible for the clinical symptoms and complications requiring further analysis could be less frequent. However, these findings would require further evaluation in order to appreciate all possible confounding parameters.",

Firstly, a study from Rappo et al. (2016) found lower antimicrobial use, fewer chest radiographs ordered and a shorter length of stay for patients positive for influenza according to FA in comparison to conventional methods. This difference was significant, regardless of the virus, after correction for age, immunosuppression status and asthma and intensive care unit admission, reflecting the importance of the target population for the tests. However, Rappo et al. studied the management of adult patients during two consecutive winter seasons. This type of design notably adds bias to the interpretation of the data due to difference in circulating viruses and to possible change in management algorithms between two seasons. Secondly, a study from Trabattoni et al. (2018) evaluating adult patients visiting the ER and tested with a rapid molecular technique for influenza in comparison to conventional methods also reported fewer radiographs and biological tests ordered, fewer admissions and shorter length of stay in the emergency room in the group tested by the molecular technique. However, the group tested with conventional methods was older and showed more comorbidities. Thirdly, Echavarr\u00eda et al. (2018) prospectively studied children and adults visiting the emergency room with acute respiratory tract infection and compared patients tested with immunofluorescent assay to those tested with FA. They demonstrated a decrease in antibiotic prescription for adults and children, a decrease in antiviral prescription for adults and a decrease in ancillary test prescription for children in the FA group. The advantages of our evaluation in comparison to other studies are prospective design, inclusion of selected children and adults visiting the emergency department during the same epidemic season, use of the same standard of care for every patient and delivery of test results while patients were still in the emergency department. In the majority of studies, only test results were taken into consideration, and confounding factors might have been missed, while in our study, clinical parameters were also taken into account during analysis.",

Other parameters appeared more consistently to account for hospitalization decisions and antibiotic prescriptions, such as CRP levels, white blood cell count, suspected or proven bacterial infection and, for adult patients only, signs of respiratory distress. For children, younger age is also associated with a higher admission rate, but this could be explained by local management algorithms. For adult patients, older age is associated with higher admission and antibiotic prescription rates. One exception is having an influenza B-positive result, leading to a significantly higher rate of discharge for children, suggesting that use of a sensitive molecular technique targeting only influenza A and B could be more cost-effective in our setting. The positive impact of the use of the FilmArray Respiratory Panel might be more important in high-risk populations, such as immunosuppressed patients, for whom more than just influenza viruses are to be treated, which would possibly avoid detrimental outcomes.",
