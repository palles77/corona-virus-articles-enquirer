The TGEV primers and probe were designed to be specific to a portion of the S gene sequence conserved in all TGEV isolates, but absent in the closely related porcine respiratory coronaviruses. The optimized TaqMan assay detected a minimum of 2.8 copies of in vitro transcribed RNA of the target S gene and RNA extracted from 1 TCID 50 /ml of TGEV. Using 113 clinical samples received at our diagnostic laboratory over a 4-year period, the performance of the assay was tested and compared with that of a previously described nested RT-PCR assay. All the fecal samples which tested positive for TGEV by the nested RT-PCR assay also tested positive by the TaqMan assay. However, approximately 9% of the samples that tested negative by the nested RT-PCR assay tested positive by the TaqMan assay. These results indicate that the developed TaqMan assay is a highly sensitive diagnostic test for rapid detection of TGEV in pig fecal samples.",

The disease is caused by TGE virus (TGEV), an enveloped virus with a large, single positive-strand RNA genome that belongs to Coronaviridae family. TGEV replicates in intestinal enterocytes and shed in the feces of infected pigs. The infection is transmitted by fecal-oral route. Clinical signs of the disease include watery diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration and high mortality in unweaned piglets (Saif and Wesley, 1999) . TGEV infections can cause severe economic losses to swine industry. Because of the highly contagious nature of TGE, availability of rapid diagnostic methods that are highly specific and sensitive for detection of TGEV in fecal samples is very useful for timely implementation of disease management practices.",

Some pigs infected with PRCV can shed the virus in their feces (Saif and Wesley, 1999; Kim et al., 2000a; Costantini et al., 2004) . Therefore, any diagnostic assay for TGE should be able to differentiate it from PRCV. The conventional diagnostic methods used for TGE include, cell culture isolation of the virus, identification of coronavirus in feces by electron microscopy, fluorescent antibody test on cryosections of intestines, antigen-capture enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) for detection of TGEV in feces, and detection of serum antibodies to TGEV by virus neutralization assay or ELISA (Dulac et al., 1977; van Nieuwstadt et al., 1988a,b; Sirinarumitr et al., 1997; Saif and Wesley, 1999; Carman et al., 2002) . These methods are not suitable for the rapid detection of clinical TGE because of either their low specificity and sensitivity or the prolonged time required to perform the assay. A previously developed nested reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (nRT-PCR) that can differentially detect TGEV and PRCV has been very useful for the diagnostic testing of TGE cases (Kim et al., 2000a) . However, this assay is also time-consuming because of the need to perform two PCR amplifications and detect the amplified products by agarose gel electrophoresis. In addition, nested PCR assays are generally more prone to give false positive results because of cross-contamination of the amplified DNA products, especially when processing large number of samples (Aslanzadeh et al., 1996; Bel\u00e1k and Thor\u00e9n, 2001; Khlif et al., 2009) .",

A set of primers (forward primer: 5 -TCTGCTGAAGGTGCTATTATATGC-3 ; reverse primer: 5 -CCACAATTTGCCTCTGAATTAGAAG-3 ) and a TaqMan probe (5 -C/TAAGGGCTCACCACCTACTACCACCA-3 ) targeting a conserved 145 bp region (corresponding to the region between nucleotides 370 and 515 of the TGEV S gene open reading frame) were designed using Beacon Designer 3 software (PRE-MIER Biosoft International, Palo Alto, CA).

For an internal control, EGFP gene from pEGFP-N1 (Clontech, Mountain View, CA) was excised with XbaI and BamHI digestion and cloned into the same sites of pCDNA3.1. The pCDNA3.1 plasmids with the inserts were linearized with BamHI and in vitro transcribed from the Sp6 promoter using RNAMaxx High Yield Transcription kit (Stratagene, Cedar Creek, TX). The transcribed RNA was extracted using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen) and digested with RNase-free DNase to remove any contaminating DNA, and the RNA was purified again using RNeasy column as per the RNeasy kit protocol (Qiagen, Valencia, CA). Quant-iT RiboGreen RNA assay kit (Invitrogen) was used to quantify the purified RNA transcripts. RNA copy numbers were calculated based on the exact length and nucleotide composition of the RNA molecules. Tenfold serial dilution of the transcripts were prepared in TE buffer (10 mM Tris and 1 mM EDTA, pH 8.0) with 0.5 U/l of RNasin (Promega, Madison, WI) and stored at \u221220 \u2022 C.",

Presence of PCR inhibitors can lead to false negative results. The TGEV-specific real-time PCR assays reported previously do not detect the presence of PCR inhibitors (Chen et al., 2004; Kim et al., 2007) . An effective way to monitor for the presence of PCR inhibitors is to include an internal amplification control in the PCR assay. We employed the EGFP RNA-based universal internal amplification control described previously for this purpose (Hoffmann et al., 2006) . The EGFP Ct values in most of the TGEV negative samples were within the expected range, suggesting that RNA extracted from these fecal samples did not contain PCR inhibitors. The EGFP internal amplification control detected the presence of potential PCR inhibitors in RNA of 7 of the TGEV negative samples. In case of TGEV positive samples, the EGFP Ct values were highly variable (in the range of 0-35). In samples where the TGEV Ct values were low (<15, indicating high viral concentration in the sample), no amplification of the EGFP internal control occurred (Ct value 0). This could be mainly because of the competitive advantage of the high concentration of the TGEV target sequences for reagent utilization during PCR amplification. On the other hand, the high EGFP Ct values (>29) in the TGEV positive samples suggest the presence of PCR inhibitors; though the relevance of such finding has no effect on the diagnostic interpretation of the sample (i.e. positive for TGEV). In none of the tested samples there was complete inhibition of both the EGFP and TGEV targets, suggesting that the PCR inhibitors present in the fecal RNA extractions were not at high enough levels to cause 100% RT-PCR inhibition. Overall, these results suggest that the developed TaqMan assay can effectively monitor the presence of PCR inhibitors, and along with the RNA extraction method used in this study, the assay provides a reliable means to detect TGEV in the fecal samples.",

When 1 in 10 dilution (with TE buffer) of the RNA extracted from these samples was used as template in the nRT-PCR, 2 samples with higher viral load (Ct values of 18.82 and 19.21) showed a low level amplification of the specific DNA product; no detectable amplification was observed with the other 4 samples. In addition, even with some positive field samples, only a low level of amplification was detected in the nRT-PCR even though the TGEV Ct values of the same samples indicated very high viral loads. A probable reason for this discrepancy could be that the nRT-PCR was more prone to PCR inhibition than the TaqMan assay, similar to the observations reported for norovirus detection in fecal and environmental samples (Trujillo et al., 2006; Scipioni et al., 2008) .",

Moreover, the TaqMan assay can also be used for research purposes where rapid quantification of TGEV in fecal or other samples is needed.",
