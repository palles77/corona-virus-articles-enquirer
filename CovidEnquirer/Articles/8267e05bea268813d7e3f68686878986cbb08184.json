            "text": "The built environment encompasses a broad range of physical design elements, including spaces for care of patients, support services, electronics, and major technical equipment; building systems that provide air and water; and surfaces and finishes. This spectrum of spaces and surfaces collectively is referred as the environment of care (EOC). In general, these are less frequently a source of microorganisms causing health care-associated infection (HAI) compared with other sources, such as the patient's endogenous microflora, especially when an invasive device is present, or a surgical procedure. 2 Carriage of microbes on hands of health care personnel (HCP) also is a more likely mechanism of exposure to potential pathogens. Even so, the proportional contribution of the EOC as a reservoir of pathogens is estimated at 20%. 3 Over the past several years there have been several studies showing that the EOC is a significant source of multidrug-resistant organisms (MDROs), Clostridium difficile, and norovirus. 4 In addition, investigation of the role of the EOC has found that admission to a patient room previously occupied by a patient with an MDRO or C difficile is a risk factor for their acquisition by the next occupant. 5 Specific pathogens can suggest an environmental source; for example, from demolition of drywall or gaps in maintenance of key mechanical systems, which include Aspergillus spp, Fusarium spp, Rhizopus spp, Bacillus cereus, Legionella spp, a wide range of gram-negative bacteria, and nontuberculous mycobacteria. 2 When HAIs are caused by opportunistic pathogens it is important to apply key principles such as chain of transmission and the following criteria to determine whether reservoirs are present in the environment and to help guide implementation of mitigation strategies, if applicable.",

This distribution network readily supports development of biofilm, and the microbial contaminants embedded in this matrix of extracellular polymeric substances, mainly composed of exopolysaccharides, proteins, and nucleic acids, protects microorganisms from disinfectants that are otherwise effective against planktonic forms. 12 Stagnant water in this network, often from renovation of areas in the facility that has resulted in redundant lengths of pipework that are left in place and capped, also enhances development of biofilm.

This design also enhances safety related to a variety of other potential harms, supports patient privacy, and lessens disruption from ambient noise. 20 By contrast, the lack of spatial separation between patients in multibed rooms or wards has been associated with increased risk of respiratory viral infections and bacterial infection when patient with similar devices are in the same room. 21, 22 Other investigators identified a temporal association between fewer bloodstream infections, detection of MDROs, and prevalence of antibiotic resistance with redesign of patient-care units from open wards to single-patient rooms. 23 Studies of cross-transmission of microorganisms in health care facilities have identified that surfaces nearer to patients are more likely to be contaminated. Further, patients with acute infection, especially when symptoms result in contamination of the immediate environment with body fluids containing the pathogen (eg, diarrhea), result in higher microbial burden on environmental surfaces. 5 This finding is particularly true of norovirus, for which studies find that person-to-person transmission depends on close or direct contact as well as short-range aerosol exposures. Also, experience with control of outbreaks of norovirus highlight the need to clean and disinfect frequently touched surfaces (eg, patient and staff bathrooms, utility rooms, tables, chairs, commodes, computer keyboards and mice, and items in close proximity to symptomatic patients). 24 ",
