We developed CATCH (Compact Aggregation of Targets for Comprehensive Hybridization), a computational method to enhance nucleic acid capture for enrichment of diverse microbial taxa. CATCH designs compact probe sets that achieve full coverage of known sequence diversity and that scale well with this diversity. To illustrate applications of CATCH, we focused on capturing viral genomes. We designed, synthesized, and validated multiple probe sets, including one that targets whole genomes of the 356 viral species known to infect humans. Capture with these probe sets enriched unique viral content on average 18\u00d7 and allowed us to assemble genomes that we could not otherwise recover, while accurately preserving within-sample diversity. We used this approach to recover genomes from the 2018 Lassa fever outbreak in Nigeria and to improve detection of viral infections in samples with unknown content. Together, this work demonstrates a path toward more sensitive, cost-effective metagenomic sequencing.",

For example, a user can customize the model of hybridization that CATCH uses to determine whether a candidate probe will hybridize to and capture a particular target sequence. Also, a user can design probe sets for capturing only a specified fraction of each target genome and, relatedly, for targeting regions of the genome that distinguish similar but distinct subtypes. CATCH also offers an option to blacklist sequences, e.g., highly abundant ribosomal RNA sequences, so that output probes are unlikely to capture them. CATCH can use locality-sensitive hashing 33, 34 , if desired, to reduce the number of candidate probes that are explored, improving runtime and memory usage on especially large numbers of input sequences. We implemented CATCH in a Python package that is publicly available at https://github.com/broadinstitute/catch. Figure 1 -Using CATCH for probe set design. (a) Sketch of CATCH's approach to probe design, shown with three datasets (typically, each is a taxon). For each dataset d, CATCH generates candidate probes by tiling across input genomes and, optionally, reduces the number of them using locality-sensitive hashing. Then, it determines a profile of where each candidate probe will hybridize (the genomes and regions within them) under a model with parameters \u03b8 d (see Supplementary Fig. 1b for details). Using these coverage profiles, it approximates the smallest collection of probes that fully captures all input genomes (described in text as s(d, \u03b8 d )). Given a constraint on the total number of probes (N) and a loss function over the \u03b8 d , it searches for optimal \u03b8 d . (b) Number of probes required to fully capture increasing numbers of HCV genomes. Approaches shown are simple tiling (gray), a clustering-based approach at two levels of stringency (red), and CATCH with three choices of parameter values specifying varying levels of stringency (blue). See Methods for details regarding parameter choices. Previous approaches for targeting viral diversity use clustering in probe set design. Shaded regions around each line are 95% pointwise confidence bands calculated across randomly sampled input genomes.",

V ALL encompasses 356 species (86 genera, 31 families), and we designed it using genomes available from NCBI GenBank 35, 36 (Supplementary Table 1 ). We constrained the number of probes to 350,000, significantly fewer than the number used in studies with comparable goals 24, 25 , reducing the cost of synthesizing probes that target diversity across hundreds of viral species. The design output by CATCH contained 349,998 probes (Fig.  1c ). This design represents comprehensive coverage of the input sequence diversity under conservative choices of parameter values, e.g., tolerating few mismatches between probe and target sequence (Fig. 1d) . To compare the performance of V ALL against probe sets with lower complexity, we separately designed three focused probe sets for commonly co-circulating viral infections: measles and mumps viruses (V MM ; 6,219 probes), Zika and chikungunya viruses (V ZC ; 6,171 probes), and a panel of 23 species (16 genera, 12 families) circulating in West Africa (V WAFR ; 44,995 probes) ( Supplementary Fig. 3 , Supplementary Table 1) . These probe sets are publicly available (see Methods for link).",

These 8 viruses together reflect a range of typical viral titers in biological samples, including ones that have extremely low levels, such as ZIKV 38, 39 . The samples encompass a range of source materials: plasma, serum, buccal swabs, urine, avian swabs, and mosquito pools. We performed capture on these libraries and sequenced them both before and after capture. To compare enrichment of viral content across sequencing runs, we downsampled raw read data from each sample to the same number of reads (200,000) before further analysis. Downsampling to correct for differences in sequencing depth, rather than the more common use of a normalized count such as reads per million, is useful for two reasons. First, it allows us to compare our ability to assemble genomes (e.g., owing to capture) in samples that were sequenced to different depths. Second, downsampling helps to correct for differences in sequencing depth in the presence of a high frequency of PCR duplicate reads (see Methods for details), as observed in captured libraries. We removed duplicate reads during analyses so that we could measure enrichment of viral information (i.e., unique viral content) rather than measure an artifactual enrichment arising from PCR amplification.",

Capture increased depth across the length of each viral genome, with no apparent preference in enrichment for regions over this length (Fig. 2a, b, Supplementary Fig. 4) . Moreover, capture successfully enriched viral content in each of the 6 sample types we tested. The increase in coverage depth varied between samples, likely in part because the samples differed in their starting concentration and, as expected, we saw lower enrichment in samples with higher abundance of virus before capture ( Supplementary Fig. 5 ).",

At a depth of 200,000 reads, use of V ALL allowed us to reliably detect viral content (i.e., observe viral reads in two technical replicates) down to 100 copies in 30 ng of background and 1,000 copies in 300 ng (Fig. 3a, Supplementary Table 5) , each at least an order of magnitude fewer than without capture, and similarly lowered the input at which we could assemble genomes ( Supplementary Fig. 7a ).

The additional gain of these probe sets might be useful in some applications, but was considerably less than the 18\u00d7 increase provided by V ALL against a pre-capture sample. Overall, our results suggest that neither the complexity of the V ALL probe set nor its use of shorter ssDNA probes prevent it from efficiently enriching viral content.",

H4N4 was not included in the designs, making it a useful test case for this relationship.

To investigate whether these differences are related to sequence divergence from the probes, we compared the identity between probes and sequence in the H4N4 genome to the observed enrichment of that sequence (Fig. 3b) . We saw the least enrichment in segment 6 (N), which had the least identity between probe sequence and the H4N4 sequence, as we did not include any sequences of the N4 subtypes in the probe designs. Interestingly, V ALL did show limited positive enrichment of segment 6, as well as of segment 4 (H); these enrichments were lower than those of the less divergent segments. But this was not the case for segment 4 when using V WAFR , suggesting a greater target affinity of V WAFR capture when there is some degree of divergence between probes and target sequence ( Fig. 3b) , potentially due to this probe set's longer, ssRNA probes. For both probe sets, we observed no clear inter-segment differences in enrichment across the remaining segments, whose sequences have high identity with probe sequences (Fig. 3b, Supplementary Fig. 9 ). These results show that the probe sets can capture sequence that differs markedly from what they were designed to target, but nonetheless that sequence similarity with probes influences enrichment efficiency.",

At equivalent pre-and post-capture sequencing depth (200,000 reads), use of V ALL improved our ability to detect and assemble LASV. Capture considerably increased the amount of unique LASV material detected in all 23 samples (in 4 samples, by more than 100\u00d7), and in 7 samples it enabled detection when there were no LASV reads pre-capture ( Supplementary  Fig. 10a , Supplementary Table 7) . This in turn improved genome assembly. Whereas precapture we could not assemble any portion of a genome in 22 samples (in the remaining one, 2% of a genome) at this depth, following use of V ALL we could assemble a partial genome in 22 of the 23 (Fig. 4a, Supplementary Fig. 10b ); most were small portions of a genome, although in 7 we assembled > 50% of a genome. Assembly results with V ALL are comparable without downsampling ( Supplementary Fig. 10c ), likely because we saturate unique content with V ALL even at low sequencing depths ( Supplementary Fig. 7b , c). These results illustrate how V ALL can be used to improve viral detection and genome assembly in an outbreak, especially at the low sequencing depths that may be desired or required in these settings.",

This could also be applied on other small machines such as the iSeq (Illumina) or MinION (Oxford Nanopore) 53 . Further, the increase in viral content enables more samples to be pooled and sequenced on a single run, increasing sample throughput and decreasing per-sample cost relative to unbiased sequencing (Supplementary Table 9 ).

Notably, as capture requires additional cycles of amplification, computational analyses should properly account for duplicate reads due to amplification; the inclusion of unique molecular identifiers 54, 55 could improve determination of unique fragments. Also, quantifying the sensitivity and specificity of capture with comprehensive probe sets is challenging -as it is for metagenomic sequencing more broadly -because doing so would necessitate obtaining viral genomes for the hundreds of targeted species, and false positives are likely to be due to components of sequencing and classification that are unrelated to capture (e.g., contamination in sample processing or read misclassifications). For sequencing some ultra low input samples, targeted amplicon approaches may be faster and more sensitive 38 , but genome size, sequence heterogeneity, and the need for prior knowledge of the target species can limit the feasibility and sensitivity of these approaches 1, 56, 57 . Similarly, for molecular diagnostics of particular pathogens, many commonly used assays such as qRT-PCR and rapid antigen tests are likely to be faster and less expensive than metagenomic sequencing. Capture does increase the preparation cost and time per-sample compared to unbiased metagenomic sequencing, but this is offset by reduced sequencing costs through increased sample pooling and/or lower-depth sequencing 1 (Supplementary Table 9 ).",

Capture-based approaches have successfully been used to enrich whole genomes of eukaryotic parasites such as Plasmodium 58 and Babesia 59 , as well as bacteria 60 . Many bacteria, like viruses, have high variation even within species 61 , and CATCH can enable efficient and sensitive enrichment of these bacterial genomes or even of combinations of viral and bacterial targets. Beyond microbes, CATCH can benefit studies in other areas that use capture-based approaches, such as the detection of previously characterized fetal and tumor DNA from cell-free material 62, 63 , in which known targets of interest may represent a small fraction of all material and for which it may be useful to rapidly design new probe sets for enrichment as novel targets are discovered.

Optionally, CATCH uses locality-sensitive hashing 33, 34 (LSH) to reduce the number of candidate probes, which is particularly useful when the input is a large number of highly similar sequences. CATCH supports two LSH families: one under Hamming distance 33 and another using the MinHash technique 34, 64 , which has been used in metagenomic applications 65, 66 . It detects near-duplicate candidate probes by performing approximate near neighbor search 34 using a specified family and distance threshold. CATCH constructs hash tables containing the candidate probes and then queries each (in descending order of multiplicity) to find and collapse near-duplicates. Because LSH reduces the space of candidate probes, it may remove candidate probes that would otherwise be selected in steps described below, thereby increasing the size of the output probe set. Use of LSH to reduce the number of candidate probes is optional in our implementation of CATCH; we did not use it to produce the probe sets in this work. The approach of detecting near-duplicates among probes (and subsequently mapping them onto sequences, described below) bears some similarity to the use of P-clouds for clustering related oligonucleotides in order to identify diverse repetitive regions in the human genome 67, 68 .",

The function f map , which determines whether a probe hybridizes to a range in a target sequence (and, if it does, precisely the range), can be customized by a user in CATCH's source code or can be provided in a command-line argument to be dynamically loaded. For example, although by default CATCH does not use a thermodynamic model of hybridization, a user could choose to incorporate a calculation of free energy to evaluate the likelihood of hybridization. Here, when computing s(d, \u03b8 d ), CATCH's default f map is based on three parameters in \u03b8 d : a number m of mismatches to tolerate, a length lcf of a longest common substring, and a length i of an island of an exact match. f map computes the longest common substring with at most m mismatches between the probe sequence and target subsequence, and returns that the probe covers the target range if and only if the length of this is at least lcf. Optionally (if i > 0), f map additionally requires that the probe and target subsequence share an exact (0-mismatch) match of length at least i to return that the probe covers the range. (See Supplementary Fig.  1b for a visual representation and \"Exploring the parameter space across taxa\" for example values.)",

            "text": "There are many problems related to probe design that map well to generalizations of the set cover problem. Relevant generalizations are the weighted and partial cover problems 31, 78, 79 . Using the weighted cover problem, CATCH allows a user to perform differential identification of taxa and also to blacklist sequences from the probe design. For these purposes, we introduce the concept of a \"rank\" to our implementation of the set cover solution. A rank of a set is analogous to a weight and makes it straightforward to assign levels of penalties on sets. For two sets S and T , if rank(S) < rank(T ) then S is always considered before T -i.e., if coverage is needed and S provides that coverage, then the greedy algorithm always chooses S before T even if T provides more. These can be emulated entirely using weights (i.e., costs), by assigning sufficiently high weights to each set. To perform differential identification, CATCH accepts groupings of sequences as input (for example, each grouping might encompass the available genomes of a species). Then, CATCH finds the number of groupings that each candidate probe p \"hits\". (p hits a grouping if it covers a part of at least one sequence in that grouping.) A probe that hits only one grouping is suitable for differential identification, whereas ones that hit more are poor choices. Thus, CATCH assigns a rank to each p equal to the number of groupings hit by p. CATCH can also accept a collection of sequences to blacklist from the probe design. It determines the number of nucleotides in blacklisted sequence that each p covers and assigns to p a rank equal to this value; therefore, candidate probes that cover blacklisted sequence are highly penalized in the design. (When a user opts to perform differential identification while also blacklisting sequences, the ranks are assigned such that a candidate probe that covers a part of a blacklisted sequence always receives a higher rank than one that does not.) For the purposes of determining whether p hits an identification grouping or blacklisted sequence, CATCH accepts three additional parameters, holding more tolerant values for m, lcf, and i as defined above, that f map uses to evaluate probe-target hybridization. We note as well that weights can have other applications in probe design, e.g., if there is a reason to prefer some candidate probes over others due to base composition. Finally, CATCH solves an instance of the weighted cover problem by assigning the rank of each set to be the rank of the candidate probe it represents.",

The user specifies this portion as either a fraction of the length of each sequence or as a fixed number of nucleotides. Reducing the problem directly to an instance of the set cover problem with a single universe would not allow partially covering each target sequence. Thus, we introduce \"multiple universes\" to the instance, in which each universe corresponds to a target sequence and consists of all the bases in that sequence. Each set (representing candidate probes) specifies which elements in which universes it covers. The greedy algorithm continues selecting among the candidate probes until it obtains the desired partial coverage of each universe (target sequence). We don't make claims about the approximation factor this achieves. As one application, note that when performing differential identification the required partial coverage should be set to be relatively low.",

Thus, we would like to use k unique adapters and divide the probes in s(d, \u03b8 d ) into k groups such that the probes in each group are unlikely to chain together; then, we can perform PCR separately on each group. CATCH uses a heuristic to solve this problem for k = 2, i.e., two adapters A and B. Consider one target sequence t. It maps each of the probes in s(d, \u03b8 d ) to t using f map , as described above. It treats the ranges that each probe covers as an \"interval,\" and finds the largest set of non-overlapping intervals (probes) T no by solving an instance of the interval scheduling problem. Then, we could assign adapter A to each probe in T no , and adapter B to each of the others. CATCH performs this for each target sequence t, and each t \"votes\" once (either A or B) for each probe. We seek to maximize the sum, across all probes, of the majority vote for the probe (to ensure a clear decision on the adapter for each probe).

Furthermore, it can force probes to be designed with relaxed assumptions about hybridization across all taxa. To alleviate these issues, we allow different choices of parameters governing hybridization for different subsets of input sequences, so that some can have probes designed with more relaxed assumptions than others.",

Since the number of features on the array was 2.1 million, we repeated the design 6 times (6\u00d7 final probe density). We used these biotinylated single-stranded DNA probes directly for hybrid capture experiments. We performed in solution hybridization and capture according to manufacturer instructions (SeqCapEZ v5.1) with modifications to make the protocol compatible with Nextera XT libraries. Specifically, we pooled up to 6 individual sequencing libraries with at least 1 unique index together at equimolar concentrations (\u2265 3 nm) in a final volume of 50 \u00b5L. We replaced the manufacturer's indexed adapter blockers with oligos complementary to Nextera indexed adapters (P7 blocking oligo: 5'-AAT GAT ACG GCG ACC ACC GAG ATC TAC ACN NNN NNN NTC GTC GGC AGC GTC AGA TGT GTA TAA GAG ACA G/3ddC/-3'; P5 blocking oligo: 5'-CAA GCA GAA GAC GGC ATA CGA GAT NNN NNN NNG TCT CGT GGG CTC GGA GAT GTG TAT AAG AGA CAG /3ddC/-3'; Integrated DNA Technologies). The concentration of Nextera XT adapter blockers was reduced to 200 \u00b5m to account for sample input < 1 \u00b5g. The concentration of probes was also reduced to account for the replication of our V ALL probe set 6\u00d7 across the 2.1 million features. We incubated the hybridization reaction overnight (\u223c 16 hrs). After hybridization and capture on streptavidin beads, we amplified library pools using PCR (14-16 cycles) with universal Illumina PCR primers (P7 primer: 5'-CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGA-3'; P5 primer: 5'-AATGATACGGCGACCACCGA-3'; Integrated DNA Technologies).",

To minimize PCR amplification bias and formation of concatemers by overlap extension we performed two separate emulsion PCR reactions (Micellula, Chimerx) to amplify the nonoverlapping probe subsets (assigned adapters A and B as described above). One primer in each reaction carried a T7 promoter tail (GGATTCTAATACGACTCACTATAGGG) at the 5' end. We performed in vitro transcription (MEGAshortscript, Ambion) on each of these pools to produce biotinylated capture-ready RNA probes. Pools were aliquoted and stored at \u221280 \u2022 C and combined at equal concentration and volume immediately prior to use. Hybrid capture was a modification of a published protocol 82 . Briefly, we mixed the probes, salmon sperm DNA and human Cot-1 DNA, adapter blocking oligonucleotides and libraries and hybridized overnight (\u223c 16 hrs), captured on streptavidin beads, washed, and re-amplified by PCR (16-18 cycles). PCR primers and index blockers were the same as those used in the protocol for the V ALL probe set.

We chose this number as 90% of all samples sequenced on the MiSeq (among the 30 patient and environmental samples used for validation) were sequenced to a depth of at least 200,000 reads. For those few low coverage samples for which we did not obtain > 200,000 reads, we performed all analyses using all available reads unless otherwise noted (Supplementary Table  3 ). Downsampling normalizes sequencing depth across runs and allows us to more readily evaluate the effectiveness of capture on genome assembly (i.e., the fraction of the genome we can assemble) than an approach such as comparing viral reads per million. It also allows us to more readily compare unique content (see below). A statistic like unique viral reads per unique million reads can be distorted based on sequencing depth in the presence of a high fraction of viral PCR duplicate reads: sequencing to a lower depth can inflate the value of this statistic compared to sequencing to a higher depth.",

Here, we used windows of length 150 nt, sliding with a stride of 25 nt. We aligned all probe sequences in V ALL and V WAFR designs to this genome using BWA-MEM 86 with the following options: -a -M -k 8 -A 1 -B 1 -O 2 -E 1 -L 2 -T 20; these sensitive parameters should account for most possible hybridizations, and include a low soft-clipping penalty to allow us to model a portion of a probe hybridizing to a target while the remainder hangs off. We counted the number of bases that match between a probe and target sequence using each alignment's MD tag (this does not count soft-clipped ends), and defined the identity between a probe and target sequence to be this number of matching bases divided by the probe length. We defined the identity between probes and a window of the target genome as follows: we considered all mapped probe sequences that have at least half their alignment within the window, and took the mean of the top 25% of identity values between these probes and the target sequence. In Fig. 3b , we plot a point for each window. We did this separately with probes from the V ALL and V WAFR designs.",

Figure 1 -Parameters used by CATCH in default model of hybridization. CATCH models hybridization between each possible candidate probe and the target sequences. Doing so allows CATCH to decide whether a candidate probe captures (or \"covers\") a region of the target sequence, and thus find a probe set that achieves a desired coverage of the target sequences under this model. For whole genome enrichment, the desired coverage would typically be 100% of each target sequence. (a) Relatively conserved regions (e.g., a particular gene) in the input sequences can be captured with few probes because it is likely that any given probe, under a model of hybridization, will capture observed variation across many or all of the input sequences. Highly variable regions may require many probes to be captured because each given probe may capture the observed variation across only a small fraction of the input sequences. (b) By default, CATCH decides whether a probe hybridizes to a region of a target sequence according to the following parameters: a number m of mismatches to tolerate and a length lcf of a longest common substring. CATCH computes the longest common substring with at most m mismatches between the probe and target subsequence, and decides that the probe hybridizes to the target if and only if the length of this is at least lcf. If the parameter i is provided, CATCH additionally requires that the probe and target subsequence share an exact (0-mismatch) match of length at least i. If CATCH decides that the probe hybridizes to the subsequence of the target with which it shares a substring, then it determines that the probe captures the region equal to the length of the probe as well as e nt on each side of this region. e, termed a cover extension, is a parameter whose value is specified to CATCH, along with m, lcf, and i.
