Social contact networks, which describe the contact relationships among individuals, always exhibit overlapping qualities of communities, hierarchical structure and spatial-correlated. We find that traditional global targeted immunization strategy would lose its superiority in controlling the epidemic propagation in the social contact networks with modular and hierarchical structure. Therefore, we propose a hierarchical targeted immunization strategy to settle this problem. In this novel strategy, importance of the hierarchical structure is considered. Transmission control experiments of influenza H1N1 are carried out based on a modular and hierarchical network model. Results obtained indicate that hierarchical structure of the network is more critical than the degrees of the immunized targets and the modular network layer is the most important for the epidemic propagation control. Finally, the efficacy and stability of this novel immunization strategy have been validated as well.",

Especially for the airborne epidemics, droplets produced by an infected person during his talk, cough and sneeze can cause surrounding individuals to be infected. In recent years, these epidemics had broken out for several times and spread widely. For example, Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) that emerged in 2003 brought a great disaster to the economy and human lives in China. Influenza H1N1 hit many countries in 2009 and led at least 12 220 people to death until December 30th 2009. In addition, common seasonal influenza would always affect human health as well.",

Pastor-Satorras and Vespignani [1] studied the immunization strategy based on scale-free networks [4] , and the results indicated that protection of just a tiny fraction of the most connected individuals raises dramatically tolerance to infections of the whole population. Zanette and Kuperman [3] researched the propagation of epidemics based on the Watts-Strogatz (WS) smallworld network [5] under the action of immunization, and a similar conclusion that the most connected individuals should be protected preferentially was obtained. These two researches were both based on the unweighted networks with single hierarchical structure and the classic targeted immunization strategy was proposed in the researches. Targets in this traditional targeted immunization strategy are decided by evaluating their importance in the global network so we call it global targeted immunization strategy in this paper. However, social contact networks, on which epidemics spread among the crowd depends, always have overlapping qualities of clustering communities and hierarchical structure [6, 7] . For example, the social network in a school consists of several class social networks, and different class social networks still have many links with each other. Furthermore, we find that global targeted immunization strategy loses its superiority in controlling the epidemic propagation in the social contact networks with modular and hierarchical structure. Therefore, it is progressively necessary to study the immunization strategy based on the modular and hierarchical networks and find a more effective one.",

However, social networks only provide possible contact-objects. One individual would contact with different objects at different frequency and probability. Therefore, selection of immunized targets should consider the following two factors: One is the heterogeneity of links which can be measured by nodes' degrees. Because the more links an individual has, the more objects may be infected. The other one is the heterogeneity of effective contacts between two individuals, which is mainly caused by the modular and hierarchical structure.

Specifically, following two steps can realize the strategy: First, according to the number of targets to be immunized, as many modular networks as possible need to be selected randomly.

These individuals are called ''optimal targets''. If some of the optimal targets are not vaccinated, epidemics will spread among the whole crowd.

To distinguish the impacts of every layer, in each experiment, we selected 60% of the best connected individuals in the global network from a different layer to be the non-vaccinated optimal targets.

The ''worst connection strategy'' does not change the fractions of the non-vaccinated individuals that have been infected seriously. Individuals that have less links in the modular network layer are still more essential than the individuals in the other layers.

Aggravation of the epidemic transmission obviously weakened the control effects of the hierarchical targeted immunization more. However, r g /r h still stays above 1 and this trend is generally steady as the number of initial infected individuals increases (Fig. 5) . Therefore, it has been validated that hierarchical targeted immunization has better effects than global targeted immunization and this ascendency is stable.",

It shows a better effect than global targeted immunization. Though the gain is modest, this strategy can provide more protection for the crowds with modular and hierarchical social contact network structures. The network model used in this paper integrates individual geospatial locations and does widely exist, so the hierarchical targeted immunization strategy, which is proposed based on it, can be adopted widely in the real cases. Considering the similarity between rumors and epidemics, this work is feasible to be used to control the face-to-face transmitted rumors diffusion in crowds as well.",

Second, effects that the hierarchical structure brings to epidemic dynamics will be explored further, such as research on susceptible-infective-susceptible (SIS) [15] style epidemic control and relationship between the hierarchical structure and individual's degree. Third, identifying transmission paths in the network might be also a promising direction. Since vaccination belongs to a static method to control the epidemic propagation, it still cannot supply a sufficient protection when vaccines are limited. Thus, when one epidemic is spreading in crowds, other measures such as insulating the infected or potential infected individuals should be taken as well and transmission paths identification will be a key factor to them.",
