            "text": "Among the many medical applications of systems biology, we contend that infectious disease is one of the most important and tractable targets. We take the view that the complexity of the immune system is an inevitable consequence of its evolution, and this complexity has frustrated reductionist efforts to develop host-directed therapies for infection. However, since hosts vary widely in susceptibility and tolerance to infection, host-directed therapies are likely to be effective, by altering the biology of a susceptible host to induce a response more similar to a host who survives. Such therapies should exert minimal selection pressure on organisms, thus greatly decreasing the probability of pathogen resistance developing. A systems medicine approach to infection has the potential to provide new solutions to old problems: to identify host traits that are potentially amenable to therapeutic intervention, and the host immune factors that could be targeted by hostdirected therapies. Furthermore, undiscovered sub-groups with different responses to treatment are almost certain to exist among patients presenting with life-threatening infection, since this population is markedly clinically heterogeneous. A major driving force behind high-throughput clinical phenotyping studies is the aspiration that these subgroups, hitherto opaque to observation, may be observed in the data generated by new technologies. Subgroups of patients are unlikely to be staticserial clinical and biological phenotyping may reveal different trajectories through the pathophysiology of disease, in which different therapeutic approaches are required. We suggest there are two major goals for systems biology in infection medicine: (1) to identify subgroups of patients that share treatable features; and, (2) to integrate high-throughput data from clinical and in vitro sources in order to predict tractable therapeutic targets with the potential to alter disease trajectories for individual patients.",

In this review, we consider how systems biology approaches may be leveraged to address the major unmet needs in infection medicine in the 21st century, with the aim of improving outcomes for patients with infection. In clinical practice we are unable to therapeutically modulate the host immune response to infection, largely due to its inevitable complexity. Despite this, we contend that host-directed therapies have a high probability of success, since there is already considerable innate variation in host responses to infectious disease, ranging from extreme susceptibility, to complete resistance, and tolerance. Infectious diseases are survivable if you have the right genetics. The challenge is to make the same diseases survivable for patients who would otherwise succumb.",

For example, one of the first innate immune mechanisms encountered by many pathogens is phagocytosis, which serves to both prime the adaptive response and eliminate invading pathogens by intracellular killing. Pathogenic Yersinia species, a group of facultative intracellular pathogens, encode a type three secretion system to directly inject effector proteins into the host cell cytoplasm, modulating the cytoskeleton to prevent phagocytosis, and inducing apoptosis of immune cells and blocking the MAPK and NF-kB pathways to reduce cytokine production [4] . Another bacterium, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, secretes a protease that cleaves a host protein (corticosteroid-binding globulin) to release the corticosteroid hormone cortisol at the site of initial infection, incapacitating the local innate immune response [5] . Even the relatively tiny genome of the influenza A virus encodes a protein (NS1) which is nonessential for replication and seems to be dedicated to interfering with both the induction and action of the host antiviral interferon response by sequestering viral dsRNA, preventing activation of RIG-1 signalling and inhibiting protein kinase R and OAS/RNase L [6] .",

The adaptive immune system in mammals is thought to have arisen 500 million years ago in fish [10] . Since these initial events, the immune system in each host species has participated in a genetic arms race, evolving alongside relentless exposure to these microbial immune interference strategies from innumerable pathogens. Furthermore, the immune system must successfully distinguish self from non-self antigens, with deleterious consequences arising (i.e. autoimmune disease) when this fails. The requirement to overcome these microbial immune interference strategies whilst preserving the recognition of self-antigens has provided the necessary pressure to drive the human immune system to evolve into a hugely complex organ system. In the context of this inevitable complexity, it is no surprise that reductionist approaches to development of hosttargeted therapies in infectious disease have largely A subgroup within a population of patients who are distinguished by a shared disease process.

Furthermore, much of this variation is heritable [11] .

Firstly, the development of therapies to modulate the host immune response is impeded by the inevitable complexity of the human immune system. Secondly, the range and degree of characterisation of clinical syndromes in medicine is constrained by the range of observations that are available; we likely fail to identify sub-groups of patients with treatable traits due to a paucity of relevant observations. The promise of systems approaches to infection medicine is that new technologies may provide solutions to these old problems. Large-scale biological data-sets from an increasing range of high-throughput technologies are becoming available, including (but not limited to) high-resolution transcriptional profiling [24] , mass spectrometry-based proteomics [25] and metabolomics, genome-scale CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screening [26] , and whole genome sequencing/genome-wide association studies. These modalities could provide new, biologically important observations that have not previously been observed in patients. It is very likely that some of these observations will be directly relevant to clinical management e the challenge will be to identify the ones that matter.",

Pathological changes in mice are very similar to humans and there is a dose-response relationship between viral inoculum and the severity of ALI. Host responses to the virus that result in ALI are poorly understood. To investigate host responses associated with more severe acute lung injury in a murine model of SARS Coronavirus (SARS-CoV) infection, transcriptomic profiles of mice infected with lethal and sub-lethal doses of virus were compared and correlated with pathological data at multiple time points, then subject to bioinformatic network analysis [39] . A module of genes involved in cell adhesion, extracellular matrix remodelling and wound healing was significantly up-regulated in the lethal infection model, and components of the urokinase pathway were found to be the most enriched and differentially regulated. Massspectrometry proteomic analysis was then used to explore this transcriptional data further, demonstrating that SARS-CoV infection resulted in increased expression of fibrin b and g chains, factor VIII and cytokeratins (all components of hyaline membranes), and reduced expression of surfactant proteins in the lung. These data are consistent with histological post-mortem findings in SARS-CoV infected humans, where extensive fibrin exudate, extensive hyaline membrane formation and alveolar collapse have been observed [40] . Serpine1 is part of the urokinase pathway and contributes to ECM remodelling. To confirm this finding from transcriptional and proteomic studies, Serpine1e/e knockout mice were infected with SARS-CoV and found to have a worse outcome compared to wild type mice. This systemsbased approach to SARS-CoV, sequentially applying transcriptional, proteomic then genetic modification techniques, demonstrates that the urokinase pathway contributes to ALI, thus identifying a target for future experimental medicine work to determine if it can be therapeutically altered to benefit the host.",
