Dysplastic changes such as megaloblastic rubricytes, neutrophil hypersegmentation, or giant platelets may be subtle indicators of myelodysplastic syndrome or certain myeloid leukemias. \u2022 The suspicion of marrow malignancy warrants bone marrow evaluation. Leukemia may be occult (ie, blast cells may be numerous in the bone marrow, but few or no blast cells are seen in the peripheral blood [subleukemic or aleukemic leukemia]). \u2022 Unexplained elevations in blood cell numbers should suggest bone marrow evaluation. Note that relative erythrocytosis may result from splenic contraction, hypovolemia, physiological induced cardiac disease, and high-altitude hypoxia and in certain dog breeds (eg, greyhounds), all of which do not require bone marrow examination. Certain neoplasms can produce excessive erythropoietin (leading to erythrocytosis) or granulocyte and/or granulocyte-macrophage colony-stimulating factors (leading to leukocytosis) as a result of renal hypoxia or a paraneoplastic secretion. A reactive leukocytosis due to a nidus of inflammation is more common and should be excluded before pursuing the possibility of a paraneoplastic or neoplastic process to explain the elevation. Marked thrombocytosis can result from increased thrombopoietin or thrombopoietic cytokine stimulation, which may occur in chronic iron deficiency anemia and in various inflammatory/infectious conditions. 1 The possibility that persistent thrombocytosis may indicate an underlying myeloproliferative disorder such as a myelodysplastic syndrome or essential thrombocythemia must also be ruled out, particularly if an underlying etiology cannot be found. The latter may be independent of thrombopoietin stimulation; bone marrow examination in these conditions often reveals marked megakaryocytic hyperplasia with morphologic abnormality. Lymphocytosis may indicate antigenic stimulation but marked elevations in lymphoid cells should suggest possible malignancy. Chronic lymphocytic leukemia (CLL) of B-cell immunophenotype in the dog has significant infiltration of the bone marrow in contrast to CLL of T-cell origin, which circulates in peripheral blood but originates from the spleen. 2 T-CLL is more common than B-CLL in the dog compared to the human. \u2022 Hypercalcemia may occur without obvious etiology such related to the presence of an anal mass or hyperparathyroidism. In these situations, occult lymphoid neoplasia with only bone marrow involvement should be considered. \u2022 Focal lymphoma or plasma cell myeloma produces bone lysis and may only be recognized with early disease through core biopsy procedure. \u2022 Hyperproteinemia with either a monoclonal or polyclonal gammopathy supports bone marrow evaluation for neoplasia or an infectious agent. Both B-CLL and plasma cell neoplasia may present with a monoclonal gammopathy. Systemic fungal and protozoal infectious agents such as Histoplasma and Leishmania may infiltrate the bone marrow and present with hyperglobulinemia. Others may not be visible but still result in gammopathy such as Ehrlichia canis.",

            "text": "Fever of unexplained origin often arises from immune-mediated causes but may also reflect a non-immune-mediated etiology where bone marrow evaluation becomes a useful diagnostic tool. Primary bone marrow abnormalities accounted for 22 of 101 canine cases of pyrexia of unknown origin, with myelodysplasia and lymphoid leukemia being most responsible. 3 \u2022 Leukoerythroblastosis identified by concurrent immature granulocytes and nucleated red cells in circulation may indicate bone marrow damage caused by neoplastic infiltration of the bone marrow. While the presence of nucleated red cells in circulation may reflect bone marrow damage, the presence of a concurrent and significant left shift was key in supporting examination of the bone marrow leading to the discovery of a disseminated adenocarcinoma in a dog. 4 \u2022 Therapeutic monitoring of chemotherapy administration and determination of clinical staging for malignancies such as lymphoma or mast cell tumor require bone marrow evaluation. Aspiration and core biopsies are recommended to determine changes in hematopoietic cell prevalence as well as the pattern of neoplastic cell infiltration. A focal type of metastasis is the most difficult to determine by blood smears or marrow aspirates alone. Core biopsy is useful to determine whether mast cells are in their normal perivascular location or abnormally in sheets of cells. Core biopsy examination of the bone marrow in canine lymphoma affords greater sensitivity than aspirate smears due to the manner of metastasis seen histologically. 5 \u2022 Evaluation of iron stores is helpful in determining iron sequestration within macrophages. Marrow evaluation for iron in cats may be unproductive, because their bone marrow normally lacks discernible storage levels. Similarly, neonatal animals often rapidly use iron for erythropoiesis, and storage amounts are low. While both anemia of inflammatory disease and iron deficiency anemia in dogs present with low serum iron, there is a different appearance relative to iron stores within the bone marrow. Iron deficiency anemia has low to absent stores while anemia of inflammatory disease has normal to excessive amounts of hemosiderin in the bone marrow. 6",

It is relatively cheap and easy to perform and has a rapid turnaround time, providing diagnostic information within minutes of collection. The histologic biopsy provides similar information relative to cell types but more importantly allows architectural evaluation of fat and fibrous connective tissue relative to cellular content. Focal changes of the stroma and determination of overall cellularity are best appreciated by histologic biopsy samples. Such changes, which may be missed by aspiration biopsy alone, include inflammation, neoplasia, marrow necrosis, osteolysis, or myelofibrosis. For maximum information, the two techniques are concurrently performed and interpreted along with the complete blood count (CBC) data obtained within 1 day of the biopsy.",

The number of particles and overall degree of cellularity, megakaryocyte numbers, as well as presence of low numbers of abnormal cells such as carcinoma cells or focal accumulations of round cells, are assessed at this power. For normocellular marrow particles, the hematopoietic cells should be piled up on the stroma of the spicules, but vacuoles of fat are still present; the overall cellularity should be greater than 25% but less than 75%. Hypocellular marrow has readily visible stromal cells and abundant fat (\u03fe75% of the particles area is fat) with few hematopoietic cells. On the other hand, hypercellular marrow contains no or rare fat vacuoles and an abundance of cells (\u03fe75% of the particles are composed of cells). An absence of particles in films of the bone marrow aspirate may preclude valid estimation of cellularity and megakaryocyte number in most instances. Megakaryocytes are often identified within or very near the particles and estimates of their numbers are quite subjective. If more than a few megakaryocytes are found, then the number is designated as \"adequate\"; if almost none are present, then decreased; if many are present, then increased.",

At the very least, several hundred cells should be counted; granulocytes, nucleated erythroid cells, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and other cells are enumerated. The majority of cells in a marrow smear are differentiating granulocytes, monocytes, and erythroid cells. In normal marrow, neutrophils are the most numerous with monocytes, eosinophils, and basophils collectively accounting for only 5% to 10% of the total myelomonocytic cells. The marrow report should indicate the relative number of granulocytic and erythroid cells in the form of an M:E ratio. In health, the M:E ratio is approximately 1 but can range from 2 to 0.5, depending on the species ( Table 1) . The balance and completeness of maturation in the three hematopoietic cell lines should be assessed. In each series, cells in the late stages of differentiation, the postmitotic pool, should be far more numerous (approximately 85% of the total cells in that series) than the immature stages.

Lymphocytes and plasma cells and macrophages are commonly present in low number, scattered throughout the marrow and collectively are fewer than approximately 10% of all the nucleated cells (see Table 1 ). In the cat, small/mature lymphocytes may represent up to 20% of all the cells. These cells are also slightly more numerous in immature animals than in adult animals.

Differentiating hematopoietic cells in all series should be evaluated for morphologic evidence of disturbed maturation, such as dysplastic and toxic changes, and left shift. Toxic changes are apparent only in neutrophils and are associated with stimulated granulocytopoiesis, particularly in inflammation. Dysplastic change or (morphologic evidence of abnormal maturation) in erythroid cells and megakaryocytes most commonly are associated with neoplastic disorders of hematopoiesis-myelodysplastic syndromes and acute myeloid leukemias. A pronounced left shift in a series can represent a \"maturation block,\" which can result from destruction of cells in later stages of maturation or from intrinsic defect in regulation of differentiation (hematopoietic neoplasia), or can represent a transient stage in a wave of regeneration after acute injury to marrow, such as myelotoxic drug, acute radiation, or feline panleukopenia infection. Feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infection in cats causes a wide range of dysplastic changes in hematopoietic cells and/or alterations in their numbers-these findings are often disparate, ranging from nonregenerative anemia to erythremic myelosis, neutropenia to leukemia, and thrombocytopenia to megakaryocytic leukemia.

The adventitial-reticular (A-R) cell or stromal cell that lines most marrow sinuses influences the change in adipose or fibrous tissue content. The A-R cell will project its cell processes into hematopoietic cords for support and produce reticulin (argentiphilic) fibers during early bone marrow injury. Fibroblasts that produce collagen may also arise from the A-R cells during severe marrow injury or in response to cytokines (platelet-derived growth factor, transforming growth factor-\u2424) released from monocytes and neoplastic megakaryocytes.

The bone marrow may be hyperplastic relative to megakaryocyte numbers in consumptive or destructive platelet disorders such as subacute to chronic disseminated intravascular coagulopathy or immune-mediated thrombocytopenia. Immunemediated destruction of platelets has been associated with drug therapy and various neoplasms (mast cell, hemangiosarcoma, mixed mammary tumor, or nasal adenocarcinoma). 7 Therefore, bone marrow hyperplasia may be expected in the presence of these conditions.

            "text": "Dysplasia refers to abnormal growth of cells. Cytologically, these abnormalities include asynchronous maturation of the nucleus and cytoplasm resulting in megaloblastic erythroid precursors, dwarf megakaryocytes, or abnormally segmented neutrophils. Dysplasia may affect one cell line (eg, erythroid, as occurs in lead toxicity or poodle macrocytosis) or two or more cell lines may be affected as may occur with nutritional deficiencies or drug-induced toxicosis. 9 These secondary myelodysplastic cases should be distinguished from the primary myelodysplastic syndrome. 10 Myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) is a term used to designate a group of disorders characterized by peripheral blood cytopenias; however, the marrow is either hypercellular or normocellular for the corresponding cell lineage and there is morphologic evidence of dysplasia in one or more cell lines. Blast cell forms compose less than 20% of nucleated cells. 11 It is believed that normal blood cell maturation, differentiation, function, and survival are impaired, leading to the development of peripheral blood pancytopenia; patients may be at increased risk to transform to AML. 12 Primary MDSs are irreversible acquired developmental disorders of bone marrow stem cells unrelated to concurrent disease, nutritional deficiency, or drug-induced toxicosis. 10 MDSs may be divided into two subtypes (MDS-refractory cytopenia and MDS-excess blasts) depending on the percentage of blast cells in the bone marrow. 13 Cases of MDS-excess blasts, those with 5% or greater percentage of myeloblasts, demonstrate shorter survival and poor response to treatment. 10 MDS is sometimes referred to as preleukemia as patients with this syndrome often suffer from chronic debilitation that may continue unchanged or evolve into acute leukemia. The cause is often unknown, but the condition has been associated with FeLV infections. 14 Ineffective erythropoiesis, granulocytopoiesis, and megakaryocytopoiesis are terms applied to the situation in which there is hyperplasia of a cell line in marrow but persistence of the corresponding cytopenia in blood with no evidence of a cause of peripheral loss. Intramedullary death of precursor cells, usually by apoptosis, is inferred from this finding; the most common cause is immune-mediated destruction of precursor cells. 15 Erythroid, myeloid, and/or megakaryocytic hypoplasia are terms applied to the situation in which there are fewer precursor cells than appropriate for the number of mature cells in peripheral blood. For example, the absence of erythroid hyperplasia in an anemic patient would be called erythroid hypoplasia denoting some degree of suppression of erythropoiesis. While the number of erythroid cells in marrow from patients with anemia of inflammatory disease or renal failure may be within normal limits for a nonanemic animal, it is hypoplastic in light of a low hematocrit. Dogs with Sertoli cell tumors may have severe bone marrow hypoplasia due to suppressive effects of estrogen produced by the tumor. 16 Hypoplasia may also result with the effects of infectious agents including viruses (eg, FeLV, FIV, feline coronavirus, feline parvovirus, canine parvovirus, canine distemper virus), rickettsia, protozoa, and fungi. Drugs are often responsible for bone marrow damage and include anticonvulsants, antineoplastic agents, estrogen, and antibiotics such as chloramphenicol and trimethoprim-sulfadiazine. 17 Patients with endocrine disturbances, chronic renal failure, or intestinal malabsorption may have hypoplasia of the erythroid line alone. 18 Hypoplasia of granulocytic lines can result from various infections and toxic insults. 19 Animals admitted for tumor resection and receiving antineoplastic agents should be evaluated for the presence of drug-related myelosuppression. Less common causes involve hereditary disorders, marrow necrosis, immune-mediated disease, myelophthisis, and irradiation. Cytologically, when the hematocrit or CBC is not provided but the marrow particles appear hypocellular with more fat than cells and there is an increased M:E, one is not certain whether erythroid production is less than expected. In this case it can be said that there is a relative erythroid hypoplasia compared to the granulocytic response.",

            "text": "Aplastic anemia is a term applied to the situation in which the marrow is devoid of hematopoietic cells and has been replaced by fat. Destruction or suppression of multipotential hematopoietic stem cells is implicated by this finding. Causative mechanisms may include myelotoxic substances, immune-mediated mechanisms, and some infectious diseases (eg, canine ehrlichiosis). 20, 21 Selective absence of one cell line with normal production of cells in the other two lines is called pure red cell aplasia, pure white cell aplasia, or amegakaryocytosis. 22 Immune-mediated attack (eg, young cats with pure red cell aplasia) on committed progenitor cells of the affected series is the apparent cause in most cases. 23 Plasmacytosis, lymphocytosis, histiocytosis, and mastocytosis are descriptive terms for increased numbers of plasma cells, lymphocytes, macrophages, and mast cells in marrow samples. Whether the increase is reactive or neoplastic must be determined in each case from other clinical and laboratory findings. When marrow injury is mild, with minimal cell destruction, a reactive response usually occurs. Reactivity is a nonspecific immune response involving an increase in such cells as plasma cells, mast cells, macrophages, and eosinophils. B-cell hyperplasia has been associated with FIV infection in cats. 24 Necrosis and myelofibrosis are morphologic changes associated with bone marrow destruction with subsequent healing response. Infection, drugs, chemicals, neoplasia, radiation, or immune destruction may damage the bone marrow. When the insult is severe enough to damage the microcirculation, causing ischemia or directly destroying the hematopoietic cells, permanent and irreversible necrosis may occur. 25 The prognosis is generally poor because long-term supportive care is necessary. If necrosis or marrow injury is moderate, attempts to repair the affected area may result in increased numbers of reticulin and collagen fibers, a condition termed myelofibrosis. This is considered a secondary response and may be reversible. 26 In both necrosis and myelofibrosis, bone marrow aspirates often contain particles with low cellularity, much blood contamination, and occasional fibrocytes present. For this reason, a core biopsy sample obtained concurrently with the aspirate biopsy is necessary for confirmation of these conditions. In some cases, the suspicion of connective tissue infiltration may need to be confirmed with special histochemical stains. The peripheral blood may reveal few changes or show severe cytopenias.",
