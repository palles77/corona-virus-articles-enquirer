Systems vary in the proportion of care delivered by public versus private facilities, in their emphasis on primary, secondary and tertiary care, in the levels and sources of funding, by the populations they serve, in the burden of disease faced by their populations, and in the level of development of the environments of human and technological infrastructure. Nevertheless, there is consensus that health information systems may have a pivotal role to play in improving quality and efficiency in all of these contexts [1] , though the nature of such technological systems as well as the roles and relative importance of their individual components and their sequence of emergence will be conditioned by sociopolitical, historical, and geographical realities.",

The SHR enables pointof-service applications (eg, EMRs or pharmacy information systems) to store key clinical data such as a summary of care, laboratory test results, or vitals. The SHR can manage both structured data that is reconcilable with standard exchange formats (eg, discrete clinical observations) and unstructured data such as a digital image with associated patient information. Additionally, point-of-service systems can update existing patient records in the SHR with new information while preserving a version history. However, the data stored in the SHR should be restricted to include only information that is deemed relevant for sharing within the implementing nation or region [10] . The SHR should not necessarily contain a complete dump of information from all point-of-service systems in the nation or region, but rather contain relevant information that when shared gives a complete view of a patient's medical history. Table 10 .1 provides a list of some of the pertinent types of clinical data that may be stored in an SHR. An SHR also enables client services to retrieve clinical information from the repository as needed to improve the delivery of care. The SHR can provide end users with a complete longitudinal medical history for a particular patient. In addition, client systems can query the SHR to retrieve a partial subset of a patient's medical history that has been restricted to a specific time frame or a unique type of observation. For example, a physician caring for a patient with a high diastolic blood pressure may want to know if the elevated blood pressure is a trend or just an isolated occurrence in order to determine the appropriate approach for treatment. The physician could acquire this information by querying the SHR to retrieve a list of the patient's blood pressure during each previous encounter.",

The HMIS primarily supports management or administration of a health system, and it contains a wide range of aggregate level data. The HMIS aggregates individual clinical records that are shared within an HIE in order to provide indicators that characterize the health of the underlying population at the provider, facility, state, or national level. In addition, the HMIS should contain data on human resource distribution, population figures, service availability, and service quality such as the efficiency of the supply chain. This opens up for added value analysis of the aggregated clinical data. The information in the HMIS is available for reporting purposes and is intended to improve the administration and development of public health programs rather than the delivery of clinical care [11] .

A health indicator is a metric that is routinely reported to provide insight into the characteristics of a population or the performance of a program [13] . An accurate assessment of the current health status of the population and influential factors within the community is essential for elevating the overall health of the community [14] . Important health indicators may constitute clinical outcomes (eg, mortality rates for cancer) or the prevalence of important health risk factors such as obesity or smoking [14] . These health indicators can be leveraged to drive public health action such as policy changes or interventions to address significant health issues [15] . Programs such as Healthy People 2020 use health indicators to help direct their agendas [13] . Aggregated health indicators allow Healthy People 2020 and other programs to identify crucial public health issues (eg, increasing prevalence of cardiovascular disease), institute goals for improving the issue (eg, reduce the mortality rate for cardiovascular diseases by 15% within 10 years), and then evaluate progress toward those goals (eg, compare the baseline mortality rate to the current mortality rate) [13] .",

OpenHIE provides three different types of modules that facilitate the processing and storage of data using the OpenMRS platform including interface modules, a content handler module, and processing modules (depicted in Fig. 10.1) . The interface modules provide service interfaces that enable an external application to access the data in the SHR. A content handler module is used to receive data from the service interfaces, and pass the information on to the proper processing module for storage. Processing modules provide the capacity to decipher information in a specific format so that it can be stored in or retrieved from the OpenMRS system. For example, a robust HIE may require a processing module that accommodates Health Level Seven (HL7) version 2 documents, processing modules for multiple types of clinical document architecture (CDA) documents, and a processing module that supports unstructured documents. Fig. 10 .1 illustrates the architecture of the components that would enable OpenMRS to be implemented as the SHR for OpenHIE.",

A relational database has tables that consist of rows that represent records and columns that contain descriptive characteristics such as heart rate, age, or gender. Assigning a unique identifier to each row enables the table to be linked to rows from other tables in the database that share the same identifier. For example, if a researcher needed to combine a table that contained patient heights with a table that contained patient weights in order to calculate BMI, an SQL statement could be written to link the two tables together by matching the unique patient identifier from each table.",

This flexibility allows a NoSQL DBMSs to manage the diversity of formats associated with medical data more easily than a traditional RDBMS. Additionally, NoSQL DBMSs enable horizontal scaling to increase system capacity if the need arises [27, 30] . Horizontal scalability describes the capability of the DBMS to disburse the data and workload among multiple servers [30] . However, there are also some drawbacks to NoSQL DBMSs. RDBMSs are able to complete transactions without losing data or being corrupted with more reliability than NoSQL DBMSs [27] .",

Aggregate health data messages could originate in an HL7 compliant EMR system, but are just as likely to be mined from the logistics management system for cold chain management data or from simple community health worker mobile phone applications. For this reason, the HMIS community within OpenHIE is actively driving the development of a new profile in the QRPH (Quality Research and Public Health) committee of IHE called ADX (Aggregate Data Exchange). ADX is not a CDA document, owing more of its ancestry to SDMX-HD.

This stems partly from a dominant institutional logic of EHR implementations driven by the needs of transactional use case requirements rather than quality reporting and the related consequences in completeness and quality of data. The study from the Netherlands [38] , for example, shows that the accuracy of indicator data derived from EHR is not necessarily better than that which was obtained from the paper registers. This result is also consistent with what the authors have seen in implementations in Rwanda and has been described in India [40] . The results are also consistent with other studies examining the quality of data in EHR-captured clinical documentation [41] as well as HIE transactions [42, 43] . With the increasing focus on quality reporting from EHR in OECD countries coupled with the continued growth of EHR in countries of the global South, we can expect these challenges to receive greater and urgent attention.",

A report from IOM highlights that EHR systems in the United States currently do a poor job of capturing data on the social determinants of health. Therefore, for SHR and HMIS components to support analyses of social determinants, new types of data will need to be added to Table  10 .1. Additional indicators will also need to be defined as they emerge in various nations (eg, which social determinants will be of highest priority will vary by nation). Pilot efforts in Indiana as well as Oregon are just starting to gather, integrate, and analyze social determinants in combination with data from EHR systems [49, 50] .
