It is known that in patients who have undergone terminal ileal resection or have reduced ileal function due to disease, bile acid absorption is reduced, leading to the presence of bile acids in the colon. Here they cause chloride and water secretion and increase colonic motility, resulting in diarrhoea, so-called secondary or type 1 bile acid malabsorption (Johnston and others 2011) . The prevalence of bile acid malabsorption is between 10 and 35.3 per cent in people with chronic diarrhoea, depending on the serum C4 cut-off used (Wedlake and others 2009, Slattery and others 2015) .",

            "text": "Various methods have been described to diagnose bile acid malabsorption in humans (Vijayvargiya and others 2013) . Until recently, the most commonly utilised was the 75 selenium homotaurocholic acid test (SeHCAT); this uses a synthetic radioactive bile acid, the retention time of which can be measured using a gamma camera (Balzer 1995) . A downstream product of one of the major enzymes in the bile acid synthesis pathway is 7\u03b1-hydroxy-4-cholesten-3-one (C4) and, in people, blood concentrations show good correlation with the rate of bile acid synthesis (Galman and others 2003) . Bile acid synthesis is increased in patients with bile acid malabsorption as they have increased faecal bile acid losses and therefore less recycling of bile acids through the process of enterohepatic recirculation (Camilleri and others 2009 ). Multiple studies have now shown good correlation between serum C4 and SeHCAT in the diagnosis of bile acid malabsorption with a sensitivity of 87-90 per cent and specificity of 79-86 per cent compared with SeHCAT (Eusufzai and others 1993 , Brydon and others 1996 , Fan and Sellin 2009 , Johnston and others 2011 , Grutzner and others 2014 . C4 has significant advantages over other methods as it only requires one blood sample, avoids radiation risks and does not require immediate access to expensive equipment. To the authors' knowledge, bile acid malabsorption has not been documented in dogs or cats, nor has SeHCAT been described. However, the authors have anecdotal evidence of a clinical response of patients with refractory chronic enteropathies to the bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine, which is a commonly used drug for this condition in people (Pattni and Walters 2009 ). An improved ability to recognise and diagnose cases of bile acid malabsorption would have significant clinical benefit as these cases may require specific treatments for this condition and may be less likely to respond to conventional therapy. The purpose of this study was to document serum C4 concentration in a group of dogs with chronic diarrhoea and to compare this to a group of clinically healthy control dogs. The authors hypothesised that approximately 10 per cent of dogs with chronic diarrhoea would be affected by bile acid malabsorption, indicated by an elevated serum C4 concentration; this figure was based on the reported prevalence in people with chronic enteropathies (Wedlake and others 2009) . They also hypothesised that dogs with hypocobalaminaemia may be more likely to have elevated serum C4 as cobalamin and bile acids are absorbed in a similar region of the small intestine. Lastly, serum C4 concentration was compared with the canine chronic enteropathy activity index in order to determine whether bile acid malabsorption was related to clinical disease severity.",

            "text": "Control dogs had a serum C4 range from 15.1 to 180.1 nmol/l (median 80.9 nmol/l), dogs with chronic diarrhoea had a serum C4 range from 21.3 to 518.6 nmol/l (median 59.9 nmol/l) and there was no significant difference in the C4 concentration between these two groups (P=0.8). Figure 1 shows a boxplot of the serum C4 concentration in the two groups. Serum cobalamin and canine chronic enteropathy activity index were available for all clinical cases. Cobalamin concentration ranged from 100 to 834 pg/ml (median 338 pg/ml), and canine chronic enteropathy activity index scores ranged from 4 to 15 (median 7). When assessing the relationship between serum C4 concentration and serum cobalamin, no statistically significant relationship was identified (P=0.6, correlation coefficient=\u22120.11). There was also no statistically significant relationship between canine chronic enteropathy activity index and serum C4 (P=0.6, correlation coeffi-cient=\u22120.04). A cut-off value for serum C4 concentration of 187.2 nmol/l on the ROC curve resulted in a specificity of 100 per cent (95 per cent CI 81.5 to 100 per cent) and a sensitivity of 25 per cent (95 per cent CI 5.3 to 48.6 per cent) for presumptive diagnosis of bile acid malabsorption in this group of dogs (Fig 2) , with a positive predictive value (PPV) of 100 per cent (95 per cent CI 31 to 100 per cent) and a negative predictive value (NPV) of 59 per cent (95 per cent CI 41 to 75 per cent). If 187.2 nmol/l is set as the upper limit of normal, then three (17.6 per cent; 95 per cent CI 6.2 to 41.0 per cent) of the clinical cases with chronic diarrhoea had a serum C4 concentration significantly above this (at least twice this upper limit). The greatest serum C4 concentration (518.6 nmol/l) was observed in an 11-year-old, neutered male border terrier. This dog was diagnosed with suspected inflammatory bowel disease, which was partially, although never fully, responsive to dietary modification and immunosuppressive medication ( prednisolone and azathioprine). This dog had a serum cobalamin concentration within the reference range (550 pg/ml). The second case with a marked serum C4 elevation (438.0 nmol/l) was a 6-year-old, neutered male border collie. This dog had a complex medical history of previous primary hypoparathyroidism and more recent inflammatory bowel disease. Concerns regarding the effect of prednisolone on serum calcium concentrations prevented use of this drug, and so the dog was primarily managed with chlorambucil and dietary modification; however, his diarrhoea was also poorly responsive to this treatment. Interestingly, at a later time this case was trialled on cholestyramine and showed an improvement in faecal consistency; however, a further dietary modification was made at the same time, making the response difficult to interpret. This dog also had significant hypocobalaminaemia (100 pg/ml), suggesting marked distal small intestinal disease. The third case (serum C4 concentration 362.7 nmol/l) was a 5-year-old, neutered female Jack Russell terrier cross. This dog presented for investigation of chronic diarrhoea and panhypoproteinaemia and was diagnosed with idiopathic inflammatory bowel disease. She was treated with prednisolone, chlorambucil and metronidazole, along with dietary modification. This resulted in an improvement of clinical signs and normalisation of serum proteins; however, the diarrhoea persisted intermittently. Malabsorption of bile acids may offer a potential explanation for the limited response of the diarrhoea to therapy; however, no therapeutic trials were ever performed to confirm this. This dog had a serum cobalamin concentration at the lower end of the reference range (310 pg/ml).",

In people, the reference range for serum C4 is 14.3-60.7 nmol/l. However, 12 (60 per cent) of the control dogs in this study had a concentration outside that reference range, suggesting that the reference range in dogs may be higher. The ROC analysis suggests that a cut-off value of 187.2 nmol/l would give a high specificity for the suspected diagnosis of bile acid malabsorption. The sensitivity in this study was low; largely due to the small sample size. This is likely to be improved if only dogs with a poor response to conventional therapy were tested, in which the suspicion of bile acid malabsorption might be higher. The high specificity and high PPV suggest that this test would be most useful as a screening test to increase clinical suspicion of bile acid This test is relatively inexpensive to perform (approximately \u00a330 per sample), but is currently only available through a small number of specialist human hospital labs. However, it is being run more commonly in people and so it is likely to become more widely available in the future. The reliability of the test is also excellent, with a low coefficient of variation both intra-assay and interassay (see online supplementary appendix 1).",

One of the cases with particularly high serum C4 concentration did have a very low serum cobalamin, suggesting that significant distal small intestinal pathology may lead to both these changes in some cases.

Glucocorticoids have been shown to upregulate the bile acid transporter apical sodium linked bile acid transporter (ASBT) in people (Johnston and others 2011), which may explain the positive response to these medications in many cases. Glucocorticoids form the mainstay of immunosuppressive treatment in inflammatory intestinal diseases and may be treating bile acid malabsorption as a useful side effect of therapy. The bile acid sequestrant cholestyramine is the first-line treatment in most people with bile acid malabsorption and is effective in between 63 and 100 per cent of people in different studies (Wilcox and others 2014) . This has been used successfully in both dogs and cats; however, it is not licensed in either of these species. An alternative sequestrant is colesevelam, which has shown benefit in patients who were intolerant or unresponsive to cholestyramine (Beigel and others 2014) . However, to the authors' knowledge, colesevelam has not been used on canine patients. It is likely that dietary management is also important in managing these cases. Increasing dietary fat has been shown to increase faecal bile acid secretion in people (Koga and others 1984) , and therefore, a low-fat diet is probably preferred (Westergaard 2007) .",
