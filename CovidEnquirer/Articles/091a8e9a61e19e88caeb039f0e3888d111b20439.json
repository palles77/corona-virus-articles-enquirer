In fact, Xinyang, Nanyang and Zhumadian are all near Hubei-the worst affected province in China. It was reported that about five million people have left Wuhan since January 23. According to the investigation from Xu et al.

We guess that there are three possible reasons that may result to such gender difference. Firstly, males may be more active and with wider social activities than females, which increases their risk to infect COVID-19. Secondly and may be the most reasonable, an existing medical investigation reported that the expression and distribution of angiotension converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was wider in male patients than those in females [5] . Similarly to SARS-CoV, it is reported that COVID-19 invades human body through the ACE2 receptor. Based on single cell RNA sequencing technology, researchers have investigated the expression profiles of ACE2 in two male and six female patients with COVID-19 from single cell resolution, and they found that the expression of ACE2 was correlated with gender. The proportion of ACE2 expressed cells is higher in males than in females (1.66% vs. 0.41%) [5] . Besides, the distribution of ACE2 was also wider in males than that in females. Zhao et al. [5] reported that there were at least five different types of cells in the lungs of males with the expression of the ACE2 receptors, while the number was about 2 \u223c 4 in female patients. This may be one of the deep reasons that why male patients were higher than the female ones. Thirdly, one may doubt that the distribution difference may be caused by population structure. To verify whether the male to female ratio (MFR) affects the finding, based on the statistical yearbook report of Henan province in the year 2019, the MFR in the whole province was 1.0126 : 1, which has great difference with the male to female patients ratio (MFPR) (637 : 521 = 1.2226 : 1). Moreover, we perform correlation analysis for the two ratios in the 18 regions, the two ratios show very weak correlation, with Pearson correlation coefficient r = 0.1555 ( Fig.2 C) . Kolmogorov-Smirnov (KS) test [31] on the MFR and MFPR in the 18 regions also shows that the two have significant difference (KS = 0.6111, p = 0.0018 < 0.05). Thus, we speculate that the MFR has no apparent effect on the MFPR. In conclusion, the former two reasons may be the driven force that there was gender difference in confirmed patients.",

Since the number of pathogens entering the body, virulence and reproductive capacity, as well as power of resistance are different for different people, thus, it is reported that the incubation periods obtained from patients for a certain disease should follow logarithm normal distribution [16, 33] .

For the first stage that before January 13, both exposed and confirmed patients were not so much, the number of exposed (outdegree) ones were more than the confirmed ones (indegree). While for the second stage that between January 13 and January 23, the COVID-19 was in outbreak period, both exposed and confirmed ones were considerable, and the number of exposed ones are far more than the confirmed ones. During this period, many college students and migrant workers in Wuhan return their hometown, the large number of people flow from Wuhan increased the risks of exposure and infection. After January 23, the epidemic entered the third stage, the number of daily confirmed cases were apparently higher than exposed ones, and the confirmed cases roughly decreased with time. This may be attributed to the adoption of prevention and control measures. With the closing of the Wuhan city at January 23, many regions of Henan quickly adopt very strict measures to prevent the spreading of COVID-19. Thus, after January 23, the number of exposed ones became fewer and fewer (Fig.3 D) , which is a good phenomena, indicating that the prevention and control measures become to gradually at work.",

The network contains 1105 patients that have been treated in 248 hospitals, 123 interhospital transfer relationships that involved 206 patients, and 208 patients that were clustering infected. Nodes in the network include patients and hospitals. Edges among patients represent relationship between relatives, friends or colleagues; Edges between patients and hospitals denote the patients were treated in the related hospitals; while edges among hospitals indicate the inter-hospital transfer treatments. Sizes of nodes were proportional to nodes' degree. Thickness of edges was proportional to the numbers of patients. From Fig.5 , we see that a few hospitals encompass a large number of patients in treatments, and the aggregate outbreak phenomena were ubiquitous. For example, the five patients that are treated in Zhengzhou Jinshui General Hospital are relatives to each other, they were successively infected. Similarly, 12 patients in Kaifeng are also relatives to each other. In fact, totally 208 patients were clustering infected, and Zhengzhou, Shangqiu, Zhoukou, Xuchang and Luoyang encompassed the most aggregative outbreak patients. Among the designated hospitals in Henan province, people's hospitals in different cities encompass a great number of patients. Xinyang Fifth People's Hospital received the most patients in Henan, followed by the Zhengzhou Sixth People's Hospital and the Luoshan County People's Hospital.

Among the 18 regions of Henan, Xinyang is with the heaviest epidemic, and it is currently also with the highest daily increment. We found that 55% patients in Henan were male, which is apparently higher than the females. We found that the gender difference of patients in Henan is 1.2226 : 1, while from Yang et al. [4] , they reported that the gender difference for 4021 patients from over 30 provinces is 0.31 : 0.27 = 1.1481 : 1. Our result is close to the existing ones. We reported that the MFRs of the whole province and its 18 regions are not the main factor that results to the gender difference in patients. Two possible main factors that result to such gender difference of patients include 1) the expression and distribution of ACE2s were wider in male patients than those in females, and 2) males are more active and with wider social activities than females in many regions of Henan. The ages of patients generally follow normal distribution, and with more than 81% patients are aged between 21 and 60 years old. N a n y a n g C e n tr a l H o s p . Incubation period is very important but very difficult to be estimated, since it is difficult to know when the patients were infected. We define the period from firstly contacting with suspicious persons or recently return from Wuhan to firstly appearing clinical symptoms (fever, cough etc) as incubation period, and we estimate its distribution. Statistical analysis on 483 patients reveals that the average estimated incubation period was 7.4 days, the mode was 4 days. About 55% patients were with incubation periods lower than 7 days, while more than 92% patients were lower than 14 days. About 7.45% patients were overestimated with more than 14 days incubation periods. Based on ME, OLS and MLE approaches, we modeled the incubation period as logarithmic normal distributions, and we found the ME method can well mimic the long right tails of the PDF for the incubation periods. Based on the ME approach, interquartile range of theoretically estimated incubation period is between 4.1 and 9.4 days. It is noted that, due to .
