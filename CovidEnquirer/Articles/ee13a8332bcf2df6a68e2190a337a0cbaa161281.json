            "text": "BACKGROUND: The damaging effects of exposure to environmental toxicants differentially affect genetically distinct individuals, but the mechanisms contributing to these differences are poorly understood. Genetic variation affects the establishment of the gene regulatory landscape and thus gene expression, and we hypothesized that this contributes to the observed heterogeneity in individual responses to exogenous cellular insults. OBJECTIVES: We performed an in vivo study of how genetic variation and chromatin organization may dictate susceptibility to DNA damage, and influence the cellular response to such damage, caused by an environmental toxicant. MATERIALS AND METHODS: We measured DNA damage, messenger RNA (mRNA) and microRNA (miRNA) expression, and genome-wide chromatin accessibility in lung tissue from two genetically divergent inbred mouse strains, C57BL/6J and CAST/EiJ, both in unexposed mice and in mice exposed to a model DNA-damaging chemical, 1,3-butadiene. RESULTS: Our results showed that unexposed CAST/EiJ and C57BL/6J mice have very different chromatin organization and transcription profiles in the lung. Importantly, in unexposed CAST/EiJ mice, which acquired relatively less 1,3-butadiene-induced DNA damage, we observed increased transcription and a more accessible chromatin landscape around genes involved in detoxification pathways. Upon chemical exposure, chromatin was significantly remodeled in the lung of C57BL/6J mice, a strain that acquired higher levels of 1,3-butadiene-induced DNA damage, around the same genes, ultimately resembling the molecular profile of CAST/EiJ. CONCLUSIONS: These results suggest that strain-specific changes in chromatin and transcription in response to chemical exposure lead to a \"compensation\" for underlying genetic-driven interindividual differences in the baseline chromatin and transcriptional state. This work represents an example of how chemical and environmental exposures can be evaluated to better understand gene-by-environment interactions, and it demonstrates the important role of chromatin response in transcriptomic changes and, potentially, in deleterious effects of exposure. https://doi.",

The molecular consequences of chemical exposure can therefore also vary across individuals and populations and may be attributable to variation in the expression of key metabolic genes, in the immune response, and in the DNA damage response pathway. Emerging evidence also suggests that chemical-induced effects may be transmitted transgenerationally through epigenetic means (Nadeau 2009 ). Yet, the underlying mechanisms for how genetics, metabolism, gene expression, and gene regulation combinatorially dictate the response to chemical exposure both within and across individuals is poorly understood.",

These studies showed that 1,3-butadiene induced tumors in multiple organs in this strain at exposure concentrations ranging from 6:25 to 1,250 ppm and durations of exposure from 13 to 60 wk. Similar systematic carcinogenicity studies have not been performed in other mouse strains.",

Interestingly, these 1,3-butadiene-induced effects were found to vary across genetically divergent inbred mouse strains (Koturbash et al. 2011a) . In particular, C57BL/6J (a Mus musculus domesticus subspecies and a classic laboratory strain) exhibited high levels of DNA adduct formation and changes in bulk histone modifications, whereas CAST/EiJ (a M. musculus castaneus subspecies and a wild-derived strain) exhibited relatively low levels of DNA adduct formation and bulk histone modifications.

After 2 wk of acclimation, the mice (9-13 wk of age) were randomly allocated to a control group exposed to clean air or to an experimental group exposed to 1,3-butadiene for 6 h a day, Monday-Friday, across a 2-wk period (and returned to their respective cages following each exposure). Immediately following the final exposure, mice were euthanized by exsanguination following deep nembutal (100 mg=kg intraperitoneal injection) anesthesia, and lungs were excised and snap-frozen immediately in liquid nitrogen and stored at \u221280 C for subsequent analyses.

Over the duration of the experiment, the average concentration of 1,3butadiene in the exposure chamber was 593 \u00b1 61 ppm (see Figure S1 ).

Certain types of genomic regions are known to induce artefactual signal caused by experimental or technical biases; thus, it has been suggested that these regions be masked or ignored (Carroll et al. 2014) . Mouse blacklists were therefore created in a fashion consistent with ENCyclopedia Of DNA Elements (ENCODE) (ENCODE Project Consortium 2012) for the human genome, including problematic satellite repetitive elements (CENSAT, GSAT, MurSAT, and SYNREP, as defined by RepeatMasker), regions with sequence homology to mitochondrial DNA (NumtS), rRNA, and regions on the X chomosome (chrX) with strong sequence homology to the Y chromosome (chrY). A CAST/EiJ pseudogenome blacklist file was generated in the same way after generating RepeatMasker annotations and using BLAT to get the sequence homology pieces (NumtS, chrX/Y). Postalignment quantification of reads per kilobase million (RPKM) values was conducted using an in-house script with RefSeq gene annotations.",

The number of permutations was set to 2,000. Pathways with fewer than 15 genes or more than 500 genes were not included. For RNA-seq data, genes were ranked according to the significance of differential expression between groups. For ATAC-seq data, genomic regulatory regions were associated with genes using GREAT v. 3.0.0 (McLean et al. 2010), which were then ranked according to the significance of differential chromatin accessibility. These ranked gene lists and their associated weights {[\u00f01-FDR\u00de \u00d7 log FC=abs\u00f0log FC\u00de, where FDR represents the FDR value for each gene, FC represents the fold change, and log is the natural log} were used as input to GSAASeqSP. To visualize significantly enriched reactome pathways (FDR < 10%) for the RNA-seq data, \"makeDendrogram. py\" (pyEnrichment: https://github.com/ofedrigo/pyEnrichment) and custom in-house R scripts were used to construct bubble plots using multidimensional scaling to calculate an optimal twodimensional (2D) arrangement of pathways based on a distance matrix of between-pathway semantic scores. For each pathway, significance is represented by color, and occupancy (number of genes in the pathway) is represented by the size of the bubble. For all other enrichment analyses, significantly enriched pathways were determined using the runGSAhyper function of the R package Piano v. 1.10.2 (V\u00e4remo et al. 2013 ) along with the Reactome Pathway Database.",

We displayed the significantly altered pathways as a bubble plot, using a combination of distance measures and multidimensional scaling ( Figure 1A , see \"Methods\").

For DARs with greater accessibility in C57BL/6J, we found significant enrichment of motifs for Ets family, Sox family, and Sp1 (Specificity protein 1), with significantly higher expression of Ets1, several Sox genes, and Sp1 in C57BL/6J (see Excel Table S2 ). The ubiquitously expressed Sp1 has previously been linked to response to genotoxic chemicals (Boehme et al. 2011; Hsu et al. 2013; Magkoufopoulou et al. 2012) and is involved in the regulation of genes involved in many cellular processes, including cell proliferation, differentiation, and apoptosis, acting as both an activator and a repressor (Li and Davie 2010) , perhaps through recruitment of acetyltransferases and deacetylases.",

Together, these findings show that the transcriptional response of CAST/EiJ mice to 1,3-butadiene exposure is intertwined with detoxification of the chemical, as indicated by the substantial shift from phase I bioactivation to phase II detoxification pathways. The lack of chromatin and miRNA changes indicates that baseline gene regulatory programs in the CAST/EiJ strain are poised to mount a robust response to efficiently detoxify chemicals such as 1,3butadiene.",

Upregulated genes were significantly enriched in 266 pathways including DNA synthesis and replication, DNA damage response, and phase II detoxification pathways, including glutathione conjugation ( Figure 3A ; Excel Table S8 ). Down-regulated genes were enriched in 46 pathways, many related to immune signaling (e.g., interferon signaling, T-cell receptor signaling, and cytokine signaling in the immune system). miRNA expression was also significantly altered in C57BL/6J mice following 1,3-butadiene exposure, with 109 miRNAs differentially expressed between control and exposed groups (FDR < 10%; see also Excel Table  S4 ). Using miRhub, we identified miR-326-3p, up-regulated in response to exposure, as a significant regulatory hub ( Figure 3B ; FDR < 10%). miR-326-3p is an important regulator of cell proliferation and migration in lung cancer (Wang et al. 2016) ; it also promotes differentiation of interleukin 17-producing T helper cells (Du et al. 2009 ).

For each pathway, significance is represented by shading of the bubble, and the number of genes in each pathway is represented by bubble size. For clarity, groups of related pathways are labeled with a general descriptive term as opposed to individual pathway names (see Excel Table S7 for complete list). Neither microRNAs (miRNAs) nor differentially accessible regions (DARs) were differentially expressed in 1,3butadiene versus control CAST/EiJ mice at an FDR of < 10% (data not shown). regulated upon exposure, as a regulatory hub ( Figure 3B ; FDR < 10%). Notably, predicted mRNA targets of miR-150-5p whose expression was increased by 1,3-butadiene include the glucuronosyltransferases Ugt1a1, Ugt1a2, and Ugt1a5, which are involved in glucuronidation, a major detoxification reaction in phase II metabolism. Chromatin accessibility also changed dramatically, with 2,634 DARs identified between control and exposed C57BL/6J mice (FDR < 10%; see also Excel Table S5 ). Of these, 1,533 DARs exhibited greater accessibility in control mice and were significantly enriched for immune and signaling-related pathways ( Figure 3C ), as shown at the Traf3 locus, which regulates pathways involved in activation of the immune response ( Figure 3D ) (H\u00e4cker et al. 2011) . In contrast, 1,101 DARs exhibited greater accessibility in exposed mice and were enriched for both phase I bioactivation and phase II detoxification pathways ( Figure 3C ), such as within the glutathione S-transferase Gstp2 locus, a key enzyme in glutathione conjugation ( Figure 3D ) (Board and Menon 2013) . Both sets of DARs were analyzed for transcription factor motif enrichment in regions proximal and distal to gene transcription start sites (see Figure S6 ). For DARs with increased accessibility following exposure, we observed significant enrichment of motifs for Mafk/Bach1, Dlx3 and Dbp. In contrast, in DARs with decreased accessibility following exposure, we detected enrichment of motifs for Egr4 and Sp1. In addition, Sp1 showed significantly decreased expression upon exposure (FDR = 0:06; see also Excel Table S2 ). This result suggests that Sp1 not only contributes to baseline differences in chromatin organization between strains (see Figure S3 ) but may also play a key role in the strain-specific chromatin remodeling response to exposure in C57BL/6J mice.",

We identified 2,188 proximal and 149 distal DARs that were significantly more accessible in C57BL/ 6J than in CAST/EiJ and that also contained an Sp1 motif. These C57BL/6J-enriched DARs, on average, showed decreased accessibility in C57BL/6J lung upon 1,3-butadiene exposure in proximal regions ( Figure 4A ), and to a lesser extent in distal regions (see Figure S7 ), whereas there was no change in the same regions in the lung of CAST/EiJ mice upon exposure.

For 719 genes linked to one of the 2,188 proximal DARs, we found that on average, these genes showed significantly increased expression in C57BL/6J relative to CAST/EiJ in control mice, and they showed decreased expression in C57BL/6J and no change in CAST/EiJ upon 1,3-butadiene exposure ( Figure 4B ). These 719 genes are enriched in immune response pathways, such as interferon signaling, as demonstrated by the interferon regulatory factor 7 (Irf7) locus ( Figure  4C ; see also Excel Table S9 ). Similarly, the 67 genes linked to one of the 149 distal DARs were expressed more highly in C57BL/6J at baseline and decreased in expression on exposure in only C57BL/6J mice (see Figure S6 ). Together, these findings suggest that Sp1 plays an important role in establishing the proinflammatory immune system state seen in clean air-exposed C57BL/6J (but not CAST/EiJ) that may contribute to increased DNA damage; they also suggest that the removal of Sp1 by exposure to 1,3-butadiene is associated with a decrease in these immune-related pathways.",

To investigate this more broadly, we analyzed expression patterns across all genes and found that the majority of genes for which expression was affected by 1,3-butadiene exposure in C57BL/6J mice were directionally altered to more closely resemble expression levels in CAST/EiJ mice ( Figure 5A ; see also Excel Table S2 ). Nearly all of these genes could be divided into four groups. The first group contained 1,757 genes that were down-regulated in C57BL/6J upon exposure, thereby approximating the expression profile of CAST/EiJ ( Figure 5A , Group 1), and was enriched for genes in the immune and hemostasis-related pathways (see Excel  Table S10 ). The second group, containing 1,534 genes upregulated in exposed C57BL/6J mice to better resemble CAST/ EiJ, was enriched for genes in the phase II detoxification and DNA damage response pathways ( Figure 5A , Group 2; see also Excel Table S10 ). These pathway enrichments were not surprising given our previous analysis of the C57BL/6J response to exposure ( Figure 3A ). In addition, we observed sets of 376 (Group 3) and 345 (Group 4) differentially expressed genes in exposed C57BL/6J mice in which expression in C57BL/6J diverged in direction compared with expression in CAST/EiJ. These genes were also enriched for pathways related to detoxification of 1,3butadiene but included Phase I bioactivation pathways, which were absent in Group 2 ( Figure 5A ).",

Similar to complex diseases, the burden at the individual level can vary widely, and it has been difficult to determine the source of this variability. At a molecular level, genetic background plays a critical role in dictating an individual's response to the environment and his or her susceptibility to disease. Yet, how this genetic variation intersects with the gene regulatory landscape to modify an individual's ability to effectively metabolize environmental toxicants, as well as their ability to repair DNA damage resulting from toxicant exposure, remains an unexplored question. Our study represents a novel investigation into the genome-wide impact of both genetic background and exposure to the environmental toxicant 1,3-butadiene on the transcriptional and gene regulatory landscape in the mouse lung. Although 1,3-butadiene is a well-studied, classic model toxicant, little is known about the complexity of individual variation in response to exposure or to genotoxic carcinogens in general. Our study represents a significant step forward in our understanding of this complexity at a genome-wide scale. Importantly, this work represents a new paradigm for investigating the effects of chemical or environmental exposures on the transcriptional and regulatory landscapes in genetically diverse individuals.",

In particular, we found that the baseline activities of cytochrome P450 and glutathione-S-transferase genes, key players in the bioactivation and detoxification of 1,3-butadiene, respectively, are increased in CAST/EiJ relative to C57BL/6J. The increased baseline activity of detoxification pathways, as well as those related to energy metabolism and the DNA damage response, may better position CAST/EiJ mice to more effectively metabolize 1,3-butadiene upon exposure and quickly repair chemically induced DNA damage, resulting in a reduced number of DNA adducts in this strain. Relatedly, a higher level of expression of inflammatory response genes in C57BL/6J lung than in CAST/EiJ lung in clean air-exposed mice could be related to DNA damage levels because increases in inflammation from exogenous agents have been shown to increase DNA damage (Kiraly et al. 2015) .",

(A) Heat map of meancentered normalized expression for genes that were differentially expressed in C57BL/6J mice following 1,3-butadiene (BD) exposure across all strains and conditions. Genes are divided into four groups based on their overall pattern of expression (see Excel Table S2 for genes in each group).

FDR, false discovery rate. reduced viral load, demonstrate less weight loss, and display fewer differentially expressed genes upon infection compared with CAST/EiJ mice (H Xiong et al. 2014) . Further, a separate study of SARS-CoV infection in multiple mouse strains found that the CAST/EiJ strain was extremely susceptible to infection (Gralinski et al. 2015) . Therefore, whereas the CAST/EiJ strain may be at an advantage in its ability to respond to environmental toxicant exposure, the C57BL/6J strain may be better poised to fight infection. Future studies in a greater diversity of mice may also clarify whether activity levels in detoxification and immune-related response are generally anticorrelated.",

The down-regulation of immune-related pathways was particularly interesting because immunosuppression has been related to carcinogenesis (Pardoll 2015) and has been reported in humans and animals exposed to cigarette smoke (Mehta et al. 2008) , pesticides (Banerjee et al. 1996) , and mycotoxins (Capriotti et al. 2012) , all of which have genotoxic potential.

Specifically, our results revealed that Sp1 is more highly expressed and that regions containing Sp1 motifs, which are significantly enriched for immune response pathways, are more accessible in C57BL/6J than in CAST/EiJ at baseline. Following exposure, Sp1 expression decreases, and regions containing Sp1 motifs are remodeled to become less accessible in C57BL/6J, thereby more closely resembling the molecular state in CAST/EiJ. Exposure to cadmium, a toxic heavy metal, has also been shown to down-regulate Sp1 in rat lung epithelial cells (Watkin et al. 2003) and in primary mouse kidney cells (Tabatabai et al. 2005) . Other genotoxic chemicals have also been reported to affect expression of Sp1 in HepG2 liver cells (Boehme et al. 2011; Magkoufopoulou et al. 2012) .

This was particularly evident in the significant up-regulation of both detoxification pathways and pathways related to energy metabolism and the DNA damage response in CAST/EiJ relative to C57BL/6J at baseline. Interestingly, upon exposure, C57BL/6J gene expression and regulation profiles were directionally altered to more closely resemble the molecular state of CAST/EiJ.

Including a larger panel of genetically diverse inbred mouse strains will provide a better understanding of the mechanisms of how genetic variation dictates the response to and consequences of toxicant exposure. Assessing the level of DNA damage at a range of time points will help us better understand how quickly these molecular changes occur, if and when adaptation in the transcriptomic or chromatin response occurs after prolonged exposure, and how that adaptation (or the lack thereof) may affect the amount of damage incurred. Importantly, determining the persistence of these changes after an initial exposure will reveal whether there exists an epigenetic memory that may reduce the effects of future exposures.",
