            "text": "Background: A highly pathogenic human coronavirus causing respiratory disease emerged in the Middle East region in 2012. In-house molecular diagnostic methods for this virus termed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) allowed sensitive MERS-CoV RNA detection in patient samples. Fast diagnosis is important to manage human cases and trace possible contacts. Objectives: The aim of this study was to improve the availability of existing nucleic acid amplificationbased diagnostic methods for MERS-CoV infections by providing a real-time RT-PCR kit, including an internal control and two target regions recommended by the World Health Organization (WHO). And to validate this kit (RealStar \u00ae MERS-CoV RT-PCR kit 1.0, Altona Diagnostics GmbH, Hamburg, Germany) using clinical samples of one MERS-CoV case from Munich and respiratory samples of patients with other respiratory diseases. Study design: An internal amplification control was included into the RT-PCR assays targeting the genomic region upstream of the Envelope gene (upE) and within open reading frame (ORF) 1A. Based on these assays, a ready-to-use real-time RT-PCR kit featuring both the upE and ORF1A assays was developed, validated and compared to the established in-house versions. Results: The performance of both RT-PCR assays included in the kit is comparable to the in-house assays. They show high analytical sensitivity (upE: 5.3 copies/reaction; ORF1A: 9.3 copies/reaction), no crossreactivity with other respiratory pathogens and detected MERS-CoV RNA in patient samples in almost the same manner as the in-house versions. Conclusion: The kit is a valuable tool for assisting in the rapid diagnosis, patient management and epidemiology of suspected MERS-CoV cases.",

            "text": "The Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first detected in a single patient with severe respiratory tract infection in Saudi Arabia in 2012. Evidence of spreading was provided by virus detection in a second patient from Qatar treated for similar symptoms in the United Kingdom [1, 2] . Since then an increasing number of cases, including more than 80 fatal cases have been notified to the World Health Organization (WHO) [3] . All human cases were linked to the Middle East region but imported cases were also detected in Europe and Africa [4, 5] . Virus detection in the majority of cases was done using specific real-time reverse-transcription PCR (rRT-PCR) assays in samples from the lower respiratory tract. Samples from the upper respiratory tract have been used for the investigation of mild cases and contacts, despite lower virus concentrations in these materials [6] [7] [8] [9] . Two rRT-PCR assays previously published by our group [10, 11] are recommended by the WHO for MERS-CoV molecular diagnostics [12] . These assays target genomic regions upstream of the Envelope gene (upE) and in the viral open reading frame 1A (ORF1A). Both assays proved to be highly sensitive and were successfully used for the identification of the majority of the diagnosed MERS cases. Based , the x-axis shows input RNA copies per reaction. Rhombs are experimental data points; solid lines represent the corresponding probit curve, the dashed lines the 95% confidence intervals. on the upE and ORF1A assays, real-time RT-PCR assays using the same oligonucleotides were developed into ready-to-use reagent formulations available as a test kit.",

The availability of a homogenous assay format which can be provided as a test kit provides an important benefit to general diagnostic laboratories which have to deal with requests to investigate cases of suspected MERS-CoV infection. Handling of the test kit is more straightforward as it requires mixing of only two instead of seven or eight different reagents, which reduces the risk of human errors during preparation [13] .",

Conversely, the availability of two different detection targets included in the kit is of great utility in positive cases, whereby a first step into confirmatory testing is achieved through results from the second target gene [12] . As long as MERS-CoV infection is a rare clinical entity [14] [15] [16] , however, diagnostic confirmation should never rely on results from one test alone, and the possibility of general errors on laboratory level should be considered [12, 17] . For the time being, clinical samples from cases with positive initial results should be forwarded to reference laboratories in order to achieve confirmation and to provide reference materials for a severe but rare infection.",

Among the 24 new sequences for the upE target region, two sequences showed single nucleotide mismatches, including one at the second position of the upE forward-primer in the Wadi-Ad-Dawasir 1 2013 sequence (GenBank no. KJ156881) and another at the second position of the upE-Probe in the Riyadh 13b 2013 sequence (GenBank no. KJ156873).

Five l of RNA and nuclease free-water were added up to a final reaction volume of 25 l. Thermal cycling was performed at 55 \u2022 C for 20 min for reverse transcription, followed by 95 \u2022 C for 3 min and 45 cycles of 95 \u2022 C for 15 s, 58 \u2022 C for 30 s. Reaction conditions were the same for the upE RT-PCR but using the following primer and probe sequences: upE-Fwd (GCAACGCGCGATTCAGTT), upE-Rev (GCCTCTACACGGGACCCATA), upE-P (FAM-CTCTTCACATAATCGCCCCGAGCTCG-TAMRA). The test kit versions of the upE and ORF1A rRT-PCR assays are based on the same oligonucleotides and are both included in the RealStar \u00ae MERS-CoV RT-PCR kit 1.0 (altona Diagnostics GmbH, Hamburg, Germany). They have a final reaction volume of 25 l with 10 l of sample RNA input. During the RNA-extraction, the target for the internal amplification control (IC) is added to check for PCR inhibition or loss of RNA during the extraction procedure.Alternatively the IC could also be used as a RT-PCR inhibition control only, by adding the IC into the PCR reaction. The IC is an in vitro transcribed RNA with an artificial sequence, targeted by additional primers and an additional probe included in the PCR mix. Two different realtime PCR instruments were used, the LC480II (Roche, Mannheim, Germany) and the Rotor-Gene Q (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany). RNAextraction was performed using the Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN). If not specified, 140 l of sample were used and the RNA was eluted in 60 l of AVE buffer (QIAGEN).",
