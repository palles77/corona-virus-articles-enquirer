While IL-33 canonically triggers type 2 cytokine responses, this cytokine can also synergize with type 1 cytokines like IL-12 to provoke interferon-gamma (IFN-\uf067). We show that picogram concentrations of IL-12 and IL-33 are sufficient to promote robust secretion of IFN-\uf067 by human NK cells that greatly exceeds responses to either cytokine alone. Nanogram doses of IL-33, potentially consistent with levels in tissue microenvironments, synergize with IL-12 to induce secretion of additional cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor (TNF) and granulocyte-macrophage colonystimulating factor (GM-CSF). IL-33-induced activation of the p38 MAPK pathway in human NK cells is crucial for enhanced release of IFN-\uf067 and TNF in response to IL-12. Mechanistically, IL-33induced p38 MAPK signaling enhances stability of IFNG transcripts and triggers ADAM17mediated cleavage of TNF from the cell surface. These data support our hypothesis and suggest that altered sensitivity of NK cells to IL-12 in the presence of IL-33 may have important consequences in diseases associated with mixed cytokine milieus, like asthma and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.",

Other type 1 cytokines, including IL-15, IL-18 and IL-1\uf062 enhance IL-12-induced IFN-\uf067 release by NK cells [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] . This type 1 cytokine synergy can also promote enhanced release of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF) and granulocyte macrophage colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). Thus, type 1 cytokine rich environments associated with immune insults such as infection or injury can stimulate cytokine responses from NK cells that further promote type 1 responses.

Yet the prototypical typical type 2 cytokine IL-4, alone or in combination with IL-12, triggered high levels of IFN-\uf067 expression by mouse NK cells 14, 15 . Another type 2 cytokine, IL-33, can enhance IL-12-induced production of IFN-\uf067 by both NK and NKT cells [16] [17] [18] .

Isolated NK cells secreted IFN-\uf067 in response to doses of IL-12 as low as 250 pg/mL ( Fig. 2A) . In contrast, production of IFN-\uf067 by these cells was barely detectable after stimulation with IL-33 alone, even at doses as high as \u22651 ng/mL ( Fig. 2A) . However, 100 pg/mL or more of IL-33 enhanced (1.7-to 2.9fold) IL-12-elicited IFN-\uf067 protein expression ( Fig. 2A) , with synergistic interactions between IL-12 and IL-33 contributing significantly (p<0.0001, two-way ANOVA) to the overall variation in IFN-\uf067 expression. High concentrations of IL-33 (10 ng/mL) additionally provoked expression of TNF and GM-CSF when administered in combination with IL-12 (Fig. 2B) . The bulk of variation in the expression of TNF (p=0.011, two-way ANOVA) and GM-CSF (p=0.0008, two-way ANOVA) were attributable to synergistic interactions between IL-33 and IL-12 (Fig. 2B) .",

To determine whether IL-33 exerts a similar effect on IFNG transcript stability, human NK cells were incubated with IL-12 alone or in combination with IL-33 for 6 hours in conjunction with pretreatment with R-1503 or vehicle control. Four hours after cytokine administration, cultures were treated with actinomycin D (5 \uf06dg/mL) to halt de novo transcription, thereby permitting measurement of decay of existing IFNG transcripts. As shown in Fig. 7 , IFNG levels dropped in all experimental groups after addition of actinomycin D. Treatment of NK cells with IL-33 and IL-12 (Fig. 7 , dark purple) resulted in a significantly greater half-life of IFNG transcripts (116\u00b13 minutes for IL-33/IL-12 versus 75\u00b13 minutes for IL-12, p<0.0001) compared to NK cells stimulated with IL-12 alone (Fig. 7 , solid black lines, dark gray bar). The addition of R-1503 accelerated the decay of INFG transcripts ( Fig. 7 left plot, dashed lines) , and largely abrogated the enhancing effects of IL-33 (Fig.  7 , right plot, light purple bar) relative to IL-12 alone (Fig. 7 , right plot, light grey bar) in terms of half-life of IFNG transcripts (62\u00b12 minutes for IL-33/IL-12 versus 52\u00b12 minutes for IL-12, p=0.045).

In addition to IL-33 induced increases in TNF mRNA expression (Fig. 1B) , we hypothesize that IL-33 further enhances TNF secretion by NK cells (Fig. 2B) via elevated ADAM-17 cleavage of cell-surface TNF. Addition of the ADAM17 inhibitor (TAPI-1) 27 to NK-cell cultures resulted in reduction of secreted TNF from 97.1\u00b110.4 to 45.8\u00b15.2 pg/ml (ELISA) in response to IL-33 and IL-12 stimulation (Fig. 9A) . In contrast, R-1503 more completely ablated the enhancing effect of IL-33 on IL-12-induced TNF secretion. Thus, enhanced TNF secretion in response to IL-12 and IL-33 is at least partially dependent on ADAM-17, which may function downstream of p38 MAPK or be dependent on p38 MAPK induced changes in TNF mRNA expression. While secreted TNF secretion increased in response to the combination of IL-33 and IL-12, cell-associated TNF was reduced 1.9-fold to levels near those induced by IL-12 alone (Fig. 9B) . These flow cytometry measurements were made in the absence of brefeldin-A or other secretion inhibitors, thus reflecting TNF naturally retained by the cells. Importantly, reduced TNF secretion by TAPI-I-treated, IL-12 and IL-33 stimulated cells (Fig. 9A) was associated with a 2.0-fold increase in cellassociated TNF to levels observed with IL-12 alone (Fig. 9B) . Thus, IL-33-stimulated ADAM17 activity contributes to TNF secretion at the expense of cell-associated TNF, likely via cleavage of TNF from the cell surface.",

In addition, superphysiological concentrations of IL-33 and IL-12 synergistically induced the release of TNF and GM-CSF, suggesting that high concentrations of these cytokines in a tissue microenvironment may have even stronger effects on NK-cell function. IL-33-mediated potentiation of IFN-\uf067 and TNF secretion depended on p38 MAPK, and to a lesser extent, the downstream kinase MK2. Moreover, enhanced TNF secretion was partially attributable to ADAM17. These results highlight the possibility for exaggerated cytokine secretion by human NK cells in physiological setting that are characterized by dual exposure to type 1 (IL-12) and type 2 (IL-33) cytokines.",

Our data suggest that a type 2 cytokine, IL-33, similarly enhances IL-12-induced IFN-\uf067 expression by human NK cells. Moreover, IL-33 amplification of IFN-\uf067 is dependent on p38 MAPK activity and associated with increased stability of IFNG mRNA. The p38 MAPK regulates inflammatory responses via phosphorylation of downstream mediators, including MK2 31, 32 . Yet, MK2 inhibitors had only a partial inhibitory effect in contrast to the abrogation of IL-12/IL-33 synergistic interactions following p38 MAPK inhibition. This finding implies that other p38 MAPK-stimulated mediators, including ATF2, may also be crucial for the enhancing effect of IL-33. In fact, IL-33 rapidly induced the phosphorylation of p38 MAPK and ATF2 in human NK cells. Of note, p38 MAPK-induced activation of ATF2 initiates activator protein 1 (AP-1) complex-mediated transcription of inflammatory cytokines, including IFN-\uf067 [33] [34] [35] . Coupled with the lack of apparent effects of IL-33 on IL-12-induced phosphorylation of STAT4, our results highlight the possibility that IL-33 enhances IFN-\uf067 via enhanced AP-1dependent promotion of transcription.",

Thus, we speculate that NK cells derived from the blood or tissues of patients exhibiting elevated levels of IL-33 would be more sensitive to ex vivo IL-12 stimulation. As an example, cigarette smoke induces epithelial damage resulting in increased expression of IL-33 17, 42 , which provokes hypersensitive IFN\u03b3 production by mouse NK cells in response to IL-12 44 . Our initial data suggest that NK cells from smokers exhibit greater sensitivity to IL-12 in terms of IFN-\uf067 expression than NK cells derived from healthy, non-smokers (D.O., M.B., and S.N.W unpublished observations). We speculate that elevated IL-33 levels in smokers or asthmatic patients provokes hypersensitivity to type 1 inflammatory cues triggered by virus infection. Thus, smokers exposed to virus infections likely produce high, potentially pathogenic expression of IFN-\uf067. Our findings provide new insights about potential functional hypersensitivity of NK cells in type 2 cytokine rich inflammatory milieus such as asthma and COPD as well as in smokers.",
