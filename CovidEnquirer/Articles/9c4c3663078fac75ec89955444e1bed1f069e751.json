Recently, it has been suggested that IAD should be included in the term \"Equine Asthma,\" regrouping both IAD and the more severe recurrent airway obstruction (RAO) as both are believed to represent a continuous spectrum of IADs in horses. There is a close parallelism between these forms of equine disease and human asthma. 1, 2 Environmental factors play a pivotal role in the development of respiratory diseases. Horses that are housed indoors are exposed to high levels of organic dust, which include bacteria and fungi. Materials such as hay and straw naturally contain a substantial indigenous microflora that can further proliferate when stored or when used as forage or bedding. 3 The constitutive elements of fungi such as spores, conidiae, and hyphae are particles small enough to be inhaled up to the alveolar level and can trigger an immune response. 4, 5 Fungi that penetrate the airways can be infective, toxic, allergenic, or all 3 combined. 6 Some mesophilic fungi can only grow at environmental Abbreviations: ABPA, allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis; ACVIM, American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine; BAL, bronchoalveolar lavage; BALF, bronchoalveolar lavage fluid; CI, confidence interval; CS, consensus statement; IAD, inflammatory airway disease; OR, odds ratio; RAO, recurrent airway obstruction; TW, tracheal wash.",

Other more thermotolerant fungi can grow at both environmental and body temperatures and thus act as both aeroallergens and opportunistic pathogens (Candida, Penicillium, and Aspergillus). When infective, they can further damage their host by producing toxins. Aspergillus species are the most prominent cause of fungal lung infections in humans. 7 Statements from different medical associations have unequivocally established that fungi act both in sensitizing and exacerbating allergic asthma in humans. 8 Fungal pathogenicity is of particular importance in patients with severe asthma caused by fungal sensitization and patients with allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). In one third of these patients, antifungal treatment enabled to downgrade the severity of their asthma. 9 However, Aspergillus and other fungi can also be sensitizers in other less severe forms of asthma, 8 and many recent studies further describe the mold-related respiratory effects in asthma. [10] [11] [12] Farmer's lung is a well-known disease of people working in an agricultural environment. It is linked to the inhalation of dust including mold spores. It has been shown that people working in horse stables were also at an increased risk of developing respiratory diseases, including asthma. [13] [14] [15] Molds have long been recognized to play a role in the pathogenesis of RAO in horses. [16] [17] [18] Certain species of thermophilic actinomycetes such as Aspergillus fumigatus have been incriminated in the pathogenesis of both RAO in horses and Farmer's lung in humans. The inhalation of a combination of molds and endotoxin exacerbates RAO signs, including loss of respiratory function in experimental models. 19 The involvement of fungi in the pathogenesis of IAD remains unclear.",

However, cough and nasal discharge were more prevalent in horses with IAD or with a positive TW mycology. Exercise intolerance was also significantly more prevalent in horses with a positive TW mycology. None of the horses showed the severe clinical signs typically described in the cases of fungal pneumonia (depression, deep cough, fever, anorexia, and weight loss). 44 Thus, it is not possible to rely solely on clinical signs to diagnose IAD and the presence of fungal particles in the airways. Respiratory sample analysis is further indicated, and a cytologic examination appears more sensitive than a mycology culture to detect the presence of fungi. 45, 46 The storage of hay and straw can also lead to an exponential increase in fungal proliferation within the batches. The degree of contamination and proliferation is directly related to harvesting practices, initial levels of soil contamination, as well as storage conditions. On the contrary, wood shavings decreased the risk of IAD and the detection of fungal particles in the airways. This bedding type seems to be an appropriate solution to maintain equine respiratory health. The use of high-temperature hay steaming also had a significantly protective effect against the development of IAD and the contamination of airways with fungal particles in our study. Hay steaming has been shown to significantly reduce bacterial as well as fungal contamination 47 and could be an effective means to improve the hygiene of forage. Interestingly, soaking the hay, which is often recommended as a protective measure for horses with respiratory inflammation, did not significantly decrease the risk of being IAD nor the risk of having fungal elements in the airways. Similarly, the use of haylage did not reduce the risk of IAD in our study. The absence of a significantly preventative effect of haylage could be attributable to its use in a limited number of horses and the large variation in the quality of haylage products used. Similarly, hay commercialized as \"dust-free\" hay was not a good alternative in our study as it did not reduce the risk of IAD nor the risk of finding fungal particles in the airways.",

Fungi present in the equine environment can be inhaled in the airways; they represent a significant risk factor for IAD and contribute to exercise intolerance. The identification of these fungal elements should be made on the basis of TW cytology slides as many of these cases were negative on mycology culture. The quality of the environment and management practices are determinant in reducing exposure to contaminants and maximizing the equine respiratory health. The role of fungi in the pathogenesis of IAD and equine asthma should be further investigated. ",

The presence or absence of tracheal mucus detected by endoscopy was not used to make the diagnosis of IAD in our study. However, regarding the cytology, the authors decided to use the more selective 2007 CS 27 cutoff values for BALF cytology as they apply better to the high-level sport and race horses included in our study. Indeed, performing horses of this level present BAL cytology lower than 2007 CS cutoff values (van Erck, unpublished data).",

The most commonly isolated fungi were Penicillium (53%), Aspergillus (34%), Rhizomucor (5%), and Candida (5%). Overall, fungal elements were found upon cytological examination of the TW in 79% (578/731) of all horses, in 81% (523/646) of IAD+ horses, and in 65% (55/85) of IAD\u2212 horses. This difference was statistically significant (P = .0006). Fungal elements were identified in both TW and BAL in 245 of 731 (33.5%) horses, only in the TW in 332 of 731 (45.4%) horses, and only in the BAL in 28 of 731 (3.8%) horses. For the statistical analysis, the presence of fungal elements in the TW was used, as this reflects more accurately the overall exposure of the equine airways to these particles. Comparing mycology culture to fungal detection on cytology, the agreement between both techniques was poor (Cohen's kappa coefficient \u03ba = 0.063; 55.9% agreement). Horses with fungal elements in their TW on cytology had 80% increased odds of having a positive TW mycology (OR = 1.8; 95% CI 1.2-2.5; P = .002). However, no correlation was found between a positive mycology and the detection of fungal growth on cytological examination. A positive TW bacterial culture increased by 2.1-fold the chances of finding a positive TW mycology culture (OR = 2.1; 95% CI 1.5-2.8; P < .0001).",

These findings support the role that aerosolized fungal elements play in the pathophysiology of IAD, as it is the case in RAO. Fungi can be allergenic, infective, toxic, or any combination of the above. The role of fungi in equine IAD needs to be further investigated. Although fungi might not necessarily be the primary cause of IAD, it is possible that deficits in immunity might modify the equine ability to react to infection. In humans, in addition to asthma or invasive fungal pneumonia, other more moderate fungal infections have been described, such as chronic pulmonary aspergillosis, aspergillus bronchitis, ABPA, and severe asthma with fungal sensitization. The results of our study suggest that thiscategory of intermediate pathological fungal conditions also exists in the airways of horses as well. The identification of proliferating fungi in the airways is a sign of fungal infection and warrants further investigation.General factors promoting fungal development in people include decreased immune function, treatment with corticosteroids and antibiotics.28 Decreased immune function has also been demonstrated in horses undergoing intense exercise29 and stress associated with transportation and competition.29 A link between fungal growth and an immunodepressive state could not be demonstrated in our study;",

            "text": "high frequency of fungal particles in the airways of horses raises the question of the safety of use of corticosteroids as a unique treatment of airway inflammation and the risks of promoting fungal growth by depressing the immune response in the airways. In human allergic diseases involving fungal component such as severe acute respiratory syndrome and ABPA, antifungal treatment is added to the treatment plan. 6 Furthermore, in these authors' experience, indiscriminate use of antimicrobials can occur in the sport horse population, potentially increasing the risk of respiratory fungal growth. In our study, no relationship could be established between a positive bacteriology of the TW and a diagnosis of IAD. This supports the noninfectious etiology of IAD and questions the empirical use of antibiotic treatments in the management of IAD or in cases of cough or nasal discharge. Horses with a positive bacterial culture of the TW had a greater risk of a positive mycology culture. This raises the question about a possible link between bacterial and fungal infections. In people, airway inflammation leading to decreased mucus clearance can lead to environmental bacteria getting trapped within the mucus and not being eliminated normally which promotes infection. 34 The same could be true for fungi. In people, fungi like Aspergillus are suspected to decrease the local immune response and mucus clearance via the secretion of mycotoxins like gliotoxin 35,36 and verruculogen. 37 These mycotoxins have shown to damage human epithelial cells and modify the electrophysiological properties of human or porcine epithelial cells in vitro. 37Fungal culture and cytological detection of fungi showed poor agreement. In a number of cases, fungal culture failed to detect fungal presence in the airways. Interestingly, fungal culture also failed to identify several cases that showed fungal growth on cytology.

In our study, this method would have led to numerous false-positive and false-negative cases suggesting that mucus endoscopic scoring is unreliable for diagnosing IAD.In our study, straw bedding and dry hay feeding represented significant risk factors for IAD and for the presence of fungal elements in equine airways.
