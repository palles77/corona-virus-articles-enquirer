ADE in vitro can be considered as a common experimental phenomenon with uncertain clinical relevance, as it has been demonstrated for many viruses (alphaviruses [10] , rabies [11] 15] , and others) without evidence of worsened disease during secondary infection in mice or in human populations [16] . Such a precise ADE definition is very specific in describing an experimental finding as a fact. In in vitro assays, immune sera from patients exposed to a variety of different flaviviruses, including yellow fever and Japanese encephalitis viruses, will also enhance DENV infection [17] . Even the homotypic serotype responsible for a past DENV infection can induce ADE of DENV, if the serum is diluted to subneutralizing concentrations [18] . However, in contrast to ADE described for other viruses, ADE of DENV in vivo is commonly associated with a worse clinical outcome [19] . Secondary DENV infections result in dramatic Trends Zika virus (ZIKV) caused atypical clinical manifestations in areas with previous exposure to other flaviruses.",

Because of this, ADE related to flaviviruses should not be seen only as a single biological process of virus-antibody interaction. Defining ADE in the context of pathogenesis, as we usually read the outcome of the biological process, should imply a clinical consequence, including clinical and laboratory evidence of impairment. In this way, ADE would be defined as a common experimental in vitro phenomenon but a rare in vivo occurrence leading to worsening of the clinical presentation usually associated with hemodynamic changes, increased viremia, proinflamatory cytokine profile, and other detectable laboratory alterations.",

For many years NHPs have been used as a surrogate for human infection in order to understand DENV pathogenesis and to test for vaccine immunogenicity and efficacy [23] and, more recently, for ZIKV replication and pathogenesis [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] . In the past, DENV ADE, in terms of viral replication enhancement, has also been proven in NHPs after secondary DENV infection with DENV 2 [29] or by passive administration of optimal dilutions of human DENV-immune serum to the animals [30] , or by using specific concentrations of a monoclonal antibody [31] . In addition to being useful for studying DENV pathogenesis, NHPs are a good model for predicting the behavior of different DENV vaccines in humans and for characterizing specific DENV neutralizing antibodies also occurring naturally in human populations [23] . Because of this, it is plausible to anticipate that data on ZIKV pathogenesis in NHPs can also reproduce or predict what will happen in humans. In a recent study, using a limited number of animals, Pantoja et al. were unable to show ADE of ZIKV in DENV immune macaques [32] . However, results showed that previous immunity to DENV was able to modulate the innate and cellular immune response to ZIKV with a tendency to lower the average ZIKV viremia days, to limit the increase in liver enzymes, and to induce a significant increase in the plasma perforin as evidence of an increased cytotoxic T cell activity [33] . This cellular immune response in NHPs is supported by recent results from human samples showing that prior DENV infection leads to stronger and faster responses to ZIKV in terms of both CD4 and CD8T cell responses, thus providing evidence of a biological outcome [34] .",

ADE during a secondary heterologous Dengue virus infection has been documented in vitro, in mice, in non-human primates, and in humans playing a key role in the worsening of the clinical presentations. In contrast, ADE of Zika virus by pre-existing immunity to Dengue virus can be induced in vitro, and in immunodeficient mice. However, there is no evidence to support ADE occurring in non-human primates or in humans. work, in a dose-dependent evaluation of mouse survival and the clinical presentation experiment, revealed that control plasma at the highest concentration could also decrease mice survival by about 40%, similar to the effect of DENV immune plasma at the lowest dilutions. In addition to proving that antibodies induced by prior DENV infection, administered under different concentrations, can amplify or neutralize ZIKV disease manifestations in vivo, Bardina et al. also showed the limited value of ADE in vivo in immunosuppressed mice. Indeed, ADE of ZIKV by previous flavivirus infection is not a novel concept. Back in 1987 Fabgami et al. demonstrated that ZIKV replication can be enhanced in P388D1 macrophage cell line by subneutralizing concentrations of antibodies in immune ascitic fluids from six other different flaviviruses, including Wesselsbron, Uganda S, WNV, Dakar bat, yellow fever and Potiskum virus",
