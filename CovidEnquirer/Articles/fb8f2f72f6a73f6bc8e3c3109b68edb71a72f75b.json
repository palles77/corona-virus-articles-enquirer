            "text": "Background: Various kinds of commercial molecular systems have been developed for fast and more accurate detection of respiratory viruses. Anyplex TM II RV16 [RV16] was designed for simultaneous detection of 16 respiratory viruses using multiplex PCR coupled with TOCE TM technology. Objectives: To compare the performance of RV16 with those of culture and Seeplex \u00ae RV15 ACE [RV15] by determining their sensitivity and specificity. Study design: Seven hundred and thirty respiratory samples were tested by modified shell vial culture method, RV16, and RV15. For molecular tests, automated nucleic acid extraction and liquid handling system using MICROLAB Nimbus IVD (Hamilton, USA) was adopted to maximize the workflow and accuracy. Performance of each assay was determined against a composite reference standard. Results: Two hundred and one samples (28%) out of 730 samples were positive by culture, while additional 281 (39%) were positive by RV16 or RV15. Sensitivities of RV16, RV15, and culture for virus tested were as follows: 100/93/63% for influenza A, 90/80/69% for influenza B, 98/94/63% for RSV, 98/52/23% for adenovirus, and 100/75/46% for PIV. For viruses not covered by culture, sensitivities of RV16 and RV15 were as follows: 99/81% for rhinovirus, 92/100% for coronavirus OC43, 100/56% for coronavirus 229E/NL63, 92/88% for metapneumovirus, 100/62% for bocavirus, and 91/91% for enterovirus. Overall, the specificities of culture, RV16, and RV15 (Seegene) were 100/99.9/99.9%. Conclusions: RV16 assay was superior to culture method and RV15 and will be a promising tool for patient management and public health epidemiology.",

            "text": "Respiratory viral infections are one of the leading causes of morbidity and mortality. The rapid and accurate identification of viral etiology is critical in ruling out non-viral infections, initiating timely therapeutic interventions and limiting the spread of infections. [1] [2] [3] Diagnoses of viral respiratory tract infections have been made generally by culture-based methods using cell culture and/or detection of antigens. Although these methods are effective and often complementary, they do have some disadvantages. 4 Cell culture, which has been considered the \"gold standard\", takes time, and detection of antigens often lacks sensitivity or specificity. 5 Even when these methods are applied simultaneously, some samples are still found negative despite clinical evidence of a viral respiratory infection. 4 Molecular techniques offer quicker turn-around times, greater analytical sensitivity, and allow identification of strains that are difficult to culture using standard methods in clinical laboratories. 6 Especially, multiplexed RT-PCR enabled laboratorians to detect a panel of viruses simultaneously while maintaining excellent sensitivity and specificity. 3, 7, 8 Several studies have demonstrated the advantages of multiplex PCR including Seeplex \u00ae RV15 ACE detection [RV15] (Seegene, Seoul, Korea), which achieved approval from CE (2009), Health Canada (2011), and KFDA (2013), being sold in more than 20 countries in Europe, Canada and Asia. 6, [9] [10] [11] [12] Recently, Anyplex TM II RV16 [RV16] with Tagging Oligonucleotide Cleavage and Extension (TOCE) technology (Seegene, Seoul, Korea) has been developed. TOCE assay is a novel approach to real-time PCR, using the two components, 'pitcher' and 'catcher'. 13 Through target bound pitcher, TOCE assay moves the detection point from the target sequence to the catcher, enabling predictable analysis of melting temperature for catcher duplex and offering multiplex real-time PCR capability to RV16. 13 ",

After reaction, Catcher Melting Temperature Analysis (CMTA) 15 was performed by cooling the reaction mixture to 55 \u2022 C, holding at 55 \u2022 C for 30 s, heating from 55 \u2022 C to 85 \u2022 C. The fluorescence was measured continuously during the temperature rise, while the melting peaks were derived from the initial fluorescence (F) versus temperature (T) curves.",

If the results between RV16 and RV15 were concordant, they were considered to be a true positive without sequencing. However, if the results between RV16 and RV15 were discrepant, singleplex PCR and sequencing with specific primers was performed as a confirmatory test. The main outcomes of this study were the sensitivity and specificity of culture and RV16 and RV15 assay. All analyses were performed using SPSS (version 20.0; SPSS, Chicago, IL, USA). (Table 1 ). In our study, RSV A and rhinoviruses were the viruses most commonly associated with multiple agent infection, followed by adenovirus, metapneumovirus, and coronavirus (Table 1 ). In our study, two (100%) of two quadruple viruses infected specimens were detected by RV16 assay only, while 9 (45%) of 20 triple viruses infected specimens were detected by RV16 alone. The results remained the same at repeated tests, singleplex PCR, and confirmatory sequencing analysis. Table 1 shows the overall distribution of respiratory viral pathogens, indicating the predominance of influenza viruses, RSV and HRV. It also shows that coronavirus, metapneumovirus and adenovirus accounted for about 13.1% (63/482), 10.4% (50/482) and 12.7% (61/482) respectively, followed by enterovirus and bocavirus at around 2.3% (11/482) and 4.4% (21/482).

            "text": "In this study, we evaluated the performance of the novel RV16 assay with those of RV15 assay and viral culture. RV16 and RV15 assays offered good sensitivities (79.5-100%) for the detection of common respiratory viral agents (influenza A or B, PIV 1-3, RSVA or B), while viral culture showed low sensitivities (45.8-69.2%). As for adenovirus, the RV16 assay showed superior sensitivity to RV15 (98.4% vs. 52.4), while viral culture demonstrated low sensitivity (23.0%). In our study, twenty-eight ADV-positive specimens were detected by RV16 alone. A confirmatory sequencing demonstrated that nineteen, six, two and one specimens were adenovirus C, B, F (41) and D type, respectively. In a previous study, through evaluating the four commercial multiplex PCR assays, the performance for adenovirus was not as good as the other viruses, assuming due to various serologic types of adenovirus. 12 In addition, the molecular assays detected viral pathogens from culture negative 282 (39%) samples. The overall detection rate in our study was similar to those in the previous reports. As for RV15, a Chinese study based on 164 nasopharyngeal swab presented the detection rate of 78.7% for all target respiratory viruses, 9 while a Canadian study based on 750 nasopharyngeal swabs showed the detection rate of 66.9%. 12 As for Seegene RV12, a Korean study performed on 101 respiratory specimen from 92 patients showed the detection rate of 75.2% for all target respiratory viruses, 3 while other Canadian study using 231 nasopharyngeal specimen demonstrated 69.8%. 6 Viral culture has limited ability to detect some viruses. 16 Rhinovirus is difficult to detect by viral culture due to its diversity of serotypes. In our study, only RV16 and RV15 detected 125 rhinoviruses (24%) from 529 culture negative samples. Although MPV causes a lower respiratory disease similar to that caused by RSV, 17 it is difficult to detect MPV by cell culture due to its selective, 6, [10] [11] [12] Given that the coronavirus and human bocavirus are recently discovered, and detected worldwide and sometimes associated with severe respiratory illness, RV16 will be helpful to take care of the patients who have previously had the undefined or fatal respiratory illness. 16, [18] [19] [20] The advantage of the PCR-based assay was detecting coinfections which are usually missed by viral culture. 6 In the literature, the detection rate of multiple infections by multiplex PCR assay ranged from 5% to 40%. 3, 6, 9, 12, 16 Whereas, similar to our study results, Gharabaghi et al. using multiplex PCR reported two, three and four viruses-infected specimens as 15.3, 0.8 and 0.2% of total respiratory specimens, respectively. Although the role of multiple viral agents in affecting the clinical course of disease is at present unknown, multiple agents may be clinically significant, especially in immune compromised individuals. 12 RV16 assay would provide clinicians with better infectious status of patients than RV15 or culture, resulting in the more effective prevention of such multiple infections.",
