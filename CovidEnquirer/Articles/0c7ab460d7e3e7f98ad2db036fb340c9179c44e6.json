Not only was there a reduction in the numbers of circulating mononuclear cells, but there was also a significant (P < 0.01 ) decrease in the in vitro responsiveness of the remaining circulating peripheral blood lymphocytes to the mitogens, phytohaemagglutinin (PHA), concanavalin A (ConA) and pokeweed mitogen (PWM). Responses to all three mitogens were suppressed to a similar degree. Analysis of the circulating mononuclear cell sub-populations before and during DM treatment demonstrated a selective depletion of B cells; the T lymphocyte sub-population that expresses the gamma/delta form oft cell receptor, are CD2-, CD5 \u00f7, CD8-, CD4-and constitute a major population in peripheral blood of calves.",

Expression of surface antigens after 72 h in vitro culture in the presence of DM were little affected with the exception of BoCD8 and MHC II, which showed increased and decreased expression, respectively. These observations would suggest that distinct mechanisms are involved in glucocorticosteroid suppression of the responses to these two mitogens.",

The result of GC treatment on the immune system varies considerably between species giving rise to designations of a species being either \"cortisone-resistant\" or \"cortisone-sensitive\" (Claman et al., 1971 ). However, not only is there interspecies variation but the effects of GC treatment are dependent on other parameters such as the age of the animal (Yang and Schultz, 1986 ) and the dose of GC used (Roth and Kaeberle, 1982 ) .",

Lymphocytes from Calf 1 behaved in a similar way to that seen in previous calves with suppression increasing with increasing concentration of DM. However, lymphocytes from the other two calves exhibited maximal suppression at a DM concentration of 5.1 \u00d7 10-8 M and as the DM concentration increased above this, a lower degree of suppression was obtained.

Treatment with DM reduced both the number and percentage of circulating BoWC 1 \u00f7 cells, whereas, although the numbers of BoCD2 + T cells were reduced, their proportion of the total population did not decline. When the BoCD2 + T cell population was subdivided into BoCD4 +, BoCD8-and BoCD4-, BoCD8 \u00f7 sub-populations, no differences were seen between these two cell types in their sensitivity to DM. face antigens was analysed to determine whether this suppression was associated with a phenotypic change in the cells present in culture. There was no marked alteration in the percentage of cells expressing the majority of cell surface antigens following culture with DM (Table 4) . How- ever, BoCD8 and MHC II expression were affected. In the presence of PHA, DM (10-6 M) increased the percentage of cells expressing BoCD8. In contrast, MHC II expression was reduced by DM. The latter finding was most marked with cells cultured in the absence of mitogen, while the increased MHC II expression induced by culture with either PHA or ConA showed a more modest decrease.

This finding would indicate that GC suppressed responses to PHA and ConA by different mechanisms or that PHA and ConA stimulate differently. Given in vivo, GC result in a redistribution of lymphocytes from the blood to other lymphoid organs (Cupps and Fauci, 1982) and this effect may have caused the depressed ConA and PWM responses seen following in vivo DM treatment. Redistribution of lymphocytes in vivo may have affected the PHA responses but the results obtained in vitro with DM suggested that DM also exerted a specific physiological effect on responses to PHA.",

On the other hand, IL-4 production by a mouse Th clone was not affected by DM (Bertoglio and Leroux, 1988 ) . Gillis et al. ( 1979 ) found that addition of uncharacterised exogenous T cell growth factor to GC-suppressed cultures of mouse lymphocytes completely restored responsiveness. Similarly, in this study, PHA responsiveness was restored by the addition of exogenous recombinant human IL-2. This finding implies that the suppression of PHA responses by DM is due, at least partially, to blocked induction of IL-2 expression. Additionally, the inhibition of IL-2 receptor expression (Reed et al., 1986) may account for the incomplete restoration of the proliferative response by exogenous IL-2.",

Another explanation for the difference in results seen with PHA and ConA is that there is a selective GC-mediated suppression of a molecule involved with the PHA responsiveness of lymphocytes. MHC II expression by the mitogen-presenting cell has been demonstrated by Torbett et al. ( 1986 ) to be essential for PHA (but not ConA) responses in the mouse. Of all the surface antigens examined in this study, only MHC II expression was reduced. However, the modest level of suppression seen with DM in mitogenstimulated cultures was not considered sufficient to explain the observed lack of responsiveness. The CD2 molecule on the T cell has been reported to bind PHA and to be involved in PHA-induced stimulation (O'Flynn et al., 1985 ) . The equivalent molecule in our study, BoCD2, was not affected by DM in vitro.",

            "text": "As stated above, Pruett et al. (1987) found that while PHA and ConA responses were suppressed, PWM responses were enhanced and suggested that this differential responsiveness of lymphocytes to mitogens was the result of a change in the sub-populations ofT lymphocytes. No data were presented by these authors to support this suggestion. Although we did not observe this differential responsiveness to the mitogens, we did observe changes in the populations of lymphocytes present in the circulation. Firstly, our results confirmed the reports of others (Wilkie et al., 1979; Pruett et al., 1987 ) that there was no selective loss of total T cells. However, we were able to demonstrate a selective loss from the circulation of the BoWC14, 7/~ T lymphocyte subpopulation\u2022 Previous findings have shown that in vivo depletion with mAbs in cattle resulted in a reduced response to all three mitogens in vitro if the BoCD4 \u00f7 lymphocytes were depleted, but an enhanced response to PWM alone if the BoWC 1 \u00f7 lymphocytes were depleted (Howard et al., 1989) . There is no obvious simple relationship between these observations and DM may have additional physiological effects on lymphocytes. The functions of the BoCD4 \u00f7 and BoCD8 \u00f7 cells in cattle are equivalent to those of the same phenotype in other animal species. The function of the BoWC1 + sub-population, that is highly sensitive to DM in vivo, is not fully understood\u2022 This phenotype characteristically produces the 7/~ form of TCR in ruminants (MacKay, 1988; Clevers et al., 1990) and may have a modulating effect on the immune response (Howard et al., 1989 ) . The relative lack of effect on cell surface mark-ers seen following in vitro culture with DM probably suggests that the changes seen in vivo are the result of a selective redistribution of cells from the circulation into peripheral lymphoid organs.",

We have also demonstrated that the immunosuppressive effects of DM differ depending on the mitogen being used and whether exposure to DM was carried out in vivo or in vitro. Clearly, different interpretations would be reached as to the cortisone sensitivity of the calves if only in vivo or in vitro studies had been conducted or if only one mitogen had been used in the proliferation tests. We would therefore suggest that the classification of a species as being corticosteroid-resistant or corticosteroidsensitive requires careful definition, not only of the age of the animal and dose of GC used, as others have demonstrated, but also of the tests used to assess immunosuppression and whether the tests are conducted following in vivo or in vitro exposure to GC. These results would also suggest that the mechanisms of stimulation by the mitogens PHA and ConA act through different pathways, perhaps at the second messenger level, and this system may provide a means whereby these pathways could be analysed.",
