            "text": "Caused by influenza virus, influenza or flu is A seasonal disease affecing millions of people in the world every year. In addition, influenza virus has the potency to cause severe pandemic and economic loss. 1 Currently, synthetic antiviral drugs or vaccines have limited use in developing countries due to the emergence of resistant strains, the high cost and the harmful side effects. 2, 3 However, anti-influenza compounds derived from herbs have many advantages such as low cost, low toxicity and extensive source 4, 5 Moreover, herbal drugs usually have multi-target effects, which not only act as antiviral agents but also stimulate immunity system. 6 Therefore, medicinal plant extracts and phytochemicals have been attracting more and more attention as the potential sources for the development of new antiviral drugs in the recent years. Banlangen (Radix Isatidis) is the dry root of plant Isatis indigotica Fort. Banlangen (Radix Isatidis) was firstly documented as the herbal medicine in The Divine Husbandman's Herbal Foundation Canon, a famous ancient medical book in the Han Dynasty of China (200 AD). 7 It has been used in the treatment of cold, sore throat and headache for hundreds of years in China. 8, 9 It was used for the prevention of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and swine flu pandemic in 2009 in China and Japan. 10, 11 Recently, the antiviral effect of the methanol, water and ethylacetate extract of Banlangen (Radix Isatidis) was confirmed in vitro test. 11, 12 However, the modes of antiviral actions of these extract are still not clear. Additionally, few publications have been reported about the differences of antiviral action between clemastanin B and epigoitrin and the extract where the compounds were isolated from. Phenylpropanoids (PEP), alkaloids and organic acids are three major chemical fractions in Banlangen (Radix Isatidis). Clemastanin B (CB) is the most abundant compound which belongs to phenylpropanoid and epigoitrin is the main alkaloid compound isolated from the Banlangen (Radix Isatidis) ( Figure 1 ). 13, 14 The latest studies showed that clemastanin B inhibited different subtypes of human and avian influenza viruses at different magnitudes of activity. 15 Epigoitrin has been used as a marker of antiviral efficacy in Banlangen (Radix Isatidis) in the 2010 edition of the Chinese Pharmacopoeia. 16 Our previous screening showed that CB and epigoitrin have strong inhibitory effects on influenza A1 virus FM1. 17 The present study aimed to investigate the anti-influenza mechanisms of CB and epigoitrin and compare with the phenylpropanoids portion and the mixture of phenylpropanoids, alkaloids and organic acid fractions (PEP + ALK + OA).",

The structures ( Figure 1 ) were elucidated by their ultra violet (UV), infrared radiation (IR), mass spectrometry (MS), 1 H-nuclear magnetic resonance ( 1 H NMR), 13 C-nuclear magnetic resonance ( 13 C NMR) and 2 dimensional nuclear magnetic resonance (2D NMR) data.

The phenylpropanoids, alkaloids and organic acid fractions were prepared using our previous methods. 19 According to yield of each fraction, the mixture of phenylpropanoids, alkaloids and organic acid fractions (PEP+ ALK + OA) was prepared by mixing each of the above fractions at a ratio of 1\u22362\u22362 (w/w).

The viability of MDCK cells at 72 h after infection of virus and simultaneous treatment with natural compounds was determined by MTT reduction assay. As shown in Table 5 , the viability of MDCK cells was significantly increased as the result of drug treatments compared with virus control (P < 0.01). The inhibition of virus absorption to the host cells by CB, epigoitrin and PEP was in a dose dependent manner. The maximum inhibitory effect of CB, epigoitrin and PEP was observed with a 1\u22362 dilution, which resulted in 3.53, 3.99 and 4.43 times increases in cell viability, respectively.

However, the differences were observed on the major modes of antiviral action between different compounds and chemical fractions (Figure 4 ). For instance, the highest cell protection rate in PEP or PEP + ALK + OA was from its therapeutic action (Figure 4 , PEP, A1; PEP + ALK + OA, A1). The main anti-influenza modes of epigoitrin are the inhibition of virus multiplication and virus attachment ( Figure 4 , epigoitrin A1, A3). In contrast, three modes of the antiviral action of CB contribute equally on the cell protection rate. CB is the major phenylpropanoid compound in Banlangen (Radix Isatidis) and epigoitrin is an abundant alkaloid which is also an marker for the quality control of Banlangen (Radix Isatidis). 18 Previously reported studies pointed that overall virus inhibitory effects of green tea were stronger in the plant total extract than any single pure compound from the extract due to the possible synergistic interactions between the ingredients. 22, 29 However, in our study, the results showed that the antiviral activity changed which might result from the differences of antiviral mechanisms between the single compound and the mixture of the extract.",
