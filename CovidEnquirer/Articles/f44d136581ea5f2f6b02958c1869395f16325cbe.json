            "text": "Encephalitis refers to the inflammation of the brain. The term includes both viral infections of the brain with predominantly gray matter disease and acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM), an immune-mediated demyelinating disease. In addition, other immune-mediated forms of encephalitis associated with antibodies to voltage-gated potassium channels, or Nmethyl-D-aspartate (NMDA) receptors, are being recognized with increasing frequency; being not viral associated, they are not discussed further here. Clinically, acute viral encephalitis and ADEM usually manifest with fever, severe headache, neck stiffness, alterations of consciousness, focal neurological signs, and often seizures, especially in children. The pathology of acute viral encephalitis is characterized by mononuclear inflammatory cells in a perivascular distribution in the gray matter and meninges and neural cell destruction with neuronophagia. The pathology of ADEM or postinfectious encephalomyelitis is characterized by perivenular mononuclear cell inflammation and demyelination predominantly in the white matter of the brain and the spinal cord. Both forms of encephalitis are linked primarily with viral infections, but both are also associated with some bacterial infections. Rarely, acute encephalitis may be due to fungal and parasitic infection, and ADEM may be associated with vaccines. The two forms of encephalitis occur because of different spectra of viruses and involve different mechanisms of pathogenesis. Following some general comments on viral pathogenesis, the two forms of encephalitis are discussed separately.",

Viruses have no mobility but must penetrate strong barriers to enter the body of a susceptible human host. The skin is covered by a layer of keratinized cells that will not sustain virus replication, but arthropods and animal bites, needles, and tissue transplantation can breach this barrier directly ( Table 1) . The mucous membranes of the respiratory, gastrointestinal, and genitourinary tract are protected by secretory immunoglobulins (Ig), and all are monitored by macrophages that phagocytize viruses and other particles. In addition, the respiratory tract has a mucous coating and cilia that beat the film containing inhaled particles outward and away from the epithelial cells of the lower respiratory tract, and the gastrointestinal and genitourinary tracts have extremes of acidity. A few nonenveloped, acid-resistant viruses (adenoviruses, enteroviruses, parvoviruses, and reoviruses) can survive passage through the acidity and solvents of the gastrointestinal tract.",

            "text": "Once permissive host cells are infected in the subcutaneous tissue, the mucous membranes, or the hematopoietic system (particularly macrophages), viruses replicate usually locally before there is invasion of the central nervous system (CNS). Spread into the CNS is via nerves or the blood ( Table 2) . For many years, the nerves, both peripheral and olfactory, were regarded as the sole portals into the CNS, and early experimental studies documented the neural transmission of rabies virus, herpes simplex virus, and polioviruses. Nerve endings have receptors for some viruses, and the viruses are transported by the retrograde axon transport system to the cell bodies, where replication is possible. This transport occurs in the peripheral nervous system along motor and sensory fibers and also within the CNS, exemplified by the movement of polioviruses between spinal cord motor neurons and corresponding cortical neurons. The olfactory pathway is a unique venue for neural spread because the olfactory rods extend out from the olfactory mucosa and the central processes of the olfactory neurons synapse within the CNS. Thus, a single neuron can provide transport from the ambient environment to the CNS. Despite this direct connection, few aerosol or respiratory infections have been found to invade through the olfactory route.",

            "text": "Although early studies concluded that the blood-brain barrier was impenetrable by viruses, most viruses do invade the CNS from the blood. Some viruses infect cerebral endothelial cells or choroid plexus epithelial cells and 'replicate before spreading' into the CNS. Others cross uninfected vascular endothelial cells into the brain in endocytotic vesicles or within infected mononuclear cells (e.g., human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)). Invasion from blood depends on the magnitude and duration of the viremia. Viruses in the blood are promptly removed by the reticuloendothelial system and, similar to other particles, speed of clearance is size dependent. Small viruses ( e.g., flavivirus such as the West Nile virus) are removed more slowly, and many larger viruses avoid clearance by growth in leukocytes or adhesion to red cells.",

For example, rabies virus infects only neurons, and early in infection neurons that modify behavior are selectively affected. This explains the unique clinical syndrome of vigilance and agitation. Similarly, polioviruses selectively infect and destroy motor neurons causing the syndrome of flaccid paralysis. Arboviruses infect primarily neurons, especially in the basal ganglia, and herpes simplex virus infects neurons, glia, and endothelial cells. JC virus selectively lyses oligodendrocytes causing demyelinating disease. Enteroviruses and mumps virus infect primarily meningeal and ependymal cells; therefore, they usually cause benign meningitis and only rarely are associated with encephalitis.",

Traditionally, neurotropism referred to the ability to infect neural cells other than neurons and is distinct from neuronotropism, which indicates the ability to infect neurons; however, in more recent literature, the term neurotropism is applied to both types of infection. Neurovirulence relates to the ability to cause disease. Thus, mumps virus that can often be recovered from spinal fluid during uncomplicated parotitis is highly neuroinvasive, is neurotropic in ependymal cells but not neuronotropic, and has a low level of neurovirulence. In contrast, most arbovirus infections are asymptomatic or cause only fever, malaise, and minor systemic symptoms. On rare occasions when arboviruses infect the brain, they usually cause encephalitis with a significant death rate; thus, these viruses are not highly neuroinvasive but are highly neurotropic (and neuronotropic) and neurovirulent. It must be noted that neuroinvasiveness and neurovirulence are also dependent on a myriad of host factors, such as age, immune responses, and genetic constitution.",

Encephalitis is more common in children than in adults and varies by gender, season, and geographical location. For example, CNS complications of mumps virus infections are three times more common in males than females.

The classic clinical symptoms and signs of encephalitis are fever, headache, nuchal rigidity, depression of consciousness, focal neurological signs, and often seizures. Occasionally, fever is not present at the time of presentation, stupor may obscure a complaint of headache, or nuchal rigidity may be absent; thus, no finding is absolute. Spinal fluid examination is critical for diagnosis. Typically, a mononuclear cell pleocytosis, modest elevation of protein, normal glucose concentration, and often increased pressure are found. Early in disease, polymorphonuclear cells may predominate or fluid may be acellular, but within 24 h a mononuclear cell response usually evolves.

Rabies may present as either an ascending paralysis simulating the Guillian-Barr\u00e9 syndrome or an altered mental status with periods of confusion with bizarre behavior and autonomic signs progressing to intense agitation with aerophobia and hydrophobia. Acute flaccid paralysis can also be a feature of flavivirus encephalitides, such as West Nile encephalitis, Japanese encephalitis, and tickborne encephalitis. Herpes simplex virus encephalitis usually localizes to one or both temporal lobes, which may manifest initially as subtle anomia, followed by bizarre behavior, hallucinations, aphasia, and quadratic visual field defects. Imaging studies typically show lowdensity lesions in one or both temporal lobes with enhancement and mass effect. Only approximately a half of patients with encephalitis with temporal lobe signs prove to have herpes simplex virus encephalitis. Arboviral encephalitis, however, often causes thalamic lesions on imaging. More than 90% of patients with herpetic encephalitis have temporal lobe changes, but herpes simplex virus causes only 10% of cases of encephalitis (even fewer in some geographical regions) and other agents may occasionally mimic these symptoms and signs.",

The second diagnostic imperative is to rule out nonviral disease that can masquerade as viral encephalitis and that requires specific therapies (Table 4) . Establishing a definitive diagnosis can also have significant public health implications depending on the agent identified. Diagnosis is dependent on identifying virus in spinal fluid or brain tissue or on serological tests that often require a convalescent serum too late to aid in acute management. In herpes simplex and other herpesvirus infections, polymerase chain reactions can identify specific viral DNA in spinal fluid. In many arbovirus infections, IgM-capture enzyme-linked immunoassays on spinal fluid can quickly identify specific viral infections.",
