At 16 and 20 days, the demyelination process was apparently complete and axons of different diameters were sometimes packed together. One and two months after kainate injection, the axonal environment changed again: remyelination of large-caliber axons occurred at the same time as reactive astrocytes, oligodendrocytes and numerous Schwann cells appeared in the tissue. Schwann cell processes surrounded aggregates of axons of diverse calibers, ensheathed small ones and myelinated larger ones. Axons were also remyelinated by oligodendrocytes. Horseradish peroxidase-labeled lemniscal afferents could be myelinated by either of the two cell types. After three months, the neuropile exhibited an increase in number of hypertrophied astrocytes and the progressive loss of any other cellular or axonal element.

Since it is well established that pathological changes of myelin ensheathment of central axons is responsible not only for functional but also for structural axonal alteration (see References and Discussion in Ref. 49) , excitotoxins may have a secondary deleterious effect on afferent systems to a neuron-depleted area.",

At the ultrastructural level, the identification of the axons was easily made when axons were surrounded by layers of myelin. In other cases, for unmyelinated or totally demyelinated axons, we relied upon the commonly accepted criteria. 46 Axons, in the CNS neuropile, are characterized as profiles having smooth contours and a cylindrical shape, display a clear cytoplasm that contains neurofilaments, arrays of microtubules and a few mitochondria and that, mostly, contains no ribosomes. Analysis of the neuropile between two days and 18 months after kainate injection aliowed us to characterize four different periods according to specific features of axonoglial injections: (i) a few days during which Wallerian degeneration predominated; (ii) the second week, characterized by profuse demyelination of axons; (iii) the third week in which the neuropile was devoid of myelinated axons; and (iv) subsequent periods in which large axons were remyelinated.",

A more hkely explanation comes from the demonstration that Schwann cells are normally present in the wall of small arteries, associated with innervation of the vessels.'0,23 Using tritiated thymidine, Harrison and Pollard*' have demonstrated that Schwann cells located in perivascular spaces, rather than those in the dorsal roots, proliferate following a demyelinating lesion of the spinal cord. Schwann cells penetrating the experimentallydemyelinated spinal cord have been observed in clusters surrounding capillaries,27~28~30.~s possibly in close proximity to a suitable extracellular matrix.\" A similar observation was made in our study. This suggests that, in the neuron-depleted area, capillary walls may act as the substrate along which Schwann cells can migrate out of their original location in the perivascular walls of small arteries. The extent of this phenomenon is probably increased by the reactive angiogenesis that takes place after kainate lesion.\" Astrocytes, bordered by a basal lamina, form a glia limitans wherever the CNS neuropile is in contact with peripheral elements.5.53,54 It has been clearly established that damage to the ghal limiting membrane is an important prerequisite to Schwann cell invasion of the CNS in demyelinating lesions of the spinal cord and the retina.r,s~Z*.42 The results obtained in the present study are in agreement with those summarized by Blakemore\" concerning the remyelination by Schwann cells of spinal cord demyelinated axons. It has been observed in the present ultrastructural study that kainate injection is followed first by swelling of astrocytic processes leading to a disruption of the tight layer formed around capillaries by astrocytic endfeet. This is in keeping with our previous light-microscopic analysis that showed that reactive astrocytes are not present in the neurondepleted area during the first weeks following kainate injection.20 These results clearly underline the transitory failure of astrocytes to oppose the invasion of Schwann cells. Astrocytes, however, rapidly increase in number after one month, becoming the prevailing elements after three months. In the kainate lesion, as in other experimental conditions in which a breach appears in the glia limitans, astrocytes tend to repair it, thereafter excluding Schwann cells,s~7~2'~5' forming, in the excitotoxic lesion. a tight glia limilans around every Schwann cell.",

Following the same reasoning, the observation of a long-term survival of target-deprived axons suggests some recovery of trophic influences in the target zone. The release of trophic factors in an excitotoxically lesioned area has been demonstrated biochemically34",

The subsequent action of astrocytes, systematically confining Schwann cells, would then appear to be quite a negative process that induces a complete sterilization of the neuron-depleted area which, in turn, could result in an extension of the neuronal loss to areas containing the neurons of origin of the then retracting axons.",
