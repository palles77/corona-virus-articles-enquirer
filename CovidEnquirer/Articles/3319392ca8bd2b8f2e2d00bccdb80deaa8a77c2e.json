This outbreak has been tentatively associated 29 with a seafood market in Wuhan, China, where the sale of wild animals may be the source of 30 zoonotic infection. Although bats are likely reservoir hosts for 2019-nCoV, the identity of 31 any intermediate host facilitating transfer to humans is unknown. Here, we report the 32 identification of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses in pangolins (Manis javanica) seized in 33 anti-smuggling operations in southern China. Metagenomic sequencing identified pangolin 34 associated CoVs that belong to two sub-lineages of 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses, 35 including one very closely related to 2019-nCoV in the receptor-binding domain. The 36 discovery of multiple lineages of pangolin coronavirus and their similarity to 2019-nCoV 37 suggests that pangolins should be considered as possible intermediate hosts for this novel 38 human virus and should be removed from wet markets to prevent zoonotic transmission.",

We conducted further qPCR testing 75 on another batch of archived pangolin samples collected between May-July 2018. Among the 76 19 samples (nine intestine tissues, ten lung tissues) tested from 12 animals, three lung tissue 77 samples were coronavirus positive. 78 79 In addition to the animals from Guangxi, after the start of the 2019-nCoV outbreak the 80 Guangzhou Customs Technology Center re-examined their five archived pangolin samples 81 (two skin swabs, one unknown tissue, one scale) obtained in previous anti-smuggling 82 operations in March 2019. Following high-throughput sequencing the scale sample was 83 found to contain coronavirus reads, and from these data we were able to assemble a partial The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https: //doi.org/10.1101 //doi.org/10. /2020 2019-nCoV have only 89.2% amino acid similarity in RBD. Indeed, the Guangdong pangolin 108 coronaviruses and 2019-nCoV possess identical amino acids at the five critical residues of the 109 RBD, whereas RaTG13 only shares one amino acid with 2019-nCoV (residue 442, human 110 SARS-CoV numbering 9 ). Interestingly, a phylogenetic analysis of synonymous sites alone in 111 the RBD revealed that the phylogenetic position of the Guangdong pangolin is consistent 112 with that in the remainder of the viral genome, rather than being the closest relative of 2019-113 nCoV ( Figure 2b ). Hence, it is possible that the amino acid similarity between the RBD of 114 the Guangdong pangolin coronaviruses and 2019-nCoV is due to selectively-mediated 115 convergent evolution rather than recombination, although it is difficult to choose between 116 these scenarios on current data. Although the drivers of any convergent evolution are 117 unknown, its possible occurrence, as well as that of recombination, would further highlight Coronaviruses, including those related to 2019-nCoV, are clearly present in many wild 135 mammals in Asia 5,6,7,11 .

Indeed, a number 49 of non-aquatic mammals were available for purchase in the Huanan seafood market prior to 50 the outbreak 4 . Unfortunately, because the market was cleared soon after the outbreak began, 51 determining the source virus in the wild animals from the market is challenging. Although a 52 coronavirus closely related to 2019-nCoV sampled from a Rhinolophus affinis bat in Yunnan 53 in 2013 has now been identified 6 , closely related viruses have not yet been detected in other 54 wildlife species. Here, we present the identification of 2019-nCoV related viruses the virome composition of pangolins (mammalian order Pholidota). These 58 animals are of growing importance and interest because they are the most illegally trafficked 59 of any group of mammal: they are used as both a food source and their scales are utilized in 60 traditional Chinese medicine. A number of pangolin species now are regarded as critically 61 endangered on the International Union for Conservation of Nature Red List of Threatened 62 Species. We received frozen tissue (lungs, intestine, blood) samples that were collected from 63 18 Malayan pangolins (Manis javanica) during August 2017-January 2018. These pangolins 64 were obtained during the anti-smuggling operations by Guangxi Customs. Strikingly, high-65 throughput sequencing of their RNA revealed the presence of coronaviruses in six (two lung, 66 two intestine, one lung-intestine mix, one blood) of 43 samples. With the sequence read data, 67 and by filling gaps with amplicon sequencing, we were able to obtain six full or nearly full 68 genome sequences -denoted GX/P1E, GX/P2V, GX/P3B, GX/P4L, GX/P5E and GX/P5L -69 that fall into the 2019-nCoV lineage (within the genus Betacoronavirus) in a phylogenetic 70 analysis (Figure 1a).

It is striking that two related lineages of CoVs are found in 122 pangolins and that both are also related to 2019-nCoV. This suggests that these animals may 123 be long-term reservoir hosts for these viruses, which is surprising as pangolins are solitary 124 animals with relatively small population sizes, reflecting their endangered status 10 . However, 125 it cannot be excluded that pangolins acquired their 2019-nCoV related viruses independently 126 from bats or another animal host. It is also notable that both lineages of pangolin 127 coronaviruses were obtained from trafficked Malayan pangolins, likely originating from 128 Southeast Asia, and there is a marked lack of knowledge of the viral diversity maintained by 129 this animal in regions where it is indigenous. Undoubtedly, the extent of virus transmission in 130 pangolin populations requires additional investigation, but the repeated occurrence of 131 infections with 2019-nCoV related coronaviruses in Guangxi and Guangdong provinces 132 suggests that this animal may be a potentially important host in coronavirus emergence. 133 134",

These 152 pangolins were seized by the Guangxi Customs during their routine anti-smuggling 153 operations.

Using the intestine-lung mixed sample we were able to 157 isolate a novel Betacoronavirus using the Vero-E6 cell line (Extended Data Figure S1). A 158 High Pure Viral RNA Kit (Roche, Switzerland) was used for RNA extraction on all 43 159 samples.

RNA was extracted 189 from all five samples (Qiagen, USA), and was subjected to high-throughput RNA sequencing 190 on the Illumina HiSeq platform by Vision medicals, Guangdong, China. The scale sample 191 was found to contain coronavirus reads using BLAST methods. These reads were quality 192 assessed, cleaned and assembled into contigs by both de novo (MEGAHIT v1.1.3 12 ) and 193 using reference (BWA v0.7.13 13 ) assembly methods, with BetaCoV/Wuhan/WIV04/2019 as 194 reference.
