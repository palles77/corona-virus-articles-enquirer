Cultures of BEK-1 cells were prepared as described previously (Inaba et al., 1976) . The growth medium used wv~ Eagle's minimum essential medium (MEM) containing 10% tryptose phosphate broth (TPB) and 10% calf serum, and the maintenance medium was MEM containing 10% TPB, 0.05% yeast extract, 0.5% sodium glutamate and 0.1% glucose. 84 Culture fluid harvested from infected BEK-1 cells was used as HA antigen after centrifigation at 600 g for 10 min to remo~e coarse debris, and stored at -20 and -70\u00b0C. Blood was obtained in Alsever's .olution and stored at 4\u00b0C. Chicken erythrocytes (0.5%) were used, unless otherwise stated. HA and HA inhibition (HI) tests were carried out by the microtiter method. The following is the standard method established in the present study. In the various experiments presented in this paper this technique was followed, unless otherwise specified.",

Chicken, mouse, rat and hamster erythrocytes were agglutinated at all three temperatures, whereas erythrocytes from human (O), cattle, horse, sheep, guinea pig, goose, duck, pigeon and 1-day old chicken failed to agglutinate under the test conditions. Sharpee et al. (1976) also reported HA with mouse, rat and hamster erythrocytes. However, contrary to our result, they observed no HA wi~h erythrocytes from chickens. These contradictory results were explained by our subsequent observation that erythrocyte samples from individual birds showed a wide variation in their agglutinability with the virus as shown in Table I . Therefore, a selection of birds is required to obtain erythrocy~s for HA. Culture fluid harvested from infected BEK-1 cells showing cytopathic changes has HA titers of between 8 and 32. Fig. 1 illustrates a representative example of HA antigen production as well as that of viral infectivity in the fluid phase of roller tube cultures of BEK-1 cells incubated at 34\u00b0C after infection at an input multiplicity of 0.1 50% tissue culture infectious doses (TCIDs0)/cell. The HA titer rose rapidly between 2 and 3 days after inoculation with a subsequent gradual rise to a plateau of 32 at 6 days post infection. The curve of viral infectivity resembled that of HA production although it rose somewhat earlier.",

Even at 56\u00b0C no change in titer was shown for 6 h, a two-fold decline in 12 h, and no titer remained after 24 h of incubation. On the other hand, the viral infectivity was rapidly lost at 56\u00b0C; the original titer of ).04.s TCIDs0/ ml declined to ~03\"2 in 10 rain and no infectivity was detected after 20 rain of incubation.
