Textbooks, reviews, and conferences focusing on the airway frequently ignore this facet of management despite the observation that airway complications are significantly more likely to be associated with extubation than intubation. 14 Many of these \"complications\" are relatively minor, such as coughing and transient breathholding, and have little or no impact upon outcome. Some, however, are life threatening. Moreover, some can be predicted and, with proper preparation, morbidity and mortality can be reduced.",

This chapter classifies the complications associated with tracheal extubation (and the exchange of endotracheal tubes), attempts to stratify the risk of extubation (and tube exchange) in various clinical settings, and proposes strategies that may prove helpful in reducing serious complications or death. Low-risk or routine extubation has been reviewed elsewhere 124, 192 and is discussed in less detail. It is important to point out that neither the proposed stratification nor the strategies recommended in dealing with intermediate-and high-risk extubations have been validated by controlled, prospective trials. Such trials would be helpful, but it may not be prudent to await their conclusion.",

In a large French multicenter prospective survey conducted between 1978 and 1982, involving nearly 200,000 patients, postoperative respiratory depression accounted for 27 of 85 respiratory complications that were life threatening or resulted in serious sequelae. Such complications were responsible for seven deaths and five cases of hypoxic encephalopathy. 248 Rose and colleagues found that 0.2% of 24,000 patients had a respiratory rate of less than 8 breaths/min, as detected by PACU nurses following general anesthesia. 221, 222 Hypoventilation may be mediated centrally at the level of the upper motor neuron, the anterior horn cell, the lower motor neuron, the neuromuscular junction, or the respiratory muscles. Clinical correlates include central sleep apnea, carotid endarterectomy, 259 medullary injuries, demyelinating disorders, direct injury to peripheral nerves, poliomyelitis, Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, motor neuron disease, myasthenia gravis, and botulism.

Coughing at extubation may be particularly troublesome in the setting of ophthalmologic, neurologic, tonsil, thyroid, and vascular surgery. A variety of strategies have been proposed to minimize coughing, including deep endotracheal extubation, the primary use of or conversion to an LMA, 12, 154, 198 the intravenous or topical application of a local anesthetic to the vocal folds, 239 and the use of intracuff lidocaine. 97, 98 Apart from the aforementioned settings, coughing upon emergence is both common and relatively benign for most patients. As this chapter is being prepared, a respiratory illness (severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]) has emerged with significant transmission to health care workers, particularly those involved with airway management. Currently, there is no specific treatment for SARS and it is associated with considerable morbidity and mortality. This has resulted in a reevaluation of the risks of coughing, at least in a subset of patients. It is premature to speculate upon the long-term and geographic implications of this illness; however, from the perspective of an anesthesiologist in the North American epicenter for SARS, Toronto, Canada, 38, 215 coughing upon emergence potentially disperses infected respiratory droplets on those in the patient's vicinity. Currently, this has necessitated a \"new normal\" protective strategy including appropriate apparel (goggles and/or visor, N95 particulate respirator, gloves, gown, and an air-powered protective respirator hood when SARS is suspected or diagnosed) for those in the patient's vicinity.",

Laryngeal or tracheal trauma may occur despite a good laryngeal view 189 or during awake fiberoptic intubation. 182 Anatomic or functional laryngeal problems are more likely to develop as a consequence of difficult or prolonged intubation attempts. 221 Possible airway injuries include laryngeal edema, laceration, hematoma, granuloma formation, vocal fold immobility, and dislocation of the arytenoid cartilages. 249 Glottic edema has been classified as supraglottic, retroarytenoidal, and subglottic. 36 Supraglottic edema results in posterior displacement of the epiglottis reducing the laryngeal inlet and causing inspiratory obstruction. Retroarytenoidal edema restricts movement of the arytenoid cartilages, limiting vocal cord abduction during inspiration. Subglottic edema, a particular problem in neonates and infants, results in swelling of the loose submucosal connective tissue, confined by the nonexpandable cricoid cartilage. In neonates and small children, this is the narrowest part of the upper airway and small reductions in diameter result in a significant increase in airway resistance. In children, laryngeal edema is promoted by a tight-fitting ET, traumatic intubation, duration of intubation greater than 1 hour, coughing on the ET, and intraoperative alterations of head position. 156 These investigators found an incidence of 1% in children younger than 17 years. Laryngeal edema should be suspected when inspiratory stridor develops within 6 hours of extubation. Management of laryngeal edema depends upon its severity. Treatment options include head-up positioning, supplemental humidified oxygen, racemic epinephrine, helium-oxygen administration, reintubation, and tracheostomy.",

Posterior glottic and subglottic stenosis related to contracting scar tissue results in increasing obstruction weeks or months following extubation. Benjamin found that fiberoptic evaluation or laryngoscopy with the tube in situ was of limited value. An ET obscures the view of the posterior glottis and subglottis. These lesions were best identified using rigid telescopes with image magnification during general anesthesia. This permitted the anticipation of problems and the development of a management strategy. 25 ",

This is protective to the extent that it prevents aspiration of solids and liquids. It becomes maladaptive when it restricts ventilation and oxygenation. The intrinsic laryngeal muscles are the main mediators of laryngospasm. These include the cricothyroids, lateral cricoarytenoids, and the thyroarytenoid muscles. The cricothyroid muscles are the vocal cord tensors, an action mediated by the superior laryngeal nerve. Management of laryngospasm consists of prevention by either extubating at a sufficiently deep plane of anesthesia 147 or awaiting recovery of consciousness. Potential airway irritants should be removed and painful stimulation should be discontinued. If laryngospasm occurs, oxygen by sustained positive pressure may be helpful, although this may push the aryepiglottic folds more tightly together. 228 Very small doses of a short-acting neuromuscular blocker 55, 164 with or without reintubation may be necessary.",

Indeed, the ASA closed claims analysis revealed that 58% of airway trauma and 80% of the laryngeal injuries were associated with \"nondifficult\" intubations. 51, 80 (Judging from the closed claims analysis, DIs were more likely to result in pharyngeal and esophageal injuries.) Tracheal and laryngeal trauma may, however, produce dislocation of the arytenoid cartilages. 249 Tolley and others described three cases involving two adults and one child. 249 A prematurely born male had required prolonged ventilation for infantile respiratory distress syndrome. At 6 years of age, he came to medical attention for investigation of a weak voice. A unilateral prolapsed arytenoid was noted and was managed with speech therapy. The adults had had difficult and unsuccessful intubations, whereas the child had not. Removal of the ET in one case and the tracheostomy tube in the other case was followed by stridor requiring immediate reintubation or recannulation. Laryngoscopy revealed a unilateral dislocated arytenoid in one case and contralateral vocal cord palsy in the other case. In both cases, an arytenoidectomy was performed. The authors suggested that this complication could be more common than the literature would have us believe. Persistent postextubation hoarseness, a breathy voice, and an ineffective cough should prompt an assessment by an otolaryngologist.",

Differentiation may require palpation of the cricoarytenoid joints under anesthesia or laryngeal electromyography. 177 When vocal fold paralysis occurs as a surgical complication, it is usually associated with head and neck, thyroid, or thoracic surgery. The left RLN can also be compressed by thoracic tumors, aortic aneurysmal dilation, left atrial enlargement, or during closure of a patent ductus arteriosus. Occasionally, a surgical cause cannot be implicated. Cavo postulated that an overinflated ET cuff may result in injury to the anterior divisions of the RLN. 47 The ex-SLN supplies the cricothyroid muscle and is a true vocal cord tensor. The RLN supplies all of the intrinsic laryngeal muscles except the cricothyroid. Unilateral ex-SLN results in the retention of adduction but the affected vocal fold is shorter with a shift of the epiglottis and the anterior larynx toward the affected side. This results in a breathy voice but produces no obstruction. Bilateral ex-SLN injury causes the epiglottis to overhang, making the vocal folds difficult to visualize. If seen, they are bowed. This produces hoarseness with reduction in volume and range but no obstruction. Unilateral RLN injury causes the vocal fold to assume a fixed paramedian position with a hoarse voice. There may be a marginal airway with a weak cough. Bilateral RLN results in both vocal folds being fixed in the paramedian position with inspiratory stridor, often necessitating a tracheostomy. 179 Pharyngeal, nasopharyngeal, and esophageal injuries including perforation, lacerations, contusions, and infections may be associated with difficult laryngoscopy or intubation but may also result from the blind passage of a gum elastic bougie, nasogastric 117 or nasotracheal tube, 230 suction catheter, or transesophageal echo 150 or temperature probe. Unfortunately, recognition of pharyngeal perforation may be delayed, resulting in mediastinitis, retropharyngeal abscess, and death. 263 Following a brief intubation, soft tissue injury resulting in airway obstruction is more likely to result from edema or hematoma than infection. Most of the preceding injuries do not significantly complicate extubation per se. Likewise, laryngeal and tracheal stenoses are serious complications but they are rarely evident at the time of extubation.",

            "text": "Burn patients may have both \"intrinsic\" and \"extrinsic\" airway injuries. Circumferential neck involvement is an example of an extrinsic injury. Smoke inhalation or thermal injuries are examples of intrinsic injuries. Burn patients are at particular risk for requiring reintubation. They are known to exhibit bronchorrhea and have impairment of mucociliary clearance and local defenses, laryngeal and supraglottic edema, increased carbon dioxide production, and progressive acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). Carbon monoxide may also diminish their level of consciousness and thus their ability to protect their airway. Kemper and associates reported on the management of 13 burn patients younger than 15 years, 7 of whom exhibited postextubation stridor. Treatments with helium and oxygen resulted in lower stridor scores than those of patients treated with an air-oxygen mixture. 149 They found that 11 of 30 extubated burn victims required treatment for stridor after extubation, consisting of racemic epinephrine, helium-oxygen, reintubation (n = 5), or tracheostomy (n = 1). The absence of a cuff leak was considered to be the best predictor of failure, with a sensitivity of 100% and a positive predictive value of 79%. 149 A variety of conditions may lead to airway edema severe enough to encroach on the ET, preventing leakage of expired gas around the deflated cuff. If tissue swelling is sufficiently severe, it may result in airway obstruction following extubation. These conditions include generalized edema, angioneurotic edema, anaphylaxis, deep neck infections, pemphigus, and epidermolysis bullosa. The most common situation probably occurs in the ICU after prolonged intubation. Adderley and Mullins described the cuff leak test to evaluate children with croup. 1 This was performed by deflating the ET cuff, occluding the tube, and assessing air movement around the tube. Kemper and coworkers concluded that the cuff leak test was the best predictor of successful extubation in a pediatric burn and trauma unit. 148 Fisher and Raper found the test to be sensitive but not specific for predicting stridor, necessitating reintubation. 103 Others have measured the cuff leak volume as the difference between inspiratory and expiratory tidal volumes during assistcontrol ventilation, following cuff deflation. 88, 193 Both studies found the cuff leak volume to be predictive of postextubation stridor. Efferen and Elsakr found that 8 of 45 patients exhibited stridor, 4 of whom required reintubation. 88 In another study involving 88 adult medical ICU patients (100 intubations), 6 patients exhibited stridor, 3 of whom required reintubation. They observed a significantly lower cuff leak in patients who subsequently developed stridor, concluding that this measurement was the best predictor of the presence or absence of stridor. 193 Using the same protocol as Miller and Cole, Engoren evaluated 561 consecutive patients following cardiothoracic surgery. 92 The majority of their patients (79%) were extubated within 24 (median 12) hours. Only three patients exhibited stridor, two of whom were managed medically with racemic epinephrine. All three patients had cuff leak volumes much higher than the threshold of 110 mL proposed by Miller and Cole. None of the patients with cuff leak volumes less than 110 developed stridor, leading Engoren to conclude that this test was not reliable in his population.",

The optimal strategy to manage this relatively common problem has not been determined. Persistence with endotracheal intubation may worsen laryngotracheal injury, subject the patient to greater discomfort, and have considerable economic or resource implications. Tracheostomy, on the other hand, may be unnecessary in a significant proportion of patients. Reintubation in the ICU is associated with significant morbidity and mortality, 75, 194 particularly if it cannot be achieved easily. The following approach seems reasonable regarding patients in an intensive care setting: if the previous intubation is known to have been easy, no new factors have intervened to complicate laryngoscopy, and experienced personnel are and will remain immediately available, it may be sound to extubate a patient in the absence of a large cuff volume leak. If there is any doubt about the ease of reintubation, either a tube exchanger may be employed (see later) or a tracheostomy should be performed. Patients with little or no cuff leak prior to extubation should be monitored very closely.",

Venna and Rowbottom 256 described 180 patients who had undergone upper cervical spinal surgery, deemed by the surgeon to be at high risk for postoperative swelling. They elected not to extubate patients if they failed (unspecified) extubation criteria, which included demonstration of a cuff leak and the absence of significant upper airway edema on laryngoscopy. This strategy resulted in an average extubation time of 33.5 hours, with 12 patients (6.6%) developing postextubation stridor and breathing problems, 5 of whom required reintubation. Interestingly, the average time from extubation to required reintubation was 14.6 hours and the resultant duration was 6 days. Two deaths occurred as a result of an inability to reintubate. This suggests that such patients warrant careful postoperative monitoring if they fulfill criteria for extubation. Furthermore, reliance on these criteria alone may fail to identify patients who require but cannot be successfully reintubated.",

In contrast to the high-risk extubations, they are more easily dealt with. Bag-mask ventilation or reintubation, if required, should not pose a particular challenge. The intermediaterisk patient, for example, may have a preexisting medical condition 172 such as Wegener's granulomatosis or sarcoidosis that results in airway obstruction. They may undergo surgical procedures that are associated with an increased risk of postoperative airway obstruction. Chronic pulmonary or cardiac disease may compromise spontaneous ventilation and necessitate intubation. The patient with an ineffective cough or increased secretions may have a need for pulmonary toilet. An obtunded patient may be unable to protect his or her airway. A more complete list of intermediate-and high-risk extubations is provided in Table 47-2. As previously mentioned, the high-risk designation applies to settings in which replacement of a removed ET may be reasonably expected to be difficult, complicated, or unsuccessful. Reintubation is potentially and fundamentally different from the original intubation because it is likely to occur in an urgent or emergent setting, with limited information and equipment. The patient is more likely to be hypoxic, acidemic, agitated, or hemodynamically unstable, and the procedure may be done in haste. A preemptive strategy is appropriate in the management of such patients. (Table 47 -3)",

The diagnosis of PVCM was made endoscopically and managed with \"relaxation techniques.\" Following preoperative sedation, topical lidocaine, and bilateral SLN blocks, she underwent an awake fiberoptic intubation. At the conclusion of her surgery, extubation was performed when she was fully awake; however, sustained inspiratory stridor ensued, resulting in reintubation. A subsequent attempt the following day confirmed inspiratory vocal fold adduction and a tracheostomy was required for 58 more days. Michelsen and Vanderspek 191 described recurrent postextubation stridor complicating a cesarean section.

Most authors have advised that speech therapy, psychotherapy, hypnosis, and calm reassurance are helpful, but such is not always the case. 126 Some reports have recommended electromyographically guided botulinum toxin injection into the thyroarytenoid muscle for recalcitrant cases. The optimal anesthetic management of these patients is not known. Regional anesthesia avoids airway intervention but does not ensure that a condition that may be stress related will not occur. Familiarity with this condition, calm reassurance when there is prior suspicion, and perhaps deep extubation seem prudent. This author has cared for a patient precisely fitting the description of the typical patient-a young, female, health care worker with a prior history of postextubation stridor requiring repeated reintubations. 126 Extubation was performed under deep propofol sedation, an LMA was inserted, and the upper airway was observed endoscopically with spontaneous respiration. The airway was widely patent and normal, functionally and anatomically. As the sedation was reduced and consciousness was regained, the false and true vocal folds increasingly constricted, obstructing the laryngeal inlet and resulting in stridor. Tracheal extubation was accomplished by very gradually reducing the propofol infusion.",

Thirteen of 252 (5%) patients required reintubation, most within 1 hour of extubation. Twelve of 13 had undergone laryngeal biopsy. Most of these patients had chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and their need for reintubation was attributed largely to this. They did not state whether their patients had received topical anesthesia or vasoconstrictors. They had not received prophylactic steroids, although the value of this adjunct is not well established. 130 Robinson prospectively studied 183 patients having 204 endoscopic laryngeal procedures. 219 Seven patients had tracheostomies prior to or subsequent to their surgery because of \"high-risk\" airways. Two of the remaining patients developed postoperative stridor, one of whom required reintubation and the other a delayed tracheostomy. Indirect laryngoscopy, carried out 4 to 6 hours following surgery, revealed mucosal hemorrhage or laryngopharyngeal swelling in 32% of cases. The patients undergoing tracheostomy were not described, and it is possible that the low incidence of reintubation resulted from an aggressive approach to preemptive tracheostomy. 186",

The incidence of permanent nerve palsies with benign goiters was 0.5 per 100 operations. This was more common in substernal goiters (4%) and thyroid cancer (9%). In the latter group, it is sometimes necessary to sacrifice the nerve to achieve an adequate resection. It remains to be determined whether methods of intraoperative RLN monitoring will reduce this complication. 128, 131 Although bilateral RLN palsy is rare, thyroidectomy is the leading cause of this injury. The external branch of the superior laryngeal nerve, supplying the cricothyroid muscle that tenses the vocal folds, is believed to be vulnerable during thyroid dissection; however, the frequency of this injury is unknown. 160 Local hemorrhage or hematoma occurred postoperatively in 0.1% to 1.1% of the patients in the literature review and in 0.36% of the patients cared for by Lacoste and colleagues. 160 These occurred from 5 minutes to 3 days postoperatively. Reexploration within the first day was required only twice. Airway obstruction may result from significant laryngeal and pharyngeal edema and wound evacuation may be of limited value in the relief of airway obstruction. 34 The prophylactic placement of surgical drains probably reduces the incidence of this complication. Rarely, wound evacuation may result in a significant improvement of the airway obstruction. 43",

It must take into consideration such factors as the patient's level of consciousness, the patient's ability to maintain satisfactory gas exchange, and the integrity of protective airway reflexes. In addition, consideration must be paid to the difficulties originally encountered in securing the airway and an evaluation of whether reintubation would be easier or more difficult as a consequence of surgery and resuscitation. The lack of guidance from the literature makes communication between anesthesiologist, surgeon, and intensivist essential. Intermaxillary fixation requires that wire cutters be immediately available and that personnel know which wires to cut, should this prove necessary. A fiberoptic bronchoscope, provisions for an emergency surgical airway, and the required expertise should be immediately available at the time of extubation. Many would advocate that fiberoptic airway evaluation be performed prior to extubation, although assessment may be limited to supraglottic structures and exclusion of tube entrapment. Ideally, extubation should be accomplished in a \"reversible\" manner, permitting oxygenation, ventilation, and reintubation should this prove necessary (see \"Extubation Strategies\" in Section IV of this Chapter).",

The literature is unclear about the indications for preoperative or postdrainage tracheostomy, although clearly a surgical airway is required if efforts to intubate are unsuccessful or constitute a serious risk of rupturing the abscess. Potter and colleagues retrospectively compared the outcomes of 34 patients in whom a tracheostomy was performed and 51 patients who remained intubated following surgical drainage. 214 All patients had undergone surgical drainage for impending airway compromise and required airway support postoperatively. It was not always evident to the investigators why a particular strategy was chosen. Airway loss occurred more commonly in the intubated patients, but this was not statistically significant. Two deaths occurred, one resulting from an unplanned extubation and the other from postextubation laryngeal edema and inability to reestablish the airway. Interestingly, the latter patient was noted to have a cuff leak prior to extubation and developed signs of obstruction 30 minutes after the ET was removed. If a decision is made to manage the patient without a tracheostomy, great care must be taken to ensure proper timing of extubation and the immediate provision of equipment and expertise to attend to potential complications. It is improbable that drainage will result in immediate airway improvement, and reintubation or an emergent surgical airway, if required, may be complicated by edema, tissue distortion, and urgency.",

Dysphonia, dyspnea, or stridor may be misinterpreted or obscured by other features of the disease. Kolman and Morris described a patient who developed severe recurrent airway obstruction following extubation, despite an easy atraumatic intubation performed by direct laryngoscopy. 157 At laryngoscopy, the vocal folds appeared white, thickened, and poorly mobile despite complete reversal of neuromuscular blockade. An urgent ENT consultation confirmed the diagnosis of paramedian vocal cord fixation secondary to cricoarytenoid arthritis. The glottic inlet was severely narrowed, necessitating a tracheostomy under local anesthesia. Decannulation was achieved after 1 month. Complete airway obstruction is a well-described but fortunately an infrequent complication, despite involvement of the cricoarytenoids in 26% to 86% of patients with RA. 155, 157 This disarticular joint can be affected like any other joint with inflammation, pannus formation, cartilaginous or ligamentous erosion, joint space obliteration, ankylosis, and fibrosis. Chronic cricoarytenoid arthritis may be mistaken for asthma or chronic bronchitis, with symptoms of dyspnea, hoarseness, or stridor. At laryngoscopy, the mucosa may be rough and thick and the vocal chink is narrowed. Although airway obstruction occurs most commonly in patients with long-standing RA having polyarticular and systemic involvement, laryngeal stridor has been described as the sole manifestation of this disease. 118 The combination of a potentially unstable cervical spine, difficult direct laryngoscopy, and the risk of postextubation airway obstruction makes the patient with RA the prototype of the high-risk extubation. Several authors have recommended postponing extubation until the patient is wide awake. Unfortunately, this provides increased protection against nothing other than laryngospasm and aspiration. In addition, the prevailing wisdom is that patients with limited mouth opening and a potentially unstable cervical spine should be intubated with a flexible fiberscope. 262 This method involves the blind passage of the ET through the cords, which may be traumatic, 60, 182 particularly in the presence of preexisting cricoarytenoid arthritis. Regional anesthesia should be considered as an alternative to general anesthesia when appropriate. When intubation cannot be avoided, proposed extubation strategies include a preemptive tracheostomy or a method that increases the \"reversibility\" of extubation. Neither strategy has been prospectively evaluated in this population. These are discussed in detail under \"Extubation Strategies.\"",

            "text": "Epidermolysis bullosa. This rare condition, with more than 25 described variations, results in separation of layers of skin and mucous membranes with fluid accumulation caused by a deficiency in intercellular bridges. 266 Shearing forces are particularly damaging and may result in separation, bullous formation, hemorrhage and healing by scar formation, and subsequent tissue contraction. Laryngeal involvement is extremely rare, and tracheal bullae have never been reported. 41 A retrospective report involving 33 patients undergoing 329 surgical procedures identified no postoperative airway problems, although microstomia was noted in 13 of the patients. 142 Giant oropharyngeal bullae and profuse bleeding from a ruptured oral bulla and a large fibrosing supraglottic bulla have, however, been reported to cause airway obstruction. 102 Pemphigus. Pemphigus embraces a group of rare immunologically mediated vesiculobullous diseases (vulgaris, foliaceus, pemphigoid, and others), which frequently involve mucous membranes. Ninety percent of patients with vulgaris have oromucosal involvement at some point. 266 Most lesions heal without scarring unless they become secondarily infected. Microstomia is not a feature. Management of such patients is similar to that of patients with epidermolysis bullosa. Severe upper airway obstruction secondary to cicatricial laryngeal pemphigoid has been reported, 81, 90, 267 although this complication appears to be uncommon. 181 Tracheomalacia. Tracheomalacia is a dynamic airway obstruction resulting from loss of the cartilaginous tracheal support. Clinically, it should be considered when unexpected inspiratory obstruction is identified. The diagnosis may be confirmed fiberoptically during spontaneous breathing. The negative intrathoracic pressure of inspiration results in partial collapse of the affected segment. Diagnosis may also be confirmed by CT 9 or MRI scans. 100 This may be congenital 185 or result from vascular compression, 252 be caused by an intrathoracic goiter (see later), or develop as a consequence of prolonged intubation. The latter is presumably related to cuff-induced erosion of the tracheal cartilage with or without extension to the membranous trachea. The severity of the dynamic obstruction is proportional to the inspiratory force. Thus, a distressed patient is more likely to exhibit severe symptoms. Positive pressure or bypassing the lesion with an ET provides relief while further management options are considered. These might include medical management, surgical resection, or placement of a stent. 265 Additional suggestions for the extubation of a patient with suspected tracheomalacia are proposed later.",

            "text": "Relapsing polychondritis. Relapsing polychondritis is a rare, multisystem disease characterized by episodic inflammation of cartilaginous structures resulting in tissue destruction. 134 Laryngeal and tracheal tract involvement occurs in approximately half of the patients. This usually occurs early in the course of the disease and may be manifested by complaints of hoarseness, nonproductive cough, shortness of breath, and stridor. Upper airway obstruction is usually diffuse and may progress to involvement of the glottis, subglottic area, trachea, and bronchial cartilages. Histologically, there is evidence of perichondral inflammation and replacement of cartilage by fibrous tissue, manifesting in inflammatory swelling and progressive destruction of cartilage. The clinical manifestations range from bronchorrhea and recurrent pneumonia to airway collapse. Medical management consists of steroids, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, and immunosuppressants, but these are of variable benefit. Surgical management consists of external airway splinting or self-expanding metallic stents. These patients may present for fiberoptic bronchoscopy, tracheostomy, tracheal or nasal reconstruction, aortic valve replacement, or stent placement. 35, 44, 104, 127, 252 Airway collapse following extubation should be anticipated and may be effectively dealt with by CPAP. 2, 253 Obstructive sleep apnea syndrome. Obstructive sleep apnea (OSA) correlates positively with age and obesity, both of which are becoming increasingly prevalent. It has been estimated that 80% to 95% of patients with OSA are undiagnosed. 28 OSA syndrome also appears to be associated with difficulty in mask ventilation, 167 laryngoscopic intubation, 53, 96, 218 and accelerated arterial oxygen desaturation. 29 The risk of airway obstruction following surgery has been noted to be increased for patients with OSA, 216 with an incidence of life-threatening postextubation obstruction of 7 of 135 (5%) patients. 96 Rapid desaturation, difficult mask ventilation, and difficult direct laryngoscopy 144 make this a particularly high-risk setting. It is essential that such a patient be fully awake, recovered from neuromuscular blockade, and have a sustained spontaneous respiratory rate; that nasal CPAP be available or routinely implemented 143, 216, 218 ; and that consideration be given to extubation over a tube exchanger. 28 (These strategies have been associated with better outcomes, and anecdotal comparisons are very compelling but they have not been subjected to controlled, randomized trials.)",

Szokol and associates described a morbidly obese patient with OSA in whom such a procedure was performed. 244 Both laryngoscopy and bag-mask ventilation had been difficult. At the conclusion of the procedure, the patient was fully awake, able to sustain a head lift for 5 seconds, demonstrated a negative inspiratory pressure of 40 cm H 2 O, and was extubated. Stridor was noted immediately, and bag-mask and LMA ventilation was ineffective. Attempts to reintubate the patient were unsuccessful, necessitating a cricothyrotomy. Subsequent direct laryngoscopy showed a markedly swollen epiglottis and grossly edematous laryngeal and hypopharyngeal tissue. The patient developed negative-pressure pulmonary edema and a tracheostomy was performed 2 days later because of persistent swelling. Tracheal decannulation occurred uneventfully 2 weeks later. The authors speculated that airway manipulation during the surgery was the cause of this patient's swelling. They did not consider that the swelling may have resulted from or at least been worsened by repeated attempts at laryngoscopy.",

Prior to intubation, difficult bag-mask ventilation may result in gastric distention.

Postoperative nausea, delayed gastric emptying, residual neuromuscular blockade, relaxation of the esophageal sphincters, decreased level of consciousness, gagging on an ET, and impaired laryngeal competence may all make emergence from anesthesia and tracheal extubation as problematic as induction. At present, it is not possible to offer evidence-based recommendations on an extubation strategy to reduce aspiration. It would seem logical to minimize the preceding contributing factors-postoperative nausea and vomiting, residual neuromuscular blockade, decreased level of consciousness and associated diminished protective airway reflexes, and perhaps gastric evacuation. We do not know whether gastric decompression reduces aspiration, although a well-seated ProSeal LMA (PLMA) may 61, 184 or may not 63 offer some protection from aspiration. Nonetheless, with the present body of information, it is not appropriate to recommend specifically the use of this device in a patient recognized to be at increased risk for aspiration.",

Deep extubation ordinarily would involve the prior reversal of neuromuscular blockade and resumption of spontaneous ventilation. Its purported advantage is the avoidance of the adverse reflexes associated with extubation, such as hypertension, dysrhythmias, coughing, laryngospasm, and increased IOP or ICP. The fundamental disadvantage of deep extubation is the patient's inability to protect the airway against obstruction and aspiration. If it is improperly executed, laryngospasm and its attendant complications are more likely to occur. Although not having to await the recovery of consciousness may accelerate OR turnover, the exhalation of unscavenged volatile anesthetic agents may result in occupational health and safety issues. A significant proportion of American anesthesiologists practice the technique, at least some of the time, yet there are very few data in adults comparing the safety of deep versus awake extubation. 68 Koga and colleagues compared three small groups of adult patients, extubated deep, awake, or extubated deep following the insertion of an LMA. 154 Straining occurred in a high (but comparable) proportion of patients whether the ET was removed prior or subsequent to recovery of consciousness. Deep extubation followed by LMA insertion (isoflurane 2% to 3%) is discussed subsequently. Deep extubation is contraindicated when mask ventilation was found or is likely to have become difficult, the risk of aspiration is increased, endotracheal intubation had been difficult, or airway edema is likely.",

The LMAs were removed when the patients resumed spontaneous ventilation and obeyed commands. None of the 10 patients coughed, and changes in the rate-pressure product were minimal. The authors concluded that the technique might prove useful in patients undergoing other types of surgical procedures. They stressed that this substitution should be performed only by those skilled in LMA insertion. Patients must be at a sufficient depth of anesthesia or coughing, breath holding, laryngospasm, and the very pressor responses this substitution is intended to avoid may occur. Bailey and others recommended that the LMA be inserted prior to removal of the ET, with the purported advantage of not risking loss of the airway following tracheal extubation. 77, 154 Compared with deep tracheal extubation followed by Guedel airway insertion, there was a lower incidence of coughing and requirement for airway manipulation. 77 Koga and coworkers compared this technique with deep and awake tracheal extubation. As previously mentioned, they observed no difference in recovery conditions between patients in whom the ET was removed either deep or awake; however, they noted a significant improvement in recovery conditions when the LMA substitution was performed. This technique might be useful in patients undergoing procedures in which coughing, straining, and intraocular, intracranial, and BP changes could be particularly detrimental. Patients at risk for aspiration are not protected. Furthermore, patients difficult to intubate by laryngoscopy are probably poor candidates for this technique because airway patency cannot be guaranteed after the LMA substitution.",

The ET is slowly withdrawn into the oropharynx with subsequent, very gradual withdrawal of the FOB to the supraglottic region. Once the patient is comfortable, the FOB is further withdrawn to a position just above the vocal cords.

He was also suffering from severe ARDS. A WuScope allowed successful glottic visualization, permitting the insertion of a suction catheter anterior to the existing nasotracheal tube. The latter was withdrawn and the replacement oral ET was easily advanced over the suction catheter with minimal interruption of mechanical ventilation. In this author's opinion, the visual control possible with a WuScope (or presumably a Bullard Scope [Circon, Santa Barbara, CA], Upsher UltraScope [Mercury Medical, Clearwater, FL], or videolaryngoscope) is preferable to the blind passage of an ET over an FOB or tube exchanger. A hollow tube exchanger, however, would have permitted jet ventilation if desaturation or difficulties with tube advancement had occurred.

Oxygen insufflation or jet ventilation can be provided through the tube exchanger. Respiratory monitoring can also be achieved by connection to a capnograph. Spontaneous breathing may take place around the device. In most reports, these have been tolerated well enough that they can be left in situ until it is probable that reintubation will not be required. Even with the catheter in place, most patients are able to talk or cough. If reintubation or a tube exchange is required, this can be facilitated with gentle laryngoscopy, not necessarily to reveal the glottis but to retract the tongue. Reintubation using a tube exchanger is similar to intubation over an FOB, and the difference of diameters between the tube exchanger and the advancing ET may predict the relative ease of tube advancement.

The smallest can be used with a 3 mm ID ET. These devices are radiopaque and have distance markings between 15 and 30 cm from the distal end. There are two distal side holes and an end hole. Proximally, there are two types of connectors, secured and released by a patented Rapi-Fit adapter. These were designed for easy adapter removal as the ET is being off-loaded and subsequent reattachment for ventilation while the new tube is being introduced. A secure Luer-Lok fitting is available for jet ventilation and a 15-mm connector for manual ventilation. The length and inner diameters (1.6 to 3.4 mm) make manual ventilation with a resuscitation bag possible but impractical because resistance is so high. The 15-mm Rapi-Fit connector serves primarily as a means of connecting the exchange catheter to an oxygen source. During jet ventilation, the paucity of distal side holes potentially increases catheter whip and the risk of barotrauma. 89 Loudermilk and others used the 11 Fr, 83 cm CAEC in 40 high-risk adult extubations, 3 of which required reintubation. This was easily performed with each attempt. The exchange catheters were also used for oxygen insufflation. All but one patient tolerated the device, and dislodgement occurred in one patient. 178 Atlas and Mort examined the relationship between the diameter of the two larger CAECs and tolerance as well as the ability to phonate and cough. 17 It is unclear whether their patients were randomly assigned to specific sizes of catheters. Phonation and discomfort were similar in both groups with only 3 of 101 patients experiencing significant discomfort. Cough effort tended to be reduced in the larger sized CAEC, but this did not achieve significance. Atlas also looked at a larger tube exchanger (JEM 400 ET Changer, Instrumentation Industries, Bethel Park, PA), which it was reasoned would have a higher degree of success as a tube exchanger. This device has an OD of 6.35 mm and is said to be stiffer. Atlas adapted the JEM 400 using the Rapi-Fit connector from the CAEC 19-83 to enable jet ventilation. 16 This device, however, has only a single end hole and is not recommended for jet ventilation (see later).",

Using an in vitro model, with three sizes of Sheridan TTX catheters, Dworkin and colleagues measured the inspiratory and expiratory flows resulting from 50 psi injection as the simulated upper airway resistance, lung compliance, gas flow rate, and injection times were varied. 85 The upper airway resistance was determined by the effective tracheal diameter, which they defined as a computed difference between the OD of the TTX and tracheal diameter. They simulated upper airway obstruction by using various sizes of ET adapters, ranging from 11 to 3.5 mm ID, in the proximal airway. The gas flows through the large, medium, and small tube exchangers, when connected to a pressure source of 50 psi, were 63, 33, and 12 L/min, respectively. In their model, if the difference between the tracheal and TTX diameters resulted in an effective tracheal diameter that was greater than 4 to 4.5 mm, air trapping did not occur. Because increased upper airway resistance and reduced effective tracheal diameter resulted in larger tidal volumes, they concluded that jet ventilation through a long catheter, positioned close to the carina, caused little Venturi effect. Such ventilation was not greatly dependent upon air entrainment. Placement of the catheter close to the carina may ensure a higher oxygen concentration (by reducing room air entrainment), but it also increases the risk of distal catheter migration and barotrauma.",

An alternative approach would be to reduce the driving pressure. Gaughan and others assessed the tidal volumes and air entrainment in a model lung with a range of compliance sets, ventilated by high and low flow regulators through 14 and 16 g intravenous catheters. 113 Their high-flow regulator, at steady state, produced flow rates of 320 L/min at 100 psi, whereas the low-flow regulator produced flows up to 15 L/min at 9 to 5 psi. Intravenous catheters, because of their short length, offer considerably less resistance to flow. Their proximity to the upper airway also results in greater air entrainment (15% to 74%). Both high-and low-flow regulators allowed adequate minute ventilation in the setting of normal tracheal and bronchial diameters and normal compliance. The authors recommended that during transtracheal jet ventilation, when low-flow regulators were used, an inspiratory/expiratory ratio of 1:1 should be used because it yields the greatest minute ventilation. Although this observation is undoubtedly true, it remains to be determined whether such minute volumes are either clinically necessary or safe. 30, 64 ",

The patient was recovered and was noted to have a left pneumothorax that the authors attributed to catheter migration and unilateral ventilation. They mentioned that they had encountered three cases of pneumothoraces and one pneumoperitoneum in approximately 600 such procedures. The authors drew attention to the importance of catheter placement and advised that even brief airway obstruction can result in barotrauma. However, they failed to mention that vocal fold apposition as recovery occurs may promote such a complication. In a subsequent paper, the same authors stated that the \"jet stylet\" had been used for the ventilation of six patients resulting in normocarbia and adequate ventilation. 23 Egol and associates described pneumothoraces or a pneumoperitoneum in three patients using a variety of delivery devices and driving pressures. 89 These included an 18 Fr suction catheter at 50 psi, a nasogastric sump tube at 20 psi (inspiratory time = 30%), and a fiberoptic laryngoscope at 40 psi. They attributed the barotrauma observed to incorrect catheter placement, ventilation during phonation, and possible direct mucosal penetration from jet injection. They examined the relationship between the number of distal side holes in the tube exchanger and the pressure at the catheter tip. The more side holes at a given driving pressure, the lower the pressure at the catheter tip. They recommended vigilance regarding the location of the catheter tip (avoidance of direct mucosal contact, insertion into orifices where exhalation may be restricted, and securing the catheter to minimize migration); advocated for catheters with multiple side holes, the use of small-diameter jet catheters to minimize the resistance to exhalation, and the use of the minimal effective driving pressure; and encouraged the development and use of an effective pressure sensor and pressure cutoff device.",

Between 1991 and 1993, Irish and colleagues used this device with a driving pressure of 50 psi in anesthetized and paralyzed patients undergoing percutaneous tracheostomies. 140 They observed barotrauma in one patient.

In a subsequent report, a patient ventilated for 90 minutes at only 20 psi developed a pneumothorax. 64 Chan and Manninen also described the use of the ETVC to provide jet ventilation. 49 After performing a fiberoptic intubation in a patient with an unstable cervical spine, they discovered that the cuff of the ET had been damaged. They inserted an FOB through the other nostril and advanced this through the cords, anterior to the original ET. They then passed an ETVC through the original ET and provided three breaths of jet ventilation at 50 psi. The patient developed a pneumothorax. Unfortunately, they used a high driving pressure through an exchange catheter that may have been too deeply inserted in the setting of a significantly reduced effective tracheal diameter (partial cuff deflation, 6-mm ET, and FOB passing through the vocal cords).",

The duration of inspiration should be minimized while the duration of exhalation is determined by observing the return of the thoracic diameter to its preinspiratory position. The depth of catheter insertion should be far enough from the carina that distal migration does not occur but not so proximal that jet ventilation results in the catheter's ejection from the glottis.

Accordingly, the ASA Task Force and the Canadian Airway Focus Group have recommended that each anesthesiologist have a preformulated strategy for extubation of the DA. This chapter proposes a risk stratification scheme in an effort to identify patients in whom special extubation precautions might be of benefit. A variety of strategies are presented, although generally the benefits of these have not been subjected to rigorous evaluation. The concept of a reversible extubation using a tube exchanger has been presented. When such a device is used as a stylet, it does not provide a guarantee that reintubation will succeed.
