Methods Cats ranged from 3.4-73 months of age (mean 13.6 months); 26 had effusive or dry-to-effusive FIP and five had non-effusive disease. Cats with severe neurological and ocular FIP were not recruited. The group was started on GS-441524 at a dosage of 2.0 mg/kg SC q24h for at least 12 weeks and increased when indicated to 4.0 mg/kg SC q24h. Results Four of the 31 cats that presented with severe disease died or were euthanized within 2-5 days and a fifth cat after 26 days. The 26 remaining cats completed the planned 12 weeks or more of treatment. Eighteen of these 26 cats remain healthy at the time of publication (OnlineFirst, February 2019) after one round of treatment, while eight others suffered disease relapses within 3-84 days. Six of the relapses were non-neurological and two neurological. Three of the eight relapsing cats were treated again at the same dosage, while five cats had the dosage increased from 2.0 to 4.0 mg/kg q24h. The five cats treated a second time at the higher dosage, including one with neurological disease, responded well and also remain healthy at the time of publication. However, one of the three cats re-treated at the original lower dosage relapsed with neurological disease and was euthanized, while the two remaining cats responded favorably but relapsed a second time. These two cats were successfully treated a third time at the higher dosage, producing 25 long-time survivors. One of the 25 successfully treated cats was subsequently euthanized due to presumably unrelated heart disease, while 24 remain healthy. Conclusions and relevance GS-441524 was shown to be a safe and effective treatment for FIP. The optimum dosage was found to be 4.0 mg/kg SC q24h for at least 12 weeks.",

FHV-associated disease was the first feline viral infection to incorporate an antiviral for treatment. 3 Highly fatal systemic calicivirus affects only a small number of cats. FIPV infection is the best candidate for antiviral drug development as vaccines are ineffective, multi-cat environments make prevention extremely difficult and it kills 0.3-1.4% of cats around the world. [7] [8] [9] The emergence of exotic diseases such as Ebola, Middle East respiratory syndrome and severe acute respiratory syndrome in people has prompted intensive research into drugs that will inhibit RNA virus replication. One of the most promising antiviral drugs against emerging RNA viruses is the adenosine nucleoside monophosphate prodrug GS-5734 (Remdesivir; Gilead Sciences). GS-5734 has been effective in preventing experimental Ebola in rhesus monkeys, 10 and inhibiting both epidemic and zoonotic coronaviruses in tissue culture and in mouse infection models. 11 These promising findings prompted initial research on GS-5734 and its parent nucleoside GS-441524 against FIPV infection of cats. 12 GS-441524 and GS-5734 were found to have comparable EC50 (1.0 \u00b5M) and CC50 (>100 \u00b5M) values against FIPV in cat cells. Therefore, it was decided to concentrate on the less chemically complex GS-441524 for further testing with laboratory cats. A pharmacokinetic study in two laboratory cats demonstrated sustained and effective plasma levels of GS-441524 over 24 h following a single dose given subcutaneously (SC) or intravenously (IV). These results were then extended to 10 laboratory cats with experimentally induced abdominal effusive feline infectious peritonitis (FIP). 12 This study showed GS-441524 to be highly effective against experimental FIP and opened the way for the present field trial.",

Institutional rules precluded the use of diseased cats obtained directly from shelters or kitten foster/rescue groups, thus requiring that all cats be legally owned/adopted and treated under specific conditions and with owner consent (supplementary material). The study did not incorporate a control group because there is no effective treatment to compare it against. A placebo treatment group was not included, given that preparatory in vitro and in vivo studies indicated that GS-441524 would be safe and more effective than no treatment. 12 Case selection and disease confirmation Cats with FIP were recruited from owners or their veterinarians seeking current treatment options or access to an earlier antiviral drug trial. 6 The initial diagnosis of FIP was based primarily on characteristic signalment, clinical histories and disease signs, routine laboratory test results, and examination of abdominal or thoracic effusions. A more definitive diagnosis based on RT-PCR or immunohistochemistry was desirable but not essential for inclusion. Cats with obvious ocular or neurological disease were discouraged to enter the trial because of concerns over the ability of antiviral drugs, including GS-441524, to penetrate the blood-brain or blood-eye barriers. 12, 15 Thirty-one cats and their owners were ultimately recruited (Table 1) . Owners or representatives of 26 cats came to UC Davis for initial treatment, and five owners and their cats (CT59, CT73, CT76, CT78, CT80) were treated by their local veterinarian. Cats seen at UC Davis were re-evaluated and their FIP diagnosis reconfirmed based on signalment, clinical history, physical examination, prior laboratory test results and a repeat of complete blood count (CBC), serum protein and effusion analyses. Thoracic or abdominal effusions from cats with wet FIP were confirmed positive for FIPV 7b RNA by RT-PCR. 16 Cats with signs of non-effusive FIP were further tested by abdominal and thoracic ultrasonography for primary lesions. Ocular disease was confirmed by the ophthalmology service of the VMTH, UC Davis. Neurological status in cases with possible central nervous system disease signs was evaluated by the VMTH neurology service.",

Immediate pain reactions were manifested by vocalization, occasional growling and postural changes lasting for 30-60 s. These initial reactions lessened in severity over time as owners became more adept at administering the injection and cats became more adjusted to the routine. Sixteen of 26 treated cats manifested injection site reactions (Table 3) . Reactions were most common during the first 4 weeks and progressed to open sores only in 7/16 cats. Ulcerations healed within 2 weeks by clipping surrounding hair and gently cleaning the wound with a cotton ball soaked in one-part household hydrogen peroxide and two-parts water twice a day. Only three cats had noticeable scars at injection sites. 3 and 4) . Tests for liver and kidney function and levels of amylase/lipase remained normal during and after treatment (supplementary figures S1-S3).

Although these signs were still mild in nature, a decision was made to stop treatment out of caution.

Both processes are well-established targets for several viral diseases in people. 1 A key question is how treatment with a nucleoside analog compares with that of a viral protease inhibitor. The two drugs gave virtually identical results in tissue culture and experimental cat infection studies. 12, 15 However, efficacy against naturally occurring FIP appeared greater with GS-441524 than GC376. Six of 20 cats treated with GC376 remain in remission to date (Pedersen NC, unpublished data, 2018) compared with 25/31 cats treated with GS-441524. Disease relapses that did not respond to retreatment occurred in 14/20 cats with GC376 and only one cat treated with GS-441524. 6 Eight of the 14 relapses associated with GC376 were neurological in nature, 6 compared with 2/8 relapses with GS-441524. One of two neurological relapses in GS-441524-treated cats responded to retreatment at a higher dosage, whereas neurological relapses with GC376, even with increased dosage, were no longer treatable. 6 Both treatments caused similar injection site reactions. Both drugs appear to be quite safe, although GC376 interfered with the development of permanent teeth when given to younger kittens. 6 Although the results of field testing appear to favor GS-441524, some of the difference may have been influenced by how the two drugs were administered. Efficacy of GC376 may have improved if all 20 cats had been treated without interruption for 12 weeks, rather than treated for progressively longer periods starting at just 2 weeks. 6 Five of the six cats cured with GC376 were among the seven cats that were treated continuously for 12 weeks, while only one of 13 cats treated one or more times for shorter periods of time was cured. These shorter treatment times were essential for determining the 12 week period used for all cats in the present study. The GC376 field trial also involved fewer cats and was constrained by a limited supply of the drug, which made it difficult to test other dosage regimens. Therefore, GC376 should be further studied using a minimum of 12 weeks with a higher dosage and a larger number of cats before making any final comparisons. It would also be important at some time in the future to evaluate both types of drugs in combination, as done for HIV/AIDS and hepatitis C.",

The five early deaths in this study were included in the analysis of GS-441524 efficacy but removed from consideration in the GC376 trial. If they are included in the trial, it is important to determine virus status at the time of death. Viral RNA was not detected in the three necropsied cats that died after 2-5 days of GS-441524 treatment, suggesting that the drug was effective but that the disease process was too far advanced. This did not appear to be the case in a fourth necropsied cat that survived for 26 days; viral RNA levels did not decrease over the entire treatment period and disease signs were unabated. Therefore, it is possible that this cat died because of failure to halt virus replication. Resistance to GS-5734 (Remdesivir), a prodrug of GS-441524, has been associated with amino acid mutations in RNA polymerase and proofreading exonuclease in tissue culture propagated coronaviruses. 17 Whether a similar type of resistance occurred in this cat remains to be determined. Drug resistance was also seen in one cat in the GC376 trial. 6 Fortunately, none of the other cats in the current trial showed signs of drug resistance at any time. However, it is something that needs to be considered in future cats that fail to respond or respond poorly to primary or secondary treatment. The initial dosage of GS-441524 used in the present study was determined from prior pharmacokinetic and experimental infection studies with laboratory cats. 12 These studies indicated that both 2.0 and 5.0 mg/kg SC q24h for 14 days would be equally effective for field testing. Therefore, the 2.0 mg/kg dose was chosen for the field trial, as it would cut drug usage by 60%. Although this decision was validated in 18/26 cats, eight other cats either suffered disease relapses (two for a second time) or required longer treatment periods to get key blood values back to normal. Therefore, a decision was made to increase the dosage of GS-441524 from 2.0 mg/kg to 4.0 mg/kg SC q24h in cats that relapsed or required extended treatment. The success of 4.0 mg/kg SC q24h for at least 12 such cats, as well as one cat with neurological disease, led us to the conclusion that it was a more effective dosage and should be the basis for future treatment.",

PCV, serum total protein, globulin and albumin levels, and the A:G ratio were identified as useful markers. Based on these parameters, it appeared that cats had not completely recovered after 6-10 weeks of treatment. This finding validated the 12 week minimum treatment period determined by an earlier GC376 field trial. 6 Anemia of chronic disease (anemia of inflammation) affects 18-95% of people with acute and chronic infections and is normocytic/normochromic and not associated with iron deficiency. 18, 19 Plasma albumin levels were also a good measure of disease activity, and low albumin and low PCV are known to coincide in situations of chronic disease. 19 Hyperglobulinemia in cats with FIP has been classified as infectious/inflammatory and is caused by increases in all gamma globulin classes and variable increases in alpha-2 globulins. 20 The strong tendency for cats with FIP to have high serum globulin and low albumin levels makes the A:G ratio a particularly good indicator of disease activity. 21 An expectation was that the pedigreed cats would not respond as well to treatment because of a genetic weakness in their ability to respond immunologically to FIPV 22 and that younger cats with effusive FIP would be most responsive. 6 However, the pedigreed cats in the present trial responded equally well as the random-bred cats, and the breeds represented by the cats in the study mainly mirrored the breeds' current popularities. Older cats, and cats with pure non-effusive FIP, also responded as well to GS-441524 treatment as young cats and cats with effusive FIP.

Three cats (CT52, CT74, CT77) in the present study were 4 months of age or younger and still had their juvenile dentition, and none showed any subsequent dental abnormalities. Injection site reactions were observed with GS-441524, but these were remarkably low in number and were easily treated. It was not determined whether the drug, diluent or both were at fault. The 1.5 pH of the diluent was well below the minimum Food and Drug Administration (FDA) threshold of 4.5, but drugs of this type are difficult to solubilize and stabilize at more physiologic pH. Nonetheless, more physiologic diluents should be evaluated.",

Although the cat presented with effusive abdominal FIP, it also had long-standing signs of vague hindlimb lameness, lower back pain, periodic bouts of falling, reluctance to jump to higher places, and unexplainable and transient changes in behavior. These signs prompted the cat to be treated for a long time after the abdominal effusion disappeared. A decision was ultimately made to discontinue treatment and see if more characteristic FIP signs would recur. The cat was ultimately euthanized and found to have congenital-type HCM and no residual lesions of FIP or viral RNA in any tissues upon necropsy. Dilated cardiomyopathy has been reported in 17.6% of HIV-infected people on chronic antiretroviral therapy. 23 It was concluded, however, that GS-441524 was not the cause of the heart disease in this cat. Heart disease in this cat was hypertrophic rather than the dilative form seen in patients with HIV, and HCM is a common condition among shelter cats. 24",
