The antituberculosis activity was evaluated by using the Microplate Alamar Blue Assay and the antiviral activity was evaluated against diverse viruses in mammalian cell cultures. According to the biological activity studies of the compounds, 5a-c displayed hope promising antitubercular activity, 6d was found as potent for Coxsackie B4 virus, 5d was found as effective against Feline corona and Feline herpes viruses. Consequently, the obtained results displayed that, 5a-d and 6d present a leading structure for future drug development due to its straightforward synthesis and relevant bioactivity.",

The MIC was defined as the lowest concentration affecting a reduction in fluorescence of 90% relative to controls.

Initial drug dilutions were prepared in either DMSO or distilled deionized water, and subsequent twofold dilutions were performed in 0.1 cm 3 of 7H9GC (no Tween 80) in the microplates. BACTEC 12B-passaged inocula were initially diluted 1:2 7H9GC, and 0.1 cm 3 was added to wells.

Additional control wells consisted of bacteria only (B) and medium only (M). Plates were incubated at 37\u00b0C. Starting at day 4 of incubation, 20 mm 3 of 10x Alamar Blue solution (Alamar Biosciences/Accumed, Westlake, Ohio, USA) and 12.5 mm 3 of 20% Tween 80 were added to one B well and one M well, and plates were reincubated 37\u00b0C.

After standing for 3 days, 2amino-3-[(4-bromobenzoyl)methyl]-4-(ethoxycarbonylmethyl)thiazolium bromide (1) was obtained [29] . Thereafter, compound 1 was boiled under reflux in absolute ethanol and via the ring closure of compound 1, ethyl [6-(4-bromophenyl)imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-3-yl]acetate hydrobromide (2) was obtained [29] . By heating the compound 2 and hydrazine hydrate in ethanol, 2-[6-(4-bromophenyl)imidazo[2,1-b]thiazole-3-yl]acetohydrazide (3) was obtained [30] . The compound 3 and cyclic ketones were heated under reflux in ethanol to yield 6-(4-bromophenyl)-N 2 -(substituted/non-substituted cycloalkylidene)imidazo [2,1-b]thiazole-3-acetohydrazides (4a-d). The reaction yields of compounds 4a-d were between the interval of 95%-72.5%. 4a-d were then reacted with mercaptoacetic acid / 2-mercaptopropionic acid in anhydrous benzene under reflux by using a Dean-Stark water separator. The obtained reaction mixture was eventually neutralized with NaHCO 3 solution and by that way 2-[6-(4-bromophenyl)imidazo[2,1-b]thiazol-3yl]-N-(2-nonsubstituted/methyl-6,7,8-nonsubstituted/alkyl/aryl-3-oxo-1-thia-4-azaspiro [4.4] non/ [4.5] dec-4-yl]acetamides (5a-d, 6a-d) were obtained. The reaction yields of the compounds 5a-d and 6a-d were between the interval of 87.8%-54.4% and 95%-54%, respectively. When the chemical structures of the synthesized compounds were examined, it was observed that the carbonyl group was not present in the compounds 4a-d whereas the same group was present in the spirothiazolidinone ring of the compounds 5a-d and 6a-d. Also according to the IR spectroscopy results, the stretching band belonging to the carbonyl group was not visible in the spectrum of the compounds 4a-d whereas the mentioned band was able to be observed in the range of 1724-1707 cm \u22121 for 5a-d and 6a-d. The IR values belonging to the carbonyl groups of spirothiazolidinone ring of 5a-d and 6a-d were in agreement with the literature [33, 34] . In the 1 H NMR analysis, the NH 2 protons of compound 3, which were observed as a broad singlet peak (2H) at 4.38 ppm, was disappeared in compounds 4a-d, whereas the peaks of aliphatic CH 2 groups belonging to cyclic ketone arose as multiplet in the range of 3.15-1.44 ppm. When the results obtained from compounds 5a-d examined, it was determined that the peaks of S-CH 2 protons were added to the spectrum in the range of 3.68-3.60 ppm as a distinctive indicator related to the formation of the mentioned compound [33, 35, 36] . Also from the 1 H NMR analysis data obtained from compounds 6a-d, it was determined that the S-CH and CH-CH 3 peaks of the spirothiazolidinone ring were in the range of 3.95-3.90 and 1.43-1.40 ppm, respectively and the values were in compliance with the literature [37, 38] .",

The compounds were screened for their antiviral and antitubercular activity. The antimycobacterial activities of the compounds were tested against the Mycobacterium tuberculosis H37Rv strain and in the test method, each value, in which the MIC value was equal to less than 10 \u00b5g/mL, was actively accepted for antimycobacterial activity. The MIC values of the compounds 5a, 5b, and 5c were determined as 8.453 \u00b5g/mL, 1.566 \u00b5g/mL and 0.854 \u00b5g/mL and the molecules were found as active. Also, compound 6d was found as effective for Coxsackie B4 virus. The antiviral activity and cytotoxicity of the compounds against Feline corona and Feline herpes viruses were investigated in CRFK cell cultures and in comparison with HHA, UDA and Ganciclovir references, compound 5d was found as highly effective. The findings revealed the promising antiviral and antitubercular activity of acyl-hydrazone, spirothiazolidinone and 2-methyl-substituted spirothiazolidinone derivatives of imidazo [2,1-b] thiazole and these derivatives could be an interesting starting point for further structural optimization to obtain new promising and more potent antiviral and antitubercular agents.",
