The obesity/diabetes epidemic is going to affect countries like China and India dramatically, while countries with an aging population like Japan, Germany, and the UK will be hit by the consequences of AD the hardest. Models of the consequences show that up to 15% of the work force will be involved in the 24/7 care of AD patients. These trends should be shaking governments into action.",

Where do we stand with the development of drugs to be used in the therapy of AD patients? The scientific background is such that in this disease there are both sporadic forms, accounting for 99.8% of cases, and clear familial (or inherited) forms, which is to say, cases that have an early onset of disease at about 40 to 45 years based on a genetic predisposition; these account for 0.2% of cases. There are several other genetic vulnerabilities identified. A very frequently occurring vulnerability is being a carrier of a protein isoform called ApoE4. One can carry two of these gene copies when one is homozygotic. One can carry one ApoE4 and one ApoE3, which is more common in the population, when one is heterozygotic. But, the vulnerability for AD is significantly higher in the Genome Project's parallel study, 83 and Jim Watson, 84 the co-discoverer of double helix. 85 In the first case, Venter's sequence showed increased risk of AD 86 and in the second case the ApoE3/4 encoding sequence was omitted from Watson's data at the specific request of Dr. Watson. He did not want to know if he were susceptible to an incurable disease to which a grandmother had succumbed. 87 Interestingly, the cost of the Human Genome Project was $3 billion over 13 years, Venter's sequence cost some $100 million, and Watson's was variously reported at $1-2 million in 2-4 months. 88 The costs are dropping in a dramatic manner: Complete Genomics, Life Technologies, and Illumina have disclosed that from January 2012 they will provide a full genome sequence for anyone for $1,000. We have yet to start a discussion about what cognitively happens to individuals carrying both the ApoE3 and ApoE4 genes-one from each parent-as their age increases.",

This is because when people with familial disease are treated, we are fairly sure of the causative mechanism. It may be compared to the increasing introduction of companion diagnostics in oncology: treating those who have a genetic cause of the tumor improves responder rates from 5% to over 60%. 89 Yet we have great difficulties in finding any (preventive AD) trials involving family members of patients who have or have died from familial AD. The patient associations that \"organize\" these individuals have good lists of who would be eligible, but basic research and pharma have failed these people and missed this opportunity for two reasons. One is pure greed: \"Why wait 4-5 years to show in familial cases that a therapy works, and then do another 4-5-year study in the real market representing sporadic patients?\" goes the argument. It is added that \"it is hard to recruit for familial case clinical trial,\" which does not seem to be true, or it has to do with the second factor: the drugs we so far have put into trial are associated with such bad side effects that it is hard to convince people presently fully healthy, even if they know that they are likely to have early AD, to endure the side effects for an uncertain delay of the onset or for the prevention of the disease. We need to improve science and pharmacy, and we need governments, not NGOs, to pay for the more focused trials. 90 89 See Chapter 08. 90 See also Chapter 11, where we may reveal that our argument is vindicated: one trial, designed in the way we recommend, is now being conducted.

They are now able to detect mild cognitive impairments and early AD. But nobody really knows how much damage has already occurred in the brain when cognitive impairment becomes obvious to relatives, friends, and colleagues. It is, therefore, very important that 2011 has seen the clinical entry of several imaging agents. 92 When working well, these permit the visualization of amyloid plaques in the living brain, and might, therefore, be important in establishing whether a drug aimed at inhibiting the production of amyloid peptide is really successful in reducing the plaque load. It is, however, evident that nobody is bothered by carrying amyloid plaques. When it is conclusively shown that the amyloid plaque load predicts cognitive impairment, we will then be able to convince people who exhibit no cognitive evidence of AD to take drugs that prevent the formation of amyloid peptide and amyloid plaques.

Some of these candidates would have to be prepared to test this drug in trials that will take 3-5 years. The principle is very similar to the way we have convinced millions and millions of people to take the cholesterol-lowering statins. High cholesterol per se is not a disease, but it is a harbinger of many cardiovascular diseases. If amyloid peptide and amyloid plaques can be detected and shown more rigorously to be a harbinger of AD, then volunteers would be easier to find.

When considering the importance of this, one has to remember that until the 1960s the pharma industry had been responsible for the basic research in most areas of life sciences (except embryology), which was the foundation for most of the drug developments. Since the 1960s, government-sponsored research in physical and life sciences in the United States and Western Europe has increased (the \"Sputnik effect\") and has almost completely replaced the basic research efforts of big pharmaceutical companies. It is true that pharma spent $92 billion on research and development in 2009, but a very small portion, maybe $10 billion, of this was considered basic research.

Society would then rely on different sized companies, small ones first and bigger ones later, to pick up the scientific breakthroughs and apply them in the development of novel drugs.

They have, during these last 40 years, been the major contributors to the basic science breakthroughs that are the scientific basis of drug development in the world's private pharmaceutical companies, which all abandoned in-house basic research from 1980 to 2000. The government-sponsored research institutions, together with some major NGO-sponsored research entities (e.g., the Wellcome Trust, the Howard Hughes Medical Institute, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation), have introduced a multitude of extremely important tools to preclinical and clinical research. These permit the regulatory agencies and the industry to measure and improve the success of drug discovery, drug development, and the drug approval processes. Starting in 2012 the NIH collaborated officially with the Food and Drug Administration (FDA); in principle they are both government sponsored. This will assist the FDA, which has so far relied on ad hoc panels of academics for scientific advice, to lean more on scientists in government pay. NIH scientists have a much stronger set of rules to keep them from receiving payments from the industries that apply for drug approval. This will help dilute the requirement of Congressional Committees periodically to uncover high-profile examples of the FDA receiving advice from academics with a conflict of interest. Conflict of interest is a serious matter that can undermine all public trust in the impartiality of FDA decisions regarding drug approvals, no matter if the decision itself was impartial. Thus, the recent, long-awaited official agreement, pushed by the Obama Administration, to improve the quality and image of FDA decisions by having two U.S. tax-payer financed organizations, the NIH and the FDA, sharing scientific competence, bodes well. The NIH is the world's powerhouse for preclinical discoveries through its intramural and extramural programs, and it is important in academic medicine in small proof-of-concept trials; however, as a clinical research organization, it is small to medium sized. The roughly $5 billion spent by the NIH on clinical projects and the $700 million proposed for translational research in 2011-2012 is dwarfed by the estimated $92 billion research budgets of major pharma and major biotech spent in the same year on R&D, over 85% of which is translational research (see Tables 5.1 and 5.2). The effort is also dwarfed by the collective experience that exists in these companies in the development and testing of clinically useful drugs.",

This so-called point of care device, of which we will see many in other indications, enables patients to control their own therapy, which in this case is of great importance. The first glucose meter developed by Boehringer Mannheim was as big as a refrigerator and required 2-4 ml blood. Today's machines use just a drop of blood, are pocket-sized, and, in most countries, given free of charge. This locks the patients into buying the measuring strips, much like Kodak practically gave away the instamatic camera so you would buy its film. That this marketing works shows how widespread self-monitoring of blood glucose has become.Secondly, we realize that there are drugs like the GLP-1 (glucagon-like peptide-1) analogs and inhibitors of the GLP-1 degrading enzyme DPP-4 (dipeptidyl peptidase-4), which can fine-tune glucose control and will postpone some of the diabetic complications.The problem for those who are developing diabetes drugs is that wehave a very large number of relatively efficacious, cheap, generic drugs such as metformin, 93 which have side effects but work quite well. For the largest number of patients these drugs will remain the mainstay of their diabetes treatment because they are well known and because they are cheap. The new drugs have to demonstrate significant improvements over the presently available insulin releasers, insulin sensitizers, and so on. In this quest for better control of blood glucose, we have also learned metabolic disease patients are accepting of injection, not only of insulin but also of other drugs. This opens the route for the use of biologicals in an area where this was not widely foreseen. Today, the GLP-1 analog exenatide (Amylin/Lilly's Byetta-a synthetic version of exendin-4) and its competitor liraglutide (Novo Nordisk's Victoza) are injectable biologicals generating revenues of more than a billion dollars each per annum. Together with insulin, we have now accepted in clinical practice other injectables to control blood glucose. In contrast, the inhibitors of DPP-4 are oral drugs: sitagliptin (Merck's Januvia) and saxagliptin (BMS's Onglyza). 93 Metformin has had a long history. First synthesized in 1920, then trialled by a French physician in 1957, it was introduced in the UK in 1958 but not until 1995 in the United States. In 2010, 48 million generic prescriptions were filled. See http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Metformin.",

Many thought that opiates could be useful in the treatment of all pain states. Neither the patients nor the anesthesiologists held this view and it is manifestly not the case. There is a very large group of pain syndromes-neuropathic pain resulting from neuronal injury and cancer pain-which are often not responsive to opiate painkillers. On top of this, opiates have huge safety problems that include constipation, alcohol interaction, and so forth, as well as their welldocumented addiction potential. Relieving pain is one of the great dreams and aspirations of mankind. Yet the introduction of new efficacious pain medications is very, very slow. The inadequacy of all pain treatments is best illustrated by the following: Most clinical trials for pain killers evaluate the efficacy of the medication using a visual analog scale. Patients judge for themselves the intensity of the pain on a linear analogue scale from \"0\" = no pain to \"10\" = excruciating pain. The gold standard of non-opiate,",

It is just that what works in all the animal models consistently fails in patients, explaining why the industry has openly stopped trying in some very notable cases. Some of the largest pharmaceutical companies, such as Roche-the most profitable pharma company today-Novartis, Astra-Zeneca, and others, have openly closed their pain research units, saying that it is too difficult. This leaves the field to small companies or to companies such as Merck and Pfizer (previously active in COX-2 inhibitors, see Chapter 03) that are mostly only interested in one type of pain, inflammatory pain, for which we already have relatively good medication, as everybody who has been given ibuprofen by the dentist knows.Pain is an example of an area of disease where the number of people affected is tremendous. The suffering is chronic. The economic opportunity therefore exists, yet the companies openly withdraw from competing in this area. This is calling for serious governmental entry into the field at the level of both basic and clinical research, which would help to define more valid, more reliable, and more translatable models, so that the existing argument of \"whatever works in animals may or may not work in humans, and we will only know it $500 million dollars and 3 years later\" will no longer be valid.
