Using monoclonal antibodies (MAb) against different TGEV-protein antigenic sites, it was shown that TGEV and PRCV have similar epitopes in the E 1 and N proteins and in the neutralization-mediating antigenic site of the E2 protein. However, the E2 antigenic sites which stimulate non-neutralizing antibodies are different. Some E2 antigenic determinants of TGEV are, therefore, modified or absent on PRCV.",

Nevertheless, differentiation is necessary for export to countries which require pigs to be free of infection with TGEV and also in research work on immunity and cross-protection. Since TGEV possesses antigenic sites in its E2 protein which are absent in PRCV, a differentiating ELISA test has been set up using one of the non-neutralizing MAb which was directed against this site in the E2 protein of TGEV. TGEV infected piglets have antibodies directed against this site which cannot be found in PRCV infected pigs. They are demonstrated by a competitive blocking ELISA (Callebaut et al., 1989 ) .",

DISCUSSION PRCV was observed to replicate in the small intestine upon inoculation by aerosol. Intestinal replication started in the ileum (Pensaert and Cox, 1989 ) . The results of the present study indicate that PRCV can also reach the intestine via the lumen of the intestinal tract and via the blood. Indeed, virus was recovered from caudal small intestine and from mesenteric lymph nodes at slightly higher titres than from lung tissue at 1 1/2 days PI upon inoculation into the ear vein. However, viral replication in the small intestine, as evidenced by IF, was only observed after inoculation into the gastrointestinal tract and not after intravenous inoculation. The intravenously inoculated piglets were already killed at 1 1/2 days PI which may have been too early to observe intestinal fluorescence. Indeed, viral antigen was demonstrated by IF in the ileum only 2 days after aerosol inoculation (Cox et al., 1990) and from 3 days after gastrointestinal inoculation.",

We have been able to isolate virus at titers of 103 and 10 4.3 from the stomach upon aerosol inoculation of piglets with TLM 83 in previously performed experiments. A sufficient amount of infectious virus appears, therefore, to be produced at the respiratory tract surface and to induce an intestinal infection if subsequently swallowed.",

After TGEV is taken up, it comes in contact with the highly susceptible villus epithelial cells of the small intestine and causes a productive infection of these cells. All villus enterocytes become infected, degenerate and desquamate within a few days (Pensaert et al., 1970) . PRCV infection, on the contrary, remains limited to a few unidentified cells, scattered over the mucosa. Small changes in molecular structure between PRCV and TGEV apparently have resulted in important changes in host cell tropism.",

Since it is unlikely that the infection spreads via the gut lumen in the opposite direction of peristalsis, another route must be used. In the present study, inoculation of PRCV in the intestinal tract could induce an intestinal infection in the absence of a respiratory infection. This seriously indicates that PRCV virus is not spreading from the ileum to the duodenum via the blood as free virus, otherwise infection of the respiratory tract would be expected to occur consistently.",

It still has to be determined if PRCV can replicate in the small intestine in piglets of this age and in the presence of maternal antibodies. Intestinal replication of PRCV could have important consequences regarding lactogenic immunity of pigs against TGEV infection if it induces anti-TGEV-IgA antibodies in the milk of sows by stimulating the gut-mammary link (Bourne et al., 1977 ) .",
