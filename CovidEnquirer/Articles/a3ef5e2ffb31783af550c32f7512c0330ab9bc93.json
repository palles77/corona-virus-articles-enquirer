Fruit bats (Pteropus spp.) are the natural reservoir (3) . Eleven bat-to-horse spillovers have now been identifi ed, with 4 resulting in horse-to-human transmission. Infection in horses typically has been characterized by acute febrile illness with rapid, progressive respiratory system compromise and high case-fatality rates (2, (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . A high case-fatality rate was again a feature of the 2008 outbreak, which we describe here: 4 of 5 infected horses died, as did 1 of 2 infected veterinary clinic staff. In contrast to previously reported cases, the clinical features of the infected animals and humans refl ected primarily central nervous system involvement.

He was euthanized on the afternoon of July 5, and a necropsy was performed (Table) . HeV was diagnosed on the basis of positive PCR results from nasal swabs and blood samples. Multiple tissues (meninges, brain, heart, and intestine) collected at necropsy were subsequently found to be positive by immunohistochemical testing. On the basis of the length of the known incubation period of HeV infection, we believe that case-patient 3 was likely housed in stall 17 at the time of exposure to infection.",

However, mild neurologic signs were noted in several horses in 1994 (4), and nonrespiratory manifestations (colic, depression) also have been observed previously (7) . Phylogenetic analyses indicate some genetic differences between the strain that caused this outbreak and previously identifi ed strains (K. Halpin, pers. comm.), but experimental infection of horses with the outbreak strain produced both respiratory and neurologic signs (D. Middleton, unpub. data). Virus dose and route of infection could plausibly infl uence clinical features; alternatively, the neurologic predominance in this outbreak may simply indicate the spectrum of possible manifestations.",

A roost of Pteropus alecto and P. poliocephalus bats, recognized reservoirs of Hendra virus (9), was located within 5 km of the practice, and bats were regularly observed in the immediate practice vicinity. The reported incubation period for HeV infection in horses is 4-16 days (1, 4) . We contend that case-patient 1 was exposed to infectious body fl uids from a foraging bat (through contamination of pas- ture, feed, water, or yard rails) and that he was the originator of this outbreak. In the 4 days before his illness and euthanasia, case-patient 1 had been treated at the clinic for a minor laceration. The clinic was the operational hub of the veterinary practice and the evident focus of transmission in this outbreak. We believe that transmission to case-patients 2-4 followed contamination of surfaces or equipment by infectious body fl uids (plausibly blood, urine, saliva, or nasal discharge) from case-patient 1 before onset of his clinical signs.",

Middleton, unpub. data) At the time, case-patients 2-4 were housed in the clinic area or were being intensively treated, with daily or twice daily visits to the clinic, which would likely have increased their probability of becoming infected. Environmental swab samples from stalls 2, 3, and 4 yielded positive results by PCR, confi rming that surfaces (walls, doors, wire mesh partitions between stalls) had been contaminated. Case-patient 5 had 3 possible sources of infection: most plausibly, case-patient 4, who had been in the adjacent stall until July 8; less plausibly, the recovered case-patient 2, who had been in stall 2 until July 18; and least plausibly, environmental contamination in stall 3 (occupied by case-patient 3 until July 5). The horse in yard 20, who had an extended opportunity for direct contact with case-patient 1, and the horses in stalls 6 and 7, who had extended opportunity for close contact with case-patients 2 and 5, respectively, did not acquire infection. These fi ndings support previous observations that unassisted horse-tohorse transmission is ineffi cient. Three other horses died at the clinic without a defi nitive diagnosis before the death of case-patient 1, but the lack of clinical samples, confl icting epidemiologic evidence, and plausible alternative reasons for death precluded their inclusion as case-patients. However, they are considered possible case-patients ( Figure 2) .",
