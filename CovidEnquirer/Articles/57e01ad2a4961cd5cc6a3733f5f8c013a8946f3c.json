Enormous amount of medical supplies as well as healthcare personals from other provinces were mobilized to support Wuhan. This current work tent to help people understanding how infectious disease spread and the purpose and consequences of various efforts based on simulation model. Method: a simulation model was created using known parameters. R0 set to 3 and mean incubation time to be 7.5days. the epidemic was divided to 3 periods. Simulation would run 50 times to mimic different patient0 status. Personal activity index was used to mimic different level of control measures. 141427709 simulated patients were created.",

In the early stage of disease, patients number would be doubled every 7. 4days.R0 was calculated to be 2.2 ( 95% CI 1.4-3.9).National Health Commission issued an order to treat 2019-ConV as a category B infectious disease, controlled as category A (same policy as SARS). On the day of 23 January 2020, Wuhan municipal government decided to lock down the city. All public transportation except emergence services between this giant south China city and the rest of China were stopped. In-city public transportation services were also on held.
