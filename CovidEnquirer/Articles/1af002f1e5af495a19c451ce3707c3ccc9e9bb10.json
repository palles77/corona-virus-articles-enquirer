The number of confirmed cases in China has reached 42,700, including 45 1,017 deaths, as of February 11, 2020 [new reference, website]. Patients initially 46 present with fever with or without respiratory symptoms, but all patients later develop 47 various degrees of pulmonary abnormalities on chest CT imaging [1, 3] . Although the vast 48 majority of patients only have a common, mild form of illness, about 15-20% of the 49 patients fall into the severe group, meaning they require assisted oxygenation as part of 50 treatment [3] . The severe group has a high mortality rate and is associated with older age, 51 underlying diseases such as diabetes, and medical procedures (such as patients who were 52 infected in a hospital setting while receiving surgery for other indications). 53 Although there have been several studies describing clinical features and 54 characteristic radiographic findings (mainly chest CT scans) [1, 3] , no pathologic studies 55 have been conducted based on autopsies or biopsies. Some of the reasons for the lack of 56 autopsies and biopsies include the suddenness of the outbreak, the vast patient volume in 57 hospitals, shortage of healthcare personnel, and the high rate of transmission, which 58 makes invasive diagnostic procedures less of a clinical priority.",

Retrospective re-examination of the images was \"suspect for 117 atypical viral pneumonia.\" He developed a fever on post-op Day 9 (38.2 C), with dry 118 cough, chest tightness, and muscle pain. A nucleic acid test for 2019-nCoV came back as 119 positive. Other labs were significant for lowered lymphocyte count. He was re-admitted 120 to the Infectious Disease ward.

For CASE 1, the surgery was performed six days after the CT 154 findings of early GGO signs, meaning the pathologic changes of the non-tumor lung 155 parenchyma indeed represent at least the peripheral part of COVID-19 pneumonia, as the 156 imaging changes were more prominent towards the lower lobes.

This may be a good clue for early diagnosis in the future. CASE 2 developed 179 a fever a few days after the CT findings, suggesting a delay in symptom development in180 these patients. During the earlier days of the outbreak, there had been limitations in both 181 capacity and turnaround time for the nucleic acid test, which had further caused delay in 182 confirming the diagnosis of COVID-19 [4] in many patients. It seems that the time for the 183 early lung lesions or COVID-19 to become severe enough to cause clinical symptoms is 184 rather long. Even among patients with fevers, the commonly used pharyngeal swab PCR 185 test may be negative, due to the lack of viruses in the upper respiratory tract despite the 186 presence of pneumonia. However, radiographic changes can occur early (chest CT scan is 187 mostly employed in China during the current outbreak). Therefore, during an epidemic 188 season, it is prudent to carefully evaluate any lung infiltration for the ground glass opacity, 189 and an appropriate serology test be used to rule out potential infection 4 . 190 These two incidences also typify a common scenario during the earlier phase of 191 the SARS-CoV-2 outbreak, during which a significant number of healthcare providers 192 became infected in hospitals in Wuhan, and patients in the same room were cross-infected, 193 as they were exposed to unknown transmission sources. Because of this, it is important 194 10 to practice \"universal precaution\" in surgical pathology laboratories and regard all fresh 195 specimens as potentially infectious. In China most surgical specimens are received 196 already fixed in formalin. However, for larger specimens the center of a specimen may 197 not be sufficiently fixed and still pose potential risk for infection. Therefore, proper 198 PPE with surgical masks or N95 respirators are worn all the time in the gross room. 199 Fortunately thus far to our knowledge, no cases of pathologists being infected by 200 COVID-19 had occurred. 201 202 It would be beneficial if RT-PCR and/or immunohistochemical stains could be 203 performed on these two cases to further confirm the presence of the viruses that may be 204 associated with the pneumonia. Unfortunately, these tests are currently under 205 development, and adaptation to tissue specimens is not yet available. Nevertheless, we 206 believe it is imperative to report the findings of routine histopathology for better 207 understanding of the mechanism by which the SARS-CoV-2 causes lung injury in the 208 unfortunate tens and thousands of patients in Wuhan and worldwide.
