In 2002, Thailand began active, population-based surveillance for radiographically confirmed pneumonia in Sa Kaeo Province. Methods: Full-time surveillance officers conducted active case ascertainment at every hospital, and routine audits and a community cluster survey promoted complete and accurate reporting. A case of pneumonia was defined as acute infection with signs or symptoms of lower respiratory tract infection and evidence of new infiltrates. An independent panel of radiologists reviewed digital images of all radiographs. Results: Between September 2002 and August 2003, 777 patients met the case definition. The measured minimum incidence was 177/100 000 but the estimated incidence was as high as 580/ 100 000 with full adjustment for incomplete chest radiography and access to health care. Seventy-two (9%) patients died and 28% were known to be HIV positive. Fifteen (2%) patients had pneumonia twice during the year. The average cost of hospitalization for an episode of pneumonia ranged from US$490.80 to $628.60. Conclusions: Pneumonia is a significant and costly public health problem in Thailand. This surveillance system allows precise assessment and monitoring of radiologically confirmed pneumonia and lays the groundwork for the introduction of new vaccines against pneumonia pathogens.

Population-based surveillance coupled with comprehensive laboratory diagnostics are also needed to identify the burden of pathogen-specific causes of pneumonia. In many parts of the world, the great human and financial costs associated with such a surveillance system preclude its consideration.",

Despite the availability of new vaccines in some wealthy countries, pneumonia remains the leading infectious killer among children in much of the world, and the approaches to treatment and prevention have changed little since the 1980s. Beginning in 1981, the World Health Organization promoted a simple clinical management approach for children that consisted of counting respiratory rate and checking for chest indrawing before administering antimicrobial therapy. 4 A number of important changes have occurred since then, including the development of vaccines to prevent some infectious causes of pneumonia, including Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae type b, and influenza virus, discovery of new pathogens, such as hantavirus, metapneumovirus, and SARS coronavirus, and new treatment approaches, such as short-course ampicillin. These changes in the understanding, treatment, and prevention of pneumonia have not resulted in a new global agenda for controlling pneumonia, perhaps in part because the burden in the most affected parts of the world is so ill-defined. There is a need for better surveillance for vaccine-preventable pneumonia pathogens and improved methods of pathogen detection to guide a reinvigorated global program to prevent and control pneumonia.",

            "text": "These new opportunities demand renewed effort. Although pneumonia is a reportable disease in many countries, what is being reported is often not clear. Methods often include passive surveillance, non-standardized case definitions relying on clinical diagnosis, lack of radiographic confirmation, and lack of laboratory identification of pathogens, limiting the value of the data for use in guiding prevention and control programs. 5 In 2002, Thailand launched active, populationbased surveillance for radiographically confirmed pneumonia as part of the International Emerging Infections Program (IEIP), a novel collaboration between the U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the Thai Ministry of Public Health. 6 Material and methods Population Sa Kaeo is a rural province located about 200 kilometers east of Bangkok on the border with Cambodia. In 2002, the average monthly household income was 9951 Baht (US$248.78) and the population is largely agrarian. 7 The population of Sa Kaeo, 438 557, was defined as the surveillance area. There is one provincial hospital, six community hospitals, and one military hospital. Since 1975, pneumonia surveillance has been a core function of the Thai Ministry of Public Health and as such has been determined not to require review by ethical committees or institutional review boards. In September 2002, the pneumonia surveillance system in Sa Kaeo was modified to include active case ascertainment at all eight hospitals in the province. There are no private or other acute care hospitals in the province, and therefore these hospitals capture essentially all of the acute care admissions for the population under surveillance. All hospitals are equipped with at least basic laboratory facilities and staffed by one or more university-trained laboratory technicians. Although routine microscopy, chemistry, hematology, and serologic testing are available, equipment and materials to conduct bacteriological testing is lacking or limited. There is universal health care and patients pay 30 Baht (US$0.75) per visit, but this fee is much less than the cost of a hospital stay.",

Two primary readers interpreted the radiographs and a third served to resolve discrepancies. The radiologists used the WHO standard criteria for the interpretation of chest radiographs for diagnosing pneumonia in children. 10 In addition, a pilot study of 100 images was conducted so that all three readers could compare and standardize interpretations. Once the readings were completed data were merged with the surveillance database for analysis. A complete evaluation of digital compared to hard copy chest radiograph interpretations in this population has recently been published. 9 Quality control/quality assessment The surveillance coordinator and staff conducted data reviews at weekly staff and monthly provincial working group meetings. In addition, to ensure that all cases of diseases under surveillance were identified and reported, the Bureau of Epidemiology performed a complete and standardized data audit annually. The primary data source at every reporting site, the inpatient logbooks, was compared to the list of cases reported electronically for a one-month period to ascertain completeness of reporting. In addition, to evaluate coverage of the screening criteria, discharge data were reviewed to identify additional pneumonia patients and charts were reviewed to determine whether they met the case definition. Finally, the timing of all chest radiographs was monitored for the proportion that had a radiograph obtained within 48 hours, the criterion for inclusion.",

Proportions were compared and we report Fisher's exact 2-tailed p values; p < 0.05 was considered significant. To compare risk factors we computed relative risks (RR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI). Census data from the Sa Kaeo (2001) Provincial Health Offices were used to calculate the minimal incidence of pneumonia. To calculate the maximum incidence, rates were adjusted separately for each age category to account for incomplete chest radiography and health-seeking behavior using data from the community survey. 11 Specifically, in each age-group we multiplied the frequency of radiographically confirmed pneumonia by the total number of persons with clinical pneumonia and divided the result by the proportion that sought care. This number was then divided by the population to get an upper limit of the incidence. Data on routine service and ancillary costs associated with pneumonia hospitalization were collected in Sa Kaeo as part of another study. 13 Persons who had a chest radiograph were also significantly more likely to die than those who did not (8% vs. 2%, RR = 5.1, 95% CI = 3.3-8.0). There was no difference in the proportion who were male (55% vs. 58%, RR = 0.9, 95% CI = 0.7-1.0). Of the 1064 who had a chest radiograph, 777 (73%) had radiographically confirmed pneumonia as assessed by the radiology panel. A comparison of the clinical presentation and outcome of these groups is presented in Table 1 . Patients who had a chest radiograph closely resemble those with radiographically confirmed pneumonia. For the rest of the paper, we will describe the 777 episodes (in 754 persons) of radiographically confirmed pneumonia. The incidence of radiographically confirmed pneumonia by age is shown in Figure 1 . The minimal incidence, 177 per 100 000 per year, is the incidence based on the 777 confirmed cases and the maximum incidence, 580 per 100 000 per year, is the incidence after adjusting for incomplete chest radiography and access to health care (see community survey section below). Slightly more than half of the pneumonia cases (424, 55%) were in men. There were six cases of pneumonia in neonates (age <1 month). Signs and symptoms at admission are reported in Table 1 . The median length of hospital stay was 5 days (range 1-64); it was highest, at 7 days, in persons aged 30-34. The number of pneumonia cases appeared to peak twice during the year, once in January through March and then again in July through October (Figure 2 ).",

Additional efforts, such as enhancing diagnostic services to include culture and sensitivity to more appropriately guide treatment, are needed to adequately address the substantial problem of tuberculosis in Thailand. In addition, HIV testing and counseling should be offered to all pneumonia patients, as the prevalence is likely higher than the 4% identified in this study.
