Analysis of the molecular characteristics revealed that BoIFN-\u03c93 evolving from IFN-\u03c9, contained four cysteine residues and five alpha helices, showing that BoIFN-\u03c93 presented the typical molecular characteristics of type I interferon. BoIFN-\u03c93 exhibited antiviral and antiproliferative activities, which exerted a protective effect against VSV in several mammalian cell lines, as well as against BEV, IBRV, and BVDV in MDBK cell. Moreover, BoIFN-\u03c93 was shown to be highly sensitive to trypsin, but remaining stable despite changes in pH and temperature. Additionally, BoIFN-\u03c93 induced the transcription of Mx1, ISG15, and ISG56 genes, as well as the expression of Mx1 protein in a time-dependent manner. These findings will be useful to further study BoIFN-\u03c9 in host's defence against infectious diseases, particularly viral infections. Furthermore, results will facilitate further research on the bovine interferon family.",

            "text": "Interferons (IFNs), which are produced in response to viral infections, contribute to host defence by establishing an antiviral state in target cells wherein viral replication is blocked or impaired as a result of the synthesis of a number of enzymes interfering with cellular and viral processes (Staeheli, 1990; Sen, 2001) . Type I IFNs are a family of cytokines with pleiotropic activities including inhibition of viral replication and cell proliferation, as well as activation of the immune system (Stark et al., 1998) . Their administration has been proposed as an immunomodulatory therapy (Domenech et al., 2011) to treat several viral and immunomediated diseases. Type I IFNs, including IFN-\u03b1, IFN\u03b2, IFN-\u03c9, IFN-\u03b4, IFN-\u03c4, IFN-\u03b5, IFN-\u03bd, and IFN-\u03ba, are produced by virus-infected cells and exert nonspecific antiviral activities on adjacent non-infected cells (Krause and Pestka, 2005) . They display a general mechanism of action based on their interaction with specific cell-surface receptors and the subsequent induction of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs) expression, thereby encoding direct antiviral effectors or molecules with the potential to positively and negatively regulate IFN signaling and other host responses, including enzymes, signaling proteins, chemokines, antigen-presenting proteins, transcription factors, and apoptotic proteins (Der et al., 1998) . Overall, a number of ISGs that act to enhance pathogen detection and innate immune signaling (Schneider et al., 2014) , such as ISG15, ISG56, and GTPase Mx1, have been shown to function as antiviral effectors. The Mx1 gene product, which is one of the first described inhibitors of virus entry, is broadly inhibitory and acts prior to genome replication at an early postentry step of the virus life cycle (Schneider et al., 2014) . ISG15 demonstrates numerous antiviral functions, including inhibition of virus release, lysis of both viral and host proteins, and immunomodulatory cytokine-like properties in its unconjugated form (Schoggins, 2014) . ISG56, which is induced in response to type I IFNs, dsRNAs, and viruses (Terenzi et al., 2006) , has been implicated in antiviral actions of IFNs against West Nile virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (Wacher et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "IFN-\u03c9, which was first discovered by Hauptmann and Swetly (Hauptmann and Swetly, 1985) , is a type I IFN secreted by virus-infected leukocytes, that are encoded by multiple IFN-or IFN-like genes present across mammalian groups, including cats, porcine and rabbit (Hauptmann and Swetly, 1985; Roberts et al., 1998; Charlier et al., 1993a; Mege et al., 1991) . Like other type I IFNs, IFN-\u03c9 presents species-restricted biological activity in vitro and can bind to the same type I IFN receptor complex as other type I IFNs, thus exerting similar antiviral, antiproliferative, and immunomodulatory effects (Adolf, 1995) . However, its antigenic structure is distantly related to IFN-\u03b1, -\u03b2, and -\u03b3, as it does not cross react with antibodies against them (Adolf, 1995) . Interferon-\u03c9 has been used for antiviral treatment in humans and many other mammalian species (Tiefenthaler et al., 1997; Hagelstein et al., 1998; Gil et al., 2014; Leal et al., 2014; Martin et al., 2002) . Although human IFN-\u03c9 (HuIFN-\u03c9) can exert in vivo antitumor effects in several models of human cancer (Horton et al., 1999) , Feline IFN-\u03c9 (FeIFN-\u03c9) shows a proven antiviral effect, both in vitro (Mochizuki et al., 1994; Ohe et al., 2008; Litzlbauer et al., 2014) and in vivo Leal et al., 2014; Martin et al., 2002; Horton et al., 1999; Mochizuki et al., 1994; Ohe et al., 2008; Litzlbauer et al., 2014) , against canine and feline parvovirus, herpesvirus, calicivirus, coronavirus, and rotavirus, and has been licensed for use in veterinary medicine (Virbagen\u00ae, Virbac) in Europe, Japan, Australia, New Zealand and Mexico (Domenech et al., 2011) . Research on BoIFN-\u03c9 subtypes was not much reported, in 1998, BoIFN-\u03c91 was reported to have biological activation, and can sufficiently prevent luteolysis, without being deleterious to embryonic survival (Rodriguez et al., 1998a) ; in 2015, BoIFN-\u03c924 has been characterized and can be used as a candidate antiviral therapeutic reagent (Luo et al., 2015) . The newfound BoIFN-\u03c93, which presents a potential as a novel antiviral therapeutic agent, exerts antiviral activity against VSV in several mammalian cell lines and a protective effect against bovine virus that including BEV, IBRV and BVDV. In this study, we present a novel type I IFN named BoIFN-\u03c93 on the basis of the location in the bovine genome. BoIFN-\u03c93 demonstrates typical characteristics of type I IFN, exerts antiviral activity in several mammalian cell lines, and displays low cytotoxicity in vitro. Additionally, BoIFN-\u03c93 can induce the transcription of Mx1, ISG15, and ISG56 genes, as well as the expression of Mx1 protein in a time-dependent manner. The current findings will be useful to further study BoIFN-\u03c9 in host's defence against infectious diseases, particularly viral infections, and should facilitate research on the bovine interferon family.",

Phylogenetic analysis revealed that BoIFN-\u03c93 was closely related to BoIFN-\u03c924 and sheep IFN-\u03c9, suggesting that the IFN-\u03c9 gene may have originated from gene duplication in a common ancestor during evolution. Cys-1, Cys-99, Cys-29 and Cys-139 of mature BoIFN-\u03c93 formed two disulfide bonds crucial for its activity, which is conserved in some type I IFNs (Wetzel, 1981) .",

The results indicated that BoIFN-\u03c93 exerted a considerable antiviral activity against VSV infection in MDBK, BL, BT, BHK21, F81, RK-13, and PK-15 cells, but not in MDCK cells, whereas BoIFN-\u03b1A, BoIFN-\u03b5, and BoIFN-\u03c924 demonstrated no antiviral activity against VSV infection in BHK-21 cells (Sambrook and Green, 2012; Bracklein et al., 2006) . BoIFN-\u03c93 also exerted a protective effect against BEV, IBRV, and BVDV in MDBK cells. Similar to BoIFN-\u03c924, BoIFN-\u03c93 displayed low cytotoxicity in MDBK cells. In addition, BoIFN-\u03c93 was verified to be highly sensitive to trypsin, insensitive to temperature, and stable at pH 2. Given the substantial antiviral activity and low cytotoxicity of BoIFN-\u03c93, it is a potential candidate for a novel, effective therapeutic agent.",

Many ISGs control viral, bacterial, and parasitic infections by directly targeting pathways and functions required during pathogen life cycles (Lehner et al., 2008) . BoIFN-\u03c93 can induce the time-dependent transcription of ISGs (including Mx-1, ISG15 and ISG56). The transcription of Mx-1 increased 3 h after BoIFN-\u03c93 treatment, and peaked 24 h thereafter. This event was consistent with the expression of Mx-1 protein. The transcription of ISG15 and ISG56 showed a trend similar to that of Mx-1. Given that ISGs were downstream in the IFN signaling pathways, BoIFN-\u03c93 can obviously induce ISGs expression in a time-dependent manner, suggesting that BoIFN-\u03c93 can further inhibit viral replication and exert antiviral activity.",
