Roem. leaves a b s t r a c t Ethnopharmacological relevance: Leaves of Toona sinensis (A. Juss.) Roem. (TSL), a popular vegetable in China, have anti-inflammatory, antidoting, and worm-killing effects and are used in folk medicine for the treatment of enteritis, dysentery, carbuncles, boils, and especially abdominal tumors. Our aim was to investigate the in vitro antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and anticancer property of the essential oil from TSL (TSL-EO), especially the pro-apoptotic effect in SGC-7901. Materials and methods: TSL-EO obtained by hydrodistillation was analyzed by GC/MS and was tested in vitro against twenty clinically isolated strains of Staphylococcus aureus (SA 1-20), which were either methicillin-sensitive Staphylococcus aureus (MSSA) or methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and two standard strains viz. ATCC 25923 and ATCC 43300. The anticancer activity of TSL-EO was evaluated in vitro against HepG2, SGC7901, and HT29 through MTT assay. Moreover, the apoptosisinducing activity of TSL-EO in SGC7901 cells was determined by Hoechst 33324 staining and flow cytometry methods. Also, the apoptosis-related proteins viz. Bax, Bcl-2 and caspase-3 were detected by western-blotting. Results: GC-MS analysis showed that TSL-EO contained a high amount of sesquiterpenes (84.64%), including copaene (8.27%), \u03b2-caryophyllene (10.16%), caryophyllene (13.18%) and \u03b2-eudesmene (5.06%). TSL-EO inhibited the growth of both MSSA and MRSA, with the lowest MIC values of 0.125 and 1 mg/ml, respectively. Treatment with TSL-EO for 24 h could significantly suppress the viability of three different cancer cell lines (P o0.05). Furthermore, the apoptosis-inducing activity of TSL-EO in SGC7901 cells increased in a dose-dependent manner, potentially resulting from the up-regulated expression of Bax, caspase-3 and down-regulated expression of Bcl-2. Conclusions: TSL-EO possessed antibacterial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and significant cytotoxicity against cancer cells and particularly prominent pro-apoptotic activity in SGC7901 cells. These bioactivities were probably due to the high content of sesquiterpenes. Our results suggested that TSL-EO possessed potential health benefits and could serve as a promising natural food addictive.",

The tender leaves of Toona sinensis (TSL) are used as a nutritious vegetable and flavoring of food products in China. And they possess antiinflammatory, antidoting, and worm-killing effects and are used in folk medicine for the treatment of enteritis, dysentery, carbuncles, boils, dermatitis, scabies, tinea blanca (Chang et al., 2006) , and especially abdominal tumors (Chang et al., 2002) . Currently, pharmacognostic and phytochemical studies have shown the presence of several types of phytochemicals in this plant, including flavonoids, limonoids, phytols and coumarins in this plant (Cheng et al., 2009) . It has also been reported that TSL possesses a wide range of biological/pharmacological activities such as anti-cancer (Chang et al., 2002 (Chang et al., , 2006 Chen et al., 2009; Chia et al., 2010; , anti-inflammation (Hseu et al., 2011) , anti-diabetes (Hsieh et al., 2012) and antioxidant activities (Hseu et al., 2008) ; it also inhibits leydig cell steroidogenesis (Poon et al., 2005) and SARS coronavirus replication . However, these studies mainly focus on the high or mid-high polar extracts of TSL. Recently, the volatile compounds of TSL obtained through microwave-assisted extraction and headspace solid-phase microextraction have been determined by Mu et al. (2007) . Additionally, the non-polar TSL extract prepared by supercritical-CO 2 fluid has been shown to prevent the progression of diabetes and hepatosteatosis (Hsieh et al., 2012) . Although the chemical composition and DPPH scavenging activity of TSL-EO, separated by simultaneous distillation solvent extraction, was studied by Chen et al. (2013) , little is still known about the bioactivities of TSL-EO such as antibacterial and anticancer activities.",

The flow rate of the carrier gas (helium) was 1.0 ml/min. TSL-EO was dissolved in diethyl ether, a sample of 1.0 \u03bcl was injected using split mode (split ratio, 5:1). The ionizing energy was 70 eV. Electron multiplier voltage was obtained from autotune. All data were obtained by collecting the full-scan mass spectra within the scan range of 40 to 650 amu. The composition was reported as a relative percentage of the total peak area. The identification of the essential oil constituents was based on a comparison of their retention times to n-alkanes (C8-C40). Compounds were further identified and authenticated using their mass spectra compared to data in the NIST Standard Reference Database. ",

The percentage of cells undergoing apoptosis following treatment with 0, 50, 100 and 200 \u03bcg/ml of TSL-EO for 12 h (including the early and late apoptotic cells) was 4.84, 7.75, 13.94 and 45.79%, respectively (Fig. 3B) . Therefore, it was concluded that TSL-EO promoted SGC7901 cell apoptosis in a dose-dependent manner.",

And TSL-EO separated by Chen et al. was also found to be rich in sesquiterpenes. However, there were significant differences in certain components in Mu et al.'s study. For example, 2-Hexenal and 5-Ethyl thiazole were detected as the major constituents, representing 14.678% and 11.806% of the total volatile compound, respectively, but they were not detected in our work. These differences were probably due to differences in the original material, extraction process and detection conditions.",

Staphylococcus aureus, representative of the important pathogenic bacteria, plays a crucial role in the cause of food contamination by producing toxin, thus resulting in increased number of cases of food poisoning or food-borne illness in many countries (Scott, 2003) . In order to control food-borne pathogenic bacteria, natural antimicrobial substances such as EOs are proposed to be applied in view of their relative safety (Bajpai et al., 2013) . Our previous study was performed to determine the antibacterial activity of TSL-EO against a number of Staphylococcus aureus strains, including two standard strains viz. ATCC 25923 and ATCC 43300, and 20 clinically isolated strains (SA 1-20). As shown in Table 2 , the results indicate that TSL-EO could inhibit the growth of both MSSA and MRSA. According to the result of the MIC test, the growth inhibitory effects of TSL-EO were further demonstrated by dynamic bacterial growth assay ( Fig. 1A and B) , it was suggested that MSSA were more sensitive than MRSA to both TSL-EO and OXA. It was reported that terpenes such as monoterpene, sesquiterpene hydrocarbons and their oxygenated derivatives were the major cause of antibacterial action of the essential oils, the mechanism of which was presumed to involve membrane disruption (Cowan, 1999) . Thus, the antibacterial activity of TSL-EO was probably due to the presence of the high content of sesquiterpenes, such as \u03b2-caryophyllene (Azaz et al., 2002) and caryophyllene oxide (Magiatis et al., 2002) .",

            "text": "Accumulated evidence has shown that uncontrolled cell proliferation and insufficient apoptosis would eventually result in a net increase in the number of cancer cells, and thus are strongly associated with the development and progression of cancer (Mattern and Volm, 2004) . Herein, inhibition of cell proliferation and/or induction of apoptosis in cancer cells to remove cells generated in excess are considered an effective means to fight cancer. To date, a number of anti-cancer agents, such as taxol, etoposide and ceramide, have been demonstrated to exert therapeutic effects by inducing or promoting apoptosis (Boldt et al., 2002) . Apoptosis, which means programmed cell death, is a physiological process characterized by typical morphological and biochemical hallmarks, including cell shrinkage, nuclear DNA fragmentation and membrane blebbing (Fulda and Debatin, 2006) . The mitochondrial pathway is documented as the most important apoptotic mechanism involving release of mitochondrial cytochrome-C, activation of caspase-9 and in turn caspase-3, and eventually causing apoptotic cell death (Lavrik et al., 2005) . Caspase-3, one of the key protagonists of apoptosis, has been shown to partially/ completely account for the proteolytic cleavage of many key proteins (Kim et al., 2012) . Bcl-2 family proteins, including Bax and Bcl-2, play a pivotal role in the induction of caspase-3 activation and regulation of apoptosis (Zhong et al., 2011) . A higher Bcl-2/Bax ration due to the over-expression of anti-apoptotic proteins such as Bcl-2 and/or the down-regulation or mutation of pro-apoptotic proteins such as Bax confers a survival advantage and resistance to apoptosis to cancer cells (Cai et al., 2012) .With the purpose of examining the anticancer activity of TSL-EO, three cancer cell lines, namely HepG2, SGC7901 and HT29, were used in our study. As seen in Fig. 2A , the viability of all three cancer cell lines was markedly suppressed (Po0.05), among them SGC7901 was found to be the most susceptible, with an IC 50 value of 70.38 \u03bcg/ml for 24 h. Intriguingly, TSL-EO at a concentration of not more than 100 \u03bcg/ml did not present significant cytotoxicity against HUVECs (Fig. 2B ). Based on above results, SGC7901 cells, the most sensitive cell lines, were used to confirm whether the cytotoxicity was attributable to apoptosis. Thus, a qualitative and quantitative evaluation of apoptosis was performed using Hoechst 33324 staining and flow cytometry technique, respectively, the mechanisms of both are based on the differential uptake of fluorescent dyes (Wijesinghe et al., 2013) . Our results showed that treatment of SGC7901 cells with TSL-EO resulted in the appearance of the characteristic features of apoptosis, such as nuclear condensation and apoptotic body formation (Fig. 3A) . The percentage of apoptotic cells in the experimental groups increased compared with the control group in a dosedependent manner (Fig. 3B) . Moreover, the apoptosis-inducing activity of TSL-EO was mediated through caspase-3 pathway by upregulation of Bax, caspase-3, and down-regulation of Bcl-2 (Fig. 4) . Recently, it was reported that sesquiterpenes such as caryophyllene and \u03b1-caryophyllene were shown to exhibit antiproliferative activity against cancer cells, whereas monoterpenes such as \u03b2-pinene, \u03b3-terpinene and p-cymene were interestingly inactive. Furthermore, EO with the higher content of sesquiterpene hydrocarbons was documented to possess stronger antiproliferative activity against M14 human melanoma cells (Cardile et al., 2009) . Therefore, it was suggested that the high concentration of sesquiterpenes was probably responsible for the significant anticancer activity of TSL-EO.",
