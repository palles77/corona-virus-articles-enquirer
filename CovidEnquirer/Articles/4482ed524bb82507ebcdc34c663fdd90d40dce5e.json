The first step in the production process is virus inactivation with bpropiolactone (BPL) or formaldehyde (FA). Recommendations for production of inactivated vaccines merely define the maximal concentration for both reagents, leaving the optimization of the process to the manufacturers. We assessed the effect of inactivation with BPL and FA on 5 different influenza virus strains. The properties of the viral formulation, such as successful inactivation, preservation of hemagglutinin (HA) binding ability, fusion capacity and the potential to stimulate a Toll-like receptor 7 (TLR7) reporter cell line were then assessed and compared to the properties of the untreated virus. Inactivation with BPL resulted in undetectable infectivity levels, while FA-treated virus retained very low infectious titers. Hemagglutination and fusion ability were highly affected by those treatments that conferred higher inactivation, with BPL-treated virus binding and fusing at a lower degree compared to FA-inactivated samples. On the other hand, BPL-inactivated virus induced higher levels of activation of TLR7 than FA-inactivated virus. The alterations caused by BPL or FA treatments were virus strain dependent. This data shows that the inactivation procedures should be tailored on the virus strain, and that many other elements beside the concentration of the inactivating agent, such as incubation time and temperature, buffer and virus concentration, have to be defined to achieve a functional product.",

Live virus vaccines rely on attenuation; e.g. use of reassortant strains with the backbone of cold-adapted viruses, but equal (or comparable) immunogenicity. For all the other types of vaccines derived from whole viral particles, a crucial step in production is virus inactivation. The general concept behind the inactivation procedure, stated by international guidelines as provided by EMA, FDA, and WHO [4] [5] [6] , is that the process must inhibit the replication of the virus without destroying its antigenicity. Thus, the inactivation process should cause minimum alteration of the main antigens, which for influenza virus are the viral surface glycoproteins hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA).",

BPL reacts readily with nucleophiles, resulting in alkylated and acylated products. According to older literature, nucleic acids are the main targets of these modifications, which comprise nicks and cross-links between RNA and viral proteins [7, 8] . However, recent findings shed new light on the mechanism of BPL inactivation and show that it also alters viral proteins, resulting in loss of HA and NA functionality and fusion ability [9] . The stability of BPL is known to depend on the type of buffer and the pH of the mixture used, suggesting that the amount and nature of modifications in viral components will also be determined by these variables [10] . In the case of formaldehyde, viral inactivation is achieved by the alkylation of amino and sulphydrilic groups of proteins and purine bases [11] . As FA crosslinks the viral proteins [12] , the fusion ability of the virus can be affected.",

Specifications provided for the inactivation procedure include indications on the temperature of storage and the maximum amount of inactivating agents. Nonetheless, the choice of variables such as the concentration of the virus at the time of inactivation, the buffer systems used to dilute the inactivators, the pH of the virus suspension, or the duration of the incubation with the agents remains yet unspecified.

All seed viruses were obtained from the National Institute for Biological Standards and Controls, Potters Bar, United Kingdom and were propagated in 10 days old embryonated eggs. After inoculation of the virus and incubation for 72 h, the allantoic fluid was harvested and clarified by low speed centrifugation, followed by two rounds of purifications of the virus on a sucrose gradient [18] . Protein and phospholipid determinations were performed on the purified virus using the Micro Lowry and the Bligh and Dyer method, respectively [19, 20] . All virus preparations were used at a concentration of 0.5 nmol/ml of phospholipid for inactivation. The number of virus particles was calculated assuming that each virion contained about 100,000 phospholipid molecules. This number was derived using the reported composition (20-24% lipid) and dry weight (6 \u00c2 10 \u00c016 g) of influenza virions and a mean MW for lipids of 720-750 g/mol [21] . This calculation does not take into account a possible contamination of the virus preparations with exosomes which would also be assumed to contain lipids and would presumably co-purify with virus on the sucrose gradient. However, the amount of exosomes is not expected to vary among the virus strains and is therefore neglected here.",

Our results show that, under the conditions used, BPL was quite efficient in inactivating the viral particles while formaldehyde, although reducing the infectious titer by 6-9 logs, was unable to completely abolish infectivity. All inactivation methods caused damage to the binding capacity of the viral particles, with BPL causing greater loss than FA. The ability of the virus to fuse with target membranes at low pH was especially affected by BPL treatment, while FA-treated virus still maintained some fusion ability. The stimulation of a TLR7 reporter cell line was also affected by the treatment, with FA inactivation leading to a greater loss of the ability to stimulate TLR7 than BPL inactivation. The magnitude of the effects caused by BPL or FA treatment appeared to be virus strain dependent, as different IAV strains were affected to varying degrees. From our results, it is clear that chem-ical inactivation impacts on various properties of influenza virus in a treatment dependent and strain dependent way.",

Again, there seem to be strainspecific differences in the sensitivity to FA since some strains were more effectively inactivated than others and for some strains (PR8, H5) inactivation improved with longer exposure times to FA while for other strains this was not the case. A variety of different methods for FA inactivation has been described in the literature [7, 23, 25, [30] [31] [32] [33] . These methods vary with respect to the exact experimental conditions used, including concentration and incubation time. In some cases, incomplete inactivation is reported, mostly occurring when the inactivation was performed at low temperature [34] , as was done in this study.",

To determine the effects of the different inactivation protocols on the recognition of the virus by HAspecific antibodies, we tried to perform a single radial diffusion (SRID) assay on the virus samples before and after the inactivation procedure. However, the relatively low concentration of virus used for inactivation (chosen to allow optimal access of the inactivating agent to the viral proteins) was not suitable to render reliable readings.

Fusion ability was measured by incubation of viral or vaccine particles (1 nmol of total phospholipids) with either guinea pig RBC (A-C) or chicken RBC (D-E) followed by the addition of fusion buffer to reach the desired pH. After 30 min incubation, samples were centrifuged and the supernatants were collected. Samples were read at 520 nm on a spectrophotometer.

We therefore investigated the effects of the different inactivation protocols on hemagglutination and on hemolysis as surrogates for binding and fusion, respectively. As all our observations are based on in vitro tests, the correlation with the different vaccine potencies in vivo should be explored in future experiments. The use of single radial immunodiffusion assay as an estimate for protection has been shown to correlate both with in vivo responses [35] and, more recently, with in vitro results of differently manufactured influenza vaccine [36] . However, while the SRID assay would have been an alternative method to measure HA integrity, it would have given information on antibody binding only.",

Previous reports have shown that H1N1 and H3N2 viruses had reduced agglutination capacity following BPL treatments [7, 9, 15, 17, 37] -although in many cases the inactivation was performed at different temperatures, incubation times or concentrations than used in our experiments.

The higher immunogenicity of WIV could be largely attributed to activation of TLR7 by ssRNA present in the viral particles [38] . Furthermore, since the stimulation of an endosomal Toll-like receptor depends on viral endocytosis (and thus on HA functionality) [39] , the decreased stimulation of such a receptor can indicate possible modifications of the surface antigen induced by the inactivation procedure. We therefore investigated the effect of the different inactivation methods on TLR7 triggering. All inactivation procedures studied markedly reduced and often completely abolished TLR7 triggering, with effects of BPL inactivation being somewhat less severe than those of FA treatment. This was surprising considering that BPL is supposed to mainly affect nucleic acids while FA is supposed to mainly affect proteins [11] . Loss of TLR7 triggering did not necessarily correlate with loss of binding and was thus not only a result of less virus reaching the endosomal compartment. To our knowledge, the effect of virus inactivation on the capability of WIV to trigger TLR7 has not been studied previously. Earlier studies demonstrating that WIV is capable of activating TLR7 were per-formed using much higher concentrations of virus (10 mg/ml viral protein as compared to about 0.03 mg/ml used in this study) [25] . In these studies, effects of the inactivation procedure might therefore have been obscured.",

Though all the studies were in compliance with the established guidelines with respect to BPL concentration ( 0.1%), all used different conditions with respect to buffer, virus concentration, incubation time and temperature etc. This might explain variations in outcome among the different studies. One of the initial effects of BPL addition is a decrease in pH caused by hydrolysis of BPL to b-propionic acid and hydracrylic acid derivatives [25] ; this could then lead to all the other observed undesirable consequences of BPL treatment on HA and NA functions.

It has also been shown that temperature is an important factor in virus inactivation by formaldehyde: Darnell ME et al. [45] reported that SARS-coronavirus could not be inactivated at a low temperature of 4\u00b0C even after 3 days of incubation. However, when using a higher temperature of 25 or 37\u00b0C, formaldehyde could inactivate most of the virus after 1 day.",

Novel inactivation protocols, such as UV and gamma radiation [46] or the use of hydrogen peroxide [13] , have already been mentioned in the literature but will need thorough testing and standardization before they can be employed in the context of influenza vaccine production. There are currently new emerging technologies to manufacture influenza vaccines that would not require an inactivation process, such as production of IAV proteins on in vitro cultures or peptides derived from IAV proteins, all showing promising results; yet, egg cultures are currently the cheapest and most efficient way to produce high amounts of vaccines in a relative short amount of time. Therefore, until a new vaccine production method that can compete with the egg culture is developed, inactivation will be a standard procedure in vaccine manufacturing. Our results are therefore a call for establishment of more detailed inactivation procedures for vaccine manufacturers, and for a search for different and more efficient inactivation methods to be included in the international guidelines.",
