The soluble form of DPP4 (sDPP4) circulates systematically and can competitively inhibit MERS-CoV entry into host cells. Here, we measured the concentration of sDPP4 in the plasma and sputa of 14 MERS-CoV-infected patients of various degrees of disease severity. The concentration of sDPP4 in the plasma of MERS patients (474.76 \u00b1 108.06 ng/ml) was significantly lower than those of healthy controls (703.42 \u00b1 169.96 ng/ml), but there were no significant differences among the patient groups. Interestingly, plasma levels of IL-10 and EGF were negatively and positively correlated with sDPP4 concentrations, respectively. The sDPP4 levels in sputa were less than 300 ng/ml. Viral infection was inhibited by 50% in the presence of more than 8000 ng/ml of sDPP4. Therefore, sDPP4 levels in the plasma of MERS patients are significantly reduced below the threshold needed to exert an antiviral effect against MERS-CoV infection.",

The sDPP4 level in plasma varies depending on pathophysiological conditions such as the presence of metabolic disease or inflammation (Lambeir et al., 2003; Rohrborn et al., 2015) . sDPP4 level and enzyme activity are also affected by viral infections including hepatitis C virus and Epstein-Barr virus (Andrieu et al., 2003) .

The percent inhibition of viral entry by 250 and 1000 ng/ml of sDPP4 was approximately 14% and 24%, respectively ( Fig. 2A) . A concentration higher than 8000 ng/ml of sDPP4 is required to achieve 50% inhibition of pseudotyped lentivirus infection, indicating that physiological levels of plasma sDPP4 observed in MERS patients may not be sufficient to resist MERS-CoV entry. Consistently, sDPP4 within the physiological range failed to induce a significant reduction of viral plaques in a plaque-forming assay using MERS-CoV (Fig. 2B ).",

            "text": "Previous studies suggested that inflammation tends to increase sDPP4 levels (Wronkowitz et al., 2014) and altered DPP4 activities or concentrations in serum have been associated with various pathologic conditions (Klemann et al., 2016) . Chronic infection of hepatitis C and E viruses significantly increase sDPP4 activity and protein levels in patients' sera (Andrieu et al., 2003; Rafiei et al., 2016) . sDPP4 is also elevated in bronchoalveolar lavage fluids from patients with pulmonary pathologic conditions, but these levels are regulated independent of serum levels (Juillerat-Jeanneret et al., 1997) . Recently, it has been shown that DPP4 expression in pulmonary tissues of smokers and patients with chronic respiratory diseases is upregulated, which could partially explain why these individuals are more susceptible to MERS-CoV infection (Meyerholz et al., 2016; Seys et al., 2018) . We observed that sDPP4 is released into respiratory secretions of MERS patients to varying degrees. Although we did not show whether the levels of sDPP4 in respiratory secretions are upregulated, we can suppose that lung inflammation induced by MERS-CoV infection may upregulate sDPP4 secretion as reported in other pulmonary diseases (Juillerat-Jeanneret et al., 1997) . However, it is interesting to note that the levels of sDPP4 in the plasma of MERS patients were significantly lower than those of normal volunteers. Downregulation of circulating sDDP4 in sera has also been reported in various inflammatory diseases such as rheumatoid arthritis, sepsis, and several cancers (Klemann et al., 2016) . Even though the control and source of systemic DPP4 shedding is poorly understood, several organs including the spleen, lung, liver, kidney, and some immune cells with high DPP4 activity might be putative targets for regulating systemic sDPP4 levels in plasma (Mulvihill and Drucker, 2014) . Since a large number of studies clearly demonstrate that DPP4 also plays an integral role in the immune system (Klemann et al., 2016) , it would be interesting to determine how MERS-CoV infection regulates the expression and secretion of sDPP4, and the specific role of reduced sDPP4 in anti-viral immunity or viral pathogenesis. Interestingly, when we assessed various cytokines levels in the same plasma samples in a previous study , only the levels of IL-10 and EGF are significantly negatively and positively correlated with plasma sDPP4 concentration, respectively (Fig. 3) . The functional correlation of sDPP4 with the immune-suppressive cytokine, IL-10, or protective growth factor, EGF, on mucosal epithelium and disease severity needs to be carefully assessed in a future study with a larger sample size. Nevertheless, physiological concentrations of sDPP4 are not sufficient to significantly reduce MERS-CoV infection, suggesting that exogenous sDPP4 may have therapeutic potential in MERS patients. In addition, sDPP4 levels before infection with MERS-CoV might be associated with susceptibility or disease severity since its concentrations are relatively variable among normal individuals (Fig. 1) . The physiological roles of sDPP4 on MERS-CoV pathogenesis and viral life cycle also remain to be elucidated. Supplementary Table 1 . Every experiment was performed in duplicate and p values were calculated by student t-test or one-way analysis of variance. **p < 0.01, ***p < 0.001. 3 . Correlation of IL-10, EGF, and sDPP4 levels in patients' plasma. The plasma levels of sDPP4 were negatively and positively correlated with IL-10 and EGF levels, respectively. The concentrations of IL-10 and EGF in the same plasma samples (n = 40) were determined in a previous report . Correlations between the levels of cytokines and sDPP4 were assessed by linear regression analysis (red lines), and the r 2 and p values are shown.",
