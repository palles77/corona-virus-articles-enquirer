In this study we focussed on NK cell and interferon (IFN) responses after infection with infectious bronchitis virus (IBV). Based on surface expression of CD107+, enhanced activation of lung NK cells was observed at 1 dpi, whereas in blood prolonged NKcell activation was found. IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2424 mRNA and proteins were not rapidly induced whereas IFN-\u2425 production in lung, measured by Elispot assay, increased over time at 2 and 4 dpi. In contrast, IFN-\u2425 production in blood was highest at 1 dpi and decreased over time down to levels comparable to uninfected birds at 4 dpi. Collectively, infection with IBV-M41 resulted in activation of NK cells in the lung and blood and rapid production of IFN-\u2425 and not IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2424 compared to uninfected birds.",

            "text": "One of the most efficient and rapid host response against viruses consists of the production of type I interferons (IFN-\u2423 and IFN-\u2424), an essential part of the antiviral innate immune system (reviewed by Kawai and Akira, 2006) . Many if not most nucleated cells are capable of producing type I IFNs, though differences in the production of IFN-\u2423 or IFN-\u2424 between cells have been described (reviewed by Thiel and Weber, 2008) . Secreted IFNs stimulate adjacent cells to express potent antiviral proteins and stimulate macrophages and natural killer (NK) cells to elicit antiviral responses. IFN-\u2425, a type II IFN, is predominantly produced by NK, NKT cells, dendritic cells and Th1 CD4+ and CD8+ effector cytotoxic T lymphocytes once antigen specific immunity develops. IFN-\u2425 increases antigen presentation on macrophages and expression of MHC class I molecules, promotes NK cell activity and leukocyte adhesion and binding required for migration. Thus interferon production triggered by the first contact with the viral intruder slows down the virus multiplication, allowing the host's immune system to respond, and helps to establish an adaptive immune response. In a previous study, we showed that IFN-\u2425 production was not only significantly increased in splenocytes of IBV-infected chickens after in vitro restimulation with IBV, but also in splenocytes of IBV-uninfected chickens after 24 h incubation with IBV-M41 (Ariaans et al., 2009) . Based on these findings, we investigated whether chicken NK cells are activated upon infection with IBV, which might suggest that this cell population might be the possible producers of the IFN-\u2425.",

            "text": "Avian NK cells have been described as a population of cells in the chicken embryonic spleen at a developmental stage where T cells have not yet migrated to the periphery. These cells express surface CD8\u2423\u2423 homodimers, but no T (CD3) or B-cell specific antigens and are able to kill the NK-susceptible cell-line LSCC-RP9 (G\u00f6bel et al., 1994) . In adult chickens, these cells have been reported in the intestinal epithelial lymphocyte (IEL) population (G\u00f6bel et al., 2001) . The frequency of avian NK cells in peripheral blood lymphocytes (PBL) and spleen was very low, ranging from 0.5% to 1.0% (G\u00f6bel et al., 2001) . This is in sharp contrast to NK cell frequencies in mammals, which have approximately around 10% NK cells in blood and in spleen. One explanation for this difference in NK cells frequencies between chickens and mammals can be that the current markers used to detect chicken NK cells are based on NK cell populations in embryonic spleen and the gut and do not necessarily recognize all NK cells in blood and spleen of adult chickens. Recently, we identified additional markers that are expressed on splenic NK cells and developed an assay in which surface expression of CD107 (LAMP-1) is analyzed as a measure NK cell activation (Jansen et al., 2010) .",

After incubation, cells were washed in PBS supplemented with 0.5% BSA, stained with mouse anti-CD3 mAb and mouse anti-CD8\u2423 (Southern Biotechnology) and flowcytometry was performed.

To measure whether the NK cells were present and activated, a CD107 assay was performed using lung cells of infected and uninfected control birds. Cytotoxic cells contain cytolytic vesicles with proteins like granzyme and perforin. Lining the membrane of these vesicles is CD107 and upon activation the vesicles degranulate and merge with the surface membrane resulting in relocation of CD107 to the surface membrane (Alter et al., 2004) . Activation of NK cells was measured by determining the surface expression of CD107 combined with staining for CD3 to discriminate between CD3\u2212 NK cells and CD3+ cytotoxic T cells. Upon infection with IBV-M41, CD107 expression was significantly up regulated on CD3\u2212 cells at 1 dpi in the lungs (Fig. 1A) , suggesting that NK cells were activated. Thereafter, NK cell activity in lung was decreased to background level. In contrast, the percentage activated NK cells in PBMC (Fig. 1B) was much higher compared to the lung and showed a biphasic pattern, with a significant increase at 1 dpi, a decrease to background level at 2 dpi similar to the lung, followed by a significant increase at 4 dpi. The high percentage of activated NK cells in blood might indicate a rapid systemic spread of IBV-M41 (Smith et al., 1985) . Transcriptome analysis of pooled tracheas at 3 dpi with an attenuated IBV Massachusetts strain revealed induction of genes involved in cytotoxicity such as Granzyme-A precursor, Fas, CD3 \u2426 and \u2425 chain, MHC II, and TLR2. This expression pattern could be due to cytotoxic T cell responses as suggested by the authors (Wang et al., 2006) , but these molecules are also playing a major role in NK-cell cytotoxicity (Zhang et al., 2012) . Based on our study a contribution of NK cells at 3 dpi seems very likely and confirms the transcriptome analysis. Furthermore, newly entered but not yet antigen-specific CTLs might be present though not yet cytotoxic, whereas the IBV-M41 specific CTLs can be detected after 9 dpi (Liu et al., 2012) .",

The potential of IBV to induce IFN-\u2423/\u2424 after infection and its sensitivity to IFN-\u2423/\u2424 seems to be IBV strain dependent. IBV-M41 induced low levels of acid stabile IFNs in chick embryo and chick kidney cells (CKCs) and no IFNs after inoculation in embryonated eggs (Otsuki et al., 1979) , whereas for example the tissue culture adapted IBV Beaudette strain induced IFNs in embryonated eggs (Otsuki et al., 1979) . In contrast, Holmes and Darbyshire (1978) showed that IBV-M41 and IBV-Beaudette failed to yield IFN in primary CKC and in tracheal organ cultures using Semliki Forest Virus inhibition assays. In the latter study these strains were not susceptible to the inhibitory effects of IFN, whereas Pei et al. (2001) treated CKC with recombinant ChIFN-\u2423 which inhibited replication of IBV-Beaudette and Gray strain. Repeated in vivo administration of recombinant ChIFN-\u2423 before and after inoculation with IBV-Gray strain reduced the clinical respiratory illness.",
