RNA was purified by use of QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit (QIAGEN). Specimens were tested for hMPV and HCoV-NL63 by use of Seeplex system, which applies dual specific oligonucleotide (DPO) technology, which produce greatly improve specificity without any false-positive. DPO contains two separate priming regions joined by polydeoxyinosine linker. The linker assumes a bubble-like structure, which itself is not involved in priming but rather delineates the boundary between the two parts of the primer. This structure results in two primer segments with distinct annealing properties: a longer 5'-segment that initiates stable priming and a short 3'-segment that determines target-specific extension. This DPO-based system is a fundamental tool that blocks extension of nonspecifically primed templates, thereby generating consistently high polymerase chain reaction (PCR) specificity, even under less-than-optimal PCR conditions. An internal control was included to check for any problem ocurring during PCR. The hMPV and HCoV-NL63 genes did not cross-react with influenza A and B viruses; respiratory syncytial virus (RSV); parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) PIV1, PIV2, PIV3; rhinovirus A; or adenovirus. Positive reverse transcriptase-PCR for hMPV and HCoV-NL63, respectively, was rigorously verified by the Mayo Clinic Laboratory (United States). The clinical data were analyzed and were expressed as percentages where applicable.",

            "text": "The general characteristics of hMPV and HCoV-NL63 highlighted by this study show strong similarities with those that have emerged from broad, previously published studies. hMPV was detected in 8.3% of those hospitalized with LRTIs. These figures are similar to those reported in Europe, 1,2 the United States, 3 and Australia. 4 HCoV-NL63 was detected in 2.8% of specimens tested and was associated with both URTIs and LRTIs. These findings are similar to those of previous studies that reported detection rates ranging from 1.3% to 3.6% in various sample sets. 5, 6 We found the proportion of patients with hMPV infection was significantly higher among children 1 to 3 years old in comparison with that among younger or older children. Our results are comparable with those of van den Hoogen et al. 7 The seasonality of hMPV is becoming evident. In our study, the peak incidence was in March, August and September, but there were hMPV isolates from every month of the year except for July and October. A broad seasonal activity of hMPV with distinctive pattern in different years was reported by Sloots et al. 3 A previous report states that HCoV-NL63 peaked in summer, which is similar to our finding. hMPV was associated with acute URTIs and LRTIs in our immunocompromised children. The hMPV-associated disease in hematologic malignancy and related disorders was characterized by several respiratory symptoms, including fever, nasal congestion, cough, and shortness of breath. Seven patients developed rapidly progressive respiratory failure associated with pneumonia and culture-negative shock. All patients were admitted to intensive care units. hMPV was the only respiratory pathogen detected by NPA or BAL in 4 of these patients. These findings are similar to those reported by Williams et al 8, 9 and Englund et al. 10 Three immunocompromised patients with idiopathic pneumonia died despite aggressive therapy, suggesting involvement of hMPV as a cause of total idiopathic pneumonia. Our findings are consistent with those of investigators who have demonstrated that HCoV-NL63 was a cause of URTIs in hospitalized children with acute respiratory infection and can be associated with high risk of respiratory complications in high-risk patients. 11 In summary, our data suggest that hMPV and HCoV-NL63 may play a significant role in acute respiratory illness of hospitalized Saudi children. These data support the hypothesis that hMPV is a significant pathogen in immunocompromised children, with a risk of increased morbidity and mortality. HCoV-NL63 may cause severe lower respiratory disease in those with underlying conditions. Our study has a number of limitations. It is not an epidemiological study and so may not reflect prevalence in the community; in fact, the frequency of viruses detected by molecular biological techniques are of those sampled and not of all those who are symptomatic. In addition, this study was conducted in a tertiary care facility with many immunocompromised children, a group not reflective of the general population. More comprehensive studies are needed to determine the full spectrum of presentation of hMPV and HCoV-NL63 and the impact of these viruses on the health care system in Saudi Arabia.",
