Many recommendations for the composition and sequence of the 3 0 end have been suggested based on theoretical considerations, but have not been verified experimentally. We analyzed 3 0 end triplets of PCR primer sequences obtained from refereed journal articles, to test those recommendations and to make empirical recommendations for primer design. The frequencies of the 64 possible 3 0 end triplets among 2137 PCR primers from the VirOligo database were not uniformly distributed. From the analysis, we found that unfavored and preferred 3 0 end triplets existed, and that the apparent preferences were not due to base compositions in viral genome sequences. Comparison of the sequences preferred by practitioners to those recommended, suggested that no single recommendation is entirely satisfactory. We suggest that recommendations be replaced with a scoring system incorporating empirical frequencies such as those reported here. q",

            "text": "Many current molecular biological analyses, especially microarray-based analysis of gene expression, require the efficient design of large numbers of polymerase chain reactions (PCRs). In the PCR, the 3 0 ends of primers must anneal to templates to be elongated by a DNA polymerase. A high GCC content at the 3 0 end of a primer may obviate the need for complete complementarity and annealing of the remainder of the primer sequence, thus diminishing the specificity of the priming reaction [1] . A low GCC content at a primer's 3 0 end may, due to weak annealing, increase the importance of complete annealing of the remainder of the primer sequence [2] . On the other hand, such primers may not be elongated efficiently by DNA polymerase [1] . Although the importance of the 3 0 end triplet in primer design is recognized, many recommendations for 3 0 end triplet selection, based mostly on theory, have been put forth, and some contradict others. Recommended compositions of 3 0 ends are: no T at the 3 0 end and at least one W (A or T) in the 3 0 end triplets [3] ; S (C or G) at the 3 0 end and no GC or CG, due to potential formation of hairpins and primer-dimers [4] ; low GCC [2, 5] ; one or two S [6] . One way to test the validity of those recommendations and determine which 3 0 end triplets are best suited for PCR primers is to examine the 3 0 ends of primers actually used in successful PCR experiments. We here report such an examination.",

Since the primer sequence data set contained 134 BHV-1, 237 BVDV and 121 FMV primers, these viruses were used to test whether genome compositions determined the 3 0 end triplet frequencies. Thus, triplet frequencies of the BHV-1 genome (135,382 overlapping triplets) were subtracted from frequencies of 3 0 end triplets in BHV specific primers (Fig. 2) to yield differential frequencies. The same calculation was performed for BVDV and FMV (12,274 and 7794 overlapping triplets, respectively). In this analysis, a differential frequency of zero would indicate that a primer's triplet frequency is expected from its representation in the genome sequence. Negative values indicate that those triplets were used less frequently in primers than in genome sequences, while positive values indicate more frequent use.",

However, two of eight WSS triplets, ACG and TCG (WCG), were in the bottom half of triplet frequencies seen less frequently in the VirOligo database while the other combinations of WSS appeared in the top dozen. Other applications, such as DS genes (Accelrys), allow the user to choose the 3 0 end sequence but have no 3 0 end selection in their default settings. According to O'Connell [5] , the current trend in programming choices for primers is to ask for low %GC toward the 3 0 end.

In the VirOligo database, WSS (19.0%) and SWS (18.0%) were the two most common 3 0 end triplet combinations (Fig. 1) . The under-representation of WCG, mentioned above, suggests a high frequency of failure of PCRs using primers ending in WCG. Low GCC contents in the 3 0 end triplets of PCR primers were not frequently reported in the VirOligo database. Among the existing recommendations, the best performer, when judged by the observed 3 0 end triplet frequencies is the one that requires an S at the 3 0 end and no GC or CG in the sequence. All but one (AGC) of the top 10 conform to this recommendation and only one (GGG) of the 10 least frequent conforms to the recommendation. Based on our results we would recommend WSS or SWS 3 0 ends, but avoiding WCG. However, there are additional exceptions to even this recommendation. We suggest that primer design software incorporate scores based on empirical frequencies of 3 0 end triplets, such as those reported here, into the evaluation of oligonucleotides as primers.",
