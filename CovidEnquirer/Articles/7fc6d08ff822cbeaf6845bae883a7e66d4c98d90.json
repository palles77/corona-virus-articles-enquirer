Likewise, cellular respiration provides the fuel required to drive the energetically costly process of viral replication. The effects of many viruses on metabolic pathways that produce the building blocks and energy needed for viral replication are well-documented. Although these perturbations are thought to support viral replication, the underlying molecular mechanisms are still the subject of much investigation. Second, many viruses use specialized membranes for viral entry, gene expression, genome replication, and assembly. The distinct morphology and functional properties of these membranes presumably reflects their specialized composition, which has been optimized for the viral process that they support. Analysis of the chemical composition and biophysical properties of these membranes, as well as the molecular mechanisms underlying their biogenesis, is therefore central to understanding their function in viral processes. Third, signal transduction by bioactive lipid metabolites plays a major role in the host response to viral infection and, in many cases, in pathogenesis.

First, metabolic reactions are essential to the infectious cycle of all viruses. Synthesis of new virions is itself comprised by the chemical conversion of nucleotides, amino acids, and lipids into progeny virions. Host-catalyzed chemical reactions that lead to the synthesis of these basic building blocks, and to the release of energy, have direct impacts on viral replication. Second, since the natural function of metabolite-binding sites on proteins is to bind to small molecules, these sites are generally reasonable molecular targets for drug discovery efforts. Indeed, many existing drugs mimic the interaction of naturally occurring metabolites with their respective enzymes and receptors. These \"anti-metabolites\" act by preventing utilization of the natural metabolite. Traditional antivirals targeting viral polymerase and protease activities are good examples of drugs that act by this mode. They inhibit the natural catalytic function of these enzymes by binding to the active site or to allosteric sites. These antiviral drugs are selective because they target metabolic reactions unique to the virus. Although this approach has produced some of the most successful drugs on the market today, it is inherently limited because viral genomes encode a very limited number of metabolite-binding proteins, and because resistance can develop through mutations that affect drug binding without affecting catalytic function. In addition, the selectivity of these drugs for their specific viral targets usually limits their use to a narrow spectrum of closely related viruses.",

Viruses are fully dependent upon host metabolism and do not themselves encode the enzymes needed to produce the metabolites required for their own replication. Inhibition of a metabolic reaction critical for viral replication is therefore unlikely to be overcome by direct mutations of the viral genome. Likewise, the centrality of host metabolism to the viral infectious cycle makes it likely that phylogenetically related viruses have shared dependencies on specific metabolic pathways. Although the host proteome is replete with enzymes and proteins that bind to small-molecule metabolites, the challenge is to identify those that can mediate antiviral activity without affecting normal host cell function. As advances in analytical methods have enabled both broader and deeper surveys of virus-induced perturbations of host metabolism, identification of targets that mediate adequately selective antiviral effects has come closer to reality. proteomic studies.

            "text": "The goal of lipidomic analysis is the quantitative characterization of all lipids in a biological system, including the dynamic changes that occur in response to stimuli and the physiological consequences of these changes. This is technically challenging due to the structural diversity of lipid molecules and the inability to predict or infer lipid structure based on genomic, transcriptomic, or proteomic data. Lipidomic analysis is also challenging because the abundance of individual species can vary over a wide range. Phospholipids are so abundant that they constitute up to 50% of the total mass of lipids in the cell, whereas prostaglandins and other bioactive signaling lipids may be present at only picomolar concentrations. No single analytical method is sufficient to capture the full lipidome of a biological system, and as with other \"omics\" approaches, the methods used for quantitative analysis of large lipidomic data sets affect interpretation of the data. Strategies currently being used to examine the interaction of viruses with host lipids generally fall into one of three categories. First, there are classical reductionist approaches using metabolic labeling and biochemical reconstitution experiments to examine the potential function of a limited set of specific lipids in viral processes. Second, it is possible to infer roles for different classes of lipids through transcriptomic and proteomic studies that detect changes in the expression of host enzymes responsible for the synthesis, metabolism, and trafficking of these lipid classes. Third, global analytical chemistry methods allow direct detection and quantification of specific lipid species that change as a function of viral infection. This section highlights the types of biological questions that can be answered using these different approaches.",

Additional studies documented virus-induced changes in the uptake of isotopically labeled amino acids, phosphate, and other nutrients, suggesting perturbation of their respective metabolic pathways.

            "text": "Analogous reductionist approaches that focus on a particular metabolic pathway are useful today in corroborating discoveries made using newer, more discovery-based global methods (discussed below) and in examining the biochemical functions of individual lipid species in viral replication. Loss-of-function experiments that detect a viral phenotype when a specific lipid class is depleted from a host cell can be used to establish the essentiality of the depleted lipid for a viral process. Elegant studies of brome mosaic virus (BMV) replication in yeast led to the discovery that BMV RNA replication is blocked in yeast strains that have a reduced ratio of unsaturated to saturated fatty acids (UFAs and SFAs, respectively) due to mutations in the gene encoding \u03949 fatty acid (FA) desaturase, even when these mutations have no effect on cell growth (Lee et al., 2001) . The antiviral effect of UFA depletion on BMV RNA replication is correlated with depletion of UFAs from replication membranes and decreases in membrane fluidity (Lee and Ahlquist, 2003) . Rescue of BMV RNA replication by supplementation of growth medium with UFAs suggests a functional role of UFAs in this process. As another example, studies of Flock house virus (FHV) replication in a cell-free system allowed systematic examination of various glycerosphingolipids, sphingomyelin, and cholesterol in FHV RNA replication and the discovery that positive-strand RNA synthesis is promoted by glycerophospholipids. This effect varies depending on the length of the acyl chain and its degree of saturation (Wu et al., 1992) . The major limitation of the approaches used to make these discoveries is that most viral processes cannot be recapitulated in genetically tractable organisms or in cell-free systems. A notable exception to this is the fusion step of viral entry, which has been examined for many enveloped viruses through the use of synthetic liposomes of defined composition and size.",

            "text": "Examination of changes in host gene expression has become a useful tool for discovering how viruses affect metabolism. These studies implicitly assume that changes in enzyme abundance correspond to changes in the quantity or quality of metabolic output and that these changes are functionally relevant for viral replication, pathogenesis, or the host response. Systematic identification of virus-induced changes in steady-state host gene expression can now be routinely performed using global transcriptomic and proteomic methods (see Chapter 11). Conversely, RNA interference (RNAi) experiments that look for loss of replication upon depletion of a given host factor are also widely used to validate candidate pathways identified through transcriptomic and proteomic profiling studies and for the de novo discovery of metabolic pathways that are important for viral replication. Profiling and RNAi screening approaches have also been used to study viral pathogenesis with the goal of identifying pathways, and even specific host factors, that are critical for viral pathogenesis and that are candidate targets for antiviral intervention. For example, recent comparative transcriptomic analyses discovered that increased transcription of host lipid metabolic genes regulated by the liver X and retinoid X receptors (LXR/RXR) is characteristic of low pathogenicity influenza virus infections, whereas these changes are not observed during infection with H7N9 or other pathogenic avian influenza viruses or the highly pathogenic 1918H1N1 human influenza virus (Josset et al., 2012; Morrison et al., 2014) . Although these types of studies have been powerful tools in identifying virus-induced perturbations of the host cell, they provide an incomplete picture of a virus' effect on the host metabolome. Expression of many metabolic enzymes is regulated posttranscriptionally; moreover, the function of many enzymes is regulated posttranslationally through modifications that affect enzyme activity, oligomerization, or localization. Consequently, transcriptomic profiling experiments cannot predict all changes in protein abundance, and proteomic profiling experiments cannot detect changes in the activities and output of host metabolic enzymes. For related reasons, it is difficult to predict how RNAi-mediated depletion of a given metabolic enzyme affects the flux and molecular output of the pathways in which it functions. The potential limitations of relying upon only one type of profiling approach are illustrated by transcriptomic, proteomic, and lipidomic analyses of hepatitis C virus (HCV) infection. RNA profiling of HCV infection in vivo identified increased abundance of transcripts involved in glycosphingolipid synthesis and signaling by the serum response element binding protein (SREBP) pathway that are correlated with the onset of viremia (Su et al., 2002) , suggesting that these pathways are important for HCV replication. Changes in the abundance of transcripts involved in lipid metabolism genes later in infection are correlated with steatosis and oxidative stress and thus are proposed to reflect a function of these gene products in pathogenesis (Smith et al., 2003; Bigger et al., 2004) . A separate proteomic profiling of HCV infection in cell culture (Diamond et al., 2010) identified significant changes in enzyme abundance that were not predicted by the earlier transcriptomic studies. For example, changes in the abundance of proteins involved in energy production (i.e., glycolysis, the pentose phosphate pathway, and the citric acid cycle) early in infection were observed, suggesting that HCV increases energy production to meet the demands of viral replication. Parallel changes in the abundance of enzymes responsible for fatty acid oxidation have been interpreted to reflect a requirement for energy or increased acetyl-CoA for membrane synthesis. The perturbations detected by proteomic analysis likewise represent only a portion of the metabolomic changes induced by HCV since a parallel lipidomic profiling study detected HCV-induced enrichment of certain phospholipids and decreases in other phospholipid, sphingomyelin, and triacylglycerol species early in infection. Since not all lipids of these respective classes are uniformly affected, lipidomic analysis in this case enabled a higher resolution understanding of HCV's effects on lipid metabolism. This in turn provides an opportunity to identify particular molecules within a given pathway or lipid class that have a specific and optimized function in viral replication, pathogenesis, or the host response.",

A mass spectrum plots the signal intensity (abundance) of a given ion as a function of its mass-to-charge (m/z) ratio, which enables measurement of molecular weight and also can provide structural information. Liquid or gas chromatography (LC or GC) is commonly used to separate molecules so that those with the same m/z ratio enter the spectrometer at different times. Electrospray ionization is the most commonly used method for lipidomic studies because it does not have a major structural bias and because it generates intact molecular ions and therefore enables ion abundance to be taken as a measure of the abundance of the parent metabolite. The combination of unique retention times and m/z ratios measured by quadrupole or Orbitrap mass spectrometers permits the routine quantitation of thousands of peaks in a single metabolomics profiling experiment with sensitivities as low as the femtomolar range. MS-based profiling experiments can be performed in \"targeted\" or \"untargeted\" modes. Targeted studies focus on a limited set of metabolites for which retention times and m/z ratios have already been established using authentic standards. Untargeted profiling experiments monitor all detectable ions and use computational tools (e.g., XCMS or MetAlign) to identify differences in ion abundance between different samples. Assigning a structure to an ion of interest then requires tandem LC-MS/MS or other analytical experiments to compare the ion of interest with authentic standards. Targeted profiling provides a rapid and rigorous way to confirm the general effects of viral infection on a class of lipids or a lipid pathway, to test hypotheses generated from gene expression and proteomic analyses or untargeted metabolomic profiling, and to obtain higher resolution data regarding specific changes within pathways of interest. Untargeted analysis is more suited to the discovery of specific lipids that may be important in viral infection. As discussed above, targeted lipidomic profiling of HCV has been useful in interpreting and validating HCV-induced changes in lipid homeostasis inferred from transcriptomic and proteomic profiling studies. An independent untargeted study corroborated the targeted profile but in addition identified 26 distinct lipid species whose abundance changed by threefold or greater during HCV infection (Rodgers et al., 2012) . One of these changes was a greater than 10-fold increase in desmosterol, a penultimate intermediate in cholesterol synthesis that is normally not abundant in the host cell. The discovery that HCV replication is inhibited under conditions in which desmosterol synthesis is blocked and rescued upon the addition of exogenous desmosterol (versus other sterols) suggests that this molecule has a specific function in HCV replication. A priori, there was little rationale for including desmosterol in the targeted study since this biosynthetic pathway is highly regulated and driven toward its end product, cholesterol. In another example, untargeted metabolomic profiling led to the discovery that N-acetyl-aspartate is the most up-regulated metabolite in cells infected with human cytomegalovirus (HCMV) . This change was unlikely to be detected in targeted studies because the synthetic route for this metabolite is unclear and it does not appear on standard metabolic maps or on lists of targeted metabolites.",

Pioneering work by Rabinowitz and colleagues has demonstrated the utility of LC-MS and isotopically labeled nutrients to profile kinetic flux through metabolic pathways . This allows discovery of specific pathways affected by viral infection and can also provide insights into underlying mechanisms. For example, comparative flux analysis of 13 C-labeled glucose in cells infected with HCMV or herpes simplex virus 1 (HSV-1) has revealed that both viruses induce the TCA cycle; however, HCMVinfected cells produce citrate with two 13 C atoms (reflecting synthesis via glycolytic flux) whereas HSV-1-infected cells produce citrate with three 13 C atoms (reflecting synthesis via anaplerotic flux) (Figure 1 ).

Studies of specific viruses in biochemical reconstitution and cell-based models have revealed richness in the effects of lipid structure and function on membrane fusion during viral entry. Many viruses, including alphaviruses, HIV, HSV-1, HCMV, and influenza virus, require cholesterol (or other sterols) for efficient fusion (Box 3); however, there are differences in how and where cholesterol functions during entry (viral membrane, cellular membrane, or both). HIV entry requires cholesterol-and sphingolipid-rich lipid rafts in both the viral membrane, where they stabilize virion structure and infectivity, and in the plasma membrane, where they facilitate clustering of the CD4 receptor and CCR5/CXCR4 co-receptor. In contrast, Semliki Forest virus requires cholesterol because the conformational changes in the viral E1 protein that catalyze fusion cannot occur without its interaction with cholesterol (Umashankar et al., 2008) . Influenza A virus entry requires cholesterol in the viral membrane but not in the target membrane, although the functional basis for this requirement is not well-understood.",

In addition to its importance in membrane structure and function, cholesterol is important as a biosynthetic precursor of hormones, vitamins, and other lipid-signaling molecules. Signal transduction by downstream metabolites of sterols, such as the oxysterols and vitamin D, has been increasingly implicated in both the innate and adaptive immune responses to viral pathogens. Sterols that occur upstream of cholesterol were previously thought to exist only as biosynthetic intermediates, but they are now known to have additional functions in signal transduction. For example, desmosterol, a penultimate intermediate of cholesterol, is an activator of the liver X receptor (LXR) and the dominant ligand of LXR in macrophage foam cells, where it activates and inhibits transcription of LXR and SREBP target genes, respectively, and suppresses expression of inflammatory genes (Spann et al., 2012) . Enteroviruses cause dynamic changes in cholesterol trafficking and metabolism (Ilnytska et al., 2013) . Early in infection, cholesterol internalization is increased while cholesterol stored as esters in lipid droplets is concomitantly decreased. Ectopic expression of the viral 2BC protein alone is sufficient to trigger this increase in free intracellular cholesterol, much of which appears to be trafficked to sites of viral RNA replication via Rab11-positive recycling endosomes. Inhibition of viral replication when cholesterol trafficking is blocked suggests that these dynamic changes in trafficking are functionally significant for the virus. For example, cholesterol depletion appears to affect proteolytic processing of the viral polyprotein. Although the exact mechanisms underlying the effects of enteroviruses on cholesterol trafficking still need to be elucidated, it is known that virus-induced perturbations of PI4P and cholesterol metabolism and trafficking (Figure 4) are not mediated by changes in host gene expression but rather by posttranslational mechanisms affecting host protein function and localization.",

Methyl-beta-cyclodextrin has been used to deplete cells and membranes of cholesterol for loss-of-function studies. A limitation of these studies is that these reagents are not selective for cholesterol and bind to many other late-stage sterols. This selectivity (or lack thereof) should be recognized when designing and interpreting these types of experiments. For example, the loss of function caused by depletion of cholesterol with methyl-beta-cyclodextrin is commonly \"rescued\" by the addition of exogenous cholesterol without the inclusion of other sterols as controls. This overlooks the significant differences in the effects of cholesterol versus other sterols on the functional properties of membranes (Bloch, 1983) . Likewise, the use of fluorophoreconjugated sterols in imaging experiments carries the risk that the fluorophore, which is generally comparable in size to the sterol moiety, affects the physical and/or chemical properties of the molecule. and ceramide as well as diacylglycerol and phosphatidic acid. Biochemically isolated replication membranes exhibit enriched ceramide content, including specific enrichment of long-chain ceramide and dihydroceramide species that may induce negative curvature to facilitate invagination of the endoplasmic reticulum membrane and formation of the replication compartment. This is consistent with the known effects of ceramides on lipid bilayer structure, although it is also possible that these ceramides are generated as part of the host response or have some other function.",

Scission of this neck region completes budding of the viral particle. Viruses use protein-lipid and lipid-lipid interactions to achieve membrane curvature during virion budding and scission (Rossman and Lamb, 2013 ) ( Figure 5 ). First, membrane curvature can be \"scaffolded\" by viral core proteins or proteins that bind to the head groups of the lipid bilayer. In this case, energetically favorable protein-lipid interactions are used to drive curvature of the membrane. Second, the insertion of proteins into the lipid bilayer can cause \"hydrophobic displacement\" leading to energetically unfavorable differences in the surface areas of the inner and outer membrane leaflets. Membrane curvature is induced in these cases to relieve the energy strain. Third, adjacent areas of lipid-ordered and lipid-disordered regions of a membrane can differ in thickness, resulting in energetically unfavorable interactions (referred to as \"line tension\") due to alignment of the polar head groups of the thinner lipid-disordered domain with the hydrophobic tails of the thicker, lipid-ordered domain. Fourth, lipid structure can affect membrane curvature through intrinsic bending induced by the shape and charge of the component lipids (Box 2). Perturbations of membrane curvature by viral glycoproteins on the outer leaflet of the budding membrane and matrix and capsid proteins on the inner leaflet are essential for the budding of many viruses. For viruses such as tick-borne encephalitis virus and hepatitis B virus, budding is driven by assembly of the viral glycoprotein on the surface of the nascent bud. This \"pulling\" force is sufficient to result in the formation and release of subviral particles that lack nucleocapsids. In contrast, for HIV and other retroviruses, the assembly of Gag exerts a \"pushing force\" that drives membrane curvature and is sufficient for assembly and release of virus-like particles. Membrane curvature during budding of influenza virus (see Section 3.3.3) as well as Semliki Forest virus and other alphaviruses appears to require the concerted action of pushing from the nucleocapsid and pulling by the viral glycoprotein.",

Most viruses do not encode their own scission machinery, and the outer neck of the membrane requiring scission is topologically inaccessible to most cytoplasmic scission proteins (e.g., dynamin or Arf1). HIV and other retroviruses achieve scission by recruiting endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) proteins to the site of viral assembly through late-domain motifs in HIV Gag and other retroviral capsid proteins. Other viruses (e.g., Poxviridae, Herpesviridae, Filoviridae, Rhabdoviridae, and Paramyxoviridae) that bud from a variety of subcellular membranes (nuclear, endoplasmic reticulum, or plasma membranes) also recruit the ESCRT machinery through interactions of viral latedomains with Tsg101, Alix, and Nedd4-like proteins, although there are undoubtedly variations in viral interaction with the ESCRT machinery.

The two influenza virus glycoproteins, hemagglutinin (HA) and neuraminidase (NA), are targeted to the plasma membrane by specific sequences in the transmembrane domains of HA and NA as well as by palmitoylation of HA. Concentration of HA in the membrane induces curvature and is sufficient to permit budding of virus-like particles; however, budding of authentic virions requires other effectors, including the viral M1 and M2 proteins. M1 multimerizes to form a helical net that supports the viral membrane and connects the inner leaflet of the viral membrane to viral ribonucleoproteins (RNPs) on the virion interior. Pushing caused by multimerization of M1 beneath the budding membrane or by recruitment of RNPs initiates budding. Scission of the neck structure is catalyzed by the viral M2 protein although the biophysical mechanism of scission is still not known. In infected cells, M2 localizes between ordered (raft) and disordered domains of the plasma membrane. As budding progresses, M2 concentrates in the neck region at the boundary between the ordered, cholesterolrich viral membrane and the adjacent cholesterol-poor plasma membrane. Peptides corresponding to the amphipathic helix of M2 induce negative membrane curvature in a cholesterol-dependent manner; moreover, binding of M2 to lipid domains with high radii of curvature comparable to those in the neck of budding virions disrupts packing of lipid head groups in vitro. Insertion of the M2 amphipathic helix into the lipid-disordered phase may therefore cause membrane scission through the generation of line tension or packing defects. Cellular factors (e.g., Rab11) may also contribute to scission since mutations in the cytoplasmic tail of M2 can have significant effects on budding efficiency.",

These lipids are synthesized from arachidonic acid and other polyunsaturated fatty acids (e.g., eicosapentaenoic, docosahexaenoic, linoleic, and linolenic acids) via cyclooxygenase (COX), lipoxygenase (LOX), and cytochrome P450 pathway.

Here, it is worth noting that Morita and colleagues identified protectin D1 as an inhibitor of influenza virus replication in human respiratory cells and found that its antiviral mechanism of action in cell culture is due to an effect on the nuclear export of viral transcripts. In the mouse model, administration of protectin D1 increases survival, but the extent to which this is due to an effect on viral replication versus mitigation of the host inflammatory response is less clear.

As the functional output of the expressed genome, the lipidome and metabolome represent the integration of all virus-induced changes in host transcription, RNA stability and processing, translation, posttranslational modifications, protein stability and localization, and enzymatic activity. A global view of these perturbations and their functional consequences is important for both basic and translational research efforts. As basic science, the interaction of viruses with host lipids is a fundamental aspect of viral replication and pathogenesis. We cannot understand the physical and molecular mechanisms driving viral processes without understanding the function of membranes associated with these processes and how, at a molecular level, lipid structure dictates function. Although our knowledge of the specific lipids required for viral replication and pathogenesis is arguably still too limited, the idea of antiviral strategies that exploit the interaction of viruses with host lipids is a compelling area for translational efforts. In part, this is because Nature already provides multiple examples in which the modulation of membrane composition is an effective defense against viral pathogens. For example, the interferon-inducible transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) exhibit broad-spectrum activity against many enveloped viruses and may do so by affecting the composition or packing of cellular membranes (Bailey et al., 2014) . Consistent with this, the IFITMs affect intracellular lipid transport, and their presence in membranes enhances lipid packing and reduces membrane fluidity. Likewise, the effects of 25-hydroxysterol on sterol and sphingolipid synthesis are thought to directly affect the composition of host membranes targeted for viral fusion or used for other viral processes. Rational antiviral therapies that act through analogous mechanisms are therefore theoretically possible, although significant advances are needed in our understanding of how lipids function in viral infection to realize this potential.",

            "text": "We currently lack understanding of how lipid structure affects lipid function in vivo. This is a largely unexplored area of virus-host interactions despite clear significance for basic science and translational efforts. Ideally, tools analogous to site-directed mutagenesis studies of protein structure and function could be used to understand how seemingly subtle differences in structure (e.g., acyl chain length and degree and location of unsaturation, ratio of glycerophospholipids to sphingolipids, or head group charge and size) can lead to significant changes in function. In reality, this type of reductionist experiment is very challenging. Engineering advances that enable the synthesis of biomimetic-supported lipid bilayers from synthetic and cell-derived lipids in a medium-throughput manner may facilitate screens to identify specific lipids or combinations of lipids that are optimal for interaction with viral proteins. Viral processes, such as membrane fusion or penetration during entry or genome replication, may also be amenable to functional screens of this type that probe the relationship between lipid structure and membrane function in the associated virological process.",

            "text": "With respect to lipidomic profiling, current NMR and LC-MS-based approaches only permit the examination of lipid structure and abundance in biological samples derived from populations of cells. Determining the subcellular localization of lipids requires purification of the membrane of interest away from other cellular membranes or microscopy methods using fluorophore-conjugated lipid molecules or specific lipid-binding proteins to detect the lipid of interest. These approaches may be limited, respectively, because the membrane of interest cannot be biochemically isolated without perturbing it, because attachment of a fluorophore alters the physicochemical properties of the lipid molecule, and because the lipid-binding protein used for detection lacks sufficient specificity (Box 3). Alternative approaches that overcome these technical limitations are clearly needed, and emerging imaging methods may have a transformative effect on the study of lipids in viral processes in the cellular milieu. Raman-based microscopy methods rely on the vibrational frequency of chemical bonds and are especially well-suited to the imaging of lipids since they are rich in carbon-hydrogen bonds. Coherent Raman microscopy has been used to demonstrate variations in the degree of acyl chain saturation and order among droplets within the same cell and within the same droplet. This approach coupled with confocal fluorescence microscopy to detect viral proteins could be developed to study the chemical content of membranes associated with specific viral processes and to monitor the reactions that result in synthesis of these membranes in live cells. Here, isotopically labeled lipids of interest could be especially useful, since the imaging system can be tuned to detect only the isotopically labeled chemical bond and this could be used to distinguish a particular lipid species from other members of its class (e.g., visualization of deuterated desmosterol without background signal from endogenous cholesterol and other sterols). Imaging MS methods may also prove useful for monitoring lipid localization within the cell. Methods such as nanoscale secondary ion MS and desorption electrospray ionization MS can resolve the localization of a given metabolite in two-dimensional space and have been used to monitor lipid droplet formation in cells and tissues and may, with gains in spatial resolution and sensitivity, provide another tool for ana lysis of membrane-associated viral processes in cells.",

            "text": "As with all host-targeted antivirals, a crux issue is whether it is possible to inhibit viral replication or pathogenesis by targeting lipid metabolism without having undesired effects on the host. This concern arises especially because metabolism is central to host homeostasis and viability. The identification of lipid molecules that are required for viral replication but dispensable for the host, may present the best option for mitigating the risk of toxicity at the cellular or organismal level. Untargeted lipidomic profiling experiments and metabolomic flux studies are critical tools for this effort. The tools and approaches used to advance our understanding of how specific lipid molecules function in viral processes may also facilitate rational targeting of specific lipid molecules rather than wholesale blockade of entire biosynthetic pathways. This may enable minimization of toxicity and maximization of tolerability and safety. Rapid advances in methodology and understanding make this an exciting and rapidly evolving area of virology and systems biology.",

(A) The interaction of membrane lipids with viral core proteins or other proteins that recognize lipid head groups can scaffold membrane curvature.

The induction of curvature is one physical mechanism for counteracting the resulting difference in surface areas of the inner and outer leaflets. (C) Adjacent regions of lipid-ordered and lipid-disordered membrane differ in thickness. This results in energetically unfavorable packing of hydrophilic head groups against hydrophobic tail groups. Membrane curvature can relieve this \"line tension.\" (D) The structure and shape of individual lipids in the bilayer can affect membrane curvature (see Text Box 2).
