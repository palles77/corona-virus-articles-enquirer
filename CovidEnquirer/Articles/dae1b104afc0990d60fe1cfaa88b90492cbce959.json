Black tea is derived from the leaves of Camellia sinensis plant, and it is rich in theaflavin polyphenols, in particular theaflavin (TF1), theaflavin-3-monogallate (TF2A), theaflavin-3 0monogallate (TF2B), and theaflavin-3,3 0 -digallate (TF3). Vero and A549 cells were used to evaluate the effect of purified individual black tea theaflavins as anti-herpes simplex virus 1 agents. With the rise of HSV resistant strains, there is a critical need to develop novel antiherpesviral treatments. Results of the cytotoxicity assay tested by MTS [3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-5-(3-carboxymethoxy-phenyl)-2-(4sulfophenyl)-2H-tetrazolium] showed that TF1, TF2, and TF3 are not toxic to Vero and A549 cells at a concentration up to 75 lM. The antiviral activity of the individual theaflavins was tested by plaque reduction assay, MTS assay, flow cytometric analysis and confocal microscopy observations. The results showed that TF1, TF2, and TF3 exhibit potent, dose-dependent anti-HSV-1 effect, with TF3 being the most efficient in both Vero and A549 cells. A concentration of 50 lM TF3 and above was sufficient to inhibit >99% of the production of HSV-1 viral particles. The anti-HSV-1 effect of TF3 is due to a direct effect on the virions, and treating Vero or A549 cells with TF3 for 1 h prior to infection, or treating the cells at different times post infection does not inhibit HSV-1 production. TF3 is stable at vaginal pH, indicating its potential to be a promising natural and affordable remedy against herpes simplex viral infections.",

HSV-1 is the main cause of oral infection, affecting the mouth and lips, while HSV-2 is mostly linked to genital herpes. It is estimated that approximately 45-98% of the world's population are seropositive for HSV-1, while about 7% are seropositive for HSV-2 (Fatahzadeh and Schwartz, 2007) . In the United States alone, about 40-63% of people are infected with HSV-1, and 16% are infected with HSV-2. The persistence of HSV-2 increases yearly, with 500,000 new cases in the United States (Fatahzadeh and Schwartz, 2007) .",

The HSV life cycle begins when viral glycoproteins bind host epithelial cellular receptors. The viral glycoprotein D (gD) is the main determinant of cellular binding and fusion (Spear et al., 2006) . Upon binding to a suitable host cell receptor such as nectin-1, nectin-2, herpes virus entry mediator (HVEM) or 3-O-sulfated (3-OS) heparan sulfate (HS), gD forms a fusion complex with gB, gH, and gL. This complex allows the viral envelope to fuse to the host cellular plasma membrane and consequently virus entry into the host cell (Spear et al., 2006; Subramanian and Geraghty, 2007) . Next, the viral nucleocapsid is transported to the host cell nucleus where viral replication and transcription takes place (Garner, 2003) . To outsmart the host's immune system, the virus also achieves latent stage by infecting neuronal cells. While latent, the virus is dormant until re-stimulated into the lytic cycle. In this way, HSV is able to propagate itself for the lifetime of the infected host (Kramer et al., 2003) .",

Previously, we have showed the antiviral efficacy of the major catechin constituent in green tea, Epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG) and its ester modification, palmitoyl-EGCG in combating HSV-1 infection in Vero cells (de Oliveira et al., 2013) . Crude black tea extract has also been shown to contain anti-herpesviral activity and theaflavins may be the major antiviral players (Cantatore et al., 2013) . Here, we want to determine the effect of purified individual black tea theaflavins against HSV-1 infection. Furthermore, theaflavins share many of the structural characteristics of green tea catechins, suggesting that it may also be an effective compound against HSV infections. Thus, application of these agents as natural topical remedy to prevent and treat HSV-1 infection and spreading is promising.",

Exposure to all concentrations of TF1, TF2, and TF3 inhibited cells proliferation by less than 1.85% in A549 cells.

TF3 did not show significant antiviral effect after the virus had already penetrated the cells, implying that this is a direct effect on the virions. Taken the fact that once in contact with an appropriate cell, HSV infections will readily persist, an effective microbicide should be able to target the virus prior to the first contact with the host cell. Thus, TF3 seems to be an ideal candidate to combat HSV prior to host cellular infection. Similar results were seen in a HIV-1 study, in which TF3 also targeted the viral entry step by disrupting the glycoprotein 41 6-HB core structure .",

As seen in all the antiviral assays conducted throughout the study, TF1, TF2, and TF3 inhibit HSV-1 at a dose-dependent manner. The plaque reduction assay, flow cytometric antiviral assay, and fluorescence confocal microscopy study, demonstrated that TF3 exhibits the strongest effect against HSV-1. The results suggest that TF3 should be further explored for the potential application in the management of HSV-1 infections.",

This high stability allows it to be a suitable topical antiviral agent in vaginal pH (Jhoo et al., 2005) . In addition, a recent study has shown that the combination of TF3 and lactic acid may be an effective way to inactivate HSV in the vaginal area, confirming the results seen here (Isaacs and Xu, 2013) . Finally, the current market anti-herpetic medications are highly costly, making TF3 a plausible, affordable solution for treatment and prevention of HSV infections. In conclusion, the use of TF3 against HSV-1 infections could have significant health benefits, and future studies should focus on better understanding the molecular mechanism by which theaflavins act against HSV-1 in animal models.",
