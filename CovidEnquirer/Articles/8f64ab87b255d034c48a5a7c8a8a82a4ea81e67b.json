            "text": "membranes (TGN) of Saccharomyces cerevisiae is conferred by targeting motifs containing aromatic residues in the cytosolic domains of these proteins. These signals could act by directing retrieval from a post-Golgi compartment or by preventing exit from the TGN. To investigate the mechanism of localization of yeast TGN proteins, we used the heterologous protein A-ALP (consisting of the cytosolic domain of dipeptidyl aminopeptidase A [DPAP A] fused to the transmembrane and luminal domains of the vacuolar protein alkaline phosphatase [ALP] ), which localizes to the yeast TGN. Insertion of the aromatic residue-based TGN localization motif (FXFXD) of DPAP A into the cytosolic domain of ALP results in a protein that resides in the TGN. We demonstrate that the FXFXD motif confers Golgi localization through retrieval from a post-Golgi compartment by detecting a post-Golgi processed form of this protein in the TGN. We present an assay that uncouples retrieval-mediated Golgi localization from static retention-based localization, allowing measurement of the rate at which proteins exit the yeast TGN. We also demonstrate that the cytosolic domain of DPAP A contains additional information, separate from the retrieval motif, that slows exit from the TGN. We propose a model for DPAP A localization that involves two distinct mechanisms: one in which the FXFXD motif directs retrieval from a post-Golgi compartment, and a second that slows the rate at which DPAP A exits the TGN.",

Transport of components between these organelles is achieved by means of vesicular transport, which results in a flow of membrane traffic throughout the pathway (Rothman, 1994) . To maintain its identity, an organelle must ensure that its resident proteins do not get swept with those proteins passing through en route to other destinations in the cell. To achieve this localization, resident proteins can either be retrieved once they have exited the organelle, or they may be prevented from ever leaving that organelle in the first place . These two mechanisms need not be mutually exclusive, since efficient localization of a protein to an organelle could arise through a combination of both mechanisms.",

In addition, it seems that the selection of cargo for entry into vesicles budding from the ER also plays an important role in the retention of proteins in this organelle (Schekman and Orci, 1996) . The mechanism for localization of proteins to the Golgi apparatus is less clearly understood, but it is likely that both modes of localization are at work. Studies on glycosyltransferases have shown that the transmembrane domains of these molecules are essential for Golgi localization in both yeast and mammalian cells (Munro, 1991; Nilsson et al., 1991; Machamer et al., 1993; Chapman and Munro, 1994; Graham and Krasnov, 1995; Lussier et al., 1995) . Current theories favor models in which the transmembrane domains prevent entry of resident proteins into transport vesicles. This may be achieved either by the formation of aggregates too large to enter transport vesicles (Swift and Machamer, 1991; Nilsson et al., 1993) or by exclusion of proteins from vesicles because of the length of their membrane spanning domain (Bretscher and Munro, 1993) . However, localization of the yeast glycosyltransferase, Och1p, which resides in the cis -Golgi, requires retrieval from a more distal Golgi compartment (Harris and Waters, 1996) .",

The resulting fusion protein, A-ALP, has served as a model TGN marker protein and has been used to show that a 10-residue segment (containing the motif FXFXD) within the cytosolic domain of DPAP A is critical for the protein's localization to Golgi membranes (Nothwehr et al., 1993) . Insertion of this motif into the cytosolic domain of ALP (RS-ALP; retention sequence ALP) results in a protein that colocalizes with Kex2p in the yeast TGN (Nothwehr et al., 1993) . Mutagenesis of the FXFXD motif leads to delivery of the protein to the vacuole (Nothwehr et al., 1993) , an observation that contributed to the formulation of a model of how proteins are retained in the S. cerevisiae TGN (Nothwehr and Stevens, 1994; Nothwehr et al., 1995) . In this model, proteins continually leave the Golgi and enter a late endosomal/prevacuolar compartment (PVC), from which they are retrieved back to the Golgi apparatus after recognition of the FXFXD motif.",

Mutational analysis identified the aromatic residue-containing motif, FXFXD, as being essential for the localization of the fusion protein A-ALP (consisting of the cytosolic domain of DPAP A fused to the transmembrane and luminal domains of ALP) to the yeast TGN. Forms of the A-ALP protein lacking this signal (such as (F/A)A-ALP, in which the two phenylalanine residues have been mutated to alanines) fail to be retained in the Golgi complex and are delivered to the vacuole Wilcox et al., 1992; Cooper and Bussey, 1992) . Delivery of proteins containing the luminal domain of ALP to the vacuole can be monitored by detecting a vacuolar protease-dependent (PEP4-dependent) cleavage, which results in the production of a lower molecular weight form of the protein (Klionsky and Emr, 1989; Nothwehr et al., 1993) . Whereas ALP is delivered to the vacuole and processed with a half-time of \u03fd10 min (Klionsky and Emr, 1989) , A-ALP is localized to the TGN and does not undergo any significant processing (Nothwehr et al., 1993) . Insertion of the FXFXD motif into the cytosolic domain of ALP causes the protein RS-ALP to be retained in the TGN, as determined by indirect immunofluorescence (Nothwehr et al., 1993) . Like A-ALP, RS-ALP has been shown to colocalize with the TGN protein Kex2p (Nothwehr et al., 1993) , but RS-ALP undergoes PEP4-dependent proteolytic cleavage with a half-time of 90 min in wild-type cells, whereas A-ALP does not undergo proteolysis, even after chase times of up to 2 h (Fig. 1 B) . These data indicate that even though RS-ALP localizes to the TGN in the steady state, it becomes exposed to vacuolar proteases in a post-Golgi compartment.",

To test this possibility, we separated yeast membranes by sucrose density gradient centrifugation. Membranes from cell lysates were sedi-mented at 13,000 g to obtain a membrane pellet containing ER, vacuolar, mitochondrial, and plasma membranes (Paravicini et al., 1992; Piper et al., 1994) . The resulting supernatant was subjected to centrifugation at 100,000 g, and the resulting membrane pellet (containing \u202b%01\u0641\u202c of the total cellular Vph1p and 80-90% of the total cellular Pep12p, Kex2p, and A-ALP or RS-ALP) was resuspended and loaded on a 20-50% sucrose gradient. In this gradient, the residual vacuolar membranes, defined by Vph1p (Manolson et al., 1992; Piper et al., 1994) , and prevacuolar membranes, defined by Pep12p (Becherer et al., 1996; Piper, R.C., and T.H. Stevens, unpublished results) , were found at the top of the gradient (fractions 1-4, Fig. 2 A) . By con- ]methionine for 10 min and chased by adding unlabeled methionine and cysteine each to a final concentration of 50 g/ml. At the indicated times, the cells were spheroplasted and extracts were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody against ALP, followed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The product of the initial PEP4-dependent proteolysis is indicated by a single asterisk, with a double asterisk indicating a further breakdown product of this primary product. This breakdown pattern differs from that seen for A-ALP (which has only one PEP4-dependent breakdown product, e.g., Fig. 6 ), but clearly both of the lower bands shown here are produced in a PEP4-dependent manner. trast, TGN membrane proteins (A-ALP and Kex2p) fractionated near the bottom of the gradient. Both the processed and unprocessed forms of RS-ALP also cofractionated with Kex2p in the TGN membrane fractions (Fig. 2 B) . These data indicate that RS-ALP has reached a post-Golgi compartment containing activated vacuolar proteases, and has been retrieved back to the TGN.",

One possibility, suggested by the observation that (F/A)A-ALP is processed with a half-time of 60 min while ALP is processed with a half-time of \u03fd10 min (Nothwehr et al., 1993; Klionsky and Emr, 1989) , is that the cytosolic tail of DPAP A contains a second signal, not present in RS-ALP, that slows its exit from the TGN. To test this hypothesis, we designed an assay to estimate the rate of exit of membrane proteins from the TGN. The assay is based on measuring the rate of proteolytic processing of TGN proteins in vps27 mutant cells, since these proteins accumulate in the class E compartment and this compartment contains activated vacuolar proteases (Raymond et al., 1992; Piper et al., 1995) . Therefore, we predict that proteins that exit the TGN slowly will exhibit long half-times for proteolytic processing in vps27 Figure 2 . Sucrose gradient fractionation of A-ALP/RS-ALP containing membranes. High speed pellet membrane fractions (100,000 g) were prepared from 100 OD units of SNY36-9A cells harboring either pSN55 (A-ALP) or pSN97 (RS-ALP). These membranes were fractionated by a 20-50% sucrose density step gradient. After centrifugation, 14 \u03eb 1-ml fractions were collected from the top of the gradient, and the proteins were precipitated by the addition of TCA. Equal percentages of each fraction were subjected to immunoblot analysis after SDS-PAGE to detect the following proteins: A-ALP/RS-ALP using an anti-ALP mAb (1D3-A10); Kex2p was used as a marker protein for TGN membranes and detected using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies; anti-Vph1p mAb 10D7-A7-B2 was used to detect Vph1p as a marker protein for vacuolar membranes; and Pep12p, a marker protein for membranes of the prevacuolar compartment, was detected using affinity-purified polyclonal antibodies. mutant cells whether or not they are competent to be retrieved to the TGN. By contrast, proteins that exit rapidly from the TGN would be rapidly proteolytically processed in vps27 mutant cells independently of their potential to be retrieved.",

To gain further insight into Vps10p, we also determined processing rates for the recycling-defective form of Vps10p (Vps10p-10*), which lacks the cytosolic domain but otherwise binds CPY precursor (proCPY) normally (Cereghino et al., 1995; Cooper and Stevens, 1996) . Whereas Vps10p was very stable in wildtype cells, Vps10p-10* was cleaved by vacuolar proteases with a half-time of \u202b02\u0641\u202c min ( Fig. 6 and Table III) . Interestingly, both Vps10p and Vps10p-10* were proteolyzed with a half-time of \u202b02\u0641\u202c min in vps27 mutant cells, suggesting that Vps10p exits the TGN rapidly, independently of the presence of the recycling/retrieval signal in the cytosolic domain. Rapid exit from the TGN by Vps10p is consistent with its function as the CPY sorting receptor, binding proCPY in the TGN and releasing it in the PVC before recycling back for more rounds of vacuolar hydrolase sorting.",

This retrieval requires Vps27p, and in vps27\u232c cells, TGN membrane proteins accumulate in an exaggerated form of the PVC, the class E compartment (Raymond et al., 1992; Piper et al., 1995) . The class E compartment is proteolytically active, and the rate at which proteolytically sensitive proteins are processed in vps27\u232c cells can be used to measure the rate at which they enter this compartment. This is the basis for the assay to measure the leaving rates of A-ALP-and Vps10p-related proteins from the TGN.

At time t \u03ed 0, galactose was added to a final concentration of 2%, and cells were allowed to grow for an additional 90 min. At times t \u03ed 0 (\u03ea galactose) and t \u03ed 90 min (\u03e9 galactose), samples were removed and treated in the following ways (also see Fig. 5 ): (A) Whole-cell extracts were prepared from 10 OD units of NBY67 cells harboring pSN97 and pHY5 or empty vector to detect the presence of Vps27p using immunoblot analysis (similar results were obtained using the same cells harboring either pSN55 or pSN100 in conjunction with pHY5; data not shown); and (B) 0.5 OD units of cells were radiolabeled to determine whether the cells were secreting CPY.",

Yeast cells carrying a temperature-sensitive allele of VPS27 accumulate Vps10p rapidly into the PVC upon shift to 37\u040aC, and this protein redistributes to Golgi membranes once cells are returned to the permissive temperature (Piper et al., 1995) . The rapid onset of the transport defect in vps27-ts cells allowed us to monitor the rate at which A-ALP, RS-ALP, and Vps10p enter the exaggerated PVC. When vps27-ts cells were maintained at 22\u040aC, indirect immunofluorescence revealed (Fig. 7) that A-ALP, RS-ALP, and Vps10p exhibited staining patterns typical of Golgi membrane proteins (5-10 dispersed dots) in a vast majority of the cells (\u03fe90%). 10 min after shifting vps27-ts cells to 37\u040aC, both RS-ALP and Vps10p had redistributed to the exaggerated PVC, yet A-ALP staining appeared Golgilike as long as 60-120 min after the temperature shift. These immunofluorescence data support the conclusion that exit from the TGN is the rate-limiting step for A-ALP processing in vps27 mutant cells. Therefore, by both pulsechase and indirect immunofluorescence analyses, A-ALP has been shown to exit the TGN more slowly than RS-ALP and Vps10p.",

To determine whether tail sequences are responsible for slowing the exit of A-ALP from the TGN, a series of deletions was made in the 118-amino acid cytosolic tail of Ste13p in the context of A-ALP (Fig. 1 A) . The proteolytic processing rates of a number of mutated A-ALP fusion proteins were determined in both wild-type and vps27 mutant cells (Table III and Fig. 1) . The A-ALP protein lacking the first 50 amino acids of the DPAP A cytosolic domain ((\u232c2-51)A-ALP), which localizes to the TGN (Nothwehr et al., 1993; our unpublished results) , was found to behave like RS-ALP. (\u232c2-51)A-ALP was processed with a half-time of 85 min in wild-type cells and \u202b51\u0641\u202c min in vps27 cells (Table  III) , indicating that it exits the Golgi rapidly and achieves its Golgi localization through retrieval alone. By contrast, (\u232c68-106)A-ALP behaved just like (F/A)A-ALP in that it localized to vacuolar membranes (Nothwehr et al., 1993; our unpublished results) and was processed with halftimes of \u202b56-06\u0641\u202c min in both wild-type and vps27 mutant cells ( Fig. 8 and Table III) presumably since it contains information to slow exit from the TGN.

The first is the well-characterized motif containing aromatic amino acid residues (FXFXD in DPAP A), which functions in retrieval from the prevacuolar compartment (PVC) back to the TGN.

However, subcellular fractionation of membranes from wild-type yeast cells expressing RS-ALP (ALP containing FXFXD) revealed that the vacuolar protease-activated form of RS-ALP cofractionated with the TGN membrane protein Kex2p. These data demonstrate that the FXFXD retention motif of DPAP A functions as a retrieval signal, and that RS-ALP was exposed to active vacuolar proteases in a post-Golgi compartment and then retrieved back to the TGN. Further evidence for the involvement of the FXFXD motif in retrieval from the PVC comes from our data that this motif is required to specify redistribution of A-ALP from the class E compartment (exaggerated PVC) to Golgi membranes after induction of Vps27p synthesis, an experiment that also indicates that the Golgi localization of A-ALP involves retrieval from the PVC.",

            "text": "To determine the molecular basis for the half-time of delivery of (F/A)A-ALP to the vacuole \u202b06\u0641(\u202c min) being so much slower than for ALP \u202b01-5\u0641(\u202c min), we investigated whether there was additional localization information in the DPAP A cytosolic domain. vps27 mutant cells, in which TGN membrane proteins accumulate in a proteolytically active class E compartment (exaggerated PVC; Piper et al., 1995) , were used to estimate whether the various A-ALP fusion proteins were all delivered to the PVC at the same rate. Based on proteolytic processing of the lumenal (COOH-terminal) propeptide of ALP, these studies revealed that A-ALP and (F/A)A-ALP were delivered to the PVC with a half-time of \u202b06\u0641\u202c min, while RS-ALP and (\u232c2-51)A-ALP exhibited half-times of \u202b02-51\u0641\u202c min. These data indicate that there is information in the NH 2 -terminal 50 amino acids of the DPAP A cytosolic domain that confers the slower rate of delivery of the A-ALP fusion proteins to the PVC, and that this rate is independent of the presence or absence of the aromatic amino acid-based retrieval motif located elsewhere (FXFXD, amino acids 85-89) in the cytosolic domain. Since all our data indicate that the A-ALP fusion proteins are delivered rapidly to the Golgi (A-ALP receives Golgi modifications with similar kinetics to ALP; Bryant, N.J., and T.H. Stevens, unpublished results), the slow rate of transport of A-ALP (and (F/A) A-ALP) to the PVC reflects a slow rate of exit from the TGN. Vps10p, the CPY sorting receptor, is a yeast TGN membrane protein that was found to be delivered rapidly to the PVC (half-time of \u202b02-51\u0641\u202c min). As with A-ALP, the rate of Vps10p delivery to the PVC was independent of the presence or absence (Vps10p-10*) of the Tyr-based retrieval motif. Therefore, Vps10p exits the Golgi at a rapid rate and achieves Golgi localization through retrieval, whereas DPAP A contains both retrieval and static retention signals. Such a result is consistent with the biological functions of the two proteins. DPAP A is involved in the processing of the mating pheromone \u2423-factor precursor as this polyprotein passes through the Golgi apparatus before its packaging into secretory vesicles (Sprague and Thorner, 1992) . By contrast, Vps10p must continuously cycle between the Golgi and the PVC, binding proCPY in the Golgi and releasing it in the PVC before recycling back to the Golgi to bind more ligand (Cereghino et al., 1995; Cooper and Stevens, 1996) . It is thus easy to rationalize the rapid TGN exit rate of Vps10p and the rather slow rate of DPAP A. Consistent with this interpretation are the observations that overexpression of Vps10p leads to processing of A-ALP in wild-type cells, yet the rate of processing of A-ALP in vps27\u232c cells is unaffected by overexpression of Vps10p (Bryant, N.J., and T.H. Stevens, unpublished results) . These observations suggest that Vps10p and A-ALP compete for the retrieval machinery but not for entry into TGN-derived vesicles bound for the PVC.",

While we cannot as yet rule out the possibility that RS-ALP is retrieved from the vacuole itself, it is most likely that both RS-ALP and A-ALP are transported to and retrieved from the same PVC, and that this compartment contains low levels of activated vacuolar proteases en route to the vacuole. Evidence for low levels of activated vacuolar proteases in the yeast late-endosomal/ prevacuolar compartment comes from the work of Schimmoller and Riezman, 1993, indicating that \u2423-factor endocytosed into late endosomes encounters proteases. There is abundant evidence from mammalian cells that hydrolases are distributed throughout the endocytic pathway (Blum et al., 1991) . If RS-ALP and A-ALP are in fact retrieved from the same PVC, then the failure to detect proteolytic processing of A-ALP must reflect its very slow exit rate from the TGN, thus reducing the time A-ALP spends in the PVC compared to RS-ALP. If RS-ALP is being retrieved from the same PVC as Vps10p, then the differential rate of proteolysis between these two proteins in wild-type cells may reflect a differential susceptibility to the low levels of proteases in the PVC.",

            "text": "The data presented in this paper indicate that DPAP A requires both static retention and retrieval for efficient localization to the yeast TGN. It remains to be determined whether the two other TGN proteins that have been identified (Kex1p and Kex2p) also contain signals to slow their exit from the TGN. We propose that the NH 2 terminus of DPAP A serves to keep this protein anchored in the TGN membrane, and that this protein only occasionally exits the Golgi apparatus (half-time of \u202b06\u0641\u202c min). Molecules of DPAP A that enter the PVC are efficiently recognized by virtue of the FXFXD motif and are recycled back to the TGN. Some proteins, such as the CPY sorting receptor Vps10p, are only retained in the TGN by retrieval because they must continually cycle between the TGN and PVC to fulfill their function in the cell.",

We are currently investigating whether the Grd proteins are involved in recognition of either the static or retrieval signals in the cytosolic domain of DPAP A. Figure 8 . Kinetics of processing of (\u232c2-11)A-ALP and (\u232c68-106)A-ALP in wild-type and vps27\u232c cells. SNY36-9A (wild-type) and NBY60 (vps27\u232c) cells harboring either pNB81 ((\u232c2-11)A-ALP) or pSN27 ((\u232c68-106)A-ALP) were labeled with [ 35 S]methionine for 10 min and chased by adding unlabeled methionine and cysteine, each to a final concentration of 50 g/ml. At the indicated times, the cells were spheroplasted, and the extracts were immunoprecipitated with a polyclonal antibody against ALP, followed by SDS-PAGE and fluorography. The products of PEP4-dependent proteolysis are indicated using asterisks, as described in Fig. 1. ",
