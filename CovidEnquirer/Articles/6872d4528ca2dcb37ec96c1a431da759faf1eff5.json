Human population growth has negatively impacted both these requirements, resulting in a decline in all felid species worldwide in range and number. Felidae are among the most threatened groups of mammals. Larger species are heavily persecuted because of the danger they pose to humans and livestock. Small cat species are also persecuted and are harvested for the fur trade. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) Red List designates 29 of 36 wild felid species as having a decreasing population trend. Nearly 50% of all felid species are listed in the top three threatened categories, and seven of these species are listed as Critically Endangered or Endangered. Felids characterized as threatened are those that appear to be naturally rare with limited distribution or those that have become threatened because of human factors. The Iberian lynx, listed as Critically Endangered, fits into both categories and may become the first cat species to become extinct in modern times. 23, 31 ",

            "text": "The anatomy of nondomestic felids is similar to that of the domestic cat. Sexual dimorphism is limited with males generally 5% to 10% larger than females. There are 28 or 30 teeth with the following dental formula: incisors (I) 3/3, canines (C) 1/1, premolars (P) 2-3/2, molars (M) 1/1. The incisors are small and are used for nipping flesh from carcasses. Canines are long with a length-wise groove in the enamel and are used to kill prey. The fourth upper premolars (carnassial teeth) are used to slice meat. The reduced dentition allows for a reduced length of the skull and mandibles, which improves efficiency of the muscles that close the jaw. Cats have a more powerful bite relative to muscle mass than any other carnivore except mustelids. Because of their carnivorous diet, cats have a shorter digestive tract with a smaller cecum and a short large intestine. 31 The forelimbs are used for locomotion and prey capture. To grasp prey, supination of the paw is needed. This increased mobility of the elbow and wrist joints affects running. Canids run faster as they have stiffer forelimbs. The hindlimbs are the propulsers, and the reduction or loss of a clavicle increases stride length. Cats are digitigrade, with five toes in the front and four in the back. The first digit on the front foot is the dewclaw. All felids have retractable claws, the exception being the cheetah, in which retraction is less developed. Cheetahs lack the fleshy sheath protecting the claw. 31 A key characteristic that was used to separate the big cats (Pantherinae) from the small cats (Felinae) is the presence of an elastic ligament in the hyoid apparatus below the tongue, which was thought to allow the big cats to roar but not purr. Conversely, the bony hyoid of the small cats was thought to allow them to purr but not roar. More recent studies comparing the hyoid structure and vocal abilities dispute this correlation. It has been found that the main difference between the roaring, nonpurring cats and the others was the presence of long, fleshy, elastic vocal folds within the larynx of big cats that resonate to produce a roar. Smaller cats and cheetahs have simpler vocal folds that only allow purring. 31 Nondomestic felids appear to have an AB blood group system similar to that described in domestic cats. Cross-matching of donor and recipients using standard techniques is important before the administration of transfusions or blood products. 36 ",

Additional enclosure features recommended may vary by species and include a vertical component, elevated resting platforms, a heat source, shade, logs or wooden posts to sharpen claws, a visual barrier for cats to hide behind, a den or secure area, varied topography, water features for bathing and swimming, and a shift or secondary holding area to safely move animals from their primary enclosure for cleaning, feeding, or medical procedures. To reduce the incidence of osteoarthritis and pad ulceration, large felids should not be housed for long periods on concrete. Natural substrates or platforms with some flexibility that may be cleaned and disinfected should be provided. 36 Appropriate safety precautions must be designed into the enclosure and holding facilities to ensure employee and guest safety. These include, but are not limited to, using materials of sufficient strength, covering all openings with mesh or heavy glass, and ability to view all the cats within an enclosure from a safe position. Safety gates provide secondary containment if an animal escapes from the primary holding area. Flares, fire extinguishers, and sound generators may be placed throughout the work area to deter attacks. Keepers may be required to carry pepper spray and communication radios while working with large felids. Escape drills should be held routinely. 36 ",

            "text": "The diet of wild felids varies, depending on their sizes. The large cats such as lions and tigers prey on very large mammals, with only two to three species making up the bulk of their diet. Medium-sized felids such as the puma, the snow leopard, and the leopard eat smaller prey but a larger number of different species. The small felids prey on mammals, birds, reptiles, amphibians, and insects. All wild cats hunt and kill their own prey, but some will scavenge opportunistically. 31 Felids require a much higher proportion of protein in their diet compared with any other mammal, 12% for domestic cats compared with 4% for domestic dogs. 31 In captivity, a formal nutrition program is recommended to meet the nutritional and behavioral needs of all species. Diets should be developed on the basis of the recommendations of nutritionists such as the European Association of Zoos and Aquaria (EAZA) Nutrition Group or the Association of Zoos and Aquarium (AZA) Nutrition Advisory Group (NAG). The AZA-NAG feeding program guidelines suggest a feeding strategy that includes providing a diet that is nutritionally balanced, that reasonably stimulates natural feeding behaviors, that the animal consumes consistently, and that meets the above criteria and is practical and economical to feed. Domestic cats generally require 80 to 90 kilocalories per kilogram of body weight (BW) per day (kcal/kg/day) to meet metabolic requirements. Diet quantity needs to be altered on the basis of the animal' s body condition, life stage, and environmental factors. Most captive felids are fed commercial meat-based complete diets, so additional vitamin or mineral supplements, including calcium and taurine, should not be necessary. Techniques for proper thawing of frozen diets prior to feeding may be found in the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) guidelines on handling of frozen and thawed meat and prey items fed to captive exotic animals (http:// www.nal.usda.gov/awic/pubs/meatprey.pdf). Commercial diets may be supplemented with good-quality carcasses or whole-prey items. If muscle meats or organ meats make up the bulk of the diet, additional supplementation, including calcium, may be necessary. The majority of felids are able to handle the large concentrations of microorganisms present in raw meat. However, guidelines of appropriate bacterial concentrations in received commercial products need to be established for each institution, and commercial products should be tested on a regular basis. Bones may be offered to some species on fast days or twice weekly to promote oral health and to provide enrichment. Fresh water should be made available at all times.",

Heavy gloves may be used, but most felids are capable of biting through them. The majority of cats are darted or confined to a small area or restraint device and hand injected. Commercial squeeze cages are available for restraining and transporting larger felids and work best when incorporated into holding facilities (LGL Animal Care Products, Inc., Bryan, TX; Research Equipment Company, Bryan, TX). 36 ANESTHESIA A variety of drug combinations have been used safely to induce anesthesia in felids (Table 47 -2). In general, smaller species require a higher dosage of anesthetics compared with larger species on the basis of kilogram of body weight, and free-living individuals may require higher dosages compared with their captive counterparts. The drug combinations most often used include a dissociative (ketamine or tiletamine), and an \u03b1 2 -agonist (xylazine, medetomidine, or dexmedetomidine), benzodiazepine (diazepam, zolazepam, or midazolam), opioid (butorphanol), or a combination of these. These drugs may be antagonized with yohimbine (0.04 to 0.3 milligram per kilogram [mg/kg], intramuscularly [IM] or intravenously [IV; slow]), atipamezole (0.1 to 0.45 mg/kg, IM), naltrexone (0.05-0.25 mg/kg, IM or IV), and flumazenil (0.01-0.02 mg/kg, IV or IM). Tiletamine and zolazepam (Telazol, Fort Dodge, Fort Dodge, IA) may be used safely in many felids but should be used with caution in tigers. Adverse reactions, including death and neurologic disease (seizures, ataxia), have been anecdotally reported; but controlled studies are lacking. Regurgitation or vomiting during induction or recovery may occur when \u03b1 2 -agonists are used. Food should be withheld from adult felids for 12 to 24 hours and water for several hours prior to anesthesia to decrease the chances of regurgitation and aspiration during induction and recovery. Species-specific protocols have been reported. 5, 10, 18, 28, 29, 38 Anesthesia may be maintained with supplemental ketamine (IV or IM), propofol (IV), or inhalant anesthesia (sevoflurane, isoflurane, ",

Many healthy felids are seropositive for Toxoplasma gondii antibodies. Kittens and immunocompromised animals may develop acute generalized toxoplasmosis. High neonatal mortality in Pallas' cats from toxoplasmosis has hampered conservation efforts. Prophylactic treatment of breeding animals and neonates is recommended. Cytauxzoon felis is a protozoan that infects blood cells. 4, 12, 24, 41 It is transmitted by the lone star tick (Amblyomma americanum). The natural reservoir is the bobcat that becomes a persistent carrier after developing mild or subclinical infection. The disease may be fatal in untreated domestic cats, and a fatal infection in a white tiger has been reported. Babesia felis, originally identified in wild cats from Sudan, has been reported sporadically from various countries. 1,4,20,24,41 South Africa appears to be the only country where feline babesiosis is a significant clinical entity. The infection is assumed to be tickborne, but the vector has not been identified. Concurrent infections may contribute to clinical disease. Ascarids (Toxocara and Toxascaris) are common in captive animals and may be difficult to eliminate. The ova are highly resistant in the environment. Repeated testing and treatment of animals while in quarantine may prevent the introduction of ascarids into exhibits. In chronically infected cats, routine treatment may be needed to limit worm burdens. Disease caused by Dirofilaria immitis (heartworm) has been diagnosed in a black-footed cat. 8 Prophylactic treatment is recommended in endemic areas.",

Focal palantine erosions have been reported in 15 wild and captive species but is more prevalent in captive animals. 42 Degenerative joint disease and spondylosis are common in geriatric felids, especially the larger species. 19 Chronic renal failure is common in geriatric felids. 37 Renal amyloidosis is particularly common in black-footed cats and cheetahs. 34 Veno-occlusive disease is a slowly progressive liver disease, which results in the fibrosis of the hepatic sinusoids or veins and eventually occlusion of the vessels. It has been reported in cheetahs and snow leopards. Myelopathy has been diagnosed in cheetahs in Europe, and leukoencephalopathy has been diagnosed in cheetahs in North America. 27 Pyometra has been reported in lions, tigers, and a leopard. 21 Lions seem to be at an increased risk for developing pyometra compared with other species. Ovariohysterectomy may be warranted in nonbreeding female lions. The use of progestin-based contraceptives has been associated with endometrial hyperplasia and uterine and mammary adenocarcinoma. Nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) should be used cautiously. Aspirin, acetaminophen, and ibuprofen may cause toxicity, and caution is advised when using other formulations such as carprofen, deracoxib, naproxen, etodolac, and indomethacin. Meloxicam has been used in nondomestic felids with no reported adverse effects. 25 Barbiturate and thiafentanil toxicity has been reported in felids fed carcasses of animals that had been euthanized or anesthetized with these agents.",

The occurrence varies across species and between individuals within a species. It occurs frequently in clouded leopards, fishing cats, and margays but rarely in cheetahs, tigrinas, and ocelots. Pallas' cats are very sensitive to photoperiod; tigers, clouded leopards, and snow leopards are moderately affected; and ocelots, tigrinas, margays, lions, leopards, and fishing cats are not influenced by photoperiod. Clouded leopards and Pallas' cats exhibit seasonality in gonadal activity, but margays, cheetahs, and oncillas cycle year round. Suppressed ovarian activity and estrus occurs in cats housed in a group (e.g., cheetahs). All cats have a zonal placentation. 2, 3 Many felid species do not reproduce well in captivity. Assisted reproductive techniques such as artificial insemination are important for managing zoo species. 14, 32 This technique is challenged by the variable responses to ovulation induction therapies. Fecal cortisol may be measured and reflects the adrenal status and stress levels of animals managed under different husbandry conditions. These data improve the understanding of how social and environmental factors affect the well-being and reproductive fitness of animals. Contraception of felids is sometimes necessary to facilitate management needs or because of concerns over the health of the animals. ",

Many institutions perform examinations under anesthesia every 2 to 4 years, but this frequency is dependent on the individual animal' s age, life stage, health status and medical history, and species and the resources and philosophy of the holding institution. Animals that are trained as part of an operant conditioning program may be visually examined, have blood collected, and receive vaccinations without anesthesia or the need for remote delivery equipment. These examinations may be substituted for one under anesthesia in many cases if dental examination and prophylaxis and thorough palpation are deemed unnecessary. Routine health examination should include an assessment of body condition, body weight determination, complete physical examination, evaluation for ectoparasites (ticks, fleas, flies), blood collection for complete blood cell (CBC) count with manual differential and hemoparasite examination, serum biochemical panel, and serum for banking. Recommended serologic tests include those for feline leukemia virus (FeLV) and feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV). Additional tests that may be necessary based on species, geographic location, or potential for disease exposure include those for Toxoplasma gondii, feline coronavirus (FCoV), and canine heartworm (Dirofilaria immitis). Serologic tests to monitor response to vaccination may be useful for feline parvovirus (FPV), especially in cheetahs, and for the rabies virus. 26 Vaccine titers for feline herpesvirus (FHV) or feline calicivirus (FCV) are predictive of protection, except for highly susceptible species such as cheetahs. If a cheetah has a low or negative titer to FPV or FHV, more frequent vaccination should be considered. Urinalysis should be performed, if possible. Survey radiography and abdominal ultrasonography may be valuable if resources are available to establish reference information or to diagnose occult conditions. Fecal examination for parasites is recommended at this time if a regular program for parasite surveillance (once to twice yearly) is not already in place.",
