Colonization of Sprague-Dawley rat dam and fetal tissues by M pulmonis occurred in a dose-dependent manner after intravenous inoculation (P \u03fd .001). Placental lesion severity increased with infection dose (P \u03ed .0001). The minimum threshold dose required to establish infection of the dam and fetus was at least 10 3 colony forming units, with consistent colonization of maternal and fetal tissues achieved only with 10 7 colony forming units. In some instances, rat fetal tissues could be colonized in the absence of concomitant amniotic fluid colonization. Interestingly, there appeared to be a predilection for colonization of the reproductive tissues.",

Our data support the concept that hematogenous spread of M pulmonis to the rat fetus can occur without amniotic fluid infection and suggest that the fetus itself can potentially seed the amniotic fluid with microorganisms. Importantly, manipulation of both the route of infection as well as infection dose provide a reproducible way to study both maternal and fetal immune response to infection during pregnancy.

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] For the most part, intrauterine infections are clinically si-lent and are difficult to study, except with retrospective analysis. Therefore, development and characterization of appropriate animal models are critical to understand the causal relationship between infection and adverse outcomes. To elucidate the mechanisms and sequence of events by which bacterial pathogens cause adverse effects, a good animal model should use a natural disease that occurs in the model species, the infection should be easy to establish, the natural course of the disease should be similar to that in humans, and there should be a solid database of normal physiology.",

To calculate the number of animals required to detect a true dose effect, a power analysis was performed and the desired significance level (\u2423) was set at .05, power was set at 0.8, and the difference to detect between groups was set at 80%. By using a power chart for a variance of 1, a sample size of 6 falls between a power value of 0.8 to 0.92. By using these parameters, 5-6 animals per group would be the maximum required. A minimum of 5 animals was included in each treatment group, except the low-and high-dose groups. In accordance with the mandate of the Animal Welfare Act, we reduced the number of animals used at the highest and lowest infection dose.

            "text": "Interestingly, in the SD rat model, the respiratory sites were colonized infrequently during pregnancy. Conversely, the uterus and vagina were colonized by M pulmonis in all dams at the 10 7 dose. This strongly suggests that there is an affinity for infection of the reproductive tract vs the respiratory tract after IV inoculation of pregnant rats. One explanation for this result may be the increased vascularization of the reproductive tract during gestation. Increased vascularization may more easily allow the microorganism to access and adhere in these regions. These tissues also may be enriched for nutrients that would favor the growth of M pulmonis. The tropism of M pulmonis for the reproductive tissues appears to be pregnancy-specific; in a previous study M pulmonis was recovered from the trachea in 35 of 36 naturally infected nonpregnant rats but was isolated from the uterus of only 17 of these same rats. 21 Further, in rats experimentally infected in the vagina before breeding, the reproductive tissues were more commonly colonized than the trachea once pregnancy was established. 22, 25, 26 The current paradigm is that infectious agents colonize the placenta, breach the placental barrier, and infect the AF, thereby gaining access to the fetus directly or via hematogenous spread from the placenta. 28, 30 Our results strongly support the concept that the SD rat fetuses may have been directly infected via the labyrinthian circulation. We observed that hematogenous spread of M pulmonis from the infected placenta to the fetus can occur without AF infection, and that, in some cases, the fetus itself could potentially seed the AF with microorganisms. This is consistent with some models proposed for human fetal infections that suggest the most severe consequences of intrauterine infection occur when the infectious agent colonizes the placenta and then is transported to the AF and fetus via hematogenous spread from the placenta. 1, [29] [30] [31] One drawback of the IV model is that establishment of infection is not the same as in naturally occurring disease. Although the vaginal model of infection is a more natural method of causing intrauterine infection, it also has limitations such as increased time to establish infection and uncertainty of level of infection. In addition, significant intrauterine infection is seen only in animals infected before breeding rather than at time points throughout gestation. [20] [21] [22] The IV model is more useful for studying acute, temporal effects of infection, whereas the vaginal infection model is better suited for chronic situations. Studies focused on mechanisms of low birthweight would be more appropriate for the vaginal model 20 as acute infection established in IV-infected rats did not result in low birthweight. An additional limitation of the model is that the use of M pulmonis rather than U parvum/urealyticum precludes addressing microbespecific factors that may be involved in pathogenesis. This is somewhat analogous to other models, for example, that use purified LPS rather than live Gramnegative microbes for infection studies or that use of in vitro cell lines rather than whole animal studies; these models still provide critical insights into pathogenesis. The IV rodent model described here has provided important insights into lesion formation, mechanisms of fetal colonization, and fetal and maternal immune response. Although no animal model can be directly applicable to human disease, the similarities between human and rodent mycoplasmal genital infection (inflammatory cytokines present in AF, placental lesions, and the clinical presentation of poor pregnancy outcome) argue that the rodent model is appropriate. Further, manipulation of both the route of infection as well as infection dose provide a reproducible way to study both maternal and fetal immune response to infection during pregnancy. ",
