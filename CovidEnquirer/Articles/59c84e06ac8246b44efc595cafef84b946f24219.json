Perspectives were sought from key decision-makers and clinical staff about the factors perceived to promote and inhibit effective and rapid control of the outbreak. setting A large teaching tertiary healthcare centre in KSA; the outbreak lasted 6 weeks from June 2015. Participants Data were collected via individual and focus group interviews with 28 key informant participants (9 management decision-makers and 19 frontline healthcare workers). Design We used qualitative methods of process evaluation to examine perceptions of the outbreak and the factors contributing to, or detracting from successful management. Data were analysed using qualitative thematic content analysis. results Five themes and 15 subthemes were found. The themes were related to: (1) the high stress of the outbreak, (2) factors perceived to contribute to outbreak occurrence, (3) factors perceived to contribute to success of outbreak control, (4) factors inhibiting outbreak control and (5) long-term institutional gains in response to the outbreak management. Conclusion Management of the MERS-CoV outbreak at King Abdulaziz Medical City-Riyadh was widely recognised by staff as a serious outbreak of local and national significance. While the outbreak was controlled successfully in 6 weeks, progress in management was inhibited by a lack of institutional readiness to implement infection control (IC) measures and reduce patient flow, low staff morale and high anxiety. Effective management was promoted by greater involvement of all staff in sharing learning and knowledge of the outbreak, developing trust and teamwork and harnessing collective leadership. Future major IC crises could be improved via measures to strengthen these areas, better coordination of media management and proactive staff counselling and support.",

Successful management of MERS-CoV outbreaks is very challenging because the infection occurs most commonly in healthcare workers (HCWs) 2 but knowledge of both the causes of the virus and its treatment is still limited.

A comprehensive objective analysis of this outbreak 10 identified that one third of infection cases were in HCWs, with about half of these cases (54%) occurring in ED staff (mean age: 37 years; 77% female) with no deaths. 10 Infected patients (non-HCWs) had a median age of 66 years; 65% male. 10 Symptom onset in the last infected case was 28 August 2015; the end of the outbreak was on 28 June 2015 10 following two 14-day incubation periods without new cases Despite the severe and widespread risks that MERS-CoV poses, little research on the virus exists to guide its management in crises situations. While health professionals' perceptions of risk 12 and psychological reactions 13 to similar respiratory viruses have been explored, to our knowledge, this is the first study of stakeholder perspectives of the factors promoting and inhibiting effective infection management of a widespread MERS-CoV outbreak. Generated from the world's second largest recorded outbreak of MERS-CoV to date, this study examines key stakeholder perspectives of the factors promoting and inhibiting effective IC. As an intense study of a single 'complex' outbreak, this research seeks to provide useful lessons for the management of future similar outbreaks.",

Participants concurred with the proposed results. Peer debriefing was used in which a second researcher analysed a random selection of interviews to ensure themes were understandable. No major changes to the analysis arose from this debriefing. In addition to the IDEP plan, which was established in 2013 with the detailed MERS-CoV flowcharts, a more strict and explicit triage process was established to ensure early identification of suspected MERS-CoV cases. This was added as the first layer of the patient triage process and implemented in the newly established drive-through system to the ED, and at the entrances of the ACC. Once a patient has entered the main ER, a second screening would take place to identify any possible cases that may have been missed by the first process. Two new teams were formed: CMT, a medical team managing all admitted patients with respiratory illness and CPRT, an outreach team responsible to ensure proper location, testing, transfer, discharge and consultation for suspected and confirmed MERS cases.",

Frontline HCWs and senior decision-makers alike not only perceived this high gravity, but also experienced extremely high and diverse demands personally (a very demanding situation).

Indeed, poor recognition of the importance of IPC principles across the organisation was perceived to be compounded by the high demands placed on the ED by the large patient population. Other more upstream factors seen to contribute to the outbreak included: high trust patients had for the National Guard Health Affairs, the relative lack of primary care services, problems associated with patient flow across the city, poor communication and teamwork between the city hospitals, and a lack of pre-emptive national planning to allow hospitals across different sectors to share the burden of the growing city population.",

Indeed, managers were seen to have focused on empowering HCWs to work collaboratively to address the outbreak, involving staff in outbreak control and stimulating staff resilience and teamwork. In this way, the dominant culture was perceived by staff to be one of collective leadership practice (table 1) with leaders being seen to have practiced high levels of availability, visibility, empowerment of middle management and strong links with frontline staff during the height of the outbreak.",

As these events are also complex, 18 qualitative as well as quantitative research 10 is useful for generating insights and lessons to inform future outbreak control. 18 Useful lessons gleaned from this study of MERS-CoV crisis management (table 3) concur with other research. It is not just the actions of HCWs and decision-makers that contributed to successful management, but also the mutual trust that accrues via the delegation of responsibilities, team management, coordination, tasks distribution, role clarification and communication. 19 20 This reflects the practice of collective leadership-defined as 'a dynamic leadership process in which defined leaders, or set of leaders, selectively utilize skills and expertise within a network, effectively distributing elements of the leadership role as the situation or problem at hand requires'. 21 This research corroborates other work identifying that a number of different strands of management contribute to success, particularly, the benefits of centralised yet inclusive meetings during which senior decision-makers and frontline HCWs share knowledge and learning 22 from different parts of the organisation. [23] [24] [25] Other key lessons arising from this study arose from the weaknesses around the media management during the outbreak which in turn adversely affected reported staff morale and anxiety. 26 Such challenges are not unusual. 27 Large health institutions managing major crises should have a dedicated media centre or representative capable of implementing a well-designed and coordinated media crisis plan to aid communication, address questions and proactively act to protect the reputation of the organisation and its staff.",

As with other studies, 32 while independent researchers undertook the interviews, responses may have been influenced by perceived 'official' links between the project and the organisation. Staff perspectives may have also been influenced by the time duration since the outbreak was curtailed (around 8 months). We addressed these limitations through different data collection sources, member checking and data triangulation.",

While the outbreak was controlled successfully in 6 weeks, progress in management was inhibited by a lack of institutional readiness to implement IC measures and reduce patient flow, low staff morale and high anxiety. Effective management was promoted by greater involvement of all staff in sharing learning and knowledge of the outbreak, developing trust and team work and fostering collective leadership. Future major IC crises could be improved via measures to strengthen these areas, as well as better coordination of media management and proactive staff counselling and support.",
