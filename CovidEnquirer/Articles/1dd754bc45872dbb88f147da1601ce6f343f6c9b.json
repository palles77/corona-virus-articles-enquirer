Dietary treatments were control (no SDP) or SDP as powder or granular included in the pellet and fed continuously (d 0 to 35) or discontinued after d 14. During the experiment, broilers developed necrotic enteritis, and tissue cultures were positive for Escherichia coli and Salmonella, resulting in 50% mortality on control broilers. Addition of SDP to the feed improved (P < 0.05) average daily gain, feed intake, and feed efficiency for each period of the study (d 0 to 14, 15 to 28, 29 to 35, and 0 to 35). Continuous feeding of SDP improved (P < 0.05) average daily gain, feed intake, and feed efficiency from d 15 to 35 compared with broilers fed SDP to d 14. Liveability was improved (P < 0.05) in broilers consuming SDP either for 14 d or continuously throughout the experiment compared with control broilers. Spray-dried granular plasma was more effective than spray-dried powder plasma from d 0 to 14. The results of this experiment confirmed that SDP improved broiler growth rate, feed intake, feed efficiency, and minimized enteric challenge associated with necrotic enteritis with maximal protection afforded by continuous feeding. The response to SDP was independent of age of the broiler.",

Spray-dried plasma [7] was produced according to standard manufacturing procedures and added at the rate of 1.0, 0.5, and 0.25% in the starter, grower, and finisher diets, respectively. Feed was manufactured according to standard procedures at Kansas State University [13] ( Table 2 ). In all diets, 1% fat was added before pelleting, with the remaining fat added after pelleting. Diets were pelleted at a 85\u00b0C conditioning temperature using a 0.40 \u00d7 3.18 cm die and a conditioning retention time of 15 s. Starter diets were crumbled. From d 0 to 3, feed was offered ad libitum in trays (729 cm 2 ), followed by hanging gravity-flow feeders [14] . The hanging feeders were adjusted regularly to maintain optimal height for feed consumption. Water was delivered via free-standing 3.8-L poultry founts. The founts were washed daily and refilled with fresh water. Broilers (6 per pen; 8 pens per treatment) were housed in floor pens (56 \u00d7 122 cm). Pens contained soiled litter (softwood shavings used in 3 consecutive experiments), resulting in a high pathogen load environment. Following removal of broilers from the previous experiments, all pens were raked, allowed to dry (2 d), and caked dry litter was removed. The remaining litter was mixed with new litter and leveled to an average depth of 10 cm. Heat lamps maintained average temperatures at bird levels of 32, 29, 27, and 24\u00b0C for wk 1, 2, 3, and 4 to the end, respectively. Broilers were maintained on 23L:1D. Vaccinations prehatch were half a dose of Marek's and, before shipping, half a dose of Newcastle and Bronchitis. On d 7, all birds were vaccinated with Bursal Disease Vaccine [15] via the water, and on d 14, they were vaccinated with Newcastle-Bronchitis Vaccine [16] by coarse spray.",

In this experiment, the environment was contaminated as a result of continued litter use after 3 consecutive experiments, resulting in a high pathogen environment. The high pathogen environment was demonstrated by high chronic mortality (Figure 1 ) of control broilers and a progressively lower growth rate (Figure 3 ) of control broilers in the 4 consecutive experiments. In the current experiment, daily feed intake of control broilers increased to d 14 then plateaued after d 14 when mortality began to increase more rapidly. When the immune system is stimulated, metabolism is altered [19, 20, 21] , resulting in reduced feed intake, growth rate, and protein accretion [22, 23, 24, 25] . Recent reports indicate that SDP prevents overstimulation of the immune system [26]. Many researchers have reported an initial growth response to plasma the first week after broiler placement or weaning of pigs but have not been able to detect a significant difference in final BW by the end of the experimental period, 3 to 6 wk later [27, 28, 29] . In the present experiment, the performance response to SDP continued throughout the 35-d experiment. This supports the hypothesis that SDP provides passive protection and prevents overstimulation of the immune system, lessening the effects of immune system activation on feed intake, growth, and protein accretion. This implies that the growth response to SDP is influenced more by the relative degree of immune stimulation rather than by the relative age of the animal.",

Furthermore, bursal weights were significantly heavier in SDP fed broilers compared with control [37] , indicating an influence on immunocompetence. Following the removal of SDP (powder or granular) from the diet on d 14, ADFI (Figure 2 ) plateaued and remained greater than that of the control broilers throughout the experiment. This suggests that early consumption of SDP resulted in a broiler more resistant to the deleterious effects of a high pathogen environment due to improved intestinal health. Similar responses have been reported for pigs. Pigs fed SDP during the nursery phase had improved growth during the finishing phase [38] .",

Death losses were continually monitored, and results of the necrospy indicated that broilers developed necrotic enteritis and cultured positive for E. coli and Salmonella. Cultures were performed for Clostridium perfringens; however, it was not isolated. Broilers were also exhibiting rickets due to malabsorption from severe enteritis and had litter in the gizzard. Analysis of diets revealed no nutrient deficiencies. The addition of SDP to the drinking water reduced mortality of turkey poults challenged with Pasteurella multocida [5] . In addition, SDP has been shown to reduce morbidity and mortality of animals challenged with Crytosporidium parvum [39], coronavirus [40] , and E. coli [1] in calves; E. coli [33, 41, 42] and Salmonella [43] in pigs; Yersinia ruckeri in trout [44] ; and white spot syndrome virus in shrimp [45] .
