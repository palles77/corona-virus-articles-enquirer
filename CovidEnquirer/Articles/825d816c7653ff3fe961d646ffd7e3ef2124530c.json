[1] [2] [3] For example, the School of Nursing at the University of Texas at Austin offers a Disaster Nursing course, 4 and the Vanderbilt School of Nursing established a National Center for Emergency Preparedness in December 2002. 5 The American Association of Colleges of Nursing (AACN) envisions a professional nurse as a graduate of a baccalaureate program who is capable of providing holistic care to clients from diverse cultural backgrounds, can practice independently within the domains of nursing practice roles and collaboratively with other health team members, and acts responsibly in the event of a disaster. 6 As an active partner of the International Nursing Coalition for Mass Casualty Education (INCMCE), AACN has acknowledged that not all nurses can or should be prepared as first responders in the event of a mass casualty incident (MCI). An MCI is any incident, whether human-made or due to natural forces, ''.that results in significant disruption to the health and safety of the community or a segment thereof, or to the nation and that results, or is likely to result, in numbers of acuity that initially exceeds day-to-day operational capability of the local response community and healthcare system..'' 7 INCMCE was convened in 2001 to assure a competent nurse workforce to respond to MCIs. It is composed of representatives from schools of nursing, nursing specialty organizations, nursing accrediting bodies, and health care and government agencies. In a recent report, 8 INCMCE advocated that all nurses, regardless of experience and specialty, should possess the basic knowledge and skills needed to appropriately respond to an MCI. The MCI competencies are based on defining core competencies, core knowledge, and professional role development.",

Through curriculum mapping, we will learn how disaster preparedness and MCI response content builds upon or supports existing content and experiences. The next step, especially if additional content or experiences seem to be required, will be to locate pedagogical techniques best suited to prepare graduates in related competencies. 12 We believe that: (1) continuing to focus on the consensus-based competencies included in the INCMCE framework, as well as collaboration with hospitals and like facilities, will help us in educating LIUSON's future practitioners; and (2) empirical evaluation of knowledge gained through the administration of reliable and valid measurement tools not only will provide data but will help respond to the evaluation gap in INCMCE that currently exists. To successfully accomplish the latter, face and content validity must be established for the Student Attitudes Towards Disaster Preparedness Questionnaire by the LIUSON Test Review Committee. Test-retest reliability then can be achieved through subsequent administration of the questionnaire to student participants.",

Disaster preparedness requires that all health care providers are knowledgeable, skilled, and able to respond to a variety of threats. Because it is not practical to wait for a disaster to learn how to provide specialized care, the LIUSON faculty developed a specific educational experience for undergraduate community health student nurses. The course includes specific didactic material that is based on recommended standards. Students are given the opportunity to apply the learning and to develop additional skills by participating in a mock drill. Anecdotal comments from the students indicate that the course work has been helpful, and additional research is planned for evaluating the program. At approximately 2 pm a delivery truck filled with high-yield explosives (ie, a dirty bomb) drives up to the security checkpoint of the new Brooklyn Navy Yard Movie Studio. The driver bursts through the checkpoint and crashes the truck into the main building, causing a massive explosion that results in numerous fatalities and severe injuries. Ten ambulatory student patients who have sustained numerous injuries present to Woodhull Hospital. In addition, 5 student victims are transported to Woodhull Hospital via Emergency Management Systems. Students and 2 faculty members were briefed by the nurse director of the ED on their roles as either victims or responders in the event of mock chemical attack. Some student victims were made to look as though they had received burns, whereas others had lacerations and fractures sustained while in flight from the scene of the assault. Student victims experienced decontamination in the ''decon'' van adjacent to the hospital prior to being triaged in the ED. As the student victims converged on the ED, 2 faculty functioned as triage nurses, along with Woodhull ED nursing staff. Within a matter of minutes, our students, who took their role as victims seriously, poured through the ED doors, crying and terror-stricken. Amidst this pandemonium, the triage nurses quickly assessed victims, separating those who needed to be treated immediately from those who could wait for intervention. As the adrenalin pumped, the experience had every hallmark of a disaster, that is, little time to think and yet the need for rapid response. This was real! Drill Scenario No. 2 Fifty persons attend a conference in Wyoming, 10 of whom go on a hunting trip while in the region. Two days later, while returning from Wyoming on a bus to Brooklyn, several persons become very ill. Enlarged lymph nodes, fever, vomiting, and diarrhea develop in 5 persons, and 5 others report cough, chest pain, and tachypnea. Exiting the Williamsburg Bridge, the driver of the bus hurriedly drives to the nearest Brooklyn hospital, Woodhull Medical Center. Again, faculty and students were oriented to their roles as either victims or ED staff, but this time in response to a biologic event, pneumonic plague. On this occasion, students participated with faculty in assessment, triage, intervention, and transfer of victims to appropriate settings based on postexposure need.",

Ten student victims presented to ED; 5 represented day care staff who reported fever and a rash, and 5 represented persons who recently had traveled outside the United States and now were reporting fever and respiratory symptoms such as cough and congestion. The remaining students shadowed the ED nurses, who had to distinguish between patients who required quarantine versus those who could be treated and sent home. The drill was multifaceted in its attempt to test triage processes, established isolation protocols, and the adequacy of communication from the point of triage to movement of victims to the immediate clinical area.",
