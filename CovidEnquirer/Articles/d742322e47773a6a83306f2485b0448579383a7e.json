Vaccine control strategies for this virus are only effective when designed around the currently circulating serotypes. It is essential to not only rapidly detect IBV but also to identify the type of virus causing disease. Six TaqMan\u2122-based quantitative realtime RT-PCR assays (Universal, Ark, Mass, DE/GA98, GA07, GA08) were developed and examined the sensitivity and specificity for each assay. Assays were developed targeting the hypervariable region in the S1 gene subunit. The analytical sensitivity of TaqMan\u2122-based quantitative real-time RT-PCR assays (qRT-PCR) assays was evaluated using synthetic DNA standards that were identical with the target sequence and specificity was further validated using clinical and biological specimens. All developed assays performed equivalently when using synthetic DNA templates as standard material, as it achieved linearity over a 5 log 10 dynamic range with a reproducible limit of detection of \u226410 target copies per reaction, with high calculated amplification efficiencies ranging between 90%-115%. Further validation of specificity using clinical and biological specimens was also successful.",

Although a respiratory disease, IB can also affect the female reproductive tract, leading to poor production and egg quality. Some strains cause severe nephritis that results in significant mortality in young birds (Cook et al., 2012) . Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a lipid-enveloped positive-sense singlestranded RNA virus of the family Coronaviridae genus Gammacoronavirus (Masters, 2006; Jackwood, 2012) . The major determinant of IBV serotype specificity is the spike protein, which is the most significant protein for virus identification as it contains epitopes for serotype-specific antibodies (Cavanagh and Naqi, 2003; Jackwood, 2012) . Many serotypes exist across the globe, and cross-protection between serotypes is poor as the degree of amino acid identity between the S1 proteins of different IBV strains decreases (Cavanagh et al., 1997; Cavanagh, 2007) . Thus, constant worldwide surveillance and identification of IBV types is fundamentally important.",

Currently, more than 50 antigenic and genetic types of this virus have been officially reported and, among them, the Arkansas (Ark), Massachusetts (Mass), Delaware (DE) and Georgia 98 (GA98) types are frequently isolated in the field, and are also the commonly used vaccine types in the United States (Jackwood et al., 2005; Jackwood, 2012) . In recent years, two new IBV variants namely Georgia 07 (GA07) and Georgia 08 (GA08) have emerged (Kulkarni and Resurreccion, 2010; Jackwood, 2012; Kulkarni, 2016) . According to a recent comprehensive phylogeny-based classification system for IBV based on the complete nucleotide sequence of the S1 gene, IBV was categorized into 6 main genotypes (GI to GVI), along with 32 sub-genotypic lineages and some potential groups that were presented as unique variants (Valastro et al., 2016) . The Mass, Ark, GA07 and GA08 IBV types examined in this study are in the same GI group and 1, 9, 25 and 27 sub-genotypic lineages respectively. The DE and GA98 viruses are in the GIV group sub-genotypic lineage 1 (Valastro et al., 2016 not cross protect, it is imperative to detect and differentiate the IBV types within an infected poultry flock accurately and rapidly so effective vaccination can be implemented. However, diagnosis of IBV infections using traditional methods like viral culture and serology are insensitive, laborious and time-consuming to be applicable in clinical detection.",

            "text": "To aid accurate and rapid diagnosis of IBV in the field we developed quantitative real-time reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) assays that would quickly identify specific IBV types and could be conducted on clinical samples. Real-time RT-PCR has become one of the most common methods of gene quantitation due to its broad dynamic range, high sensitivity, and high sequence-specificity (Wong and Medrano, 2005) in addition to functional simplicity and short run times. Real-time RT-PCR has been useful for detecting viral agents of infectious diseases (Mackay et al., 2002) . In this study, TaqMan\u2122-based quantitative real time RT-PCR methods for rapidly detecting and typing IBV were evaluated using synthetic DNA templates that represent IBV serotypes found in the field. The purpose of using synthetic DNA templates was to provide authentic standards to quantify the presence of the target S1 gene for serotyping assays, and the 5\u2032-untranslated region (UTR) for IBV screening tests. Evaluation of amplification efficiency using synthetic DNA is sensitive, accurate and has various advantages as the sequence of the synthetic DNA template can be freely designed without contamination, and qualitative misinterpretations of the experimental results are rare (Abe et al., 1999; Moriya et al., 2006 ). An internal positive control (IPC) assay was also developed to monitor potential reaction inhibitors. This is a non-target template present in the same well as the sample, which is co-amplified simultaneously with the target sequence of interest (Oikonomou et al., 2008) , thus preventing false-negative reporting due to PCR inhibition (Hoorfar et al., 2004; Nordstrom et al., 2007) . Lastly, clinical specimens obtained from experimentally and naturally infected birds, as well as virus stocks, were processed for validating the specificity of these assays. Statistical analysis of these assays was based on the MIQE guidelines (Bustin et al., 2009 ).",

The universal and most of the type-specific primers and probes were previously reported (Callison et al., 2006; Roh et al., 2013 Roh et al., , 2014 . Primers and probe sets for GA07 and GA08 were newly designed in this study. A GA08 variant forward primer (GA08-V-F) was included to ensure that all existing GA08 IBV types circulating in the field would be detected including GA08 variant types and Mass and DE/GA98 IBV type-specific probes were slightly modified to increase specificity and to synchronize thermocycling conditions with other type-specific assays. The DE and GA98 IBV types shared the same primer and probes, due to genetic similarities within the hypervariable S1 gene subunit (Roh et al., 2014) . Specificity of the primers and probes was verified by an in-depth in silico examination with the use of the BLAST search tool at NCBI (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov), and by processing viral nucleic acid extracted from known negative clinical samples that did not contain the target sequence. Another set of primers and probe targeting endogenous avian RNA that exists in avian originated samples for use as an internal positive control (IPC) were also designed for the universal assay. The probe for the IPC was tagged with VIC dye at the 5\u2032 end and MGB quencher at the 3\u2032 end (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA).",

As the primer pairs for each assay were designed to generate an amplicon of around 90-260 base pairs, synthetic DNA standards were designed accordingly ( Table 1 ). The synthetic DNA standards were serially diluted 10-fold from 10 5 to 10 1 copies per 5 \u03bcl. The 25 \u03bcl qRT-PCR reactions were prepared as follows: 5 \u03bcl of synthetic DNA standard, 10 \u03bcl of RealPCR\u2122 RNA master mix (IDEXX Laboratories, Westbrook, ME, USA), forward and reverse primers (both with final concentrations of 0.4 \u03bcM), probe (final concentration of 0.1 \u03bcM) and RNase/DNase free water (Integrated DNA Technologies, Coralville, IA, USA). This reaction combination was the same for all IBV typespecific tests. The GA08 type IBV assay included an additional forward primer (0.4 \u03bcM in reaction) to account for a genetic variant ( Table 1) . The IBV universal assay included primers and probe targeting endogenous avian RNA for use as an internal positive control (IPC) in avian originated samples. In samples where endogenous avian RNA was not expected to be present, a separate synthetic IPC template representing the endogenous avian RNA was spiked into the reaction mixture. The 25 \u03bcl reaction mixture for the universal assay was the same as type-specific assays except an additional pair of forward primer (0.4 \u03bcM in reaction), reverse primer (0.4 \u03bcM in reaction) and probe (0.1 \u03bcM in reaction) targeting the IPC template along with 2 \u03bcl of the IPC (10 3 target copy numbers) itself was added. All materials regarding the IPC were provided by IDEXX laboratories. The gene and sequence information of the IPC is proprietary. Each assay included positive and negative controls.",

The specificity of the primers and probe designed for each assay was examined in detail in silico and found to be specific. The dynamic range of the universal IBV qRT-PCR assays spanned 5 log 10 units from 10 to 10 5 copies per reaction with a slope of -3.35 and an R 2 value of 0.99, at a LOD of \u226410 copy numbers and with an average calculated efficiency of 98.8 % ( Table 3 ). The assay detected 10 copy numbers in all triplicate runs in the universal assay. The artificially added IPC templates were successfully amplified and did not appear to interfere with the amplification of the target template regarding the universal assay (data not shown). The mean C T values, slopes of the standard curve and R 2 value of the other type-specific assays are shown in Table 3 . All type-specific assays retained linearity for 5 orders of magnitude at a LOD of \u226410 copy numbers per reaction and amplification efficiency was calculated by using the slope from the linear equation.

As DEL/ GA98 type-specific assays shared the same primers, probes and target sequences, they were verified with positive samples for GA98 and DE type IBV. Samples were considered negative when the C T values were \u226540. The universal assay successfully detected IBV in all IBV positive samples regardless of their serotypes, and none of the non-IBV avian respiratory viruses were detected in the IBV negative samples (Table 4 ,5).

For that purpose, we propose a panel of qRT-PCR assays for IBV that would be suitable for rapid and type specific diagnostic purposes. Instead of cDNA templates from IBV, synthetic DNA templates mimicking IBV target sequences were utilized for standardization and verification of the developed assays. Synthetic DNA templates are known to have advantages over cDNA templates that are prepared from biological samples in terms of qRT-PCR standardization as they present a measurable amplification efficiency compared to authentic cDNA templates (Moriya et al., 2006) . Using such material provided a more stringent validation criteria for evaluation of LOD and analytical specificity. Even though the thermocycling conditions included an reverse transcription (RT) step as IBV was an RNA virus, the purpose of using synthetic DNA was to evaluate how well the primer and probe designs performed in binding and amplifying cDNA. Additionally, the RT step was validated by using viral RNA extracted from clinical and biological samples.",

All assays showed LOD of \u226410 copy numbers per reaction with an R 2 \u22650.99 indicating high reproducibility. One hundred percent of the known positive samples were determined as positive by the universal and Mass, Ark, GA07 type-specific assays whereas the DE/GA98 assay detected 97% (29/30), and GA08 detected 94% (28/30) as positive out of the known positive sample panel. An internal positive control (IPC) was also designed to be co-amplified in each reaction mixture to aid in the accurate reporting of results by preventing false negative reports. The endogenous avian RNA IPC was only used in the universal assay as the performance of the type-specific assays were interfered with by the presence of the avian RNA IPC primers and probe (data not shown). The IPC was designed to generate a mean C T value of 27-29 with 10 3 copy numbers under non-inhibitory conditions. The mean C T values of the IPC were spread over a broader range with a higher standard deviation (SEM) when testing with biological and clinical samples, which seemed reasonable as the quantities of the target endogenous avian RNA would have varied in each sample (data not shown).",

They can identify multiple IBV serotypes in the same clinical sample, making it possible for the set of assays to be utilized as a vaccine monitoring tool in flocks that were vaccinated with multiple types of IBV. One of the other achievements of this study was that all qRT-PCR assays shared the same thermocycling parameters, thus allowing to test for various types of IBV on the same test plate in a single session. Although concurrent detection of different IBV field types in the same sample is possible by running separate tests using different primer/probe combinations on the same sample, multiplexing the assays was unsuccessful as the decrease of sensitivity and efficiency was in the unacceptable range (data not shown). It should be noted that the selection of field samples from our laboratory archives was simply based on their serotypes for the purpose of validation and not on an epidemiological perspective, which was outside the scope of this work. In addition, the sensitivity and efficiency of the universal and type-specific Mass and DE/GA98 assays were comparable to the assays that were previously developed (Roh Table 4 Sensitivity of the IBV universal and type-specific assays using clinical and biological samples. et al., 2014) , but run times were much shorter due to the changes in the reaction conditions. In summary, a panel of highly sensitive and specific qRT-PCR assays for universal detection and typing of IBV were developed and validated with synthetic DNA standards, clinical and biological specimens. The tests can be used to rapidly identify specific IBV types in clinical samples, detect more than one IBV type in the same sample and determine the relative amount of each IBV type in a sample. The provision of these assays will facilitate IBV diagnostics in the field in terms of accuracy, functional simplicity and rapidity as well as aid in evaluating type specific IBV vaccine takes following administration of different live attenuated vaccines.",
