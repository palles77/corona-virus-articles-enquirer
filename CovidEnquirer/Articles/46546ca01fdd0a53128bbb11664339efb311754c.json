            "text": "Two highly pathogenic human coronaviruses associated with severe respiratory syndromes emerged since the beginning of the century. The severe acute respiratory syndrome SARS-coronavirus (CoV) spread first in southern China in 2003 with about 8000 infected cases in few months. Then in 2012, the Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS-CoV) emerged from the Arabian Peninsula giving a still ongoing epidemic associated to a high fatality rate. CoVs are thus considered a major health threat. This is especially true as no vaccine nor specific therapeutic are available against either SARS-or MERS-CoV. Therefore, new drugs need to be identified in order to develop antiviral treatments limiting CoV replication. In this study, we focus on the nsp14 protein, which plays a key role in virus replication as it methylates the RNA cap structure at the N7 position of the guanine. We developed a high-throughput N7-MTase assay based on Homogenous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF \u00ae ) and screened chemical libraries (2000 compounds) on the SARS-CoV nsp14. 20 compounds inhibiting the SARS-CoV nsp14 were further evaluated by IC 50 determination and their specificity was assessed toward flavivirusand human cap N7-MTases. Our results reveal three classes of compounds: 1) molecules inhibiting several MTases as well as the dengue virus polymerase activity unspecifically, 2) pan MTases inhibitors targeting both viral and cellular MTases, and 3) inhibitors targeting one viral MTase more specifically showing however activity against the human cap N7-MTase. These compounds provide a first basis towards the development of more specific inhibitors of viral methyltransferases.",

            "text": "CoVs are enveloped viruses possessing a single stranded positive sense RNA genome of approximately 29.7 kb in length (Pan et al., 2008; Van Boheemen et al., 2012) . The SARS-CoV initiates its replication cycle after binding to the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) (Kuhn et al., 2004) . After endocytosis, the viral RNA genome is released into the cellular host cytoplasm and translated into two large polyproteins (de Wit et al., 2016; Snijder et al., 2016) . The pp1a and pp1ab polyproteins are next cleaved by viral proteases into 11 and 16 non-structural proteins respectively (nsp1 to 16). These proteins form a large replication transcription complex (RTC) which is associated to host cellular proteins (Van Hemert et al., 2008) . CoV RTC ensures the replication of the viral genome and the transcription of genomic and subgenomic mRNA. These viral RNAs are polyadenylated at their 3 0 end and protected by a 5 0 cap structure, which is synthetized by viral enzymes. The CoV capping pathway is thought to follow four sequential steps implicating several nsps: I) the 5 0 -3 0 helicase/ NTPase nsp13 hydrolyses first the phosphate g from the nascent 5'triphosphorylated RNA (Ivanov and Ziebuhr, 2004) ; II) a GMP molecule is supposedly transferred to the diphosphorylated RNA by a still unknown guanylyltransferase forming a cap (GpppN) structure; III) the cap is then methylated at N7 position of the guanosine by nsp14 in the presence of methyl donor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) yielding to a cap-0 ( 7m GpppN) and S-adenosyl-L-homocysteine (SAH) by-product (Chen et al., 2009) ; IV) nsp10/nsp16 complex methylates at the ribose 2 0 OH group of the first transcribed RNA leading to the conversion of the cap-0 ( 7m GpppN) into the cap-1 ( 7m GpppN 2'om ) (Bouvet et al., 2010; Chen et al., 2011) . In vitro assays have deciphered the mechanisms driving the RNA cap methylation in SARS-and MERS-CoV. It follows an obligatory order in which N7-methylation by nsp14 is a pre-requisite for 2 0 Omethylation by the nsp10/nsp16 complex (Aouadi et al., 2017; Bouvet et al., 2014 Bouvet et al., , 2010 .",

In addition, the N-terminus moiety of nsp14 contains a DEDDh exonuclease (ExoN) domain (Minskaia et al., 2006) . The two domains communicate functionally, as truncation experiments showed that the N-terminal region of nsp14 is required for the N7-MTase activity (Chen et al., 2009) . Both N7-MTase and ExoN activities have been confirmed by in vitro assay showing that the association of nsp10 to nsp14 stimulated >35 fold the ExoN activity while the N7-MTase activity does not depend on the nsp10-nsp14 interaction (Bouvet et al., 2012 (Bouvet et al., , 2010 Decroly et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "The N7-and 2 0 O-methylations of the viral mRNA cap are key events for the viral infection. Indeed reverse genetic experiments revealed first that the N7-methylation of cap structures is essential for the synthesis of viral proteins (Case et al., 2016) . This observation is corroborated by former biochemical data showing that the N7-methyl guanosine of cap structures is recognized by the eukaryotic translation initiation factor 4E (eIF4E) and participates in the initiation of viral mRNA translation into proteins (Case et al., 2016; Cougot et al., 2004) . Accordingly, inhibitors blocking nsp14 N7-MTase activity have been identified by yeast based screening assay on SARS-CoV, and induced a potent antiviral effect demonstrating that nsp14 MTase activity is an attractive antiviral target (Sun et al., 2014) . Whereas N7-MTase mutants are replication defective, 2 0 O-MTase mutants show limited effect on virus replication in cell culture but have an attenuated phenotype in animal models Menachery et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2014; Z\u00fcst et al., 2013) . The molecular basis of this attenuated phenotype was recently elucidated: incompletely-capped RNAs have been shown to be recognized by immune sensors such as RIG-I and MDA-5, which trigger innate immunity pathways Schuberth-Wagner et al., 2015; Wu et al., 2013) . In turn, RIG-I or MDA-5 induces signalling cascades yielding to the expression of cytokines and type I interferon inducing an antiviral state in neighboring cells. Among the interferon-stimulated gens (ISG), IFIT1 also participates to the restriction of viral replication by sequestrating mis-capped viral RNAs (Pichlmair et al., 2011) . Thus cap structure is now considered as a kind of \"marker of self\" and it is currently admitted that 2 0 O-MTase inhibitors might help virus clearance by stimulation of the immune response Ferron et al., 2012; Z\u00fcst et al., 2011) .",

The purified nsp14 is detected as a single band migrating at the expected molecular mass (Fig. 1A , z60 kDa) on Coomassie blue stained SDS-PAGE gels. The purified nsp14 transfers [ 3 H] methyl onto a GpppA cap analogue whereas no MTase activity is detected onto 7m GpppA (Fig. 1B) indicating that nsp14 harbors an N7-MTase activity that can be detected using cost effective commercial cap analogues.",

            "text": "We miniaturized the EPIgenous MTase assay based on Homogenous Time Resolved Fluorescence (HTRF) (Degorce et al., 2009) to screen a library of 2000 compounds. The principle of the HTRF assay, shown in Fig. S2 , is to follow the MTase activity by indirectly detecting SAH, the by-product of the methyl transfer reaction. Indeed, in the detection system, the released SAH competes with fluorescent SAH-d2, which binds to an anti-SAH antibody coupled to a cryptate fluorophore (see Material and Methods). Thus, increase of SAH leads to decrease of the HTRF signal (Fig. S3D) . The experimental conditions for the enzymatic assay were optimized and adapted for automated screening assay. Briefly, I) the enzyme concentration was set up at 5 nM of nsp14 as titration curves indicated that 80% of the maximal activity after 20 min incubation period is obtained at this enzyme concentration (Fig. S3A) ; II) GpppA substrate concentration was adjusted at 8 mM to robustly and reproducibly detect N7-MTase activity (Fig. S3B) ; III) SAM concentration was adjusted to 2 mM in order to ensure the optimal conversion rate of SAM to SAH according to the manufacture recommendations (z4e11%, Fig. S3C/D) . The SAH detection conditions were optimized and the SAH-d2 and anti-SAH antibody were diluted 1/16 and 1/150 respectively. Fig. 2A shows the time course experiment of nsp14 MTase activity indicating that using our experimental optimized conditions the N7-methylation reaction reached the saturation phase after a 30 min incubation period. The enzymatic reactions were thus incubated during 20 min in the screening. Sinefungin, which has already been reported to inhibit the SARS-CoV N7-MTase (IC 50 z 500 nM) (Bouvet et al., 2010) , was used as positive control for MTase inhibition. The inhibition curve of nsp14 MTase using the optimized HTRF assay revealed an inhibition in a similar range, with IC 50 (HTRF) value of 110 nM (Fig. 2B) . We also assessed that the addition of DMSO up to 5% did not impact the MTase reactions and/ or the HTRF quantification of released SAH. The signal variation was estimated to 2e2.8%. The average of Z 0 value was 0.69.",

Table 2 also reveals that sinefungin (used as positive control) and compound 1040 exhibit a broad spectrum MTase inhibition profile with no inhibition detected on the RdRp activity of DENV NS5.

All the 7 analogs bear the benzhydryl-piperazine group characteristic to this chemical series in the right-hand side of the structure. Four compounds lacking the aromatic moiety in the left part of the molecule show no inhibition of SARS-CoV nsp14 MTase. In contrast, 3 analogs carrying an aromatic terminal ring in the lefthand side inhibit the SARS-CoV N7-MTase activity with IC 50 between 6.2 and 14 mM (457, 278 and 1264) . The substitution of the two phenyl rings in the benzhydryl-piperazine moiety (fluorine or chlorine groups) have no impact on the inhibition profile. These compounds were initially not selected from the original screening but their inhibition was close to the selection cut-off (42% inhibition at 50 mM).

Thus, enzymes such as MTases involved in viral RNA capping are now considered as promising antiviral targets . Here, we developed a high-throughput MTase screening assay based on HTRF technology that possesses advantageous features. The HTRF assay allows the minimization of non-specific fluorescence emissions by introducing a time delay (50e150 ms) between the initial light excitation and fluorescence measurement (Degorce et al., 2009) . This time delay limits the interference of fluorescent compounds in the screening assay. Indeed, only 37 out of 2000 compounds interfered with the detection system among which were considered as 17 false positive. In addition, a non-fluorescent enzymatic assay (FBA) was used to confirm the hits obtained from the primary screening. The initial screening was performed using a commercial cap analogue substrate (GpppA), as the availability of high amount of capped RNA substrates is a limiting step. This screening allowed the identification of 20 compounds inhibiting at least 42% of the nsp14 N7-MTase activity. The inhibitory effect (below 25 mM, Table 3 ) of 11 of these compounds was confirmed using a radioactive filterbinding assay performed with longer synthetic RNA substrates (GpppAC 4 ). In contrast, 9 compounds barely inhibited the MTase activity measured with GpppAC 4 substrate. Thus, it is likely that the use of GpppA as substrate may favor the identification of inhibitors that would be less efficient on longer RNA substrates. The weaker inhibition effect observed using longer RNA substrates might suggest that these compounds interfere with the RNA binding site of the enzyme.",

In addition, we also tested these compounds on the Dengue virus polymerase in order to control the inhibition specificity on the RdRp activity and eliminate molecules showing unspecific inhibition or frequent hitters. This strategy revealed that 5 out of the 11 best hits identified in the nsp14 N7-MTase activity-screening campaign potently inhibited all MTases tested as well as the Dengue virus polymerase.",

These results might be related to structural and functional homologies between CoV N7-MTase and the human hRNMT limiting the possibility to identify inhibitors targeting specifically the CoV N7-MTase. However, we would like to propose that the inhibitors identified here might well be substrate mimicks and bind to conserved substrate pockets since the protein folding of hRNMT and nsp14 are significantly different, the latter deviating from classical Rossman-fold MTases. It is also noteworthy that this work was performed with a highly active truncated construct of hRNMT, which is used at very low concentration (20 nM) for IC 50 determination. Additionally, it is also possible that as our truncated hRNMT is less selective as it lacks the hRNMT activating Miniprotein (RAM) binding domain and the RAM protein. Indeed it was previously demonstrated that RAM stabilizes the structure and positioning of the hRNMT lobe and increases the specific recruitment of SAM (Varshney et al., 2016) . This high inhibition of hRNMT MTase activity may be overcome in the presence of its allosteric activator RAM, which may allow to stringent the specificity of the compounds.",

The pleiotropic inhibition observed on MTases activities suggests that despite the weak primary sequence conservation, these enzymes do have a common structural organization (Rosmann fold characteristic of most of viral and cellular MTases) and share similar enzymatic properties. This observation is consistent with the common structural organization, with a conserved SAM, RNA and/or cap binding sites, shared by those MTases. The identification of broad-spectrum viral MTases inhibitors may offer a starting point to develop new antiviral compounds. We considered that these molecules could be interesting as we expected that the SAR process will give the opportunity to increase both specificity and inhibition properties. Accordingly, a SAR study previously performed on the flavivirus MTases has demonstrated that chemical analogs of SAH, showed improved activity and selectivity against DENV MTase, but not on the related human enzymes (Lim et al., 2011) . The crystal structure revealed that the most active SAH derivative harbors substitutions accommodated in a specific cavity conserved in Flaviviral MTases. It would be thus relevant to initiate the structural analysis of viral MTases in complex with the best compounds in order to improve selectivity.",

Eleven compounds demonstrated a potent inhibition (>80%) at 50 mM concentration using the radioactive assay. The specificity of each compound was further evaluated using a radioactive assay on CoV 2 0 O-MTase (nsp10/nsp16) and the MTases of Dengue and West-Nile viruses as well as the human RNA N7-MTase (hRNMT) involved in the capping of cellular RNAs. This comparative analysis revealed that the selected compounds cluster in 3 classes: 1) barely specific inhibitors, 2) pan-MTases inhibitors inhibiting viral and cellular MTases, 3) inhibitors targeting more specifically one viral MTase but also active against the hRNMT. These latter series of inhibitors may represent a good starting point for the development of antivirals targeting the CoV MTases.",
