These opportunities often occur when the preferred habitat of a species overlaps or is invaded by a second species. Interspecies interactions, especially among species competitively utilizing the same resources, often result in aggressive encounters. If a pathogen is present in a reservoir host, the encounter may result in pathogen transmission to a naive host or adaptation of the pathogen to create a new reservoir. The reservoir population, the carrier of the pathogen and the long-term host, often does not exhibit disease symptoms or experience any additional mortality.",

            "text": "In this investigation, we develop, analyze, and numerically simulate solutions to two new habitat-based models for the spread of a directly transmitted pathogen between two species. Our goal is to model the process of interspecies pathogen transmission based on species habitat preferences. The motivation for the models comes from our recent study of hantavirus in Paraguay. Hantavirus (Family Bunyaviridae) is a genus of viruses, each generally associated with a specific rodent species (i.e., mice and rats). Approximately 30 different hantaviruses exist throughout the world, some of which cause human infection (Mills et al., 1999) . Human infection is incidental, generally due to indirect transmission from contact with infectious rodent excreta, but may result in hantavirus pulmonary syndrome with a mortality rate as high as 37% (CDC, 2002) . One of the reservoir species for hantavirus in Paraguay is Akodon montensis (Montane Akodont found in Eastern Paraguay, Northeastern Argentina and Southeastern Brazil) carrier of Jabora virus (JABV, GenBank # EF492471). Our empirical data show that although these species exhibit different habitat preferences, the combination of partial habitat flexibility and temporally variable climatic and soil and vegetation conditions, results in periodic microgeographic sympatry of Akodon with one or both of the spillover species.",

            "text": "Mathematical models for the spread of hantavirus in rodents have concentrated primarily on the dynamics of the reservoir population (Abramson and Kenkre, 2002; Abramson et al., 2003; Allen et al., 2003 Allen et al., , 2006a Allen et al., , 2006b Sauvage et al., 2003 Sauvage et al., , 2007 Wesley, 2008; Wesley et al., 2009; Wolf et al., 2006) . A multispecies epizootic model for susceptible and infected hosts was formulated and analyzed by McCormack and Allen (2007) but this model was not spatially explicit and did not account for differences in epizootiology of reservoir and spillover species. Our new models take into account habitat partitioning and important differences in the epizootiology of the reservoir and spillover populations. The role of the spillover species in pathogen and disease emergence is not well understood. It has been speculated that the spillover species may contribute to maintenance of the pathogen in the wild, provided there is spillback infection (McCormack and Allen, 2007) or the spillover species may be instrumental in the evolution of new hantaviruses . Spillover infections occur in hantavirus (Delfraro et al., 2008; Palma et al., 2009; Klingstrom et al., 2002; Torrez-Martinez et al., 1998; Weidmann et al., 2005) but are not unique to hantaviruses (Daszak et al., 2000) ; they have been documented in other zoonotic diseases including rabies (Nadin-Davis and Loza-Rubio, 2006; Nel et al., 1997) , Nipah virus (Chua, 2003) , canine distemper, parvovirus (Fiorello et al., 2006) , and the SARS coronavirus (Holmes, 2003) .",

We formulate two models, the first model is a deterministic model, a system of ordinary differential equations (ODE), whereas the second model is a stochastic model, a continuous-time Markov chain (CTMC) model. The ODE system is analytically tractable in the case that encounters in the boundary region are brief. In this case an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number, R 0 , can be calculated, the threshold for disease outbreaks. The basic reproduction number is one of the most important parameters in the study of disease ecology. Specifically, it is the number of secondary infections caused by introduction of one infectious individual into an entirely susceptible population (see Anderson and May, 1991; Hethcote, 2000) . The ODE system does not capture the few cases that occur due to interspecies interactions in the region of overlap. Therefore, we formulate a CTMC model for this purpose. Numerical solutions of the stochastic model illustrate sporadic infection in the spillover species when habitats overlap, a prominent feature of the seroprevalence data from Paraguay. Analysis and simulation of our new models show that as the number of encounters in the overlap region and the time spent in the overlap region increase (which may be triggered by habitat change), there is greater likelihood of pathogen outbreaks and disease persistence in the reservoir and spillover populations (through increase in R 0 ). Interspecies encounters and pathogen transmission in the region of overlap may be the first step in the evolution of a new hantavirus strain.",

This site is highly disturbed by human activities and is intensively managed for pasturing and grazing. Reforestation is suppressed and graminoid cover maintained by frequent prescribed burning. Large ungulate grazers, primarily domestic cattle (Bos taurus) are present on this site year-round. Vegetation in the site is dominated by species of the genus Andropogon, warm temperature/tropical grasses used as grazing forage. Other common vegetation genera include Merostachys (bamboo) along the fringes of pastures and Xyris (a forb) in lower, wetter areas. Although dominated by herbaceous species, R3A retains a few islands of woody vegetation and trees, especially along the edges of the deforested areas. These forest remnants are better microhabitats for Akodon, and most captures of this species were along the northwest and southeast corners of the grid, the edges closest to the woodlands.",

These disturbances have resulted in fragmentation of the native vegetation cover, producing numerous internal edges and gaps in the forest canopy. These edges and gaps are associated with a dense understory at the forest floor, favorable habitat for A. montensis (Pardi\u00f1 as and D'El\u00eda, 2003) . Dominant vegetation genera in areas of intact or mostly intact forest include Cedrela and Balfourodendron. In disturbed areas, a lower canopy dominated by Sorocea bonplandii (a lower, woody shrub-like tree) is common, with herbaceous species and Bromelia common in the understory, and Merostachys frequently in forest gaps.",

Where vegetation structure permitted (R3B only), another trap was placed 2-3 m above ground, in branches or vines, to sample other more arboreal species. However, although A. montensis is preferentially a forestdweller, it only rarely climbs in the vegetation (651 of 661, 98.5%, of our captures of this species on R3B were on the ground). Both grids were sampled in nine sessions from February 2005 to May 2007, using standard mark-recapture techniques for small mammals (Wilson et al., 1996) . Each session included eight consecutive nights (seven in February 2005). Animals were individually marked with a subdermally-implanted passive integrated transponder (PIT) tag, which can be read by passing the electronic reader near the animal's body. Date, grid, trap station, and the PIT tag number were recorded, animals were identified to species, and sex and weight were recorded. Blood, saliva, urine, and feces were collected the first time an animal was captured during each sampling session, for assay of hantavirus antibody and viral RNA presence. Animals were then released at the site of capture. All field protocols were approved by the Texas Tech University Animal Care and Use Committee.",

In this report we consider only the populations of A. montensis, N. lasiurus, and O. delator, as exemplifying the scenario being modeled. A. montensis has been described as the primary reservoir of JABV. RNA-positive individuals of Akodon were encountered on R3B and R3A, and seropositive individuals of N. lasiurus and O. delator were trapped and identified on R3A. Each of these species is widely distributed in the central Southern Cone of South America (Carleton and Musser, 2005) , and may be locally abundant in their preferred habitat. Habitat preferences differ somewhat among the three, which is critical to this field situation and to the model which we present herein. N. lasiurus and O. delator prefer grasslands, with Necromys preferring dry soil and Oxymycterus preferring wet or even saturated soils. A. montensis preferentially inhabits disturbed woodlands, also venturing into old-fields and grasslands which include forbs and brushy growth (Redford and Eisenberg, 1992; Goodin et al., manuscript) . Our data from nine sampling sessions through 27 months support these descriptions of habitat preferences, and further indicate that the microgeographic separation among these three species is partial and temporally variable and often incomplete, with overlap (microsympatry) occurring sporadically between A. montensis and one or both of the spillover species. Fig. 2 illustrates this situation on site R3A, and also indicates the presence of seropositive individuals for each of these species in close proximity to the others.",

As more animals enter and stay in the boundary region, that is, if p i increases and p o decreases, then R c 0 increases and consequently, R 0 increases. This increase can be seen in Fig. 7 . The value of R 0 , computed from formula (4.4), is compared to the exact value of R 0 based on the parameter values in Table 1 . Both reproduction numbers show similar increases with p i (average number of visits/year) and 364=p o (average number of days in the boundary region).

            "text": "Biologically-motivated models for pathogen spread between two species were formulated, an ODE model (3.4)-(3.6) and a CTMC model. The models are based on the fact that spatial overlap of habitats leads to greater numbers of interspecies encounters. From the ODE model, an explicit expression for the basic reproduction number R 0 was calculated based on assumption (4.1), as well as reproduction numbers for the preferred habitats, R r 0 and R s 0 , and for crossover or interspecies transmission, R c 0 . In this case, we showed global stability of the disease-free equilibrium when R 0 o1 and existence of an enzootic equilibrium when R 0 41. Greater number of interactions among species allow the pathogen to be transmitted more frequently from an infectious host to a susceptible host. This, in turn, increases R 0 so that it exceeds the reproduction number in the preferred habitat, R 0 4R r (Fig. 7) , which ultimately results in greater likelihood of outbreaks and disease persistence. As illustrated in Fig. 2 , the overlap region is spatially-and temporally-dependent. We did not consider temporal variability of this overlap region which may depend on seasonal variations. But we did include demographic variability due to births, deaths, transmission, and movement in the CTMC model. Seasonal variations, in general, will cause additional variability in the solution behavior (e.g., Allen et al., 2006a) . As more data are collected, the effects of seasonal and climatic variations on the reservoir and spillover species will be studied. In addition, controlled studies are needed to obtain data on the duration and shape of the rodents' disease stage distributions. Interspecies pathogen transmission, where a known virus ''jumps'' into a new host, is one of the primary reasons for the large increase in emerging diseases in wildlife in recent years (Daszak et al., 2000; Parrish et al., 2008; Richomme et al., 2006) . Our mathematical models illustrate the first step in this emergence and the role that the spillover species may play in emerging diseases. Our models were developed for spread of hantavirus in rodents but can be modified and applied to other species, where spatial spread results in spillover infection.",
