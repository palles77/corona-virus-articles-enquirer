Only 178 hospitals existed in 1873 when the first survey was conducted-a time when no proper gentleman or lady would venture into a hospital by choice. 1 The murky medical practices of the 1800s offered little that couldn't be found in homes, and physicians had little in their armamentarium to change the course of disease and injury. However, discovery and scientific advance changed that. Effective anesthesia, surgical antisepsis, antibiotics, the x-ray, and other advances turned the hospital into a place of comfort, hope, and healing. The 20th-century hospital became a sophisticated financial institution, the core of medical education, and the site of dazzling technological display. Medical advances offered aid not only to the chronically ill but offered hope to those who suffered acute trauma or medical or psychiatric emergency.",

The release of 40 tons of methyl isocyanate from the Union Carbide factory in Bhopal, India, in December 1984 exposed more than 500,000 to the deadly gas and killed about 6000 in the first week after the release. In September 1987, workers scavenging a dismantled cancer clinic in Goiania, Brazil, took home a source containing cesium-137. They sold it to a junkman who showed the glowing item to friends and neighbors. Once radiation exposure victims presented to hospitals, and the release became well known, hospitals were overwhelmed. Although 250 were actually exposed and 28 showed signs of radiation sickness, 112,800 people were evaluated. When the Aum Shinri Kyo cult placed sarin on five trains in the Tokyo subway system on March 20, 1995, 4000 people made their own way to hospitals, 641 were transported by authorities, and 245 hospital staff and rescue personnel were contaminated due to poor or nonexistent decontamination procedures. 10",

A powerful change in thinking, also called a paradigm shift, occurred after the terror attacks: the health system came to be viewed as a foundation of national security. Another perspective has changed as well. In the event of a disaster, Emergency Medical Services (EMS), police, and fire have long been recognized as first responders. However, just recently, hospitals also have been designated as first responders-and first receivers. The value of the hospital in national security has been increased, and hospitals are recognized as safe havens in communities, the public expects hospitals to be prepared to care for their needs, and the hospital is now recognized as a first responder in emergencies. However, hospitals remain significantly underprepared to respond as effectively as the public expects. Most importantly, preparedness is at direct odds with productivity. Daily operating requirements stretch most hospitals' resources. Allocating funds to improve emergency response capabilities that may never be used could be viewed as foolhardy. Community integration is now seen as necessary, but hospitals (other than those in networks or that are government facilities) have had few reasons to build healthy relationships with other hospitals in their communities. To meet the needs of communities in a disaster, business competitors must work as partners.",

Nurses accustomed to a certain nurseto-patient ratio may find the ratio in a disaster much higher and have to adapt practice accordingly.
