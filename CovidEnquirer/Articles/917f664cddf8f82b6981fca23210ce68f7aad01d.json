The causative agent of ECE was demonstrated to be a novel ferret coronavirus (FRCoV) belonging to the genus Alphacoronavirus (1, 2) . Ferrets with ECE showed general clinical signs of lethargy, anorexia, and vomiting and had foul-smelling, green mucous-laden diarrhea. A systemic infection of ferrets closely resembling feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) was subsequently reported among ferrets in the United States and Europe. The causative agent was also shown to be an Alphacoronavirus, which was named ferret systemic coronavirus (FRSCV) (3, 4) ; this virus was found to be genetically distinct from those associated with ECE and from 2 viruses assigned to different genotypes (5) . Other cases of ECE and ferret infectious peritonitis have since been described in the United States and in Europe (2) (3) (4) 6, 7) . One case of pathology-confirmed FIP-like disease has been described among domestic ferrets in Japan (8) . The goal of this study was to determine the prevalence of coronavirus among domestic ferrets seen by veterinarians in various parts of Japan.",

            "text": "We established a sensitive RT-PCR method using a new primer pair to detect coronavirus sequences and demonstrated that ferret coronaviruses are widespread among ferrets in Japan. We determined the partial nucleotide sequences of the spike gene of 23 strains and found they were clearly divided into 2 genotypes, 1 and 2 (Figure 2) . The reported ferret coronaviruses associated with FIP-like disease, designated as genotype 1 by Wise et al. (5) , all fell within genotype 1 phylogenetically, whereas all published ECE-causing strains fell within genotype 2. This finding leads to a possible conclusion that FIPlike disease-causing strains (i.e., FRSCVs) are variants of what has been designated genotype 1 ferret coronaviruses. Because we found no relationship between the 2 genotypes of ferret coronavirus and the type of disease (Table 1) , we cannot determine whether FIP-like and ECE-like ferret coronaviruses circulate independently as distinct entities or evolve, like feline coronaviruses, from more ubiquitous and less pathogenic enzootic strains. Nonetheless, the addition of these 23 new isolates to the phylogenetic tree of ferret coronaviruses tends to support the latter conclusion. Without extensive animal passage studies, virus isolation, and coronavirus-free ferrets, this theory may be difficult to confirm. However, additional evidence tends to link virulent pathotypes of ferret coronaviruses to specific mutational events. Nucleotide sequences of the 3c-like protein genes of FRSCV, MSU-1 (DDBJ/EMBL-Bank/GenBank accession no. GU338456), MSU-S (GU459059), and WADL (GU459058), showed that 2, MSU-1 and WADL, possessed a truncated 3c-like protein gene (5), similar to that described for FIP viruses of cats (12) (13) (14) . FIP-causing viruses of cats also contain a second mutation in the spike gene (15) , which was not investigated in our study. The existence of 2 major genotypes of Japanese ferret coronaviruses is also reminiscent of the serotype I and II feline coronaviruses. Without ferret coronaviruses that can be grown in cell culture, however, such serologic differentiation will be difficult. \u2020RT-PCR was carried out by using FRCoV-specific primers.",
