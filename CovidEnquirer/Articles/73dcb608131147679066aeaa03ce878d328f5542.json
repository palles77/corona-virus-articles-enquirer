            "text": "The aim of this study was to evaluate some immunological patterns involved in natural and acquired resistance against MHV3 using the original model of genetically modified lines of mice selected for high (H III ) and low (L III ) antibody responsiveness. As previously shown, a lower pre-existing anti-MHV antibody level was found in susceptible H III mice as compared to resistant L III mice. Mortality rates of the F 1 (H \u00c2 L) hybrids and F 2 and backcross segregants reflected co-dominance of both characters and the survivors had higher preexisting anti-MHV antibody titers. The present data show that both lines had the potential to synthesize antibodies and that the resistance acquired by the susceptible H III mice paralleled the antibody synthesis. Nevertheless, higher antibody titers were necessary to confer resistance in H III mice than in L III ones. When compared to uvMHV3, a single immunization with a related infectious MHV strain induced a higher antibody synthesis and led the H III mice to resist the MHV3 challenge. A direct correlation between the antibody level and resistance to infection was always observed in H III mice. Although mounting a Th2 response as indicated by IgG1 responses, they were also able to readily synthesize large amounts of IgG2a antibodies after immunization or during infection, reflecting a Th1 response. The transfer of anti-MHV antibodies to susceptible H III mice was capable of conferring resistance to MHV3, providing the antibodies were present before virus infection and in large amounts. The resistance and the survival time of these animals increased with the level of antibody administered. If these direct and clear data suggest that H III mice can acquire resistance through antibodies, the basis of the resistance of the resistant L III mice may rely on mechanisms less dependent on antibodies.",

Homozygosity for the high or low production of antibodies was attained by bi-directional selective breeding after several generations and in addition to differences in their responses to the selection antigen, the animals also show high or low responsiveness to non related immunogens (Siqueira et al., 1976; Nilsson et al., 1979; Ibanez et al., 1988; de Franco et al., 1996) . As previously stated and recently expressed in an editorial (Boyartchuk & Dietrich, 2002) , the advantage of this experimental model in relation to inbred lines of mice is the availability, in the H and L lines, of genetically homogeneous relevant loci controlling the general character, that allow the study of correlations between distinct immunobiological parameters. We have shown that the selected multi-specific immune response genes may act on a virus-specific immunity, as in a study of rabies infection where the selected high and low lines exhibited, respectively, a high or low degree of resistance to rabies challenge following specific vaccination, correlating with the high or low specific antibody responsiveness (Nilsson et al., 1979) .",

Although the resistance/ susceptibility is not influenced by the route of virus inoculation, animals infected subcutaneously (sc) show a mean survival time (mst) twice as high in comparison to animals infected intravenously (iv) or intraperitoneally (ip) (Vassa \u0192 o et al., 1994a) . These findings indicated that resistance against MHV3 depends on both genetic and environmental factors. These studies showed a direct inter-and intrapopulational correlation between the pre-existing antibody titers against MHV3 and the mortality rate (Vassa \u0192 o et al., 1994b) . Pope et al. (1996) , working with genetically homogeneous mouse lines, have shown that after MHV3 immunization, the resistant A/J mice mount preferentially a Th1 cellular immune response and the susceptible BALB/c mice preferentially a Th2 one, as evaluated by the ability of primary cell lines to produce a cytokine profile consistent with Th1 or Th2 phenotype (IL-2 and IFNg or IL-4 respectively). Their experiments, designed to alter resistance/ susceptibility by neutralizing in vivo the Th1 cytokine IFNg in A/J mice or the Th2 cytokine IL-4 in BALB/c mice, led to loss of resistance among A/J mice but failed to improve survival among BALB/c mice.",

The mortality rates of the hybrids and the segregants showed a co-dominance of the susceptible and resistance characters in all these populations, as shown by the mortality analysis. The survivors had pre-existing anti-MHV antibody titers higher (ranging from 7.2 to 8 log 2 ) than those found in mice which died (ranging from 4.7 to 5.6 log 2 ) and also higher than those found in the parental resistant L III mice; thus, for this phenotype, there exists an over dominance of high responsiveness. These data indicate a positive correlation between the antibody titers present in the serum and resistance to the experimental infection with MHV3. Animals showing higher antibody titers (> 5.9 log 2 ) survived the infection and those showing lower antibody titers (< 5.6 log 2 ) died. No variation of mean survival time was observed among the groups. Thus, it could be deduced from the data in Table 1 , that among the genetically heterogeneous mice, anti-MHVantibody titers greater than 5.9 log 2 would predict resistance and mice expressing titers less than 5.6 log 2 should be susceptible to MHV3.",

Moreover, it became clear that higher antibody titers are necessary to confer resistance in H III mice than in L III mice. With equivalent antibody titers of about 6 log 2 , the mortality rates were 0% in the L and 80% in the H lines (Fig. 1) .

H III mice had a background serum level of 3.3 log 2 and 21 days after the uvMHV3 hyper-immunization the serum antibody level attained 8.7 log 2 (an increase of 5.4 log 2 ). The L III mice showed a background and a final serum antibody level of 6.2 and 10.2 log 2 respectively (an increase of 4 log 2 ) (Fig. 1) . This was even more evident when a 10 day single immunization was performed with the related infectious MHV4 (increase of 7 log 2 for H III mice and 4.1 log 2 for L III mice) ( Table 2) . When compared to uvMHV3, the immunization with related infectious MHV strains induced a significantly higher serum antibody response and led the H III mice to resist the infection with the pathogen ( Table 2) . As evaluated by ELISA, in both mouse populations the IgG2a antibody isotype was preferentially produced after infection with MHV3 or MHVA59, and the IgG1 isotype is predominant after the uvMHV3 immunization. When compared to L III mice, the H III mice were capable of producing higher and remarkable levels of both IgG1 and IgG2a antibodies following infection with MHVA59 or hyper immunization with uvMHV3. These data confirm, at the isotype level, the higher ability of the H III line to respond to an antigenic stimulation (Table 3) . Moreover, the IgG1 and IgG2a isotype production were more homogeneous for H III than for L III mice, as shown by the variance values.",

Studies on challenge immunity to some MHV have indicated that the immunity to some strains is strong and highly virus strain-specific (Barthold & Smith, 1989) . Antibodies directed to the surface S glycoprotein or to the nucleoprotein and even Fab antiviral antibody fragments were able to protect mice in vivo (Lecomte et al., 1987; Barthold & Smith, 1989; Lamarre & Talbot, 1995) . Barthold and Smith (1989) have shown that mice immunized with a given live virus strain express high resistance to the same MHV strain, but remain highly susceptible to challenge with another MHV strain. The authors emphasize the hypothesis of host immunity dependence on the variation of the surface glycoprotein found in the virion that could explain the susceptibility to a heterologous challenge. On the other hand, some mouse strains are highly susceptible to MHV and hardly acquire resistance to infection, and others can easily become resistant (Lucchiari et al., 1991) . Although different MHV strains differ substantially in their pathogenicity they express similar structure and composition (McIntosh, 1985) .",

Among hybrids and segregants, that showed codominance for the susceptible and resistant characters, only animals showing an antibody level over 6 log 2 resisted a challenge (Table 1 ). In kinetic studies of antibody production after immunization, the resistance acquired by H III mice paralleled antibody synthesis and animals crossing a barrier of 6 log 2 titer became resistant (Fig. 1) . Hyper-immunization with uvMHV3 or immunization with antigenically related MHV4 or MHVA59 (Table 2) induced the same acquired resistance pattern. These strains were able to provide resistance inasmuch as the antibody titer before challenge was higher than 6 log 2 . This observation was confirmed by experiments of passive antibody transfer, which showed that resistance of H III mice to MHV3 infection and also the mean survival time increased as a function of the level of antibodies administered (Table 4 ).

It may indicate that lower titers are necessary for the L III mice to express resistance and/or that the resistance is not based only on this trait. The explanation for this observation, although influenced by the inherent high or low response, may be found in the immune response showed by immunized mice: L III mice, in accordance with their genetic trait, showed a modest but preferential Th1 type response after infection, as indicated by the IgG2a isotype synthesis (Table 3) . On the other hand, H III mice were shown to mount a Th2 response, reflected by the high levels of the IgG1 isotype, which promotes several inhibitory/suppressive processes. Further, the H III mice, as high responders, following infection or immunization were also capable of mounting a Th1 response, reflected by the high levels of the IgG2a isotype.

The mechanism involving the antiviral state induced by IFNg in macrophages may play a central role only in the resistance of L III mice (Vassa \u0192 o et al., 1994a) . Susceptible lines, such as H III mice, would not acquire resistance through IFNg since their macrophages do not respond with an antiviral state.",
