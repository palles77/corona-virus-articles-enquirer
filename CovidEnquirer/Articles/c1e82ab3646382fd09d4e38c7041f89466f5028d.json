            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) strain JHM is a coronavirus that causes encephalitis and demyelination in susceptible rodents. The known receptors for MHV are all members of the carcinoembryonic antigen family. Although human forms of the MHV receptor can function as MHV receptors in some assays, no human cell line has been identified that can support wild-type MHV infection. Here we describe the infection of a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HuH-7, with MHV. HuH-7 cells were susceptible to strains JHM-DL and JHM-DS, yielding virus titers nearly identical to those seen in mouse DBT cells. In contrast, HuH-7 cells were only marginally susceptible or completely resistant to infection by other MHV strains, including A59. JHM produced a strong cytopathic effect in HuH-7 cells with the formation of round plaques. Studies of various recombinant viruses between JHM and A59 strains suggested that the ability of JHM to infect HuH-7 cells was determined by multiple viral genetic elements. Blocking the viral spike (S) protein with a neutralizing antibody or a soluble form of the MHV receptor inhibited infection of HuH-7 cells, suggesting that infection is mediated through the S protein. Transfection with the prototype mouse receptor, biliary glycoprotein, rendered HuH-7 cells susceptible to infection by other MHV strains as well, suggesting that JHM uses a receptor distinct from the classical MHV receptor to infect HuH-7 cells. Possible implications for human disease are discussed.",

            "text": "The host range of a virus is often determined by the degree to which the sequence of its receptor is conserved among different animal species. A virus which uses a highly conserved protein or a sugar moiety as a receptor (e.g., vesicular stomatitis virus) will often display a wide host range as a result. Although most viruses are believed to use only one specific receptor, many examples of a single virus using alternate receptors or coreceptors have been documented in recent years (Geraghty et al., 1998; Moore et al., 1997; Selinka et al., 1998; Smith and Vanderplasschen, 1998; Thoulouze et al., 1998) . Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), for example, can use several different chemokine receptors to gain entry into CD4-positive cells (Moore et al., 1997) . Different isolates of HIV display tropism for either macrophages or T cells, depending on the coreceptor recognized. Similarly, mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a coronavirus, has been shown to be capable of using any one of a number of carcinoembryonic antigen (CEA)-related proteins as a receptor (Chen et al., 1995 (Chen et al., , 1997 Dveksler et al., 1993; Lai, 1992, 1994) .",

Of the known CEArelated proteins, JHM can apparently use only the prototype MHV receptor mouse biliary glycoprotein (mBGP). mBGP is expressed primarily in the liver and intestine and interacts with the MHV spike (S) protein to allow virus entry (Dveksler et al., 1991; Kubo et al., 1994; Williams et al., 1990 ). Yet, paradoxically, JHM causes very little hepatitis or enteritis in normal mice. Instead, it infects glial cells and neurons, causing a neurological disease that resembles the human disease multiple sclerosis (Fleury et al., 1980; Goto et al., 1977; Herndon et al., 1975; Powell and Lampert, 1975) . This apparent paradox has led some to speculate that JHM may have the ability to use some undiscovered receptor or coreceptor to infect cells within the central nervous system (Chen et al., 1995) .",

For instance, the two human coronavirus strains 229E and OC43 are not known to have any animal reservoir. Likewise, MHV infects only mice, although some strains (including JHM) are able to infect rats (Compton et al., 1993; Nagashima et al., 1978) . However, replication of JHM has been detected in the brains of experimentally infected owl monkeys after either peripheral or intracerebral inoculation (Cabirac et al., 1994; Murray et al., 1992b Murray et al., , 1997 , indicating that the host range of JHM may be broader than originally believed. In addition, long-term passage of susceptible mouse 17 Cl-1 cells persistently infected with MHV strain A59 has yielded a mutant virus strain capable of infecting a broad range of cell lines, including some human cell lines, demonstrating a theoretical potential for cross-species infection and an altered receptor specificity (Schickli et al., 1997) .",

This underscores the fact, first deduced from studies of MHV-resistant mouse cell lines, that more than one tissue-specific cellular factor is known to be required for successful MHV entry and/or uncoating . Here, we report the infection of a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line, HuH-7, with wild-type MHV strains JHM-DL and JHM-DS. We characterize the mechanism of viral infection. This finding raises the possibility that, under certain conditions, MHV may have the potential to infect humans.",

To examine the possibility that the differentiated hepatic factors may promote cellular susceptibility to MHV infection, we infected HuH-7 cells with various MHV strains. MHV was adsorbed to nearly confluent HuH-7 and mouse DBT cell monolayers for 1 h at 37\u00b0C. The cells were then washed and incubated in growth medium for 24 h at 37\u00b0C. Of all the MHV strains tested, the neurotropic strains JHM-DL and JHM-DS caused significant cytopathic effects in HuH-7 cells with the formation of syncytial plaques, indicating that these two strains were able to infect HuH-7 cells (data not shown). All other strains showed no evident cytopathic effect on HuH-7 cells. To detect possible virus replication in the absence of apparent cytopathic effects, infected cells were fixed and stained for the expression of the viral nucleocapsid (N) protein (Fig. 1) . All virus strains replicated in DBT cells, as shown by the prescence of N protein staining. In contrast, N protein staining was detected only in HuH-7 cells infected with strains JHM-DL and JHM-DS. N protein was predominantly localized in the cytoplasm of fused cells and was most highly concentrated in the perinuclear region in both cell types. These results indicated that JHM-DL and JHM-DS can infect HuH-7 cells.",

The latter antibody can detect the Ku antigen in primate cells but not in mouse cells (Wang et al., 1993) . Cells were fixed at 8 h postinfection, before syncytia appeared in HuH-7 cells, ensuring that cells were infected individually rather than by cell fusion. As shown in Fig. 2 , infected mouse DBT cells were not stained by the anti-Ku monoclonal antibody. In contrast, all the HuH-7 cells were positive for Ku antigen staining in the nucleus. The individually infected HuH-7 cell was positive for Ku staining in the nucleus and MHV structural protein staining in the cytoplasm. These results indicate that the infected HuH-7 cells were indeed of primate origin (Fig. 2) .",

JHM-DL replicated at the same pace as JHM-DS in HuH-7 cells, but yielded a slightly lower virus titer from HuH-7 cells than from DBT cells. The growth curves for both JHM strains on HuH-7 cells mirrored their growth curves on DBT cells. In contrast, A59 yielded a significantly lower virus titer from HuH-7 cells than from DBT cells (Figs. 3 and 4), and the viral growth kinetics demonstrated that the virus titer for A59 peaked at a later time in HuH-7 cells than in DBT cells and never reached the peak titers of strains JHM-DS and JHM-DL. Thus, A59 can also infect HuH-7 cells, but with low efficiency.

J.7.2 completely blocked infection of DBT cells at 24 h postinoculation when assayed by immunostaining of viral N protein ( Table 1) . Infection of HuH-7 cells was also significantly inhibited by J.7.2 antibody; the number of plaques was significantly reduced, but the blockade of infection was not complete, possibly suggesting slightly different mechanisms of infection for these two cell types (Table 1) . Similarly, the virus titers produced from DBT and HuH-7 cells were also reduced to approximately the same extent. These results suggest that the same functional moiety of the viral S protein is involved in the infection of DBT cells and HuH-7 cells.",

At 24 h postinfection, all recombinants tested produced virus titers between 1 \u03eb 10 4 and 2 \u03eb 10 5 PFU/ml from DBT cells (data not shown). Replication in HuH-7 cells was highly variable, however, among recombinant viruses. Each of the recombinants B1, IL27, EL3, IL6, and EL7, which were derived from JHM-DL and A59, grew very poorly, if at all, in HuH-7 cells. The virus titers produced from HuH-7 cells were lower than those of either parental strain. In contrast, the recombinants CA13 and CA43, which were derived from JHM-X and A59, grew at least as well as their parental strains. Recombinant CA13 especially rivaled the growth of JHM-DL and JHM-DS, consistently achieving virus titers more than 10-fold greater than those of its parental strains JHM-X and A59. These patterns of infectivity displayed by different MHV recombinants are not consistent with the idea that any single viral gene is the sole determinant of infectivity on HuH-7 cells. These results thus suggest that several viral genetic loci may contribute to the replication ability of MHV on HuH-7 cells and that interaction between these loci or their encoded proteins may affect this biological property.",

Titers are given in PFU/ml. layers with a mammalian expression plasmid encoding mBGP (MHVR1). This plasmid has previously been shown to render Cos-7 cells susceptible to infection by all MHV strains (Chen et al., 1997; Yokomori and Lai, 1992) . At 72 h posttransfection, cells were infected with strains A59, MHV-2, and JHM-DS and were assayed for virus production, plaque formation, and viral N protein production 24 h later. Similar to the effects on Cos-7 cells, the exogenous expression of mBGP in HuH-7 cells increased the numbers of infected cells as assayed by N protein immunostaining (Fig. 7) and increased the virus titers produced from the infected cells (Table 2 ). These results suggest that HuH-7 cells lack only sufficient amounts of the proper receptor to allow entry of A59 and MHV-2. It is notable that the infectivity of HuH-7 cells by JHM also increased following the transfection of mBGP (MHVR1), suggesting that the endogenous receptor responsible for JHM entry may be present only in a subset of the cultured HuH-7 cells at a level sufficient to allow infection. It is also worth noting that the mBGP-expressing HuH-7 cells infected with A59 or MHV-2 remained mostly as single cells, in contrast to the syncytia seen in JHM-DS-infected cells. This finding further confirms that A59 did not cause fusion in HuH-7 cells. Thus, the mechanism of JHM-induced cell fusion in HuH-7 cells is likely different from that in mouse DBT cells.",

Despite experiments designed to test just such a hypothesis, coronaviruses have been neither established nor ruled out as a potential viral cause of multiple sclerosis in humans (Dalgleish, 1997; Johnson, 1994; Kurtzke, 1993; Poser, 1994) . Indeed, Murray et al. (1992a) found that 12 of 22 brains from multiple sclerosis patients and none of the controls showed hybridization to a murine-like coronavirus probe. The most likely role, if any, of coronaviruses in human multiple sclerosis would be through the activation of autoreactive T cells that could result in demyelination. This process has been described to occur in JHM-infected rodents, as evidenced by active demyelination by otherwise healthy rats following the adoptive transfer of T cells from JHM-infected animals (Watanabe et al., 1983) .",

This extended host range is believed to occur through altered interactions with CEA-related proteins that can serve as receptors Schickli et al., 1997) . In contrast, we show in this study that MHV strains JHM-DS and JHM-DL, which have not undergone any intentional artificial selection, are able to infect HuH-7 cells without any additional manipulation. Notably, HepG2 cells remain essentially resistant to this virus, indicating that the infection of HuH-7 cells by the JHM strains used in this study is not due to the same relaxation of CEA-related receptor specificity seen with MHV-H2. The actual receptor for JHM on HuH-7 cells remains unknown. It has been previously demonstrated in Cos-7 cells that although A59 and MHV-2 can utilize human BGP and/or human CEA as a receptor, JHM cannot (Chen et al., 1997) . Consistent with this finding, a neutralizing polyclonal antibody against hCEA was unable to significantly inhibit the infection of HuH-7 cells by JHM-DL. Thus, hCEA and hBGP are probably not used as receptors by JHM for the infection of HuH-7 cells. Furthermore, transfection of HuH-7 cells with mBGP allows infection by A59 and MHV-2, as well as by JHM, still more evidence that the susceptibility of HuH-7 cells to JHM infection occurs at the level of a (yet unidentified) receptor. The identification of this putative receptor might shed light on the characteristic cellular tropism of JHM in mouse brain.",

Supernatant from virus-infected HuH-7 cells in Fig. 7 was harvested at 9 h postinfection and used for plaque assay on DBT cells. Values are given in PFU/ml. against the viral S protein or by a soluble form of the MHV receptor mBGP. Thus, the same epitope of the S protein involved in the infection of mouse cells appears also to be involved in the infection of HuH-7 cells. However, the formation of syncytia could be inhibited by an anti-S antibody only in DBT cells and not in HuH-7 cells (Table 1) . Also, A59 did not cause syncytia to form in infected HuH-7 cells either after direct infection or following transfection of mBGP (MHVR1). This result suggests that, at least in this cell line, the processes of virus-cell fusion (leading to initial infection) and cell-cell fusion (leading to syncytia formation and cell-cell spread of virus) may not share the same mechanism. This conclusion is consistent with the finding that some monoclonal antibodies directed against the S protein will block infection but not fusion of mouse cells by MHV, while others will block fusion but not infection (Kubo et al., 1993) .",

However, it appears that most of the recombinants containing the leader sequence as well as genes 1 and 2 from A59 (roughly two-thirds of the genome) are capable of infecting HuH-7 cells, but those containing the remaining 3\u0408 end of the A59 genome appear to infect poorly, suggesting that some of these 3\u0408 end genes from A59 may suppress the infection or replication of MHV in HuH-7 cells. Conversely, the 5\u0408 two-thirds of the genome from strain JHM-X also appear to suppress efficient infection, since their replacement with A59 sequences (as demonstrated by recombinant CA13) results in a significant increase in titer. These results imply that several loci within the viral genome may contribute to the efficiency of infection and/or replication of MHV in HuH-7 cells and that recombination between MHV strains can result in cis-complementation between these loci.",

This theory is consistent with the observation that HuH-7 cells infected with A59 produced detectable levels of virus particles (Fig. 4) but produced no plaques (Fig. 1) . The hemagglutinin esterase (HE) protein will agglutinate red blood cells and is necessary for infection by some coronaviruses, e.g., bovine coronavirus (Deregt et al., 1989) . HE expression may also alter the tropism and virulence of MHV in mice Zhang et al., 1998) .

Likewise, we could not demonstrate a significant difference in fusion activity or infectivity in HuH-7 cells between variants of JHM which express different amounts of HE (data not shown). Thus, the viral gene product responsible for plaque formation in HuH-7 cells remains unclear. The question of whether humans can be (or have been) infected by JHM may prove difficult to answer. The identification of a human liver cell line that is susceptible to JHM infection is an important step, however. The possibility arises that JHM might be capable of causing human hepatitis. Equally important is the prospect of identifying a JHM-specific receptor in HuH-7 cells that might help to explain the peculiar pathology of JHM in rodents.",
