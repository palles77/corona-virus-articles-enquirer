All these patients were asymptomatic and chest CT scanning indicated that 12 of them even showed improvement while rest of them represented with no obvious change compared with previous images. With a few days of prophylactic intervention with Chinese herbal medicine, the RT-PCR results of virus mRNA detection were all turning to negative in both nasopharyngeal swab and cloacal swab samples.",

These asymptomatic carriers brought more challenges to the manager and control of COVID-19 epidemic in China and any other affected countries. We further got a glance at the factors associated with COVID-19 clearance. Due to the lack of antiviral drugs with confirmed efficiency on COVID-19, it is possible that some immunological parameters could be used as additional indicators to properly assess the virus activity and the needs for prolonged quarantine in asymptomatic patients. Further case-control study and cohort study will be needed to pursue the indication role on that.",
