Genetic material is carried on a single strand of DNA, unlike the genetic material of eukaryotic cells. which is organized into chromosomes. Some bacteria contain additional DNA molecules called plasmids, which are not essential for the organism's life but can confer on it very special properties such as resistance to antibiotics. Plasmids are most commonly found in Gramnegative bacteria and can spread from one cell to another. Surrounding the bacterial cell cytoplasm is a thin, selectively permeable, elastic, lipoprotein membrane -the plasma membrane. It is the site of action of many of the bacterial enzymes and controls entry of substances into the cell. Being elastic, the cell membrane does not determine the shape of the bacterial cell. This is the function of the cell wall, a rigid, permeable structure principally composed of a substance called murein. Because of the osmotic pressure of the cytoplasm, the cell membrane is usually pushed hard against the inside of the cell wall by a pressure of up to 20 atmospheres. The cell wall is relatively thick, especially in Gram-positive bacteria, and is chemically unrelated to the cell walls of higher plants.",

This layer might also inhibit antibody formation against the bacteria, thereby rendering the bacteria more harmful to the body.

The next step is the decolourizing process, in which the slide is treated with a solvent. A counterstain completes the process and the slide is viewed under the microscope.

Viruses can infect any form of higher organism and are usually divided into animal viruses, plant viruses and bacteriophages. Viruses consist of either RNA or DNA (never both) surrounded by a layer of protein (capsid) or a membrane (referred to as the envelope). The outer covering of the virus particle plays a vital role in the initial infection of the cell and the spread of a virus within the host. The components of the covering layer are very antigenic and are involved in the host's immune response. Capsids are rigid structures and tend to be very protective against adverse environments such as desiccation and detergents. Such viruses tend to retain their infectivity on fomites and will withstand the adverse conditions in the gut, i.e. low pH and the presence of proteases. Envelopes are less protective and can be disrupted by acids, detergents and drying out.

In any population there will be a proportion of organisms that are resistant to the agent. In the presence of the agent these will be selected and will form the majority of the population. Some bacteria develop resistance by altering their metabolic pathways to avoid those with which the antimicrobial interacts. Other bacteria produce enzymes capable of destroying the chemical, e.g. penicillinase, which is an enzyme produced by certain strains of staphylococci and is capable of breaking down penicillin.",

Normal contaminants will harbour bacteria, protect them from antibacterial agents, provide them with nutrients and inactivate disinfectants. Jacobs (1986) has laid down simple infection control guidelines for optometrists and contact lens practitioners. Basically, anything that can be boiled without adversely affecting its performance should be, e.g. bowls, soft contact lenses. Items of equipment that will touch the eye should be swabbed with 70% alcohol, e.g. tonometer heads, chin rests, trial frames. Working surfaces should be treated with 1% sodium hypochlorite solution, which is effective against bacteria and viruses. At levels as low as 500 ppm (0.05%) this solution destroys herpes simplex, adenovirus 8 and enterovirus 70 within 10 minutes (Naginton et al 1983) . Such procedures will protect the patient more than will a prophylactic eye drop.",
