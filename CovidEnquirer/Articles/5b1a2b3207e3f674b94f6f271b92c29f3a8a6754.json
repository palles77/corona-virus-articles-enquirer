However, the alerting clinical parameters of cardiac injury after COVID-19 infection and the correlation between cardiac injury and the COVID-19 severity remains to be determined. In this retrospective, single-center study, we recruited 41 consecutive cases of COVID-19 patients admitted to Beijing Youan Hospital, China from Jan 21 to Feb 03, 2020. We selected the indicators, including heart rate (HR), Troponin I (TnI) and epicardial adipose tissue (EAT) observed on chest computed tomographic (CT) scan, that is high related to cardiac injury. Tachycardia, TnI elevation and a trend of lower threshold attenuation EAT density in CT scan have been observed in severe and critical patients. Our results suggested that main attentions should be paid on monitoring the high risk factors of arrhythmia and cardiac function, including HR, TnI, and radiographic feature, that is, EAT density, to protect the COVID-19 patients from cardiac injury.",

The median age was 47 years (35.5-64, range between 15-89 years). 18 patients have been discharged, 21 patients are still in hospital and 2 patients died (their ages were 82 and 65). Old adult male patients are more prone to be in severe conditions (P<0.01). The level of lymphocyte percentage of the severe and critical patients was lower than those of light and mild patients. We found that the level of TnI, one of the cardiac biomarkers, is remarkably higher in critical group (P<0.01) than in other groups, indicative of high risk of cardiac injury. The high level of c-reactive protein (CRP) in critical group (P<0.01) indicated that the occurring of acute inflammation.

Our results suggested the occurrence of cardiac injury in COVID-19 patients. TnI has been widely used as one of the key biomarkers in cardiac injury [2] . In our study, all 3 patients in the critical group and 1 patient in the severe group showed the rising level of TnI. However, patients in light or mild group have no significant TnI elevation. Thus, TnI may be served as severity indicator of cardiac injury in COVID-19 patient. In terms of tachycardia, 2 of 3 patients with Tachycardia had the onset of atrial fibrillation, and their peak heart rates reached up to 160 bpm. However, it is not the case in light and mild group. Compared to another coronavirus, SARS in 2003, tachycardia has also been noticed in patients with SARS [5] . Even in recovery phase the rest HR in SARS patients exceeded 90 bpm, and 72.1% patients have HR above 100 bmp after mild exercises. In our study, the elevation of HR is disproportionate with the increase of the body temperature, however, is related with lower SPO2. Higher HR is most likely resulting in worsen prognosis, and tachycardia should be paid extra attention to COVID-19 patients. It is suggested that electrocardiogram (ECG) should also be monitored to specify the classification of tachycardia in the future study.",

These findings were consistent with previous studies that COVID-19 caused multiple organic dysfunction and poor prognosis in patients with complications [1] . In a previous study of 1700 SARS patients, the presence of diabetes mellitus and/or cardiac diseases was related both to a higher mortality rate and an adverse outcome [5] . Diabetes mellitus; heart disease; and chronic lung disease were reported more frequently among MERS case-patients than among healthy controls [6, 7] .

Moreover, patients requiring ICU admission had higher concentrations of GCSF, IP10, MCP1, MIP1A, and TNF\u03b1 than those non-ICU admission [2] . These previous researches supported that the cytokine storm, not be induced by direct virus infection, but was associated with cardiac inflammation in COVID-19 patients. In addition, the rising level of CRP in COVID-19 patients also indicated the occurrence of inflammation in the circulation. In another aspect, EAT, defined as fat within the pericardial sac, has increased inflammatory cytokine expression in patients with CAD at the tissue level [4, 9] . Thus, to further understand the inflammatory in COVID-19 patients, we quantified EAT density in CT scans, in which the lower CT threshold attenuation value considered as the indicator of inflammation [4] . We found that the mean CT threshold attenuation value of EAT in the critical, severe and mild group, were lower than patients in the light group. Patients from severe and critical group had a lower CT threshold attenuation value than the reported heathy heart. This results suggested that lower EAT density showed the cardiac inflammation in COVID-19 patients.",
