It is also expressed by leukaemic blasts of a small group of patients suffering from acute or chronic lymphoid leukaemia. Recently, the expression of the APN gene in T cell lines as well as the induction of APN gene and surface expression in human peripheral T cells by mitogenic activation have been demonstrated. Here, by means of cytofluorimetric analysis evidence is provided, that the induction of APN surface expression is partially resistent to the action of the inhibitors of protein biosynthesis, puromycin and cycloheximide, and is not prevented by tunicamycin, an inhibitor of glycosylation.",

It is highly expressed in the intestine, where it participates in the final hydrolysis of ingested nutrients, as well as in the kidney and to some lower extent in other tissues (2, 3) . Aminopeptidase N is supposed to be involved in the degradation of neuropeptides, cytokines and angiotensin (4) (5) (6) , but the physiological role of the lymphocyte-derived enzyme remains unclear. Recently, two excellent studies gave evidence that the CD13 antigen may function as a corona virus receptor in epithelial cells (7, 8) . APN seems to playa role in tumor invasion and was shown to contribute in the degradation of collagen type IV (9) . Furthermore, APN has been reported to be implicated in the antigen processing (10) .",

The induction of CD13 on T cells (21) or natural killer cells (22) derived from synovial fluid of patients suffering from rheumatoid arthritis might be a response to some stimulating signal, too.

The aim of this study was to analyze the role of protein biosynthesis and glycosylation on the induction of CD13 (APN) surface expression. Therefore, the effects of the inhibitors of protein biosynthesis, cycloheximide and puromycin, and of the inhibitor of glycosylation, tunicamycin, on the activation-dependent generation of CD13-positive T cells were compared to those on the induction of other leukocyte surface antigens, namely CD25, CD69 and CD95. The induction of these glycoproteins occurs in a clearly defined sequence: CD69, CD25, and CD95. There is evidence for a very rapid induction of CD13 on granulocytes and monocytes (29) , an observation which is consistent with our own data showing that CD13 surface expression of peripheral T cells is detectable as early as one day after stimulation.",

The authors also highlight the importance of a correct timing of biosynthesis in relation to highmannose glycosylation to facilitate proper ternary and quarternary conformations. On this background it must be concluded that the induction of CD13 on activated T cells in spite of the presence of tunicamycin is not fully dependent on de novo protein biosynthesis. This would require the existence of a mechanism independent of biosynthesis aiding CD13 surface expreSSIOn.",

            "text": "In support of this assumption, in T cells the induction of CD13 surface expression also appeared to be relatively resistant to the inhibition of protein biosynthesis. The surface induction of CD13 in response to T cell activation was slightly decreased by the inhibitors of protein synthesis, cycloheximide or puromycin. In contrast, puromycin strongly diminished the generation of CD25-positive cells and partially inhibited the development of CD69 and CD95 surface expression. Cycloheximide markedly decreased surface expression of CD25, CD69 and CD95, whereas CD13 induction remained unaffected. This phenomenom is strongly reminding of the situation in granulocytes/monocytes reported earlier by others. WERFEL et al. (29) demonstrated that after stimulation of leukocytes by the anaphylatoxin C5a there was an increase of CD13 membrane expression within minutes on both granulocytes and monocytes, an effect not prevented by the action of cycloheximid. The authors suggested, therefore, that pre-formed, mature CD13 molecules are rapidly translocated from internal storage sites to the cell surface after stimulation. By analogy with the data presented in this study we propose a similar mechanism underlying the rapid activation-dependent CD13 surface expression in human peripheral T cells measured 20 hours after stimulation. This view is supported by the detection of immunoreactive CD13 in resting T cells by means of immunofluorescence microscopy (Fig. 4) . From these investigations it is also apparent, that this early induction of CD13, which is largely independent of protein biosynthesis, is superimposed by the slowly on-going induction of APN gene expression peaking at days 3 or 4 after activation. In contrast to the short-time culture performed in this study, the surface expression of CD13 observed later is dependent on newly synthesized CD13. In support of this view, in T cells there is a dramatic increase of APN-mRNA content 3 days after stimulation (27) . Because prolonged exposure of the T cells to inhibitors of the kind used in this study would cause severe damage to the cells, future studies of long-term effects will require other approaches.",
