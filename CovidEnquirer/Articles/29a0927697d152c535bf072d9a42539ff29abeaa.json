We investigated the S1 glycoprotein of 24 recent IBV isolates from chickens and demonstrated that two predominant genetic groups were circulating in southern Thailand between 2008 and 2013. Seven IBV variants, isolated from 2008 to 2009, were clustered in the Thailand THA001 group I while 15 IBV variants, isolated from 2009 to 2013, were classified into the QXlike group II. Moreover, a single isolate from a broiler was categorized into the Massachusetts-type, and an isolate from a layer belonged to the 4/91 type virus. Interestingly, both the IBV groups I and II were isolated from native chickens (62.5%) and caused a range of symptoms. Our results indicate that the QXlike viruses were predominant after 2009, replacing the THA001 type viruses. Furthermore, native chickens may contribute to the epidemiology of IB.",

IBV genome consists of a single-stranded RNA that encodes four structural proteins: envelope (E) glycoprotein, membrane (M) glycoprotein, nucleocapsid (N) protein, and spike (S) glycoprotein. The S glycoprotein of IBV, which forms large club-shaped projections, is a dimer or trimer (Cavanagh, 2007) . The S protein is formed by two non-covalently bound polypeptides, S1 and S2 (Stern and Sefton, 1982) . The function of the S1 protein is to attach to host cell receptor molecules. The S1 protein includes epitopes and determinants for virus neutralizing antibodies that provide protective immunity. Thus, S1 gene analysis has been widely used to differentiate IBV genotypes and serotypes (Cavanagh, 2007; Ignjatovic and Galli, 1994; Ladman et al., 2006) . It is well known that two major forces drive coronavirus evolution: mutations due to the high error rates of the viral RNA polymerase, and recombination of the S1 sequences. Thereby, these generate new strains or genotypes of IBV worldwide Yu et al., 2001) .",

Most birds were village chickens exhibiting mild to moderate symptoms associated with respiratory, enteric, and kidney signs and depression with low morbidity and mortality. Of the total cases submitted, 24 samples were IBV positive. Coinfections or secondary bacterial infections were not found in any diseased birds. Virus isolation and propagation were achieved by inoculating 0.2 ml of 10% (w/v) pooled and homogenized suspected tissues into the allantoic cavity of 9-to 11-day old antibodyfree embryonated chicken eggs (ECE), which came from healthy flocks screened for key poultry diseases (Guy, 2008) . Forty-eight to 72 hours after inoculation, the allantoic fluid and chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) were harvested. Following three to five blind passages, indirect fluorescent antibody test (IFA) was used to identify the causative virus. Briefly, frozen infected CAMs were acetonefixed, following this the slides were incubated with a nucleocapsid protein-specific mouse monoclonal antibody (clone Ch/IBV 48.4; Prionics, The Netherlands), for 30 min at 37\u00b0C. After washing three times with PBS, the slides were incubated with FITC-conjugated rabbit anti-mouse immunoglobulin (Dako, Denmark) for 30 min at 37\u00b0C to detect antibody binding. Next, the sections were washed in a similar manner and examined using epifluorescence microscopy at 100-200\u00d7 magnifications.",

The isolates in group I were highly related at the nucleotide and amino acid levels with 92.2-98% and 89.2-97.5% identities, respectively. The isolates of the QX-like group II shared 89.3-97.7% nucleotide identity and 85-95.8% amino acid identity to each other. Finally, we determined the phylogenetic relationships of the local isolates both with vaccine strains commercially used in Thailand and with the IBV sequences available in GenBank from other geographical origins. During this analysis, we found that the single isolates B/Sk3589/55 and L/Nk3251/56 fell within the Mass-type (Ma5 vaccine) and the 4/91 groups, respectively (Fig. 1) .",

The reasons for this are flock management system, mismatched vaccination, and emergence and reemergence of new variant strains. Extensive antigenic variation, caused by genetic mutation in the hypervariable region of the S1 glycoprotein, is a feature of IBV and new variants thereof . Moreover, the S1 protein is associated with virus-neutralizing epitopes, thereby inducing a strain-specific neutralizing antibody (de Wit et al., 2011; Hofstad, 1981) . In Thailand, commercially available IBV vaccines are applied in intensive poultry farming. Aside from commercial poultry, a limited number of backyard chickens are vaccinated. This is, at least in part, why IBVs are still prevalent. A better understanding of the genetic diversity of the IBV S1 gene from diverse geographies is essential for effective control and prevention of IB. Selection of proper vaccines is an ultimate goal for minimizing economic loss.",
