In this study, an immunochromatographic assay (ICA) based on a EuNPs-mAb fluorescent probe was developed and optimized for rapid detection of PEDV. The limit of detection (LOD) of the ICA was 0.218 \u03bcg/mL (2.725 \u00d7 10 3 TCID 50 /mL) and its linear detection range was 0.03125-8 \u03bcg/mL (3.91 \u00d7 10 2 -10 5 TCID 50 /mL). The ICA was also validated for the detection of PEDV in swine stool samples. 60 swine stool samples from southern China were analyzed by the ICA and RT-PCR, and the results showed that the coincidence rate of the ICA to RT-PCR was 86.67%, which was significantly higher than that of AuNPs based ICA. The ICA is sensitive and specific and can achieve on-site rapid detection of swine stool samples. Therefore, the ICA has a great potential for PED diagnosis and prevention.",

Epidemic PEDV strains spread rapidly and have a high mortality, which brings great economic losses to the pig industries [2, 3] . As early as the 1970s, PEDV was reported in European and Asian pig industries. Since then, PEDV has spread to the United States, Canada, Mexico, China, South Korea and other countries, and has induced a worldwide disease [4, 5] . PEDV has the highest incidence of all the pandemic viruses in China, accounting for about 46% of pandemic viruses [6, 7] . Clinically, PEDV and other porcine intestinal coronavirus infections have similar clinical symptoms, causing severe diarrhea, vomiting and atrophic enteritis. However, the other diseases have smaller clinical impacts and are less severe than that caused by PEDV [1, 8] . At present, the differential diagnosis of PEDV and other viruses is critical to control viral epidemic diarrhea. It is especially necessary to choose a detection method with high sensitivity, specificity and relatively low cost.",

These methods have both high precision and specificity [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] . However, they require precise experimental instruments and trained experimenters, and have certain restrictions on promoting grassroots production. Therefore, they are not ideal for on-site rapid detection of PEDV. In addition, immunological detection methods including serum neutralization experiments, immunofluorescence, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay and immunochromatography [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] have been used to detect PEDV and other pathogens. These detection methods are simple, specific and sensitive. We previously developed a method using the gold nanoparticle signal of a test strip based on monoclonal antibodies prepared with a PEDV isolate [16] . However, its coincidence rate with RT-PCR was only 74.07%. Since the results were not ideal, it is important to establish a more sensitive and accurate immunochromatographic test strip with characters of simple to operate and easy to observe in on-site applications.",

            "text": "Time-resolved fluorescence is fluorescence emitted by rare earth metals. Their chelates have the advantages of unique fluorescence, a narrow emission peak, a high quantum yield, a wide Stokes shift and a long fluorescence lifetime. A long period of fluorescence emission can delay the measurement of a fluorescent signal, allowing it to be distinguished from the background fluorescence that has a shorter half-life [21, 22] . Based on these advantages, interference between the excitation light and non-specific fluorescence can be excluded, leading to improvement of both the signal-to-noise ratio and sensitivity [23] , making them favourable probes for on-site rapid detection. Commonly used rare earth metals contain europium (Eu) and terbium (Tb) [24] . Europium is widely used throughout bioanalysis [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . Europium nanoparticles (EuNPs) are microspheres prepared by bonding Europium and its chelate to the surface of polystyrene microspheres [31] . Herein, EuNPs are used as a novel material for the preparation of time-resolved fluorescent test strips. The low interference from background fluorescence when using EuNPs results in improved sensitivity compared with conventional fluorescent test strips.",

The Eu nanoparticles used in the ICA have the advantages of a favourable excitation spectrum bandwidth, a long fluorescence lifetime, a sharp emission peak, a large Stokes displacement, high resolution, and low background. Under optimal conditions, the results of ICA used to detect PEDV indicate that the LOD is 0.218 \u03bcg/mL (2.725 \u00d7 10 3 TCID 50 /mL) and the linear detection range is 0.03125-8 \u03bcg/mL (3.91 \u00d7 10 2 -10 5 TCID 50 /mL). The specificity test results showed that there was approximately 5% cross-reaction between this ICA and CSFV, and the cross-reaction with other porcine viruses was less than 2%. The ICA was also validated for the PEDV detection in swine stool samples with little interference. To compare its accuracy to traditional detection methods, 60 swine stool samples from southern China were investigated with the newly developed ICA and RT-PCR. The Youden's index of the ROC used to find the optimal cut-off value and the positive coincidence rate of these two methods was 91.7%, the negative coincidence rate was 79.2%, and the total coincidence rate was 86.67%. In conclusion, the ICA is sensitive and specific and can be applied to on-site rapid detection of swine stool samples. Therefore, the ICA has great potential for PEDV diagnosis and prevention. ",
