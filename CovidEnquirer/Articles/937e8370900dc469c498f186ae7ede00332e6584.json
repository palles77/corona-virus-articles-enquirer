These efforts were unsuccessful, as were attempts to find an infective agent.3 However, various epidemiological features have come to light. The disease is found only in adjacent areas of three Balkan countries, Yugoslavia, Bulgaria, and Rumania. It is estimated that there are now 20 000 cases in these three countries. 4 The disease is endemic in certain villages.6 * On leave from Vojno medicinska Akademija, Belgrade, Yugoslavia.",

Some chronic diseases of the nervous system have been shown to be caused by viruses, and are classed as slow (persistent) virus diseases.23 Subacute sclerosing panencephalitis, which is caused by measles, bears close comparison with E.N.24 Both conditions are characterised by an insidious onset and a long latent period, measured in decades rather than years.

The most striking features are the maturation of the virus by budding into cytoplasmic vesicles, the absence of budding from the cell surface, and the capacity of the virus for fusing cells.32 The epidemiological studies also strongly support the concept of an infective aetiology in E.N. The findings in favour are its endemic focal character,6 the familial incidence, 1 6 and the fact that the patients are predominantly peasants living in close association with animalss 6 \" and that immigrants into the endemic areas contract the disease as well as emigrants from the foci, after a latent period of some years.7 8 One outstanding and interesting finding is that in one village in which E.N. was endemic the population of 2400 was 50% Muslim and 50% Christian, only 1 out of 54 cases of E.N. was Muslim.10 Muslims avoid pigs, and there is reason to believe that they are strict in their observance of this prohibiton.

The cell-to-cell spread of the virus could be by cell fusion, which can occur even in the presence of a high titre of antibody. The persistence of the infection would be favoured by the fact that coronaviruses are known not to produce specific changes in the cytoplasmic membrane, so that the T lymphocytes are not attracted to the infected cells, even though they may be sensitised to the virus.
