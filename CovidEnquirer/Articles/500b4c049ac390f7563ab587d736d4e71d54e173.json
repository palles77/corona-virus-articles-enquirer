Plasmodium falciparum is the most virulent human malaria parasite, and is responsible for most of the malariarelated deaths [2, 3] . Since the discovery of the natural product quinine, many compounds with a quinoline scaffold have displayed good antimalarial activity, leading to the development of effective antimalarial agents, including chloroquine, amodiaquine, piperaquine and mefloquine [4e6] . Chloroquine has been extensively utilized for decades because of its efficacy, safety and low cost. However, the widespread resistance of P. falciparum to chloroquine [2, 7] has hampered efforts to combat malaria and led to the development of the natural endoperoxide artemisinin and its semisynthetic derivatives (artemether, artesunate, and dihydroartemisinin) as potent and fast acting antimalarials [8] . However, the worldwide deployment of artemisinin based combination therapy is limited by relatively high cost of treatment, safety in pregnancy and [9, 10] early signs of resistance to artemisinin derivatives in southeast Asia [11] .",

It is an effective SARS coronavirus 3CL protease inhibitor [32] and is well-tolerated in human subjects [33, 34] . Isatin has major importance in organic synthesis due to a highly reactive C-3 carbonyl group which allows easy transformation into 2-oxoindole compounds upon nucleophilic addition or spiroannulation [35] . 2-oxoindole derivatives such as SU-5416 (semaxanib) and SU-11248 (Sunitinib), a 5-fluoro-3-substituted-2oxoindole, were reported to have tyrosine kinase inhibitory and anti-angiogenic properties [36, 37] .

The observed activity profiles among these conjugates were found to depend on the substituent at the C-5 position of isatin and the length of the alkyl chain. Building on our interest in molecular hybridization to develop new antimalarials [43], we report herein the synthesis and biological evaluation of hybrids containing a 4-aminoquinoline tethered to isatin derivatives through an b-amino alcohol functionality. The rationale behind the introduction of a b-amino alcohol linker is its presence in a number of potent antimalarials, as exemplified by mefloquine [44] . The length of the alkyl chain at the C-4 position of the quinoline ring was varied because of its established impact on antimalarial efficacy [45e48].",

The antimalarial activities depended upon the nature of the substituent at the C-5 position of the isatin ring and upon the alkyl chain length. Activities decreased as the chain length was increased, from ethyl to propyl linker, except in the case of 11b and 11f, which had essentially the same activity. A further increase in chain length via introducing butyl and hexyl linkers did not alter the observed antimalarial efficacy. The nature of the substituent at the C-5 position of the isatin ring also seems to play a crucial role in influencing antimalarial activity. The presence of an inductively electron withdrawing chlorosubstituent at C-5 improved activity irrespective of the chain length, with effects more pronounced with shorter (n \u00bc 2,3) alkyl chain lengths. The replacement of the chloro substituent with an H, -CH 3 or F group decreased activity, although few of these hybrids showed activity comparable with that of chloroquine, while compound 11a (R \u00bc H) showed better activity than chloroquine. The replacement of the alkyl chain with a piperazine ring resulted in a complete loss of activity, as evident with compounds 12bed. Compounds 11b and 11f, with an optimum combination of shorter alkyl chain lengths (n \u00bc 2 and 3) and the presence of a chloro-substituent at the C-5 position of th isatin ring, were the most potent of the tested compounds, exhibiting IC 50 of 11.8 and 13.5 nM, respectively. The most potent of the tested compounds were then evaluated for their cytotoxic profiles against HCT116 (colon cancer cell line) cells at 0.2, 2.0 and 20 mM ( Table 2) .
