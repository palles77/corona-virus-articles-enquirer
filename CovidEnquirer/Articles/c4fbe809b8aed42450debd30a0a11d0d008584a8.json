However, upon cultivation in vitro, astrocytes begin to express class I molecules, increasing with time after plating. This spontaneous expression was examined in the present study to characterize inducible expression on astrocytes among various strains of mice. Inducible expression, either as a consequence of cultivation or standard y-interferon treatment, differed markedly among the strains examined. Analysis of congenic strains on a C57BL/10 (B10) background showed that expression was controlled by genes within the MHC locus. Examination of additional congeneic animals with various recombinations within the MHC showed that high or low expression of MHC molecules correlates with the presence of particular MHC class I genes. In general, H-2 a and H-2 a class I products are expressed much higher on astrocytes than H-2 b and H-2 s products. This difference in expression is not seen on spleen cells indicating tissue specificity. Moreover, levels of expression at the cell surface are reflected by the steady-state level of RNA message within astrocytes of the different strains.",

Class I MHC molecules are particularly important for T cell recognition of virus antigen expressed on the surface of infected cells (Zinkernagel and Doherty, 1979) , which may account for the high levels of constitutive expression in most tissues. The central nervous system (CNS) is exceptional because constitutive expression of class I antigens is very low or absent (Williams et al., 1980; Schnitzer and Schachner, 1981) . Persistent viral infections of the 0165-5728/89/$03.50 \u00a9 1989 Elsevier Science Publishers B.V.

The relationship between the unique control of class I antigens found in brain and the ability of viruses to persist and induce neurological disease is presently unclear. In some instances, genetic susceptibility to virus infections in brain maps to particular murine class I MHC genes (Rodriguez et al., 1986; Clatch et al., 1987) .",

Induction of additional molecules could be achieved by adding recombinant murine -/-interferon (IFN-~,) (Wong et al., 1984) to the cultures. Treatment of B10 astrocytes with up to 1000 units/ml IFN-y led to a modest increase of class I antigen expression, but the level was less than that spontaneously induced on B10.A astrocytes. This indicated that the strain-related differences in the level of class I induction by IFN-y parallels spontaneous induction in tissue cultures (experiment 1, within parentheses). No difference among strains in levels of class I expression was detected on spleen cells (Table 1) , which indicated that variable inducibility on astrocytes was tissue specific.",

The involvement of genes to the right of the I-A was first tested, because BALB/c and B10.A mice share the H-2 d haplotype in this region. Astrocytes from B10.A(5R) mice, which have a haplotype identical to B10.A to the right of I-A, consistently expressed high levels of class I molecules (Table 1 , experiment 2). This confirmed that inducibility is, in part, associated with genes to the right of I-A, including L d and D d genes. In addition, an influence of genes to the left of I-E, including K k, was suggested because B10.A(4R) astrocytes expressed higher levels of class I molecules than B10 astrocytes (Table 1 ), but lower than both B10.A and B10.A(5R) astrocytes. Astrocytes from the B10 x B10.A F 1 generation expressed levels intermediate between B10 and B10.A astrocytes, indicating that only the H-2 a class I products were expressed at high levels (Table 1 and vide infra).",

Panels a and b are negative controls in which cells were incubated with secondary anti-rat IgG FITC conjugate without prior incubation with a primary antibody. Cells analyzed in c (SJL/J) and d (BALB/c) were stained with a rat monoclonal antibody to a monomorphic determinant on K, D and L class I antigens designated K204 (Ozato et al., 1985) . Panels e and f show induced class I antigen on brain cells, cultivated for 3 days, consisting primarily of astrocytes. BALB/c astrocytes (f) are induced to higher levels of expression than SJL cells (e). Panels g (SJL) and h (BALB/c) brain cells cultivated for 7 days and consisting of greater than 95% astrocytes are further induced to express class I antigens compared to either freshly isolated cells or after 3 days of culture. BALB/c (h) astrocytes express much higher levels compared to SJL/J astrocytes (g) at 7 days. The mean fluorescence intensity of each sample of 10000 cells is given on the histograms.

Panels a and b are negative controls in which cells were incubated with secondary anti-rat IgG FITC conjugate without prior incubation with a primary antibody. Cells analyzed in c (SJL/J) and d (BALB/c) were stained with a rat monoclonal antibody to a monomorphic determinant on K, D and L class I antigens designated K204 (Ozato et al., 1985). Panels e and f show induced class I antigen on brain cells, cultivated for 3 days, consisting primarily of astrocytes. BALB/c astrocytes (f) are induced to higher levels of expression than SJL cells (e). Panels g (SJL) and h (BALB/c) brain cells cultivated for 7 days and consisting of greater than 95% astrocytes are further induced to express class I antigens compared to either freshly isolated cells or after 3 days of culture.
