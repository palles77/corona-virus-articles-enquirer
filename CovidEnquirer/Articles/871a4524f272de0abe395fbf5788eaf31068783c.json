Following the recommendations of the World Health Organization (WHO), many countries have made recommendations on non-pharmacological measures, especially during the beginning of the pandemic, such as improving hand and respiratory hygiene, the use of surgical facemasks, barrier nursing and quarantine of contacts, social distancing measures and travel restrictions (Bell and World Health Organization Writing Group, 2006a; Ferguson et al., 2006; Nicoll, 2006) . Some authors (Bootsma and Ferguson, 2007; Hatchett et al., 2007; Longini et al., 2005) also report that these measures prolong the epidemic period and reduce the attack rate at the peak of the epidemic wave, thus reducing the burden of care and providing significant benefits during a period of increased demand for health services.",

This suggests that mass information and education of the community can protect against influenza, as suggested by other studies carried out in schools (Stebbins et al., 2010 (Stebbins et al., , 2011 and urban households (Larson et al., 2010) . These studies suggest, but not conclusively, that information results in a reduction both in school absence and cases of influenza. Our results support policies of providing information on influenza and the currently recommended respiratory and hand hygiene measures for seasonal and pandemic influenza. The multivariate analysis found no protective effect of using alcohol-based hand sanitizers. It is known that these products are effective in inactivating a wide range of viruses, including the influenza virus (Kampf and Kramer, 2004; Sattar et al., 2002) . The protective effect of alcohol-based hand sanitizers is only observed when the hands are not visibly dirty and, therefore, they are recommended for use by health workers only when this is the case (Siegel and Centers for Disease Control (US), 2007; Widmer et al., 2007) . In lay people with insufficient instruction in this respect, such as the participants in this study, the measure may not always have been used correctly.",

Other case-control studies have shown the effectiveness of handwashing in preventing the transmission of SARS.

Another case-control study in Beijing (Wu et al., 2004) found that handwashing after returning home had a protective effect (OR = 0.3). More recently, a meta-analysis of 6 casecontrol studies (Jefferson et al., 2008) , found that handwashing > 10 times daily was remarkably effective in preventing SARS (OR = 0.45, CI 0.36-0.57).",

A clinical trial (Cowling et al., 2009 ) that evaluated the effectiveness of measures to reduce home transmission of the influenza A and B viruses found that hand hygiene and wearing facemasks were effective but only when applied in the 36 hours after the onset of symptoms in the index case: the study could not analyse the effect of each intervention separately. A clinical trial (MacIntyre et al., 2009 ) that assessed the effectiveness of wearing facemasks in reducing the transmission of ILI in home contacts found no effect. The study found an adherence rate of b 50%, and suggested that facemasks are not useful in reducing seasonal influenza infections in the community due to their low acceptance, although they could be effective in those who wore them. In contrast, information on influenza prevention, improving general hygiene, including hand hygiene, and avoiding touching mucosal surfaces with the hands are well-accepted socially (MacIntyre, et al., 2009; Stebbins et al., 2009) .",

However, the questionnaire was constructed with closed questions, the interviewers were trained and the questions related to a period of seven days before the onset of symptoms of patients hospitalized for influenza. Due to the rapid decline of the pandemic wave, most interviews were conducted retrospectively and the answers may have been affected by selective recall, although if this did not occur differentially, it should not have affected the results. Another possible limitation was that while only confirmed influenza infections were included in the case definition, some controls could have been misclassified due to lack of testing, false negative tests or the exclusion of other influenza virus strains. However, the exclusion criteria for controls were to have symptoms of either influenza-like illness or respiratory infection at hospital admission and hospital admission due to influenza later than April 2009. Therefore, there was probably no misclassification.",
