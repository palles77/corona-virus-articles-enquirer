MicroRNAs (miRNAs) are important intracellular regulators and play a pivotal role in viral infections. In previous studies, we have revealed that IBV infection caused a significant downregulation of gga-miR-30d expression in chicken kidneys. In present study, we investigated the role of gga-miR-30d in the process of IBV infection of HD11 cell line in vitro. By transfecting the mimics and inhibitor of gga-miR-30d, it was found that overexpressed gga-miR-30d inhibited IBV replication. Contrarily, low-expressed gga-miR-30d promoted IBV replication. In addition, dual-luciferase reporter assays revealed that ubiquitin-specific protease 47 (USP47), a deubiquitinase-encoding gene, was a target for gga-miR-30d. This is the first study demonstrating that miRNAs regulate IBV replication by regulating the deubiquitinating enzyme (DUBs).",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB), caused by infectious bronchitis coronavirus (IBV), is a highly contagious viral disease of the chicken [1] . Since IB was first described by Schalk and Hawn in USA in 1931 [2] , it has developed into one of the foremost causes of economic loss in the poultry industry, affecting the performance of both meat-type and egglaying chickens. IBV is an enveloped, non-segmented, single-stranded, positive-sense RNA virus, classified taxonomically as a member of genus Gammacoronavirus, family Coronaviridae [3] . Initially, this pathogen replicated primarily in the respiratory tract, causing a highly contagious respiratory disease characterized by nasal discharge, snicking, rales, and tracheal ciliostasis in chickens, but later reports demonstrated that it also replicated in many other epithelial surfaces, including enteric surfaces, oviducts, and kidneys [4] . Although vaccination is the most reliable approach to control IBV, the high mutation rate and recombination events differentiate IBV into numerous genotypes and serotypes, causing poor cross-protection of vaccines [5] . Therefore, it is urgent to apply new technologies and methods to control IBV.",

MiRNAs usually affect gene expression by directing repressive protein complexes to the untranslated region (UTR) of target messenger RNA (mRNA) transcripts in a sequence-specific manner. Up to now, Out of over 24,000 miRNAs have been identified, including 734 mature miRNAs from Gallus gallus [6, 7] and even 295 mature miRNAs encoded by viruses [Mirbase] . These huge amounts of miRNAs are implicated in almost every cellular process, including cell proliferation, differentiation, apoptosis and host-pathogen interactions [8] . Especially, in viral infections, miRNAs have been confirmed play crucial regulatory roles. For instance, miRNA-4776 was related to the survival of influenza virus [9] . MiR-3470b promoted bovine ephemeral fever virus (BEFV) replication in baby hamster Syrian kidney cells [10] and bta-miR-2361 inhibited bovine herpes virus 1 (BHV1) replication by directly targeting EGR1 gene [11] . IBV, as a virus that affects the global poultry industry, has been studied from various angles. However, few studies have reported about the miRNAs alterations in the post infection of IBV in host cell lines, such as HD11 cell line.",

In the same situation, the expression level of gga-miR-30d in mock infected cells serve as controls. As shown in Fig. 2A , the expression level of gga-miR-30d began to decrease after 12 h of viral infection. When infected for 24 h, the expression level of gga-miR-30d down-regulated about two fold compared with the control. Little change was observed at 0-12 h after infection. Coincidentally, IBV started to replicate a lot at about 12 h after infection (Fig. 1B) , and the expression level of gga-miR-30d in the cells began to down-regulate in the same time period.

Those cells are derived from mammals, which impose certain restrictions on IBV as an avian virus. HD11, a chicken cell line, have recently been found to be susceptible to IBV Beaudette strain [21] . In addition, HD11 is a chicken macrophage-like cell line. There is lack of lymph nodes and resident macrophages in avian respiratory tract, thus requiring an infux of phagocytic cells to initiate the defense against infectious agents [22] . Therefore macrophages play an important role in avian innate immunity. Studying the interaction between IBV and avian macrophage HD11 will help to better understand avian innate immunity.",

Not surprisingly, viruses inevitably coopt DUBs to accomplish their own life cycle, from entry into host cells to the release of progeny viral particles [25] . Hijacking of the ubiquitin-deubiquitinase system by viruses continues to emerge as a central theme around the viral life cycle. USP47, a member of the DUBs family, was recently identified as a deubiquitylating enzyme that regulates base excision repair by controlling steady-state levels of DNA polymerase \u03b2 [26] . Besides, USP47 also plays an important role in innate immunity. It has been reported that P22077, a selective ubiquitin-specific protease 7/47 (USP7/ USP47) inhibitor, inhibited the proliferation of HIV virus by inhibiting the function of USP47 [27] .",

In our experiment, a similar phenomenon has been observed. Gga-miR-30d is a key factor regulating the expression of USP47 by binding to its 3 \u2032-UTR. Overexpressed gga-miR-30d down-regulated the expression of USP47, resulted in inhibiting the replication of IBV. Down-regulation of gga-miR-30d increased the activity of USP47 and promoted the replication of IBV. However, how does USP47 regulate IBV replication remains to be further explored. In a word, it may be a common strategy for virus infection to use the UDBs to resist the immune response of host and enhance its replication. In addition to the DUBs encoded by the cells, many viruses also can encode DUBs or deubiquitinating-like proteins to promote their own replication. Coronavirus, for instance MHV-A59, SARS-CoV, HCoV-NL63 [29] [30] [31] , encode the protein with deubiquitinating activity to promote viral infection. Similarly, as one of Coronavirus, it was reported that IBV-encoded PLP-TM functions as a DUB enzyme, which significant reduced the levels of ubiquitin (Ub)-, K48-, and K63-conjugated proteins in the early stage of viral infection [32] . By degrading polyubiquitin chains associated with ubiquitin proteins, IBV PLP-TM may prevent the activation of host antiviral signaling pathways to escapes host antiviral immune system. In short, both the cell-encoded DUBs and virus-encoded DUBs play a key regulatory role in viral infection. These results further highlight the importance of the ubiquitin-deubiquitinase system in virus-cell interactions and cellular innate immunity.",
