Design: The first part is an observational cohort study with baseline, follow-up, and outcome data being identified from a clinical electronic registry. The second part examines changes in suicide rates from official mortality statistics. Setting: A government-funded suicide intervention program serving catchment population (852,796 people aged 65 years and older) in Hong Kong, China. Participants: Suicide attempters (aged 65 years and older) presenting to old-age psychiatric service in the pre-and postintervention phases. Measurements: 1) Two-year rates of completed suicide and suicide reattempt and 2) changes in population suicide rates in the pre-and postintervention periods. Results: The 2-year completed suicide rate was 7.58% in the preintervention group (N = 66) and 1.99% in the ESPP group (N = 351) \u03c7 2 = 6.192; p value: 0.028; df = 1). Reattempt rates were not different. At a population level, suicide rate dropped significantly only in women aged 85 years and older, relative to the preintervention period. Conclusions: The ESPP was associated with a reduced rate of completed suicide in old-age suicide attempters and might have contributed to a fall of suicide rate in women aged 85 years and older.

Psychiatric illness is a major contributing factor and more than 90% of suicides have a Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fourth Edition, Axis I psychiatric illness. 1, 2 Although suicide prevention strategies usually adopt a multifaceted or multilayered approach with particular attention to mental health, systematic review of suicide prevention strategies fails to demonstrate consistently the efficacy of suicide prevention programs because of heterogeneity in study methodology and populations. 3 Among different intervention strategies used, collaborative care approaches and physician education in depression recognition and treatment have been found to be effective in lowering suicide rates across diverse sociocultural settings. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] Older adults, being the fastest growing population segment worldwide, are at greater risk for suicide than any other age groups. 11, 12 The United Nations recently estimated that the population older than 60 years will reach 1 billion, with 70% residing in developing countries, by 2020. 13 Suicide attempts in later life are often of greater determination and lethality. 14, 15 Those who attempt and complete suicide in later life are driven by the same spectrum of risk factors such as depression, ill health, and solitary living arrangements. 16, 17 Aftercare for suicide attempts, ranging from telecare, issuance of an emergency contact card, intensive psychosocial follow-up, and video education plus family therapy, have produced mixed results and often no difference between standard aftercare and intervention groups in the rate of reattempt and reemerging suicidal ideation.

The suicide rate among older adults (aged 65 years and older) in Hong Kong is 2-3 times higher than younger age groups. 25 An \"Elderly suicide prevention program\" (ESPP) was launched in October 2002 to serve all areas in Hong Kong through seven regional services. This program is directly funded and managed by the Hospital Authority, the only government-funded health management organization in Hong Kong. The ESPP adopts a multifaceted model (treatment of depression, gatekeeper training, aftercare for suicide attempters, and care management) operating at two levels. The first tier is predominantly primary care, and the second tier is the old-age psychiatric service at tertiary care level.",

Each client will then be assigned a care manager (psychogeriatric nurse in the second tier) who arranges an urgent psychogeriatric appointment (with or without domestic visit) within 1 week. At the psychogeriatric clinic designated psychogeriatricians provide the assessment and follow-up care as clinically indicated. A care manager offers frequent phone contacts, regular home visits (usually biweekly or triweekly), and ad hoc home visits (in response to crisis) to monitor the client's mental and social situations, promote compliance with treatment, and provide psychoeducation in the first 6 months. The care manager liaises with other caregivers (both professional and nonprofessional) by phone contacts. ESPP clients are also given the emergency contacts of their care managers. A multidisciplinary team (consists of psychogeriatricians, care managers, and medical social workers \u00b1 occupational therapists) at tertiary care level holds regular case conferences to review the care plan and clinical progress.",

There are two reasons for limiting the follow-up period to 2 years. First, the last subject in the intervention group was enrolled by the end of May 2007, and the data analysis of this study was performed at the end of May 2009. Hence, 2-year follow-up permits maximal inclusion of subjects in the intervention arm. The second reason being that completed suicides mostly likely occur in the first 1-2 years after an index attempt among older adults in Hong Kong, based on a 4.5-year naturalistic follow-up study on late-life suicide attempters presented to a district level hospital service in Hong Kong from 1990 to 1994. 26 Subjects and Intervention. The intervention group was selected from 2,290 older adults (aged 65 years and older) enrolled in the ESPP from October 2002 to May 2007. As an early intervention program, the ESPP cohort includes a range of at-risk older adults without making an index suicide attempt at intake. ESPP clients without index suicide attempt were thus not included in our data analysis as our comparison subjects from the preintervention phase were all suicide attempters. From this cohort, there were 351 suicide attempters included as the intervention group. The intervention group received intensive care management as detailed in the introductory section. The intensive care management phase lasts for 6 months, but the aftercare component by psychogeriatrician is continued as clinically indicated.",

The NTECs regional mental health service serves a catchment area that hosts about one-fifth of the total population. In the preintervention period, all suicide attempters aged 65 years and older seeking help at publicly funded hospitals at NTEC were referred to psychogeriatric consultation-liaison services. With exception to NTEC, there was no database that systematically archived baseline clinical information of late-life suicide attempters presenting to other regional services in the preintervention phase. Suicide attempters presenting to other regional services during the preintervention phase were thus not included. Subjects in the preintervention group received standard psychogeriatric care (both outpatient and inpatient) after an index suicide attempt. In the preintervention phase, the standard psychogeriatric service was well equipped with multidisciplinary support from psychiatric inpatient/daycare facilities.

The two groups were not significantly different on other baseline variables. As for the process indicators, older adults in the preintervention group had a higher frequency of service dropout during the 2-year follow-up period. Two-year suicide rate was 7.58% (number of suicide deaths = 5) in the preintervention group and 1.99% (number of suicide deaths = 7) in the ESPP cohort (\u03c7 2 = 6.192; p value = 0.028, df = 1).

Significantly higher rates of completed suicide were observed in the preintervention group among subjects with an apparent low-risk profile, i.e., GDS below cutoff score at intake or those with history of treatment compliance. For the relatively high-risk group who required hospitalization for index attempt, the 2-year rate of completed suicide was significantly higher in the preintervention group. Trend toward higher suicide rates in the preintervention group was seen in subjects selected by male gender. On the other hand, the subgroup analyses showed no significant differences in the frequency of repeat suicide attempts between the two groups. Table 3 presents six Poisson regression models testing the independent effects of intervention group and the respective baseline variables on completed suicide. For each model, an interaction term (groupby-baseline variable) was fitted to test whether it made significant contribution to the outcome prediction. The respective interaction terms were removed from the final models because the relative risks failed to reach significance level. In the final models, only \"group\" remained as significant outcome predictor. All Poisson regression models demonstrated a significant reduction in relative risk for completed suicide in the ESPP group relative to the preintervention group.",

In a publicly funded suicide intervention program that is intended for all in the city, it is impossible to have a contemporary control group receiving \"care as usual.\" Under the \"one-country, two-systems\" administrative schema in China, socially compatible cities for comparison are virtually nonexistent. In this study, more often older people in the preintervention cohort were diagnosed to have ICD-10 depressive disorder, living alone, and had history of previous suicide attempt, all well-known risk factors for suicide. Also, all pre-intervention subjects were referred from the inpatient consultation-liaison service, whereas some subjects in the intervention groups were referred from community gatekeepers. These uncontrolled baseline factors might account partly for the difference in the 2-year suicide rates. However, we found the \"groupby-baseline variable\" interactions were insignificant in Poisson regression models, whereas only intervention group remained significant predictor for completed suicide. The degrees of underreporting of suicide reattempt in the 2-year follow-up period for both groups were also uncertain, because it remained inevitable in both pre-and postintervention phases that suicide attempts not requiring any clinical attention at the publicly funded healthcare system were more likely to be missed. On the other hand, underreporting of completed suicide was less likely as the \"caseness\" was ascertained by standard judicial procedure.",

We have reported that excess elderly suicides in April 2003 coincided with the peak of incident SARS cases. 34 Hence, the temporary suspension of healthcare services and the concurrent upsurge in elderly suicide rates lend support to the reversibility of the effect of the standard old-age psychiatric services. It was speculated that the aftermath effects of SARS such as mass pessimism and fear of the epidemic returning were carried through 2004, accounting for the relatively high suicide rates in older adults that year. 35 Our Poisson regression analysis showed that a steady trough level of suicide rates among old-old women (aged 85 years and older) was not reached until 2002. This observation suggests that ESPP (in place since 2002) may offer added benefit to the oldold adults who would not seek help from the standard psychogeriatric service. We speculate that the gatekeeper training component of the ESPP has resulted in better recognition of depressive illness and enhanced access of the service to the at-risk old-old women. Our study showed that 20% of ESPP clients were aged 85 years and older, compared with 10% of the preintervention cohort.",

Future service provision should incorporate effective means to reach the high-risk older men. These measures might include strengthening the gate-keeping mechanisms in different sectors (non-goverment organizations [NGOs], social welfare sector, and primary care).
