The muscular layers grind food into smaller particles and move it forward into the small intestine through the pyloric sphincter. Of equal importance are the glandular portions of the stomach, which include parietal cells (for secretion of hydrochloric acid), chief cells (for secretion of pepsinogen), and mucus-producing cells (which also secrete bicarbonate). Normally, the gastric mucosal barrier keeps hydrochloric acid and digestive enzymes within the lumen and prevents loss of plasma constituents into the stomach. 2 Once the food particles are ground into small enough components, they pass through the pyloric sphincter into the beginning of the small intestine, known as the duodenum.",

            "text": "The small intestine of cats and dogs functions in digestion and absorption of food and its nutrients and is divided arbitrarily into the duodenum, jejunum, and ileum. 3 The mucosa of the small intestine is involved in secretory and absorptive functions and contains a single layer of epithelial cells called enterocytes. The mucosa along the length of the small intestine is formed into villi, which are fingerlike projections into the intestinal lumen that enlarge the surface of the small intestine. Microvilli then form the \"brush border\" to further increase the surface area available for digestion and absorption of nutrients. Enzymes within the brush border aid in digestion of larger food molecules into smaller, more readily absorbable particles. Absorption may occur via specific transport mechanisms or by pinocytosis. The epithelial cells also are involved with absorption and secretion of electrolytes and water. 3 Enterocytes are connected to each other by tight junctions, limiting absorption between cells, as well as preventing backflow of nutrients from the interstitium into the intestinal lumen. The enterocytes start at the crypt (base of the villus) and migrate toward the intestinal lumen where they are shed, with a lifespan of approximately 2 to 5 days. A healthy, intact mucosal lining is important for the integrity of the intestine. Any type of inflammation that disrupts this layer can lead to significant intestinal disease. 4 The gastrointestinal (GI) tract absorbs approximately 99% of the fluid presented to it; therefore any damage can cause significant alterations in acid-base and fluid balances. 5,5a",

Those most at risk are the young or immunocompromised, those that have concurrent infections, or those that have received prior antibiotic or glucocorticoid therapy. As is the case with many bacterial organisms, Salmonella can be found in a population of healthy, nonclinical patients, so its documentation in the GI tract should be correlated with clinical signs. 13 In addition to the aforementioned more commonly diagnosed bacterial infections, evidence is beginning to suggest that histiocytic ulcerative colitis in Boxer dogs may be due to invasive E. coli organisms within the colonic mucosa of affected dogs. 14,15 Fluoroquinolones have become the standard treatment for these patients, with the use of fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) to confirm the presence of these organisms. 14, 15 Culture and susceptibility testing of colonic tissue can be used to isolate and guide therapy because antimicrobial resistance has become of increasing concern. 14,15",

However, the proteins lost into the intestinal tract can include large proteins such as albumin and antithrombin, both of which have important roles in homeostasis. Albumin, with a molecular weight of 69,000 daltons, contributes significantly to oncotic pressure. Loss of albumin through the GI tract can lead to a reduced colloid osmotic pressure and subsequent loss of fluid from the intravascular space. Although this is typically a gradual process, it can cause significant changes in the compartmentalization of fluids in some patients. If third spacing has occurred, it may be necessary to use colloidal fluids such as hydroxyethyl starch or human albumin, in addition to crystalloids, to prevent further intravascular fluid losses (see Chapter 58). 22 Albumin also has additional beneficial effects, such as its antioxidant and antiinflammatory properties. 23 Antithrombin plays a critical role in the coagulation and fibrinolytic cascade by inactivating thrombin and other clotting factors. Even a small reduction in antithrombin levels can cause a large propensity toward thrombosis and thromboembolism. This becomes important in patients with PLE that lose large amounts of protein and are predisposed to developing thromboemboli in various parts of the body, including the pulmonary vessels, portal vein, or coronary or cerebral vessels. Therapy for PLE often involves glucocorticoids, which also increase the risk of thromboembolic disease. Therefore anticoagulant or antiplatelet therapy, or both, may be warranted in these cases.",

Fecal samples should be evaluated for parasitic diseases and bacterial infections in most animals with clinical signs of acute gastroenteritis. A culture and Gram stain evaluation also should be performed. Feces should be tested at least three times before a negative result is confirmed. Testing for clostridial enterotoxins may include use of a C. perfringens enterotoxin enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA), or an ELISA that detects C. difficile toxins A and B. Recent developments with real PCR testing have provided another diagnostic method for detection of many organisms that are seen commonly in small animals. A Giardia antigen test also exists.

Typically results of these tests are normal and do not aid in determining an underlying cause for the gastroenteritis. However, in certain circumstances such as HGE (in which the PCV is elevated with a normal to decreased total protein concentration), PLE (which may cause a decrease in total protein, globulin, albumin, and cholesterol levels), these tests can aid in making a diagnosis. Electrolytes should be checked regularly to confirm adequate fluid management. is described as having the appearance of raspberry jam. 7 Thorough investigation to rule out other causes of hemorrhagic diarrhea such as parvovirus, bacterial infections, or GI parasites should be undertaken before arriving at a diagnosis of HGE. Along with hemoconcentration, the total protein concentration typically increases little or not at all (it may actually decrease). The elevated PCV occurs because of hemoconcentration and/or splenic contraction, whereas GI loss of serum proteins or redistribution of body water into the vascular space explains the lack of rise in total protein levels. 7 Aggressive therapy is warranted in these animals because rapid decompensation may occur. Adequate replacement of fluid volume is essential; more specific fluid management strategies can be found in Chapters 59 and 60. General goals are to replace quickly the fluid deficits from the acute diarrhea and vomiting then adjust fluid rates to maintain proper hydration. The GI tract is a \"shock organ\" in the dog, and lack of proper perfusion to the GI tract can lead to worsening GI inflammation, bacterial translocation, sepsis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation (see Chapter 91). 18, 19 Because serum proteins are lost through the intestinal tract, close attention should be paid to the patient's colloid osmotic pressure and colloidal support given when necessary. Fluid therapy is the mainstay of treatment for patients with HGE. Antiemetic and gastric protectant drugs should be used as indicated. Although antimicrobials may be warranted in patients with suspected bacterial translocation, caution is advised because inappropriate use of these drugs may promote antimicrobial resistance or other unwanted side effects. In some dogs with HGE but no signs of sepsis, antimicrobial therapy may not be indicated. 20 With rapid and appropriate therapy, the prognosis for full recovery from HGE is excellent.",

Many drugs are associated with vomiting and diarrhea (antimicrobials, antineoplastics, anthelminthics), and garbage ingestion can lead to exposure of the intestinal tract to preformed bacterial toxins. Most commonly, dietary indiscretion leads to acute onset of vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia. The patient's history is useful because the owner may be aware of exposure to a specific toxicant or garbage.

When food is offered, a wet, easily digestible diet is recommended. Addition of GI protectants (see Chapter 161) or antiemetics (see Chapter 162), or both, may hasten recovery of the enterocyte damage, give the GI tract time to heal, and decrease nausea. In animals with severe GI damage, in which bacterial translocation is a concern (especially in puppies with parvoviral enteritis), antimicrobials may be indicated and should aim at treating the common organisms expected in the intestinal tract. This usually consists of drugs with good gram-negative and anaerobic coverage. More recently, use of probiotics has been evaluated in veterinary medicine for treatment of acute and chronic GI disease. Two recent prospective studies have shown that the use of probiotics in acute gastroenteritis may hasten recovery and reduce the severity of diarrhea in affected patients. Although specific mechanisms for their benefit still are poorly understood, probiotics may compete with pathogenic organisms for nutrition, they may produce antimicrobial substances, and they may stimulate the immune system. 29, 30 ",

            "text": "Prognosis for animals with mild to moderate gastroenteritis is typically excellent. However, early diagnosis and timely therapy are important to prevent multiple organ involvement and maximize outcome.Abdominal radiographs may be unrewarding or may show signs of fluid-filled bowel loops. Radiographs are indicated if a GI obstruction (i.e., foreign body, neoplasia) is suspected. Abdominal ultrasonography is an excellent tool to evaluate all abdominal organs, including the thickness and layering of the stomach and small intestine. These findings may be insensitive and nonspecific, however, and always should be used in conjunction with other diagnostic tests.If PLE is suspected and biopsies of the stomach and intestine are required, there are two main ways of achieving this. Endoscopy is a noninvasive method for visualizing the esophageal, gastric, and duodenal mucosa, as well as for obtaining small (1.8-to 2.4-mm) biopsy samples. Disadvantages of this method are that the samples are small and biopsies cannot be obtained distal to the duodenum. Ileal samples can be obtained if colonoscopy is performed, but this requires patient preparation (i.e., administration of cleansing enemas), which can cause decompensation in unstable animals resulting from fluid and electrolyte shifts. Another method for obtaining samples is via exploratory laparotomy. This is an excellent method for acquiring full-thickness biopsy samples of multiple areas of the GI tract (and other organs if they are found to be abnormal). The disadvantages are that it is much more invasive, and poor wound healing may be a concern in patients with reduced albumin levels. This has been reported in human surgical patients as well as canine surgical patients. [24] [25] [26] In addition, diseased gastric and intestinal walls may heal poorly. Laparoscopy is another technique that can be used to obtain excellent visualization of the abdominal cavity along with full-thickness biopsies of the GI tract (and other organs as needed). Laparoscopy is less invasive than exploratory laparotomy and may be associated with less morbidity because of smaller incisions; however, healing of gastric and intestinal biopsy sites would remain a concern in patients with low albumin levels or diseased walls.The most common clinical signs of gastroenteritis are vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia. These are common to a variety of diseases; therefore gastroenteritis is often a diagnosis of exclusion. Differential diagnosis may include systemic diseases such as kidney disease, liver disease, hypoadrenocorticism, complicated diabetes mellitus (diabetic ketoacidosis), vestibular disease or other neurologic abnormalities, pancreatitis, pyometra, prostatitis, and peritonitis. Additional primary GI diseases to consider include intussusception, foreign body or mass obstruction, infiltrative disease (neoplasia, infectious), or ischemia. It is important to rule out these other disorders, as indicated, before making a diagnosis of gastroenteritis.",

            "text": "Most cases of gastroenteritis respond well to supportive care. Aggressiveness of treatment depends on the severity of clinical signs and the underlying cause. Because the most common clinical signs of gastroenteritis, regardless of underlying cause, are vomiting, diarrhea, and anorexia, dehydration is a common occurrence, and initial therapy should be aimed at addressing the patient's hydration status and perfusion parameters (see Chapters 57, 59, and 60).Other treatments can be divided into specific or symptomatic therapies. Specific drugs can be used to treat some of the underlying causes of disease. For the most part, drugs used to eradicate many of the infectious causes for gastroenteritis are available. GI parasites may be treated with fenbendazole or other antihelminthic drugs. Campylobacter spp. have responded well to such drugs as erythromycin, enrofloxacin, and cefoxitin, 27 and Clostridium spp. may respond to metronidazole or ampicillin. 28 The choice of drug depends on many factors, including patient age and ability to take oral medications. Few antiviral drugs are effective in veterinary medicine; therefore diseases such as parvoviral enteritis are treated supportively. As stated",
