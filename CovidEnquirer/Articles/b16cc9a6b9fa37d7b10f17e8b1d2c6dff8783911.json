However, apoptosis was not completely prevented by caspases inhibitors, suggesting that there may be a caspase-independent pathway involved in TGEV-induced cell apoptosis. In this study, we investigated the regulation of apoptosis-inducing factor (AIF) on TGEV-induced apoptotic pathway. Results indicated that AIF translocated from the mitochondria to nucleus during TGEV infection, and the AIF inhibitor, N-phenylmaleimide (NP), significantly attenuated the apoptosis. In addition, the translocation of AIF was inhibited by Veliparib (ABT-888), an inhibitor of poly (ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP). And the reactive oxygen species (ROS) scavenger, pyrrolidinedithiocarbamic (PDTC), redistributed AIF in the mitochondria and nucleus in TGEV-infected cells. Moreover, the protein levels in nucleus and the mRNA levels of AIF were inhibited in the presence of the p53 inhibitor, pifithrin-\u03b1 (PFT-\u03b1) or in TGEV-infected p53\u2212/\u2212cells. Furthermore, TGEV-induced apoptosis was blocked by combination of three or more inhibitors, such as pan caspase inhibitor Z-VAD-FMK, NP, ABT-888, PDTC, PFT-\u03b1, to treat PK-15 cells. Taken together, these results suggest that the p53-and ROS-mediated AIF pathway and caspasedependent pathway were involved in TGEV-induced apoptosis.",

Recently, in contrast to its cytoprotective role in the mitochondria, AIF was found to translocate from the mitochondria to the cytosol, and subsequently to the nucleus, serving as a powerful proapoptotic trigger [3, 13] . Upon induction of various apoptotic stimuli, AIF partly bound to DNA, stimulated DNase activity and triggered condensation and large-scale fragmentation of chromatin, to induce apoptosis [25, 27, 30] . However, the proapoptotic effects were not prevented by caspase inhibitors, suggesting that AIF mediated a caspase-independent manner to trigger nuclear apoptosis [5, 16, 25] . Numerous lines of research have showed that a caspase-independent manner is involved in various stimuli-induced apoptotic programs [5, 6] , including viruses [10, 20] .",

After infecting piglets, TGEV then replicates in enterocytes, subsequently results in lethal watery diarrhea and dehydration [7] . When infects several cell lines in vitro, TGEV could induce morphological and biochemical changes in these cells [7, 9] , and these findings were consistent with in vivo pathologic changes. We previously proved that TGEV infection induced apoptosis by caspase signaling [7] . p53 and reactive oxygen species (ROS) play pivotal roles in TGEV-induced cell apoptosis [8, 12] . However, TGEV-induced apoptosis is not completely inhibited by caspases inhibitors, suggesting that a caspase-independent pathway may be involved in TGEV-induced cell apoptosis. Thus, the study presented here stemmed from our previous findings and investigated the role of AIF in TGEV-induced apoptosis. Our results demonstrated that ROS and p53 levels mediated AIF released to the nucleus from the mitochondria during TGEV infection, thereby leading to apoptosis. doi: 10.1292/jvms.18-0104",

Western blot assay was used to measure the AIF protein levels in the nucleus. As shown in Fig. 2A , ABT-888 markedly inhibited the total protein and cleaved protein levels of PARP-1, compared with TGEV infection alone, however the total protein levels of PARP-1 were no significant difference in ABT-888-and TGEV-co-treated PK-15 cells, compared with ABT-888 treatment alone. Moreover, ABT-888 significantly inhibited the activation of PARP-1 and the AIF translocation was prevented by ABT-888 (Fig. 2B) .

It binds to DNA in the nucleus, and induces chromatin condensation and DNA fragmentation by recruiting downstream nucleases, resulting in apoptosis [11] . Actually, AIF is considered to play a centric role in regulating caspase-independent pathways in cells [4, 6] . Our present study showed that TGEV infection activated AIF, which was released to the nucleus, thereby resulting in apoptosis. Combination the inhibitors of pan caspase and AIF blocked the apoptosis. In agreement with our previous research [7] , we demonstrated that TGEV-induced apoptosis involved a caspase-independent pathway as well as caspase-dependent pathways in infected cells. Similar findings were seen with the rabies virus and the vesicular stomatitis virus [10, 20] .",

However, the total protein levels of PARP-1 were no significant difference in ABT-888 and TGEV co-treated PK-15 cells, compared with ABT-888 treatment alone, but remarkably decreased when compared to that TGEV infection alone. And also the cleaved PARP-1 were not absolutely inhibited in TGEV-infected cells. These results suggest that TGEV might activate PARP-1 to induce AIF translocation, while the cleavage of PARP-1 was partly promoted by caspases.",

We previously demonstrated that TGEV-induced ROS accumulation reduced mitochondrial membrane potential, leading to apoptosis [8] .

In the current study, the p53 inhibitor, PFT-\u03b1, significantly reduced the mRNA levels of AIF and decreased the protein levels in the nucleus, and the similar results were also found in TGEV-infected p53\u2212/\u2212 cells.
