In spite of our recognition of the importance of these disorders, the number of reports on the diseases of this system is still relatively small, and some important, common disorders remain sketchily described, if at all, in the primary scientific literature. Veterinarians presented with a sick camelid often are forced to extrapolate from experiences with other species to determine whether the disorders are gastrointestinal (GI) in origin, to establish lists of differential diagnoses, and to formulate diagnostic and treatment plans.",

Their survival is aided by their ability to extract maximal water and nutrients from feedstuffs, which is a function of the gut. Understanding this ability to tolerate poor conditions helps explain some of the functional and physiologic adaptations that have occurred in the camelid digestive system. It also lays the groundwork for recognizing that the camelid gut is different from that of the ruminant.",

With its tactile qualities and mobility, this upper lip plays some of the role of the tongue in traditional ruminants. The lower lip is less mobile and less sensitive than the upper lip.",

[5] [6] [7] [8] Normal camelid saliva is alkaline (pH = 8.0 to 8.6) with high bicarbonate (100 to 150 milliequivalents per liter [mEq/L]), phosphorus (18 to 34 mEq/L), sodium (148 to 175 mEq/L), and potassium (6.5 to 14.0 mEq/L) concentrations. Salivary chloride concentration is very low (20 to 30 mEq/L). A slight increase in bicarbonate concentration occurs during feeding. Total fasting salivary output is approximately 6 milliliters per kilogram per hour [mL/kg/hr], with each parotid salivary gland secreting about 2 mL/kg/hr. 6, 7 Both parotid and total salivary outputs increase by over 50% during eating and cud chewing. On the basis of this information, camelid saliva Forestomach enzymes are primarily microbial in origin. Bacterial fermentation of plant carbohydrate results in the production of organic volatile fatty acids (VFAs). Under normal fermentative conditions, acetate, propionate, and butyrate are the major VFAs produced, in a ratio of approximately 4 : 1 : 1 before feeding and approximately 7 : 2 : 1 a few hours after feeding. 13 Absolute VFA concentration after feeding in both New World camelids and Old World camelids is approximately 140 millimoles per liter (mmol/L), which is 30% to 40% higher than in ruminants under similar conditions. 13, 14 The production and presence of these VFAs and other organic acids acidify the fluid within the forestomach compartments. Although gastric (forestomach) fluid pH varies with diet and fermentative activity, camelids on a diet consisting predominantly of forage should have a forestomach fluid pH between 6.4 and 6.8; that is, the VFAs exist predominantly in their ionic forms. Carbon dioxide and methane are additional products of fermentation. Further discussion of fermentative function may be found in Chapter 8.",

The first gastric compartment occupies most of the left side of the abdomen. It consists of large cranial and caudal sacs, which are divided ventrally by a prominent transverse pillar and together contain about 83% of gastric volume and about 50% of abdominal volume (Figure . 15 The delineation between the sacs is easily visible or palpable from either outside of or within the compartment. The transverse pillar forks medially into cranial and caudal portions near the cardia. The small, reniform second compartment (6% of gastric volume) rests atop C3 medial to C1, with its lesser curvature oriented toward C1 and its greater curvature protruding toward the right dorsolateral body wall. The first two compartments and their contents account for approximately 10% of the body weight of an adult alpaca and 15% of an adult llama. 7, 16 The canal between C2 and C3 is very narrow and probably represents an important size regulator for particle transport to the lower GI tract. The third compartment (11% of gastric volume and 1.5% to 2.5% of adult body weight) is long and tubiform, with both ends upturned. 7, 16 It extends cranioventrally and then caudally from its attachment to C2, occupying the right cranioventral appears to have similar biochemical features to ruminant saliva, and probably plays an important role in buffering gastric acid. The rate of saliva production in camelids is also similar to that in roughage-fed ruminants. However, the parotid glands of camelids are proportionally similar in mass to those of ruminants adapted to poorly fermentable diets and approximately one third the size of the glands of ruminants adapted to rich diets. 9 This suggests that camelids have limited ability to increase salivary buffering of fermentation in response to higher rates of forestomach acid production.",

Initial mastication by camelids is cursory and consists of only enough chewing to mix the food with saliva to form a bolus for swallowing. To further decrease particle size and increase surface area for microbial digestion, cud is propelled from the first gastric compartment back up the esophagus into the mouth, where it is rechewed and mixed with saliva. This process has been studied extensively in the vicu\u00f1a and probably is similar in other camelids. 10 After regurgitation of a cud, the mandible makes a \"figure-of-8\" arc during chewing. In approximately 15 seconds, 25 to 30 chews occur, after which the cud is swallowed. The cycle may repeat itself many times. In contrast to ruminants, which tend to retain a cud on one side for several chews, camelids appear to move the cud from side-to-side with each chew. 9 Saliva is expelled primarily from the ipsilateral parotid duct each time, potentially minimizing salivary loss and maximizing the contribution of both glands to the digestive process.",

VFA, although a weak acid, usually exists in its ionized form at typical C1 pH. The ionized form crosses the lipid cellular membrane with difficulty, but if it momentarily captures the hydrogen molecule from carbonic acid, it is removed from the system by absorption across the saccular membrane.

The A-cycle begins with a strong contraction of the C2-C3 canal, followed by a rapid contraction of C2 and relaxation of the canal. [24] [25] [26] Following this, both caudal C1 and the canal contract up to eight times. In guanacos, the C1 contractions move from caudoventral to caudodorsal, followed by a cranial sac contraction. 27 In alpacas, the whole caudal sac appears to contract together. 26 A final weak contraction of the canal ends the cycle. The entire sequence takes about 1 to 2 minutes. Clinical interpretation of multiple contraction cycles during that time results from interpretation of the multiple C1 contractions of a single A-cycle as multiple cycles. The A-cycle is responsible for fluid passage into C3 (during the first C2 contraction only), expressing fluid from the fiber mass, and mixing of the contents of C1. Experimental data from one llama revealed that fluid passage into C3 occurs at a rate of approximately 7 mL/kg/hr, with about 0.14 mL/kg passing through the canal with each A-cycle. 28 The order of contraction functions. Saccular cells may be subdivided into two populations: (1) simple columnar epithelial cells, which resemble those of the small intestinal mucosa and have primarily absorptive function, and (2) a second group that resemble tubular gland cells. 7 It is postulated that this second population of cells, especially those nearest to the compartment lumen, secrete a mucus coat that protects the saccular membrane against mechanical trauma, acid injury, and microbial invasion. Evidence of this mucus coat may be found in live camelids. 17 In spite of their designation as \"glandular\" saccules, little evidence exists for substantive secretion beyond this thin mucus coat. Water, electrolytes, and VFAs are absorbed very quickly across the saccular membrane. 7, 19 Absorption of these molecules across this membrane is two to three times faster than across the rumen membrane in sheep and goats and results in a generally drier gastric contents than is commonly found in cattle or sheep. Unlike ruminants, camelids appear to absorb water across the forestomach membrane in direct relation to the amounts of sodium and VFAs absorbed. In contrast to sodium and water, camelids appear to absorb less chloride. The submucosa of each saccule is filled with a complex network of capillaries, which supports the importance of the saccules in nutrient absorption.",

The camelid saccules contain small quantities of gastric fluid in small pockets surrounded by highly absorptive epithelium and constantly renew this fluid through saccular eversion and refilling. The high rate of contractions, the high surface area-to-volume ratio, and long particle retention times of the camelid forestomach may be responsible for the digestive advantage that camelids have over ruminants with regard to poor-quality forage. 14, 20, 21 The papillae of ruminants also help preserve the ruminal environment through absorption and removal of organic acids from the lumen. This is especially important when VFAs are produced in large quantities, as occurs when a highly fermentable feed is provided. The size of the papillae and surface area increase, over time and with limitations, when VFA production is high, allowing faster removal of VFAs. Thus, the ruminant can adapt itself to higher energy feeds by increasing the rate of acid removal. We do not know if the saccules of camelids are capable of similar adaptation, and our belief is that they are not. Thus, camelids may be less adapted to handle high energy feeds compared with their ruminant counterparts. This is contrary to the popular belief that camelids are resistant to this type of feed-related disease.",

Saccular fluid has a higher bicarbonate concentration than forestomach fluid, and this bicarbonate concentration increases with time if the saccules are exposed to chloride-rich or VFA-rich solutions. 7, 8 This has led to one theory that bicarbonate is secreted across the saccular membrane into the forestomach in exchange for chloride to buffer the acids produced by fermentation. A similar function has been described for the cells of the gastric cardia of monogastrics, which secrete bicarbonate in exchange for chloride from hydrochloric acid to protect that region from acid damage. The problems with extrapolating this function to camelids are twofold: (1) The gastric saccules are rarely exposed to high Water, sodium, and VFAs are absorbed rapidly across the C3 membrane. 28 Approximately 70% of the VFAs, 60% of the sodium, and 30% of the water that enter from C2 are absorbed in C3.

However, clinicians with large hands may choose not to perform the examination to avoid the risk of causing injury to the patient. 34 Rectal examination of the llama is similar to that of the cow; the bladder, reproductive tract, left kidney, and caudal first gastric compartment can usually be palpated. The right abdomen usually has no palpable viscera. The bladder may be distended with urinary tract obstruction or simply because of lack of urination in the stressed camelid, and portions of the more times as it courses dorsad, forming another small spiral, and wraps around the mesenteric root (left to right around the front) to intertwine with the duodenum.

This may be difficult in live animals because of the overlapping structures and is therefore best evaluated on oblique views. Most camelids show penetration. Periodontal disease, which is generally underappreciated in camelids, may similarly facilitate deep infection. 42 Tooth trimming has been incriminated in the occasional incisor or canine abscess, but some camelids have abscesses in front teeth that have never been trimmed. Another possibility that has been raised is infection through the tooth root. Patent infundibulum has been identified in approximately 20% of abscessed teeth. 43 Immunodeficiency also may contribute in some cases. 40 Diagnosis of tooth root abscess can usually be made on the basis of clinical signs, but radiography is necessary to definitively differentiate this from the various other uncommon possibilities. Tooth root abscesses are characterized by lysis and proliferation of bone with a radiolucent pocket around the affected root or roots ( Figure 40-17 ). In contrast, lumpy jaw has lysis and proliferation without associated changes to the tooth root. Bacterial culture may be helpful in selecting antibiotics and definitively diagnosing lumpy jaw. Biopsy is recommended if a significant soft tissue component seems to exist.",

Affected camelids lose saliva out of the mouth and occasionally the nose. The salivary discharge often contains bits of chewed feed (Figure 40 -20) . The head is often held in a low position to facilitate regurgitation. Intermittent appetite is usually retained, exacerbating the obstruction and regurgitation.

Aware camelids usually protect their airway fairly well, although they may cough and have moist sounds on auscultation of the larynx and trachea.

If the obstruction does not resolve, with the camelid tranquilized and restrained with its head depressed below the level of the thoracic inlet, a regular or cuffed stomach tube more difficulty with regurgitation than with swallowing, feeding from a height may aid in keeping the esophagus clear of food but is unlikely to help during rumination. The most beneficial treatment appears to be feeding highly digestible, small particle feedstuffs such as complete pelleted feeds or alfalfa pellets from a bucket raised above the level of the back in small quantities frequently. Others report success with longstem hay. Frequently, it is a matter of finding a feedstuff that the camelid tolerates without developing choke and then monitoring weight. Camelids that lose weight have an understandably worse prognosis than those that do not.

Hereditary megaesophagus has been described in other species, but we have attributed a high proportion of those cases to vascular ring anomalies, which may, in and of themselves, be heritable. 58, 59 A tentative diagnosis may be reached by identification of the characteristic signs. Except in cases of aspiration or the rare cases where an underlying inflammatory lesion is present, clinical pathology changes are usually mild. Esophageal endoscopy may reveal feed distension, or a dilated, flaccid esophagus ( Figure 40 -22) . Plain or contrast radiography, fluoroscopy, and CT are the best confirmatory tests. Plain-film radiography shows the feed-filled esophagus, especially within the thorax. Contrast material helps highlight the feed impaction or constriction (see Figure 36 -1), but should be avoided with complete obstruction because of the risk of aspiration. In the unobstructed esophagus, delayed passage of the contrast material is generally diagnostic-normally it clears almost instantly-but it must be remembered that severely compromised or heavily sedated camelids will have poor esophageal function (Figure 40 -23).

Parenteral sulfa antibiotics may be helpful for Sarcocystis or Toxoplasma infection, and ivermectin may be helpful against larger parasites. Ponazuril and related compounds may also have value in treating protozoal infections. Anecdotally, antiinflammatory medications, including corticosteroids, have led to resolution in some cases. Even if a primary obstructive lesion is identified, correction of that may not occur within the time necessary to prevent the secondary muscle damage to the esophagus. Because camelids with megaesophagus have sphincters coated with keratinized squamous epithelium. If large particles pass this sphincter, they are frequently trapped in the saccular lumen. Wedge-shaped grains, particularly sunflower seeds, appear more prone to do this. Once in the lumen, mineral is laid around the objects, forming stones ( Figure 40 -25). These stones, with the indigenous name \"luan cura,\" were once purported to be of medicinal value to humans. 63, 64 They invariably contain a nidus of plant material, usually a seed surrounded by a mineralized matrix, and may be seen as checkerboard rows of mineral densities on radiography of the abdomen. Wires and other foreign bodies that get trapped in the saccules undergo similar mineralization, perhaps preventing penetrating injury. The outer surface of mineralized objects may be smooth or rough and yellowgreen or black in color. The size usually varies from about 5 mm to 30 mm per side, although kilogram-weight stones have also been described. Mineral analyses of such bezoars at our laboratory and elsewhere have suggested that they may contain different layers of mineral and consist mainly of calcium or magnesium phosphate salts. 65 It has been suggested that the microenvironment of the saccule contributes to magnesium phosphate salt crystallization because of the high bicarbonate and phosphate concentrations in saccular fluid and that the bezoar helps maintain this microenvironment by blocking evacuation of the saccule during forestomach contraction. Small bezoars may initially act as valves that occlude outflow and prevent saccular eversion and large bezoars often completely fill the saccular lumen and may eventually rupture through.",

As most volatile fatty acids these are typically grown as ornamental shrubs, and others grow wild. Camelids are exposed to the ornamentals either by experimenting with unfamiliar plants or when dried leaves blow onto other feedstuffs. Camelids are exposed to the wild forms during off-season packing trips, when these evergreens may be the only green plants available. Actual esophagitis is not a commonly reported lesion with these plants but has been confirmed in cases seen at our clinic. Other irritants such as undiluted phenylbutazone or amprolium may also cause ulcers but are rarely given in sufficient quantities to cause clinical signs. Blister beetle ingestion is another possibility, but this has not yet been described in New World camelids. Lesions with all these irritants are worst in the esophagus and may extend into the forestomach. The mouth is usually unaffected.

Because of the staggering gait, eventual recumbency, and head retroflexing over the back, signs are occasionally misinterpreted as evidence of neurologic disease or colic.

Severely affected animals may collapse into lateral recumbency or die within a few hours of ingestion. Less severely affected camelids may show some obtundation and reluctance to stand or eat for a few days, but they do not develop more severe disease.

Nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drugs (NSAIDs; flunixin meglumine, 0.5 to 1.1 mg/kg, IV, q8-24h) may be helpful to treat toxemia and shock. Treatment with antibiotics (penicillin or ceftiofur at standard doses) and thiamine HCl (10 mg/kg, IM or IV, up to q4h) also are recommended to prevent secondary complications. When gastrotomy is not performed, it is possible, but rare, for acidosis and associated clinical signs to recur over the next 72 hours, as further gastric fermentation occurs.

The last three factors were associated with focal ulceration and perforation at any point along the gastrointestinal tract while the first three were associated with third compartment or proximal duodenal ulceration. In addition to these factors, forestomach acidosis may cause nonperforating, but severe, ulceration in the forestomach and mild ulceration in the third gastric compartment. GI tumors are associated with focal nonperforating ulceration at any point in the GI tract, and copper poisoning may cause massive, diffuse gastric ulceration.

Most of the identified risk factors such as anorexia or intermittent eating (as may occur with sick, transported, or bullied camelids), dehydration, electrolyte or acid-base abnormalities, and gastric hyperacidity (feeding too much grain, or even overindulgence on lush spring grass) could plausibly be linked to poor gastric emptying.

Nonperforating ulcers are usually blamed for causing anemia, depression, inappetence, colic, sensitivity to right cranioventral abdominal palpation, recumbency, and death in camelids of all ages, as in the clinical disorders associated with these lesions in horses, cattle, and humans.

Most case reports describe camelids with chronic diseases, and it is impossible to determine when in the course of the illness the ulcer developed, and what role it played in disease signs. [70] [71] [72] The pathogenesis likewise remains a speculation. The third gastric compartment is long and tubular, running craniocaudal in the right ventral abdomen. Within the first two thirds to 80% of its length, fermentative digestion takes place, and the pH is approximately 6.4. At its caudal extreme, where the organ abruptly turns dorsal and cranial, a small region of hydrochloric acid secretion exists. Peptic ulcers typically occur at this caudal flexure or near the pylorus and into the cranial duodenum, areas where the luminal contents are most acidic or subsequently neutralized (Figure 40-29 ). Most ulcers occur along the greater curvature. The usual suspects-stress, high grain diets, NSAIDs, and concurrent diseases-have been suggested as possible causes, but most camelids known to have ulcers do not have good evidence of any of these. Through retrospective study of case records, we have identified seven historical factors associated with perforating GI ulcers; it is likely that others exist and that some factors vary in importance with geographic location. These specific factors are (1) frequent diagnostic tests may be frustratingly unhelpful. Complete blood cell count (CBC) may reveal toxic changes and immature forms of neutrophils. Abdominal fluid may reveal bacteria or fungi, high or low cell counts, high protein content, and toxic changes. Ultrasonography may reveal thickening of the omentum, flocculation of fluid and pockets of fluid; the caveat is that fluid accumulations are often fairly normal fluid around the lesion, rather than abnormal fluid from the actual lesion. Exploratory surgery or postmortem examination may reveal overt contamination and the hole in the GI tract. Except for surgery, however, all of these tests may also yield normal or equivocal results.",

            "text": "Clostridium perfringens infection has been associated with fatal third compartment gastritis and enteritis in neonatal and adult camelids. As with some other clostridial diseases, the question remains whether Clostridia are primary pathogens or secondary invaders that cause easily recognizable and usually lethal disease. Clostridial organisms are gram-positive, motile, spore-forming, facultatively anaerobic rods. They may be present in low numbers in the gut contents of healthy animals and proliferate under certain conditions. High fermentable carbohydrate in gastric contents and slow gut transit are generally thought to promote clostridial overgrowth. Clostridial organisms are also toxin producers, and slowed transit or organism overgrowth may allow these toxins to reach pathogenic concentrations. Other diseases may facilitate clostridial disease by slowing gut transit, changing the gut microbial population, or damaging the mucosa to allow for clostridial invasion and greater systemic absorption of the toxins. Specifically, peptic ulcers or gastric nematodes are thought to facilitate gastric disease, and nematodes, coronavirus, Giardia, and coccidia are thought to facilitate intestinal disease. 81, 82 In both North America and South America, clostridial gastroenteritis has been associated with herd outbreaks of death. These tend to be associated with damp weather, which also tends to be most conducive to the proliferation of nematode and protozoal pathogens. Crias are generally considered to be more susceptible compared with adults, and outbreaks in South America are associated with a death rate of up to 70% of newborn crias in bad years, but adults are also occasionally affected. 83, 84 Several types of C. perfringens exist. These were traditionally defined by the toxins secreted but now are typically defined by the toxin genes present. Type A is best known for its \u03b1toxin, whereas type C additionally secretes \u03b2-toxin. \u03b5-toxin is the main effector of type D. Type A is usually blamed for addresses both circumstances. Prophylactic and therapeutic goals of restoring or maintaining perfusion; acid-base, mineral, and electrolyte homeostasis; and physical stimulation of progressive gastric motility through the regular provision of good-quality roughage that the camelid can eat comfortably and throughout the day appear to minimize the chance of perforation and perhaps the prevalence of nonperforating ulceration.",

First compartment impactions tend to cause progressive left-sided abdominal distension, loss of appetite, weight loss, and general malaise. Mild colic may be an occasional feature. When the stomach fills to the level of the lower esophageal sphincter, abnormal regurgitation and eructation begin, and the camelid may develop bloat. Gastric motility is diminished, although some degree of normal fecal passage is usually retained.

Some of these are unique to camelids, but many also infest or infect ruminants, other domestic animals, cervids, or other wildlife species as well. In areas where camelids are kept in relative isolation, the camelid-specific parasites may predominate, but where camelids have regular contact with cervids or ruminants, the shared parasites often become more important. Thus, parasite control often must go beyond detection and treatment of parasites in the camelid herd. As a rule, parasitic infections are more associated with ill-thrift than more specific and overt signs of GI disease such as diarrhea or colic, but as such, they are among the most common causes of poordoing in domestic camelids. In spite of this, there are strikingly few scientific reports of disease caused by most of these parasites.",

Infection starts when third-stage (L3) larvae are ingested and burrow into the gastric mucosa. They shed their cuticle to molt into L4 larvae within a few days and begin to feed on blood (mainly Haemonchus) or proteinaceous exudates. Maturation into adults may occur year that young crias are present. This highlights that contaminated puddles and standing water may serve as temporary reservoirs, not just permanent water courses.

The small coccidia are relatively conventional in appearance and life cycle, and will be familiar to anyone acquainted with coccidial disease in domestic poultry or ruminants. The large coccidia of camelids are relatively unique. The small coccidia include, by increasing size of oocysts, Eimeria punoensis (17 to 22\u00b5 in length), E. alpacae (22 to 26\u00b5), and E. lamae (30 to 40\u00b5). 112 Oocysts become more ovoid as the species gets larger, so that E. punoensis is about 16% longer membrane, which engulfs them. They remain at this margin of the cell, and are referred to as intracellular but extracytoplasmic. Within this vacuole, the organism is shielded from both the gut lumen environment and intracellular defenses, and presumably from many chemotherapeutic agents. Cryptosporidium also develops a unique feeder organelle membrane on the inner side of the vacuole to facilitate nutrient uptake from the host cell. They mature to trophozoites, and multiply asexually (schizogony). These new forms (merozoites) are released into the gut lumen, where some of them reattach to epithelial cells and repeat the cycle of multiplication. Others, upon entry into the brush border of a new epithelial cell, mature into Type II meronts, which release Type II merozoites. These invade new cells and mature into the male (microgamont) and female (macrogamont) forms. Microgametes from the microgamonts are released to penetrate macrogamonts, effecting non-multiplicative, sexual reproduction. Fertilized zygotes mature to oocysts. Cryptosporidium is relatively unique among coccidia, in that 20% of oocyst are thin-walled and likely to rupture within the GI tract, and that thick-walled oocysts are usually sporulated, and hence infective, immediately on passage. Rupture of thinwalled oocysts releases a new round of sporozoites and starts the process of infection over. This can repeat until inhibited by the host immune response.",

Adult herdmates occasionally develop diarrhea at the same time as the cria outbreaks, and may at that time be found to be positive on fecal examination; isolated adult cases have been seen as well. Hence, adults must be considered a possible, if minor, source of infection. Larger herds with a large number of births close together are most likely to have outbreaks of cryptosporidiosis, presumably due to passage between camelids. In smaller herds with sporadic cases, other infected species may by introducing the parasite. The fecal material at presentation varies in consistency from watery to pasty, and in color from white, yellow, or green, to tan or green if crias were old enough to be grazing. Other clinical signs of affected crias include reduced fecal production, lethargy, weakness, reduced gastrointestinal sounds, failure to thrive, weight loss to emaciation, and abdominal pain. Relapses often occur after 4 to 7 days of improvement. These are due to autoinfection, a reinitiation of infection by thin-walled cysts in the gut. In crias with diarrhea, common clinicopathologic abnormalities include acidemia, hyperlactemia, azotemia, and hyperglycemia and high aspartate transaminase and gammaglutamyltransferase activities. 104 It is interesting to note that punoensis, 114 15-16 days for E. lamae, 109 and 16-18 days for E. alpacae. 114 The small coccidia are best associated with hemorrhagic, watery diarrhea progressing to weakness, lethargy, weight loss or poor weight gain, feed refusal, dehydration, and eventually shock, coma, and death. 109 Colic, respiratory distress, and cerebral signs are uncommon or late findings. The gut, particularly the terminal jejunum and ileum, is occasionally hemorrhagic or markedly edematous, and may have areas of mucosal hemorrhage, fibrinonecrotic pseudomembranes, or punctate white lesions, but is more commonly grossly non-remarkable. 109, 115 Histologically, lesions are most pronounced in the villi. There is mucosal loss and villus shortening. Immature and mature forms of the coccidia may be present. The submucosa is often filled with hemorrhagic or eosinophilic infiltrates. In severe cases, the mucosa is lost to the basement membrane. Protein loss is considerable, and hypoproteinemia is the most consistent blood abnormality. Anemia, hyponatremia, and hypochloremia are other common abnormalities.",

As such, they resemble E. leuckarti of horses, E. camelli of camels, and other large Eimeria. E. ivitanensis oocysts are elongated ellipses, whereas E. macusaniensis is ovoid and pyriform, resembling a cut avocado or watermelon seed in shape. Both have an obvious polar cap. There is some heterogeneity in size and shape of E. macusanensis, and it is possible that future research will reveal that distinct species exist. E. macusanensis also has a thick wall (approximately 8.5 to 11\u00b5), which makes the cyst extremely durable; 116, 118 identifiable cysts have survived approximately 10,000 years in mummies. 119 than it is wide without a clearly visible polar cap (by standard light microscopy), whereas E. lamae is about 60% longer than it is wide and has an obvious cap (Figure 40-35) . These follow the same general lifecycle as Cryptosporidium with a few notable exceptions. Eimeria oocysts are not thin-walled and are not capable of autoinfection. They do not sporulate and become infective until they have spent 4 to 12 days (for E. lamae) or more outside of the host. 111, 113 After ingestion, sporulated oocysts usually release 8 sporozoites, which penetrate epithelial cells. The host cell nucleus and organelles are marginalized and the cell ruptures with maturation of each parasitic stage. Thus, mucosal loss can be widespread, particularly during the early, multiplicative stages of infection. The prepatent periods are approximately 10 days for E. hypoalbuminemia often become severe (such as 3.8 to 2.2 mg/ dl for serum total protein and 1.8 to 0.6 mg/dl for serum albumin concentrations). There is also often some reduction in serum sodium and chloride concentrations, and hypokalemia becomes more marked with anorexia. With worsening disease, the animal becomes susceptible to translocation of bacteria or toxins through the damaged mucosa, the effects of hypoproteinemia, and circulatory shock. Signs of other organ systems are seen: camelids may develop ascites, hydrothorax, hydropericardium, pharyngeal edema, and cerebral edema, with ensuing abdominal distention, increased respiratory effort, lethargy, tachycardia, hypothermia, dysphagia, salivary loss, and cerebral signs. Eventually, there is also clinicopathologic evidence of the systemic disease including azotemia, metabolic (usually lactic) acidosis, high liver enzyme activity, hyperbilirubinemia, and increases in blood fat fractions. Abdominocentesis usually yields a transudate. Abdominal imaging is also inconclusive: colicky camelids may have ileus and fluid-distended intestine, though usually to a lesser degree than camelids with GI obstruction. Overtly thickened bowel wall is rare (<10% of cases). In some cases, signs are insidious, and the animal is simply found dead.",

Strategic use of anticoccidial drugs may also be considered as a supplemental means of controlling coccidiosis. Since outbreaks of coccidiosis are common in the wetter months, prophylactic drug regimes should be used during these times of year, especially if they coincide with the first 6 months of a newborn's life. Consideration should be given to application of preventative measures before and during stressful events such as weaning, shearing, or herd movements. Treatment medications may be used intermittently for control. Alternatively, decoquinate may be added into feed at 0.5mg/kg/day for 28 days. Use of ionophore antibiotics such as monensin or salinomycin is discouraged without further research regarding safety and efficacy, because they have been associated with toxicosis in camelids. 128 Balantidium coli, which is an amoeba, has been described in camels and anecdotally in camelids. 129 In the Middle East, camels are postulated to be the reservoir population for human infections. 130 In alpacas, Balantidium is thought to cause diarrhea without weight loss in adults, and occasionally diarrhea in crias.",

Severe disease and death appear to be able to occur within 3 weeks of initial exposure and 2 weeks before establishment of patency. There is growing evidence that crias shedding small Eimeria oocysts or showing signs of enterotoxemia, may actually be dying of prepatent E. macusaniensis infection. 81, 82, 122 Additionally, there are increasing reports of prepatent or patent disease in adult camelids. 81, 118, 123, 124 Some of these are long-time herd residents, but most have a history of transportation and mixing with new groups of animals. Whereas shows, sales, and movement for breeding may cause stress and inhibit the immune response, the simplest explanation may lie in eating habits: new entrants in a herd are more likely to eat off the ground than out of feeders, or more likely to eat in the less desirable areas of pasture.

In younger camelids, gastroenteritis is more likely to result in clinical diarrhea, whereas in older camelids, diarrhea is often absent or easy to miss. In fact, in adults, it is frequently counterintuitive to directly link the presenting signs to GI illness. In addition to or instead of diarrhea, general signs include weight loss or poor weight gain, ill-thrift, and increasing lethargy, weakness, and loss of appetite. It is one of the most common causes for weakness, weight loss, hypoproteinemia, or ill-thrift in our area. Some animals show colic signs, probably more with E. macusaniensis than with any other parasitic gastroenteritis, and coccidioisis may contribute to some intestinal accidents. 126, 127 As the disease progresses, hypoproteinemia worsens without commensurate anemia; mild anemia is common, but hypoproteinemia and replacing microscopic methods of detecting giardiasis. 135 Although these have not been tested extensively in camelids, the large host range of Giardia suggests that they may be of some value. In all cases, and especially in chronically infected animals, shedding is inconsistent, so serial tests may be indicated.",

A number of pitfalls, namely, prepatent or peripatent disease, intermittent shedding, and ova or oocysts with a range of densities, exist. Prepatent disease is more common in the parasites with longer life cycles, that is, the helminths and E. macusaniensis. Prepatent and shedding periods for the most important camelid GI parasites are listed in Table 40 -1. With E. macusaniensis, clinical disease and death may occur up to 2 weeks before the appearance of oocysts in feces. 81 In the case of helminths, the gap may be several weeks as well, or even longer for Capillaria and Trichuris. For small coccidia, Cryptosporidum, and Giardia, clinical disease usually appears around the same time as passage of fecal cysts but may precede it by a day or two. If prepatent disease is suspected, serial fecal analyses at 2-to 4-day intervals may be used to confirm the organism; presumptive treatments may be instituted in the interim. When looking for prepatent or peripatent shedding of protozoan parasites, it is important to keep the shedding curve in mind; Eimeria oocyst passage resembles a bell-shaped curve, with few at the earliest stages, peaking in 1 to 2 weeks before tapering off. The same is true for Giardia and Cryptosporidium except that shedding may occur in multiple waves. Shedding curves are less of an issue with helminths, whose adults are relatively long-lived.",

            "text": "For Giardia, light microscopy of a direct fecal smear (a small amount of feces swabbed or rubbed on a drop of water or saline on a microscope side, or simply a swab of watery feces) may reveal the motile trophozoites. Both trophozoites and cysts may be disrupted by flotation solutions, so the direct smear is indicated if Giardia is suspected. Zinc sulfate solution (33%) appears to float cysts (SG = 1.05) well with minimal disruption, whereas saturated saline rapidly collapses them, and sucrose solution may be too viscous. Immunofluorescent or Wheatley trichrome staining may be used to aid in cyst detection (Figure 40 -38). Antigen detection assays have been of this solution may inhibit flotation of small coccidia or Nematodirus but may be better than saline for Cryptosporidium and Giardia. 4. McMaster counting chamber. Rather than floating the eggs in a tube onto a coverslip, this test involves putting a slurry into a counting chamber. A 4-g fecal sample is liquefied in 26 mL of saturated saline or sucrose solution by using a mortar and pestle. The suspension is funneled through a screen into a 50-mL tube. The filtrate is then used to fill two chambers of a counting slide, which is examined under light microscopy. Multiplying the number of eggs of each type by 25 yields an approximation of eggs per gram of feces. Most parasites can be seen this way, but this test is not particularly sensitive for detecting low levels of infection. The denser parasite eggs sink very quickly in saline and will be missed if any delay occurs before counting. 5. Double centrifuge technique. A 2-g fecal sample is liquefied in 98 mL of water by using a mortar and pestle or a similar system. The sample is allowed to dissolve completely, preferably overnight, and then the sample is stirred to create a homogeneous solution. Ten milliliters of the sample is poured into a graduated centrifuge tube and spun at 200\u00d7 gravity for 5 minutes. The supernatant is removed and a few milliliters of sugar solution (as above) added to resuspend the pellet. The tube is refilled with 10 to 12 mL of the sugar solution and then centrifuged again at 200\u00d7 gravity for 5 minutes. The tube is filled until a positive meniscus forms, and a coverslip is placed on top. After a suitable time, the coverslip is removed and placed on a glass slide for counting. For most parasites, peak ova or oocysts concentrations are found 4 to 6 hours later, but most positive samples will have been revealed within 1 hour. Multiplying the counts of all of each type of ovum or oocyst seen by 5 yields an approximation of ova or oocysts per gram of feces. The advantages of this technique are that the longer dissolving period enables more eggs to be released from fecal matter and the pelleting concentrates the eggs. This technique appears to be the best way to find small numbers of eggs, as with Nematodirus, Capillaria or many parasites at the onset of their shedding period. 6. Sedimentation. Feces are dissolved in water and either left to settle or pelleted in a centrifuge. A drop or two of the sediment is placed on a slide for microscopic examination. This is the most used technique for detecting fluke eggs, which do not float in most solutions. The Flukefinder is a specialized system for sedimenting fluke eggs. Sedimentation is also useful for detecting Balantidium coli. 129 7. Baermann test. This test is most commonly done on fresh feces to identify lungworms but may also be used for detecting Strongyloides. If the sample is allowed to sit for a few days, strongyle larvae may hatch out of their eggs and confound the diagnosis. This test involves suspending a fecal sample in cheesecloth within a funnel or a cone-shaped vessel. The vessel is filled with warm water and left to sit for at least 8 hours. Free-living larvae will concentrate at the bottom of the cone and can be pipetted out for examination under a microscope.",

The moniker \"modified\" has been taken to the extreme in some instances, where the \"modified\" versions of some tests bear little resemblance to their previous versions. The preferred test depends to some degree on the parasite we wish to detect, and unfortunately, no one test optimally detects all parasites. 136 Many tests completely miss certain parasites. 1. Direct smear. This is a simple test, in which a small amount of feces is liquefied with a small amount of saline solution and smeared onto a microscope slide. Only categoric quantification is possible. This is best for detecting motile protozoa such as Giardia and Balantidium trophozoites and adequate for most types of worm ova at high concentrations. 129 Sheather solution (454 g of sucrose in 355 mL of hot water plus 6 mL of formalin [optional] to prevent microbial growth) has a higher SG than saline (1.27) and thus will float all but liver fluke eggs. The high viscosity one. If history, signs, and the diagnostic evaluation support a diagnosis of endoparasitism, it should be considered regardless of egg count. By the same token, finding a few ova or oocysts in clinically healthy animals rarely reflects an emergency situation. Ambient conditions are also important in judging \"normal\" shedding. Most worms and small coccidia follow the general pattern described for other herbivores, that is, older camelids are generally resistant to disease. Therefore, higher oocysts counts should be expected in camelids less than 1 year of age, and up to a few hundred coccidial oocysts per gram can be considered normal. Counts much higher than 200 oocysts per gram are unusual in adults unless the camelid is otherwise debilitated or in an overcrowded environment. Ova counts are similar, with the same caveats, as well as the considerations that certain parasites (Nematodirus battus, Capillaria, Lamanema) may shed few eggs and that many are also associated with prepatent or peripatent disease. With Giardia, the more cysts found in feces, the more likely it is that Giardia is the cause of diarrhea. Shedding may by episodic, corresponding to waves of replication. Identification of parasites is based on recognition of the characteristic appearances of their ova or oocysts. Most of these resemble their analogs affecting other species of animal. Most strongyle-type worms release normal strongyle (trichostrongylid)-type eggs, and differentiating them requires experience, fine measurement, genetic tests, or hatching assays. Because of its individual importance, differentiating Haemonchus from other strongyles may be critical. A straightforward fluorescent-staining technique has recently been made available and appears to be useful for this purpose. 137 Nematodirus and Lamanema have double-sized, strongyletype eggs. For the less pathogenic Nematodirus, these are relatively symmetric and clear around their central cells. For N. battus and Lamanema (Figure 40-39) , one side appears flatter than the other, and they are a darker brown around their central cells.",

Escherichia coli and other coliform organisms have been isolated from blood and postmortem tissues in a number of cases, but it is always difficult to interpret whether they are primary invaders or colonizers of preexisting lesions. Coliform enteritis is most common as a manifestation of neonatal sepsis, which is covered in Chapter 42. Convincing evidence of a predisposing ulcerative process such as coccidiosis, GI worms, forestomach acidosis, impaction, or a bezoar usually exists in older animals. Failure of passive transfer and a dirty environment may increase the risk in crias. Lesions are usually ulcerative and highly inflammatory. Therefore, most coliform infections appear to be opportunistic and affect individual animals, not groups, and preexisting gut damage may facilitate infection. No particular reservoir population has been identified. Since E. coli is a common fecal organism, any number of animals may serve as hosts.",

Growing evidence in camelids suggests that C. perfringens is a secondary invader of tissues damaged by coccidiosis, giardiasis, or animal problems and (2) contagious herd outbreaks. The distinction may be blurred by management conditions that cause multiple animals to develop noncontagious conditions at the same time, lack of enough same-aged stock for an outbreak of an infectious disorder to occur, or slow-acting infectious agents that strike individual animals at infrequent intervals. Other sporadic conditions include sepsis, peritonitis, or noninfectious ulcerative disorders. These may become commonplace in herds living in conditions of poor hygiene or with a high prevalence of failure of passive transfer. Contagious conditions may be caused by bacteria, viruses, and protozoa.

Clinical pathology evaluation revealed electrolyte or acid-base disturbances that were usually mild and could not account for the degree of obtundation. Abnormalities in the leukogram were often more remarkable: leukopenia or leukocytosis, left-shift, and toxic changes. Thus, the original data about bacterial condition appeared to be justified. Indeed, many of these animals died in spite of treatment, and postmortem examination revealed hemorrhage, inflammation, and necrosis in the gut wall, occasionally full-thickness perforations of GI viscera, and systemic signs of sepsis.

These were first noted in the Pacific Northwest but have since been reported in various states in the United States. Camelids of all ages are affected, with most outbreaks starting with alpacas coming home from shows, sales, or trips to other premises for reproductive purposes. Llamas may also be affected, but most outbreaks start with affected alpacas. Crias, which are not usually taken to shows, appear to be more affected by dehydration and electrolyte loss compared with older animals. The most common isolates from these outbreaks are coronavirus in all identified in unweaned crias with diarrhea in one Oregon study. 84 It was identified by electron microscopy in 42% of cases and affected 64% of herds studied, with an age distribution from 10-150 days at the time of diagnosis. Another U.S. study found coronavirus in only 6.9% of 9-to 94-day-old crias with diarrhea and no rotavirus, 86 but electron microscopy was not performed in all cases. Since both those studies were conducted, there have been repeated outbreaks of diarrhea in North American camelids, including crias, with coronavirus identified more commonly than any other potential pathogen. Clinical infection has been confirmed in crias as young as 1 day of age. Rotavirus has also been identified in some cases. Shows appear to be a common site for transmission between herds. It is genetically relatively conservative, but strains appear to be species-specific. The camelid strain appears to be related to bovine and porcine coronavirus, but represents a unique strain. 149 Whether it originally arose from a bovine or porcine strange is unknown. Non-clinical carrier animals or clinically-ill ones may introduce the virus to new susceptible hosts. Incubation periods are between about 18 and 96 hours, with the primary site of replication being the absorptive epithelial cells of the small and large intestine. Compared to rotavirus, it appears to damage a greater length of intestine, and more severely affect the regions it infects.",

In New World camelids, it has been isolated from diarrhea outbreaks involving neonatal crias 144 or adults, and the occasional older crias. 100 Rotavirus was detected by ELISA and confirmed by electron microscopy in 2 of 53 fecal samples collected during a diarrhea outbreak among 1-day to 4-month-old Patagonian guanacos. 87 ELISA failed to detect coronavirus in any of those samples, but the sensitivity of ELISA for either virus in camelids is unknown. This outbreak affected 100% of the crias in 2 separate herds, being fatal in 83% of cases, but other pathogens, including Salmonella, were isolated from some cases. Animals were kept in small yards and raised on powdered cow's milk. In all cases disease was acute in onset and the stool was dark-green. Dehydration occurred and death followed within 2-6 days. Affected animals were 7 to 40 days old, and a high proportion of them were also shown to be seropositive to rotavirus.

Hypochloremia, hyponatremia, and metabolic acidosis are reasonably common findings with viral enteritis and may be severe. With protozoal enteritis, these abnormalities are less common or severe but still may be present, especially in neonates. Because electrolyte loss is relatively rare with camelid illness, in general, these findings, even if mild, point strongly to an enteric disorder. With more severe dehydration or shock, lactic acidosis and azotemia develop. With any sick camelid, hyperglycemia is common; urinary loss of excess glucose may exacerbate dehydration, especially if water intake is inadequate. Water loss may, therefore, outstrip electrolyte loss, leading to more severe evidence of dehydration (tachycardia, obtundation, weakness, feed refusal) than would be expected in a ruminant with diarrhea and a similar degree of hyponatremia and hypochloremia.

Peritonitis leads to irritation and inflammation of the gut wall, affecting gut function, and often resulting in diarrhea. It also affects the transit of fluid and protein through the peritoneal space, affecting the gut's ability to transport fluid out of ingesta and into circulation. The four major causes of bacterial peritonitis that we see are (1) translocation of bacteria through a damaged gut or urogenital viscus wall, (2) direct introduction of bacteria through a wound or penetrating instrument, (3) release of bacteria through a ruptured gut, uterus, or urinary structure, and (4) hematogenous infection of the peritoneal cavity. Wounds are less common than the other three causes, which often are difficult to distinguish; by the time the animal's abdomen is examined before or after death and is found to have peritoneal exudate, reddened and thickened gut walls, and a spot of leakage or rupture, it is impossible to say which lesion led to the other two. The most common organisms isolated from abdominal fluid of camelids are Streptococcus and Escherichia. Streptococcus infection is usually hematogenous, and hence the primary pathogen, whereas Escherichia may come from a variety of sources. Specifically, streptococcal peritonitis is part of the \"alpaca fever\" complex, a cause of fever, diarrhea, colic, and respiratory disease covered in Chapter 37. Being hematogenous, streptococcal infections may not have caused much physical damage by the time of diagnosis and may respond well to treatment. In contrast, coliform infections usually involve major morphologic changes to a viscus wall, changes that may be irreversible or require surgical resection.",

Signs of systemic disease that suggest more than simple enteritis include fever; injected mucous membranes; other GI signs such as colic (peritonitis, slaframine or arsenic intoxication), vomiting (poisonous plant ingestion), abdominal distension (may reflect enteritis with protein loss or problems with the hepatic or urogenital systems); or dyspnea (streptococcal pleuritis in addition to peritonitis, or sepsis in general).

Reports on ruminal squamous cell carcinoma in cattle suggest a toxic etiology, particularly bracken fern toxicosis. We have not seen a sufficient number of camelids with this disease to make a similar inference, but bracken fern toxicosis has been associated with squamous cell carcinoma of the urinary tract in camelids.

[164] [165] [166] [167] The organism is shed in the feces of infected animals and may survive on pasture or in lagoons up to a year, especially under cool, moist, acidic conditions. As environmental survival is limited, soil contamination is unlikely to be the source of infection for camelids on pasture unless ruminants have recently grazed on it. The prevalence of chronic shedder or carrier camelids also appears to be low, although more sensitive diagnostic techniques may reveal more subclinical shedders. 164 Therefore, contact with an actively shedding ruminant or contaminated ruminant product appears to be the most likely source of infections in camelids. Of ruminant products, goat or cow colostrum is the most widely used in camelids and also is likely to be ingested by the most susceptible host, the neonate. Conventional pasteurization procedures do not completely kill M. avium ssp. paratuberculosis in colostrum, so enteritis may be the most common cause of chronic diarrhea and weight loss. Lymphocytic-plasmocytic enteritis is similar but far less common. Historically, camelids with either form of IBD often have a longer clinical course, with recurrent bouts of diarrhea and weight loss lasting several years in some instances.",

Feed changes may be instituted on an empirical basis, but this has not been particularly rewarding in the past. Supportive care, including plasma transfusions, may be necessary for severely compromised patients. Once all of this has been addressed and infectious agents have been ruled out, immunosuppressive treatment may be attempted. Sick camelids are prone to developing secondary bacterial infections when treated with steroids, so antibiotic coverage should be considered, at least in the initial stages of treatment. Immunosuppressive treatments have not seen extensive use in camelids. One possible regimen involves 3 weeks of prednisone animals infected with M. avium ssp. paratuberculosis. Most premortem diagnostic tests are more accurate for animals with clinical disease, making subclinical carrier animals difficult to identify. Fecal culture remains the standard, but false-negatives do occur, and positive results may take 4 to 12 weeks. 164 Culling all culture-positive animals appears to have greatly reduced the prevalence of this disease in Australia.",

Pain from mesenteric stretch is frequently more severe with colonic or distal jejunal obstruction than with duodenal obstruction because in the latter case, much of the intestinal fluid may be refluxed into the gastric compartments.

Blood abnormalities include severe hypoalbuminemia; with obstruction, hypochloremia, metabolic alkalosis, and azotemia develop. The most severe lesions are in the adoral sections of the small intestine, which is different from the predilection for ileal hypertrophy in horses with this disorder. 174 The cranial distribution makes palpation per rectum challenging, but the thickened loops and possibly gastric wall may be detected with ultrasonography. Exploratory laparotomy may be performed to obtain a biopsy sample, diagnose the cause of the chronic weight loss and diarrhea, and potentially relieve the obstruction. Grossly, the thickening differs from IBD or Johne disease in that the affected intestine does not have thickened rugose mucosal folds.

Additional bezoars may be found in C1 or C3, and in occasional cases, the entire gastric compartment or proximal loop of the ascending colon is filled with a feed impaction. Even more rarely, impaction may be caused by ingestion of sand. 46 Bezoars most commonly lodge where the mesentery is short and the GI tract narrows: the pylorus, the duodenum aborad from the ampulla, and the loops of the spiral colon. 36 The pylorus represents the first major reduction from the gastric diameter (see Figure 40-7) . The cranial duodenum has a significant reduction in diameter after the ampullae. Bezoars are also occasionally found in the jejunum, but irritation to the gut mucosa orad from the obstruction usually suggests that the obstruction originated in the duodenum and migrated. The diameter of the ascending colon decreases by over 80% from its origin by the cecum to its termination in the transverse colon (Figure 40-48 ). Ingesta is dehydrated over this same course from an oatmeal consistency to formed fecal pellets.

They form aggregate phytobezoars, presumably in the gastric compartments, which collect there or intermittently migrate into the lower GI tract. The C2 canal between the esophagus or C1 and C3 is never as narrow as the reticuloomasal orifice in ruminants and may not be as effective in preventing passage of large particles. Obstructing bezoars are generally slightly larger than the pyloric diameter or the gastric microbial population. In crias, this \"milk colic\" may be severe, but usually lasts only a few hours. As in other species, poorly digestible milk replacers or viral damage to the intestinal brush border may contribute to aberrant fermentation. In adults, gas colic is extremely rare. In all ages, infection by gas-producing bacteria may contribute to colic signs with some forms of enteritis.",

Multiple rotations of the curvature of the pyloric antrum, and the remainder of the duodenum and the first two thirds of the jejunum also hang from a relatively short mesentery. The mesenteric root lengthens into the terminal jejunum, ileum, cecum, and ascending colon. Motility may be impaired by other lesions; abdominal adhesions are not uncommon, particularly around the spiral colon. Cecocolic impaction in a small number of camelids from the Netherlands and Missouri has been blamed on dysautonomia.

Ultrasonography may also be used to look for uterine torsion, urolithiasis, renal disease, liver disease, mass lesions, and pancreatitis. Table 40 -2 summarizes the most characteristic clinical findings for the various types of lesions. The typical camelid with small intestinal obstruction is mildly painful, has abdominal distension, is dehydrated, and has hypochloremic metabolic alkalosis with a high gastric fluid chloride concentration. Because of the mild signs, camelids with this type of lesion often are not noted to be sick for several days and often develop mucosal injury and inflammatory complications before detection. Thus, camelids with small intestinal obstruction have historically done poorly. Camelids with cecocolic obstruction have overt signs of colic, minimal dehydration and metabolic disturbances, and lesions that are easily detectable by rectal palpation or ultrasonography. Because of more timely detection and treatment and less tissue and metabolic compromise, camelids with cecocolic obstruction have a better prognosis. Camelids with entrapments and strangulations generally act like camelids with intraluminal obstruction of the same site except that camelids with strangulating lesions deteriorate more quickly without appropriate treatment. Hyperlactemia and high lactate content in serosanguinous abdominal fluid are characteristics of strangulation. Camelids with inflammatory lesions tend to have overt colic signs, but these may be overshadowed by depression. They tend to have abnormal CBC, blood protein and electrolyte concentrations, and peritoneal fluid but have other clinical features which overlap with those seen with obstructive lesions. Prognosis with inflammatory lesions is variable; most camelids have a poor prognosis, but those with some specific diseases (pancreatitis, E. macusaniensis enteritis, streptococcal peritonitis, mild bowel inflammation) may do well.",

It is ideal for detecting fluid accumulation within the bowel or the abdomen. Transrectal imaging is best for the same lesions as those palpated per rectum, that is, those in the caudal abdomen. This technique has the advantage that it can be performed in many camelids that are too small for palpation. Transcutaneous imaging through the right paralumbar fossa shows the same structures and reveals the size and contents of the gastric compartments, as well as the amount, location, and nature of free fluid. 31 Ultrasonography allows assessment of bowel contents and motility. Changes in wall thickness are usually subtle. Normal intestines should have intermittent pockets of hypoechoic fluid and clear evidence of peristalsis. Obstructed or damaged bowel has larger, stable pockets of fluid with minimal evidence of progressive motility (Figure 40-58) . 49 This is easier to find with lesions of the colon or jejunum because of their accessibility. Cranial obstruction may be inferred on finding Shock treatment is most vital with strangulation and inflammatory lesions. IV fluids are key. An initial bolus of up to 5% of body weight (10% in neonates) may be administered, if the patient will tolerate it and is not too hypoproteinemic. With alkalosis, 0.9% sodium chloride may be used, but with most disorders, a polyionic, buffered fluid is adequate. Sodium bicarbonate may be added to correct severe acidosis (pH <7. 25) , but this treatment is not particularly effective in the face of lactic acidosis. Supplemental potassium chloride, administered at less than 0.5 mEq/kg/hr may also be helpful. Because of the small patient size and rarity of severe hyponatremia or hypochloremia, hypertonic saline is rarely necessary. Plasma transfusion or administration of a synthetic colloid may be necessary to treat hypoproteinemia.

In general, camelids with transient colic, a portion of those with inflammatory lesions, and a small portion of those with obstructive lesions respond to medical treatment. A portion of those with obstructive lesions and a small portion of those with inflammatory lesions benefit from surgery. Failure of either of these modalities is usually caused by the presence of advanced inflammatory lesions. In some cases, as with ruptured gastric ulcers, these lesions may occur at the same time as the first clinical signs and are therefore unavoidable. In other cases, as with abrasion of the bowel wall obstructed by a bezoar, advanced inflammatory lesions may develop because of failure to recognize the significance of earlier clinical findings.",

It is also difficult to determine how long to continue medical treatment before resorting to surgery. Although some evidence suggests that some intraluminal obstructions resolve with medical treatment, other evidence suggests that delaying surgery in camelids with intraluminal obstruction may be detrimental; many intestinal ruptures found at surgery or necropsy occur at the site of a chronic intraluminal obstruction. Our best estimates indicate that gut friability becomes life threatening within 4 days of obstruction. Because cranial obstructions usually cause less overt signs compared with caudal obstructions, damage to the bowel wall may be more advanced on first examination of camelids with cranial obstructions.

The choice between ventral midline and right paralumbar exploratory laparotomy often is based on the preference of the surgeon, as both approaches allow for palpation, visualization, and exteriorization of most abdominal viscera, including the spiral colon, cecum, most of the small intestine, and the pyloric antrum of the third gastric compartment. The pyloric antrum may be difficult to exteriorize through a ventral midline incision when the third gastric compartment is distended with fluid. Therefore, a right paracostal or paralumbar incision may be preferable when a gastric or duodenal lesion is suspected. 36, 44 Herniation of GI viscera through the body wall incision may occur after ventral midline laparotomy, although we have noted this to occur more frequently after cesarean section in large female llamas than after general surgical exploration of the abdomen of camelids.",

If not noted, the cria may become clinically ill or develop abdominal distension. Techniques to correct atresia ani in camelids are similar to those used in other species (Figure 40-59) .

Although crias with these disorders do not pass meconium, they do have an anus, so the lesion is not readily apparent on inspection of the newborn. Atresia jejuni is the most serious segmental disorder because less healthy gut surface is available for nutrient and colostral absorption. This makes the neonate highly susceptible to hypoglycemia and infectious disease. Crias with intestinal atresia are usually bright at birth but develop progressive depression and abdominal distension over the first few days of life. Colic and tenesmus may be seen with atresia coli. No reports of surgical correction of intestinal atresia in camelids have been published, but it is likely that procedures developed for ruminants would be adequate. We have seen a cria with atresia jejuni at two separate sites, so the entire bowel should be examined before surgical correction is performed. Broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs, IV fluids, and plasma are often required before and after surgery. Although a genetic basis for atresia coli and ani exist in other species, we do not have enough data to assess the genetic basis of these abnormalities in camelids.
