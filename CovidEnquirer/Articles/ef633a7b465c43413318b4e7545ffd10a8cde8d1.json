            "text": "Although porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) has caused huge economic losses in the pork industry worldwide, an effective live, attenuated vaccine is lacking. In this study, an original US, highly virulent PED virus (PEDV) strain PC22A was serially passaged in Vero CCL81 and Vero BI cells. The virus growth kinetics in cell culture, virulence in neonatal pigs and the whole genomic sequences of selected passages were examined. Increased virus titers and sizes of syncytia were observed at the 65th passage level (P65) and P120, respectively. Based on the severity of clinical signs, histopathological lesions and the distribution of PEDV antigens in the gut, the virulence of P100 and above, but not P95C13 (CCL81), was markedly reduced in 4-day-old, caesarian-derived, colostrum-deprived piglets. Subsequently, the attenuation of P120 and P160 was confirmed in 4-day-old, conventional suckling piglets. Compared with P120, P160 replicated less efficiently in the intestine of pigs and induced a lower rate of protection after challenge. Sequence analysis revealed that the virulent viruses [P3 and P95C13 (CCL81)] had one, one, sixteen (including an early termination of nine amino acids) and two amino acid differences in nonstructure protein 1 (nsp1), nsp4, spike and membrane proteins, respectively, from the fully attenuated P160. However, the overall pattern of attenuation-related genetic changes in PC22A differed from those of the other four pairs of PEDV wild type strains and their attenuated derivatives. These results suggest that PEDV attenuation can occur through multiple molecular mechanisms. The knowledge provides insights into potential molecular mechanisms of PEDV attenuation.",

It is a glycoprotein that binds to the host cell receptors and induces the subsequent virus-cell membrane fusion (Wicht et al., 2014) .

Without adequate protection via lactogenic immunity, 100% morbidity and 50-100% mortality resulting from severe diarrhea were typically observed in neonatal piglets (Stevenson et al., 2013) . Subsequently, PEDV variants, including OH851 and Iowa106 strains, sharing the same insertions and deletions in the S1 region of S protein as the \"classical\" PEDV strains, such as PEDV prototype CV777 strain, were reported and designated as \"S INDEL\" PEDV strains Wang et al., 2014) . Compared with the original US PEDV (non-S INDEL) strains, some US S INDEL strains showed lower pathogenicity but could still cause severe diarrhea and death in some pig litters (Lin et al., 2015a) similar to the CV777 strain (Pensaert and Martelli, 2016) .",

However, the efficacy of these traditional vaccines against the emerging PEDV strains are questionable because epidemic PED outbreaks have been reported on routinely vaccinated swine farms in China (Sun et al., 2015) . The high virulence of the emerging non-S INDEL PEDV strains (Liu et al., 2015; Stevenson et al., 2013) and/or the antigenic variations between the classical and emerging PEDV strains (Lin et al., 2015b contribute to vaccine failure. Currently, a single inactivated PEDV vaccine (Zoetis, Florham Park, NJ) and an alphavirus-based PEDV subunit vaccine based on the emerging non-S INDEL PEDV strains (Merck, Ames, IA) are conditionally licensed in the US to vaccinate sows to produce lactogenic immunity and provide suckling piglets with passive immunity against PEDV. These vaccines are safe, but lack protective efficacy (Crawford et al., 2016) . The protection of nursing piglets against PEDV relies mainly on lactogenic immunity induced by natural infection and/or live, attenuated PEDV vaccination of sows, as was observed for another swine enteric coronavirus, transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) (Langel et al., 2016) . After antigenic sensitization in the gut of sows, pathogen-specific IgA plasmablasts migrate to the mammary glands, where they localize and produce secretory IgA (sIgA) antibodies into colostrum/milk (gut-mammary-sIgA axis) (Langel et al., 2016) . As reported in previous PEDV and TGEV studies, inactivated vaccines usually elicit less robust protective immune responses than live, attenuated vaccines when used in native sows (Chattha et al., 2015; Song et al., 2007) .",

They were isolated from the same farm outbreak with three SNPs and belong to the original US highly virulent PEDV strains. PC22A had been isolated and passaged three times in Vero cell culture before passaging once in a gnotobiotic pig, and is designated as PC22A P3 virus pool. Its virulence was confirmed in neonatal pigs (Liu et al., 2015; Jung et al., 2014) . However, its challenge dose for weaned pigs has not been determined. In the present study, PC22A was passaged regularly to a total of P160 in Vero cells every 4 to 6 days ( Fig. 1 ) as described previously (Oka et al., 2014) . On the other hand, PC21A virus pool was prepared by passaging the original PC21A intestinal contents in gnotobiotic piglets before the virus was isolated in Vero cell culture . The challenge dose (12 log 10 genomic equivalent (GE) per pig) of PC21A in PEDV-exposed weaned pigs has been examined and optimized in our earlier study evaluating the pathogenicity and cross-protection activity between the original US and S INDEL PEDV strains (Lin et al., 2015a) . Therefore, we used PC21A to challenge weaned pigs in this study. Two Vero cell lines, Vero CCL81 (ATCC No.CCL-81) and Vero BI (a gift from Boehringer-Ingelheim in 1990), were used. At P95 (passaged in CCL81) and P100 (passaged in BI), virus was plaque-purified as described previously (Oka et al., 2014) . The S1 was amplified by conventional RT-PCR and sequenced from 8 plaques of P95 (CCL81) and P100. All the clones of P95 (CCL81) had identical S1 sequences and clone#13 was selected for animal studies. Two clones of P100 (P100C4 and P100C6) had 2 nucleotide differences in S1 region and were selected for further characterization. P100C4 was subjected to additional 10 passages (P100C4 + P10) to examine genetic stability.",

To evaluate the reduction of virulence among different passages of PC22A, 100 and 1000 PFU were used in CDCD and conventional suckling piglet studies, respectively. Compared with piglets inoculated with P3, the onset of diarrhea and viral shedding was slightly delayed in piglets inoculated with P95C13 (CCL81). However, the morbidity and mortality rates of P95C13 (CCL81)-inoculated piglets were still 100%. On the other hand, lower morbidity, no mortality, milder clinical signs and histological lesions were found in P100C4-, P100C6-and P100C4 + P10inoculated piglets, indicating higher degree of attenuation in vivo (Table 1 ). However, one piglet inoculated with P100C6 still had severe villous atrophy at 10 dpi (Table 2) , suggesting the incomplete attenuation of this virus. In the P120 group, the onset of clinical signs and viral shedding were postponed until 5 dpi. Longer incubation time, lower viral shedding titers (Table 1) along with less and limited viral antigen distribution in the intestines (Table 2; Fig. 3 ) suggested that P120 replicated less efficiently in vivo than P100C4, P100C6 and P100C4 + P10. In the P140 and P160 groups, viral shedding titers and duration were reduced further, suggesting P160 full attenuation in vivo (Table 1) . We hypothesized that adaptation of PC22A to non-porcine Vero cells decreased its replication efficiency in its natural host (Sato et al., 2011) . Piglets are known to develop age-dependent resistance to PEDV disease (Lin et al., 2015a; Shibata et al., 2000) . Thus, a prolonged incubation time reduces the severity of PEDV infection and disease, leading to low mortality rates.",

            "text": "One strategy for PEDV vaccination is to immunize the sows to induce adequate lactogenic immunity to passively protect neonatal piglets from PEDV infection and disease via antibodies in colostrum and milk (Chattha et al., 2015; Langel et al., 2016; Saif et al., 1972) . This objective may be accomplished by the selection of an optimal vaccine candidate, whose antigenicity is close to that of the epidemic strain and virulence is minimal or absent in young piglets. In the present study, the attenuation of PC22A P120 and P160 in CDCD piglets was further confirmed in conventional piglets, although short-term (3.33 AE 1.21 days) diarrhea was still observed in some piglets inoculated with the high dose (1000 PFU) of P120. In general, the level of virus replication in piglets and sows correlated with the titers of serum/milk IgG and IgA PEDV antibodies and the level of in vivo cross-protection against challenge with the highly virulent PEDV PC21A strain (Table 3) . Although mucosa immunity was not measured in the present study, it was reported that PEDV-specific IgA and IgG antibodysecreting cell responses in blood correlated well with the responses found in gut-associated lymphoid tissues (de Arriba et al., 2002) and a strong positive correlation between the anti-PEDV IgA levels in fecal and serum samples has been identified (Gerber and Opriessnig, 2015) . Compared with P160, P120 induced higher titers of serum IgA and IgG PEDV antibodies in piglets, corresponding to a higher protection rate. A similar phenomenon was observed in previous studies on TGEV and PEDV: compared with virulent strains, several attenuated TGEV/PEDV vaccines administered orally replicated poorly in the gut, induced low milk antibody titers in sows and resulted in low protection efficacy in suckling pigs (Chattha et al., 2015; de Arriba et al., 2002) .",

            "text": "The molecular basis for the observed PEDV attenuation is not yet completely elucidated. The virulence of P100C4 and P100C6, but not P95C13 (CCL81), was significantly reduced in 4-day-old CDCD piglets. A six nucleotide (TTGGTG) deletion at nt positions 164-169 of S protein, which corresponded to the change of IGE55-57 K, occurred in P100C4 and P100C6, but not in P95C13 (CCL81). Interestingly, the same mutation was also observed in an US S 2aa-DEL PEDV variant (USA/Minnesota188/2014) which still caused severe disease at a conventional pig farm (Fig. 4A) . The full genome and S gene sequence identity between Minnesota/188 and prototype of US PEDV Colorado/2013 were 99.9% and 99.4%, respectively. Thus, it is likely that the 2 aadeletion alone is insufficient to cause viral attenuation. The S1 protein sequences of S INDEL PEDV and other historical PEDV strains have longer (4 aa) deletions at the corresponding position (aa 56-59) (Fig. 4A) . Recent studies by us and others showed that the US S INDEL PEDV strains have lower pathogenicity than non-S INDEL PEDV strains (Chen et al., 2016; Lin et al., 2015a) . A large deletion in S1 protein also occurred in a field PEDV strain JPN/ Tottori2/2014 (194 aa-deletion, residues 23-216 of the S protein) (Masuda et al., 2015) and US PEDV strain PC177 (197 aa-deletion, residues 34-230 of the S protein) (Oka et al., 2014) . Both PEDV Tottori2 and PC177 strains showed reduced virulence in pigs (Masuda et al., 2015) While the S1 domain of PEDV S protein is responsible for binding to cell receptors, the S2 domain is responsible for cell membrane fusion activity (Shirato et al., 2011; Zu\u00f1iga et al., 2016) . In the murine-adapted PEDV MK-p10 strain, loss of the ER retrieval signal KxHxx motif in the cytoplasmic tail of S allowed the S proteins to be efficiently transported from endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartment (ERGIC) onto the cell surface and subsequently increased fusion activity in vitro (Shirato et al., 2011) . P120 had an early termination of S protein by 9 aa (EVFEKVHVQ), including the ER retrieval motif. Similarly, P120 showed increased cell fusion activity in vitro and decreased virulence in vivo when compared with P9 and P100. In CDCD piglets, much lower fecal virus shedding titers (Table 1) , more restricted intestinal virus infection (Table 2 ) and much less intracellular PEDV N proteins (Fig. 3) were observed in P120-inoculated pigs than in pigs inoculated with the lower passages (P3, P100C4, P100C6 and P100C4 + P10) of PC22A. These results support that the infection of P120 was less extensive than the lower passages of PC22A in vivo. Similarly, a 7 aa (FEKVHVQ) deletion at the end of S protein was reported for a clinically mild Chinese non-S INDEL PEDV strain FL2013 (Zhang et al., 2015) and a Korean vaccine strain SM-98 (Fig. 4B) . These data suggest that the early termination of the S protein and the lack of ER retention signal of PEDV may be a marker for PEDV attenuation, which can be tested using reverse genetics technology.",

In addition, aa changes were also found in ORF1ab, M, ORF3 and E proteins in high passages of PC22A. However, except for one aa (L225I) in M protein, the sequences of ORF1ab, ORF3, E and N proteins of attenuated P120 and virulent P95C13 (CCL81) were the same. Therefore, it is more likely that the attenuation of P120 may not be the result of mutations in ORF1ab, ORF3, E and N genes. However, additional mutations in P160 in ORF1ab (S221T in NSP2), S (D680N, and F967L), and M (L150F) further attenuated P160 compared with P120. Also, comparative analysis of paired virulent/ attenuated strains (PC22A, 83P5, DR13, YN CV777) showed different patterns of attenuation-related mutations. Collectively, these results suggest that the complete attenuation of a PEDV strain is the result of a combination of multiple mutations along the genome, and can occur via multiple molecular mechanisms. Whether individual or a combination of genetic changes (point mutations, deletions and insertions) of PEDV strains alter viral infectivity, pathogenicity and replication efficiency can be further examined by reverse genetics technology.",

In addition, no alteration of tissue tropism was observed; 3) While P160 was highly attenuated compared to P120, P120 induced active immunity in piglets and lactogenic immunity in the sow, and provided better cross-protection against the challenge with highly virulent homologous PEDV PC21A strain than P160; and 4) The mutations found in P120 were consistently identified throughout the next 40 passages in cell cultures, suggesting genetic stability in vitro. The in vivo genetic stability will be examined in the future if P120 and/or P160 induce efficacious lactogenic immunity in sows and can protect suckling pigs from PEDV challenge.",
