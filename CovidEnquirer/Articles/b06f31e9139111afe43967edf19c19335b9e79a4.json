Surprisingly, the TM of gp210 is sufficient for sorting to the pore membrane. The CT also contains a sorting determinant, but it is weaker than that of the TM. We propose specific lateral association of the transmembrane helices of two proteins to yield either a gp210 homodimer or a heterodimer of gp210 and another protein. The cytoplasmically oriented tails of these dimers may bind cooperatively to the adjacent NPCs. In addition, we demonstrate that gp210 co-localizes with cytoplasmically dispersed nucleoporins, suggesting a cytoplasmic association of these components. T hE nuclear envelope (NE) ~ consists of three morphologically and biochemically distinct domains (for review see 9, 12) . The outer nuclear membrane domain contains bound ribosomes and is continuous with and biochemically indistinguishable from the RER. The inner nuclear membrane domain is adjacent to the nuclear lamina and the underlying chromatin, and contains a distinct set of integral membrane proteins (1, 29, 36) . Finally, the outer and inner membranes of the NE are connected with each other at numerous sites forming circular openings in the NE (nuclear pores) of \"~100 nm diam. The connecting membrane is sharply bent (180~ and is referred to as the \"pore membrane\" domain of the NE. The nuclear pore is occupied by the nuclear pore complex (NPC) and the pore membrane is adjacent to the NPC (for review see 9, 21) . The pore membrane contains at least one distinct glycoprotein, referred to as gp210 (10, 37) . This, and perhaps other yet to be identified pore membrane-specific integral proteins, may function in nuclear pore formation and in the assembly and attachment of the NPC to the pore membrane.",

Like resident integral proteins of the RER and the NE, gp210 is designed to resist bulk flow from the RER into downstream membranes of the exocytotic pathway. In addition, it is sorted specifically to the pore membrane of the NE. Retention in the ER of a number of resident integral proteins, both endogenous and viral, has been shown to be mediated by sequences in the cytoplasmically exposed domains of these proteins (13, 24, 26) . Because of its likely interaction with the NPC, the cytoplasmically exposed tail of gp210 seemed a likely candidate to be the determinant for sorting to the pore membrane. However, using various mutant forms of gp210, we found that its TM is sufficient for sorting to the pore membrane. The cytoplasmic tail (CT) serves as an additional, but weaker, sorting determinant.",

To circumvent this problem, inserts from three overlapping, partial cDNA clones, which together span this region, 50-17, 45-A1, and 47-10 07), were used to synthesize a hybrid cDNA of sufficient length to act as a template for amplification. Synthesis of this template was performed as follows. Two overlapping eDNA clones, 50-17 and 45-A1 ('~50 rig each), were cleaved with EcoRI and XhoI, respectively, to liberate two overlapping inserts. The resulting DNA fragments were combined and heat denatured at 95~ for 10 min in lx Taq polymerase buffer (Perkin-Elmer Cetus Instruments, Norwalk, CT). The denatured DNA was allowed to reanneai at 65~ for 30 rain and dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP were added to a final concentration of 0.2 mM each. The reaction temperature was raised to 72~ and 2.5 U ofTaq polymerase (Perkin Elmer Cetus Instruments) was added to fill in the fraction of DNA molecules formed by the hybridization of overlapping single-stranded inserts from 50-17 and 45-A1. The polymerization was allowed to proceed for 8 rain at 72~ The DNA from this reaction, containing the double-stranded 50-17/45-A1 hybrid, was combined with ~50 ng of EcoRI/AatlI cut 47-10 eDNA, and the denaturation, annealing, and polymerization steps repeated as above to form a 50-17/45-A1/47-10 hybrid eDNA. Although this species likely represents only a fraction of the total eDNA present in the reaction, it proved sufficient for amplification. With this template, a PCR was performed using a sense oligonucleotide encoding a 5' SalI site followed by nucleotides -12-33 (sense primer) and an antisense oligonucleotide encoding nucleotides 1,967-1,997 (antisense primer).",

If the TM and the CT (TM + CT) portions of gp210 contain the determinants for sorting to the pore membrane, the chimera CD8/ gp(TM + CT) should be localized to the pore membrane.

All of these proteins were correctly sorted to the pore membrane. Only the data for the CD8/gp(TM + CT)-20 and CD8/gp(TM + CT)-54 are shown (Fig. 5 ). Double immunofluorescence with both the anti-CD8 antibody and mAb 414 showed that the distribution of these chimeric proteins (Fig. 5 A and B) matched that of the nucleoporins (Fig. 5, C and D) . The 54-residue deletion removes nearly the entire CT leaving only four residues of the CT adjacent to the lipid bilayer. Data presented in the next section demonstrate that these four remaining residues are not sufficient for targeting to the pore membrane within the context of the CD8 TM (see Fig. 7 B) . Therefore, at most they play an accessory role in sorting. We thus conclude that the TM of gp210 is sufficient for pore membrane localization.",

This punctate nuclear rim pattern of CDS/gpCT matched the nucleoporin pattern when cells were double stained with mAb 414 (Fig. 6 A) . However, the match was less than perfect, apparently obscured by the Golgi and plasma membrane localization of CD8/gpCT. Additional support for a pore membrane localization of CD8/gpCT was provided by comparing its staining pattern with that of CD8/E19, a resident integral membrane protein of the ER (13, 24, and Fig. 6 C) . CD8/E19 is a chimeric protein where the CT of CD8 has been replaced by the CT of El9, a viral protein that is retained in the ER (30) . Although both chimeric proteins showed nuclear rim staining, only CD8/E19 additionally showed the typical ER staining pattern, indicating that the nuclear rim staining of CD8/gpCT is likely the result of locaiization to the pore membrane, rather than retention in the ER. Moreover, a deletion mutant of CD8/gpCT lacking 20 COOH-terminal residues from the CT (CD8/gpCT-20, see Fig. 1 ) is no longer localized to the pore membrane, but rather is present exclusively at the plasma membrane (Fig.  7, compare A and B) . Taken together, these data suggest that the CT of gp210 contains a determinant for sorting to the pore membrane and that this determinant might reside in its COOH-terminal 20 residues.",

After integration into the ER membrane, sorting determinants specify retention within the ER or various downstream membranes of the exo-and endocytotic pathways (3) . For the few examples of resident integral ER proteins that have so far been examined, COOH-terminal and, generally, cytoplasmically exposed regions, have been shown to be sorting determinants for their retention in the ER (13, 24, 26, 32) . In this paper we have analyzed determinants that sort gp210 to a subdomain of the ER, the pore membrane domain of the NE. As the pore membrane is continuous with the ER, sorting to this domain is likely to proceed by lateral diffusion in the plane of the membrane rather than by vesicular traffic, gp210 is a bitopic integral membrane protein with a large NH2-terminal cisternal domain (1,783 residues), a single TM, and a short COOH-terminal CT of 58 residues. The latter is topologically poised to interact with the NPC and a priori appeared to be the most likely candidate to harbor the determinant for sorting to the pore membrane. Surprisingly, we found that the TM of gp210 is sufficient for sorting to the pore membrane. Although the CT, particularly its COOH-terminal 20 residues, also contained a determinant for sorting to the pore membrane, the TM appeared to be the dominant sorting determinant. By itself, it was sufficient for sorting to the pore membrane. The ectoplasmic domain of gp210 that contributes 95% of its mass does not appear to contain determinants for sorting to the pore membrane. It appears to be retained in the ER, but our data do not rule out secretion.",

Second, although nuclear pores are doubled in $ phase (22) , mutant gp210 expression, over a period of 5 h, was assayed in unsynchronized, interphase cells.

The amino terminus (N) and the carboxy terminus (C) are indicated. Segments positioned to the left of the schematic lipid bilayer lie within the lumenal or extracellular compartments and those to the right extend into the cytosol. Amino acid residues within regions of interest are listed below each schematic diagram. Those residues that span the membrane are underlined. Regions of the constructs derived from gp210 or CD8 are distinguished graphically and by print type (gp210 ~ or CD8 m). Amino acid residues are numbered in accordance with publications describing their positions within the wild-type proteins (18, 37). The arrowheads in gp210:HA and gp210-(TM + CT):HA point to the approximate position of the HA epitope tag.",
