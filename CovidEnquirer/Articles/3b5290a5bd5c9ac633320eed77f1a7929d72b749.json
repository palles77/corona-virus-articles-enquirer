            "text": "The genus Coronavirus belongs to the family Coronaviridae in the order Nidovirales. Coronaviruses (CoVs) infect a variety of livestock, poultry, and companion animals, in which they can cause serious and often fatal respiratory, enteric, cardiovascular, and neurological diseases. 1 The first reports on human coronaviruses (HCoVs) appeared in the mid-1960s. The human viruses were isolated from persons with the common cold, and two species were detected: HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43. 2 Almost 40 years later, an emergent HCoV was identified as the causative agent of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 3 While SARS-CoV was eradicated from the human population after a highly effective global public health response, 4 its emergence necessitated a rethinking of the role that CoVs play as a potential cause of more than just the common cold. Thereafter, there was an increase in research on HCoVs worldwide, which has led to the discovery of two other HCoVs, HCoV-NL63 in the Netherlands and HCoV-HKU1 in China. 5, 6 Reports have documented that HCoVs are involved in a wide spectrum of clinical presentation in upper and lower respiratory tract illnesses, [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] as well as being a contributor to exacerbations of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease 16 and among patients presenting cystic fibrosis. 17 The involvement of other non-respiratory organ systems is still controversial but can occur, for example the enteric and nervous systems. 18, 19 Additionally, the role of HCoV infections among susceptible groups, outbreaks, and fatal cases has been documented. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] However, the majority of reports describe HCoV infections only among children. Moreover, longitudinal studies of CoV epidemiology in the literature are lacking and are restricted to descriptions spanning 1-3 years at most. [26] [27] [28] In this study, we conducted a comprehensive 9-year study of the epidemiological and clinical features of all four circulating HCoVs (OC43, 229E, HKU1, and NL63) among four different subsets (asymptomatic, general community, with comorbidities, and hospitalized) of adult and child patients.",

The clinical specimens from the studied patients were collected from specific units by trained professionals (nurses or doctors). The specimens comprised 464 nasopharyngeal swabs, 208 nasal aspirations, and 465 nasal lavages. The subjects were 50 asymptomatic adults and 1087 patients presenting acute respiratory infections (ARIs): 465 from the general community (adults, children, and healthcare workers), 410 with comorbidities (children with heart diseases, patients with stem cell and renal transplants), and 212 hospitalized patients (adults and children) originally suspected of H1N1 2009 influenza infection. Of the 1137 studied patients, 591 (51.9%) were adults, while the rest were children. The patients were treated at the primary care health service section of S\u00e3o Paulo Federal University/S\u00e3o Paulo University Hospital in ambulatory or specific units and the emergency room. Each of these specific health services had a variable flow of sampling to respiratory viruses diagnoses, which resulted in collections of different patient groups in this study. Hence, the subjects groups were unevenly distributed throughout the study. The distribution of the studied years and clinical specimens by studied patients is shown in Table 1 .",

Age, gender, occupation, presence of underlying conditions or diseases, and clinical findings at first attendance (for outpatients) or during the first 24 hours (for hospitalized patients) were recorded for analysis. The number of days between admission and a positive CoV sampling, as well as the total length of respiratory illness, was evaluated for evidence of nosocomial acquisition. Institutional review board approval was received before we reviewed any records. The Ethics Committee of S\u00e3o Paulo Federal University (CEP 1968/09) approved this study, and written Pan-CoV RT-PCR one-step assay Viral genomic RNA was extracted from the collected specimens with a QIAamp Viral RNA extraction kit (Qiagen, Valencia, CA, USA) according to the manufacturer's instructions. A previously described pan-CoV RT-PCR assay 29 with minor modifications (from 50 amplification cycles to 40 and melting temperature from 48 to 50\u00b0C) was performed as a screening step to detect human and animal CoVs in the samples. The amplification of a 251-bp fragment of the polymerase gene was carried out using the following primer set: Cor-FW (5\u2032-ACWCARHTVAAYYTNAARTAYGC-3\u2032) and Cor-RV (5\u2032-TCRCAYTTDGGRTARTCCCA-3\u2032). These one-step RT-PCR assays (OneStep RT-PCR kit; Qiagen) were undertaken in a 50-ll reaction volume containing 10 ll RNA extract, 10 ll 5 9 Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR Buffer, 2 lL dNTP mix (final concentration of 400 lM of each dNTP), 1.8 ll Qiagen OneStep RT-PCR Enzyme Mix (a combination of Omniscript and Sensiscript reverse transcriptase and HotStarTaq DNA polymerase), 4 lM of each primer, and RNase-free water. Positive and negative controls were included in each PCR experiment. The reaction was carried out with an initial reverse transcription step at 50\u00b0C for 30 minutes, followed by PCR activation at 95\u00b0C for 15 minutes, 40 cycles of amplification (30 seconds at 94\u00b0C; 30 seconds at 50\u00b0C; 1 minutes at 72\u00b0C), and a final extension step at 72\u00b0C for 10 minutes in a Veriti thermal cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, CA, USA). PCR products were verified on an agarose gel, stained with ethidium bromide, and visualized under UV light. The sensitivity of the assay was assessed by testing 10-fold dilutions of HCoV-NL63 RNA standard curve, which showed sensitivity of 5 9 10 5 RNA copies/ll. The specificity was assessed by testing controls of other respiratory viruses (rhinovirus, bocavirus, human parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3, influenza A and B, metapneumovirus, adenovirus, and respiratory syncytial virus) through the methods for HCoVs detection. There was no amplification of the non-HCoV controls through the method used for CoVs detection.",

Reaction mixtures were prepared using the AgPath-ID TM One-Step RT-PCR Kit (Applied Biosystems). Reactions (25 ll) contained 2 9 RT-PCR buffer, 25 9 RT-PCR enzyme mix, primers, probe, nuclease-free water, and nucleic acid. Amplification was performed on a 7500 Standard Real-Time PCR System (Applied Biosystems) with the following cycling conditions: 48\u00b0C for 10 minutes (1 cycle); 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes (1 cycle); and 95\u00b0C for 15 seconds followed by 55\u00b0C for 1 minutes (45 cycles) . Each specimen was also tested for the human ribonuclease P gene to measure nucleic acid integrity. 30 The sensitivity of the assay was assessed by testing 10-fold dilutions of each HCoVs RNA standard curve, which showed sensitivity of 5 9 10 2 copies/ll for HCoV-OC43, 5 9 10 4 copies/ll for HCoV-229E, 5 9 10 3 copies/ll for HCoV-NL63, and 5 9 10 3 copies/ll for HCoV-HKU1.

An important CoV detection rate was found among the subset of patients with comorbidities, being most frequent in children with heart diseases and in renal transplant patients. Additionally, underlying conditions other than cardiac disease/transplantation were observed in 18% of CoVinfected patients. These data point to the relevance of CoVs causing respiratory tract illness in patients with comorbidities. Some reports have demonstrated a correlation between CoV-induced respiratory tract illness and populations with comorbidities. 22, [35] [36] [37] In spite of there being a lower HCoV detection rate in the hospitalized subset, the majority of positive cases presented with lower respiratory tract infections, and one fatal case was documented.

Recently, Dijkman et al. 41 demonstrated that HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 may elicit immunity that protects from subsequent HCoV-HKU1 and HCoV-229E infection, respectively, which would explain why HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-NL63 are the most frequently infecting HCoVs. Other studies have demonstrated a higher frequency of HCoV-NL63 among children 12, 32, 42 and HCoV-OC43 among adults. 43 Although it is possible to verify the periodicity of HCoVs infection in the presented data of this study, that is, HCoV-HKU1 (Figure 2 ), our study focuses on HCoV-type specificity frequency in particular patient groups. In this regard, HCoV-229E was mainly associated with renal transplant patients and HCoV-NL63 was involved in a death. HCoV-229E has previously been associated with infections in immunocompromised individuals, 37, 44 and some reports have demonstrated the further association of HCoV-NL63 with fatal cases. [22] [23] [24] However, there are no consistent indications that infection by one HCoV is more pathogenic than that with another. Thus, our data provide evidence that the detection and diagnosis of HCoV infections should be considered for immunocompromised individuals with respiratory tract symptoms.",

The climate of the city of Sao Paulo (Southeast of Brazil) is under constant influence of both the southern coast and the northern part of the state, which presents a subtropical climate. Thus, this city has an uncharacterized climate marked by a wide thermal and meteorological variety. In this regard, it is not possible for us to trace any interaction between climatic and meteorological factors and HCoVs detection. However, due to the long-term HCoV surveillance performed in the present study, it was possible to demonstrate particular trends concerning CoV species seasonality, where different marked peaks of detection were observed for each HCoV species during the 9-year study. Other studies have demonstrated differences between CoV species seasonalities and a winter preference. van der Hoek et al. 45 performed a study on HCoV-NL63 revealing that this species infection follows a 2-year interepidemic period with peaks of infection in the winters. Gaunt et al. 28 in a study carried out over a period of 3 years in the UK demonstrated a high detection of HCoVs species during winter months.",
