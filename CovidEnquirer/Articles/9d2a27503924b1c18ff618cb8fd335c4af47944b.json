The quick succession of developmental phases is associated with a rapid change of commonly encountered diseases to which the diagnostic approach has to be tailored. The perinatal puppy or kitten is commonly worked up as an abortion with a simplified gross examination and emphasis on histopathology and microbiological testing. In contrast, animals older than 1 day of age require a thorough and complete necropsy because gross findings determine the menu of additional tests to be performed. Before weaning, health concerns extend to littermates, the dam, and often the breeding program in general. After weaning, the problem is usually viewed as that of an individual animal and rarely of the household.",

Postmortem examinations provide essential information for preventative strategies and should be pursued aggressively.

Postmortem examinations are also an important part of quality assurance and quality control programs of veterinary clinics and provide great opportunities for continued education when faced with the unexpected or unexplained death of a patient or a patient's death despite diagnosis-based treatment. Postmortem examinations address the owner's concern about littermates and other pets in the household, the future of the breeding program, and the owner's health.

            "text": "A postmortem examination is actually a series of examinations. The gross examination during the necropsy of the animal is followed by the microscopic examination of fixed tissues (histopathology). Often additional tests on fresh tissues like microbiology (bacteriology, virology, parasitology, mycology, and serology) and/or toxicology (chemical analysis of tissues for toxins, minerals, and heavy metals) are necessary to determine the specific etiology of an identified disease process. These additional tests can be requested at time of necropsy, or samples may be collected and saved for testing at a later time, for example, when histopathology results are available and allow a focused approach to further testing to minimize expenses. diseases are the most common primary issues identified on postmortem examination, followed by malnutrition. In kittens, 50% of neonatal mortalities are the result of stillbirth (incidence of 4.3% to 10.1%), and an additional 25% occur in kittens less than 1 week of age. Approximately 15% of all litters have at least one kitten with one or more congenital anomalies (nearly 10% of kittens born alive). Based on histopathological examination, more than half of the kitten deaths up to 4 months of age are caused by infectious diseases, with the majority having a viral etiology. Before weaning, feline herpesvirus 1 and feline calicivirus are the main causes; after weaning, it is feline parvovirus followed by feline infectious peritonitis (corona)virus.

In a retrospective study on kitten losses during the first 4 months of life, this apparent failure to identify a specific cause was significantly associated with submission of tissue samples instead of the entire animal to the diagnostic laboratory for postmortem diagnostics. This underlines the fact that a thorough gross examination and collection of a complete set of samples for histopathology and microbiology are imperative to successful postmortem diagnostics. Gross lesions may be subtle and can be easily missed by an inexperienced examiner. This may result in collection of incomplete sample sets, which in turn will limit the spectrum of available diagnostic tests.",

The remains should be immediately refrigerated at 39\u00b0 F (4\u00b0 C). Freezing before collection of samples for histopathology will cause severe artifacts as a result of disruption of the microanatomy by formation of ice crystals and should therefore be avoided.

Hollow organs like the stomach, intestines, and urinary bladder are opened up to expose the mucosa to the fixative. Hollow organs with a diameter of less than 3 mm, like the intestines of neonatal patients or ureters, can be gently filled with",
