This period has witnessed a gradual shift from a \"hazards-based approach\" to food safety (i.e., mere presence of a hazard in a food was deemed unsafe) to a \"risk-based approach\" (determination whether exposure to a hazard has a meaningful impact on public health). Standard methods of analysis help in confirming that a food system is controlling a specific hazard. Through the selection of analytical method, sampling plan, and frequency of testing, a risk-based decision is introduced. Analysis of collected information is another challenge. Traditionally, food safety systems look at the individual steps along food chain, treating each step in isolation from others. However, as the systems become more complex, interactions and synergies between components become increasingly important and decrease utility of simple analyses of individual steps. When a high level of complexity is reached, impact of individual steps cannot be analyzed without considering the entire system.",

Hazard identification may have already been carried out to a sufficient level during risk profiling; this generally is the case for risks due to chemical hazards. For microbial hazards, the risk profile may have identified specific risk factors associated with different strains of pathogens, and subsequent risk assessment may focus on particular subtypes.

During hazard characterization, risk assessors describe the nature and extent of the adverse health effects known to be associated with specific hazard. A dose-response relationship is established between different levels of exposure to hazard in food at the point of consumption and likelihood of different adverse health effects. Dose-response assessment is the determination of relationship between magnitude of exposure (dose) to a chemical, biological, or physical agent and severity and/or frequency of associated adverse health effects (response).

Although it was first introduced by US Food and Drug Administration for the purpose of regulating food additives, NOAEL/SF-UF procedure is now widely used for other potentially toxic substances also. A key feature of NOAEL/SF-UF procedure is that at no point does it yield a quantitative prediction of harm. NOAEL/ SF-UF procedure is intended to establish safety.

Carrington and Bolger (2000) have observed that ADI concept is flawed because in practice, the ADI is viewed as an \"acceptable\" level of exposure, and, by inference, any exposure greater than ADI is seen as \"unacceptable.\" ADI was the basis for a regulation on food additives. It was used to calculate how much of the additive could be added to food, with acceptance of the agency as a matter of policy.

Evaluation of risk management options which involves weighing of available options for managing a food safety issue in the light of scientific information on risks and other factors, and may include reaching a decision on an appropriate level of consumer protection. Optimization of food control measures in terms of their efficiency, effectiveness, technological feasibility and practicality at selected points throughout the food chain is an important goal. A cost-benefit analysis could be performed at this stage. 3. Implementation of risk management decision will usually involve regulatory food safety measures like using HACCP. Flexibility in choice of individual measures applied by industry is a desirable element, as long as overall program can be objectively shown to achieve stated goals. Ongoing verification of application of food safety measures is essential. 4. Monitoring and review is gathering and analyzing of data so as to give an overview of food safety and consumer health. Monitoring of contaminants in food and FBD surveillance should identify new food safety problems as they emerge.
