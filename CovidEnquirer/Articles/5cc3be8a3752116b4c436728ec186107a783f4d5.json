The empirical findings using the Korean airline panel data for the period 2006e2010 suggest that competition leads to less differentiated departure flight times as expected from spatial competition theory. Unlike the previous study on the U.S airline industry, the degree of this tendency for less differentiation differs across the type of routes: the Jeju island routes (leisure type) and the inland routes (business type), in the deregulated period. Following the May 2008 Deregulation Act we find an increasingly clustered pattern of airline scheduling in the Jeju island routes where there have been competitive pressures associated with new low cost entrants. This recent evidence would imply that airline carriers strategically schedule departure flight times and allocate flights between routes as competition increases in the deregulated period.",

Even though the growth of the airline industry slowed down worldwide over the past few years, the largest LCCs, such as Southwest in the United States, have continued to grow rapidly while new smaller LCCs have collapsed. These have different product and market strategies than the traditional full service legacy carriers. Established legacy carriers, on the other hand, have responded to entry of LCC competitors by diversifying their strategies to compete for the short-haul flights market as well.",

Previously, many empirical papers assessed the effects of the U.S. Airline Deregulation Act of 1978 on travelers and carriers while there have been no such studies focused on the effects of deregulation of the Korean airline industry. 2 Morrison and Winston (1986) analyzed that changes in the route structures contributed greatly to the success of the deregulation of 1978 because development of hub-and-spoke route structures increased departure frequencies. Empirical studies of the U.S. deregulation have found hub-and-spoke effects to be important. The longest flight in Korean domestic routes, however, only takes about 65 min for jet airplanes and either less than or equal to 90 min for turboprop airplanes). Given that a hub-and-spoke system is not the optimal air transport network strategy for Korean domestic short-haul routes, the implications based on the U.S. airline deregulation cannot be directly applied to the point-to-point route structure in Korea.",

            "text": "Before 2005, the Korean domestic airline markets were characterized by duopolies: two legacy carriers, Korean Air (KAL) and Asiana Air (AAR) were the only carriers in each domestic city pair market. Since the May 2008 Deregulation Act, the Korean airline industry has undergone significant changes. The competition of the markets long dominated by the two legacy carriers has increased since the deregulation as new low cost carriers(LCCs) entered a few of these markets at ticket prices of about 70 or 80 percent of the prices being charged by the legacy carriers. The two incumbents have developed new business strategies in response to the entry of LCCs in the deregulation period. The legacy carriers, KAL and AAR, rebadged and entered a few of their own markets with LCC operations either replacing their prior service or flying under both legacy carrier brand and LCC brand for some city pair routes. It is worth investigating how the two-brand strategy by legacy carriers affects intensity of competition on a route in the deregulated Korean airline market with short-haul domestic routes. During 2006 During , 2010 , the entry of LCCs was limited to the routes either flying to Jeju island or having the two largest metropolitan areas e Seoul and Busan e as an end point city. Due to the lack of entry to inland routes for the two years following the May 2008 Deregulation Act, deregulation is expected to have an asymmetric effect depending on the type of markets. Thus, it is interesting to examine the effects of the deregulation policy on the domestic Korean city pair markets through the intensity of competition; how deregulation affected departure flight times scheduling patterns. And second, whether there are different responses in scheduling patterns following deregulation for the type of markets: the Jeju island routes (assumed to be primarily the leisure route) and the inland routes (assumed to be primarily the business route).",

On the other hand, international air passenger traffic has been increasing since the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) epidemic had a severe negative effect on Asian air travel markets in 2002e2003 and the economic crisis swept across the nation in the late 1990s. 3 While two legacy carriers, KAL and AAR, target international routes instead of pursing relatively low profits in domestic routes following the introduction of high-speed rail services, Korean Train eXpress (KTX), in 2004, LCCs have emerged and entered some domestic city pair markets in 2005, the first independent LCC, Hansung Airlines (HAN) received its Air Operator's Certificate (AOC). LCCs in Korea can be categorized into two types from the view point of ownership; independent LCCs and dependent LCCs. First, independent LCCs refer to LCCs that are not owned by full service legacy carriers. 4 Second, dependent LCCs refer to LCCs that are wholly-owned LCC subsidiaries of legacy carriers. 5 In response to the emergence of the independent LCCs the two full service carriers established their own subsidiary LCCs, either replacing their prior services with them or flying under both legacy carrier brand and LCC brand. AAR replaced its service on some routes with its own LCC, Air Busan (ABL), and KAL operated under two-brand strategy through its subsidiary LCC, Jin Air (JNA).",

The independent LCCs have shown considerable growth rate of market share, recording an 8. 3% in 2008, 13.1% in 2009, an 18.3% in 2010, and 25 .6% in 2011.

In 2011 adopt the LCC model, the major barriers are regulated regimes in Korean air industry. Prior to May 2008 Korean airline regulation had restrictive licensing policies. This regulation system categorized airline carrier into two types: scheduled air service carriers and non-scheduled air service carriers. While non-scheduled air service carriers were only allowed to operate irregular flight services with aircraft, each having less than 80 seats, scheduled air service carriers could operate regular flight services with a license issued by a government aviation body. These restrictions on non-scheduled air service carriers, combined with irregular flights service, greatly limited their aircraft availability and selection (turboprop aircraft with less than 80 seats). Since 2005 a few independent LCCs had flown some city pair routes, but most of these were non-scheduled air service carriers subject to regulated market policy. In this context the \"licensing policy\" hindered prospective entrants from settling in the market (Tables 1 and 2) .",

Several LCCs (including both dependent and independent LCCs) have been established over the last four years. The remaining independent LCCs were restructured by expanding their capacities. 8 Beyond the supply side perspective of the impact of LCCs' entry on Korean airline markets, \"a five-day work week\" was introduced for Korea. The National Assembly cleared a legislative bill to amend the Labor Standard Act (LSA) on August 2003. This amended LSA introduced a five-day work week by reducing the maximum legal working hours from 44 to 40 per week, and the law was passed by the South Korean parliament in 2004. 9 After gradually establishing \"a 5-day work week\" system since 2005 (South Korean companies of all sizes became required to switch to the five-day work week in 2011), people's leisure activities have changed greatly. A five day work week system, combined with emergence of new LCCs in the deregulated period, has prompted more people to fly and changed market structure.",

In Hotelling's linear city model with linear transport cost, each of duopolists differentiate their products in only one dimension, geographic location. Firms are located at the same point (minimal differentiation, i.e., perfect substitutes). Given the assumption of a quadratic transport costs, D' Apremont et al. (1979) show that duopolists with a single outlet locate at opposite ends of the linear markets. An example of the study of the circle model of spatial competition is Martinez-Giralt and Neven (1988) . They developed spatial competition models allowing for competition from multiple outlets. In the circle model of spatial competition with duopolists, in equilibrium each firm positions its two outlets at the same point. As summarized in Borenstein and Netz (1999) , theoretical models of spatial product differentiation suggest two possible polar cases regarding location competition outcomes: minimal differentiation in order to steal customers from rivals, and maximal differentiation in order to soften price competition with competitors.",

With differentiated products, competition has both price and non-price dimensions. Airline carriers choose not only prices, but also flight frequency and flight departure times. Spatial competition theory has been applied to airline studies such that airlines compete on departure times where the departure times of flights on a route can be interpreted as locations on a 24-h clock and the air traveler's preferred departure times are non-uniformly distributed, i.e., heterogeneous consumer's preferences. One of the studies in the airline industry literature related to departure flights scheduling competition is Borenstein and Netz (1999) . In this study, passenger's transport costs are assumed to be quadratically related to departure flight times in minutes. They empirically test the relationship between the level of competition and spatial product differentiation using cross-sectional U.S airline 1975 (when fares were regulated) and 1986 (when fares were not regulated) data, respectively for a given number of flights on a route. According to their findings, airlines schedule their flights more closely to each other as competition increases for both periods. They also find that reductions in scheduling constraints increase differentiation in departure times after deregulation. Yetiskul and Kanafani (2010) also test location theory using cross-sectional U.S. airline 2005 data. They find that intense competition leads to less departure time differentiation. This tendency is lower in the presence of low cost carriers on a route. Salvanes, et al., (2005) empirically examine departure time differentiation in the Norwegian airline industry. When price is exogenous, they find evidence that an increase in competition on a route leads to a decrease in departure time differentiation.",

On the other hand, carriers might increase departure time differentiation in order to soften price competition in the presence of potential intensive price competition. Deregulation in the Korean airline industry concentrated on eliminating regulatory barriers to entry, but did not lead to a huge reduction in the average fares due to unexpectedly introduced fuel surcharges on all domestic city-pair routes. With this small variations in fares within carriers, carriers would have engaged in nonprice dimension competition. It is therefore of interest to investigate whether the pattern for scheduling departure flight times has changed since the 2008 Deregulation Act, and if so, the estimated effects differ depending on the types of routes: the Jeju island routes (leisure type) and the inland routes (business type).",

The average value for the competition level increased from 2.465 in the pre-deregulated period to 2.959 for COMP1 (2.696 for COMP2 in the post-deregulated period), which is a significant rise in the airline industry competition.

The difference between the average values for LCCsh1 and LCCsh2, about 9 per cent, represents the flight shares scheduled by the legacy carriers' subsidiary LCCs. These huge gaps between the two measures could be attributed to the two legacy carriers' intense multiproduct activity through their own subsidiary LCCs operation in the postderegulation.

The coefficient estimate for LLoadFac is negative in all specifications and statistically significant. This could be seen to underline the fact that carriers would schedule their flight times closely Tables A1eA4 for detailed  information. 18 According to the Cragg-Donald F-test for the two potentially endogenous variables, LRelFare and LLoadFac, there is no statistical evidence to reject the null hypothesis that the instruments are weak. One possible explanation for this failure is due to a poor fit of the first stage regression for the LLoadFac. The Cragg-Donald Ftest, however, for multiple endogenous variables does not specify the source of failure to reject the null hypothesis. There may be a few strong instruments and many weak ones, resulting in a combined set of instruments that is weak. Weak instruments may be generating undesirable biases in point estimation results, but the OLS estimation results and the IV results are not substantially different for each of the models. One may not need to examine this more closely because the primary coefficient of interest, on LCOMP1 (LCOMP2), is insensitive to the model specifications.",

The effects of the deregulation policy, however, are ambiguous. In order to disentangle the effect of deregulation on airline scheduling, we investigate two types of markets separately. These two types of markets, which are city pairs for flying to and from Jeju island and inland city pairs, differ in both types of travelers and in alternatives to air transportation. Due to the lack of entry to inland routes for the two years following the May 2008 Deregulation Act, deregulation is expected to have an asymmetric effect depending on the type of routes. Thus, it is interesting to examine the effects of the deregulation policy on the domestic Korean city pair routes through the intensity of competition; how deregulation affected departure flight times scheduling patterns across the type of routes.",

From comparison of the magnitude of these coefficients, an inference would seem to be that the two legacy carriers' responding strategy with their own subsidiary LCCs to the entry of new independent LCCs lowers the degree of competition in the Jeju island routes. The impacts of Deregulation on the degree of departure time differentiation are all negative and robust across models, implying a less differentiated departure flight times scheduling pattern in the deregulated period.

Due to the lack of the entry of the independent LCCs to inland routes during 2006e2010, the analysis using COMP2, LCCsh2 is not applicable to the inland routes. The estimates of two models of departure flight times differentiation are presented in Table 8 ; we attempt to fit a regression to pooled data from 6 inland non-stop routes. 20 The estimated impacts of both LCOMP1 and LCOMP2 are negative, implying that competition leads to a less differentiated scheduling pattern with regard to departure times. Unlike the Jeju island routes, the coefficient estimates of Deregulation are all positive and statistically significant for the inland routes. The results suggest that for the inland routes the degree of this tendency for less product differentiation is relatively weak when compared with the Jeju island routes in the post-deregulated period. In other words, the larger gaps among departure flight times were found in the deregulated period than in the regulated period. The reason why deregulation is estimated to have route type-specific effects can be due to the fact that the Jeju island routes (leisure type routes) recorded high volumes of passenger traffic relative to the inland routes (business type routes). The Korean airline industry deregulation has led to substantial traffic growth, carrying more passengers at lower fares. In particular, competition among the two legacy carriers and independent LCCs for the Jeju island routes has intensified due to the dominance of air transportation for travel to and from Jeju island, the country's largest island and tourist's destination. Along with the demand-driven motivation, fuel costs and capacity constraints also provide an incentive for a carrier to schedule more frequent flights, which are concentrated into the route of high demand, in a more strongly clustered pattern as opposed to less frequent flights for the low demand routes, resulting an asymmetric pattern of clustered departure flight times across the type of routes in the deregulated period. We see that its interaction effect with competition level is negative and statistically significant. The more competitive route is, the weaker the positive impact of Deregulation on departure flight times differentiation.",

The most striking finding of this study is that the degree of this tendency for less product differentiation differs across the type of routes. The changed competition conditions, which culminated with the implementation of the May 2008 Deregulation Act, contributed to route-type specific consequences: the Jeju island routes (leisure type) and the inland routes (business type). We find a strongly clustered pattern of airline scheduling in the Jeju island routes where there have been competitive pressures associated with new low cost entrants. On the other hand, due to the lack of entry to inland routes, we find partial support for the clustered pattern of airline scheduling. The two legacy carriers' subsidiary LCCs operation leads to less dominant pattern of clustered flight, lowering the competition level. Consistent with the fact that the longest flight only takes about an hour and time zone change effect is irrelevant in the Korean domestic routes, carriers have a greater incentive to schedule strategically in the absence of capacity constraints. There was greater product differentiation on routes with lower profitability, which reduces the incentive to schedule flight times closer to each other's flights, drawing passengers off from the nearby flights.
