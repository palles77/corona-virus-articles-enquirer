We evaluated whether cycle threshold (C t ) values (which are inversely related to virus load) were associated with clinical severity in patients from Saudi Arabia whose nasopharyngeal specimens tested positive for this virus by real-time reverse transcription PCR. Among 102 patients, median C t of 31.0 for the upstream of the E gene target for 41 (40%) patients who died was significantly lower than the median of 33.0 for 61 survivors (p = 0.0087). In multivariable regression analyses, risk factors for death were age >60 years, underlying illness, and decreasing C t . Results were similar for a composite severe outcome (death and/or intensive care unit admission). More data are needed to determine whether modulation of virus load by therapeutic agents affects clinical outcomes.",

This finding is derived from a large number of MERS-CoV patients from KSA during the upsurge in cases during spring 2014, when MERS-CoV was diagnosed in patients with a spectrum of clinical illness (17) . Our findings did not change when we adjusted for other risk factors for severe outcome and potential confounders. Although the exact pathophysiology of MERS-CoV infection in the lung is still unknown, more virions could lead to worse lung damage either by direct destruction of respiratory epithelial cells or by triggering a more vigorous inflammatory response (21) . In severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus infections, a similar association was observed between worse outcome and higher virus load, as measured in nasopharyngeal, serum, and fecal samples (22) . Why some patients have higher MERS-CoV virus load is unclear. Virus load might be related to the inoculum size at the time of infection; anecdotally, primary MERS-CoV infections, which are probably more likely to be acquired from environmental exposure (e.g., camels) than from person-to-person spread, tend to have worse outcomes, even among younger patients, although this factor could reflect other risks or case ascertainment bias (23, 24) . Virus load might also be related to host factors, such as the immune response to the virus, which in turn could be affected by intrinsic factors, such as the presence of underlying illness or host genetics.",

A previous study from KSA showed that median C t values were lower for MERS-CoV from tracheal aspirate and bronchoaveolar lavage samples than for nasopharyngeal swab samples, presumably reflecting higher virus load in the lower respiratory tract (20) . Moreover, lower respiratory tract samples, including expectorated sputum, are positive for MERS-CoV when upper respiratory tract samples were negative (26, 27) . We observed similar findings with bronchoalveolar lavage and sputum yielding higher virus load than nasopharyngeal specimens, although this could have reflected that these specimens were only available from sicker patients or been due to chance with so few bronchoalveolar or sputum specimens.",

The clinical implication of measuring virus load in upper respiratory tract specimens for MERS-CoV is not clear because the virus load probably reflects virus replication in the nasopharyngeal epithelial cells. We assumed that virus load in the upper respiratory tract correlated with that in the lung, although this assumption is not known definitively. By limiting the analysis to virus load among bronchoalveolar lavage specimens, we would have been able to more directly compare virus load in the lung with clinical severity; however, too few of these specimens were available to conduct this analysis.",

The strongest risk factors were being elderly and having an underlying illness. Although several studies have shown underlying illness to be common among MERS-CoV patients, including those who died, few have quantified the risk for underlying illness in severe outcomes (5, 8, 28) . We showed that the presence of underlying illness elevated the odds of severe outcome or death by 7-8-fold. The higher risk for severe outcomes earlier in the course of the Jeddah outbreak probably was due to the increase in contact tracing as the outbreak progressed in Jeddah, leading to detection of a greater spectrum of clinical MERS-CoV disease later in the outbreak.",

Without reference to a known standard curve for each real-time RT-PCR run, we were not able to assign specific virus load thresholds to severity categories. Run-to-run variability could have existed in C t -virus load relationships, although the extraction method, real-time RT-PCR, and equipment remained the same throughout this period in the Jeddah Regional Laboratory. If real-time RT-PCR is 100% efficient, a 1-unit change in C t indicates an \u22482-fold difference in concentration of virus copies, although such conditions are rarely met in real-world practice (12) . C t values have been used in other reports as an indicator of MERS-CoV virus load (20) . Second, specimens were collected from multiple hospitals and the home setting for asymptomatic contacts. This could have led to variability in quality of the specimens, and/or handling and shipping practices in getting specimens to the Jeddah Regional Laboratory. However, unless systematic differences were present by site in terms of the severity of illness affecting specimen collection, this variability should have been nondifferential and biased the findings toward the null. Moreover, we observed no difference in the median C t across hospitals. Third, data for other outcomes indicative of severity of illness were either missing in some patients (e.g., days since onset, length of hospital stay) or not available at all in the current dataset (e.g., mechanical ventilation, oxygen requirements). Fourth, some patients initially identified by the MOH as asymptomatic and not hospitalized did not have medical records for review, and data were collected by phone for these patients; some of these patients were unable to be contacted and so we could not verify the initial data from the MOH, leading to potential misclassification for some variables. Finally, without systematically sampling and testing sequential specimens in the same patient during the course of illness, we are unable to determine the temporal sequence in the association between virus load and outcome, i.e., we cannot determine whether higher virus load causally leads to severe outcomes Although we present evidence for an epidemiologic association between virus load and severity of MERS-CoV illness, the clinical implications of our findings are unclear. At this time, MERS-CoV has no known treatment, other than supportive care. Several approaches to treatment, including antiviral drugs and immunotherapy are being investigated (29) . More data are needed on whether modulation of virus load by therapeutic agents can affect clinical outcomes. ",
