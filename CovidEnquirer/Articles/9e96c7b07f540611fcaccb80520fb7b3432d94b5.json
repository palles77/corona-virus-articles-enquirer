            "text": "During the past decade several notable viruses have suddenly emerged from obscurity or anonymity to become serious global health threats, provoking concern regarding their sustained epidemic transmission in immunologically naive human populations. With each new threat comes the call for rapid vaccine development. Indeed, vaccines are considered a critical component of disease prevention for emerging viral infections because, in many cases, other medical options are limited or non-existent, or that infections result in such a rapid clinical deterioration that the effectiveness of therapeutics is limited. While classic approaches to vaccine development are still amenable to emerging viruses, the application of molecular techniques in virology has profoundly influenced our understanding of virus biology, and vaccination methods based on replicating, attenuated and non-replicating virus vector approaches have become useful vaccine platforms. Together with a growing understanding of viral disease emergence, a range of vaccine strategies and international commitment to underpin development, vaccine intervention for new and emerging viruses may become a possibility.",

            "text": "Nevertheless, infectious diseases still pose one of the greatest threats to public health, and the past three decades have brought a constant barrage of new human pathogens. More than 70% of these infections are zoonotic [1, 2] , entering either directly from wildlife reservoirs or indirectly via an intermediate domestic animal host [1, 3] . HIV, avian influenza, Hendra (HeV) and Nipah (NiV) viruses, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), Ebola and Marburg filoviruses, Lassa virus (LASV), Rift Valley fever virus (RVFV) and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever (CCHF) viruses are all examples of zoonoses currently emerging from wildlife. All these emerging zoonoses present a serious and increasing threat to health, biosecurity and economies worldwide. The mechanisms underlying disease transmission from animals to humans are becoming better understood [4] with the emergence of pathogens from wildlife (which represents the greatest threat to global health) occurring in a non-uniform pattern, being localized to distinct geographic 'hotspots' in Africa, Asia and South America, and with each high-threat pathogen being weighted towards a key wildlife species (e.g. bats, rodents or non-human primates (NHPs). It is clear that such diseases will continue to place a substantial burden on global health, especially in dense human populations where the pressures on environmental and economic resources are greatest. More than one billion cases of human zoonotic disease are estimated to occur annually, and emerging zoonoses result in enormous economic losses [5] . Increased urbanization, international travel, commerce and climate change increase the likelihood that emerging zoonosis will continue, if not worsen, in the future. When a zoonotic virus spills over into a susceptible new species, it often has the advantage that the new host has little or no pre-existing immunity, enabling attachment, entry and replication of the virus in receptive cells. The amplified virus may then evade clearance by host defences for long enough to be transmitted to another susceptible host, and the lack of herd immunity will result in a rapid dissemination of the virus, leading to disease in more virulent cases of infection. Each step in the process represents an opportunity for vaccineinduced immunity and, through such intervention, transmitters and susceptible hosts are removed from a population by the pre-emptive development of protective immunity, so that the spread of infection becomes less likely. Vaccination is therefore a powerful strategy for preventing and controlling emerging zoonotic infectious disease. The development of vaccines for such emerging infections, however, needs to contend with several key challenges associated with such viruses. An emerging infection may be a recently discovered virus and the result of a rare outbreak for which basic biological information such as correlates of protection, antigenic variability or immunodominance are unknown. There may be a lack of time to develop an appropriate animal model of disease in which to study viral immunology and evaluate vaccine candidates for preclinical assessment of protective efficacy and safety. Additionally, many emerging viruses have high case fatality rates, spread easily and cannot be treated. These characteristics mandate that all experimental investigations with such infectious material be carried out at high levels of bio-safety, such as BioSafety levels 3 or 4. For such pathogens the availability of resource-heavy laboratory infrastructure is a bottleneck to basic research. Moreover, the often standard vaccine approach of using attenuated strains or inactivated viral vaccines is not always a feasible option, because of the possibility of reversion to virulence or the requirement for large-scale culture and production in high containment facilities. In addition to these significant hurdles, the economic cost of novel human vaccine development for rare pathogens, which are unlikely to provide an effective payback on investment, has been a major impediment to progress. Thus, basic research into many emerging pathogens has been neglected for years.",

This strategy has been used for the prototype arenavirus lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) [27] ; the study showed attenuation in an otherwise fatal mouse model of LCM disease and the ability to induce protective immunity. Together with a maintained and robust ability to multiply in cell culture, this live attenuated approach may be suitable for similar viruses.

Historically, MVA was developed by serial tissue culture passage in primary chicken cells of vaccinia virus strain Ankara, and clinically used to avoid the undesirable side effects of conventional vaccinia vaccines [31, 32] . Adapted to growth in avian cells, MVA does not replicate in mammalian hosts and lacks many of the viral immune evasion genes [33] . The features of MVA, such as its capacity to accommodate large gene inserts [34] , thermostability for application in remote regions without an established cold chain [35] , ease of inexpensive manufacture to GMP standards and established regulatory package for development as an Investigational New Drug, make the recombinant MVA platform [36] highly versatile as a heterologous viral vector. In the context of emerging infections, the recombinant MVA platform has shown encouraging preclinical efficacy against Ebola, Zika, Chikungunya [37] and CCHF [38] viruses. Additionally, MVA elicits a strong immunological response against a range of other orthopoxviruses (OPXVs) (including Variola), and vaccines based on this platform can be considered as providing added value, as human immunity to OPXVs is low (after the cessation of the smallpox vaccination campaign) opening a gap for OPXV emergence, as evidenced by the recent occurrence of monkeypox virus in West Africa and onward cross boarder transmissions [39, 40] .",

Driven by autonomous RNA replication, RNA replicons result in high-level, cytosolic expression of recombinant heterologous antigens stimulating both the humoral and cellular arms of the immune system. Replicon vaccine approaches have closely followed technical developments to genetically manipulate viral genomes. For RNA viruses, replicons based on positive-stranded picornaviruses were some of the first [41] , and these were followed by those based on alphaviruses [42] and negative-strand RNA viruses [43] . While a series of different vaccine replicon systems are available, new capabilities with negative-strand viruses have opened up opportunities against a wider range of emerging viruses. Recent developments [44] include the construction of LASV replicons packaged into LASV-like particles which allow a single round of replication and are able to confer protection against an otherwise lethal challenge of LASV in a guinea pig model of disease [44] . While recombinant replicons are devoid of the viral glycoprotein gene, its incorporation into VLPs is achieved by the use of a cell line that expresses the glycoprotein separately (in trans). This enables the scalable propagation of replicon particles in a way that aims to combine the safety of replicon-delivered LASV antigens with the convenience of simply and rapidly producing an attenuated virus. Similar replicon approaches have been used to develop promising replicon-based vaccine candidates for Ebola virus [45] and RVFV [46] .",

Recently, bioinformatics tools have been developed to identify putative CD4 + T cell epitopes, mapped to the surface glycoproteins of the emerging viruses LASV, NipV and Hendra [62] . While these vaccine candidates still need to be experimentally tested, the approach represents an interesting and novel strategy that shows promise for vaccination and which could also address immunity in particular target populations.",

The long history of this approach is underpinned by a well-defined regulatory framework that can be readily applied to new disease targets [65] . The major challenge for the inactivated virus approach is that infection is not established, and therefore a full adaptive immune response is generally not achieved. However, because of the absence of living pathogens, these types of vaccines are safe and a basic capability to prepare such vaccines, especially for emergency use, might be worthwhile as a stop-gap while alternative longer-term approaches are developed. In this regard, studies of virus inactivation with X-ray radiation (as a simple and cheap alternative to gamma irradiation by the use of radioactive isotopes), which maintain the tertiary antigenic structures of virus particles while destroying infectivity, have shown useful promise for a range of applications including vaccination (B. Afrough, unpublished).",

However, many vaccine candidates for emerging diseases have failed to make it into clinical development. This is perhaps surprising, given the breadth of vaccine technology available and the nature of many of the diseases in question. A case in point is Lassa fever, a viral haemorrhagic illness endemic to many parts of West Africa responsible for more than 300 000 cases of serious disease and approximately 3000 deaths each year since its discovery more than 50 years ago. It is often in the headlines, being the most commonly exported VHF to other territories, including the United Kingdom, which has received a disproportionate share of traveller-related cases (each incident placing substantial burden on public health resources). During 2018, LASV caused an unusually large increase in cases in Nigeria, which led the WHO to classify it as a grade 2 public health emergency. However, despite the high burden of Lassa fever and public attention, no vaccines have so far been approved. Multiple approaches to develop a range of effective preclinical candidates have been made during the last three decades, including attenuated vaccines [66] , replication competent vaccines, [67] [68] [69] , non-replicating LASV vaccines [47] , a rationally designed live attenuated vaccine [70] and DNA vaccines [71] .

Thus, bringing a LASV vaccine and, by analogy, other potential vaccines for emerging diseases to the clinic, may be very difficult -for non-technical reasons. Although there is renewed interest from multiple international agencies to develop human vaccines for certain emerging pathogens [74, 75] , it is prudent to consider other approaches to the control of emerging disease, including the feasibility of controlling infections at source.",

This makes the task of identifying, controlling and preventing zoonoses a difficult and daunting goal, particularly when a new emerging pathogen may be completely unknown. While surveillance is an essential component of a successful control programme, effective containment of an emerging pathogen, before epizootics have the opportunity to spill over into human populations, has been achieved most effectively by large-scale culling or mass vaccination [76, 77] of animals. Nevertheless, the ability to contain even known emerging viruses such as Ebola virus in wildlife is currently not possible. Furthermore, the management of diseases that involve livestock, such as RVF and CCHF, pose problems [78, 79] in that conventional vaccines are not suited for use in these environments. A major limitation of conventional vaccination is the requirement for individual inoculation of each animal -a costly and impractical strategy for the target/reservoir species of those animals frequently involved in the emergence of high-risk pathogens [1] .",

In this way, vaccination of a limited number of initiator animals is used for the introduction of the vaccine into a target population.

This approach used an engineered cytomegalovirus (CMV) vector (which causes a benign but transmissible infection in the host), expressing the SNV envelope glycoprotein G1 [83] . A similar approach is also being developed to interrupt zoonotic transmission of Ebola virus [84] , in this case disseminating CMV vaccines specific to great apes and expressing EBOV antigens are being studied in African ape populations in the wild [85] . Interestingly, one of the goals of this work is to protect the great apes themselves from Ebola virus disease, a major threat to the survival of these animals in the wild. Also, as 163 VACCINES FOR EMERGING PATHOGENS: FROM RESEARCH TO THE CLINIC. PART 1 approximately 30% of human Ebola virus outbreaks are known to have resulted from the direct handling of infected ape carcasses, the disseminating CMV-based strategy may be significant in protecting humans [86] . Clearly, further work needs to be conducted to assess the risks of live transmissible vaccines evolving into a pathogen with increased virulence. Engineering such wild-life reservoir vaccines to be weakly transmitting, such that their reproduction number is below 1 (R 0 < 1), making their transmission chains short so that they cannot be maintained, might be a way to address the justifiable safety risks.

There is already good evidence [1, 5] that zoonotic pathogens will most probably be transmitted from a few key animal species in resource-poor areas of the world. Based on recent history, it is probable that such pathogens have never been seen before. The global impact of the West African outbreak of Ebola virus in 2014 underlines how stark differences in health-care infrastructure can impact upon human-to-human transmission of emerging pathogens. Until basic health-care infrastructure in all countries can be raised to a level that enables early identification and control of high-risk pathogens at source, we will continue to respond to outbreaks of emerging disease long after epizootics have spilled over into human populations. Innovative strategies are therefore urgently required to control such pathogens, vaccination is a proven approach.",

The use of well-defined vaccine vector platforms, with an extensive record of safety and efficacy against similar pathogens, can expedite the process of development, validation and production (Table 1) . Accordingly, the design and licensure for particular platform vaccine technologies will help to accelerate the development of new vaccines, as only the simple substitution of a new antigen gene into the vector platform is required. This allows manufacturers to move to a new target disease with minimal changes in chemistry, manufacturing and controls. Thus, new vaccine development can focus on the safety and efficacy of the inserted gene. In addition, the ability of platforms to target multiple pathogens helps to justify the investment required to build and maintain manufacturing infrastructure that specializes in one platform, because a single manufacturing facility can be ready to produce multiple vaccines at any time.",

Replication competent but attenuated virus vectors (RHS) deliver heterologous antigen targets resulting in the induction of cellular and humoral responses. Their complement of genes enables a full round of replication and assembly of progeny virus which can amplify and spread the vaccine effect to susceptible cells. While these platforms are based on highly attenuated viral backgrounds, replication competence may lead to the development of mutations and reversion to virulence. Replication defective vectors (LHS) support effective cellular entry and a single round of expression of the target gene / antigen; they result in effective induction of cellular and humoral responses. They are unable to generate new infectious progeny and are considered safer than replication competent vectors.",
