            "text": "Investor interest in analyzing hedge fund governance has gained steam in recent years. In large part, this is due to an increased focus on due diligence factors not purely related to a fund's investments. This type of analysis is commonly referred to as operational due diligence (ODD). We have introduced the concept of ODD earlier in this book. For reference, ODD typically refers to a review of the noninvestment-related risks inherent in hedge fund investing. This book, however, is not about ODD, so why are we talking about the subject to begin with? Well, as we have also mentioned in previous chapters, analyzing hedge fund governance typically falls within the purview of ODD reviews.",

            "text": "This does not mean, by the way, that if you are an ultra-high-net-worth investor, family office, or even midsized hedge fund allocator without a dedicated ODD department, you should stop reading. Instead, rather than having a dedicated person or group review governance, you probably should incorporate a review of governance-related factors into your existing review process that covers these non-purely investment-related items. In fact, by incorporating a review of those governance factors more closely aligned to your overall due diligence process, you are actually more likely to be better positioned than some larger, well-heeled allocators with more resources. This is because governance, while generally thought to be primarily focused on operational issues, also involves the investment-related aspects of a fund's portfolio. We will highlight some of these issues in this chapter. This is not to say that by having ODD groups coordinate governance reviews, we are missing something. Rather it is to imply that, because governance is an area that cuts across both the investment and operational aspects of a firm, ODD groups should be engaged with investment personnel in analyzing governance. By taking a review approach that classifies different pieces of information into silos, a less than complete assessment of governance can often result. As an aside, this is also true when reviewing the operational risks in place at a hedge fund. Even though certain issues are primarily operational in nature, engaging in discussions with investment due diligence personnel, or considering both issues side-by-side in smaller allocators that do not have dedicated ODD groups, often leads to a more informed assessment of risks. So where should investors begin in seeking to analyze fund governance? As we have noted earlier in this text, as investors have sought to analyze fund governance, many have fallen into the mindset that analyzing governance simply requires focusing squarely on fund boards and their directors. There has been growing acceptance, however, that hedge fund governance constitutes more than just the fund directors. If you've been reading the chapters of this book in order, hopefully we have convinced you of this by now and shown that governance includes every different aspect of the hedge fund life cycle including regulators, service providers, and, of course, the hedge funds themselves. This doesn't mean investors should ignore the directors when seeking to evaluate governance, but, clearly, they need to consider other factors as well.",

            "text": "At this point you might be thinking to yourself, \"If governance is so similar to ODD, then can't I just conduct an ODD review and call it a day?\" That's certainly a fair question. What if we were to rephrase it a bit? Said another way, does a fund with strong internal operational controls (i.e., low operational risk in certain areas) automatically have strong governance (i.e., low governance risk)? The crux of both questions is the same: does low operational risk equal good governance? Certainly, as we've outlined earlier in the book, the two areas are not identically equivalent, but aren't they similar enough, and with sufficient overlap in both areas? After all, based on the sometimes difficult to pin down definition of governance in practice, isn't it impractical to attempt to tease governance out of ODD reviews? Such a question, however, may frame the issue incorrectly. Governance is perhaps best thought of as an overlay to operational risk rather than being contained within it. As the focus of this chapter is on practical application of governance analysis at hedge funds, let's return to the original question of whether an ODD review is sufficient to cover governance.",

That is, it is in line with the majority of the practices in the market. We're simply not looking for average here; we want the best practice governance. Well then, it must be the one with the most oversight. That is the fund that not only uses a third-party administrator in line with normal market practice but also goes beyond this by shadowing the work of the administrator internally. More oversight and more controls imply better governance. All done? Not quite. First, one issue we didn't address was the operational strength of each hedge fund in our example.",

Or alternatively, the situation could be reversed and the selfadministered fund may have much weaker operations as compared with the third-party-administered fund. We are by no means attempting to espouse the benefits of self-administration. On the contrary, as we have outlined above, selfadministration rationally implies poor governance.

Yes, there are traditionally correlations between strong operational practices and good governance. Such relationships, however, are backward looking in nature. They also present a dangerous precedent that may lead many investors down the wrong path. While some comfort may be taken that strong operations imply good governance, such implications are by no means iron clad. As we have suggested throughout this book, it is the responsibility of investors, or those who manage capital on their behalf, to conduct detailed due diligence assessments of managers. All hedge funds are not created equal. The unique particularities of each fund's operations and governance frameworks must be analyzed before an assessment may be made. Without such detailed reviews there is a real danger of thoroughly investigating one aspect of the relationship, such as fund operations, and failing to analyze the remaining aspects under consideration (i.e., fund governance).",

By this we mean that certain operational practices that were considered common at one time are no longer, in large part, considered acceptable. The classic example of this is hedge fund administration. In the early days of the hedge fund industry, it was not uncommon for a hedge fund to conduct their own administration (i.e., self-administer). In fact, there were only a handful of funds that utilized third-party administrators. Fast forward to today, and the situation is completely reversed with the majority of hedge funds using third-party administrators. In certain cases, hedge funds have taken to using double administration models, where effectively one administrator checks the work of another. One widely reported use of such a model was the case of a large hedge fund named Bridgewater Associates, LP who hired one administrator, Northern Trust, to independently replicate and back up certain middle-and back-office services provided by existing administrator BNY Mellon (Clancy, 2013) .",

Only by learning the facts of each relationship and governance practice can you make any sort of informed assessment of the situation. The point of this single versus double administrator example is to show that, like the definition of best practice operations, the definition of governance is a moving target that evolves over time. In Chapter 12 we will outline some industry trends and comment on future progressions in this area. In the meantime, let's turn our focus back on the discussion of how investors can go about assessing governance.

In practice, some may consider some of these recommendations to be rote didactic lecturing and may not be fully practical for every investor or fund. On the other hand, such assessments can often contain useful guidance for investors both big and small, with different parts of the recommendations being applicable in different ways. For example, let us consider the issue of separately managed accounts. It is generally thought that separately managed accounts offer increased transparency and investor control as compared with pooled funds. Therefore, some may consider them to be more beneficial from a governance perspective and certainly preferred to pooled vehicles. From the perspective of a hedge fund, it is more operationally intensive, and therefore expensive, for hedge funds to offer separately managed accounts. That is why most hedge funds require large Primary area of governance concern Subarea of governance concern Related issues CalPERS governance recommendations/ requirements minimum subscription levels for such accounts at levels that are typically drastically above the subscription minimums required for investments into pooled vehicles that are already up and running. The reasons for increased expense are, as noted above, the same reasons that many investors would ideally prefer such accounts from a governance perspective. That is, their segregation, and often enhanced investor oversight and involvement, comes at the price of having to run what is sometimes referred to as a fund of one. In some cases, this includes dealing with investor-designated service providers such as custodians, which may be different than those that the hedge fund manager deals with for their other vehicles. There are of course the expenses associated with other standard operational procedures to account for, the separate account trades such as execution, settlement, and reconciliation. The fund also has to produce separate investor reports and statements for the fund.",

Second, as an investor, you also have the right to have the hedge fund listen to your feedback and expect reasonable process changes to be made along a reasonable timeline. We will address this in more detail below. Third, it is naive to think that institutional investors are necessary conducting adequate due diligence in all areas. While not usual, it is certainly not unheard of for mistakes to be found in the audited financial statements of funds that larger investors, and the funds themselves, didn't notice.

Sometimes some of the largest funds are the ones that are the last bastions of inertia, clinging to antiquated practices and technology. A good example of this is a speech from the 1991 movie, which was based on a play, called Other People's Money. A character in that movie, Larry the Liquidator, is a corporate raider seeking to convince the shareholders of a company, New England Cable and Wireless, about the dangers of holding on too tightly to old practices. The character cites the following example: \"You know, at one time there must've been dozens of companies making buggy whips. And I'll bet the last company around was the one that made the best goddamn buggy whip you ever saw. Now how would you have liked to have been a stockholder in that company?\" And it makes a good point. The world changes and sometimes hedge funds have to overcome their stubbornness and adapt.

While such recommendations by institutional investors such as CalPERS, one of the former largest hedge fund investors in the world, have likely done much to advance the cause of better governance for all, CalPERS itself has had some governance failures over the years. These include reports that Kurt Silberstein, one of the authors of the above-referenced governance memo, was forced to forfeit 10% of his salary for six months and was placed on brief administrative leave as a result of alleged revelations that CalPERS had been using two outside advisors, UBS and Paamco, without a contract for several years (Harper and Lifsher, 2009) . Perhaps more famous were allegations of improprieties related to the use of placement agents. In particular were allegations that CalPERS CEO, Federico R. Buenrostro, and his friend, a former Los Angeles Deputy Mayor and CalPERS board member, were involved in a conspiracy that resulted in millions of dollars in placement that were inappropriately earned and not appropriately disclosed (U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission, 2012). I'm sure that pensioners who have been victims of such poor governance practices would likely have some governance prescriptions for investors such as CalPERS as well. This is not to single out CalPERS by any means, but rather to demonstrate that sometimes it is important for investors to practice what they preach and institute governance best practices not just at the funds in which they invest but also at their own organizations.

The point of this line of thinking is not to give these funds a free pass, but rather to acknowledge the practicalities of the situations. In many cases, it is not economical for funds to implement certain governance protocols. In other cases, the governance oversight changes that may be considered applicable from a universal best practice approach aren't expensive to implement but they are simply not appropriate for a firm of smaller sizes.

Similarly, taking a skeptical perspective, we could consider, for example, a fund that, for whatever reason, did indeed have accurate information in the financials (i.e., the liabilities figure on the balance sheet was indeed the correct liabilities amount for the fund); however, perhaps they prepared these figures themselves and used fake documentation to imply they were audited. If you don't believe that someone would go to such lengths to manufacture false documents to hide impropriety, consider the case of fraudster Marc Dreier, which included the use of such fraudulent statements (Wesier, 2009 ).

Backup generators are different from UPSs in that they actually have the ability to generate power for an extended period of time. Emergency backup generators come in multiple types including natural gas, gasoline, and diesel powered. Generators must be sized to meet anticipated demands and must be capable of starting automatically when needed unless on-site personnel are capable of operating the units. Regardless of the type and size of generator employed, a preventive maintenance program needs to be implemented to ensure the unit will function properly when needed. Additionally, standby generators need to be run under load several times throughout the year to ensure that the equipment will function reliably when needed. It is important to ensure that the generator has an appropriate supply of relatively fresh and contaminant-free fuel in its tank and provisions to refill the tank as needed during a long-duration power outage need to be in place before the event. Depending on their location, a fund manager may have a dedicated generator or one that is shared with multiple tenants in the same office building. Large generators, which may need to generate power for periods of multiple days, certainly require a significant investment of capital and ongoing maintenance expense from a fund manager.

Such an analysis can also be augmented by combining the information garnered during a hardware review with reviews of related governance mechanisms such as a hedge fund's IT planning committee.",

We covered a wide variety of topics ranging from approaches taken by institutional investors in this area to conducting analysis of fund directors. We also provided a number of examples of governance considerations when analyzing specific hedge fund issues such as fund expense analysis, BCP/DR planning, and IT analysis. As we noted above, the items covered in this chapter were by no means meant to be a comprehensive list of all the governance-related factors investor can analyze during due diligence. On the contrary, we only scratched the surface in this chapter. As we outlined earlier in this chapter, for the purposes of facilitating an investor's analysis of governancerelated factors, we framed our analysis of governance as an overlay on top of the analysis of operational and investment risk factors. This type of analysis framework represents the interconnected nature of governance. By leveraging off the operational and investment-related due diligence reviews, investors can conduct more comprehensive governance reviews of funds with a focus on transparency, oversight, and controls. This focus on governance will typically not only enhance the other aspects of an investor's due diligence process but produce an overall more detailed picture of the risk landscape of funds under review.",
