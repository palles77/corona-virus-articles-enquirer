This chapter extends the theme and addresses diverse patterns of viral infections that are determined by both the virus and the host. Thus, virulence or susceptibility depends upon the specific virus-host combination. This is particularly true in the case of persistent infections, which involve a delicate balance between virus and host. We will focus first on virus virulence and host susceptibility, and then turn to the complex variables that govern persistent infections. Chapters 4-6, on innate, adaptive, and aberrant immunity, and Chapters 11-15, on systems biology approaches, also provide important insights into the patterns of infection.",

Furthermore, understanding the subtleties of viral virulence has important practical implications, since avirulent or attenuated variants of a virus are often used as live vaccines; examples are those for smallpox, poliomyelitis, measles, and yellow fever. The virulence phenotype depends upon many variables, including the viral strain; the route of infection; the viral inoculum; and the species, age, and genetic susceptibility of the host.

Alternatively, different clones may spread by different routes, one clone producing viremia whereas another spreads by the neural route. In some instances, viral clones will vary in the innate or acquired immune responses that they induce, or in their susceptibility to antibody or to cellular immune defenses.

It was found that pathogenicity would change during the course of multiple passages, and this adventitious finding was exploited to obtain viruses of different pathogenicity. In general, during repeated animal-to-animal transmission, a virus adapts in order to replicate optimally under the conditions of passage. Yellow fever, a flavivirus, produces fatal hepatitis in monkeys; if passaged intracerebrally in mice, it will become highly neurovirulent for mice, but will lose its ability to cause hepatitis in monkeys. However in nature, where viruses have adapted to specific hosts, virulence may vary from high (rabies in raccoons or foxes, smallpox in humans) to low (SARS coronavirus in bats, rhinoviruses in humans). Similarly, complex experimental passage of a strain of simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) led to a neurovirulent strain that is less capable of causing immunodeficiency, but can be used to study neurovirulence when co-inoculated with an immunodeficiency causing virus.",

Genetic changes that can be deliberately introduced include point mutations that alter function of individual proteins, or inactivation of nonessential viral genes by introduction of stop codons or deletions of substantial gene segments. Relevant methods are described in Chapters 11-13. For instance, HIV has four accessory genes-Nef, Vif, Vpu, Vpr-that are not essential for replication in most cell cultures. SIV strains lacking one or more of these genes are attenuated when used to infect rhesus macaques, compared to their parental counterparts. In fact, it was hoped that an HIV strain lacking the Nef gene might be used as an attenuated viral vaccine in humans. A group of patients infected with a naturally Nef-deleted strain of HIV remained healthy, absent antiretroviral treatment for many years but eventually developed AIDS, ending this approach to a vaccine; the Nef-deleted HIV strain was attenuated but still too dangerous to use in humans. Another pertinent example is the H5N1 strain of influenza virus that had produced a high mortality among a few poultry farmers in China. To investigate the potential transmissibility (and therefore the virulence for the human population) of H5N1 virus, two research groups independently conducted controversial \"gain-of-function\" experiments. As a surrogate for human subjects, both investigative teams used ferrets. Although ferrets could be infected intranasally with wild-type H5N1 virus, they did not transmit infection to other ferrets housed in close proximity. However, when the researchers introduced a few mutations and performed animal-to-animal passages, they obtained virus mutants that were transmissible by aerosols. Recent genetic analyses have suggested that there are at least three transmissibility determinants in this H5N1 virus: basic amino acids adjacent to the cleavage site in the viral hemagglutinin; amino acid 627 in PB2, one of the viral polymerase molecules; and a short sequence in the NS1 protein that may influence interferon or other host responses.",

As a result, clone 13 initiates a persistent infection without acute illness.

Many viruses can replicate productively without causing cell death, and a number of them can cause persistent infections. In such instances, the initial dynamics resemble those of an acute infection, following which the virus titer decreases somewhat but then reaches a set point that may be maintained indefinitely or gradually decline. Examples of this pattern are hepatitis B virus (HBV), HIV, and LCMV of mice. Immune tolerance and persistent infection with nonlytic viruses. A virus that persists at a high level has to escape an effective immune response that would control the infection. Therefore, high-titer virus persistence is often accompanied by immune \"tolerance,\" an apparent absence of a virus-specific adaptive immunity. The mechanisms by which tolerance can be induced include deletion of \"forbidden\" clones of na\u00efve T lymphocytes in the thymus, or exhaustion of peripheral virus-specific T lymphocytes in the presence of excess antigen (see Chapter 6, Aberrant Immunity). Tolerance may be limited to specific components of the effector limb of the immune response.

The immune response to lentiviruses is quite effective, as judged by its ability to rapidly contain the acute phase of infection, resulting in a reduction from peak viremia at about 6 weeks to a set point about 1000-fold lower at about 3-6 months. Once this set point is reached, a dynamic equilibrium is established between virus production and clearance. The plasma half-life of individual SIV virions is <30 min in the absence of immunity and about 10 min in infected animals with an established immune response.

This phenomenon is probably operative in subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE), a progressive fatal neurological disease (discussed in more detail below). In SSPE, a defective variant of measles or rubella virus spreads gradually from neuron to neuron in spite of extraordinarily high titers of neutralizing antibody in the extracellular fluid of the brain parenchyma.",

However as indicated previously, SSPE is a rare complication of measles (\u223c1 case per 100,000 primary infections) that occurs unpredictably in apparently normal children following uneventful recovery from acute measles. Several years after measles, these children develop a progressive encephalitis that is invariably fatal in 6-12 months. Measles antigens can be detected in either biopsy or postmortem brain, and electron microscopy reveals measles nucleocapsids in neurons and glial cells in the brain. SSPE variant viruses exhibit underexpression or defects in one or more viral proteins; these mutations inhibit budding and the production of free-infectious virions. In this example, escape from immune surveillance is associated with the selection of variant viruses that lose the ability to mature and bud properly while maintaining the gene functions for replication of the viral nucleocapsid. The incomplete virus core can still be transmitted from cell to cell, and is slowly cytocidal, leading to the clinical progressive and ultimately fatal encephalitis.",

Infection of adults is often a self-limited acute process, with clearance of the virus usually accompanied by hepatitis.

The infected infant has high levels of circulating HBsAg and serum HBV DNA. Anti-HBs (viral surface antigen) or anti-HBe (precore antigen) antibodies cannot be detected in the serum of infected infants but anti-HBc (viral core antigen) antibodies are present, a state sometimes called \"split tolerance.\" Persistence is associated with high dose cellular tolerance against HBsAg, with only minimal levels of HBsspecific CD8+ T cells due to the deletion or exhaustion of antigen-specific T lymphocytes.

Attenuated variants often exhibit host range or temperature-sensitive phenotypes, and may provide candidates for live virus vaccines. The attenuated phenotype can be manifested at any step during the course of infection, from invasion, to spread, involvement of target organs, or shedding. Virulence or attenuation can be mapped to specific viral genes and individual nucleotides, and may be associated with one or many viral genes, including noncoding sequences.

(1) Persistence of the virus-usually a noncytocidal agent-at high titer in various tissues, often associated with immune tolerance due to deletion or exhaustion of antigen-specific T lymphocytes.

Persistent infections may be asymptomatic but often are associated with a wide variety of chronic diseases. As we will see in the following chapter, some persistent viral infections can also lead to cancer. Most such HBV infections begin as an immunotolerant process with high virus titers and a minimal cellular immune response, which may last for decades to a lifetime. However, for reasons that are not known, the infection may shift into one of three other modes, a low replicative phase, an immunoactive phase, or a high replicative phase.
