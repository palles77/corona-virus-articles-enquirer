This review covers recent advances in neuropathology, immunogenetics, neuroimmunology, and neurovirology that have provided insights regard ing its pathogenesis. Three hypotheses are discussed: (1) autoimmunity, (2) \"bystander\" demyelination, and (3) immune destruction of persistently infected oligodendrocytes. A paradigm for induction of primary demyelination is proposed in which immune cells recognize \"foreign\" antigens on the surface of oligodendrocytes in the context of major histocompatibility complex gene products. The final result of this scheme may be \"dying-back gliopathy,\" the alteration being noted first in the most distal extension of the oligodendrocyte-that is, the myelin sheaths.",

During the early evolution of the plaque, perivascular inflammatory cells (lymphocytes, plasma cells, macrophages) invade the substance of the white matter and are thought to play a critical role in myelin destruction.",

            "text": "Recent experiments have analyzed antigens of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) in the brains of patients with MS. 8 The MHC is a set of closely linked genes that play a central role in the control of immune responses to self and foreign antigens. This function is of particular importance because CD4 + and CD8 + T cells recognize foreign antigen in the context of class II (HLA-DR, la) or class I (HLA-ABC) MHC gene products, respectively. The class II gene products, found primarily on macrophages and B cells, are important in presentation of antigen to T cells. Class I gene products are on the majority of cells in the body and are important in the generation of the cytotoxic response against viruses. The central nervous system is unique because MHC antigens normally are not present on neurons and glial cells. 8 In MS, however, class I and class II MHC-positive astrocytes are found with high fre quency in active lesions. The class I-reactive glia are primarily associated with T-cell infiltrates, whereas class II-reactive astrocytes are found in many lesions, independently of the composition of inflammatory cells. Thus, class I and II MHC-positive astrocytes might play a role in local antigen presentation to T cells. In addition, the simultaneous presence of high numbers of class I MHC-positive astrocytes and CD8 + cells in acute lesions suggests the possibility that CD8 + cells play a role as cytotoxic T cells during early development of the lesion.",

            "text": "Diseases that have been linked to the HLA complex have numerous similar features, including chronic course, inflammatory component, and weak genetic predisposition that does not obey mendelian genetics. One theory is that these disorders may have an autoimmune basis. The development of experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis (EAE) as an animal model of MS has prompted investigation of the au toimmune basis of human demyelinating diseases. 16 EAE can be induced by injection of central nervous system myelin or its components along with adjuvants. From the EAE model has evolved the concept that the primary target in MS may be myelin and not the oligodendrocyte. 17 In addition, the disease can be transferred to naive animals with cells enriched for T lymphocytes reactive to the basic protein component of myelin. 1719 Therefore, attempts have been made to determine whether an immune response to normal myelin develops in patients with MS. To date, efforts to measure such a response in patients with MS have failed even though these responses can be detected in patients with postinfectious encephalomyelitis. 20 Although certain immunologic abnormalities have been reported in MS, many of the findings are still controversial. 21 CD8 + lymphocytes apparently are decreased in the blood of patients with active MS and in those with a progressive course, 22-26 a situation that leads to a relative increase in the CD4/CD8 ratio. Disease activity is not always associated with these Tcell changes, however. The data on T-cell subsets in the cerebrospinal fluid are more discordant. 26 28 Some investigators have reported a corresponding decrease in CD8 + cells in the cerebrospinal fluid, 28 whereas others have found no change. 26,27 Some investigators have argued that the loss of CD8 + cells from the blood represents a disorder of immunoregulation. 22 Others have suggested that the imbalance is the result of preferential sequestration of CD8 + cells in the central nervous system or lymphoid organs. 25 Recent experiments suggest a decrease in the suppressor/inducer subset (CD4 + , 2H4 + ) in serum of patients with progressive MS. 29 These suppressor/ inducer cells are not found in the cerebrospinal fluid, an indication that the loss of such cells is not due to migration into the central nervous system. Suppres sor T-cell function is also defective during active disease, as measured by concanavalin A-induced Tcell suppression 3031 or by polyclonal IgG stimulation of peripheral blood mononuclear cells by pokeweed mitogen. 32 Natural killer cell activity against tumor or virally infected targets may be decreased in MS, 33 but these results have not been confirmed. 3435",

            "text": "Attempts to identify a single infectious agent as the cause of MS have been unsuccessful thus far. 36 Many infectious agents have been isolated in cultures of specimens from patients with MS, but the majority represent contaminants or noncausal agents. In addition, direct inoculation of brain material into primates, so successful in identifying a transferable agent in Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, has been nega tive or inconclusive. The more sensitive technique of looking for \"footprints\" of virus infection in brain tissue by nucleic acid hybridization with radiolabeled DNA probes or RNA probes (riboprobes) complemen tary to viral genomes has suggested that some brains of subjects with MS harbor measles virus. 37 The finding of measles virus genome in several control subjects without MS, however, suggested that viruses may reside in the nervous system without causing disease. 37 Analysis of the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with MS shows increased IgG levels along with oligoclonal Ig bands. 3840 Attempts to identify the antigen to which the IgG is directed have been unsuccessful. 40 In serum samples from patients with MS, titers of anti body to measles virus are increased. 4041 In many patients with MS, however, antibody titers to two or more viruses are increased in the cerebrospinal fluid. In diseases that are known to be caused by a virus (subacute sclerosing panencephalitis [measles] and mumps meningitis), IgG and oligoclonal bands in the cerebrospinal fluid are directed almost exclusively against the infectious agent. 4243 Because this is not the case with MS, some investigators have suggested that, in MS, the IgG in the central nervous system is \"nonsense antibody\" that represents a dysfunction in immune regulation. The alternative hypothesis is that the humoral immune response is to an unrecog nized infectious agent that is the cause of MS.",

            "text": "An important impetus to continuation of the search for a viral cause for MS has come from study of several naturally occurring model diseases in animals in which viruses cause demyehnation. 47 These diseases include canine distemper virus (paramyxovirus) in dogs, 48 visna virus (nononcogenic retrovirus) in sheep, 49 JHM virus (coronavirus) in mice 50 and rats, 51 Semliki Forest virus (togavirus) in mice, 52 and Theiler's virus (picornavirus) in mice. 53 The mechanisms of the demyehnation in these viral models are beginning to be understood. For example, in JHM virus infection in mice the demyehnation seems to be the result of direct cytopathic injury of oligodendrocytes, the myelin-producing cells. 50 In contrast, in rats the demyehnation by JHM may be a consequence of autoimmune mechanisms by which sensitized T cells recognize myelin antigens. 51 In visna virus, macrophages that are persistently infected are actively in volved in the demyelinating process. 53 With infection by Theiler's virus, viral antigens have been detected on the inner and outer glial loops of oligodendrocytes such that an immune response seems to be directed against viral or \"novel\" antigens on the surface of these glial cells. 5456 These experiments emphasize that viruses from different \"families\" may induce primary demyelination, probably by unique mecha nisms. 44 The recent discovery, in Japan 67 and in the Carib bean, 58 that chronic progressive myelopathy may be the result of persistent infection with human T-lymphotropic virus type I (HTLV-I) has stimulated specu lation that viruses may be implicated in MS. Koprowski and associates 59 reported that serum and spinal fluid samples from patients with MS in Sweden and in Key West, Florida, contained antibodies reactive with viral protein (p24) of HTLV-I. Others have failed to detect any antibody to HTLV-I, II, or III in pa tients with MS. 6061 In Japan, however, investigators 62 found that 11 of 46 patients with MS reacted to purified HTLV-I proteins by Western blot analysis. The discrepancies in the results may be due to differ ences in sensitivity of various methods. Recently, Reddy and associates 63 amplified and molecularly cloned HTLV-I sequences from DNA of lymphocytes from patients with MS. Confirmation of these results by other investigators will be necessary before a firm statement can be made about its role in pathogenesis.",

As a result of T-cell activa tion, lymphokines and macrophages could mediate myelin destruction. 3 This hypothesis is supported by elegant experi ments, using EAE, that demonstrated that T-cell clones (CD4 + ) sensitized to myelin proteins can medi ate demyelination in the central nervous system. 1819 In addition, the linkage of the disease with class II MHC gene products (DR2) is further evidence that this mechanism may be important. A series of crucial experiments by Hafler and associates 20 on T-cell clones isolated from the cerebrospinal fluid of patients with MS, however, failed to identify a single clone that was reactive for myelin antigens despite the ongoing demyelination.

The scenario would be that viruses or other infectious agents frequently invade the central ner vous system.

If multiple exogenous agents are able to induce this pathologic process, however, then identi fying the offending agent may prove to be difficult.

Alternatively, attempts to inter fere specifically with various arms of the immune response by use of monoclonal antibody therapy may be beneficial without the requirement of knowing the causative agent. The scheme proposed in Figure 1 may provide the basis for designing specific immunotherapy to interfere with demyelination. Fig. 1 . Hypothesis by which immune cells injure persistently infected oligodendrocytes and produce primary demyelination. During the course of viral infections of the central nervous system, specific viruses in \"susceptible\" patients may not be cleared by the immune system. Viruses may then persist in oligodendrocytes (myelin-producing cells) and injure these cells either by direct effects or by becoming targets of immune-mediated destruction. Oligodendrocytes infected by virus may express viral antigen (V), processed viral antigen (P), or novel antigens (AD on their surfaces. Immunoglobulins secreted by B cells may be directed at viral or novel antigens and thus result in injury to oligodendrocytes by complement, antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity, or receptor-mediated phagocytosis by macrophages. Processed viral antigens (peptides) may be expressed on surface of oligodendro cytes and be presented to CD4* cells in context of class II major histocompatibility complex (MHC) antigens (la antigens). These CD4* cells (class II-restricted cytotoxic T cells or \"helper\" T cells) could directly injure oligodendrocytes or help B cells. Novel virusinduced antigens may be expressed on surface of oligodendrocytes and be seen in context of class I MHC antigens by CD8* cells (cytotoxic T cells). These CD8* cells may injure oligodendrocytes in an effort to clear viral infection or by interacting with normal host proteins. The final consequence of these mechanisms would be injury to the oligodendrocyte. The initial pathologic process could be in the inner and outer glial loops of myelin-producing cells such that destruction of myelin would occur before visible struc tural damage to the oligodendrocyte (\"dying-back gliopathy\"). This process would result in primary demyelination. Therapeutic strategies to deplete B cells, CD4 + cells, or CD8* cells and to \"downregulate\" expression of class I or class II MHC gene products may prove beneficial.",
