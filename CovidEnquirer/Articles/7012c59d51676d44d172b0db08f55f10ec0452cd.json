Method: Sixty-four sputum samples collected from 46 adult patients were included in the study: 33 samples were collected during exacerbation of CF, and 31 during the stable phase. After extraction, nucleic acids were tested for the presence of respiratory viruses. When rhinovirus (HRV) was detected, the 5 UTR and VP4/2 regions were sequenced, and phylogenetically analyzed. The characteristics of patients in exacerbation and stable phase were compared. Results: Viruses were found in 25% of samples. The HRV viruses were the most frequently detected followed by coronaviruses. Only the HRV detection was significantly associated with the occurrence of CF pulmonary exacerbation (p < 0.027). Characterization of 5 UTR and VP4/2 regions of the HRV genome specified that HRV-A, -B, -C were detected. All HRV-C were recombinant HRV-Ca. Conclusions: HRV were the most frequently detected viruses; their detection was significantly associated with the occurrence of an exacerbation. The reality of viral recombination between HRV was demonstrated in CF patients for the first time, raising the role of viruses in lung microbiota. Further studies are now warranted to decipher virus impact in CF.",

Since the sensitive molecular methods for detection of viruses are more and more common, several recent studies highlight the clinical importance of respiratory viruses especially during exacerbation of asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) or CF [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . In addition, viruses that were not previously sought are now detected, such as human rhinoviruses (HRVs) within the Picornaviridae family. Among the HRV genus, a new species of viruses named HRV-C has been described recently, is involved in severe respiratory infections in elderly and in immunocompromised patients [5, [10] [11] [12] HRV-C has been described in patients with CF exacerbation but the real impact in the progression of the lung disease remains unclear [7] .",

All patients had a well-documented diagnosis of CF with either the mutations identified in the CFTR gene or an abnormally high sweat chloride test. They were included by physicians according to the same criterion (an annual check-up or an exacerbation situation that required an expectorated sputum sample that allowed us to search also for bacterial and fungal microorganisms). Clinical data including spirometry, therapeutic, radiological and biological data were collected by clinic staff at each time of the visit. At each sampling time, the clinical status of the patients was defined as pulmonary exacerbation or stable period according to the physician defined requirement (i.e. recent changes in clinical parameters and/or modification of the pulmonary function provide criteria of exacerbation according to ERS statement) [13] .",

Our screening for respiratory viruses showed the presence of coronavirus in samples collected both from patients with exacerbation and from patients during stable disease. However, the presence of coronavirus in samples is not associated with the occurrence of an exacerbation, according to previous study [30, 31] . We detected influenza A virus in only one case, and therefore did not confirm the link between influenza infection and the occurrence of an exacerbation in CF previously described [29] . Due to the potential severity of influenza infection in CF, it is recommended to vaccinate patients against influenza viruses, but the patient positive to A/H1N1 detection did not follow this recommendation and was not vaccinated. The low influenza A virus detection frequency observed here might be linked to the good matching of the influenza vaccine to the circulating influenza viruses during our study period, even if the vaccination status of our CF patient cohort was not documented. Consistent with previous studies, we detected coronaviruses preferentially during the cooler months, HRV-A mainly in spring and autumn, and HRV-C variants preferentially during the autumn and winter months [15, 32, 33] .",

Whereas the physiopathology of virus-induced exacerbation in CF remains unclear, we established a significant association between HRV detection and respiratory exacerbation, confirming the results of recent studies [7, 32, 33] . The detection of HRVs is more frequent in nasal swabs, especially in patients in a stable phase of CF [9] . However, our results show that the detection of HRV in sputum is associated with the occurrence of an exacerbation suggesting that the analysis of sputum could be more relevant than nasal swabs when a viral cause of pulmonary exacerbation is suspected. Some recent studies have shown that HRV-C are involved in severe respiratory infections especially during exacerbations of asthma [34, 35] . Numerous findings underscore the polymicrobial nature of respiratory tract as well as the importance of lung microbiota as a distinctive feature of tissue compartmentalization, but viral microbiota (or virome) has been poorly studied in respiratory tract [22, 36] . Respiratory virome appears composed of three major virus families: Paramyxoviridae, Orthomyxoviridae or Picornaviridae for which a novel type of Rhinovirus C was identified [36] .",

As previously described, HRV-A and HRV-C were the most frequently detected viruses compared to the frequency of HRV-B detection [37] . Recent studies have shown recombination between the 5 UTR region of HRV-C genome and the coding region of HRV-A genome leading the authors to propose a new classification of HRVs in two subspecies, HRV-Ca and -Cc [15, 19, 20, 38] . Occurrence of such recombination was then confirmed, HRV-Ca and HRv-Cc being detected in various upper respiratory diseases [37] . Here, we identified all the HRV-C isolates as belonged to the sub-species HRV-Ca by sequencing both the VP4/VP2 and 5 UTR regions. To our knowledge, the present study describes for the first time the presence of HRV-Ca subtype in patients with CF. Although the clinical significance of such recombination is still matter of debate, our results confirm the well-known recombination ability of enteroviruses (notably HRVs); a fact of particular relevance when phage community represents a key point in the lung microbiota analysis as well as in the improvement of resistosome concept [26, 35, 38, 39] . In Fact, human microbiota represents a huge reservoir of mobilizable genes, as proposed by Rolain and co-workers [39] ; some of those genes encoding antimicrobial resistance that the authors named 'resistome' [39] . This concept is based on few metagenomic studies that have analyzed viral and bacterial communities in CF sputum samples, revealing the presence of an important bacteriophage community containing genes encoding antimicrobial resistance, and demonstrating these bacteriophages are consistent with the characteristics of multidrug-resistant microbial communities that are commonly observed in CF patients [26, 35, 38, 39] .",
