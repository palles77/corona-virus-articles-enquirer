In this thesis, the author intended to reveal the medical implication in the Holy Bible and its relevance to the modern medical science by exploring the biblical medical information and comparing it with the current medical theory and practice. The conclusion of the exploration is surprising yet inspiring: the Holy Bible, as an ancient religious book, contains rich medical information around themes such as sexual relations, dietary guidelines, hygiene, etc., which is not at odds, but in harmony with the modern medicine.",

To give just one example, the oceanographer M. F. Maury (1806-1873), known as the \"father of oceanography\", said he got the inspiration and motivation to explore the currents of water and wind in oceans from the Bible when his son read Psalm 8 to him during his sickness, \"The fowl of the air, and the fish of the sea, and whatsoever passeth through the paths of the seas\u2026\" (Psalm 8:8) [1] . It suddenly struck him that there must be paths in the sea if the Bible said so. Later, Maury observed the ships' fastest routes and mapped them out across the ocean and created something like \"paths\" in the sea, which enabled ships to progress more quickly [2] .",

And many religious ministries commit to the care giving of patients with terminal illnesses and chronic medical conditions. In China as well as in other countries, many hospitals were set up by Christian missionaries. Since late Qing dynasty, \"Medical Missionaries\" in China has become a special cultural phenomenon. According to the statistic in 1887, 150 Medical Missionaries came to China, including Peter Parker (1804-1889), Robert Morrison (1782-1834), Livingstone and T.R. Colledge. They all had both degrees for medicine and theology. The hospitals and medical institutes they set up nurtured a lot of Chinese medical experts and made great contributions to the development of modern medicine in China [3] .",

The only animals permitted for consumption were those that did not represent a threat to public health and were not important for the balance of nature. For example, scientific research has revealed that trichinae (worms too small to detect with the naked eye but can cause fatal diseases) occur in animals such as pigs, wild boars, dogs, wolves, hyenas, jackals, foxes, lions, leopards, bears, cats, badgers, mink, and martens\u2026 [2] .

(Exodus 31:15-17) [1] Sabbath is one of the most important festivals among Jews. Even while they were exiled and wandered among other nations, they observed Sabbath in a very serious way as it is a \"sign of the covenant\" (Exodus 31:12-17) [1] . Thus the saying, \"It's better to say that Sabbath reserved Jews rather than to say the Jews reserved Sabbath.\" [4] Sabbath is a great contribution that the Jews gave to the people of the world [12] . The fact that men and women may rest for one day a week is really a gift of the Bible. With one day of complete rest, they can do more work in the other six days of the week and feel so much better and healthier both mentally and physically, and they have more time for social contacts.",
