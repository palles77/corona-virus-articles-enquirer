Also, an initiative is only partly justified by its moral expediency. Of critical importance are factors shaped by knowledge and by institutional interests. Moral soundness about why particular global programmes should be advanced may need to be balanced against the imperative of achieving consensus among people of many different moral views. Yet, as we argue in the conclusion, moral clarity-as well as knowledge and institutional interests-can usefully shape what, when, and how health initiatives should best proceed.",

Humanitarianism can be a form of virtue ethics but it also often a humanistic response to evident social problems. The ethos of humanitarianism is embedded in nearly all religions. In a humanitarian approach, people respond to human suffering and realise human fulfilment by acting in a virtuous manner based on compassion, empathy, or altruism. The virtues might be specific or broad. Examples of specific acts are charitable tithing among Baptists or zakat (charitable donations) among Muslims. Broadly proscribed virtues encompass such human qualities as generosity, honesty, trustworthiness, integrity, and fairness. Among the wealthy, these virtues might be expressed as philanthropy, which often focuses on health. 4 Humanitarianism provides the primary ethical basis of voluntary action undertaken by non-governmental organisations (NGOs), and is also an important base of public support for official foreign aid. US president George Bush in announcing US$15 billion in assistance for HIV/AIDS control described the pledge as a \"work of mercy\". Public opinion polls in the USA consistently show that alleviating world hunger and providing drinking water are worthy of foreign aid from the USA. Emphasis on voluntary generosity and self-expression (rather than on duties or obligations) gives humanitarianism a broad appeal to many social groups, corporations, and governments.",

Health could be valued because it generates utility directly, or because good health is instrumental to other utilitygenerating states, including opulence, or both. Many contemporary health policies are based on a form of utilitarianism in which good health is valued as instrumental to maximising aggregate utility. For example, the WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health calculated the costs and benefits of burdens of disease and argued that investing in health would generate economic growth, thereby enhancing incomes and aggregate utility. 6 The utilitarian approach underscores important interconnections between health and other variables. It can show how improving the health of the deprived can be \"in everybody's interest\"-including the self-interest of people not inclined to altruism. Its difficulties, however, are several. First, the instrumental valuation of health demeans it as an intrinsically valued goal in all societies. Second, people's self-assessments do not www.thelancet.com Vol 364 September 18, 2004",

Sen argues that equity in health should be assessed in terms of health capabilities and achievements rather than healthcare activities. After all, health care is a human activity; what people actually value is the capability to attain good health. He further notes that equitable social processes should inform evaluations of equity in the health space. In some equity domains, such as gender, completely equal distribution of health achievement could be considered unfair because women-whose lifespan in the absence of gender discrimination exceeds that of men-should, under an equity framework, enjoy longer life expectancies.",

Equitable approaches to health have carried considerable power in mobilising support for health components of international development. Striking disparities in health achievement and emotively powerful arguments of preventable suffering can animate the public and political leaders. An example is the recent call for public funds to expand antiretroviral treatment to HIV-positive people in poor countries. The disparity between the health of those with access to lifesaving drugs and the avoidable deaths among all others evokes the moral imperative to alleviate preventable human suffering caused by the inequitable access to antiretroviral drug therapy.",

Legal formulations were created to specify what was argued in the 17th century to be an inalienable moral claim grounded in the ontological dignity of human beings. Human rights can be described as \"things which are owed to man because of the very fact that he is man\". 12 Some human rights can be expressed in the space of capabilities-for example rights to health, or to inclusion. Yet rights also add to the capability perspective by invoking duties and obligations on the part of others. Because each human being is recognised as an \"end\", human rights demand obligatory behaviour on the part of the state, firms, groups, and individuals. Obligations may be \"perfect\" (as enshrined in law) or \"imperfect\" (a general duty to do what one can to help). 13 Calls for a rights-based approach to global health have recently grown. Extensions of human rights to children and women both contain references to freedom from preventable suffering and freedom to exercise health choices. 14, 15 The application of human rights to good health has drawn attention to the duties and obligations that people and institutions have towards human beings, viewed squarely as an \"end\" worthy of dignity. A human rights approach often assumes some health minimum that all people should be able to realise for human dignity. The challenge is to implement the corresponding \"incomplete obligations\" among communities, institutions, and states where good health depends upon resources, knowledge, technologies, and social action.",

Tuberculosis, especially multidrug-resistant tuberculosis, became recognised as a health crisis when it achieved rapid transmission in New York City. Yet tuberculosis-before, during, and after the New York crisis-kills 2 million people annually, most of whom are poor. Because of informational selectivity, tuberculosis is a silent crisis among the world's poor, invisible to the rich and powerful. Similarly, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) achieved front-page news because of its lethal nature and the paralysing effect it had on global commerce. Yet, \"SARS-like\" health catastrophes take place daily in thousands of rural villages in low-income countries.

So when it comes to the language of why support for global health is important, we recognise, with Cass Sunstein, 22 the wisdom of seeking \"incompletely theorized agreements\" in the moral discourse surrounding global health. 23 In his 1994 Tanner Lectures in human values, Sunstein 22 argued that in some cases consensus can be achieved if participants refrain from elaborating their moral positions, because if they scrutinised these positions in depth, consensus could fracture. By contrast, he advocates an approach that \"enlists silence, on certain basic questions, as a device for producing convergence despite disagreement, uncertainty, limits of time and capacity, and heterogeneity\". Sunstein's approach has the advantage of opening space for dialogue, exchange, and discussion, thereby promoting deliberative democracy, political accountability, and reason-giving.

After all, the support base of global health initiatives is diverse, ranging from heads of state to private-sector executives to religious leaders to activists from NGOs to opinion-setters and journalists. It is highly unlikely that these constituencies will share an identical understanding of ethical terms.",

In the former case, the programme would invest heavily in building health clinics and outposts, and perhaps in increasing the ratio of medical personnel per citizen. This sounds very appealing until one recognises that a country may have many rural health outposts, and many doctors on salary role, but if these doctors do not turn up to work, and the outposts do not have adequate pharmaceutical supplies, the population's health outcomes might remain very poor. On the contrary, to achieve an equitable distribution of health outcomes it would be necessary to make sure that the investment in health care results in better health across the population. It would also then be necessary to address broader social determinants of health, such as that raised in Michael Marmot's 24 intriguing research on the under-recognised relation between socioeconomic inequality and health. Second, different ethical schools (and different groups within them) may shape how global health programmes are undertaken. Charitable acts might treat people as passive recipients of generosity, whereas rights-based approaches would encourage \"voice\" and participation to strengthen the agency of people for achieving their inherent rights.",

To mobilise a compassionate response, a picture of a feeble, emaciated, and large-eyed child might be used to stir pity among donors. Such advertisements tend to view the poor as helpless victims, rather than people who could be empowered to care for themselves. Arguably, much harm has been done by such dehumanising advocacy techniques. Yet, it could be argued that such moral approaches are legitimate to use because they are more effective in evoking public support than other moral approaches.",

Yet this is only one of the ways in which moral values can support global health initiatives, and is not necessarily the most powerful. Discussions on whether to frame the objective of global health initiatives in terms of access to health care, or capabilities for good health, or utility maximisation, help to clarify what global health initiatives seek to accomplish. Criteria such as efficiency, or equitable treatment for men and women, clarify which alternative actions to realise similar goals should be selected. Consideration of how health activities contribute to or block non-health objectives such as the support of agency, or the rights to self-determination, clarify the importance of how health initiatives are carried forward. Thus global health may be far easier to achieve if we pause to follow through different moral analyses and thereby clarify what, which, and how global health initiatives can best proceed.",
