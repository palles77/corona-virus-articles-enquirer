            "text": "increasing research has demonstrated that expression of brain and muscle arnT-like 1 (BMal1) and other circadian clock genes can be regulated by drugs and toxicants. We previously demonstrated that icariin, extracted from Herba epimedii, sromotes osteogenic differentiation. However, the mechanism underlying the association between icariin and BMal1 in osteogenic differentiation of bone marrow-derived mesenchymal stem cells (BMScs) remains unclear. The present study was designed with an aim to clarify the association between icariin and BMal1 in osteogenic differentiation of BMScs. The cell counting Kit-8 assay was used to evaluate cell proliferation. The expression of bone morphogenetic protein 2 (BMP2), runX family transcription factor 2 (runX2), alkaline phosphatase (alP), osteocalcin (oc) and BMal1 in BMScs was evaluated by reverse transcription-quantitative Pcr and western blotting. alP and alizarin red S (arS) staining were also performed. icariin promoted BMSc proliferation, and upregulated expression of osteogenic genes and BMal1. in addition, expression of the osteogenic genes BMP2, runX2, alP and oc were upregulated by BMal1 overexpression. Furthermore, we confirmed that BMal1 deficiency suppressed osteogenic differentiation in BMScs. Finally, arS staining of BMal1 -/-BMScs revealed that BMal1 was an essential intermediary in matrix mineralization during osteogenic differentiation. in conclusion, these results demonstrated that icariin promoted osteogenic differentiation through BMal1-BMP2 signaling in BMScs. The present study thus described a novel target of icariin that has potential applications in the treatment of osteogenic disorders.",

Brain and muscle arnT-like 1 (BMal1) is the most important component of the molecular biological clock, expression of which has been found to have 24-h periodicity in bone. The circadian system rhythmically regulates cellular proliferation, physiology, and behavior (7, 8) . Moreover, it is implicated in drug efficacy, metabolism, detoxification and toxicity (9) (10) (11) . The core transcriptional activator of the clock network is BMal1 which is regulated by delicate systems in mammals (7) . increasing numbers of studies have demonstrated that BMal1 and other circadian clock genes could be regulated by drugs and toxicants. Miranda et al (12) showed that resveratrol could reverse circadian disruption induced by a high-fat diet in rats. chen et al (13) demonstrated that carbon tetrachloride altered circadian rhythms of liver clock genes in a mouse model of hepatic fibrosis, while Gab\u00e1s-Rivera et al (14) reported that dietary oleanolic acid supplementation mediated circadian clock gene expression in an animal model. icariin is extracted from Herba epimedii which is widely used as a major active ingredient to prevent osteonecrosis induced by glucocorticoids in patients with severe acute respiratory syndrome. our previous study revealed that icariin regulated cell proliferation and osteogenic differentiation in Mc3T3-e1 cells (15) and acted as an effective ingredient for preventing the progression of onFH induced by glucocorticoids in a rat model (16) .

The central players in these are BMal1 encoded by the gene arnTl and clock circadian regulator (clocK) by the gene clocK (19) . BMScs are stem cells with the ability to differentiate in vitro into adipocytes, osteoblasts and cartilage-forming chondroblasts (20) . regardless of its exact developmental origin, the function of the circadian clock gene is related to the behavior of various stem cells involved in homeostasis and repair of bone and adipose tissue (21) . a recent report revealed impairment of osteogenic differentiation of BMScs from BMal1 -/mice (5) . This finding was in line with our present study as well as an observational study that showed that the numbers of active osteocytes and osteoblasts were reduced in BMal1 -/mice in vivo (22) . However, a previous study showed that the amount of osteoblastic activity was increased in BMal1 -/mice (21) . These differences may due to the different ages of the mice. in this study, we clearly evaluated the positive regulatory mechanism of BMal1 on osteogenic differentiation. our results indicated that BMal1 could accelerate osteogenic differentiation through BMP2 signaling. BMP2, a member of the transforming growth factor (TGF)-\u03b2 superfamily, is considered to be a key regulator of cell growth and differentiation (23) (24) (25) . a number of studies have suggested that the activity of clock genes is closely correlated with BMPs. one study reported that regulation of clock genes controlled BMP2 expression in osteoblasts (26) . Meanwhile, BMAL1 regulation of TGF-\u03b2 and BMP signaling in the control of fat adipogenesis has also been reported (27) . a recent study showed that BMal1 silencing-induced BMP2 was found in rat uterus endometrium stromal cells (28) . Samsa et al (5) recently reported that BMal1 -/mice had reduced osteoblast differentiation in vitro and they proposed some potential molecular mechanism of BMal1-dependent control of osteogenic differentiation including oxidative stress response, the mTor signaling pathway and translation. However, the precise mechanism via which BMal1 induces osteogenic differentiation of BMScs remains unclear. in the present study, it was demonstrated that BMAL1 deficiency decreased BMP2 expression during osteogenic differentiation of BMScs.",

For example, resveratrol, which is considered a natural antioxidant polyphenol compound, has also been demonstrated to ameliorate circadian disorders of lipid metabolism (30) . Moreover, a recent study revealed that glucocorticoids altered the circadian clock in the iris-ciliary body in a mouse model (31) . However, few studies have yet demonstrated the potential mechanism by which osteogenic differentiation is mediated between icariin and BMal1.",

Yang et al (32) showed enhanced proliferation of human neural stem cells in vitro at a concentration of 10 -5 mol/l. in addition, Mok et al (33) demonstrated that icariin stimulated the proliferation of uMr 106 cells at concentrations ranging from 10 -14 to 10 -6 mol/l.

Furthermore, the bone-strengthening activity of icariin has attracted much recent attention. However, there have been few reports on the effect of icariin on the circadian clock in BMScs. The present study suggested that icariin increased BMal1 expression. Furthermore, reduced expression of BMP2/runX2 was observed in the present study during osteogenic differentiation of BMal1-deficient cells. in addition, mineralized nodule formation was suppressed both in BMal1 -/-BMScs and in icariin-mediated BMal1 -/-BMScs. Taken together; these findings demonstrated that icariin promoted osteogenic differentiation by upregulating BMal1 expression through BMP signaling in BMScs. However, as the effects of icariin on BMScs in the present study were mainly observed in vitro, further studies will be needed to confirm these results in animal models.",
