While epitope-based vaccines offer advantages, knowledge of specific epitopes and frequency of major histocompatibility complex (MHC) alleles is required. Here we show that using promiscuous overlapping synthetic peptides (OSP) as immunogens generated peptide-specific CMI in all vaccinated outbred mice and in different strains of inbred mice; CMI responses also recognized viral proteins. OSP immunogens also induced CMI ex vivo in dendritic cell/T-cell cocultures involving cells from individuals with different HLA haplotypes. Thus, broad CMI was induced by OSP in different experimental settings, using different immunogens, without identifying either epitopes or MHC backgrounds of the vaccinees.",

            "text": "CMI is an important immune mechanism to contain infections caused by many viruses, such as herpes simplex virus (HSV), Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), cytomegalovirus (CMV) and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) [11, 12] . Both CD4 + and CD8 + T lymphocytes, which generally function as T helper (Th) or cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTL), respectively, recognize viral antigens through interactions between T-cell receptors (TCR) and viral peptides displayed by host major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecules. Unlike B cells, which react to the stimulation of intact antigenic proteins, CTL do not directly recognize such antigens [13, 14] . To generate CTL responses, antigens need to be present in the cytoplasmic compartment of antigen-presenting cells (APC). There, antigens are degraded by proteasomes and aminopeptidases into peptides that subsequently bind to MHC class I molecules [15] [16] [17] . For the purpose of delivering antigens to the cytoplasmic compartment, most current candidate AIDS vaccines employ live attenuated vectors (e.g. canary pox, recombinant modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA) or adenovirus) or plasmid DNA encoding viral gene products [18, 19] . These strategies are limited for the following reasons: for live vector vaccines, immune responses against vector components may dominate the immune responses and thus dampen the immunogenicity of inserts [3, 19] . Some live vectors may be problematic in immunocompromised individuals [20] . DNA vaccines alone, although they generated strong CTL responses in mice, were less effective in higher animals [21] .",

            "text": "Epitope-based peptide vaccines and DNA vectors encoding peptides based upon known T-cell epitopes were also effective in inducing CTL responses [22, 23] . Because of MHC restriction, the breadth of such responses may be narrow, which may favor viral escape variants. Using a DNA prime/MVA boost strategy, a single epitope vaccine was tested in rhesus monkeys [24] . Although this vaccine strategy generated strong CTL activity, it failed to protect the monkeys against SIV challenge [24] . To broaden CTL responses, multi-epitope vaccines are being developed by a number of groups [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] . One such multi-CTL epitope vaccine, which is intended for a DNA prime/MVA boost strategy, consists of a pool of CTL epitopes from HIV clade A Gag p24/p17. In mouse and monkey immunogenicity studies and subsequently in human clinical trials, specific CMI, as measured by interferon-\u2425 (IFN-\u2425-specific enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) analysis, was induced [28, [31] [32] [33] [34] [35] [36] [37] . Designing epitope-based vaccines for a general population is a labor-intensive process involving assessment of the frequency of MHC types and identification of T-cell epitopes [38] [39] [40] [41] . Bearing in mind the number of MHC alleles within a population and the number of proteins encoded by a given virus, it would be difficult to identify most CTL epitopes for most MHC alleles. When coping with an emerging epidemic caused by a new microorganism, such an approach may be impractical.",

OSP represent sequential stretches of 15-20 amino acids (aa) of a known viral or tumor antigen (Fig. 1) ; a given peptide within the OSP pool overlaps with its neighboring peptides by several aa. Historically, OSP have been used to identify CTL and Th epitopes in vitro. OSP can contain both CTL and Th epitopes. As peptides, they may be bound directly by MHC molecules expressed on the cell surfaces or ingested and processed by APC. Furthermore, OSP are promiscuous in that Fig. 1 . Schematic map of overlapping synthetic peptides (OSP). The first 30 amino acids (aa) of a protein sequence are shown, in which X represents any one of 20 essential aa. Individual peptides (Pn) were made to be 15 aa in length (15 mer) and to overlap with their neighboring peptides by 11 aa. they contain multiple epitopes that can bind to different MHC alleles. As such, OSP vaccines could be designed rapidly as neither epitopes nor MHC alleles need to be identified specifically; only the aa sequences of viral protein(s) need to be known.",

OSP have long been used in assays in vitro to identify CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell epitopes. In our current proof-of-concept study, we have shown that OSP can be used as broadly active immunogens: immunization with OSP generated both specific CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses in outbred mice, and T cells proliferated also in response to restimulation with soluble, whole protein. In addition, OSP immunization stimulated specific CTL activity in different inbred mouse strains against vaccinia virus expressing the whole protein as well as an immunodominant epitope. These vaccinated animals also developed proliferative responses to OSP as well as native protein. Lastly, specific CMI could be induced by OSP immunization ex vivo using cocultivation of OSP-pulsed DC with autologous PBL from two different human donors. Thus, OSP were immunogenic in vaccines of different MHC backgrounds.",

            "text": "Several mechanisms of how OSP vaccination generated specific CTL in our experiments could have been operative. While CTL epitopes usually consist of peptides of 8-9 aa in length, peptides longer than 13 aa can also function in this capacity and bind to MHC class I molecules directly [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] [52] [53] . In contrast, peptides exceeding epitope length have been shown to enter cells, undergo processing by proteasomes or other enzymes and bind to MHC class I molecules [15, 16, 52, 54] . Alternatively, the OSP immunogens in our experiments may have also been trimmed extracellularly by peptidases followed by direct binding to the MHC molecules on APC. We used OSP 15 or 20 aa long, which probably exceeded the length of conventional CTL epitopes. Based on the published reports [52, 54] , we postulate that the longer OSP underwent intracellular or extracellular processing. Indeed, we have indirect evidence that this may be the case. OSP-Gag IIIB -immunized BALB/c mice mounted specific CTL activity against P7G, a known virus-specific epitope restricted by H-2 d with the 9-aa sequence AMQMLKETI. OSP-Gag IIIB included two 15-mer peptides that contained the P7G sequence, peptide 5033 (GHQAAMQMLKETINE) and peptide 5034 (AMQMLKETINEEAAE). It is likely that at least these two peptides were processed, bound to H-2 d molecule and eventually stimulated virus-specific CTL. This might be an advantage over a single epitope-based vaccine because the chances of a specific epitope in the OSP to be presented seem higher than in the single epitope-based vaccine.",

In theory, OSP immunogens should include all possible epitopes of the corresponding fulllength protein, including epitopes for both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells. Indeed, our results have shown that OSP vaccination induced both CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell responses in all outbred mice in our trial.",

Consequently, these vaccines have broad immunogenicity in vaccine recipients with diverse genetic backgrounds, as our results in outbred and different strains of inbred mice have shown. Similar to epitope-based vaccines, OSP immunogens contain only \"viral elements,\" or in the case of cancer vaccines, \"oncogene elements\", such that generation of non-related immunity, e.g. immunity against vectors, can be avoided. In fact, we have generated specific cellular immunity against a novel cellular oncogene in mice using the OSP vaccination approach. In a pilot experiment, vaccinated mice had a statistically significant delay in tumor growth compared to controls (Mirshahidi et al., unpublished data). Furthermore, OSP are not expected to pose any safety risks, in contrast to concerns that might arise with some live vaccine vectors. Thus, preclinical and clinical evaluations can be conducted with a single mixture of OSP for a given clinical indication.",
