Design A cross-sectional questionnaire survey was conducted on 3541 households in China in 2015. Participants Households were selected using a stratified cluster sampling strategy, representing central, eastern, western and southern regions of China. The designed questionnaires were administered through face-to-face interviews. Outcome measures Household emergency preparedness was measured with 14 indicators, tapping into the supply of nine emergency necessities (food and water, extra batteries, battery-powered radio, battery-operated torch, first-aid kit, gas mask, fire extinguisher, escape ropes, whistle), coverage of accident insurance, knowledge of local emergency response systems (emergency numbers, exit routes and shelters) and availability of a household evacuation plan. If an individual acted on 9 of the 14 indicators, they were deemed well prepared. Logistic regression models were established to identify predictors of well preparedness based on 3541 returned questionnaires containing no missing values. results Only 9.9% of households were well prepared for emergencies: 53.6% did not know what to do and 31.6% did not want to think about it. A higher level of preparedness was found in the respondents who have attained higher education (adjusted OR=0.826 compared with the higher level), participated in emergency training activities (adjusted OR=2.299), had better emergency knowledge (adjusted OR=2.043), reported less fate-submissiveness (adjusted OR=1.385) and more self-reliance (adjusted OR=1.349), prior exposure to emergency events (adjusted OR=1.280) and held more positive attitudes towards preparedness (adjusted OR=1.286). Conclusion Household preparedness for emergency events is poor in China. Lack of motivation, negative attitude to preparedness and knowledge shortfall are major but remediable barriers for household preparedness.",

This is because emergency victims often face geographical isolation as a result of damage to local infrastructure such as energy, road and communication facilities. 5 Consequently, the arrival of external rescue support may experience two or more days of delay. 6 But rescue efforts in the first couple of days in disastrous events are critical. 7 Community and household preparedness in self-rescue efforts prior to the arrival of external assistance may result in the difference between the chance of survival and death. 8 Empirical evidence shows that sufficient household preparedness can significantly mitigate the negative consequences of emergency events. 9 The United Nations International Strategy for Disaster Reduction defined preparedness as the 'knowledge, capacities and actions to effectively respond to the effects of hazard events, whether or not they have occurred'. 10 Preparedness activities can be developed at the individual, household, community and governmental levels. Household preparedness plays a critical role because it is an integral part of any individual and community effort. The concept of household preparedness emphasises household responsibilities and the capability to reduce risks and damage 11 which requires stockpiling emergency supplies, planning for emergency events and other actions like buying accident insurance. 12 13 Previous studies revealed poor household preparedness for disastrous events across a range of different settings. 14 15 Despite a rise in the number of publications on household preparedness in developed countries, there is a serious shortage of literature documenting the situation in low-income and middle-income countries. Empirical evidence shows that household preparedness is associated with many factors, including knowledge, risk awareness, prior exposure to disasters, attitudes towards emergency preparedness 16 and trust in the government. Socioeconomic status may also play an important role. 17 18 Low-income and middle-income countries are facing ever-increasing challenges and costs associated with disastrous events but experiences from developed countries cannot be extrapolated to low-income and middle-income countries without consideration of the local contexts.",

This result is consistent with the findings of studies conducted elsewhere in China. Poor household preparedness for emergency events is common in many low-income and middle-income countries, such as Turkey and Iran. 29 The performance of developed countries, although better than in low-income and middle-income countries, is also far from satisfactory. In Australia, about one-fifth of households have sufficient supplies of items for emergency events such as a torch, radio, mobile phone, first-aid kit, appropriate batteries and an emergency contact list. A study in the USA revealed that 12.3% of American households possessed a 3-day supply of water and nonperishable food, an evacuation plan, a Open access working torch and radio. Similarly, 30% of households in Japan stockpiled food and drinking water for emergency events. 15 Factors contributing to the low level of household preparedness Findings of the logistic regression model and ranking of perceived barriers reported by the respondents point to the same conclusion: knowledge is a major determinant of household emergency preparedness ( figure 3 ). The odds of well preparedness doubled in the respondents with a higher than average level of knowledge. Training would also double the odds of well preparedness, possibly through filling knowledge gaps. This is echoed by over half of the respondents who reported knowledge shortage as the major barrier to preparing for emergency events. The association between knowledge and preparedness for emergency events is further supported by the link between education in general and preparedness. Prior exposure to emergency events may also improve the knowledge and attitudes of people, resulting in better preparedness for emergency events. These findings are consistent with previous studies. 30 31 Fate-submissiveness and a lack of recognition of selfreliance were identified as a significant predictor of poorpreparedness in the logistic regression model. Similarly, a lack of motivation to act ('do not want to think about it' and 'leave it to professionals') was reported as the second most significant barrier in household emergency preparedness.",

            "text": "system. In Japan, a disaster-prone country, for example, disaster mitigation has been integrated into its national school curriculum. 35 However, knowledge improvement by itself is not enough. The mentality of inertia in the public needs to be addressed. A positive correlation between the recognition of self-reliance and better household preparedness is evident as confirmed in this study and others. 36 But unfortunately, many traditional cultures encourage fate submissiveness. A study in Saudi Arabia found that most (93%) respondents believed that floods, earthquakes and other natural disasters are signs of god. 37 Fatalism is an attitude of self-defeatism which may lead individuals into helpless, undermining their efforts of individual preparedness. 34 38 The Chinese society also embraces an auspicious culture, encouraging people to pursue luck and avoid ominous things. It is taboo to talk about bad things, such as disaster and death. People prefer to pin their hopes on illusory things, rather than be prepared for real threats. 39 40 Lessons learnt from past disaster experiences may help change the mentality of inertia and risk perception. In Australia, for example, bush fires impose a regular risk for many households. The preparedness of individual households can make a difference between life and death. The National Partnership Agreement on Natural Disaster Resilience in Australia therefore emphasises the significance of involving multiple parties including individuals. 41 Emergency response systems are often complex and adaptive. A highly participatory strategy would encourage individuals to take more responsibility, become less dependent on the government and leave more resources for others. 42 Trust in the government is important given that it is most likely to play a coordinating role in emergency events. 43 However, over-reliance on the government and professional workers could dampen household efforts for future disasters. 44 A study of postearthquake survivors in China showed that high expectations of the public on the government are associated with high trust in the government, leading to increased complacency in individual efforts in preparedness. 16 In China, governmental response to disasters from the military force has often been extraordinarily rapid and efficient. For example, an earthquake-relief headquarter was established by the army 18 min after the earthquake strike in Ya'an and 5000-6000 rescue workers were deployed on the same day but people need to realise that there is always a gap before the full functioning of external rescue assistance, a gap which needs to be filled by the survivors of disasters. 7 Poor cooperation from those being rescued can also jeopardise professional efforts.",

Although this study drew large samples from four representative regions in China, the participants were not completely randomly selected. One adult respondent was invited to represent each household in this study but opinions from family members might not have always been consistent. Household preparedness can involve many aspects. The 14 emergency items included in this study may not be exhaustive. Although the 14 items are not equally important, their importance varies with different emergency events. This makes it difficult to attach a fixed weight to each item in terms of their importance. For example, in a fire emergency, 'escape rope' and 'gas mask' are more important than having food and water but this is not necessarily the case in an event when the survivors are isolated from the outside world. Therefore, we did not differentiate the importance of the emergency items. The dichotomisation of the dependent variable is somehow arbitrary. Although it enabled easy interpretation of the results, certain information might get lost in the statistical analyses. However, the linear regression analysis generated consistent results. It is important to note that the study adopted a cross-sectional design, no causal relationships should be assumed.",
