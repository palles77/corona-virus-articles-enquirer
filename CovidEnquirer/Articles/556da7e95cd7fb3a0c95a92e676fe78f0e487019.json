            "text": "Objectives: To study the clinical outcomes of hospitalized patients aged \u2265 15 years and diagnosed with RSV infection. Study design: Both retrospective and prospective cohort studies were conducted at a university hospital between May 2014 and December 2015. Results: RSV was detected in 86 of 1562(5.5%) adult hospitalized patients suspected of respiratory viral infection. Sixty-nine patients were included in the study. RSV was detected by RT-PCR (82.6%), IFA (10.1%), and both RT-PCR and IFA (7.3%). Most patients (87.0%) were aged \u2265 50 years. Cardiovascular diseases, pulmonary diseases, immunocompromised hosts, and diabetes were the major comorbidities. The common manifestations were cough (92.8%), dyspnea (91.3%), sputum production (87.0%), tachypnea (75.4%), wheezing (73.9%), and fever (71.0%). Fifty-five patients (79.7%) were diagnosed with pneumonia. Hypoxemia (SpO2 \u2264 92%) was found in 53.6% patients. Twenty-five of 69(36.2%) patients developed respiratory failure and required ventilatory support. Cardiovascular complications were found in 24.6% of patients. Congestive heart failure, acute myocardial infarction (MI), new atrial fibrillation, and supraventricular tachycardia were found in 9(13.0%), 7(10.1%), 4(5.8%), and 3(4.3%) of 69 patients, respectively. Overall mortality was 15.9%. Pneumonia (81.8%) and acute MI (18.2%) were the major causes of death. Conclusions: Most adult hospitalized patients with RSV infection were of advanced age and had comorbidities. Cardiopulmonary complications were the major causes of death. Management and prevention of RSV infection in these vulnerable groups are necessary.",

Nevertheless, it has been recognized as a cause of adult ARI, especially in the elderly, those with comorbidities, and immunocompromised hosts, which leads to hospitalization and increases morbidity and mortality [1, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] . The prevalence of RSV infection in adults varies from 3% to 13% depending on age groups, underlying diseases, diagnostic techniques, study periods, and geographic regions. [3] [4] [5] [7] [8] [9] , In addition, disease severity ranges from mild to severe acute respiratory illness [4] . A total of 4%-16% of adult patients with RSV infection required hospitalization [3, 4, 10] , with high complications including cardiopulmonary complications and mortality [4, 5, 8, 11] . There were a few data of adult hospitalized patients with RSV infection, with high complications, in Thailand; [3, 12, 13] however, additional clinical data are required for planning patient management and also disease prevention in this region.",

Pneumonia was diagnosed if patients had fever, cough, and dyspnea with new pulmonary infiltrates on chest radiography. Acute bronchitis was defined as an acute respiratory infection manifested predominantly by cough without pneumonia, common cold, or exacerbation of asthma or COPD [14] . Chest radiography was independently interpreted by two chest radiologists who did not know the clinical course of patients. If the results were discordant, the consensus was made after the discussion. Hospital-acquired pneumonia (HAP) was defined as pneumonia that developed 48 h or more after admission without endotracheal intubation. Ventilator-acquired pneumonia (VAP) was defined as pneumonia that developed more than 48 h after endotracheal intubation [15, 16] . COPD exacerbation was defined as a sustained worsening of the COPD patients' condition beyond normal day-to-day variations, acute onset and necessitates a change in regular medication [17] . Asthma exacerbation was defined by changes in symptoms and rescue use, which were outside the patients' usual range of day-to-day variation [18] . Worsening or new congestive heart failure were diagnosed by cardiologists based on clinical signs, laboratory investigation such as chest radiography and echocardiography.",

The mechanisms of these severe diseases in the elderly are not clear.
