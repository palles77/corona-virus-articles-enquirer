            "text": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) is a major cause of pediatric lower respiratory tract disease to which there is no vaccine or efficacious chemotherapeutic strategy. Although RNA synthesis and virus assembly occur in the cytoplasm, HRSV is known to induce nuclear responses in the host cell as replication alters global gene expression. Quantitative proteomics was used to take an unbiased overview of the protein changes in transformed human alveolar basal epithelial cells infected with HRSV. Underpinning this was the use of stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture coupled to LC-MS/MS, which allowed the direct and simultaneous identification and quantification of both cellular and viral proteins. To reduce sample complexity and increase data return on potential protein localization, cells were fractionated into nuclear and cytoplasmic extracts. This resulted in the identification of 1,140 cellular proteins and six viral proteins. The proteomics data were analyzed using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis to identify defined canonical pathways and functional groupings. Selected data were validated using Western blot, direct and indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy, and functional assays. The study served to validate and expand upon known HRSVhost cell interactions, including those associated with the antiviral response and alterations in subnuclear structures such as the nucleolus and ND10 (promyelocytic leukemia bodies). In addition, novel changes were observed in mitochondrial proteins and functions, cell cycle regulatory molecules, nuclear pore complex proteins and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking proteins. These data shed light into how the cell is potentially altered to create conditions more favorable for infection. Addition-ally, the study highlights the application and advantage of stable isotope labeling with amino acids in cell culture coupled to LC-MS/MS for the analysis of virus-host interactions.",

            "text": "Human respiratory syncytial virus (HRSV) 1 is an enveloped RNA virus and a member of the Paramyxoviridae family, which includes common respiratory viruses such as those causing mumps and measles. HRSV is a leading cause of serious lower respiratory tract infections in infants and young children (1) and causes repeated infections throughout life. The severity of illness varies from bronchiolitis and pneumonia to common coldlike symptoms. Particular individuals at higher risk of disease include preterm infants, the immunocompromised, and elderly patients. One of the pathologies of the disease is an innate inflammatory response to infection in the lung, which could explain possible links between HRSV and asthma (2, 3) . The pathogenesis of HRSV is not well understood, and to date, the development of a vaccine has been unsuccessful (4) . Understanding the interaction for HRSV in particular, and for other viruses in general, with the host cell proteome, will aid in the design of effective antivirals and the development of possible vaccine strategies (5) .",

HRSV has a cytoplasmic replication strategy, and the genome consists of a single-stranded negative sense RNA with the gene order 3\u0408 to 5\u0408: non-structural protein 1 (NS1), non-structural protein 2 (NS2), nucleo-(N) protein, phospho-(P) protein, matrix (M) protein, small hydrophobic (SH) protein, glyco-(G) protein, fusion (F) protein, M2-1 and M2-2, and the large (L) protein. The viral proteins can be grouped into different functional categories. Four proteins are present in the viral envelope: the G, F, M, and SH proteins. The G protein plays a role in virus attachment (7) , and the F protein promotes virus penetration and fusion of infected cells (8) . The M protein is present in the inner viral membrane, is involved in virion morphogenesis, and traffics between the cytoplasm and the nucleus (9) . The SH protein is important to viral infectivity and is a potential viroporin (10) . Five proteins are involved in RNA synthesis and formation of the ribonucleocapsid structure: N and P proteins, M2-1, M2-2, and the L protein (11) (12) (13) (14) . The L protein is the catalytic component of the replicase-transcriptase complex and possesses RNA-dependent RNA polymerase activity. NS1 and NS2 are accessory proteins involved in modulating the host response to infection by acting as antagonists of the \u2423/\u2424 interferon (IFN)mediated antiviral state (15) (16) (17) .",

Through this method, cellular and possibly viral proteins were identified and quantified. To reduce sample complexity and to study the interaction of HRSV with different regions of the cell, nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were purified and analyzed. A549 cells, a human lung carcinoma cell line that has properties similar to those of alveolar cells (which are permissive for HRSV), were used in this study. Because of its respiratory origin, this cell line has been used extensively in the characterization of HRSV infection (18, 21, 24, 28 -30) and in the proteomic analysis of cellular and infectious respiratory diseases (26, (31) (32) (33) . The quantitative proteomic analysis was validated using alternative techniques such as Western blot, confocal microscopy, and functional assays where appropriate. The data generated in this study indicated that there were cellular proteome alterations in HRSV-infected cells when compared with mock-infected cells and that many alterations were specific to defined protein subsets, pathways, and organelles. These included mitochondrial proteins, cell cycle regulatory proteins, ND10s, components of the nuclear pore complex, and nucleocytoplasmic trafficking proteins.",

The derived peak list was searched with the Mascot search engine (version 2.1.04; Matrix Science, London, UK) against a concatenated database combining 80,412 proteins from the Interna-tional Protein Index human protein database version 3.6 (forward database) and the reversed sequences of all proteins (reverse database). Alternatively, database searches were done using Mascot (Matrix Science) as the database search engine, and the results were saved as a peptide summary before quantification using MSQuant (http://msquant.sourceforge.net/). Parameters allowed included up to three missed cleavages and two labeled amino acids (arginine and lysine). Initial mass deviation of the precursor and fragment ions were up to 7 ppm and 0.5 Da, respectively. The minimum required peptide length was set to six amino acids. To pass statistical evaluation, posterior error probability (PEP) for peptide identification (MS/MS spectra) should be below or equal to 0.1. The required false positive rate was set to 5% at the peptide level. False positive rates or PEPs for peptides were calculated by recording the Mascot score and peptide sequence length-dependent histograms of forward and reverse hits separately and then using Bayes' theorem in deriving the probability of a false identification for a given top scoring peptide. At the protein level, the false discovery rate was calculated as the product of the PEP of the peptides of a protein where only peptides with distinct sequences were taken into account. If a group of identified peptide sequences belongs to multiple proteins and these proteins cannot be distinguished with no unique peptide reported, these proteins are reported as a protein group in MaxQuant. Proteins were quantified if at least one MaxQuant-quantifiable SILAC pair was present. Identification was set to a false discovery rate of 1% with a minimum of two quantifiable peptides. The set value for false positive rate/PEP at the peptide level ensures that the worst identified peptide has a probability of 0.05 of being false, and proteins are sorted by the product of the false positive rates of their peptides where only peptides with distinct sequences are recognized. During the search, proteins are successively included starting with the best identified proteins until a false discovery rate of 1% is reached, an estimation based on the fraction of reverse protein hits. Enzyme specificity was set to trypsin allowing for cleavage N-terminal to proline and between aspartic acid and proline. Carbamidomethylation of cysteine was searched as a fixed modification; N-acetyl protein and oxidation of methionine were searched as variable modifications.",

The observed changes were then validated and investigated using a combination of immunofluorescence to study subcellular localization, Western blot to study protein abundance, and functional assays applied where appropriate.",

Mock-infected cells were grown in media labeled with R6K4-Medium, and cells infected with virus were grown in media containing R10K8-Heavy. Proteins were identified and quantified at 24 h postinfection. Indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy indicated that 60 -70% of cells treated with HRSV were infected (Fig. 1B) . Fluorescence was not detected in mock-infected cells (Fig. 1B) . Cells were enriched into cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions, which were validated by the detection of characteristic cellular (tubulin for the cytoplasm and lamin B1 for the nucleus) (Fig. 1C ) and viral (Fig.  1D ) marker proteins that were enriched in the respective fractions. The protein concentration was determined by BCA assay. Note that equal protein concentrations were loaded, and therefore quantitative comparison of the relative abundance of proteins between the cytoplasmic and nuclear fractions should not be made. Western blot analysis showed that there was no virus present in mock-infected cells (Fig. 1D) .",

From this, we hypothesized that the mitochondrial permeability transition pores had an altered function in HRSV-infected cells. To test this hypothesis, we made use of a live cell mitochondrial assay in which green fluorescent (calcein AM) dye is maintained in healthy mitochondria (which are also stained red with a MitoTracker dye). As a positive control, cells were treated with the Ca 2\u03e9 ionophore ionomycin, which results in mitochondrial pore activation from the inner and outer mitochondrial membranes and subsequent loss of green fluorescence. In this live cell assay, it was not possible to use indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy to visualize HRSV-infected cells (as the cells could not be made permeable to allow antibody penetration). Therefore, cells were infected at an m.o.i. of 2 to ensure that at least 70% of cells were infected at 24 h postinfection, the assay point (after the experiment, cells were fixed, and infection status confirmed using indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy (supplemental Fig. 2) ). The data illustrated that in mock-infected cells the majority of the cells were stained green and red, indicating functional mitochondria (Fig.  9 ). In control cells treated with ionomycin, all of the cells were stained red with no green signal, indicating mitochondrial pore activation (Fig. 9) . In HRSV-infected cells, there was a greater population of predominately red cells than predominately green cells, indicating greater mitochondrial pore activation in cell populations infected with HRSV in comparison with the mock-infected cells (Fig. 9) .",

Network pathway analysis (Fig. 3 ) also predicted that cyclin A might be altered in HRSV-infected cells. Cdc2 has been shown to bind to cyclins such as A, E, and B types and can regulate cell cycle progression (59, 60) . In addition, in HRSV-infected A549 cells, cell cycle arrest has been observed; however, the abundance of cell cycle regulatory complexes was not elucidated (18) . Western blot analysis of nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions from mock-and HRSVinfected cells indicated that Cdc2 was less abundant in the nuclear fraction in HRSV-infected cells (confirming the quantitative proteomic analysis) and that cyclins D2, A, E, and B1 were also less abundant (Fig. 11) .

The nucleolus is formed from a complex of protein-protein and protein-nucleic acid interactions centered around nucleolar hub proteins such as nucleolin and nucleophosmin (64) . ND10s are formed around PML protein and are dynamic structures that are in continuous protein exchange with the nucleus, depending on the metabolic state of the cell (65) . PML is a protein with several different isoforms that can localize to ND10s and/or the nucleus or cytoplasm (66) . Several components of the subnuclear structures were altered in HRSV-infected cells, including an ablation of nucleolin (decreased 4.5-fold) and nucleophosmin (decreased 6.7-fold) (see supplemental Table 1 ; for nucleolin, shown using Western blot, see Fig. 11 ).",

Western blot analysis indicated that more PML isoforms were present in the nuclear fraction from HRSV-infected cells when compared with mock-infected cells (Fig. 11 ). In the cytoplasmic fraction in HRSV-infected cells, a decreased abundance in the number of PML isoforms was observed when compared with the mock-infected cells (Fig. 11) .

The inner membrane contains the protein complexes involved in the electron transport chain. Respiratory Complexes 1, 3, and 4 are proton pumps.

            "text": "Fractions-The LC-MS/MS analysis identified several viral proteins in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions (supplemental Tables 6 and 7, respectively). Although the data tables show a quantitative ratio between HRSV proteins and mock-infected cells, in reality this should be infinite and is a result of comparison with cellular peptides of similar sequence. HRSV replication is cytoplasmic, therefore, the potential presence of viral proteins in the nucleus may be considered an unusual observation. However, HRSV M protein has been shown to localize to the nucleus and contains nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking signals (9, (67) (68) (69) . The presence of viral proteins in the nuclear fraction either may have been an artifact of the fractionation procedure or may reflect the subcellular localization of a protein. To investigate whether the HRSV P and M2-1 proteins were present in the nucleus, overexpression analysis was utilized where these proteins were expressed as C-terminal fluorescent fusion proteins tagged with cyan (ECFP). The direct fluorescence confocal microscopy analysis indicated that both the P and the M2-1 proteins localized predominately to the cytoplasm, but some fluorescent signal was observed in the nucleus but excluded from the nucleolus (Fig. 13 ). This correlates with the identification of these proteins in the nuclear fraction. ECFP was localized throughout the cell. Note that ECFP and the fusion proteins have been false colored green postimage capture for increased clarity. DISCUSSION HRSV infection results in multiple changes in the host cell, and the aim of this study was to provide an unbiased global overview of these effects. The quantitative proteomics and the subsequent bioinformatics analysis using IPA allowed alterations in the host cell proteome to be mapped in HRSVinfected cells. This study serves to reflect the existing in vitro and in vivo data and highlights new interactions. To our knowledge, no such SILAC-coupled LC-MS/MS study has been applied to HRSV or to any other single-stranded negative sense RNA virus. Despite the potential of this technique and transferable application to the comparison of treated with non-treated experimental conditions (41, 70) , a few studies have used this methodology to investigate the interactions of viruses with the host cell. These include investigations of the interaction of hepatitis C virus (HCV) with cell lipid rafts (71), pseudorabies virus-infected cells (72) , coronavirus-infected cells (37) , and alterations to the nucleolar proteome in adenovirus- (73) and coronavirus (74)-infected cells.",

The laboratory-adapted HRSV A2 strain used in animal-based pathogenesis studies (75) was used in the SILAC study because it replicated to high efficiency in the A549 model cell line. These cells have been used extensively in HRSV studies because of their ability to retain features of alveolar cells (76) . Proteins were identified and quantified at 24 h postinfection as this time point occurs prior to the appearance of a major cytopathic effect; thus, the majority of cells remain viable for downstream processing. In addition, this time point is commonly used in HRSV studies and there- fore allows comparison with the previously published data. For example, microarray studies (24) of HRSV-infected cells have demonstrated a high return of data at this time point. In total, 606 cellular proteins were identified in the nuclear fraction, and 534 proteins were identified in the cytoplasmic fraction along with six viral proteins.",

Also, nuclear proteins with increased and decreased abundances between mock and infected cells were validated experimentally using alternative techniques on the same and different samples, e.g. the increased abundance of PML versus the decreased abundance of nucleolin and similar levels of marker proteins such as lamin B (e.g. Figs. 1 and 11) .

In the pathway analysis, STAT1 was linked to IFN \u2423/\u2424 (Fig. 5) . STAT1 activity is also regulated by phosphorylation, and HRSV uses distinct mechanisms to either impair STAT1 phosphorylation or increase phosphorylation of STAT1\u2424 (a STAT1 variant) to repress IFN expression (80) . HRSV proteins NS1 and NS2 strongly inhibit IFN \u2423/\u2424 by preventing the phosphorylation of the IFN regulatory factor-3 (15, 16) . However, the molecular pathology of HRSV infection and the mechanisms by which it circumvents IFN are still not fully understood. Different strains of HRSV can differ in their ability to block IFN type I synthesis, and likewise, cell line choice is important in such pathway studies.

IPA defines mitochondrial dysfunction as anything (genetic or environmental) that interferes with the regulation of reactive oxygen species (ROS) causing the superoxide to overpower the antioxidant system. ROS are potent elements in the mitochondrial antimicrobial defense system, and mitochondria may participate in the innate immune response by triggering the production of ROS (81) . However, as is the case in the IFN pathway, microbes may have evolved strategies to manipulate such defense mechanisms, and any alterations in mitochondrial function may affect the immune response of cells to virus infection. For example, HCV is able to block the mitochondrial antiviral signaling protein (found on the outer membrane of the mitochondria) downstream signaling pathway, which leads to the expression of IFN \u2424, thereby enabling HCV to evade host immunity (85) . Furthermore, human cytomegalovirus has been shown to perturb many cellular processes that promote the release of proapoptotic molecules such as cytochrome c (86) .",

Also of interest was the ablation of nucleolin (Fig. 11) , which under normal growth conditions is highly expressed in proliferating cells (97) and is responsible for correct mitosis and controlled centrosome duplication (98, 99) . The ablation of cell cycle regulatory complexes may account for the observed cell cycle arrest reported in HRSV-infected primary and A549 cells (18) and in cells infected with bovine respiratory syncytial virus (100) . A number of viruses with RNA genomes whose site of RNA synthesis is the cytoplasm have been reported to interact with the cell cycle to promote cellular conditions more favorable for viral replication. These include other negative sense RNA viruses such as measles virus, which can arrest cells in the G 0 phase to prevent an antiviral response (101) (102) (103) . Also, the positive sense RNA coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus arrests cells in G 2 /M to increase viral protein translation and progeny virus production (104) .",

For nucleolin, this was confirmed by Western blot analysis (Fig. 11) , demonstrating the strength of the SILAC approach. Recently, it has been shown that lamin B1 interacts with nucleophosmin to maintain nucleolar structure for ribosome biogenesis (107) . However, the loss of lamin B1 resulted in the breakdown of the nucleolus (107) . Our analysis indicated that lamin B1 was potentially cleaved and depleted in HRSV-infected cells (Fig. 1C) . However, the observation of degradation of lamin B was antibody-dependent (e.g. compare Fig. 1C with Fig. 11 ).

ND10 constituents TAR and RAD50 were significantly decreased in abundance, but the major constituent, the PML protein, was not detected by LC-MS/MS. Because PML is an ND10 marker protein, it was used to validate the abundance and localization of ND10s in HRSV-infected cells. Western blot analysis indicated that the abundance of PML protein increased in the nucleus of HRSV-infected cells. This was confirmed by indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy that showed an increased number of ND10s in the nucleus of HRSV-infected cells. These results are in contrast to a previous report for A549 cells infected with HRSV A2 strain (26) . However, in the current analysis, indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy positively identified HRSVinfected cells and showed that tagged PML-I and PML-II proteins remain in the nucleus. However, this does not preclude that certain isoforms may be more abundant in the cytoplasm of infected cells. Other negative sense RNA viruses have also been shown to interact with ND10s. For example, in rabies virus-infected cells, ND10s became larger, and the expression of rabies virus P protein led to the sequestration of PML in the cytoplasm, which resulted in an increased viral titer, presumably through the ablation of an antiviral response (108) . Along with the observations described above and the contrasting results from previous studies, it is important to note that ND10s are dynamic nuclear structures whose composition is highly dependent on the metabolic state of the cell.",

            "text": "Fractions-Several virus-encoded proteins were identified in the nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions. For the nuclear fraction (supplemental Table 6 ), one of these could be predicted, the M protein, as this has well characterized nuclear-cytoplasmic trafficking (69, 109, 110) . Overexpression analysis using fluorescently labeled M2-1 and P proteins indicated that these proteins were present in the nucleus but predominately localized to the cytoplasm (Fig. 13) , and hence this could explain why they were identified in both fractions. The F protein was detected in the cytoplasmic fraction only (supplemental Table 7 ), which may be due to the association of this protein with the cellular membrane. Viral proteins could not be quantified in this experimental system as there were no unlabeled virus peptides of known amount in the isolated fractions with which to compare. However, the comparison of viral peptides with mammalian peptides (some of which may have similar sequences) does allow some putative observations to be made regarding the relative amounts of the identified viral proteins. Examination of the viral protein ratios in the cytoplasmic fraction (supplemental Table 7 ) indicated that the relative protein abundance of the identified proteins reflected their position on the genome and hence the abundance of their corresponding mRNA. This correlates with the relationship between gene position on the genome and abundance of mRNA in the Mononegavirales (111) (112) (113) . This may also explain why no L protein was detected in the LC-MS/MS analysis as this is the least abundant virus protein in HRSVinfected cells. Several other HRSV-encoded proteins were not detected, including the NS-2, SH, and G proteins. This may be a function of their post-translational modifications (e.g. glycosylation of G protein) or indicative of protein stability and turnover inside a cell.",

            "text": "Conclusions-Although RNA synthesis and virus assembly occur in the cytoplasm, HRSV is known to induce nuclear responses in the cell as replication alters host gene expression. The relative changes in the abundance of cellular proteins in HRSV-infected cells observed in this study confirmed aspects of what is already known about changes in the host cell proteome, validating our novel approach and extending this information as well discovering novel interactions with defined cellular pathways. The application of LC-MS/MS coupled to SILAC has not been used previously to study negative sense RNA viruses and their interactions with the host cell, and this study is the first that gives a global overview of the host cell response to HRSV infection. This opens up new potential targets for therapeutic intervention and a deeper understanding of viral pathogenesis.",

The quantitative proteomic analysis indicated that in HRSVinfected cells nucleoporins (nups) were depleted; e.g. nup96 and nup98 were depleted 3.6-fold (and those shown in Fig. 10A). The only exceptions were nup85 and nup160. Indirect immunofluorescence confocal microscopy was used to investigate the subcellular localization of the nuclear protein lamin B in mock-infected cells in comparison with HRSV-infected cells (Fig. 10B). The data indicated that in mock-infected cells the protein was localized to the nuclear envelope but also was distributed between the nucleus and the cytoplasm. In contrast, in HRSV-infected cells, lamin B appeared to be more concentrated around the nuclear envelope with less fluorescence observed in the cytoplasm or the nucleus, which is indicative of altered trafficking or loss of nuclear pore complex function. Alteration of Cell Cycle Regulatory Proteins in HRSV-infected Cells-The quantitative proteomics and network pathway analysis (Fig. 3) identified several proteins with roles in cell cycle regulation whose abundance differed between mock-infected and HRSV-infected cells.
