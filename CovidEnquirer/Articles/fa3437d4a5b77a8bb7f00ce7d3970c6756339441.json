Furthermore, GL is one of the leading natural compounds for clinical trials in recent studies on chronic viral hepatitis and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) infections (Arase et al., 1997; De Simone et al., 2001; Fiore et al. 2008) . Chronic consumption of GL prevents the development of hepatic carcinoma from C hepatitis and the antiviral activity of GL against SARS associated corona virus has been demonstrated in vitro (Nassiri-Asl & Hosseinzadeh, 2008) . Finally, GL finds application in inhibiting unwanted effects of contraceptive formulations, such as alterations in blood coagulation and thrombosis (St\u00e4hli et al., 2007) .",

Molecular imprinting technique is an attractive synthetic approach to mimic natural molecular recognition, which exhibits a high affinity and selectivity toward a particular target compound named template (Alvarez-Lorenzo & Concheiro, 2006; Turner et al., 2006) . This technique utilises 0308-8146/$ -see front matter \u00d3 2010 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved. doi:10.1016/j.foodchem.2010.09.077 template molecules to assemble their own recognition sites by interacting with complementary functional groups of appropriate monomers. In this process, the selected template molecules are first allowed to establish binding interactions with functional monomers in a porogenic solvent. The resulting complexes are then copolymerised with an excess of cross-linkersin the presence of a free radical initiator. Subsequent removal of the template molecules creates specific binding sites with the precise spatial arrangement of the functional groups in the polymer network together with the shape. Thus, reversible re-binding and high selective recognition of the target molecules are realised (Nicholls et al., 2009; Puoci et al., 2009) .",

In this study, GL imprinted polymers were synthesized by employing methacrylic acid (MAA), 2-hydroxyethylmetacrylate (HEMA) or 2-(dimethylamino)ethyl methacrylate (DMAEM) as functional monomers and Ethylene glycol dimethacrylate (EGDMA) as crosslinker. After the evaluation of the imprinting efficiency, a SPE protocol was optimised and applied for the selective extraction of GL form liquorice root without any preliminary treatment of the sample. A very straight-forward protocol was developed, involving the direct HPLC injection of eluate fractions without any treatment. The pre-treatment of the sample consists only of a crushing step and a soxhlet extraction. In all the steps, no toxic and biocompatible organic solvents were used.",

Three millilitres of the prepared loading solution was employed to load the cartridges which almost completely absorb GL (Fig. 3a) . Thus, in order to obtain a satisfactory clean-up of the template, the washing solvent was applied on the cartridges and the GL amount in the washing fractions determined. In the washing chromatogram of MIP cartridges (Fig. 3b) , not so relevant peaks were observed at the retention time of GL, confirming the selective interaction between polymers and template. The GL amount in this fractions represents about the 20% of the loaded one. Furthermore, an important cleanup of the extracted mixture was obtained, as showed by the presence of several peaks referable to the others compounds of the sample.",

Thus, GL-MISPE protocol using HEMA-MIP offers excellent recovery of the template and is suited to routine use for GL isolation from liquorice.",
