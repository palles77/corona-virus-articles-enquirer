However, the patient's oropharyngeal swab was negative for the 2019 novel coronavirus on the real-time reverse-transcription PCR assay.

Second, the diagnosis of 2019-nCoV pneumonia requires repeated nucleic acid testing. Moreover, the rapid progression of chest imaging in the short term (<7 days) has critical diagnostic value for patients with negative 2019-nCoV nucleic acid tests. The image showed multiple patchy consolidations with high-density shadows in the lower lobe of both lungs. (D) Images obtained 5 days later showed partial absorption of the consolidation lesions in the right lower lobe, but fibrosis, bronchiectasis, and vascular thickening occurred.",
