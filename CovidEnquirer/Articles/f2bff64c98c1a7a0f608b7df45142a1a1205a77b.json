Among synthesized, compound 4e was the most potent inhibitor of l-calpain (IC 50 = 0.13 lM) and also exhibited strong antioxidant activities in three assay systems. Series of 4H-chromen-1,2,3,4-tetrahydropyrimidine-5-carboxylate derivatives were synthesized, screened for their anti-mycobacterial and anticancer activities, among them compound 7za is more potent anti-mycobacterial, 7v more potent anticancer agents compared to standard drugs and are being reported in this study for the first time to serve as a model compounds for design and development of therapeutic based anti-mycobacterial and anticancer activity.",

Novel 5-(2-hydroxyphenyl)-3-methyl-4,5-dihydropyrazol-1-yl-anone as potential telomerase inhibitors were synthesized. The bioassay tests show that compound 4a exhibited high activity against human gastric cancer cell SGC-7901, Hep-G2 and PC-3 cell lines. All title compounds were assayed for telomerase inhibition, the results show that compound 4a can inhibit telomerase. Docking simulation was performed to position compound 4a into the telomerase (3DU6) active site to determine the probable binding model. Eight 15(a)b-O-glycosyl 5(6)-dihydro-OSW-1 analogs bearing three kinds of disaccharide side chains were synthesized and evaluated for their antitumor activities. The identification of two novel series of formyl peptide receptor 1 (FPR1) antagonists are reported, represented by methionine benzimidazole 6 and diamide 7. Both series specifically inhibited the binding of labelled fMLF to hrFPR1 and selectively antagonized FPR1 function in human neutrophils, making them useful in vitro validation tools for the target. The exploration of heterocyclic carboxamidines as iNOS inhibitors led to the identification of (2R)-2-pyrrolidinecarboxamidine as a potent and selective haem-co-ordinating inhibitor.",

Currently, there are no approved pharmacological treatments for botulinum intoxication. Discovering molecules that could be used as a path forward for therapeutic development as botulinum protease inhibitors is tantamount. A benzylidene cyclopentenedione-based inhibitor was found to be the first affinity reagent to covalently modify the active site of botulinum neurotoxin A light chain metalloprotease.

David Stepp, Ronnie Rbased screening using Surface Plasmon Resonance (SPR) followed by Pim-1 biochemical assay identified hit 10. A X-ray structure of the bound complex of 10 to the Pim-1 protein revealed that 10 binds in the ATP binding site with the 5-bromo group sitting in the hydrophobic pocket near the hinge region. Guided by the X-ray structures, a potent Pim-1 inhibitor 38 was identified by adding an aminocyclohexaylamino group at the 7-position of the benzofuran core. X-ray structure of the bound complex of 38 indicated that the terminal amino group forms salt-bridge interacts with D128 and E171 of the ribose binding site.Design and synthesis of benzoxazole containing indole analogs as peroxisome proliferatorSynthesis of series of benzoxazole or benzothiazole containing indole-based analogs, 6-alkoxyindole-2-carboxylic acids and 5-alkoxy-3-indolylacetic acids, and their PPARc/d transactivation activities are reported.Synthesis and antitumor activity of 5-[1-(3-(dimethylamino)propyl)-5-halogenated-2-oxoindolin-(3Z)ylidenemethyl]-2,4-dimethyl-1H-pyrrole-3-carboxamides pp 3062-3065 Kai Lv, Li-Li Wang, Ming-Liang Liu*, Xin-Bo Zhou, Shi-Yong Fan, Hong-Ying Liu, Zhi-Bing Zheng*, We report herein a series of novel 1-[3-(dimethylamino)propyl]indolin-2-one derivatives.
