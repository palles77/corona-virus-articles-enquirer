            "text": "The subgenomic RNA 3 of IBV has been shown to be a tricistronic mRNA, encoding three products in IBV-infected cells. To explore if the least expressed ORF, ORF 3b, which encodes a nonstructural protein, is evolutionarily conserved and functionally indispensable for viral propagation in cultured cells, the Beaudette strain of IBV was propagated in chicken embryonated eggs for three passages and then adapted to a monkey kidney cell line, Vero. The 3b gene of passage 3 in embryonated eggs and passages 7, 15, 20, 25, 30, 35 50, and 65 in Vero cells were amplified by reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction and sequenced. The results showed that viral RNA extracted from passages 35, 50, and 65 contained a single A insertion in a 6A stretch of the 3b gene between nucleotides 24075 and 24080, whereas the early passages carried the normal 3b gene. This insertion resulted in a frameshift event and therefore, if expressed, a C-terminally truncated protein. We showed that the frameshifting product, cloned in a plasmid, was expressed in vitro and in cells transfected with the mutant construct. The normal product of the 3b gene is 64 amino acids long, whereas the frameshifting product is 34 amino acids long with only 17 homogeneous amino acid residues at the N-terminal half. Immunofluorescent studies revealed that the normal 3b protein was localized to the nucleus and the truncated product showed a \"free\" distribution pattern, indicating that the C-terminal portion of 3b was responsible for its nuclear localization. Comparison of the complete genome sequences (27.6 kb) of isolates p20c22 and p36c12 (from passages 20 and 36, respectively) revealed that p36c12 contains three amino acid substitutions, two in the 195-kDa protein (encoded by gene 1) and one in the S protein, in addition to the frameshifting 3b product. Further characterization of the two isolates demonstrated that p36c12 showed growth advantage over p20c22 in both Vero cells and chicken embryos and was more virulent in chicken embryos than p20c22. These results suggest that the 3b gene product is not essential for the replication of IBV.",

            "text": "Avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV) is a member of the Coronaviridae family in the new order Nidovirales (Cavanagh et al., 1997) . Coronavirus itself is further divided into three groups on the basis of the antigenicity, genome organization, and sequence homology (Enjuanes et al., 1998 (Enjuanes et al., , 2000 . IBV, together with turkey coronaviruses (TCoV) and pheasant coronaviruses (PhCoV), belongs to group III (Cavanagh, 2001a; Cavanagh et al., 2001b Cavanagh et al., , 2002 Guy, 2000) . It is an enveloped virus with a single positive-stranded RNA genome of 27.6 kb in length. Upon virus entry into cells, a 3\u0408-coterminal nested set of six mRNAs is produced. About 74% of the genome at the 5\u0408-end comprises two overlapping replicase genes, expressing from the genomic RNA or mRNA 1 in the form of polyproteins 1a and 1a/b. The polyproteins are subsequently processed into at least 10 nonstructural proteins by virusencoded proteinases (Lim et al., 2000; Ng et al., 2000; Xu et al., 2001) . These mature and intermediate products are involved in the genomic and subgenomic (sg) RNA synthesis. The four structural proteins, spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N), are encoded by sgRNAs 2, 3, 4, and 6, respectively. Meanwhile, four small nonstructural proteins, 3a, 3b, 5a, and 5b, are also encoded by sgRNAs 3 and 5. The functions of the structural proteins S, E, M, and N have been extensively studied, whereas little is known about the functions of the nonstructural 3a, 3b, 5a, and 5b. Similar small ORFs, interspersed among the structural genes S, E, M, and N, are also found in other coronaviruses. For example, two to five ORFs for nonstructural proteins were found in group I coronaviruses, and three to four ORFs for nonstructural proteins and two for minor structural proteins, hemoagglutinin esterase (HE) and internal gene product (I) of the N gene, were identified in group II coronaviruses. The identities and locations of these group-specific genes vary among different viruses. These structural and nonstructural genes are referred to as accessory genes, as they might be dispensable for viral replication (De Vries et al., 1997) . Strains lacking one of these genes are still viable at least in vitro and sometimes in vivo.",

However, the second and even the third ORF of several sgRNAs are translated by mechanisms of internal initiation or leaky ribosomal scanning (Liu and Inglis, 1991b; Senanayake et al., 1992; Thiel and Siddell, 1994) . These include the 3b, 3c (for E), and 5b from sgRNAs 3 and 5 of IBV; the 5b (for E) from sgRNA 5 of murine hepatitis virus (MHV); and the 3b, 3c, and 7b from sgRNAs 3 and 7 of canine coronavirus, respectively (Horsburgh et al., 1992; Liu et al., 1991a; Inglis, 1991b, 1992a; Yu et al., 1994) . One of the distinguishing features of group III coronaviruses is that the third ORF 3c of the tricistronic mRNA 3 encodes the E protein, which, together with the M protein, plays an essential role in virus particle assembly (Bos et al., 1996; Vennema et al., 1996) .",

High sequence identity between these genes in IBV, TCoV, and PhCoV is observed (Cavanagh et al., 2001b (Cavanagh et al., , 2002 , but sequence similarities are very low, if any, when compared with the nonstructural, accessory genes of group I and II coronaviruses.

This was due to a single base insertion at the 5\u0408-terminal portion of the 3b gene, leading to frameshift and a product with only 17 homogeneous amino acid residues. Interestingly, the mutant emerged after IBV was adapted from chicken embryos to Vero cells, a monkey kidney cell line. During passage of the virus in Vero cells, the mutant showed growth advantage over wild-type virus and became a dominant strain quickly. The growth abilities of two isolates, p20c22 and p36c12, carrying a normal and a truncated 3b gene, respectively, were characterized in both Vero cells and embryonated eggs. The results indicated that p36c12 propagated more quickly and produced larger plaques than p20c22 in Vero cells and might be more virulent in chicken embryos. The normal 3b protein was localized to the nucleus, whereas the truncated form showed a defuse distribution pattern. To our knowledge, this is the first coronavirus nonessential, nonstructural protein shown to be localized to the nucleus.",

The sequence profiles of RT-PCR products would represent the populations of the viral RNAs presented in a given passage. Overlapping peaks at the same position, representing different populations of viral RNAs, would be observed if wild-type and mutant viruses coexisted. As shown in Fig. 2 , a single A insertion was detected in viral RNA prepared from p50, and two overlapping peaks representing an A and a T were observed at the same position in viral RNA prepared from p30 ( Fig.  2A) . Systematic sequence analysis of other passages demonstrated that the insertion was detected in p25, confirming that the insertion had occurred after the virus had been adapted to a new host. The mutant prevailed quickly in the population in less than 25 passages, suggesting that the mutant may have a growth advantage over wild-type virus.",

            "text": "Furthermore, 10 independent plaques were picked from each of passages 20 and 36, and the 3b gene of each isolate was sequenced. Sequence analysis revealed that 1 of 10 isolates from passage 20 carried the single A insertion (a 7A stretch). By contrast, only 1 of 10 isolates from passage 36 contained the normal 6A stretch. These results indicated that viruses with the single A insertion dominated quickly during passage and had growth advantage over wild-type virus in both Vero cells and embryonated eggs To understand why the mutant became dominant so quickly and viruses with a normal 3b gene was almost undetectable within less than 25 passages, the growth properties of two viruses in Vero cells and in embryonated eggs were examined. Two viruses, p20c22 (without the single A insertion) and p36c12 (with the insertion), were plaquepurified from passages 20 and 36, respectively, and the genotypes of the two viruses were confirmed by sequencing the RT-PCR fragments from both directions. To compare the growth abilities of the two viruses in Vero cells, same amounts of each virus (2 \u03eb 10 5 PFU/dish) were added to the cells in 35-mm dishes (at a m.o.i. of \u03f30.1). Samples were collected at 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, 9, 12, 24, 36, and 48 h postinfection (p.i.) , and the titers of virus in each sample were determined by plague assays on Vero cells. The growth curves of the two viruses in Vero cells are shown in Fig. 3a . Clearly from 7 to 24 h p.i., the titer of p36c12 was about 2 to 10 times as high as that of p20c22. P36c12 reached its peak at 24 h p.i., whereas p20c22 was 24 h later at 48 h p.i. The experiment was repeated twice. The gradual decrease of the titers of p36c12 observed from 36 to 48 h p.i. was likely due to the fact that p36c12 induced lysis of all infected cells much earlier than p20c22. Meanwhile, the plaque size of p36c12 was clearly bigger than that of p20c22, 2.2 mm vs 1.1 mm (\u03ee 0.2 mm) in diameter (Fig. 4) . It was also observed that the cytopathic effect (CPE) induced by p20c22 was delayed about 12 to 24 h compared to p36c12. These results confirm that p36c12 exhibits growth advantage over p20c22 in Vero cells.",

The allantoic fluid from 3 eggs from each group was collected at different time points. Plaque assays were performed using supernatants of the centrifuged fluid to determine the virus titers of each sample. As shown in Fig. 3b , the titers of p36c12 at 9 and 12 h postinoculation were higher than those of p20c22. Afterwards, the titers of p36c12 dropped more quickly than those of p20c22. The decrease of the titers of p36c12 was likely due to the death of infected embryos, mimicking the situation in Vero cells. In fact, it was found that chicken embryos infected with p36c12 were dying at 12 h postinfection, at least 12 h earlier than those infected with p20c22 when 4 \u03eb 10 4 PFU per egg was used.

Samples were collected from the infected cells or allantoic fluids and titrated on Vero cells. The experiments were independently repeated twice and each titration contained three duplicates. 1. Compared to EP3, 14 point mutations caused amino acid substitutions in three cleavage proteins of the 1a and 1a/b polyproteins and the S and E protein. However, only three substitutions were identified between p20c22 and p36c12, two in the 195-kDa protein and one in the S protein (I 769 -M 769 ), in addition to the mutant 3b product of p36c12. Among the three isolates (EP3, p20c22, and p36c12), all amino acid substitutions in the spike protein occurred in the S2 region. As the S2 is more likely to be involved in membrane fusion rather than in receptor binding (Cavanagh et al., 1986; Saeki et al., 1997 , Taguchi, 1995 , it would be of interest to test the fusion activity of the S protein isolated from p20c22 and p36c12.",

The normal 3b protein, mutant 3B (C-terminal-truncated) protein, and an N-terminal truncated 3b\u232c1 protein were transiently expressed in cells and their subcellular localization patterns were analyzed. For this purpose, a T7-tag (encoding 11 amino acids) sequence was added in frame to the 5\u0408-end of each of the 3b, 3b\u232c1, and 3B genes under the control of a T7 promotor. The sequence encoding the first 17 amino acids at the N-terminus of 3b was deleted in the 3b\u232c1 construct. The three constructs were confirmed by sequencing and their expressions were analyzed by in vitro transcription and translation (Fig. 7a) . The subcellular localization of these proteins was analyzed by indirect immunofluorescent staining at 4, 12, and 24 h posttransfection. The confocal microscopy images of transfected cells were shown in Fig. 7b . At 4 h posttransfection, nuclear localization of the normal 3b and N-terminally truncated 3b\u232c1 was observed and these proteins remained exclusively in the nucleus at 24 h posttransfection. In contrast, a defuse distribution pattern was observed for the C-terminal truncated 3B (Fig. 7b) . These results indicated that the normal 3b was specifically localized to the nucleus and the C-terminal region of the 3b carried a functional domain related to this nuclear localization. Cos-7 cell, which is also a cell line derived from African green monkey kidney, was used in this experiment because of its higher transfection efficiency compared to Vero cells.",

Little progress has been made since then on the functions of these nonstructural proteins in the life cycle of IBV. Similarly, the functions of nonstructural, accessory proteins encoded by other members of coronaviruses are also unknown, though these proteins are shown to be nonessential for virus propagation in cultured cells and, in some cases, in animal hosts (Luytjes et al., 1988; Schwarz et al., 1990; Weiss et al., 1993; Yokomori and Lai, 1991b; de Haan et al., 2002) . In this report, we characterize a mutant with a defective 3b gene encoding a C-terminally truncated product. This was due to a single base insertion at the 5\u0408-terminal portion of the gene, resulting in a novel, frameshifting product with 17 homogeneous residues at its Nterminus and 17 heterogeneous residues at its C-terminus, instead of 64 residues for the normal 3b protein.

The mutant p36c12 has growth advantage over p20c22 with the normal 3b gene in both Vero cells and chicken embryos and has larger plaque sizes than p20c22. It appears that the mutation in the 3b gene, together with the two mutations in the 195kDa and one in the S protein, renders growth advantages to the mutant and determines its fate in virus evolution: survival or extinction. Clearly, the winner is the one that changes its coding capacity and therefore is fitter than others in a highly competitive, coexisting environment under selective pressures, in this case, continuous passages perhaps at a high multiplicity of infection in a new host.",

However, it was noted that sequencing of the equivalent region of dominant strains from passages 50 and 65 showed that the predicted residue was an Ile at this position instead of a Met, suggesting that the strain with the I 769 -M 769 mutation did not dominate in the populations. Furthermore, no difference between S with I 769 and S with M 769 in induction of membrane fusion was observed when the two constructs were expressed in Vero cells.

Initial characterization of the protein by fusing the coding sequence of 3b or 3B with a T7-tag sequence showed that the normal 3b protein was able to translocate to the nucleus, whereas the truncated product showed a defuse pattern. The evidence showed that the C-terminal portion of 3b was responsible for the nuclear localization. In this study, the mechanism by which the IBV 3b protein was localized to the nucleus was not elucidated. Because of the lack of a conventional nu-clear-localization signal in the 3b protein, it is likely that the specific localization to the nucleus is due to the interaction of the 3b protein with a host protein. Meanwhile, it would be interesting to investigate whether the 3b protein may interact with the N protein, which tranlocates to the nucleolus and interacts with nucleolar antigens, fibrillarin, and nucleolin (Wurm et al., 2001; Chen et al., 2002) . Further characterization of this localization pattern in IBV-infected cells was hampered by the lack of a highly specific antibody. Nevertheless, as the 3b protein may be the only IBV nonstructural protein that translocates to the nucleus, it is tempting to speculate that the protein might be involved in functions related to the regulation of host functions. Taken together with the observations that the mutant with a truncated 3b gene has growth advantages and is more virulent, the 3b protein might be associated with a cellular antiviral defense system. It has been reported that the nuclear domain 10, a subnuclear structure, is implicated in the modulation of the interferon response (Zheng et al., 1998) and the arenavirus Ring protein targets to this structure, modulating downstream antiviral effects (Borden et al., 1998) . The envelope protein E, together with the M protein, has been proved to play an essential role in the budding of virion in the ER. As the IBV E is encoded by the third ORF of the tricistronic mRNA3 and initiated by ribosome internal entry mechanism (Liu and Inglis, 1992b) . The observation that the in vitro expression efficiencies of the E protein encoded by the tricistronic RNAs with or without the single A insertion were at similar levels suggests that the insertion in the 3b did not affect the translation of the E protein. As the ribosome internal entry site (IRES) for the IBV E protein was not well defined, it is unknown if the insertion is in the IRES region. On the other hand, it was observed that p36c12 overgrew p20c22 and was more virulent in chicken embryos than p20c22. As the insertion of an extra A would increase the local AT content, we do not rule out the possibility that this insertion may actually enhance the expression of the E protein in the embryonated eggs.",

The Beaudette stain of IBV was purchased from American Type Culture Collection (ATCC) and propagated first in 10-day-old, embryonated eggs for 3 passages. Then the viruses were adapted to grow in Vero cells for 65 passages. Plaque assays were performed as previously described (Shen et al., 1994) . P20c22 and p36c12 from passages 20 and 36, respectively, were purified by plaque purification three times. Their genetypes were confirmed by determining the complete genome nucleotide sequence and only the first three passages of each isolate were used. Passage 3 in embryonated eggs and several passages in Vero cells were also used for direct RNA extraction, RT-PCR, and sequence analysis. Recombinant vaccinia/T7 virus (VT3) was grown and titrated on Vero cells.",
