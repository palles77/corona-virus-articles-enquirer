We found NOS II mRNA expression in brains of acutely infected animals on days 5 through 7 after infection. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry demonstrated NOS II message and protein in infiltrating macrophages. Persistent infection with MHV-JHM results in chronic demyelinating encephalomyelitis. NOS II mRNA was detected in persistently infected spinal cords. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry showed expression of NOS II in astrocytes in and around demyelinated lesions. These results suggest the role of NO release in acute versus persistent infection with this virus, and its contribution to the resulting pathology, may be different.",

These observations suggest that NOS II induction and NO release may contribute to the pathogenesis of the disease; however, in this rapidly progessive infection it is more likely that CNS dysfunction is a result of neuronal and general parenchymal damage caused directly by the virus. Non-specific cytotoxic effects on cells adjacent to infiltrated macrophages in acute MHV-JHM infection may produce some CNS damage. This would be expected since activated phagocytes also produce superoxide anion which could interact with NO to produce peroxynitrite. However, the observation that significant numbers of NOS II positive macrophages are present in the brain parenchyma only at late stages of the disease when extensive CNS damage has already occurred, suggests that the amount of NO-associated injury is probably not enough to significantly alter the course of the disease. One would predict, therefore, that administration of a specific NOS II inhibitor would not affect the clinical course of this acute infection. Infiltrating macrophages also express NOS II in Borna and Rabies encephalitides, but in these cases the NO released is thought to contribute significantly to CNS damage and therefore clinical disease \u017d . Zheng et al., 1993; Van Dam et al., 1995 . In this model, infected resident CNS cells do not appear to express NOS II, and NOS II expression is also not completely spatially correlated with virus. These observations could be explained by the sensitivity limit of the assay; it is possible that neurons, glia, or other cells may be producing low levels of NOS II which are undetectable by immunohistochemistry. This explanation is not likely since NOS II was demonstrated in endogenous cells with persistent infection. Alternatively, it may take longer than \u017d . expected based on in vitro data to induce astrocytes or other CNS cells to express NOS II in vivo. More likely, a complex system of regulation for NOS II expression by soluble mediators andror virus may exist in vivo. Therefore, NO release does not appear to be a component of the innate immune response to acute infection with this virus or to play a significant role in viral clearance. This is \u017d . unlike Lymphocytic Choriomeningitis Virus LCMV infection, in which infiltrating macrophages also express NOS II. Here, administration of antimacrophage agents before LCMV infection results in a significant increase and prolongation of viremia, suggesting a role for \u017d macrophage NO release in clearance of virus Cross et al., . 1993 . Other reports have shown NOS II induction in virus-in-\u017d . fected glial cells in vivo Dighiero et al., 1994 and a recent study describes NOS II expression in non-infected but nearby glial cells in VSV-infected brain, expression \u017d . coinciding with decreased viral titers These studies, together with the observations reported here, suggest that, while NOS II induction occurs in a \u017d variety of acute CNS viral infections leading to the hypothesis that consequent NO release may be a generalized . anti-viral defense mechanism , NO release actually plays a role in the innate immune response only in specific acute CNS viral infections.",

While it is clear that astrocyte 'activation' occurs with acute MHV-JHM infection, as seen by an increase in GFAP staining over the disease course, NOS II is not induced in these activated astrocytes. One role astrocytes may be playing during acute infection, which could contribute to the pathogenesis of this disease, is that of producers of chemokines, molecules contributing to the \u017d influx of inflammatory cells into the CNS Vanguri and . Farber, 1994; Hurwitz et al., 1995 . In this study, 7r8 spinal cords of mice with hindlimb paralysis and 1r4 infected but asymptomatic mice contained NOS II mRNA by PCR. The observation that one of the mice with clinical symptoms did not appear to express NOS II mRNA is most likely due to inter-animal variation in time course and quantitative expression of NOS II. One control animal also expressed NOS II; this expression could have been induced by some component of the experimental manipulation. Alternatively, viral infection in this animal may have induced a subclinical inflammatory response which nevertheless induced NOS II. Performing these experiments on larger numbers of animals would clarify these points. The fact that we observed a consistent pattern of NOS II expression by PCR in the animals ( ) studied which was confirmed by in situ hybridization and immunohistochemical studies supports the conclusion that NOS II is upregulated in persistently infected mice with hindlimb paralysis.",

Sherman et al., 1992 . Astrocytic expression of NOS II in demyelinated lesions from persistently infected animals supports this hypothesis.

Due to the relatively late temporal expression of NOS II, this NO release probably does not contribute significantly to the pathogenesis of acute disease. In contrast, NOS II expression and NO release may be a component of the innate immune response to persistent MHV-JHM infection and, via a 'bystander' effect, contribute to CNS injury. The lack of specific NOS II inhibitors has so far precluded definitive testing of this hypothesis. However, the availability of \u017d NOS II-deficient mice MacMicking et al., 1995; Wei et . al., 1995 now provides an opportunity to clarify roles for NOS II induction and NO release in MHV-JHM and other CNS viral diseases. \u017d . \u017d .
