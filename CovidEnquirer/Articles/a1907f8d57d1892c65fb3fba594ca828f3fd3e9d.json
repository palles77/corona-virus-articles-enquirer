Populations likely to be susceptible to new infectious diseases have also increased in size. The past three decades have seen outbreaks of diseases caused by parvoviruses, Nipah virus, circoviruses, and prions. Infectious pathogens such as these are formidable opponents; they can adapt to new hosts or cause variant diseases within new hosts. Many are also resistant to current inactivation techniques. In order to prevent or contain outbreaks, pathogens that emerge must be identified quickly and efficiently; research and ongoing global surveillance are therefore of primary importance. To effectively protect the blood supply and blood-based therapies, this research should include investigations into improved techniques for detection, screening, and viral inactivation, as well as into ways to reduce patient exposure to infectious pathogens via therapeutic agents. The proactive devotion of appropriate resources to infectious disease containment and prevention prior to an epidemic should be perceived as both essential public health policy and cost effective.

Emerging infectious pathogens in recent decades have included human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), avian/variant influenza, severe acute respi-ratory syndrome (SARS) virus, West Nile virus, dengue fever, monkeypox, parvovirus, Nipah virus, Ebola virus, and variant Creuzfeldt-Jakob disease (vCJD). Not all infectious diseases are a threat to the blood supply, because the clinical presentation associated with many infectious diseases is severe enough that infected patients are not likely to be blood donors. For example, the Ebola virus is blood-borne, but infected persons are not likely to donate blood because they become ill very quickly. However, other infectious diseases, such as HIV and vCJD, have long latent infectious periods during which persons can donate blood with no knowledge that they are infected. These latter types of infectious diseases as well as others with mild clinical sequelae have the potential to infect the blood supply through donation and be transmitted to the hemophilia community and other persons through blood products ( Figure 1 ).",

PVB19 typically causes a self-limiting febrile illness, erythema infectiosum, also called slapped cheek syndrome or Fifth disease. 5 However, in patients with immunosuppression or hematologic disorders, PVB19 can cause aplastic crises. 5 Parvoviruses are potential threats to human health and safety because they can alter their host-specific proteins and effect cross-species transmission. Feline parvovirus (FPLV), for example, which causes feline panleukopenia disease (ie, feline distemper), altered its host specificity, and in the mid to late 1970s there was an outbreak of a new disease in dogs with symptoms similar to feline distemper, including a high mortality rate. 3, 6, 7 The most widely accepted hypothesis is that mutations in FPLV (or a closely related virus infecting mink or foxes) caused the emergence of a new virus, canine parvovirus (CPV-2) 3 ; essentially, FPLV jumped species. There was no natural resistance to CPV-2 in dogs and the result was a rapid global epidemic 3 stopped within a year only by the development of a new vaccine for dogs and the use of the previously available cat vaccine. 7 The ability of parvoviruses or related viruses to mutate and cross to humans is particularly alarming because they are difficult to eliminate. Parvovirus and other non-lipid-enveloped viruses are highly resistant to the multiple viral inactivation protocols used in blood product processing, eg, pasteurization, heat treatment, and solvent/detergent techniques, that are effective against lipid-enveloped viruses. 8, 9 Parvovirus contamination has been extensively documented in animal products such as tryp- ",

The disease spread throughout Malaysia as farmers sold their pigs across the country. The resultant epidemic caused 265 cases of acute encephalitis and 105 deaths, a mortality of approximately 40%. 18 The new virus, identified as belonging to the Paramyxovirus family (measles and mumps), 19 was named Nipah for the village of origin. 18 Evidence suggests that the viral reservoir for Nipah is the fruit bat in whose urine Nipah has been isolated. It is conjectured that bats feeding on fruit in an orchard adjacent to a piggery in Nipah urinated and defecated onto the fruit; the pigs then ate the fruit and contracted the virus. The close proximity of the pigs in the piggery fostered pig-to-pig transmission. 18 The Nipah virus was transmitted to humans primarily through direct contact with infected pigs or contaminated pig tissue. 2 Pigs also transferred the Nipah virus to cats, dogs, and horses. 18 There have been epidemics of Nipah in Bangladesh in 2001, 2003, and 2004 20 ; although the source of the virus was unclear, Nipah-positive bats were found. 21 The evolution of the Nipah virus emphasizes the real threat of cross-species transmission.",

The circovirus family includes porcine circovirus (PCV), chicken anemia virus (CAV), and TT virus (TTV), which affects humans, although at this time TTV's ability to cause disease is unclear. Blood-borne TTV displays substantial genetic diversity and it is unknown whether genetic variability could lead to an increased potential to cause disease. Detection rates for TTV DNA in humans are very high and TTV infection may be universal 23 ; in fact, some individuals are infected with multiple genotypes of TTV. Although the potential repercussions of such infection are unknown, 24 TTV can be transmitted both by blood and by fecal-oral routes and there is debate about mother-infant transmission. 22, 23, 25 TTV is a particular concern because circoviruses demonstrate a high degree of plasticity, and animal circoviruses can cause severe disease in their respective hosts. In addition, circoviruses, which are non-lipid-enveloped and have small genomes, are very resistant to standard inactivation methods, including irradiation.",

One unit of the transfused blood was donated by a 24-year-old, who developed symptoms of vCJD 3 years and 4 months after the blood donation and died in 2000. In 2002, 6.5 years after the transfusion, the recipient manifested clinical symptoms of vCJD and died 13 months later. 28 In the second case, an elderly patient received a transfusion of red blood cells in 1999. The blood donor developed symptoms of vCJD 18 months after the donation and died in 2001; vCJD was confirmed at autopsy. The recipient patient died 5 years after the transfusion, but showed no evidence of a neurologic disease. Nonetheless, postmortem, the patient was shown to be positive for vCJD. 31 In response to the vCJD threat, the United Kingdom announced that patients with hemophilia and other congenital bleeding disorders were at risk for vCJD, 32 an announcement that has had notable financial and psychological impact, since patients with hemophilia and other congenital bleeding disorders who might be infected with vCJD are now considered capable of transmitting it to others. Therefore, the United Kingdom has implemented a new standard of care that includes disposal of those instruments used on patients with hemophilia that cannot be easily disinfected (eg, endoscopes, some dental equipment). 32 This new standard of care is very costly, and some dentists are refusing to treat patients with hemophilia.",

            "text": "Interventions to improve blood safety can be expensive. By comparing the cost of an intervention to the benefit given, the quality-adjusted-life year (QALY) can be calculated. To improve blood safety, the HIV antibody testing was developed and introduced in the mid 1980s. With 16 million transfusions each year in the United States, and an estimated prevalence of HIV of one in 10,000 blood donors, the cost per QALY for this intervention is calculated at $3,600. 34 By contrast, the cost per QALY for p24 antigen testing for HIV is estimated at $2.3 million and for HIV NAT at $2.0 million. This difference in cost-effectiveness reflects the decreasing prevalence of HIV in the blood donor population. 35 However, new defensive interventions could be very cost effective if (and when) a new blood-borne pathogen enters the blood supply ( Figure 2 ). 35 The costs of pathogen screening techniques must be considered in relation to the potential future costs for disease treatments in those who become infected. The medical costs associated with treatment of viral infections can be substantial: the costs involved in treating a patient with hemophilia co-infected with HIV are nearly 1.5 times greater than costs for those without co-infection. 36 Cost-effectiveness and cost-utility analyses are important for developing resource allocation decisions and many resources are used to ensure that transfusions of donated blood carry nearly \"zero risk.\" 35 Economic evaluations of techniques for ensuring blood safety show that interventions may not be cost effective, but these conclusions have limited impact on developing blood policy decisions; society appears to accept that the value of protecting a nation's blood supply from pathogen infection could transcend standard cost considerations. In addition, lessons appear to have been absorbed from the HIV epidemic, in which economics-based decisions could not control, and in fact inadvertently contributed to, the spread of the epidemic. Finally, policymakers fear litigation if their decisions with respect to infectious disease control are later shown to be irresponsible. 37 Continued vigilance may present a major financial burden, but is currently considered to be worthwhile in the face of the continuous emergence of new pathogens potentially transmissible through blood and blood products. It is important that this attitude be reinforced in the years to come, when the incidence of emerging pathogens is unlikely to diminish while the costs of pathogen control are likely to increase. ",
