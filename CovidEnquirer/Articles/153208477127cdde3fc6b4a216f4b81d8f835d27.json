New infections, such as the novel infl uenza A H7N9 or Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus, pay little heed to political boundaries as they spread; nature pays little heed to destruction wrought by increasingly frequent natural disasters. Hospital-acquired infections are hard to prevent and contain, because the bacteria are developing resistance to the therapeutic advances of the 20th century. Indeed, threats come in ever-complicated combinations: a combined earthquake, tsunami, and radiation disaster; black outs in skyscrapers that require new thinking about evacuations and medically fragile populations; or bombings that require as much psychological profi ling as chemical profi ling. Response requires up-to-date laboratories with genetic sequencing capabilities for infectious agents and rapid detection methods for chemical and radiological threats, nimble medical and epi demiological response units, and an alert and prepared workforce.",

            "text": "Public health information sharing has improved rapidly. So-called digital epidemiology has enabled practitioners and researchers to use electronic databases and information to enhance traditional surveillance methods. 5 In 2012, HHS launched its Now Trending developer challenge to create programmes for health departments to monitor social media during an outbreak. The challenge resulted in MappyHealth, a Twitter monitoring programme now being piloted for digital health surveillance around the country, helping offi cials examine real-time events. Digital surveillance was used by public health workers during the infl uenza A H7N9 outbreak to monitor Chinese social media for events, myths, and concerns. 6 Improvements in digital surveillance have also improved public communication. Local health departments that can monitor Twitter can give immediate feedback to correct dangerous mistruths that are contagious on social media. 7 CDC's @CDCEmergency Twitter feed, fi rst established during the infl uenza A H1N1 response, now reaches more than 1\u00b75 million people with emergency health information. During the Japan nuclear disaster response, Twitter was used to correct the dangerous myth that healthy people in the USA should take potassium iodide to prevent harm from radiation. 8 These technological advances have been developed in parallel with diplomatic information sharing advances. WHO's International Health Regulations and multilateral collaborations, such as the Global Health Security Initiative, have provided a framework for international cooperation during public health disasters. Improved capacity and the high priority placed on rapid information sharing led to China's timely reporting in 2013 of clinical and genetic information about infl uenza A H7N9 and early sharing of isolates, by contrast with the response to sudden acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) a decade earlier, when information was slower to emerge. 9,10 Cloud computing allowed for distribution of validated epidemiological and analytical programmes to the global community, while allowing China to share genomic sequences, providing the opportunity for immediate actions to analyse the viral genome and develop vaccine candidates. 6 The Public Health Emergency Medical Countermeasure Enterprise was established by HHS to coordinate federal eff orts and build new ways to respond to 21st century health threats-from discovery to deployment. The programme generated a government-wide strategic plan to build all-hazards capabilities and countermeasures throughout federal public health agencies.",
