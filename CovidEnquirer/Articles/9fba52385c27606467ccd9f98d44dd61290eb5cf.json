            "text": "This study aimed to explore the effect and mechanism of H. cordata vapor extract on acute lung injury (ALI) and rapid pulmonary fibrosis (RPF). We applied the volatile extract of HC to an RPF rat model and analyzed the effect on ALI and RPF using hematoxylineosin (H&E) staining, routine blood tests, a cell count of bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) content, van Gieson (VG) staining, hydroxyproline (Hyp) content and the dry/wet weight ratio. The expression of IFN-\u03b3/STAT 1 , IL-4/STAT 6 and TGF-\u03b2 1 /Smads was analyzed using ELISA, immunohistochemistry and western blotting methods. The active ingredients of the HC vapor extract were analyzed using a gas chromatograph-mass spectrometer (GC-MS), and the effects of the active ingredients of HC on the viability of NIH/3T3 and RAW264.7 cells were detected using an MTT assay. The active ingredients of the HC vapor extract included 4-terpineol, \u03b1-terpineol, L-bornyl acetate and methyl-nnonyl ketone. The results of the lung H&E staining, Hyp content, dry/wet weight ratio and VG staining suggested that the HC vapor extract repaired lung injury and reduced RPF in a dose-dependent manner and up-regulated IFN-\u03b3 and inhibited the TGF-\u03b21/Smad pathway in vivo. In vitro, it could inhibit the viability of RAW264.7 and NIH/3T3 cells. It also dose-dependently inhibited the expression of TGF-\u03b21 and enhanced the expression of IFN-\u03b3 in NIH/3T3. The HC vapor extract inhibited LPS-induced RPF by up-regulating IFN-\u03b3 and inhibiting the TGF-\u03b21/Smad pathway.",

However, the common characteristics of some new diseases, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) first studied in 2003, avian influenza first studied in 2008, and the swine influenza pandemic first studied in 2009, suggest that ALI may initiate these pathologies, and in acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) with rapid pulmonary fibrosis (RPF), ALI can be the most important lethal factor in the short-term [3] . Acute exacerbations of idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis and the mechanisms of repair and remodeling in acute lung injury have recently gained much attention [1, [4] [5] [6] . Based on the common characteristics and mechanisms of these diseases, we established a new RPF model that could be induced by ALI via a lipopolysaccharide (LPS) three-hit regimen and found that days 3-7 and 14-21 were two important time windows for RPF.",

HC water extracts had immunomodulatory and anti-SARS activities, as evidenced by the ability to significantly inhibit SARS-CoV 3C-like protease and RNA-dependent RNA polymerase [10] , which significantly and dose-dependently stimulated the proliferation of mouse splenic lymphocytes and increased the proportion of CD4 (+) and CD8 (+) T cells and the secretion of IL-2 and IL-10. The HC ethanol extract inhibited the expression of International Immunopharmacology 13 (2012) 331-340 IL-4 and IL-5 and the migration of TARC-induced Jurkat T cells. The injection of HC had a direct inhibitory effect on Pseudorabies herpesvirus (PrV) in vitro [11] , and HC was shown to be a selective COX-2 inhibitor [12] . The volatile chemical components of HC are its main pharmacologically active components [13, 14] . Therefore, the volatile extract of HC might be an alternative drug for treating RPF.",

IFN-\u03b3 expression decreased gradually from days 1 to 28 in the three HC groups, with the smallest decline observed in the H-HC group. The three HC groups showed high IFN-\u03b3 expression levels on days 7-21, suggesting that the HC vapor extract up-regulated IFN-\u03b3 secretion during days 7-21. This finding was consistent with the results of the western blotting (Fig. 4) and immunohistochemistry (Supplement Fig. 2 ) experiments and was further supported by the results from NIH/3T3 cells treated with HC. STAT1 is a downstream signaling molecule of IFN-\u03b3. Western blotting results showed that STAT1 expression was synchronized with IFN-\u03b3 expression in all groups on day 1. However, the synchrony was disrupted on day 7. IFN-\u03b3 expression in the HC groups was higher than that in the LPS and Dex groups on day 7, and STAT1 expression in the HC groups was lower than that in the LPS and Dex groups on day 7 (Fig. 4) , suggesting that HC might inhibit STAT1 expression through a non-IFN-\u03b3 pathway or that HC vapor extract might upregulate IFN-\u03b3 expression through a non-STAT1 pathway.",

The HC content of these four components was stable across groups, accounting for 80.61-91.68% of the total amount, with an average content of 86.99%. In contrast, other components were : the pulmonary interstitium broadened significantly, the number of collagen fibers increased, and the pulmonary interstitium was restructured. LPS on days 14-28 (C, D, \u00d7 100): the red collagen fibers thickened dramatically and formed bunches or sheets indicative of pulmonary fibrosis. Dex inhibited inflammation exudation dramatically. On day 1 (E, \u00d7 100), the collagen fibers in the alveolar spaces were normal, the alveoli were intact, and there were fewer inflammatory cells in the interstitial space and alveolar spaces. Dex on days 7 and 14 (F, G, \u00d7100): the pulmonary interstitium thickened, the inflammatory exudation in alveolar spaces increased, and the interstitial collagen fibers thickened. Dex on day 28 (H, \u00d7100): the interstitial space thickened and consolidated significantly, and the alveolar spaces narrowed. HC groups on day 1 (I, M, Q, \u00d7 100): the interstitial space was normal. HC on days 7 to 28 (N, \u00d7100): the pulmonary interstitial collagen fibers proliferated persistently, and the interstitial space thickened. L-HC group on day 28 (L, \u00d7100): the number of interstitial cells increased, and the alveoli narrowed. M-HC and H-HC groups (P, T, \u00d7100): the interstitial space thickened, and the number of collagen fibers increased significantly, but the alveoli were normal. present in smaller quantities (13.02 \u00b1 5.72%) and were not as stable across the groups, suggesting that they are not responsible for the main pharmacological effect. Therefore, we choose \u03b1-terpineol, L-bornyl acetate and methyl-n-nonyl ketone to study the potential pharmacological mechanism of the four components. Some reports [17] have proposed that sodium houttuyfonate (SH) was the effective component of HC. Thus, we used HC as the positive control. RAW264.7 and NIH/3T3 cells are typical immune and fibroblast cells, respectively. These are two important cell types involved in damage and repair. We observed the viability of RAW264.7 and NIH/3T3 cells after 24 h, 48 h, and 72 h of treatment with the HC vapor extract (10%, 30%, 50%; HC), \u03b1-terpineol (0.1 mg/ml, 0.5 mg/ml, 1 mg/ml), L-bornyl acetate (2.5 \u03bcl/ml, 5 \u03bcl/ml, 10 \u03bcl/ml), methyl-n-nonyl ketone (1 \u03bcl/ml, 2 \u03bcl/ml, 4 \u03bcl/ml) and SH (32 \u03bcg/ml, 64 \u03bcg/ml, 128 \u03bcg/ml). After 48 h, LPS (100 ng/ml), HC vapor extract, SH and \u03b1-terpineol inhibited the viability of RAW264.7 cells, but L-bornyl acetate enhanced viability significantly and dose-dependently (Fig. 6A ). In addition, HC vapor extract, \u03b1-terpineol and L-bornyl acetate inhibited the viability of NIH/3T3 cells significantly and dose-dependently (Fig. 6B) . We also observed the viability of cells 24 h and 72 h after being treated with LPS or without treatment with LPS.

            "text": "It has been suggested that Th2 polarization might be a necessary condition of ALI-induced fibrosis [16, 22] . In the LPS group, we observed Th2 polarizations. IFN-\u03b3 expression decreased consistently, and IL-4 and TGF-\u03b21 expression increased consistently, which further induced RPF. The period from days 3 to 7 constituted the first stage of RPF, and the second stage of RPF was from days 14 to 21. HC and Dex did not show obvious differences in anti-inflammatory and anti-fibrosis effects on days 3-7, and HC showed better anti-inflammatory and antifibrosis effects than Dex on days 14-21. Compared with Dex, HC appropriately improved immune stress status by up-regulating the lympocytes/mononuclear phagocytes ratio on day 7, which might be more advantageous (Fig. 1A and B) . IFN-\u03b3, as a Th1 cytokine with multiple functions, has proinflammatory, anti-viral and anti-fibrosis effects [23, 24] . IFN-\u03b3 inhibited influenza virus type A [25] and SARS-CoV replication [24] in vitro, suggesting that up-regulating IFN-\u03b3 may increase the survival of SARS patients. IFN-\u03b3 expression declined in the LPS group, suggesting that the immune system was suppressed to induce RPF. The HC vapor extract increased IFN-\u03b3 expression on days 7-21, and the results from the NIH/3T3 cells showed that \u03b1-terpineol might be the active ingredient of the HC vapor extract that up-regulates IFN-\u03b3 expression. The HCinduced up-regulation of IFN-\u03b3 expression was not accompanied by an up-regulation in STAT1 expression, suggesting that the HC vapor extract might inhibit the pro-inflammatory STAT1 pathway. Thus, the upregulation of IFN-\u03b3 might be an important mechanism through which HC reduces RPF.",

Smad7 reduces the expression of TGF-\u03b21-induced CTGF, which has a positive correlation with fibrosis [30] . IFN-\u03b3 promotes the activation of the JAK1/ STAT1 pathway, which inhibits TGF-\u03b21 signaling and subsequent collagen production through a Smad7-dependent pathway [31] .In summary, our investigation shows that the pharmacologically active ingredients of HC vapor extract might be \u03b1-terpineol and L-bornyl acetate, which reduced ALI and RPF, and that IFN-\u03b3 and the TGF-\u03b21/Smad pathway might be the pharmacological targets of HC.Supplementary data related to this article can be found online at http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.intimp.2012.03.011.",
