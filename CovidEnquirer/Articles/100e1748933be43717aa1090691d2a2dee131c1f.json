These alternative protein products are, as yet, poorly characterized structurally. Here we report the crystal structure of ORF-9b, an alternative open reading frame within the nucleocapsid (N) gene from the SARS coronavirus. The protein has a novel fold, a dimeric tentlike b structure with an amphipathic surface, and a central hydrophobic cavity that binds lipid molecules. This cavity is likely to be involved in membrane attachment and, in mammalian cells, ORF-9b associates with intracellular vesicles, consistent with a role in the assembly of the virion. Analysis of ORF-9b and other overlapping genes suggests that they provide snapshots of the early evolution of novel protein folds.",

Viruses also use specific strategies, such as RNA editing (Turelli and Trono, 2005) and splicing (Pongoski et al., 2002) , to enrich the diversity of viral proteins produced from the usually rather small viral genome. A particularly bizarre phenomenon, especially in RNA viruses, is the use of multiple start codons within a gene which gives rise to different protein products (Samuel, 1989) . The presence of these so-called alternative open reading frames (ORFs) and their translation has been shown to occur by several mechanisms (reviewed in Jackson, 1996) : leaky scanning, where the usual start codon of a gene is in an unfavorable sequence context, so that a fraction of ribosomal scanning complexes fail to initiate and continue scanning to the next start codon; internal ribosome entry sites; ribo-somal shunting (where, during scanning, ribosomal complexes translocate to a remote position on the mRNA and initiate translation there); and translational reinitiation after termination.",

            "text": "Recently, a coronavirus was identified as the causative agent of an emerging disease, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) (Ksiazek et al., 2003) . During its first outbreak in 2003, SARS led to at least 8000 infections and over 750 fatalities (Donnelly et al., 2003) . The SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV) genome consists of approximately 29,700 nucleotides encoding a predicted 28 proteins (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) , including several alternative ORFs. These occur in the 3 0 region of the genome, which encodes structural and accessory proteins that are involved in the assembly of the virus particle (see Figure 1) . Although the precise details of coronavirus assembly are not well understood, the consensus model is that the RNA genome is packaged in the cell cytoplasm by multiple copies of the relatively well conserved (Stadler et al., 2003) N-protein to form the nucleocapsid. The nucleocapsid then associates with the viral membrane proteins M, S, and E in the ER-to-Golgi intermediate compartment, where virus particles assemble and bud into the Golgi. In SARS-CoV, as in other group 2 coronaviruses, an additional protein is synthesized (called ORF-9b in SARS-CoV and internal or I-protein otherwise) from an alternative reading frame of the N-gene. In BCV, the I-protein is produced in an exact molar ratio with the N-protein (Senanayake and Brian, 1997) and in MHV it is present in the assembled virion, suggesting that it acts as an accessory structural protein in viral assembly (Fischer et al., 1997) . The MHV I-protein is not essential for the production of viable virus; however, it does confer a selective advantage for virus growth (Fischer et al., 1997) . Although little is known about the equivalent protein in SARS Co-V, antibodies against ORF-9b have been found in patients, demonstrating that it is produced during infection (Qiu et al., 2005) .",

Within this tunnel, the experimentally phased map shows a finger of electron density ( Figure 3A ) straddling the molecular dyad, separate from the protein portion of the map. Given the hydrophobic nature of the cavity, we interpreted this feature as an aliphatic molecule bound within the ORF-9b dimer. For the purpose of crystallographic model building and refinement, we have represented this ligand as a hydrocarbon molecule (the resolved electron density is consistent with an unbranched chain of ten carbon atoms; see Figures 3A and 3B). In order to identify the molecule bound in the tunnel, we carried out a mass spectrometry analysis (shown in Figure 3C ) which revealed a single molecular species of molecular weight 414 Da, significantly larger than expected from the visible electron density. The mass spectrometry data suggest that the ligand is a fatty acid (or fatty acid ester) containing approximately 25 carbon atoms. This is entirely consistent with the open architecture of the hydrophobic pocket of ORF-9b, which would allow such large hydrophobic molecules to be accommodated, with atoms hanging from the end(s) of the tunnel (invisible in our crystallographic analysis due to flexibility). The mass analysis is incompatible with the ligand being derived from the detergent present during cell lysis. This suggests that the ligand was picked up from the bacterial expression host and is tightly bound so that it remains associated with the ORF-9b protein during purification. In order to establish whether this was an artifact of the expression system used, refolding experiments (see Experimental Procedures) were performed, which demonstrated that-in the absence of lipid-the protein folds into molecules with hydrodynamic properties identical to those of the lipid-bound structure. Furthermore, thermostability assays (see Figure 3D ) show that refolded, lipid-free ORF-9b is slightly less stable than that purified from E. coli, consistent with lipid binding representing a thermodynamic phenomenon. (C) Surface electrostatic representation. In this view, the top of the structure is predominantly negatively charged (red), and the bottom is mainly positively charged (blue). The arrow indicates the opening of the hydrophobic tunnel. (D) Crystal contacts between ORF-9b molecules. Neighboring dimers are rotated w90\u00ba around their longest axis, and pack end to end via their b4b5 and b6b7 loops. This gives rise to an assembly reminiscent of a twisted rope. (E) Sequence alignment of SARS coronavirus ORF-9b and its homologs in mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) and bovine coronavirus (BCV). The alignment was performed using MultAlin (Corpet, 1988 ) and due to the very low level of sequence similarity should be regarded as provisional, pending a proper structurebased analysis. Residue numbering refers to the ORF-9b protein from SARS-CoV. Protein secondary structure is represented as yellow arrows (b strands), solid lines (random coil conformation), and dotted lines (disordered regions). Residues which line the hydrophobic tunnel of ORF-9b are highlighted in green. Magenta bars indicate residues which vary between different SARS isolates (see Supplemental Data for a detailed alignment). The figure was produced with ESPript (Gouet et al., 1999) .",

In this regard the higher order assembly of ORF-9b in the crystal, as interconnected twisted ropes (see Figure 2D ), may be partially recapitulated at the membrane surface, imparting some torque on the membrane.

As discussed above, several other, mainly group 2, coronaviruses (e.g., MHV and BCV) also have an alternative ORF in their nucleocapsid gene. There is good sequence conservation of the alternative ORF in these group 2 coronaviruses, but rather little similarity with SARS-CoV ORF-9b (see Figure 2E ). This intermediate relationship reflects the evolution of SARS-CoV, which has been suggested to be an early split-off from the group 2 coronavirus subfamily (see Figure 5A ) (Snijder et al., 2003) . Functionally, the ORF-9b homolog of MHV acts as an accessory structural protein that is not essential for viral infection but confers a small growth advantage (Fischer et al., 1997) , presumably explaining why non-group 2 coronaviruses can function without the protein. Taken together, these observations argue that the internal ORF of the N-gene of group 2 coronaviruses evolved after the N-protein (which, in contrast, is present and reasonably conserved in all coronaviruses; Stadler et al., 2003) . The most likely mechanism by which such an alternative ORF could arise would be as an ''accidental'' mistranslation of the N-gene that subsequently evolved into a structured and functional protein ( Figure 5B ). This hypothesis is consistent with the crystal structure (A) Differential interference contrast microscopy (gray) overlapped with epifluorescence using an anti-His fluorochrome-conjugated monoclonal antibody (red). The protein is associated with intracellular vesicular structures. (B) Partitioning experiment, in which the 293T cells expressing ORF-9b were fractionated into soluble (cytosolic) and insoluble/noncytosolic (nuclear, intravesicular, membraneassociated) phases. Western blotting with a specific antibody shows that ORF-9b is in the insoluble fraction, most likely membrane attached as suggested by (A).

Changes in the DNA sequence will therefore affect both the conventional and alternative ORF, limiting the rate and extent to which the corresponding proteins can evolve. The result will be a ''constrained evolution,'' an idea which has been demonstrated for regions of viral genes which (partially) overlap (Mizokami et al., 1997) . Because ORF-9b is entirely contained within its corresponding conventional gene, the constraint applies to the entire protein. The properties of coupled gene products are likely to be suboptimal compared to proteins that can evolve independently. In the early stages of the evolution of the alternative reading frame, this protein might be expected to be rather poorly folded, whereas eventually there would presumably be a balance, struck by selection, with both protein products being somewhat compromised. Thus, the structural disorder observed in ORF-9b (evinced in the considerable divergence of the eight noncrystallographically related molecules; see Table 1 ) may reflect its relatively recent invention and Snijder et al., 2003) . Based on their genome sequence, coronaviruses fall into three main groups. SARS-CoV is thought to be an early split-off from the group 2 lineage (indicated by a dashed circle). Alternative open reading frames of the nucleocapsid gene are found only in group 2 viruses, such as MHV and BCV (Senanayake and Brian, 1997) , as well as group 2-related viruses, including SARS-CoV. BCV, bovine coronavirus; HCoV-229E, human coronavirus 229E; IBV, infectious bronchitis virus; MHV, murine hepatitis virus; PDEV, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus; SARS-CoV, severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus; TGEV, transmissible gastroenteritis virus.",

Similar to ORF-9b, vpu encodes a small accessory protein which is present only in a subfamily of lentiviruses (namely, human immunodeficiency virus type 1, HIV-1). Although various molecular functions have been described for the protein, its precise role in HIV-1 pathogenesis remains unclear (Hout et al., 2004) .

These unusual structural and functional properties are probably a reflection of the distinct evolutionary trajectory of alternative open reading frames. Indeed, we propose that the constraints under which alternative open reading frames evolve give rise to characteristic structural features, most importantly the potential for novel folds and structural disorder.

The 2-fold symmetry axis lies in the plane of the paper, as indicated. (B) Cartoon of the residues lining the lipid binding pocket. The lipid is shown in ball-and-stick representation and the residues contributed by the two subunits are distinguished by the color of their contact symbols. (C) Mass spectrum of the extracted ligand molecule (designated M). Its molecular weight is 414 Da. In the mass spectrum, three significant peaks are observed, suggestive of proton (+1 Da), sodium (+23 Da), and potassium (+39 Da) adducts of a fatty acid molecule. The observed mass is consistent with a saturated long-chain hydroxy fatty acid C 25 H 50 O 4 (mass 413 Da), such as dihydroxy-pentacosanoate, or a nonhydroxy fatty acid ester C 25 H 50 O 4 (mass 413 Da)",
