Approximately one-half of patients had eczema and/or a family history of asthma; 86.4% had positive findings on nasopharyngeal virus swabs. Geometric mean time until medical readiness for discharge was 24.1 h (95% CI, 20.0-29.1) for the 78 magnesium-treated patients and 25.3 h (95% CI, 20.3-31.5) for the 82 patients receiving placebo (ratio, 0.95 [95% CI, 0.52-1.80]; P \u00bc .91). Mean bronchiolitis severity scores over time were similar for the two groups. The frequency of clinic visits in the subsequent 2 weeks (33.8% and 27.2%, respectively) was also similar. Fifteen magnesium recipients (19.5%) vs five placebo recipients (6.2%) were readmitted to the infirmary or hospital within 2 weeks (P \u00bc .016). No acute cardiorespiratory side effects were reported. CONCLUSIONS: IV magnesium did not provide benefit for patients with acute bronchiolitis and may be harmful.",

Nebulized magnesium has been tested in bronchiolitis; in a previous multicenter study report, nebulized magnesium sulfate with epinephrine was compared with nebulized epinephrine in infants with moderate to severe bronchiolitis, but patients with previous repeated courses of steroids or bronchodilators and/or family history of asthma were excluded. 21 Although there was significant improvement in respiratory distress assessment scores in the second and third day after admission favoring nebulized magnesium, no difference was found in the length of stay or need for oxygen. In a second small trial that enrolled patients with moderate bronchiolitis and compared nebulized magnesium, nebulized salbutamol, and nebulized magnesium sulfate/salbutamol combined, the only significant difference was the Wang severity score at 4 h, which favored the combined aerosol group compared with the nebulized magnesium alone group (P < .05). 22 Given the uncertainties about clear-cut efficacy for-as well as the amount of magnesium delivered by-nebulizing magnesium for the treatment of asthma, 23 we chose to use IV magnesium for the present study.

It is also possible that the bronchiolitis treatment practice in our center of using 5% hypertonic saline nebulization in all patients and systemic dexamethasone in selected patients 6, 7, 11 might have led to a disadvantageous drug interaction in the magnesium intervention group.",
