In 2012, the Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University and Shanghai Respiratory Research Institute established the first sleep center medical model, the ''Cloud Plus Terminal Medical Internet of Things Sleep Laboratory,\" which interacts with five district and community hospitals on the platform. The application of Cloud Plus Terminal Medical Internet of Things facilitates the early diagnosis and management of sleep respiratory disorders. Using this new healthcare model, patients can visit a community hospital, and yet receive high-quality healthcare service from the Zhongshan Hospital. This reduces the problem of overcrowding in large hospitals and assists community physicians to resolve the challenges inherent to the diagnosis and management of difficult cases. It realizes the prospect of ''The experts are linked by the cloud-The public enjoys modern medical treatment.\" For example, a successful wireless sensing pulmonary function meter has been developed at Zhongshan Hospital Fudan University, by which patients can complete lung function monitoring from home. 23, 24 Physicians can view the patient's lung function changes and recommend treatment based on the data, simultaneously, online, and propose a three-level linkage of mIoT models.

However, it is necessary to elucidate methods of faster learning and providing high-quality implementation interim guidance. In the management of lung nodules, we have gained extensive experience to prove that augmented reality (AR) technology based on the IoT 5A process is a technology that integrates virtual information with the real world. It uses a variety of technical means including multimedia, 3D modeling, real-time tracking and registration, intelligent interaction, and sensing to simulate computer-generated text, images, 3D models, music, video, and other virtual information, and apply these to the real world. Can play to the current level of different levels of the handicraft workshop-style diagnosis and treatment model upgraded to the national, and even international standards of modern flow ingesting works. 25, 26 This experience could also be easily applied to assisting SARI prevention and control.

Causes of death are related to sepsis, hypoxic respiratory failure, acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), multiple organ failure, and complications and pregnancy. If these complications can be addressed in a timely manner, early support for treatment and monitoring, and immediate oxygenation therapy for patients with respiratory distress, hypoxemia, or shock can undoubtedly reduce mortality. However, the large number of doctors participating in the rescue work, many with no corresponding experience, require the guidance of experienced experts; however, experienced experts are extremely limited. The IoT can assist in this task. With AR technology, experts and front-line physicians can perform and support consultations through AR, which can be easily and quickly completed without time, space, and location constraints, while reducing the probability of infection and avoiding the requirement of isolation after consultation.",

The numerous possible carriers of the virus are not isolated and become the next generation of infection. Ask them stay in their own homes or stay in community to reduce personal transmission. The guidelines suggest selfprotection including maintaining basic hand and respiratory hygiene, maintaining safe eating habits, and avoiding close contact with anyone who exhibits symptoms of respiratory diseases (such as coughing and sneezing). However, the effect of the execution of this guideline is not known and there is no quality control. Hence, there is an urgent requirement to apply the IoT to assist in the management of this group of patients. Compared with traditional medicine, mIoT can monitor the physiological and pathological state of the suspected patients throughout the process, reflecting the management advantages including providing personalized health solutions for different groups of people. Through the use of wireless sensor equipment and modern IT, patients can enjoy professional services, thereby ensuring the safety of suspected patients and also avoiding the infection of their families.",

In addition to the intelligent management of the classification model of disease risk, it is easy to process and classify large amounts of information.

This should be more conducive to achieving: ''easy to prevent, easy to diagnose, easy to treat diseases, and to easily communicate with experienced doctors.\" Community physicians can be advised in real-time by medical center experts through the cloud-plus terminal mIoT technology to achieve early diagnosis and optimal co-management of SARI patients.",
