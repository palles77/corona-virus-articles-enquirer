GU933027-GU933118. Sequencing of the 5\u2032 NCR region has been shown to accurately discriminate among subtypes of rhinovirus, including genotypes C and A2 (12) . All sequencing chromatograms obtained were edited manually to obtain contiguous fragments (contigs), by using Sequence Navigator software (Applied Biosystems). All sequences were screened at the National Center for Biotechnology Information website by using the Basic Local Alignment Search Tool (BLAST) (http://blast.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/Blast. cgi). HRV genotype was confi rmed by phylogenetic analysis as described below. Sequences generated and a set of reference strains representative of HRV genotypes, available in the GenBank database, were aligned by using ClustalW (www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/clustalw2). Minor manual adjustments were made to improve the alignment with BioEdit software (www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/BioEdit.html). The sequence of echovirus 11 was used as the outgroup. Phylogenetic analysis was performed with PAUP* version 4b10 (http://paup.csit.fsu.edu). Neighbor-joining and maximumlikelihood trees were constructed on the basis of appropriate nucleotide substitution models determined by Modeltest v3.7 (University of Vigo, Vigo, Spain). Bootstrapping was assessed by using 1,000 replicates. Trees were visualized by using the TreeView program (www.taxonomy.zoology. gla.ac.uk/rod/treeview.html).",

Our fi ndings, however, cannot be extrapolated to infants with CF, which were underrepresented in our study. These infants may be at greater risk of HRV-C respiratory infections as they are for with RSV infections (2) . Previous studies of respiratory virus infections in CF patients provided confl icting results on the potential effect of rhinovirus. Smyth et al. (15) , who evaluated respiratory exacerbations in CF patients, identifi ed rhinovirus as the leading agent, with exacerbations following a more benign course but resulting in greater use of intravenous antimicrobial drugs (15) . Olesen et al. (4) studied 75 CF patients for 1 year and used PCR to investigate the presence of 7 different viruses in sputum or laryngeal aspirates. The group reported that viral infections did not reduce lung function or increase respiratory symptoms. Rhinovirus was by far the leading agent identifi ed throughout their study (4) . A more recent study by Wat et al. (3) , in which they used real-time nucleic acid sequence-based amplifi cation in conjunction with molecular markers to investigate the presence of 9 respiratory viruses in children with CF, described an association of viral infections with respiratory exacerbations, particularly those caused by infl uenza A, infl uenza B, and rhinovirus (3).",
