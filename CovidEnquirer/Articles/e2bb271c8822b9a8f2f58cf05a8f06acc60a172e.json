We consider problems at the interface of models and data that pertain to interpreting patterns in observed outbreaks, and contributing to rational and robust assessment of risks posed by putative emerging pathogens. We assume that candidate zoonotic pathogens are circulating in some non-human reservoir population or populations, from which they can spill over to infect humans. Humans infected directly by animals are known as spillover or primary cases. If human-to-human transmission occurs, then subsequent cases infected by humans are termed non-primary.",

Another group includes microbes detected by 'pathogen discovery' in various non-human animal populations (Lipkin and Firth, 2013) , including many that are previously unknown to science (e.g. Anthony et al., 2013) , the relevance of which is often unknown.

In 'static reservoir emergence', the dynamics of the pathogen in the reservoir do not change from their long-term pattern. Because of chance or some change in human behaviour, the pathogen spills over from this static reservoir system to cause human infection. In 'dynamic reservoir emergence', the ecology of the pathogen in its non-human hosts changes substantially prior to emergence in humans; changes could include transmission into domestic animals, or gains in transmissibility due to evolutionary changes in the pathogen. However, while the conceptual differentiation between static and dynamic reservoir emergence is attractive, key case studies point much more towards dynamic emergence. For example, Nipah virus caused outbreaks in pigs prior to infecting humans (Parashar et al., 2000) and outbreaks of Sin Nombre virus infection (including the first identified outbreak) have been linked to elevated rodent population densities following periods of increased rainfall (Hjelle and Glass, 2000) .",

For instance, ecologic, economic or environmental factors giving rise to interactions among the three terms should be considered, and their dynamical consequences explored. Constructing more mechanistic models of spillover transmission will raise specific challenges, but may also present new solutions. For instance, when human infection occurs via environmental reservoirs, or through food, it may be possible to integrate many complexities of reservoir ecology into their impact on environmental burden, then use dose-response relationships to understand risk to humans. Otherwise, there can be many challenges associated with finding a relevant characterization of prevalence in the reservoir, particularly when the system involves multiple host species and multiple pathogen strains, each possibly posing different risks to humans. Transmission dynamic models that incorporate data from sequence-based or niche modelling approaches may help to predict spillover risk more generally.",

Thus there are opportunities to integrate a biostatistical approach to primary cases with a stochastic model of subsequent transmission, creating a joint inference framework. For example, primary infection with Nipah virus in Bangladesh is associated with drinking date-palm sap, while on-going transmission is associated with close contacts among humans (Gurley et al., 2007) . A joint framework that links these co-factors using a mechanistic model may aid in distinguishing between primary and non-primary cases (see Challenge 4). Studies of age-based mixing patterns have shed light on transmission dynamics of endemic pathogens (Mossong et al., 2008) ; there could be similar benefits to linking spillover risk factor information to data on mixing patterns in relevant human populations. Analogously, the coupling between spatial distribution of spillover risk and spatial factors influencing human-to-human transmission may govern the risk of a major outbreak (for instance, risk will be lower if spillover occurs chiefly in remote settlements than if it happens in crowded urban areas).",

However, numerous challenges persist. Because of historic interdisciplinary divisions, isolates from animals and humans have often been grown, detected or analyzed using different approaches, which effectively precludes useful inference. Pathogen isolates are often rare, particularly in difficult-to-culture genera, so isolates from linked cases are unusual. Animal sources of human spillover cases are often gone (dead, eaten, or moved away) by the time the human cases are detected and investigated, so that sequences come from other animal individuals that may not be closely linked. Any inferences about pathogen evolution must include uncertainty arising from (typically poorly known) transmission and evolutionary processes in animal hosts. This situation is particularly challenging if multiple species are involved in circulation of the pathogen, as for avian influenza. Many current examples are based on coarse sampling and use appropriately coarse analyses, such as phylogenies, but higher-resolution methods (preferably not sensitive to missing samples) will be needed as isolate detection improves. These methods will need to explicitly link transmission mechanisms to sequence evolution.",

These effects are often neglected for emerging pathogens, with the rationale that many hosts are available, but this assumption fails easily (Cross et al., 2007) . Non-stationary dynamics are also challenging: any changes through time arising from control measures or behaviour change will be entangled with non-stationarities driven by contact network effects (whereby the most connected individuals are infected early) or superspreading effects (whereby transmission rates revert to the mean after outbreaks are kicked off by superspreaders).",

There has been recent progress in methods to estimate R 0 based on the distribution of chain lengths (Blumberg and Lloyd-Smith, 2013a) or ratio of primary to non-primary cases (assuming these can be distinguished) (Cauchemez et al., 2013) . These approaches have complementary strengths and weaknesses, so hybrid or alternative approaches would be valuable. Also, little attention has been paid to the joint characterization of temporal variation in spillover hazard and human-to-human transmissibility. In some scenarios it may be possible to extract the contribution of subcritical human-to-human transmission, leaving a robust description of the spillover hazard itself -or conversely to extract the contribution of spillover and see the human-to-human transmission more clearly (Kucharski et al., 2014) .",

The frequency of singleton cases has surprising influence when R 0 and other parameters are estimated from chain size distributions (Blumberg and Lloyd-Smith, 2013b) . If R 0 can be estimated through other means, then measuring the frequency of singleton cases allows heterogeneity in transmission to be estimated (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005 ). An important challenge for the field is to improve reliability of singleton case data, and hence to incorporate these data into epidemiological analyses -or else to develop robust methods for parameter estimation that account for missing or biased data on singletons.",

If those most at risk of exposure to a zoonotic pathogen are those with the highest levels of immunity (because of multiple previous exposures), they could form an effective barrier preventing an infection from spreading to the rest of the population; such a pattern is seen for influenza antibodies in numerous studies of swine industry workers (Myers et al., 2006) . Data from this scenario might also lead to underestimation of the reproduction number of the pathogen if it spreads into a population that is truly naive. Models could help distinguish between pathogens that fail to spread because their transmissibility is low in all humans, versus those that fail because of low transmissibility in the human population in contact with the reservoir.

This is formally defined as the number of deaths from infection divided by the number of cases -but this clear-sounding definition hides a deep source of confusion in the definition of a 'case'. Often only severely ill cases are counted, leading to overestimation of case fatality rates. A basic tenet of infectious disease biology is that infection does not always lead to disease, and case fatality rates calculated with 'cases of disease' as the denominator can differ greatly from those calculated using 'cases of infection'. Such differences have led to widely varying estimates of case fatality rates for new emerging infections, with some corresponding alarmism, e.g. for pandemic H1N1 swine flu when it first emerged in 2009 (Garske et al., 2009) .",

However, to make sensible projections of the total expected mortality from novel infectious diseases, we need to move beyond hospital case fatality rates towards infection fatality rates that explicitly use the number of infections as the denominator. Estimating this quantity is challenging if many infections are asymptomatic or cause only mild illness. One possible solution is to use serology to estimate numbers infected; this was deployed in Hong Kong during the first wave of the 2009 H1N1 epidemic (Riley et al., 2011) , though challenges could arise from unknown background seroprevalence and delayed availability of serological data. An alternative is to estimate total numbers of infections from analyses of pathogen sequence data, which is possible in principle during the exponential phase of an outbreak (Frost and Volz, 2010) . Since pathogen sequences are often deposited in the public domain in real time during pandemics this might provide very early estimates of the numbers of infections, including those that are asymptomatic. Mathematical modelling could clarify what can be expected from such an approach. Given the numerous assumptions involved, would estimates of the numbers infected ever be accurate enough to make this approach useful? How many sequences are needed? Could we correct for sampling bias and heterogenous transmission? (see the challenges in phylodynamic inference, in this volume, Frost et al., 2015) . With the widespread availability of viral sequence from the 2009 H1N1 pandemic and a 'gold standard' estimate of infection rates from published serology, that event could be a testing ground for new methods for calculating infection rates and thus infection fatality rates.",

In particular, models can define what properties of novel pathogens need to be measured. Pathogen phenotypes are often assessed in animal models and modelling should be used to analyze such studies and shed greater light on their optimal design. For example, some influenza research has focused on infectiousness per unit time rather than the duration of infectiousness. Is this design sufficient to characterize risk?
