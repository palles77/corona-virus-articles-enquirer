Immunological and non-immunological defences of the gastrointestinal are impaired in early life. Consequently the gut of the preterm infant is predisposed to bacterial overgrowth. A wide range of pathogenic bacteria and viruses have been isolated from infants with necrotizing enterocolitis or detected histologically. The presence of bacterial metabolites in the breath, intestinal bullae (hydrogen) and urine (D-lactate) during the course of the illness is further confirmatory evidence. The presence of bacteria or bacterial products (such as exo-and endotoxin) in the circulation will lead to ischaemia of the intestine and other organs either directly or via mediators such as cytokines or platelet activating factor. Future studies in necrotizing enterocolitis should be directed to understanding and modulating inflammatory mediators in necrotizing enterocolitis and preventing the disease with breast milk and nutritional supplements (glutamine, short chain fatty acids), chemoprophylaxis, and antibodies.",

Bacterial toxins previously implicated in necrotizing enterocolitis are listed in Table 3 . Toxin A, produced by Clostridium difficile induced necrosis of intestinal mucosa in vivo and in vitro [27] the in vitro data indicating that a direct effect on the mucosa was responsible, rather than an effect on mucosal blood supply. The species has been implicated in necrotizing enterocolitis but is ubiquitous in healthy neonates [28] . Clostridium perfringens has been isolated from necrotizing enterocolitis and ]3-toxin is involved in the analogous conditions of pig-bel. E. coli producing heat-labile enterotoxin were associated with two clusters of necrotizing enterocolitis [29] . Scheifele's group has suggested that Staphylococcus epidermidis, which commonly colonize low-birth-weight infants including those with necrotizing enterocolitis produces a cell-damaging toxin resembling the delta toxin of Staphylococcus aureus. The cytotoxin can induce severe mucosal necrosis in rat intestinal loops [30] . They suggest that hypertoxigenic strains may be responsible for necrotizing enterocolitis. The effects of intestinal infections on mucosal blood supply have not been studied in detail, yet if such effects occur they could explain the link between mucosal infection and ischaemia. The anatomy of the microcirculation of intestinal villi of infant mice has been studied using a histochemical technique that specifically stained erythrocytes [31] . Over 8-14 days there was little variation between the same region of the gut with the exception of the distal ileum which was markedly less well perfused with erythrocytes in 8 day old mice than older mice. In the upper intestine, the capillary beds were more complex than in the middle and lower regions. If the anatomy of the villous microcirculation is duplicated in human villi, this may contribute to the vulnerability of the distal small intestine to ischaemia. Age-matched infant mice infected with rotavirus developed marked ischaemia and atrophy of the villi between 18 and 48 hours post infection [32] with preservation of the crypt microcirculation. Between 72 and 96 hours post infection, the capillaries of the small intestinal mucosa became engorged, with recovery of villous height. During this phase, the mucosa could have been subjected to a reperfusion injury. A second phase of villous atrophy followed between 120 and 144 hours which was less marked than the initial episode. The villous microcirculation recovered by I68 hours, and the diarrhoea ceased. These findings could explain how rotavirus infection could initiate necrotizing enterocolitis.",

IL-6 has been shown to be a better indicator of disease severity in other septic states although tumour necrosis factor release is essential for the initiation or amplification of IL-6 release. IL-6 and IL-1 are thought likely to be important mediators of the pathological effects of turnour necrosis factor [34] including endothelial cell damage caused by increasing the adhesiveness of neutrophils and endothelial cells endothelial rearrangement, production of a procoagulant factor by endothelial cells, reduced expression of thrombomodulin, increased production of interleukin 1, which can in turn activate leukocytes to initiate coagulation and stimulation of endothelial cells, polymorphs, and macrophages to produce platelet activating factor [35] . Future work should be directed to the investigation of the roles of endotoxin, cytokines and their mediators in the pathogenesis of necrotizing enterocolitis. In common with shigellosis, serum tumour necrosis factor concentrations were elevated in necrotizing enterocolitis compared with age-matched control infants [23] . Tumour necrosis factor levels did not correlate with severity or outcome. Larger, longitudinal studies are required to investigate the role of inflammatory mediators in necrotizing enterocolitis.",
