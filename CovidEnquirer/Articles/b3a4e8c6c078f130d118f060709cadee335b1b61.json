On the basis of the results described above, we looked for an RT problems, we performed two further experiments. First we changed the temperature of the reverse transcrip-primer that would fulfill two criteria. First, in order to synthesize cDNAs over 12.6 kb in length, the priming tion reaction from 42 to 45\u040aC in order to minimize the occurrence of ''less stringent'' priming events. However, site should be located at least 20 kb downstream from the 5 end of the HCV 229E genomic RNA. Second, this when we used this approach, we only obtained small amounts of the PCR product with the expected size of primer has to be highly specific, in order to minimize the occurrence of ''less stringent'' priming events dur-12.6 kb without diminishing the amount of the 3.9-kb PCR product (data not shown). The second strategy ing the reverse transcription reaction. Therefore, we chose RT-primer 32 at a concentration of 0.25 mM. The was to reduce the primer concentration in the reverse Optimization of the PCR cycle conditions. In parallel to the experiments described above, we set out to optimize the PCR cycle conditions, in order to improve the yield of long RT-PCR products. In most DNA template PCR protocols that aim to produce longer products, the elongation step is performed at 68\u040aC. Therefore, we repeated the RT-PCR reactions described above (Fig. 5, lanes 2-4) , but changed the elongation temperature from 72 to 68\u040aC. With this change, the amount of full-length (16.7 kb) PCR product synthesized is significantly increased (Fig. 5, lanes 5-7) . This result encouraged us to believe that it should be possible to effectively synthesize RT-PCR products longer than 16.7 kb.",

Our own using the following cycle profile: 94\u040aC, 15 s; 62\u040aC, 15 s; 68\u040aC, 12 min for 35 cycles with an initial 1-min major interest is the RT-PCR amplification of viral RNA sequences and the generation of infectious cDNA denaturation at 94\u040aC.
