            "text": "The genus Dickeya belongs to the family Enterobacteriaceae and is comprised of pectinolytic Gram negative plant pathogenic bacteria, responsible for the soft rot diseases worldwide. Due to their association with catastrophic diseases, Dickeya species have been listed among the top ten most destructive bacterial plant pathogens (Mansfield et al. 2012) . Soft rot Enterobacteria are also associated with the most serious problems facing potato production worldwide. The impact of soft rot disease varies from country to country; in the Netherlands, the annual estimated losses are around \u20ac30 million per year, while in Israel, potato yield losses of 20-25% have been observed. Symptoms caused by Dickeya spp. are more severe in high moisture and temperature environments (Czajkowski et al. 2009 ). Infected plants show stunting, chlorosis, wilting, black discoloration and soft rot, which begins at the stem base and progresses upward. Once infection has occurred, the pathogen colonizes the vascular tissues and moves throughout the plant (Raoul des Essarts et al. 2016); severe infections lead to whole plant collapse. Latent infections can result in severe losses during storage, especially in warehouses that lack refrigeration facilities (Laurila et al. 2008 ). In recent years, D. dianthicola has emerged as one of the most important pathogens infecting potatoes worldwide, and symptoms resemble those of blackleg caused by Pectobacterium species (Boluk and Arif 2019). Due to high economic impact in the European potato growing countries, D. dianthicola (syn. Erwinia chrysanthemi pv. dianthicola) has been listed in the EPPO A2 List of pests recommended for regulation as quarantine pests A2/53 (Pg 8); http://archives.eppo.int/EPPOStandards. At present, neither resistant varieties nor effective physical, chemical or biological controls have been reported to manage D. dianthicola diseases under field conditions (Czajkowski et al. 2014) . Only preventive measures are recommended, which include planting certified seeds, eradicating contaminated plant materials, screening for latent infections, monitoring appropriate storage conditions and inspecting fields (Motyka et al. 2017) . Therefore, early, accurate and sensitive detection of Dickeya species is important to identify inoculum sources before they become a problem. TaqMan qPCR assay for detection of Dickeya spp. and described a number of primer pairs to detect different Dickeya sp. TaqMan qPCR with the probes labelled with different fluorogenic dyes enables simultaneous detection of multiple pathogens or pests in a single tube (Arif et al. 2015) . Multiplex TaqMan can be very useful for detection of different Dickeya species, which produces nearly indistinguishable disease symptoms without compromising the sensitivity and specificity of the assay.",

DNA concentration and purity were measured using NanoDrop 2000/c spectrophotometers (Thermo Fisher Scientific Inc., Worcester, MA). The genomes of all Dickeya, and Pectobacterium species were aligned separately with progressive Mauve ( Pectobacterium Pec.dnaA-F1 (5'-CATACGTTTGATAACTTCGTTG-3') and Pec.dnaA-R1 (5'-GATGTCGTGGCTTTCTTCAC-3') primers were used to amplify the dnaA gene region of Pectobacterium species. The identity of other bacteria listed in the exclusivity panel was confirmed using primers P16s-F1 and P16s-R1 targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA region. The PCR conditions used for Dickeya and Pectobacterium dnaA gene amplifications were: Initial denaturation at 95 \u2022 C for 5 min followed by 35 cycles with 95 \u2022 C for 20 s, 58 \u2022 C for 1 min, 72 \u2022 C for 1 min and a final extension at 72 \u2022 C for 3 min.

Sequencing was performed at the GENEWIZ facility (Genewiz, La Jolla, CA) for both sense and anti-sense strands. Obtained sense and antisense strands of each strain were aligned, manually edited and the error free consensus sequence was used to confirm identity by comparing the sequences of each strain against the NCBI GenBank nucleotide and genome databases using NCBI BLASTn tool. Sequences generated from each strain were deposited in the NCBI GenBank database and the accessions numbers are listed in Table 1 . Consensus sequences of 46 strains used in this study were aligned to generate a phylogenetic tree. Phylogenetic relationships among the strains was generated using the Neighbor-Joining method and the evolutionary distances were calculated using Tamura The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder.

Whole genomes were aligned using progressive Mauve (2.4.0) and Geneious (10.2.3). Generated locally Collinear Blocks (LCBs) were analyzed to search unique and conserved regions for the genus Dickeya and D. dianthicola. The galactose/methyl galactoside ABC transporter ATP-binding protein MglA/MglC region was used to design the primers and probe specific for the genus Dickeya. Similarly, for D. dianthicola, the genomes of D. dianthicola (NZ_CM001838, NZ_CM001840, NZ_CM001841 and NZ_CM002023) were retrieved from the NCBI GenBank Genome database (Supplementary Table 1 ) and aligned using progressive Mauve; Geneious was used for analyzing the unique genes present in the D. dianthicola genome. The alcohol dehydrogenase gene was used to design the primers and probe specific for D. dianthicola. Table 2 . No flap sequences were added to the probes. The specificity of each primer was confirmed in silico using the BLASTn tool against the NCBI GenBank nucleotide and genome databases ( Table 2 ).

Mauve-based progressive whole genome alignments enabled the gene selection for the Dickeya species and D. dianthicola. The alcohol dehydrogenase gene region was identified as a signature gene region present in the core genome of D. dianthicola and was used for designing the robust primers and probe specifically amplifying this species. Furthermore, the galactose/methyl galactoside ABC transporter ATP-binding protein mglA/mglC region was identified as a unique target for designing the primers and probe amplifying all known species of genus Dickeya (Figure 1 ).

Dickeya species, especially D. dianthicola, is a major problem for potato growing countries, and therefore is included in the European Union A2 quarantine list of pathogens.

Detection by culturing and isolation is time-consuming, especially when the pathogen can be overgrown by saprophytic bacteria commonly present in infected samples. PCR provides fast, robust and accurate detection of pathogens compared to traditional culture-based methods.

The 5' AT-rich flap sequences were added to both primers sets, DICg F1/R1 and Ddia F1/R1, to evaluate their effects on sensitivity and/or specificity of the developed assay. Both primers with and without 5' AT-rich flap sequences, targeting the Dickeya species and D. dianthicola, were specific for respective pathogens; no cross-reactions were observed (data not shown). Both multiplex primer sets, DICg F1/R1wf and Ddia F1/R1wf, with 5' AT-rich flap showed optimum reaction efficiency compared to the primers with no flaps ( Figure 5 ) and were sufficiently sensitive to detect the genomic DNA of D. dianthicola and Dickeya species down to 10 fg. However, primers with no flap showed some discrepancy among the replicates at the lowest concentration (10 fg; DICg F1/R1). Therefore, both primers with the 5' flap sequences were used for overall validation of the developed multiplex TaqMan qPCR assay. The addition of the 5' AT-rich flap also made the primers and probes compatible to mix and match based on user's need without losing specificity and/or sensitivity; these primers work under the \"One Lab -One Protocol\" concept (Arif 2019).",

The probes labelled with internal ZEN quencher along with the traditional 3'end quencher enhance quenching efficiency, provide less background noise and increase precision ). Multiplexing the reaction with different primer and probe sets can adversely affect the sensitivity and can increase the background noise (Li et al. 2017 ). However, the developed assay did not show any discrepancy in the detection limit when assays were performed individually as compared to the multiplex reaction; both detected 10 fg of genomic DNA. The presence of plant DNA mixed with pathogen DNA has been reported to interfere with the Taq DNA polymerase due to the presence of strong DNA-binding domains, reducing Taq-polymerase availability and activity, which results in higher Ct values (Hoy et al. 2001; Strayer et al. 2016) . Therefore, the spiked assays were performed by adding the DNA from healthy plants along with target pathogen DNA in the multiplex qPCR reaction. No adverse effect on the Ct values was observed -the detection limit remained the same (10 fg) as with the pure genomic DNA from D. dianthicola. The genome size of Dickeya species ranges from 4.62-5.05 Mb (supplementary Table 1 ). Based on the calculations, 10 ng of D. dianthicola genomic DNA contains 1.93X10 6 copies, therefore, 10 fg should be equivalent to ~ 2 copies. The sensitivity of the developed multiplex TaqMan qPCR is higher (10 fg per reaction; Ct=33.75\u00b10.24 compared to the previously reported primers/assays by Potrykus et al. (2014) for Dickeya species (detection limit 10 pg per microlitre) and van der Wolf et al. (2014) for D. dianthicola (20 fg per reaction; Ct=36.5\u00b10.38).",

The genus Dickeya originally included six species: D. chrysanthemi, D. dadantii, D. dieffenbachiae, D. dianthicola, D. paradisiaca, and D. zeae (Samson et al. 2005). Later, D. dieffenbachiae was reclassified as a subspecies of D. dadantii based on the DNA-DNA hybridization and phylogenetic analyses (Brady et al. 2012). Dickeya now has eight species including, D. solani (Van der Wolf et al. 2014), D. aquatica (Parkinson et al. 2014) and the recently described D. fangzondai (Tian et al. 2016). Dickeya species have a broad host range, infecting both monocots and dicots (Ma et al. 2007). They are responsible for soft rots of vegetables and ornamentals, resulting in high economic losses in various geographical locations worldwide (Van Vaerenbergh et al. 2012).",

Detection based on molecular methods such as PCR, quantitative PCR and loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) are implemented routinely due to their high sensitivity, speed, specificity, accuracy, discriminatory ability and reproducibility (Ouyang et al. 2013; Czajkowski et al. 2015; Ocenar et al. 2019). TaqMan probe-based qPCR assays are more accurate, sensitive and reliable for detection of a pathogen (Arif et al. 2014). Moreover, addition of 5' AT-rich flap sequences enhanced the reaction efficiency and sensitivity of multiplex TaqMan qPCR (Arif and Ochoa-Corona 2013; Larrea et al. 2019). TaqMan qPCR assays have been reported for the detection of D. solani using fliC gene, and D. solani and D. dianthicola using targets based on computational primer prediction pipeline for draft bacterial genomic sequences (Vaerenbergh et al. 2012; Pritchard et al. 2013).

TaqMan real-time qPCRs have been developed for the detection of D. solani and D. dianthicola (Van Vaerenbergh et al. 2012; Pritchard et al. 2013), but these protocols have not been thoroughly validated. TaqMan qPCR assays for Dickeya species using the dnaX gene region have been reported by van der Wolf et al. (2014). However, the assay developed using dnaX gene sequence for detection of D. solani was insufficiently specific and found not to be suitable for testing propagative material (van der Wolf et al. 2014). Therefore, the whole genome comparative genomics approach was used to develop robust primers and probe sets using highly unique and conserved genes. Multiplexing the reaction using different probes labeled with different fluorogenic dyes allows detection of multiple targets in a single reaction which facilitates rapid detection, reduces assay costs and enhances assay reliability (Arif et al. 2015; Larrea et al. 2019).
