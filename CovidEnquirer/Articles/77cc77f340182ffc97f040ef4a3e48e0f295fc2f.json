            "text": "Ventilator-associated respiratory infections (VARIs) may be manifested as tracheobronchitis (VAT) and ventilator-associated pneumonia (VAP). 1-6 VARI is usually caused by bacteria colonizing the patient's oropharynx or stomach that enter the lower respiratory tract around the endotracheal tube cuff or through the lumen. 1, 3, 4 Initial antibiotic management of VARI is complicated by delays in identification and antibiotic sensitivity data for a wide spectrum of potential pathogens that are increasingly multidrug-resistant (MDR). 4 Placement of an endotracheal tube facilitates bacterial entry into the lower respiratory tract, impairs bacterial clearance by host defenses, and increases the risk of VAP 6-fold to 20-fold. 1 The differentiation between VARI and colonization is initially based on the presence of clinical signs and symptoms suggesting infection, such as fever, purulent sputum, and elevated peripheral leukocyte counts. Microbiologic data are also critical, but specific criteria vary with the sampling method and type of sample. For example, endotracheal aspirates (EAs) are readily available in intubated patients and bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or protected specimen brush (PSB) technique. 1, 4, [7] [8] [9] [10] Gram-stained EA might assist diagnosis of VARI and is employed in many hospitals and intensive care units. The presence of polymorphonuclear leukocytes (PMNL) indicates possible inflammation or infection, whereas information about bacterial morphology may suggest likely pathogens. Culture of the EA either by a quantitative (Q-EA) or semiquantitative methods (SQ-EA) is used to distinguish colonization from VARI. 2, 4, 7 Identification and sensitivity data are usually available within 48 to 72 hours.",

The authors' primary aim is to clarify current diagnostic criteria to diagnose VAT and VAP versus tracheal colonization and to underscore specific clinical and microbiologic clues that could lead to earlier, appropriate antibiotic treatment of VARI. 3, 7, 8, 12 EPIDEMIOLOGY VAT and VAP are defined as infections that occur more than 48 hours after intubation. 1, 3, 4, 7 Early VAP occurs within the first 5 days of intubation. Late-onset VAP occurs after 5 days, is more commonly caused by MDR pathogens, and carries higher morbidity and mortality ( Table 1) . The reported crude mortality rate for VAP ranges from 20% to 50%, and health care costs are estimated to be $15,000 to $40,000 per episode. 1, 4, 13 In a recent study of outcomes of 126 intensive care unit (ICU) patients who received long-term ventilation in 5 ICUs at Duke University, the survival rate at 1 year was 56%, and only 9% of the patients were not in dependent care. Many patients had multiple admissions to a spectrum of transitional care facilities, with an estimated cost of $3.4 million dollars per patient. 14 Medical and surgical patients diagnosed with VAT also experience a significantly longer length of ICU stay and duration of mechanical ventilation with possible progression to VAP. 2 The incidence of VAT in Europe has ranged from 2.7% to 10%, depending on the population studied. 3 A recent study in the United States, using a different model and definitions, reported an incidence of VAT of 1.4%, compared with a 4.0% incidence of VAP. 6 However, 32% of patients with VAT progressed to VAP.",

Furthermore, ETT biofilmencased bacteria may also contribute to lower airway infection from biofilm emboli. 17, 18 The numbers, type, and virulence of bacterial pathogen(s) entering the trachea, as well as host defenses, are important factors in disease progression. In addition to a wide spectrum of potential pathogens, bacterial virulence may vary within the same bacterial species. 19, 20 Mechanical host defenses (mucus and cilia), polymorphonuclear leukocyts (PMNLs), and macrophages with their respective cytokines, work in conjunction with humoral antibodies (eg, immunoglobulin M [IgM], IgG, and IgA) and complement to prevent progression of colonization to VAT or VAP. 4, 21 ",

Similar problems with chest radiograph interpretation and specificity have been noted by others. 27, 30, 31 Data suggest that computerized tomography (CT) lung scans provide better resolution, but also have limitations, and are not readily available in many ICUs. Interpretation of chest infiltrates in critically ill patients could be improved with the use of CT lung scans, but this may be impractical for many ICU patients. In addition, the dose of radiation exposure is high and is equivalent to greater than100 portable chest radiographs. 32, 33 Based on these clinical and radiological reservations, microbiologic criteria become the cornerstone for the diagnosis of VAT or VAP due to aerobic bacterial pathogens (see Table 2 ).",

Radiology clues may help to discriminate VAP from VAT based on the presence or absence of a new pulmonary infiltrate. By comparison, microbiology clues differ depending on the diagnostic methodology employed. Note that the significant growth of pathogen on bronchoscopic-bronchoalveolar lavage (B-BAL!10 4 cfu/mL), nonbronchoscopic BAL (N-BAL>10 4 cfu/mL), or protected specimen brush (PSB!10 3 cfu/mL) is diagnostic for VAP. Absence of significant growth (B-BAL<10 4 cfu/mL, N-BAL<10 4 cfu/mL, PSB<10 3 cfu/mL) is consistent with VAT or colonization. When endotracheal aspirates (EAs) are used for diagnosis, it is difficult to discriminate between VAT and VAP, but they are helpful for distinguishing between colonization and infection (VARI).",

Dallas and colleagues 6 have suggested a threshold of Q-EA greater than or equal to 10 5 cfu/mL. SQ-EA with moderate (111) or many (1111) growth also correlated with few-to-moderate bacteria present on Gram-stained smears of EA. 7,10,35 El-Ebiary and colleagues 8 reported that although Q-EA at greater than 10 5 cfu/mL had good sensitivity and specificity, Q-EA was less specific than PSB and BAL for diagnosing VAP. Nseir used a Q-EA result of greater than 10 6 cfu/mL for the diagnosis of VAT, because it had better specificity than 10 5 cfu/mL. 12 The lack of accepted universal definitions and microbiological benchmarks for assessing Q-EA and SQ-EA is unfortunate as it is often based on the sensitivity and specificity of the criteria compared with a gold standard that remains elusive. Specific definitions are critical, not only for patient care, but also for surveillance, assessing the efficacy of prevention strategies, public reporting, improving patient outcomes, and reducing health care cost.",

VAT was defined as the production of at least 2 mL of purulent EA over a 4-hour period with a Gram stain demonstrating bacteria. Systemic antibiotics were given at the discretion of treating physician and frequently prescribed in both groups. Compared with the placebo group, the aerosolized antibiotic group had significantly better outcomes, manifested as lower rates of clinical signs and symptoms of VAP, faster weaning of the ventilator, reduced numbers of MDR pathogens, and lower use of systemic antibiotic, with all endpoints, P<.05. Notable limitations of this study included the definition of VAT, lack of Q-EA, high numbers of patients who had prior VAP, lack of data on radiographic signs of VAP, small numbers of study patients, and potential confounding effect by the use of systemic antibiotics. Different results were reported by Dallas and colleagues 6 in a retrospective study of VAT and VAP in medical and surgical ICU patients. Dalllas and colleagues reported that VAT occurs less commonly than VAP when using an EA cutoff of 10 5 cfu/mL. Most patients had MDR pathogens; patients diagnosed with VAT frequently progressed to VAP and VAT, and VAP patients had similar mortality (19% vs 21%).

However, for intubated patients, the use surveillance EA may provide earlier information on colonization with MDR pathogens that could be used for targeted antibiotic therapy.

The purpose of this communication is to highlight the importance of microbiologic clues to aid clinicians in distinguishing between infection and colonization. The authors' goal is to drive down rates of VARI and to emphasize prevention strategies to decrease rates or VAT or VAP. Strategies to improve outcomes include early identification of infection, avoiding intubation, removing endotracheal tubes as soon as possible, use of sedation vacation, treating infections early, and limiting inappropriate antibiotic use.",
