Virulent TGEV infection leads to severe vomiting, acute villous atrophy, malabsorptive diarrhoea and dehydration, which approach 100% mortality in seronegative suckling pigs. Even older piglets that recovered from virulent TGEV infections had impaired immune function (Woods, 2001) . However, the piglets exposed to attenuated TGEV only had mild clinical signs and low mortality (Frederick et al., 1976) . We presume that the interaction of TGEV with the immune cells has an important role in this pathogenesis.",

            "text": "Dendritic cells (DCs), the most powerful antigenpresenting cells (Ardavin, 2003) , are widely distributed in the mucosal tissue, which forms an extensive network monitoring the invasion of pathogens (Haverson et al., 2000) . Studies have demonstrated that viruses were directly or indirectly sampled by intestinal DCs (Rescigno et al., 2001) . Thus, DCs are proposed to be among the first cells encountered after mucosal exposure to viruses. TGEV mainly infects and replicates in the porcine intestinal , through uptake and presentation of antigens to T cells, initiate distinct immune responses to different infections. In this study, an attenuated TGEV (STC3) and a virulent TGEV (SHXB) were used to determine whether porcine DCs play an important role in pathogenetic differences between these two TGEVs. Our results showed that immature and mature monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) were susceptible to infection with SHXB and STC3. However, only SHXB inhibited Mo-DCs to activate T-cell proliferation by down-regulating the expression of cell-surface markers and the secretion of cytokines in vitro. In addition, after 48 h of SHXB infection, there was the impairment in the ability of porcine intestinal DCs to sample the antigen, to migrate from the villi to the lamina propria and to activate T-cell proliferation in vivo. In contrast, these abilities of intestinal DCs were enhanced in STC3-infected piglets. In conclusion, our results show that SHXB significantly impaired the functions of Mo-DCs and intestinal DCs in vitro and in vivo, while STC3 had the opposite effect. These differences may underlie the pathogenesis of virulent and attenuated TGEV in piglets, and could help us to develop a better strategy to prevent virulent TGEV infection.",

            "text": "epithelial cells and must interact with the intestinal DCs. Recent studies have been suggested that the interaction between DCs and the different virulence of viruses plays an important role in the induction or inhibition of the immune response. Highly pathogenic avian influenza (HPAI) infection of chicken DCs could produce a lower level of cytokine in contrast to low pathogenic avian influenza (LPAI) infection (Vervelde et al., 2012) . Lassa virus infection of human DCs could inhibit the upregulation of surface marker expression and the development of an adaptive immune response, while the related naturally non-virulent arenavirus Mopeia virus (MV) infection of DCs could increase the transcription of type I IFN mRNA, IL-12 mRNA and CXCL-10 mRNA and induce stronger T-cell responses (Baize et al., 2004; Pannetier et al., 2011) . Similarly, virulent varicella-zoster virus (VZV) subverted secretion of Th1 cytokines in human DCs by blocking TLR2mediated innate signals, while the attenuated VZV vaccine strain enhanced secretion of Th1 cytokines (Gutzeit et al., 2010) . Thus, different responses of DCs to the virulent and attenuated virus may underlie the differences in pathogenicity between them. Whether the varied morbidity and mortality in piglets caused by the differing virulence of TGEV infections is associated with the intestinal DCs is still unclear. In this study, the virulent TGEV (SHXB) and attenuated TGEV (STC3) strains were first used to infect porcine monocytederived dendritic cells (Mo-DCs) in vitro and evaluate the abilities of Mo-DCs to take up and present the antigens of the different virulent strains of TGEV, and stimulate the Tcell responses. Second, the SHXB and STC3 strains were used to infect the piglets in vivo in order to further determine whether they could damage the ability of intestinal DCs to sample the heat-inactivated Escherichia coli, migrate, and stimulate CD3 + , CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell proliferation at 48 h postinfection. Understanding these events may provide a theoretical basis for the study of the differences in pathogenesis of virulent and attenuated TGEV infection in pigs.",

When compared to the immature Mo-DCs, mature Mo-DCs stimulated by LPS significantly upregulated CD1a and SLA-II-DR expression ( Fig. 2A and B) . However, the expression of CD1a clearly decreased in the immature and mature Mo-DCs infected with SHXB compared with the others, and the expression of SLA-II-DR in the immature Mo-DCs infected with SHXB was also lower than others ( Fig. 2A and B) . The level of CD1a and SLA-II-DR in the immature and mature Mo-DCs infected with STC3 was similar with the control immature Mo-DCs ( Fig. 2A and B) . The results also showed that CD80/86 expression in the immature and mature Mo-DCs infected with SHXB and STC3 remained unchanged ( Fig. 2A and B) . The downregulation of co-stimulatory molecules on immature and mature Mo-DCs may be a mechanism for virus immune escape for impairing DCs maturation, which may render Ag-specific T cells anergy or suppress the T-cell response. Next, the SHXB and STC3 infection did not induce the early and late apoptosis of the immature and mature Mo-DCs (Fig. 2C) , which indicated that the downregulation of surface makers on immature and mature Mo-DCs infected with SHXB was not related to the apoptosis induced by the SHXB.",

Next, the model antigen (the heat-inactivated E. coli) was used to further determine whether SHXB and STC3 could influence the functions of intestinal DCs.

A previous study showed that the virulent TGEV robustly infected and rapidly destroyed the villous epithelial cells in the porcine small intestine to cause the rapid death of piglets, while the attenuated virus had a poor ability to infect and evoke the sickness of the piglets (Kim and Chae, 2002) .

The phenomenon has been reported in the classical swine fever virus (Carrasco et al., 2004) and the PRRS virus (Peng et al., 2009) . It is known that DCs present antigen with CD1a or SLA-II-DR as the first signal and CD80/86 as the second costimulatory signal to activate T cells (Bertram et al., 2004) . SHXB may act by inhibiting Mo-DC maturation, because it significantly down-regulated the expression of CD1a and SLA-DR-II on the immature and mature Mo-DCs. Why did SHXB cause a reduction in CD1a and SLA-DR-II on the mature Mo-DCs? It is possible that virus infection resulted in a loss of TLR-4, which is essential for LPS responsiveness (Poltorak et al., 1998) . The surface markers of STC3infected immature and mature Mo-DCs changed slightly (Fig. 2C) , which implied that STC3 caused a weak injury on the Mo-DCs. Similarly, the expression of CD40, CD80, MHC I and MHC II did not significantly change in chicken Mo-DCs infected by low pathogenicity avian influenza (LPAI), while the markers notably decreased on Mo-DCs infected by high pathogenicity avian influenza (HPAI) (Vervelde et al., 2012) . In addition, there was a negligible change in CD80/86 expression on immature and mature Mo-DCs infected by SHXB or STC3. This suggested that virulent TGEV inhibit Mo-DCs maturation through decreasing the antigen-presenting molecules, rather than the co-stimulatory molecules. Furthermore, the downregulation of surface markers on the Mo-DCs infected with SHXB was not caused by their apoptosis.",

            "text": "Cytokine response induced by virus-infected Mo-DCs is another critical process that results in presenting viral antigens to activate T cells. IL-12, believed to be the principal Th1-type cytokine, is necessary for cell-mediated immunity (CMI) (Barchet et al., 2006) . IFN-g plays an important role in inducing immunostimulatory and immunomodulatory effects (Chen et al., 2009) . IL-10 is a predominant Th2-type cytokine that can downregulate IL-12 production and CMI (Yang et al., 2007) . In this article, the promotion of IL-12 and IFN-g secretion both in immature and mature Mo-DCs infected by SHXB and STC3 strains implied that Mo-DCs developed Th1 immune responses to TGEV infection, which was similar to the report that Rotavirus (RV)-infected DCs promote their capacity to induce the polarisation of allogenic naive T cells towards a Th1 response (Narvaez et al., 2005) . However, the virulent SHXB only produced a slight of IL-12 and IFNg, as little as possible to make the Mo-DCs clear themselves, while STC3, as a vaccine strain, induced the secretion of considerable cytokines to improve the immature Mo-DCs' immune response. A recent report showed that only when the amount of a virulent virus reached a threshold, called virulence threshold, its virulence reached the strongest (Lancaster and Pfeiffer, 2012) . In this study, it might because the number of SHXB did not reach its virulence threshold in the mature Mo-DCs, like the attenuated STC3 strain, thus no difference in the expression of IL-12 and IFN-g in SHXB-and STC3-infected mature Mo-DCs was found in our work. The STC3 and SHXB strains failed to stimulate IL-10 secretion on the immature and mature Mo-DCs. Because DCs are central to the development of the acquired T-cell response, pathogens have evolved mechanisms to reduce the capacity of infected DCs to prime the adaptive immune response. Virulent SHXB infection inhibits Mo-DC maturation and secreting cytokines, so that infected Mo-DCs are potentially less able to stimulate T-cell responses, like dengue virus (DV) (Dejnirattisai et al., 2008) . However, attenuated STC3 was unlike SHXB because it induced the Mo-DCs to stimulate T-cell proliferation at a DC/T ratio of 1:1. For the phenomenon that there is a minor but significant difference between the SHXB and STC3 infected mature cells only at a ratio of 1:1. It might that STC3 did not inhibit the expression of CD1a in the mature Mo-DCs, while SHXB suppress this compared with the control immature Mo-DCs. Moreover, the level of secreting IL-12 in STC3 infected mature Mo-DCs (233.67 pg ml \u00c01 ) was higher than SHXB infected mature Mo-DCs (185.67 pg ml \u00c01 ), thus it was possible that the significant difference between the SHXB and STC3 infected mature cells stimulated the T cells proliferation. From the results, we observed that the more it was in the number of Mo-DCs, the stronger it had the ability to activate the T cells proliferation. Thus there is a minor but significant difference between the SHXB and STC3 infected mature cells only at a DC/T ratio of 1:1 but not at the other ratios.",

            "text": "In order to further verify that SHXB strain severely impaired the functions of DCs in vitro, we carried out in vivo analyses. When encountering a virus, the DCs rapidly uptake the invading virus and migrate to the lymph nodes in order to activate T cells. Because of stronger virulence, SHXB robustly induced the intestinal epithelial cells to secrete the pro-inflammatory chemokines CCL20, CCL25 and CCL27, leading to a rapid recruitment of DCs and T cells to the intestinal villi (the data was not shown). Therefore, after 15 min of injection of SHXB, the number of CD11b + CD16 + DCs, SWC3a + SLA-DR-II + DCs and CD3 + , CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in intestinal villi rapidly increased; such a response did not occur after STC3 injection. Having acquired the antigens, these DCs could migrate from intestinal villi to the lymph node for activating T cells, therefore, after 3 h of SHXB infection, the DCs gradually reduced in number in the intestinal villi, and increased in the lamina propria. After 48 h of virus infection, the number of DCs and CD3 + , CD4 + and CD8 + T cells in the intestinal villi and lamina propria of piglets infected with SHXB was significantly reduced; in contrast, there were significantly more of these cell types in STC3-infected piglets. These results suggest that SHXB significantly impaired the ability of porcine DCs to process and present antigens to activate T cells, and was consistent with that SHXB significantly damaged the ability of porcine Mo-DCs to process and present antigens to activate T cells in vitro. The STC3 strain was similar to the vaccine strain in that it enhanced the porcine DCs' ability to process and present antigens to stimulate CD3 + , CD4 + and CD8 + T-cell proliferation at 48 h postinfection. It is known that the CD3 protein complex is an important T cell marker for the maturation of T cells (Chetty and Gatter, 1994) . CD4 + T cells play a central role in helping B cells make antibodies and inducing macrophages to develop enhanced microbicidal activity (Zhu and Paul, 2008) . CD8 + T-cells can kill virally infected target cells by secreting perforin and granzymes (Mosmann et al., 1997; Stenger et al., 1997) . From our results, CD4 + T cells accounted for 80-90% of the total CD3 + T cells, while CD8 + T cells were only 10-20% of the total CD3 + T cells. Therefore, there was a tendency to develop humoral immunity for the intestinal mucosal immune response, and it also indirectly explained the important antiviral role of SIgA in mucosal immunity. Lastly, the model antigen (the heat-inactivated E. coli) was used to further prove that virulent and attenuated TGEV could influence the functions of intestinal DCs. The CD11b + CD16 + DCs and SWC3a + SLA-II-DR + DCs in the piglets infected with STC3 had a higher ability to take up and migrate and stimulate T-cell proliferation. Nevertheless, these two intestinal DCs had a significantly damaged ability to take up, migrate and stimulate T-cell subset proliferation in the piglets infected with SHXB.",

This might be due to the differences in pathogenesis of virulent and attenuated TGEV in piglets, and could help us to develop a better strategy to prevent TGEV infection by improving the functions of DCs. Furthermore, this study also provides a reference for the mucosally transmitted infectious diseases (pneumonia, tuberculosis, measles, HIV/AIDS, avian flu, SARS, and multidrug-resistant bacteria).",
