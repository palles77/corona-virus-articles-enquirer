On the other hand, CoV-HKU1 infection among adults outside the United States have been reported with rates ranging between 0.04% and 2.1% [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] . Our rate of 1.6% is similar to these findings. We hypothesize that the overall rate might change if surveillance occurred throughout the year.

Although inhaled steroids have been accepted as safe agents with no or minimal systemic absorption, the effects on local cell-mediated immunity is unclear. They have been shown to be a risk factor for bacterial pneumonia in patients with asthma and COPD, as well as influenza in COPD patients [18, 19] . In a recent meta-analysis by Dong et al [20] , there was an increased but nonsignificant trend towards influenza infection among patients taking inhaled fluticasone. Further studies are needed to confirm any relationship between respiratory illness due to CoV-HKU1 and other CoV with inhaled corticosteroids use. All patients we identified with CoV-HKU1 infection had respiratory symptoms with dyspnea, cough, and rhinorrhea being the most common. This is not unexpected due to our study design. Similar studies describing HKU1 in pediatric and adult patients have also found an association with upper and lower respiratory tract illness [7, 9, 12, 15, 21] . However, CoV-HKU1 has also been reported in patients presenting with nonrespiratory symptoms [8] . We identified gastrointestinal symptoms in 38% of CoV-HKU1-positive adults, consisting of diarrhea and nausea and/or vomiting. The mechanism for gastrointestinal symptoms seen in CoV-HKU1 disease remains unclear. Vabret et al [22] and Esper et al [23] have isolated CoV-HKU1 from stool samples in patients with diarrhea and nausea and/or vomiting. Non-CoV, such as influenza [24] , and other CoVs, such as SARS-CoV [25] and MERS-CoV [26] , have also been detected in stool specimens among patients with and without gastrointestinal symptoms. Further studies are needed to determine whether CoV-HKU1 detection in stools is part of gastrointestinal disease versus asymptomatic viral shedding and whether it plays any role in disease transmission.",

            "text": "It is interesting to note that adults identified with Cov-HKU1 had higher than expected severity of disease in our study, with increased occurrence of hospital admissions, oxygen use, and ICU admission. This is in contrast to other studies in which at-risk patient populations had lower morbidity and hospitalization with CoV-HKU1 infections [7, 8, 27] . Looking at other CoVs, the rates of hospitalization and morbidity were relatively similar in combined pediatric and adult studies [12] . Our finding of 54% hospitalization and 15% ICU admission could be accounted for by selection bias of the sample population (screening those presenting to the ED or hospitalized with respiratory tract illness). Studies focusing on outpatient and asymptomatic adults will provide a better understanding of disease severity. However, this study does demonstrate CoV-HKU1's potential for severe illness. A 75-year-old with no history of immunosuppression died due to shock while meeting clinical criteria for sepsis and negative infectious work-up. It remains unclear what, if any, role Cov-HKU1 played in this patient's demise. Most studies of Cov-HKU1 have demonstrated lower mortality [11] . In the 2 deaths reported by Woo et al [11] , both patients were immunocompromised with history of cancer, diabetes mellitus, advanced age, and lymphopenia. Another death linked to CoV-HKU1 was reported in a severely immunocompromised patient lymphodepleted by conditioning for autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [28] . In this case, CoV-HKU1 was isolated from his lung tissue and bronchoalveolar lavage with autopsy revealing bronchopneumonia, organizing pneumonitis, and diffuse alveolar damage.",

This is consistent with other studies suggesting that mere disease diagnosis with respiratory pathogen panel might not alter antibiotic prescribing practices among healthcare providers for viral respiratory illnesses [30] . Such practices are concerning for unnecessary antibiotic exposure and the potential to aid the development of multidrug-resistant organisms [31] .

Among our 2 adults with CoV-HKU1 and influenza A coinfection, it was unclear whether symptoms were due to CoV-HKU1 or influenza or both. The clinical relevance of respiratory viral coinfections is not fully understood. Higher severity of respiratory disease has been reported in certain pathogen coinfection combinations, including influenza A with CoVs [34] . In other studies, there was no increased severity of illness in CoV-associated coinfections [15, 27, 35] . Gaunt et al [27] showed that a quantitative viral load for CoV was unchanged in cases of coinfection with RSV and monoinfection. Further investigation on the role viral coinfections play in alteration of respiratory disease severity should be undertaken.",
