Modern surveillance tends to follow health measures such as the incidence of a disease or syndrome or even the occurrence of health-related behaviors. There are many reasons for conducting surveillance, and the data collected and the approach taken to analyzing those data are both influenced by the overall goal of a surveillance system. In the context of newly emerging viruses, surveillance may be performed to detect disease outbreaks, to monitor the spread or development of ongoing outbreaks, to evaluate the effectiveness of disease control measures, or to identify the determinants of infection and disease.",

            "text": "The term 'newly emerging' virus is different from 'emerging virus' in that a newly emerging virus has not yet been isolated in the laboratory (Barrett et al., 1998) . Whether the virus has been isolated, and more importantly, whether a diagnostic test is available, have implications for surveillance. As a new virus becomes recognized (Fig. 1) , or 'emerges,' it is initially recognized through the clinical presentation of infected individuals. Cases of an apparently novel infectious illness in humans will prompt epidemiological investigations and initiate efforts to isolate the causative agent. Once the agent has been isolated, effort often turns to development of methods for diagnosis. At some point in this progression, the virus is seen as an established cause of endemic or epidemic disease, and is no longer thought of as 'newly emerging. ' The distinction between 'newly emerging' and 'emerging' viruses is therefore important from the perspective of surveillance, because it determines what data a surveillance system can draw upon. For 'newly emerging viruses,' any case definition must rely on clinical and possibly epidemiological data because there are no recognized laboratory tests. Routine surveillance of laboratory test results is likely to be of little use in sounding the initial alarm in an outbreak due to a newly emerging virus. An exception might be if the newly emerging virus is genetically similar to an existing virus, to the extent that it can cross-react in an existing diagnostic test. However, laboratory testing will be useful for ruling out known viruses as the cause of illness, and ultimately to identify the virus. The surveillance system must follow data other than positive laboratory test results, such as reports of abnormal cases, or the incidence of non-specific symptoms, or syndromes that might occur following infection with a newly emerging virus.",

The surveillance approach that is most likely to detect an outbreak due to a newly emerging virus will vary with virus and outbreak characteristics. Depending on the combination of clinical presentation of those infected and the genotype of the virus (Fig. 2) , different methods will be more or less efficient for early outbreak detection. Outbreaks of newly emerging viruses characterized by symptoms common to other infections already under surveillance may be detected by an existing surveillance system if the number infected is sufficiently large. Alternatively, infections with a newly emerging virus causing symptoms similar to another, known pathogen may be incorrectly attributed to the known pathogen, thereby obscuring the emerging epidemic. Genetic similarity to a known virus may hasten the identification of a newly emerging virus and the development of a diagnostic test as well as contribute to our understanding of its host range, natural reservoir, and transmission route.

The large number of cases and the circumstances similar to those of influenza outbreaks ensured that the SARS outbreak was detected, but the similarity of the clinical presentation to other diseases may have initially mislead public health officials about its etiology. Reports of an atypical pneumonia or influenza outbreak in China circulated as early as November 2002, disseminated via ProMED-mail (an Internet and email-based reporting and surveillance system), and picked up by the web-crawling surveillance system GPHIN (Global Public Health Intelligence Network, developed by Health Canada). The course of illness was rapid and its presentation severe; therefore the initial cases were not identified until infected persons sought the attention of health care professionals and a clinical assessment was made. It was only when the outbreak spread beyond mainland China in February 2003 to hospital staff in Hong Kong that reliable information became available concerning the mysterious 'acute respiratory syndrome', allowing a novel etiology Table 1 Timeline of SARS outbreak detection and virus identification (Brookes and Khan, 2005) PCR test to diagnose SARS from nasopharyngeal aspirate becomes available, followed by serological assay to diagnose SARS from blood sample to be hypothesized. It was recognized that the disease was unlike influenza when numerous health care professionals treating SARS patients fell ill themselves. As more became known about the illness, syndromic surveillance (i.e., surveillance of cases identified on the basis of clinical symptoms, in this case fever and respiratory symptoms), contact tracing, and quarantine were implemented. The virus was found to be a new coronavirus. Isolation of the virus did not occur initially, perhaps because the isolation of a coronavirus did not immediately raise suspicion because coronaviruses are commonly associated with milder respiratory illness. Laboratory-based surveillance did not become available until later in the outbreak, when diagnostic PCR and serology tests were developed. Population screening for SARS antibodies was instituted in some countries, with mixed results due to poor specificity of early versions of the tests.",

By definition, laboratory tests are not available for newly emerging viruses, so the case definition must focus on the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of disease. This is problematic, however, because newly emerging viruses may cause a variety of clinical presentations, depending on the characteristics of the virus and the host. In other words, the specific characteristics of a case are not known in advance when developing a surveillance system to detect newly emerging viruses. One approach to this problem is not to define cases in advance, but instead to monitor information sources (e.g., the World Wide Web, posts to electronic discussion boards, etc.) for reports of unusual cases that could be due to a newly emerging virus. However, if used, case definitions must be broad enough to ensure that the surveillance system will be sufficiently sensitive. In this setting, the cost of increased sensitivity is reduced specificity. In other words, to ensure that a case definition will identify cases of infection from a newly emerging virus, we must accept that the definition will also pick up cases of disease due to other causes.",

When a case definition is highly specific, a large proportion of identified cases will be true cases and there will be very little 'noise' in the signal at the population level. When the signal is strong, it is easier to detect unexpected patterns. If the historical variation in the incidence rate of measles, for instance, is low, then an increased incidence of positive test results for measles virus infection should be detected relatively easily. Accordingly, the methods used to search prospectively for outbreaks using communicable disease surveillance data tend to be straightforward: mainly observation and statistical methods (Stroup et al., 1993; Hutwagner et al., 1997) .

For example, many syndromic surveillance systems follow administrative data from emergency room visits.

However, these data contain little specific clinical information, and outbreak signals are likely to be masked by considerable noise. For these reasons, many syndromic surveillance systems now rely on more specific data such as records of visits to emergency departments. Ideally, many available data sources would be used simultaneously, but further research is needed to identify the optimal approach to combining information from multiple types of data within single surveillance systems.",

Because syndromic surveillance systems follow data from events that occur before diagnosis, it is assumed that they will detect outbreaks earlier because the incidence of pre-diagnostic events, such as purchase of over-the-counter medications, will increase before the incidence of diagnoses will increase. In general, these assumptions may hold true under some conditions, but not under other conditions. The limited research on these systems suggests that the results are affected by the clinical course of the disease, the number of individuals exposed, the type of data source monitored, whether an applicable routine test is positive in the disease, and the outbreak detection algorithm used (Buehler et al., 2003; Reis et al., 2003; Stoto et al., 2004; Buckeridge et al., 2005b) . Syndromic surveillance is likely to be more rapid than clinical detection in detecting an outbreak when the clinical symptoms mimic an existing disease with a low incidence, when a clinical data source is being monitored, and when there is no routine diagnostic test for the disease. This is a conceivable scenario for the initial presentation of a newly emerging virus, and so it is reasonable to expect that syndromic surveillance systems may be useful in the initial detection of an outbreak due to a newly emerging virus.",

For example, researchers have found that the spatial and temporal patterns of human dengue virus infections follow known entomological risk factors (Tran et al., 2004) . Other researchers have observed the same phenomenon with West Nile virus (WNV), for which deaths among birds and the distribution of habitats suitable for adult mosquitoes have both been shown to correlate well with virus-positive mosquito samples and the occurrence of human infections (Eidson et al., 2001; Brownstein et al., 2002; Mostashari et al., 2003) .

Careful evaluation of novel surveillance systems should be conducted to determine their accuracy and effectiveness (United States Government Accountability Office, 2004). Because the majority of emerging infectious diseases are zoonoses (Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, 2003), vector-borne and zoonotic disease surveillance and control should be improved (Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, 2003; United States Government Accountability Office, 2004). Significant improvements could be achieved by using robust models for predicting and preventing vector-borne and zoonotic diseases, and by adding veterinary laboratories to laboratory surveillance networks (Institute of Medicine of the National Academies, 2003).",
