In contrast to mortality experienced in East African predators, canine distemper virus (CDV) infection among African wild dogs (Lycaon pictus) in Botswana was not associated with identifiable change in pup survivorship or disease related mortality of adults. A disease outbreak of unknown aetiology occurred in the same population over 4 weeks in 1996. Outbreak boundaries coincided with ecotones, not the spatial distribution of contiguous packs, highlighting the potential importance of landscape heterogeneities in these processes. Direct management of pathogens in domestic animal reservoirs is complicated by the apparent complexity of pathogen maintenance and transmission in these large systems. Conservation effort should be focused at securing large metapopulations able to compensate for expected episodic generalist pathogen invasion and attention directed to addressing underlying causes of population depression such as habitat loss and wildlife conflict. #",

            "text": "Through retrospective sampling, we investigated the extent of exposure of free-ranging predators to multi-host carnivore pathogens across various land uses in southern African. We addressed the following research questions: How common and widespread is exposure to multi-host domestic carnivore pathogens in the study region? Do large protected areas remote from domestic animal reservoirs provide large carnivore species protection from exposure to important pathogens? Is infection always linked to high levels of mortality as has been seen in predators in the Serengeti [19] and Mara ecosystem [3, 20] in East Africa? In light of our exploration of these questions, we then provide recommendations for disease control in free-ranging wildlife with specific attention to their application to predator conservation in southern Africa.",

With wide distribution, high densities, mobility and rapid population turnover (creation of susceptible population), domestic dog populations are identified as a key reservoir for a variety of canine pathogens [39] [40] [41] [42] . However, pathogen exposure may not be a simple function of the presence or absence of a large domestic dog population at some identified interface. CDV and other multi-host canine pathogens can infect a wide variety of wild and domestic carnivore hosts increasing potential for pathogen maintenance in the system through interspecies transmission [43] . In general, individual wild carnivore species are unlikely to occur at sufficient densities to attain critical community size necessary to maintain most pathogens. Domestic dogs, dependent on population number and required critical community size for a pathogen could be considered non-maintenance or maintenance populations for a pathogen [14] . Coupling all susceptible species populations together could constitute a maintenance community irrespective of the size of a particular species component. Therefore even small and low density domestic dog populations could provide the ecosystem with the pathogen flow to allow invasion into a diverse community of susceptible hosts which together reach the critical community size required for pathogen invasion and onward transmission.",

[48] provide theoretical evidence for bistability in the evolution of pathogen virulence with the existence of both avirulent and highly virulent strains developing in association with divergent host population structures. Low density population structures would favour a pathogen with a high level of virulence as killing the host would prevent immune individuals from impeding the spread of the pathogen. In high density populations, evolution would favour avirulence. Further research is needed to better understand the potential role of host population structure on divergent patterns of mortality seen with CDV outbreaks in predator populations in Africa.",

Rabies was evident in the study area at the time, as indicated by the identification of a positive case in a bat-eared fox (Otocyon megalotis) in the area 2 weeks after the outbreak began. The epidemic profile was also consistent with the profile of previous outbreaks of rabies in wild dogs reported elsewhere [3] . However no suitable carcasses could be obtained for a confirmatory diagnosis. Within the following 12 months, the disease-vacated area was re-colonized through dispersal and range expansion of adjacent wild dog packs.",

In these cases, pathogen spread was extensive through the ecosystem resulting in local extinction events [3, 49] , something, that has not been observed in similarly monitored southern African predator populations. This is an intriguing contrast. The explanation may relate in part to varying levels of ecological heterogeneity in these systems and the presence or absence of ecotones which are known to be associated with infectious diseases processes [50] . In contrast to the East African grasslands, the Okavango Delta is characterized by substantial number of ecotones or areas of habitat change. These transition areas may present a barrier or damp to pathogen invasion to contiguous susceptible hosts due to habitat mediated host density changes and reduction in critical community size [14] or extinction of the pathogen related to changes in host spatial structure across patches [51] . Strategic use of ecotones in conservation land use planning might offer a way of establishing ''quasi-metapopulations'' in the same land management area and increasing the potential that some proportion of a contiguous rare and vulnerable population may survive a major disease outbreak.",

With wide spread exposure to canine pathogens over vast areas in southern Africa, mass vaccination of domestic dog reservoirs at the human wildlife interface has no clear application, particularly in light of the apparent complexity of pathogen maintenance in these ecosystems and lack of clarity on where this ''interface'' occurs. Minimizing contact with domestic animal disease reservoirs through the establishment of large protected areas still remains an important conservation strategy, but will not prevent exposure of free-ranging carnivores to important multi-host pathogens. Strategic use of ecotones in conservation land use planning, however, may prevent local extinction events. Further research is required to identify the utility and application of this approach.",
