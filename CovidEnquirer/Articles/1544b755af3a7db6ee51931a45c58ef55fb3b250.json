Field strains of FCoV vary in disease-inducing potential. Some isolates cause FIP (feline infectious peritonitis virus [FIPV] ), and some isolates cause a more localized gastrointestinal disturbance that often results in diarrhea (feline enteric coronavirus [FECV] ). These two strains cannot be distinguished from one another morphologically or antigenically. FECV can mutate spontaneously in the host to become a PIP-inducing stain.",

Because cats shed viral particles in feces, litterbox exposure and mutual grooming are probably the most important sources of infection. Cats living in multiple cat households or having exposure to multiple cats are at a greater risk of contracting FCoV and, as a result, FlP, in part because of higher levels of virus exposure and probably a higher level of stress. 3 .

Historically, the cat is usually young, lives in a multicat household or cattery, and has been recently stressed with a new environment, surgery, or illness. The history may include diarrhea, lethargy, weight loss, or inappetence. Many cats present with a low-grade fever unresponsive to antibiotics. The clinical disease of FIP has two primary clinical forms, the effusive (wet) form and the noneffusive (dry) form. The most common historical and physical examination findings of noneffusive FIP relate to organomegaly and resultant organ failure. Hepatic, ocular, renal, alimenteric, and central nervous system dysfunction are common. Clinical manifestations of the effusive form relate to the development of body cavity effusions. A distended abdomen due to ascites and dyspnea and muffled heart and lung sounds due to pleural effusion are common. Although these distinctions are useful in diagnosing the disease and recognizing signs, they are not mutually exclusive; an individual cat can have manifestions of both forms. Some cats may initially have manifestations most consistent with the noneffusive form and later become effusive or vice versa.",

Vasculitis results in leakage of high protein fluids from affected organs; common sites of leakage are the peritoneum. kidney, and uvea.

Effusion may be less likely because less virus is available for the formation of immune complexes, resulting in less severe vasculitis. When circulating or tissue-associated immune complexes fix complement, neutrophils and macrophages are attracted to the involved organs and pyogranulomatous inflammation develops. Pyogranulomatous inflammation may become severe enough to cause organ dysfunction or failure. 9 . At what age are cats more likely to develop FIP? FIP is said to be a disease of the very young and the very old. Newborn kittens usually are protected by maternal antibodies that last for the first few weeks of life. As maternal antibody protection fades, the kittens are susceptible to infection. The most common age range for cats with FIP is 3 months to 3 years. Another peak in susceptibility occurs in cats older than 10 years. presumably because of an age-related decline in immune responses. 10 . What is the relation between FIP and feline leukemia virus?",

Although negative titers strongly suggest that the cat does not have FIP, some studies have reported negative antibody titers in cats with histologically confirmed FIP. A possible explanation is that, with widespread immune complex formation, the antibody may be bound in the complex and prevented from reacting in the test. Alternatively, the cat may have had fulminant FIP and died before mounting a humoral response. For these reasons, clinicians are urged not to rely on serology as a single diagnostic test.

Cats with effusive FIP are thought to have poor immunity and heavy viral load; glucocorticoid administration may exacerbate disease. In addition, although these drugs are needed to help control the immune response associated with clinical FIP, they also may cause susceptibility to bacterial infections due to myelosuppression and general immunosuppression.
