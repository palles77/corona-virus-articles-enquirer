            "text": "Epidemiological models of the spread of pathogens in livestock populations primarily focus on direct contact between farms based on animal movement data, and in some cases, local spatial spread based on proximity between premises. The roles of other types of indirect contact among farms is rarely accounted for. In addition, data on animal movements is seldom available in the United States. However, the spread of porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDv) in U.S. swine represents one of the best documented emergences of a highly infectious pathogen in the U.S. livestock industry, providing an opportunity to parameterize models of pathogen spread via direct and indirect transmission mechanisms in swine. Using observed data on pig movements during the initial phase of the PEDv epidemic, we developed a network-based and spatially explicit epidemiological model that simulates the spread of PEDv via both indirect and direct movement-related contact in order to answer unresolved questions concerning factors facilitating between-farm transmission. By modifying the likelihood of each transmission mechanism and fitting this model to observed epidemiological dynamics, our results suggest that between-farm transmission was primarily driven by direct mechanisms related to animal movement and indirect mechanisms related to local spatial spread based on geographic proximity. However, other forms of indirect transmission among farms, including contact via contaminated vehicles and feed, were responsible for high consequence transmission events resulting in the introduction of the virus into new geographic areas. This research is among the first reports of farm-level animal movements in the U.S. swine industry and, to our knowledge, represents the first epidemiological model of commercial U.S. swine using actual data on farm-level animal movement.",

In livestock populations, network-based models based on data on animal movements between farms have been a key area of research (Bajardi et al., 2012; Craft, 2015; Green et al., 2006; Kao, 2002; Kao et al., 2007; Rossi et al., 2015) . However, animal movement data is rarely available for livestock industries in the United States due to the lack of a comprehensive national livestock traceability program. This limits capabilities to predict the dynamics of infectious diseases at the landscape, regional, and national levels and hinders development of risk-based surveillance and control measures based on movement data. Animal movement data may be particularly important for the swine industry, where production is highly vertically integrated in that pigs are moved between multiple premises between birth and slaughter, with each premise potentially located in different states (Valdes-Donoso et al., 2017) . Such frequent and long distance movement makes the U.S. swine industry vulnerable to infectious disease epidemics.",

Although the potential importance of such mechanisms in creating transmission opportunities between swine premises has been shown in experimental studies and outbreak investigations (Alonso et al., 2014; Bowman et al., 2015; Lowe et al., 2014; Pasick et al., 2014) , indirect contact is less often accounted for in epidemiological models (Arruda et al., 2016; Martinez-Lopez et al., 2011; Thakur et al., 2015; Yadav et al., 2016) . Models of pathogen spread in livestock populations focus primarily on animal movement and, in some cases, local spatial spread based on proximity between premises (Brooks-Pollock et al., 2015) . Attempts to account for indirect contact are hindered due to lack of data on which farms are connected via indirect contact.

As the name suggests, clinical signs of PEDv include watery diarrhea and vomiting. By the end of June 2014, PEDv had spread to 30 states and impacted approximately 50% of breeding herds (Goede and . PEDv may have resulted in the deaths of at least 7 million piglets, and it may take up to 12 weeks for infected sow farms, where breeding and farrowing occur, to recover their pre-infection piglet production levels .

The objective of this research is to apply epidemiological modeling approaches to simulate the spread of PEDv at the regional scale in order to answer unresolved questions concerning factors facilitating between-farm transmission. Using realworld data on observed pig movements during the initial phase of the PEDv epidemic, we develop a network-based and spatially explicit epidemiological model that simulates the spread of PEDv via both indirect and direct movement-related contact. By fitting this model to the observed epidemiological dynamics in a geographically isolated production company of nearly 400 farms, we (i) evaluate the relative contribution of each of six direct and indirect mechanisms of betweenfarm transmission, and (ii) determine the most likely transmission mechanisms responsible for long-distance jumps, and (iii) discuss how these methods can be used to help producers mitigate future outbreaks. This research is among the first reports of farm-level animal movements in the U.S. swine industry (Lee et al., 2017; Valdes-Donoso et al., 2017) and, to our knowledge, represents the first epidemiological model of commercial U.S. swine using actual data on farm-level animal movement.",

After the infectious period, sow farms are classified as positive-stable. Infection in sow farms was generally managed through intentional exposure of gilts to increase immunity levels, thus although virus was present, large outbreaks with high levels of shedding did not occur and weaned piglets moved from these farms were negative. Positive-stable sow farms thus are no longer infectious to others, and due to ongoing disease management within the farm, they are not considered susceptible for the purposes of the model. Unlike sow farms, nurseries and finishers generally utilized all-in-all-out management, meaning that these farms were completely emptied of live animals before new animals were introduced. Thus, after the infectious period, non-sow farms were moved to the susceptible class.",

It should be noted that Alonso et al. (2014) was conducted in the same company and during the same time period as the modeled study period, making their data highly relevant for inferring airborne dissemination of virus in this system. Although PEDv recovered from air samples collected from the field were not infectious in bioassays (Alonso et al., 2014) , the sample size and sampling duration (30 min) may have been insufficient to capture a low probability event (i.e., recovery of infectious virus in air). Samples were also collected during the day, when UV radiation and temperature would be expected to reduce survival. However, infectiousness of airborne PEDv has been shown experimentally (Alonso et al., 2014) and the possibility of this mechanism has been supported in epidemiological investigations (Alvarez et al., 2016; Beam et al., 2015) .

We then calculated the \"fitness\" of each parameter set as \u03c1 \u2212 Dev t . A higher fitness value indicates that a simulation produced dynamics that were more similar to the observed dynamics, with high correlations in the order in which sow farms were infected and low deviation in the day they became infected. The average fitness was calculated for each parameter set. Two hundred simulations were conducted per parameter set, yielding 200,000 simulations. Two hundred was based on an assessment of the number of simulations required to stabilize the coefficient of variation in fitness values (standard deviation/mean fitness).",

In this analysis, the outcome was the average fitness values from the simulation sets and parameter values were used as explanatory variables (White et al., 2017) . Random forest is an ensemble machine learning method used for classification and regression which is based on the consensus of hundreds of randomized decision trees built using the explanatory variables (Criminisi et al., 2011) . Unlike regression approaches, random forests can handle more complex data with numerous interacting and multicollinear variables with non-linear effects on the outcome (Hultquist et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016) , making them a highly suitable approach for understanding the marginal contribution of variation in each parameter on the overall fitness after controlling for the effects of all other parameters.",

In this analysis, a randomly selected 66% of observations were used to build each tree, and the remaining 33% were considered \"outof-bag\" (OOB) and used to evaluate the importance of each predictor variable in that tree. Variable importance was assessed by calculating the percent increase in mean squared error (MSE) of predictions made for OOB observations relative the MSE of predictions when the variable is permuted. A greater increase would indicate that the variable is important for predicting fitness because randomizing the predictor variable results in greater prediction error (Breiman, 2001; Culter et al., 2007) . To assess the overall performance of the model, the overall percent of variance in fitness explained by the random forest was calculated. The trained random forest was used to predict fitness values for the testing dataset, and the mean squared error was used to evaluate model performance. Partial dependence plots were constructed to assess the marginal effect of model parameters on model outputs after accounting for the effects of all other parameters.",

All parameter values were centered and rescaled for k-means analysis.

Rank correlations in the order in which sow farms became infected in the observed versus simulated data ranged from 0.09 to 0.45, with a median of 0.28. Reported as a proportion, the percent deviation in the day on which sow farms became infected, Dev t , ranged from 0.19 to 0.48, with a median of 0.29. Overall, the random forest explained 91.1% of the variance in fitness in the training data set, and validation with the testing dataset showed strong performance (mean squared error = 0.0013). The parameters that were most important for determining how well the PEDv model matched the observed data (i.e., models with higher fitness) were whether or not a feed contamination event occurred in feed mill B (F B ), values controlling the probability of local spatial spread (\u03d5, \u03d5 7 ), followed by the proportion of farms affected by a feed contamination event (p con.feed Supplementary  Fig. S4 ). Model outputs, as measured by fitness, were less sensitive to the remaining parameters (\u03bc, F A , \u03b2 f , \u03b2 m , \u03b2 c ) After controlling for the effects of other parameters, the fitness of the PEDv model increased at lower values of \u03b2 c and \u03b2 m ( Supplementary  Fig. S5) , indicating that models that simulated the observed epidemic tended to have low rates of within-flow and market truck-related transmission. Fitness also increased with higher values of \u03d5, \u03d5 7 , \u03b2 f , and p con.feed , indicating that more realistic models tended to have high rates of local spatial spread and feed truck-related transmission as well as a high numbers of farms affected by feed contamination events. Fitness was higher when a contamination event occurred in Mill B, but was not affected by Mill A. Similarly, the five best parameter sets that produced PEDv dynamics most resembling observed data all included a feed contamination event for Mill B and not for Mill A ( Table 2 ). The model was not sensitive to the animal-level probability that an individual pig was infected in a batch of shipped (\u03bc), most likely because the large batch sizes (median batch size of 284 head) meant that even a low animal-level infection probability translated into an almost certain probability of moving at least one infected pig.",

In general, our model matched the observed data, showing a slow initial rise in the number of infected farms (mainly non-sow farms), followed by a fairly sudden jump during June, which was related to the occurrence of the feed contamination event in Mill B (Fig. 3 , Supplementary Fig. S6 for non-sow farms). Parameter sets A and D matched the data particularly well, with nearly all observed points falling within the 95% prediction interval of the model. However, it was difficult to match the exact order and time in which sow farms became infected. When comparing the interquartile range of predicted infection dates for every sow farm ( Supplementary Fig. S3 ), the predicted interval encapsulates the observed dates most often for sets A and D. In addition, there is a general correspondence between the observed and predicted infection dates, with farms predicted to be infected in the middle or later in the study period also having observed dates that fell in middle or later for sets A and D. Mismatches occurred in the early study period, which lowered \u03c1. The model struggled to capture which specific farms should be infected early, but performance improved after the early period. For all five scenarios, the model predicted that over 65% of all farms (sow farms and other production types) were infected by October. Across all best-performing models, the majority of between-farm transmission events were due to local spatial spread and the movement of pigs (Fig. 4 , Supplementary Table S4-S6). When considering the mechanism of infection in all types of farms (Fig. 4a) , pig movement was responsible for approximately one quarter to one third of transmission events, whereas this proportion was nearly half when considering only transmission to sow farms (Fig. 4b) . Local spread was responsible for half of transmission events when considering all types of farms, and closer to one third when considering sow farms only (Fig. 4b) .",

However, the model predicted that this introduction would occur after day 34 in 75% of simulations, whereas the observed date of introduction to region I was day 22. Thus, we restricted the summary of transmission mechanisms to only those simulations (n = 827) where introduction occurred prior to day 22 and evaluated the transmission mechanism responsible for the initial introduction. In this case, animal movement and feed trucks were responsible for 72.9% and 20%, respectively, of the initial transmission of PEDv to Region I. Potentially, there could have been multiple introductions into region I beginning, with the earlier introduction prior to day 22 followed by a contaminated feed event. Thus, our results do not rule out a possible role of contaminated feed in long-distance transmission events. Introduction of PEDv to region II was attributable to market trucks and within-flow transmission in 59.2% and 21.8% of simulations where region II was infected, respectively (Table 3) .",

Prior to 2013, PEDv did not occur in the United States. As a result of the rapid spread and production impact of this formerly exotic disease, PEDv is considered an industry gamechanger and highlights the vulnerability of the U.S. swine industry to foreign pathogens. However, mechanisms driving between-farm spread are still poorly understood. By calibrating our PEDv spread model such that simulated data matched observed epidemiological dynamics, we demonstrated that while all hypothesized mechanisms for direct and indirect transmission between-farms likely occurred to some extent, most transmission events were attributable to movement of infected animals (direct transmission) and local spatial spread (indirect transmission). However, other indirect transmission mechanisms, such as fomites related to feed trucks, market trucks, and shared support services within flows, became more important for high consequence, long distance transmission events. Overall, our model provided adequate but not outstanding match to the observed data. The slight under-and over-estimate of the number of sow farms infected during the early and later parts of the epidemic, respectively (Fig. 3) , potentially indicate that our model did not capture some of the underlying changes in how PEDv was managed at the farmlevel. During the early part of the epidemic, there was a delay in identifying the infectious agent, and PEDv was novel to swine veterinarians and producers. However, the industry adapted to PEDv and became better at mitigating between-farm spread through enhanced biosecurity, and this may explain why our model overestimates the number of infected farms in the latter stage of the modeled period.",

This contributed to the moderate rank correlation values (\u03c1 \u223c 0.39-0.49) and model fitness.

Region II contains most of the genetic stock (i.e., high value breeding stock) for this company, and thus these farms are subject to enhanced biosecurity measures. Although Region II eventually became infected in the observed epidemic, Region II did not become infected during the first five months. In contrast, the model predicted that Region II would become infected, and this discrepancy may be due to a failure to account for enhanced biosecurity measures utilized for genetic stock. Despite this discrepancy, it is still useful to track the mechanisms by which Region II became infected as this may highlight potential vulnerabilities in biosecurity measures. Region II usually became infected by either market trucks or within-flow transmission, which emphasizes the importance of decontaminating market trucks and preventing mechanical vectors or fomites associated with shared support services within flows. Also, our model's structure likely overestimated the role market truck transmission to Region II, given that all animals going to slaughter from Region II passed through transfer stations (market trucks did not directly visit Region II farms).",

For example, sow farms typically have higher biosecurity than nurseries and finishers, which may decrease their likelihood of becoming infected via local spatial spread or fomite-related mechanisms. Similarly, biosecurity and mitigation measures employed by infected farms may lead to fluctuating infectiousness over time, which we did not allow for beyond the first week. This could lead to an overestimation of how long farms were able to transmit the virus. Our assumptions about the length of the infectious period of all farms were also based on data from sow farms, as those were the only data that were available.",

In reality, the likelihood of infection by any of these routes would not be shared equally among farms; companies carefully manage the order in which farms are visited in the course of a week such that high-priority farms (i.e., farms where it is more important to prevent infection, such as sow farms) are visited early in the week, thus minimizing the likelihood of fomite contamination of personnel, vehicles, and equipment. In addition, there is often down-time between visits to \"clean\" and \"dirty\" farms (in terms of infection) to decrease the likelihood of transporting fomites between farms. These factors were not accounted for in our model, and may have resulted in sow farms becoming infected too easily. Our model also predicted that few transmission events were due to fomite-related mechanisms. However, it is possible that the roles of fomite-related mechanisms were underestimated given that groups of farms that share the same mill or flow tend to be spatially clustered. This means that it is possible that local spatial spread soaked up at least some of the transmission that could have actually been mediated by fomites, and that our model could not distinguish between fomite transmission and local spatial spread. That being said, many of the flows and mills had farms that were highly dispersed and/or overlapped with other flows/mills, suggesting that indirect transmission via feed trucks or within flows and local spatial spread were not analogous.",

Further, long-distances jumps of PEDv in simulated outbreaks were often attributed to this mechanism (Table 3) . However, our results are specific to transmission within one production system. Contaminated feed may have played a larger role in the initial introduction of the virus to production systems, which is not addressed here, and more generally to the introduction of PEDv to the United States. In addition, our approach for modeling contaminated feed and feed milling were very generalized, and we did not account for the nuances of various feed ingredients that may be more or less likely to harbor live virus (Dee et al., 2015) .",

Lessons learnt from the PEDv epidemic in regards to how best represent the complexity of the U.S. swine industry in epidemiological models are valuable to monitoring other emerging swine pathogens. Our model is a more realistic representation to the realities of the swine industry than other between-farm modeling approaches given its ability to account for management practices and patterns of direct and indirect contact among farms unique to the vertically integrated nature of the swine industry and it could be readily adapted to model the spread of other foreign and endemic pathogens of swine in the US.
