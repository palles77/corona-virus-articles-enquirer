            "text": "Disease outbreaks characterized by reproductive failure and/or neurologic disorders, which are commonly referred as ''Porcine Reproductive and Neurologic Syndrome (PRNS)'', were observed in many swine farms in Iowa and other states. Although an infectious cause was suspected to account for the disease, no conclusive diagnosis had been reached with respect to conventional infectious agents. Extensive laboratory diagnostic investigation on suspect cases repeatedly resulted in the isolation of a cytopathic enveloped virus of 50-60 nm in size from nervous and second lymphoid tissues and sera and, to reflect its unknown identity, named ''Virus X''. The presence of virus particle with morphological characteristics similar to Virus X in tissues from affected animals was also observed on thin-section positive-staining electron microscopy. Isolates of Virus X were not readily recognized by antibodies raised against any known viruses pathogenic to swine but by antisera collected from animals surviving clinical episode, indicating that Virus X is likely a previously unrecognized agent. Pregnant sows experimentally inoculated with Virus X (ISUYP604671) or homogenate (filtrate) of tissues from a clinically affected animal developed clinical signs and pathological changes similar to field observations including the loss of pregnancy. Furthermore, caesarian-derived, colostrum-deprived young pigs developed mild encephalomyelitis lesions in brains after experimental inoculation with the virus or the tissue homogenate although clinical neurologic signs were not observed. More importantly, Virus X was re-isolated from all inoculated animals while control pigs remained negative for the virus during the study. Collectively, Virus X is a novel viral agent responsible for PRNS and remains to be further characterized for taxonomical identity. #",

Typically, producers have observed an acute decline in farrowing rate due to increased early or delayed returns followed by a prolonged period (up to 2 years) of sub-optimal farrowing performance. Loss of pregnancy most commonly occurs in the early stages of gestation (i.e., 30-55 days), although abortion and reproductive failure were reported on sows at later gestations. Affected animals which were confirmed pregnant at 30 days either aborted or demonstrated irregular return to estrus. Besides reproductive disorder, many of the affected animals were presented with neurological signs, such as posterior weakness/paralysis, ataxia, bar chewing, and head pressing/banging (Yoon, 2003) . The neurologic symptoms in affected individuals progressed, with death in 2 or 3 days as the usual outcome. Central nervous signs were also observed in younger pigs such as nursery and fattening pigs. To reflect various clinical manifestations, the newly identified disease has also been commonly referred to as ''Porcine Reproductive and Neurologic Syndrome (PRNS)''. Reproductive and neurologic problems were not, however, always present simultaneously.",

To date, affected herds have been observed in both PRRSV-infected and PRRSV-free swine herds in many states including Iowa (Yoon, 2003) . Although many cases with similar clinical presentations have been presented to the Iowa State University Veterinary Diagnostic Laboratory (ISU-VDL), a conclusive diagnosis could not be reached to date (Yoon and Zimmerman, 1998) . Laboratory testing including serology, has not yet demonstrated the role of any recognized reproductive or neurologic pathogens of swine associated with the symptoms described above, including foreign or exotic viral agents. No bacterial or viral pathogens were consistently identified in index cases. Furthermore, there is no evidence that the condition is toxin-related, or associated with any particular management practice or pig genotype. Therefore, the disease was thought to be due to a previously unrecognized agent. With that hypothesis, the following extensive laboratory diagnostic investigations were conducted to identify the causative agent.",

Besides reproductive failure, some of the affected pregnant sows and weaned pigs also showed neurological signs such as posterior weakness, paresis, ataxia, lameness, head pressing or banging and aggressive behavior often leading to abrasions on the forehead, nose and front legs as well as abortion. Neonates showed ''shaking'' and many times appeared to be blind as those animals could not walk in one direction. Central nervous signs were also observed in grower-finishers.

At between 48 and 120 h PI, the cells were harvested using a cell scraper and pelleted by lowspeed centrifugation. Each cell pellet was fixed in 2% (w/v) glutaraldehyde and 2% (w/v) paraformaldehyde in 0.05M phosphate-buffered saline (PBS, pH 7.2) for 48 h at 4 8C. Samples were rinsed once in PBS followed by 2 washes in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer (pH 7.2) and then fixed in 1% osmium tetroxidate in 0.1 M cacodylate buffer for 1 h at ambient temperature. The samples then were dehydrated in a graded ethanol series, cleared with ultra pure acetone, infiltrated and embedded using a modified EPON epoxy resin (Embed 812, Electron Microscopy Science, Fort Washington, PA, USA). Resin blocks were polymerized for 48 h at 70 8C. Thick and ultra-thin sections were made using a Reichert Ultracut S ultra microtome (Leeds Precision Instruments, Minneapolis, MN, USA).

Inoculation of pregnant sows at 30 days of gestation Seven sows at 4th or 5th parity were purchased from a high-health-status commercial vendor and transferred to an animal holding facility with farrowing crates and bred through artificial insemination. The facility was operated and managed at BSL2 compliance. Once pregnancy was confirmed by an ultrasound technique, 5 sows were selected and used for the study. Four of the 5 sows at 30 days of gestation were inoculated intranasally, subcutaneously and intramuscularly with one of the following biological materials: (a) cell culture fluid containing virus isolate designated ISUYP604671; (b) homogenate of tissues collected from a clinically affected sow; (c) serum collected from the clinically affected sow. All inoculated animals were kept in the same room but individually in farrowing crates for 30 days. The one remaining sows served as sham-inoculated control and was kept in a separate room. After inoculation, all animals were monitored for changes in behavior and any reproductive problems. In addition, the sows were bled every seven days. At the termination of the study, all sows were euthanized, and various tissues (brain, tonsil, lung, spleen, lymph nodes, kidney, liver, placenta, spinal cord, uterus, uterine fluid) and, if present, fetuses were collected from each sow for histopathology, virus isolation and/or serology.",

Although death loss and reproductive failure in breeding females is not an unusual event in many farms for various reasons, clinical presentations of reproductive problems along with neurologic disorders were a unique feature of PRNS. Unfortunately, diagnostic investigations focusing on all conventional infectious agents that had been implicated in reproductive and/or neurologic problems of pigs at various ages has been unfruitful or yielded inconsistent results. With the hypothesis that a previously unknown infectious agent could be responsible for the disease, extensive laboratory testing resulted in frequent isolation of a relatively small enveloped cytopathic virus ('Virus X') from clinically affected animals. Although one might say that Virus X is not necessarily a causative pathogen, isolation of the virus from nervous tissues collected from clinically ill animals with CNS signs is a convincing evidence The virus inocula were prepared at various cell passages (P). a Significant gross lesions were hemorrhages in inguinal lymph node, decolorization of uterus (green and brown) and possible embryonic death of fetuses. Microscopically, necrotic edema in the lymph node, mineralization plaques in uterus and necrotic debris in the lumen were observed. b NA: not applicable. suggesting that Virus X was likely responsible for the disease. Observations from the animal inoculation study with pregnant sows clearly indicate that Virus X is capable of crossing the placental barrier and causing the loss of pregnancy most likely due to embryonic or fetal death as evident by recovery of the virus from fetal tissues. Furthermore, development of meningitis or encephalitis lesions in the brains of young CDCD pigs after inoculation with Virus X also indicate that the virus may be able to cause neurologic disorder in infected animals, although the inoculated CDCD pigs did not show clinical central nervous signs under experimental conditions. Those lesions were due to the attack by Virus X since the virus was recovered from brain tissues. Since all these experimental findings match well with field observations of PRNS, Virus X is postulated to be the causative agent for PRNS as Koch's postulates were partially fulfilled. It is proposed then that Virus X shall be named ''PRNS virus (PRNSV)''.",

The positive cross-reactivity of PRNSV with anti-BVDV antibody is of particular interest with respect to taxonomical identification of the virus. The possibility that PRNSV could be CSFV was ruled out at the beginning of the investigation since US swine populations are known to be free of CSFV. Furthermore, diagnostic testing on some early PRNS suspect cases at the Foreign Animal Disease Diagnostic Laboratory of the National Veterinary Laboratory Service ruled out the presence of CSFVor its infection in those animals as well as the involvement of other foreign animal disease agents (Data not shown). Pigs are known to be susceptible to ruminant pestiviruses such as BVDV and BDV besides porcine pestivirus (i.e., CSFV). Although BVDV infection of pigs has been demonstrated both in the field and under experimental conditions, BVDV has not been considered to be a significant pathogen for pigs. Considering that PRNSV is readily spread among pigs and there is very minimum contact between pigs and ruminants in the US, it would be hard to believe that PRNSV is BVDV or BDV. This argument is supported by negative PCR results (5 0 UTR) on isolates of PRNSV for BVDV and CSFV. However, based on its morphological similarity with pestiviruses and cross-reactivity with anti-BVDV antibody, the possibility that PRNSV is a pestivirus cannot be completely ruled out until proven otherwise. At the time of writing this manuscript, PRNSV is proposed to be a novel swine pestivirus which remains to be further characterized for its conclusive taxonomical identification. As a pestivirus is suspected to be responsible for PRNS, development of a specific diagnostic reagent for PRNSV is prudent.",
