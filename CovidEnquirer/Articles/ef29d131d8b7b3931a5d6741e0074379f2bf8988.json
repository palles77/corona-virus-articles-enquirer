            "text": "Tropical Asia is the homeland for slightly more than 169.4 million of the total world population of 178.2 million domestic buffaloes (Bubalus bubalis) estimated in 2006. Domestic buffaloes in Asia are of two types: the swamp type for draught in the eastern half of Asia and the river type for milk in the western half of Asia. The river-type buffaloes, the once-neglected farm species, currently produce about 73.2 million tonnes of milk annually from some of the world's best buffalo breeds in India and Pakistan. They breed throughout the year, conceive at 250-275 kg body weight, calve for the first time at 3-5 years of age following a gestation period of 305-320 days, and produce two calves every 3 years. Lactating animals are fed mainly on straw, crop residues, and mineral supplements such as urea-molasses-mineral block (UMMB). In most rural areas, animals are hand-milked twice daily and the calf is used to stimulate milk letdown. The lactation period is 200-300 days with first lactation milk yields of 1500-1800 kg. Breeding females are retained in the herd until about the ninth lactation (16 years of age) with reasonable economic returns. River buffaloes are vulnerable to most infectious and metabolic diseases affecting cattle. In India and Pakistan, milk is marketed through a network of milk cooperatives, which guarantee a stable price throughout the year for the farmer. Buffalo milk contains twice as much butterfat as cow milk. Besides ghee, several other products are manufactured from buffalo milk, such as butter, cheese, full cream milk powder, skim milk powder, and infant milk powder. Thus, the domestic buffalo is emerging as an alternative source for the manufacture of dairy products worldwide.",

The individual 3000-l-per-lactation female, considered a record 30 years ago, is now common. There are many that yield 4000 l in a lactation period of 300 days -some have even attained 5000 l. Most Asians consume buffalo milk in liquid form. Surplus milk is processed into butter, ghee, condensed milk, curd, and cheese. Dairy products, made from cow's milk, are also produced from buffalo milk in modern dairy plants.",

In addition, these cooperatives provide loans to farmers to purchase superior animals, sell animal feed, and provide a routine veterinary and AI service.

The lower water and higher fat contents make buffalo milk better suited for the manufacture of fat-based and solid non-fat (SNF)-based milk products, such as cheese, butterfat, many kinds of traditional pastries, candies as well as ice cream, ghee, and milk powder ( Table 6 ). In fact, swamp buffalo milk has higher fat (9-15%), protein (7.1%), lactose (4.9%), and ash (0.89%) contents. In general, calcium, iron, and phosphorus contents are higher in buffalo milk than in cow milk. The lower cholesterol content in buffalo milk should make it more popular than cow milk in the health-conscious public. Unlike the cow, the buffalo converts the yellow pigment beta-carotene into vitamin A, which is colorless, and is passed on to milk. Therefore, buffalo milk is distinctively whiter than cow milk; not only cow milk is pale creamish-yellow but also the milk fat is golden yellow.",
