The frequency and relevance of viral coinfections is still debatable. Objective: Compare clinical presentation and severity between single virus infection and viral coinfection in children admitted for LRTI. Methods: A 3-year period observational study (2012---2015) included children younger than two years admitted for LRTI. Viral identification was performed using PCR technique for 16 viruses. Clinical data and use of health resources was gathered during hospital stay using a standard collection form and we compared single virus infection and viral coinfections. Results: The study included 524 samples (451 patients); 448 (85.5%) had at least one virus identified. Viral coinfections were found in 159 (35.5%). RSV and HRV were the most commonly identified virus; bronchiolitis and pneumonia the most frequent diagnosis. Patients with viral coinfections were older, attended day-care centers, had previous recurrent wheezing more frequently and were more symptomatic at admission. These patients did not have more duraci\u00f3n de la estancia hospitalaria, de la necesidad de ox\u00edgeno, de UCI o soporte ventilatorio. Discusi\u00f3n: Nuestro estudio mostr\u00f3 una proporci\u00f3n significativa de coinfecciones virales en los ni\u00f1os peque\u00f1os ingresados con IVRI y confirma dados previos que muestran que la prescripci\u00f3n es m\u00e1s frecuente en las coinfecciones virales, sin asociaci\u00f3n con peor resultado cl\u00ednico.",

Continuous variables were compared using a two-sided, nonparametric Wilcoxon rank sum test or, when the data were normally distributed (on the basis of the Shapiro---Wilk test), a two-sided Student's t-test. For discrete variables, comparison between groups was performed using contingency table analysis and the Chi-square test or Fischer's exact test as appropriate. All p values were 2-tailed, p < 0.05 was considered statistically significant. A multiple regression model was done to identify clinical and virologic variables associated with hospital LOS. Univariate and multivariate logistic regression models were used to identify variables associated with ICU admission. Factors were selected for inclusion in the model if they were found to be associated with the outcome in unadjusted analyses (p < 0.05) or were potentially clinically significant. Results from logistic models were described by odds ratios (OR) and 95% confidence intervals (CI).",

Its frequency was higher than that referred in other studies. 28, 29 Viruses such as ADV, HBOV, HEV, COV OC43, COV NL63, PIV1, 2 and 3 and FLUA were more frequently seen as an agent of viral coinfection than as a single agent. 5,28 Nascimento et al. found similar results in 2010. 23 Nevertheless, a great variability exists regarding viral coinfection rates, with results as low as 11---17.5% 6, 30, 31 and as high as 50---60%. 29, 32, 33 A multicenter national study 7 that used immunofluorescence and PCR techniques for viral detection described a much lower coinfection rate (13.3%) in children with acute bronchiolitis. Differences in viral coinfection rates may result from the population studied (infants versus older children and different proportions and types of underlying comorbidities) or from viral diagnostic techniques used. In our study, viral coinfection was more frequent in older children, in those exposed to nursery or with individual susceptibility factors such as recurrent wheezing and also in patients with pneumoniae as the discharge diagnose. Others have reported similar results. 5, 6 Although there are some discrepancies between reports, we found no association between viral coinfection and clinical disease severity. 5, 6 In our study clinical severity was not evaluated based on a severity score, however others who have used it also found no differences. 6 Asner et al., 25 in a recent meta-analysis, did not find convincing evidence that patients admitted with viral coinfection had higher risk of developing more severe disease comparing with single virus infection. However, it should be highlighted that the overall quality of evidence of the studies included applying the GRADE framework ranged from low to moderate quality of evidence. The studies of Suryadevara et al., 1 Marguet et al., Nascimento et al., 23 and De Paulis et al. 11 corroborated that viral coinfection does not seem to have an impact on the severity of disease. On the other hand, Mart\u00ednez-Roig et al. 32 reported an inverse relationship between the number of detected viruses in the NPA, the need for oxygen supply and the hospital LOS. In the aforementioned study of Calvo et al., 6 viral coinfection appeared to be associated with a greater hospital LOS, unlike what was observed in our study.",

            "text": "The prescription of short-acting bronchodilators, antibiotics and systemic corticosteroids was more frequent in the viral coinfection group. We must be cautious in interpreting these data as this was probably due to children's older age and more symptomatic presentation on admission rather than the presence of viral coinfection. Some of these clinical characteristics, such as fever, were also more frequent in patients with multiple viral infections in other studies. 6 Virus---bacteria coinfection, although not systematically performed, was found in 27.9% of cases, and, as previously reported, was associated with more frequent collection of blood samples, CXR and antibiotics' prescription. 5, 27, 34, 35 There are some strengths of our study, explicitly the prospective nature of the data collection, the considerable number of respiratory samples assessed, the use of a broad molecular assay for the detection of 16 different viral respiratory pathogens and the high positivity rate. Moreover, our sample proved to be homogeneous in terms of patient's age (81.7% with less than 12 months and a median age of 4 months). Additionally, the impact of underlying comorbidities/risk factors was also addressed. Finally, an additional strength was the time span of the study including cases from all year round. Some previous studies performed seasonality-based analysis losing the characterization of some LTRI associated viruses that occur in the rest of the year. 7, 36 This study also has some limitations that should be acknowledged. Firstly, the fact that it was designed to describe the epidemiology of viral LRTI in hospitalized pediatric patients. As such, it included only hospitalized children in an academic medical center, so these results may not be generalizable to community attendance and cannot be extrapolated to children with less severe disease. Secondly, the viral identification through real-time PCR in respiratory secretions does not necessarily mean acute infection. It is well known that this technique is able to detect virus in up to 5% of asymptomatic patients 36, 37 and we should also remember that the detection of more than one virus may be due to the presence of viral fragments persisting for up to 5---6 weeks after onset of symptoms. 38 Therefore, the term ''co-detection'' is, in fact, more precise than coinfection, especially when molecular diagnostic techniques are used. However, this limitation is difficult to overcome, since most of these viruses are difficult to grow in cell culture and, consequently, clinical interpretation of virus detection in respiratory secretions in a child with LRTI is quite challenging. 21,36---38 This may be another possible reason for the absence of differences between the single infections and coinfections with regard to the clinical outcomes. Quantitative PCR and its correlation with clinical symptoms might become a useful tool to clarify the actual role of multiple infections. Finally, another important limitation is the absence of a systematic search for bacteria in the respiratory specimens. The potential influence of a concomitant bacterial infection can be a relevant issue contributing to contradictory data in studies examining the role of the viral coinfection in determining the severity of the disease. Prospective longitudinal studies including serial respiratory sampling for viruses and bacteria may lead to a better understanding of the clinical significance of polymicrobial acute LRTI.",

Our results suggest that there was an association of viral coinfection with demographical, environmental and clinical characteristics on admission. Most importantly, our data challenge current thinking as we found that this does not change the short-term outcomes nor the relevance for co-hosting patients on the basis of single identification virus by other less sensitive methods. 39, 40 Due to the burden of LRTI in children, we highlight the need for further prospective longitudinal studies, with well-defined short-term outcomes and systematic search for viruses and bacteria in respiratory samples, in order to better understand the clinical importance of polymicrobial respiratory infections in children and adjust severity risk factors and hospital resources.",
