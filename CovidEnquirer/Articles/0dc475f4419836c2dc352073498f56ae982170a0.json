There was a statistically significant difference between all age groups, for HRV (P < .001), Adv (P < .001), influenza (ALL) (P = .02), RSV (P = .002), PIV-3 (P = .04), and coronavirus (ALL) (P = .02).

In regard with samples positive for influenza (A or B), the predominance of influenza in the age group (\u226510, <18) was due to influenza B cases, while the majority of cases with influenza A H1-2009 were noticed in the ages under 10 years old (16/27, 59.3%). The latter was also true for Hmpv (27/39, 69.2%), while PIV-3, the main PIV type detected (Table 1 ) had a peak incidence in ages under 5 years old (15/19, 78.9%).

In this study, the routine clinical application of the FA-RP was indirectly used as a molecular point-of-care testing for the age-stratification of the respiratory viruses detected, in a tertiary hospital of Greece. HRV was the most commonly identified virus in almost all age groups, but especially in the groups (<2) and (\u22655, <10). The increasing availability of multiplex PCR panels allows rapid detection of HRV and provides the opportunity for timely treatment and early recognition of outbreaks. [8] The predominance of HRV in our patient series is in accordance with previously published data. [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] including data with patients under the age of 2. [14] HRV has been previously identified as the most common pathogen detected among symptomatic young children in a pediatric emergency department, with the majority of them requiring hospitalization. [15] The same was true in our series, where all cases were symptomatic and most cases had been hospitalized. Based on our results, HRV should certainly be included in the differential diagnosis of URIs in older patients, too.",

In our study, Adv is referred for the first time as the most frequent responsible pathogen in the age group (\u22652, <5) and second in priority among all the identified pathogens. These results may reflect a trend of increasing total incidence and higher-age peak incidence for Adv positive cases. RSV is a regular winter visitor that is highly contagious among persons of all ages. [19] Although long recognized as the major viral pathogen of the lower respiratory tract of infants, it has also been implicated in severe lung disease in adults, especially the elderly. [20, 21] This was not confirmed in our study, where most RSV positive samples were noticed in ages under 5 years old. However, it should be noticed that 4 out of the 5 positive cases which occurred in the ages \u226518 (data not shown), belonged to the age group (\u226565), highlighting the relevance of this virus in all ages. [22] As for samples positive for Influenza (A or B), we should underline the total prevalence of influenza A H1-2009, the high incidence of influenza A H1-2009 in ages under 10 years old and the preference of influenza B incidence in the middle ages. Influenza A and B are important causes of respiratory illness in all age groups. [23] Influenza has been referred as the most common etiologic agent (55.7%), especially among adults. [24] This was not true in our case, except for the age group (\u226510, <18). However, influenza A has been previously considered as 1 of the 3 most frequent pathogens in the community setting.

In a study of 315 respiratory samples from children under 6 years of age, the FA-RP identified multiple coinfections (39%) with 2, 3, 4, and up to 5 different viruses. [29] Coinfection has also been found in 31%, [13] 36%, [9] 37%, [10] 42%, [30] and 51.8% [31] of positive respiratory samples. In our study, 9% of all our respiratory patients had multiple pathogens and 16% of all positive respiratory patients (almost 1 of 6 positive samples appeared with co-detections). There is no obvious explanation about the significance of lower frequency of co-detection in our series of patients. However, the predominance of HRV in our single and multiple detections is in accordance with previously published data. [32] Moreover, HRV/Adv and HRV/RSV combinations have been previously mentioned as the most frequent co-infection patterns. [30, 33] Interestingly, it has been suggested that the presence of RSV reduces the probability of rhinovirus infection, but that, if a co-infection occurs, both viruses cause clinical symptoms. [34] Regarding the age-related distribution of multiple pathogens, our observation that patients under 5 years of age were more likely to have multiple detections, is almost in accordance with the eliminated previously published data. [33, [35] [36] [37] Nevertheless, Tramuto et al have also noticed that most of their patients with multiple etiology were adults and elderly. [24] In conclusion, understanding the viral etiology and age-specific incidence of URIs can help identify risk groups and probably inform vaccine delivery. In this study, HRV predominated in almost all ages, Adv in the age group (\u22652, <5) and Influenza was second in the ages (\u226518). Finally, it was remarkable that the negative samples were mostly attributed to older ages, with a peak incidence in the age group (\u226545, <65), confirming that, as the age of the patient increases, the positivity rate for the PCR decreases proportionately, [32] a finding that needs further explanation.",
