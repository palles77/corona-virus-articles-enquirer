            "text": "With the advent of deep sequencing, genomic surveillance has become a popular method for detection of infectious disease, supplementing information gathered by classic clinical or serological techniques to identify host-determinant markers and trace the origin of transmission. However, two main factors complicate genomic surveillance. First, pathogens exhibiting high genetic diversity demand higher levels of scrutiny to obtain an accurate representation of the entire population. Second, current systems of detection are nonuniform, with significant gaps in certain geographic locations and animal reservoirs. Despite past unforeseen pandemics like the 2009 swine-origin H1N1 influenza virus, there is no standardized way of evaluating surveillance. A more complete surveillance system should capture a greater proportion of pathogen diversity. Here we present a novel quantitative method of assessing the completeness of genomic surveillance that incorporates the time of sequence collection, as well as the pathogen's evolutionary rate. We propose the q2 coefficient, which measures the proportion of sequenced isolates whose closest neighbor in the past is within a genetic distance equivalent to 2 years of evolution, roughly the median time of changing strain selection for influenza A vaccines. Easily interpretable and significantly faster than other methods, the q2 coefficient requires no full phylogenetic characterization or use of arbitrary clade definitions. Application of the q2 coefficient to influenza A virus confirmed poor sampling of swine and avian populations and identified regions with deficient surveillance. We demonstrate that the q2 coefficient can not only be applied to other pathogens, including dengue and West Nile viruses, but also used to describe surveillance dynamics, particularly the effects of different public health policies. IMPORTANCE Surveillance programs have become key assets in determining the emergence or prevalence of pathogens circulating in human and animal populations. Genomic surveillance, in particular, provides comprehensive information on the history of isolates and potential molecular markers for infectivity and pathogenicity. Current techniques for evaluating genomic surveillance are inaccurate, ignoring the pathogen's evolutionary rate and biodiversity, as well as the timing of sequence collection. Using sequence data, we propose the q2 coefficient as a quantitative measure of surveillance completeness that combines elements of time and evolution without defining arbitrary criteria for clades or species. Through several case studies of influenza A, dengue, and West Nile viruses, we employed the q2 coefficient to identify sampling deficiencies in different host species and locations, as well as examine the effects of different public health policies through historical records of the q2 coefficient. These results can guide public health agencies to focus resource allocation and virus collection to bolster specific problems in surveillance.",

First reported in Hong Kong in 1997 and 2003, this virus has spread quickly from waterfowl to chickens, crows, pigeons, and other birds in Europe, Africa, and particularly Asia, leading to the deaths by infection and forced culling of millions of birds and resulting in appreciable economic losses (8) .

This feature confers tropism in pigs on both avian and human influenza viruses (15) , allowing swine to serve as mixing vessels for antigenic shift, in which different strains infecting the same host can reassort RNA segments to create a novel viral strain (16) . Such reassortments have engendered at least two major human pandemics in the 20th century, in 1957 and 1968 (17) . The most recent pandemic of swine origin influenza virus (SOIV) in 2009, in particular, was a reassortant between Eurasian and North American swine lineages, and although the virus most likely came from a pig, a definitive geographic origin has yet to be determined (13, 18) . Interestingly, the closest ancestors of the 2009 pandemic virus were related to viruses isolated from swine more than a decade prior (13, 19) , suggesting that relevant strains circulating in swine herds have escaped detection because of inadequate sampling (18) .",

After representing sequences as points in a mutational landscape, a highly clustered structure could potentially reflect highly biased sampling. Once again, this method ignores time and can be confounded by evolutionary processes like bottlenecks. A final tactic might be to mea-sure the genetic diversity within a sample of the pathogen. Phylogenetic reconstruction and tallying of species richness is one method that characterized the subclades of avian H5N1 (8) , but such analyses are cumbersome, with arbitrary boundaries for classifying clades.

This measure ranks a surveillance system as more complete if it is able to capture a greater proportion of the pathogen's diversity. We apply this measure to influenza virus and compare the surveillance of different influenza virus strains in different hosts and geographic regions. We find that, compared to human seasonal strains, sampling is indeed substantially lower for swine H1N1 and avian non-H5N1 influenza virus, historically overlooked strains despite their pandemic potential. We also find that avian H5N1 influenza virus surveillance in the WHO transmission zones of northern and western Africa; eastern, southern, and southeastern Asia; and eastern, southwestern, and northern Europe is high and may potentially serve as an effective early warning system given a list of genetic determinants of mammalian adaptation. Avian H5N1 influenza virus surveillance in North America, however, is much less comprehensive. We similarly apply our methodology to other RNA viruses and show inadequate surveillance of both dengue and West Nile viruses.

However, we calculate the q2 coefficient by using a number of distance methods, including Hamming distance, Jukes-Cantor, Kimura, Tamura, Tajima-Nei, Hasegawa, and Nei-Tamura, and find little significant change (see Results). If the surveillance of a pathogen in a given time and place is sufficient, we would therefore expect a maximal number of viral isolates to have a closest ancestor in the sequence database with a sequence identity of greater than 1 \u03ea R. For the q coefficient, we chose to use t \u03ed 2 years since antigenic variant strains of influenza virus emerge and become predominant over a period of roughly 2 to 5 years (23); however, any value of t can be used. One consideration is that substitution rates can vary over time and across different lineages. To incorporate such variability into our calculation of the q2 coefficient, we used the 95% highest posterior density (HPD) interval of the evolutionary rate collected from the literature (see Table S1 in the supplemental material) (24) (25) (26) .",

We showed that our q2 coefficient calculations did not drastically change for different genetic distances (\u03fd0.035 difference in the q2 coefficient). Analysis of each strain reflects a different state of geographic and host surveillance. Overall, surveillance of human seasonal strains was high; the q2 coefficient values of both human seasonal H3N2 and seasonal H1N1 viruses, which had been sampled and sequenced long before 2003, approached 1 from 2003 to the present (Fig. 1D ). Clustering of sequences by transmission zone began to uncover weakness in the surveillance of seasonal H3N2, particularly in central Asia (see Fig. S1A and S2A in the supplemental material). In addition to central Asia, several parts of Europe, western Asia, and especially central Africa, yielded lower q2 coefficients of seasonal H1N1 (see Fig. S1B and S2B in the supplemental material). As a testament to the global response to the pandemic, human SOIV H1N1 shot up to a q2 coefficient of 1 shortly after its arrival in March 2009 in all transmission zones except central and southern Africa and central Asia ( Fig. 1D ; see Fig. S1C and S2C in the supplemental material).",

With the establishment of GISAID in 2006, both human and avian H5N1 influenza virus q2 coefficients increased further to high levels of around 0.9, affirming the effectiveness of the global consortium. Beyond 2007, however, the surveillance of human H5N1 influenza virus has waned compared to that of avian H5N1 influenza virus (Fig. 1D ).

H5N1 avian influenza virus surveillance is high in northern and western Africa; eastern, southeastern, and southern Asia; and eastern, southwestern, and northern Europe.

In the United States, for example, only until 2006 were the reporting and tracking of H5 in birds mandated by the USDA (28) .

However, potential zoonotic transmission from other avian strains is possible, as well. Performance of the same analysis of non-H5N1 avian influenza virus strains yielded a low q2 coefficient beginning at 0.5 in 2003 and plateauing at a level just below 0.7 in spite of GISAID (Fig. 1D ) and the resulting increase in sequenced isolates (Fig. 1B) . This finding potentially reflects the extremely high genetic diversity of influenza A virus in its natural reservoir (Fig. 1C ) that is not fully captured by current surveillance systems. Transmission zone analysis of non-H5N1 avian influenza virus strains indicates that non-H5N1 surveillance is concentrated in southwestern Europe, the Central American-Caribbean region, North America, northern Africa, and eastern and southeastern Asia ( Fig. 2B ; see Fig. S1G in the supplemental material). Calculation of the q2 coefficient for other complete coding segments of influenza virus was also performed. Since observed differences in sequences should reflect the evolutionary rates of each segment, any differences in the q2 coefficient should reflect differences in sampling alone. For H3N2, H1N1pdm, and seasonal H1N1, the q2 coefficient exhibited little change among different segments (differences of \u03fd0.02) and moderate change for other strains. The largest change in the q2 coefficient was 0.186 between swine H1N1 HA and PB2. Despite such differences between segments, results showed that generally surveillance of human H3N2, H1N1pdm, and seasonal H1N1 across all segments surpassed that of human H5N1, avian H5N1, swine H1N1, and non-H5N1 avian influenza viruses (see Tables S2 and S3 in the  supplemental material) .",

One may wonder if other alternative methods that account for pathogen evolution may suffice to characterize the genetic surveillance of a pathogen. Phylogenetics has been used in many studies to characterize pathogen surveillance qualitatively without producing a quantitative measure of sampling completeness (36) . A possible phylogenetic analogue to the q2 coefficient might entail the reconstruction of a tree based on available sequences and measurement of the distribution of branch lengths. The true distance between two isolates, A and B, is represented by the sum of their patristic distances, d A and d B , which are the branch lengths from each respective sequence to their common ancestral node. Sequences are time ordered, however, and if we assume an approximate molecular clock, then d A \u03fd d B given that sequence A occurs before sequence B. An estimate of distance is then the larger patristic distance. A parallel to our q2 coefficient would predict high surveillance to correspond to a maximal number (#) of patristic distances d to their closest ancestor in the past less than 2 years as follows: Phylogenies can be divided into those that are distance based and those that are character based. Since the q2 coefficient readily incorporates different genetic distance methods, it is equivalent to any p2 coefficient calculated from distance-based trees. On the other hand, character-based trees, including maximumlikelihood and Bayesian inference methods, incorporate site heterogeneity by considering one character (a site in the alignment) at a time to reconstruct a tree (37); moreover, Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods like BEAST (38) can incorporate relaxed clock rates.

Non-H5N1 avian influenza virus has an extremely high b 0 and a low q2 coefficient. It should be noted that the non-H5N1 avian influenza virus data set contains 15 different HA subtypes, as opposed to all of the other single-subtype HA data sets considered. Thus, b 0 may need to be normalized by the expected number of HA subtypes. Nevertheless, b 0 for non-H5N1 avian influenza virus remains high even with normalization.

To measure genetic diversity directly, we chose to employ Shannon's entropy, a popular and intuitive measure that avoids cumbersome phylogenetic reconstruction, and applied it to the distribution of alleles at each nucleotide position within an alignment. This calculation recovers the number of bits of information per base. Assuming the independence of each position, the total entropy of a population is the sum of the entropies of each base position of the alignment. To correct for bias stemming from a variable number of isolates (n), we estimate Shannon's entropy (H) for a given base position on the basis of the following algorithm of Miller et al., where m is the number of alleles (44):",

Sequences were analyzed by using BEAST v1.7.4, a Bayesian MCMC approach, to sample time-structured evolutionary trees from their joint posterior probability distribution. Because of computational and time limits, we restricted our phylogenetic analysis to human H5N1, as BEAST analysis of data sets of over a thousand sequences can take weeks to converge to a stationary condition. This data set was analyzed by using an exponential-growth coalescent as a tree prior with an HKY \u03e9 \u232b model of nucleotide substitution. Relaxed and strict molecular clocks were employed. For the strict (relaxed) clock, 20 independent runs of 750,000 (1,500,000) steps each were performed, compared for convergence, and combined, with a burn-in of 150,000 (500,000) steps from each. Each run finished after an average of 32.47 (19.14) h using one 3.00-GHz Intel Xeon CPU with 12 GB of random-access memory. A single maximum clade credibility (MCC) tree was created from each set of simulations with the average length determined for each branch. We found the corresponding evolutionary rates to be 5.11 \u03eb 10 \u03ea3 (range, 4.58 \u03eb 10 \u03ea3 to 5.62 \u03eb 10 \u03ea3 ) and 5.39 \u03eb 10 \u03ea3 (range 4.39 \u03eb 10 \u03ea3 to 5.80 \u03eb 10 \u03ea3 ), similar to the evolutionary rate we used for influenza virus HA analysis. The 95% HPD of each branch length of the MCC tree was used to set a confidence interval for each p2 coefficient.",

Another possible surveillance measure can be derived by using persistence homology techniques like bar coding (40), a method of identifying topological invariants in cloud data. First, sequenced isolates can be transformed in high-dimensional space by using distance measures, such as pairwise genetic distance. From these cloud data, points can be linked together on the basis of certain criteria to form a simplicial complex, i.e., a network of points, line segments, triangles, and even n-dimensional counterparts. When this criterion is a distance less than some , a filtered simplicial complex or Vietoris-Rips stream is created.",
