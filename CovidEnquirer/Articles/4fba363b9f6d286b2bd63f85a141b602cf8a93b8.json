In this study, we have expressed and purified severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) structural proteins and their fragments and developed indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISAs) that detect antibodies against the SARS N, N 1 , N 2 , S 1 , S C , S 2 , and M proteins as well as the human coronavirus OC43 and 229E N proteins. These assays were used to screen 58 samples from SARS convalescent patients, 40 serial serum specimens from patients at different phases of SARS infection, and 88 plasma specimens from normal blood donors. The samples from normal blood donors were also tested for antibodies against other respiratory virus. The representative samples were chosen to comprise a reference panel of SARS antibodies that may be used for the detection of SARS. The panel is composed of 25 positive samples, 25 negative samples, 7 diluted samples for anti-N antibody, 6 diluted samples for anti-S antibody, and one sample for validating precision. Comparison of detection results with different SARS antibody assays indicated that our panel should differentiate the specificity and sensitivity of different assays.",

The severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is a newly identified human coronavirus that differs from all previously known human coronaviruses. Its approximately 30 kb genome is the largest among RNA viruses and encodes 19 non-structural and 4 structural proteins. The structural proteins include the spike (S), nucleocapsid (N), membrane (M) and small envelope (E) proteins. The S protein is a large membrane protein that induces neutralizing antibodies. The N protein, which is thought to participate in the replication and transcription of viral RNA, is also highly immunogenic and induces a strong antibody response. The transmembrane M protein is the most abundant glycoprotein, while the E protein is an integral membrane protein. The viral envelope is embedded with the S, M, and E proteins and surrounds a helical nucleocapsid consisting of viral RNA and the N protein [1e6] . All are immunogenic and should induce an immune response after infection.",

The assays included reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) to detect nucleic acid as well as immunological assays to detect the N antigen and antibodies against SARS-CoV proteins. Diagnostic techniques were chosen based on time, availability of equipment, expertise, and the biological nature of the available samples. Although the detection of N antigen and RNA is very useful for early diagnosis of SARS-CoV infection, antibody detection has been widely used for diagnostic and epidemiological purposes. Therefore, the immunological assays for detection of antibodies were developed in-house and some of them are available commercially. However, the antigens used in these assays differed. Some used inactivated whole virus while others used recombinant polypeptides, even synthesized peptides. Antibodies against different viral proteins or even antigen fragments may be induced. At present, the significance of each antibody in the diagnosis, course, and prognosis of SARS is not absolutely clear. The kinetics of each antibody response and the correlation between the presence of a single antibody and antibodies against the entire virus is also unknown.",

Plasma or sera specimens were added to each well (1:500 dilution) and incubated at 37 C for 1 h. Each well was washed 5 times, incubated with peroxidase-labeled goat antihuman antibody at 37 C for 30 min, then washed again 5 times. The peroxidase reaction was visualized using TMB as a substrate for 15 min at 37 C in the dark. The reaction was stopped by adding 50 ml/well of 1 N H 2 SO 4 and absorbance was read at 450 nm. To determine a cut-off value, 30 specimens from normal blood donors were tested with each ELISA and the mean OD and standard deviation were calculated. The cut-off value was defined as the mean OD plus three standard deviations for each ELISA.",

At present, the significance of each antibody in the diagnosis, course, and prognosis of SARS is unclear, as well as the kinetics of each antibody response Note: The sample was considered as positive if S/CO value is equal to or more than 1. and the correlation between the presence of antibodies against a single protein and antibodies against the entire virus. In this study, the indirect ELISAs were developed with different fragments of SARS structure proteins and used to detect antibodies in 58 SARS plasma specimens donated by convalescent patients 3 months after onset of SARS. The results indicated that most of the expressed proteins reacted to the convalescent plasma. To our surprise, SARS N protein exhibited low antigenic activity while the activities of N 1 and N 2 protein, as the fragments of the whole N protein, were better. The following reasons should explain this phenomenon. Firstly, as was described in Section 2, the SARS N protein were purified with complicated poly-stepped purification methods, this may result in the change of N protein structure or property. Next, since it was expressed in E. coli, perhaps SARS whole N protein could not form its natural structure and the antigen conformational epitopes may be exposed after the protein is fragmented. Moreover, the entire SARS N protein reacted to part of negative samples, too, which revealed there may be cross-reaction between SARS and non-SARS plasma. The same result was reported by Mimoun etc. [10] . Probably there were some antigen epitopes similar to conservative N protein in some human tissue antigen or other undetected pathogen.",

Although the significance of antibodies against the N or S protein is not clear for diagnostic purposes, the assay's sensitivity for both should be validated.

Negative samples Eighty-eight plasma specimens collected from Beijing Blood Center but considered unsuitable for transfusion were screened by commercial ELISA kits to IgG antibodies against influenza A virus, influenza B virus, mycoplasma pneumoniae, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, measles virus, and mumps virus. The positive rates were 100% (88/88), 95.5% (84/88), 4.5% (4/88), 97.7% (86/88), 97.7% (86/88), 100% (88/88), 71.6% (63/88), and 94.3% (83/88), respectively. Twenty-five samples of these samples were used in the panel as negative samples. All were positive for antibodies against influenza A virus, influenza B virus, parainfluenza virus, adenovirus, respiratory syncytial virus, measles virus, and mumps virus, while only 3 of 25 were positive for antibodies against mycoplasma (Table 2).",
