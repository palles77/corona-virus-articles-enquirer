            "text": "Canine leishmaniasis is an important infectious disease worldwide. Although commonly used, antibody tests are often falsely negative, and direct detection of the pathogen, such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) is necessary. However, PCR is only performed in specialized laboratories and not available in less developed countries. The aim of this study was to evaluate sensitivity and specificity of a rapid in-house PCR for the diagnosis of canine Leishmania infantum infection. Prospectively, 515 samples of 251 dogs (201 EDTA blood samples, 244 conjunctival swabs, 19 lymph node aspirates, 51 bone marrow aspirates) were analysed for the presence of Leishmania DNA using the PCRun System (Biogal, Galed Labs. Acs Ltd., Kibbutz Galed, Israel). The results were compared to those of a real time PCR (gold standard) for the identification of Leishmania kinetoplast DNA minicircle. DNA extraction was conducted using DNeasy Blood & Tissue kit (Qiagen GmbH). Sensitivity and specificity with 95% confidence range (CI 95%) were determined.",

The test was easy to perform and provided unambiguous results. In conclusion, the test is recommended for use in practice, and a positive result is proving an infection. A negative result, however, does not exclude infection and therefore requires further diagnostics.",

Prevalence studies have identified this virus in domestic cats in the USA, Australia, Singapore and, most recently, Central Europe, but no data are available for UK cats. The consequences of FcaGHV1 for feline health are yet to be elucidated but in other species, GHV infections are typically clinically silent unless there is immune dysfunction in the natural host, in which case they can cause a range of lymphoproliferative and neoplastic diseases. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence and risk factors for FcaGHV1 infection in pet cats in the UK.",

The prognosis for cats persistently infected with FeLV is poor, most of them developing immunosuppression, anaemia and lymphoma. Due to the development of a natural resistance to FeLV infection with age, current recommendations are to vaccinate cats with a sustained risk of exposure every 2-3 years. Few vaccine efficacy data are available to support this practice. The study objective was to demonstrate the efficacy of Leucofeligen \u00d2 FeLV/RCP (Virbac, Carros, France) three years after the first annual vaccine booster. Twenty-eight specific pathogen free cats of 9-10 weeks of age (14 females, 14 males) participated in the study. 17/28 cats were vaccinated with Leucofeligen \u00d2 FeLV/RCP (\u2265 102 lg purified p45 FeLV-envelope antigen, adjuvanted), with 2 subcutaneous injections 3 weeks apart for primary vaccination and a booster injection one year later. The other 11/28 cats did not receive any vaccine containing a FeLV valence and served as control group. Three years after the first annual booster of the vaccinated group, 25 cats were inoculated with a pathogenic FeLV strain at the dose of 5.10 5 PFU/cat by intraperitoneal route. Cats were regularly observed for appearance of any general health alteration, with body temperature and body weight follow-ups. Blood samples were taken before inoculation and each week from 3 weeks after inoculation for p45 antibody and/or p27 antigen detection by ELISA. P45 antibodies titre > 1/450 at the time of inoculation demonstrated a prolonged humoral immune response to the FeLV valence of Leucofeligen \u00d2 FeLV/RCP. The presence of p27 antigen was an indicator of FeLV infection. A persistent infection was defined as the detection of p27 antigen on three consecutive occasions or on five non-consecutive occasions between week 3 and week 15 after inoculation.",

Canine leishmaniasis is a major global parasitic and zoonotic disease caused by the protozoa Leishmania spp. and is potentially fatal to dogs. Clinical presentation is highly variable with a broad spectrum of signs and degrees of severity and its treatment usually represents a challenge. Due to the elevated prevalence of kidney disease in the canine population with leishmaniasis, it is important to consider an effective treatment drug with few renal side effects. Recent data have shown that marbofloxacin has leishmanicidal effects without causing changes in renal parameters of non-azotemic affected dogs. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy and the effect on renal function of marbofloxacin in dogs with leishmaniasis and concurrent chronic renal disease (CKD). Twenty eight dogs with leishmaniasis and CKD (11 animals in stage 1 and 17 in stage >1; based on IRIS recommendations) and no other coexisting diseases were enrolled in the study. Dogs were treated with oral marbofloxacin at a dose of 2 mg/kg/day for 28 days. Physical exam, blood pressure, CBC, serum chemistry profile, and urinalysis (including urine creatine:protein ratio and urinary cystatin C) were recorded at baseline (day 0) and after treatment with marbofloxacin (day 28) to determine the drug effect on renal function. Lymph node aspirations were also taken at days 0 and 28 to quantify the parasitic load by real-time PCR. Values are expressed as meanAESE. P < 0.05 was considered significant. In the dogs under study the treatment with marbofloxacin was well tolerated with no obvious side effects and the clinical signs related to the disease notably improved. These dogs with impaired renal function evidenced an improvement in some of the CKD biomarkers: a significant decrease in the urinary protein loss (from 3.8 AE 0.5 to 2.9 AE 0.4; P < 0.05) and a significant decrease in systolic blood pressure (from 180.0 AE 6.9 to 170.0 AE 7.3 mmHg; P < 0.05). Moreover, 72% of the dogs showed a significant reduction in parasitic load while in 28% the parasitic load remained stable. In relation to the aforementioned findings, dogs showed a significant increase in plasma albumin concentration (from 15.0 AE 1.0 to 16.6 AE 0.7 g/L; P < 0.05) and a significant decrease in globulin concentration (from 59.0 AE 3.4 to 54.1 AE 3.4 g/L; P < 0.05). No significant changes were found in the other parameters under study. In conclusion and based on these results, marbofloxacin can be chosen as an effective and safe alternative for treatment of dogs with leishmania and concurrent CKD.

Sergi Segarra is employed by Bioiberica SA, Barcelona Biochemical parameters including alanine aminotransferase (ALT) and alkaline phosphatase (AP) are often used to make a presumptive diagnosis of liver disease in the dog. Especially in idiopathic and copper-associated forms or chronic hepatitis, there is a long subclinical phase in which dogs do not show clinical signs of liver disease. However, this would be the phase in which therapeutic intervention may be most effective. In dog breeds with a hereditary predisposition for the development of hepatitis, biochemical screening of subclinical dogs may be a valuable tool to identify affected dogs in an early stage. Therefore, the aim of the study was to determine the sensitivity and specificity of ALT and AP for detecting hepatocellular injury in clinically healthy Labrador retrievers. Hereto, patient files of 198 client-owned clinically healthy Labrador retrievers were reviewed. Labradors underwent a liver biopsy for screening for copper toxicosis as part of the research program into copper associated hepatitis of the Faculty of Veterinary Medicine, Utrecht University. Age, sex, liver histopathology results, ALT and AP were recorded. To determine sensitivity and specificity in these dogs, ROC analyses were used. In total, 69 dogs did not show histological abnormalities (controls) and 129 dogs showed hepatocellular injury (including 39 cases with primary hepatitis and 90 cases with reactive hepatopathy). In all 198 dogs, median ALT was 37 U/L (range 5-733) and median AP was 26 U/L (range 8-3360). Using thresholds of 70 U/L (ALT) and 89 U/L (AP) which are upper reference values in our laboratory, the sensitivity for detecting hepatocellular injury in clinically healthy dogs was 22% for ALT and 10% for AP. Specificity was 93% and 98% for ALT and AP respectively. New thresholds for ALT and AP were determined using the point closest to the top-left part of the plot with perfect sensitivity or specificity. New thresholds were 35 U/L for ALT and 26 U/L for AP. When using these values sensitivity increased to 68% (ALT) and 59% (AP) and specificity decreased to 62% (ALT) and 60% (AP). Overall, both ALT and AP have a very low sensitivity for detection of hepatocellular injury in Labradors with subclinical liver disease. Decreasing the threshold cut-off to improve the sensitivity results in a substantial decrease in specificity.

Excessive hepatic Cu results in hepatocyte damage from oxidative stress, resulting in cell death and subsequent necroinflammatory changes. The accumulation of abnormal hepatic Cu and inflammatory liver disease in the dog has been linked to genetic metabolic derangements in copper metabolism, environmental factors such as excessive dietary copper intake and/or the result of cholestatic disorders. Chelation therapy and low Cu diets are often successful in management of cases having abnormal hepatic Cu. The goal of this study was to determine the incidence of abnormal hepatic Cu in liver biopsies submitted to our diagnostic laboratory and to then correlate the hepatic Cu concentrations with the histolopathological diagnosis. We hypothesize that hepatic Cu would be higher in dogs with necroinflammatory liver changes compared to those with non-inflammatory changes. A second aim was to determine if the concentration of hepatic Cu was related to the extent of hepatic inflammation.",

            "text": "Disclosures Hepatobiliary diseases are commonly encountered in dogs and can be divided into four main categories: parenchymal, biliary, vascular, or neoplastic disorders. In many cases clinical signs of hepatobiliary diseases are non-specific. Current biochemical indicators can establish the presence of hepatobiliary disease, but cannot specify underlying disease and a thorough and extensive diagnostic workup is needed. Recently, microRNAs (miRs) have been identified as promising new serum biomarkers for hepatobiliary disease in humans and dogs. The aim of the present study was to investigate whether serum levels of an established group of microRNAs can be used to differentiate between various hepatobiliary diseases in dogs. Real-time polymerase chain reaction was used for quantification of 6 microRNAs (miR-21, miR-122, miR-126, miR-148a, miR-200c, and miR-222) in serum of 46 dogs with an established diagnosis of hepatobiliary disease compared to 11 healthy dogs. Hepatobiliary diseases included parenchymal (acute/chronic hepatitis), biliary (mucoceles/cholangitis and extra hepatic bile duct obstruction), vascular (congenital portosystemic shunts), and neoplastic (adenomas/carcinomas/malignant lymphomas) subgroups. Linear regression was used to investigate the effect of diagnostic subgroup on the serum levels of the natural logarithm of the different microRNAs, with healthy dogs as reference category. P-values were adjusted for multiple comparisons using the Benjamin-Hochberg correction. With a microRNA panel consisting of miR-21, miR-122, miR-126, miR-200c, and miR-222 it was possible to distinguish between parenchymal, biliary, and neoplastic hepatobiliary diseases. Within these groups, a differentiation between all above mentioned subgroups could be made. No differential microRNA expression was found in the adenoma and congenital portosystemic shunt groups. All other subgroups had increased levels of one or more microRNAs. MicroRNA-122 and miR-21 were both associated with hepatobiliary disease in general, while miR-126 and miR-200c were uniquely upregulated in chronic hepatitis and hepatocellular carcinomas, respectively. This study shows that serum microRNA profiling is a promising new tool that can be valuable in diagnosing and differentiating several common hepatobiliary diseases in dogs.",

The aim of this retrospectvive study was to determine whether the aorto-septal angle (AoSA), assessed by echocardiography, is correlated with the presence of a systolic murmur in cardiologically normal cats. The medical records between January 2014 and March 2016 have been reviewed. Inclusion criteria included a normal echocardiographic exam, regardless the presence of a cardiac murmur. Cats had also to be normotensive (systolic blood pressure < 160 mmHg) and euthyroid. Cats with echocardiographic evidence of dynamic right ventricular outflow obstruction were not included. Cats with normal diastolic thickness of the left ventricle but mild hypertrophy of the sub-aortic portion of the interventricular septum were also included. The AoSA was measured from the right parasternal five chambers view as previously described. For each echocardiographic parameter, the mean of three consecutive measures was used for statistics. Forty-one cats of different breed were included; 21 females and 20 males, aging 6.4 AE 5.5 (mean AE SD); 22 with a cardiac murmur, 19 without a cardiac murmur. The AoSA in cats with a cardiac murmur (131.1\u00b0AE 8.6\u00b0) was significantly narrower (P = 0.048) than AoSA in cats without a cardiac murmur (136.3\u00b0AE 7.2\u00b0). The presence of septal hypertrophy was not associated with the presence of a systolic murmur (P = 0.41). Cats with septal hypertrophy were older (P = 0.0037), however there was not correlation between AoSA and age (P > 0.05). In conclusion, a narrow AoSA is associated with the presence of a systolic murmur in cats and might be considered as potential cause of ejection murmur in apparently healthy cats. A longitudinal study is needed to assess if a narrow AoSA might play a role in the remodeling of the interventricular septum at the level of the left outflow tract. Disclosures: No disclosures to report. A high degree of accuracy is required when using echocardiography to diagnose hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (HCM) in cats, as variation in measurements of 0.5 mm may affect classification of individuals as 'normal' or 'abnormal'. This study in adult cats analysed inter-observer variability between two echocardiographers with specialist veterinary cardiology training. Twenty-four female European shorthair cats, colony-housed compliant with EU regulations, were examined at 12, 18 and 24 months of age by observer 1 (Obs-1). Cardiac ultrasound images (2D) were taken in conscious cats to measure: aortic diameter (Ao), left atrial diameter (LA), diastolic interventricular septum (IVSd), diastolic interventricular septum outflow (IVSd-LVOT), diastolic and systolic left ventricular internal dimension (LVIDd/s), diastolic left ventricular free wall (LVPWd) and left ventricular free wall outflow (LVPWd-LVOT). Cardiac ultrasound measurements were repeated by observer 2 (Obs-2) on stored images. Measurements were analysed for effect of age, observer (mean value for the 3 time points) and age-observer interaction. Additionally, based on IVSd and LVPW thickness, cats were categorized as 'normal' (\u2264 6 mm or \u2264 5 mm in cats <6 kg BW) or 'abnormal ' (Gundler et al. 2008) . Linear mixed models (generalised when appropriate) were performed using SAS v9.3. Cat was defined as a random term.

The objective of this study was to evaluate effects of the sedation combination dexmedetomidine and buprenorphine on echocardiographic variables, blood pressure and heart rate (HR) in healthy cats. 50 healthy client-owned cats were prospectively included in the study. Cats were sedated with dexmedetomidine and buprenorphine. Doses were adjusted to body weight. Standard echocardiographic and Doppler examinations, blood pressure and HR measurements were performed prior to sedation and repeated ten minutes after sedation.

However, physical examination (PE) alone may be insufficient to differentiate causes of dyspnea and patient instability frequently necessitates delay of radiography and echocardiography. In human patients, emergency clinicianperformed focused cardiac ultrasound (FCU) helps differentiate causes of dyspnea quickly and safely. We hypothesized that FCU performed by emergency and critical care (ECC) clinicians would improve diagnostic accuracy in dyspneic dogs compared to medical history and PE alone. ECC faculty and residents underwent a 3-hour structured FCU training program. Goals included recognizing basic cardiac structure and function and quantitatively measuring left atrial and aortic root diameter (LA/Ao) from right parasternal views. Dogs presenting with dyspnea to the University of Pennsylvania Veterinary Hospital were prospectively recruited. Exclusion criteria included intravenous fluid therapy within 72 hours of presentation, known trauma, and severe systemic disease precluding participation. Medical history, PE, and FCU were obtained at presentation. The ECC clinician, blinded to any radiographic or echocardiographic data, recorded a diagnosis of respiratory (R) or cardiac (C) before and after FCU.

Precordial lead system consists in a group of unipolar leads placed on the thoracic surface, which record the electrical activity of the heart on the horizontal plane. In human medicine, the sequence of ventricular depolarization results in a characteristic QRS complex pattern in each precordial lead: rS with a R:S ratio < 1 in the right precordial lead (V1) and qR in the left precordial leads (V5-V6). The purpose of this prospective study was to evaluate the QRS complex morphology in precordial leads using a previously described precordial lead system in dogs with different morphotypes. Sixty healthy dogs were enrolled and underwent physical examination, thoracic radiographs, 12-lead electrocardiogram using a system previously described and standard echocardiography. The dogs were allocated in three groups according the thoracic index (dorso-ventral thorax diameter x 100/latero-lateral thorax diameter): 90-100 brachycephalic, 50-60 dolicocephalic and 60-90 mesocephalic. The Shapiro-Wilcoxon W-test was used to test normality. Mean value AE standard deviation as well median and range was calculated. Non-parametric analysis of variance was performed on data to evaluate difference on QRS complex appearance among three thorax shape, by Kruskas Wallis test. To evaluate repeatability between three measurements the intraclass correlation coefficient was executed. All data analysis was performed by commercial available statistical software (SAS v9.2). Q wave was absent in V1, V2, V3 and V4 in all groups, present in V5 in dolicocephalic group and in V6 in all the groups. R wave amplitude in all precordial leads was statistically different between the three groups (P = 0.0000). Brachycephalic group showed lowest R wave amplitude, while the dolicocephalic group presented the highest R wave amplitude. S wave in V3 (P = 0.041) and V6 (P = 0.046) was statistically different between the three groups, showing the highest amplitude in the dolicocephalic group, and the lowest amplitude in mesocephalic group. R:S ratio in all precordial leads except V6 was statistically different between the three groups. In lead V1, brachycephalic dogs presented a ratio R:S < 1 while dolicocephalic and mesocephalic dog R:S > 1 (P = 0.0005). Based on this data, the previously proposed precordial lead system provides a correct evaluation of the ventricular depolarization of the right ventricle in lead V1 just in brachiocephalic dogs due to the different orientation of the cardiac dipole in the thorax. Further studies are needed to evaluate an alternative positioning of lead V1 in the latter two groups of dogs.",

In humans, early identification of the same disease is possible through the detection or repolarisation abnormalities on precordial chest leads: particularly T-wave inversion and possibly J-point abnormalities. We hypothesized that these same ECG abnormalities would be able to identify ARVC in a population of Boxer dogs. 12-lead ECGs were prospectively recorded from adult Boxer dogs presenting to the Cardiology services of five veterinary referral centres and one general practice in the UK. Dogs with aortic stenosis were excluded. ARVC (n = 21) was diagnosed based upon the presence of >50 VPCs/24 h on Holter. Control dogs (n = 34) had no evidence of ventricular arrhythmia, no significant heart murmur, and no clinical signs or history of cardiovascular disease. T waves were classified as positive or negative in each pre-cordial chest lead (V1-V6), and J waves were recorded as present or absent, with identification of J-point slurring or notching as described for humans. There was no significant difference in age, weight or sex between groups. J-point abnormalities were identified in up to 48% of dogs (greatest in lead V4, but variable between different precordial leads). There was no significant difference in the frequency with which J-point abnormalities were identified in dogs with ARVC vs. controls (P > 0.272).

All dogs with a murmur underwent an echocardiogram on the same day performed by the same cardiologist who auscultated the dogs. In the referred dogs a wide range of congenital anomalies was found. Besides, a phonocardiogram was recorded with an electronic stethoscope at the point of maximal intensity of the murmur. The phonocardiograms were viewed and analyzed on a computer screen. For quantitative description of the phonocardiograms, murmur-to-systole duration ratios were calculated. The median NT-proBNP level of puppies without a murmur did not differ from that of the puppies with an innocent murmur: 300 (range 102-1224) versus 326 (range 102-1340) pmol/L, (P = 0.405).

Like American Cocker Spaniels, also ECS diagnosed with DCM phenotype are commonly affected by taurine deficiency. Considering their MST, the prognosis for ECS with DCM may be better than other breeds affected by DCM. In addition, the MST of taurine deficiency ECS may be better than ECS with normal taurine levels. Larger samples and prospective studies are needed.",

Altered heart rate variability (HRV) is associated with human disease severity and outcome, however canine HRV studies have largely failed to show a similar relationship. Electronic measurement of cardiac vagal tone (cardiac index of parasympathetic activity, CIPA) has prognostic value in dogs, however measurement is impractical in a clinical setting. Deceleration capacity (DC), a a novel measure of vagal tone, quantifies deceleration-related heart rate modulation from 24-hour ECG recordings and is a powerful predictor of human cardiac mortality. The prognostic value of DC measurement in canine heart disease is unknown. We sought to assess DC in a population of normal Doberman pinschers and those affected with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM). Clinical records and Holter data were collected retrospectively from 64 client-owned Doberman pinschers, comprising 20 healthy animals (NORMAL), 30 with preclinical DCM (DCM) and 14 with DCM and congestive heart failure (DCM-CHF). Accepted echocardiographic measurement criteria were used for the diagnosis of DCM. The NORMAL group were healthy dogs presented for DCM screening. The DCM group included dogs identified previously for a large, multicentre, prospective clinical trial (PRO-TECT trial) as well as clinical cases presented for screening, with the same inclusion criteria. Quantitative Holter analysis was performed and data exported for measurement of DC.",

Familiar dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) is a primary cardiac disease with genetic predisposition causing mainly left ventricular systolic failure. To the best to the authors knowledge there are no data regarding echocardiographic difference between these two disorders in the dog. The aim of this study was, therefore, to retrospectively evaluate echocardiographic parameters in dogs with AICM secondary to sustained accessory pathways-mediated tachycardia (APMT) and in dogs with familiar DCM. According to the breed and the presence of APMT two groups of dogs were made, and for each group reported monodimensional and B-dimensional echocardiographic measurements indexed to body surface area were taken by one author (MP). Group A included 21 dogs of different breeds with a mean age (AE SD) of 2.8 AE 2.1 years, a mean body weight of 28.0 AE 6.7 kg, and M:F 2.5:1 with AICM induced by APMT diagnosed with endocardial mapping prior to the ablation of the accessory pathway, group B, 12 Doberman Pinschers with mean age of 7.3 AE 2.3 years, a mean body weight of 34.8 AE 7.0 kg, a M:F 1.4:1 with familiar DCM. In group A echocardiographic parameters obtained during sinus rhythm and during APMT were compared to assess the effects of acute changes in heart rate. Echocardiographic measurements obtained in both groups during sinus rhythm were then compared to determine possible screening factors to differentiate these two entities. Normal distribution of values was assessed by the Shapiro-Wilk W-test. Normally distributed data were tested using Student's t-test and non-normally distributed data using Wilcoxon's sum rank test. In group A, shortening fraction (FS) and 2-D ejection fraction (EF) were significantly higher during sinus rhythm than during tachycardia (P respectively 0.001 and 0.004). Shortening fraction and 2D EF were significantly higher in group A than in group B (P respectively 0.002 and 0.007) while end-diastolic volume index, end-systolic volume index and E-point-septal separation were significantly lower than in group B (P respectively 0.03, 0.001, 0.01). The echocardiographic difference between AICM dogs and DCM dogs found may reflect different pathophysiologic mechanisms or different rate of evolution of these myocardial diseases. Further studies are needed to determine cut-off values allowing the differentiation between AICM and familiar DCM.",

Henk van den Broek (first/ presenting author) is PhD student of the project at the Royal Veterinary College. Feline morbillivirus (FmoPV) was originally discovered in Hong Kong in 2012 and suggested to be associated with tubulo-interstitial nephritis. It has since been detected in the urine of cats in Japan, USA and Germany. The aim of this study was to identify paramyxoviruses (including morbillivirus) in urine samples of geriatric cats with and without azotaemic CKD, to establish if a relationship between FmoPV and azotaemic CKD exists. In addition, urinary markers of tubular damage and dysfunction were evaluated in nonazotaemic cats with and without FmoPV or other paramyxoviruses.",

Measurement of urinary alkaline phosphatase (uALP) and urinary c-glutamyl transpeptidase (uGGT) activities is readily available and inexpensive. Most studies of uGGT and uALP are limited to small number of dogs with AKI of a single etiology or to experimentally-induced AKI. We aimed to investigate their clinical utility for diagnosing naturally occurring AKI in a large, heterogeneous group of dogs. The study included client-owned dogs with AKI (34 dogs), chronic kidney disease (CKD, 13), urinary tract infection (UTI, 15) and healthy controls (51). uALP and uGGT activities were normalized to urinary creatinine concentration (uALP/uCrea and uGGT/uCrea, respectively). uALP/ uCrea and uGGT/uCrea significantly correlated (r = 0.67, P < 0.001). Both differed significantly (P < 0.001) among study groups, and between the AKI group and either the UTI or CKD groups (P < 0.05), but not the control group. Areas under the receiver operator characteristics curves for uALP/uCrea and uGGT/uCrea as predictors of AKI were 0.68 and 0.61, respectively. Optimal cut-off points for uALP/uCrea and uGGT/uCrea showed poor sensitivity/specificity (58%/70% and 58%/68%, respectively). Higher cut-off points with 90% specificity were associated with decreased sensitivity (38%, 41%, respectively).In conclusion, uGGT/uCrea and uALP/uCrea demonstrated poor discriminatory power for diagnosing AKI in dogs, contrary to previous reports of naturally-occurring and experimentally-induced AKI, and therefore cannot be recommended as screening tests for AKI. uALP/uCrea is a superior marker of AKI to uGGT/uCrea. Since both measures are readily available and inexpensive, they may serve as ancillary biomarkers for early detection of AKI, if appropriate cut-off points, with high specificities, are used.",

Cystinuria is a classical inborn error of metabolism characterized by a selective proximal renal tubular defect affecting cystine, ornithine, lysine, and arginine (COLA) reabsorption, leading to cystine crystals and urolithiasis. Cystinuria is caused by defects in one of two genes, SLC3A1 and SLC7A9, which encode the rBAT and b o,+ AT subunits of the b o,+ basic amino acid transporter system. We document here the first SLC3A1 and SLC7A9 mutations causing cystinuria in cats. Crystallograpic and amino acid tests were used to assess cystinuria. Exons and flanking regions of the SLC3A1 and SLC7A9 genes were sequenced from genomic DNA. Compared to the Felis catus-6.2 reference genome sequence, DNA sequences from these affected cats revealed 4 unique homozygous missense mutations: one in exon 8 (p.Arg448Trp) in SLC3A1 from a non-purpose-bred short-haired cat, and the others in the SLC7A9 gene: one in exon 5 (p.Asp236Asn) from a non-purpose-bred medium-haired cat, one in exon 7 (p.Val294Glu) in 2 Maine Coon and Sphinx cats, and one in exon 10 (p.Thr392Met) from a non-purpose-bred longhaired cat. Genotyping assays identified another cystinuric domestic medium-haired cat that was homozygous for the mutation originally identified in the purebred cats. These missense mutations result in deleterious amino acid substitutions of highly conserved residues in the b o,+ AT protein. The remaining 2 sequenced domestic short-haired cats had a heterozygous single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) at a splice donor site and a homozygous SNP at a branchpoint of SLC7A9, respectively.",

It is a common finding in dogs with predisposing conditions. The pathogenic potential of associated bacteria is not clearly understood, suggesting that these dogs require at least monitoring. This retrospective case-crossover study sought to describe SBU in dogs that were followed longitudinally. Dogs that had cultures and concurrent urinalysis of cystocentesis-derived urine performed on more than one occasion were identified from the records of U-Vet Animal Hospital Werribee. Urine samples of dogs that were treated with antibiotics were excluded. Based on urine culture results and recorded clinical signs, dogs were classified as having clinical urinary tract infection, SBU or no growth of bacteria. Age, breed, sex, neuter status, concurrent conditions, microorganism cultured and urinalysis parameters were recorded. In each dog, urinalysis of SBU episodes and no-growth episodes were compared using conditional logistic regression with the aim to assess the value of individual urinalysis parameters in predicting SBU in each dog. A total of 44 dogs were included with a total of 151 paired urinalysis and culture results. A median of 3 paired results (range 2-13) were reviewed in each dog. Many dogs had predisposing conditions; most common were changes in urine composition caused by endocrine disease or drugs (n = 18; 41%) or renal disease (n = 9; 20%). In 9 dogs (20%), no underlying condition was recorded. Dogs were of various breeds, predominantly female spayed (n = 29; 65%) and senior (median age 9 years, range 0.3-17). The most commonly cultured organisms in SBU were Escherichia coli (n = 22; 52%) and Enterococcus spp (n = 6; 14%). Five dogs had SBU with multi-drug resistant bacteria. Whilst urinalysis parameters were often abnormal in the individual dogs, only pyuria (identified by microscopic sediment examination) was reliable in differentiating SBU from no-growth episodes (OR 34; 95% CI 4.5-266). This suggests that urinalysis parameters other than pyuria commonly reflect a concurrent disease process rather than SBU. Furthermore, it confirms that urine sediment analysis is crucial in monitoring dogs affected by conditions that predispose to SBU or UTI, particularly if urine culture is not planned.",

Although culture of urine sampled directly from the renal pelvis is the gold standard to confirm pyelonephritis, culture of urine obtained by cystocentesis is most commonly performed. But in case of ureteral obstruction culture of urine collected by cystocentesis could be negative because of interruption of urine flow in the affected ureter. The objectives of this study were to determine the incidence of pyelonephritis in feline ureteral obstruction, to investigate if clinical signs and laboratory findings could help diagnose pyelonephritis and to compare results of urine culture obtained by pyelocentesis and cystocentesis in the same individuals. Cats in which pyelocentesis was performed during surgical management of ureteral obstruction were retrospectively included. Pyelonephritis was diagnosed if a positive urine culture was obtained in the sample collected by pyelocentesis. Signalment, clinicopathologic data and abdominal ultrasonography findings were compared between cats with pyelonephritis (group P+) and cats with negative urine culture obtained by pyelocentesis (group P-). Forty-five cats were included. Culture of urine collected by pyelocentesis was positive in 8 of 45 (18%) cats. The isolates were E. coli (n = 3), Raoultella Terrigina (n = 3), Enterobacter cloacae (n = 1) and Enterococcus faecalis (n = 1). The cats in the P+ group were significantly older than in the P-group. The average monocyte count was significantly higher in the P+ group. No significant differences were observed concerning clinical data, other laboratory findings or results of abdominal ultrasonography between the two groups. Three of 8 cats of the P+ group and 9 of 37 cats of the P-group had received antibiotic therapy prior to the urine culture. In thirty-three cats (7 from P+ group, 26 from P-group) urinary culture was also performed in samples collected by cystocentesis. In 4 of 7 (57%) cases from the P+ group, the urine obtained by cystocentesis was sterile and in 3 of 7 (43%) cases culture results were similar between the samples collected by pyelocentesis and cystocentesis. Two of 26 (8%) cats from the P-group had a positive urine culture obtained by cystocentesis. In this study, the incidence of pyelonephritis in cats with ureteral obstruction was 18%. Feline ureterolithiasis is one of the most common causes of acute azotaemia in cats.

She has received financial support for her endocrine research from various companies such as Nestle Purina, Hills, Provet, Antlia SA, Glycemicon and from the clinical studies fund of the ECVIM-CA and from the Society of Comparative Endocrinology. Treatment of canine diabetes mellitus (DM) always requires exogenous insulin therapy. Two types of commonly used insulin are lente insulin and Neutral Protamin Hegerdon (NPH) insulin. The aim of this prospective, randomized clinical trial was to compare the effects of lente and NPH insulin in dogs with DM. Clientowned dogs with newly diagnosed DM were enrolled. Dogs with relevant concurrent diseases and with prior administration of diabetogenic drugs were excluded. Dogs were randomized into two groups such as lente insulin (Caninsulin \u00d2 ) and NPH insulin (Humulin I \u00d2 ). In each group dogs were treated with insulin SC, BID and fed BID with the same commercial diet low in simple carbohydrates and high in fiber. Follow-up evaluations were done at 1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 12 weeks. At each re-evaluation a physical exam, blood glucose curve (BGC) and serum fructosamine concentrations were performed. The glycemic control was classified as good on the basis of absence of PU/PD, body weight stability, normal attitude/activity and >50% of the values in the BGC within 90 and 270 mg/dL. Eight dogs were treated with lente and 12 with NPH insulin. At the time of diagnosis (T0) both groups were homogenous considering age, body weight, gender, serum glucose concentrations and serum fructosamine concentrations. At the last re-evaluation (T12) mean(AESD) glucose concentrations of BGCs and median(range) serum fructosamine concentrations evaluated in the lente group were 279 mg/dL (AE53), 474 lg/dL (336-749) and in the NPH group were 219 mg/dL (AE114), 419 lg/dL (292-597), respectively; such differences were not significant between groups. Median(range) lente insulin dose per injection at T0 [0.35 U/kg (0.3-0.6)] was significantly lower (P = 0.007) compared with T12 (0.6 U/kg;0.4-0.9); median dose of NPH was not significantly different between T0 (0.3 U/kg; 0.1-0.4) and T12 (0.5 U/kg;0.2-0.7). Median fructosamine concentrations at T12 were significantly lower (P = 0.01) compared to T0 in the NPH group but not in the lente group (P = 0.4). At T12 good glycemic control was found in 25% (2/8) and in 75% (9/12) of dogs treated with lente and NPH insulin, respectively; however the difference was not significant (P = 0.06). Hypoglycemic events (nadir <90 mg/dL) were identified in 4 patients (4% of the BGCs in the lente group and 7% in the NPH group) and such difference was not significant. According to our preliminary results the use of both insulin preparates is effective in the treatment of dogs with DM, however the success rate with NPH insulin seems to be greater than that with lente insulin.",

Feline hypersomatotropism (HS) (which results in acromegaly) is typically caused by a growth-hormone (GH) secreting pituitary adenoma and is thought to be a common cause of feline diabetes mellitus. Medical pituitary inhibition has been challenging in some humans and cats with this condition. This could be related to variable expression of somatostatin (SSTR) and dopamine (DR) receptor expression. There are five different SSTR subtypes (SSTR1-5) and five different subtypes of DRs, with D2R being the predominant DR subtype in the human pituitary. Pasireotide, a somatostatin analogue with high binding affinity to SSTR1, SSTR2 and SSTR5, is effective at controlling GH secretion in feline acromegalics but somatostatin analogues with high binding affinity to SSTR2 (octreotide and lanreotide) are not.

Approximately 30% will recover normal thyroid function within a few months, but hypothyroidism persists for months in most cats. New or progressive azotemia appears to be the most important clinical feature associated with feline hypothyroidism. Whether hypothyroid cats (especially subclinical) without azotemia should be treated with L-T 4 is unclear, especially when serum T4 concentrations remain well within the reference interval.",

Canine hypercortisolism is usually treated medically with either mitotane or trilostane. They are both effective in suppressing cortisol secretion and a good treatment option in case of pituitarydependent hypercortisolism, but in case of a cortisol-secreting adrenocortical tumor (AT), a suppressive effect on the AT growth is desirable as well. This can be achieved with high dosages of mitotane, however this approach is associated with side effects and there is a concern about mitotane toxicity in households with pregnant women and/or children. Steroidogenic factor-1 (SF-1), an orphan nuclear hormone receptor, is a key regulator of both adrenal steroidogenesis and proliferation. Modulation of SF-1 activity could possibly be an interesting therapeutic target in canine hypercortisolism.",

FRD shares many similarities to Coeliac Disease (CD) in humans, such as complete response to strict elimination diet, and typical histological findings such as shortening of the small intestinal villi. Autoantibodies used to test for CD in humans include anti-reticulin, anti-endomysium (anti-EMA) and anti-de-amidated gliadin peptide antibodies. The aim of this study was to test the hypothesis that anti-reticulin, anti-EMA and de-amidated gliadin antibodies can be useful for the diagnosis of FRD in dogs. We hypothesized that anti-EMA antibodies would be detected more frequently in dogs with FRD compared to healthy dogs and dogs with SRD. Antibodies were detected using a human indirect immunofluorescence assay that was adapted for use in canine patients. Tissues on the BIOCHIP TM (Euroimmun Ltd, GE) for this assay included primate intestine, primate oesophagus, primate liver and GAF-3X (synthetic de-amidated gliadin antigen). Use of these BIOCHIPs TM yields a characteristic fluorescence pattern if samples are considered to be positive. Serum was evaluated from 20 healthy control dogs, 17 dogs with FRD, and 28 dogs with SRD. All dogs underwent rigorous diagnostic investigations including clinical staging using the severity scoring (CCECAI), comprehensive laboratory evaluation, ultrasonographic examination of the abdomen and endoscopy with intestinal biopsies. Healthy control dogs and SRD dogs tested negative for any autoantibodies. All dogs with FRD tested negative for antibodies directed against endomysium and de-amidated gliadin peptides, however, five out of 17 dogs with FRD tested positive for anti-reticulin antibodies. There was a significant association between the presence of food-responsive disease and a positive immunofluorescence response for anti-reticulin antibodies when compared to the healthy control (P = 0.014) and SRD groups (P = 0.009). Although the immunofluorescence pattern visualized was not typical for anti-reticulin patterns usually seen with CD, this finding may indicate the presence of autoantibodies against EMA in dogs with FRD and may warrant further study in larger cohorts.",

However, neither age nor weight were significantly different between the groups. Chronic vomiting was the main presenting complaint ( Defining the presence, distribution, and severity of GI disease in endoscopic biopsy specimens from dogs with inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) is difficult. Prior studies have failed to detect a convincing association between mucosal histopathology and clinical signs, or response to therapy and outcome in dogs with IBD. For this reason, a standardized grading scheme for the interpretation of GI histopathologic findings was introduced (WSAVA grading scheme). However, no larger scale studies so far have evaluated whether clinical scoring systems linearly correlate with the WSAVA histopathological grading scheme. Such information would be useful for the clinician as WSAVA grading could be used to monitor treatment response and may give prognostic information. The aim of this study was to evaluate whether dogs that were diagnosed with IBD and had clinical scoring performed using the Canine Chronic Enteropathy Clinical Activity Index (CCE-CAI) and histopathology scoring using the WSAVA scoring scheme are linearly correlated to one another. Electronic data of WSAVA graded endoscopically retrieved biopsy scores assigned by a veterinary pathologist at one single centre were collected. A maximum of five sites were evaluated per animal: stomach; pylorus (n = 87) and fundus (n = 46), duodenum (n = 96), ileum (n = 37) and colon (n = 61). One hundred and two dogs diagnosed with IBD were included in this study. WSAVA scores were compared to the CCECAI scores assigned to the animals at the time of diagnosis. Linear correlation was assessed using Spearman Rank's test. Linear correlation of scores was very weak, with r 2 ranging from 0.009 to 0.249 (gastric fundus; r 2 = 0.05, gastric pylorus; r 2 = 0.028, duodenum; r 2 = 0.249, ileum; r 2 = 0.009 and colon; r 2 = 0.095).",

Studies correlating scores before and after treatment in large numbers of dogs are indicated to further evaluate predictive ability of the WSAVA score. The microbial community composition in the gut is largely influenced by diet and may affect health. In humans, a diet dominated by red meat has been associated with colonic diseases such as IBD and colorectal cancer, and gut bacteria may play a role in the etiology.

Twelve GSDs and twenty non-GSDs evaluated between March and October 2013 at the Royal Veterinary College (London, UK) were included in the study. The diagnosis of LP-IBD was based on clinical signs, intestinal histopathology, and exclusion of other known causes of gastro-intestinal signs. E. coli was cultured from endoscopically collected mucosal biopsy material on Sheep Blood agar and MacConkey. Colonies showing characteristics consistent with E. coli were identified using API20E (bioM erieux). DNA was extracted from the strains using the MagNA Pure 96 \u00d2 System (Roche), followed by loop-mediated isothermal PCR amplification (LAMP) to detect the presence of shigatoxin (stx1 und stx2), heatstable enterotoxin (sta), and attaching and effacing (intimin) gene (eae). A total number of 47 mucosa-associated E.coli strains were isolated from 26/32 dogs. There was a higher frequency of E.coli strains being isolated in GSDs (12/12, with 1-6 positive cultures per dog) vs. dogs of other breeds (14/20, with 0-2 positive cultures per dog)( P = 0.035). None of the E.coli strains were positive for stx1, stx2 or sta. The eae gene was found in 4 strains and eae-positive E. coli were more frequently isolated from GSD (4/12; 33%) than other breeds with LP-IBD (0/20; 0%) (P = 0.006). These results suggest that E.coli carrying the eae gene and possibly other, yet to be investigated virulence factors could be involved in the pathogenesis of LP-IBD in GSDs.",

In order to investigate the applicability of APPs as biomarkers of treatment response in dogs with BP, serum C-reactive protein (CRP), serum amyloid A (SAA) and haptoglobin (Hp) were followed simultaneously along with hematology, serum biochemistry, arterial blood gas analysis and thoracic radiographs during a natural course of BP (n = 19). 64 healthy dogs were included as controls. All measured APPs were initially significantly elevated in dogs with BP compared to healthy controls, but the magnitude of elevation was not connected to disease severity. CRP and SAA reflected well the recovery process and declined rapidly after initiation of therapy. Normalization of serum CRP was applied to guide the length of antibiotic therapy (therapy was stopped 5-7 days after CRP normalization) in 9/17 dogs surviving to discharge (median treatment length 21 days, IQR 19-29 days), whereas 8/17 dogs were treated according to conventional recommendations (median 35, IQR 29-48 respectively). When CRP was applied to guide antibiotic therapy, treatment length was significantly (P = 0.015) reduced without increasing the number of relapses. According to this study serum CRP and SAA may be used as biomarkers of treatment response and the normalization of serum CRP may be applied to guide the length of antibiotic therapy in dogs with BP.",

BOAS causes respiratory distress, heat and exercise intolerance, and gastrointestinal signs. The English Bulldog (EB) is one of the brachycephalic breeds with a high prevalence of BOAS. Currently, the severity of BOAS signs is subjectively assessed. To improve the welfare of brachycephalic breeds, an objective and easy-to-use tool is needed to help breeders to select healthier animals. Exercise tests, such as the 6-min walk test (distance walked measured) or the 1000-m walk test (time to complete measured), could be used to assess the level of BOAS, as exercise intolerance and impaired recovery are key features of BOAS. This study evaluated the severity of signs and anatomic components of BOAS in a group of prospectively recruited young adult EBs (n = 28) and investigated how well the results of the 6-min walk test and the 1000-m walk test correlate with severity of BOAS. EBs with more severe BOAS walked a shorter distance, longer time and their recovery from exercise took longer than those with only mild signs of BOAS. Control dogs of different breeds (n = 10) performed the exercise tests significantly better than EBs. Body temperature rise during exercise was significantly higher in EBs than in controls. The results of this study support the use of exercise tests for objective evaluation of the level of BOAS.",

Chemotherapy dose intensity is theoretically important for maximal tumour response, suggesting determination of an optimal neutrophil \"cutoff\"is also important. Similarly, arbitrary guidelines are utilized for the administration of prophylactic antibiotics for neutropenic dogs. The primary objective of this study was to evaluate the impact of various pre-treatment absolute neutrophil count (ANC) \"cutoffs\"on chemotherapy administration and to determine if there was an association between pre-treatment ANC and incidence and severity of toxicity.

Seven dose levels were evaluated to determine the recommended dose: 35 mg/m 2 (n = 3), 42 mg/m 2 (n = 5), 50 mg/m 2 (n = 4), 60 mg/m 2 (n = 3), 75 mg/m 2 (n = 4), 100 mg/m 2 (n = 6) and 120 mg/m 2 (n = 2). The protocol consisted of three cycles of etoposide phosphate (ETOPOPHOS \u00d2 ) IV injections every 2 weeks, with a 3-hour injection once daily on 3 consecutive days. Adverse effects were graded according to the Veterinary Cooperative Oncology Group criteria. A complete end-staging was realized 60 days after inclusion (D60).",

Previous work has demonstrated that canine melanoma cell lines may contain activated AKT and mTOR pathways, as well as sensitivity to mTOR inhibitors, such as rapamycin. The aim of this study was to assess combination treatment using dual inhibition of PI3k and mTOR and compare results to that achieved with inhibition of each pathway individually. Five established primary canine melanoma cell lines were grown in monolayer culture in vitro under standard conditions. Cell lines were derived from a canine primary oral melanoma, primary cutaneous melanoma, metastatic lymph node, or subcutaneous metastasis. Cells were treated with PI3k inhibitor LY294002, mTOR inhibitor rapamycin, or dual inhibitor GSK2126458 for 24 -72 hours. Cell viability was assessed using resazurin dye, with absorbance read on a spectrophotometer. Western blot was used to evaluate drug treatment impact on pathway components, including phosphorylated and total AKT, mTOR, and p70S6K. A dose-dependent decrease in cell viability was observed in all cell lines. Dual inhibition of PI3k and mTOR with GSK2126458 was more potent in pathway target inhibition and resulted in lower cell viability IC50 values than either of the other drugs tested. Dual inhibition of PI3k and mTOR may be more efficacious than single pathway targeting in canine melanoma cells. Future studies will assess the potential for this targeted strategy to sensitize the chemotherapy response in this notoriously treatment resistant tumour type. Disclosures: No disclosures to report. The nutritional status of the patient is usually evaluated recording the body weight (BW) and assessing body condition score (BCS) and muscle condition score (MCS). Because differences in scoring could exist among trained and untrained veterinary personnel, the aim of the study was to assess the reproducibility of these scoring techniques between different operators in dogs. Seventy-five adult dogs (30 Boxers; 16 English Cocker Spaniel; 22 Golden Retriever; 7 Labrador Retriever) were weighted and blinded assessed for BCS and MCS by five different evaluators (i.e. internist, nutritionist, behaviorist, vet student and dog show judge), according to the official nutritional guidelines. In particular, BCS scoring was evaluated using a 9-points scale, while the MCS scoring considered the visual examination and the palpation of the muscle over the temporal bones, scapulae, ribs, lumbar vertebrae and pelvic bones. Chi-square test was performed and statistical significance of the analysis was set at P <0.05. The agreement between the different operators scoring was evaluated by Cohen's kappa.",

Many pet owners are unsuccessful in reducing their pet's body weight. A critical component of a successful weight loss regimen is a good estimate of body composition as the starting point to calculate an appropriate food amount for weight loss. The newly developed method called the Body Fat Index (BFI) differentiates between levels of obesity and establishes a link between the BFI and an ideal body weight. Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) provides the most accurate way of measuring percent body fat; however, it is not readily available to the general practitioner. The current study compares percent body fat determined from the BFI chart and DEXA scan for a group of obese dogs during weight loss and weight maintenance fed a food formulated for helping dogs achieve a healthy weight containing 8.2 g protein, 3.4 g fat, 5.7 g insoluble fiber, 0.9 g soluble fiber, and 11 mg L-carnitine per 100 kilocalories. The protocol and procedures were approved by the institutional animal care and use committee. Thirteen obese dogs were fed for weight loss until they achieved their ideal body weight (IBW), followed by a 6-month weight maintenance phase. All dogs were group housed to allow for socialization and had access to outdoor runs. Three animal care technicians independently determined the BFI for each dog once per month; an average BFI was calculated. The BFI Chart included images and descriptors that were used to determine the dog's percent body fat. The dogs underwent a monthly DEXA scan during the weight loss phase and every two months during the weight maintenance phase.",

However, information is limited as to the clinicopathological changes that can be seen as a result of obesity and subsequent weight loss, as well as whether such changes could predict outcomes of a weight management regime. 100 client-owned dogs were included in this observational cohort study. Dogs underwent a controlled weight loss programme using a purpose-formulated diet. Routine haematology, serum biochemistry and urinalysis were performed before and after weight loss. Associations between clinicopathological findings and various outcomes were assessed. 69 of the dogs successfully reached their target weight (based on post-weight loss assessment by dual-energy X-ray absorptiometry), and 31 dogs stopped the programme prematurely, 8 of which were euthanased for an unrelated disease. In the dogs reaching target weight, leucocytes (P < 0.001), lymphocytes (P = 0.007), monocytes (P < 0.001), albumin (P < 0.001), ALP (P < 0.001), calcium (P < 0.001), creatinine (P = 0.039), cholesterol (P < 0.001), and total protein (P < 0.001) all decreased during the weight loss regime, whereas urea concentration increased (P = 0.039). Further, the magnitude of changes in cholesterol (Kendall's tau -0.23, P = 0.009), and albumin (Kendall's tau -0.31, P < 0.001) were negatively associated with percentage of weight lost (i.e. the more weight lost the greater the decrease).

Excessive body weight contributes to the severity of clinical signs in dogs with osteoarthritis. The purpose of this study was to determine the effectiveness of a new dietetic food (NDF)* to achieve weight loss and to improve mobility in obese/overweight client-owned dogs with osteoarthritis. The objectives were 1) to evaluate weight loss parameters and 2) to assess clinical signs related to osteoarthritis in dogs fed the NDF. Thirty-eight dogs were enrolled in the study. Initial and follow-up evaluations (monthly for 6 months) included determination of body weight, body condition score (BCS), body fat index (BFI), and evaluation of osteoarthritis-related parameters as assessed by the veterinarian (lameness, weight bearing, pain on joint palpation) and the owner (difficulty rising, aggression, reluctance to walk and to play, inactivity). Begging behaviour, faecal score and acceptance of food were also evaluated. Initial veterinary consultation consisted of physical examination, nutritional assessment, determination of ideal body weight (IBW), development of weight-loss feeding guidelines (DER = 70 x IBW kg 0.75 ), and explanation of the assessments performed. Statistical analysis comprised scatterplots, regression analysis, summary statistics, Friedman's chisquare test, and a mixed model ANOVA to assess changes over time (statistical significance P < 0.05). Eighty nine percent of the dogs lost weight (n = 34) with an average weight loss of 12.6% (SEM, 1.3%) over 6 months and an average weekly weight-loss rate of 0.5% (SEM, 0.04%) of starting body weight. The mean duration of weight loss was 174 days (SD, 36 days) with an average of 33 days (SD, 13 days) between rechecks. BCS and BFI in the dogs that lost weight were significantly lower compared with baseline in months 2-6 of the study. Difficulty rising and reluctance to play improved significantly compared with baseline starting at month 2 of the study whereas reluctance to walk and inactivity improved significantly compared with baseline starting at month 3 of the study. Similarly, lameness, weight bearing, and pain on palpation improved significantly compared with baseline starting in month 3 of the study. Faecal scores were unaffected and begging was significantly lower in months 3 and 4 compared with baseline. In conclusion, this clinical study confirmed the effectiveness of the NDF* in achieving weight loss and improvement of clinical signs related to osteoarthritis in overweight/obese client-owned dogs. Owners and veterinarians reported significant improvements in dog's weight and mobility without negative side effects.

Three large mixed-breed dogs (19%) were also diagnosed. Interestingly, males (n = 11, 69%) were more frequently diagnosed than females (n = 5, 31%). The most common clinicopathological findings were ulcerative or nodular cutaneous lesions, lymphadenomegaly, lameness, mild to moderate non-regenerative anemia, hypergammaglobulinemia, proteinuria and renal azotemia. Serology based on immunofluorescence or quantitative ELISA at the time of diagnosis was positive in all dogs with the exception of one dog, which was negative. Most dogs received a full vaccination protocol, although in some cases, vaccine was not administered in the same veterinary center where clinical leishmaniosis was diagnosed. Dogs were apparently healthy at the time of vaccination and most of them were considered seronegative based on a rapid serological test. Interestingly, the majority of dogs were diagnosed with clinical leishmaniosis prior to the first annual revaccination. The mean AE standard deviation of time between vaccination and appearance of clinical illness was 7 AE 3 months with a range of 2 and 12 months. In conclusion, this study describes, for the first time, clinicopathological data in dogs with leishmaniosis after vaccination. Moreover, the majority of dogs were diagnosed few months after vaccination highlighting the importance of the use of accurate screening diagnostic tests prior to vaccination in dogs living in endemic areas.",

The causative agent is tick-borne encephalitis virus (TBEV), a member of the genus Flavivirus. Since no anti-TBEV canine vaccine is available, seropositivity of dogs indicates natural exposures to Flavivirus. Dogs have served as sentinels in identifying the risk areas for humans of the natural Flavivirus foci and the seroprevalences in healthy dogs were shown to fluctuate from 0-30% depending on areas. Dogs may be resistant to developing clinical signs but clinical cases are often fatal. Our study had two aims: (i) assess the TBEV-seroprevalence in dogs showing neurological signs and its relationship with regard to gender, age and breed, (ii) evaluate the possible concordance of TBEV-seroprevalence and the specific areas suspected of Flavivirus foci in accordance with the RKI (Robert-Koch Institute, Berlin, Germany) classification of 'risk counties'. Between 2013 and 2015, we analysed 433 blood samples obtained from dogs with various unspecified neurological signs suspected of TBEV-infection. The majority of the samples came from Germany (299), Austria (54), Czech Republic (33), Sweden (15), Switzerland (12), and Norway (10). IgG-antibodies to TBEV were assayed using a commercially available ELISA. Based on the Antibody-titre results, dogs could be classified as follows: Ab-positive (>126 U/ml): 48/433 (11.1%), 'borderline range' (\u226563 \u2264 126 U/ml): 20/433 (4.6%), and Ab-negative (<63 U/ml): 365/433 (84.3%). By breed with \u226510 dogs, Ab-positive dogs were in the following decreasing order: Golden Retrievers, Labrador Retrievers, Yorkshire Terriers, Mongrels, and Bernese Mountain Dogs. No gender-dependency could be detected. The median age of the Ab-positive dogs was 6.5 (1-13) years. 28/299 (9.4%) dogs from Germany were Ab-positive and 27/28 (96.4%) came from risk areas (Bavaria, Baden-Wuerttemberg, Hesse, Thuringia, and Saarland). Dogs from other countries presented the following Abpositivity; Austria: 14/54 (26%), Czech Republic: 4/33 (12.1%), Norway: 1/10 (10%) and Switzerland: 0/12 (0%). Our present study showed that (i) Retrievers were the predominant breeds with respect to TBEV-seropositivity and (ii) a high concordance was confirmed between seropositive dogs with neurological signs and the TBEV-risk areas in Germany as defined by the classification of the RKI. Our data also suggested that, although seroprevalence could be low, TBE should be considered a potentially useful differential diagnosis in dogs with neurological signs when the dog has a history of travelling or living in risk areas and, in that case, the serological diagnosis should be confirmed by a paired sample, taken two weeks apart.",

ICG clearance determination has been used successfully to evaluate hepatic function in laboratory dogs. However, it has rarely been used in clinical setting as the analysis of the serum ICG concentration requires an advanced laboratory technique (high performance liquid chromatography). Our recent study in healthy Beagle dogs revealed a good correlation (r\u00b2 = 0.81) between ICG clearance and a transcutaneous method determining the ICG plasma disappearance rate (ICG-PDR in %/ min) with a near infrared spectroscopy probe placed on the tail (http://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S10900233150046 45). In human medicine, the main indication for measuring ICG-PDR has been the prognostic assessment of liver failure and liver transplantation.

ICG was given intravenously (0.5 mg/kg) and ICG-PDR was determined by using the PulsioFlex monitoring platform with the LiMon module probe (Pulsion, Munich, Germany). Daily ICG-PDR values from all dogs were compared and the coefficient of intrasubject variation (%CV) was calculated. Mean ICG-PDR was 7.8 AE 3.4%/min on day one, 8.8 AE 3.7%/min on day two, and 7.9 AE 2.6%/min on day three. There was no significant difference between the days and the mean ICG-PDR was similar to previously reported data (7.79 AE 3.3%/min). However, the mean %CV of ICG-PDR was very high (35.9 AE 16.8%) with the ighest individual %CV being 52.5%. In this limited number of animals, repeatability of transcutaneous ICG-PDR in its current form was rather poor. It seems unlikely that the test method will be useful for the repeated assessment of mild to moderate changes in canine liver function. However, future studies are warranted to assess the prognostic value of ICG-PDR for canine patients with severe acute or chronic end stage liver failure comparable to its current indication in human medicine.",

Two dogs and a cat had previously undergone partial shunt ligation with posterior recurrent hyperammonemia. Mean age at the time of diagnosis was nine months (range five to twelve months). French multipurpose catheters (3-5Fr) were inserted in the mesenteric vein or PV and advanced to the shunt site through a guidewire after transperitoneal approaches. Coil anchors were inserted in the SV of a dog [AK] and a cat [RB] previous to coil embolization procedure. PSS attenuation required deployment of additional coils due to persistent shunting flow in the dogs. The pushable coils were used to occlude PSS in the dogs because of low probability of coil migration, and the detachable microcoils were used to occlude the PSS in the cats due to the adaptability to irregular SVs and possibility of retrieve the device in case of instable coil deployment. PV pressures were measured to determine pre-and post-occlusion plausible changes. Preoperative serum ammonia ranged from 95 to 254 lmol/L and from 15 to 130 lmol/L in postoperative period. Serum liver enzymes remained elevated in the follow-up period in all patients. However, neurological and gastrointestinal abnormalities gradually improved in the short-term post-operative period. The residual PSS flow is expected to gradually cease due to blood clotting around the coils. Nevertheless, a long-term follow-up is recommended after PSS attenuation because of the risks involving coil dislocation and shunt recanalization.

Tricuspid annular systolic plane excursion (TAPSE) has been proposed as a measure of right ventricular (RV) systolic function. It is decreased below reference intervals in dogs with severe pulmonary hypertension. However, TAPSE, a linear measurement of tricuspid annular movement, scales non-linearly with bodyweight in dogs. We examined whether TAPSE could be normalized to linear aortic measurements to create a bodyweight-independent measure of RV systolic function. Echocardiographic evaluations were performed on 127 healthy dogs (50 dogs had been included in a previous study of TAPSE), 55 dogs with heart disease but no pulmonary hypertension (tricuspid regurgitant velocity <3 m/s) and 39 dogs with pulmonary hypertension of various etiologies and severities (tricuspid regurgitant velocity >2.9 m/s). TAPSE:Ao was regressed against bodyweight and, in dogs with pulmonary hypertension, against tricuspid velocity. TAPSE scaled non-linearly against bodyweight (as previously reported), but TAPSE:Ao largely removed the effect of bodyweight, with a non-parametrically determined lower reference limit of 0.67. Only 3/127 healthy dogs had TAPSE:Ao <0.7. Dogs with heart disease but no pulmonary hypertension showed a slight negative association of TAPSE:Ao with bodyweight with 4/55 dogs having TAPSE:Ao <0.7. In dogs with pulmonary hypertension TAPSE:Ao had a negative association with tricuspid velocity. However, only 5/39 dogs had TAPSE: Ao <0.7; all these dogs had TR velocities >4.4 m/s. TAPSE:Ao <0.7 was 97% specific, but only 38% sensitive in identifying dogs with severe pulmonary hypertension. TAPSE:Ao is a bodyweight independent measure of RV systolic function in dogs. Normal dogs have TAPSE:Ao >0.67. However, it does not appear to be a sensitive indicator of pulmonary hypertension.",

In healthy dogs reference values of ST-HRV were publish (Pol J Vet Sci. 2015, 18, 307-312) . The aim of the study was to compare normal value of short-term HRV in healthy dogs (H) (n = 50) and dogs with sick sinus syndrome (SSS) (n = 10). The ECG was recorded continuously for at least 180 min in dark and clam room. All QRS complexes from ECG were first edited automatically and then manually by careful inspection of the RR intervals. The data had no atrial or ventricular premature complexes. Signals were transformed into a spectrum by Fast Fourier Transformation. Heart rate variability parameters were measured at fixed time at the number of sample 60 min. Separate frequency (Hz) components of the HRV were obtained including very low frequency (VLF), low frequency (LF), high frequency (HF), total power (TP) and LF/ HF ratio. Research of new biomarkers to detect myocardial injury is crucial in medicine. Although whole blood and serum choline are suggested as emerging biomarkers in patients with myocardial ischemia, there is no available data on its usefulness for predicting cardiac events in dogs and cats. Thus, this study was aimed to evaluate the use of serum choline concentration as a potential biomarker for myocardial ischemia, and determine whether there was a correlation between cardiac troponin (cTnI) and serum choline in dogs and cats with heart diseases. Dogs with congestive heart failure (n = 10) and cats with either hypertrophic cardiomyopathy (n = 9) or dilated cardiomyopathy (n = 5) were used as cardiac group. Heart disease was diagnosed based on the clinical, radiologic, electrocardiographic (ECG) and echocardiographic findings. Myocardial injury was determined by elevation of serum cTnI level; dogs >0.07 ng/mL and cats >0.16 ng/mL. Healthy age-and breed-matched dogs (n = 10) and cats (n = 10) were used as controls. All dogs and cats selected for this study were sero-negative for common vector-borne pathogens and feline infectious diseases, respectively.

We hypothesized that RV outflow tract (RVOT) function might provide a simple, useful estimate of RV function and PAH. Specifically, we measured RVOT fractional shortening (RVOT-FS) to determine if this index helps identify RV dysfunction in dogs with PAH (tricuspid regurgitation velocity-TRV >3 m/sec). One hundred fifteen dogs [42 healthy dogs, 40 dogs with mitral valve disease (MVD) without PAH and 33 dogs with PAH] underwent complete echocardiographic evaluation. We acquired 2D guided M-mode recordings of the RV outflow tract from the parasternal short axis view at the level of the aortic root. We placed the M-mode line perpendicular to RVOT and parallel to the commissure of the aortic valve between the non-coronary and left-coronary cups.

The aim of this study was to evaluate the agreement between M-mode and two-dimensional (2D) echocardiography in the assessment of LA size in cats.",

Moreover, low levels of CoQ 10 have been found to be an independent predictor of mortality in chronic heart failure in human patients. The aim of our study was to investigate the survival of referred population of canine cardiovascular patients; with regard to the therapy (Yes/No) and plasma CoQ 10 concentration at the first visit. Seventy-two client-owned dogs were included in the present study, 29 of them were healthy controls.

Cardiovascular disease was confirmed on the basis of history, clinical examination, thoracic radiographs, electrocardiogram and echocardiography. The effect of therapy on survival was studied in advanced stages (class II and III). Plasma CoQ 10 was determined using HPLC-atmospheric pressure chemical ionization-tandem mass spectrometry method. Cardiac biomarker NT-proBNP (ELISA test) was analysed to screen the disease severity. A Kaplan-Meier analysis was used to estimate survival, but since the group that received cardiac therapy had significantly higher CoQ 10 concentrations than the patients without therapy, this variable was taken into account by using the Cox proportional hazards regression model. Results of the Kaplan-Meier analysis showed significantly longer survival in the group that already received therapy (P = 0.036). When analysing with Cox model, the hazard ratio of patients with therapy was 0.40 (95% CI 0.17-0.96; P = 0.039), indicating also a better survival as compared with group without therapy.

It has been reported that cytokines contribute to the pathogenesis of congestive heart failure (CHF) in human and canine cardiovascular patients. Human studies revealed increased circulating levels of interleukin-6 (IL-6) and tumour necrosis factor-alpha (TNFalpha) in heart failure patients. Additionally, increased C-reactive protein (CRP) concentration has been found in humans and dogs in congestive heart failure. The aim of the study was to investigate whether the levels of circulating cytokines (TNF-alpha, IL-6 and CRP) are elevated in dogs with various heart diseases and heart failure. Additionally, the effect of therapy on measured parameters was evaluated in advanced stages of the disease (International Small Animal Cardiac Health Council (ISACHC) II and III). Cardiac biomarker NT-proBNP was analysed to screen the disease severity. Fifty-eight client-owned dogs were enrolled in this study: 48 dogs with confirmed cardiovascular disease and 10 healthy dogs. Cardiovascular patients were classified into ISACHC classes. Cardiovascular disease was confirmed on the basis of history, clinical examination, thoracic radiographs, electrocardiogram and echocardiography. Patients with other diseases were excluded from the study. Serum concentrations of inflammatory markers were determined with ELISA kits. Plasma NT-proBNP (second-generation Cardiopet\u00d2 proBNP) levels were analysed by IDEXX Laboratory. Kruskal-Wallis analysis followed by the Mann-Whitney U test with Bonferroni adjustment (P < 0.008) was used for comparison of measured parameters among groups of patients and healthy dogs. The effect of therapy was tested with Mann-Whitney U test. Interleukin-6 and TNF-alpha concentrations did not differ significantly among ISACHC groups and between control group and ISACHC groups. The highest TNF-alpha concentration was found in ISACHC III (median 7.956 pg/mL versus 3.900 pg/mL in ISACHC II and I). CRP concentration was significantly higher in ISACHC III (3.53 mg/L) and ISACHC II (4.401 mg/L) than in control group (0.900 mg/L); however no significant differences in CRP concentrations were found among ISACHC groups. The results showed no significant differences in any of measured parameters between patients with and withouth therapy. A positive significant correlation was found between NT-proBNP and IL-6 in ISACHC II; correlations with TNF-alpha and CRP were not significant in neither group of patients. Increased CRP concentrations in advanced stages of heart failure and significant positive correlation between IL-6 and NT-proBNP indicate systemic inflammation in dogs with CHF. Therapy had no effect on measured inflammatory markers. Futher studies in larger groups of canine cardiovascular patients might confirm that cytokines are responsible for the progression of heart failure. Disclosures: No disclosures to report.

B-type natriuretic peptide (BNP) is an endogenous \"cardioprotective\"natriuretic, vasodilatory, and diuretic peptide that mediates its actions through cyclic GMP (cGMP). BNP is produced by myocardiocytes in response to stress but is overwhelmed by other neurohormonal systems during heart failure. In humans with acute congestive heart failure, exogenous intravenous BNP helps alleviate signs of dyspnea. In addition, BNP has longer-term anti-remodeling properties, and developing methods to chronically administer BNP to humans and dogs with heart disease is a subject of interest. Administration of exogenous BNP has not been previously reported in privately-owned dogs. We sought to determine the feasibility, safety, and tolerance of subcutaneous synthetic canine B-type natriuretic peptide (syncBNP) (Phoenix Pharmaceuticals, Burlingame, CA) by performing a modified 3 9 3 phase-1 intra-patient dose escalation study in 6 dogs, including 2 healthy dogs and 4 dogs with stage B1 myxomatous mitral valve disease (MMVD). Stage 1 involved administering a \"subtherapeutic\"dose of 2.5 mcg/kg syncBNP to 3 dogs followed by a second \"therapeutic\"dose of 5.0 mcg/kg 4 hours later. Stage 2 administered a baseline dose of 5.0 mcg/kg followed by a \"maximum\"dose of 10.0 mcg/kg 4 hours later in an additional 3 dogs. syncBNP injections were well-tolerated in all dogs at all concentrations with no statistically significant differences in blood pressure, heart rate and rhythm, or serum creatnine and BUN before and after syncBNP administration.

Its prevalence increases with severity of DMVD and its presence is a predictor of worse outcome. Left atrial (LA) function and size are prognostic indicators in DMVD. In dogs, LA contractile function has been shown to decrease with severity of DMVD. In human with chronic mitral regurgitation, LA function is an important correlate of right ventricular systolic pressure. The aim of this study was to assess if LA dysfunction was associated with PH in dogs with DMVD. Dogs with DMVD and a measurable tricuspid regurgitation (TR) were retrospectively recruited. Maximal LA diameter, LA diameter at the onset of the P wave and minimal LA diameter were measured on anatomic M-mode from 2D cineloops on aortic short axis view. Left atrial reservoir (LA expansion index; Total LA shortening fraction), conduit (Passive LA shortening fraction) and contractile function (Active LA shortening fraction) indices were derived from above measures. Ninety three dogs including ACVIM stage B1 (22), B2 (28), C (39) and D (4), were included. Dogs were assigned to pulmonary hypertensive group (PH) (TR pressure gradient >40 mmHg) (n = 29, median: 51 mmHg; range: 40-114) or pulmonary normotensive group (PN) (n = 64, 29 mmHg; 5-40). LA reservoir and contractile function indices were reduced in ACVIM stage C and D compared to asymptomatic stages (P < 0.001) and TR pressure gradient was higher in symptomatic dogs (P < 0.05) compared to asymptomatic dogs. TR gradient was positively correlated with LA size measured at different time intervals (P < 0.001) and negatively correlated with LA reservoir (P = 0.02) and contractile (P = 0.009) variables LA reservoir variables (P = 0.008), and active LA shortening fraction (P = 0.006) were lower in PH group compared to PN ANCOVA was used to test the categorical effect of ACVIM stages along with the effects of LA function indices on TR pressure gradient. ACVIM stage had a strong effect on TR gradient (P < 0.001) but LA function parameters did not persist after correction for ACVIM stages. This study confirmed that, in dogs with DMVD, PH is strongly associated with the stage of heart failure but failed to show an independent relationship between LA dysfunction and development of PH. The reason may be a lack of accuracy of one dimensional variables to assess LA phasic function or the absence of causal link between LA dysfunction and development of pulmonary hypertension in DMVD dogs. Disclosures: No disclosures to report. Mineralisation of the heart and great vessels has been reported as an incidental radiographic finding in dogs. The prevalence has been reported at 0.61% on thoracic radiography. Thoracic computed tomography (CT) imaging is being used more frequently in dogs in recent years, but the CT prevalence of mineralisation is unreported. It may be higher because of the increased sensitivity of CT compared with radiography. The aim of the study was therefore to describe the prevalence and location of cardiac and great vessel mineralisation in dogs and to evaluate its association with age, sex and concurrent disease. Thoracic CT studies of 878 dogs carried out between 2011-2014 at a veterinary teaching hospital were reviewed. Poor quality CTs were excluded, resulting in 802 dogs available for inclusion. A single, trained operator systematically reviewed all CT studies and a panel of three Board-certified Cardiologists and one Board-certified Diagnostic Imager reviewed all abnormalities. The cases were grouped by: sex (male/female); age (1-5 years, \u22655 to 10 years, and >10 years), and concurrent disease process: neoplasia, cardiorespiratory, neurological, internal medicine, surgical (soft tissue and orthopaedics), and miscellaneous.",

Left atrial size is a clinically important parameter, that reflects the severity of chronic cardiac disorders; such as myxomatous valve degeneration, which is the most common cardiac disease in dogs. First opinion veterinary practices lack an easy and standardized method to assess left atrial size reliably. Though two-dimensional echocardiography would be an excellent modality for this purpose, performing cardiac ultrasonography requires advanced training and quite some experience. Furthermore, ultrasonography is less widely available than radiography. Though vertebral heart scale (VHS) is a simple quantitative method to assess the cardiac size on thoracic radiographs, VHS says nothing specific about the size of the left atrium. We describe a new standardized method for estimating left atrial size on lateral thoracic radiographs in dogs. The principle of this method is to draw a straight line between the dorsal border of the tracheal bifurcation and the point where the ventral border of the caudal vena cava crosses the cranial crus of the diaphragm. These anatomic landmarks are easy to recognize and are similar to those used for determining the VHS. We hypothesized that if the cardiac silhouette exceeds this line dorsally, the left atrium is enlarged, if not then it is normal.",

The aim of this retrospective study was to evaluate the effectiveness of a feed supplement containing a mix of substances to bind the phosphate and correct the metabolic acidosis in cats with CKD (IRIS, International Renal Interest Society, stage 3 and 4). 10 cats (median BW 4 (3;6) Kg, BCS 3/5 (2;4), 11 (9;12) years) fed with a balanced renal diet were involved in the retrospective analysis. Treatment consisted in oral administration of the product (Renal, Candioli Pharma) containing calcium carbonate, calcium lactate gluconate, sodium bicarbonate and chitosan given for 60 days. The animals were evaluated at the beginning of the study and at 15, 30, 60 days (T0, T15, T30, T60) for: BW, BCS, food intake, blood pressure and for routinely hematochemical, biochemical and urinary parameters. All statistical analyses were performed using SAS software. After checking normality data were analyzed using Kruskal-Wallis and Wilcoxon tests. Results are expressed as median (interquartile range). Letters show differences among rows (P < 0.05). Statistically significant reduction of serum phosphorus concentration was obtained through the study (reduction of 59% at T60 versus T0). Also a statistically significant increase of bicarbonate was seen (7% from T0 to T60). At T60 was also recorded an increase of ionized calcium level, which however was in normal range. It was also detected a statistically significant difference for the albumin/globulin ratio between day 15 and day 60.",

The risk of functional impairment of the kidney, CKD and AKI, is a common problem in cancer due to infiltration or nephrotoxic chemotherapeutics. While about 40% of human lymphoma patients are known to have compromised kidney function, only 20% of the affected patients are diagnosed by creatinine while the remaining 80% require biopsies for diagnostic accuracy. A study of 5000 human patients with a variety of solid tumors demonstrated that the prevalence of reduced GFR was about 52% and 12% had advanced CKD (stages 3-5). Given the increased incidence of cancer; new therapies are being developed at a frenetic pace leading to an increased need to identify kidney disease early and highlighting the demand for more effective and sensitive biomarkers. At this time such detailed information is nonexistent for veterinary patients, however there is no reason to think that it is any different. Methylation of arginine is a signaling process with asymmetric methylation activating transcription and expression while symmetric methylation is a repressive signal. It's important to understand if increased protein turnover in malignancies will lead to increased production of dimethylarginines. In a human study that included different types of cancer, ADMA but not SDMA, was shown to have significantly increased in the cancer cohort compared to controls. The observed increase in SDMA is likely due to impaired kidneys and not cancer related increased production of SDMA; while the increase in ADMA is likely due to increased protein turnover as a result of transcriptional activation.",

The authors all work for IDEXX, which runs a laboratory service that performs an assay that is discussed in the abstract. Upper and lower urinary tract disorders of small animals are commonly seen in our country. When 2/3 of the kidneys become dysfunctional, clinical signs are apparently present in the patient. In this study, enzymuria and microalbuminuria were evaluated in eighty dogs with the lower urinary tract symptoms (pollakiuria, dysuria-stranguria, hematuria, urinary incontinence, polyuria, polydipsia, excessive licking of the urogenital area) that were referred to Istanbul University, Veterinary Teaching and Research Hospital, Internal Medicine Clinics. Blood and urine samples were collected aseptically from each dog. The specific parameters that were detected in the study were; urine microalbumin concentration (Heska \u00d2 E.R.D.-HealthScreen Canine Urine Test), urine protein creatinine ratio (UPC), urine culture and enzymes (urine N-acetylbeta-D-glucosaminidase (NAG), Alkaline phosphatese (ALP), Gamma Glutamyl Transferase (GGT), Lactate Dehydrogenase (LDH), Alanin Aminopeptidase (AAP) ). The blood pressure was measured with high definition oscillometric device (Memodiagnostic \u00d2 ). Statistical analysis \"General Linear Model\"was based on gender, age, nutrition, microalbuminuria and urinary tract disorders of the dogs. With the comparison of urine dipstick, urine protein-creatinine ratio and microalbuminuria test results, it was agreed that microalbuminuria test was the most trustable and the practical method in small animal practice. It was also determined that microalbuminuria levels could be affected from the many factors like age and nutrition. Except microalbuminuria, the enzymes especially NAG and AAP were markedly elevated in dogs with lower urinary tract disorders. Thus, it was approved that parameters that were controlled in this study, can be easily used in SDMA is a biomarker for AKI in human medicine. The aim of this study was to investigate SDMA in dogs with AKI and to assess if SDMA discriminates AKI from CKD. Blood samples stored for a previous study to investigate renal biomarkers in dogs with AKI or CKD were analyzed for SDMA. Over a period of 1 year SDMA was measured in all dogs with renal azotemia (48 AKI, 29 CKD) and 18 healthy control dogs and SDMA/creatinine ratio was calculated.",

Similarly to urinary protein measurement, spot urine albumin concentration is usually normalized to the urinary creatinine values. The upper normal value of spot urinary albumin concentration has not been determined in dogs, thus laboratories often use the human reference value: 0.03 (mg urinary albumin/mg urinary creatinine). Some authors also quote the human reference value of 10 mg/l urinary albumin concentration as the upper normal level of albuminuria for healthy dogs. Whether this value is obtained with or without normalizing the urine concentration to 1010 specific gravity is not always clear from the description of the methods.

No form of direct financial support was given to the first author or his clinic for the work done on this research study.

The third author is an employee of Idexx Laboratories, Inc, the company that makes the in-clinic test TT4 test evaluated in this study. None of the data analysis were performed by this individual, however, and the results were not modified in any way for the company's benefit (this arrangement was made prior to initiation of the study). The ACTH stimulation test (ACTHST) is commonly used to screen dogs for spontaneous hyperadrenocorticism (HAC). This study aimed to evaluate the contribution of baseline cortisol in the interpretation of ACTHST. The study included samples from 73 dogs, submitted to a referral laboratory for evaluation of HAC by ACTHST, and completed questionnaires about the referring veterinarians' (rDVMs) interpretation of the results. rDVMs reported whether the test results were considered confirmatory for HAC, how baseline and post-stimulation cortisol were interpreted, and their final decision whether the dog had HAC. Most rDVMs (77%) considered both baseline (B) and post-stimulation (P) cortisol in their interpretation, either their difference (P-B) or their ratio (P/B). Receiver operator characteristics (ROC) analyses were used to assess the predictive accuracy of baseline cortisol alone, post-stimulation cortisol alone, P-B and P/B. The areas under the ROC curve (AUC) for baseline cortisol, P/B, P-B, and post-stimulation cortisol were 0.61, 0.62, 0.84 and 0.89, respectively, when the outcome was a confirmatory result, and 0.63, 0.58, 0.77 and 0.85, respectively, when the outcome was a final diagnosis of HAC. Post-stimulation cortisol AUCs were significantly higher than all other AUCs, excluding P-B AUC, for predicting a confirmatory result of HAC. In conclusion, post-stimulation cortisol demonstrated good discriminatory ability for the interpretation of the ACTHST, and for the final diagnosis made by rDVMs. It was either superior or comparable to P-B while baseline cortisol and P/ B were ineffective. Baseline cortisol has no additive value in interpreting ACTHST results and diagnosing HAC by rDVMs.",

Sixty-six cats were retrospectively included, based on a diagnosis of hyperthyroidism (clinical signs and free thyroxinemia \"fT4\" >40 pmol/L).

The main clinical signs at diagnosis were weight loss (94%), polyuropolydipsia (74%), polyphagia (67%), tachycardia (56%), digestive signs (54%) and palpable thyroid nodule (31%). The main biological signs were high fT4 (median: 68 pmol/L, range [40;100]), uremia >3.6 mmol/L for 46% of the cats, creatininemia >159 lmol/L for 11% and ALT >80 U/L for 62%. 54.3% of the cats received dry y/d, 5.7% the canned form and 40.0% both.

The glucocorticoid dexamethasone is most commonly used for emergency parenteral treatment in a crisis but this drug has negligible mineralocorticoid activity. The use of hydrocortisone sodium succinate (HSS) is described in human medicine. Besides its glucocorticoid activity, it has potent mineralocorticoid activity potentially making it superior to dexamethasone for treatment of Addisonian crisis. Our aims were to describe treatment of Addisonian crisis using HSS in a cohort of dogs. Furthermore, we compared this therapy to dogs treated with dexamethasone over the same period. Records from a single referral hospital were searched between 2007 and 2015, identifying 15 dogs diagnosed with an Addisonian crisis (serum cortisol concentration <55 nmol/L after administration of tetracosactrin, requiring hospitalization for emergency stabilisation). Dogs were excluded if they had already received any glucocorticoid and/or mineralocorticoid therapy prior to admission, or had incomplete data concerning treatment, laboratory tests or outcomes. Seven dogs were treated with HSS continuous rate infusions ranging from 0.3 to 0.625 mg/kg/h (Group A). Eight dogs were treated with intravenous dexamethasone doses ranging from 0.05 to 0.3 mg/kg (group B). None of the dogs in group A required treatment with dexamethasone and none of the dogs in group B received HSS at any stage during treatment. Both HSS and dexamethasone were associated with adequate management of the acute adrenocortical insufficiency in every case with all patients surviving to discharge. No significant differences were found between the two groups regarding age, weight, gender, admission Na+ and K+ concentrations, length and median cost of hospitalisation, median time for K+ concentration to normalise, time to spontaneously eat or amount of crystalloid and colloid fluids used.",

Nova Scotia Duck Tolling Retriever (NSDTR) dogs are predisposed to immune-mediated disorders and particularly to a disorder characterized by chronic stiffness and pain from multiple joints, indicative of non-erosive polyarthritis. Dogs affected by this disorder, called immune-mediated rheumatic disease (IMRD), commonly display antinuclear antibodies (ANA) on indirect immunofluorescence (IIF). Non-erosive polyarthritis and ANA are commonly present in systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) and in other systemic rheumatic diseases, in humans as well as in dogs. IMRD may be described as an SLE-related disease. Diagnosis and monitoring of IMRD are primarily based on clinical signs and presence of ANA, and an objective, quick and cost-effective test would be highly valuable. The acute phase protein C-reactive protein (CRP) is used for diagnosing and monitoring systemic inflammation in both humans and dogs. It is considered to be a quantitative marker of inflammation in most diseases, but in human SLE, CRP concentrations are mildly to moderately increased and not correlated to the degree of inflammation. The aim of the study was to investigate CRP concentrations in NSDTRs with IMRD. The hypothesis was that CRP concentrations would be mildly to moderately increased in IMRD compared to healthy dogs, similar to what has been reported in humans with SLE. Serum CRP concentrations were measured in 18 IMRD affected NSDTRs (9 IIF-ANA positive and 9 IIF-ANA negative) and 19 healthy control NSDTRs using two canine-specific immunoturbidimetric assays (Gentian cCRP assay and high-sensitivity CRP assay, Gentian AS, Moss, Norway). None of the dogs were treated with anti-inflammatory medication at the time of sampling. Dogs with IMRD had higher CRP concentrations compared to control dogs (Welch two sample t-test with log-transformation of data, P = 0.003) but no difference was observed between the groups of IMRD dogs with and without positive IIF-ANA, respectively (P = 0.6). The median CRP concentration was 10.3 mg/L in the IMRD dogs and 2.1 mg/L in the control dogs. The CRP concentration was low to moderately increased in a majority of IMRD dogs, as is seen in humans with SLE. The CRP concentration was lower than observed in, for example, studies of immune-mediated polyarthritis in other dog breeds but higher than in canine osteoarthritis, two disorders that can resemble IMRD. The potential clinical value of CRP in dogs with IMRD warrants further investigations.

The aims of this study were to noninvasively quantify tidal breathing status in cats present with respiratory distress, and to compare the difference in ventilatory function between cats with respiratory distress and healthy cats. We hypothesized that ventilatory parameters such as respiratory rate and volumes will be elevated in cats experiencing significant labored breathing because of respiratory diseases and increase in ventilatory demand. Twelve cats present in NTUVH with persistently increased respiratory effort due to various etiologies (lung parenchymal disease, pleural space disease, upper airway obstruction, or lower airway disease) were enrolled in the study, and the informed consents were obtained from the owners. The cat was placed in a transparent Plexiglas chamber of the barometric whole body plethysmography (BWBP) system without restraint for recording tidal breathing signals, and the breathing status of the cat could be observed easily by the clinicians at the same time without causing disturbance or stress to the cat. Compared with 14 cats without respiratory signs or historic respiratory diseases, cats in respiratory distress had significantly higher minute volume/ body weight (MV/BW) (531.6 versus 234.5 mL/kg; P < 0.001), tidal volume/BW (TV/BW) (7.55 versus 5.46 mL/kg; P = 0.026), peak inspiratory flow/BW (PIF/BW) (29.2 versus 13.8 mL/s/kg; P < 0.001), peak expiratory flow/BW (PEF/BW) (35.2 versus 12.9 mL/s/kg; P < 0.001), enhanced pause (1.60 versus 1.00; P = 0.003), and significantly lower relaxation time (0.17 versus 0.36 s; P = 0.010). Among cats with respiratory distress, 5 cats that eventually died with respiratory failure had statistically higher MV/BW than 5 cats that survived and became stable over at least 3 months (639.0 versus 390.1; mL/kg) (P = 0.028). Interestingly, respiratory rate was neither significantly different between cats in respiratory distress and control cats, nor between cats that died and cats that survived. In conclusion, ventilatory function could be non-invasively and non-harmfully assessed in cats with respiratory distress by BWBP method. Elevation of MV/BW under natural breathing implies the increase in ventilatory demand and might be a poor prognostic indicator or severity index in cats with labored breathing. Furthermore, respiratory rate might not be reliable for identifying increased respiratory effort or disease severity. Care should be taken when the assessment relies on respiratory rate alone.

Some of these diseases are fatal in cats when corticosteroids are not effective controlling immune responses, requiring alternative immune-suppressive therapies. Mycophenolate mofetil may be an alternate immunosuppressant that should be considered for use in cats because of its documented efficacy in controlling autoimmune diseases in humans and dogs. Mycophenolate mofetil is the pro-drug of the active compound mycophenolic acid (MPA). It is a selective non-competitive inhibitor of inosine-5'-monophosphate dehydrogenase, which is expressed in many cells. MPA induces lymphocyte cytotoxicity, reduces monocyte recruitment, and suppresses dendritic cell maturation, making it useful in treating immune mediated and inflammatory diseases. Diarrhea is a side effect of MPA in humans and dogs, and occurs in up to 20% of patients. This side effect has not been observed in cats. We proposed that MPA could be used successfully in cats with minimal side effects after multi-day intravenous dosing. Five clinically healthy adult cats were voluntarily enrolled. Baseline laboratory testing was performed in all cats prior to the start of the study to rule out systemic disease. All cats were administered 10 mg/kg of mycophenolate mofetil (CellCept\u00d2) intravenously over 2 hours BID for 3 days. The cats' body weights, appetite, attitude, and stools were monitored pre (7 days), during (3 days) and post (7 days) infusions. All participant cats maintained their body weights throughout the study. Attitudes remained bright and alert and no cats showed any gastrointestinal side effects (normal appetites, no vomiting, and formed stool).

Canine idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (CIPF) is a progressive interstitial lung disease mainly affecting old West Highland white terriers (WHWTs). CIPF shares several clinical and pathological features with human IPF. An imbalance between thrombosis and fibrinolysis has been demonstrated in human IPF patients favouring a local and systemic prothrombotic state which correlates with disease severity and outcome. The aim of the present study was to investigate the coagulation and fibrinolysis systems in CIPF. For this purpose, coagulation profile and thromboelastography data were collected and compared between WHWTs affected with CIPF and unaffected WHWTs (CTRL). Coagulation times (PT, aPTT), plasmatic concentrations of fibrinogen, D dimers, antithrombin III, Protein S and Protein C activities, anti-factor Xa activity (FXa), and activated Protein C ratio (APCR) were retrospectively measured using the STA Compact automated coagulation analyzer from previously stored (\u00c080\u00b0C) plasma samples obtained from 20 CTRL and 14 CIPF WHWTs. Point-of-care rotational thromboelastometer (ROTEM) was employed to prospectively measure clotting-time, aangle, amplitude at 10/20/30 min, maximal clot firmness, lysis after 30/60 min, and maximum lysis on whole-citrated blood sampled from 15 CTRL and 9 CIPF WHWTs. Satistical analyses were perfomed with a commercially available software using Student-t test or Mann-Withney test for continuous variables, and Fisher's exact test for categorical variables. Statistical significance was set at P \u2264 0.05. Compared with CTRL, WHWTs affected with CIPF demonstrated a longer aPTT (mean AE SD) (12.2 AE 0.9 sec versus 11.5 AE 0.7, P = 0.028), whereas results obtained in both groups were all within reference ranges. A trend for an increased fibrinogen concentration (4.1 AE 1.8 g/L versus 3.1 AE 1.1, P = 0.067) and for a decreased APCR (median, range) (25.6, 21.9-27.7 versus 26.8, 23.8-64.4) in WHWTs affected with CIPF was observed, while there was no siginificant difference between groups for the other factors assessed. FXa was found above the upper limit of the reference range in 3 WHWTs affected with CIPF, but in none of the controls (P = 0.075). ROTEM results demonstrated no significant difference between groups for any of the parameters studied. Results of the present study provide no clear evidence for a hypercoagulable state in WHWTs affected with CIPF. High fibrinogen concentrations found in CIPF WHWTs tend to suggest a proinflammatory state which may be a risk factor for thrombosis, but this finding should be confirmed by further investigation in larger cohorts of dogs.

ECT was accomplished by using the electroporator LC \u00d2 BK-100 model in association with intravenous bleomycin (15 UI/m\u00b2) plus doxorubicin (30 mg/m\u00b2) protocol. Tumor volume was calculated according to formula: length (cm) 9 width (cm) 9 height (cm) 9 3.14/6. The mitotic index was determined by the number of mitotic figures in ten selected 40 9 high-power fields. Microscopic necrosis was classified as \"absent\", grade I (less than 50%) or grade II (over 50%), as previously described. After testing for normality, the paired t-test or the Mann-Whitney test was applied to make the comparisons. The most common site of tumors was the abdomen (n = 10) and thorax (n = 3). One tumor occurred on the prepuce, and one was located on pelvic limb. After treatment, thirteen tumors presented clinical remission. One tumor progressed, and one remained stable in size. The mean of tumor volume in D0 (26.66 AE 36.98) was higher than in D21 (18.07 AE 33.06) (P = 0.0134). The mitotic index decreased in twelve lesions and increased in other three lesions. The mean of mitotic index in D0 (9 AE 6.8) did not significantly differ from D21 (7.42 AE 5.23) (P > 0.05). Before treatment, necrosis was classified as grade I in ten lesions and as grade II in four lesions. Necrosis was absent in one tumor. After ECT, the grade of necrosis did not change in most tumors (n = 12). One lesion decreased necrosis grade from II to I while other lesion decreased from I to \"absent\". One tumor that presented absence of necrosis in D0 was classified as grade I in D21. There was no significant difference between D0 and D21 for necrosis (P > 0.05). Although substantial tumor remissions, ECT does not significantly decreases mitotic index in SCC in dogs. Moreover, ECT does not influence the intensity of microscopic necrosis after 21 days from this procedure.

Specifically, the multi-modal effects of polyphenols and carotenoids have been established in human cell lines and rodent models, with limited work in canine cells. We have previously identified two natural ingredients, turmeric extract (TE) and rosemary extract (RE), which worked synergistically to reduce neoplastic cell growth, and had no cytotoxic effect on normal dermal fibroblasts. This combination had an additive or synergistic effect when used with the chemotherapeutic agents toceranib or doxorubicin hydrochloride. The purpose of this in-vitro study was to examine mechanisms of action of this cocktail. Three canine neoplastic cell lines representing a variety of tumors were used: C2 (mastocytoma), CMT-12 (mammary gland carcinoma), and D17 (osteosarcoma). Apoptosis was determined using Annexin V staining and by a commercially available caspase-3/7 cleavage assay. Cell cycle changes using propidium iodide staining, generation of reactive oxygen species using Dihydrorhodamine123, modulation of cellular efflux pumps, and cellular accumulation of curcumin were analyzed by flow cytometry. Perturbation of various cell signaling pathways was assessed after 12 and 24 hours of incubation by western blotting. Cells were treated with 6.3 \u03bcg/mL of extract individually, a combination (3.1 \u03bcg/mL of each extract), or vehicle control. Comparisions between these four treatment groups were analyzed using a one-way ANOVA followed by Tukey's post-hoc analyses. The combination treatment induced apoptosis in all cell lines, beyond the effects of TE alone, after 36 hours of incubation. Both extracts had a significant antioxidant effect (P < 0.05). CMT-12 cells were the most susceptible to treatment (40% Annexin V positive; 5-fold increase in caspase cleavage). The presence of RE significantly increased the cellular accumulation of TE as indicated by an increase in fluorescence, with the CMT-12 cell line showing the greatest accumulation. Western blotting showed an increase in the amount of activated c-jun N-terminal kinase (JNK), although the differences varied across cell lines. TE and RE interact synergistically to induce apoptosis in-vitro; mechanisms may include RE increasing cellular accumulation of TE and activation of JNK.",

However, clinical veterinarians recognize that BCS assessment has an error to some extent. This is because that BCS is an assessment of the subjective method based on ocular inspection and the palpation. Therefore we built a BCS model for the BCS assessment in dogs and examined its accuracy. We reported that variability of BCS value was less when the BCS model was used in nutritional assessment of the dog [1]. In this study, a survey was conducted to make clear usefulness of the BCS model in clinical veterinarians and dog owners. The BCS model was developed with resin molded artificial ribs. Polychloroprene sponge sheet and natural rubber sheet were laminated to fit the palpation feeling of each BCS. A survey was carried out for both clinical veterinarians (n = 23) and dog owners (n = 46). The main questions were as follows: actual use of BCS in clinic, perception of using the BCS model and application of the BCS model in the clinic for clinical veterinarians, and awareness of the BCS and BCS assessment of own dog for dog owners.",

Many pet owners struggle with reducing their cat's body weight. A critical component of a successful weight loss regimen is a good estimate of body composition as the starting point to calculate an appropriate food amount for weight loss. The newly developed method called the Body Fat Index (BFI) differentiates between levels of obesity and establishes a link between the BFI and an ideal body weight. Dual-Energy X-ray Absorptiometry (DEXA) provides the most accurate way of measuring percent body fat; however, it is not readily available to the general practitioner. The current study compares percent body fat determined from the BFI chart and DEXA scan for a group of obese cats during weight loss and weight maintenance fed a food specifically formulated for helping cats achieve a healthy weight containing 11 g protein, 3.5 g fat, 3.6 g insoluble fiber, 0.6 g soluble fiber, and 14.9 mg L-carnitine per 100 kilocalories.

The study received approval from an ethical review committee. Plasma f[Mg ++ ] was measured in 152 dogs, with serum t[Mg ++ ] measured in 33. There was significant correlation between f[Mg ++ ] and t[Mg ++ ] (Spearman's rho 0.491, P < 0.001). The APPLE-fast score was significantly associated with survival to discharge (odds ratio 1.101, 95% confidence interval 1.030-1.178, P = 0.005), but f [Mg ++ ] was not associated with survival when entered into this model (P = 0.440). Inclusion of f[Mg ++ ] resulted in similar model parameters (classification 68.4%, H-M 0.195, AUROC 0.705), compared to the model containing only the APPLE-fast score (classification 70.4%, H-M 0.103, AUROC 0.693). Plasma f[Mg ++ ] was easily measured in dogs and correlated well with serum t[Mg ++ ]. Measurement of f[Mg ++ ] did not improve the ability to predict outcome in dogs in an emergency setting when considered alongside the APPLE-fast score.

The increased PTH (and calcitriol) concentrations are appropriate compensatory responses to hypocalcaemia, which could contribute to renal injury in hyperthyroidism. Calcitonin inhibits osteoclastic bone resorption, decreases renal calcium reabsorption and decreases intestinal calcium absorption, therefore elevated plasma calcitonin concentrations could explain the observed relative hypocalcaemia in hyperthyroid cats. Previous studies have suggested that serum calcitonin concentrations are often undetectable in healthy adult and hypercalcaemic cats, whereas serum calcitonin concentrations are elevated in human Graves' disease patients. This study aimed to evaluate plasma calcitonin concentrations in hyperthyroid cats and identify if an association with iCa exists.",

This group has recently published a retrospective study in dogs with CE and hypocobalaminemia, in which oral cbl supplementation appeared effective. However, intracellular markers of cbl status, such as methylmalonic acid (MMA) concentrations, were not evaluated. The purpose of this study was to compare MMA concentrations after oral (PO) versus parenteral (PE) cbl supplementation in dogs with signs of CE and hypocobalaminemia.",

Disadvantages of using a sequencing based approach are the relatively high cost, as well the turnaround time to receive sequencing results. Recently we developed a PCR panel that targets specific bacterial groups that have been found to be consistently altered in dogs with CE. The results of the PCR panel are expressed using a mathematical algorithm that reports microbiota changes as a single numerical value (dysbiosis index). A negative DI indicates normobiosis, whereas a DI > 2 indicates dysbiosis. A DI between 0 and 2 is in the questionable range. The aim of this study was to analytically validate the DI index and also to assess the influence of storage temperatures.",

It is usually associated with mucosally invasive E.coli that are able to persist in macrophages. Eradication of invasive E.coli correlates with remission of clinical signs and histopathological abnormalities. Genetic analysis of affected dogs has implicated a region on chromosome 38 that is involved sensing and killing of E.coli in other species. Thus it is emerging that E.coli associated GC in Boxers and French bulldogs is likely a heritable genetic defect sensing or killing of intracellular E.coli. E.coli associated Granulomatous colitis has not been documented in cats.",

Necropsic studies suggest a high prevalence of feline CP and histological examination is the gold standard for diagnosis but focal inflammatory lesions can be missed on biopsies. Measurement of specific feline pancreatic lipase (f-PL) and abdominal ultrasonography improved the diagnosis of moderate to severe pancreatitis in cats.

Previous studies have shown breed predisposition for Tervuren, Bouvier des Flandres, Groenendael, Collie, Poodle and Norwegian Elkhound. This study aimed at investigating which pure breeds are most commonly subject to gastroduodenoscopy (GDS) in a referral hospital, and their probability to be diagnosed with gastric neoplasia or metaplasia. For the retrospective analysis, a computerized database search was performed for dogs meeting the following inclusion criteria: subject to GDS; belonging to a pure breed with a minimum of five GDS patients in the records.Between 2006 When a log-binomial model was used, also the risk ratio for neoplasia was significantly higher in Tervuren (RR = 29; 7.68-109.54).The low prevalence of cancer in this study is in accordance with previous studies using cancer and pathology registers. Except for the Collies, breeds predisposed for gastric cancer were not more often subject to GDS than others. Like in previous studies, Tervuren undergoing GDS were found at much higher risk to have gastric carcinoma. The high OR for Wire-haired Dachshund and Collies to undergo GDS might indicate a higher prevalence of gastrointestinal disorders beside neoplasia, warranting further studies. Gastric metaplasia was as rare as gastric cancer and no breed predisposition was found. Nonetheless, metaplasia can present as discrete, flat changes that are easily overlooked and possibly underdiagnosed considering the limitations of current white light endoscopy techniques and non-directed sampling procedures. Future prospective studies in predisposed breeds should aim at applying more advanced endoscopic approaches to improve the knowledge about prevalence and breed predisposition of metaplasia and its possible association to canine gastric cancer.Disclosures: Marcus Vinicius Candido (first author).

Cuffs of both oscillometric devices were placed on the proximal pelvic limb, just above the hock. Limb circumference was measured. The HDO's cuff provided by the manufacturer was selected according to the animal's limb circumference and to the manufacturer's instructions. Systolic and diastolic pressures were recorded for each device.Statistical analysis was performed using IBM SPSS Statistics 20 (P value significant if <0.05). Data was examined using the Shapiro-wilk test of normality and the Bland-Altman method. Good agreement was defined as a bias and limits of agreement (LOA) within 15 mmHg.Twenty-three dogs (13 female and 10 male) were included among the eligible population (age 69.4 AE 57.1 months, weight 26.8 AE 9.0 kg, 15.6 AE 2.3 cm of limb circumference). Reasons for hospitalization included: ovariohysterectomy, neoplasia, gastroenteritis, spinal pathologies, hemolytic anemia and orthopedic surgery. Systolic pressure with HDO and WBP method was 150.0 AE 15.3 and 125.3 AE 11.4 mmHg respectively; diastolic pressure was 90.0 AE 16.4 and 79.7 AE 13.2 mmHg respectively. WBP monitor failed to measure BP in 4/23 dogs probably due to a nonappropriate limb's morphology. Correlation between HDO and WBP methods in dogs was moderate (systolic pressure r = 0.47, P = 0.04; diastolic pressure r = 0.4, P > 0.05). Systolic pressure agreement analysis demonstrated a bias of 22.3 mmHg and LAO 49.4 to \u00c04.9. Diastolic pressure agreement analysis demonstrated a bias of 9.1 mmHg and LAO 42.0 to \u00c023.9. Correlation between HDO-WBP agreement and limb circumference (r = \u00c00.46, P = 0.047) was moderate.In this study, we compared HDO with a human oscillometric device and found a lack of agreement between the 2 methods. In the authors' opinion, WBP monitor underestimates BP because of an inadequate size of the cuff. However, the authors believe that the lack of giant breeds and the small number of cases included in this study represents a great limit of their study.Disclosures: No disclosures to report.",
