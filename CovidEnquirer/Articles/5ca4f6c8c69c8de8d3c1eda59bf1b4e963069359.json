In this study, we generate 11 monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against S1 subunit of IBV Sczy3 strain, and two mAbs 1D5 and 6A12 were positive in indirect ELISA against both His-S1 protein and the purified whole viral antigen. MAb 6A12 and 1D5 could recognized by other 10 IBV strains (IBVs) from five different genotypes, except that 1D5 had a relatively low reaction with two of the 10 tested IBVs. End-point neutralizing assay performed in chicken embro kidney (CEK) cells revealed that the neutralization titer of 6A12 and 1D5 against Sczy3 reached 1:44.7 and 1:40.6, respectively. After screening a phage display peptide library and peptide scanning, we identified two linear B-cell epitopes that were recognized by the mAbs 1D5 and 6A12, which corresponded to the amino acid sequences 87 PPQGMAW 93 and 412 IQTRTEP 418 , respectively, in the IBV S1 subunit. Sequences comparison revealed that epitope 412 IQTRTEP 418 was conserved among IBVs, while the epitope 87 PPQGMAW 93 was relatively variable among IBVs. The novel mAbs and the epitopes identified will be useful for developing diagnostic assays for IBV infections.",

The remaining one-third of the genome encodes four main structural proteins: the spike glycoprotein (S), the small membrane protein (E), the integral membrane protein (M), and the nucleocapsid protein (N) (Lai et al., 1981) . The S glycoprotein is a large type I transmembrane glycoprotein that is responsible for receptor binding and membrane fusion (Cavanagh et al., 1986) . It consists of the N-terminal S1 and C-terminal S2 subunits, which are generated during post-translational cleavage of S protein (Jackwood et al., 2001) . The S1 subunit is the main protein to induce the protective antibodies, virus-neutralization antibodies, hemagglutination inhibition antibodies, cross-reactivity ELISA antibodies and cell-mediated immune response (Cavanagh et al., 1997; Wang et al., 2009; Zhang et al., 2014) .

In the present work, mAbs against the S1 subunit derived from China isolate of an QXlike IBV strain Sczy3 was produced and the neutralizing activity of each mAbs was analyzed by neutralizing test on chicken embryonated kidney (CEK) cells.

The mAbs reacting positively with both whole viral antigen and recombinant S1 protein in indirect ELISA (hereinafter referred to as anti-S1 MAbs) were used for further characterization. The hybridomas secreting anti-S1 mAbs were intraperitoneal injected into the 10-week-old BALB/c female mice, and the ascite fluids were collected and purified by Protein L Resin (Genscript Co., Nanjing, China). The mAb classes and subclasses were determined by using a mouse monoclonal antibody isotyping reagents kit (Sigma, St Louis, USA). The specificity and cross reaction of anti-S1 mAbs were analyzed by indirect ELISA as the method described before by using other avian viruses (NDV, AIV H5 and AIV H9) and other genotypes of IBVs (Table 1 , marked with c ) as coating antigen, respectively.

            "text": "The identification of antigenic site for the IBV structural S1 subunit was limited. In the early studies, sequence analysis was commonly used to predict the antigenic site, and diverse methods were conducted to identify the antigenic site, but most of the identified antigenic sites were not finely mapped (Hu et al., 2007; Ignjatovic and Sapats, 2005; Kant et al., 1992; Parr and Collissor, 1993; Wang et al., 1995) . Recently, RPPD libraries were used to map the antigenic site more elaborately. Han, (2013) identified two novel linear B-cell epitopes 242 FGPRTK 247 and 195 DLIARAAKI 203 of IBV nucleocapsid protein by using a Ph.D.12 TM Phage Display Peptide Library and two mAbs (Han et al., 2013) . To update, there was no report of antigenic site mapping in IBV S1 subunit by RPPD library screening. In this study, we generated 2 mAbs against the S1 subunit protein of IBV and we finely mapped two neutralizing epitopes 87 PPQGMAW 93 and 412 IQTRTEP 418 . To the best of our knowledge, these 2 epitopes are the first finely mapped neutralizing epitopes for the IBV S1 subunit protein. These two epitopes were not included in the regions of the previous studies. The reason of this discrepancy may be different viruses were used as the antigens for generating mAbs, and the production of mAbs was random. The strain Sczy3 is classified into LX-4 genotype, and recombinant analysis of Sczy3 genome demonstrated that Sczy3 was a chimeric strain derived from QX and H120 . S1 gene is now commonly used as a marker for classification of IBV. Although highly variable, it remains the first choice for developing subunit vaccine against IB. Identification of the antigenic site accurately on S1 gene is critical for the development of subunit vaccine. In addition, S1 subunit anchors to the external surface of viral particles, making it to be the antigen more easily be recognized by IBV-specific antibody than other IBV antigens. As there are still relatively conserved region or epitopes in S1 subunit, S1 could also be used as targeted antigens in the development of diagnostic agents.",
