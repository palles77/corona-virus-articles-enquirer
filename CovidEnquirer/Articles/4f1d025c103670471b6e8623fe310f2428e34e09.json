Methods: Factors that contributed to the emergence of recent outbreaks have been reviewed. Known, major outbreaks over the past two decades were reviewed. Results: We identified at least four major drivers of emergent infections: (i) increasing density of the human population; (ii) stress from farmland expansion on the environment; (iii) globalization of the food market and manufacturing; (iv) environmental contamination. The factors creating new opportunities for emerging infections include: (i) population growth; (ii) spread in health care facilities; (iii) an ageing population; (iv) international travel; (v) changing and expanding vector habitats. Conclusions: Emerging infections are unpredictable. In this review we argue that to discover new trends in infectious diseases, the clinicians have to look for the unusual and unexpected and ensure proper diagnostics and that syndromic surveillance must be supported by highly specialized laboratory services. Mathematical modeling has not been able to predict outbreaks More emphasis on the biology of evolution is needed. EID rarely stands out as unusual, and the continuous pressure on health care budgets forces clinicians and laboratories to prioritize their diagnostic work-up to common and treatable conditions. The European Society for Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology, ESCMID, has established an Emerging Infections Task Force, EITaF, to strengthen the activities of the society on emerging infections and ensure that emerging infections is included in differential diagnostic considerations in everyday clinical practice.

The majority (60.3%) of these emerging infectious diseases (EID) originated from (wild) animal reservoirs, and approximately one in five was transmitted from animal reservoir hosts to humans by disease vectors (ticks, mosquitos, midges) [1] . Pathogen discovery programs sampling wildlife hosts that are considered major reservoirs for EID (rodents, bats) have identified tremendous enzootic virus diversity, confirming their potential as sources of novel human pathogens [2] . Since 2008, the discovery of severe fever with thrombocytopenia virus and Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), as well as unusual outbreaks of Zika virus, yellow fever and Ebola highlight the importance of demographic change, global travel and trade, and possibly climate change as drivers for emergence [3e7] (http://www.promedmail.org/, archive no. 20140322.2349696 2014-03 -22) . While the field is dominated by viruses from wildlife reservoirs, the Q fever outbreak in the Netherlands, the enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli outbreak in Germany and the ongoing vast cholera outbreak in Yemen are examples of bacterial pathogens that have expanded massivelydwhich is included in the definition of an EID (Box 1) [8e10]. There is broad consensus that we need to prepare for more EID in the future.",

            "text": "A primary driver of EID comprises anthropogenic changes at the humaneanimaleecosystem interface and the One Health paradigm. We live in a world with an increasing density of humans and a consequential increase in the demand for animal protein. This is supplied either by livestock farming or through natural resources (bushmeat and fish). Animal farming plays a crucial role in providing nutrition to the planet, and by itself it does not constitute a human infection risk. However, the environmental impact and the massive increase in the demand for animal protein do, and it has become clear that there are challenges in balancing the advantages of economic growth in a free market with public and ecosystem health. It is believed that today humans and livestock comprise 90% of the world's biomass, compared to 10% from wildlife, and also compared to 0.1% of the world's biomass in the Neolithic age [12] . This in part explains why so many EID have a zoonotic origin. A study by Wolfe et al. [13] categorized zoonotic diseases by their ability to spread among humans after a species jump into five stages, ranging from dead-end primary infections (stage 2) to human-transmissible zoonotic threats (stage 4) and ultimately to new fully human pathogens (stage 5) (Fig. 1 ).",

HIV is thought to have made at least ten entries into humans before stage 5 was reached [14] . The >2000 cases of MERS-CoV reflect multiple stage 2 infections, with occasional human-to-human transmission in healthcare settings (stage 3), whereas avian influenza H5N1 and H7N9 infections are rarely transmitted among humans (stage 2) [15] (http://www. who.int/emergencies/mers-cov/risk-assessment-july-2017.pdf). As an example of emerging parasites, Plasmodium knowlesi, a malaria parasite usually infecting macaque monkeys, has emerged during the past decade as a cause of human malaria in Southeast Asia, especially in Malaysian Borneo [16] . While the parasite causes a mild or asymptomatic infection in its natural host, in humans the disease can be fatal. Humansdboth locals and touristsdentering the natural habitats of infected macaque monkeys are at risk [17] . The recognition of the importance of the human environment in the emergence of new diseases lies at the root of the One Health approach (Box 2).",

The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) coronavirus (CoV) outbreak is believed to have been introduced into humans from civet cats sold for consumption at markets, which had acquired infection from the original reservoir, horseshoe bats [18] . Similarly, many of the Ebola outbreaks have been linked to the consumption of bushmeat, of which an estimated 4.5 million tons are sold from West and Central Africa alone every year (http://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10. 2903/j.efsa.2014.3884/epdf). A risk assessment conducted by the European Food Safety Agency identified the sizeable illegal market in Europe as a risk factor for exposure to zoonotic pathogens [19] . The risk associated with this practice can change over time: the increase in monkeypox infections in the Democratic Republic of Congo has been linked to bushmeat consumption coupled with decreasing population immunity since the cessation of smallpox vaccination [20, 21] .",

Since then, it has become clear that Nipah viruses can be transmitted among humans, and the continued occurrence of outbreaks linked to consumption of foods contaminated by fruit bat secreta is a cause for concern, as there is increasing evidence that Nipah virus may be transmitted via the respiratory route [23e25].",

A valuable source of information regarding EID are the weekly communicable disease threat reports and risk assessments provided the ECDC (https:// ecdc.europa.eu/en/publications-data) that can be used when triaging patients. Samples from severely ill individuals belonging to these sentinel groups without a clear diagnosis should rapidly (within days) be referred to reference laboratories. Europe has networks of diagnostic and research laboratories capable of diagnosing a broad range of rare zoonotic and vector-borne diseases, and of rapid deployment of assays for detection of EID, but there is room for improvement in linking these laboratories to primary clinical practice and in the sharing of essential information (Table 1) .",
