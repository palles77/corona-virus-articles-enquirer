The tool could support public health decision-makers in implementation of an effective control strategy in a timely manner. Methods: We used monthly surveillance data between 2004 and 2015 to predict case counts between 2016 and 2017 prospectively. The Turkish nationwide surveillance data set collected by the Ministry of Health contained 10 411 confirmed CCHF cases. We collected potential explanatory covariates about climate, land use, and animal and human populations at risk to capture spatiotemporal transmission dynamics. We developed a structured Gaussian process algorithm and prospectively tested this tool predicting the future year's cases given past years' cases. Results: We predicted the annual cases in 2016 and 2017 as 438 and 341, whereas the observed cases were 432 and 343, respectively. Pearson's correlation coefficient and normalized root mean squared error values for 2016 and 2017 predictions were (0.83; 0.58) and (0.87; 0.52), respectively. The most important covariates were found to be the number of settlements with fewer than 25 000 inhabitants, latitude, longitude and potential evapotranspiration (evaporation and transpiration). Conclusions: Main driving factors of CCHF dynamics were human population at risk in rural areas, geographical dependency and climate effect on ticks. Our model was able to prospectively predict the numbers of CCHF cases. Our proof-of-concept study also provided insight for understanding possible mechanisms of infectious diseases and found important directions for practice and policy to combat against emerging infectious diseases. \u00c7.

Human-to-human transmission is possible, typically among health-care workers or care-givers. When the possibility for enzootic transmission exposure increases, the risk of CCHF virus infection for humans increases as well [2] . Environmental changes can influence both the survival and reproduction of H. marginatum ticks, then may trigger community outbreaks. For example, neglect of agricultural lands and agricultural reforms causing landscape alterations may be an important factor for the emergence of CCHF. The investigation of those environmental factors that may influence the cycle of CCHF is relevant for outbreak preparedness and response. Some of the seasonal and climatic covariates were previously reported as important predictors of CCHF virus infections [3e5] . Areas with higher temperatures, precipitation and humidity were linked with high CCHF occurrence in Bulgaria and Iran [4, 5] . Suitable habitat for H. marginatum ticks was reported as fragmented agricultural lands, forested lands and grass cover in Turkey and Bulgaria, and non-irrigated agricultural land (e.g. pasture) was found to be correlated with CCHF case counts in Turkey [5e7].",

We have already presented the improved performance of a structured Gaussian process (GP), against frequently used machinelearning algorithms used in ecological and epidemiological applications [13] . Here we describe the spatiotemporal dynamics of CCHF and extract the important covariates for CCHF virus infection using a structured GP method on the surveillance data set for Turkey.

This unobserved variable is a GP with the mean vector m and covariance matrix S, which depends on the inputs [15] . In this study, we formulated a GP model with a Kronecker decomposition approach for spatiotemporal modelling, named structured GP, to learn covariance functions for both knowledge extraction and prediction. Our main hypothesis about the spatiotemporal processes is that response values depend on both time and location. We need a kernel function (i.e. covariance function) that makes nearby observations in time and/or space produce similar values. Each spatial and temporal covariate is fed into a kernel function for structured GP, (see Supplementary material, Appendix S1, for a detailed description).",

This term refers to providing the ideal amount of water to plants. It is also obvious that season covariate determines the temporal behaviour of CCHF or other seasonal infectious diseases in general. These two important temporal covariates confirm the role of the climate for the underlying mechanism of CCHF. Careful follow up of these covariates may provide possible warnings in the short term instead of having to wait for yearly predictions from our model. Higher temperature was previously found as a main driver for the abundance of H. marginatum [1, 12, 16, 18] because high temperatures may accelerate the life cycle of ticks and so increase host questing.",

In our model for the 2017 prediction, goats, cattle and sheep were found to be the most significant animals for CCHF dynamics and spread, respectively. These findings contradict the observations of veterinarians in the field, who claim that bovine/cattle livestock are more important than goat livestock in the transmission cycle of the virus. This contradiction implies that there are some other underlying reasons such as the farmers; those caring for the goats might come into hand contact with them with or without protection. We must take into account the possible reasons why a covariate is chosen and take precaution against it respectively. The importance of covariates that may be related to human action indicates that awareness is lacking in some parts of the country about the presence of CCHF or precautions against CCHF. Our model identifies the directions to which we should pay close attention with high priority. For instance, in the areas with high goat, cattle or sheep density, agricultural workers and others working with animals should also be monitored and must be informed about CCHF. For further investigation, tick abundance studies in the field should be developed and improved.",

Predicting the total number of cases from overall seasonality is easier than capturing spatial dependencies because time-series data are dependent on whether there is seasonality behaviour of the data. One limitation of this study is that our model may not predict an outbreak if the reason for the outbreak is not related to the covariates that we used to train our model. However, when the first data of the outbreak arrive, the model will update itself accordingly, although there might be some delay for accurate predictions. Another limitation is that even if the surveillance data are ready, covariate data (e.g. livestock statistics) might be published much later or might be incomplete at the time of prediction. Then, the model would not be able to benefit from all information sources to better capture the progress of disease dynamics. However, these problems are valid for all data-driven models.",
