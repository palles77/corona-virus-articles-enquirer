This lack of certainty is not surprising, because in approximately 50% of pneumonias, an identifiable pathogen cannot be established by conventional laboratory testing. Molecular techniques such as polymerase chain reaction (PCR) analysis improve this number but are rarely performed in routine clinical care. Difficulties in obtaining adequate specimens for viral cultures or molecular testing add to the problem. However, several recent studies have made efforts to quantify the burden of viral communityacquired pneumonias in adults and are summarized in Table  25 -1. Although the proportion of viral pneumonias varies in these studies owing to differences in study populations and rigor of testing for viruses, it is clear that viruses cause a significant proportion of pneumonias. Overall, in immunocompetent adults hospitalized with pneumonia, viruses are the responsible pathogens in 15% to 30% of the cases, either by themselves or as copathogens with bacteria. Lower respiratory secretions such as bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid, tracheal aspirates, or good-quality induced sputum are preferable as specimens for diagnosis of viral pneumonia. Such specimens are more difficult to obtain, however, and most studies have used nasopharyngeal wash samples or swabs for culture and molecular testing. Presence of established pathogens such as influenza virus in such upper respiratory tract samples in a patient with pneumonia most probably implies that the virus is a sole or copathogen in causation of pneumonia; however, this general rule may not be applicable to other viruses. Presence of such viruses as rhinovirus might imply only upper respiratory infection in a patient with pneumonia due to another pathogen. Findings on studies of viral pneumonias must therefore be interpreted with some caution.",

The seasonal incidence of S. pneumoniae infection in a community parallels the incidence of influenza illness. The mechanisms underlying the increased frequency and severity of these influenza-associated bacterial pneumonias are mostly unclear at present, but emerging evidence suggests roles for multiple viral and host factors. Increased apoptosis and desquamation of airway epithelial cells infected with influenza virus exposes multiple surface adhesins for pathogenic bacteria. Influenza viruses expressing PB1-F2, a proapoptotic protein that interferes with mitochondrial function and increases epithelial cell apoptosis, increase susceptibility to S. pneumoniae infection. When infected with viral strains lacking PB1-F2, mice were less susceptible to bacterial pneumonia, compared with those infected with wild-type viral strains.

It originally was considered that most of the deaths in the 1918 influenza pandemic were due to primary viral pneumonia. Later analysis of multiple data sources, however, strongly suggested that a majority of deaths (approximately 80%) from influenza-related pneumonia were due to secondary bacterial (postinfluenza) pneumonias, caused primarily by S. pneumoniae and H. influenzae and other gramnegative organisms such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and Escherichia coli. A series of 33 patients with influenza-related pneumonias and deaths from the 1957-1958 pandemic again showed that a majority of deaths were due to bacterial pneumonia. Of 33 patients, 15 had acquired bacterial pneumonia after influenza illness; six had primary viral pneumonia with isolation of influenza virus, but no bacterial pathogen, from lung tissue; and nine had concomitant bacterial and viral pneumonia. In the recent (2009) H1N1 virus pandemic, initial reports suggested that deaths were mostly due to viral pneumonia. Further analysis of autopsy lung specimens showed that in approximately 30% of these deaths, a bacterial pathogen could be identified by molecular studies. However, the proportion of viral pneumonia (approximately 70%) is striking and higher than in previous pandemics. Moreover, S. aureus, especially methicillin-resistant S. aureus (MRSA), was found in a significant proportion of bacterial pneumonias, with high mortality, especially among teenage patients. Therefore, in summary, primary viral as well as secondary bacterial infections, including those due to MRSA, must be considered in every case of influenza-related pneumonia and treated presumptively until full identification of the pathogens involved is obtained. has demonstrated that in many patients, especially in those with chronic respiratory diseases such as COPD or immunosuppression, rhinovirus is present in the lower airways during pneumonia.

Patients with viral pneumonias tend to be older and frailer, with other comorbid conditions such as cardiac failure and COPD; have less chest pain, tachycardia, and fever; and show lower levels of leukocytosis than in the characteristic clinical picture in bacterial pneumonias. Features such as rhinitis, conjunctivitis, and pharyngitis or a typical rash for varicella or measles can point to a viral etiology for pneumonia. Gastrointestinal complaints often accompany influenza-related infections. RSV infections are more likely to be associated with wheezing than influenza virus infections.

Its use in adults critically ill with pneumonia and proven RSV infection should be considered carefully, with involvement of a physician who has some experience in using ribavirin in such situations. Ribavirin aerosol often is combined with intravenous immunoglobulin to treat (Rapid Influenza Diagnosis Test [RIDT]). Although highly specific (90% to 95%), these rapid tests have lower sensitivity (approximately 70%) compared with viral culture and molecular methods, especially when the viral load is low. A rapid antigen detection test is available for RSV; its sensitivity is very low compared with that of culture-only about 10%.",

This remains an area to be explored. Pending further data, clinical judgment of whether the virus detected from upper respiratory samples might be responsible for pneumonia is necessary. When serious pathogens such as influenza virus are detected in a patient with pneumonia, the prudent approach is to assume that the patient has a viral and possibly a secondary bacterial pneumonia and treat accordingly. The situation is much less clear cut for less well-established lower respiratory tract pathogens such as hMPV, bocavirus, and rhinovirus. Recent evidence shows that high viral load in nasopharyngeal samples, as determined using quantitative PCR assay, correlates with an increased chance that the lower respiratory disease is due to the virus.
