A total of 199 calves from nine commercial farms aged between 21 and 55 days old at the start of study were included and randomly allocated to one of three groups. Calves on all farms were observed for a period of 78 days post treatment, using both parasitological (oocyst excretion), and clinical parameters (faecal score and body weight). The assessment of efficacy was based on both control of oocyst excretion, and on the average daily weight gains throughout the study.",

Excretion in the untreated group peaked at 21 days after treatment. In both the diclazuril and toltrazuril-treated groups, mean oocyst excretion decreased dramatically in the five days following treatment. Thereafter, particularly towards the end of the study period, oocyst counts and percentage levels of E. zuernii were highest in the toltrazuril-treated group. In pooled data from all trial sites, the average daily weight gain was significantly (p = 0.01) higher (+0.057 kg/day) in the diclazuril group when compared to the toltrazuril group, and the average body weight gain of the diclazuril treated group was 4.4 kg higher than the toltrazuril group. On eight of the nine trial sites, the average daily gain was greater in the diclazuril group than in the toltrazuril group. This study demonstrates that, over an extended observation period of 78 days, metaphylactic treatment with both diclazuril and toltrazuril reduces the impact of coccidiosis, but greater performance benefits based on average daily weight gains, were achieved following the use of diclazuril.",

In the weeks prior to weaning, rotavirus, coronavirus, Escherichia coli and other pathogens were considered to be the most common causes of diarrhoea and few considered coccidiosis as a severe concern for calves younger than 1 month of age.

At this time, calves are exposed to multiple stresses and subsequently are prone to bacterial, viral and parasitic infections. It is well known that coccidiosis treatment at such a time is only curative and retrospective. By the time of treatment, it is too late to avoid the development of extensive intestinal lesions. Consequently, most practitioners will administer metaphylactic treatment between 8 and 15 days after movement of calves on dairy farms. In this study, the inclusion of sentinel, control calves confirms a high level of oocyst excretion at SD1, i.e. 15 days after introduction onto their respective farms, and the presence of oocyst counts >1000 opg comprising approximately 70% pathogenic Eimeria species (Fig. 2) . These results fully justify the timing of metaphylactic treatment with one of the benzene acetonitrile anticoccidial products. Ideally, administration of these drugs after the first infection should allow the development of immunity protecting against new severe coccidia infections.",

The mean age of calves at the beginning of the trial was 40 days and at the end of the trial over 118 days; i.e. during the period of highest susceptibility to clinical coccidiosis (Taylor and Catchpole, 1994 ). This has not been the case in previously described studies comparing toltrazuril and diclazuril. One study gives a very short follow-up period; only 43 days (Mundt et al., 2007) ; the other study (Veronesi et al., 2011) had two groups of calves treated with both drugs, and a non-treated control group monitored over a period of 40 weeks, but with no data provided on the kinetics of oocyst excretion. The results of this trial cannot therefore be easily compared with other, shorter duration trials due to the fact that calves are reportedly, typically susceptible to clinical coccidiosis between 3 weeks to six months in the field (Taylor and Catchpole, 1994) and the fact that it is very difficult to attribute the effects of a single metaphylactic treatment 40 weeks later.",

In this study, oocysts disappeared from faeces for five days post-treatment, and re-appeared more rapidly for the group A (diclazuril) calves compared to the group B (toltrazuril) calves. However, during the second part of the study (SD36 to SD78), the levels of oocyst excretion for group B (toltrazuril) calves then increased when compared to the group A (diclazuril) treated calves. During the initial challenge period, the predominant pathogenic species present was E. bovis, which then declined, only to be superseded by E. zuernii. Levels of the non-pathogenic Eimeria species fluctuated throughout. Towards the end of the study period, however, oocyst counts and the percentages of pathogenic species with OPG >500 opg were higher in the toltrazuril-treated group, with E. zuernii predominating. We summarise that the higher levels of protection provided immediately post-treatment, had prevented the development of species-specific immunity to E. zuernii in the toltrazuril-treated group leading to sub-clinical coccidiosis and an impact on growth. Due to the published persistency of toltrazuril, these observations are highly unlikely to have been observed in previously published trials of shorter duration.",

In this 78-day study, the diclazuril-treated group (group A) had a mean body weight of 4.4 kg greater than the toltrazuril-treated group (group B). Unlike the findings of Mundt et al. (2007) , we demonstrate that ADG is significantly higher (+0.057 kg/day (p = 0.01)) in the diclazuril-treated group (group A) compared to the toltrazuril-treated group (group B). This finding is most probably the result of the longer study period; the main effect of metaphylactic treatment being observed one month after administration. The most important factor for farmers is a higher growth rate. Here, it must be stressed that these results was observed within the period of reported highest susceptibility of calves to coccidiosis (3 weeks to 6 months of age) when reared under commercial farm conditions. Interestingly, it is possible to differentiate between two periods in this study: a) Between SD1 and SD22: despite a higher percentage of calves excreting oocysts in the diclazuril-treated group A calves, the ADG and the faecal score were similar between the two groups. b) Between SD22 and SD78: when the percentage of calves excreting oocysts increases in the toltrazuril-treated group B; and the ADG is higher for the diclazuril-treated group A calves than for the toltrazuril-treated group B calves. This latter period comprises the total difference in ADG between both groups.",

Epidemiological studies (J\u00e4ger et al., 2005; S\u00e1nchez et al., 2008; Alzieu et al., 2012) show that younger calves are more susceptible to coccidiosis, with a peak average of excretion prevalence between 30 and 50 days of age. Neonate calves are immunologically na\u00efve at birth; the development of the immune system in calves progresses from conception to maturity at approximately 6 months after birth. In order to enhance the adaptive immune response, newborn calves need to \"experience\" pathogens (Chase et al., 2008) . Consequently, persistent or longer-acting treatments against coccidiosis in young calves could delay development of the immune response; and in this respect the toltrazuril-treated calves in this study displayed a peak of excretion prevalence 60 days after treatment, suggesting a detrimental effect on growth performance. It has previously been surmised that treatments with a benzene acetonitrile compound may have an effect on the development of immunity to coccidial infection in cattle and that if a treatment did interfere with the acquisition of immunity following subsequent reexposure, then severe disease may follow (Jonsson et al., 2011) . A study conducted by Taylor et al. (2011) with diclazuril given at 1 mg/kg BW (recommended dose) to lambs, demonstrated that at this dose level the treatment was effective in preventing coccidiosis in lambs, but at higher dose levels (2.0 and 4.0 mg/kg BW) it appeared to completely clear the lambs of coccidia rendering them susceptible to re-infection. Due to differences in pharmacokinetic properties between diclazuril and toltrazuril, we can hypothesize that differences in dose rate (diclazuril 1 mg/kg; toltrazuril 15 mg/kg) and subsequent periods of activity, could explain why toltrazuril-treated calves appear to be more susceptible to infection from 30 days post treatment compared with diclazuril-treated calves, as demonstrated by the differences in growth performance and increased levels of oocyst excretion.",

The choice of correct timing for the beginning of preventive treatment must be carefully determined based on history and farm management. For most calves, cases of coccidiosis typically develop 15 days after stressful events or movement on, or between farms. Oocyst counts on their own are insufficient in evaluating the efficacy of metaphylactic treatments, and speciation should also be undertaken. In this study, monitoring ADG over a longer post-treatment period identified an advantageous effect for metaphylatic treatment of dairy calves with diclazuril. The shorter duration of action appeared to allow a better degree of exposure to sufficient numbers and species of Eimeria for subsequent species-specific protective immunity to develop.",
