In addition, the fecal pH level was found to be alkaline, and fecal osmolality and volatile fatty acid concentrations decreased with the onset of diarrhea. The authors concluded that their data suggests a hypersecretion in the small intestinal mucosa, which was not compensated for by the immature colon [3] . These findings, along with a temporal association with coprophagy, suggest that the diarrhea occurs in response to the establishment of normal GI flora. Such foals do not require therapy, although they should be monitored closely because early forms of enteritis can mimic foal heat diarrhea. Any signs of systemic disease, including depression or reduced appetite should warrant close investigation of such a neonate.",

At-risk foals include those born as a result of dystocia or cesarean section, those with umbilical cord problems during delivery, and those with abnormal oxygenation in the immediate postpartum period. Gastroenteropathies may result from hypoperfusion, hypoxic-ischemic and reperfusion injury, and inflammatory mediators. The resulting clinical effects of ischemic enterocolitis include gastroduodenal reflux, ileus, intolerance to enteral feeding, colic, abdominal distention, and diarrhea. Because the organ injury is not limited to the gut, these foals require intensive care. Concurrent organ dysfunction includes neurologic dysfunction, nephropathies, and cardiac or endocrine disorders. As far as the gastrointestinal tract is concerned, foals with asphyxia-associated diarrhea should be checked for nasogastric reflux, may require prokinetic drugs, and should be fed very conservatively through the enteral route. Severely affected foals benefit from parenteral nutrition, with only small volumes of enteral milk to provide local nutrients to enterocytes. Because affected foals are at high risk of developing sepsis, they should be treated with broadspectrum systemic antimicrobials. Ultrasonography is a useful means of monitoring the progress of GI dysfunction in these foals.",

            "text": "Necrotizing enterocolitis (NEC) is the most serious gastrointestinal emergency of human infants under intensive care [4] . NEC consists of necrotic injury to the mucosal and submucosal layers of the GI tract. Although the entire GI tract, from the stomach to the rectum, is susceptible, the distal small intestine and proximal colon are most frequently involved. Symptoms of NEC in human neonates include abdominal distention, ileus, hematochezia, and emesis, along with signs of sepsis. Suspected cases often present with nonspecific signs, including food intolerance, gastric residuals, GI bleeding, and sepsis. Foals may develop a similar syndrome. Despite decades of research and clinical investigation, a complete understanding of the pathogenesis of NEC remains unclear. The syndrome involves a complex interaction of immaturity, previous gastrointestinal mucosal injury, enteral milk feeding, and bacterial invasion [4] . The majority (70%-90%) of infants with NEC are born preterm, highlighting the importance of GI maturation to the syndrome [4] . The incidence of NEC varies inversely with gestational age and birth weight. Premature infants may experience vasoconstriction, hypotension, and thrombosis leading to decreased GI perfusion [4] . Additional contributors to reduced mucosal perfusion in preterm infants include umbilical artery catheters and patent ductus arteriosus, with the use of indomethacin possibly contributing to NEC risk [4] . There are some notable differences in NEC that affect preterm and term neonates. NEC in very low-birth weight infants occurs later than in older and larger infants. The onset of NEC is often insidious in preterm infants, with sudden signs occurring more often in older neonates. Risk factors differ as well; those for full-term infants include congenital heart disease, polycythemia, coexisting conditions such as hypothyroidism, Down syndrome or gastroschisis, aggressive enteral feedings, and conditions compromising GI oxygenation such as supraventricular tachycardia.",

Other forms of injury are inflammatory, with release of interleukins (IL) such as IL-6. Histologic findings include ulceration, edema, hemorrhage, congestion, and in severe cases, transmural coagulation necrosis with perforation. The initial mucosal injury produced by ischemia in an immature infant was believed to predispose the infant to bacterial invasion. Milk was thought to serve as a substrate for bacterial proliferation and subsequent infection, the final factors known to contribute to development of NEC. Abnormal intestinal gas produced by the bacteria then appears as pneumatosis intestinalis or portal venous gas on abdominal radiography or ultrasonography. These risk factors have been questioned recently because of cases of NEC in full term infants and those that were never fed enterally. However, prematurity remains the primary risk factor, because most cases are seen among immature infants.",

A nasogastric (NG) tube placed too high (in the esophagus or upper stomach segments) may fail to accurately measure residuals. Both the syringe diameter and the size of the NG tube may affect the volume of aspirate. Residuals should be measured before each feeding, and the meal should be withheld if significant amounts of milk or fluid are aspirated. The ideal feeding volume and maximal allowable residuals have not been calculated in foals. Certainly, a gradual or slow advancement of feedings and small frequent meals or continuous feeding should be applied to premature foals or those with suspected mucosal injury [6] . Foals with ileus, as reflected by hypomotility on ultrasonographic examination, persistent reflux or residuals, abdominal distention, gaseous distention of the GI tract on abdominal radiography, and the absence of stool passage should not be fed enterally. In addition to the amount of feed, the type of enteral nutrition also is important in the prevention of NEC. In humans, a number of studies [4] have demonstrated that breast milk is more protective than formula. Extrapolating this to foals, mare's milk should be used whenever possible, particularly for preterm foals and those with GI injury. The dams of compromised neonates can be milked by hand or with syringes every 1 to 2 hours to provide enteral nutrition for their foals.",

Some strains of the microorganism, particularly type A isolates, are part of the normal gastrointestinal microflora of horses and foals and can be cultured readily from feces. However, other strains are pathogenic; the number of colony-forming units (CFU) per gram of feces is another determinant of whether colonization is associated with clinical disease. Concentrations less than 10 2 CFU/mL are consistent with benign colonization, whereas most foals with clinical disease show concentrations greater than 10 3 CFU/mL [13] . C perfringens isolates are typed as A, B, C, D, and E, based on the production of one or more large protein exotoxins (a, b, b-2, 3, and enterotoxin). Types A and C are most commonly associated with diarrhea in foals less than 10 days of age. Type A produces a toxin, whereas type C produces both a and b toxins. Enterotoxin is variably produced by all types of C perfringens but most commonly by type A isolates. Typing of isolates is performed using polymerase chain reaction analysis for toxin gene sequences after isolates are cultured [13] . Commercial immunoassays for toxin detection in feces are available only for enterotoxin, which is present only in a minority of cases. Type C causes hemorrhagic and often severe diarrhea, with a higher mortality than type A [13] . Other clinical signs associated with C perfringens infection include colic, dehydration, tachypnea, and obtunded mentation. In the study by East and colleagues [14] , foals born on dirt, sand, or gravel and those kept stalled or in dry-lot conditions during the first 3 days of life were found more likely to develop C perfringens-associated disease. Most foals in one study were less than 6 days of age on presentation, and 88% manifested acute onset disease (%24 h) [13] . Common hematologic findings include an increased number of band neutrophils, leukopenia with neutropenia, toxic cytologic changes, and hyperfibrinogenemia [13] . Hypoproteinemia also is common, although this can be masked on presentation caused by hemoconcentration. Interestingly, most foals (96% in one study [13] ) demonstrate adequate passive transfer of colostral antibodies [13] . This has led some authors to speculate that trypsin inhibitors in colostrum may protect against gastric degradation of toxins, thereby potentiating toxigenicity [13] . The serum biochemistry profile of affected foals is variable, but severely affected foals may have hyperbilirubinemia, azotemia, and increased hepatic enzymes if they exhibit severe sepsis or systemic inflammatory response syndrome (SIRS) [13] . Abdominocentesis can reflect an exudate in foals with severe enteritis. Abdominal ultrasonography and radiography may show gas-and fluiddistended small and large intestines. In the study by East and colleagues [13] , the overall mortality rate of foals with C perfringens infections was 54%; those with type A had a 28% mortality (including both death and euthanasia), whereas those with type C had a mortality rate of 83%. In that study, treatment did not appear to alter the mortality rate for most foals that had a positive culture for type C [13] , highlighting the importance of early and aggressive intervention. A predominance of large, gram-positive rods or spores found on a fecal smear or Gram stain may suggest the presence of clostridial overgrowth and allows for an early clinical suspicion of infection [13] .",

            "text": "C difficile also can produce enteritis, with severe, watery to hemorrhagic diarrhea. Like C perfringens, it also can affect foals sporadically or in outbreak situations. Toxins A (enterotoxin) and B (cytotoxin) and binary (ADP ribosyltransferase) toxins play an important role in the pathogenesis of enterocolitis caused by C difficile. They alter epithelial cytoskeletal integrity, increase mucosal permeability, and incite inflammation. Interestingly, foals may be asymptomatic carriers of C difficile as well, and it has been hypothesized that they may serve as potential reservoirs of infection for their dams [12, 15] . Up to 29% of healthy foals less than 14 days of age, in one study, were found to be culture-positive for C difficile [12] . This same phenomenon occurs in group-housed human infants. It is unknown why human infants and some foals can become asymptomatically colonized with toxigenic C difficile, whereas others develop severe disease. Diarrheal disease also can be experimentally reproduced in foals [16] . C difficile can act as a primary pathogen in neonates, without requiring antimicrobial administration as a risk factor, as in most adult horses [16] [17] [18] . Specific tests include fecal culture and toxin assays. These tests should be coupled because nontoxigenic isolates cannot be differentiated from toxigenic isolates based on culture alone. Commercial immunoassays for toxins A or B and fecal cell culture cytotoxin assays (for toxin B) allow for the differentiation between toxigenic and nontoxigenic infections. Either toxin A or B alone can provide enough virulence to cause disease, and both are not required as believed previously. As for C perfringens, a fecal smear showing large numbers of gram-positive rods or spores suggests clostridial overgrowth, although this is not specific for either organism.",

            "text": "The therapy of foals with clostridial enterocolitis includes intensive and supportive care in addition to specific therapies. Supportive measures include correction of fluid, acid-base, and electrolyte derangements. Hemodynamic support in the form of inotrope and vasopressor therapy may be needed if the volume replacement is not enough to normalize blood pressure. The correction of low oncotic pressure from hypoproteinemia or hypoalbuminemia is performed by administering plasma or synthetic colloids. Affected foals should be monitored for the development of coagulopathy, for which plasma or low-molecular weight heparin may be necessary. Specific therapy includes the early use of metronidazole (10-15 mg/kg intravenous [IV] or PO, every 8-12 h). Bacitracin is not recommended in horses (unlike human patients with C difficile infections) because of a high prevalence of resistance among equine C difficile isolates [12, 19] . Some C difficile isolates from foals have been reported to be resistant to metronidazole, and vancomycin has been used in those circumstances [19, 20] . This finding is of concern and is somewhat unusual relative to human isolates. Fortunately, resistance appears to be geographic, because other authors have not found equine isolates in their hospitals to be metronidazole-resistant [12] . Nasogastric administration of di-tri-octahedral smectite (Biosponge, Platinum Performance, Buellton, CA) may be indicated as evidenced by the in vitro neutralization of C difficile toxins A and B and C perfringens enterotoxins [21] . Plasma products are controversial, but anecdotal or empirical use of C perfringens type C and D antitoxin has been reported in foals [13] . Slow administration and pretreatment with diphenydramine are warranted. Foals with C difficile enteritis can develop lactase deficiency secondary to the loss of small intestinal mucosal brush border. The supplementation of foals with lactase enzyme (Lactaid tablets, 6000 U/50-kg foal PO, every 3-8 h) may be helpful.",

Equine rotaviruses belong to group A rotaviruses, with a number of different serotypes identified, including G3, G5, G10, G13, G14, P7, P12, and P18 [29, 30] . Rotavirus infections often occur as outbreaks on farms. Experimentally, the incubation period appears to be as short as 2 days [31] . Most affected foals are between 5 and 35 days old but the majority are at the younger end of this range [31] . It appears that older foals (up to 60 days old) can be infected, although diarrhea tends to be milder in this age group, but they can serve as reservoirs for neonates and should be isolated when identified. Transmission occurs directly by animal-to-animal and indirectly through personnel or fomites. Clinical signs of rotaviral diarrhea are similar to those of other infectious diarrheas, with a wide range from mild diarrhea to severe, watery diarrhea with dehydration. Some clinicians have suggested an association between gastroduodenal ulcer syndrome and rotaviral infections, although this requires study [10] . The virus affects the small intestine, causing blunting of the microvillus. Maldigestion and malabsorption result. With villous atrophy and compensatory crypt cell proliferation, a net decrease in fluid absorption and an increase in secretion occur. With maldigestion, lactose may enter the colon, with subsequent fermentation and osmotic contribution to diarrhea. Rotaviral infections are diagnosed through the demonstration of virus particles in feces using commercial immunoassays or electron microscopy.",

Antibody titers were significantly increased at the time of foaling in vaccinated mares and for 90 days after birth in their foals compared with the nonvaccinated group. The incidence of rotaviral diarrhea was lower in foals born to vaccinated mares compared with foals born to controls; however, the difference was not statistically significant [30] .

The use of crystalloids alone may compound hypoproteinemia and hypo-oncotic states because most foals with enteritis have at least some degree of protein-losing enteropathy. The types, volumes, and rates of fluid administration are highly variable, and the ideal selections are best tailored to the individual foal. However, as general guidelines, good replacement crystalloid choices for the foal with enteritis include lactate Ringer's solution, Normosol R, and Plasma-Lyte 148. Physiologic saline (0.9%) is another choice but is considered less ideal by this author because of its high chloride (154 mEq/L) relative to normal foal plasma. This makes saline mildly acidifying by decreasing the strong ion difference. Saline may be indicated, however, in the hyperkalemic foal because the other commercial replacement fluids contain potassium. Hyperkalemia may be present in the foal with concurrent acute renal disease or hyperkalemic periodic paralysis. Saline also is indicated in the concurrently hyponatremic and hypochloremic foal, in which both are decreased to the same relative extent. Isotonic bicarbonate is another replacement fluid that can be used in the foal with severe metabolic acidemia that is inorganic in origin. Hypertonic saline (7%) also is available as a rapid and temporary expander of intravascular volume. However, serum sodium concentrations should be monitored closely to avoid marked swings.

Therefore, boluses of 3 to 5 mL/kg colloids should be used. Plasma should be administered slowly to avoid or minimize the risks for anaphylactoid reactions. It can be administered at a rate of 10 mL/kg/h for a total volume of 1 to 2 L, or alternatively it can be used as a constant rate infusion (CRI) of 1 to 2 mL/kg/h as needed for colloid and albumin replacement. Plasma is a cost-effective colloid in foals and has the additional benefit of providing antibodies, clotting factors, antithrombin, and other proteins. Hetastarch can be used in small boluses; however, a total volume of 10 mL/kg/day should not be exceeded, to avoid coagulopathy.

Treatment consists of volume replacement until no further correction in blood pressure occurs, blood lactate concentrations improve (%2 mmol/L), or alternatively, until CVP approaches 10 cm H 2 O. Once these occur, inotropes and vasopressors should be used if perfusion is still inadequate. Dobutamine (2-10 mg/kg/min, CRI) is an excellent inotrope. If pressures and perfusion are still inadequate, vasopressors such as norepinephrine or vasopressin can be tried. Norepinephrine should be diluted in 5% dextrose and is administered at a rate of 0.01 to 0.1 mk/kg/min. Vasopressin has been used more recently in foals, and a suggested dose range is 0.25 to 0.5 mU/kg/min. During vasopressor therapy, the foal should be monitored for excessive vasoconstriction and worsening of hypoperfusion, despite showing increases in blood pressure by monitoring serial blood lactate concentrations, urine output, and clinical parameters of perfusion. A word of caution should be added about lactate: Many foals with SIRS or sepsis remain hyperlactatemic despite volume replacement because of inflammatory mediator-induced decreases in pyruvate dehydrogenase (through activation of pyruvate dehydrogenase kinase) or increases in the production of lactate caused by catecholamine stimulation of the sodium-potassium ATP pump activity. Therefore, urine production and clinical signs of perfusion parameters are very important monitoring tools in addition to blood pressure.",

Sodium concentrations can be corrected fairly rapidly up to 115 to 120 mEq/L in order to correct neurologic deficits, but beyond this amount, concentrations should be corrected slowly, at approximately 0.5 mEq/h to avoid central pontine myelinolysis. Serum sodium concentrations should be monitored frequently to avoid overcorrection. Occasionally, hypernatremia may be encountered, particularly if foals have been oversupplemented with oral sodiumcontaining fluids before presentation. Hypernatremia should also be corrected slowly to avoid increases in intracranial pressure (0.5 mEq/h).",

However, because foals with enteritis are at risk for developing ulcers, particularly glandular ulcers, this author currently recommends the use of ulcer medications in these foals [7] . Medications may consist of histamine type-2 receptor antagonists, sucralfate, or proton pump inhibitors. Histamine type-2 antagonists include ranitidine (1.5 mg IV, every 8-12 h or 6.6 mg/kg PO, every 8 h) and famotidine (2.8 mg/kg PO, every 12 h or 0.3 mg/kg IV, every 12h). Omeprazole, the most commonly used proton pump inhibitor, has been studied recently in the healthy neonatal foal. A dose of 4 mg/kg PO, every 24 h, increases the gastric pH level within 2 h of administration and for 22 hours [43] . Sucralfate has a number of advantages, including binding glandular ulcers and increasing local prostaglandin E production, thereby increasing mucosal blood flow and mucus and bicarbonate secretion. The recommended dosage of sucralfate is 10 to 20 mg/kg PO, every 6 to 8 h.",

            "text": "Nutritional support is a very important aspect of managing the neonatal foal with diarrhea. Foals with abdominal distention, gastric residuals, ileus, or colic should be withheld from milk temporarily. Foals with profuse diarrhea, particularly those types of diarrhea suspected to be associated with lactose intolerance or an osmotic diarrhea, should be restricted at least partially in terms of milk intake. In these cases, parenteral nutrition should be provided. Dextrose supplementation (4-8 mg/kg/min with frequent monitoring of blood glucose concentrations) of crystalloids can be used in the short term (first 12-24 h). If enteral nutrition is not tolerated by this time, parenteral nutrition should be instituted. This author uses the following formula as a starting point for making a total parenteral nutrition solution: 1000 mL 50% dextrose \u00fe 1500 mL 8.5% amino acid solution \u00fe 500 mL 20% intralipid to make a total volume of 3000 mL. This solution has a caloric content of 1.07 kcal/mL digestible energy, 0.0425 g/mL amino acids, and 0.033 g/mL lipid. The energy requirements of the neonatal foal with diarrhea are unknown. General guidelines for the energy requirements of the neonatal foal include a range of 45 to 50 kcal/kg/ day for basal energy requirement and 100 to 170 kcal/kg/day for normal, healthy foals. This author usually targets a value between these amounts, approximately 70 to 75 kcal/kg/day, with gradual advancement as parenteral nutrition is tolerated. Vitamins and minerals must be added to this solution or alternatively to the crystalloids being administered. Serum glucose, serum triglycerides, electrolytes, and acid-base status should be monitored closely in foals receiving parenteral nutrition. Foals intolerant of glucose may benefit from insulin (regular insulin, 0.005-0.01 IU/kg/h, titrated to glucose concentrations). The lipid fraction is decreased if triglyceride concentrations exceed 200 mg/dL. Information on foal nutrition and parenteral nutrition has been described elsewhere [45, 46] .",
