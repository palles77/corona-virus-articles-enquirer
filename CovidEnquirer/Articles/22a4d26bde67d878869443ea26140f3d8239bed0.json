While <1% of variance was explained by sex and mating, much more was 314 explained by genetic background (7.94% and 11%) alongside its interactions with 315 sex (19.2%) and mating (4.38%) ( Figure 5 ; Table 4 ). Table 5 ). Sex however, explained <1% of the deviance, while genetic 341 background and its interaction with sex explained 2.2% and 3.07% ( Figure 5 ). Mating 342 did not affect qualitative DCV shedding (Figure 3a ; Table 5 ) and explained <1% of 343 the deviance ( Figure 5 ; Table 5 ). In flies where DCV was detected in shedding, 344 quantitative DCV shedding was affected by genetic background and the extent of 345 this variation was determined by female mating status, but not sex ( Figure 3b ; Table  346 6). The amount of variance explained by sex and in our models was <1%, in 347 comparison with genetic background (9.48% and 5.82%) and its interactions with sex 348 (8.87%) or mating (6.53%) ( Figure 5 ; Table 6 ). Qualitative and quantitative DCV 349 shedding peaked at day 2 (Figures 3a; Tables 5 & 6, pairwise comparisons,  350 p<0.0001). Across all treatment groups, there was no significant relationship between 351 viral load and shedding ( Figure S1 ; Table 6 ). The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/733915 doi: bioRxiv preprint Table 7 ). Sex (0.28%), genetic 374 background (2.3%) and the interaction between the two (2.83%) explained relatively 375 little deviance in our models ( Figure 5 ; Table 7 ). In quantitative variation in V, sex 376 explained <1%, while genetic background and its interaction with sex explained 377 4.13% and 11.4% of variance respectively ( Figure 5 ; Table 8) . We also observed clear qualitative and quantitative differences in V between males and 473 females, which is suggestive of sex-specific variation in disease transmission. While the 474 extent of any difference between males and females is also determined by genetic 475 background, a greater proportion of males tend to transmit DCV than females across 476 these backgrounds. In DCV shedding, a greater proportion of males from several genetic 477 backgrounds (RAL-379, RAL-738 and RAL-818) shed DCV than females (Figure 3a) . Sex-specific variation in qualitative differences in shedding exerts a significant influence 489 over shedding (Figure 3a) . It is important to note however, that in isolation, sex accounts 490 for a miniscule 0.64% of the deviance in qualitative variation in shedding. Sex appears to 491 play a more important role in conjunction with genetic background, the interaction 492 between the two explaining 3.07% of deviance ( Figure 5 ). While significant, sex-specific 493 variation may play a relatively minor role in shedding. A variety of factors appear to 494 underlie sex-differences in shedding across host-pathogen systems. For example, male-495 biased infection is common to many mammal hosts but generally absent from arthropod 496 hosts (Sheridan et al., 2000) . In the water flea, Daphnia magna, parasite spores are 497 released into the environment upon death and females have been shown to release 498 significantly more than males (Thompson et al., 2017) . In the vole, Microtus gryalis, the 499 faeces of females contains significantly more parasite eggs than that of males (Sanchez 500 et al., 2011) . Given that we see female-biased mortality to DCV infection (Figure 1a) , it is 501 perhaps surprising that shedding is not also female-biased. This could be due to 502 .

We might therefore see sex-differences in shedding during the later 504 stages of infection. 505",

            "text": "; Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005; Paull 36 et al., 2011). Such heterogeneity is so common that it has been generalised into the 37 '20-80 rule' because of the frequent observation that 20% of hosts contribute to 38 roughly 80% of transmission (Shaw & Dobson, 1995; Wilson et al., 2002; Woolhouse 39 et al., 1997). More extreme forms of heterogeneity can result in very rare 40 'superspreading' individuals capable of causing large outbreaks of infectious 41 disease in human and animal populations (Brooks-Pollock, Roberts, & Keeling, 2014; 42 Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005). A superspreader of particular infamy is Mary Mallon who 43 became known as 'Typhoid Mary' by infecting over 50 people with Salmonella typhi is chiefly determined by physiological and immune mechanisms. Variation in these 92 mechanisms chiefly influence the likelihood of pathogen transmission and the 93 duration of infection (Grassly & Fraser, 2008; VanderWaal & Ezenwa, 2016). Many 94 genetic and environmental sources of variation in physiological immunity have been 95 described (Bou Sleiman et al., 2015; Lazzaro Brian P & Little Tom J, 2009; Ponton et 96 al., 2013) including coinfection (Budischak et al., 2015; Lass Sandra et al., 2013), 97 nutrition (Cornet, Bichet, Larcombe, Faivre, & Sorci, 2014; Vale, Choisy, & Little, 98 2013), and stress (Beldomenico & Begon, 2010; Capitanio et al., 2008). It is relevant 99 to note that most studies have addressed the effects of behavioural, physiological 100 and immune traits on transmission in isolation of one another. However, there is 101 increasing evidence that transmission heterogeneity is often explained by coupled 102 heterogeneities in these traits and how they may covary (Bolzoni, Real, & Leo, 2007; 103 Farrington, Whitaker, Unkel, & Pebody, 2013; White, Forester, & Craft, 2018). To fully 104 understand the sources of heterogeneity in pathogen transmission, it is therefore 105 essential to measure multiple behavioural, physiological, and immune traits in hosts. 106 107 In the present work we aimed to test how common sources of variation between 108 individuals (genetic background, sex and mating status) contribute to individual 109 heterogeneity in pathogen transmission potential. The fruit fly, Drosophila at death (VLAD). Finally, we integrated these measurements alongside previously 121 described data on variation in social aggregation (Siva-Jothy & Vale, 2019) into a 122 composite metric of individual transmission potential, V (Lloyd-Smith et al., 2005; 123 VanderWaal & Ezenwa, 2016). Estimations of individual transmission potential, V, 124 allowed us to assess how genetic and sex-specific variation affects between-125 individual heterogeneity in pathogen transmission.

Virgin females were isolated from males within 7 hours of eclosion. Mated 132 females and males were produced by rearing one female with one male for 24 hours. 133 Mating was confirmed using oviposition within the following 24 hours and these egg's 134 subsequent development.

When combined 395 with social aggregation data, this variation resulted in genetic and sex-specific 396 variation in individual transmission potential, V. While all of these outcomes of 397 infection influence transmission potential, due to many individuals not shedding any 398 virus, virus shedding exerted more influence over V than variation in lifespan following 399 infection and social aggregation. Due to this central role, below we discuss potential 400 explanations for the effect of mating, as well as genetic and sex-specific variation on 401 virus shedding, and link these to genetic and sex-specific variation in V.402 403The effect of host genetic background in generating heterogeneity in transmission 404The genetic variation in virus shedding affected both qualitative and quantitative 405 variation in DCV shedding. As the distributions of neither social aggregation nor 406 lifespan following infection were zero-inflated, variation in virus shedding appears to 407 be a key determinant of qualitative and quantitative variation in V. Differences408 between genetic backgrounds in qualitative shedding was a key determinant of 409 variation in V, as there is no risk of pathogen transmission in the absence of shedding. 410 Among individuals that shed DCV, between-individual heterogeneity in V was 411 achieved through different routes. Some genetic backgrounds, such as males from 412 RAL-818, showed a high proportion of individuals that are likely to spread DCV 413 (Figure 4b), but only to relatively few individuals (Figure 4c). Conversely, other 414 groups, such as females of the RAL-380 genetic backgrounds, showed one of the 415 lowest proportions of individuals able to achieve transmission (Figure 4b), but the 416 individuals that did achieve transmission include outliers with values of V that were background as part of an interaction with host sex, while this interaction has no 422 significant effect on quantitative DCV shedding (Tables 5 & 6). Similar differences are 423 seen in the amount of deviance and variance genetic background explains in models 424 of qualitative and quantitative variation in DCV shedding. Genetic background 425 accounts for only 2.27% of deviance in qualitative DCV shedding whereas it accounts 426 for 9.48% of the variance in quantitative DCV shedding (Figure 5). Genetic variation 427 therefore appears to play an important role in determining shedding and affects 428 qualitative and quantitative shedding in different ways. Similar effects of genetic 429 backgrounds on parasite shedding have been reported in the Ramshorn snail 430 species, Biomphlamaria glabrata, during infection with Schistosoma mansoni. 431 Genetic backgrounds differ in how many parasite eggs they shed and how quickly 432 they start shedding after infection (Tavalire et al., 2016). The differences we see in 433 the proportion of flies shedding DCV may be caused by a similar pattern of variation 434 in individual's delaying virus shedding. Delaying the onset of shedding could be 435 affected by a range of DCV infection symptoms. These include paralysis of muscles 436 in the crop organ of the foregut, abdominal swelling, broad nutritional stress and 437 reduced defecation rate (Chtarbanova et al., 2014). 438 439 Genetic background also appears to play a key role in transmission potential, we 440 detected a significant effect on both qualitative and quantitative variation in V. The 441 amount of deviance and variance explained by genetic background does not hugely 442 differ (2.3% and 4.13%, respectively). However, when part of an interaction with sex, 443 genetic background accounts for 11.4% of the variance in quantitative variation in 444 DCV shedding, whereas this same interaction only accounts for 2.83% of the 445 deviance in qualitative variation in shedding (Figure 5). Alongside other studies, this 446 highlights the potential significance of genetic variation in pathogen shedding to 447 generating transmission heterogeneity. For example, genetic variation in transmission 448 was demonstrated using families of turbot fish (Scophthalmus maximus) which 449 produced outbreaks that differed in how quickly individuals showed symptoms of 450 died (Anacleto et al., 2019). Shedding may underlie this genetic 451 variation in transmission as it was not directly measured and there were no 452 significant differences in infection duration and contact rate (Anacleto et al., 2019). 453 Common garden experiments have revealed shedding dynamics capable of 454 influencing the population-level transmission dynamics of wild populations of the 455 plant, Plantago lanceolata. In controlled laboratory settings, multi-strain coinfection 456 was shown to increase the number of spores released of the fungal pathogen, 457 Podosphaera plantaginis. Measures of natural populations have also demonstrated 458 outbreak severity increases at higher levels of coinfection (Susi, Barr\u00e8s, Vale, & Laine, 459 2015). The relationship between spore shedding and coinfection has also been 460 shown to be affected by host genotype, with genotypes significantly differing in the 461 number of spores released over a number of days post-infection (Susi, Vale, & Laine, 462 2015). Genetic variation in transmission potential has also been demonstrated in 463 the freshwater ciliate, Paramecium caudatum, following Holospora undulata infection 464 (Fellous et al., 2012). The genotype of the first individual to be infected was a key 465 determinant of pathogen transmission as host genotype appears to affect the 466 infectious potential of shed pathogens (Fellous et al., 2012). H. undulata 467 infectiousness increases with host population density, as reduced variation in 468 contact rate makes infectiousness the primary determinant of transmission 469 (Magalon et al., 2010). 470 471 The effect of host sex in generating heterogeneity in transmission 472",

Often these biases link to 482 differences in the selection pressures applied by sexual reproduction (Duneau & Ebert, 483 2012).

Particularly alongside 539 other work in Drosophila that has demonstrated female-specific costs of infection (Kubiak 540 and Tinsley, 2017; Short et al., 2012), this result highlights the importance of mating-541 induced physiological changes to transmission heterogeneity. 542 543 The difference between qualitative and quantitative variation in shedding relates to 544 assumptions we make regarding how often DCV is shed. If DCV is always present in 545 shedding, measures of zero reflect quantities of virus that are below the detection 546 threshold of qPCR. While this could result in infectious individuals evading detection, as 547 oral infection typically requires very high dosage (Gupta et al., 2017; Palmer et al., 2018), 548 low-titre zero-values pose a smaller transmission risk. If DCV is not always shed, within-549 individual variation in when shedding occurs could be central to transmission 550 virus shedding was only measured at a single time point per fly, and we do 552 not know how shedding, and therefore V, may change over time. Within-host, temporal 553 variation in shedding is observed in a range of host-pathogen systems (Chen et al., 554 2013; Matthews et al., 2006; Mideo, Alizon, & Day, 2008). For example, avian hosts 555 tend to shed more parasites during the late afternoon (Brawner III and Hill, 1999; 556 Martinaud et al., 2009). 557 558 By combining measures of virus shedding, lifespan and social aggregation into a simple 559 framework our work demonstrates that genetic and sex-specific variation can affect 560 individual heterogeneity in disease transmission potential. We also show that genetic and 561 sex-specific variation, as well as mating, can produce variation outcomes of infection. 562 Alongside its interaction with sex, genetic background explains 5.41% of qualitative, and 563 15.54% of quantitative, individual variation in transmission potential. While our results do 564 not implicate a particular genetic background, males generally present a greater 565 transmission risk than females. In addition to highlighting high-risk individuals, our results 566 are congruous with the observation that the majority of infected individuals produce very 567 few, if any, secondary cases of infection. Non-infectious individuals are particularly 568 relevant to predicting outbreaks of infectious disease as they obscure high-risk 569 individuals in traditional, population-wide estimations of outbreak risk. Our findings 570 demonstrate the benefit of using a model laboratory system as well established as D. 571 melanogaster to study disease transmission. The number of available protocols and 572 methodologies are central to considering multiple traits central to disease transmission 573 and holistically studying their underlying determinants.",
