Henan Chest Hospital was informed that this patient had been in contact with the diagnosed infected physician on February 14, 2020, and she immediately had chest CT and RT-PCR tests for COVID-19 nucleic acid using nasopharyngeal swabs. Results of RT-PCR testing for C -19 nucleic acid were positive on February 14, 2020 (Day 10), however, chest CT did not demonstrate typical reported signs of COVID-19. The patient subsequently developed intermittent fever to 38\u00b0Celsius on the morning of February 15, 2020, and was transferred to the Sixth People Hospital of Zhengzhou, which is a designated hospital for COVID-19. The patient experienced intermittent chest tightness, nausea and vomiting, and she received treatment with traditional Chinese medicine.

These diffuse irregular small ground-glass opacities with partial 4 consolidation rapidly increased in 4 days in this patient with left lung cancer, which were consistent with inflammation, rather than metastasis. Repeat positive RT-PCR tests for nucleic acid confirmed the diagnosis of COVID-19. White blood cell counts remained elevated, even after the patient's symptoms improved, likely due to obstructive pneumonia caused by the tumor. Chest CT images showed diffuse irregular small ground-glass opacities with partial consolidation in bilateral lungs on Day 10, in addition to the mass in the left lung. The nodular opacities increased in size and number on Day 14, which was not a typically reported COVID-19 feature including ground glass opacity (GGO), crazy-paving pattern, and consolidation(3,4).
