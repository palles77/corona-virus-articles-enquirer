Bioassay guided purification of MA led to the isolation of the limonoid 1-cinnamoyl-3,11-dihydroxymeliacarpin (CDM) that reduces both vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) and HSV-1 multiplication in Vero cells (Alch\u00e9 et al., 2003) . We have found that a late step in VSV and HSV-1 multiplication cycles is hindered by CDM since glycoproteins (g) B, gC and gD of HSV-1, as well as gG of VSV, are confined to the Golgi apparatus when CDM is added after infection (Barquero et al., 2004 (Barquero et al., , 2006 .",

After that, we added 0.01 ml MTT (5 mg/ml in distilled water) to cells in culture medium. After MTT cleavage (2 h at 37 \u2022 C), formazan product was solubilized by the addition of 0.2 ml of ethanol. The absorbance of each well was measured on an Eurogenetics MPR-A 4i microplate reader using a test wavelength of 570 nm and a reference wavelength of 630 nm. Results were expressed as a percentage of absorbance of treated cell cultures with respect to untreated ones.",

The direct anti-HSV-1 activity of CDM achieved when the compound is supplied after infection has already been demonstrated: CDM affects gB, gC and gD glycoprotein exocytic pathway from NHC and Vero cells, confining them to the Golgi complex (Barquero et al., 2006) . Now, we demonstrate that CDM also affects the trafficking of, at least, gD glycoprotein of HSV-1 by exerting an analogous antiviral effect in HCLE cells (Fig. 1B) . Furthermore, the hindrance of HSV-1 multiplication by CDM is responsible for the inhibition of NF-B translocation in corneal cells ( Fig. 2A) .

The significant reduction in IL-6 secretion detected in supernatants from CDM treated-infected epithelial cells and macrophages would be related to the inhibition of NF-B translocation by CDM, as a result of its antiviral activity (Figs. 1, 2 and 3) . On the contrary, the strong increase of TNF-\u2423 secretion in J774A.1 CDMtreated infected cells observed in the absence of NF-B activation (Fig. 3C ) would be exerted through an alternative NF-B cell signaling pathway, such as the activation of distinct mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase cascades (Diao et al., 2005; Zachos et al., 1999) . This possibility might be supported by the fact that CDM enhanced levels of TNF-\u2423 production, decreased IL-6 secretion and did not impede NF-B translocation when J774A.1 cells were induced with LPS rather than infected with HSV-1 (Fig. 4) .",
