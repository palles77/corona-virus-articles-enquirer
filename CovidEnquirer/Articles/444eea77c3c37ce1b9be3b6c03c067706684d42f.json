The term rhinosinusitis has been developed to include the full spectrum of the common cold and Sinusitis is the inflammation or infection of the paranasal sinuses. Each year, there are 20 million cases of acute sinusitis and 31 million cases of chronic sinusitis in the United Sinusitis is categorized as acute or chronic based on the duration of symptoms. In acute sinusitis, symptoms may last up to 4 weeks. In chronic sinusitis, symptoms may persist up to 12 weeks despite optimal medical therapy.% The period of time between 4 and 12 weeks is less well defined. Some authorities classify symptoms for this period as subacute sinusitis. colored nasal discharge, maxillary toothache, poor response to nasal decongestants, and abnormal transillumination were the best predictors of sinusitis. Physical examination usually reveals sinus mucosal edema, postnasal drainage, and sinus tenderness; however, none of these findings are specific to sinusitis. 68 It is often difficult to distinguish viral upper respiratory tract infection and bacterial sinusitis in the first 7 to 10 days of symptomatic illness. Worsening of symptoms after 5 days, persistence of symptoms after 10 days, and severe initial presentation may be more suggestive of bacterial Laboratory studies such as nasal swab cultures are not usually recommended in the evaluation of acute sinusitis.

Supportive therapy such as increased fluid intake and nasal saline sprays to enhance a moist environment are recommended. Decongestants such as topical phenylephrine (Neo-Synephrine) or oxymetazoline (Afrin) can be used to vasoconstrict local blood vessels and decrease edema; however, the use of topical decongestants for more than 3 days is not recommended because this practice can lead to rebound vasodilatation and rhinitis medicamentosa. Systemic decongestants provide symptomatic relief but have side effects such as nervousness, tachycardia, and hypertension.u Other common adjunctive therapies do not have proven efficacy but may be helpful in some patients. These therapies include mucolytics such as guaifenesin, antihistamines, and nasal steroid sprays. The latter two therapies may be helpful for patients with allergy sympt o m~.~~ In mild cases of acute sinusitis, adjunctive therapy may be used alone because at least one third of patients have viral sinusitis. Studies show a good response to placebo and antimicrobial regimens. Furthermore, antibiotics do not affect the duration and relapse rate of acute sinusitis.% If symptoms of sinusitis persist for more than 10 days, the cause is more likely bacterial infection.= Empiric antibiotic therapy should be active against common causative organisms such as S. pneumoniue, H. influenzae, and M . cuturrhulis. The selection of antibiotics also depends on the antibiotic resistance pattern in the community. The rate of penicillin (PCN)-resistant H. inflluenzue infection may reach 40%, whereas the rate of PCN-resistant M. cuturrkulis infection may reach 90%.14, 56 There is an increasing rate of multidrug-resistant S. pr~eumoniue.~~ Even with the increasing PCN resistance of common causative agents, many experts still recommend amoxicillin as first-line therapy for acute sinusitis owing to its narrow spectrum, few side effects, and low cost. Trimethoprim and sulfamethoxazole (TMP-SMX) can be used as first-line therapy for patients with PCN allergy. If the patient does not respond to first-line therapy in 2 to 3 days, the regimen should be changed to cover beta-lactamase-producing H. influenzue or PCN-resistant streptococcus. The recommendations for second-line agents in acute sinusitis are amoxicillin-clavulanate, second-or third-generation cephalosporins (cefuroxime axetil, cefpodoxime proxetil, loracarbef), newer macrolides such as azithromycin and clarithromycin, and fluoroquinolones such as gatifloxacin, moxifloxacin, and levofloxacin. Clindamycin also has activity against PCN-resistant S. pneumoniue. The duration of treatment for acute sinusitis is usually 10 to 14 days.32 These recommendations have been supported by two sets of guidelines for the management of sinus An additional set of guidelines recommended by the Sinus and Allergy Partnership advocates the use of amoxicillin/ clavulanate, cefpodoxime praxetil, and cefuroxime axetil as initial agents and discourages the use of TMP-SMX.\"",

Isoniazid, rifampin, and ethambutol all cross the placenta but have not been shown to cause teratogenic effects. Pyrazinamide is not usually recommended during pregnancy owing to the lack of data regarding its teratogenic effects. Pregnant patients with tuberculosis should be treated for 9 months. Pyridoxine supplementation to prevent neuropathy is also essential in pregnant patients.2 Drugs for tuberculosis are safe in patients who are breastfeeding; however, infants who are also taking these medications should not be breastfed to avoid supratherapeutic concentrations of the drugs.2, 47 Pregnant patients who have a positive PPD skin test without active disease can receive prophylaxis with isoniazid but preferably after the first trimester.",
