The 35S-labeled RNA probes were generated from two plasmids pPSP.FP, and pPSP.FP, containing part of the S gene of TGEV. The procedure was first standardized in cell cultures. The radiolabeled pPSP.FP, probe detected both TGEV and PRCV in virus-inoculated cell cultures, whereas pPSP.FP, probe detected TGEV but not PRCV. The probe was then used to detect TGEV or PRCV in tissues of pigs experimentally infected with TGEV or PRCV or naturally infected with TGEV. Again, the probes detected TGEV in intestines of experimentally and naturally infected pigs and PRCV in the lungs of experimentally infected pigs. TGEV RNA was detected mainly within the enterocytes at the tips of villi and, less often, within some crypt epithelial cells. PRCV was shown to replicate mainly in the bronchiolar epithelial cells and in lesser amount in type II pneumocytes, type I pneumocytes, alveolar macrophages and bronchial epithelial cells, respectively. ISH has potential applications as a diagnostic test for the detection and differentiation of TGEV and PRCV in tissues and in studies to gain a better understanding of the mechanism of pathogenesis of enteric and respiratory coronavirus infections.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are a common cause of enteric and/or respiratory infections in animals and man. Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) of swine is one of the best studied coronaviruses, yet diagnostic methods for its detection are less than ideal and limited information is available on mechanisms of TGEV pathogenesis. TGEV causes transmissible gastroenteritis (TGE) in swine characterized by vomiting, severe diarrhea and high mortality in piglets under 2 weeks of age (Bohl and Pensaert, 1989; Saif and Wesley, 1992) . In recent years, another coronavirus has been identified in swine and has been designated as porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) which is antigenically closely related to the enteropathogenic TGEV. PRCV was first isolated in 1984 from pigs in Belgium (Pensaert et al., 1986) and is now ubiquitous in swine herds in Europe. PRCV has since been isolated from swine in the US (Hill et al., 1989; Vaughn et al., 1994; Paul et al., 1994) . PRCV is different from TGEV in that PRCV has 62 l-68 1 nucleotide deletion in the 5' end of S gene (Rassachaert et al., 1990; Wesley et al., 1990; Britton and Page, 1991; Wesley et al., 1991a; Paul et al., 1992; Sanchez et al., 1992; Laude et al., 1993; Paul et al., 1994; Vaughn et al., 1994; Vaughn et al., 1995) and deletions in open reading frame 3 (Rassachaert et al., 1990; Britton and Page, 1991; Wesley et al., 1991 a) . The S gene of TGEV plays an important role for tissue tropism (Parker et al., 1989; Rassachaert et al., 1990; Laude et al., 1993) . The deletion in S gene of PRCV causes virus to replicate only in the respiratory tissue rather than in both respiratory and intestinal tissues as for TGEV (O'Toole et al., 1989; Cox et al., 1990) . Because PRCV is similar antigenically to TGEV, this creates a diagnostic problem. The most commonly used method for TGEV detection in diagnostic cases is immunofluorescence method on frozen sections of intestines. This technique has many problems as sections or villus enterocytes often wash off the slides during processing. Virus can be isolated in cell cultures, however many virus isolates do not replicate well in cell culture (Vaughn and Paul, 1993) . Other methods have been developed such as dot blot hybridization (Shockley et al., 1987; Paul et al., 1994) slot blot hybridization (Wesley et al., 1991b) , immunofluorescence (Morin et al., 1973; Frederick et al., 1976; Shepherd et al., 1979) . peroxidase-antiperoxidase staining technique (Chu et al., 1982) and recently immunogold silver staining (IGSS) (Larochelle and Mogar, 1993) . All of these techniques have unique advantages and disadvantages and, except for immunohistochemistry, are not suited for detection of virus in tissue sections.",

Both ISH and immunohistological staining methods have the advantages of requiring only an ordinary microscope and providing a permanent record, and they can be used for retrospective studies and have very high sensitivity and specificity. Therefore, collectively they can provide information on the presence of nucleic acid and antigen and can be used for pathogenesis studies. This study was undertaken to evaluate the ISH technique for the detection of TGEV and PRCV in infected cell cultures, to distinguish TGEV-infected cells from PRCV-infected cells, and to detect TGEV and PRCV in formalin-fixed paraffin-embedded sections from pigs infected experimentally or naturally with TGEV.",

A random segment of the small intestines of the five pigs infected naturally with TGEV and the two TGEV negative pigs were placed in 10% neutral buffered formalin. The tissues were processed for 48 h in an automated tissue processor and embedded in paraffin. Sections of 5-pm-thickness were cut and placed on nuclease-free silylated slides (PGC Scientific).

No signal was detected in sections from non-infected animals, RNase A-treated sections from infected animals and sections treated with excess amount of non-labeled RNA probe demonstrating the specificity of the probe. Slides coated with emulsion gel from the infected animals had heavy concentration of silver grains along the mucosal layer, but the sections from non-infected animals did not. There were numerous silver grains over the cytoplasm of the villous enterocytes (Fig. 4B) . A few non-specific silver grains, which were not localized over the cells, were scattered throughout the sections. Viral RNA was detected in some crypt epithelial cells (Fig. 4D) . The histopathologic changes were villous atrophy, blunted and denuded villi and replacement of the columnar cells by flat to cuboidal cells. Or! Ice the technique was standardized on tissues of experimentally infected pigs, we wanted to dc ztermine if it could be used on tissue sections from pigs naturally infected with TGEV.

The autoradiography results from X-ray films of the lung sections of the PRCV-inoculated pigs and non-inoculated control pigs distinctly illustrated the differences between these two groups of sections. X-ray films of the lung sections from PRCV-inoculated pigs showed the dark ring of silver grains along the small airways and dark spots scattered throughout the sections, but the lung sections from non-inoculated pigs had homogeneous pale gray color over the lung sections. The slides from the PRCV-inoculated pigs coated with emulsion gel had heavy concentration of silver grains localized over the epithelial cells of bronchi, bronchioles, type II pneumocytes, type I pneumocytes and alveolar macrophages. The hybridization signals were also found over the necrotic epithelial cells that sloughed into the lumen of the bronchioles, and over the alveolar macrophages in the exudate in the alveoli and bronchioles. The cells that most often had the localization of the silver grains were bronchiolar epithelial cells (Fig. 5) , especially in terminal bronchioles, followed by type II pneumocytes, Fig. 3 .

Small intestinal sections from non-inoculated pig showed only pale gray color but small intestinal sections from TGEV-inoculated pigs showed a dark continuous line along the mucosal surface of the small intestines. alveolar macrophages and type I pneumocytes. Only a few bronchial epithelial cells were shown to have localization of the silver grains.

This test was first standardized in cell cultures. ISH with radiolabeled probes prepared from plasmids pPSP.FP, and pPSP.FP, were highly specific for the detection of TGEV and PRCV in cell culture. The TGEV-infected cells had hybridization signals with radiolabeled RNA probes produced from either of the two plasmids pPSP.FP, and pPSP.FP,. In contrast, the PRCV-infected cells had hybridization signals with radiolabeled RNA probes produced from plasmid pPSP.FP, but not with probes generated from plasmid pPSP.FP,. Non-infected cell cultures did not show hybridization signals with RNA probes generated from plasmid pPSP.FP, or pPSP.FP,. Thus, it was possible to distinguish TGEV-infected cells from PRCV-infected cells by using 35S-RNA probe produced from plasmid pPSP.FP,. This plasmid contained TGEV nucleotides sequences in the S gene that were missing in PRCV (Vaughn et al., 1994) . The results from X-ray films corresponded well with the results from emulsion coated slides. For rapid results, slides from suspicious cases can be exposed to X-ray films after hybridization with appropriate \"'S-RNA probe. For more details or to differentiate the viruses and to study pathologic changes in tissues, slides can be coated with emulsion gel.",
