We did diagnostic RT-PCR and indirect immunofl uorescence. From time of diagnosis, respiratory, faecal, and urine samples were obtained for virus quantifi cation. We constructed a maximum likelihood tree of the fi ve available complete MERS-CoV genomes. Findings A 73-year-old man from Abu Dhabi, United Arab Emirates, was transferred to Klinikum Schwabing on March 19, 2013, on day 11 of illness. He had been diagnosed with multiple myeloma in 2008, and had received several lines of treatment. The patient died on day 18, due to septic shock. MERS-CoV was detected in two samples of bronchoalveolar fl uid. Viral loads were highest in samples from the lower respiratory tract (up to 1\u00b72 \u00d7 10\u2076 copies per mL). Maximum virus concentration in urine samples was 2691 RNA copies per mL on day 13; the virus was not present in the urine after renal failure on day 14. Stool samples obtained on days 12 and 16 contained the virus, with up to 1031 RNA copies per g (close to the lowest detection limit of the assay). One of two oronasal swabs obtained on day 16 were positive, but yielded little viral RNA (5370 copies per mL). No virus was detected in blood. The full virus genome was combined with four other available full genome sequences in a maximum likelihood phylogeny, correlating branch lengths with dates of isolation. The time of the common ancestor was halfway through 2011. Addition of novel genome data from an unlinked case treated 6 months previously in Essen, Germany, showed a clustering of viruses derived from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates. Interpretation We have provided the fi rst complete viral load profi le in a case of MERS-CoV infection. MERS-CoV might have shedding patterns that are diff erent from those of severe acute respiratory syndrome and so might need alternative diagnostic approaches.",

Few virological data have become available for MERS-CoV cases, and there is no information about the viral genome sequence, which could identify important epidemiological characteristics. [4] [5] [6] Here, we provide a full description of a fatal case of MERS-CoV infection imported to Munich, Germany, from Abu Dhabi, including a chronological profi le of virus concentrations in diverse body compartments. We fully sequenced the MERS-CoV genome, and therefore could do a chronologically calibrated phylogenetic analysis with all available MERS-CoV genome sequences.

Pre-incubation reactions contained 25 plaque-forming units of MERS-CoV (EMC strain) in 100 \u03bcL of medium, mixed one-to-one with serum samples from the patient prediluted in medium. The starting dilution was a tenth. After 1 h incubation at 37\u00b0C, each well was infected for 1 h at 37\u00b0C with the total 200 \u03bcL pre-incubation reaction. Supernatants were removed and overlaid with Avicell resin as described by Herzog and colleagues. 10 Assays were terminated and stained after 3 days. We defi ned neutralisation titres as the serum dilution reducing the number of plaques in four parallel wells in summary by greater than 90%. Antibodies were tested by immunofl uorescence assay. 7 All clinical materials stored in the ward and laboratories were gathered and submitted for virological diagnostic tests. From the time of laboratory diagnosis, respiratory, faecal, and urine samples were obtained. We designed two diff erent sets of primers generating overlapping amplicons (available on request). The fi rst set consisted of 70 amplicons, 386-800 bp in length, with all primers containing two strong Watson-Crick bps at their 3 ends, so as to bind the template with high affi nity. The second set consisted of 68 amplicons, 415-761 bp in length, with primers that had no more than two strong bps in their fi ve 3 terminal nucleotides and no strong pairings in the two 3 positions. This method of primer design can decrease sensitivity, but it prevents mispriming within the product, which can improve the success of amplifi cation. After RT-PCR, we sequenced all fragments on a Roche 454 Junior instrument (Roche, Penzberg, Germany) and assembled in Geneious (version 6.1.2). Virus quantifi cation was done with standard calibration curves that were based on quantifi ed in-vitro transcribed RNA for the upE target gene. 9 We constructed a maximum likelihood tree of the fi ve available complete MERS-CoV genomes with PhyML 11 and the GTR+Gamma model of molecular evolution; we assessed phylogenetic support with 1000 bootstrap replicates. We inferred a timescale by linear regression of genetic divergence from the root against time of collection of the samples. The root was placed such that the correlation coeffi cient was maximised. A phylogenetic tree based on all available MERS-CoV sequences was calculated with PhyML 11 on a concatenated 4012 bp dataset with the HKY substitution model. Reduction of the dataset was determined by the small number of sequence fragments that could be retrieved from a stored clinical sample containing a small amount of the virus, derived from a patient treated in Essen, Germany.",

He was intubated on day 9 because of progressive hypoxia and acute respiratory distress syndrome (fraction of inspired oxygen 60%; positive end-expiratory pressure 10 cm H 2 O). The patient had received intensive antimicrobial treatment with meropenem, levofl oxacin, vancomycin, caspofungin, aciclovir, and oseltamivir during his stay in an intensive care unit in Abu Dhabi, without major improvement in his pulmonary function.

This sample contained low concentrations of RNA, so the genome of the virus had not been successfully sequenced previously. 8 After many attempts to recover RT-PCR fragments from the available bronchoalveolar lavage sample, we could sequence 12 fragments, covering 4012 nucleotides of the MERS-CoV genome (GenBank accession number KC875821). A concatenated alignment of homologous sequence portions of all available MERS-CoV sequences was subjected to phylogenetic analyses, confi rming a clustering of sequences from Qatar and the United Arab Emirates (fi gure 3).

Without quantitative laboratory data from well documented cases of MERS-CoV infection, most considerations had been made on the basis of an assumed analogy to severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). 12, [18] [19] [20] However, elementary traits of the virus, such as its receptor usage and sensitivity to type I and type III interferon, diff er substantially from that of the SARS coronavirus, suggesting that diff erences in disease patterns (eg, in organ tropism or in virus shedding) might exist. [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] We focused on these aspects with quantitative virus testing in all relevant body compartments, including viral loads in non-respiratory samples. 5, 12 However, our patient-like most other cases anecdotally reported so far-had an underlying disease that could aff ect virus shedding patterns. Only analysis of a large number of patients can yield general fi gures about qualitative virus data. Faecal shedding was of particular interest, because patients with SARS regularly showed high virus concentrations and prolonged virus excretion in stools that led to the use of stool samples, even for routine SARS diagnostic tests. 18, 20, 26 Diarrhoea was reported in two descriptions of MERS-CoV clusters, and it was speculated that faecal virus shedding might have occurred. 5, 12 However, no laboratory data for virus in stool samples were provided. Our patient had low faecal virus concentrations that were close to the lowest detection limit on days 12 and 16 of illness. In the only other description so far, one stool sample from a patient with MERS-CoV had a negative result. 16 Stool samples from many patients, including those with early stages of disease, should be tested to assess whether faecal sources could have a role in transmission, or whether MERS-CoV diff ers from SARS in this aspect.",

However, renal failure due to specifi c viral infection or immunopathogenesis is not necessarily indicated, because the patient had received several doses of potentially nephrotoxic antimicrobial agents in a setting of underlying multiple myeloma. Post-mortem examinations are urgently needed to clarify whether kidney failure in MERS-CoV infection is a primary and preventable result of viral infection, or a secondary complication of severe systemic disease. 27, 28 Quantitative virus data are needed to orient diagnostics and hospital infection control measures. The recorded viral load profi le, with highest RNA concentrations in bronchoalveolar lavage and tracheobronchial aspirates, confi rms suggestions made in another report about the preferential use of lower-respiratory-tract samples for virus diagnostic tests. 5 Notably, the reported overall stability of detectable virus RNA in closed suction catheters indicates a straightforward and non-contagious way to collect diagnostic samples even from non-intubated patients. Oronasal swabs should not be preferentially submitted for testing, especially in patients presenting late in their disease course with substantial lower respiratory involvement. 5 Our data for stool, urine, and blood samples suggest a fairly low infection risk during non-respiratory care procedures. The absence of detectable virus in blood matches reports made in an earlier case of MERS-CoV infection. 16 However, Guery and colleagues 5 reported low semi-quantitative virus measurements in the blood of one of their patients. Moreover, initial experimental studies suggested that MERS-CoV infected vascular endothelial cells. 25 However, quantitative data suggest a low risk from general laboratory procedures involving blood.",

Date estimates will probably be refi ned when more sequences become available. Moreover, whether the reported geographical structure represents repeated transfer from a geographically structured viral reservoir population and limiting chains of person-to-person transmission or multiple sustained lineages of human infections is unclear. With only fi ve complete genome sequences available as yet, genetic data are urgently needed to establish the spatial and temporal distribution of cases, estimate the number of independent human chains of transmission, and thus better assess the threat that MERS-CoV poses to world health. Four sequences from a continuing hospital outbreak in Al-Hasa, Saudi Arabia, have now been deposited in GenBank.
