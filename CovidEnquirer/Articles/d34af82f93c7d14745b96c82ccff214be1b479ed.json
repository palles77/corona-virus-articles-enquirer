Basic Yellow 2 (BY2), was investigated using UV radiation in the presence of peroxydisulfate (S 2 O 8 2\u2212 ) in a rectangular photoreactor at experimental condition. S 2 O 8 2\u2212 and UV-light showed negligible effect when they were used independently. Removal efficiency of BY2 was sensitive to the operational parameters such as initial concentrations of S 2 O 8 2\u2212 , BY2, light intensity, flow rate and pH. The conversion ratios of BY2 at the volumetric flow rates of 330, 500 and 650 ml/min were 84%, 79%, 51% in 30 min, respectively. Our results showed that light intensity was a beneficial parameter for dye removal. The results showed that in the presence of S 2 O 8 2\u2212 , the photooxidation quantum yield obtained was higher than direct photolysis quantum yield, suggesting that photodecay of BY2 was dominated by photooxidation. The electrical energy per order (E EO ) values for decolorization of BY2 solution was calculated. Results show that applying a desired peroxydisulfate concentration can reduce the E EO .",

International Agency for Research on Cancer included BY2 among chemicals for which there is sufficient evidence of carcinogenicity in experimental animals due to its bio-transformation to reactive species in target organs of both rats and humans [2] . The conventional methods used in sewage treatment, such as primary and secondary treatment systems, are insufficient in removing of dyeing and finishing agent, for example: adsorption and chemical coagulation processes are two common techniques of wastewater treatment. However, these methods merely transfer dyes from the liquid to the solid phase causing secondary pollution and requiring further treatment. Advanced oxidation processes (AOPs) are alternative techniques of destruction of dyes and many other organics in wastewater and effluents. These processes, generally, involve UV/H 2 O 2 , UV/O 3 or UV/Fenton's reagent for the oxidative degra-dation of contaminants. Semiconductor photocatalysis is another developed AOP, which can be conveniently applied to remove different organic pollutants [3, 4] . However, the potential of alternative AOPs to improve the removal performance is always of interest and the photochemical oxidant, peroxydisulfate, could be a good candidate for such a purpose.",

The peroxydisulfate is normally available as a salt associated with ammonium, sodium, or potassium. Potassium peroxydisulfate (KPS) recently was shown to be an effective disinfectant and/or oxidant for the Norwalk virus, foot and mouth disease and Coronaviridae (causing severe acute respiratory syndromes SARS). It has also been reported to be effective for degrading organics in hazardous wastewaters in acidic or basic media through direct chemical oxidation (DCO), where peroxydisulfate is used as a sacrificial reagent [5, 6] . However, since the reactions of peroxydisulfate are generally slow at normal temperature, the thermal or photochemical activated decomposition of S 2 O 8 2\u2212 ion to S 2 O 8 2\u2212 radical has been proposed as a method of accelerating the process [6] , as summarized in the following reactions: ",

Although Graham et al. [5] recommended APS due to its exceptional solubility; we observed in our screening tests that KPS gave a more rapid removal of BY2 than APS at initial neutral pH. The difference in the removal efficiency is apparently due to the presence of the ammonium ion. The aqueous ammonium can undergo photo-oxidation [10] leading to nitrate and/or nitrite by the available oxidants in the solution, such as, S 2 O 8 2\u2212 and its related intermediates H 2 O 2 or O 2 . Furthermore, the reaction of NH 4 + /NH 3 with UV/S 2 O 8 2\u2212 process are proved to be able to convert it to nitrate under the 254 nm photolysis at a rate constant of 0.25 mg l \u22121 min \u22121 or 4 \u00d7 10 \u22123 mM min \u22121 [11] , thereby making the ammonium a competitor of BY2. In view of this, and the general unsuitability of adding ammonia to waters and wastewaters, APS is not recommended to be used in the UV/S 2 O 8 2\u2212 oxidation process. Fig. 4 shows the decay of BY2 vs. time for experiments carried out with UV radiation only, S 2 O 8 2\u2212 without UV radiation and UV radiation plus S 2 O 8 2\u2212 . There was no observable loss of the color when the irradiation was applied in the absence of S 2 O 8 2\u2212 ; the color removal was not considerable in the absence of UV radiation.

The decay of BY2 was indicated in Fig. 5 . For different S 2 O 8 2\u2212 concentrations that increased from 0.1 to 5 mM, the photooxidative reaction rate constants increased from 0.0042 to 0.0642 min \u22121 , respectively. This is likely because sulfate radicals and hydroxyl radicals are generated simultaneously and improved the photooxidative decolorization of BY2 [5, 7] . Furthermore, when the S 2 O 8 2\u2212 concentration increased beyond 5 mM, the increment of BY2 decay rate slowed down slightly. According to Qiao et al. [12] at higher S 2 O 8 2\u2212 dosages, excessive generation of hydroxyl radicals (Eqs. (1) and (6)) would be recombined to form less reactive H 2 O 2 (Eq. (13)), which is a known quencher of OH \u2022 radical (Eq. (14)). Therefore, the rate increment of BY2 photooxidative decolorization is slightly slowed down at higher S 2 O 8 2\u2212 dosages. However, such a recombination effect of the radical is likely not very effective due to the low steady-state concentrations of the radicals; higher decay rates of BY2 at higher S 2 O 8 2\u2212 dosages are still expected.",

It can be seen that photooxidation efficiency decreased as initial dye concentration is increased at the same concentration of S 2 O 8 2\u2212 . This can be postulated by considering that, the molar extinction coefficient of the dye at = 254 nm is very high, so that a rise in its concentration induces an inner filter effect and hence the solution becomes more and more impermeable to UV radiation [13] .",

Although a high degree of photooxidative decolorization by the UV/S 2 O 8 2\u2212 process was observed, at all tested pH levels, the decolorization performance increased from low to initial neutral pH (pH 6.72) levels but decreased under basic conditions as shown in Fig. 7 . This is likely due to the concentration effect of active radicals in the solution. The BY2 decay increment from acidic to initial neutral pH is known due to the increase of OH \u2212 , which induces a higher generation of OH \u2022 , and therefore the photooxidative decolorization efficiency. However, the decreasing photodecay at pH \u2265 7 can be explained by the following reasons: (a) the instability of H 2 O 2 at high pH level, (b) relatively higher amounts of OH \u2022 and SO 4 \u2022\u2212 were generated catalytically in alkaline conditions, which induced recombination of these two radicals (Eq.

With the advantages of the high reactivity of UV/S 2 O 8 2\u2212 process and the high solubility of peroxydisulfate, it is practically possible to dose the chemical solution at the upstream of wastewater to remove recalcitrant organic compounds effectively.",

Removal efficiency of BY2 was sensitive to the initial concentrations of S 2 O 8 2\u2212 and BY2. Alkaline and acidic pH conditions were found to not significantly effect on the dye photooxidation. The conversion ratios of BY2 at the volumetric flow rates of 330, 500 and 650 ml/min were 84%, 78% and 69% at 1 h, respectively. Our results showed that increasing the light intensity can increase can decolorization efficiency. The electrical energy per order (E EO ) values for decolorization of BY2 solution was calculated. Results show that applying a desired peroxydisulfate concentration can reduce the E EO .",
