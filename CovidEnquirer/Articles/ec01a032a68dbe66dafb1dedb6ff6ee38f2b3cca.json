This study aimed to explore the impact of bacterial colonization on the severity of virus-induced wheezing, and accompanying airway inflammation. Nasopharyngeal aspirates (NPAs) from 68 hospitalized children with bronchiolitis and 85 children with recurrent wheezing were obtained. Eleven common respiratory viruses were sought by PCR and/or direct fluorescence assay. Bacteria were isolated from NPAs by routine culture methods. Cell numbers and concentrations of cytokines/chemokines in the NPAs were measured, and nucleated cells were characterized. The frequency of bacterial colonization in children with recurrent wheezing was significantly higher than in children with an initial attack of bronchiolitis. Bacterial colonization accompanying virus infection had no effect on clinical manifestations, duration of hospitalization, concentrations of cytokines/chemokines (except interleukin-10 (IL-10)) or cellularity in the children with bronchiolitis; however, among the children with recurrent wheezing, those who had coexistent non-invasive bacterial colonization and virus infection presented more frequent cyanosis, longer duration of hospitalization, a higher concentration of IL-10 and a higher percentage of neutrophils in NPAs than those with virus infection but without bacterial colonization. Bacterial colonization was common in children with virus-induced wheezing, particularly in the situation of recurrent wheezing. To some extent, bacterial colonization accompanying virus infection may contribute to the severity of the wheezing because of its impact on airway inflammation.",

A previous investigation showed that acute viral wheezing in children was often associated with bacterial upper respiratory tract infections, such as otitis media and sinusitis, but blood leukocyte counts and C-reactive protein (CRP) levels were generally not raised. [2] . It has also been suggested that, in synergy with respiratory viral infection, bacterial colonization may contribute to respiratory inflammation. Bisgard et al. [3] reported that neonates who had S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae or M. catarrhalis, or a combination of these organisms, colonizing the hypopharyngeal region were at increased risk of recurrent wheezing and asthma early in life [4] . This result might indicate that such bacterial colonization in neonates is not a neutral matter but plays a critical role in infantile wheezing.",

In one investigation of monthly nasopharyngeal cultures taken from healthy infants from the time of birth, 78% were found to have bacterial colonization during the first 2 years of life [15] . The clinical significance of bacterial colonization has been disputed in the various reports. It is widely accepted that viral infections [19] and bacterial upper respiratory tract infections [20] can exacerbate symptoms of asthma. However, observations in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients have suggested that isolation of bacteria from sputum during exacerbations represents chronic colonization, which is an innocent bystander role for the bacteria [21] [22] [23] . In most cases, colonization persists for weeks to months without symptoms [24, 25] , but the bacteria may spread contiguously to produce local respiratory tract disease. Even during colonization, bacteria in these airways are in a constant state of turnover, releasing extracellular products, and undergoing lysis with release of a variety of proteins, lipo-oligosaccharides and peptidoglycans [26] . Bacterial products in the airways may be potent stimuli for neutrophil migration thither, and elastase released from these neutrophils can act synergistically with bacterial products and cause further inhibition of tracheobronchial ciliary function.",

In the children with bronchiolitis, although concentrations of IL-10 were different in the two groups of children, all clinical manifestations and duration of hospitalization were similar. The predominant cells in the airway in RSV bronchiolitis are neutrophils. Activation of innate immunity against the virus by the promotion of proinflammatory mediators, such as IL-6, IL-10 and monocyte chemoattractant protein-1, and cytokines such as IL-6 and interleukin-8, correlates with disease severity [27] [28] [29] . A previous study indicated that bacterial colonization did not add specific symptoms to the clinical signs already present in RSV bronchiolitis, except that, in patients with severe disease, those with bacterial colonization required ventilation for a longer period [30] . Our data indicate that coexisting non-invasive bacterial colonization has little impact on the severity of an attack of virus-induced bronchiolitis.",

Moreover, the concentration of IL-10 and percentage of neutrophils were similarly found to differ between these two groups. Previous studies have demonstrated increased numbers of macrophages and neutrophils in bronchoalveolar lavage from young children with severe recurrent wheezing [31] . The concentration of IL-10 was found to be four times that of CXCL-8 and 140 times that of CCL-3 in the airways of infants with severe wheezing disease. IL-10 acts to recruit monocytes into the lung to help the phagocytosis of apoptotic neutrophils [32] .
