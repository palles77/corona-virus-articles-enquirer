Ideally, laboratory evolution experiments could be used to accelerate our understanding of how viruses expand their host range. However, it is not clear whether viral evolution observed under the chemical and physical environments of a laboratory can faithfully inform us about viral evolution in nature, for at least two reasons. First, evolutionary trajectories might be sensitive to differences in environmental conditions between the laboratory and nature.

The evolved gain-of-function phenotype in l\uf06c, OmpF + , involves multiple non-synonymous mutations in the host-recognition gene J. Each OmpF + isolate had between 4 and 10 single nucleotide substitutions in J, and none had insertions or deletions (indels). 97% of the substitutions in 24 independently evolved OmpF + l\uf06c phage occurred in the J protein 3 between residues 960-1132, which we call the 'specificity region' of J ( Figure 1A ).",

In this study, we directly tested this hypothesis by using Multiplexed Automated Genome Engineering (MAGE) 15 to construct two combinatorial genetic libraries of the J mutations that evolved in Meyer et al.

All strains possessed the target mutation at residue 1012 and both target mutations at residue 1107; by contrast, some strains lacked a fourth mutation between residues 990 and 1000 ( Figure 1 ).

Mathematical theory has demonstrated that receptor-use evolution should lead to diversification since accessing new host types alters the phages' ecological niches 19 . Indeed, diversification was observed in a related experiment where l\uf06c evolved to exploit two host cell types with different receptors 20 . To test whether indels at 1012 and 1107 cause diversification, we compared the branches where indels occur versus all others. If the indels cause ecological differentiation, then they should reduce intraspecific competition for hosts and facilitate the long-term maintenance of distinct evolutionary lineages.

Based on the patterns of J sequence variation observed, we suggest that host-range evolution is common in this group of viruses, and perhaps others too. While the frequency of host-range evolution may be unsettling, our work also demonstrates potential methods to combat host shifts. In particular, worrisome mutations can be identified with functional genetic experiments as described here or with other laboratory techniques such as deep mutational scanning 23 . This information can be combined with genomic surveillance efforts underway 24,25 to devise more effective disease management strategies to eradicate problematic strains.",
