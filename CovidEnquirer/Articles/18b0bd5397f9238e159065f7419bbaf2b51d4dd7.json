Mortality from respiratory virus infections in healthy individuals in developed countries is rare; however, in less developed countries childhood mortality can be quite high with an estimated 5 million children globally under 5 years dying annually from respiratory virus infections. Their worldwide occurrence results in people of all ages being susceptible to respiratory virus infections. However, on average, children are infected two to three times more frequently than adults, with acute respiratory virus infections being the most common infections experienced by healthy children and often resulting in loss of school time and a significant socioeconomic cost in medical visits, medications and parents' loss of work time.",

Other than open lung biopsies all other specimens are contaminated with commensal respiratory flora. Dacron or polyester swabs collected from the respiratory tract should be placed into viral transport medium containing antibiotics. The specimens should be kept cool at 2-8 8C or on wet ice until inoculation of the cell cultures to maintain virus infectivity, especially for labile viruses such as RSV. 2 Detection of viruses in cell culture requires considerable expertise and is performed by microscopic examination looking for degenerative morphological changes in the cell monolayer called cytopathic effect (CPE). Not all viruses grow in all cell types so clinical specimens are usually inoculated into several types of cells to provide an environment for the isolation of a suitable range of viruses. The use of a broad range of cell types potentially allows for the isolation of agents which are not expected rather than limiting detection to only a few virus types. This approach will also allow the detection of more than one virus in any given specimen which can occur in up to 5-10% of immunocompetent individuals and more frequently in immunocompromised patients especially with viruses which have latency such as CMV and HSV. Recently, commercially produced co-cultivated cryopreserved cells have become available for the rapid identification of viruses. R-Mix rapid cell culture (Diagnostic Hybrids) is a patented cell monolayer containing a mixture of A549 and mink lung (Mv1Lu) cells. 3 After 24-72 h of culture, using pooled or single fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labelled monoclonal antibodies directed against influenza A and B, RSV, parainfluenza 1-3 and adenoviruses, rapid identification of a respiratory virus infection can be established.",

Decreasing the time until CPE is detectable has been achieved for many viruses by centrifugation of the culture after the sample has been added. As viruses are unable to be centrifuged with conventional centrifuges, the enhanced detection may result from better contact between cells in the specimen and the cell culture thus allowing for earlier and more extensive infection of the cell culture sheet. Furthermore, the detection of viral protein production (antigen detection) before there is evidence of CPE in conventional culture has also decreased the time to identify a virus and thus enhanced clinical utility of viral culture testing. The detection of viral protein production is usually performed using a fluorescent-labelled (e.g. FITC) monoclonal antibody directed against a viral protein. Processing and reading these cultures is labour intensive; however, most common viruses can be detected in 24-48 h. Alternatively enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) detection of viral proteins in cell culture supernatants has also been performed.",

These staining procedures are rapid: samples are batch run and results are usually available within 1-3 h depending on the number of specimens tested. Rapid immunofluorescent (IF) staining methods for the direct detection of viral antigens in respiratory specimens have excellent specificity and very good sensitivity. Most respiratory viruses produce CPE in conventional cell cultures but often this is slow or very minimal in extent. The rapid detection of the respiratory viruses influenza A, influenza B, parainfluenza 1-3 and adenovirus by IF is available in many laboratories and is extremely useful for the detection of these viruses, especially in paediatric patients who shed relatively large amounts of virus and for a longer period than do adults. The performance characteristics of the test depend on the type of specimen, age of the patient, duration of illness, MAb reagent and level of expertise of the laboratory staff. Generally, IF methods for respiratory viruses are a little less sensitive than culture with the exception of RSV. However, the greater sensitivity of RSV IF compared with RSV culture is due to the lability of RSV which is rapidly inactivated in samples that are not kept refrigerated and transported to the laboratory quickly for inoculation into cell cultures within a short period after collection of the specimen. The reported sensitivities of IF detection of respiratory viruses varies but are broadly 90% for RSV, 80% for influenza A and B, 70% for parainfluenza 1-3 and 50% for adenoviruses. 6 MAbs directed against hMPV have been developed and are currently under investigation to establish their clinical utility.",

A significant aim of the manufacturers of these tests is to allow for testing to occur in the consulting physician's office. These techniques have the advantage of decreasing turn-around time for test results and have considerably simplified the technical component, but these tests are not as sensitive or specific as viral culture or direct IF (DIF) for detection of respiratory viruses. The positive predictive value of these assays is usually higher when there is a greater prevalence of disease in the respiratory virus season and the virus in question has been shown to be circulating in the community by viral culture or IF.

Influenza B has only one type of H and N glycoproteins. The occurrence of annual influenza epidemics throughout the world is due to the high rate of antigenic variation from a stepwise mutation of the H and/ or N genes and reflected in variations of the antigenic characteristics of these proteins (and thus escape from immune memory) by the H and N glycoproteins of influenza A and B viruses. This stepwise mutation of H and N results in antigenic drift and the recurrent annual influenza epidemics seen each winter. The virus can infect and produce disease among populations who would otherwise possess immunity from previous infection because their antibodies fail to recognize the new antigenic variation(s).

This has caused a high degree of global concern as spread of avian influenza A strains to humans is usually very uncommon but several hundred human cases of H5NI infection have been identified in countries across the world. 10 The major limitation to this virus causing a pandemic with a huge impact on health and the economy is the failure of the H5N1 influenza A to establish sustained human-to-human transmission. Were this to occur a pandemic would be inevitable. Commonly available routine diagnostic tests in laboratories can differentiate influenza A from influenza B; however, they are unable to identify the subtype. Identification of the strain of influenza can be performed by a variety of methods at reference laboratories if required. 11 Laboratory diagnosis of influenza virus infection by isolation of the virus in cell culture is the 'gold' standard technique. This technique however is slow and does not allow for diagnosis within the time frame for specific treatment. However, virus isolation remains critically important for epidemiological studies, the recognition of specific types of influenza circulating in the community and identification of new types and thus pandemics.

Underlying cardiopulmonary disease such as valvular heart disease or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are well recognized risk factors for increased severity of disease with viral pneumonia.",

While viruses are clearly important and frequent causes of pneumonia in young children, they are less apparent in older children. RSV has been associated with the largest proportion of viral pneumonia in young children, particularly if accompanied by bronchiolitis. 29 PIV 3 and influenza A and B are significant causes of pneumonia in children, especially during periods of epidemic prevalence. 30 Adenoviruses are frequently isolated from children with respiratory disease and are implicated in about 10% of childhood pneumonias. However, their true impact is difficult to access because of the long intermittent asymptomatic respiratory shedding of adenoviruses in children. Adenoviruses have been described as cause of significant outbreaks of viral pneumonia in institutionalized children. Pneumonia is the most frequent serious complication of measles. Rhinoviruses have been associated with community-acquired pneumonia in children despite their apparent temperature sensitivity. Other occasional causes are enteroviruses, HSV and VSV.",
