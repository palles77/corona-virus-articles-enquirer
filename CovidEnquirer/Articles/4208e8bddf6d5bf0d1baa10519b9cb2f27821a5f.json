In this study, we identified and cloned canine STING gene. Full-length STING encodes a 375 amino acid product that shares the highest similarity with feline STING. Highest levels of mRNA of canine STING were detected in the spleen and lungs while the lowest levels in the heart and muscle. Analysis of its cellular localization showed that STING is localizes to the endoplasmic reticulum. STING overexpression induced the IFN response via the IRF3 and NF-\u03baB pathways and up-regulated the expression of ISG15 and viperin. However, knockdown of STING did not inhibit the IFN-\u03b2 response triggered by poly(dA:dT), poly(I:C), or SeV. Finally, overexpression of STING significantly inhibited the replication of canine influenza virus H3N2. Collectively, our findings indicate that STING is involved in the regulation of the IFN-\u03b2 pathway in canine.",

            "text": "The innate immune response is an important defense against invading pathogens. Following infection, nucleic acids from microbes are pattern recognition receptors (PRRs) that subsequently trigger host innate immune responses [1] . Several cytosolic DNA sensors have been found, including cGAS [2] , IFI16 (gamma interferon-inducible protein 16) [3] , DAI (DNA-dependent activator of IFN-regulatory factors) [4] , AIM2 (absent in melanoma 2) and RNA polymerase III [5] . The activation of DNA sensors transmit signals to adaptor proteins and activate signaling cascades that ultimately result in the production and secretion of interferons (IFNs), pro-inflammatory cytokines, and chemokines. Among the adaptor proteins, STING (stimulator of IFN genes), which resides in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) or mitochondria-associated membranes, recruits TANK-binding kinase 1 (TBK1) and IRF3, and leads to the phosphorylation of IRF3 by TBK1 [6] . STING is also involved in modulating innate immune responses against RNA virus infections [7] . Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), influenza A virus, Sendai virus (SeV), and vesicular stomatitis virus trigger STING signaling dependently and independently of DNA detection [8] . Additionally, STING may be associated with autoimmune diseases, lipid metabolism [8] , and tumor development [9] . Upon infection with a DNA virus or retrovirus, cGAS recognizes cytosolic viral DNA and causes the production of type-I IFN and the expression of interferon stimulated genes (ISGs) [10] . However, some viruses have evolved the ability to inhibit the function of STING and evade the host antiviral defenses. Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (KSHV) encodes viral interferon regulatory factor 1 (vIRF1) that blocks STING by preventing its interaction with TANK binding kinase 1 (TBK1), thereby inhibiting STING's phosphorylation, resulting in an inhibition of the DNA sensing pathway [11] . HSV-1 UL46 protein binds to STING and blocks the interferon response triggered by 2\u2032 3' -cGAMP [12] . Human T lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) Tax and HBV polymerase reduce the K63linked ubiquitination of STING and interfere with the interactions between STING and TBK1, which may promote the persistent infections [13, 14] . Except that some DNA viruses can regulate the cGAS-STING pathway, a recent study reported that enveloped RNA viruses, including influenza virus (IAV), are able to stimulate a cGAS-independent STING pathway, and IAV antagonizes the pathway through its conserved hemagglutinin fusion peptide (FP) interacting with STING [15] .",

As shown in Fig. 2H and I, expression of canine STING led to a significant induction of the ISRE promoter on the MDCK cells and 293T cells. Moreover, expression of STING increased the mRNA levels of ISG15 and viperin (Fig. 2J) , indicating that canine STING can activate JAK/STAT1 pathway.

To further understand the role of canine STING in innate immune responses, we analyzed the effect of decreased STING expression on the IFN response in MDCK cells using RNAi.

STING is an important signaling adaptor in the activation of type I IFN responses during infection with DNA and RNA viruses and bacteria.
