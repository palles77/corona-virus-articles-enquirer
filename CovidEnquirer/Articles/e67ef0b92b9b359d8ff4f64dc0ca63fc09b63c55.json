The internal consistency, construct validity, and criteria validity of the instrument were examined. Principal component analysis followed by an oblique rotation was used to derive a three-factor solution. These factors were labeled intrusion, hyperarousal, and avoidance; all three factors together accounted for 58.1% of the variance. The total Cronbach's alpha of 0.94 reflected the good internal consistency of the instrument. With reference to diagnosis of posttraumatic stress disorder, the IES-R cutoff point for posttraumatic stress disorder was 19 of 20 with a sensitivity of 85.7% and specificity of 84.1%. In conclusion, the IES-R can be used as a reliable and valid instrument when evaluating psychological distress among adolescents who have experienced a natural disaster, such as flooding and mudslides.",

The result was catastrophic damage in southern Taiwan, which left more than 700 people dead and caused roughly $3.3 billion USD in damages. Most of deaths in this disaster were as a result of terrifying mudslides, and nearly all of the inhabitants living in the affected mountainous areas experienced the threat of mudslides. Typhoon Morakot and the associated floods and mudslides had a great psychological impact on these inhabitants (http://en.wikipedia. org/wiki/Typhoon_Morakot).",

Epidemiological studies for PTSD in Taiwan have shown higher prevalence of PTSD among the people experiencing the earthquake disasters and infection outbreak [1, 2] , including adolescents [3, 4] . PTSD symptomatology in adolescents resembles that in adults but also includes some aspects of the childhood presentation with modifications [5] . Adolescents might present more frequently with repetitive and intrusive thoughts and flashbacks, sleep disturbance, anger, separation anxiety, and cognitive problems [6] . Therefore, it is not always suitable to detect PTSD in adolescents using an instrument that has not been specifically validated for adolescents.",

The latter three instruments were self-administered with similar numbers of items. Each of these assessment tools have their own merits. As our study team has used IES to screen stress reaction among the hospital adult workers during the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak [2] , we would like to examine its use for the adolescents in the natural disaster. IES was developed by Horowitz et al. [10] as a measure of psychological stress reactions after trauma. IES is a short, easily administered, self-report questionnaire of 15 questions. It has been widely adopted and used in related research for more than 30 years. The revised version of the IES (IES-R) contains seven additional items related to the hyperarousal symptoms of PTSD [11] . The IES-R has been used to measure mental reactions in response to stressors, such as injury [12, 13] and illness [14, 15] . Despite its wide use, this tool has not been specifically and formerly validated for posttraumatic responses to natural disaster among adolescents or children.",

They had been separated from their families and allocated to three boarding areas where they could continue to receive formal education in a group setting. Most of them were living in group dormitories and visits involving family members were only possible at weekends. The Institutional Review Board of Kaohsiung Medical University approved the study, which allowed the use of passive consent from the parents of 277 displaced adolescents. Before conducting the study, we prepared a leaflet explaining the purpose and procedure of this study. Students were told to take the leaflet with them at a weekend for their parents or main caretakers to inspect. If parents disagreed about taking part in the study, they could tell their children to refuse to participate. Written informed consent was also obtained from each student themselves before the study started.",

As the latter article explained, difference in validation of IES-R may come from different clinical samples and age groups studied. Similarities in the IES-R factor structure when the present study and the original study are compared imply that the same psychological distress psychopathologies occurred with the present flooding stressor. Compared with the original factor analysis [20] , four items in our study did not load on their originally proposed factors. These were Item 2 (I had trouble staying asleep) and Item 16 (I had waves of strong feelings about it), which was reclassified as hyperarousal rather than intrusion; Item 14 (I found myself acting or feeling like I was back at that time), which was reclassified as intrusion rather than hyperarousal; and Item 21 (I felt watchful and on guard) from hyperarousal to avoidance. These inconsistencies at item level may be attributed to differences in the presentation of PTSD between adolescents and adults. In addition, it may also reflect that these items are more ambiguous because they each incorporated aspects of all three factors. In these circumstances, it is not unexpected that these loading may not occur consistently on the same factor during a different study.",

In addition to PTSD, three other distinct types of posttraumatic response, namely depression, anxiety disorders, and behavioral disorders, have been proposed [21] . It was possible that those with anxiety disorder but not PTSD also show up with higher IES-R scores. Previous studies have found that anxiety disorder may include social phobia, agoraphobia, and separation anxiety disorder [22, 23] . Our findings seem to suggest that, in addition to the IES-R's use as a screening tool, other anxiety symptomatology assessment tools are needed for adolescents in these circumstances.

Resilience can help some people to return to a normal mental state from an acute stress reaction quickly, whereas others suffer from persistent mental dysfunction. They are the candidates for additional mental help during the reconstruction or rehabilitative stage after a disaster. In this context, we suggest that the IES-R needs to be testified for identifying this group to provide a higher range of application.

It has been used previously among early adolescents in Taiwan [18]. Because of time limitations and specific purpose of this study, only the PTSD module of the M.I.N.I.-Kid was used for the interview. Fifteen psychiatric staff, made up of two senior board-certified child psychiatrists, five psychiatrists, five clinical psychologists, and three psychiatric nurses participated as interviewers. All of them had many years of clinical experience in both adolescent and adult psychiatry. Before conducting the diagnostic interviews with the adolescents who had experienced Typhoon Morakot, all interviewers received comprehensive training in the use of the M.I.N.I.-Kid. First, all interviewers attended a workshop on the M.I.N.I. held by the Taiwanese Society of Psychiatry. The workshop introduced the M.I.N.I.'s concept, its content, and the principle of use; it also included a video-recorded case interview using the M.I.N.I. that allowed the attendees to rate a diagnosis. Second, two senior board-certified child psychiatrists (P. Y. and C. F. Y.) delivered a seminar to the other interviewers to introduce the M.I.N.I.-Kid modules. Third, each interviewer conducted a diagnostic interview with an adolescent using the PTSD module of the M.I.N.I.-Kid under the supervision of a child psychiatrist (C. F. Y.)",
