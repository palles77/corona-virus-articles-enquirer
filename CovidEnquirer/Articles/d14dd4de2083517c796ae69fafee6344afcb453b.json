            "text": "Respiratory viruses including; influenza virus types A and B (Flu A/B), respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinovirus (RV), adenovirus (AdV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human coronavirus (hCoV), human bocavirus (hBoV) and human parainfluenza viruses type 1, 2 and 3 (hPIV1-3), have been singly or jointly detected from patients suffering from respiratory diseases [2] [3] [4] [5] . Incidence studies have indicated that 15-38% of respiratory infections develop into acute lower respiratory infections (ARIs) with severe signs and symptoms including wheezing, bronchiolitis, croup, high fever and pneumonia with subsequent increases in hospitalization to a general ward (GW), admission to intensive care unit (ICU), or mortality [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Introduction: There are suggestions that virus co-infections may influence the clinical outcome of respiratory virus illness. We performed a systematic review of the literature to summarise the evidence. Methods: MEDLINE, EMBASE, Ovid and WEB of Science databases, major organisation websites and reference lists of published studies were searched. The quality of studies was assessed using the STROBE tool (von Elm et al., 1) Individual study data was analyzed using odds ratios and 95% confidence intervals as a measure of association between exposure (co-infection), patient outcome and results summarised using forest plots and tables Results: Nineteen (19) studies from all over the world were identified and included in the review. Most of the studies 73.7% (14/19 ) recruited children 6 years old. Evidence on the role of co-infection in increasing disease severity was inconclusive. In five out of eight studies, co-infection significantly increased risk of admission to general ward (OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.3 -4.4, p = 0.005; OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.1 -7.7, P = 0.04; OR: 3.1, 95% CI: 2.0 -5.1, p = <0.001; OR: 2.4, 95% CI: 1.7-3.4, p = <0.0001 and OR: 2.3, 95% CI: 1.1 -5.1, p = 0.34), one found it did not (OR: 0.59, 95% CI: 0.4 -0.9, p = 0.02) and the other 2 had insignificant results. Similarly on risk of admission to ICU, some studies found that co-infection significantly increased risk of admission to ICU (OR: 2.9, 95% CI: 1.4 -5.9, p = 0.004 and OR: 3.0, 95% CI: 1.7 -5.6, p = <0.0001), whereas others did not (OR: 0.18, 95% CI: 0.05 -0.75, p = 0.02 and OR: 0.3, 95% CI: 0.2 -0.6, p = <0.0001). There was no evidence for or against respiratory virus co-infections and risk of bronchiolitis or pneumonia. Conclusion: The influence of co-infections on severe viral respiratory disease is still unclear. The observed conflict in outcomes could be because they were conducted in different seasons and covered different years and periods. It could also be due to bias towards the null, especially in studies where only crude analysis was conducted. Future studies should employ stratified analysis.",

Some viral co-infections of low severity influence the estimates of coinfection patterns, this resulted in bias of severe illness towards the null, when crude analysis is applied. Infact it could also be possible that the variations in Cilla et al., [21] and Venter et al., [29] and also between Martin et al., [20] and Drews et al., [25] were also partly due to bias towards the null.

However all the 3 studies used RT-PCR for identification of viruses. The difference in their findings could therefore be either because of the variability in the number and types of viruses they investigated, or due to the age differences of recruited patients. Boivin et al., [23] recruited patients infected with Flu A/B, RSV A/B, AdV, hMPV and PIV1-4, to which Singleton et al., [28] and Do et al., [31] also included hCoV.

There is insufficient evidence in support of an association or lack of association between influenza A virus and other respiratory viruses' co-infection and severity of disease outcome. Thus whilst Boivin et al., [23] reported a statistically significant association between co-infection and increased risk of bronchiolitis (OR: 4.69, 95% CI: 1.38 -15.95, p = 0.01), Singleton et al., [28] found it was protective (OR: 0.43, 95% CI: 0.18 -0.99, p = 0.05) despite the two studies having recruited children < 3 years old and used RT-PCR for virus identification. On the other hand, Camargo et al., [35] and Singleton et al., [28] found that co-infection was actually protective against admission to ICU, however this was also not statistically significant. There is therefore a need for a larger well designed study investigating the impact of co-infection on the outcome of influenza disease.",

The crude analysis adopted by many authors could have introduced bias towards the null i.e. some viral co-infections of low severity influenced the estimates of co-infection patterns towards the null when crude analysis was applied. Future studies should employ stratified analysis on the effect of co-infections on disease outcome where effects of specific pairs of viruses e.g. Flu A/RSV, RSV/hMPV or RSV/AdV are investigated so as to elucidate the type of virus pairs which increase or decrease disease severity. The variations could also be because of the differences in the co-infection patterns because of the differences in types of viruses that circulated in different seasons and years the different studies were conducted; Influenza A viruses, RSV, hMPV and AdV follow seasonal patterns, with higher virus activity in winters and minimal activity in summers, RV circulate all year round whereas hPIV1-4 are predominantly in summer, and the studies included here spanned over different time periods.",

In this review, only studies that used RT-PCR, PCR were included. If there is any yet unknown systematic error due to application of RT-PCR or PCR, then the effect would be carried over into the results of our study. However, at the present time, PCR remains the gold standard for diagnosis, as some of the respiratory viruses cannot be cultured in laboratories; hence we believe that the results summarized here closely resemble the epidemiological situation.",

            "text": "Literature has suggested that virus-virus interactions may influence host immune response in driving other respiratory viruses' virulence or a virulence. Respiratory virus proteins are detected by host cell tall like receptors; TL2, TLR4 and TLR6; TLR3 TLR7, TLR8 and TLR9 and by the protein kinase RNA -activated (PKR), the melanoma differentiation associated gene 5 (MAD-5), the retinoic inducible gene I (RIG-I) and the 2',5'-Oligoadenylate synthetase (2',5'-OAS1&2) which in turn triggers host production of cytokines including; tumour necrosis factor (TNF), type 1 proinflammatory cytokines; interferon-alpha (IFN-a), and interferon-beta (IFN-b), interleukin-6 (IL-6), interleukin-18 (IL-18) [11, 45, 46] , which counteract virus infection. Depending on the type of virus, infection may lead to cytokine storm resulting into severe disease characterised by organ failure. Casalegno et al., [46] and other researcher [47, 48] suggested that rhinoviruses interfered with circulation of other viruses, and some studies [15, 18] indicated that co-infections with rhinoviruses resulted in low risk. However the precise mechanisms in co-infections that may affect virulence are not well understood and more research is needed to understand the biomedical processes in respiratory virus co-infections and the co-infection patterns that may increase or decrease virulence.",

It is possible that patients could have presented with different signs and symptoms. The use of proxies for measuring disease severity e.g. hospitalisation or death, other than signs and symptoms, could avoid these problems. It is possible that some of the co-infections indicated by different studies were nosocomial infections, however, in all the included studies, ascertainment of disease status was performed during the time of hospitalisation or during the first consultation, ruling out the possibility of nosocomial infections. Also the possibilities of publication and study selection bias should be born in mind. Conversely, we employed a standard search strategy, making sure that we are able to capture all the possible studies covering the subject under study. The search was performed on MEDLINE, EMBASE and WEB of Science, databases which summarise publication in a wide variety of medical journals. We also manually searched studies of good quality to include in the review and in this way hope to have eliminated any study selection or publication bias.",
