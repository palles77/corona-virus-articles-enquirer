SLAM suppression was assessed using real-time PCR and flow cytometry to confirm suppression at the m-RNA and protein levels, respectively. Three chemically synthesized siRNAs were transfected individually using oligofectamine into B95a cell line. This resulted in SLAM suppression from 48 to 454-folds, in comparison to the untransfected B95a cell line. When the SLAM suppressed B95a cell line was infected with PPRV, replication was reduced by 12-143-folds and virus titre was reduced from log 10 1.09 to 2.28. siRNA 3 showed the most potent inhibition of SLAM expression both at m-RNA and protein levels. This also caused the maximum reduction of virus replication and virus titre. A 100-fold reduction in PPRV titres was seen in anti-SLAM antibody neutralized B95a cell line. This further confirms that SLAM is one of the (co) receptors for PPRV. However, the presence of other putative virus receptor(s) is/are not ruled out.",

At least three independent samples were tested on each occasion. The Ct values indicate the difference in the Ct values between the target gene and the endogenous gene. The Ct value indicates the difference between the Ct of sample and the Ct of calibrator. The calibrator has been chosen as the SLAM expression in untransfected B95a cell line. The folds change in the gene expression is calculated as 2 \u2212 Ct. Correlation coefficients were calculated between these folds changes using MS Excel package.",

Appropriate controls treated with irrelevant antibody (against a poultry virus, infectious bronchitis virus, available at the Department of Animal Biotechnology, Madras Veterinary College, Chennai) were also included. After 24 and 48 h of incubation, the CPE was observed between antibody neutralized and unneutralized cells. The presence of PPRV in the wells was also confirmed using the haemagglutination assay with chicken red blood cells (Dhinakar Raj et al., 2000) for calculation of virus titres.

Since this study involved identification of receptor for virus, it was essential that virus infection be done at the time when potential virus receptor expression was highly suppressed. This only would ensure that virus would be inhibited during its entry in to the susceptible cells. In studies that involve suppression of viral gene it is possible that siRNA and virus are given together and in some cases after few hours interval, so that the siRNA can directly inhibit virus replication (and not its entry) (Hu et al., 2002; Mohapatra et al., 2005; Li and Ding, 2001) . siRNA transfected B95a cells that had lowered levels of SLAM expression were used for PPRV infection. If SLAM was the receptor required for PPRV virus entry, virus should replicate at lowered levels in the SLAM suppressed cells. This effect was seen as delayed CPE and decreased virus titre and virus replication assessed by realtime PCR. However, virus replication was not completely inhibited by siRNA. Thus it seems likely that SLAM was used as a receptor of PPRV and when SLAM levels were suppressed, virus entry was reduced, virus CPE delayed and virus replication and titres were lowered.",

Similarly, although the decrease in PPRV M gene and SLAM expression was also highly correlated (correlation coefficient of 0.941), the magnitude of decrease was more in the case of SLAM rather than in PPRV M gene expression or virus titres. This could be probably because SLAM is constitutively expressed in B95a cells while PPRV M gene expression could vary based on virus replication status. Decrease in infective virus titre in SLAM suppressed cells ranged from log 10 1.09 to 2.28. This may be due to the fact that SLAM levels, although was reduced, it was not totally abolished. Residual presence of SLAM could have been used by PPRV for its entry. Another possibility could be the possible usage of other receptors by PPRV. In case of MV, in addition to SLAM or CD150, CD46 has also been shown to play an important role in virus entry (Dorig et al., 1993; Naniche et al., 1993) .",
