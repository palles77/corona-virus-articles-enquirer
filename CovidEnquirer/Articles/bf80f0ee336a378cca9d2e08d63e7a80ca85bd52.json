In mammals, multiple subtypes of interferon-\u2423 (IFN-\u2423) exist, most of which possess antiviral activity. Little is known about giant panda IFN-\u2423 genes and the role they may play in giant panda immunological responses to viruses. We have cloned genes encoding 12 giant panda IFN-\u2423 (AmIFN-\u2423 or AmIFNA) subtypes that share from 90 to 99% amino acid sequence identity. AmIFN-\u242312 has one additional amino acid at position 57, which is not present in other subtypes. Sequence identity of the AmIFN-\u2423 proteins encoded by the 12 genes compared to human IFN-\u24232 is approximately 58%. Unlike most of the human subtypes, each of the 12 giant panda IFN sequences has an N-glycosylation recognition site. Expression of all 12 AmIFN-\u2423 subtypes in 293 cells was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting analysis. The antiviral activity and antiproliferative activity of each AmIFN-\u2423 subtype produced in transiently transfected 293 cell cultures were tested in vitro. All AmIFN-\u2423 subtypes were found to be stable at pH 2 or 65 \u2022 C and to exhibit antiviral activity. Some IFN subtypes (AmIFN-\u24238 and AmIFN-\u24234) showed higher biological activity levels than others, whereas AmIFN-\u242311 exhibited lower activity. AmIFN-\u2423 had various antiproliferative activities to different target cells. To B16 cells, AmIFN-\u24233, AmIFN-\u24234, AmIFN-\u24238 had the highest activities, while to K562 cells, AmIFN-\u24233, AmIFN-\u24237, AmIFN-\u242310 had the highest activities. The various IFN-\u2423 subtypes displayed a good correlation between their antiviral and antiproliferative potencies.",

They are produced as a first line of defense against viral infection by inducing genes, including 2 ,5 -oligoadenylate synthetase (2-5-OAS), RNase L, guanylate binding protein, MxA protein and the dsRNA-dependent protein kinase (PKR) (Samuel, 2001) , which interfere with viral replication and activate natural killer cells. IFNs play an important role in the host antiviral response but are also recognized for their antiproliferative and immunomodulatory activities (Issacs and Lindenman, 1957; Fleischmann et al., 1998; Biron, 1998 Biron, , 2001 . They are encoded by an intronless multigene family, and widely distributed among the vertebrates, and share a same receptor. Multiple genes encod-ing IFN-\u2423 subtypes have been identified in several mammalian species, including human, equine, bovine, canine and murine species (Roberts et al., 1998) . More than 10 different subtypes of IFN-\u2423 have been reported in mice and 15 or more subtypes in humans (Roberts et al., 1997 (Roberts et al., , 1998 Diaz et al., 1994) .",

Except for man's encroachment on the territories of giant panda, diseases are probably the greatest threats. Although effective measures have been carried out to protect giant panda in breeding and reproduction, prevention and control of infectious diseases, especially virus diseases, it is still an arduous and pressing task. Recently, canine distemper virus, canine coronavirus, canine adenovirus, minute virus, parainfluenza virus have been detected in giant panda (Tennant et al., 1993; He et al., 2000; Gao et al., 2003; Qiao et al., 2004) . In China, Xia and He had separated canine distemper virus and coronavirus from liver of giant panda, respectively. Therefore, it is very important to study the immune system of giant panda, especially immune function genes. So we have cloned the genes coding for the IFN-\u2423 and expressed them in eukaryotic cells and tested their biological activities which could be attributable to enhance the survival ability of giant panda.",

After 24 h, cells were washed three times with PBS and stained with methyl violet solution. The cells were then washed with deionized water and allowed to dry. The methyl violet was eluted with 100 ml of methanol and absorbance was measured at 570 nm on a Microplate Reader 3550 (Bio-Rad, USA).

It was found that giant panda IFN-\u2423 has 12 subtypes. The woodchuck IFN-\u2423 proteins are encoded by a multigenic family composed of at least 10 subtypes (Berraondo et al., 2002) . The reason for this redundancy remains unknown. Type I IFNs compete for common binding sites on human cells (Meager, 1998) and are believed to share a common receptor (Kunzi and Rowe, 2001) . However, it seems that the different IFN-\u2423 subtypes, although sharing some activities, have different functional profiles. Within the IFN-\u2423 subfamily, genes are clustered by species, suggesting the possibility that IFN-\u2423 genes have been duplicated independently. In the case of IFN-\u2423, there is evidence that the IFN subfamily may have diversified adaptively in mammals. Existence of so many IFN-\u2423 subtypes raises the question regarding whether there are biological differences among these proteins. Although IFN-\u2423 subtype proteins from the same species are extremely homologous, differences in biological potency are often observed (Ortaldo et al., 1984; Mouchel-Vielh et al., 1992; Foster et al., 1996; Yeow et al., 1998; Baldwin et al., 2004) .

Supernatants from transfected 293 cells were collected and analyzed. We demonstrated antiviral and antiproliferative activities of all AmIFN-\u2423 subtypes, and observed that different subtypes had different activities. As reported for human IFN-\u2423 subtypes, the differences in activities might be concerned with differences in receptor binding affinities (Aguet et al., 1984; Meister et al., 1986; Piehler and Schreiber, 1999; Yamaoka et al., 1999) . Maybe subtle modification in the protein structure accounts for the variation in biological activities. As the activity of mouse IFN-\u2423 (Van Pesch et al., 2004) , our results showed a good correlation between the antiviral and antiproliferative potencies of the IFN subtypes.",
