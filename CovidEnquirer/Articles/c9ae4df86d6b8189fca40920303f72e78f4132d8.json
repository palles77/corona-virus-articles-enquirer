Early detection of public health risks is one of the core functions. In order to improve surveillance and detection, a better understanding of the health system conditions and their influencing factors are needed. The Israeli Ministry of Health/IHR National Focal Point held a workshop to elucidate health system conditions and their influencing factors that enable earlier detection. The workshop methodology employed a stepwise, small working group analysis approach to elucidate the conditions and their influencing factors affecting each stage of recognition, assessment, and reporting of infectious disease outbreaks, at the local, regional and national levels. In order to detect public health risks earlier, the detection process needs to be moved closer to the local communities and start with building capacity within communities. Building capacity and engaging with local and diverse communities requires significant changes in the governance approach and include information sharing, multi-sectoral communication and coordination across various levels before, during and after public health emergencies. Across the regions, low-, mid-and high-income countries seem to struggle more with governance and information sharing rather than with technical capacities and capabilities.",

The IHR aims to protect the world population by encouraging all countries to create and maintain core capacities of detection, assessment, reporting, and management of public health risks, as well as timely sharing of information concerning events that may impact the public health in many countries. [7, 8] Policymakers and healthcare leaders are urged to ensure appropriate allocation of resources to enable the management of public health risks by building capacities to detect events that may constitute a threat to public health, determine if these may impact the international community and enact an appropriate response to contain the event [2, 4, 7] . Yet, recent publications have indicated that less than one third of the global community fully complies with the IHR, emphasizing the crucial need to design mechanisms that can be appropriately and practically implemented by all nations [4] . Health policy makers, navigating complex systems and pressed to make difficult decision within scarce resources setting, need to prioritize resource allocation, implement decision-making mechanisms, and instate governance in building and sustaining preparedness and response measures [11] . There is a need to advance evidence-based insights, a, rational framework and a methodology that can facilitate the process.",

This finding supports previous insights that were voiced by the WHO, advocating the \"One Health\" approach rather than limited cooperation between the human and animal sectors that may result in a lack of formalized information exchange. [21, 22, 11] The aim should be to reach beyond interpersonal or ad-hoc basis, and progress to an institutionalized, concurrent sharing of information and data [23] . Interestingly, this workshop acted as a first forum of this type, offering convivial interactions between professionals from disparate fields, sharing information, understanding each other's challenges and realising that the whole is greater than the sum of its parts.",

[10, 17] Facilitating factors for earlier detection are risk communication activities such as information sharing, communication and collaboration activities. Blocking factors were lack of communication, coordination and leadership. Interestingly, inadequate technical capacity, commonly assumed to be a leading factor impeding early outbreak detection, especially in low-and mid-income settings, was not found to be a leading factor [8, 11, 18] .",

Elements that function effectively in normal times will be more functional and efficient during emergencies. 3 Governance: The local networks require a framework that will allow and facilitate information-sharing and communication between themselves and with higher levels on a routine basis. More efforts should be instated to discriminate between vital signs and signals that should be rapidly reported versus low-risk suspicions that may be examined and reviewed before their relay to a higher level of authority. 4 Networks: Sophisticated technological platforms would seem to be of secondary importance. Rather, efforts should be invested in strengthening intra-and inter-networking on the local level, to enhance information sharing and continued flow of communication, based on available platforms that already exist. Such mechanisms should be identified and leveraged for the purpose of enhancing preparedness to prevent, detecting and managing public health risks.",
