Here, we describe the genetic variation 16 of a partial region of the coronavirus RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), which is one of the 17 most used partial sequence loci for both detection and classification of coronaviruses in molecular 18 epidemiology. We infer Bayesian phylogenies from more than 7000 publicly available coronavirus 19 sequences and examine clade groupings relative to all subgenus holotype sequences. Our 20 phylogenetic analyses are largely coherent with genome-scale analyses based on designated 21 holotype members for each subgenus. Distance measures between sequences form discrete clusters 22 between taxa, offering logical threshold boundaries that can attribute subgenus or indicate 23 sequences that are likely to belong to unclassified subgenera both accurately and robustly.

Thanks to molecular epidemiology 46 studies, we know that SARS, MERS and SARS-CoV-2 had their origins in wild animal reservoir 47 species before spilling over into humans. Indeed, numerous molecular studies have identified a 48 wealth of Coronavirus diversity harboured by equally diverse animal hosts (1-6), and phylogenetic 49 analysis of sequence data from these studies is helping in our understanding of many aspects of 50 disease ecology and evolution (7-9). This includes the role of reservoir hosts in disease maintenance 51 and transmission (3, 4, 6, 10-12), the evolutionary origins of human-infecting coronaviruses (3, 13), 52 the importance of bats as reservoirs of novel coronaviruses (14, 15), the role of intermediate hosts in 53 human disease emergence (3, 11, 16) , and the understanding of risk that might be related to 54 coronavirus diversity and distributions (17, 18 Betacoronaviruses related to MERS Coronavirus). Whole genome data from holotype specimens 72 selected to represent an exhaustive spectrum of coronavirus diversity was used to test the 73 phylogenetic repartition and support for each of these taxa (20). Due to the limited diversity of 74 holotype specimens classified into these subgenera, there is currently no method for attributing 75 subgenus to isolates with divergent sequences, and no proposed method for partial sequence data. 76",

This resulted in the identification of 30,249 sequences. A preliminary set 92 of representative partial RdRp sequences was compiled with reference to recent publications 93 describing Coronavirus diversity across the Orthocoronavirinae subfamily (21), in order to include 94 starting reference sequences from with the largest possible diversity of coronaviruses. This 95 preliminary list was then used to identify partial RdRp sequences from retrieved NCBI records by 96 annotating regions that had at least 70 % identity to any reference sequence in the Geneious 97 software package (version 9.4.1). Annotated regions and 200 bp of flanking sequence data were 98 then extracted. Data containing incomplete sequences in the form of strings of N's or significant 99 numbers of ambiguities (>5) were removed. Open reading frames with a minimum length of 300 bp 100 were identified and extracted from the remaining sequences. In the case where the correct reading 101 frame was ambiguous, pairwise alignment to reference sequence data was used to determine 102 reading frame. Remaining sequences were then aligned in-frame using MAFFT, and the resulting 103 alignment was further curated by visual inspection. Retained sequences were then trimmed to 104 include only the most-frequently sequenced partial region of RdRp and so that each sequence 105 contained a minimum of 300 gap free bases. The final alignment was 387 bp in length with 7,544 106 individual sequences, of which 3,155 were unique.

The one exception, again, was members of the 198 pedacovirus subgenus which displayed overlapping within-taxon distances with between-taxon 199 distances for other Alphacoronavirus subgenera (Figure 4). The distinct pedacovirus clades displayed 200 in Figure 2 were thus treated as separate subgenera for distance threshold calculation. Optimal 201 thresholds were identified as the midpoint of a fitted binomial probability distribution for intra-and 202 inter-subgenus pairwise distances. The optimal identity thresholds for distinguishing same vs. 203 different subgenera were as follows; i) 77.6 % identity, resulting in 99.7 % precision and 95.3 % 204 accuracy of classification for subgenera of the Alphacoronaviruses. ii) 71.7 % identity, resulting in 205 99.9 % precision and 99.6 % accuracy of classification for subgenera of the Betacoronaviruses. iii) 206 package, MyCoV, successfully identified SARS-CoV-2 as a member of the sarbecovirus 210 subgenus, with the closest match being to reference sequence KP876545.11 (Rhinolophus bat 211 coronavirus BtCov/3990), which showed 92.5 % pairwise identity to SARS-CoV-2 in the RdRp 212 region. This sequence had been assigned 100 % posterior support for being attributed to the 213 sarbecovirus subgenus (Figure 5a). Distributions of pairwise identities within members of the 214 subgenera of the Betacoronaviruses fell between 71 % and 100 %, whereas pairwise distances 215between Betacoronavirus subgenera were less than or equal to 71%. Thus, the output of MyCoV 216 allows us to state with certainty that SARS-CoV-2 belongs to this subgenus(Figure 5b). Positioning 217 of the closest match in the phylogenetic tree shows that the SARS-CoV-2 forms a distinct lineage 218 from SARS coronavirus, and that its closest match belonged to a Rhinolophus bat from China (Figure 219",

Consequently, such genomic loci lend themselves to the 231 viral lineages that, in general, demonstrate a level of specificity in their host-235 associations and epidemiological characteristics (Supplementary Figures S1). 236 Our analyses have shown that the phylogenetic interpretation of short sequences of the RdRp locus 237 of members of the Orthocoronaviridae is largely coherent with genome-scale analyses based on 238 designated holotype members for each subgenus. The vast majority of known RdRp sequences (88 239 %) can be classified into the defined subgenera, and their classification cross-validated based on 240 simple distance thresholds established from a 387 bp fragment of RdRp. Globally, these distance 241 measures form discrete clusters between taxa, offering logical threshold boundaries that can 242 attribute subgenus or indicate sequences that are likely to belong to unclassified subgenera both 243 accurately and robustly without the need for complex phylogenetic inference.

Vertical lines show the distribution of cluster-defining height thresholds 361 that were identified to assign subgenus classifications, with the median of all clustering thresholds 362 displayed in bold, lines are coloured by genus as in Figure 1. Monophyletic groups where all 363 members have posterior probabilities of being assigned to a known subgenus of lower than 90% are 364 highlighted and assigned sequential IDs. Phylogenetic subgenus classifications for partial RdRp sequences of Gammacoronaviruses 366 (LEFT) and Deltacoronaviruses (RIGHT). Depicted trees are subtrees of consensus phylogeny 367 presented in Figure 1. Dots on leaf tips indicate sequences belonging to holotype reference 368 sequences for each subgenus. Coloured bars show the proportion of trees from the Bayesian 369 analysis where the corresponding leaf was assigned to each subgenus, which is indicated by colour 370 according to the legend. Vertical lines show the distribution of cluster-defining height thresholds 371 that were identified to assign subgenus classifications, with the median of all clustering thresholds 372 bold, lines are coloured by genus as in Figure 1. In the case of gamma coronaviruses, 373 both subgenera are consistently separated at the root of the tree, thus all cluster defining heights 374 equate to the root. Monophyletic groups where all members have posterior probabilities of being 375 assigned to a known subgenus of lower than 90% are highlighted and assigned sequential IDs. Histograms of genetic distances for intra-and inter-subgenus comparisons. Vertical dashed 377 lines represent the optimal genetic distance cut-offs for the subgenus threshold, calculated as the 378 midpoint of the fitted binomial probability distribution. MyCoV output plots for the analysis of the 2019nCoV. A) Tabular output of best blastn hit 380 of the query sequence to the reference database. The predicted subgenus and genus of the best-381 matching hit are displayed, as well as the posterior support for the assignment to the predicted 382 subgenus (see methods). Pairwise identity between the two sequences is shown and is calculated 383 relative to the maximum possible alignment length against the reference sequences (387 bp). B) For 384 each queried sequence, pairwise identity values are mapped to all observations from pairwise 385 comparisons between sequences in the database. The vertical dashed line represents the pairwise 386 dissimilarity of the queried sequence. C) Phylogenetic positioning and metadata from the analysis of 387 the reference sequences are displayed. Reference sequences with blast-hits matching the queried 388 sequence are highlighted on the leaves, and tips are coloured from red to green with increasing 389 pairwise identity. The hit with the best score is highlighted by a large green diamond on the tip. 390 Pairwise identity scores are displayed for all leaves, as well as predicted subgenus. Host genus 391 associations (blue) and geographical region of origin (red) from available metadata are indicated by 392 binary heatmaps. Note that multiple metadata observations are possible for each leaf, as leaves are 393 displayed for unique sequences only. The ID next to each leaf is that of the representative Comparative analysis of 3155 partial RdRp sequences belonging to members of the Orthocoronavirinae. A) Consensus phylogeny from three 398 independent BEAST analyses. Nodes with posterior support greater than 90 % are highlighted with dots and bars display the 95% HPD of the heights of each 399 node. Colours indicate genus-level classification for sequences, clades and pairwise comparisons throughout. B) Histograms of genetic distances, measured 400 as the proportion of variant sites, between sequences belonging to each genus and grouped by the genus of the queried sequence.
