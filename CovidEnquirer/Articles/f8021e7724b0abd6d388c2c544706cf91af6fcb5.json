Influenza viruses, K. pneumoniae, and S. pneumoniae were the commonest agents of CAP in this region of the world. Viral infections were surprisingly common, either as single or combined etiology. PCR was instrumental in detecting most respiratory viruses. A recent report from Thailand found viruses in 9% of hospitalised adult CAP patients in Northern Thailand 2 and in 25% of adult CAP patients admitted from a pneumonia * for further details, see Table 4 . surveillance in two other provinces. 15 Incidence of influenza A infection was 7.4% in hospitalised CAP 15 and 7% in severe CAP. 5 The use of PCR may, thus, enhance the appropriate use of antimicrobial agents. 16 No other CAP studies in Southeast Asia so far have attempted to diagnose viruses. K. pneumoniae and other GNB were frequently observed in our study, similar to reports from other Southeast Asian countries, 2,3,17 but different from those from Europe, North America, or Australia. 1, 18, 19 The high prevalence of K. pneumoniae and other GNB might, in part, be explained by the common carriage of these bacterial species in the nasopharynx of healthy individuals in the same area. 20 The tropical climate with higher temperature and humidity in Semarang may increase the incidence of GNB infection, as those conditions promote the growth and virulence of GNB. 21, 22 S. pneumoniae infection was detected in only 13% of the patients, mostly by urinary antigen tests. Cultures frequently failed to grow this species, possibly due to the common use of antibiotics in the community, underlining the importance of alternative methods to detect pneumococci, as by PCR 3 or urinary antigen test. 23 However, a positive finding with the latter test should be interpreted carefully particularly in patients with COPD. 23 Previous studies in Southeast Asia reported various numbers for the relative contribution of S. pneumoniae, from 2% 17 through 52% 24 depending on the study population and the laboratory methods, while studies from Europe, North America, and Australia consistently reported it as the most common cause of CAP. 1, 18, 19 Aside from the climate, the differences between the CAP etiology reported in our study and that in previous reports might also relate to differences in patients age, underlying diseases, and radiological type of pneumonia. Our patients were relatively young, had more often cerebrovascular underlying diseases, and had often bronchopneumonia instead of lobar or alveolar pneumonia. The wide spread use of influenza vaccination in other parts of the world may help explain the differences in the incidence of influenza in CAP. Taken together, these differences imply that a guideline of CAP management construed and implemented in Europe, North America, and Australia might not be directly applicable in Indonesia.",

However, even in low risk patients, the mortality in our study was still quite high, not only compared to that in North-America and Europe, but also to other studies from Southeast Asian countries. 2, 5 The high mortality observed in our study suggests problems in the patient care process, which needs further analysis. Determinants of poor outcome may at least in part, include delay in presenting to the hospital, inappropriate initial treatment, limited access to mechanical ventilators, inappropriate antibiotic therapy, underlying diseases, and the severity of the disease on admission (to be published elsewhere). Interestingly, mortality was significantly higher among patients with unknown etiology. This finding may be explained by limitations in acquiring appropriate laboratory samples due to the severity of the disease at the time the patients were admitted. This is rather unfortunate, since these patients are those who need most to be managed based on an established etiology. This finding implies the need to perform all diagnostic procedures early, without delay, especially in patients with severe disease, so that the etiology of CAP in this group is established early, at a time its management can still be optimised.",
