            "text": "pathogenesis are unknown. The most prominent example is multiple sclerosis (MS) which is thought to be associated with an immune pathological process p~sibly acting in concert with a virus infection (Waksman 1981) . It has been shown that an autoimmune reaction against CNS tissue can lead to 6hronic relapsing demyelination as seen in chronic experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) whereas the role of a virus infection in the induction of such a condition has not so far been directly demonstrated (McFarlin et al. 1974; Paine et al. 1978; Lassmann and Wisniewski 1979; Traugott et al. 1982) . It is there.fore desirable to develop animal models of relapsing demyelination associated with a virus infection in order to analyse the mechanisms by which virus-induced neuropathological changes may Occur. Viruses can induce demyelination which is interpreted as either the consequence of cell death in the course of viral replication, or the result of dysfunction in persistendy infected oligodendrogiia cell*, lmmunopathologieal reactions could also play a role in virus-induced demyelination as studies with Theiler's virus infection in mice suggest. Relapsing demyelination associated with a clinical diseac, e as seen in chronic EAE has been postulated in virai infections of the CNS, especially in man, but not studied experimentally. In the following we describe a model in which certain mutants of muri1~e coronavirus JHM cause clinical relapsis of a subacute demyelinating encephalomyelitis (SDE) in rats. After virus infection in rats inflammatory disseminating CNS lesions of marked demyelination develop accompanied by clinical signs of a subacute disease after varying incubation times. A considerable percentage of diseased animals survive and recover from this infection and some come down with a second attack of SDE after a period of weeks to months. Such animals show both, fresh demyelinating lesions with infiltrations, and remyelina~.ed areas in the brain and spinal cord. Infectious JHM viru:, can be reisolated from brain tissue and virus antigens demonstrated in brain cells. These findings demonstrate that a clinically recognizable relapsing CN5 disease can develop in association with exacerbations of demyelination in the. course of a persistent viral infection of brain tissue.",

Of 276 rats infected with different ts-mutants c f JHM virus 57% developed clin~ical signs of SDE within an incubation pe~od of 14-.158 days. 36% of the diseased an~-'lals survived this infection. Among the 56 survivors of SDE, 13 rats continuously exhibited clinical signs of hindleg paresis or paralysis. The remaining ,*3 animals were apparently healthy. 1~ ut 9 of these animals developed z~ second attack of SDE 2-;8 weeks after recovery from the first attack. As documented in Table 1 these animals had developed their first attack of SDE after an incubation period of 14-33 da2/s. Clinical symptoms of this i ~ ~ ' \u2022 first attack lasted from ~ to 25 days until they recovered. In all cases recc,veD' was complete and no disability w~.s noted. These animals came down with a second attack 41-173 days p.i., however, wi~h an averetge incubation time between onset of the first attack of disease and its exacerbation, of 61 days. The clinical picture of the secor, d attack was similar to the first~ except the course seemed to be more severe.",

            "text": "). The mechanisms by which a JHlVi infection leads to SDE with a remitting-relapsing course is unknown at present. Immunological studies caefed out in our ~aboratory at the first attack of SDE demonstrate that lymphocytes are sensitized against myelin basic protein in the course ot JHM infection. Adoptive transfer c f these lymphocytes, restimulated against myelin basic protein in vitro, was accompanied by EAE-iike lesions in CNS tissue as well as clinical symptoms f.Watanabe et al. 1983). These findings suggest that JHM virus infection in b~ain tissue may have a similar effect to Freund's complete adjuvant plus myelin basic protein, or CNS-extracts, in EAE. During replication of JHM virus, an autoimmune re~ction is triggered which may contribute not only to the development of SDE, but also to the observed relapses. In other experimental infections by neurotropi\u00a2 viruses, an ir, dication of the development of a humoral autoimmune reaction to C.~IS tissue has been observed. During replication of a neurotropic vaccinia virus in mice, and in chronic canine distemper virus infections of dogs, antibodies against myelin basic protein and oligo~endrocytes were detected (S~ck e ~",
