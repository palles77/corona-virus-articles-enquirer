Besides a genera1 overview of parasites of carp, swimbladder inflammation, caused by Sphaerospora spp., is discussed in detail. Saprolegnia spp. is the most important fungal pathogen. Aeromonas hydrophila and the atypical Aeromonas salmonicida, as well as Flexibactercolumnaris, are described as the major bacterial pathogens of carp. Spring viraemia of carp caused by Rhabdouirus carpio is presented as the main viral infection of common carp. Details on methods of treatment and prevention are presented together with a description of the given diseases. The role of environmental stress, including \"normal\" culture practice and pollution, in the outbreak of diseases of common carp is discussed. Prospective methods to minimize the risk of diseases as well as their limitations are presented. * Corresponding author. 0044-8486/95/$09.50 0 1995 Elsevier Science B.V.

            "text": "There are divergent opinions on the aetiology of SBI. Certain authors have regarded it as a viral disease (Arshanica, 1969; Ahne, 1973; Bachmann and Ahne, 1973) , while others (Neciporenko et al., 1963; Kanaev et al., 1967; Szakolczai, 1967; Markiewicz, 1966; Mattheis and Kulow, 1967; Kocylowski et al., 1970) have advocated the primary aetiological responsibility of bacteria, because of the isolation of many bacterial strains from carp with SBI. Szakolczai ( 1967) detected bodies reminiscent of unicellular parasites ( Coccidia, Pleistophora) in squash preparations of affected swimbladder and suggested they might be the causal agent of the disease. Kanaev and Kuzmin's ( 1970) report on experimental reproduction of SBI by feeding carp organs containing Myxobolus spores agreed well with Szakolczai's protozoan hypothesis. Otte ( 1966) implied that the blood flagellate Cryptobia cyprini may be responsible for SBI. Molt& ( 1980a) observed during studies on carp renal sphaerosporosis that the latter condition was frequently developed by fish with clinical SBI, and he postulated a relationship between the prevalence of SBI, renal sphaerosporosis and the condition caused by the C-blood protozoan originally described by Csaba (1976) . Waluga and Budzynska (1980) detected the developmental stages of Sphaerospora carassii, the causal agent of gill sphaerosporosis in carp, in visceral blood vessels, but did not pursue the possible identity of these stages with the C-blood protozoan. Indirect proof of a relationship between SBI and renal sphaerosporosis has emerged from Grishcenko's ( 1967) Abbrevations: Geographical range -C = cosmopolitan; As = Asia; E = Europa; NA= North America; SU = former Soviet Union. Gross pathology -dpbc = decaying and puriginaeous branchio-cutaneous; resp = respiratory; so = sensory organs; circ = cicmlatory; vm = viscera-muscular; f = free parasite; c = cystic; dig = digestive.",

            "text": "Since the works of Molmir (1980) , Kovacs-Gayer et al. (1982) , Korting (1982) and Csaba et al. ( 1984) led to the identification of parasites designated as K-protozoa causing swimbladder inflammation in the common carp, with the presporonic developmental stages of the kidney parasite Sphaerospora renicola Dykova and Lom 1982 , a vast amount of knowledge has accumulated on the complex developmental cycle of Sphaerospora-type parasites. It has become known that the early developmental stages described by Csaba ( 1976) and designated as \"C blood protozoa\" by Molnar ( 1980) and as \"UBO\" by Lom et al. ( 1983) consistently appear in the blood of carp before renal sphaerosporosis develops. The works of Lom et al. ( 1985) have revealed that the blood stages can also be demonstrated in the blood of other Sphaerospora-infected cyprinid fishes. Moreover, in the blood of these cyprinids Baska and Molnar (1988) found circulating forms morphologically resembling the K-stages of the common carp. In common carp, the K-stages were earlier detected first of all in the swimbladder wall (Kovacs-Gayer et al., 1982; KSrting, 1982; Csaba et al., 1984; Landsberg, 1986; Odening, 1987) . The possible occurrence of K-stages in other locations has only been suggested by Kbrting (1982) , Kijrting et al. (1984) and the Ter Hofte et al. ( 1984) ) who found the developmental stages in the integument of the head, in the orbit and in hepatic granules of the common carp. Recently, Lom et al. ( 1991) have found Sphaerospora stages resembling K-protozoa in the rete mirabile of non-cyprinid fish (Gasterosteus a&e&s), although they failed to clearly identify these forms with the developmental stages of S. elegans found in the kidney. Molnar (1993) found that S. renicola K-stages, previously considered to be typical swimbladder parasites, are blood stages just like C-parasites; however, they are frequently caught in the capillaries. These stages can also produce lesions in organs other than the swimbladder, and are directly responsible for the exophthalmos regarded as a sign of swimbladder inflammation, as well as for the intraorbital haemorrhages and tissue necrosis. The following detailed information is based on the above literature as well as on the review by Molt-i&r and Szakolczai ( 1992) .",

In the plasma of the primary developmental form, occurring among the tissues, 20-40 secondary forms will develop, and later they will serve as a site for development of 2-2 tertiary forms. After destruction of the primary form the so-called tertiary developmental stages, which include one secondary form and two tertiary forms, through the bloodstream will reach the renal tubules where spores of S. renicola will develop from them. Following the acute phase of SBI the sphaerosporosis will always be developed in the renal tubules. SBI is always preceded by the appearance of so-called Csaba protozoa. These are the earliest developmental stages of S. renicolu; they flow freely in the blood and propagate by endogen gemmation, resulting in 8 daughter cells in each mother cell.",

The zoospores are spherical with two flagella, motile and 10 pm in diameter.",

Because the \"normal\" conditions of a carp-rearing pond are close to these, and Aeromonas hydrophila is a normal inhabitant, carp are constantly exposed to infection. Disease outbreaks are common when carp are under stress from crowding, low oxygen, high temperatures, etc., and significant losses from such outbreaks occur annually. Bullock and Herman ( 1985) lnglis and Hendrie (1993) Clerx (1976) Farkas (1985) Farkas and Oldh ( 1986) Reichenbach-Klinke (1972) Causative agent. A. hydrophila is characterised by active motility, achieved by means of single polar flagellum. It is a Gram-negative bacilli measuring 0.5 X 1.0-l 5 pm. A. hydrophila is aerobic and facultatively anaerobic, fermenting carbohydrates with the formation of acid and producing 3-butanediol. It is cytochrome-oxidase-positive, reduces nitrates, and is resistant to the vibriostat O/129 (Roberts, 1993) . As to extracellular production, A. hydrophila produces haemolysin, cytotoxins and enterotoxins (Boulanger et al., 1977; Wretlind et al., 1971; Donta and Haddow, 1978) as well as gelatinase, caseinase, elastase, lectithinase and desoxyribonuclease (Nord et al., 1975) . The pathogenicity of A. hydrophila often seems to be associated with stressed or compromised hosts. The principal feature of the pathogenesis is generalised dissemination in the form of a bacteraemia, followed by elaboration of toxins, tissue necrosis and bacterial haemorrhagic septicaemia. In most cases the A. hydrophila infection has a secondary character and the disease is associated with primary viral or parasitic infection, with sudden change in environmental or nutritional status, or with husbandry changes. There is some doubt, therefore, as to whether Aeromonas hydrophila should even be considered as a primary pathogen. There is little doubt, however, that once it has invaded a host which has been compromised for whatever reason, it rapidly makes the condition worse and can be responsible for ultimate death. The complexity of the situation makes the diagnosis and treatment difficult. Unless the primary cause has been excluded, treatment of aeromonasis will be of little value in the longer term (Roberts, 1993) .",

Thus treatment is limited to the use of antibacterial compounds in the feeds. Generally there are two basic problems with the application of medicated feeds. The first is the development of antibiotic resistance (Mitchell and Plumb, 1980) . Such a plasmid-related drug resistance has been described for most of the antibiotics used to treat aeromonad infections (Chang and Bolton, 1987; Ansary et al., 1992) . The second problem is that the efficacy of such treatment could be very low in some cases due to the low appetite of the sick fish.",

The bacterium can be isolated from the hyperaemic surroundings of the ulcers of sick fish in most cases. On blood agar after 24 h it will produce small colonies, under which B haemolysis can be observed after 48 h. The bacterium does not produce pigment. It ferments glucose and maltose with the formation of acid, but without gas production. The CE bacterium is cytochrome-positive and hydrolyses gelatine and casein. It is resistant to penicillin and polymyxin B, but sensitive to medicines like oxytetracycline, neomycin, nitrofurantoin, Sumetrolim (sulfamethoxazole + trimethoprim) (Molnar and Szakolczai, 1992) . It seems that the CE bacterium is able to infect carp in the region of mechanical injuries, such as wounds caused by bloodsucking parasites.",

Carp is susceptible to columnaris under environmental conditions favourable to the bacterium and stressful to the fish. Outbreaks occur when water temperatures reach 20\u00b0C and above (Farkas and Oh&, 1986) . F. columnaris primarily attacks the external tissues, and uninjured tissue also appears to be attacked. The first indication of the infection is generally the appearance of a white spot on some part of the head, gills, fin or body. This is usually surrounded by a zone with a distinct reddish tinge, leading to under-running of adjacent skin. Lesions on the end of gills or fins extend principally from the distal end towards the base, and the tissues are eroded and destroyed. Lesions are covered with a yellowish white mucoid exudate consisting largely of swarms of F. columnaris (Wakabayashi, 1993) . The bacteria are not usually found systemically until a relatively large amount of external skin or gill damage has taken place; thus it would appear that the bacteria enter the bloodstream through the external lesions and are probably not directly involved in causing death (Wood, 1974) .",

( 1971) isolated a virus (Rhabdouirus carpio) , proved its aetiologicalrole in SVC and called the disease \"spring viraemia of carp\". Before this time the disease was known as \"infectious dropsy of carp\" (IDC) and was considered to have either a bacterial or a viral aetiology. Two forms of IDC became recognised: an acute or ascitic form and a chronic or ulcerative form. Fijan et al. ( 197 1) in their already cited work showed that Rhabdovirus carpio produced the acute form of what had been termed \"IDC\". The chronic or ulcerative form was later named \"carp erythrodermatitis\" and was shown to be caused by a non-motile bacterium of the genus Aeromonas (Bootsma et al., 1977) . The initial isolation of Rhabdovirus carpio was followed by confirming isolations in Czechoslovakia (Macura et al., 1973; Tesarcik, 1977) in Hungary (BCktsi and Szabo, 1977, 1979) and in Great Britain (Bucke and Finlay, 1979) . During the 198Os, the protozoan aetiology of swimbladder inflammation (SBI) was proved (Csaba et al., 1984; Korting, 1982; Kovacs-Gayer, 1983 ) and the possible role of SVCV in SBI was no longer considered.",

In the scheme suggested for the stress response of fish (Peters, 1979; Mauzeaud and Mauzeaud, 1981 ) the most important physiological and biochemical changes occurring at the primary, secondary and tertiary levels were summarised. Certain of these changes can also be employed to detect diseases at early stages or sublethal effects of environmental contaminants. A summary of the physiological tests for stress assessments of salmonids was published by Wedemeyer and Yasutake ( 1977) . A similar system for tilapia (Surotherodon aureus) and silver carp (Hypophthalmichthys molitriw) was presented by Bejerano ( 1984) . Data are available on the \"normal\" ranges or values of some of these parameters for common carp (Svobodova, 1987) . The limits of the \"normal\" values of these parameters in fish can only be overcome by a description of the typical changes under the effect of different environmental factors, compared to the changes in \"non-treated\" groups. For the assessment of the effects of environmental stress on common carp a system of clinical diagnostic parameters was set up and tested (Jeney and Jeney, 1986, 1987; Jeney, Z. et al., 1992a,b ). Using this system, different environmental stresses of both natural and antropogenic origin were investigated. Typical changes (increase or decrease, compared to the control) in these parameters are shown in Table 6 . As can be seen, most of the natural and anthropogenic environmental factors studied, even though typical for \"normal\" technological conditions, causing marked changes at all three levels of stress response of the carp.",

During recent years several substances have been tested in carp to enhance non-specific defence mechanisms and to build up protection against a wide range of pathogens. Levamisole treatment of carp fingerling stimulated growth and reduced natural mortality due to losses (Siwicki and Korwin-Kossakowski, 1988 ). Vitamin C is a popular immunostimulant added to diets of certain animals. Glucans, long-chain polysaccharides extracted from yeasts, are good stimulators of non-specific defence mechanisms in fish. Schizophyllan, scleroglucan, and lentinan were evaluated in carp for their ability to enhance protection against E. tarda and A. hydrophila (Yano et al., 1989 (Yano et al., , 1991 . In fish injected with these polysaccharides increased phagocytic activity and protection against the pathogen were observed.
