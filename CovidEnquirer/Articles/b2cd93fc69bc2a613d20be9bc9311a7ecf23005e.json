The current commercially available enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) kits for IBV specific antibody detection are mostly based on the whole virion, and few serological tests based on nonstructural proteins of IBV have been developed. Herein, an alternative indirect ELISA for detection of IBV antibody was developed with IBV nonstructural protein 5 (nsp5) produced by Escherichia coli. Using an indirect immunofluorescence assay (IFA) and a commercial ELISA kit as reference, we optimized the nsp5-ELISA and determined its cut-off as 0.12. The diagnostic sensitivity (DSN), specificity (DSP) and accuracy of the nsp5-ELISA were 93.11%, 95.38% and 93.33%, respectively, compared with IFA in 660 field serum samples, and were 98.11%, 95.00% and 97.62%, respectively, compared with the commercial IBV ELISA kit (IDEXX) in 126 field sera samples. Furthermore, a time course of IBV specific antibody level detected by nsp5-ELISA following IBV infection and vaccination is consistent with that of IBV antibody detected by the commercial ELISA kit. The results presented in this study indicate that nsp5-ELISA has the potential to serve as a rapid, reliable and cost-effective method for IBV antibody detection. This study is the first to report the development of an nsp-based ELISA to detect an antibody to IBV.",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is an acute and highly contagious respiratory disease (Cavanagh, 2003) caused by infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a prototype of the Coronaviridae family. IBV infects chickens of all ages and causes significant economic losses to chicken farms. In addition to infection of the respiratory system, IBV also infects the reproductive system, which can lead to the low production and poor quality of eggs. Some of the virus strains have a tropism to chicken kidney cells and cause nephritis that can lead to the deaths of the infected chickens (Reddy et al., 2015) . Currently, mutations are frequently noted in the IBV genome, leading to variation and drift of viral antigens that can pose challenges to diagnostic tests. IBV emerged more than 70 years ago and contin- ues to be one of the most important poultry pathogens worldwide (Cook, 2016) .",

Among the diagnosis methods, chicken embryo culture has remained the method of choice to obtain field IBV isolates. RT-PCR is the first choice to detect IBV for many laboratories since it is rapid, sensitive and specific (Nguyen et al., 2013) . Currently, Realtime PCR is a widely used method for the quantitative detection of IBV (Fellahi et al., 2016) . Gene sequences and phylogenetic analyses are currently applied to determine the variation of newly isolated IBV. ELISA based on whole virions as well as recombinant S1 (spike protein 1 subunit) and N proteins (Nucleoprotein) could provide a rapid and large-scale detection method for IBV infection (Bronzoni et al., 2005; Lin et al., 2012; Gibertoni et al., 2005) . However, few IBV detection methods are developed based on the nonstructural proteins (nsps).",

After immunization with an inactivated vaccine prepared from purified virions, the animal would not produce any or very low levels of antibodies to virus nsps. Nsps have the potential to be used for differential diagnoses between vaccination with inactivated vaccine and natural infection. Nsp ELISA has become an essential part of the vaccination-based control and serosurveillance policy in many FMD-(foot-and-mouth disease-) endemic countries. Nsp-ELISA could provide long term (up to 3 years) and sensitive detection for FMDV infection (Elnekave et al., 2015) . However, as of yet, there are no applications using nsps to detect IBV infection.",

Sera from infected or vaccinated chickens on different days post infection/vaccination were collected and tested for specific antibody by nsp5-ELISA. The results were also compared with those from the IDEXX ELISA kit. As shown in Fig. 4A , antibodies to nsp5/IBV in SC021202-infected chickens can be detected at 6 days post inoculation by both assays. The antibodies then dramatically increased and reached a maximal level 12 days post infection. Although only one infected chicken survived 21 days post infection, nsp5/IBV antibodies of the remaining chicken remained at a high level until 154 days post infection. In contrast, seroconversion in the inactivated M41 (Fig. 4B ) and attenuated H52 (Fig. 4C ) vaccinated groups began at 9 and 12 days post inoculation, respectively, which was delayed compared to those in the SC021202 infected group. In the inactivated M41 immunized group, antibody levels declined below the IBV IDEXX cut-off at 95 days and 99 days (nsp5) post inoculation, while in the attenuated H52 immunized group, the corresponding antibody levels declined below the respective cut-off 135 days (IBV/IDEXX) and 140 days (nsp5) post infection (Fig. 4C) . The data showed that a time course of the IBV nsp5 antibody level following IBV infection and vaccination, which were detected by the nsp5-ELISA, is consistent with those of IBV antibodies detected by the commercial ELISA kit and that the nsp5 antibody levels decreased earlier in the inactivated M41 immunized group than in the attenuated H52 and SC021202 infected groups.",

The mutation of the Coronavirus nsp5 enzyme's key active sites led to a loss of nsp5 enzymatic activity and impacted viral rescue (Stobart et al., 2012) . Thus, the nsp5 of SARS-CoV is considered a drug target for anti-virus therapy. Recently, we found that nsp5 was clearly expressed in IBV-infected DF-1 cells at the beginning of infection, which was evidenced with both mRNA and protein levels analyzed by real-time PCR and IFA, respectively. However, the expression decreased dramatically after 24 h post infection (data not shown), suggesting that IBV nsp5 might be important for the early infection of IBV to host cells. Recombinant GST-fused nsp5 reacted with antiserum to IBV in a Western blot analysis (Fig. 1B) in this study, and antiserum to nsp5 reacted with a different tropism of IBV, including nephropathogenic SC01202, Mass-type H120 and proventriculitis-associated ZJ971 infected DF-1 cells (data not shown). The above findings indicate that IBV nsp5 is important for virus infection, and it has good immunogenicity and serological-reactivity, which enabled the use of this nsp5 as an antigen to detect IBV antibody.",

Nsp5/IBV antibodies remained at high levels for at least 154 days in the SC021202infected group (Fig. 4A ). In the H52 vaccinated groups, the antibody levels gradually decreased below the cut-off 135 days (IBV-IDEXX) and 140 days (nsp5) post vaccination. In the inactivated M41 vaccinated group, nsp5/IBV antibodies gradually decreased approximately 77 days post inoculation and became negative 95-98 days post vaccination. The above data suggest that the nsp5 antibody in IBV infected/vaccinated chickens is consistent with IBV antibody. Furthermore, in virulent and attenuated IBV infected chickens, the nsp5/IBV positive antibodies persisted longer than those in inactive vaccinated chickens. Therefore, in this case, nsp5 might not be a very suitable factor for differential detection between infection and attenuated IBV vaccination. However, the nsp5-ELISA could detect IBV specific antibody 6 days post infection in a virulent IBV infected group earlier than the detection in attenuated and inactivated vaccination groups, suggesting that nsp5-ELISA is suitable to detect the early infection of virulent IBV.",

In this study, we used GST-fused nsp5 expressed by E. coli as the coating antigen to establish an nsp5-ELISA to detect IBV antibody. The nsp5-ELISA was proved to be sensitive and specific for IBV antibody detection. To exclude the interference of GST tag, we compared the data obtained by the nsp5-ELISA (GST-fused nsp5 as a coating antigen) with the data obtained after removing the GST background in a parallel experiment (GST as ELISA coating antigen). The results showed that there is no significant difference between the two sets of data (data not shown), indicating that the GST-fused nsp5 is as efficient as the coating antigen for the nsp5-ELISA. Additionally, homology analysis reveals that the nsp5 protein of IBV strain SC021202 used in this study is 89.1%-99.7% homologous to different serotypes of reference strains (data not shown). Therefore, the nsp5-ELISA has potential to detect antibodies induced by IBV of different serotypes.",
