It is not clearly understood how this virus is replicated within and released from the sensory neurons, and it remains to know how satellite cells response to the HEV invasion. By ultrastructurally examining HEV-infected rat dorsal root ganglia, we found that HEV in the cell bodies of infected neurons budded from endoplasmic reticulum-Golgi intermediate compartments, and were assembled either individually within small vesicles or in groups within large vesicles. The progeny virions were released from the sensory neurons mainly by smooth-surfaced vesicle-mediated secretory pathway, which occurred predominantly at the perikaryal projections and infoldings of sensory neurons. Released HEV particles were subsequently taken up by the adjacent satellite cells. Almost all virus particles in the cytoplasm of satellite cells were contained in groups within vesicles and lysosome-like structures, suggesting that these glial cells may restrict the local diffusion of HEV. These observations give some insights into the pathogenesis of coronavirus infection and are thought to help understand the interactions between sensory neurons and their satellite cells.",

As the first member of the group coronaviruses found to invade the central nervous system, HEV was initially isolated from encephalomyelitic piglet brains in 1960 by Greig et al. (1962) in Canada. Subsequent studies demonstrated that HEV first infected the epithelial cells lining the upper respiratory tract, and thereafter was delivered retrogradely via peripheral nerves to the central neurons in charge of peristaltic function of the digestive tracts, resulting in the so-called vomiting diseases (Andries and Pensaert, 1980; Yagami et al., 1986) .

(Hirano et al., 1993 (Hirano et al., , 1998 (Hirano et al., , 2004 Bai et al., 2008) . The cell bodies of the primary afferent neurons, which convey sensory information from the periphery to the central nervous system, are completely surrounded by several satellite cells (SCs). The unique structure of the SC envelope do not merely give mechanical or nutrient support to the neurons, but also enables SCs to exert a tight control of the extracellular microenviroment around the neurons (Hanani, 2005) . So far, it is unclear how HEV is replicated in and transferred from the sensory neurons, and it remains to know what roles SCs play in the HEV-infected ganglia. Given that coronaviruses are able to make use of the cellular events preexisting in the host cells (for review, see Hobman, 1993; Masters, 2006) , the clarification of the mechanism underlying coronavirus infection in the sensory ganglia was expected to help understand the cellular events in the ganglionic neurons as well as the relationship between the neurons and their SCs.",

The roles of these perikaryal specializations during HEV infection seem to require further investigations. At the release sites, HEV particles were accumulated in the dilated extracellular space between the neurons and their SCs, and subsequently taken up within vesicular structures by the SCs. Viral replication signs were absent in the cytoplasm of the SCs. On the other hand, the presence of virus particles within lysosome-like structures in the SCs as well as the disappearance of virus particles in the later stage (data not shown) indicated that HEV seemed to be finally cleared by these cells. These observations suggested that SCs may play a restrictive role during HEV propagation.",

On the other hand, increasing evidence showed that SCs can function as phagocytes to clear the cell debris of degenerative neurons during neural traumas (Tay et al., 1984a,b; Zhang et al., 1994) and viral infections (Alema\u00f1 et al., 2001) . Moreover, the SCs resident in human trigeminal ganglia have recently been shown to closely Panel B shows a virion located extracellularly between an infected neuron and its SC, where the invaginated plasma membrane of the infected neuron is covered with a layer of coating decorations (larger arrow). Panels in middle and bottom rows show HEV transfer by use of large smooth-surface vesicles, which is found to occur in neuronal perikaryal specializations. In Panels C and D, the neuronal projections are seen arising from the neuronal cell body and appear as microvillus-like structures (asterisks). Panels E and F show cross-sectioned neuronal projections (asterisks), which are embedded within the cytoplasm of SCs without continuity with the neuronal cell bodies. resemble microglia because they have also phenotypic and functional antigen-presenting cell properties (van Velzen et al., 2009) . Our results showed that SCs engulfed only the released virions but not the cell bodies of HEV-infected neurons at the early stage of HEV infection. This form of phagocytosis does not resemble traditional SC phagocytosis of degenerating or apoptotic neurons. Given that coronaviruses are able to make use of the cellular events preexisting in the host cells (for review, see Hobman, 1993; Masters, 2006) , it is of interest to know whether a similar scavenging mechanism can be used by SCs under normal conditions to control the microenvironments surrounding the subjacent neurons.",

In panel B, viral budding profiles (arrows) can be observed in ER and in the lateral rims of Golgi complexes (G). Besides small vesicles enclosing single virions, large vesicles (arrowheads) containing more than one virion are also found in the Golgi areas. No virus-related structures are seen within the nucleus (C), but nuclear envelope invaginations are often encountered (arrow).",

Panel B shows groups of virions enclosed within large smooth-surfaced vesicle (arrows) in the Golgi areas. The arrowheads indicate virus particles present in the dilated rims of the trans-Golgi network. Panel C shows progeny virions enclosed individually within small vesicles in a trans-Golgi network. The arrow indicates a coated vesicle containing a single virion. Similar coating structures are also present on a small empty vesicle as well as part of the trans-Golgi networks (arrowheads). Panel D shows that virus-containing vesicles are attached to each other (arrows). The inset in panel D is a high-power electron micrograph, showing a virus enclosed within a vesicle. A layer of surface projections can be seen surrounding the viral envelope beneath the vesicle membrane.",

The intercellular space between neuronal cell bodies and their SCs are generally narrow with a distance of about 20 nm. The neuronal-SC boundary is complicated by the presence of numerous projections, which arose from either the neuron or the adjacent SCs. The neuronal projections occur more frequently. In single sections, they are sometimes seen continuous with the neuronal cell surface (asterisk). B: In the neurons, lysosomes (labeled arrows) and vesicles (arrows) of varying size are frequently located near the Golgi apparatuses (G).
