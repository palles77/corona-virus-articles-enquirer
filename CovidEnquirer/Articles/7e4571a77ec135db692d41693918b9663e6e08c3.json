In July 2013, the World Health Organization (WHO) International Health Regulations Emergency Committee determined that MERS-CoV did not meet criteria for a \"public health emergency of international concern,\" but was nevertheless of \"serious and great concern\" (2).

All cases have been directly or indirectly linked through travel to or residence in four countries: Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Jordan, and the United Arab Emirates (UAE) (Figure 2 ). The median age of persons with confirmed MERS-CoV infection is 50 years (range: 2-94 years). The male-to-female ratio is 1.6 to 1.0. Twenty-three (18%) of the cases occurred in persons who were identified as health-care workers. Although most reported cases involved severe respiratory illness requiring hospitalization, at least 27 (21%) involved mild or no symptoms. Despite evidence of person-to-person transmission, the number of contacts infected by persons with confirmed infections appears to be limited. No cases have been reported in the United States, although 82 persons from 29 states have been tested for MERS-CoV infection.",
