Acute OM (AOM) is an acute infection of the middle ear with middle ear effusion (MEE) by otoscopic examination. The tympanic membrane (TM) often is red, bulging, and opaque. AOM usually is manifested by ear pain or tugging or rubbing of the ear. Fever and irritability may be present. OM with effusion (OME) is a painless collection of fluid in the middle ear without any signs of acute inflammation or infection. Most cases evolve from AOM, but a preceding infection is not necessary.",

Children differ from adults in that complications are more likely to occur from AOM than chronic ear disease and often are the result of delayed treatment. Hearing loss, the most prevalent complication, can be conductive, sensorineural, or mixed. The magnitude of the conductive hearing loss ranges from 15 to 40 dB and seems to result from the quantity, rather than the quality, of fluid in the middle ear. This type of hearing loss disappears when the MEE resolves. Infectious or inflammatory mediators in the middle ear or in the labyrinth can cause sensorineural hearing loss.",

Cholesteatomas are locally invasive and can destroy important structures, such as the ossicles, cochlea, or semicircular canals. Figure 61 -1 illustrates the normal anatomy of the ear and the relationship of the external, middle, and inner ear to one another. The location of the eustachian tube acts as a conduit connecting the middle ear to the nasopharynx. The development of OM in children is the direct result of abnormal function of this tube. Anatomic features, such as its length and position relative to the posterior nasopharyngeal wall, contribute to increased frequency of OM. The eustachian tube in young infants is shorter and more horizontal than in older children ( Fig. 61-2) .",

            "text": "The eustachian tube has three major physiologic functions: (1) ventilation of the middle ear, (2) drainage of middle ear fluid, and (3) protection of the middle ear from nasopharyngeal secretions. These functions occur via active dilation of the tube by contraction of the tensor veli palatini muscle ( Fig. 61-3 ). Normal function of this muscle is essential in preventing MEE and acute infections. Eustachian tube dysfunction is the result of abnormal patulence of the tube, mechanical obstruction ( Fig. 61-4) , or both. Functional obstruction results from poor tensor veli palatini function. Mechanical obstruction occurs from either an extrinsic or an intrinsic cause. Extrinsic causes include enlarged adenoids or the presence of a nasopharygeal tumor. Intrinsic causes often are related to injury or inflammation of distal tubal epithelium by upper respiratory infections with viruses such as influenza or respiratory syncytial virus. Epithelial damage leads to increased mucus secretion and cellular debris, which then obstructs the lumen. If the eustachian tube is occluded, negative middle ear pressure develops as oxygen is absorbed from this space. Transudative serous capillary fluid accumulates in the middle ear and the mastoid air cells and can be infected with nasopharyngeal bacteria that enter through the eustachian tube as it opens intermittently. Replication of the bacteria within the serous fluid leads to a series of inflammatory processes with the release of bacterial and host cell products into the middle ear. The clinical manifestation of these events is AOM.",

At birth, the mastoid air cell system com- prises a single cell, the antrum, which is connected to the middle ear by a small channel called the aditus ad antrum. Pneumatization of the mastoid bone begins soon after birth and continues throughout life. By age 2, this process is usually extensive. All mastoid air cells end up interconnected with the antrum, which sometimes is referred to as the bottleneck when an acute infection cannot drain from the mastoid into the middle ear. Clinically significant disease develops when an infection within the mastoid cavity spreads to the periosteum covering the mastoid process. With further progression, the bony trabeculae that separate the mastoid air cells are destroyed, resulting in a mastoid empyema. Invasion of adjacent structures leads to formation of a soft tissue, subperiosteal abscess, or chronic mastoiditis. Rarely, further extension into the petrous portion of the temporal bone may occur, resulting in petrositis. A classic triad of retrobulbar pain, persistent otorrhea, and ipsilateral abducens nerve palsy (Gradenigo's syndrome) is seen in patients with this complication. Infection also can spread to the labyrinth and facial nerve or into the intracranial cavity causing more serious morbidity and mortality. Acute mastoiditis occurs most commonly as a complication of chronic suppurative OM but can develop after an acute infection. Acute TM perforation and the presence of a cholesteatoma are predisposing factors.",

Excessive sweating, absence of cerumen, hearing aid irritation or improper fit, earplug usage, and the insertion of a foreign body to scratch the ear canal also can play a role in the development of infection.

A peak between \u2212100 mm H 2 O and +50 mm H 2 O is normal. A peak less than \u2212100 mm H 2 O signifies high negative pressure, and a peak at greater than +50 mm H 2 O is consistent with high positive pressure.

The challenge for the clinician is to distinguish these two entities from simple OE. Specific features of the history and physical examination associated with each condition are summarized in Table 61-3. Patients with acute OE complain of pruritus, the acute onset of unilateral ear pain that is worsened by applying pressure to the tragus or with movement of the pinna, and sometimes a sense of aural stuffiness or fullness. Significant edema of the external canal can cause hearing loss. Otalgia may range from mild discomfort to severe, unrelenting pain requiring narcotic analgesics. Occasionally, normal jaw movements (chewing) exacerbate the pain. In mild acute disease, the external canal is minimally edematous and erythematous, with or without serous or purulent drainage filling the lumen (Box 61-1). As the infection progresses, the exudate becomes more profuse and malodorous. Often the pinna and tragus are exquisitely tender to palpation. Sagging of the superior canal, periauricular edema, and preauricular and postauricular adenopathy develop with more severe disease. Extension of the infection to surrounding soft tissues results in obstruction of the ear canal with or without a circumscribed cellulitis.

Ophthalmic manifestations may be the heralding sign in a spectrum of systemic conditions, such as Stevens-Johnson syndrome, Crouzon's disease, or albinism, in which the eye may be the most significantly involved structure. An understanding of both neurologic function and the basic function and anatomy of the eye, periocular structures, and orbit is essential when developing an assessment and treatment plan.Conditions that affect the eye or its function often are subdivided by the particular ocular structure involved. Different disorders can lead to a final common pathway of dysfunction. Treatment of the presenting condition requires evaluation of a broad differential diagnosis and the effect of the condition on the developing visual system.The ocular system is subclassified by the ocular structures. External disorders are conditions that affect the orbit, lids, or lacrimal system. Disorders of the anterior segment are conditions that affect the cornea, iris, or lens or lead to glaucoma. Posterior segment disorders involve the retina, retinal vasculature, vitreous humor, and optic nerves. Neuroophthalmologic disorders, inflammatory conditions, and trauma often involve multiple structures. Vision development, nystagmus, amblyopia, and ocular torticollis are special ocular conditions that affect pediatric patients. Figure 62 -1 depicts the important internal anatomic structures of the eye. Each structure is highly specialized to provide an enormous range of information to the visual system. The eye is responsible for discrimination and resolution (visual acuity), sensing object movement, peripheral vision, and positional visual awareness. The visual system is able to adjust over a range of about 10 log units in the ambient light intensity levels. The tracking mechanisms of the eye also are finely developed to provide for image stabilization and pursuit and rapid and directed (saccadic) eye movements that allow for refixation and rapid response to new objects of regard in the visual awareness.",
