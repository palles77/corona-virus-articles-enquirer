This study evaluated the association between antihypertensive drug class, all-cause mortality and deaths due to diabetes or renal disease in real-life clinical settings. Methods: A clinical database in Hong Kong included all patients who were prescribed their first-ever antihypertensive agents between 2001 and 2005 from the public healthcare sector. All patients were followed up for five years, and grouped according to the initial antihypertensive prescription. The associations between antihypertensive drug class, all-cause mortality or combined diabetes and renal mortality, respectively, were evaluated by Cox proportional hazard models. Results: From 218,047 eligible patients, 33,288 (15.3%) died within five years after their first-ever antihypertensive prescription and among which 1055 patients (0.48%) died of diabetes or renal disease. After adjusted for age, gender, socioeconomic status, service settings, district of residence, medication adherence, and the number of comorbidities, each drug class was similarly likely to be associated with mortality due to diabetes or renal disease [Adjusted Hazard Ratios (AHR) ranged from 0.92 to 1.73, p = 0.287-0.939] and all-cause mortality (AHR ranged from 0.83 to 1.02) except for beta-blockers (AHR = 0.815, 95% C.I. 0.68-0.87, p = 0.024) when ACEI was used as a reference group in propensity score-adjusted analysis. Conclusions: These findings provide real-life evidence reinforcing that any major antihypertensive drug class is suitable as a first-line agent for management of hypertension as recommended by international guidelines.",

This is based on the observation in landmark RCTs that all major classes of antihypertensive drugs, except \u03b1-blockers, have been shown to reduce morbidity and mortalityand there exists few differences among them [3, 4] . However, the guideline issued by the National Institute for Health and Clinical Excellence (NICE), with the assistance of the British Hypertension Society, dropped \u03b2-blockers as the first-line agent owing to its suboptimal outcomes in recent clinical trials [5] .",

The Task Force for the Management of Arterial Hypertension of the European Society of Hypertension (ESH) and of the European Society of Cardiology (ESC) has long recognized the limitations of event-based randomized therapeutic trials [7] . These include the need to select elderly or higher risk patients to maximize the number of events collected and achieve adequate study power. As a result, younger, uncomplicated patients with lower cardiovascular risks are under-represented, and little information is available on treatment benefits in a large number of hypertensive populations. Another important caveat is that therapeutic programs in RCTs usually diverge from usual clinical practice since drugs randomly allocated at trial commencement are continued irrespective of blood pressure lowering effects; but in clinical practice physicians normally do not continue the prescriptions which are ineffective. In trials the benefits conferred to patients are therefore diluted by the lack of benefits in non-responsive patients, and they are usually of short durationwhich will imply that their generalizability to the general population is limited. These randomized trials should be interpreted in parallel with observational studies to achieve a balanced decision regarding the choice of the most preferred first-line antihypertensive agent.",

This task requires incorporation of observational studies in addition to the newer randomized outcome trials. Nevertheless, there is a scarcity of large scale observational studies which could inform guideline recommendations. We have previously studied the compliance profiles and 5 year incidence of cardiovascular mortality in a large Chinese population newly prescribed antihypertensive medications [8, 9] , in an attempt to provide real-life clinical data. It is presently unknown whether any major antihypertensive drug class is superior in terms of preventing deaths due to all causes, diabetes or renal diseases in non-interventional settings. The objective of this study is to test the a priori hypothesis that the incidences of all-cause mortality or deaths due to diabetes or kidney diseases, respectively, are similar among the major antihypertensive drug classes as first-line agents. The secondary objective of this study is to identify patients at higher risks for all-cause, diabetes-and renal disease-related mortality five years after antihypertensive prescriptions.",

Briefly, these databases capture patients' demographic parameters, prescription details, and clinical diagnoses in the forms of the International Classification of Diseases (ICD-9 and ICD-10) or the International Classification of Primary Care (ICPC-2). It serves as the sole portal of data entry which allows the linkage of physician-entered information at each patient visit in all public clinical settings among different districts. All drug prescriptions are inputted by the attending physicians and are cross-checked by dispensers or pharmacists using standardized procedures, and any amendments to the prescriptions after the initial consultations are also recorded in the system. This database was previously validated and it demonstrated a high level of completeness on the socio-demographic information (100%) and prescription profiles (99.8%) [10] . The sampling frame for the present study included the entire Hong Kong population, which is more than 7,000,000 as of 2012. Hong Kong is divided into three distinct regions, namely Hong Kong Island (most urbanized); Kowloon; and the New Territories (most rural). The ethics clearance of the study was obtained from the Clinical Ethics Research Committee of the Hospital Authority, and the Survey and Behavioral Research Ethics Committee of The Chinese University of Hong Kong. Informed consent was not necessary as all subjects were anonymized with unique identity numbers. The study protocol conforms to the ethical guidelines of the 1975 Declaration of Helsinki.",

Patients who received any antihypertensive medications before the index date were excluded. We captured patients who died from diabetes and renal diseases, and treated the deaths due to conditions other than these two diseases within the observation period as being censored. Each patient was allocated based on the initial prescription of antihypertensive agents, namely, \u03b1-blockers, \u03b2-blockers, thiazide diuretics, CCBs and ACEIs. Patients who were prescribed ARBs and combination therapy were excluded in our data analysis because these prescriptions were relatively rare. Concomitant comorbidities include cardiovascular risk factors and medical conditions which could potentially confound the choice of antihypertensive drug class, as indicated by the respective ICPC-2 or ICD-9/ICD-10 codes.

The vast majority of all deaths in Hong Kong occurred in hospitals, which allows accurate case ascertainment [16] . A number of previous studies have utilized deaths in hospital as a valid proxy of patient mortality, especially for Chinese populations in which death usually occurs in hospitals [16] [17] [18] . The cause of death due to diabetes (e.g. diabetic ketoacidosis or hyperosmolar non-ketotic diabetic coma) or renal disease (e.g. uremia) was defined according to the primary cause of mortality for each patient, as determined by the physicians-in-charge when death was registered in the death certificates. The predictor variable in this study was the major class of antihypertensive drugs on its initial prescription. The interval-based proportion of days covered (PDC) was included as a covariate to take into consideration the influence of medication adherence as a potential confounder. The PDC refers to the number of days when medication is supplied in a specified period divided by the total number of days within the period. The interval-based measure of PDC is an internationally accepted metric for assessing drug adherence in large database analysis [19] [20] [21] . In this study, a five-year interval was used for the estimation of PDC. For patients who died during the five-year period, the time period between the index date and mortality was used to estimate the PDC. Similar to the approach adopted by Mazzaglia and colleagues [22] , drug adherence in the present study was divided into two levels, namely: high and intermediate (PDC \u2265 40%) or low (PDC b 40%) [23, 24] . In addition, we also evaluated the rates of medication discontinuation and switching among these patients. Drug switching is defined as the absence of a refill prescription in all subsequent clinic visits combined with the prescription of another antihypertensive drug of a different class since the date of the first prescription, whereas drug discontinuation refers to repeat prescription of the same drug class lasting for b80% of the days in the specified period after the first-ever antihypertensive prescription date. According to international literature, we used 1 year, 2 years, 3 years, 4 years and 5 years, respectively, as the time points for measuring these two outcomes [25] [26] [27] .",

            "text": "A recent meta-analysis of RCTs comparing the incidence of allcause mortality among the major antihypertensive drug classes [3] showed that there was no difference between patients initially prescribed beta-blockers, diuretics and renin-angiotensin system inhibitors, and the all-cause mortality rate was only marginally higher for beta-blockers compared to CCB (relative risk 1.07, 95% CI 1.00 to 1.14; I(2) = 2%). However, the authors recognized that the GRADE evidence of these findings were low and achieved mid-level evidence only, indicating that the true effect of beta-blockers may be substantially different from the review estimates [30] . Another meta-analysis involving 127 studies corresponding to 150 group comparisons with a weighted mean follow-up of 4.2 years [31] demonstrated that there exists a slightly smaller risk of end-stage renal failure among ACEI or ARB users than other antihypertensive users (relative risk 0.87, 95% C.I. 0.75-0.99, p = 0.40). The ACEI or ARB group was also associated with a statistically significant smaller serum creatinine change (\u2212 7.07 \u03bcmol/L, 95% C.I. \u2212 13.26 to \u2212 0.88) and also urine albumin excretion (\u2212 15.37 mg/day, 95% C.I. \u2212 24.72 to \u2212 6.74). However, these benefits have been attributed to lowering of blood pressure per se rather than the antihypertensive drug class used. In a post-hoc analysis of the Antihypertensive and Lipid-Lowering Treatment to Prevent Heart Attack Trial (ALLHAT) among hypertensive patients aged 55 years or older with at least one cardiovascular risk factor, there were no significant differences found in the incidence of end-stage renal failure or decrement in glomerular filtration rates [32] . Furthermore, there is one significant factor which could potentially favor the effectiveness of \u03b2-blockers on reducing mortality, namely the national salt intake level. Dietary salt intake in Hong Kong was high at the time the study participants were recruited. The average sodium intake of the Hong Kong population is 203 mmol/day (4.67 g/day) [33] , which is higher than western countries and also the level recommended by the WHO (b 2 g/day) [34] . The findings should therefore be interpreted in the light of this potential confounder.",

Nevertheless, these and other metabolic differences did not translate into any overall disadvantages for the thiazide diuretic group after the average follow-up of 4.9 years. Furthermore, additional epidemiological analysis examining the association of 2 year fasting glucose changes with cardiovascular disease and renal events reported no significance overall and separately in the diuretic group [36] . Also, among those who developed incident diabetes by 2 years compared with those who did not, there was no subsequent increase in risks for any major disease outcomes and mortality, with an exception of congestive heart failure [37] .

The completeness of the database and the good dispensing practice make the study findings more robust. In addition, the accuracy of the independent variable (antihypertensive drug class) and the outcome measures (mortality) further strengthen the results. However, some of the limitations should be addressed. Firstly, we assume that patients were taking the medications prescribed as they were documented in the database which is an inherent assumption for database studies. Furthermore, the dataset does not consist of all potential confounders which could be controlled, such as the severity of comorbidity, the blood pressure levels, and some covariates including lifestyle factors which were not routinely captured in clinical databases. Moreover, indication bias for treatment according to medication classes exists despite the use of propensity scores. One might also argue that regression analysis could not completely control confounders because of the presence of residual confounding. Lastly, critics might comment that the duration of observing mortality for only 5 years after initial antihypertensive prescriptions might not be long enough to capture clinically meaningful outcomes, and prolonging the observational period is warranted in future studies.",
