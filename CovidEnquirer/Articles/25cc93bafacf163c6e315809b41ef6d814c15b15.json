Few tests allow confirmation or exclusion of SARS within the first few days of infection. A gene chip is a useful tool for the study of microbial infections mainly for its capability of performing multi-target analysis in a single test. Objectives: Investigate the possibility of early detection of SARS virus from clinical samples using the gene chip-based method. Study design: We purified RNA from SARS-CoV obtained from routinely collected peripheral blood and sputum samples of 34 patients who had been identified as probable SARS patients by following the interim U.S. case definition. Four segments of the SARS-CoV were amplified using reverse transcription-nested PCR and the products examined using the 70-mer gene chips for SARS-CoV detection. Results: A blind-test of both peripheral blood and sputum specimens lead to the positive detection of SARS-CoV in 31 out of 34 patients. SARS-CoV was not found in peripheral blood or sputum specimens from three patients. Two of the 34 patients were only 3 days post-onset of symptoms and were subsequently confirmed to be SARS positive. Our results indicate that the gene chip-based molecular test is specific for SARS-CoV and allows early detection of patients with SARS with detection rate about 8% higher than the single PCR test when the sputum sample is available.",

            "text": "Severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) is a newly emerged disease associated with pneumonia in infected patients (World Health and Organization, 2003) . From November 2002 to June 3, 2003 , SARS virus infected 8398 people and caused 772 deaths worldwide (www.who.int/ csr/sars/country/2003-06-03/en/, accessed July 2003). The genome of the SARS-CoV has been sequenced (Marra et al., 2003; Ruan et al., 2003) . The earlier that a case of SARS virus is detected, the less chance there is that a patient will spread the disease to others. Various serological and molecular tests have been developed for the detection of this virus or to confirm infection. These methods include enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) (Ksiazek et al., 2003) , indirect immunofluorescent assay (IFA) and reverse transcription (RT) followed by a real-time PCR using either the TaqMan technique or the intercalating fluorescent dye approach (Drosten et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003) . As yet, few tests allow confirmation or exclusion of SARS within the first few days of infection. Serological methods cannot close the window period, and are not useful for early detection. Real-time PCR can only detect one target sequence a time, which means that false negative results are possible. The genome of SARS-CoV is a positive ssRNA, which means that, the mRNA sequence of SARS-CoV is same as the genome sequence, hence the copy number of SARS-CoV can not be calculated directly from the quantitative result of real-time PCR. Gene chip provide a useful tool to study microbial infections (Cheng and Kricka, 2001; Wang et al., 2002; Tao et al., 2002) mainly for its capability of performing multi-targets analysis in only one test. Recently, we have reported the use of gene chips for the detection of pathogenic bacteria and viruses in clinically relevant samples or changes in gene expression among drug-treated and untreated microbes (Cheng et al., 1998; Tao et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2002) . In this paper, we report a method for early detection of the SARS virus in clinical specimens from SARS patients. The method combines a convenient sample preparation method, nucleic acid amplification using a modified nested PCR, and a gene chip array with probes selected to cover the representative regions of the SARS-CoV genome.",

The negative controls include 100 pe-ripheral blood samples and 100 sputum samples that were collected from university students at Tsinghua who were determined to be free of infection based on radiological and temperature measurements. In the following experiment one negative blood control sample or sputum sample was included with 17 clinical blood samples or sputum samples during the sample pretreatment and extraction stages as a control to monitor any occurrence of contamination that may appear during the sample treatment process. In addition, one blank control using water as template was included with the 17 RT-PCR reactions on clinical samples to control the PCR procedure.",

The IC probe was designed to guarantee the sample processing procedure and the entire nested RT-PCR process operates as expected. The EC probe was used to monitor the efficiency of the hybridization process and also as a reference for quantifying the amplicons' hybridization signal. The BC was DMSO spotted on the substrate to ensure no signal detected on these spots indicating to guarantee no carry-over of the previously spotted samples.",

Fig. 2 shows the DNA electrophoresis results and hybridization images from different controls including blank control using double distilled water as template, negative control using blood from a healthy control and sputum samples, and positive control using the Vero cells inoculated with SARS-CoV. All blank controls and negative controls tested were of negative results whereas the positive control produced the expected positive hybridization results. Fig. 3 (a-d) show the DNA electrophoresis results and gene-chip hybridization images from a patient's blood (patient 1) and sputum specimens respectively. The blood sample was taken 2 days post-onset of symptoms and the sputum sample taken 3 days post-onset of symptoms. The results show that the sputum specimen is positive for the presence of SARS-CoV whereas the blood sample was negative (no signal). Fig. 3 (e-h) show the electrophoretic results and hybridization images from the blood and sputum specimens, respectively, of a second patient (patient 2). The blood sample was taken 2 days post-onset of symptoms and the sputum sample taken 3 days post-onset of symptoms.

Fig. 3 (i-l) show the electrophoretic results and hybridization images from the blood and sputum specimens respectively of a third patient (patient 3).

The comparative study of the positive detection rate on gene chip with single probe and the four-combined probes for blood or sputum or blood and sputum are summarized in Table 3 . From all 34 patients, each run of nested RT-PCR may or may not produce amplicons depending on the type of the specimen and time interval of sampling. However, when the four amplification reactions from both blood and sputum were combined in, the positive detection rate on chip is maximized, increasing from 55.8% for blood and 79.4% for sputum to 91.2% when blood and sputum results were combined. When a single probe was used on the chip, the highest detection rate was 83.3%. This rate is approximately 8% lower than the rate (91.2%) when all four probes were used with both blood and sputum.",

The efficiency of clinical sample preparation was ensured by the application of the QIAamp Viral RNA Mini Kit, the amplification efficiency of the target RNA amplification was guaranteed by nested PCR, and the high specificity in detection was provided by chip hybridization. Furthermore, the false negative rate has been greatly reduced by the combined use of four probes (Table 3 )-a \"quadruple security\" strategy, which is quite different from the existing methods such as serological method or real-time PCR. Only one target was detected in one test using the ex- isted methods (\"miss one, miss all\") and a higher risk of false negative was inevitably encountered. During a SARS crisis a false negative diagnostic could be disastrous to the public. We found that the combination of four individually nested RT-PCR reactions and chip hybridization produced maximal sensitivity in gene chip-based early detection of SARS-CoV.",

When the amount of the templates is limited, we found that the orf N, which is the closest to the 3 proximal region of the SARS-CoV genome, is the most easily amplifiable template (463 bp, 25 positives for sputum specimens and 13 for blood samples) and the next most easily amplified is the orf S (349 bp, 22 positives for sputum specimens and 13 for blood samples). This may be explained by the previous report that the nidovirus structural proteins, which are encoded in the 3 -proximal region of the genome, are individually expressed from a nested set of subgenomic mRNAs generated by a unique discontinuous transcription mechanism (Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . At least five subgenomic mRNAs were detected by Northern hybridization of RNA from SARS-CoV-infected cells, using a probe derived from the 3 -untranslated region. The calculated sizes of the five predominant bands correspond to the sizes of five of the predicted subgenomic mRNAs of SARS-CoV (Rota et al., 2003) . However, when the quantity of the templates is increased to a certain level one or even two of the remaining two products representing orf 1a were also amplified (797 bp, 16 positives for sputum specimens and 6 for blood samples and 858 bp, 8 positives for sputum specimens and 0 for blood samples). Additionally, extreme precautions have been taken to prevent cross contamination during the experiment, which include the use of dUTP and Uracil-DNA Glycosylase, the remote physical isolation of laboratories for sample preparation, PCR preparation, electrophoretic examination and hybridization of amplicons. The results in Fig. 2 (a-f) showed no nonspecific amplifications occurred in the blank control and no nonspecific hybridization signals for any of the probes. In Fig. 2 (b) , it appears as if the probe for orf N generated a weak positive signal, yet in fact the hybridization result was categorized as negative because the signal-to-noise ratio was 1.34 (74/55.25) and much less than the threshold value of 2.5. Both blood and sputum samples from the healthy control produced negative hybridization signals for all four SARS-CoV specific probes. Yet, the results from Fig. 2 (g) and (h) demonstrate that all four SARS-CoV specific PCR products were amplified and detected as expected when sufficient amount of SARS-CoV RNA was used as the template. From the results shown in Fig. 3 (a-h) it can be clearly seen that in patients only 2 days post-onset of symptoms, no RNA from SARS-CoV was detected in their blood samples, whereas abundant copies of RNA from SARS-CoV were detected from these two patients' sputum specimens. These results imply that sputum is a good specimen for early detection of the presence of SARS-CoV. The results in Fig. 3 (i, j, m, n) showed that the earliest detection of RNA from SARS-CoV in blood specimen was 6 to 7 days post-onset of symptoms. From Fig. 3 (m-p) we can see that the presence of SARS-CoV in the blood increased dramatically 9 days after the onset of symptoms compared to the results obtained 7 days after the onset of symptoms.",

One of the patients who was 24 days post-onset of symptoms, still tested positive for the presence of SARS-CoV. Both blood and sputum samples from the remaining three patients were negative for SARS-CoV. ELISA tests were conducted on blood samples collected from these three patients, and the patients 9 days and 30 days post-onset of symptoms was found positive. It was incomprehensible that the gene chip test result did not match the ELISA result for the former patient 9 days post-onset of symptoms. However, both gene chip and ELISA results could be interpreted easily for the patient 30 days post-onset of symptoms, as the viral load may be reduced to zero 30 days after medical treatment according the time course study of the viral load (data not shown). The patient 15 days post-onset of symptoms tested negative with both ELISA test and gene chip could well be the misidentified non-SARS patient.",

One of the major advantages for adopting a gene chip based strategy is the multi-target analysis possible in a single test, which means higher throughput, sensitivity and higher specificity. When a single probe is used on the gene chip, the highest detection rate was 83.3%, which was approximately 8% lower than the rate (91.2%) when all four probes were used. So if only one target was chosen, such as the case for real-time PCR, a higher risk of false negative is inevitable. Although the agarose gel electrophoresis could be used to examine the RT-PCR amplicons, the results were inconclusive for clinical purposes because the sequence information of the amplicons is not available and hence false positive results may be produced.",

The results shown here, however, were from a primary study, which was designed to meet the requirements imposed by the SARS-crisis. In our modified PCR, only the universal primers, not the gene-specific primers, were labeled, which were designed initially for the multiplex amplification to avoid the preferential amplification in the ordinary multiplex PCR. Based on the success of the current study, an effort is underway to develop a multiplex nested RT-PCR. This will allow the separate nested RT-PCR reactions to be combined in a single reaction tube. Once this method is developed, the operation will be more convenient and faster and this gene chip based method could be transferred from research to a service setting and applied to the identification of other microorganisms.",
