This increase in salmonella resistance was observed when the interval between MHV and salmonella infections was 6 days, but not at 3, 10, or 14 day intervals . The mouse Ity locus, which controls the number of intracellular salmonella, had a significant effect on the ability of MHV to induce resistance to salmonella . MHV caused an increase in resistance to salmonella in ltyg (salmonella susceptible) mice at all doses of salmonella tested (100 to 10000 cfu) . In the lty' (salmonella resistant) mice tested the beneficial effect of MHV on salmonella resistance was small and when observed, was only present at salmonella doses of 10000 cfu or greater . Neither the Lpsd nor Xid mutations affected the ability of MHV to increase resistance to salmonella infection . In contrast to euthymic mice, MHV infection greatly decreased the resistance of athymic (nude) mice to salmonella infection . Since the Nu locus does not affect the resistance of mice to salmonella (at 4 days post salmonella infection), these results indicate that MHV infection and the nude phenotype interact to increase susceptibility to salmonella .",

We found that MHV infection of euthymic mice resulted in increased resistance (as defined by decreased numbers of salmonella in spleens and livers) to experimental salmonella infections when there was a 6 day interval between MHV and salmonella infections .

MHV-infected groups of A/JCr and BALB/cAnNCr mice received 100 plaque-forming units (pfu) of MHV intranasally, then 10000 salmonella colony-forming units (cfu) intravenously 3, 6, 10 or 14 days later .

When compared with control mice that received salmonella but no MHV, MHV-infected A/JCr and BALB/cAnNCr mice had significantly fewer salmonella in spleens and livers at a 6 day MHV-salmonella interval (largest effect in the BALB/cAnNCr mice), and MHV-infected A/JCr mice had significantly more salmonella in spleens and livers at a 3 day interval (Fig . 1 ) . Significant differences were not found at other intervals . This finding in A/JCr mice that a viral pathogen could decrease or increase resistance to a bacterial pathogen, depending on the interval between the viral and bacterial infections has been reported previously in mice given influenza virus and Listeria monocytogenes . 5 To determine whether or not the interval between salmonella infection and mouse sacrifice was important, groups of A/JCr and BALB/cAnNCr mice received 100 MHV pfu, then 10000 salmonella cfu 6 days later . In comparison with mice that received only salmonella, MHV-infected mice of both mouse strains had significantly fewer salmonella in spleens and livers 3, 4 and 5 days after salmonella infection (Fig . 2) .",

No dose of MHV was found that enhanced the resistance of nude mice to salmonella . In the 18week-old nu/nu mice, a dose of at least 10 -2 pfu was required to observe a detrimental effect of MHV on salmonella resistance, whereas in the 22-week-old mice a dose of at least 1 pfu was necessary . Eighteen-week-old mice that received 1 pfu or 10 -2 pfu of MHV and salmonella had higher mortality than mice that received the same doses of MHV alone, and 22-week-old nu/nu mice that received 10 -2 pfu of MHV and salmonella had higher mortality than mice given MHV alone . It appears that MHV alone was not responsible for the mortality seen in nudes receiving both MHV and salmonella, although at one of the four MHV doses that resulted in some mortality (the 1 MHV pfu dose in 22-week-old mice), mice that received MHV and salmonella had the same mortality as mice that received MHV only (Fig . 8) . infection .

An increase in salmonella resistance similar to that seen in the BALB/cAnNCr euthymic mice was also seen in BALB/cPt mice . Both of these BALB/c sublines have the ltys genotype, which makes them highly susceptible to salmonella infection by allowing rapid intracellular growth of S. typhimurium . When congenic ltyr mice were infected with the same regimen of MHV and S. typhimurium (100 pfu MHV, then 10000 salmonella cfu 6 days later), MHV did not significantly change their resistance to salmonella . Thus, it appears that for MHV to cause a change in resistance to salmonella, rapid salmonella growth must be present, suggesting that MHV may reduce the salmonella growth rate in /tys mice .",

However, in all of the latter /tyr strains, it was possible to see an MHV-mediated increase in resistance at higher salmonella doses . These results, and the data from the /tys mice, suggest an alternate hypothesis that the ability of MHV to alter resistance to salmonella in euthymic mice depends on the stage of inflammation or amount of inflammation present in internal organs (i .e . the more salmonella, the more inflammation), and that MHV could act by increasing the rate of salmonella killing . Distinguishing between these competing hypotheses (growth inhibition versus increased killing) will have to be addressed by further experimentation . We observed that at a 6 day MHV-salmonella interval A/JCr mice given 100 pfu MHV and 10000 salmonella cfu were significantly more resistant to salmonella than mice given only salmonella, while A/J (Jackson) mice given MHV and salmonella under identical conditions were not. This is probably due to unknown differences in the genotypes of the two sublines .",

Previous observations by others that MHV infections can result in macrophage activation\" -' 2 could account for the increase in resistance to S . typhimurium we found in euthymic mice . Because nude mice and thymectomized mice are more susceptible to MHV infection, 13 it appears that T cells or their lymphokines are necessary for macrophages to control successfully MHV infections, and perhaps become activated to resist salmonella infections . Accordingly, in the absence of functional T cells, macrophages in nude mice may be killed or functionally impaired by MHV infection, resulting in decreased resistance to salmonella infection .",

Thus, another possibility is that T cells contribute to the non-specific early resistance of normal mice to salmonella, and that in nude mice, anti-salmonella activities of macrophages and NK cells successfully compensate for the absence of functional T cells . Following this line of reasoning, M HV may stimulate T cell dependent immune functions in euthymic mice while adversely affecting non-T cell compensatory mechanisms of resistance to salmonella in nude mice . However, attempts by others to transfer salmonella resistance with immune T cells have generally failed .' 6, 17 It is well established that there are genetic differences between euthymic mouse strains that can influence their susceptibility to M HV infections .' 1-20 The exact hierarchy of mouse strain susceptibility to MHV depends on the MHV strain, but usually A/J mice are resistant, C57BL/6 (and sometimes BALB/c) mice are susceptible, and other mouse strains have intermediate susceptibilities . We have not yet quantitated the amount of MHV-UAB present in tissues of different strains of mice, and thus we do not know if MHV-UAB grows significantly better in some euthymic mouse strains than others . However, our Ity studies included the use of Ity congenic mice, and we feel that it is very unlikely that our results are due to differences in the ability of euthymic mouse strains to support viral replication .",

Points represent geometric means (\u00b1 SE) of salmonella cfu in spleens 4 days after salmonella infection . Asterisks indicate significant differences between experimental and control groups at P < 0 .05 . Fractions that appear beneath groups represent mortality before the sacrifice day (dead mice/total mice in group) . Top fraction, the experimental group (MHV and salmonella) ; bottom fraction in parentheses, mice that received the indicated MHV dose, but no salmonella . Dead mice were not included in the data except for the 18-week-old 10 pfu group in which dead mice (5 of 5) were assigned 108 spleen salmonella . (a) : Age = 18 weeks; (b) : age = 22 weeks.",

Data were analyzed by computer (Satistix II software package, NH Analytical Software, Roseville, MN) using the multifactorial analysis of variance (ANOVA) technique . Differences between group geometric means were considered to be significantly different when P was less than 0 .05 . In the event of significant factor interactions (P < 0 .05), differences between individual means were tested for significance with Scheffe's test .\"This work was supported in part by grants RR00463 and RR07003 from the Animal Resources Branch, Division of Research Resources, National Institutes of Health (NIH), and grant All 5986 from the National Institute for Allergy and Infectious Disease, NIH .
