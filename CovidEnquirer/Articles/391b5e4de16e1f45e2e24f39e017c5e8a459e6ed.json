This study reports the enteric infections with porcine astrovirus type 4 (PAstV4), porcine group A rotavirus (GARV), porcine group C rotavirus (GCRV), porcine circovirus type 2 (PCV2) and porcine kobuvirus (PKoV) in 419 pigs, comprising both healthy and diarrheic animals, from 49 farms in five European countries (Austria, Germany, Hungary, Spain and Sweden). Real-time RT-PCR assays were developed to test fecal samples and to compare the prevalence and viral load in relation to health status, farms of origin and age groups. The results showed that PAstV4 (70.4%) was the dominant virus species, followed by PKoV (56.7%), PCV2 (42.2%), GCRV (3%) and GARV (0.9%). Diarrheic pigs had a higher viral load of PAstV4 in the nursery and growing-finishing groups. Rotaviruses were mainly detected in diarrheic pigs, whereas PCV2 was more often detected in clinically healthy than in diarrheic pigs, suggesting that most PCV2 infections were subclinical. PAstV4, PCV2 and PKoV were considered ubiquitous in the European pig livestock and co-infections among them were frequent, independently of the disease status, in contrast to a low prevalence of classical rotavirus infections.",

Maintaining pig health and improving feed conversion rate are crucial to meet the increasing demand of food for a fast growing human population in the world. Certain highly contagious, transboundary diseases such as classical swine fever have been controlled and even eradicated from most European countries by different strategies including strict stamping-out policy, vaccination, and improved diagnosis and biosafety, resulting in a better health status of pigs in these countries. By contrast, endemic diseases are still present in spite of being managed by veterinarians and farmers. Among these pathological conditions, diarrhea in young pigs causes substantial economic losses due to increased mortality or morbidity with decreased growth and prolonged time for reaching market weight.",

            "text": "Pig diarrhea is a multi-factorial problem, also interpreted as a disease complex. Besides bacteria such as enterotoxigenic Escherichia coli (ETEC) and Clostridium perfringens types A and C, a number of viruses have been reported either causing or triggering the disease. Rotaviruses are one of the major classical causes of diarrhea in piglets (neonatal, nursery and post-weaning) as well as in many other species including humans. Rotaviruses are nonenveloped, double-stranded RNA viruses with a genome comprising 11 segments, and are divided into seven (A-G) antigenically distinct serogroups based on the serological characteristics of the membrane protein VP6. Serogroups A and C are the most frequent ones causing diarrhea in piglets. Group A rotavirus (GARV) is detected most frequently in pigs younger than 60 days of age (Chang et al., 2012) , with the highest prevalence at 3-5 weeks of age (Bohl, 1979) . By contrast, group C rotavirus (GCRV) is becoming dominant in diarrheic suckling piglets (less than 20 days of age) in the US (Marthaler et al., 2014) . Rotaviruses are transmitted primarily via fecal-oral route and viral infection is widespread in swine herds. The widely accepted mechanism of rotavirusinduced diarrhea in pigs and humans is related to villous atrophy with loss of intestinal absorptive cells (Chang et al., 2012) , which leads to malabsorption (Kapikian, 2001) .",

Porcine astrovirus (PAstV) belongs to the genus Mamastrovirus of the family Astroviridae. Astroviruses are non-enveloped and contain a single-stranded RNA genome. The viruses infect a broad range of hosts such as humans, cattle, sheep/goats, pigs, mink and bats, and are phylogenetically grouped into different lineages. Porcine astroviruses can be divided into five types 1-5 (PAstV1-PAstV5) (Indik et al., 2006; Laurin et al., 2011; Luo et al., 2011; Shan et al., 2011) . All five types of astroviruses have been reported in Europe (Brni c et al., 2013 (Brni c et al., , 2014 Machnowska et al., 2014; Monini et al., 2015; Reuter et al., 2011) . As astroviruses are found both in diarrheic and in healthy pigs, their role as a causative agent of pig diarrhea has not been unequivocally established. Similarly, a causal role of porcine kobuvirus (PKoV), a small picornavirus with a single-stranded RNA genome, in disease has yet to be defined despite a high prevalence of infection in diarrheic as well as in healthy pigs (Khamrin et al., 2009; Dufkova et al., 2013) .",

The quantification cycle (Cq) values were determined automatically by the software with manual adjustment. The values are defined as the number of cycles at which the fluorescence exceeded the threshold.

The four sets of primers and probes (Table 1) were finally selected for the multiplex assay, which was further evaluated for its sensitivity and specificity for detecting the four target porcine viruses. The analytical sensitivity of the multiplex assay was determined by testing the 10-fold dilution serials of the RNA standards. The assay was found to be able to detect 10-100 genome copies per reaction, showing a high sensitivity. The assay had a good repeatability and linearity in three independent runs. When tested with a limited number of known positive samples, the four dually labeled probes hybridized specifically to their target swine virus species/genotypes, and no cross-reactivity was observed. The MS2 assay did not perform well likely due to a low primer concentration and therefore, could not be used as an extrinsic control as initially planned. The two TaqMan real-time PCR assays for the detection of PCV2 and kobuvirus were evaluated in a less extent in terms of analytical sensitivity. When evaluated with the ten swine virus isolates, the three assays were found highly specific. In a subsequent metagenomic investigation of 12 Spanish samples, PAstV4 was confirmed in all these positive samples whereas PAstV1 was found in one of the seven samples that were tested PAstV1 positive by the multiplex assay. The results suggested, despite carefully designing of primers and probe for PAstV1, the multiplex assay was still lacking specificity for accurate detection of PAstV1. Therefore, PAstV1 data were not included in this report.

A multiplex quantitative real-time RT-PCR assay was initially developed in order to detect PAstV1, PAstV4, GARV and GCRV; and RNA standards were prepared for quantifying viral load in terms of genome equivalent copies. In addition, two single-plex real-time PCR assays were developed to detect PCV2 and PKoV. With a limited number of sequences available for designing primers and probes specific for the two types of astroviruses, it was hard to ensure that the assay initially developed would be able to detect \"specifically\" the target virus in an expanding range of new samples. Lack of type-specific virus isolates would make it even harder, which is opposite to the development of a real-time RT-PCR assay for detection of CSFV where reference pestiviral RNA panel and virus isolates of different genotype are available for validation (Liu et al., 2011b) . It is likely that the PAstV1 primers and/or probe shared high sequence similarity with other astroviruses, resulting in a low specificity, which was only revealed by a metagenomic approach. Therefore, despite the inclusion of PAstV1 primers/ probe in the multiplex assay, the data regarding PAstV1 were excluded from this report.",

The multiplex assay successfully detected PAstV4 in the five countries. Moreover, earlier studies have shown varying incidences of PAstV in pigs. In the USA, one study indicated a prevalence of 64% (n = 509) in pigs mainly coming from farms with a history of diarrhea (Xiao et al., 2013) and another reported a similar prevalence of 62% (n = 269) (Mor et al., 2012) . In contrast, only 19.4% (n = 129) of the domestic pigs from South Korea were positive for PAstV (Lee et al., 2013) . The observed difference might reflect different livestock density and farms' biosecurity measures. Despite high prevalence, there has been no strong evidence that PAstV can cause enteric disease associated with clinical signs. Only an oral infection of 4 day-old piglets with a cell culture grown PAstV1 resulted in mild diarrhea (Shimizu et al., 1990) .",

On the other hand, high viral load (up to 10 6 copies of PAstV4) was frequently detected in the 3-week-old Spanish piglets, resulting in high mean viral load in the suckling pig group (0-5 weeks).

Thus, differing from astroviruses, rotaviruses are considered to be major pathogens causing diarrhea in pigs despite the low incidence found in this study. Indeed, GCRV, which mainly affects piglets younger than 7 days of age, was found significantly associated with diarrhea (p < 0.05), with a 40-fold higher viral load in diarrheic pigs compared to healthy ones. It is likely to be the case for the six rotavirus-positive piglets (4-5 days old) in one German farm, but less likely for the six Spanish diarrheic pigs, which were 7-12 weeks old and co-infected with PAstV4.",

Indeed, a study demonstrating a causal role of PKoV in enteric disease in young pigs has not been published so far. Therefore, one might argue that PKoV could contribute to enteric disease only under certain conditions, which have yet to be defined. Still, the influence of PKoV should not be totally neglected. In the present study PKoV was demonstrated at rather equal incidences regardless of age, despite that a decrease of prevalence by age has been recorded in East Africa (Amimo et al., 2014) and in Italy, where the PKoV was detected only in 3.85% out of 280 fecal samples collected from healthy pigs aged between 6 and 10 months (Di Profio et al., 2013) . Unlike PKoV, it is established that PCV2 can contribute to several clinical diseases, including potential participation to enteric clinical disorders in nursery and growing-finishing pigs (Bar\u00f3 et al., 2015) . Despite significantly higher prevalence of PCV2positive pigs in the nursery and growing-finishing groups (p < 0.05), PCV2 was more frequently demonstrated in healthy pigs than in pigs with diarrhea. This suggests that most PCV2 infections were probably subclinical. Yet it would be interesting to elucidate the exact role of PCV2 infection in the apparently clinically healthy pigs.",

While GARV and GCRV were found in a small percentage of enteric infections, PAstV4 became the dominant virus species with high viral load in the investigated European farms, but the prevalence varied greatly depending on the country of farm origin. PKoV was found ubiquitous in all five countries and PCV2 was highly prevalent, especially in the Austrian and Spanish farms. Moreover, the prevalence of PAstV4 and PCV2 increased from the suckling age group to nursery and growing-finishing groups. The study provided valuable data for further clinical research particularly in the context of co-infections.",
