Thus, each animal species possesses a family of genes for interferon, and in some instances a single gene can give rise to mUltiple molecular forms. Also there are several ways in which production of these interferons can be induced. Finally, the antiviral effect is not due to a single cellular modification, blocking the virus at one particular junction in its replicative cycle. Rather, virus replication is counteracted at different steps. Another feature worth mentioning is that the interferon system is leaky blocking of virus replication or of the effects of viruses on the host is neither complete nor permanent. Therefore, if the virus host is placed under the protective influence of interferon, some virus replication still occurs, and as the interferon effect wanes, residual virus can again multiply at full strength unless this would be blocked by some other mechanism (e.g. specific immunity) which has been generated in the. meantime.",

True targeting of interferons can perhaps be accomplished by linking them to monoclonal antibodies in much the same way as is being done for chemotherapeutic agents. Evidence about the feasibility of this approach is slowly moving forward. Thus,Flannery et al. could  show that interferons bound to monoclonal antibodies against cells showed increased binding and required lower doses for antiviral activity to be achieved(14). Another possible way by which the pharmacokinetic properties of interferon may be modified is their encapsulation in liposomes. It has already been shown, for both HuIFN-a and -8 that such encapsulation can be achieved without loss of activity ()S).ANIMAL MODEL SYSTEMS I. General considerations An important reason why animal experiments have yielded rather unsatisfying preclinical information on the therapeutic potential of interferons, is probably that acute experimental viral infections are seldom faithful models of clinical infections in man. Unlike the natural situation in man, end-points for reading protective effects are often based on mortality; inoculation routes are unnatural (intraperitoneal, intracerebral, intravenous, scarification . of skin or cornea, ..\u2022 ), and doses of viruses are high to ensure high take-probability. Consequently, the conditions under which interferon therapy is to afford protection in the experimental situation are .often much less favorable than those occurring in nature. This is probably one of the reasons why unfavorable predictions from animal experiments have not been taken too seriously by those aiming at introducing interferon in the clinic. Another important consideration is that few if any good mouse models are available for two of the most daunting types of viral . infection in man : persistent recurrent infections (e.g. herpes viruses) and chronic active virus infec~ tions (e.g. hepatitis virus B). It may be argued that models for such diseases are available in other animal species. However, in using these models, one encounters the problem of non-availability of the homologous interferons. The new technology of molecular cloning has opened the possibility of producing virtually any interferon of any species at reasonable cost. However, in the meantime it has become accepted by the scientific community that human interferons are tested directly in humans without much pre-existing evidence of effectiveness from animal experiments. 2. Acute viral infections Results from experiments using systemic infections with a viremic phase, such as mengo virus, Semliki Forest virus, vaccinia virus, have indicated that the protective effect of interferon depends on the dose, frequency and time of administration of interferon but also on the dose of virus. For example, experimental infection of mice with mengo virus is characterized by early replication of the virus in the spleen (maximal on day 2) probably resulting in hematogenic spread and massive seeding of the brain, in which replication reaches maximal levels at day 4 (12). Replication in the spleen is accompanied by appearance of high levels of interferons both in the spleen itself and the serum. None of this early interferon is detectable in the brain. In fact, in this target organ, interferon appears only after, and probably as a result of local virus replication. It can be surmised that addition of exogenous interferon to this system will only be useful if conditions are such that it can exert its effect before spleen interferon is formed. Administration simultaneously with or after the peak time of spleen interferon can be expected to be of little use. These expectations were borne out by the experimental results. Protective effects were noted if the interferon treatment was started before any virus inoculation. Starting the treatment after virus inoculation was ineffective unless the dose of virus was lowered so as to delay onset and maximal replication of virus in the spleen. An example of an experimental virus infection which remains more localized is that obtained by intranasal inoculation of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV). The mice develop encephalitis as a result of restricted spread through the bulbus olfactorius. The results of experiments with this model were largely concordant with those of true systemic acute infections.",

The most striking examples in man are the human T-cell leukemia viruses (HTLV), hepatitis B virus (HB virus) and the herpesvirus (most notably Epstein-Barr virus). In each of these cases there is evidence that persistence of the virus in the body is due to the presence of viral genomes in an episomal or integrated state in some cells of the body (T-cells in the case of HTLV, hepatocytes in the case of HB virus, B-cells in the case of EBV). The expression of the genome, i.e. the formation of viral proteins and of proteins which are responsible for the malignant phenotype of cells, is regulated so that cells carrying the viral genomes are not destroyed by the immune system. There is no reason to assume that interferon may eradicate integrated viral genomes from cells. On the other hand, it is well established that, at the cellular level, interferon can affect the expression of retrovirus genomes",

            "text": "Contrary to old belief interferons have adverse effects on cells, tissues andorgans. The relatively late recognition of this fact(~ 1978)  is probably due to the apparent lesser sensitivity of experimental animals as opposed to man. Relatively low doses of interferon cause fever and malaise in man, while, in mice, doses that, on a body weight basis, are 10-fold or even 100-fold higher can be given without apparent toxicity. High doses of interferon (> 20 mega units/day) administered for long periods cause abnormalities in EEG patterns and, in some patients, desorientation and lethargy(20). Long-term administration of inter-feron may elicit symptoms of cumulative toxicity. Bone marrow suppression with relative leukopenia and thrombocytopenia occurs regularly in patients treated with various preparations of HuIFN-~, but is seldom a reason to interrupt the treatment. Alteration in immunological reactivity might change the clinical mani-festations of overt or latent immune disorders. Thus, there are indications from animal experiments that interferon may hasten the course of auto-immune disease (21) and there are anecdotal reports of increased rejection type reactivity in clinical trials. Young animals have been reported to be more sensitive to acute obnoxious effects of interferon : extensive hepatocyte necrosis and death occurs in newborn mice treated with high doses of interferon (22). Long-term topical treatment, e.g. nasal instillations, has also been shown not to be devoid of .adverse effects on the treated tissues (23). CLINICAL RESULTS I. Topical therapy The following rather commonly occurring conditions have been explored as possible targets for topical interferon therapy : acute adenovirus keratoconjunctivitis, recurrent herpetic keratitis, acute rhinoviral nasopharyngitis, condyloma accuminatum (chronic infection with human papilloma virus, HPV). Each of these are good examples to illustrate the assets and limitations of interferon in the clinic.Treatment of acute adenovirus keratoconjunctivitis (24) yields relatively good results, because the disease occurs in epidemics. Once an epidemic is recognized, risk groups can be identified and allerted. Under these conditions early diagnosis becomes easy, so that early therapy or even prophylactic treatment becomes feasible.",
