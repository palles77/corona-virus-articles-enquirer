On January 30, 2020, SARS-CoV-2 infection was declared as a global health emergency by World Health Organization (WHO). The mechanism of SARS-CoV-2 infection and organ invasion are unclear, which directly leads to difficulties and blindness in clinical diagnosis and treatment. We aim to detect SARS-CoV-2 nucleic acid from urine, blood, anal swab and oropharyngeal swab samples.
