However, a subset of patients does not respond to multiple controller medications, including omalizumab, and their asthma symptoms remain poorly controlled. This group of patients is labeled as having refractory asthma (RA) or severe asthma. 1-3 These patients experience a high level of morbidity because of the disease. Many of these patients require chronic systemic steroid therapy, which results in severe side effects and adds to the morbidity. Because of heavy use of health care services (emergency department and hospital), patients with RA account for a disproportionately higher health care cost. 2 It is estimated that about 3% to 10% of patients have severe RA. [2] [3] [4] [5] The treatment options for RA are limited, primarily because of the lack of understanding of its mechanisms.",

            "text": "Asthma is a heterogeneous disease. Based on clinical and laboratory findings, asthma has been variably classified as atopic versus nonatopic asthma, eosinophilic versus neutrophilic versus noneosinophilic/nonneutrophilic asthma, obesity-associated asthma, 3 asthma/chronic obstructive pulmonary disease overlap syndrome, 6 T H 2-high asthma, 7 T H 2/T H 17-high asthma, 8 and T H 2-low asthma, 7, 8 for example. Severe asthma and RA can occur within each category of patients. It is unclear whether a single or multiple mechanisms are operating in patients with severe RA. Previous studies have identified a number of factors in patients with severe asthma. Heightened activation of type 1 (T H 1, the interferon pathway), 9 type 2 (T H 2 cells, type 2 CD8 T cells), 7 11 and airway neutrophilia 12 have all been implicated in patients with RA. Levels of the type 3 cytokines IL-17A and IL-17F are increased in asthmatic patients. 8, 13 However, they were not associated with levels of T H 17 cytokines in human asthma nor were they associated with neutrophilic asthma, [13] [14] [15] which is unlike what has been reported in the mouse model of asthma. 16 Increased epithelial injury, smooth muscle hyperplasia and hypertrophy, and airway remodeling are some of the recognized intrinsic factors of RA. 1, 2 The external factors associated with RA include heightened exposure to sensitizing allergens, 17, 18 air pollution, 19, 20 and infections. [21] [22] [23] Heightened levels of select cytokines/inflammatory mediators were associated with many of the foregoing subgroups of RA. 23, 24 Despite progress in the field, there is a need to examine the precise molecular mechanism of heterogeneity of RA that allows development of targeted therapeutic interventions. To address this matter, we studied 60 patients with RA 3 and compared them with 30 patients with nonrefractory asthma (NRA) and 20 healthy control subjects. Bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid and serum were analyzed for 244 biomolecules, levels of which were then correlated with the clinical and laboratory features of asthma. The latter included pulmonary function, PC 20 for methacholine, allergic sensitivity, fraction of exhaled nitric oxide (FENO), body mass index, blood eosinophil counts, total IgE levels, BAL fluid inflammatory cell counts (eosinophil, neutrophil, lymphocyte, and macrophage counts), indices of airway tissue inflammation (quantitative histologic evaluation of bronchial tissue) and basement thickness, and the results of microbiological studies with BAL, tissue biopsy, and airway brushing. The focus of this article is on the neutrophilic phenotype of RA.",

For this reason, we analyzed data with and without inclusion of patients receiving oral corticosteroids (OCSs). BAL fluid neutrophil counts were increased in both infection-positive and infection-negative patients with RA regardless of their OCS use compared with healthy control subjects (Fig 1, A) . Blood neutrophil counts were also increased in both infection-positive and infection-negative patients with RA when the data were analyzed for the entire group (Fig 1, B) . However, this increase was lost in the blood but not BAL fluid (Fig 1, C and D) in the infection-negative RA group when the patients receiving OCSs were excluded from analysis. The results suggest that blood neutrophilia in infection-negative patients with RA was caused by OCSs. Strikingly, the absolute neutrophil number remained increased in the infection-positive RA group, even when the patients receiving OCSs were excluded from the analysis. The results indicate that an increase in absolute neutrophil counts could serve as a blood biomarker for airway infection in patients with RA.

Our understanding of the role of inhaled steroids in patients with airway neutrophilia is incomplete. A previous study showed that systemic but not inhaled steroids were associated with tissue neutrophilia. 39 However, this study was done with a small number of patients, and the result showed a trend for increased airway neutrophil counts with inhaled steroids. Both patients with NRA and those with RA were receiving inhaled steroids in our study. However, unlike patients with RA, not all patients with NRA received maximal doses of inhaled steroids. Thus it is possible that higher doses of inhaled steroids in patients with RA contributed to some extent to airway neutrophilia. Environmental toxicants frequently induce cytokines/chemokines that can elicit low-level neutrophilic inflammation. 40 There could be a cumulative effect during aging. The T H 17 immune response induces neutrophilic inflammation in animal models. 16 Our assay did not detect IL-17, likely because of the low sensitivity of the assay. However, the assay detected increased levels of multiple proneutrophilic biomolecules, including SAA, NAP2, thrombospondin 1, IL-6, IL-8, C3, CCL3, CCL20, epidermal growth factor, and receptor for advanced glycosylation end products. All except the last 3 significantly correlated with BAL fluid neutrophil counts. SAA induces granulocyte colony-stimulating factor and stimulates neutrophil generation. 41 It also induces T H 17. 42 IL-6 is an inducer of T H 17 43 and a marker of systemic inflammation. 44 NAP2, IL-8, C3, and CCL3 directly induce neutrophilic inflammation. [45] [46] [47] [48] C3 also induces IL-1, IL-8, and other cytokines/chemokines, which could indirectly affect neutrophilic inflammation. 48 Some of our findings on biomolecules are in agreement with those of many previous studies. Similar to our finding, IL-1b and IL-6 discriminated severe from moderate asthma in a SARP study. 25 IL-8 levels have previously been reported to be increased in sputum 49, 50 and BAL fluid 51 from patients with RA and neutrophilic asthma.",

Our study identified a unique subgroup of infection-negative patients with neutrophilic RA, which was selectively associated with increased markers of inflammation in serum. These markers included IL-1b, IL-6, IL-8, CXCL1, and CCL3. The concomitant increase in C-reactive protein levels in the same patients suggested a systemic inflammatory process akin to what has been observed in patients with atherosclerotic cardiovascular 52 and autoinflammatory 53 diseases. Remarkably, this subgroup of patients also had increases in 2 additional cardiovascular risk factors: GDF-15 54 and soluble ST2 (IL-33 receptor). 52 We recognize that the latter is a nonspecific biomarker of systemic inflammation. Four (11%) of 36 (11%) infection-negative patients with neutrophilic RA and 5 (21%) of 24 infection-positive patients with neutrophilic RA had a history of cardiovascular disease. Therefore the frequency of existing cardiovascular disease did not explain the systemic (serum) increase in levels of these inflammatory cytokines. We also did not find any correlation of these inflammatory cytokines with other common comorbidities: diabetes and autoimmune disorders.",

Type 2 cytokines inhibit IL-8 and other proneutrophilic cytokines, 58 which could explain the lack of neutrophilia.

However, the pattern of change was different from that in BAL fluid. Four of these biomolecules showed reduced expression in patients with NRA but not in those with RA when compared with expression in healthy control subjects. The reason for this reduced expression in patients with NRA but not those with RA is not clear. Ficolin 3 is the only biomolecule in the serum that distinguished RA from NRA. Ficolin 3 is a recognition molecule of the lectin pathway of the complement system. Its deficiency is associated with increased infection. 59 If subclinical infection is one of the mechanisms of RA in a subgroup of patients, its importance can be tested through targeted and bacterial strain-specific antibiotic therapy. We are aware that antibiotic therapy of patients with RA produced mixed results in the past. 60, 61 The failure of antibiotic therapy in some studies could be due to inappropriate selection of study patients (eg, inclusion of patients who did not have any infection) and use of an inappropriate antibiotic. 3 Note that we detected both gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria, as well as viruses, in patients with RA. The results underscore the importance of the selection of an appropriate antibiotic (targeting gram-positive vs gram-negative bacteria) and its application to a properly identified target patient population. If low-level systemic inflammation is indeed the cause of airway neutrophilia in infection-negative patients with RA, this hypothesis can be tested by using therapeutic agents targeting molecules, such as IL-1, IL-6, and IL-8. Some of these therapeutic agents are already in use in patients with rheumatologic conditions. The number of CD117 1 cells representing mostly mast cells was reduced in patients with RA. Reduced numbers of tryptase-positive cells representing mast cells in patients with severe asthma was previously reported in a SARP study. 62 This was thought to be due to the loss of tryptase as a consequence of mast cell degranulation. However, unlike tryptase, CD117 is a cell-surface marker and not a granular protein and is not expected to be affected by mast cell degranulation. It is possible that the reduced CD117 1 cell number is a consequence of the underlying disease process.",
