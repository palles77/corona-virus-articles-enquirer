This transition is happening at the same time as a dramatic increase in our knowledge of infectious diseases, including new understanding of the etiology of diarrhea1 disease. Ten years ago, the etiology of enteric disease in many patients was unknown because stool specimens were routinely screened only for Salmonella spp., Shigella spp., and perhaps intestinal parasites such as Giardia lamblia. At present, many laboratories also routinely examine stool specimens for Campylobacter spp., Yersinia entero-colitica, Clostridiutn difficile, Cryptosporidium, and rotavirus. Aeromonas spp. (l), Vibrio spp. (4, 5), strains of Escherichia coli (6, (17) (18) (19) , Norwalk agent, enteric adenoviruses, coronaviruses, and caliciviruses (8) have also been suggested as causes of diarrhea1 disease; food poisoning agents such as Staphylococcus aureus and Bacillus cereus must also be considered. Faced with declining resources and expanding knowledge, what approaches should be taken to provide efficient, yet comprehensive, diagnostic services to patients with diarrhea1 disease?",

For the most efficient use of laboratory facilities, as well as maximum benefit to the patient, a selective examination process must be followed based on factors such as patient age and history, as well as the clinical microbiologist's understanding of the pathogenesis and local epidemiology of diarrhea1 disease. Figure 1 presents an algorithm that can be used as a guideline to determine how to examine stool specimens from different patient populations. This algorithm divides patients according to age, whether those older than 3 yr are inpatients or outpatients, and whether they have received antimicrobial agents or cancer chemotherapeutics. Stools from patients who have currently or recently received antimicrobial agents or cancer chemotherapeutics should be examined only for C. d@cile toxin because studies have shown that, in such patients, other enteric pathogens are rarely, if ever, present (9). Tests for detecting C. di'cile toxin must be done instead of culture because up to 20% of people receiving antimicrobial agents are asymptomatic carriers of the organism (24). On the other hand, only 2% of patients have toxin in the absence of symptoms. Toxin is detected in the feces of approximately 30% of patients with antimicrobial agent-associated diarrhea and essentially all patients with pseudomembranous colitis (3). Tissue culture assay remains the standard test for toxin detection. Alternative methods such as counterimmunoelectrophoresis ( 12) and latex agglutination (2 I) lack sufficient sensitivity and specificity; ELISA tests (13), although accurate, are not yet widely available.",

For diagnosis, a rotavirus ELISA test is usually the first step because the results are often available within 24 hr. The specimen can be refrigerated and further tests deferred until the rotavirus test result is known. If the test is negative, the fecal screen outlined previ-ously can be performed.
