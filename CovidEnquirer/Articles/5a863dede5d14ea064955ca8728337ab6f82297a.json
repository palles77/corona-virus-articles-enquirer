Proteolytic activation of caspase-8 leads to dissociation of the DISC and activation of effector caspases (e.g. caspase-3,-6 and -7). Viruses from many different viral families inhibit the extrinsic pathway at different stages by mimicking TNF receptors and acting as decoys (such as CrmB from cowpox virus and MT-2 from Myxoma virus), by mimicking cellular inhibitors of caspase-8 activation (vFLIPs such as MC159 from Molluscum Contagiosum virus), and by inhibiting the proteolytic activity of caspase-8 (CrmA from cowpox virus) [2] .",

The intrinsic pathway is regulated by the Bcl-2 family of proteins, which control a checkpoint preventing the disruption of the mitochondrial outer membrane (MOM). MOM permeabilisation leads to the release of several apoptogenic proteins from the intermembrane space including cytochrome c. Upon release from mitochondria cytochrome c induces formation of the apoptosome in association with Apaf-1 and pro-caspase 9, leading to caspase-9 activation [1] . Direct inhibition of caspases by cellular Inhibitors of Apoptosis (IAPs) has also been found as a viral strategy although this seems to be limited to insect cells. IAPs were first characterised in the Baculovirus family, which express OpIAP and CpIAP [3] . Entomopoxviruses also express viral IAP's such as MsEPV and AmEPV [4] .",

Techniques to induce MOM permeabilisation by interfering with pro-survival members of the intrinsic pathway are predominantly found within the RNA viruses. Vpr from Human immunodeficiency virus-1 (HIV-1) acts at mitochondria to induce swelling and MOM permeabilisation in lymphoid cells. Bcl-2 has been reported to inhibit Vpr induced MOM permeabilisation, however this process seems to be cell type dependent [5, 6] . Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) 7a protein has been reported to directly inhibit Bcl-X L pro-survival activity, along with its ability to bind all other pro-survival members ( Fig. 1) [7] . Like other intrinsic forms of cellular stress, viral proteins may lead to BH3-only protein activation. Tat protein from HIV-1 is capable of inducing apoptosis by causing the disassociation of Bim from the cytoskeleton, where Bim is sequestered in healthy cells (Fig. 1 ) [8] . Interferon 1 production in response to vesicular stomatitits viral infection has been shown to induce expression of pro-apoptotic Noxa [9] .",

Interestingly, while some vBcl-2s such as E1B19K are clear sequence homologues of cellular Bcl-2-like proteins, others share little primary sequence homology with their mammalian homologues. However, the crystal structure of some of these functional Bcl-2 homologues reveals conservation of the Bcl-2 family structural conformation. Examination of the latter class of vBcl-2 proteins now allows us to revisit the role of the conserved amino acids in the BH1, BH2, and BH3 domains of the pro-survival members as originally defined. The most highly conserved of these regions is the BH3 domain present in all members of the cellular Bcl-2 family of proteins. vBcl-2s allow us to question the strict requirement for the Bcl-2 prosurvival proteins to contain BH domains, including the core BH3 domain, to function. For example, Adenovirus E1B19K and African Swine Fever Virus (ASFV) A179L retain homology to all BH domains [12] . In contrast, FPV039 from Fowlpoxvirus only retains sequence homology with the BH1 and BH2 domains while Orf-125 of Parapoxvirus retains most sequence homology at the BH1 and BH3 [9, 13, 14] . Other vBcl-2's such as Vaccinia virus F1 and N1, Myxoma virus M11L and vMIA from Cytomegalovirus do not retain any significant homology to the BH domains found in mammalian Bcl-2's [9] . Therefore, vBcl-2s show that overall sequence homologies, and the sequence of the BH domains, are not strict requirements for the pro-survival function of Bcl-2 like proteins. Rather, they emphasize the requirement for their helical bundle structure.",

            "text": "vBcl-2s, like their mammalian counterparts, have been shown to vary in their anti-apoptotic potency. The variation in pro-survival potency of vBcl-2s and mammalian Bcl-2s has been debated and there is still no agreement [15, 16] . These different results are possibly due to differences in cell types used, protein expression levels or variations in apoptotic stimuli used to assess pro-survival function. While proteins such as Bcl-2, Bcl-X L and E1B19K are considered strong inhibitors of apoptosis, others such as N1, Bcl-w, and A1 are considered weak pro-survival members when over-expressed [17] . Two studies that compared the pro-survival activity of According to a prevalent model, upon an apoptotic stimulus the BH3-only proteins (Bim, Noxa, Bid, Puma, Bmf, Bad) are induced or activated. They subsequently translocate to the mitochondria to inhibit the pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins (Bcl-2, Bcl-X L , Bcl-w, Mcl-1). Upon sequestration of pro-survival Bcl-2 proteins by BH3-only proteins, the pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins Bak and Bax located in the outer mitochondrial membrane undergo structural rearrangements of their N-terminus, leading to their oligomerisation. The viral activators (pink) and inhibitors (purple) of apoptosis sequestering this pathway target specific subsets of Bcl-2 proteins, for details see text. Black lines indicate the cellular apoptotic pathway, red lines indicate viral inhibition, and red arrows indicate activation. (For interpretation of the references to color in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of this article.) cellular pro-survivals and vBcl-2s have contradicted each other regarding the pro-survival activity of these proteins. Huang et al. describe the vBcl-2 E1B19K and the mammalian pro-survivals Bcl-2 and Bcl-X L as functionally equivalent by assessing different cell types and stimuli. In contrast, Cross et al. define the vBcl-2s E1B19K and BHRF1 as more efficient inhibitors of apoptosis than their mammalian homologues Bcl-2 and Bcl-X L [15, 16] .",

A recent report has suggested a similar alternative interaction to the typical sequestration of Bax BH3 domain for Bcl-X L [19] . Preferential inhibition of Bak has been reported for F1, although the interacting domains between these two proteins are still debated ( Fig. 1) [20, 21] . Apoptotic inhibition by the sequestration of BH3-only proteins by vBcl-2s has been reported for A179L by binding both Bim and Noxa, and Orf-125 through binding of all tested BH3-only proteins ( Fig. 1) [9, 12, 13] .",

Upon apoptotic signalling both Bak and Bax undergo conformational changes at their N-termini and oligomerise to permeabilise the MOM. Oligomerisation of Bax and Bak occurs via interactions involving the BH3 domain of the Bax or Bak monomers in a process that precedes, and directly allows for, the release of cytochrome c [22, 23] . E1B19K, BHRF1 and M11L have all been reported to bind both Bax and Bak, but despite the observation that they have the same binding partners, the stages at which these proteins bind Bak and Bax are distinct [16, 24] . M11L has been reported to bind both Bak and Bax by sequestering their BH3 domain [24] . BHRF1 inhibits Bak and Bax N-terminal exposure when both pro-apoptotic members are localised to mitochondria (Fig. 1) [16] . N-terminal exposure of Bak and Bax is a process that precedes the exposure of the BH3 domain, therefore suggesting an alternative form of binding between the vBcl-2s and the pro-apoptotic members [22, 23] . In contrast, E1B19K has been reported to inhibit the oligomerisation of Bak and Bax, a process that also involves Bak and Bax BH3 domain sequestration (Fig. 1) [16] .",

The Rig-like helicase (RLH) family includes RIG-I, MDA5, and LGP-2. RIG-I and MDA5 both contain two caspase recruitment domains (CARDs), an ATPase and a helicase domain. Both use their helicase domains to recognise distinct viral nucleic acids. MDA5 is the main cytoplasmic receptor for longer viral dsRNA molecules. RIG-I on the other hand can be activated by short dsRNA fragments, as well as ssRNAs that have a 5' triphosphate [25] . Interestingly, these characteristics appear to explain why host RNAs are not recognised by either sensor protein: host RNA either have their 5' capped or contain monophosphates, and long dsRNA is only present in the context of viral infection. After binding of the RNA with their helicase domain, activated RIG-I and MDA5 use their CARD domains to bind the mitochondrion-located adaptor protein IPS-1 (also known as MAVS, VISA or Cardif). Recently, an additional adaptor protein localised to the ER and mitochondrial outer membrane, called MITA (or STING), was identified to recruit TBK1 and IRF3 to IPS-1 and thus enhance RIG-I specific signalling [29] . Via IPS-1 RLH signalling converges with the IKK a,b,g and IKK3/TBK1 complexes leading to activation of the NF-kB and IRF3,7 transcription factors.",

The CARD domain NOD family, the pyrin domain (PYD) NALP family and the baculovirus inhibitory repeat (BIR) domain NAIP family [31] . These proteins are thought to maintain an auto-inhibitory interaction between a NOD domain and a C-terminal LRR domain to prevent spontaneous activation. Upon PAMP binding to their LRR domains, the NLR proteins oligomerize and expose their N-terminal domains to recruit effector proteins. The NOD family proteins recruit the kinase RICK via their CARD domains, leading to MAPK and NF-kB activation. The NALP family proteins recruit the adaptor ASC to their PYD domain, leading to the recruitment of pro-caspase-1 and it's processing to caspase-1. Caspase-1 recruitment by ASC association has also been shown to be further induced by the interferon H1N-200 family member AIM2 (abscent in melanoma 2), due to its newly described NALP-like activity [32] . Caspase-1-activating complexes are called inflammasomes, and each inflammasome is designated according to the NLR within it [33] . The NLR system appears to in part work in concert with other pathogen detectors. For instance, PAMPs may engage the TLR-NF-kB pathway leading to pro-IL-1b production. Pro-IL-1b is then cleaved to IL-1b, a strong pro-inflammatory cytokine, by caspase-1 produced by inflammasome activation [34] . In addition, inflammasome activation can also contribute to pathogen-induced cell death in ways that are not well characterised (e.g. pyroptosis, see Duprez et al. in this issue) [35, 36] .",

Another poxvirus, myxoma virus, encodes M13L, a PYD domain containing inhibitor of caspase-1 activation [38] . M13L is thought to compete with PYD-containing NLRs by binding ASC. Curiously, many NLR ligands are bacterial PAMPs, yet despite the fact that viral infection can induce IL-1b processing, few viral PAMPs that activate inflammasomes have thus far been discovered [27] . Mirroring this, few viral NLR or inflammasome inhibitors are known to date. Is this perhaps an indication of a fundamental difference in the way bacteria and viruses are sensed by inflammasomes?

However, recent evidence suggests that, at least under certain conditions, anti-viral immunity could benefit from infected cells dying by other programmed, but non-apoptotic forms of cell death that lead to release of proinflammatory cell content into the extracellular milieu. [36] . NLR proteins have emerged as regulators of such infectioninduced, pyrogenic forms of cell death, in part through inflammasome-mediated caspase-1 activation [35] . Caspase-1 processing produces mature IL-1b, but its substrates in the mediation of non-apoptotic cell death remain unclear. Interesting further similarities and cross-talk between inflammasome and cell death components have been described. For instance, the inflammasome shares characteristics with the apoptosome structure made up of Apaf-1 and caspase-9 (Fig. 2) . Apaf-1 is maintained in an inactive state through the auto-inhibitory interactions of its C-terminal WD40 domains with the nucleotide-binding domain (NBD). Following cytochrome c release from the mitochondria the inhibition is relieved and Apaf-1 and pro-caspase-9 form the heptameric wheel-like apoptosome structure [35] . NLR proteins are structurally similar to Apaf-1, with C-terminal LRR domains instead of WD40 repeats, and are similarly activated by the release of an auto-inhibitory interaction [35] .",

The adaptor ASC, an essential component of the inflammasome, facilitates p53-dependent cell death through activation of Bax, possibly at the mitochondria (Fig. 2) [39] . It is worth noting however, that the involvement of BH3-only proteins like Bim and Puma, which are also induced by p53, was not assessed in these studies (Fig. 2) [1] . Lastly, the pro-survival proteins Bcl-2 and Bcl-X L have recently been found to bind the NLR protein NALP1 and thus suppress the NALP1 inflammasome, leading to reduced caspase-1 activation and IL-1b production (Fig. 2 ) [40] . While it is not yet known which sub-cellular pool of these Bcl-2 proteins is involved in inflammasome interactions, it certainly raises the prospect of the NLR signalling pathway being regulated from the mitochondria (Fig. 2) . Future work will undoubtedly elaborate on the role the Bcl-2 family plays in NLR signalling, especially since the ASC-Bax and Bcl-2-NALP1 interactions suggest competing roles of the Bcl-2 proteins in the regulation of the inflammasome. As discussed, many viruses contain sequence and structural Bcl-2 Fig. 2 . Cell death and innate immunity are intimately linked. ASC induction by p53 is capable of inducing Bax dependent apoptosis, hence leading to the formation of the apoptosome along with formation of the inflammasome. Similarities in the diagrammatic representation of the inflammasome and apoptosome are suggestive of the structural similarities between both molecular complexes. Indications of the BH3-only proteins (Bim, Puma, and Noxa) p53 mediated transcriptional control and possible interactions with Bax (depicted by the dashed arrow) highlight weaknesses in the ASC/Bax interaction pathway (see text). Bcl-2 plays a direct role in the inhibition of Bak/Bax activation and inflammasome formation by Nalp1. Findings regarding the innate and apoptotic inhibitory effect of vBcl-2s raise the question of whether these proteins may also be able to inhibit the inflammasome cascade.

Intriguingly, these inhibitors of TLR and RLH signalling have the same structural helical bundle fold as the Bcl-2 family while neither have anti-apoptotic activity [41] . In line with this feature, B14 and A52 do not contain a hydrophobic groove that could accommodate BH3 peptides from pro-apoptotic Bcl-2 proteins. Both proteins belong to a family that includes vaccinia proteins A46, N1, C6, C16 and K7, some of which are proven innate signalling inhibitors, and it was proposed that these may all have a Bcl-2 structural fold [41] . Indeed, the structure of K7 was recently shown to have such a fold [42] .",

Possibly its weak apoptotic activity is explained by vaccinia-induced apoptosis being predominantly Bak-dependent, though this remains unexplored. Interestingly, N1 is also an inhibitor of TRAF6 and the IKK3/TBK1 complex, making it the only known vaccinia Bcl-2-like protein that inhibits both the intrinsic apoptotic pathway and some of the innate immunity pathways [43] .",
