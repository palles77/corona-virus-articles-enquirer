As week dragged into week, the garb of goggles, gowns, gloves, caps, booties, and the hated N-95 masks progressively drained faculty and senior residents of the energy required to engage medical students and residents. As friends became sick and physicians found themselves quarantined from families, morale plummeted, stripping enthusiasm for clinical responsibilities, including bedside teaching. All of these factors contributed to a morale in which the teaching environment was suboptimal. Given the circumstances, it is difficult to imagine how anyone could maintain a productive teaching environment during a sustained epidemic of more than 4 months.",

On the fifth day, another anesthetist insisted on absolute SARS precautions, despite the elective nature of the case. Once I passed the tube through the white target, I attached the tubing and put down the laryngoscope-only to be upbraided by a voice from over my shoulder. ''You just contaminated the ventilator, and the tape too!'' I looked down at the ring of salmon pink cupped in my tainted hand, impressed that this step had become instinctive already. I changed my gloves, as instructed, and with his eyes on my own, the anesthetist leaned over the lax head of the patient to turn on the ventilator. I hadn't perceived the alarm, having been disrupted from the tenuous sequence of my new induction skills. Later, I found a former priest-turnedanesthetist who had worked for many years in Africa; his view of life afforded him peace of mind in these times, and me the ability to learn airway management.",

[12] [13] [14] [15] Some experts suspect that the cancellation of elective cases and a decline in walk-ins led to an overall decrease in the number of patients seen in Toronto EDs during the SARS epidemic. 16 If this was the case, it would offset some of the crowding precipitated by the closure of other EDs in the city. However, this was likely site-dependent, because we suspect that hospitals closer to those with ED closures bore the brunt of redirected patients, whereas more distant centers experienced less impact. Subsequently, medical students and residents at the former sites enjoyed less teaching time than those at the latter hospitals.",

Yet, the education of future physicians in the midst of an epidemic is not an issue that we can afford to dismiss. The balance between the educational necessity of direct patient contact and exposure of practitioners-in-training to lethal diseases without established transmission mechanisms will have to be evaluated. From the loss of formal educational sessions to the time required to treat patients in isolation to the disenchantment of altered job descriptions, these factors need to be acknowledged in order to conceive of potential means of mitigation.
