In situ hybridization of Ark99 infected tissue sections using 32p-dATP labelled probe indicated that more viral replication was present in the trachea on day 4 than either days 2 or 6; whereas more viral RNA was found in the lungs on day 6 than days 2 or 4 after inoculation.",

Infection with IBV causes a highly contagious, respiratory disease in chickens with high mortality in young chicks (Hofstad, 1984) . In addition to the upper and lower respiratory tract, IBV also affects the genital and urinary tracts and has been isolated from many tissues, including the lung, trachea, cecal tonsils, kidneys, Harderian (paraocular) glands and spleen (Hofstad, 1984) . In laying flocks, IBV infection can cause complete cessation in egg production or production 0378-1135/90/$03.50 of thin-shelled, rough and misshapen eggs, and in broilers, infection can result in decreases in feed consumption (Hofstad, 1984) .",

The allantoic fluid was harvested and clarified, and the virus precipitated with a final concentration of 10% polyethyleneglycol-6000 in 2.3% sodium chloride overnight at 4\u00b0C, banded on a 30 to 50% glycerol-potassium tartrate gradient and concentrated by ultracentrifugation. Virus was treated with proteinase K and sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS), and the RNA was extracted with phenol and 0.3 M sodium acetate, pH 5, and concentrated with ethanol (Niesters et al., 1986) . A modification of the dot blot procedure described by Kafatos et al. (1979) and Schleicher & Schuell, Inc. (Keene, NH) was used. Briefly, the RNA was pretreated with formaldehyde, formamide and sodium phosphate buffer (PBS). After heating to 65\u00b0C for 10 min, SSC (0.15 M sodium chloride, 15 mM sodium citrate, pH 7 ) was added to a 15 \u00d7 final concentration. Four-fold serial dilutions of RNA starting with an equivalent of 1 #g of RNA were blotted onto nitrocellulose, pretreated with 20X SSC, (Maniatis et al., 1982 ) with a Bio-Dot Apparatus (Bio-Rad, Richmond, CA ) manifold. After baking at 80 \u00b0 C under a vacuum for 2 h, the samples were prehybridized for 4 h at 37\u00b0C in 50% formamide, 5 \u00d7 Denhardt's solution, 0.1% SDS, 150 #g//A calf thymus DNA and 5 X SSC (Maniatis et al., 1982 ) and hybridized for 24 h at 37 \u00b0C in the prehybridization solution with 106 cpm/ml of probe labeled by nick-translation with 32-alpha dATP (Maniatis et al., 1982; Berger and Kimmel, 1987) . The blot was washed with 2\u00d7SSC and 0.1% SDS twice at room temperature and twice at 37\u00b0C, and once at 56\u00b0C and twice with 0.2\u00d7 SSC and 0.1% SDS at 56 \u00b0C. After drying at 56 \u00b0C, the blot was autoradiographed.",

They represent diverse pathotypes; attenuated and virulent strains, and the known nephropathogenic strains, Gray and AustT. The broad specificity of this probe was predictable since it contains the majority of the coding sequences for the nucleocapsid protein which has been shown by Western blot analysis to be antigenically highly conserved among these same strains (Boursnell et al., 1984; Sneed et al., 1989) . Viral replication could also be detected in the in situ cytohybridization assays with the T68 probe in cultured cells infected with the Mass41, Ark99 and SE 17 strains, and in tissues of chicks experimentally infected with Mass41 and Ark99. Mass41, Ark99 and SE 17 also represent genetically diverse viruses since antigenic differences have been detected by neutralization and hemagglutination assays which depend on differences in the peplomer proteins (Darbyshire et al., 1979; King and Hopkins, 1983; Cavanagh et al., 1984; Mockett et al., 1984) and by Western blot analysis which identified differences in the membrane proteins (Sneed et al., 1989 ) .

Viral replication could be detected as early as 2 days after infection in both the trachea and lungs. Virus has been routinely isolated from these tissues and ciliary activity and immunofluorescent assays have been used to demonstrate virus in the trachea (Braune and Gentry, 1965; Darbyshire et al., 1979) . The cytohybridization assay identified viral RNA in epithelial cells of tracheas from chicks infected with either Mass41 or Ark99, but in addition, larger numbers ofchondrocytes in the trachea were found to support viral replication. Since chondrocytes from the infected trachea taken during an outbreak of IBV were similarly infected, the involvement of these cells in the cartilage would appear to be a common feature of IBV infection. In the lungs, IBV infection appeared to be located in epithelial cells.",

The greatest concentration of virus in the trachea was seen on day 4 and in the lung on day 6, that is, the last day examined. Since the trachea would presumably be exposed to virus before the lung in birds exposed after nasal inoculation, viral replication may be expected to be established in the trachea first. We are now extending this work by examining infectivity before 2 days and after 6 days p.i. to determine the early events in virus-host interaction and the persistence of virus not only in the trachea and lungs, but also in additional tissues, including the cecal tonsils and kidneys.",
