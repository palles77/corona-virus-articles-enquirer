Despite its worldwide distribution, very little information is known about BNoV in Africa. In this study, BNoV was detected in 27.6% (8/29) of tested fecal materials, collected from sporadic cases of diarrheic calves, using the reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and primers that target RNA dependent RNA polymerase gene. Additionally, one primer pair was designed to flank the BNoV-VP2 (small capsid protein) gene for molecular analysis. Study VP2 sequences were phylogenetically-related to BNoV-GIII.2 (Newbury2-like) genotype, which is highly prevalent all over the world. However, they were separated within the cluster and one strain (41FR) grouped with recombinant GIII.P1/GIII.2 strains. Compared to reference VP2 sequences, 14 amino acid substitution mutations were found to be unique to our strains. The study confirms that BNoV is currently circulating among diarrheic calves of Egypt and also characterizes its ORF3 (VP2) genetically. The status of BNoV should be continuously evaluated in Egypt for effective prevention and control.",

The viral genome is 7.3 to 7.5 kb in size and consists of three open reading frames (ORF1, ORF2, and ORF3), which encode for large polyprotein, major capsid protein (VP1) and small basic protein (VP2), respectively [7] . Based on the phylogeny of deduced amino acids (aa) of VP1 protein, noroviruses are classified into seven genogroups (GI-GVII); GI, GII, and GIV infect humans while GIII infects bovine and sheep [8] . Each genogroup is further divided into several genotypes. For example, GIII is divided into GIII.1 (Bo/Jena/1980/DE) and GIII.2 (Bo/Newbury-2/ 1976/UK) originally discovered in Germany [9] and England [10] , respectively.

The RT-PCR usually targets the RNA dependent RNA polymerase (BNoV-RdRp) gene because it contains highly conserved regions. For phylogenetic classification, RT-PCR targets the BNoV-VP1 gene. Recently, several recombination events have been detected at the ORF1/ORF2 junction, thus imposing a new genotyping strategy within the Norovirus genus. It was reported that GIII.P1/GIII.2 had a GIII.1-related RdRp and a GIII.2-related VP1 while GIII.P2/GIII.1 had a GIII.2-related RdRp and a GIII.1-related VP1.

The PCR cyclic conditions were 50\u00b0C/30 min for reverse transcription, 95\u00b0C/15 min for PCR activation, and 35 cycles of 94\u00b0C/1 min for denaturation, 51\u00b0C/45 s for annealing, and 72\u00b0C/1 min for elongation followed by a final cycle of extension at 72\u00b0C/10 min. Then, another primer pair (BNoV-VP2-F/R) was designed to flank the BNoV-VP2 gene from base 6432 to base 7257 (826 bp) in the positive samples. The design of these primers was made based on the VP2 region of the GenBank reference sequence (Newbury2/UK/AF097917). The previous PCR cycle was used except for annealing that was changed to 55\u00b0C for 1 min. The PCR reactions were 25 \u03bcL in volume (1 \u03bcL enzyme mix, 12.5 \u03bcL buffer, 1 \u03bcL forward primer, 1 \u03bcL reverse primer, 2.5 \u03bcL of extracted RNA, and 7 \u03bcL RNase-free water). In negative controls, a 9.5 \u03bcL of RNase-free water was added with no RNA. The PCR amplicons were allowed to run through agarose gel by electrophoresis and then were visualized on UV transilluminator to visualize the band size. The oligonucleotide primers used in this study are listed in Table 1 .",

Although being classified as BNoV-GIII.2, study strains (41FR and 42FR) were separated from each other. Studies on HuNoVs in Egypt suggested that ORF3 (VP2) followed ORF2 (VP1) in its genetic and phylogenetic characters. However, due to the slightly different topologies between ORF2 and ORF3, BNoV-VP2 may have distinct evolutionary strategies [24] . Interestingly, the 41FR was related to recombinant GIII.P1/GIII.2 strains (BV416/Belgium and Thirsk10/UK), raising questions about the presence of intra-genotypic recombinations.

It is expected for norovirus capsid proteins, particularly the VP2, to exhibit broad sequence variability [15] .
