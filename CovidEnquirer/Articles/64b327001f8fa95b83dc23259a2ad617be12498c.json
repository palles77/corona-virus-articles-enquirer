Ultra-deep sequence clonal analysis revealed that both viruses harbored 36 previously described resistance mutations to ATV and DRV. However, the WT and 37 MAX virus proteases showed different resistance variant repertoires, with the G16E and 38 V77I substitutions observed only in WT, and the L33F, S37P, G48L, Q58E/K, and L89I 39 substitutions detected only in MAX. Remarkably, G48L and L89I are rarely found in 40 vivo in PI-treated patients. The MAX virus showed significantly higher nucleotide and 41 amino acid diversity of the propagated viruses with and without PIs (P < 0.0001), 42 suggesting higher selective pressure for change in this recoded virus.

Sequence clonal analysis revealed no resistance-associated 139 substitutions in viruses propagated without drugs (Table 3) .

Moreover, the resistance variant 142 repertoire differed between the MAX and WT viruses (Table 3) . Specifically, the G16E (Table 2) , was also included in this analysis. We found that the five generated mutants 165 displayed comparable IC 50 values to ATV in both backgrounds, WT and MAX (Table   166 3). We also determined the replication capacity of these two ten mutant viruses in MT-4 167 cells with and without ATV (Fig. 2) .

Only one variant, D30N, 177 was detected in both virus populations. We do not know whether the observed variants 178 are adaptive or neutral mutations.

However, with regards to other mutations, the explanation 237 for the difference is not readily apparent (e.g., S37P, G48L, Q58E and I84V). In 238 particular, the G48L substitution is very rarely selected in vivo in patients undergoing PI 239 therapy (37). However, when the above substitutions (S37P, G48L, Q58E, I84V or 240 L89I) were introduced in the WT sequence they showed parallel replication capacities 241 to those observed with a MAX background. We can speculate that the introduced 242 synonymous substitutions affected neighboring residues (e.g., RNA structure).",

Although they do not influence the 64 resulting protein sequence, synonymous mutations can still substantially affect cellular 65 processes (1, 2). Notably, synonymous virus genome recoding can impact viral 66 replication capacity and fitness (3), reportedly leading to attenuation of multiple RNA 67 and DNA viruses, including poliovirus (4-7), influenza virus (8, 9), HIV-1 (10-12), SIV 68 (13), Chikungunya virus (14), human respiratory syncytial virus (15-17), porcine 69 reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (18), echovirus 7 (19, 20), tick-borne 70 encephalitis virus (21), vesicular stomatitis virus, dengue virus (22), adeno-associated 71 virus (23), and papillomavirus (24). 72 Synonymous virus genome recoding is being investigated as a new strategy for 73 generating novel live-attenuated vaccine candidates. This method is promising because 74 the amino acid coding is completely unaffected, thereby avoiding the potential 75 generation of new and undesirable biological properties. Moreover, synonymous virus 76 genome recoding involves the introduction of hundreds or thousands of nucleotide 77 substitutions, which minimizes the risk of phenotypic reversion via point mutations or 78 through recombination with homologous sequences in circulating strains. This is 79 particularly important with regards to RNA viruses, since viral RNA polymerases lack 80 error-correction mechanisms (25-27). The high genetic variability of RNA viruses is a 81 critical limitation when designing novel antiviral strategies. 82 The usefulness of synonymous virus genome recoding goes beyond the 83 generation of new live attenuated vaccines. This method has also been used to identify 84 specific RNA structures required for virus replication (28), virus genome cis-inhibitory 85 signal sequences important for complex viral functions (23), and novel antiviral",

Mutant cloud composition can impact virus evolvability, fitness, 94 and virulence (25-27). One unexplored aspect of HIV-1 genetic architecture is how 95 codon choice influences population diversity and evolvability. It is presently unclear 96 whether HIV-1 sequences have evolved to optimize both protein coding and DNA/RNA 97 sequences. The HIV-1 genome exhibits a particularly striking bias towards enrichment 98 of A-rich codons, which may be a selectable trait (36) and affect innate immune 99 recognition (11, 29). Similarly, synonymous codon usage can temporally regulate 100 expressions of structural gene products of the simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) 101 (31) and regulate HIV-1 splicing and replication (12). 102 Here we aimed to explore whether synonymous sequence space influences the 103 development of protease inhibitor (PI) resistance, and to thus determine whether HIV-1 104 evolvability is influenced by the natural position of a protease in sequence space. To 105 this end, we compared the development of HIV-1 resistance to the protease inhibitors 106 atazanavir (ATV) and darunavir (DRV) between wild-type HIV-1 (WT) and synthetic 107 HIV-1 carrying a synonymously recoded protease sequence (MAX).",

Additionally, the L33F, G48L, Q58E/K, and I89L substitutions were 147 detected only in the recoded MAX protease. Other accompanying substitutions were 148 also detected only in the MAX virus (e.g., E21K, H69Y, and T91S), mainly in the MAX 149 virus (e.g., L10F), or only in the WT virus (e.g., L23I, P39Q, and V77I). Interestingly, 150 some resistance mutations selected by the MAX protease virus (i.e., G48L and I89L), 151 are extremely rare non-polymorphic substitutions in vivo (37). This finding indicates 152 that the MAX protease may explore a different sequence space than that of the WT 153 protease.
