This raises assumptions and poses challenges on adopting an evidence-based approach to managing CAP, in particular on appropriate antibiotic and/or antiviral use. Resultantly, measurements such as blood white cell count and C -reactive protein are utilized as proxies to guide us on the nature and severity of the infection. Whilst these are regarded as useful measurements they do not necessarily allow us to direct our treatment towards specific pathogens. This commonly results in viral pneumonia being treated unnecessarily with antibiotics. This stratifies a clear need for better diagnostic methods.",

This strongly correlates with the incidence in Europe, where in Finland the incidence is 36 cases per 1000 children per year. In the United Kingdom (UK), the incidence figures are lower at 1.44 cases per 1000 per year in children over 1 year of age. Whilst our incidence may seem small in comparison to Europe and North America, note that these rates are derived from a regional hospital-based audit excluding children under 1 year of age and those treated in the community where a significant proportion of cases may lie but where data is more difficult to collect. CAP continues to be seen commonly in children younger than 5 years of age. To illustrate, in Finland the incidence falls from 36 to 16.2 cases per 1000 per year in children older than 5 years of age. Worldwide, CAP is attributable to 28e34% of all deaths in children in this age group. The World Health Organization estimates that one in three newborn infant deaths occur due to pneumonia. Alongside this, other risk factors for long term morbidity and mortality from CAP include prematurity, lowbirth-weight, immunocompromised children and those known to have underlying conditions such as cystic fibrosis, congenital heart disease and asthma. Incidentally, previous upper respiratory tract infections (URTIs) are also independently associated with childhood CAP with a strong correlation of an increasing number of URTIs leading to a rise in CAP episodes, possibly due to higher infection susceptibility.",
