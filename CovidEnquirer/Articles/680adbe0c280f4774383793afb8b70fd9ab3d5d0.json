Objectives: The current study aims to establish the use of rolling circle amplification (RCA) based on internal transcribed spacer ribosomal DNA (ITS rDNA) as a powerful, simple, and rapid procedure for distinguishing closely related organisms, and specifically to identify Trichophyton species, which cause human and animal disorders. Materials and Methods: A total of sixty-one isolates belonging to three species of Trichophyton were identified to the species level based on microscopic and macroscopic examinations and their ITS rDNA regions were sequenced. Three specific circular oligonucleotide probes targeting the ITS1 and ITS2 regions were designed to differentiate Trichophyton rubrum, T. mentagrophytes, and T. tonsurans. Results: Of the 61 putative Trichophyton clinical isolates, 52 were identified to the species level. The most common species was T. mentagrophytes var. interdigitale (31 isolates), followed by T. rubrum (11 isolates), T. tonsurans (9 isolates), and T. violaceum (1 isolates); moreover, 9 isolates were identified as non-Trichophyton species. The RCA method correctly identified four Trichophyton species and was 100% specific for each species. Neither cross-reaction between the examined species of Trichophyton nor false positive or false negative results were observed. Conclusions: Species identification of Trichophyton is crucially important for epidemiological and phylogenetic purposes and for genotype delineation. RCA based on ITS polymorphisms can be used to generate identification barcodes and as an alternative to DNA sequencing; it is a very fast, specific, and economical tool for species identification.",

The most frequent species of dermatophytes are Trichophyton mentagrophytes, T. tonsurans, and T. rubrum, and these species cause a multiplicity of cutaneous disorders. They are keratinophilic fungi that attack keratinized tissue and cause a wide spectrum of clinical manifestations that vary from mild to severe, but infections are not life-threatening. Owing to the high degree of phenotypic similarity among species, identification is difficult. Conventional approaches for species-level identification in the diagnostic laboratory are based on morphological and physiological criteria, require several days or weeks to obtain results, and are frequently unspecific. To overcome these problems, molecular techniques have recently been developed to rapidly and precisely identify species of Trichophyton that potentially cause human infection.",

Molecular tools, such as sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of ribosomal DNA (rDNA), have shown promise for species identification in all genera of dermatophytes, and is relatively expensive (4-7). Moreover, ITS-based analyses have found that sequence variation is limited to only one or a few single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) between certain species, e.g., T. tonsurans and T. equinum or T. rubrum and T. soudanense (7) . This limited genetic variation suggests that the development of alternative molecular tools with sufficient specificity, reproducibility, and sensitivity is highly necessary (8) . Rolling-circle amplification (RCA) is a powerful and simple procedure for distinguishing closely related taxa at the species level; it is based on the rolling replication of short single-stranded DNA circles via specific DNA polymerases under isothermal conditions. This enables the detection of target nucleic acid sequences, including SNPs, with high specificity (9-12).",

            "text": "Recently, isothermal techniques, such as loop-mediated amplification and RCA, have been applied for rapid identification. The use of circularizable oligonucleotides or padlock probes is based on the rolling replication of short single-stranded DNA circles by certain DNA polymerases under isothermal conditions to detect target nucleic acid sequences, including SNPs, with high specificity (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) (14) (15) (16) . Such probes comprise two sequences that are complementary to the 5' and 3' termini of the target sequence joined by a genetic linker region. Upon hybridization to the target, the two probe ends become juxtaposed and are joined by DNA ligase to form a closed molecule. The intensity of the signal generated by the probe is then increased exponentially by hyper branching or RCA, and 109-fold signal amplification of each circle can be achieved within 90 min (8, 13, 17) . The RCA technique was initially established by Fire and Xu (18) and Liu et al. (19) and is an isothermal in vitro DNA amplification method. It is one of a series of robust and simple techniques for distinguishing closely related taxa at the species as well as the strain level. RCA is a rapid (requiring less than 1 working day), specific (to the single-nucleotide level), and economical (requiring minimal equipment) tool for fungal screening (20, 21) .",

In this study, species-specific padlock probes were used to distinguish three species of Trichophyton, T. mentagrophytes, T. rubrum, and T. tonsurans. Using species-specific probes, we correctly identified all clinical isolates. Three standard species of Trichophyton, T. rubrum (CBS 130927), T. mentagrophytes var. interdigitale (NBRC 5812), and T. tonsurans (NBRC 5928) were also positively identified using only the species-specific padlock probes. The sequencing results for the ITS regions of rDNA showed 100% concordance with the RCA results. Additionally, these results were perfectly concordant with phenotypic identification. The RCA procedure required less than one working day, including DNA extraction, PCR amplification, hybridization, ligation of padlock probes, and RCA amplification, rather than sequencing.",

(8) , the specificity of the T. tonsurans probe (Tt-ITS2) is ambiguous because T. equinum is highly closely related. The two species differ by only a single base in the ITS1 region (7, 22) ; therefore, the ITS region does not have sufficient discrimination ability. Designing padlock probes that target other genes, such as \u03b2-tubulin (BT2) and translation elongation factor 1-\u03b1 (TEF1), may be beneficial. In conclusion, species identification of Trichophyton is important for epidemiological and phylogenetic purposes and for genotype delineation. Despite the shortcomings of current molecular identification systems, there is a strong stimulus for the continued use of ITS polymorphisms to generate identification barcodes. Therefore, the RCA-based assay is an alternative to DNA sequencing for species identification.",
