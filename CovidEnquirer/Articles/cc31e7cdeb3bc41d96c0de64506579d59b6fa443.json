Presentations and discussions by content experts addressed these objectives. A prioritized list of action items to improve standardization and harmonization of pertussis assays was identified during a group discussion at the end of the meeting. The major items included: (1) to identify a group that will organize, prepare, maintain, and distribute proficiency panels and key reagents such as reference and control sera; (2) to encourage the development and identification of one or more reference laboratories that can serve as an anchor and resource for other laboratories;",

By the 1970s, pertussis was well controlled by immunization, and only 1000-2000 cases were reported per year; 50% of those cases occurred in infants. At present, more than 65% of pertussis reported cases are in persons older than 10 years of age. Since 1984 there has been a modest increase in reported pertussis from <1 to 9 cases per 100,000 population. In recent years (2004) (2005) the reports have increased considerably; however, the number of cases is still approximately 15-fold less than in the prevaccine era. The cycles of reported pertussis today are essentially the same as they were in the prevaccine era [15, 29] .",

In some countries (Argentina, Bangladesh, Bolivia, Brazil, Cambodia, Ghana, Pakistan, Peru, Sudan, Vietnam), there was a reduction in total cases, similar to that seen in the United States between 1950 and 1975. A similar pattern was also noted in the United Kingdom, where pertussis was reasonably well controlled by vaccination in the 1960s and early 1970s, but then concerns for vaccine safety resulted in a marked decline in immunization and pertussis became epidemic. It was then brought under control in the early 1980s by increased vaccine usage. In Italy, where vaccination was not being consistently offered until the efficacy trials of 1990, a marked reduction in pertussis was related to the use of diphtheria and tetanus toxoids and acellular pertussis component (DTaP) vaccines. Success in the control of reported pertussis in all of the above countries with the exception of Italy was secondary to use of 3 doses of DTwP (whole-cell vaccines) in the first year of life.",

A survey undertaken in 1993 and 1994 in a pediatric hospital network demonstrated an increase in the number of children hospitalized with pertussis suggesting the importance of introducing booster dose(s) to prolong vaccine immunity and reduce the exposure to B. pertussis of infants too young to be immunized [31] . Therefore, a fifth dose of acellular pertussis (aP) vaccine was introduced for 11-13-year olds in 1998, followed by the introduction of the so-called \"cocoon strategy\" in 2004. The current vaccine schedule consists of primary immunization for children aged 2, 3 and 4 months and boosters at 15-18 months, at 11-13 years old, and for young adults and healthcare workers in contact with infants [36] . No DTwP vaccine has been commercially available since 2005. The national hospital-based surveillance (RENACOQ network) has not shown any resurgence of pertussis. As observed in other countries, cycles of the disease have occurred every 3-5 years; however, the number of pertussis cases in 2005 did not reach the values observed in the earlier peak years which could be linked to the impact of the 11-13-year booster introduced 9 years previously [35, 37] .",

Of most importance is a general greater awareness of pertussis. The availability of better laboratory tests (PCR) and single-serum serology for diagnosing adolescent and adult pertussis has also contributed to the increase in reported cases. As evidence also suggests that in general DTaP vaccines may have less efficacy in children than the more potent DTwP vaccines [15, 38, 39] , it is plausible that decreased efficacy or duration of protection could possibly contribute to the outbreaks that have been seen in pre-adolescence and adolescence.",

Hewlett, MD (University of Virginia School of  Medicine, Charlottesville, Virginia) Multiple virulence factors produced by B. pertussis are able to disrupt the normal physiology of the host, causing the disease of pertussis [40] . This disease consists of a localized infection of the respiratory tract, with secondary systemic effects resulting from the actions of several bacterial products and from the host response to those factors. The molecular basis for the characteristic paroxysmal cough is not known, but is not mimicked by intravenous PT [41] . One likely role of PT is to impair the innate immune response of the host, causing leukolymphocytosis and blocking the migration of murine macrophages [42] . Reduced expression of l-selectin on the surface of leukocytes from infants infected with B. pertussis has also been demonstrated [43, 44] . The leukolymphocytosis and several other effects of PT are mediated by the ADP-ribosyl transferase activity of the catalytic domain. The PT binding to its receptor elicits a separate set of responses, known as B-subunit effects. Recently it has been shown that PT B-subunit activates signaling through the T-cell receptor, without any contribution from ADP-ribosylation [45] . Similarly, PT and an enzymatically inactive (non-ADP-ribosylating) mutant stimulate cytokine production and dendritic cell maturation [46] .",

For example, it has been shown that filamentous hemagglutinin (FHA) is both pro-inflammatory and able to induce apoptosis in macrophages [47] . Similarly, adenylate cyclase toxin (ACT), which is known for its inhibitory effects and cytotoxicity on neutrophils and other phagocytic cells [48] [49] [50] also has pro-inflammatory effects, inducing IL-6 from respiratory epithelial cells [51] and cyclooxygenase-2 (Cox-2) in cells expressing the integrin, CD11b/CD18 [52] . The disease process of pertussis appears to be multifactorial, rather than the function of a single toxin/virulence factor. Therefore, the ideal immunologic response from the host consists of antibodies directed against multiple virulence factors, resulting in inhibition of bacterial adherence, neutralization of the actions of the toxins and clearance of the infecting organisms. In addition, a cell-mediated component in the host response to immunization and infection has been studied, but the relevant target antigen(s) to which this cellular response is directed and the contribution that it makes to bacterial clearance are unknown [53] [54] [55] .",

Application of this cutoff point to culture-confirmed illness yielded a high diagnostic sensitivity (80%) and specificity (93%).

In that study, 32 participating laboratories were asked to quantify specific antibody to PT, FHA, pertactin (PRN), and FIM in a panel of 21 blinded samples by using those ELISAs routinely performed in that laboratory. The laboratories employed a variety of procedures, antigens, conjugates and other reagents, and calculation methods. Results indicated an overall consistency among the laboratories. A reasonable quantitative agreement was achieved among the 19 laboratories with assays calibrated using the US reference pertussis antisera. This agreement demonstrated that use of a common reference serum had been successful at harmonizing results. To promote a higher level of international standardization of pertussis immunoassays, the highest priority recommendations would be to improve the availability of reference reagents and methods, including international reference sera, a proficiency panel of well-characterized sera, and well-characterized antigens.",

Reference sera from the United States (US reference pertussis antiserum [human] lot 3 and lot 4 for IgG-antibodies and lot 5 for IgA-antibodies) were prepared by FDA, CBER more than 10 years ago, and since then have been commonly used as reference standards for pertussis serologic assays [58] [59] [60] [61] [62] [63] . Currently, only limited quantities of these sera remain. With an increasing number of vaccine and diagnostic studies, more widely available international standard preparation(s) are needed. The WHO Ad Hoc Pertussis Working Group recommended the preparation and standardization of an international human reference antiserum to pertussis antigens to replace the current widely used CBER preparations before the supply is exhausted [64] . It was agreed that as far as possible, continuity with the existing CBER reference preparations should be maintained. These new international reference materials were intended for the following uses: (1) vaccine studies of products in current distribution, as well as those under development; (2) studies of serologic responses to infection; (3) epidemiologic surveillance; (4) future assessment of antibodies to other antigens apart from PT, FHA and PRN; and (5) evaluation of new generation vaccines.",

In the last 2 years, since Tdap has been available, only two seropositive patients with recent Tdap vaccination have been identified. One person was vaccinated the day before blood was drawn for serology, so the antibodies detected were unlikely to have been due to vaccine. In Massachusetts, Tdap-associated IgG may be less of a problem than was originally anticipated.

Ninety healthy adults with no clinical history of respiratory illness in the preceding 12 weeks and negative by CF, IF and WB formed the negative group for the evaluation.

Following the evaluation of various commercial tests, over 90% of these samples were retested and 73% were found to be false-positives. The false-positive specimens reacted with the FHA antigen band only, suggesting that PT would be a better choice for an ELISA antigen. However, the only kit that used PT as an antigen performed poorly, which emphasizes the need for better standardization. In addition, a group of 70 negative samples was tested by the ESEN IgG ELISA [62] using a 100 EU/ml cutoff; 20 samples had IgG levels >100 units, which would have been interpreted as evidence of recent infection when clearly these individuals were not symptomatic.

Generally an anamnestic immune response develops more rapidly than symptoms, and immune responses to vaccine antigens cannot be distinguished from response to infection. Problems also exist with serodiagnosis of B. parapertussis infections. Serologic interpretation requires knowledge of pertussis immunization, information not typically known by the testing laboratory. Reliable, standardized ELISA systems are not commercially available at this time. Additionally, the clinical course appears to differ between primary and non-primary infections. For most subjects, clinical case definitions for pertussis remain nonspecific. There are currently no suitable serologic tests for recently vaccinated patients, since tests based on nonvaccine antigens have not been satisfactory for diagnosis. Finally, when using single-sample serology, population-based cut-offs will need re-verification after any change made in a vaccination schedule.",

Therefore, it was suggested that nonvaccine antigens may not be as good as PT for serologic diagnosis of pertussis in vaccinated populations. Other points of discussion included the potential use of reverse vaccinology approach to identify new antigen candidates to be used in serologic diagnostics and lack of specificity of other antigens other than PT, such as FHA and ACT. The lack of sensitivity and specificity of commercial tests currently available worldwide was broadly discussed. It was pointed out that one commercial IgG and IgA anti-PT test available in the United States has been standardized to provide adequate sensitivity and specificity for the diagnosis of pertussis in persons older than 10 years of age.",

To determine serologic correlates, antibody titers to specific antigens were determined at the time of exposure. Both studies indicated that PRN was most important in protection and that antibody to FIM was next most important. Also noted in both studies was an apparent antagonism between antibody to PT and FIM. In clinical trials in which children with both mild and severe disease were included in the analyses, efficacy jumped considerably for vaccines that contained PRN as well as PT and FHA when compared with PT and PT/FHA vaccines. In the Erlangen trial, the imputed titers at the time of exposure in 6 DTP and 11 DTaP vaccine failures were examined. In the majority of the failures, subjects had high levels of antibody to PRN, which is difficult to explain in relation to the overall data on serologic correlates. This indicates that there is much yet to be learned about serologic correlates. Of interest is the fact that when a DTwP vaccine (Evans vaccine) was compared with a two-component DTaP vaccine, a three-component DTaP vaccine and a five-component DTaP vaccine, the greatest efficacy was noted with the DTwP vaccine. This vaccine elicited minimal antibody responses to PT and FHA (10 and 34 EU/ml, respectively) and high values to PRN and FIM (150 and 677 EU/ml, respectively).",

Whichever immunologic parameter is chosen for the primary comparison, it is difficult to decide what might constitute a clinically important difference. In addition, the predefined criteria for noninferiority might be met for one or more, but not all immunologic parameters, with unknown implications for protection. Because of these uncertainties, the overall judgment of the likely protective efficacy of an aP-containing vaccine should take into account all aspects of immune responses.

Further characterizations of new DTaP combinations by GSK involve the evaluation of clinical T-cell responses as well as preclinical evaluations in a mouse lung clearance model [85] .",

The mechanisms linked to PRN-mediated protection relate to the observations that PRN expression affects ACT activity [88] and induces opsonophagocytic antibodies [89] . The DTaP efficacy trials have been contradictory with regard to the efficacy of DTaP2 (PT + FHA without PRN). Initially the efficacy of DTaP2 was reported to be 85% in Senegal, according to WHO criteria, but this was later corrected to 74% since the original diagnostic criteria were different from other trials [90] . This 74% efficacy of DTaP2 in Senegal probably is similar to the 59% efficacy observed with another DTaP2 in Sweden because of the finding that PT immune responses in Senegal are more than 1.5 times higher than in Western Europe [91] . In conclusion, DTwP and DTaP with \u22653 components are the preferred options for immunization against whooping cough. DTaP5 has demonstrated efficacy comparable with DTaP3, although it is uncertain if FIM3 is a protective antigen [92] . The duration of protection with DTwP and DTaP can be estimated at 6 years or more [93] . To further control pertussis in newborns, adolescents and adults, DTaP booster immunizations can be recommended [8] .",

Key reagents are qualified and standardized, coating antigens are highly purified and assessed both by physical chemistry and immunologic methods to ensure purity, antigenicity, and specificity. Assay reference sera are bridged to international references, and the performance has demonstrated to remain stable. Control sera are shown to be specific and represent suitable ranges across the range of the assay. All components are qualified, with performance panels of sera to ensure consistency. All assays have been fully validated by precision (inter-and intralaboratory), accuracy (using spike recovery), specificity (assessing matrix effects and performing competition studies), linearity/dilutability, limit of detection (LOD), limit of quantitation (LOQ), and robustness.",

First, consensus on methodologies, assay validation, and analysis of results is required to facilitate comparisons among data generated in different laboratories. The requirements for a diagnostic assay will likely differ in some aspects from assays used to perform postvaccination immunity evaluation. Stability of assay results over time will be dependent on the consistent availability of appropriately characterized reagents and materials. Studies are required to determine the effect on assay results of different sources and lots of antigen, conjugate and other reagents. A proficiency panel of human sera is vital to harmonization of methods between laboratories, although creating a panel with sufficient volume for worldwide use will be a challenge. A reference laboratory or a series of connected reference laboratories will be essential as resources for methodology, change control and management and evaluation of the proficiency panel. Finally, a repository for the distribution of standardized materials, such as antigens, conjugates, and reference materials, will be crucial for standardization and harmonization of B. pertussis assays.",
