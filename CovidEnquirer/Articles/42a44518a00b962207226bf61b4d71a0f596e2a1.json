            "text": "During the past 20 to 30 years, there has been a growing interest in the cat as a companion animal. In many countries, the number of cats has exceeded that of dogs. For instance Switzerland with 1.3 million cats has about three times the number of dogs. As a consequence, veterinary immunologists in industry and academia have devoted increasing efforts in the study of the feline immune system, pursuing both applied and basic research. The applied research is devoted mainly to improving the cat's health by studying pathogenesis, immune reactions and diagnostic possibilities of various diseases and to the development and improvement of vaccines. Indeed, the numbers of vaccines for use in cats has grown tremendously during the last 10 years. In addition to the applied research from which cats profit directly, the cat has attracted much interest from basic research as a model for various human diseases. There were two events which triggered increased study of the feline immunology: the first was the discovery of the feline leukemia virus (FeLV) in Scotland by Jarrett's group (Jarrett et al., 1964) and the second was the isolation of the feline irnmunodeficiency virus (FIV) in California by Pedersen and coworkers .",

            "text": "The discovery that FeLV caused transmissible lymphosarcomas in an outbred species was considered important for tumor genesis also in man. The event triggered a great number of studies relating to mechanisms of tumor development and epidemiology of FeLV. As a consequence of the hypothesis that the FeLV-induced feline oncornavirus associated cell membrane antigen (FOCMA) supposedly a nonvirus coded tumor specific antigen, (Essex et al., 1975) might protect cats against FeLVinduced tumors, many studies were initiated relating to the immune mechanisms that could be involved in protection against these tumors. When it became clear that cats are capable of spontaneously overcoming FeLV viremia, many groups started on the development of a vaccine against FeLV infection. Several FeLV vaccines, including a highly efficacious recombinant one, are now available to veterinarians.",

In the early days of Fiv research, few reagents existed to investigate the feline immune system during FIV infection. This soon changed in Europe with the support from the European Concerted Action on FIV Vaccination and after the first description of antifeline CD4 \u00a7 antibodies (Ackley et al., 1990) , a number of different antifeline leukocyte differentiation antigens are now available and the methods for their use have been established. To date, few assays exist that allow the quantification of feline cytokines on the protein level.

Because little information is available on the T-cell receptor and on leukocyte traffic, no specific sections can be listed on these topics. Diseases of the immune system are important in the cat; therefore, a separate section on immunological diseases is included.

Each thymic lobule is clearly divided into an outer cortex region and an inner medulla. The cortex is composed of dense aggregates (no follicles) of small lymphocytes (thymocytes) which are surrounded by reticular connective tissue. It can be seen by FACS analysis that 93% of thymic cells are stained by a feline pan-T cell marker (Tompkins et al., 1990b) . The medulla shows a relatively low cellular density and consists of epitheloid reticulum cells, sparse lymphocyte populations and Hassall's corpuscles. The thymus weighs about 0.32-0.39 g (0.4% of bodyweight) in neonates; it increases in weight and size, and undergoes progressive involution in which the thymic tissue is successively replaced by connective and adipose tissue, starting in the fourth month post partum. Only efferent lymphatics are present in the thymus, which lead to the nodi lymphatici (nil.) mediastinales. The thymus is innervated by the vagus nerve and the truncus sympathicus (Vollmerhaus et al., 1981 (Vollmerhaus et al., , 1994 K6nig, 1992; Gershwin et al., 1995) .",

However, the production of monoclonal antibodies can be a costly and time-consuming process and researchers studying the feline immune system seldom undertake monoclonal antibody production unless there is a pressing need for a reagent with a defined specificity. Thus, the identification of antibodies that recognize feline leukocyte differentiation antigens has tended to reflect areas of most active investigation, for example the discovery of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) fuelled the production of antibodies against the feline homologues of CD4 and CD8 in order that T lymphocyte subsets could be monitored in FIVinfected cats, and that the question of whether feline CD4 acts as a receptor for FIV could be addressed. The expression of leukocyte differentiation antigens in the feline immune system has been reviewed by Willet and Callanan (1995) .

            "text": "The feline homologue of CD4 is perhaps the best studied of the feline leukocyte differentiation antigens, primarily because CD4 was identified as the primary binding receptor for human immunodeficiency virus and researchers sought to define the role of the feline homologue of CD4 in FIV infection. Expression of CD4 in the feline immune system resembles that of murine CD4 in that expression is restricted solely to helper T lymphocytes and their thymic precursors and is notably absent from monocytes and macrophages (Ackley and Cooper, 1992) . In contrast, CD4 expression in the human and rat immune systems extends to monocytes and macrophages. Indeed, CD4 expression in the human immune system has been studied extensively in relation to the cell tropism of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and it would appear to be widespread, with levels of CD4 being detected on eosinophils, follicular dendritic cells, megakaryocytes and microglia. The sole example of a non-T-lineage cell that expresses CD4 in the cat is the Langerhans cell (Tompkins et al., 1990b) although only a single anti-CD4 antibody, vpg39, has been demonstrated to recognize these cells. cDNAs encoding the feline homologue of CD4 have been cloned (Dumont-Drieux et al., 1992; Norimine et al., 1992) and have revealed that the feline CD4 molecule contains a 17-amino-acid insertion in D2. Structural studies predict that this insertion may affect the flexibility of the hinge region between D2 and D3. Feline CD4 is also unusual in that the first cysteine involved in intrasheet disulphide bridge in D2 of human CD4 (residues 130 and 159) has been replaced by a tryptophan residue, ruling out the possibility of a similar disulphide bridge forming in feline CD4. Several antibodies have been described which recognize feline CD4, including Fel7, vpg30-39 and cat 30A. The Fel7 antibody and the antibodies of the vpg30-39 series have been epitope mapped using soluble feline CD4 produced in CHO cells and recognize five distinct epitopes on the molecules. Whether the epitopes can be related to functional properties of CD4 such as MHC class II binding or a putative interaction with interleukin 16 has yet to be established, although the epitope recognized by vpg39 is polymorphic in nature and absent from PBMC of some cats (Willet et al., 1994a) . Several antibodies have been described which recognize the feline homologue of CD8 (Klotz and Cooper, 1986; Tompkins et al., 1990b) . As in other species, feline CD8 appears to exist as a heterodimer of ~ and ~ chains; immunoprecipitations with the FT2 and 3.357 antibodies yielded two distinct protein species and northern blotting analysis of mRNA from feline PBMC with a murine Ly-3 probe suggested the existence of CD813 in PBMC (Pecoraro et al., 1994b) . A cDNA has been cloned encoding the feline CD8~ chain (Pecoraro et al., 1994a) and the expression product is recognized by the cross-species reactive antihuman CD8-antibody OKT8. Interestingly, the feline CD8 specific antibodies FT2, 3.357 and vpg9 do not recognize the a-chain cDNA clone when expressed on either CrFK or CHO cells suggesting that either they recognize the 0~//3 heterodimer or are/3-chain specific. Molecular cloning of the feline CD813-chain should confirm the reactivity of antifeline CD8 antibodies and establish whether feline CD8 exists solely as an ~//3 heterodimer or whether ~/~ homodimers/multimers exist.",

All CD4 and CD8 positive lymphocytes are recognized by the 43-Pan T antibody which recognizes a CD5-Leukocyte Differentiation Antigens 295 like molecule (Ackley and Cooper, 1992) . The 43-Pan T precipitates a single 72 kDa glycoprotein which is phosphorylated in both resting and activated T cells and is upregulated by stimulation of T cells with phorbol ester or phytohaemagglutinin. Moreover, addition of the 43 Pan-T antibody to cultures of Con A stimulated PBMC augments the proliferative response. The 43-Pan T antibody therefore displays many of the characteristics of the feline homologue of CD5. Although other Pan T antibodies have been described, these antibodies have still to be characterized further. In combination with the anti-CD4 and CD8 antibodies the 43-Pan T antibody can be utilized to enumerate T lymphocyte numbers in the peripheral blood or to define the T-cell compartment in lymphoid tissues. There is no evidence to suggest that the 43-Pan T ligand is expressed on a minority of B cells, as is observed with human CD5. Thymocytes express the ligand recognized by the Fel 5F4 antibody (P. F. Moore, unpublished data), a prospective antifeline CDla antibody. As with human CDla, the Fel 5F4 antibody also stains Langerhans cells, intra-epithelial dendritic cells and interdigitating dendritic cells in the lymph node (Tompkins et al., 1990b) .",

While true Pan-B-cell reagents for use in the cat have yet to be identified there are now good cross-species reactive antibodies in RA3.6B2 (CD45R) and CA2.1D6 (CD21). The anti-CD45R antibody is a rat antibody raised against murine B cells but cross-reacts with both human and feline cells. Although the principal reactivity of this antibody is with B cells, the ligand for the antibody (the high molecular weight form of leukocyte common antigen) is also present on murine NK cells and non-MHC restricted CTLs. The antibody has been used immunohistochemically to enumerate B cells in both frozen and paraffinembedded lymph node sections, and by flow cytometry to enumerate B cells in peripheral blood where less than 1.0% of RA3.6B2-positive cells were co-stained with a Pan-T antibody CF255 (Monteith et al., 1996) . The data suggest that greater than 99% of the cells recognized in peripheral blood by RA3.6B2 were B lymphocytes. Whether this antibody will prove useful for the enumeration of B cells in diseased cats where subpopulations of leukocytes may have undergone expansion remains to be seen. However, it has been used very successfully to immunophenotype feline lymphosarcomas .",

Feline CD9 resembles CD9 from other species except for a unique sequence at the crown of the first predicted extracellular loop. The first extracellular loop of human, bovine and murine CD9 contains a putative site for N-linked glycosylation; this is absent from feline CD9 (Willett and Nell, 1995) . Despite this divergence of amino acid sequence, the feline CD9 clone proved to be functional in assays of B-cell migration (Shaw et al., 1995) . CD9 is expressed on 296 IMMUNOLOGY OF THE CAT activated but not resting T cells and thus may be used as a marker for activation. T cell activation can also be evaluated using the 9F23 antibody which recognizes the interleukin-2 receptor alpha (IL2-R~) chain. This antibody recognizes a binding site on the IL-2R0~ distinct from the IL-2-binding site and has been used to evaluate the responsiveness of feline PBMC to mitogens in FIV-infected cats. The authors concluded that induction of IL2-R0~ expression on Con A-stimulated PBMC was significantly depressed in FIV-infected cats (Ohno et al., 1992a) . A cDNA encoding feline IL-2R0~ has been cloned and expressed in CrFK cells.

            "text": "IL-2 which was originally designated T-cell growth factor (TCGF) is produced by lectin-or antigen-stimulated mature T-lymphocytes; the gene coding for IL-2 is located on the cat's chromosome B 1 (Seigel et al., 1984) . Tompkins et al. (1987) described a cell culture assay that allowed quantification of feline IL-2. Recombinant human IL-2 is highly capable of stimulating feline T-lymphocytes, an observation made by many research groups but never specifically investigated and published. After systemic application, human IL-2 induced eosinophilia in cats (Tompkins et al., 1990a) . Feline IL-2 has been sequenced and expressed in COS cells; it consists of 154 amino acids, including a putative signal sequence, and has 81%, 69%, 60% and 64% identity to human, bovine, murine and rat IL-2, respectively (Cozzi et al., 1993;  for Accession number see Table VIII .4.1). Feline IL-2 shows a similarity of 90% with canine IL-2 (Dunham et al., 1995) . Interestingly, while recombinant human IL-2 promotes proliferation of both, human and feline leukocytes, recombinant feline IL-2 only promotes proliferation of feline cells, but not human cells (Cozzi et al., 1995) . Around 20% of feline lymphocytes in the peripheral blood stream are positive for the IL-2 receptor (Iwamato et al., 1989) ; in that study, the IL2 receptor was detected by a monoclonal antibody to human IL-2 receptor cross-reacting with the feline counterpart. In feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) infection, expression of IL-2 is markedly inhibited (Tompkins et al., 1989a; Bishop et al., 1992; Lawrence et al., 1992 Lawrence et al., , 1995 . In conjunction with nucleoside analogues and other cytokines, IL-2 has been used with some success to treat feline leukemia virus (FeLV) infections (Zeidner et al., 1990 (Zeidner et al., , 1993 .",

Feline IL-6 was sequenced (Bradley et al., 1993; Ohashi et al., 1993;  for the EMBL Accession number see Table  VIII .4.1) and was found to be 752 bp long. It shows homology of 81%, 76%, 63%, and 61% with pig, human, rat, and mouse IL-6, respectively. The predicted amino acid sequence exhibits 66%, 53%, 37%, and 30% homology with pig, human, rat, and mouse IL-6, respectively. After transfection with IL-6 cDNA, Crandell feline kidney cells (CFK) produced biologically active proteins that showed hybridoma growth-promoting activity (Ohashi et al., 1993) . It is not clear how the difference between the apparent molecular weight of 30000-40000 described (Ohashi et aI., 1989; Goitsuka et al., 1990) and the predicted molecular weight is explained. In humans, IL-6 is known to be important in the differentiation of activated B cells into Ig-secreting cells (Chen-Kiang, 1995) . FIP and FIV infections are diseases in which B cells are greatly stimulated. The observation by Goitsuka et al. (1990) and Ohashi et al. (1992) that in cats with FCoV and FIV infection plasma IL-6 activity was significantly higher than in healthy controls, suggests that in the cat also, IL-6 plays an important role in B-cell activation. IL-6 was produced by peritoneal exudate cells collected from cats with FIP (Goitsuka et al., 1990) which suggests that macrophages might be an important origin of IL-6.",

This leads to downregulation of antigen presentation and accessory cell functions of monocytes, macrophages, Langerhans cells and dendritic cells. IL-10 is considered to be a potent immunosuppressant, both in vitro and in vivo and it attracts much interest as a potentially important immunoregulatory protein in the control of inflammatory, autoimmune and other immune-mediated diseases (de Vries, 1995) . No in vitro assays are available to quantify feline IL-10. When IL-10 mRNA was determined by reverse transcriptionpolymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) in LPS stimulated alveolar macrophages, it was reported to be significantly increased in FIV infected cats (Ritchey and Tompkins, 1996) . In FIV infection, production of IL-10 mRNA in different lymphnodes was found to be increased after onset of viremia (Dean et al., 1996a) .",

At that time, only IL-1 was known to exist in multimeric forms with various degrees of bioactivity (Furutani et al., 1986) . The sequencing of the feline IL-16 cDNA revealed that codon 26 which is deleted in some of the human and also in some of the African green monkey genes (Bayer et al., 1995) appears to be deleted also in the feline gene (Table VIII. acute phase of FIV infection, IFN-7 and IL-12 mRNAs rise transiently to very high levels; thereafter these cytokines return to baseline concentrations (Dean et al., 1996a) . In contrast, while the mRNA levels of IFN-2 and IL-12 return to the original concentrations, IL-4 and IL-10 mRNAs remain elevated. These results suggest that during early FIV infection a TH1 immune response is triggered which later switches to a TH2 type of immune response.

The biologically active protein had a molecular mass of 17 kDa. Feline TNF-~ immunologically cross-reacts with antibodies specific for human TNF-~ (Lehmann et al., 1992; Rimstad et al., 1995) . TNF-~ production is increased in FIV infected cats (Lehmann et al., 1992) probably reflecting increased production by macrophages infected by FIV (Lin and Bowman, 1993) . FeLV infection of macrophages also has been reported to trigger increased TNF-~ production (Khan et al., 1993) . In a L929 cytotoxic assay, TNF-~ was found to display CD50 activity at 15 ng/ml (Rimstad et al., 1995) . Cats given recombinant feline (rf)TNF-~ intravenously manifested the typical biological effects of TNF-~, including fever, depression, and piloerection. The rfTNF-0~ upregulated IL-2 receptor and MHC-II antigen expression on peripheral blood mononuclear cells stimulated in vitro, but had no effect on TNF-0~ receptor and MHC I antigen expression (Rimstad et al., 1995) . When BAL cells collected from cats with long-term FIV infection were stimulated by LPS or Con A and phorbol myristate acetate, less TNF-a was produced than by cells from cats not infected by FIV . However, in the acute phase of FIV infection, significantly more TNF-~ was produced than in noninfected cats. According to Kraus et al. (1996) expression of FIV p24 during development of viremia during the acute phase of FIV infection is closely associated with expression of TNF-~, which suggests a close interrelationship between FIV and TNF-~ expression. TNF-~ expression was detected in feline hearts shortly after endotoxin application (Kapadia et al., 1995) . demonstrated that TNF-~ induces apoptosis in CmFK cells chronically infected by FIV while apoptosis was not found in noninfected cells. These findings may be important in the understanding of the pathogenesis of FIV induced immunosuppression. The feline TNF-receptor was recently sequenced (Duthie et al., 1996 ; for EMBL Accession number see Table VIII .4.1)",

Moreover, while immunization with foreign cells induced lymphocytotoxic antibodies, the response was not allospecific, as observed in other species. Similarly, only weak mixed lymphocyte reaction (MLR) responses were detected between unrelated cats of different breeds. The authors concluded that there may be limited polymorphism in the feline MHC. Subsequent studies by Winkler et al. (1989) investigated the development of cytotoxic antibodies in the cat following skin grafting between unrelated cats. The alloantisera generated displayed lymphocytotoxicity and permitted the identification of six clusters of overlapping feline MHC (termed FLA) specificities. Using these sera the authors were able to define FLA haplotypes and show that the specificities segregated as a single Mendelian complex.",

Detergent extraction followed by immunoprecipitation demonstrated abundant MHC class I molecules, and low levels of MHC class II antigens in unstimulated human PBLs. In contrast, similar analyses of feline PBLs demonstrated high levels of both MHC class I and MHC class II on unstimulated PBLs. In the murine and human immune systems MHC class II expression is restricted, with predominant expression on B cells, macrophages, dendritic cells and activated T cells. In contrast, both resting and activated T cells express high levels of MHC class II molecules in the cat (see below). The a-chain of feline MHC class II has an acidic pI and apparent Mr of 35 \u2022 103 whereas the fl-chain has a basic pI and an apparent Mr of 30 \u2022 10 3 (Neefjes et al., 1986) . The feline MHC class I 0~-chain has an apparent Mr of approximately 45 x 103. Interestingly immunoprecipitation of feline MHC class I from cultured feline lymphocytes with the cross-species reactive antibody W6/32 did not yield fl2-microglobulin (Neefjes et al., 1986) . While this may reflect exchange of fl2-microglobulin with bovine 132microglobulin from the culture medium, it is possible that W6/32 recognizes feline MHC class I in the absence of /~2-microglobulin, as has been reported with other species.",

Recently, reagents specific for feline MHC class II have been developed including 42-3H2 (Rideout et al., 1990 ) and vpg3 . These antibodies were generated as a fortuitous byproduct of feline immunodeficiency virus research, both antibodies resulting from fusions of splenocytes from mice immunized with purified FIV. It has been shown that as lentiviruses bud from cells they incorporate a range of cellular proteins into the viral envelope (Arthur et al., 1992) .

Importantly, both resting and activated T cells express MHC class II molecules, giving rise to a characteristic bimodal histogram when MHC class II expression is analysed on lymphocytes. The high-intensity peak consists predominately of B lymphocytes whereas the lowintensity peak consists predominately of T lymphocytes (Rideout et al., 1990; Willett and Callanan, 1995) . In the FIV-infected cat higher levels of MHC class II expression are detected on a subset of CD8 \u00a7 lymphocytes which usually express reduced levels of MHC class II (CD8]~ suggesting that this subpopulation may represent activated CD8 + lymphocytes . While Ohno et al. (1992a) reported that higher levels of MHC class II could be detected on PBMC from FIVinfected cats compared with specific pathogen-free (SPF) cats, the authors did not establish whether this was due to an increase in the number of B lymphocytes or upregulation of T cell MHC class II expression. In contrast, Rideout et al. (1992) demonstrated that there was a persistent elevation in the percentage of CD4 \u00a7 and CD8 + T lymphocytes expressing MHC class II antigens shortly after FIV infection but that a similar elevation was present in cats chronically infected with FeLV. The data suggest that despite a basal level of MHC class II expression on feline T cells, expression can be upregulated following T cell activation.",

(1982) using a cross-reactive antimurine IE antibody suggested that activated and resting feline T lymphocytes could be differentiated on the basis of expression of an IE-like molecule. Therefore, it would appear that while some feline MHC class II molecules are expressed on all T cells (42-3H2 and vpg3 reactive), additional MHC class II molecules are expressed only upon activation (IE-like). The expression of MHC class II molecules on resting T cells is not unique to the cat, similar phenomena have been described in the dog, pig and horse (Thistlewaite et al., 1983; Doveren et al., 1985; Crepaldi et al., 1986) . The differentiation of activated T lymphocytes on the basis of MHC class II expression has been observed in the horse where IA-like molecules are constitutively expressed on all T cells while IE-like molecules are restricted to activated T cells.

The analysis of the Ig isotypes summarized above was made by analyzing the genes encoding the different Ig molecules. This has provided conclusive evidence for the structure of Igs which was not possible to elucidate otherwise because only a few amino acid differences may represent different isotypes, allotypes or Ig subclasses.

The fetal chorionic epithelium in feline placenta is in close contact with the endothelium of maternal capillaries, and this type of placenta is called endotheliochorial placenta (Leiser and Kaufmann, 1994) . This type of placentation allows a small amount (5-10%) of maternal immunoglobulins (primarily IgG) to transfer to the fetus (Scott et al., 1970; Schultz et al., 1974) . The amount of immunoglobulin transferred to the fetus is very difficult to determine by standard quantitative assays, such as radial immunodiffusion and immunoelectrophoresis (Schulz et al., 1974) . Consequently, detection of transplacental immunoglobulins in the fetus has been demonstrated more readily by assays which detect antigenspecific antibodies in the serum of presuckling kittens, such as neutralizing antibody assay, enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay, and immunoblot analysis (Harding et al., 1961; Scott et al., 1970; Pu et al., 1995) .

Colostrum is rich in immunoglobulins and the immunoglobulin fraction consists predominantly of IgG; IgA and IgM are present in lower concentration (Table VIII. 8.1). The concentration of IgG in colostrum is two-to four-fold higher than that found in serum. A majority of IgG and a considerable portion of IgA in the colostrum are actively transported from the circulation into mammary alveoli by specific receptors on the acinar epithelial cells of the mammary glands (Gorman and Halliwell, 1989) . Colostrum contains trypsin inhibitors, as well as antimicrobial factors such as lysozyme, lactoferin, and lactoperoxidase (Stabenfeldt, 1992) . In addition, colostrum has high concentrations of lipids and lipid-soluble vitamins (particularly vitamin A), proteins (such as caseins and albumin), and minerals, and also low levels of carbohydrates (Reece, 1991; Stabenfeldt, 1992) . All of these components are nutritionally important to newborn kittens.",

A majority of IgG and IgA is synthesized locally in the mammary glands, unlike colostrum which consists of immunoglobulins transported from the serum.

(Tizard, 1996) . The ingested immunoglobulins bind first to specific Fc receptors on the surface of intestinal epithelial cells. Subsequently, immunoglobulins are taken up by the epithelial cells via pinocytosis and transferred into the lacteals and then the circulation (Tizard, 1996) . Once maternal immunoglobulins are absorbed into the circulation, a small portion is released back onto the mucosal surface, thereby providing the local immunity. However, a majority of maternal immunoglobulins remain in the circulation and confer systemic immunity (Tizard, 1996) . In contrast, immunoglobulins present in milk remain mainly in the intestine, and consequently, provide local immunity for the gastrointestinal tract (Tizard, 1996) .",

            "text": "Vaccination of kittens should be scheduled according to the level and nature of the passive immunity received by the kittens. This is based on the concept that maternal antibodies reactive to vaccine antigens can interfere with the development of the immunity elicited by the vaccination (Scott et al., 1970; Scott, 1971 ). Vaccine interference can result in delay and/or failure in the development of protective levels of vaccine-induced immunity. In general, the level of vaccine interference correlates directly with the titer of specific antibodies present in the serum of kittens. Thus, the vaccination schedule of kittens should be designed in a manner which avoids or overcomes potential vaccine interference. Ideally, kittens should receive the first vaccination at a time when pathogen-specific maternal antibodies are depleted. It is possible to predict this time-point based on the titer of specific antibodies in queens and the half-life of specific maternal antibodies in kittens. The half-life of maternally derived antibodies varies with their isotypes; for example 15 days for FeLV antibodies (Jarrett et al., 1977) , 9.5 days for FPV antibodies (Scott et al., 1970) , 7 days for feline enteric coronavirus antibodies (Pedersen et al., 1981) , and 18.5 days for feline rhinotracheitis virus antibodies (Gaskell, 1975) . The half-life of antibodies may also vary between kittens from different litters (Scott et al., 1970) . Generally, specific antibody titers in kittens and queens are not usually determined before vaccination, thus, vaccination schedules are designed according to the known half-life of specific antibodies. For example, if the half-life of antibodies for a specific pathogen is 15 days, the maternal antibodies remaining in the serum of kittens will drop to insignificant levels (approximately 1.5%) by 3 months old. Because the half-life of antibodies against a majority of pathogens is equal to or less than 15 days, the primary vaccination should be administered to kittens at about 3 months old. However, it is important to note that low titers of residual maternal antibodies to FPV (Scott et al., 1970) and FIV (Figure VIII.8.2) have been detected in the serum of kittens at 4 months old. Thus, to overcome the potential vaccine interference, vaccine boost at 4 months old is important in ensuring successful vaccination, as has been suggested by others (Scott et aI., 1970; Scott, 1971 ). This view is further supported by results from experimental vaccine studies which demonstrate the ability of vaccine boosts to overcome maternal antibody interference (Scott, 1971 ) ( Figure VIII.8.3) . .,a-'/ r I I 1",

The feline thymus first appears during the fifth week of gestation and occupies the cranioventral mediastinal space. Lymphocytes from the bone marrow seed the thymus by 40 days of gestation. The secondary lymphoid tissue such as spleen and lymph nodes are then seeded with mature T cells (from the thymus) and B cells (from the bone marrow). In the cat, population of the secondary lymphoid tissue is largely complete at the time of birth. Thymectomy performed at 5 weeks old had no direct effect on numbers of circulating B and T lymphocytes or on the responsiveness of peripheral lymphocytes to con-canavalin A or pokeweed mitogen. Survival of skin allografts performed 3 weeks after thymectomy was slightly prolonged compared with nonthymectomized littermates. Kittens appear to be similar to the cow, sheep, and pig in that neonatal thymectomy does not have important immunologic or physiologic consequences (Hoover et al., 1978) . This contrasts with mice and puppies which develop a severe wasting and immunodeficiency syndrome following early thymectomy (Roth, 1967) .",

            "text": "In contrast to surgical thymectomy, neonatal infections with lymphotropic viruses can lead to premature thymic atrophy and a wasting syndrome associated with immune deficiency. The immune deficiency occurs because lymphocytes in the secondary lymphoid tissue, as well as those in the thymus, are depleted. The most common cause of thymic atrophy in kittens is infection with feline leukemia virus (FeLV), and affected kittens have increased survival of skin allografts, indicating defective T-cell immunity (Perryman et al., 1972) . Feline panleukopenia virus (FPV) also induces severe thymic atrophy along with lymphocyte depletion of the spleen, lymph nodes, and Peyer's patches, and destruction of bone marrow myeloid cells, leading to marked panleukopenia (Rohovsky and Griesemer, 1967; Larson et al., 1976) . FPV causes a lytic infection of rapidly dividing cells. Thus, infection of feline fetuses with FPV at 35 days gestation, during early thymic development, results in immune dysfunction, as demonstrated by delayed skin allograft rejection, while infection at 45 or 55 days of gestation, after the thymus is well developed, has no effect. Postnatally infected cats of various ages had no alteration in graft rejection times or humoral immune responses and only transient depression in lymphocyte responses to the T-cell mitogens Con A and PHA. Thus, the immunosuppression of FPV is due to transient panleukopenia and depressed T-cell responses, and is not as profound as that induced by FeLV infection (Schultz et al., 1976) .",

In support of this, IL-2 production in response to Con A stimulation is much lower in kittens less than 10 weeks of age compared to adults (M. B. Tompkins, unpublished data). This suggests that, although neonatal kittens have high numbers of CD4 + cells, these cells are not able to function at full capacity. Resistance to FeLV infection is also a reflection of functional maturation of the immune response. One-hundred per cent of neonates and 85% of weanling kittens become persistently infected with FeLV upon challenge, while only 15% of cats older than 4 months develop a persistent infection (Hoover et al., 1976) . This age-related resistance has been shown to be associated with maturation of macrophage function. Macrophages from neonatal kittens are highly permissive for FeLV infection and replication, while macrophages from adult cats are not (Hoover et al., 1981) .",

Unresponsiveness may be induced following exposure to antigens administered either orally or parenterally. As in other species, tolerance is more likely to develop to simple soluble antigens than to complex antigens (Gorham et al., 1971) The neonatal kitten depends primarily upon maternal antibody for protection from infectious diseases. Newborn kittens obtain nearly all of their maternal antibody from colostrum, although a very small amount of IgG also may be transferred across the placenta. The colostral phase of lactation lasts approximately 5 days, during which time the concentration of IgG and IgA in milk is several-fold greater than that in the dam's serum (Yamada et al., 1991) The neonate is able to absorb the antibodies most efficiently during the first 16 h of life (Casal et al., 1994) , although this period may be extended somewhat if feeding is delayed. The transfer of colostral antibodies, especially IgG, is so efficient that immunoglobulin levels in the neonate may exceed those of the dam shortly after birth (Yamada et al., 1991) .",

Activation of NK cells results in NK cell-derived IFN-7, which activates the macrophage, resulting in augmented effector functions.

Peritoneal macrophages from cats infected with FIV had decreased IL-1 secretion, although the macrophages had enhanced antimicrobial activity compared to controls (Lin and Bowman, 1992) . This may be related to macrophage activation by in vivo conditioning from IFNT, which our laboratory has demonstrated to be upregulated in the lymph nodes of FIV-infected cats (J. Levie, unpublished data). Differences also exist between different populations of resident macrophages because feline peritoneal macrophages had higher microbicidal activity and released more IL-1 in response to LPS stimulation than feline alveolar macrophages (Lin and Bowman, 1991) .

Apparently typical classical and alternative complement pathways have been identified in cat serum (Grant, 1977; Day et al., 1980; Kobilinsky et al., 1980; Grant and Michalek, 1981; Goddard et al., 1987; Hosoi et al., 1990; Fevereiro et al., 1993; Buerke et al., 1995) . Cat C1 has been partially purified (Olsen et al., 1974) , and cat C3 was purified and identified as a dimer of two polypeptide chains of 128 and 71 kDa (Jacobse-Geels et al., 1980) . Cat complement (C') components appear to be interchangeable with those of other species, e.g. cat C1 will initiate the classical pathway when subsequent components are derived from guinea-pig (Olsen et al., 1974) ; guinea-pig C2 will activate purified cat C3, and the resulting C5 convertase will initiate formation of the membrane attack complex with purified human C' components C5 through C9 (J. M. McCarty and C. K. Grant, unpublished data) . As in other species, spontaneous activation of feline C1 is prevented by C1 esterase inhibitor C1 INH , and cat C3 is inhibited by cobra venom factor (CVF). Like humans, mice, rabbits and cows, the cat C2 gene is very closely spaced to the related Factor B gene, and the upstream sequence element of all five mammalian species is highly conserved (Moreira et al., 1995) .",

As such, valid inferences can probably be drawn from studies of C' metabolism in health or disease of other species; this is important because a paucity of information exists on the interactions of feline C' and pathogenesis. Complement level fluctuations, and in particular hypocomplementemia, have been regularly observed in FeLV infections, FeLV-related tumors and nonregenerative anemias, but C' levels and C' consumption are factors in the pathogenesis of other viral infections such as feline infectious peritonitis (FIP), feline herpesvirus type-1 (FHV), and probably FIV and parasitic infections. Complement-dependent antibodies lyse viruses and other pathogenic organisms, but they are less effective if C' levels are severely reduced or not available, hence further studies of cat C' levels during the courses of pathogenesis are required.

To date, there have been relatively few age-related studies to the development of cat serum immunoglobulins (Barlough et al., 1981) . Early studies would indicate that by 50 days of gestation there are significant serum immunoglobulin levels (Okoshi et al., 1968) , which are comparable to that found in presuckled neonates.

Lymphocytes first appear in fetal circulation at about 25 days of gestation. Studies in other species have shown that pre-B cells (cytoplasmic/l +, surface Ig-) are first detectable in fetal liver and later in bone marrow, where they are generated throughout life. Pre-B cells have been detected in the fetal liver of cats of 42 days of domestic gestation, but earlier fetuses have not been examined. Surface IgM \u00a7 B cells were also detectable in 42-day-old fetal liver, and it would appear that, as in other species, feline liver and bone marrow are the sites of origin and differentiation of cells of the B-lineage. Following birth the frequency of splenic B cells increases rapidly, with no further increase observed between 12 weeks old and adulthood. The majority of splenic, blood and bone marrow B-cells express surface IgM, with a smaller number expressing surface IgG. In cats, plasma cells secreting IgM are most frequent in the bone marrow from 1-week-old animals, but as animals mature the frequency of IgG plasma cells increases, reflecting isotype switching and clonal expansion in response to environmental antigens. In contrast to humans, rodents and rabbits, feline B cells preferentially express 2 over/c light chains (~4\"1), but this would appear to be independent of age and environmental exposure (Klotz et al., 1985) .",

A recently published study (Sellon et al., 1996) has extended these findings and shown that during the last few weeks of gestation there were significant changes in the numbers and proportion of lymphocyte subsets. The most dramatic was a threefold increase in the proportion of cells staining for a pan-T cell marker, and it has been speculated that this may reflect hormonal influences associated with parturition. During the first 4 weeks after birth there is a dramatic increase in the number of Ig \u00a7 B cells, probably reflecting a response to environmental antigens. Interestingly, at this time there is also an increase in the absolute number and proportion of null cells (sIg-, pan T-). Kittens are born with greater CD4:CD8 ratios (~3.5:1) than adults (~ 1.5:1). Changes in the ratio towards an adult phenotype would appear to be primarily due to an increase in CD8 \u00a7 T cells, but this may not be reached until about 1 year old, and this would appear to be sensitive to antigenic exposure.",

As in other species IELs are more numerous in the feline small intestine (~23 IELs/100 epithelial cells, EC) than colon (~4 IELs/100 EC). At both sites the majority of feline IELs are fCD8 +, fCD5 +. The intestinal epithelium of rodents, man and guinea pigs express MHC class II antigens, whereas that of pigs, sheep and cattle do not. In species expressing epithelial class II it is restricted to the small intestine, the large bowel epithelium being negative or only very weakly positive in healthy animals (Bland, 1988) . The tissue distribution is restricted to the fully differentiated absorptive enterocytes on the upper twothirds of the villus. In the cat, the colonic epithelial cells are uniformly negative for MHC class II antigens, while a small proportion of the small intestinal epithelial cells contain MHC class II antigens intracellularly, within vesicular like structures in the supranuclear region. The biological role of epithelial class II antigens is unclear but it has been shown in species with constitutive expression of class II that it can be further enhanced in response to intestinal inflammation. Under these conditions not only is there increased expression upon mature small intestinal enterocytes, but expression may also be induced upon immature crypt cells and, in inflammatory bowel disease, upon colonic epithelium. No results of similar studies in the cat have been reported.",

In contrast, it is suggested that the lamina propria is essentially an effector organ involved in surveillance and in the provision of help during the rapid responses to recall antigens. Such mechanisms may include both active protective responses against potential pathogens as well as the prevention of damaging allergic responses to dietary and environmental antigens. Difficulties associated with the isolation of viable cells from the lamina propria and Peyer's patches have delayed functional analysis of the cellular and molecular basis of these mechanisms. However, it has been shown that whereas Peyer's patch cells produce relatively more IL-2 and IFN-7, lamina propria cells synthesized relatively more IL-4, IL-5 and IL-6. Recent studies in cats have focused upon reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) analysis of cells isolated from the colon and have detected mRNA encoding for a number of cytokines. While the detailed analysis of local cytokine production and receptor expression in this species has yet to be completed, it is noteworthy that in asymptomatic feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV)-infected cats there was enhanced expression of IL-2, IL-6 and IL-10 (Sturgess, unpublished observations).",

Allergic diseases are mediated by the IgE system. This system is an integral part of the skin and mucosal defenses to parasite invasion and migration. Parasites shed surface proteins into the surrounding tissues during invasion and migration, especially at key stages in their growth, such as molting. These antigenic substances stimulate the production of specific IgE antibodies by plasma cells in local diffuse lymphoid aggregates. Once produced, IgE antibodies circulate only briefly before becoming firmly bound to the surface of tissue mast cells and basophils. Basophils and mast cells that are coated with specific IgE antibodies are said to be 'sensitized'. Sensitized basophils and mast cells are potent deterrents to further parasite migration or invasion. Antigens released by the parasites during invasion or migration will bind to specifically sensitized mast cells in the immediate area and, if sufficient amounts of specific IgE are complexed, the mast cells (or basophils in the case of blood-borne parasites) will release their granules into the surrounding milieu. These granules contain factors such as prostaglandins, leukotrienes, histamine, eosinophil chemotactic factor, slow-reacting sub-stance of anaphylaxis, and platelet-activating factor. The resultant reaction is characterized by increased vascular permeability at the site, local edema, fibrin meshing, smooth muscle contraction and the influx of large numbers of eosinophils. This inflammatory reaction slows the migration of the parasites and provides a milieu in which the immune attack can be launched. The primary effector cell is the eosinophil, which, when activated, has the ability to contact directly and kill parasites through potent oxidants and cationic substances present in its granules.",

Glandular secretions onto the skin and mucous membranes also contain nonspecific antimicrobial substances. The cilia of certain mucous membranes, such as those of the upper respiratory and lower urogenital tracts, act as brooms to trap and sweep out foreign material.

Specific cellmediated immunity involves CTLs bearing the CD8 cell surface marker. Nonactivated CTLs possess surface immunoglobulin-like receptors that act to recognize foreign antigens; each cell bearing receptors for a single antigen. If a host cell becomes infected or in some other manner antigenically altered, some of the foreign antigens will be arrayed on its surface in conjunction with the proteins of MHC I. The CTLs will then come in intimate contact with the abnormal cell by receptor/ligand interactions. Antigen recognition will cause this specific subset of cells to clonally expand, yielding a larger population of specifically activated CTLs and memory cells. Specifically activated CTLs will then come into intimate contact with the antigenically altered cells through the same recognition mechanism and secrete substances that will cause their death. CTLs also send chemical signals to macrophages, causing them to activate and become cell killers or to destroy any microbes that they may have internalized. CTLs are helped in their activity by CD4 + T cells (Thelper cells). Therefore, deficiencies in specific cellular immunity can arise from deficiencies in number and/or function of CTLs, T-helper cells or macrophages. This system also has inhibitory controls mediated by a subset of CD8 + T-cells known as T-suppressor cells.",

IgA in the cat is dimeric in the bloodstream; a small secretory protein is added by the epithelial cells as it is transported from the blood side to luminal side of the mucosa.

The other extreme in conjunction with FeLV infection is the intestinal lymphoma, which occurs predominantly in older animals, has the highest percentage of B-cell lymphomas and only in less than 20% of the cases produces FeLV. FeLV infection was not demonstrated in association with plasma cell tumors, mast cell tumors, and thymomas. The relative risk of developing a tumor is in FeLV-positive cats 29 times higher than in FeLV-negative cats for mediastinal lymphoma, nine times higher for multicentric lymphoma, and six times higher for the miscellaneous lymphoma group. The overall risk of developing the myelo-or lympho-proliferative disease is for a FeLV-positive cat seven times higher than for a FeLV-negative cat. FeLV does not carry an onc gene. Cellular onc genes and other cell development regulating genes, however, can be picked up and transduced after infection of a cell and thus foster tumor formation. A transforming effect is also possible via sequences of provirus DNA integrated into the cellular genome which may influence the expression of cellular genes.",

            "text": "The second agent known to enhance the risk for the development of lymphomas is the feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), a retrovirus from the genus lentivirus. A FIVpositive cat has a five times greater chance of developing lymphomas than a FIV-negative cat. These lymphomas are mostly high-grade B-cell lymphomas of the centroblastic or immunoblastic subtypes as in human and simian immunodeficiency virus infection. Their pathogenesis is thought to be associated with the polyclonal B-cell stimulation occurring after FIV infection. A direct transforming effect of FIV is not to be expected because FIV provirus is not demonstrable in the lymphoid tumor cells of FIVpositive cats.",

With the increasing availability of reagents and techniques, research will without doubt continue to progress at a rapid pace. Novel approaches in vaccinology based on new adjuvant preparations including cytokines such as IL-12, IFN-y and IL-18, newly produced antigens for mucosal immunization, DNA plasmid injections and others may help to further improve the cat's health. The likelihood that an efficacious feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) vaccine will be introduced to the field looks promising as many groups could repeat the first successful results published by Yamamoto (1991 Yamamoto ( , 1993 . The detection and quantification of cytokines will help characterize the pathogenesis of diseases and assays to measure cytokines may soon become important not only for research but also for veterinary practice. In addition, use of cytokines may eventually become important for immunotherapy of diseases such as FIV infection and feline infectious peritonitis, an almost always fatal disease associated with feline coronavirus infection which affects between 5 and 12% of all cats under 1 year old.",

The DRB molecule consists of a 29 a.a. leader sequence followed by a 95 a.a. bl domain, 104 a.a. b2 domain, 23 a.a. transmembrane and 16 a.a. cytoplasmic domain.",
