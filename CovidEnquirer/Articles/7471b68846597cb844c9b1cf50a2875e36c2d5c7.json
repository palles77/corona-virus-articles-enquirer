            "text": "A lmost 4 million babies are born in the US each year with approximately 12% of those births occurring prematurely. 1 Preterm infants suffer significant respiratory morbidity because of lung immaturity at birth, especially those born before 32 weeks gestation. The more severe cases are diagnosed with bronchopulmonary dysplasia (BPD) based on oxygen requirement near term corrected gestational age. However, infants born at less than 32 weeks who do not develop BPD and those born moderate to late preterm, from 32 to <37 weeks gestation, also have an increased prevalence of respiratory symptoms and rehospitalization because of respiratory problems during their first year of life as well as a greater degree of respiratory symptoms at preschool age. 2, 3 Viral respiratory infections contribute to poor respiratory outcomes and are the most common pathogens identified in children under the age of 18 years hospitalized for community-acquired pneumonia. 4 In addition to well-documented outbreaks, a prior surveillance study suggested a high burden of on-going respiratory viral infections in preterm infants born at less than 32 weeks gestation while they are still hospitalized in the neonatal intensive care unit (NICU). 5 NICU infections with human rhinovirus also have been described in both extremely and moderately preterm infants and postulated as a cause of significant respiratory morbidity. 6 A recent report identified respiratory viral infections in a number of clinically significant systemic illnesses in the NICU population and suggested that testing for viral respiratory pathogens may be helpful in the diagnostic evaluation of infants developing signs of sepsis after the first 72 hours of age (late-onset sepsis). 7 We sought to determine the full extent of viral respiratory infections in the extremely to moderately preterm population in the NICU and during the first 4 months following discharge from the hospital. This study is part of a larger study of infant immune system development and respiratory function (Prematurity, Respiratory outcomes, Immune System and Microbiome study or PRISM) that is part of the Respiratory Pathogens Research Center at the University of Rochester. We hypothesized that the risk of respiratory viral infections in preterm babies in the NICU was significantly lower than term infants residing in the community. Secondarily, we hypothesized that the rate of respiratory viral infections in preterm infants would rise to match the term infants' rate of infection once they were discharged from the NICU. ",

For the NICU vs community comparison, time to first infection was calculated as the interval between birth date and infection date for the first infection for preterm babies and discharge date and infection date for term babies. For the comparison of both cohorts in the community, time to first infection was the interval between discharge date and infection date. Time to repeat infection was the interval between previous and current infection dates. Log-rank test and Kaplan-Meier nonparametric estimation of infection-free probability curves were used to compare days with infection between groups (eg, cohort [preterm vs term], sex [female vs male], and others).

The first infant had symptoms including sneezing, progressive congestion, and cough, and the clinical team suspected a viral respiratory infection. RSV was identified in the clinical laboratory and by weekly study sampling obtained the following day. The second infant had tachypnea and tachycardia and the following day had an elevated temperature to 38.1\u00b0C. Coronavirus 4 was identified by the clinical laboratory and in the study sample the following day. The third infant underwent a sepsis evaluation for bacterial infection 9 days before hRV was identified in a study sample. Worsening respiratory function prompted the sepsis investigation that included a tracheal aspirate for bacterial culture and Mycoplasma culture but no viral diagnostic studies were performed and the symptoms were attributed to evolving BPD when all routine cultures were negative. A weekly study specimen obtained 4 days before the sepsis evaluation was negative for respiratory pathogens. At the time of hRV identification, (Table IV ; available at www.jpeds.com). Seventy-one percent of term babies were infected within 4 months with 27% acquiring a viral respiratory infection in the first 2 months of life. Preterm infants had a slightly higher rate of infection, with 37% acquiring at least 1 infection in the 2 months after discharge. However, the difference in the likelihood of acquiring at least 1 respiratory viral infection in the first 4 months between the 2 groups while living in the community was not significant (P = .39).

Previous studies have shown that respiratory samples obtained from the nasal turbinates with a flocked swab have similar sensitivity to nasopharyngeal aspirates and that adding a throat swab to a nasal swab improves the detection of respiratory viruses. 33, 34 In addition, viral identification by polymerase chain reaction is highly sensitive, and the TAC platform has been shown to have at least equivalent detection of viral nucleic acid as other commercially available detection systems. 16 Prior studies also have identified extended periods of shedding of respiratory viruses (\u22657 days), especially in younger age cohorts, suggesting that our sampling should have been sufficient to identify infections in our NICU population. 5, [35] [36] [37] [38] [39] Our pre-and postdischarge TAC platform and sampling techniques were identical and readily detected viral infections in both term and preterm infants after discharge, supporting the study design. A further limitation is that we did not obtain respiratory samples specifically at the time of suspected sepsis while the preterm infants were in the NICU, and our sampling schedule differed between hospitalized infants and those living in the community. Nevertheless, our data suggest that weekly sampling was sufficient to identify both symptomatic and asymptomatic infections in hospitalized preterm infants. Once living in the community, the monthly sampling schedule likely missed asymptomatic infections in both preterm and term infants. However, as the schedule was the same between these 2 groups and we were comparing the infection rates between them, we do not believe this limitation substantially changes our results. \u25a0 ",
