            "text": "Vpu, a component unique to HIV-1, greatly enhances the efficiency of viral particle release by unclear mechanisms. This Vpu function is intrinsically linked to its channel-like structure, which enables it to interfere with homologous transmembrane structures in infected cells. Because Vpu interacts destructively with host background K \u00fe channels that set the cell resting potential, we hypothesized that Vpu might trigger viral release by destabilizing the electric field across a budding membrane. Here, we found that the efficiency of Vpu-mediated viral release is inversely correlated with membrane potential polarization. By inhibiting the background K \u00fe currents, Vpu dissipates the voltage constraint on viral particle discharge. As a proof of concept, we show that HIV-1 release can be accelerated by externally imposed depolarization alone. Our findings identify the trigger of Vpu-mediated release as a manifestation of the general principle of depolarization-stimulated exocytosis.",

            "text": "One major distinction between HIV-1 and the less virulent HIV-2 is the unique presence of vpu in the former. The main function of Vpu is to expedite the spread of viral progeny (1) . Vpu is a small, versatile protein that is capable of interacting with a wide range of host proteins, including bTrCP (2), UBP (3), CD74 (4), BST-2/tetherin (5, 6) , CAML (7) , and background two-pore K \u00fe (K 2P ) channel TASK (8) . BST-2/ tetherin and TASK are capable of suppressing HIV-1 release by direct interaction with Vpu (5) (6) (7) (8) . BST-2/tetherin has been proposed to counteract Vpu-mediated release by retaining, or gluing, the viral membrane to the host plasma membrane after fission. However, BST-2/tetherin also inhibits viral release in diverse classes of viruses that lack Vpu, so the mechanism of Vpu-mediated release is likely complex and involves multiple cellular/physiological processes (9) (10) (11) (12) (13) .",

The fact that these two distinct activities can be solely elicited from the expression of a unique transmembrane structure shared by both Vpu and Ttm1 suggests a coupled mechanism (8) .

However, the latter two mutants showed functionally distinctive profiles. Therefore, we used these three mutants to test our hypothesis for the mechanism of Vpu-mediated release. These point mutations did not affect the expression of Vpu or the protein-protein oligomerization between TASK and Vpu in the heterologously expressed HEK-293 cells (Fig. S1 ). However, the interaction between Vpu and each mutant led to very different functional consequences. Both TASK R40A and TASK AQA exhibited fivefold higher single-channel activities than wild-type TASK, but Vpu inhibited only TASK AQA (70-80% inhibition, the same as for the wildtype channel in Fig. 2 B) . TASK R40A , with a singlechannel conductance threefold that of TASK AQA or the wild-type, maintained its currents and the cell membrane potential upon Vpu coexpression (Fig. 2) . TASK R40A also outperformed TASK and TASK AQA in restricting Vpumediated viral release (80% vs. 50% inhibition in Fig. 3 ). On the other hand, TASK R38A , with very little protein expression (Fig. S1 ), did not exhibit any detectable channel activities (Fig. 2) or the ability to suppress Vpu-mediated release (Fig. 3) . We observed that when TASK currents remained substantial, Vpu-assisted release was stagnant. There appears to be an inverse relationship between the magnitude of background K \u00fe conductance and the efficiency of Vpu-mediated release. Conceivably, suppression of the stabilizing background K \u00fe currents could unleash viral particle release.",

To dissipate the restricting electric field across a budding membrane, Vpu probably acts like a membrane depolarizer that diminishes the stabilizing background K \u00fe currents. Indeed, when heterologously expressed in IL-2-activated, human CD4\u00fe T cells, Vpu induced 15-20 mV of membrane potential depolarization. This Vpu activity functionally resembled that of TASK siRNA in dissipating the endogenous background K \u00fe conductance in T lymphocytes (34) : both were capable of depolarizing transmembrane potentials and reducing membrane sensitivity to extracellular K \u00fe (Fig. 5) . Others have shown that Vpu heterologously expressed in Xenopus oocytes also inhibits K \u00fe permeation (15) .

Instead, Vpu probably inhibited by reducing the number of functional background K \u00fe channels on the plasma membrane, and this process likely took place intracellularly. Because Vpu is a connector to the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation pathway, it is capable of accelerating degradation of interfering host proteins and channels (2, 8) . In this way, Vpu, and perhaps other viroporins as well, could remotely enhance virus discharge on the plasma membrane while being predominantly localized in the perinuclear regions (21, 35) . FIGURE 4 The efficiency of Vpu-mediated HIV-1 release is directly proportional to the degree of membrane potential depolarization. The plot combines data from Figs. 2 C and 3 and shows a direct relationship between residual cell potentials and HIV-1 release efficiencies. Each dot represents an averaged value. The observed relation can be dissected into two consecutive vectors: 1), membrane potential depolarization; and 2), release acceleration. As a proof of concept, we verified the direct involvement of Dj in HIV-1 release by manipulating membrane potentials. We adopted two methods to test the effects of depolarization on release. In the first approach, we depolarized cell potentials by knocking down the endogenous TASK channels in HeLa cells expressing vpu-inactivated HIV-1 (NL4-3/Udel), and found that this alone promoted viral release up to sevenfold (Fig. 6) . Knockdown of endogenous TASK1/3/5 elevated the rates of virus release more effectively in the absence of Vpu than in the presence of Vpu. Since HIV-1 particles are heterogeneous, the induced particles by membrane potential depolarization were also examined for infectivity. The viral particles released from the cells treated with TASK1/3/5 siRNA showed infectivity comparable to the particles from the cells treated with the nonspecific siRNA (Fig. S2) . Thus, depolarization-induced viral particles are functional. This result is reminiscent of an early finding that particles derived from vpu-inactivated HIV-1 NL4-3/Udel are as infectious as those derived from NL4-3 (28) , reinforcing the notion that membrane potential depolarization by either TASK siRNA or Vpu primarily affects the final fission step and not the earlier steps (e.g., packaging).",

Cell culture media were replaced with depolarizing high K \u00fe media 1 day after transfection with the HIV-1 proviral plasmids (NL4-3 versus NL4-3/Udel lacking vpu expression). In HeLa cells expressing NL4-3/Udel, high K \u00fe -imposed depolarization enhanced virus release up to sevenfold (Fig. 7) . Depolarization-induced viral release was significantly less pronounced in the cells expressing complete HIV-1 (NL4-3) . The high-K \u00fe effect was more evident in the absence of Vpu (Fig. 7) , pointing to an occlusive mechanism involving membrane potential depolarization. The results again support the notion that there exists a transmembrane voltage constraint for viral release that can be sufficiently dissipated by HIV-1 Vpu. To the extent that Vpu may form homo-oligomers, the channels thus formed may further attenuate Dj to promote viral fission and release (16, 17, 36) .",

This discovery was based on earlier findings that the effect of Vpu on release enhancement is cell-type-dependent (37) . For example, the efficiency of viral release in HeLa and human CD4\u00fe T cells is greatly enhanced by Vpu, whereas the efficiency in HEK-293T cells is Vpu-independent. Furthermore, because Vpu is capable of facilitating the release of widely divergent retroviruses, the mechanisms used by Vpu to promote release are likely intrinsic to various types of host cells (38) . Studies that examined differences in gene expression between Vpu-dependent (e.g., HeLa) and Vpu-independent (e.g., HEK-293T) cell lines showed that BST-2 is expressed in Vpu-dependent cells but not in Vpu-independent cells, and is an endogenous restricting factor against viral release (5, 6, 9) . It has been suggested that the rate of release in Vpu-independent (permissive) cells is not affected by Vpu expression because their endogenous BST-2 is too low to counteract Vpu effectively to limit the release. In contrast, in Vpu-dependent (restrictive) cells, viral release is limited in the absence of Vpu due to the comparably higher endogenous BST-2 levels. However, the protective effect of endogenous BST-2 in the restrictive cells can be diminished by Vpu expression, which allows acceleration of viral release (5) .",

It has been proposed that Vpu antagonizes BST-2 by accelerating degradation of BST-2 through its interaction with bTrCP and other components of the ubiquitin-proteasome degradation system (39, 40) . Thus, whether a cell type is permissive or restrictive appears to be influenced by the expression levels of the endogenous restriction factors. This notion also fits our mutant data, in which the degree of release enhancement by Vpu was directly proportional to the magnitude of inhibition Vpu imposed on background K \u00fe conductance (Fig. 4) .",

            "text": "To integrate the BST-2 model with the proposed depolarization mechanism, we investigated whether the effects of background K 2P channel activities on HIV-1 release were also cell-type-dependent. We first determined the endogenous TASK levels in HEK-293 (permissive) versus HeLa (restrictive) cells, and then assessed their impact on Vpumediated release. Current clamp experiments revealed that HeLa cells had more polarized resting membrane potentials than did HEK-293 cells (Fig. 8 A) . Based on the degrees of membrane potential depolarization by TASK siRNA, HeLa cells expressed significantly more TASK than HEK-293 cells (Fig. 8 A) . Knockdown of endogenous TASK depolarized both cell lines to similar voltages, indicating that TASK1/3/5 channels were primarily responsible for setting cell membrane potentials in these cell lines (Fig. 8 A) . Because HEK-293 cells expressed smaller background K \u00fe conductance than HeLa cells, they were likely to impose smaller restricting Dj on particle release. Indeed, membrane potential depolarization induced by elevated [K \u00fe ] out enhanced NL4-3/Udel release up to 2.5-fold in HEK-293 cells (Fig. 8 B) , and the enhancement was not as large as in HeLa cells (Fig. 7) . On the other hand, release enhancement by depolarization was much smaller (&50%) in the presence of Vpu for both cell lines (Figs. 7 and 8 B) , again suggesting depolarization as a triggering mechanism for Vpu-mediated release. Because elevation of extracellular K \u00fe drove different cells to the same depolarized potentials, particle release from HEK-293 cells, which had smaller restricting Dj, was affected less by depolarization than release from HeLa cells (Figs. 7 and 8 B) . A comparison of the results from HEK-293 versus HeLa cells (Figs. 7 and 8) shows that their different degrees of NL4-3/Udel release enhancement by depolarization reflect the different degrees of membrane potential polarization (or, in essence, TASK expression) of the two cell lines. Conceivably, the size of background K \u00fe conductance could also help determine whether a particular cell type is permissive or restrictive.",

Any significant changes in the membrane potentials of the host cells (such as depolarization, as presented here) could affect the fission process. Upon completion of virus-cell fission, their membranes become separate, so Dj in the host cells no longer has any impact on the viruses.

We hypothesize that dissipation of this energy barrier essentially reduces the contact repulsion between the two apposing membranes to be fused. Imposing the depolarization further (i.e., high K \u00fe stimulation for Vpu\u00fe cells, or up from the gray-shaded transmembrane voltage barrier in the model) may be redundant, since after fission the restricting force for viral particle release is of a different nature. Others have suggested that after fission, BST-2/tetherin may still retain, or glue, the viral membrane to the host cell membrane (5,6) (Fig. 9) .",

Activation of background K 2P channels such as TASK leads to hyperpolarization and suppression of the excitatory drive and secretion (31, 41) . In motoneurons, activation of native TASK-like current using the inhalational anesthetic halothane also leads to hyperpolarization and suppression of neuronal firing (33) . In a study of adrenal glands, inactivation of native TASK depolarizes the membrane potentials, leading to enhancement of aldosterone secretion (32) . Analogous inhibition of another background K 2P channel, TREK-1, by corticotropin, promotes cortisol secretion in bovine adrenal fasciculate cells (30). Although HIV-1 release differs importantly in its mechanistic details from secretion/exocytosis processes, they can all be induced by a destabilized electric field. The channel-like structure of Vpu enables it to depolarize the budding membrane, making particle release an energetically favorable process. Its unique presence in HIV-1 conceivably contributes to the particularly high transmissibility and disease progression of HIV-1 as compared to HIV-2 or other lentiviruses.",

FIGURE 9 A model depicts virus release as a function of membrane potentials (V m ). In/Out refers to the position of budding viruses (circles) inside or outside of the plasma membrane (horizontal lines). Dashed boxes mark the resting states of V m . Vpu depolarizes the resting V m . The gray shade represents the proposed transmembrane voltage barrier for particle budding. Red arrows point to membrane potential instability/depolarization (\u00fe), and blue arrows point to potential stability/hyperpolarization (\u00c0). Vpu-induced depolarization likely diminishes the electric and/or contact repulsion as two opposing membranes are about to fuse. After membrane fusion/fission occurs, BST-2/tetherin may restrict viral release by gluing viral membranes to the cell surface. The resting membrane potentials of HeLa cells (restrictive) are more polarized than that of HEK-293 cells (permissive). According to the proposed membrane potential model, the energy barrier for release in HeLa cells may be significantly larger than the barrier in HEK-293 cells. According to the tetherin/tethering model for restrictive cells, such as HeLa, endogenous BST-2 may limit particle release by physically binding to both viral and host cell membranes in the absence of Vpu (as shown in the upper left panel). In the presence of Vpu, endogenous BST-2 is not sufficient to limit the release (as shown by dashed lines in the upper-right panel).",
