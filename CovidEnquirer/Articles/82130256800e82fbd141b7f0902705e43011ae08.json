            "text": "At the 2000 European Association of Zoo and Wildlife Veterinarians (EAZWV) Congress in Paris, the establishment of an Infectious Diseases Working Group (IDWG) within the EAZWV was proposed. In North America, the American Association of Zoo Veterinarians (AAZV) already had an Infectious Disease Committee since the early 1990s. In Europe, this idea for a similar committee emerged when the problems of diagnosing and handling paratuberculosis were discussed in a presentation. It was obvious that commonly agreed recommendations were urgently needed for improved control of the infectious diseases that threatened the European collections. Also, as Europe was becoming more unified, it was necessary to deal with European politics and legislation via international collaboration. The idea to produce a comprehensive document containing disease fact sheets, legislation, laboratories, identifiable diseases, and so on resulted in the IDWG, which led to the production of the first edition The foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) outbreak in Europe in 2001 clearly underlined the importance of this initiative and made agreement on European standards a matter of even greater urgency. During this outbreak, the difficulties in controlling diseases in domesticated animals was realized; public opinion, politics, money, limited knowledge of the disease, and lack of agreement on legislation all contributed to this situation. It became obvious that even more misunderstandings would arise when dealing with such diseases in lesser-studied animals, including nondomestic species. In 2006, the highly pathogenic avian influenza spread across Europe and threatened zoo collections. Outbreaks of classic swine fever also occurred. Additionally, blue tongue disease created serious problems in transporting hoof stock and thus jeopardized organized programs for breeding endangered species. 5 African swine fever, West Nile virus (WNV), African horse sickness, and monkeypox also threatened zoologic collections. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic (related to an animal coronavirus) confirmed these ",

Differing opinions (e.g., whether or not to vaccinate against FMD and avian influenza), various levels of veterinary faculties and laboratories, and thus differences in the rates of successful diagnoses, pose further problems for European zoo veterinarians.",

The idea of the Group is to combine knowledge to deal more effectively with future disease outbreaks that may threaten zoo collections. The effort to create a reference manual published under the umbrella of EAZWV was, and still is, an important step in the process of standardization for zoos in Europe, and it should provide a useful tool for zoo practitioners, zoo managers, and European legislative authorities dealing with wildlife and zoo animals.",

This committee already has its own Infectious Disease Reviews Notebook published in the early 1990s. This Notebook contained loose leaf handouts, with descriptions of various diseases important for zoo veterinarians and fact sheets on the diagnostics of important diseases such as tuberculosis. After the second edition of the EAZWV-IDWG Transmissible Diseases Handbook was published in May 2004, Dr. Julie Napier, a member of the AAZV and the chair of the IDC at the time, proposed creating a handbook for infectious diseases affecting nondomestic species and wildlife in North America, using the European version as a template (see Figure 68 -1).",

Following discussions on providing a similar tool for North American veterinarians, it was agreed that the IDC could use the European disease fact sheet as a template, which provided a standardized and unified format. Thanks to the hard work of many people under the leadership of Dr. Julie Napier and Dr. Kathryn Gamble, The first American edition was published in 2011, titled Infectious Disease Manual 2011, with the subtitle \"Infectious Diseases of Concern to Captive and Free-Ranging Wildlife in North America\" (Boxes 68-1 and 68-2 ). An update of the manual was released at the end of 2013.",

The handbooks help find answers to the question \"What should I do\" when an infectious disease is suspected. Furthermore, it is critical to standardize surveillance programs for infectious diseases in zoos, especially with regard to inter-zoo exchanges. Both the European and American handbooks assist in overcoming the differences and attaining the required standardization by legislation such as the Balai Directive (92/65/EC) in Europe. 1 Both manuals are designed to be overviews or reviews and are not scientific textbooks. For detailed information on all diseases, it is necessary to refer to textbooks. The handbooks summarize information related to various diseases: susceptible animals, zoonotic potential, clinical symptoms, pathology, diagnostic methods, qualified laboratories, treatment, prevention, experts who may be consulted, legislation, and relevant literature. The detailed table of contents and the standardized format of the fact sheets should help the reader find information quickly. Most of the fact sheets in both manuals were peer reviewed by two experts, which makes these notebooks accepted reference documents for zoo associations in the respective regions of the world. Both handbooks are intended to be \"living\" books, as the information presented becomes outdated if revisions are not made regularly. A continuous updating process is therefore maintained to make them reliable and useful tools.",

This significantly reduced the costs of production and distribution. Another advantage was the ability to increase the contents, without concerns about number of pages (the second edition was already 662 pages long!). Thus, the third and fourth editions contain more information on legislation and other new topics, thus a lot more pages. A printed version would have become too big and cost-prohibitive in terms of production and distribution. It was also hoped that this format would allow easier global access, which turned out to be the case. The fourth edition, like the previous editions, was distributed to all EAZWV members, all EAZA zoos, Central Veterinary Officers of the 27 EU Member States, the OIE, and the SANCO in Brussels. Another advantage of the book on a CD-ROM is the facility to search and have quick access to chapters and fact sheets (see Figure 68 -2).",
