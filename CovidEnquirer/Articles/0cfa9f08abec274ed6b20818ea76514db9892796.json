Characterization of the preparations by morphological, biochemical and serological methods indicated the specific enrichment of the plasma membranes as well as cell surface proteins.

Although the results of these studies reflect the interaction between IBDV and isolated cells only partially, the advantages of these plasma membrane preparations, the specific enrichment of cell surface proteins, their constant quality and the possibility to store aliquots over several months, make them a useful tool for virus binding studies with avian cells.",

Investigations of early interactions of virus particles with their receptor sites on the cell surface may provide important insight into host cell tropism and therefore, pathogenicity, and antiviral strategies can be evaluated on the basis of these results. Permanent cell lines are used most often for the investigation of the early steps in the viral life cycle in order to applicate a defined counterpart. However, to answer specific questions, especially with regard to host cell tropism, it will sometimes be necessary to use primary cells in order to mimic the in vivo conditions. Preparation of primary cells, for example lymphocytes, is time-consuming and may often be unsatisfactory due to variable results associated with the quantity and quality of the preparations. Furthermore, rapid cell degeneration can produce misleading results during the course of binding studies.",

(1983) with several modifications (see Fig. 1 ). All plastic and cellulose nitrate tubes were soaked in 1 mM EDTA pH 7.0 overnight and rinsed ten times with doubly distilled water before use. The cells, washed three times in the washing buffer described above, were resuspended in a 3-fold (w/v) excess of homogenization buffer (25.0 mM HEPES, 30 mM NaCl, 0.5 mM MgCl 2 , 1.0 mM dithiothreitol, 1.0 mM phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride, 1.0 vM pepstatin A; pH 8.0) and kept on ice for 10 min. Thereafter, the cells were disrupted by 30-40 strokes in a 'tight fitting' (lymphoid cells) or a 'loose fitting' (CEF) Dounce homogenizer, respectively. Immediately after homogenization restoration buffer was added (25.0 mM HEPES, 0.6 M NaCl, 0.5 mM MgCl 2 ; pH 8.0) in order to achieve a final concentration of NaCl of 154 mM. EDTA was added to a final concentration of 1 mM. After centrifugation (5000\u00d7 g, 10 min, 4\u00b0C, SS34 rotor, Sorvall), a 25 ml volume of the resulting supernatant was layered over 12 ml of a 25% sucrose cushion (sucrose was dissolved in isotonic homogenization buffer). After centrifugation (100000\u00d7g, 1 h, 4\u00b0C, SW28 rotor, Beckman L8-55), plasma membranes forming a white band at the interface were collected, diluted with washing buffer and sedimented by centrifugation (100000\u00d7g, 30 min, 4\u00b0C, SW41 rotor, Beckman L8-55). They were resuspended in washing buffer and the protein concentration was determined in a microtiter plate assay using BCA protein reagent (Pierce). Aliquots of the membranes were stored frozen at \u221220\u00b0C up to three months.",

Essentially, a phosphate-free buffer system was chosen to be able to characterize the membrane preparations biochemically by marker enzymes most of which release inorganic phosphate. When Tris buffers were used to stabilize the plasma membranes as recommended by Warren (1974) , the enzymatic activities were very low in the preparations. Therefore, a HEPES-based buffer (Ferber et al., 1972) , pH 8.0 to stabilize the cell membranes (Evans, 1987) , was used. An 0.5 mM concentration of MgCl 2 was employed in order to stabilize the nuclear membranes during incubation in hypotonic homogenization buffer (Allan and Crumpton, 1970; Ferber et al., 1972) since MgCl 2 at higher concentrations led to the aggregation of lymphoid cells. Homogenization with Dounce homogenizers was given preference to the Polytron homogenizers used by Maeda et al. (1983) because their mechanical forces proved to be more gentle for cell disruption. To prevent osmolytic damage of the cell compartments and to conserve the structures and the enzymatic activities in the plasma membranes, isotonic conditions were re-established immediately after homogenization by the addition of restoration buffer. EDTA was added to complex divalent cations as these can lead to aggregations of plasma membranes with the nucleus (Ferber et al., 1972) and also may activate metalloproteases. As a further modification, an additional step of differential centrifugation was undertaken prior to density gradient centrifugation in order to remove cell debris, mitochondria and nuclei from the homogenates. Centrifugation of the membrane preparations in discontinuous sucrose gradients (40, 30, 20 and 10%) showed an increase of plasma membrane-specific enzymes and a decrease of the marker enzyme for the endoplasmic reticulum at lower sucrose concentrations; yields, however, at 10% sucrose concentration was only low. Satisfactory results with regard to purity and yield were obtained by centrifugation of the plasma membranes on a 25% sucrose cushion, in accordance to a protocol described by Perdue (1974) .",

Binding of the serum proteins was less than 5% of total binding when virus was omitted. Similar results were ob-tained when a pre-immune serum was used.

Using this simple and rapid method a level of purity was achieved which, as indicated by (Na + +K + )-AT-Pase activity, was considerably higher than described for chicken cells before (Perdue and Sneider, 1970) .

CEF are larger than lymphoid cells; lymphoid cells isolated from bursa of Fabricius and spleen are larger than those isolated from thymus. Cells with a larger surface might express more virus binding sites and higher amounts of protein were present in the test. It might be speculated, therefore, that a larger number of virus particles can be bound. In contrast, the same amount of protein had been used for each cell type in the ELISA study.",
