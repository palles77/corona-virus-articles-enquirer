The policy establishes (1) a limited code status for patients with confi rmed or suspected EVD. Limited code status means that a code blue will not be called for patients with confi rmed or suspected EVD at any stage of the disease; however, properly protected providers (those already in full protective equipment) may initiate resuscitative eff orts if, in their clinical assessment, these eff orts are likely to benefi t the patient. The policy also requires that (2) resuscitation not be attempted for patients with advanced EVD, as resuscitation would be medically futile;",

Because of the uncertainty surrounding diagnosis and associated risk, the ethical justifi cation for following the proposed policy is weaker in suspected EVD than it is in confi rmed EVD. We err on the side of minimizing risk to health professionals during the limited time period in which EVD is reasonably suspected but not confi rmed. EVD can be reasonably suspected in situations where individuals present with early symptoms of EVD and have had exposure to the Ebola virus (ie, contact with the blood or bodily fluids of a person with EVD, contact with objects contaminated with the blood or bodily fluids of a person with EVD, or contact with animals infected with EVD). 6 EVD has a substantially higher death rate than other epidemic viral infections. Thus, there is a need to illuminate the duty to treat in the particular context of EVD. Faced with a patient in distress, providers' strong tendency is to attempt to rescue the patient. Yet, patient advocacy is ethically limited under circumstances where it poses a serious threat to the health or life of others, including health-care professionals. 7 Although clinicians should generally put self-regarding interests aside to serve those in need, this obligation is not absolute. Th e obligation to assist may be overridden when there is an unacceptably high risk to health-care professionals. We believe the risk to a provider who assists a patient with EVD without proper PPE training and use is suffi ciently high and overrides the obligation providers would ordinarily have in less risky situations.",

            "text": "Most patients with EVD in the United States are likely to be admitted before reaching advanced stages of EVD (eg, prior to developing refractory sepsis with multiorgan failure Although we agree that resuscitation is futile in patients with EVD with multisystem failure and uncontrolled bleeding, we do not agree that resuscitative eff orts are futile for \"most, if not all\" patients with EVD. For example, in patients with EVD with perfusing rhythms, there is a reasonable likelihood of benefi t from whatever limited resuscitation measures are available by a properly protected health-care professional who is proximal to the patient at the time of arrest. In this respect, we concur with Caplan (as quoted in Altman 5 ), who cautions that only patients with Ebola \"in extremis\" should be entirely excluded for all resuscitative eff orts. Resuscitative measures that can be off ered by a single provider already in the room at time of arrest are necessarily limited. For example, a single provider cannot simultaneously provide bag-mask ventilation and administer other necessary interventions, such as medications. 10 Th e ethical duty to off er limited resuscitation attempts is justifi ed on several grounds. First, health professionals agree to assume a standard level of risk of infection as part of entering their profession. 11, 12 As a consequence, assumption of risk has become part of the ethical practice of medicine and other healing professions. As Dwyer and Tsai 12 note, By choosing to become doctors, individuals accept some duty to treat\u2026Th e issue here is not a peripheral matter left up to individual choice, but a central concern that helps to defi ne the role of doctoring. 12 Assumption of risk is evident, for example, in statements of professional organizations, such as the American Medical Association (AMA) 13 and the American Nurses' Association. 14 Th e AMA recognizes that under special circumstances, such as urgent medical disasters, the obligation to assume personal risk to care for patients \"holds even in the face of greater than usual risks to their own safety, health, or life.\" 13 Th e AMA further notes that although health-care facilities should minimize risk (eg, by ensuring \"the availability of protective and preventive measures for physicians and others caring for patients with communicable disease\") they must also ensure access to appropriate medical care. 15 Th e American Nurses' Association posits an obligation to care for patients whenever the value of such care is greater than any harm the nurse might incur. Th is stance is qualifi ed by the requirement that nursing care not present more than minimal risk to the nurse. For example, a nurse's duty to treat a patient with AIDS may be overridden if the nurse is immunosuppressed, because that nurse's risk exceeds a level considered \"minimal.\" 14 In addition, the historical practice of assuming risk to provide care to patients with communicable diseases lends support to off ering limited attempted resuscitation to patients with EVD. 16 Recent history, including treatment of patients with HIV, AIDS, 17 severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), and hepatitis A, B, and C demonstrate a commitment on the part of health-care professionals to put patients fi rst, even at risk to their own health or life. Th us, the burden of proof lies with those who would deny a duty to assume the risk of treating patients with communicable disease. 18, 19 Th e proposed policy prohibits attempting resuscitation in late-stage EVD, when the likelihood of medical benefi t is exceedingly poor. Under these circumstances, resuscitative eff orts may be withheld from patients with EVD on grounds of medical futility. Th e logic of this approach is that the mere fact that a patient is imminently dying does not suffi ce to show that there is a duty to attempt rescue. 20 Aft er all, if the patient is actively dying, then any attempt to rescue the patient would fail and should not be instituted. If the likelihood or quality of benefi t falls well below a threshold considered minimal, the intervention should not be off ered or continued. 21 Th is approach applies to all patients, regardless of diagnosis. For both patients with and patients without EVD, the best available evidence shows that CPR and associated resuscitative measures are ineff ective and off er no benefi t in the setting of progressive multiorgan failure in a patient already receiving maximal supportive care. Medical futility also justifi es withholding other emergent invasive procedures, such as endotracheal intubation or vascular access, in the context of an arrest or other precipitous decline for patients with end-stage EVD. What is unique in the case of patients with EVD is that the medical futility of CPR may arise as a direct result of the delay in responding to the patient's emergency medical needs due to the requirement that all providers be properly donned with PPE. With current donning procedures, the time to prepare providers to respond to patient emergencies renders a standard resuscitation response impractical because of the rapid response required to help an acutely decompensated patient.",

Volume resuscitation and continued maintenance of intravascular volume status appears to be particularly important. Other organ supportive/ replacement therapies, including IV pressers , mechanical ventilation, and replacement therapy have also been used when indicated. When lifesaving measures are futile, providers should avoid suggesting to the patient and family that \"nothing\" can be done; they should instead assure the patient and family that everything possible will be done to keep the patient as comfortable as possible. 22 In addition to the above distinctions based on disease stage, we note that complicating factors may require case-by-case assessment. When this occurs, the trained and protected treating team should exercise discretion. An appeal to discretion is not ethically grounded in respect for provider autonomy, as some have argued 23 ; instead, it is based on principles of benefi cence and nonmalefi cence. Th e treating team must carefully weigh benefi ts (to the patient) and risks (to the team). Although appealing to team discretion is ethically supported, it carries the risk that similar cases will be treated diff erently by diff erent health-care teams.

Media coverage of EVD in the United States has sometimes focused on \"theoretical-but dramatic-possible mutations of the virus rather than consistent, clear, and scientifi cally supported messages regarding what is known about the virus and what US residents could do to protect their health.\" 28 When fear, rather than science, becomes the primary driver of EVD policies, this will likely result in suboptimal care for patients with EVD, unnecessary restrictions on civil liberties, or both. State-based proposals for 21-day quarantines of health-care workers and others returning to the United States from West Africa lacked a scientific basis and imposed unnecessary restrictions on individuals. The US Department of Defense's 21-day quarantine, which applied to all Defense Department personnel returning from EVDaff ected areas regardless of risk exposure, also lacked a basis in science, according to the Director of Health and Human Services, Sylvia Burwell. 29 When quarantines represent a way to manage fear, not Ebola, they do more harm than good. 30 Such measures not only place unfair restrictions on individuals, they also may dissuade health care professionals from contributing in the future to fi ghting the epidemic. 31 Avoiding this possibility requires carefully reviewing evidence on an ongoing basis. Just as It is now ethically untenable and medically unjustifi able to deny life-supporting therapies to patients with human immunodefi ciency virus (HIV) infection,\u2026only a few decades ago, the fear of HIV and the perception that AIDS was uniformly fatal led to an approach similar to that currently being taken for EVD. 32 When restricting individual liberties is necessary to protect the public health, the guiding principle should be a principle of least infringement. Th is requires applying the least restrictive measures possible to protect the public's health. 28 ",

Triage is a common interpretation of a utilitarian framework applied to emergency medical treatment when resources are limited. 33 Triage assigns priority to patients with serious injuries who can be improved with relatively simple procedures but who will not improve without aid. 34 Diff erent consequentialist assessments might be appropriate in resource-poor areas, such as Africa, that are responsible for treating many patients. Another criterion that furnishes an ethical basis for allocating scarce resources is the quantity of resources a patient is expected to consume.

Th is is not because of diagnosis, but because of the utilitarian value of saving the greatest number of lives. Following the American College of Chest Physicians (CHEST) guidelines, we endorse the same criteria regardless of whether a patient's need arises from EVD epidemic or unrelated conditions (eg, a motor vehicle accident). 36 Generally speaking, the principle of utility applies to all patients regardless of diagnosis. For example, if a hospital does not have enough staff or technology to provide RRT to all patients, priority should be assigned to patients with the best prognoses and greatest likelihood of benefi t from RRT; among patients with similar prognoses, priority should be assigned to those who require the fewest resources. In practical terms, the result of this approach may mean that a patient with EVD would be denied RRT. To summarize, the focus needs to be on likelihood of benefi t, amount of resource consumed, and duration of need (which includes staff time away from any other patient care), rather than on specifi c diagnoses. Th e ethical rationale for such an approach is a strictly utilitarian focus on benefi ts and burdens to aff ected parties.",

Jecker , PhD ; Denise M. Dudzinski , PhD , MTS ; Douglas S.

To address this challenge, we propose a model policy for resuscitation and emergent procedure policy of patients with EVD and set forth ethical principles that lend support to this policy.

In early-stage EVD, the predominant clinical symptoms are GI.8 Early life-threatening situations, such as electrolyte abnormalities, especially sodium and potassium, may result from profuse vomiting and diarrhea, potentially leading to complications, such as cardiac arrhythmia. Th ese complications might be reversible if aggressive life-saving interventions are used. For example, patients with an arrhythmia may benefi t from resuscitation measures, such as administration of medication through an existing line or the use of external pacing or a defi brillator. Th ese procedures should be performed by a health-care professional already in the patient's room and properly donned with PPE at time of the event. By contrast, in late-stage EVD, shock and severe metabolic disturbances occur, resulting in multiorgan failure, which is much less likely to respond to resuscitative measures.8 Our support for limited resuscitation contrasts with the approach of ethicists, such as Fins. 9 According to Fins, Bleeding patients may be harmed by CPR. Others yet to be intubated could sustain brain injury because of time delays necessitated by the need to arrive and don protective gear. For most, if not all, it will be a futile act because of the lethality of their advanced state of illness,[and]   the multisystem organ failure which precipitated cardiac arrest in the fi rst place.9",
