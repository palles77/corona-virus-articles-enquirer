However, this assumption has not been generally subject to rigorous econometric approach in the existing literature. To fill this gap, we assess the impact of the accreditation World Heritage status on the \"Historic Centre of Macau\" in 2005 on visitor numbers to the territory to identify the real effect of WHL on fostering tourism. In doing so, because of the policy restrictions on the mainland Chinese tourists, such tourists have been excluded from the analysis. The empirical results indicate that there is no significant effect of WHL on promoting tourism other than possibly a short-run tourism-enhancing impact. Notably, this effect is particularly relevant to Asian tourists. This paper discusses these results in the wider context of econometric analyses of tourism.",

While various factors have been clearly identified as significant in attracting international tourists, the degree of influence from being inscribed on the list of World Heritage Sites (WHSs) by the United Nations Educational, Scientific, and Cultural Organization (UNESCO) on international tourism demand remains subject to debate. Although the accreditation of the World Heritage List (WHL) was meant to identify, recognize, and protect scenic spots of global value, the WHL is now widely used as a marketing tool for national tourism campaigns. This strategy is rooted in the belief that the WHL is a powerful boost for attracting tourism. Surprisingly, the impact of the WHL on fostering tourism has been little explored by rigorous econometric approaches. Moreover, existing findings are far from being clear and robust.",

The F-test showed that the number of WHSs does not weaken the instrument for tourism specialization in crosssectional regressions. However, the first-difference results imply that instruments based on the WHL appear to be weak when exploiting the within variation.

However, the positive impact of WHSs becomes insignificant in the fixed-effect models. Inspired by Yang et al. (2010) , Cellini (2011) utilized data from Italy from 1996 to 2007 to show that UNESCO recognition is not an effective in attracting tourists. In response to Cellini (2011) , Yang and Lin (2011) stated that the impact of being included among sites on the WHL could be examined from both cross-sectional and time-series dimensions. However, due to the time-invariant feature of the WHL variables in the short-run, the time-dimensional effect of the WHL based on a fixed-effects model may not be reliable and robust. As a result, whether or not the UNESCO recognition is a panacea for promoting tourism deserves further study.",

            "text": "A World Heritage Site is a place listed by UNESCO as culturally and/or naturally significant. In the process of economic development, many cultural and natural heritage sites were increasingly threatened by the traditional causes of decay and by industrialization. Yet the protection of these heritages often remains incomplete at the national level, especially in developing and lessdeveloped countries. In noting this formidable phenomenon of damage as well as inadequate conservation, the World Heritage Convention (hereafter, referred to as the Convention) of UNESCO launched an initiative in 1972 to preserve heritage sites considered to be of great value to humanity. The Convention enacted an international treaty called \"the Protection of the World Cultural and Natural Heritage\" and began to ratify sites on the WHL in 1978. 2 Over the past three decades, under the coordinated effort of the World Heritage Center, an increasing number of famous and important sites have been recognized by and then protected by strict regulations. As of June 2010, 911 sites, comprising 704 cultural, 180 natural, and 27 mixed properties, have been recognized in 151 enlisted countries or regions. 3 Although the purpose of inscribing the WHL is to identify and protect sites of outstanding value, the UNESCO recognition has been widely used as an advertisement to attract tourists. Indeed, being on the WHL seems to be effective for increasing global visibility and tourist arrivals. For example, Thorsell and Sigaty (1998) documented that recorded annual visits to 116 of the WHSs was roughly 63 million in 1998, accounting for nearly one-tenth of international tourist arrivals. In addition, a wave of heritage tourism was caused by the Traveler magazine October 1999 issue, showcasing 50 superlative places that every curious traveler should visit in a lifetime (Yang et al., 2010) .",

In one sense, heritage sites are thought to induce prosperous tourism that create jobs and earn foreign exchange, thus serving as a major driving force for further growth in many countries (Herbert, 2001; McIntosh & Prentice, 1999; Wager, 1995) . Specifically, once sites are inscribed on the list of WHSs, UNESCO provides financial as well as technological aid to repair and maintain those heritage sites (of particular importance for low-income countries that depend heavily on the tourism industry for economic growth). Conversely, visitation increases the threat of damage or destruction of the environmental and cultural integrity of the WHSs due to excess number of tourists. In light of this conflict, an emerging line of research has focused on discussing how to achieve a balance between strict protection of WHSs and tourism development, for example, Wager (1995) , Garrod and Fyall (2000) , Maikhuri, Nautiyal, Rao, and Saxena (2001) , and Leask and Fyall (2006) . 4",

Macau lies on the western side of the Pearl River Delta, bordering Guangdong province to the north and facing the South China Sea to the east and south. Macau was settled by Portuguese traders in the 16th century and became a Portuguese colony during 1887e1999. On 20 December 1999, the sovereignty was transferred to China and Macau became one of the two special administrative regions of China. 5 Although China is responsible for Macau's defense and foreign affairs, Macau maintains its existing systems (such as legal system, police force, monetary system, and immigration policy) established by the Portuguese. 6 The economy of Macau is highly dependent on tourism and the gambling sector. 7 conventions, and exhibitions) policy. Importantly, re-molding Macau into a cultural city is a key strategy toward promoting tourism. As described on the UNESCO website: \"With its historic street, residential, religious and public Portuguese and Chinese buildings, the historic centre of Macao provides a unique testimony to the meeting of esthetic, cultural, architectural and technological influences from East and West.\" The Macau government has aggressively conserved these features and promoted the unique culture of the international tourism market. On 15 July 2005, \"The Historic Centre of Macao\" was formally inscribed on the prestigious WHL. 8 Does the inscription of \"The Historic Centre of Macao\" on the WHL induce more tourists that are international?

Although there is a possibility of endogenous causality between visitor arrivals and hotels, this problem would be minor even if we adopt the number of hotel beds from the current period, because constructing a new hotel normally requires a few years. In addition, this variable can also capture also the tourism policy of MICE, because these activities are normally held in hotels.

This finding is consistent with Cellini (2011) and within the estimates in Yang et al. (2010) . That is, contrary to common belief, being included on the WHL is not a primary driver of international tourism. One point worth mentioning is that the coefficient of the WHL dummy can only be explained as the average treatment effect between pre-and post-WHL inclusion periods for all sample countries. In other words, the coefficient of the WHL dummy cannot provide more insightful implications such as year effects or country-specific effects.

To be specific, countries with a higher per capita GDP and greater population are associated with more outbound tourists to Macau, ceteris paribus. Conversely, distance and depreciation of a sourcing country's currency have a negative effect on the number of outbound visitors to Macau, after controlling for other variables. Table 2 Determinants of tourist arrivals in Macau. To learn more insights from this estimation, we exclude the impact of SARS (the SARS coefficient in Table 2 ) and then plot the two sets of FE estimates on the year dummies in Fig. 2 . As mentioned, the WHL inscription was announced in July 2005. Therefore, we expect to observe a spike in 2005 or immediately thereafter, if the WHL does induce more visitors. Fig. 2 clearly indicates that starting from 1999, there has been a slight decrease in tourist arrivals in Macau. This downturn may result from the macroeconomic or international economic conditions. In particular, 2004 had the most negative impact on tourism. Importantly, Fig To summarize, compared with the pre-WHL period, there has been a substantial difference in tourism growth during the post-WHL period. Given this observation, it seems to suggest that there is a strong tourism-enhancing effect caused by the WHL inscription. However, this positive impact lasts only for a short-run. In addition to the UNESCO recognition, aggressive promotions made by the Macau government and higher quality global economic conditions are also possible explanations for the increase in tourist arrivals during 2005e2007. 14 The above analyses neglect the possibility that the \"Historic Centre of Macau\" may exhibit different degrees of attractiveness to tourists from diverse regions. Specifically, the Portuguese-style buildings and the Portugal-China mix of aesthetics, culture, and architecture are perhaps more attractive to Asian tourists than those from European countries. To differentiate the potential tourism-enhancing effect of the WHL across tourists of various regions, we adopt visitors from Hong Kong and Portugal as the reference group. Next, we classify the other sample countries into five regions and introduce five interaction terms between regions and the WHL variable into Equation (3). The five regions include EURO (European countries), AMER (the US and Canada), ANZ (Australia and New Zealand), EASIA (Japan, Korea, and Taiwan), and SEASIA (Southeast Asian countries: India, the Philippines, Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, and Thailand).

In the FE estimates of Model 6, both coefficients of EASIA*WHL and SEASIA*WHL are significantly positive, suggesting that the tourismenhancing effect of the WHL works for both Southeast Asian tourists and East Asian countries.

Importantly, we find some appealing results through further examinations on the year effect and region-effect of tourism caused by the WHL. First, announcement of inscribing a site on the WHL seems to be an effective advertisement and promotion strategy stimulating more tourist arrivals in the short-run. Second, the tourism-enhancing effect of the WHL is different among countries and regions. In particular, the inscription of the \"Historic Centre of Macau\" exhibits a significant impact on fostering more Asian tourists to Macau, especially for visitors from Southeast Asia, because the Portuguesestyle architecture and culture appeal more to Asian travelers than to Western tourists. Finally, Macau is a special case with only one WHS. As a result, our empirical findings cannot apply to all sites of WHL. Indeed, whether a spot listed on WHL can attract more international visitors needs supporting infrastructures and facilities within the enlisted country. However, Macau acts as an excellent case for us to avoid problems associated with the time-invariant property of WHL variables in fixed-effects models. In this manner, our results are reliable and can lend insights on the impact of UNESCO recognition on tourism.",

Again, the global finance crisis influenced the international tourism market, inducing the decrease of tourist arrivals in Macau in 2008 and 2009.
