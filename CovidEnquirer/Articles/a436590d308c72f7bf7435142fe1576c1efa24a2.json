The membrane is composed of three layers: two hydrophobic protective layers and a sandwiched hydrophilic support layer in which LiCl solution is immobilized to facilitate water vapor transfer. A test is conducted to measure the moisture permeation rate through the composite membrane. Various resistances in the cell and in the composite membrane are clarified. Linear equilibrium relations between humidity, temperature, and LiCl concentration in the liquid solution layer are obtained to aid in the model set-up. It has been found that the mean moisture permeation rate through the composite membrane is around 1.14 \u00d7 10 \u22124 kg m \u22122 s \u22121 , almost two times higher than that through a solid hydrophilic cellulose acetate membrane with comparative thickness. Further, the supported liquid layer only accounts for 12% of the total moisture transfer resistance in the cell, indicating that there is much potential for further performance improvement.",

Among those drawn much attention is one that involves membrane technology-the so called membrane based total heat recovery (MTHR) [4] [5] [6] [7] . MTHR is an air-to-air heat exchanger where the two incoming streams (fresh air and exhaust air) exchanges heat and moisture simultaneously through membranes. The fresh air represents outdoor air (fresh air intake for a HVAC system). The exhaust air represents stale room air that would normally be exhausted to the outside. The core material of an MTHR ventilator are vapor-permeable membranes, therefore both heat and moisture are transferred between these two air streams when they flow through the unit. Thus, heat and humidity would be recovered from the exhaust stream in winter and excess heat and moisture would be transferred to the exhaust in order to cool and dehumidify the incoming air in summer. In this way, large quantities of energy in HVAC could be saved.",

Surplus LiCl solution on surfaces of CA membrane is blotted off with paper tissue. To be sure that no ionic liquid is removed from the membrane pores, the cleaning procedure is very gentle.

In the preparation process, some thickness of the CA membrane is dissolved by the glue, resulting in a lesser support layer thickness than raw material. Fig. 5 with LiCl solution shows that the CA layer and PVDF layer connect to each other very closely and have a dense and continuum interface. There are more big cavities in the support layer.

When testing, the flat sheet membrane is placed on the lower chamber inside which saturated salt solution is contained. The cap is then covered on the membrane surface and forms a sandwiched structure. The membrane and the inner surface of the cap form a cone-shaped cavity. The air is supplied through the air slits in the cap. It is introduced through two diametrically positioned inlets (symmetrically placed) into a circular-shaped channel at the perimeter, from where the air is distributed over the membrane surface through the circular air slit. The air flows inward radially, until it exits the cap outlet in the center. The cap is designed that a constant axial air velocity is realized. When flowing across the membrane, the air stream exchanges moisture with the salt solution through the composite SLM, and is humidified. This test uses NaCl solution since it can ensure outlet humidity not saturated, for the protection of RH sensors.",

One of them is humidified through a bubbler immersed in a bottle of distilled water, and then re-mixed with the other dry air stream. The humidity of the mixed air stream is controlled by adjusting the proportions of air mixing. The air flow rates are controlled by two air pumps/controllers at the inlet and outlet of the cell. The humidities and temperatures to and from the cell are measured by the built-in RH and temperature sensors, which are installed in the pumps/controllers.

It reflects the performance of membrane. Dimensionless radius Table 2 lists the values of operating conditions and system configurations. For each test, several minutes are needed for the system to become steady state. After outlet RH reaches steady state, water vapor permeability can be calculated with Eq. (33). This is the experimental data. The outlet RH can also be predicted with Eq. (30) . This is the model prediction. In calculations, the cell radius is divided into 50 grids. Fig. 11 plots the relative humidity of outlet air under different air flow rates. The model predictions are also plotted in the figure. They are in agreement. Maximum difference is 3%. Fig. 12 shows the distributions of equivalent air relative humidity on both surfaces of liquid membrane and in air stream, along cell radius. They have lower values at inlet and higher values at outlet, indicating moisture emits continuously from salt solution in lower chamber to air stream. Fig. 13 plots the distributions of equilibrium mass fraction of LiCl in liquid on both surfaces of liquid membrane, along cell radius. Before the test, liquid membrane has a uniform mass fraction of 35%. During the operation, new equilibrium between liquid membrane and surrounding air relative humidity has been set-up. As a result, LiCl concentration in the liquid membrane re-distributed and forms a non-uniform mass fraction field. Under the gradients of LiCl (or water) concentrations, moisture is transferred from the lower gap to the air stream. The liquid solution layer also acts as a barrier to air transfer since little air is dissolved in LiCl solution. Fig. 14 shows the local vapor emission rate along cell radius. As seen, the emission rate exhibits a non-uniform distribution on membrane surface. It decreases from 3 \u00d7 10 4 kg m \u22122 s \u22121 at air inlet to 2.4 \u00d7 10 \u22125 kg m \u22122 s \u22121 at air outlet. The mean moisture emission rate is 1.14 \u00d7 10 \u22124 kg m \u22122 s \u22121 , which is two times higher than the performance of CA membranes in our previous study with the same system (3.8 \u00d7 10 \u22125 kg m \u22122 s \u22121 ) [32] . The resulted mean permeability is 0.043 (kg m \u22122 s \u22121 )/(kg/kg).",

The two protective layers account for 28% of the total resistance each. The air gap diffusion resistance amounts to less than 10% of the total resistance. The supported liquid layer, LiCl solution layer, only accounts for 12% of the total resistance. In real applications in MTHR ventilators, only membrane resistance and convective resistance are considered. As a result, to further improve performances in future, the resistances in protective layers and flow channels should be lowered as a priority. One efficient measure may be to lower the thickness of protective layers-to a dozen micrometers, for instance. Using turbulent flow arrangement such as cross-corrugated parallel plates may be the good way to lower resistance in flow channels.",

Various resistances in the composite membrane and in the test cell have been clarified.
