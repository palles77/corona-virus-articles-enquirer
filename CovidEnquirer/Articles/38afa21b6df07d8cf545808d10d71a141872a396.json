Other parasites (such as nematodes) should also be considered on the differential diagnosis list. Enteropathogenic bacteria cause diarrhea by adhesion to or destruction of enterocytes, secretion of a variety of potent enterotoxins, and stimulation of the host inflammatory response. Many of these microbes can be detected in the feces of apparently healthy animals as well as the feces of those with clinical signs of diarrhea. Therefore, it may be difficult to ascertain the role that these organisms play in disease in a single patient. Clinical signs of diarrhea may be more likely to occur when multiple organisms are present simultaneously (\" polyparasitism\"). In addition, other host factors (such as nutritional status or age) and bacterial virulence factors influence whether clinical signs develop. When outbreaks occur in dog and cat populations, collection of specimens from multiple affected and in-contact animals may be useful to determine the significance of one or more organisms involved. Use of antibiotics to treat bacterial diarrhea should be reserved for animals with systemic signs of illness such as fever, lethargy, and leukocytosis on the CBC. 6 Other infections are self-limiting, and the mainstay of treatment is proper fluid therapy and supportive care.",

Some primary peritonitis in dogs or cats may result from hematogenous spread of bacteria to the peritoneum or bacterial translocation from the gastrointestinal tract. 7 Secondary peritonitis is the most common form of peritonitis in dogs and cats and occurs when bacteria are introduced into the peritoneal space as a result of gastrointestinal perforation, penetration of the abdominal wall, rupture of the genitourinary tract, rupture of intra-abdominal abscesses, gallbladder rupture, or ascending infection of the umbilicus in neonates (Table  88 -2). 7, [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] In dogs, low preoperative total protein or serum albumin concentrations are risk factors for development of bacterial peritonitis after gastrointestinal surgery. 16 The bacterial species involved in peritonitis reflect the normal flora of the gastrointestinal tract. Mixed aerobic-anaerobic infections, with up to four different bacterial species, occur in more than 50% of affected dogs and cats. 7, 10 Escherichia coli is the most common isolate from both dogs and cats, followed by Enterococcus and Clostridium spp. 7, 10, 11, 14, 15, 17, 18 Other isolates include staphylococci, streptococci, Pseudomonas aeruginosa or Acinetobacter spp., a variety of anaerobes, gram-negative Enterobacteriaceae (Proteus, Citrobacter, Serratia, Klebsiella, or Enterobacter), Actinomyces, or in cats, Pasteurella multocida. In one study, a greater proportion of dogs with primary peritonitis had gram-positive bacterial infections than dogs with secondary peritonitis. 7 Uncommonly, Candida albicans can be involved, especially if there is a history of antibiotic treatment (see Chapter 67).",

Peritoneal fluid from dogs and cats with bacterial peritonitis is typically a modified transudate or exudate, although fluid from dogs with primary peritonitis may be more likely to be a modified transudate or transudate. 7 Fluid analysis from most animals with peritonitis reveals a high protein concentration and an increased erythrocyte and total nucleated cell count (usually >500 cells/\u00b5L and up to 160,000 cells/\u00b5L). There is typically a predominance of neutrophils that may have a degenerate appearance, and foreign material and/or intracellular and extracellular bacteria may be seen. The presence of intracellular bacteria is generally considered diagnostic for bacterial peritonitis. Because an absence of bacteria does not rule out bacterial peritonitis, submission of fluid for culture is essential. 10, 14 A blood-to-fluid glucose difference greater than 20 mg/dL was 100% sensitive and 100% specific for a diagnosis of bacterial peritonitis in one study of dogs and cats. 18",

The need for subsequent drainage is controversial. Drainage is generally selected when debridement and lavage cannot adequately reduce contamination. Methods of drainage include primary closure with closed suction drains, open peritoneal drainage, and, most recently, vacuum-assisted peritoneal drainage. 10, 12, 17, [20] [21] [22] In retrospective studies, no significant differences in survival have been identified among methods, but prospective studies are required. Complications of drainage are ascending nosocomial infection, obstruction of closed suction drains by omentum, and hypoproteinemia. Evisceration and bowel desiccation have the potential to occur with open peritoneal drainage, and fluid production cannot be quantified. Dogs and cats that undergo open drainage are also more likely to require plasma or blood transfusions and may have longer hospitalization times. 17 Frequent sedation or anesthesia for bandage changes is also required.",

The focus of this section is bacterial infections of the biliary tree; hepatic abscesses are considered in a separate section that follows. Bacterial infections of the hepatobiliary system occur occasionally in cats and are rare in dogs. The main mechanism thought to be involved is ascending infections of the biliary tree, although hematogenous spread and bacterial translocation from the portal system are other proposed mechanisms. 23 They have been associated with suppurative cholangitis/cholangiohepatitis, cholecystitis, choledochitis, and cholelithiasis. [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] Cholangitis is inflammation of intrahepatic bile ducts, whereas cholangiohepatitis is inflammation of the bile ducts that has spread to the adjacent liver parenchyma. The use of the term \"cholangitis\" (rather than \"cholangiohepatitis\") has been recommended by the WSAVA Liver Diseases and Pathology Standardization Group, because of the variable existence of hepatic involvement, so this term will be used from this point onward. In cats, cholangitis has been classified histologically as neutrophilic cholangitis, lymphocytic cholangitis, or chronic cholangitis associated with liver fluke infestation. Neutrophilic cholangitis can be further subclassified as acute or chronic depending on the presence of fibrosis, fibroplasia, or bile duct proliferation. 32 Neutrophilic cholangitis is thought to develop as a result of ascending bacterial infection from the gastrointestinal tract, which may occur secondary to inflammatory bowel disease (IBD) and/or pancreatitis (Figure 88-2) . It is hypothesized that the common entry of the pancreatic and common bile ducts into the intestine in cats may predispose them to concurrent intestinal, pancreatic, and biliary disease due to pancreatic and hepatobiliary reflux in the face of IBD (\"triaditis\"). However, not all cats with cholangitis have histologic evidence of associated pancreatitis or IBD. Cats with acute neutrophilic cholangitis tend to be younger than those with chronic neutrophilic cholangitis. 32, 33 Retrovirus infection does not appear to be a predisposing factor. The cause of lymphocytic cholangitis is unclear; currently it is thought to be an immune-mediated condition. 34 Chronic cholangitis associated with liver fluke infestation is rare and is primarily reported from regions with subtropical climates such as the southeastern United States and Hawaii, but disease can occur in non-endemic areas in traveled cats. Several different fluke species may be involved, but the most prevalent appears to be Platynosomum concinnum. 35 Choledochitis is inflammation of the common bile duct. Cholecystitis is inflammation of the gallbladder and may or may not be associated with cholangitis or choledochitis. In some instances, necrotizing and/or emphysematous cholecystitis can develop, which may lead to perforation of the gallbladder wall and septic bile peritonitis. Cholelithiasis is stone formation within the biliary tree. In some instances, cholelithiasis or neoplasia of the biliary tree may predispose to cholangitis and necrotizing cholecystitis. 28, 29 Alternatively, it has been suggested that bacterial cholecystitis predisposes to stone formation through bacterial deconjugation of soluble bilirubin glucuronide to insoluble unconjugated bilirubin and glucuronic acid. 27 Smaller breed (dachshunds, poodles, miniature schnauzers) female dogs were predisposed to cholelithiasis in one study. 27 Biliary cultures are more likely to be positive than hepatic cultures in both dogs and cats with hepatobiliary disease. In one large study, approximately 30% of biliary cultures were positive in dogs and cats, whereas hepatic cultures were positive in 14% of cats and 5% of dogs. 31 In cats, more than 80% of biliary cultures yielded a single bacterial species, whereas multiple bacterial species were isolated from approximately 50% of dogs. Bacterial species isolated from cats include obligate anaerobes, a variety of Enterobacteriaceae, Enterococcus, Streptococcus, or Staphylococcus species. 24, 31, 32 Dogs are most commonly infected with mixtures of E. coli, Enterococcus spp., and anaerobes, primarily Bacteroides and Clostridium species. 25 Staphylococcus spp., other gram-negative aerobes (Klebsiella, Enterobacter, Citrobacter, and Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and Streptococcus spp. may also be isolated from dogs. Salmonella in cats and Campylobacter in dogs have also been associated with cholecystitis. Although rare, emphysematous cholecystitis in dogs and cats is usually associated with Clostridium spp. and/ or E. coli infection. 36 ",

Cholecystectomy could also be considered to prevent recurrence of cholelithiasis in animals with chronic cholecystitis. Cholecystectomy, biliary stenting procedures, and/ or biliary diversion surgery may be required for animals with obstructive processes such as cholelithiasis, biliary neoplasia, or obstructive cholangitis. 27, 28 Because cholecystotomy or biliary diversion surgery often results in dehiscence and septic bile peritonitis if bacterial cholecystitis or choledochitis is present, cholecystectomy has been recommended for dogs with cholelithiasis as opposed to cholecystotomy. 27 When compared with other surgical biliary procedures, cholecystectomy has been associated with good clinical outcomes in dogs and cats, but any condition that requires biliary surgery carries a guarded prognosis.",

Experimentally, necrotizing pancreatitis can be complicated by secondary bacterial invasion due to ascending infection from the duodenum or bacterial translocation, 49, 50 although the extent to which this occurs in dogs and cats with naturally-occurring pancreatitis remains unclear. Occasionally, pancreatitis results from hematogenous spread of bacteria to the pancreas, usually in addition to other organs (see Table 86 -2). Other microorganisms known to cause pancreatitis as a result of systemic infection include Leptospira species, Toxoplasma gondii, and fungi such as Cryptococcus neoformans. In cats, pancreatitis can also result from invasion by flukes (Eurytrema procyonis). 51 When a primary infectious cause of pancreatitis cannot clearly be identified, the use of antimicrobial drugs to treat pancreatitis in dogs and cats is controversial. If used, the primary goal of antimicrobial treatment is to prevent or treat secondary ascending bacterial infection or bacterial translocation; treatment should target enteric bacteria. However, no evidence currently exists that use of antimicrobials alters outcome in dogs and cats with naturally occurring pancreatitis, and it has the potential to select for infection by multidrug-resistant enteric pathogens. In addition, many widely used antimicrobial drugs in veterinary medicine (such as \u03b2-lactams and aminoglycosides) penetrate inflamed pancreatic tissue poorly. Suitable choices include fluoroquinolones (for gram-negative aerobes), third-generation cephalosporines, and metronidazole (for anaerobes).",

However, because George became inappetent and lethargic, he was returned for reevaluation the following day. Other medical history: George had been diagnosed with pancreatitis 8 months previously. He was also diagnosed with a biliary cystadenoma at that time. He had been hospitalized for 9 days and treated with jejunostomy tube feeding. Since then, he had been well until this recent onset of illness. ",

            "text": "Abdominal Ultrasound: The margins of the kidneys were irregular, and there was decreased corticomedullary distinction. In the region of the left limb of the pancreas, the mesentery was markedly hyperechoic and hyperattenuating. There was diffuse thickening of the muscularis of the small bowel. There was no evidence of mesenteric lymphadenomegaly. There was a small amount of free anechoic peritoneal fluid. Treatment: Medical treatment with ampicillin-sulbactam (20 mg/kg [ampicillin component] IV q8h) and enrofloxacin (5 mg/kg slow IV q24h) was commenced on day 3 of hospitalization, before the results of culture and susceptibility were available. Treatment was also continued with intravenous fluids, buprenorphine, famotidine, ondansetron, and nutrition through the esophageal feeding tube with a slurry of a commercially available gastroenteric diet (Purina EN Feline Formula, q4h). Surgery was considered, but because George was stable and the amount of free peritoneal fluid was scant, a decision was made to continue medical treatment with close observation and serial CBC and abdominal ultrasound examinations. Within 12 hours of antibiotic treatment, George was brighter. A repeat abdominal ultrasound showed no changes except that mildly enlarged and hypoechoic mesenteric lymph nodes were identified. The CBC showed persistent nonregenerative anemia (HCT of 26.4%), 10,181 neutrophils/\u00b5L, 5553 bands/ \u00b5L, 185 metamyelocytes/\u00b5L, and a normal platelet count (305,000/\u00b5L) with mod erately toxic neutrophils. On day 5 of hospitalization, ultrasonography showed a decrease in the amount of peritoneal fluid. The enrofloxacin was discontinued when the results of culture and susceptibility became available. On day 6, the CBC showed a stable HCT, 9366 neutrophils/\u00b5L, 2810 bands/\u00b5L, moderately toxic neutrophils, and no metamyelocytes. A serum chemistry panel was unremarkable, and the total bilirubin was 0.1 mg/dL. On day 8, George began eating a small amount of food on his own, and the CBC showed further improvement with 6048 neutrophils/\u00b5L, 336 bands/\u00b5L, mild monocytosis (896 cells/\u00b5L), and no toxic neutrophils. He was discharged from the hospital the following day with instructions to continue tube feeding, ondansetron (0.3 mg/kg PO q24h), famotidine (0.5 mg/kg PO q12h), and amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (15 mg/kg PO q12h). At a recheck 1 week later, the owner reported that George had been doing well at home, although he had vomited three times over the course of the week. Physical examination was unremarkable, apart from the thyroid nodule and mild weight loss (body weight, 5.6 kg compared with 5.9 kg at discharge). A CBC showed a HCT of 30%, 10,592 neutrophils/\u00b5L, and 132 bands/ \u00b5L. A serum chemistry panel was within normal limits, and the total T4 concentration was 8.2 \u00b5g/dL. Treatment with methimazole (1.25 mg q12h) was initiated for the hyperthyroidism, but because of continued vomiting, this was discontinued after three doses. George continued to improve. A week later he was eating canned and dry food on his own with no vomiting, a CBC showed no abnormalities, and the antibiotics were discontinued. The esophageal tube was removed 3 weeks later, and methimazole was reinstituted, after which his T4 normalized. Six months later George was still doing well.",

            "text": "Comments: In this cat, bacterial peritonitis and suspected cholecystitis were diagnosed based on cytologic and microbiologic analysis of bile and peritoneal fluid. However, there were no ultrasonographic abnormalities within the biliary tract, and cytologic evidence of inflammation in the bile was absent. Pancreatitis may have predisposed the cat to ascending infection of the biliary tract, and/or infection may have resulted from bacterial translocation. The lack of an inflammatory reaction in the bile was unusual, but it may have resulted from marked neutrophil degeneration in a toxic environment. Isolation of the same organism from both the bile and the peritoneal fluid and the rapid clinical response to antibiotic treatment suggested that Enterococcus played a role in disease in this cat, although some of the clinical signs and hematologic abnormalities may also have resulted from severe pancreatitis and hepatic lipidosis. Surgery was postponed with careful monitoring because the peritonitis appeared to be very low grade and there was concern it might exacerbate pancreatitis. Fortunately, the cat made a complete recovery. See Chapter 8 for precautions regarding administration of enrofloxacin to cats.",

            "text": "The cardiac silhouette appeared mildly enlarged. There was a mild bronchointerstitial pattern throughout the thorax. There was poor serosal detail within the viewable cranial abdomen.Outcome: George was treated supportively for pancreatitis with intravenous fluids (lactated Ringer's solution with 20 mEq/L KCl at 15 mL/hr), buprenorphine (0.01 mg/kg IV q6h), famotidine (0.5 mg/kg IV q12h), and ondansetron (0.5 mg/kg IV q12h). His temperature normalized, but he showed no interest in food or his surroundings. Cytologic examination of an ultrasound-guided liver aspirate on day 2 of hospitalization showed moderate hepatic lipidosis and mild mixed inflammation. Laboratory testing was reevaluated and an echocardiogram was performed on the third day of hospitalization in preparation for anesthesia and placement of an esophageal feeding tube. The echocardiogram was unremarkable; the gallop rhythm was suspected to result from a systolic click. New findings on the CBC were mild, nonregenerative anemia (HCT 29.9%, RR 30%-50%), with a WBC of 11,580 cells/\u00b5L ALT of 57 U/L (27-101 U/L), AST of 46 U/L (17-58 U/L), ALP of 26 U/L (14-71 U/L), GGT of <3 U/L (0-4 U/L), cholesterol of 109 mg/dL (89-258 mg/dL), and total bilirubin of 0.4 mg/dL (0-0.2 mg/dL). Urinalysis showed a specific gravity of 1.015; pH 7.0, protein 25 mg/ dL, no bilirubin, 25 erythrocytes/\u00b5L hemoprotein, 1-3 WBC/ HPF, 1-6 RBC/HPF, and many lipid droplets. Serum vitamin B 12 and folate concentrations were 383 ng/L (279-1254 ng/L) and 7.5 ng/mL (10.4-20.7 ng/mL), respectively. Because of the severely left-shifted neutrophil count and mild hyperbilirubinemia, bacterial cholecystitis was suspected. Findings on abdominal ultrasonography were unchanged from the previous examination. Ultrasound-guided cholecystocentesis was performed while George was under anesthesia for esophagostomy tube placement, and a small volume of the scant peritoneal fluid present was also collected.Cytologic Examination (Bile): Smears had light bluebackgrounds and contained a moderate amount of unidentified material. Nucleated cells were not found, but many short, plump coccobacilli were seen. Most of the bacteria were in large clusters, but a few groups were in chains.Peritoneal Fluid Analysis: Grossly the fluid was pink and cloudy, and it had a yellow, clear supernatant. The total protein concentration was 2.8 g/dL and there were 100,000 RBC/\u00b5L. There were 5380 nucleated cells/\u00b5L, with 70% nondegenerate neutrophils, 6% small and welldifferentiated lymphocytes, 7% foamy macrophages, and 17% eosinophils. No infectious agents were identified. Aerobic and Anaerobic Bacterial Culture (Bile): Large numbers of Enterococcus faecium. No anaerobes were cultured. The isolate was susceptible to amoxicillin-clavulanic acid (\u22644 \u00b5g/mL), ampicillin (\u22640.25 \u00b5g/mL), penicillin (0.12 \u00b5g/mL), chloramphenicol (\u22644 \u00b5g/mL), doxycycline (\u22642 \u00b5g/mL), imipenem (\u22641 \u00b5g/mL); had intermediate susceptibility to erythromycin (1 \u00b5g/mL); and was resistant to rifampin (>2 \u00b5g/mL). and Anaerobic Bacterial Culture (Peritoneal Fluid): Very small numbers of Enterococcus faecium. The antibiogram was identical to the isolate from the bile. Diagnosis: Peritonitis and suspected bacterial cholecystitis caused by E. faecium; pancreatitis and secondary hepatic lipidosis.",
