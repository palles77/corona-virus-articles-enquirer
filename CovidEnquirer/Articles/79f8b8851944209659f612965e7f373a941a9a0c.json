            "text": "An increasing number of insect-specific viruses are found around the world. Very recently, a new group of insectspecific viruses, the Mesoniviridae family, was discovered in Africa, Asia, North America and Australia. Here we report the first detection and isolation of a new virus belonging to Mesonivirus genus in Senegal, West Africa. The so-called Dianke virus was detected in 21 species of arthropods trapped in the eastern part of the country. Male individuals were also infected, supporting vertical transmission assertion of insect specific viruses. As described for other mesoniviruses, no viral replication was observed after inoculation of mammalian cells. Viral replication in mosquito cells was blocked at a temperature of 37\u00b0C, highlighting the importance of thermal conditions in Mesonivirus host restriction. Similar to our study, where a diverse range of arthropod vectors were found infected by the new virus, several studies have detected mesonivirus infection in mosquitoes with concerns for human health. It has been shown that dual infections in mosquito can alter viral infectivity. Due to their extensive geographic distribution and host range, as well as their use as potential disease control agents in vector populations, more studies should be done for a better knowledge of arthropod-restricted viruses prevalence and diversity.",

Mesoniviruses are enveloped, positive-sense, single stranded RNA ([+]ssRNA) viruses and constitute the only insect-associated genus of nidoviruses. The 20 kb nidovirus genome organization is generally ORF1a-ORF1b-ORF2a-ORF2b-ORF3a-ORF3b, except the Alphamesonivirus1 species, which encodes a seventh open reading frame (ORF4) (Vasilakis et al., 2014) . ORF1a and ORF1b are predicted to encode two polymerase polyproteins (pp) while the other ORFs encode structural proteins (Zirkel et al., 2011; Hang et al., 2016) . Viral particles are enveloped, spherical in shape and 60-80 nm in diameter with club-shaped surface spikes . Like insect-specific flaviviruses (Hoshino et al., 2007; Huhtamo et al., 2009 ) and other mosquito-associated bunyaviruses (Marklewitz et al., 2013) and orbiviruses (Harrison et al., 2016) , mesoniviruses are considered insect specific viruses (ISVs) as the totality of detection has come from mosquito pools and isolations only from insect cells lines, while no detection or replication has been reported in mammalian models (Nga et al., 2011; Zirkel et al., 2011;  https://doi.org/10. 1016/j.virusres.2019.197802 Received 2 June 2019; Received in revised form 30 October 2019; Accepted 30 October 2019 Vasilakis et al., 2014) .",

Briefly, trapping was done in different human dwellings of villages of eastern Senegal. In each village, at least 10 houses were selected following a transect going from the peripheral borders to the center in order to cover all the ecological profiles. The different trapping sessions were performed during twilight, where most of arboviruses vectors such as Aedes species are active. Three methods were used: (1) human landing catches, the most appropriate method for determining the risk of human infection (Diallo et al., 2014) , (2) CDC light traps with or without CO 2 bait, shown to have relatively high sampling efficiency (Okumu et al., 2008) but to be less specific to particular anthropophilic species, (3) indoor residual spraying for endophilic species collection. Adhesive trap catches were also performed for sandflies. After morphological identification, collected insects were pooled by species in tubes and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until viral detection processing. Each pool was triturated in L-15 medium and RNA was extracted as described below.",

Sequences were assembled into contigs with the SeqMan and NextGen suites of the DNAStar Lasergene 7 program (Bioinformatics Pioneer DNAStar, Inc., Madison, WI) and their relationships to other viruses were determined by a BLAST search. The open reading frames were identified using \"SnapGene software (from GSL Biotech; available at snapgene.com)\".

This observation was confirmed by a parallel analysis using a neighbor-Joining approach for which one no discrepancy was noted, as shown in figure  S1 in supplemental material. The classical mesonivirus genome organization was found, with the typical ORFs and the putative ribosomal frame-shift (RFS) element in ORF1a and ORF1b, the 3C-like serine protease (3CLP), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp), zincbinding (Z), helicase (Hel), exoribonuclease (ExoN), N7-methyltransferase (NMT) and 2\u2032-O-methyltransferase (OMT) domains. Block insertions observed after the first 1300 nt of the ORF1a of some Asian strains (Vasilakis et al., 2014) were absent in the Senegal sequence. Protein sequence identity of ORF 1, ORF 2 and ORF 3 were 91 %, 94 % and 91 %, respectively (Table 4 ). Pairwise evolutionary distance (PED) is the reference species demarcation criterion in the Mesonivirus genus (Lauber et al., 2012) . Using the conserved protein domains of ORF1ab (3CL pro , RdRp and Hel) (Vasilakis et al., 2014) , we calculated PED between the virus and some previously described mesoniviruses selected from the blast output using a protein alignment. We considered the same consensus threshold of 0.037 as minimum distance for the demarcation of nidovirus species based on the concatenated protein domains (Lauber et al., 2012) . In accordance with a previous study (Warrilow et al., 2014) , a PED value of 0.031 was obtained between CavV and NDiV isolates (Table 5) , which constitutes the species Alphamesonivirus 1 as previously described (Lauber et al., 2012) . The Senegal isolate was closest to Alphamesonivirus 1 with distances of 0.042, 0.044 and 0.053 separating it from Houston virus (HOUV), Nam Dinh virus (NDiV) and Cavally virus (CavV), respectively. The highest distance was observed with Nse (NseV), Casuarina (CASV) and Hana viruses (HAV) with PED values of 0.243, 0.123 and 0.117, respectively (Table 5) . These results are reflected by the tree obtained with the different sequences involved in the maximum likelihood analysis (Fig. 2) , as well as a neighbor-joining approach (figure S2 in supplemental material). Our isolates represent a new species in the Mesonivirus genus. We proposed Dianke virus (DKV) (Accession number: MN622133) as a name for this virus, referring to one of the sampling localities.",

            "text": "Like our study where a large diversity of vectors was infected by the new strain, several studies have detected mesonivirus infection of mosquitoes with potentially significant health impacts (Zirkel et al., 2011; Nga et al., 2011; Vasilakis et al., 2014) . Indeed, it has been shown that dual viral infections in mosquito can alter viral infectivity (Fujita et al., 2018) and ISVs are more and more considered as potential disease control agents in vector populations (Guzman et al., 2018; \u00d6hlund et al., 2019) . Virus phenotypic restriction could be more complex as Parry and Asgari (2018) highlighted that restriction of Dengue virus replication in Ae.aegypti mosquitoes could be hindered by interactions between a novel ISV and the endosymbiotic bacterium Wolbachia pipientis. In contrast, Zhang et al. (2017) pointed out that Cell fusing agent virus, another ISV, favor Dengue virus replication in Ae.aegypti cell lines. All together, the current studies highlight gaps in the understanding of interactions between ISVs and other pathogenic viruses. It has been shown that the host range restriction of insect-specific flaviviruses and alphaviruses occurs at different levels of viral replication cycle (Nasar et al., 2015; Junglen et al., 2017) . Among intrinsic and extrinsic factors affecting viral replication and transmissibility, temperature was shown to be of an extreme importance (Samuel et al., 2016) . The experiments undertaken in this study tends to confirm this assessment as DKV was unable to replicate in permissive mosquito C6/ 36 cells at 37\u00b0C. However, the virus did not grow in different mammal cells at the mosquito temperature of 28\u00b0C. The host restriction phenomenon for mesoniviruses and the other ISVs remain to be further studied.",
