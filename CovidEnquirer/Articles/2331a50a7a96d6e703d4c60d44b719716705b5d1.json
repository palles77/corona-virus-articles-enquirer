As appropriate, the focus on individual etiologic agents highlights some characteristic features of each that are particularly useful to the physician. Also covered is a commonly used categorization of pneumonia based on the clinical setting: community-acquired versus nosocomial (hospital-acquired) pneumonia. In current clinical practice, the approach to evaluation and management of these two types of pneumonia is often quite different.",

Viruses in particular are likely to avoid or overwhelm some of the upper respiratory tract defenses, causing a transient, relatively mild clinical illness with symptoms limited to the upper respiratory tract. When host defense mechanisms of the upper and lower respiratory tracts are overwhelmed, microorganisms may establish residence, proliferate, and cause a frank infectious process within the pulmonary parenchyma. With particularly virulent organisms, no major impairment of host defense mechanisms is needed; pneumonia may occur even in normal and otherwise healthy individuals. At the other extreme, if host defense mechanisms are quite impaired, microorganisms that are not particularly virulent and unlikely to cause disease in a healthy host may produce a life-threatening pneumonia.",

More severe impairment of host defenses is caused by diseases associated with immunosuppression (e.g., advanced AIDS), various underlying malignancies (particularly leukemia and lymphoma), and use of corticosteroids and other immunosuppressive or cytotoxic drugs. In these cases associated with impairment of host defenses, individuals are susceptible to both bacterial and more unusual nonbacterial infections (see Chapters 24 to 26).",

The first is by inhalation, whereby organisms are usually carried in small droplet particles inhaled into the tracheobronchial tree. The second is by aspiration, whereby secretions from the oropharynx pass through the larynx and into the tracheobronchial tree. Aspiration is usually thought of as a process occurring in individuals unable to protect their airways from secretions by glottic closure and coughing. Although clinically significant aspiration is more likely to occur in such individuals, everyone is subject to aspirating small amounts of oropharyngeal secretions, particularly during sleep. Defense mechanisms seem able to cope with this nightly onslaught of bacteria, and frequent bouts of aspiration pneumonia are not experienced. Less commonly, bacteria reach the pulmonary parenchyma through the bloodstream rather than by the airways. This route is important for the spread of certain organisms, particularly Staphylococcus. When pneumonia results in this way from bacteremia, the implication is that a distant primary source of bacterial infection is present or that bacteria were introduced directly into the bloodstream (e.g., with intravenous drug abuse).",

A multitude of organisms (both gram-positive and gram-negative) that favor or require anaerobic conditions for growth are the major organisms comprising mouth flora. The most common predisposing factor for anaerobic pneumonia is aspiration of secretions from the oropharynx into the tracheobronchial tree. Patients with impaired consciousness (e.g., as a result of coma, alcohol or drug ingestion, or seizures) and those with difficulty swallowing (e.g., as a result of stroke or diseases causing muscle weakness) are prone to aspirate and are at risk for pneumonia caused by anaerobic or mixed mouth organisms. In addition, patients with poor dentition or gum disease are more likely to develop aspiration pneumonia because of the larger burden of organisms in their oral cavity. In some settings such as prolonged hospitalization or recent use of antibiotics, the type of bacteria residing in the oropharynx may change. Specifically, aerobic gramnegative bacilli and S. aureus are more likely to colonize the oropharynx, and any subsequent pneumonia resulting from aspiration of oropharyngeal contents may include these aerobic organisms as part of the process.",

Lobar pneumonia has classically been described as a process not limited to segmental boundaries but rather tending to spread throughout an entire lobe of the lung. Spread of the infection is believed to occur from alveolus to alveolus and from acinus to acinus through interalveolar pores known as the pores of Kohn. The classic example of a lobar pneumonia is that due to S. pneumoniae, although many cases of pneumonia documented as being due to pneumococcus do not necessarily follow this typical pattern. Bronchopneumonia. In bronchopneumonia, distal airway inflammation is prominent along with alveolar disease, and spread of the infection and the inflammatory process tends to occur through airways rather than through adjacent alveoli and acini. Whereas lobar pneumonias appear as dense consolidations involving part or all of a lobe, bronchopneumonias are more patchy in distribution, depending on where spread by airways has occurred. Many bacteria, such as staphylococci and a variety of gram-negative bacilli, may produce this patchy pattern. Interstitial Pneumonia. In some cases of pneumonia, the organisms are not highly destructive to lung tissue even though an exuberant inflammatory process may be seen. Pneumococcal pneumonia classically (although not always) behaves in this way, and the healing process is associated with restoration of relatively normal parenchymal architecture. In other cases, when the organisms are more destructive, tissue necrosis may occur, with resulting cavity formation or scarring of the parenchyma. Many cases of staphylococcal and anaerobic pneumonias follow this more destructive course.",

However, the importance of obtaining a sputum specimen and using it as a guide to treatment, as opposed to treating the patient empirically without a sputum specimen, is an issue of substantial controversy. Most authorities now recommend basing initial treatment on clinical presentation, in many cases without substantial efforts at identifying a causative organism. In cases in which a sputum specimen is obtained, it is important to evaluate the quality of the specimen because a poor-quality specimen may provide inadequate or inaccurate information. In a good sputum specimen (i.e., one that contains few squamous epithelial cells picked up in transit through the oropharynx), inflammatory cells and bacteria can be seen. In most bacterial pneumonias, large numbers of PMNs are seen in the sputum. In contrast, mycoplasmal and viral pneumonias have fewer PMNs and more mononuclear inflammatory cells. Pneumococcal, staphylococcal, and gram-negative bacillary pneumonias commonly demonstrate a relatively homogeneous population of the infecting bacteria. Anaerobic aspiration pneumonias, caused by a mixture of organisms from the oropharynx, show a mixed population of bacteria of many different morphologies. In Legionnaires' disease, the bacterium does not stain well with the usual Gram stain reagent and therefore is not seen with conventional staining techniques. In mycoplasmal and viral pneumonia, the infecting agent is not visualized by light microscopy, and only the predominantly mononuclear cell inflammatory response is seen.",

The likelihood of particular agents is believed to be influenced by a number of modifying factors: presence of coexisting illness, recent treatment with antibiotics, residence in a nursing home, and severity of illness at initial presentation. One issue that has sparked controversy is whether an attempt should be made to identify a specific etiologic agent, using Gram stain and culture, in patients with community-acquired pneumonia, or whether empirical therapy should be used based on the patient's risk factors and clinical characteristics. If a specific pathogen is identified, modification of the initial antibiotic regimen is often appropriate, particularly to avoid an overly broad spectrum of coverage. Table 23 -1 summarizes the etiology and initial management of four broad subcategories of patients with community-acquired pneumonia. The first group comprises patients who do not have coexisting cardiopulmonary disease or other modifying risk factors, who have not used antibiotics in the previous 3 months, and who do not require hospitalization. The most common pathogens in this group of patients include S. pneumoniae, M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, respiratory viruses, and in smokers, H. influenzae.

Local resistance patterns of S. pneumoniae should be taken into account, and residence in a nursing home should be considered a factor that increases the risk of pneumonia caused by a gram-negative organism. Poor dentition (leading to an increased burden of anaerobic organisms in the mouth), problems with swallowing, or impaired consciousness increase the risk of an anaerobic aspiration pneumonia. Recommended options for management of this group have included either an oral quinolone (used as a single agent) or a \u03b2-lactam antibiotic (e.g., second-or third-generation cephalosporin) given in combination with a macrolide (particularly an advanced-generation macrolide such as azithromycin or clarithromycin). The third and fourth groups differ from the first two on the basis of severity of the pneumonia. The third group is defined by a need for hospitalization. The fourth group includes patients with the most severe disease, that which necessitates admission to an intensive care unit (ICU). These patients still commonly have pneumonia caused by S. pneumoniae or the other organisms found in outpatients, but with additional concern for gram-negative bacilli, Legionella, and sometimes S. aureus. Therapy for these patients is adjusted accordingly (see Table 23 -1).
