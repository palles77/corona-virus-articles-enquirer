The recent isolation of these organisms from children has led to increased appreciation of their role in pediatric infections. In general, the types of anaerobic infections and the infecting flora are similar to those seen in adults. H o w e v e r , the incidence of these infections varies because of the difference in predisposing conditions. While adults suffer more from ischemic and obstructive diseases, children tend to have more infections of the upper respiratory tract. Sites of anaerobic infections in children are the central nervous system (CNS), oral cavity, head and neck, chest, abdomen, skin, and soft tissue (1) . Anaerobic infections tend to result in the formation of abscess, as evidenced by infections such as brain, tonsillar, lung, intraabdominal, and cutaneous abscesses.",

Anaerobic bacteria were isolated from 92% of 52 children with aspiration pneumonia (81) and 12% of children with necrotizing pneumonia and in all 10 children with lung abscesses (82) . The preponderant anaerobes isolated were anaerobic gram-positive cocci, Bacteroides spp. (including B. fragilis and B. melaninogenicus groups), Fusobacterium spp., and Veillonella spp. Anaerobes and aerobes (2.7 and 2.2 per specimen, respectively) were almost always isolated together, emphasizing the polymicrobic nature of these infections. Bacteroides fragilis resistant to penicillin was isolated in 15% of the patients, a recovery rate similar to that found in adults. Anaerobes also were recovered from four of six children with cystic fibrosis, when cultures were obtained by transtracheal aspiration (83) . These organisms included B. melaninogenicus and B. fragilis, and were mixed with aerobic and facultative bacteria. Anaerobes are involved in the colonization of the tracheobronchial tree and the subsequent tracheitis and pneumonia that follow tracheal intubation after tracheostomy (84) . Serial tracheal cultures from 27 intubated patients yielded an average of 2.2 aerobes and 1.2 anaerobes per specimen. The organisms recovered were similar to those found in patients with aspiration pneumonia.",

After therapy, 30 such organisms were recovered in 19 (30%) of the children. In contrast, before therapy, 40 B L P O were recovered from 25 (69%) of the children who failed, and after therapy, 62 such organisms were found in 31 (86%) of the children in that group. Brook and G o b e r (61) have demonstrated the rapid emergence of B L P O after one course of penicillin. The organisms were members of the Bacteroides melaninogenicus group, S. aureus, B. catarrhalis, and H. influenzae.",

In the u p p e r respiratory passage and lungs, the major anaerobic pathogens are Peptostreptococcus species, the B. melaninogenicus group, and Fusobacterium species. In intraabdominal infections and infections of the female genital tract, the most frequent isolates are of the B. fragilis group, Clostridium species, and anaerobic gram-positive cocci. Recognition of the pattern of infectivity of the various anaerobic organisms at different b o d y sites, the pathogenic features of the organisms, and the increased n u m b e r of \u00df-lactamase-producing Bacteroides species allow the earlier identification of these organisms and the initia-",
