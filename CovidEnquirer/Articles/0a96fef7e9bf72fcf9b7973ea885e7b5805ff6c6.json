To improve compliance of HCWs with SP, our results indicate the need for increasing awareness and improving training on SP among HCWs in China. Furthermore, we suggest to also include other psychosocial factors, such as attitude, belief, and social norm, from the Theory of Planned Behavior, 5 which has previously shown effectively to explain and enhance compliance of HCWs. 6 Finally, a favorable physical environment is essential. For example, sufficient supply of PPE is a prerequisite for compliance of HCWs with SP. 7 Our findings need to be interpreted with some caution. This retrospective study relies on self-reported information, possibly leading to under-reporting of actual exposure (because of recall bias) and to overestimate the extent to which they comply with SP in practice (because of social desirability bias). Also, the respondents came from tertiary hospitals where health care quality and safety are considered to be higher than in general hospitals in China. 8 Nevertheless, the high level of risk and insufficient precautions taken in the tertiary hospitals, as well as the likelihood of under-reporting of exposure and over-reporting of compliance, reflect an urgent need for interventions to improve the occupational safety of HCWs nationally.
