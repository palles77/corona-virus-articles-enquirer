A group of 9 newborn, colostrum-deprived calves was used; two calves were inoculated with attenuated virus, four calves were infected with virulent virus (including one naturally infected calf), and three calves were uninfected controls. Calves inoculated with virulent virus produced higher titers of BCV antibodies in the intestines than those inoculated with the attenuated virus. The failure of the calves to respond to the attenuated virus was apparently due to the inability of the virus to replicate to high titers. Spiral colon, ileum, and jejunum were found to be immunologically distinct; the highest anti-BCV antibody responses were detected in spiral colon, the primary site of infection, and involved all four isotypes of bovine immunoglobulins. The antibody response in ileum was lower than in spiral colon. The immune responses developed slowly in jejunum and were associated primarily with the lgG subtypes.",

Calves 1 and 9, following inoculation with attenuated virus, had peak titers of only 1:20-1:40. In calf 1, antibody activity could be detected only in the spiral colon (Fig. 1) whereas calf 9 had detectable antibody activity in all three regions of the gut. The IFA titers were much higher in calves inoculated with the virulent virus; peak titers in calves 2 and 6 being 5120 and 20,480, respectively. However, calf 7 , which was also inoculated with the virulent virus, had no detectable antibody activity (< 1:10) by IFA in any region of the intestine. Uninfected calves were always negative at 1:10 by IFA. Calf 3 that developed a natural BCV infection also did not produce high IFA titers. ",

All regions of the gut have isolated lymphocytes in the lamina propria and between the enterocytes (intraepithelial lymphocytes) whereas ileum is endowed with distinct lymphoid nodules called Peyer's patches [11] . The gastrointestinal tract is very responsive to foreign antigens (including viruses) probably because of a large population of macrophages in the intestine which present these antigens to lymphocytes. The levels of bovine immunoglobulins (IgM, IgA, IgG1 and IgG2) in different regions of gut were estimated by single radial immunodiffusion. The most predominant immunoglobulin was IgM followed by IgG1 and IgA. The level of IgG2 was very low in intestinal contents of all calves. The lower levels of immunoglobulins in the intestine 3 weeks after infection with virulent BCV (Table 1 ) may have been due to generalized immune suppression by BCV.",

The level of intestinal immune response has been found to be directly proportional to the rate of virus multiplication and the amount of viral antigen in BCV-infected calves [8] . The presence of higher IFA titers in spiral colon than in jejunum and ileum is not surprising as spiral colon is known to be the primary site of BCV multiplication.",

Since this calf had low levels of anti-BCV IFA antibody (titer 1 : 5) at 2 days of age, we speculate that this calf either acquired infection from dam at parturition or it acquired maternal antibodies due to a leak in the placental barrier. Under normal husbandry conditions, the development of active anti-BCV immunity in feces is influenced by passively derived colostral antibodies [9] . Also, the mucosal immune responses may be directed against the whole virus or the subunits of BCV [9] . Our data suggest that newborn calves are capable of mounting an intestinal immune response and that vaccine failures probably are the result of overattenuation of the virus. Also, different regions of the gut are immunologically distinct. The levels and profiles of anti-coronavirus antibody responses and their association with immunoglobulin isotypes were different at different intervals after infection. The cyclic behavior of BCV in later stages of infection [7] in the 3 regions of the gut may be related to the intestinal immune responses; the virus may be present in a particular region of the intestine when immunity is low in that part of the gut, The development of the intestinal immune response and the immunoglobulin class switchover was more rapid than the systemic responses in calves inoculated with the virulent virus. Similar results have been reported by Kimman and Van Zaane [13] in respiratory tract of calves inoculated with bovine respiratory syncytial virus. It should be recognized, however, that it was a preliminary study employing a relatively small number of animals. More extensive studies using a large number of animals are needed to confirm and extend the results of this study.",
