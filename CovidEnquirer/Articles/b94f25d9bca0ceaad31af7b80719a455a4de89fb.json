One of the most interesting observations is that a negligible number of buffaloes under study had systemic infections in terms of febrile reactions or any type of contagious diseases, especially foot-and-mouth disease in winter. Attempts were made for direct selection of cattle against brucellosis. An increase in natural resistance to brucellosis in calves, from 20% to 59% after breeding cows to a naturally resistant bull, has been reported. The natural resistance-associated macrophage protein 1 (NRAMP1) gene has been linked with resistance to brucellosis, tuberculosis, and salmonellosis. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) genes are linked to specific immunological responses. A region on chromosome 1 was associated with infectious keratoconjunctivitis (pinkeye) in cattle, which is heritable. Bos indicus breeds were observed to have better resistance to tick infestation and tick-borne diseases, as revealed through higher hemolytic complement activity.",

Molecular genetics for these immune-response genes may be exploited for combating the incidence of mastitis and are classified in four broad ways. The strategies include identification of the genes involved in mastitis defense and then using these candidate genes as markers for mastitis resistance in the form of marker-assisted selection (MAS). Other approaches include use of the recombinant products of these genes as therapeutics during the lactational stage, when it is least expressed. Transgenic animals produced with the gene insert will produce this antibacterial peptide in substantial amounts to prevent mastitis. Transgenic technology is of great use when the gene is normally not expressed in species suffering from the disease. For example, Lysostaphin, a prokaryotic gene of Staphylococcus simulans, codes for lysostaphin, which is quite effective against Staphylococcus mastitis. A recent approach that is very useful against mastitis is somatic gene therapy, where the insert is inoculated in, and the protein is expressed locally within, the mammary gland.",

Studies with quantitative RT-PCR revealed mastitis-associated expression in udder samples of animals with or without clinical mastitis. Physical mapping was done using a bovineehamster somatic cell hybrid panel and a 5000 rad bovine whole-genome radiation panel.

Polymorphism study of the genes significantly associated with indicator traits pertaining to mastitis, such as somatic cell score (SCS), white side test, California mastitis test, etc., has found them useful against mastitis. Molecular markers are preferred over other biochemical, cytogenetic markers because they can be explored at the DNA level and can be studied irrespective of sex and age as well as from any body tissue. Molecular markers can even be used to explore variation in the coding region. Polymorphism studies with restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) and single-stranded conformation polymorphism (SSCP) as type I markers, as well as close association of the desired trait of interest with a microsatellite marker, have also been found to be beneficial. SSCP in Jersey cattle for the IL8 gene had significant association with both subclinical and clinical mastitis. The beta defensin 5 encoding gene has been studied as a candidate gene for mastitis resistance.

Intramammary infusion of recombinant protein reduces the incidence of mastitis. The main advantages of recombinant proteins are that they are easily degraded in the body system and subsequently the risk of evolving resistant pathogens is minimized. Moreover these recombinant peptides can be administered during the lactational stage, when the animal is most susceptible to the incidence of mastitis. Also the antibacterial peptide, which is not normally expressed in the species through recombinant technology, may be expressed in substantial amounts after manipulating the regulatory region. In vitro and in vivo studies indicate that rbIL2 enhances the functional capabilities of mononuclear cells within the mammary gland, and rbIL2 enhances immune response by intramammary infusion during increased risk of mastitis and when administered with antibiotics, improves mastitis resistance. Recombinant bovine neutrophil b-defensin had strong bactericidal activity against S. aureus and Escherichia coli, and it have also been suggested to be used as a therapeutic for treating mastitis.",

For the first time, foreign protein was produced in mouse milk in 1987. A Jersey cow was cloned with lysostaphin gene insert by somatic cell nuclear transfer. March 2000 is regarded as the time of the first appearance of a transgenic cow resistant to mastitis, named \"Annie.\" Genes for lysostaphin, green fluorescent protein (an antibiotic marker), and the sheep gene for b-Lactoglobulin, which served as a switch, were introgressed in the fibroblast cell nucleus. This nucleus was then introgressed in the enucleated unfertilized ovum which was then implanted as a fertilized egg and thus Annie was born. This was confirmed by genetic testing of the umbilical cord, which was transgenic. A transgenic approach to enhance disease resistance involves the production of pathogen-specific antibodies into milk. Transgenic animals producing corona virus, neutralizing antibodies into milk under the control of 5 0 regulatory regions of the murine whey acidic protein gene, have been reported. In the future, this technology to enhance mastitis resistance may be helpful for the generation of the appropriate hybridoma cell line. Another transgenic approach is the overproduction of the pIgR gene in mammalian epithelial cells, conferring its resistance against mastitis.

Through somatic cell nuclear transfer, transgenic cattle with increased resistance to tuberculosis can finally be obtained. No off-target effects on cow genetics were observed, which implies that CRISPR technology may be better suited to producing transgenic livestock with purposefully manipulated genetics. Employing this technology may be better suited to producing transgenic livestock with purposefully manipulated genetics. A total of 11 calves with new genes inserted using CRISPR were assessed for resistance to tuberculosis and any off-target genetic effects. Genetic analysis of the calves revealed that NRAMP1 had successfully integrated into the genetic code at the targeted region in all the calves.

Apolipoprotein B mRNA-editing enzyme (APOBEC3) proteins, which act against a wide variety of retroviruses including HIV, have been studied in sheep and could be good candidates for SRLVs. A human APOBEC3G variant has been associated with rapid HIV-1 disease progression. Recently, allele and haplotype variants of the transmembrane protein gene 154 (TMEM154) locus have been associated with SRLV infection and has been proposed as a locus that could be used for genetic marker-based selection. Sheep with the ancestral variant haplotypes of this gene have an increased risk of becoming infected compared with individuals with mutant forms. However, the function of TMEM14 has not yet been established.",

Porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) has a narrow host cell tropism limited to cells of the monocyte/macrophage lineage. CD163 protein is expressed at high levels on the surface of specific macrophage types, and a soluble form is circulating in blood. CD163 has been described as a fusion receptor for PRRSV, with the scavenger receptor cysteine-rich domain 5 (SRCR5) region having been shown to be the interaction site for the virus. As reported previously, genetically edited pigs were developed in which exon 7 of the CD163 gene has been deleted using CRISPR/ Cas9 editing in pig zygotes. These pigs express CD163 protein lacking SRCR5 (DSRCR5 CD163) and show no adverse effects when maintained under standard husbandry conditions. Not only was DSRCR5 CD163 detected on the surface of macrophage subsets, but the secreted, soluble protein can also be detected in the serum of the edited pigs, as shown here by a porcine soluble CD163-specific enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). Previous results showed that primary macrophage cells from DSRCR5 CD163 animals are resistant to PRRSV-1 subtypes 1, 2, and 3 as well as PRRSV-2 infection in vitro. Here, DSRCR5 pigs were challenged with a highly virulent PRRSV-1 subtype 2 strain. In contrast to the wild-type control group, DSRCR5 pigs showed no signs of infection and no viremia or antibody response indicative of a productive infection. Histopathological analysis of lung and lymph node tissue showed no presence of virus-replicating cells in either tissue. This shows that DSRCR5 pigs are fully resistant to infection by the virus.",

Some of the major genes identified were MHC, caspase 1 genes, NRAMP1, inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS), complement, and TLR4. 2. MHC class I was observed to be associated with Salmonella colonization. MHC classes I and II were reported to be linked to resistance against Salmonella and antibiotic-response kinetics. MHC B haplotypes were observed to be linked with Salmonella-specific antibody responses in Vietnam. 3. Differential mRNA expression profile was observed for IL6, IL8, and IL18 with respect to resistant and susceptible chickens. In the mRNA expression in the heterophils of resistant and susceptible chickens, it was shown that the mRNA level of different interleukins such as IL6, IL8, and IL18 were upregulated in resistant chickens compared with susceptible chickens. 4. The mRNA levels of transforming growth factor (TGFb4) were found to be downregulated in the heterophils of resistant chickens. 5. mRNA levels of interferon gamma (IFN g) were found to be downregulated in susceptible chickens compared with resistant chickens. 6. Resistance to Salmonella has been linked to different genes such as ILs, IFNg, TLRs, iNOS, and genes involved in apoptosis. 7. Resistant chicken lines showed an upregulated expression of interleukins such as IL2, IL6, IL8, and IFNg in the small intestines compared with susceptible chicken lines. Interferon gamma gene expression was significantly downregulated in susceptible chicks compared with resistant ones. Interferon g expression level represents a valuable indication of immunodeficiency associated with persistence of Salmonella in the chicken digestive tract. Thus, IFNg represents a factor to consider in the development of prophylactic measures for the reduction of NRAMP1 carrier state. 8. NRAMP1 is a candidate gene associated with salmonella enteritidis (SE)-mediated immune response and is related to the phagocytosis of SE. Studies have shown that the enhancement of host immunity mediated by the upregulation of NRAMP1 mRNA in heterophil granulocytes and spleen might be more obvious and earlier in SE infection-resistant chicks than in susceptible chicks. Different variations in the NRAMP1 gene have been associated with resistance to salmonellosis. Association analysis indicated that A24101991G is significantly associated with chicken salmonellosis resistance. 9. Certain genes such as NRAMP1, TGFb3, TGFb4, and TRAIL have been found to be potent candidates for disease resistance against Salmonella. The candidate gene approach is a useful method to investigate the genes involved in genetic resistance. 10. Twelve candidate genes were reported in the pathogenesis of Salmonella in meat-type chicken. These genes include NRAMP1, prosaposin (PSAP), inhibitor of apoptosis protein 1 (IAP1), inducible nitric oxide production (iNOS), caspase-1 (CASP1), interferon-gamma (IFNg), immunoglobulin light chain (IGL), interleukin-2 (IL2), transforming growth factors B2, B3 and B4 (TGFB2, B3 and B4) and ZOV3. Salmonella enteritidis infection was given to birds at 3 weeks post hatch. At day 7 post infection SE load was quantified in caecum, spleen and liver contents. In caecum nine out of 12 genes were found to be associated with bacterial load. These genes include CASP1, SLC11A1, IAP1, PSAP, iNOS, IL2, TGFB2, TGFB4, and IGL.

SNP studies have shown three SNPs in an exon of chTLR15. One of the SNPs was found to be associated with Salmonella infection. The \"T\" allele in SNP C726T might be linked to resistance of Salmonella infection. The mRNA expression of TLR15 in heterophils of chickens infected with SE was downregulated than that of the control group at third day of post infection. However, TLR15 was upregulated in the spleen of chickens infected by SE at day 3 pi. The above discussed genes are potential candidates that can be used for selection programs for increasing genetic resistance against Salmonella Enteritidis in chickens. 13. A number of factors that include NRAMP1, MHC, TLR4 and a novel genetic locus SAL1 determine the genetic resistance of chicken against SE. 14. After analysing and comparing studies of MyD88, novel mutation G4810372T was found that was thought to have an effect on immune response of the individual. Further studies are needed to elucidate the molecular mechanisms that occur due to MyD88 gene polymorphisms. After correlating susceptibility toward Salmonella Pullorum and MyD88 polymorphisms, it was found that alleles in SNP1 locus and SNP1 and SNP3 genotypes reported a significant effect against Salmonella. Also the advantaged haploid type combined by SNP1, SNP3 and SNP4 loci played a very significant role in genetic resistance to Salmonella Pullorum infection. Myeloid differentiation primary response gene 88 polymorphisms or advantaged haploid type in a particular region had a positive effect against susceptibility to Salmonella Pullorum infection. From the above observations it can be concluded that MyD88 can be used as a candidate gene which could provide a conceptual reference for MAS for poultry. 15. In a study that was based on the biological function and SE response of various genes, five candidate genes were selected that were found to have a role in Salmonella enteritidis infection. These genes include TLR4, macrophage migration inhibitory factor, T cell-specific protein (CD28), TNF-a, and MD-2. In TLR4, CD28, and MD-2, SNPs were found. The SNPs were tested for associations between sire SNP and Salmonella enteritidis response. The association of sire SNP with cecum bacterial load and vaccine antibody response was found to be statistically significant. Association of MD2 SNP was statistically significant with bacterial load in spleen.

Different candidate SNPs for MAS for disease resistance have been detected. The candidate genes play a vital role in regulating immunological response in chickens. 2. Approaches such RNAi technology have attempted to develop transgenic poultry resistant to AIV. Synthetic RNA duplexes (siRNA) can be employed to trigger RNAi. Also, RNAi can be triggered by the expression of RNA duplexes in hairpin structures (shRNA) that can be processed into siRNA by RNA endonucleases. siRNA specific for conserved domains of the influenza virus genes have been observed to inhibit replication of various influenza viruses in a study on chicken cell lines developed from embryo. Stable expression of influenzaspecific shRNA via a lentiviral vector in a cell line makes the cells refractory to influenza virus infection. After introduction of the above-mentioned lentiviral vector into mouse lung, an inhibition in virus production was detected in vivo. Hence, there is a possibility to develop influenza-resistant poultry flocks by transgenic expression of influenza-specific shRNA. Hence in the current era, avian influenza-resistant chicken can be produced using a combination of transgenesis and RNAi that can be used for AIV gene expression inhibition. Screening of siRNAs as candidate genes in vitro is the key step for transgenic breeding. Bioinformatics along with other online search tools is helpful for designing siRNAs that target different mRNA sites of the AIV H5N1 subtype. Five rational siRNAs were chosen and five U6 promoter-driven shRNA expression plasmids that contained the siRNA genes were constructed and used to develop stably transfected MadineDarby canine kidney cells. 3. Indirect immunofluorescent antibody, virus titration, PUI stained flow cytometry, RT-PCR, and DAS ELISA revealed that all five stably transfected cell lines, when exposed to CCID 50 of AIV, were resistant to viral replication. Finally, transgenic chicken were developed from the plasmids (pSi604i and pSi 1597i). These findings provide baseline information for breeding transgenic chickens resistant to AIV in combination with RNAi. 4. Although to date transgenic bird flu-resistant chickens are not available, transgenic chickens have been developed with some success in minimizing the spread of AIV but have been unable to prevent the emergence of disease. 5. In our laboratory, we have undertaken one research project funded by the Science and Engineering Board, Department of Science and technology, Government of India, titled \"Genetic characterization of indigenous ducks and study of its innate immunity particularly against avian influenza.\" To our observation, we have found that duck, an important poultry species, was asymptomatic to avian influenza. Our main aim is to identify the potential genes present in ducks which confer immunity against avian influenza. In the later part, we can insert the gene in chickens for the development of bird flu-resistant transgenic chicken production. It is an ongoing project, and in the initial phase we have identified RIG1, TLR3, and TLR7 as important potent genes that bind with the AI protein as H (hemagglutinin) and N (neuraminidase) through in silico studies. It is very interesting to note that the chicken genome is devoid of RIG1, whereas it is present and expressed well in ducks.",

Many loci have been known to be involved in disease resistance, but only a few genes have been identified as having an actual role: 1. MHC plays a vital role in resistance against MD. Being a polygenic trait, many genes and gene loci have been reported to be involved in MD resistance. MHC is one among gene/loci to be involved in genetic resistance against MD. 2. Other genes that are non-MHC in origin have also been linked to play a role in genetic resistance/susceptibility to MD. These genes include growth hormone gene, cytokines (IL6 and IL18), and the stem lymphocyte antigen 6 complex (LY6E) gene. 3. Loci rs14527240 and GGaluGA156129 have been reported to play a role in host resistance/susceptibility to MD. 4. Expression studies suggest a possible role of SMOC1 gene in MD susceptibility. 5. Nitric oxide, apart from being a promising antiviral agent, plays a role in modulating immunological responses. While working on MD it was found that chickens resistant to MD have the ability to have more enhanced nitric oxide production than that of susceptible chicken lines. The above observation was made by measuring nitric oxide levels from chicken fibroblasts taken from these chicken lines after treatment with LPS and recombinant chicken IFN-g. Further plasma nitric oxide levels were measured in chicken lines (N2a, P2a) inoculated with JM-16 strain of MDV. The levels of NO were found to be increased in N2a chickens in the majority of experiments carried out. The level of the NO production was found to be associated with the range of virulence of the MDV strain. Inoculation with more virulent strains induced the highest NO levels, which suggests a possible role of NO during disease progression. 6. Quantitative RT-PCR studies depict that IFNg does not primarily induce iNOS gene expression during MDV infection. Nitric acid production and inducible nitric oxide gene expression are mediated during the cytolytic phase of infection. These findings suggest that NO may play a role in increasing MDV virulence by suppressing the immune system. 7. In order to breed chicken genetically resistant to MD, it is essential to have sufficient knowledge about markers that play a role in resistance to MD. A study was carried to identify the MD-resistant markers in chicken lines. Copy number variation (CNV) was studied in inbred MD-resistant and susceptible chicken lines. In four chicken lines, 45 CNVs were detected, of which 28 were involved in cellular proliferation and immunological responses. Also, two CNVs observed to be associated with resistance to MD were inherited to the descendant recombinant congenic lines that differ in MD susceptibility. These observations may be useful for designing better and more reliable strategies to improve genetic disease resistance in poultry.",

            "text": "Newcastle disease, commonly known as ranikhet disease, had a high prevalence causing heavy mortality. The causative agent of Newcastle disease is Newcastle disease virus (NDV), which belongs to paramyxovirus and is a negative-sense RNA consisting of about 15 \u00c2 10 3 nucleotides. This is an enormously destructive and contagious disease that causes serious problems in the poultry industry globally. Among different poultry diseases, NDV was reported to be the fourth-most-destructive disease and led to heavy losses for the poultry industry. Newcastle disease is considered the most widespread disease in animals along with rabies and bovine tuberculosis. Nonspecific symptoms for NDV include ruffled feathers, depression, breathing problems, anorexia, hyperthermia, and listlessness followed by death. Affected chickens show respiratory and neurological complications and also a reduction in egg production. Chickens infected with NDV are able to raise an antibody and gene response. The antibody response varies in different chicken breeds; hence understanding the genetics of the immune response may help in improving disease resistance in chickens.",

A novel QTL found to be associated with antibody response was identified. From the proximal end of GGA1, this QTL region was located approximately 100 Mb away. This region was predicted to play an important role in the immune response of the chicken. Two genes, namely ROBO1 and ROBO2, were observed to be promising candidate genes that might have a role in modulating antibody response in chickens infected with NDV. For further confirmation of the role of these genes, silencing and overexpression of ROBO1 and ROBO2 need to be carried out both in vivo and in vitro. Host response toward NDV infection is poorly understood. 2. A transcriptional profiling study of chicken embryo cells was carried out in order to have a better understanding of hostepathogen interactions during NDV infection. Analysis of chicken embryo cells infected with NDV strain D58 was carried out by quantitative RT-PCR. Some genes under study were upregulated and some were downregulated. Genes such as IFN-a, IFN-g, DDX-1, and MHC-1 were upregulated, while the IL6 gene was downregulated. Expression levels of the M and F genes of the virus were also measured. The genes that encode for proinflammatory response, cellular responses, and other genes that regulate interferons were found to be affected during the infection. The observations suggest the involvement of different signaling pathways that are involved in host response toward infection.",

Tom Berghof was the lead researcher of this study. They used genetic differences in the whole genome to identify DNA regions that occur more often in chickens with high natural antibody (NAb) levels or in chickens with low NAb levels. One region was detected with a very large effect on NAb level, which explained more than 60% of the genetic variation observed. Within this region, one candidate gene was eventually identified. The region was observed to contain a few genes. It is very difficult to identify the difference at the DNA level that explains the difference in NAb level. Most likely this difference is due to the TLR1A gene, which makes it the main candidate.",

NAbs are important for fighting pathogensdthey inhibit and prevent further infection in the body. Simultaneously, they also warn and activate other parts of the immune system.

Future research is needed to investigate the role of TLR1A in the immune system of chickens. In the long term, this could result in improved vaccines and health-promoting nutrition.
