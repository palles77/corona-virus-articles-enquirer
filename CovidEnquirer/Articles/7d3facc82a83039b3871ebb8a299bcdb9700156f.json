            "text": "USP9X is a conserved deubiquitinase (DUB) that regulates multiple cellular processes. Dysregulation of USP9X has been linked to cancers and X-linked intellectual disability. Here, we report the crystal structure of the USP9X catalytic domain at 2.5-\u00c5 resolution. The structure reveals a canonical USP-fold comprised of fingers, palm, and thumb subdomains, as well as an unusual \u03b2-hairpin insertion. The catalytic triad of USP9X is aligned in an active configuration. USP9X is exclusively active against ubiquitin (Ub) but not Ub-like modifiers. Cleavage assays with di-, tri-, and tetraUb chains show that the USP9X catalytic domain has a clear preference for K11-, followed by K63-, K48-, and K6-linked polyUb chains. Using a set of activity-based diUb and triUb probes (ABPs), we demonstrate that the USP9X catalytic domain has an exo-cleavage preference for K48-and endo-cleavage preference for K11-linked polyUb chains. The structure model and biochemical data suggest that the USP9X catalytic domain harbors three Ub binding sites, and a zinc finger in the fingers subdomain and the \u03b2-hairpin insertion both play important roles in polyUb chain processing and linkage specificity. Furthermore, unexpected labeling of a secondary, noncatalytic cysteine located on a blocking loop adjacent to the catalytic site by K11-diUb ABP implicates a previously unreported mechanism of polyUb chain recognition. The structural features of USP9X revealed in our study are critical for understanding its DUB activity. The new Ub-based ABPs form a set of valuable tools to understand polyUb chain processing by the cysteine protease class of DUBs. deubiquitinase | activity-based probes | zinc finger | linkage specificity |",

Of the seven classes of DUBs, Ub-specific proteases (USPs) comprise the largest subfamily and account for over half of the DUBs encoded by the human genome (1) . The USPs are cysteine proteases characterized by a conserved USP catalytic domain (CD) fold, which resembles an overall hand-like structure with fingers, thumb, and palm subdomains. The core fold can be divided into six conserved boxes, where the N-terminal box 1 contains a Cys of the catalytic triad, and the C-terminal boxes 5 and 6 contain a His and an Asp/Asn residue, respectively (2) . The USP CD architecture is structurally conserved, although insertions at the loop regions between the boxes can drastically alter the size of the USP CDs (300-800 residues) (1-3).",

            "text": "Previous structural and biochemical studies of USP CDs, both in apo forms and in complex with Ub substrates, have provided insights into the molecular mechanism governing the diversity of USP activity regulation and substrate specificity (3, 4) . The most-studied USP7 is regulated by both its Ub substrate and its C-terminal Ub-like domains (5, 6) . Apo-USP7 adopts an inactive conformation, with loops near the active site blocking Ub binding to a misaligned catalytic triad. The binding of Ub induces conformational changes that promote substrate engagement and realignment of the catalytic residues into a productive state (5) . A C-terminal peptide of USP7 further activates the CD activity by binding to an adjacent activation cleft to stabilize the active conformation of USP7 (7) . Unlike other subfamilies of DUBs, USPs generally show a limited preference for a polyUb chain of different linkages. Only a few USP structures in complex with a diUb were reported (8) (9) (10) (11) . The crystal structures of the zebrafish CYLD CD in complex with M1-and K63-linked diUbs revealed the important contributions of the insertions to influence the proximal Ub binding (8) . A zinc finger (ZnF) motif in the fingers subdomain of USP21 CD accommodates the distal Ub to allow specificity for a linear polyUb chain, as well as a diUb-like modifier ISG15 (9) . A recent structure of USP18 CD in complex with ISG15 provides a molecular basis for its unique specificity toward ISG15 instead of Ub (10) . More recently, the cocrystal structure of USP30 CD with K6-linked diUb revealed the engagement of a proximal Ub binding site responsible for K6-linkage specificity (11) .",

Ubiquitin can form chains of different topology; each has a distinctive role in dictating the function and fate of the modified proteins. Deubiquitinases (DUBs) reverse ubiquitination. How DUBs recognize ubiquitin chains is a topic of immense interest due to the therapeutic potentials of human DUBs. We obtained the atomic details of the USP9X catalytic core, a DUB involved in cancers and developmental disorders, and revealed its unusual mechanisms of action using a set of activity-based ubiquitin probes. These probes will propel future investigation of how DUBs recognize and process ubiquitin chains and identify potential new sites on DUBs for drug discovery.",

Subsequent homolog analyses revealed a highly conserved protein from Drosophila to mammals (>90%) with important functions in both development and diseases (13, 14) . As the X-linked ortholog of faf, human USP9X escapes from X-chromosome inactivation. A highly related paralog, USP9Y (91% sequence identity), is found on the Y chromosome, the function of which remains uncharacterized. USP9X protein regulates numerous cellular processes, including cell polarity, apoptosis, migration, and stem cell self-renewal (15) . The importance of USP9X is further highlighted by a growing list of identified substrates and binding partners, including E3 ligases ITCH, SMURF1, and MARCH7 (15) (16) (17) (18) . USP9X is up-regulated in cervical, colorectal cancers, as well as myeloma, and proposed as a therapeutic target for cancer treatment (19, 20) . Dysregulation of USP9X is also linked to neurodevelopmental disorders and neurodegenerative diseases, including epilepsy, autism, Parkinson's, and Alzheimer's disease (20) (21) (22) . Multiple genetic studies have established the causal link between USP9X mutations and X-linked intellectual disability (15, 23, 24) .

Comparison of the structure of USP9X with those of other USPs in complex with diUbs suggests that USP9X CD harbors three potential sites (S2, S1, and S1\u2032) that could bind to distal, central, and proximal Ubs of a polyUb chain, respectively. A unique \u03b2-hairpin insertion in sequence box 6 contributes to the recognition of the proximal Ub in a linkage-specific manner. Furthermore, labeling with triUb ABPs revealed linkage-dependent endo-or exo-cleavage by USP9X. Unexpectedly, besides the catalytic cysteine, we also identified that a noncatalytic cysteine close to the catalytic cleft reacts with a K11-linked diUb probe, which implicates that USP9X samples the conformational space of diUb before a productive substrate engagement. Taking these data together, we propose a model in which the USP9X CD serves as an extensive platform to accommodate multiple Ub moieties of a polyUb chain to achieve linkage-specific cleavage.",

Notably, a Gln1683 residue is positioned close (3.6 \u00c5) to the catalytic Cys1566 in the apo structure (SI Appendix, Fig. S1B ). It must adopt a different rotamer conformation to accommodate the C terminus of a Ub substrate as observed for an equivalent Gln293 in the USP7-Ub complex structure (SI Appendix, Fig. S1C ). Interestingly, Gln1683 is conserved among USP DUBs and often with a juxtaposed second Gln residue. Close to the active site, USP9X contains two blocking loops, BL1 (1,801-1,810) connecting \u03b213 and \u03b214 and BL2 (1,872-1,879) connecting \u03b216 and \u03b217 ( Fig. 1B and SI Appendix, Fig. S2 ), similar to those in USP7 (5) (6) (7) 26 ) that form the binding cleft for the C-terminal tail of Ub. A unique USP9X \u03b2-hairpin insertion is located next to the two blocking loops (Fig. 1B) , suggesting the insertion may have some effect on the recognition of the Ub tail. Interestingly, a loop connecting helices \u03b14 and \u03b15, which corresponds to the switching loop of USP7 (6), is 2 aa longer than that of USP7, and protrudes into space otherwise occupied by the C-terminal activating tail in USP7 (SI Appendix, Fig. S1D ).

The importance of these loops remains unclear, but a high percentage of negatively charged Asp and Glu residues in the \u03b12-\u03b13 loop may be of significance. A third 20-aa insertion (1,924-1,943) between \u03b19 and \u03b222 within box 6 forms an unexpected \u03b2-hairpin structure in the palm subdomain of the USP fold. Sequence alignment revealed the \u03b2-hairpin insertion is completely conserved among USP9X from different species, as well as in the related USP9Y, whereas the two other insertions are not (SI Appendix, Fig. S2 ). This suggests the \u03b2-hairpin insertion may be functionally important. Analysis of the evolutionary conservation profile of USP9X CD using ConSurf algorithm (27) indicates the active site, the Ub C-terminal tail binding region, and a patch of the fingers subdomain, are highly conserved (SI Appendix, Fig. S3) .",

Both USP9X and the K63 and M1 dualspecific USP, CYLD, have a large insertion within sequence box 6. The insertion in CYLD forms helices/bend structural elements (28) located next to the two blocking loops and also extends a \u03b2-hairpin in the palm subdomain that contributes to proximal Ub recognition (8) . Similarly, the insertion in USP9X may also be involved in polyUb chain specificity. Furthermore, the fingers subdomain of some USPs is known to bind to a distal Ub of a polyUb chain, as shown in the USP21-linear diUb complex (9) . Based on structural modeling and comparison with other USPs, we postulate that the USP9X CD may harbor three Ub binding sites (S2, S1, and S1\u2032) (Fig. 1B) and cleave a polyUb chain linkage-dependently.",

Unlike some other USPs that show cross-activities toward UBLs, such as SUMO and ISG15 (29, 30) , USP9X is only active toward Ub, with no measurable activity for SUMO1-, NEDD8-, or ISG15-AMC (Fig. 1D ). Using the Ub-AMC substrate, we determined the kinetic parameters for USP9X CD with k cat = 0.25 \u00b1 0.01 min \u22121 and K m = 0.10 \u00b1 0.02 \u03bcM (SI Appendix, Fig. S5A and Table S1 ). The k cat and K m of USP9X CD are vastly different from those of the USP7 CD (k cat = 4.6 min \u22121 and K m = 44.2 \u03bcM) (31) . The specificity constant (k cat /K m ) of USP9X (2.5 min \u22121 \u03bcM \u22121 ) is 25-fold higher than that of USP7 CD (0.10 min \u22121 \u03bcM \u22121 ). We next assessed the activity of USP9X CD toward eight diUb substrates of different linkages. USP9X CD displayed various cleavage efficiencies, with a preference for K11-, K63-, K48-, and K6-linkages ( Fig. 1E and SI Appendix, Fig. S5B ). Low level of cleavage was observed for K27-, K29-, and K33-diUbs and no cleavage observed for M1-linked diUb (Fig. 1E) . We further assessed the cleavage of K6-, K11-, K63-, K48-linked tetraUb substrates and observed that K11-linked tetraUb was processed more efficiently than K63-or K48-linked chains, with poor cleavage of K6-linked tetraUb (SI Appendix, Fig. S5C ).",

We systematically name the ABPs based on the chemical bond subjected to DUB cleavage, which can be a cleavable native peptide bond (CL), a noncleavable linker (NC), a Michael acceptor (MA) warhead, or the abbreviation of a specific reactive group, followed by a number to indicate the location of the bond of interest. We previously reported K48-and K63-diUb probes with an internal MA (32) , which are now denoted K48-or K63-diUb-MA1. In this study, we additionally generated K6-and K11-diUb-MA1 ABPs (SI Appendix, Fig. S6 ). These diUb-MA1 ABPs interrogate the Ub binding to the S1 site and a potential S1\u2032 (proximal) site in the DUB catalytic core. To probe the Ub binding at a potential S2 site in DUBs, we prepared K6-, K11-, K48-, and K63-linked diUb probes that contain an NC linker (33) and a terminal propargylamine (PA) warhead (diUb-NC1-PA2) ( Fig. 2A and SI Appendix, Fig. S6 ).

The insertion in box 6 of the USP9X CD could play a similar role. Unlike the CYLD insertion that is partially disordered in the apo structure and induced into an extended \u03b2-hairpin upon substrate binding (8, 28) , the USP9X \u03b2-hairpin insertion is ordered in the apo structure. Crystal packing analysis revealed the \u03b2-hairpin pairs with the \u03b2-strands of the fingers subdomain of a symmetry-related molecule (SI Appendix, Fig. S11A ). Secondary structure (34) and disorder (35) predictions suggest this insertion has no strong propensity to adopt an \u03b1-helix, \u03b2-strand, or disordered conformation (SI Appendix, Fig.  S11 B and C) . This implicates that the observed conformation of the \u03b2-hairpin could have been influenced by crystal packing, and it may adopt a different conformation upon substrate binding.",

We only observed a slight change of the mutant in k cat and K m toward Ub-AMC (SI Appendix, Table S1 ), and monoUb-based Ub-PA probe labeling compared with WT (SI Appendix, Fig. S12  A and B) . Furthermore, labeling with diUb-NC1-PA2 probes, which measures S2-S1 binding, also only showed slightly reduced labeling efficiency for the deletion mutant (SI Appendix, Fig.  S12C ).

Using a gel-based DUB assay, the deletion mutant showed reduced cleavage of K11-, K48-, and K63-linked diUb (SI Appendix, Fig. S5B ) and triUb substrates (SI Appendix, Fig. S12E ) compared with WT. To quantify the activity, we used the IQF-diUb substrates for continuous monitoring of diUb cleavage. With K11and K63-linked IQF-diUb, the \u03b2-hairpin deletion reduced the cleavage efficiency significantly (Fig. 3B) .

USP9X CD showed a twofold higher catalytic activity (k cat /K m ) for K11-compared with K63-linked diUb-NC1-AMC2 (SI Appendix, Table S2 ). Notably, USP9X CD is much less active against K48-diUb-NC1-AMC2 with an eightfold lower k cat /K m , suggesting that the positioning of the distal Ub influences the endo-cleavage activity.",

The resulting diUb-MA1 probe may in turn label the DUB. In scenario 2, the DUB engages the triUb substrate exclusively in an exo-binding mode that leads to the labeling of DUB by the triUb probe. In scenario 3, both endo-or exo-binding modes are possible, and it will lead to simultaneous cleavage of the triUb at the native isopeptide bond and labeling by the warhead in the triUb probe. For K48 triUb-MA1-CL2, we observed no cleavage by USP9X CD but a robust labeling product in a timecourse experiment (Fig. 5C ). The identity of the upshifted labeling product band was confirmed by comparison with labeling of USP9X CD using K48-diUb-MA1 probe (SI Appendix, Fig. S15B ), consistent with scenario 2.

The consensus sequence of USP CD can be divided into six boxes, with possible insertions in several regions (2) . Our crystal structure of the USP9X CD confirms a conserved, canonical core USP fold with additional structural features that include a CHC2-type ZnF in the fingers subdomain and a unique \u03b2-hairpin insertion in sequence box 6. The structure of USP9X CD and the functional studies using novel Ub-based probes implicate three potential Ub binding sites (S1, S2, and S1\u2032) in USP9X CD. Some USPs contain a C4type ZnF at the tip of the fingers subdomain. Only in USP21 was it shown structurally that the ZnF is involved in binding the S2 Ub in a polyUb chain. Our ZnF mutagenesis and ABP labeling data suggest that an S2 Ub binding site likely exists in USP9X. CYLD contains a distinctive truncated fingers subdomain without a ZnF motif and a large insertion in box 6. The reduced binding surface of the fingers subdomain and the insertion render specificities for the more flexible linear and K63-linked polyUbs through S1 and S1\u2032 sites. Similarly, a large, conserved insertion of USP9X within box 6 is also involved in the specific recognition of the proximal Ub of a polyUb chain. There exist two other less conserved, large insertions in the USP9X CD that are disordered in the crystal structure, located farther away from the catalytic binding cleft and may have other unknown functions.",

Conversely, several other USPs showed cross-reactivity toward ISG15 and SUMO (29, 30) . The recent crystal structure of USP18 in complex with ISG15 provided a structure-based explanation (10) . A hydrophobic patch in ISG15 centered on Trp121, Pro128, and His149 interacts with complementary hydrophobic residues in USP18. Unlike ISG15, Ub contains polar residues (Arg42, Gln49, and Val70) at these ISG15 equivalent sites, which would complement polar residues found in Ub-reactive USPs such as USP7 (10) . Like USP7, USP9X also contains polar residues at this binding interface that would be unfavorable for ISG15 (SI Appendix, Fig. S16 ). Neither is USP9X active against NEDD8, the most homologous UBL to Ub. The complex structure of USP21 with linear diUb provided insight into how USP21 distinguishes Ub from NEDD8 (9) . A conserved Glu304 residue in USP21 interacts specifically with the guanidinium group of Arg72 of Ub C-terminal tail. The equivalent position in NEDD8 is an Ala. A secondary polar patch of USP21 (Glu427 and Lys448) in the fingers subdomain interact with the \u03b21/\u03b22 loop of Ub but would clash sterically with and repel the larger, charged residues in NEDD8.

Gln1683Ala mutation did not increase the k cat of USP9X CD, but rather significantly increased K m toward monoUb substrate. Kinetics of cleavage assay of IQF-K11 diUb substrate did not show any significant differences between the Q1683A mutant and the WT (SI Appendix, Fig.  S13C ).

The elongated \u03b2-hairpin insertion likely restricts the motion of the proximal Ub and entraps the isopeptide into the groove between BL1 and BL2, leading to the labeling of Cys1808 by the MA warhead in the K11-diUb-MA1 probe (Fig. 4C) . By this notion, the removal of \u03b2-hairpin insertion in USP9X CD resulted in reduced labeling efficiency of Cys1808 by the K11-diUb-MA1 probe (Fig. 4A) , likely due to reduced contact time of the MA warhead with Cys1808. Furthermore, a Gln1683Ala mutation in USP9X, intended to unblock the active site cleft, improved the active site Cys1566 labeling markedly (SI Appendix, Fig. S13A ), mimicking the effect of \u03b2-hairpin deletion albeit with greater efficiency. Differently, we observed preference of Cys1808 labeling over the catalytic Cys1566 by K11-diUb-MA1 probe in the USP9X ZnF mutant (Fig. 4A) . This observation suggests that the interaction between the USP9X ZnF and the Ub N-terminal region may influence the binding mode of the S1 Ub C-terminal tail and the attached proximal Ub.",

To address this question, we designed and generated two types of triUb probes (Fig. 2B) . We observed efficient endo-cleavage of the K11-and K63-, but not the K48-linked triUb-NC1-CL2 substrates (Fig. 5B) . When comparing the endoand exo-modes of Ub chain processing using the triUb-MA1-CL2 probes, we found that an exo-cleavage is exclusively preferred for K48-polyUb chain. For K11-triUb chain, USP9X CD prefers endo-over exo-cleavage. These observations revealed linkagedependent polyUb cleavage modes of the USP9X CD. Our results also suggest that the unique \u03b2-hairpin in box 6 facilitates the efficient endo-cleavage of K63-polyUb chain based on the reduced cleavage of K63-linked triUb-NC1-CL2 by the USP9X \u03b2-hairpin deletion mutant (Fig. 5E) .",

The formation of an E3 ligase and DUB complex is a recurring theme observed for many DUBs and probably plays a role in more precise control of substrate ubiquitination and the chain linkages through trimming and editing. OTU-type DUB A20 contains both a ligase domain and a DUB domain and shows an exo-cleavage preference for K48-chain and endo-cleavage activity for the K63-chain, presumably allowing the assembly of an intact degradation signal (K48) while maintaining rapid control of signaling event through the K63-polyUb chain (38) . USP9X plays multiple roles in cell cycle, endocytosis, and degradation. The endo-cleavage preference for K11-and exo-cleavage preference for K48-polyUb chains of USP9X may fit in its role in the different cellular processes, which needs to be further tested in a cellular system.",

            "text": "In summary, while monoUb and diUbs provide a snapshot of substrate recognition by DUBs, our activity-based hybrid triUb probes allow deeper interrogation of the polyUb chain binding modes of USP9X and reveal interesting details. Linkagedependent endo-and exo-Ub chain cleavage modes were clearly defined using the two types of hybrid triUb probes. We propose a model where the USP9X CD accommodates a chain of three Ubs, with the distal and proximal Ubs occupying the S2 and S1\u2032 sites close to the ZnF motif and \u03b2-hairpin insertion, respectively (Fig.  5A) . A structure-based triUb recognition model has previously been proposed for the human OTU subfamily DUBs and SARS PLpro (39, 40) . In our USP9X model, whereas the ZnF motif is rigid, the extended \u03b2-hairpin insertion is presumably flexible and may impart specificity for different chain topologies. PolyUb chains can bind USP9X in three distinct modes, which could dictate the endo-versus exo-cleavage specificity (Fig. 5A) . A potential binding groove between BL1 and BL2, revealed by the specific labeling of the noncatalytic Cys1808, suggests an intriguing possibility that USP9X CD may recognize a branched polyUb chain, such as K11/K63 (41) . This remains to be tested in future studies. Overall, the USP9X CD provides a fascinating example of small, yet important structural features that may dictate the polyUb chain linkage specificity and influence the dynamics of polyUb binding and recognition by the USP catalytic core.",

Mutants were generated by site-directed mutagenesis. All USP9X proteins were overexpressed in Escherichia coli BL21-CodonPlus (DE3)-RIL strain grown in Terrific Broth using a LEX bioreactor (Epiphyte3) or in LB media using a shaker incubator. Cells were grown at 37\u00b0C until the OD 600 reached 1.5 and protein expression was induced with 0.25 mM isopropyl-\u03b2-D-thiogalactopyranoside (IPTG) at 18\u00b0C overnight using the LEX bioreactor. Alternatively, shaker flask culture was grown at 37\u00b0C until the OD 600 reached 0.6 and protein expression was induced with 0.4 mM IPTG at 16\u00b0C overnight. For USP9X purification, all buffers were adjusted to pH 8.0 at room temperature.
