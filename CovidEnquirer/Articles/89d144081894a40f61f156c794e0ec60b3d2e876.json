Since then, infections have been detected in >1500 individuals, with disease severity ranging from asymptomatic to severe, fatal pneumonia. To elucidate the pathogenesis of this virus and investigate mechanisms underlying disease severity variation in the absence of autopsy data, a rhesus macaque and common marmoset model of MERS-CoV disease were analyzed. Rhesus macaques developed mild disease, and common marmosets exhibited moderate to severe, potentially lethal, disease. Both nonhuman primate species exhibited respiratory clinical signs after inoculation, which were more severe and of longer duration in the marmosets, and developed bronchointerstitial pneumonia. In marmosets, the pneumonia was more extensive, with development of severe airway lesions. Quantitative analysis showed significantly higher levels of pulmonary neutrophil infiltration and higher amounts of pulmonary viral antigen in marmosets. Pulmonary expression of the MERS-CoV receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4, was similar in marmosets and macaques. These results suggest that increased virus replication and the local immune response to MERS-CoV infection likely play a role in pulmonary pathology severity. Together, the rhesus macaque and common marmoset models of MERS-CoV span the wide range of disease severity reported in MERS-CoVeinfected humans, which will aid in investigating MERS-CoV disease pathogenesis.

            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) was first isolated in 2012 from a human with fatal acute pneumonia in Saudi Arabia. 1 Since the initial case, >1500 human cases of MERS-CoV infection have been detected (World Health Organization, http://www.who.int/csr/don/30september-2015-mers-saudi-arabia/en, last accessed October 9, 2015); most of these cases have occurred in or near the Arabian Peninsula (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, http://www.cdc.gov/coronavirus/mers/about/index. html, last accessed October 9, 2015) . Dromedary camels, common in the Arabian Peninsula, are thought to serve as a reservoir for MERS-CoV, 2 which may, in part, help explain the clustering of human MERS-CoV infections in this geographic location. The exact route of transmission of MERS-CoV from camels to humans has not been definitively identified, although dromedary camels infected with MERS-CoV have been shown to secrete high amounts of infectious virus in their nasal discharge 3 and viral RNA has been detected in their milk. 4 MERS-CoV causes a wide range of disease severity in infected humans, spanning from asymptomatic to severe, fatal pneumonia with acute respiratory distress syndrome occasionally accompanied by acute renal failure or gastrointestinal disease. 5 Most patients present with a fever and respiratory symptoms, which rapidly progress to pneumonia. The most common respiratory symptoms are attributed to lower respiratory tract disease and include dyspnea and coughing. 6 Few individuals solely develop mild upper respiratory tract symptoms, such as a sore throat. 6, 7 Severe disease, and death, because of MERS-CoV infection is most common in individuals affected by comorbidities, including diabetes, renal or cardiac disease, and hypertension. 8 The current case fatality rate is approximately 36% (World Health Organization, http://www.who.int/csr/don/30-september-2015mers-saudi-arabia/en, last accessed October 9, 2015); however, no autopsy reports detailing the gross or histological lesions that develop in fatal human infections have been published to date. To elucidate the pathogenesis of this virus and investigate underlying mechanisms for the variation in disease severity seen in humans, two nonhuman primate models of MERS-CoV disease were developed. These models simulated the wide range of disease severity seen in infected humans. After MERS-CoV inoculation, rhesus macaques developed mild to moderate disease, whereas common marmosets exhibited moderate to severe, potentially lethal, disease. 9, 10 Clinical description and virology of MERS-CoV infection in the rhesus macaque and common marmoset models have been reported separately. 9,10 Herein, we focus on detailed and specific histopathology aspects of the respiratory tract of infected animals to better define the pathology of MERS-CoV infection in the lungs. To this end, we quantitatively analyzed the bronchointerstitial pneumonia that developed in both nonhuman primate species after MERS-CoV inoculation and quantified the amount of MERS-CoV antigen in the lungs using digital imaging and analysis. We observed differences in pulmonary neutrophil infiltration and presence of viral antigen in rhesus macaques compared with common marmosets. Increased numbers of neutrophils in the lung and higher amounts of MERS-CoV antigen were observed in marmosets. However, marmosets and macaques had similar pulmonary expression of the MERS-CoV receptor, dipeptidyl peptidase 4 (DPP4). These results suggest that increased pulmonary virus replication and a robust local immune response to MERS-CoV infection may play a role in pulmonary pathology severity, with higher viral loads and a more pronounced acute inflammatory response observed in marmosets.",

            "text": "A mixed population of multinucleated cells was observed in areas of bronchointerstitial pneumonia in macaques and marmosets. The multinucleated cells were predominantly of macrophage origin, whereas the remainder was of epithelial origin. Other coronaviruses, including severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus, which causes pneumonia in humans, have been associated with the development of multinucleated cells of macrophage or epithelial origin. 14,15 Viral-induced cell-to-cell fusion may have caused the formation of the mixed population of multinucleated cells in the MERS-CoVeinoculated macaques and marmosets. MERS-CoV antigen was detected in the cytoplasm of scattered macrophages in marmoset and macaque lungs using IHC. Although it is possible that the viral antigen present in some of the macrophages was because of phagocytosis of cellular debris containing the virus, human macrophages can be productively infected with MERS-CoV, 16 which Bronchointerstitial pneumonia developed in both rhesus macaques and common marmosets after MERS-CoV inoculation; however, the percentage of the lung affected by lesions and infiltrated by neutrophils was higher in marmosets than in macaques at both 3 and 6 dpi. The higher pulmonary viral loads observed in the common marmosets at both 3 and 6 dpi may have induced a more robust acute inflammatory response, resulting in increased neutrophil recruitment to the lungs. Once present in the lungs, neutrophils can degranulate or release reactive oxygen species extracellularly, damaging pulmonary tissue and potentially causing more extensive pulmonary lesions and increased clinical disease severity. 17, 18 At 3 dpi, no differences were detected for T-lymphocyte, B-lymphocyte, or macrophage infiltration into the lungs of marmosets compared with macaques. However, upregulation of genes or RNA transcripts associated with proinflammatory mediators has been shown in areas of the lung affected by pneumonia at 3 dpi in both species. 9, 10 These results fit with what would be expected in tissues during the early phase of inflammation when an innate localized immune response is induced and neutrophils are the predominant effector cell type, before activation of the adaptive immune response. 19, 20 Marked changes in the numbers of infiltrating lymphocytes and macrophages usually are not evident until the later stages of inflammation. By 6 dpi, the difference in the mean percentage of the lung infiltrated by neutrophils, B lymphocytes, and macrophages had increased in marmosets compared with macaques; however, the few animals necropsied at the 6 dpi time point prevented statistical analyses from being performed at this time point. In macaques, at 6 dpi, there was a decrease in the mean percentage of the lung infiltrated by B lymphocytes and macrophages, which was associated with a decline in pulmonary viral antigen and viral loads. These results suggest that the viral infection was being cleared from the lung and that the inflammatory process was starting to resolve. At 6 dpi, the mean percentage of the lung infiltrated by neutrophils in rhesus macaques was similar to that at 3 dpi. However, in common marmosets, there was an increase in pulmonary neutrophil influx between 3 and 6 dpi, suggesting that there was ongoing acute pulmonary damage with resultant continued recruitment of neutrophils to the lung. At 3 and 6 dpi, higher pulmonary viral antigen and viral RNA loads were detected in common marmosets compared with rhesus macaques. The exact reason for the variation in virus replication rates in the lungs of these two nonhuman primate species is unknown. The difference in pulmonary viral loads was most likely not caused by differences in DPP4 expression, because the location and extent of DPP4 expression in the lungs was similar in the macaques and marmosets. The pulmonary viral load disparity may be because of differences between old world and new world primates in their susceptibility to MERS-CoV infection and virus replication, with rhesus macaques being less susceptible, or differences in the innate local immune response to a viral infection in the lung, which could lead to variations in MERS-CoVeinduced disease severity. Differences in viral loads and virus replication or disease severity between old world and new world primates have been described for other viral infections. 21e23 In addition, anatomical differences between the respiratory tracts of marmosets and macaques may also influence disease severity. Although the greater pulmonary viral load and its injurious effects on the pulmonary parenchyma are likely responsible for the increased inflammatory response observed in common marmosets, alternatively, it is possible that the more robust pulmonary inflammatory response in the marmosets may have promoted MERS-CoV replication, causing higher pulmonary viral loads in this primate species. It has previously been described that proinflammatory mediators and pathways can enhance replication of influenza A virus and herpes simplex virus type 1 24e26 ; similarly, MERS-CoV replication may be enhanced in a proinflammatory environment, resulting in the higher viral loads observed in common marmosets. The increased pulmonary neutrophil infiltration at both 3 and 6 dpi, rather than the pulmonary viral load alone, in the marmosets likely caused the increased extent of the pulmonary lesions, which led to the development of more severe clinical signs. These results suggest that increased virus replication, along with an intense local immune response to MERS-CoV infection, may result in the development of severe respiratory disease.",

In both species, we were able to detail changes in the influx of inflammatory cells in the lungs over time and show how the inflammatory process was associated with changes in pulmonary viral loads and viral antigen. Lower pulmonary viral loads and viral antigen in rhesus macaques were associated with a lower influx of neutrophils into the lung compared with common marmosets. In addition, we showed that differences in pulmonary viral loads and viral antigen between macaques and marmosets were not because of differences in pulmonary DPP4 expression.",

Although both nonhuman primate models can be used to investigate the pathogenesis of this disease, each model may be used for different applications. Rhesus macaques can serve as a model for mild MERS-CoV disease, which is increasingly being reported in humans infected with MERS-CoV. 27, 28 Common marmosets are the more suitable model for severe, potentially fatal, cases of MERS-CoV disease, which are typically reported in individuals who have an underlying comorbidity or in individuals of an older age. The severe bronchointerstitial pneumonia that develops in common marmosets inoculated with MERS-CoV makes marmosets an ideal model for testing the efficacy of medical countermeasures, such as antivirals, therapeutics, and vaccines. The smaller size of common marmosets favors this model for drug studies because it significantly lowers drug quantities; however, it precludes repeated blood sampling within a short time frame, and fewer species-specific reagents are available for marmosets compared with rhesus macaques. These limitations suggest that rhesus macaques may be a more suitable model for vaccine studies if repeated analysis of immune parameters is warranted. Although each model may be better suited for various applications, together, these two nonhuman primate models will aid in investigations aimed at combating the ongoing occurrence of human cases of MERS-CoV disease.",
