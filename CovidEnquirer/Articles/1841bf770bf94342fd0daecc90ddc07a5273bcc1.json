Due to concerns about high bacterial load, further processing steps were incorporated, initially composting, which aimed to reduce bacterial numbers by raising the temperature (Carroll and Jasper, 1978) . Later, it became popular to use as bedding solid material extracted from the products of the anaerobic digestion of manure as a way of offsetting the cost of digesters (Timms, 2008b) . Many combinations of separation, digestion and composting are now practised in the USA, allowing successful use of RMS bedding in cooler, wetter regions of the US (Timms, 2008a (Timms, , 2008b (Timms, , 2008c .",

Livestock manures are Category 2 Animal By-products, as defined by EC Regulation 1069/2009. As such, their use as a 'technical product' (e.g. animal bedding) is only permitted if strict conditions apply which minimise the health risks involved. 'Safe end use' of a product derived from animal by-products is defined as use 'under conditions which pose no unacceptable risks to public and animal health' (EC Regulation 1069 ). Member State jurisdictions are approaching this requirement in different ways. In the UK, the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra) and the Scottish Office have allowed the use of this bedding under controlled conditions, while research is carried out, while in Wales and Northern Ireland the practice is currently prohibited.",

(2010) reported a higher prevalence of severe hock lesions in cows bedded on dry or composted RMS compared with sand, straw and sawdust.

(2008) followed the bmSCC patterns of nine farms that converted to RMS (including fresh, composted and digested), some increased and some decreased after conversion. An attempt was made to compare the change in bmSCC over a 7 year period on these farms with the whole state population; this unpublished analysis indicated that a linear score for bmSCC increased more rapidly on the RMS farms than in the whole state population, but, since the bedding types in the whole state were not known, the authors were reluctant to draw conclusions. Early experiences in Europe suggest that acceptable bmSCC levels can be achieved on RMS, but variation between farms is wide. Feiken and van Laarhoven (2012) monitored three farms in The Netherlands for 2 years after changing to RMS. With a previous annual mean bmSCC range from 147,000 to 272,000 cells/mL, two of the three farms reduced bmSCC. Only the farm with the lowest cell count increased (to 183,000 cells/mL) in the second year. The authors considered that success with RMS was associated with high quality management of the bedding. One year after introduction of RMS bedding on 11 Danish farms, annual average bmSCC was lower on four farms, and higher on seven, than in the previous year (Marcher Holm and Pedersen, 2015) .",

(2008) tested 15-36 samples of unused RMS bedding from each of nine types of bedding from six farms -including composted and digested materials. Both composting and anaerobic digestion (Timms, 2008b; Pronto and Gooch, 2009 ) significantly reduced MAP levels. However, on at least one occasion, MAP was found in all but one of the materials, albeit at low levels, indicating that neither composting nor digestion can guarantee elimination of this pathogen. The highest prevalence was positive results from 12/24 samples of freshly separated material from one farm, with a mean load of 174 cfu/g. For this reason, and because of the high risk of MAP transmission in early life, it is recommended that RMS is not used to bed any areas where cows are kept for the late dry period or calving, or housing for calves or young stock.",

However, there is little or no information on the influence that such a 'closed cycle' will have, either on the virulence of pathogens or (of particular current concern) on the genetic material conveying antimicrobial resistance. One US study of antimicrobial resistant Salmonella spp. found that those dairy herds with at least one resistant strain of Salmonella isolated from faeces were more likely to be using composted or dried manure as bedding than those with no resistant strains (Habing et al., 2012) .",

On average, freshly separated manure solids did not show elevated levels of these spores, but all composted materials (which in this trial did not include composted RMS) did. The elevated levels in composted bedding were translated to farm bulk milk, with spore concentrations of the mesophilic group being six times higher and the thermophilic group being 100 times higher in milk from farms using composted materials. Although composted RMS was not included in that trial, the implication is that similar patterns would be likely for this material also.

Deep beds per se are likely to improve physical cow comfort, but depth will affect the environment for bacteria. Shallow beds and frequent replacement are likely to give better control of coliforms, particularly Klebsiella spp., than can be achieved in deep beds that are infrequently replenished (Sorter et al., 2014) , but streptococcal counts are likely to be higher in shallow beds Sorter et al., 2014) . Sorter et al. (2014) suggested this might stem from the more frequent addition of material, because initial levels of streptococci were high, although in this trial the effects of bedding depth and frequency of replenishment cannot be separated. Schwarz et al. (2010 Schwarz et al. ( , 2011 compared daily and weekly addition of RMS to deep bedded stalls, on two commercial farms, and found that season had a greater effect on bacterial numbers than frequency of bedding; the authors concluded that daily bedding did not necessarily improve bacterial levels, milk quality or mastitis, compared with weekly bedding.",

Effects are usually short-lived, in the range of 24-48 h (Hippen et al., 2007) . Hogan et al.

Specifically for 'raw' RMS, these authors reported that, although both acid and alkali conditioners reduced bacterial populations in unused material, only the alkali conditioner and hydrated lime inhibited bacteria in used bedding, and only for 1 day; use of an acid conditioner had little effect on bacteria in bedding. Sharkey et al. (2011) reported a more rapid and greater decline in Klebsiella counts in composted RMS stored in a pile, as a result of application of a proprietary conditioner (SOP-C COW), but there was no effect on streptococci. Feiken and van Laarhoven (2012) added lime and a proprietary alkali to RMS cubicles but found that the resulting pH change was insufficient to reduce most bacteria effectively, although there was a significant reduction in B. cereus with the proprietary conditioner.",

UK farmers also perceive benefits for cow comfort and cleanliness, likely to be dependent on the previous bedding material used for comparison. The literature gives less evidence for the scale of absolute welfare benefits but there are definitely advantages of comfort compared with abrasive materials on mattresses. There are challenges and risks associated with the practice, not least in view of the dearth of information on many of the long term implications. Anecdotal reports of difficulties of maintaining udder health on RMS exist, but no large scale, long term studies of effects on clinical and subclinical mastitis have been published; nor is there any information on clinical implications for other diseases. Very little is known about the influence of maintaining the material in a 'closed cycle', the effects of its use on pathogen virulence and antimicrobial resistance, or the risk of airborne pathogens arising from it. Should farmers choose to adopt RMS bedding, they are advised to do so with caution, apply the required strategies for risk mitigation, maintain strict hygiene of bed management and milking practices and monitor the effects on herd health closely.",
