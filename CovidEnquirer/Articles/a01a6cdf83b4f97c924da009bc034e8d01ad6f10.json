The plasmid pEGFP-optS, which contains the codon-optimized SARS-CoV S gene and expresses spike-EGFP fusion protein (S-EGFP) as silencing target and expressing reporter, was transfected with siRNAs into HEK 293T cells. At various time points of posttransfection, the levels of S-EGFP expression and amounts of spike mRNA transcript were detected by fluorescence microscopy, flow cytometry, Western blot, and real-time quantitative PCR, respectively. The results showed that the cells transfected with pEGFP-optS expressed S-EGFP fusion protein at a higher level compared with those transfected with pEGFP-S, which contains wildtype SARS-CoV spike gene sequence. The green fluorescence, mean fluorescence intensity, and SARS-CoV S RNA transcripts were found significantly reduced, and the expression of SARS-CoV S glycoprotein was strongly inhibited in those cells co-transfected with either EGFP-or S-specific siRNAs. Our findings demonstrated that the S-specific siRNAs used in this study were able to specifically and effectively inhibit SARS-CoV S glycoprotein expression in cultured cells through blocking the accumulation of S mRNA, which may provide an approach for studies on the functions of SARS-CoV S gene and development of novel prophylactic or therapeutic agents for SARS-CoV.",

The recently identified severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) has been proved as a new group of coronaviruses [1] [2] [3] , which consists of four major structural proteins: spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M), and nucleocapsid (N). The S protein, with 1255 amino acids in size, is a surface glycoprotein and contains signal peptide at the N-terminus (residues 1-13), a large amino-terminal ectodomain (residues , and a short carboxy-terminal endodomain bridged with a transmembrane domain (residues 1196-1255). There is only 20-27% amino acid identity between SARS-CoV S protein and other coronavirus family members [3, 4] . Similar to other coronaviruses, SARS-CoV S glycoprotein contains two non-covalently associated subunits (S1 and S2) functionally. It is believed that binding of S1 subunit to its cellular receptor induces conformational changes in S2, leading to the fusion between viral and cellular membranes, and viral entry [5] . In addition, SARS-CoV S glycoprotein has been proved an important antigen and is able to induce the generation of neutralizing antibody [6] .",

RNAi is becoming a powerful tool to investigate gene function through specific suppression of a particular mRNA and has been employed in therapeutic studies of human diseases including cancer, neurogenerative diseases, and viral infectious diseases [14, 15] . Recently, it has also been used in the study of SARS-CoV [16] . To explore the possibility of silencing SARS-CoV S gene by RNAi technique, we cloned and expressed SARS-CoV spike gene, which encodes N-terminal amino acid residues 1-690 and contains the identified receptor-binding domain (RBD). The in vitro transcribed siRNAs were then introduced into HEK 293T cells expressing SARS-CoV S glycoprotein. Our results demonstrated that the codon-optimized spike gene obviously improved S glycoprotein expression in cultured cells. The specific siRNAs corresponding to SARS-CoV spike gene specifically degraded S mRNA and significantly inhibited S glycoprotein expression.",

The resulting plasmid was named pEGFP-S, in which enhanced green fluorescence protein (EGFP) gene was located downstream of S gene. Identity of S gene to the published sequence (GenBank Accession No. AY278554) was confirmed by sequencing (Bioasia, Shanghai).

All sequences of the siRNAs were BLAST searched in the National Center for Biotechnology Information\u00d5s (NCBI) ''search for short nearly exact matches'' mode against all human sequences deposited in the GenBank and RefSeq databases, and were not found to have significant homology to genes other than the targets. The template deoxynucleotides (Table 1 ) used for siRNA transcription were synthesized by Bioasia, Shanghai. The oligonucleotide directed production of siRNAs with T7 RNA polymerase has been described previously [18] . For each transcription reaction, 300 lM of each oligonucleotide template and T7 promoter primer were mixed and denaturalized by heating at 95\u00b0C for 2 min. The mixture was then added with 10\u00b7 Klenow reaction buffer, dNTP mix (Promega, USA), Exo-Klenow (TaKaRa, Dalian), and nuclease-free water, and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 30 min.

After incubation at 37\u00b0C for 2 h, sense and antisense RNAs generated in separate reactions were annealed by mixing both crude transcription reactions and incubating at 37\u00b0C overnight. The concentration of the generated dsRNA was measured by the absorbance at 260 nm in a BioPhotometer (Eppendorf, Germany). S1 nuclease and RNase-free DNase I (TaKaRa, Dalian) were added to final concentrations of 10 and 1 U/lg siRNA, respectively, for the digestion of ssRNA and dsDNA.

At 48 h after the transfection, very mild fluorescence was detected in the pEGFP-S transfected HEK 293T cells, while strong fluorescence was observed in the pEGFP-optS transfected cells (Fig. 1A) , which was repeated at least three times but similar results were obtained. To determine the levels of S-EGFP fusion protein expressed in transfected cells, we used convalescent SARS patient sera to detect the fusion protein but obtained very faint bands (data not shown). Therefore, we alternatively employed anti-GFP monoclonal antibody to detect it. Western blot analysis of the cell lysates showed that the S-EGFP fusion protein was expressed at high level in pEGFP-optS transfected cells but at low level in pEGFP-S transfected cells (Fig. 1B) . However, the molecular weight of expressed S-EGFP is larger than the predicted one (about 82 kDa) based on amino acid composition. This may represent glycosylated protein which resulted from posttranslational modification by the eukaryotic expression system. The only difference between the two plasmids was that the plasmid pEGFP-optS contained codon-optimized spike gene utilizing mammalian preferred codons. The data indicated that replacement of codons in the spike gene with those frequently used in mammalian increased S-EGFP fusion protein expression in cultured cells, supporting the hypothesis that the observed differences in efficiency of expression of modified and unmodified spike genes were related to codon usage and GC content, as shown in other studies [21, 22] . The underlying mechanisms remain to be elucidated but it is possible that partial optimized codon contained in the spike gene could much more efficiently initiate gene transcription and improve efficiency of gene translation.",

The data above suggested that the effect of gene silencing induced by siRNA should be sequence specific and entire open reading frame (ORF) based. The siRNAs transcribed in vitro can effectively down-regulate SARS-CoV S RNA levels in either EGFP-or S-specific siRNA transfected HEK 293T cells, corresponding to the reported mechanism that siRNAs degraded target mRNA at RNA level instead of at DNA level.",

Recently, the angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2) was identified as a functional receptor for SARS-CoV [35] and its binding site on the SARS-CoV S glycoprotein was localized between amino acid residues 303 and 537 [36] . Therefore, to block the combination of S glycoprotein with receptor efficiently is crucial to prevent the virus infection. As a cellular defense mechanism, RNAi has been employed in anti-virus infections in viruses such as human immunodeficiency virus and hepatitis C/B virus [37] and inhi-bition of viral replication in host cells [38] . Zhang et al. [16] introduced vector-mediated RNAi technology into the study of SARS-CoV infection, and found that the siRNAs generated from the DNA vector blocked the expression of SARS-CoV S gene and inhibited the replication of SARS-CoV in the infected cells. Their work enlightened us to explore the possibility of silencing SARS-CoV S glycoprotein expression by siRNA transcribed in vitro by T7 RNA polymerase and blocking its combination with cell surface receptor.",
