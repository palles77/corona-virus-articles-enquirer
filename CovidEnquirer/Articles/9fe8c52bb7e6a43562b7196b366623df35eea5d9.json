            "text": "Human enterovirus (EV) belongs to the picornavirus family, which consists of over 200 medically relevant viruses. A peptidomimetic inhibitor AG7088 was developed to inhibit the 3C protease of rhinovirus (a member of the family), a chymotrypsin-like protease required for viral replication, by forming a covalent bond with the active site Cys residue. In this study, we have prepared the recombinant 3C protease from EV71 (TW/2231/98), a particular strain which causes severe outbreaks in Asia, and developed inhibitors against the protease and the viral replication. For inhibitor design, the P3 group of AG7088, which is not interacting with the rhinovirus protease, was replaced with a series of cinnamoyl derivatives directly linked to P2 group through an amide bond to simplify the synthesis. While the replacement caused decreased potency, the activity can be largely improved by substituting the a,b-unsaturated ester with an aldehyde at the P1 0 position. The best inhibitor 10b showed EC 50 of 18 nM without apparent toxicity (CC 50 > 25 lM). Our study provides potent inhibitors of the EV71 3C protease as anti-EV71 agents and facilitates the combinatorial synthesis of derivatives for further improving the inhibitory activity.",

            "text": "Enterovirus (EV), a member of Picornaviridae family, is a primary causative agent of hand, foot, and mouth diseases in humans and animals. 1 In severe cases, EV can damage the central nervous systems leading to viral meningitis, encephalitis, and severe myocarditis, as well as fatal pulmonary edema. [2] [3] [4] Children are particularly vulnerable due to their relative immunodeficiency. 5, 6 There are over 5 billion cases of EV infections annually worldwide and several outbreaks have been reported. [7] [8] [9] In 1998, a severe outbreak by the EV71 (TW/2231/98) occurred in Taiwan causing about 120,000 cases of infection in children and 78 deaths. 10, 11 Since then, a steady number of cases caused by this particular EV strain have been reported annually. In May 2008, Chinese health authorities reported a major outbreak of EV71 in Anhui province of China, which has led to 28 deaths as of May 7. To date, no effective anti-viral therapy for the diseases caused by EV is available. Like other picornaviruses such as polioviruses, rhinoviruses (RV), coxsackieviruses, and hepatitis A viruses, a virally encoded chymotrypsin-like protease (3C protease) is required for the proteolytic processing of the large polyproteins translated from the viral RNA genomes and thus essential for viral replication. 12, 13 The RV 3C protease was used as a target to develop inhibitor AG7088, aiming to treat the common cold. [14] [15] [16] This peptidomimetic inhibitor (see below for structure) contains a lactam ring to mimic Gln at the P1 position, fluoro-phenylalanine at P2, Val at P3 followed by 5-methyl-3-isoxazole, and an a,b-unsaturated ester at P1 0 as a Michael acceptor to form a covalent bond with the active site Cys residue. 17, 18 Recent research has shown that AG7088 is effective against EV6 and EV9 with EC 50 of 43 and 15 nM, respectively, likely due to the structural similarity of their 3C proteases judging from their sequence homology. 19 This provides a starting point for developing potent inhibitors against EV71.",

The kinetic constants for the fluorogenic peptide were measured in 10 mM MES at pH 6.5 (the optimal pH for EV71 3C protease) at 25\u00b0C. Enhanced fluorescence due to the cleavage of the peptide was monitored at 538 nm with excitation at 355 nm using a fluorescence plate reader (Fluoroskan Ascent from ThermoLabsystems, Finland). The enzyme concentration used in measuring K m and k cat values was 0.5 lM and the substrate concentrations were from 0.5to 5-fold of an estimated K m value. Substrate concentration was determined by using the extinction coefficients 5438 M \u00c01 cm \u00c01 at 336 nm (Edans) or 15,100 M \u00c01 cm \u00c01 at 472 nm (Dabcyl).

The data were consistent with the EC 50 . Compound 10e showed the smallest EC 50 of 7 nM with toxicity CC 50 of 5 lM, giving the selective index (CC 50 /EC 50 ) of 714.Compound 8 with a more flexible Cbz group also showed potent anti-viral activity (EC 50 = 0.031 lM) but slight toxicity (CC 50 = 24 lM). Compound 10f containing 5-methyl-3-isoxazole showed less inhibitory activity (EC 50 = 0.94 lM) in the anti-viral assay, indicating importance of the benzene ring in inhibiting the virus. In the enzymatic assay, these compounds including 10f inhibited the protease potently, so their K i could not be accurately deter-mined under the assay condition as limited by the 0.5 lM enzyme used to detect the activity. When aldehyde at the P1 0 position of 10b was replaced with CH 2 OH or CO 2 Me, the IC 50 values became 40 and 50 lM, respectively, and EC 50 > 25 lM (data not shown), indicating the requirement of aldehyde in inhibiting the 3C protease.",
