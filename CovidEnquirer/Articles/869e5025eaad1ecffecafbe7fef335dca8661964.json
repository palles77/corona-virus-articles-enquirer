However, its use in humid wet markets has never been examined. A gas-fired desiccant cooling system has been installed in a wet market in Hong Kong. In this study, the annual energy saving in conjunction with the use of desiccant cooling system was investigated by in-situ measurements, site surveys and simulations. The verified computer model was used for further simulations. It was found that for the use of a minimum ventilation rate of 10.3 L/s/person, the use of desiccant cooling system as compared to conventional system saved 4% of the energy and could achieve the desired space conditions. A parametric study under various ventilation rates indicated that use of desiccant cooling system in wet markets in hot and humid Hong Kong would lead to energy and energy cost savings, as well as CO 2 emission reduction amounting from 1% to 13%. The savings were more evident when wet markets were designed for a ventilation rate of 20 L/s/person. Furthermore, the actual occupancy profile, and lighting and small power densities determined in this study would be useful for future studies on wet market.",

As such, the desired space relative humidity can only be achieved by matching the equipment (sensible heat ratio) SHR with the building SHR, but a perfect match rarely happens. This divergence leads to excessive cooling which increases energy use, and moisture problems which accelerate microbial growth, particularly for subtropical climates like Hong Kong with very humid outdoor air.",

Recent studies on desiccant cooling system have been done on optimizing the operating variables for better energy performance [4e7]; developing empirical model for investigation of the system performance [8] ; improving the control and operation by experimental studies [9, 10] ; and widening the application to different types of buildings [11e14] . However, it is noted that they are either restricted to applications where ventilation requirements are set to remove heat generated by people, lighting and equipment, or where moisture removal is not a design intent [13, 14] . As for applications where ventilation requirements are set for moisture and contaminates removal, little has been found in extant literature.",

It is a typical wet market in Hong Kong which sells all sorts of fresh produce and live seafood and poultry. The desiccant cooling system installed in this market consists of two parallel systems: a dehumidification system comprises of three units of gas-fired desiccant dehumidifiers installed on the roof dedicated to dehumidify OA, and a chilled water system. The chilled water system is not different from a conventional air-conditioning system which consists of two chillers each of 915 kW cooling capacity and the associated circulation pumps. The capacity is sufficient to cover the sensible and latent loads of the three air-handlers for treatment of mixed air with and without the operation of the desiccant dehumidifiers. This serves as a standby provision to ensure relative humidity of the wet market can always be met. To satisfy the minimum ventilation requirement for non-domestic buildings in Hong Kong [17] , the market is designed for a ventilation rate of 5 air change per hour (ACH).",

However, the rate of rise for the conventional system was higher than that of the desiccant cooling system when the ventilation rate was increased from 10 L/s/person to 20 L/s/person. The results indicate that at a ventilation rate of 20 L/s per person, energy saving of 8% can be achieved by the use of desiccant cooling system. The significant saving can be explained by the fact that the increase in ventilation rate can offset part of the space cooling load in mild season, but further increase in ventilation rate leads to a sharp increase in space cooling load as shown in Fig. 8 .",

In-situ measurements provided the actual energy use data for comparison with simulated results and for simulation validation.

The study results revealed that use of desiccant cooling system in wet markets in hot and humid Hong Kong would lead to energy, energy cost and CO 2 emission reduction up to 13% when the ventilation rate is 20 L/s/person.
