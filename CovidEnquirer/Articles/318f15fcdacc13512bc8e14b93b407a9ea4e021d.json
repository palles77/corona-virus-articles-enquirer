Transfusion-related fatalities caused by infections continue to be reported, and blood is not tested for many potentially dangerous pathogens. The current paradigm for increasing the safety of the blood supply is the development and implementation of laboratory screening methods and restrictive donor criteria. When considering the large number of known pathogens and the fact that pathogens continue to emerge, it is clear that the utility of new tests and donor restrictions will continue to be a challenge when considering the cost of developing and implementing new screening assays, the loss of potential donors, and the risk of testing errors. Despite improving the safety of blood components, testing remains a reactive approach to blood safety. The contaminating organisms must be identified before sensitive tests can be developed. In contrast, pathogen inactivation is a proactive strategy designed to inactivate a pathogen before it enters the blood supply. Almost all pathogen inactivation technologies target nucleic acids, allowing for the inactivation of a variety of nucleic acid-containing pathogens within plasma, platelets, or red blood cells thus providing the potential to reduce transfusion-transmitted diseases. However, widespread use of a pathogen inactivation technology can only be realized when proven safe and efficacious and not cost-prohibitive.",

In addition, the emergence of new agents such as West Nile virus (WNV) demonstrates that potential threats to the blood supply continue to emerge worldwide.

However, each of these interventions had a substantial delay before implementation. The blood banking system is already heavily burdened with multiple testing steps and stringent donor screening (Fig 2) . In the United States, blood is tested for antibodies to HIV-1/2, human T-lymphotrophic virus (HTLV)-I/II, HBV, HCV, and Treponema pallidum, the spirochete that causes syphilis. Testing is also performed for the presence of hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) and for HIV-1, HCV, and WNV nucleic acids (implemented under investigational new drug application process). 3 Furthermore, it is likely that nucleic acid testing (NAT) for HBV, hepatitis A virus, and parvovirus B19 nucleic acids will be added to the requirements over the next several years. [4] [5] [6] Moreover, the American Association of Blood Banks (AABB) recently issued a requirement for accreditation in 2003 mandating the testing of platelet components for bacterial contamination. 3 Although it is clear that there is a continual need to develop new technology to protect the safety of the blood supply, it is also clear that adding new tests and/or donor restrictions for each known and emerging pathogen is not feasible. Pathogen inactivation may be a promising alternative to expanded testing and donor deferrals. Such a technology, before its introduction, must be proven safe and efficacious and not be cost-prohibitive.",

Other factors that contribute to the emergence of new pathogens include changing human demographics, evolving effects of new technology and industries, econom- ic development and land use, international travel and commerce, and microbial adaptation and change (Table 1) . 8 Changes in technology and industry practices can contribute to the emergence of pathogens that are resistant to treatment. For example, the overprescription of antibiotics and their widespread use in livestock, soaps, and household cleaners can contribute to the resistance of many strains of bacteria. Human demographics, economic development and land use, international travel and commerce, and the breakdown of public health measures can result in the increase and spread of vectors, such as mosquitoes and ticks, which carry pathogens, as well as the spread of pathogens through human-to-human contact. In addition, pathogens that are not problematic in one country can become problematic when brought to another country. Pathogen adaptation and change can make testing less efficient because of genetic changes often related to antivirals, antibiotics, vaccines, and passive immunotherapy that put pressure on pathogens to escape through mutations. Because of the number of factors that can affect the patterns of pathogen emergence and the complexities of each, it is impossible to predict the next emerging pathogen or epidemic. An example of this lack of predictability is the recent worldwide severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) epidemic.",

There are at least 35 arboviruses, including the Flaviviruses WNV, DEN-1 to DEN-4, and close relatives of WNV such as St Louis encephalitis virus, western equine encephalitis virus, and eastern equine encephalitis virus. 9, 10 All have the potential to become a threat to the blood supply if optimal conditions are present. Infection with arboviruses is often asymptomatic but can result in encephalitis and, in some cases, death. 9 Encephalitis can have severe sequelae, such as neurological complications. Arboviruses pose a particular threat to the blood supply because most of arbovirus infections are asymptomatic. Asymptomatic infections in donors can result in transmission to recipients because viremia precedes clinical disease and antibody production, and most of infectious donors could donate without being detected. 10 The WNV epidemic in the United States demonstrated that an arbovirus infection could emerge at any time and pose a significant threat to blood transfusion safety. The WNV epidemic that has established itself in the United States appears to have originated from an Egyptian strain of the virus. In 2002, there was a large increase in reported numbers of human WNV infection in North America, compared with previous years, with 4156 cases reported in the United States 11 and 325 cases in Canada. 12 In this same year, it was recognized that WNV could be transmitted through blood transfusion. 13 Twenty-three confirmed cases of transfusion-transmitted WNV were reported in 2002 (transmitted via red blood cells [RBCs], platelets, and plasma). 14 In November 2002, the blood bank industry met to address the problem of transfusion-transmitted WNV, and by July 1, 2003, routine NAT was implemented under the investigational new drug application process.",

These Flaviviruses are another example of arboviruses that can threaten the safety of the blood supply. Dengue is reaching epidemic proportions in Asia and South America, and because of international travel, dengue has the potential to become an epidemic in the United States. 15 Two cases of transfusion transmission of dengue through RBCs have been reported in Hong Kong. 16 The hepatitis viruses are other examples of emerging viral pathogens. These viruses can cause liver disease that can result in cirrhosis of the liver and hepatocellular carcinoma. 17 Several types of hepatitis viruses, A to E, have been identified. 17 Hepatitis B and C can be readily transmitted by blood transfusion, and hepatitis A and E are rarely transmitted by transfusion. Although several hepatitis viruses have been identified, there is still a modest proportion of hepatitis that cannot be attributed to these known viruses. Hepatitis G virus and the TT virus (TTV) were candidates for non-A to E hepatitis, but extensive study failed to demonstrate that these agents were causative of posttransfusion hepatitis or any other disease. SEN viruses, a variant of TTV, may cause some posttransfusion hepatitis. 18 SEN viruses have been shown to be prevalent in the donor pool, but a clear correlation between these viruses and hepatitis has not been shown. Transmission of viral hepatitis, particularly HBV and HCV, from blood donors to recipients through the transfusion of blood components and plasma derivatives has been well documented. 19 The transfusion transmission of HBV and HCV has been dramatically reduced because of testing, but this has highlighted the residual risk of transfusion-transmitted hepatitis and the possible emergence of undiscovered hepatitis viruses. 19 Human parvovirus B19 is a nonenveloped single-stranded DNA virus that is transmitted by blood. 20 Infection is generally thought to be benign for people who are immunocompetent, but B19 can cause erythema infectiosum, arthralgia, aplastic crisis in patients with RBC defects, chronic anemia in immunocompromised patients, and fetal hydrops. 21 Transfusion transmission of B19 has been reported primarily in recipients of plasma derivatives and in recipients of clotting factor concentrates manufactured from large plasma pools, but rare incidents of transmission via other blood components have also been reported. 22, 23 Another example of a previously completely unknown virus that has recently emerged as a threat is the coronavirus that causes SARS. 3 This virus was transmitted from animal to human beings in a region in China and then spread globally because of international travel. About 8000 cases of SARS were reported in 2003, and an estimated 700 deaths were attributed to SARS. 24 Severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreaks were reported primarily in the Hong Kong Special Administrative Region, People's Republic of China, Taiwan, Singapore, Canada, Vietnam, and the United States, but smaller outbreaks have been reported in several other countries, including Australia, France, Germany, the Philippines, and Thailand. 25 There has been no evidence of transfusion-transmitted SARS infection, but the virus is present in the blood of affected individuals, which could allow for transmission via transfusion of blood components. 3 Avian influenza is another emerging pathogen that has recently received considerable media attention. Avian influenza is a contagious disease caused by viruses that normally infect only birds and, less commonly, pigs. 26 When it crosses the species barrier and infects human beings, it can cause severe disease with high mortality. Since mid-December 2003, a growing number of Asian countries have reported outbreaks of avian influenza in chickens and ducks. A highly pathogenic strain known as H5N1 has been identified as the cause of most of the outbreaks. Outbreaks have been reported in Vietnam and Thailand. 27,28 It is not yet known if avian influenza is transmissible by transfusion.",

Serological testing for viral antigens or antibodies has been the standard for the detection of most infectious disease agents in the blood supply since the identification of HBsAg in 1971. 29 Today, blood is routinely screened for antibodies to HIV-1/2, HTLV-II/II, HBV, and HCV and for the presence of HBsAg and, in some countries, HIV p24 antigen. Although serology tests are effective and resulted in decreased risk of HIV and hepatitis B and C transfusion-transmitted infections, the presence of a bwindow period,Q the period between infection and appearance of a detectable antigen or host antibody, necessitated the development of NAT. 4 Nucleic acid testing for HIV and HCV has decreased the risk of transfusion transmitted infection with these agents from 1 in 1 468 000 to 1 in 2 135 000 donations for HIV and from 1 in 276 000 to 1 in 1 935 000 donations for HCV (Fig 1) . 30 Although the risk of transfusion transmission of HIV, HCV, and HBV has been greatly reduced by serological testing and NAT, breakthrough infections still occur. One case of breakthrough transmission of HIV was reported in Singapore 1 and 3 cases by the American Red Cross. 31,32 One case of transfusion transmission of HCV has been reported. 33 Breakthrough cases may be caused by viremia that is below the NAT sensitivity cutoff. For logistical and cost reasons, NAT is currently performed on minipools of plasma from 16 to 24 donations. 4 Dilution of donor plasma in pools decreases the sensitivity of testing; however, single-donor testing is not cost-effective. Nucleic acid testing reduces the window period of these viruses but does not eliminate it. 4 There is pressure to do single-unit NAT, but many feel that singleunit NAT is not feasible unless automation is available and multiple pathogens can be detected with a single NAT.",

This, in combination with the biologic composition of platelets and their media, creates an ideal growth environment for bacteria. From 1983 to 2001, the risk of infection with HIV, HBV, and HCV per unit of platelets transfused has dramatically decreased. In contrast, the risk of transfusion-associated bacteremia has not changed during this same period (Fig 1) . The risk of infection from bacterial contamination exceeds that from viral agents. Based on United States and European studies, the overall risk of contamination is similar in RBCs and in platelets, but because of the refrigerated storage, most bacteria will not proliferate in RBCs. The prevalence of bacterial contamination of platelets is approximately 1/2000 to 1/3000 U, whereas the highest reported risk of Yersinia contamination of RBCs leading to symptoms has been approximately 1 per 40 000. 38, 39 In most countries, the incidence of severe septic episodes, leading to significant recipient morbidity and mortality, caused by the transfusion of contaminated blood products is not clearly established but may be as high as 1/50 000 U of apheresis platelets (higher for pooled platelets) and 1/500 000 U of RBCs transfused. 38, 39 Agents. The organisms that cause bacterial contamination of blood components include skin flora (the most common), enteric flora, and environmental flora. Contamination may occur because of asymptomatic donor bacteremia (rarely), during collection, or because of a faulty collection pack (leaky seal, damaged tubing, or micropuncture). The predominant organisms isolated from contaminated platelet units are skin commensals such as coagulase-negative staphylococci. Identified species include streptococci, Staphylococcus epidermidis, Bacillus cereus, Staphylococcus aureus, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Serratia marcescens, and Serratia liquefaciens. 40 Anaerobic bacteria, including Clostridium perfringens and Propionibacterium acnes, have also been isolated; however, the significance of anaerobic infection in the context of platelet transfusion is not known. 41 Red blood cells associated with sepsis are usually contaminated with Enterobacteriaceae that will grow at refrigerator temperature; Yersinia enterocolitica and S liquefaciens are the 2 species of bacteria that are most commonly detected in RBCs.",

            "text": "Agents. The 3 parasitic agents thought to constitute the greatest threat to the blood supply are the protozoans Trypanosoma cruzi, Plasmodium spp, and Babesia spp. 60 Trypanosoma cruzi, the etiological agent of Chagas disease, is a small protozoan parasite primarily found in Latin America. This agent represents an emerging infection in the United States and Canada because of infected immigrants. 60 Effective treatment is unavailable for infection with T cruzi. Clinical manifestations include potentially fatal cardiac and gastrointestinal disease. Signs and symptoms usually do not develop until several years or decades after infection. The incidence of T cruzi has increased in the United States and Canada in the last 30 years because of the emigration of infected and often asymptomatic people from T cruzi-endemic countries. 61 During the last 16 years, 7 cases of transfusiontransmitted T cruzi have been reported in the United States (5 cases) and Canada (2 cases). [62] [63] [64] [65] [66] Transmission occurred in some cases via platelets, and in others, the component could not be identified because the patient received multiple blood components and a donor could not be identified. Because studies demonstrate increasing numbers of seroprevalent donors and because Chagas disease is difficult to recognize, the reported incidence is thought to be an underestimate. A multiyear epidemiological study of T cruzi in Los Angeles blood donors demonstrated that seroprevalence rates in high-risk populations (comprised of people who were born in or who had spent a significant amount of time in a T cruziendemic country) increased significantly from 1996 to 1998. 67 It has been estimated that 1 in 25 000 US blood donors are positive for T cruzi antibodies, and studies suggest that 63% of blood donors with antibodies to T cruzi have evidence of active parasitemia in their peripheral blood. 67, 68 Plasmodium is the etiological agent of human malaria. Four species of Plasmodium, Plasmodium falciparum, Plasmodium vivax, Plasmodium malariae, and Plasmodium ovale, are known to cause human malaria. Malaria is a mosquito-borne intracellular parasite of RBCs and liver cells that causes flulike symptoms with periodic episodes of fever and chills related to massive hemolysis of infected erythrocytes. In endemic areas, malaria is the main indication for transfusion and is a significant cause of morbidity in young children. Human malaria is found primarily in tropical and subtropical regions; however, approximately 1 to 2 cases of transfusion-acquired malaria are reported in the United States annually. 69 Transfusion transmission is primarily via RBCs, but platelets have also been implicated, probably because of the presence of RBCs in platelet concentrates. The immigration of infected individuals who spread the parasite when bitten by local mosquitoes and a phenomenon called bairport malaria,Q in which infected mosquitoes ride with airplanes and cause infections near airports, have contributed to the emergence of Plasmodium as a threat to the blood supply. [70] [71] [72] Babesia microti is one of the agents that cause zoonotic babesiosis-a mild self-limiting disease that causes flulike symptoms. A number of new divergent strains of Babesia, including WA-1, CA-1, and MO-1 (named after the states in which they were found), have recently been identified. Babesia are intracellular pathogens of RBCs and are transmitted by deer ticks. Human babesiosis has been reported primarily in North America and Europe, but cases have also occurred in Latin America, Africa, and Southeast Asia. 69 Infection can be treated with common antibiotics; however, it can be fatal in the elderly, immunocompromised, or asplenic individuals.",

Blood in the United States and Canada is not screened for this parasite because licensed screening assays are unavailable. At a September 2002 meeting of the US Food and Drug Administration Blood Product Advisory Committee, the Food and Drug Administration issued a request for manufacturers to develop and submit for approval antibody screening tests for T cruzi. Nucleic acid testing for T cruzi is only costeffective in areas in which it is highly endemic. 60 Travel histories have generally been effective at preventing the transmission of malaria; however, questions are often misinterpreted by blood donors. 60 In addition, travel histories needlessly defer thousands of blood donors who are unlikely to be infected with malaria and who, in most cases, never return as active donors after their deferral. 60 Most cases of transfusion transmission of malaria come from donors who have been infected with Plasmodium in their home country and not from travel, and many donors are excluded unnecessarily. For some countries, serological and NAT testing for malaria may be useful for increasing the number of potential blood donors.",

It is a proactive effective way to protect the blood supply from most known and emerging pathogens. The goal of pathogen inactivation is to increase the safety of the blood supply by targeting all pathogens, without compromising therapeutic efficacy of the blood product or causing adverse effects in the recipient. 83 Two methods for the inactivation of pathogens during the preparation of fresh frozen plasma (FFP) and 1 method for the preparation of platelet concentrates have been introduced into clinical practice in the United States or Europe, and 2 others are in phase 3 clinical development (Table 2) . 84, 85 Amotosalen Amotosalen hydrochloride (S-59) intercalates between nucleic acid bases and, upon activation by UV-A light, forms covalent additions (monoadducts and diadducts) to pyrimidine bases in both DNA and RNA. 86 These adducts then form interstrand or intrastrand cross-links within the genetic material, which block the replication and transcription machinery and cause cell death. Photochemical treatment of apheresis and pooled buffy coat platelets with amotosalen plus UV-A light has been shown to inactivate a broad range of viruses, bacteria, and protozoa.

Compound absorption devices or washing procedures are used to remove or substantially reduce the quantity of the residual compounds before transfusion to provide the highest possible safety margins. Despite reduction in the level of residual compounds, traces of the compounds remain in the treated product; this raises concerns on the potential long-term toxicity to recipients, processing personnel, and environment. Therefore, to obtain regulatory approval and licensure of a pathogen inactivation system, each method/compound needs to be examined independently. For example, the amotosalen system for platelets was evaluated in a comprehensive toxicology program, including a carcinogenicity study in animals, in conformance of that required for approval of a pharmaceutical. There were no toxicological relevant findings in any tissues or organs found. Multiple phase III clinical trials as well as postmarketing phase IV experience on INTERCEPT platelets further provided the efficacy and safety data for the pathogen inactivation process. 94, 96 There are limited data on cost-effectiveness of the pathogen inactivation systems. The economics of an intervention, such as pathogen inactivation, can be evaluated in 2 ways: by the direct net cost consequences and by the more traditional costeffectiveness analysis. 128 Net cost analysis assesses the direct cost on the blood center for adoption of a new intervention. For example, pathogen inactivation offers the potential to avoid other costs such as bacterial testing, c-irradiation for leukocyte inactivation, and CMV serological testing, thus directly impacting the net cost of the new technology. Traditional cost-effectiveness analysis generally uses a quality-adjusted life-year threshold of US$100 000 to discriminate costeffective from cost-ineffective interventions. 128 However, blood safety interventions, such as NAT, with higher quality-adjusted life-year thresholds have been adopted. From a practical standpoint, the cost and logistics of implementing pathogen inactivation systems need to be considered, but in the long run, pathogen inactivation systems offer a potential insurance against the threat of emerging pathogens.",

This approach has led to significant advances in the safety of the blood supply with respect to certain pathogens, including HIV, HCV, and HBV. However, the blood supply continues to be vulnerable. For example, the bacterial contamination of platelets remains the number one microbiological cause of transfusion-related mortality worldwide and is responsible for many deaths each year.",

The list of viral, parasitic, and bacterial pathogens that could potentially threaten the blood supply is long and continues to grow ( Table 6 ). As was illustrated with HIV, WNV, and SARS, a new pathogen can emerge rapidly, spread globally, and possibly cause serious morbidity and mortality to recipients of infected blood products. Although testing has been successful in reducing the risk of infection with a few high-profile viruses, it remains a reactive strategy, and continuing to add tests for each of the many known and yet to be identified pathogens will continue to be a challenge when considering the cost of developing and implementing new screening assays and the risk of testing errors. Furthermore, increasingly stringent donor criteria often result in the unnecessary loss of many viable donors. Additional measures including pathogen inactivation have been proposed as alternate approaches to reducing the risk of transfusiontransmitted infection.",

This report reviewed the efficacy of several pathogen inactivation systems for use in FFP, platelets, or RBCs currently in various stages of clinical development. Preclinical studies have demonstrated that pathogen inactivation technology can target a broad range of nucleic acidcontaining pathogens while maintaining the in vitro function of treated plasma and platelets. The availability of these systems, once proven safe and efficacious, and implementation worldwide will have the potential to significantly impact the safety of blood supply. ",
