            "text": "There is a global need to elucidate protective antigens expressed by the SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Monoclonal antibody reagents that recognise specific antigens on SARS-CoV are needed urgently. In this report, the development and immunochemical characterisation of a panel of murine monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) against the SARS-CoV is presented, based upon their specificity, binding requirements, and biological activity. Initial screening by ELISA, using highly purified virus as the coating antigen, resulted in the selection of 103 mAbs to the SARS virus. Subsequent screening steps reduced this panel to seventeen IgG mAbs. A single mAb, F26G15, is specific for the nucleoprotein as seen in Western immunoblot while five other mAbs react with the Spike protein. Two of these Spike-specific mAbs demonstrate the ability to neutralise SARS-CoV in vitro while another four Western immunoblot-negative mAbs also neutralise the virus. The utility of these mAbs for diagnostic development is demonstrated. Antibody from convalescent SARS patients, but not normal human serum, is also shown to specifically compete off binding of mAbs to whole SARS-CoV. These studies highlight the importance of using standardised assays and reagents. These mAbs will be useful for the development of diagnostic tests, studies of SARS-CoV pathogenesis and vaccine development.",

This virus caused nearly 800 deaths and infected more than 8000 people in various affected countries throughout the world (Stadler et al., 2003) . The SARS-coronavirus Spike protein has only 20-27% pairwise identity at the amino acid level to the Spike proteins of other previously characterised coronaviruses. Recently, the genomes of SARS-CoV isolates, implicated in the 2003 Toronto outbreak, were sequenced in their entirety (Marra et al., 2003; Rota et al., 2003) . The production of mAbs to the SARS-CoV virus is critical for diagnostic development, vaccine research and studies of viral pathogenesis. Assays that detect the presence of virally encoded proteins or nucleic acids may be preferable for diagnosis of SARS infections as the development of serum antibodies in infected individuals is quite protracted (Li et al., 2003a) .",

The coronaviruses form a single genus of the family Coronaviridae and the virions are large (80-160 nm in diameter) pleomorphic, but generally spherical, particles. Virions of most coronaviruses contain three major proteins: the phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein (N); a small membrane-embedded glycoprotein (M); and a large club-shaped peplomer glycoprotein (S) which appears in EM micrographs as protruding spikes 20 nm in length. The M protein is synthesised on ribosomes bound to the endoplasmic reticulum and accumulates in the Golgi apparatus. The subcellular localisation of M protein to the Golgi is believed to influence the site of virus budding in the infected cell. The S-protein mediates many of the biological properties of the virus, including attachment to cell receptors, penetration, and cell-fusion, and it is the major target for virus-neutralising antibodies (Collins et al., 1982; Talbot et al., 1984; Wege et al., 1984; Jimenez et al., 1986; Laude et al., 1986; Godet et al., 1994) . A portion of the S glycoprotein that is not incorporated into budding virions is transported to the plasma membrane of the cell where it remains bound to the cell surface (Gerna et al., 1982) .",

Antigenic similarities between various coronaviruses have been demonstrated to reside in the S-protein and have been used to study the evolution of this virus family (Brian et al., 1983) . For most coronaviruses causing enteric and respiratory diseases the pathophysiological events leading to clinical symptoms are due to the acute cytocidal infection of the target cells. These infections can be limited by the local immune response resulting in the production of secretory antibodies specific for the S-protein (Enjuanes et al., 1995) . In contrast, many coronaviruses are maintained and spread in the population as inapparent and subclinical infections. The sequence of events leading to chronic versus acute disease is unknown but likely depends on the expression of viral genes, the functional impairment of host cells, and the interaction with the host immune response.",

Recently the SARS S-protein was shown to be a functional fusogen and is about 180-200 kDa in size (Xiao et al., 2003) . A host cell receptor, angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE-2) was recently identified as a functional receptor for the SARS-CoV, and mediated infection of 293T cells in vitro (Li et al., 2003b) . Therefore, antibody responses to the S-protein may neutralise the infectivity of the SARS-CoV. The immunogenetics of antibody responses to protective epitopes is of particular importance and will lead to a clearer understanding of the nature of protective antibody responses to SARS. Lastly, the production of protective monoclonal antibodies may lead to the development of new recombinant therapeutic antibodies in order to provide rapid protection in SARS patients. In the present work, a description of the development of murine mAbs against the SARS-CoV involved in the Toronto SARS outbreak is presented. The mAbs were analysed for pertinent immunochemical properties and for their ability to neutralise SARS-CoV in vitro.",

The spleen cells were perfused out of the spleen with injections of serum free BD cell Mab Quantum Yield medium (BD-Pharmingen, Oakville, ON). Two identically immunised mouse spleens were used to produce these hybridoma clones. The fusion was performed using the P3X63Ag8.653 myeloma line in log-phase growth.

Interestingly, the majority of the identified mAbs bound to the Spike protein and not the nucleoprotein, despite the strong sero-reactivity of the polyclonal serum of the immunised mice for the nucleoprotein (Fig. 2) . The identity of the target antigen of eleven other mAbs could not be determined by Western immunoblot analysis. This observation suggests that these mAbs likely target conformational epitopes that are sensitive to the conditions employed in such analyses. Work is planned to identify the specific targets of these mAbs. Immuno-dotblot analysis reveals a spectrum of conformational requirements for binding (summarised in Table 1 ). The effects of different denaturing treatments on the binding activity of a subset of neutralising and some non-neutralising mAbs were examined using immuno-dotblot assays on infected lysates compared to uninfected lysates. The series of conditions tested include exposure to heat, detergent, a reducing agent, and combinations thereof. Interestingly, mAb F26G15, which binds to the nucleoprotein in Western immunoblot, does not bind to the SARS-CoV antigen in immuno-dotblot under any of the conditions tested. The inherent charge of the highly phosphorylated nucleoprotein, or of the immobilon membrane used in the assays, may provide an explanation for these results. Immuno-dot blots were not performed with mAbs F26G2, F26G4, F26G12, F26G14, or F26G17, however the binding of these mAbs is considered conformational as they do not bind to SARS-CoV proteins in Western immunoblot (Fig. 2) . The binding of Spike protein specific mAbs F26G1, F26G18, and F26G19 is inhibited in immuno-dotblot assays when antigens are treated with heat plus detergent, or heat plus detergent plus reducing agent. When the immuno-dotblot assay was instead performed using purified virus particles, the result was identical for nucleoprotein specific mAb F26G15, and Spike specific mAbs F26G1, F26G18, and F26G19 (data not shown). Antigen pre-treatment for Western immunoblot, which depends on the application of an electrical current, differs when compared to passive adsorption in ELISA and Immuno-dotblot assays, and clearly do not always correlate with one another. These studies illustrate the need to use multiple assays for epitope characterisation and reveal limitations of current epitope classification schemes.",

While purified virus is clearly the optimal antigen tested in this series of experiments, the lower quality SARS-CoV-infected Vero cell lysates are, however, much easier to prepare for diagnostic assays. Therefore, the limits of mAb binding to SARS-CoV infected Vero cell lysates were further examined via ELISA. The majority of these mAbs exhibit decreased binding when the antigen is heat denatured ( Table 2) . Heat denaturation has very little effect on the binding of non-neutralising mAb F26G16, which also maintains a high level of binding in ELISA using infected Vero cell lysates. F26G16 does, however, show higher background on the irrelevant antigen, BSA, and has inconsistent reactivity in Western immunoblots with heat denatured viral lysate (Fig. 1, Table 1 ). The combination of lower quality antigen in infected Vero cell lysates, along with heat denaturation of the antigens, has a stronger negative effect on binding by the neutralising mAbs compared to non-neutralising mAbs (Table 2) . Indeed, regardless of Western immunoblot reactivity, the non-neutralising clones retain a greater ability to bind heat denatured antigen compared to the neutralising mAbs (lower mean percent reduction in OD per group P < 0.001, Student's t-test, Table 2 ).

These data are consistent with the appearance of coronavirus antigens on the surface of the infected cell during replication (Talbot et al., 1984) , although the fixation process may allow for reactivity of these mAbs with internal antigens as well. The conformational sensitivity of most of the SARS-CoV neutralising mAbs is consistent with properties of neutralising mAbs raised against other enveloped viruses, which generally require more native conformation for binding (Wilson et al., 2000; Zwick et al., 2001) . The immuno-dotblot assays contradict the classification of several putative epitopes as being linear as is suggested by positive Western immunoblot reaction (for example with neutralising mAb F26G18). Indeed, it appears that the strict traditional classification of epitopes as being linear or conformational must account for a broader spectrum of conformational requirements, especially when dealing with antigens of variable quality in different immunological tests. However, in general the neutralising mAbs can be considered to have a higher requirement for correct epitope conformation compared to non-neutralising mAbs in ELISA. It will be important to verify, under optimised conditions (Opstelten et al., 1995) the use of viral lysates designed for maximal recovery of coronavirus proteins, and to this end the production of high quality recombinant protein antigens will provide useful insights. Unfortunately, preparation of highly purified viral antigen requires enormous efforts under bio-containment conditions, which emphasises the need for a quality recombinant antigen assay. Collectively, these data demonstrate that development of mAb-based diagnostic tools for the detection of SARS-CoV infection is well within reach.",

            "text": "The Spike protein of the SARS-CoV is a target of neutralising mAbs. Epitopes on the Spike protein provide neutralising targets on SARS-CoV in vitro, and this is consistent with the Spike being the target of neutralising antibodies for other coronavirus strains (Godet et al., 1994) . Moreover, these mAbs may be useful for the identification of protective epitopes for vaccine formulations (Enjuanes et al., 1995) . Studies are underway to determine the identity of the antigen(s) recognised by the neutralising, Western immunnoblot negative mAbs. Preliminary analysis of the nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences of the cloned V H and V L coding regions of these mAbs suggests that the mAbs are distinct. This observation implies that the hybridoma clones expressing the anti-SARS-CoV neutralising mAbs were derived from individually rearranged and clonally selected B cells in vivo. It also reveals that there is no apparent consensus sequence within the complementarity determining regions that is required for the mAbs to exhibit virus neutralisation activity. This finding makes it feasible to engineer multiple mAbs with high specificity and avidity for various SARS-CoV epitopes for preparations of defined cocktails of therapeutic mAbs. A detailed description of the immunogenetic properties of these mAbs is in preparation (Berry et al., manuscript in preparation) . The NP specific mAb, F26G15, is useful in competitive ELISA with patient sera. This is important as early detection of SARS infections is key to risk management of this disease. This is the first description of neutralising mAbs from a host immunised with whole SARS-CoV and these antibodies should prove useful for the development of new diagnostic tests, studies of antigenic variation, and vaccine development in the global fight against SARS.",
