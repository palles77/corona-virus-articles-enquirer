HIV/AIDS, severe acute respiratory syndrome, H5N1 avian infl uenza, and many other emerging diseases have either proved fatal or caused international alarm. Common and interactive co-determinants of disease emergence, including population growth, travel, and environmental disruption, have been increasingly documented and studied. Are emerging infections a new phenomenon related to modern life, or do more basic determinants, transcending time, place, and human progress, govern disease generation? By examining a number of historically notable epidemics, we suggest that emerging diseases, similar in their novelty, impact, and elicitation of control responses, have occurred throughout recorded history. Fundamental determinants, typically acting in concert, seem to underlie their emergence, and infections such as these are likely to continue to remain challenges to human survival.",

[3] [4] [5] These infections also include \"deliberately emerging diseases\"-eg, bioterrorism. 5 Concern about emerging infections has grown following the appearance of new diseases, such as HIV/AIDS, and the re-emergence of others, such as dengue, and from appreciation of the complex determinants of their emergence-eg, microbial adaptation to new hosts (HIV infection, severe acute respiratory syndrome [SARS]), population immunity pressures (infl uenza A), travel (acute haemorrhagic conjunctivitis), animal migration and movement (West Nile virus infection, H5N1 avian infl uenza), microbial escape from antibiotic pressures (multidrug-resistant and extensively drug-resistant tuberculosis), mechanical dispersal (Legionnaires' disease), and others (panel, fi gure 1). [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] Clearly, however, the terminology of emergence is not entirely new. 8, 9 In the Old Testament, ancient China, classical Greece and Rome, and in subsequent centuries, new diseases have repeatedly been said to be \"introduced\", or to \"appear\", \"approach\", \"arise\", \"breed\", \"progress\", \"spread\", or \"invade\" etc. [10] [11] [12] In this article we ask two basic questions. Are emerging infections a new phenomenon? And do fundamental determinants, transcending time, place, and human progress govern their generation?",

The plague is said to have spawned the Tanzwuth (dancing mania) epidemics of the next two centuries, in which bands of itinerant youths roamed the countryside drinking, dancing frenetically, and tossing each other into the air. 31, 32 Multiple independent importations of the plague prompted public-health action in Europe and neighbouring areas. Frightened citizens began isolating arriving ships for as long as 40 (quaranta) days, the origin of quarantine. 14 In a Europe emerging from feudalism, government was now held accountable for public health. \"[E]veryone must refl ect on and prevent the causes that can produce a universal or local pestilence [an epidemic or an outbreak]\", wrote Jacme d'Agramont in 1348. \"And if perchance these can be removed they must be removed. And to this end an eff ort should be made by the Lords [municipal offi cials] and their offi cers whose duty it is to look after the...well-being of the community\". 33 The Black Death may also have been associated with one of the earliest recorded examples of bioterrorism. [24] [25] [26] In 1346 a Tartar army besieging the garrisoned Genovese city of Caff a (now Feodosiya, Ukraine) was devastated by plague. The Tartars reacted by catapulting \"mountains\" (probably thousands) of plague corpses into the city, 24, 25 allegedly transmitting it to the besieged Genovese. 26 600 years later, during World War II, Japanese troops were less successful in starting a plague epidemic by dropping paper bags fi lled with infected fl eas on Chinese cities. 34, 35 When (Old and New) Worlds collide: the French pox, 1494 \"...nowadays we see maladies unknown to our forefathers springing up around us\".",

Priests denounced the wickedness and immorality of an age that had provoked God's anger in the form of a deadly pandemic. Aff ected spouses, lovers, family, and friends were shunned and abandoned.

Francisco Pizarro, who continued Spanish conquests of South America in the 1530s, is alleged to have undertaken a bioterrorist attack on native peoples using smallpoxcontaminated blankets. 50 Mexico became a regional geographic reservoir for smallpox and was the source of repeated exportations until the 1940s.",

The entire federal government, along with physicians, merchants, and the middle and upper classes, quickly followed. Philadelphia, then the nation's capital, became a ghost town with an empty harbour, deserted streets, shuttered shops, and rotting corpses. 18 Within a few weeks yellow fever, or as Europeans called it \"the American plague\", killed more than 5000 of about 50 000 Philadelphians. 58 The disease then moved to the major US cities, including Baltimore, Boston, and New York, and to many smaller towns. 18, 59 Recurrent yellow fever epidemics panicked the nation for six consecutive years, aff ecting nearly every American in some way. 18, 60, 61 Philadelphians who remained in the city formed an emergency government, mobilising the most marginalised citizens-immigrants and African-Americans-mistakenly believing the latter to be naturally resistant. 18, 62, 63 Opposition by physicians to the use of quarantine measures put them in the middle of angry political debates. 18, 58 National days of thanksgiving and prayer expressed the general belief that the epidemics were \"a national judgment, and the[ir] removal...a national blessing\". 64 In 1793, a young belle, Dolley Todd, watched both her husband and infant son die in her arms of yellow fever, then nearly died of it herself. 20 years later the remarried Dolley Madison nursed her second husband-President James Madison-when he nearly died in offi ce of what might have been yellow fever. 60 Historians have claimed that deep social and political fault lines were opened up by the American plague of 1793-98, stamping the nation's character and \"[shaking] the newly laid foundations of the Republic...[so that] the crises they aroused have never been entirely put to rest\". 58 But the epidemics also led to important advances in public health, such as the establishment by Congress in 1798 of the Marine Hospital System, 65 ",

The term seems to have taken hold following an 1875 British parliamentary speech in which Colonial Secretary Lord Carnarvon described an epidemic that had just killed a third of the population of Great Britain's new Crown Colony, Fiji. 20, 72 The Fiji tragedy began innocently. On Jan 12, 1875, HMS Dido sailed into Fiji with its former king and queen, two of their sons, and a retinue of about 100 Fijians. As a sign of good will, Queen Victoria had sent them all on a post-cession sightseeing visit to Australia. 13 days into the 19-day return voyage, one of the sons developed fever and rash. The ship surgeon diagnosed measles, then prevalent in Sydney, but as yet unknown in Fiji.",

On Jan 25, 13 days (about one measles incubation period) after HMS Dido's return, the meeting was attended by 69 chiefs, 800 family and guests, and the 143-man police force, many already developing fevers and rashes. 20 The attendees returned to their homes throughout Fiji, seeding a widespread and deadly measles epidemic that killed a third of Fiji's population, an estimated 40 000 people, 20 and was exported to other Pacifi c islands in a regional pandemic. To reduce fever, terrifi ed Fijians lay down in the ocean and in streams and wrapped small children in wet grass. Trying to stop epidemic spread, those who were unaffl icted burned the villages of ill, with friends and family still trapped inside their dwellings. Corpses lay everywhere in the open, scavenged by dogs and wild pigs. The stench of destroyed villages was notable a mile away. Ratu Savanaca succumbed and his body was thrown into a communal pit. The mountain chiefs revolted, killing and sometimes eating British subjects. They were defeated by British forces in The Little War, and their leaders were hung. 20 years later, when Queen Victoria commissioned a study of Fiji's population decrease, the emerging measles epidemic was barely mentioned; 73 thus Fijian \"racial degeneracy\" remained the eugenics-inspired explanation for the decrease. The cautionary tale of Fiji's quintessential virgin soil epidemic remained in textbooks for another century, but the determinants of its emergence were largely ignored.",

Within a few years the HIV/AIDS pandemic may surpass the total lethality of the 1918 infl uenza pandemic to achieve the dubious distinction of being the deadliest emerging disease in recorded history. Like the Black Death of the 14th century, AIDS has rapidly caused high mortality and led to profound social and economic disruption that creates conditions supporting further spread. 82 Since at least the time of Thucydides, one of the fi rst human responses to disease emergence has been to question its origin. When identifi ed in 1981, AIDS seemed to be a completely new disease. Its early recognition in a peripatetic airline steward suggested (only partly correctly) that its emergence might have resulted from increased human movement resulting from ever decreasing travel times to multiple destinations. 84 Moreover, rapid spread via blood and body fl uids within risk groups most capable of supporting such transmission (men who have sex with men, injection drug users, and transfusion recipients) seemed to support recent emergence. Surprisingly, however, phylogenetic analyses of the virus suggest that HIV infection emerged as a human disease around 1900, 85 and by complex pathways. Multiple jumps, into chimpanzees, of simian immunodefi ciency virus (SIV) strains restricted to diff erent primate species, 86 were apparently followed by SIV genetic recombinations that produced new chimpanzee-adapted SIVs. It is likely that three of these recombinants then transferred independently into human beings, leading to parallel HIV emergences now represented by diff erent HIV clades. 85 About 1% of Europeans are resistant to HIV because of a homozygous 32 bp deletion in the gene encoding for the major co-receptor for HIV, the human CCR5 cellsurface molecule. This protective allele seems to have appeared in the distant past and to have been positively selected for over many centuries. Geneticists and demographers generally agree that the driving force behind this allele's frequency was probably an infectious disease, although historical, mathematical, and archeological evidence is incomplete for the two chief contenders, smallpox and plague. 87",

As long ago as 1918, in the era before commercial air travel, the second wave of the infl uenza pandemic appeared in diff erent regions of the world almost simultaneously. In 2008, air travel can bring a new disease from any major city to any other in a day (fi gure 3), while complex trade and distribution systems can spread even a non-contagious infectious disease quickly beyond the reach of local public-health containment, as exemplifi ed by a US national ice creamassociated epidemic of salmonella in 1994 88 and a spinachassociated epidemic of Escherichia coli O157:H7 in 2006. 89 Moreover, recent recognition of the role of weather/ climate, climate cycles (eg, the El Ni\u00f1o southern oscillation), and global warming in the emergence of diseases such as dengue and malaria suggests that risk determinant complexities and interactions may increase. 6 Although this article has emphasised emerging pandemic diseases, emerging diseases with more limited (non-pandemic) spread, such as hantavirus pulmonary syndrome and Lyme disease, have also presented substantial public-health challenges. In other cases, disease emergence may occur so insidiously that recognition is diffi cult (eg, tuberculosis during the Renaissance [14-17th centuries]). In recent times we have seen an extraordinary growth in re-emergence of infectious diseases, a phenomenon that apparently began in the Age of Discovery (15-18th centuries), when microbes came into contact with new human populations, and which is still accelerating as population growth and travel provide better avenues of escape for microbes entrenched in complex localised ecosystems (eg, geographic extension of arboviral diseases such as dengue, Japanese encephalitis, West Nile virus, and chikungunya infections).",

These determinants have been similar in their explosiveness, impact, and elicitation of public-health control responses. Whether the nature and pattern of these determinants are changing or will change in the future remains speculative. That most of the historical emerging diseases we examined were associated with unique patterns of common determinants suggests to us that an increasingly complex modern world will probably provide increasing opportunities for disease emergence. For centuries a fundamental challenge to the existence and well-being of societies-as refl ected by scientifi c attention, as well as in art, religion, and culture-emerging infections remain among the principal challenges to human survival.",
