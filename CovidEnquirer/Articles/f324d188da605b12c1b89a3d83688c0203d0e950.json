The use of dogs continued as biomedical research advanced, and they were featured in many noteworthy studies, including those by Pavlov to observe and document the conditioned reflex response and by Banting and Best to identify the role of insulin in diabetes mellitus.

These dogs are used to study the basic regulatory mechanisms involved with hematopoiesis, as well as possible treatments for both the human and the canine conditions (Brabb et al., 1995) . Golden retrievers affected with muscular dystrophy have been used as models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in human children. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by an absence of the muscle protein dystrophin, inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. The dystrophy in golden retrievers is caused by absence of the same protein and is inherited in the same way. The clinical signs (such as debilitating limb contracture) are also similar between the canine and human conditions (Kornegay et al., 1994) . Bedlington terriers have been used to study copper storage diseases (such as Wilson's disease), and the development of spontaneous diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism in a variety of dogs has also been studied for comparisons with the human conditions.",

Usually these dogs are either beagles or mongrel foxhounds, although other breeds may be available. Purpose-bred dogs typically receive veterinary care throughout their stay at the breeding facility.

The reader is referred to these guidelines for useful reference points for management of an animal's diet during various physiologic states (e.g., gestation, lactation, maturational age). Most commercially available balanced dog diets are \"closedformula\" diets, in which the labeled specific minimum requirements for protein and fat, and the maximum values for ash and fiber, are met. These diets do not necessarily provide the identical composition of ingredients from batch to batch. Ingredient composition varies, depending on the cost relationships of the various ingredients as the manufacturer attempts to achieve the label requirements at the lowest ingredient cost. An \"openformula\" (or \"fixed-formula\") diet provides more precise dietary control. In these diets the ingredients are specified, and the percentage of each ingredient is kept constant from batch to batch. \"Semipurified\" diets provide for the strictest control of ingredients and are formulated from the purified components: amino acids, lipids, carbohydrates, vitamins, and minerals.",

The maintenance energy requirement (MER) is the amount of energy used by a moderately active adult animal in a thermoneutral environment, which in the dog is approximately twice the BER (Lewis et al., 1987) . For dogs weighing greater than 2 kg, the MER may be calculated using this simplified linear equation: MER (metabolizable kcal/day) = 2(30 weightkg + 70) (National Research Council, 1985; Lewis et al., 1987) . The quantity of a correctly balanced diet to be fed to each dog can then be determined by dividing the MER by the energy density of the diet.",

Catheterization of the cervix is usually not possible in the normal bitch at any stage of the reproductive cycle, except during or immediately following parturition. Thus, semen is deposited at the external cervical os during natural or artificial insemination. The vagina is a long musculomembranous canal that extends from the uterus to the vulva. When the vagina is examined, the gloved finger or examination instrument should be introduced through the dorsal commissure of the vulva so as to avoid the deep ventral clitoral fossa. Examination should proceed at an angle of approximately 60 ~ until the instrument or fingertip has passed over the ischial arch, after which it can be directed further craniad toward the cervix. The bitch has a monoestrous cycle, with clinical estrus occurring predominantly in January or February and again in July or August (although it can occur at any time of year). The estrous cycle consists of four stages: proestrus, estrus, diestrus, and anestrus. The average duration of proestrus is 9 days. During this stage the vulva is enlarged, turgid, and firm, and a sanguinous vaginal discharge is present. Endocrinologically, proestrus is the follicular stage of the cycle, and estrogen levels peak at this time. Estrus generally lasts 9 days, and the vulva is softer and smaller than in proestrus. A vaginal discharge persists during estrus and may remain serosanguinous or become straw-colored. The endocrine feature of estrus is the luteinizing hormone (LH) surge, followed by ovulation within 24-72 hours. Diestrus begins approximately 9 days after the onset of standing heat. The end of this stage is 60 days later, which would be coincident with whelping if the bitch had become pregnant. Serum progesterone levels peak during diestrus. The duration of anestrus is approximately 4 months. Anestrus is the stage of reproductive quiescence, characterized by an absence of ovarian activity and serum progesterone levels of less than 1 ng/ml.",

Testicular growth is rapid at this time, and the seminiferous tubules begin to differentiate. The Sertoli cells form the bloodtestis barrier, the tubules become hollow, and spermatogenesis commences. This process is initiated by the secretion of LH from the anterior pituitary, which stimulates the production of testosterone by the interstitial, or Leydig's, cells. Secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) by the anterior pituitary stimulates the production of other key hormones by the Sertoli cells, including inhibin, androgen binding protein, and estrogen. FSH stimulates spermatogenesis in the presence of testosterone, while inhibin and estrogen play a role in a feedback loop on the pituitary gland to decrease FSH production. Spermatogenesis in the dog is completed in 45 days, with subsequent maturation of sperm occurring in the epididymis for approximately 15 days. Thus, the entire process from initiation of spermatogonial mitosis to delivery of mature sperm to the ejaculate is 60 days.",

As cornification of vaginal epithelial cells proceeds, the cells become larger, with more angular borders. The nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio decreases until the nuclei reach a point where they no longer take up stain (coincident with the onset of estrus). The cells appear \"anuclear\" and are classified as \"cornified\" or \"anuclear squames.\" Cornification occurs approximately 2 days prior to the estrogen peak and 4 days prior to standing heat. The percentage of cornified cells (of the total number of epithelial cells) decreases gradually to zero after the onset of diestrus. The vaginal cytology smear of the bitch changes from predominantly cornified to noncornified 6 days after ovulation. The day of this change is the first day of diestrus. Other epithelial cell types noted on vaginal cytology include superficial cells (large, angular cells with small nuclei); intermediate cells (round or oval cells with abundant cytoplasm and large, vesicular nuclei); and parabasal cells (small round or elongated cells with large, well-stained nuclei, and a high nuclear-cytoplasmic ratio). Based on vaginal cytology, the estrous cycle is classified as follows: Although vaginal cytology is a useful tool, it is not a substitute for observation of behavioral estrus, which is the best criterion to use in breeding management. During proestrus the male is attracted to the bitch and will investigate her hindquarters, but she will not accept breeding. The behavioral hallmark of estrus is standing receptivity toward the male. During this stage the bitch will exhibit \"flagging,\" or elevation of her tail with muscular elevation of the vulva to facilitate penetration by the male. In order to maximize the conception rate, and the number of pups whelped per egg ovulated, it is recommended to breed the bitch on days 1, 3, and 5 of the standing heat.",

Ehrlichia canis is found worldwide and follows the distribution of the vector. Infection in dogs is most prevalent in tropical and subtropical areas (Greene, 1991) . In the United States, cases are concentrated in the southeastern and southwestern states but have been reported in almost every state (Breitschwerdt, 2000) .

Cross-reaction may occur between E. canis, E. chaffeensis, and E. ewingii. Titers greater than 1:10 are considered positive and indicative of infection and may persist for up to 1 year. Effective treatment typically produces seronegative results in 6-9 months. In some cases, asymptomatic dogs may remain seropositive for years after treatment or may be seropositive with a persistent hematologic abnormality (Bartsch and Greene, 1996) . The exact mechanism for this finding has not been elucidated. Ehrlichia canis morulae can be demonstrated in circulating monocytes of Giemsa-stained blood smears. However, this method is labor-intensive and has low sensitivity, as morulae are present transiently and in low numbers. Using buffy coat smears from capillary blood may increase the diagnostic yield.

Coinfection with E. canis has been reported, which suggests a common vector for both organisms (French and Harvey, 1983; Kordick et al., 1999) . Dogs have been experimentally infected by inoculation with infected blood or infected platelets from other dogs (Harvey et al., 1978; Gaunt et al., 1990) . The geographic distribution of thrombocytic ehrlichiosis is assumed to follow that of other Ehrlichia organisms. The highest concentration of cases seems to be in southeastern states, but isolated cases have been reported as far north as Michigan and as far west as Oklahoma (Wilson, 1992; Mathew et aL, 1997) . The prevalence of seropositive dogs can be high in some parts of the country. A study by Bradfield et al. (1996) reported that 74% of the dogs entering a research institute's quarantine facility from sources in eastern North Carolina were seropositive for E. platys. Hoskins et al.

The geographic distribution of canine borreliosis is assumed to follow that of the human disease and is related to the range of the arthropod vectors. Three major endemic foci that have been identified in the United States account for 94% of reported human cases (Appel and Jacobson, 1995). The distribution of these cases is as follows: Northeast/mid-Atlantic focus, 85%; midwestern focus (Michigan, Wisconsin, Minnesota, Iowa, Illinois, and Missouri), 10%; and California and Oregon, 4%. For the most part, dogs in the remainder of the country are not at risk for contracting Lyme disease. Borrelia burgdorferi is transmitted exclusively by Ixodes ticks. Other arthropod hosts may carry the organism but have not as yet been implicated in the transmission of disease. Ixodes scapularis, a three-host tick with a 2 to 3 year life cycle, is the prototypical vector for North America. The spirochetes are spread by tick bites from both nymphs and adults. Ticks become infected by feeding on an infected mammal and by transstadial transmission (transovarial passage is rare). In endemic areas, 50-80% of adult ticks may be infected (Appel and Jacobson, 1995) . The primary reservoir for the organism is the whitefooted deer mouse, Peromyscus ieucopus, which can carry spirochetes for its life span without becoming ill. Evidence also indicates that the eastern chipmunk, Tamias striatus, is an important reservoir (Slajchert et al., 1997) , and birds may also be a significant reservoir. Deer, however, serve only as hosts for the tick vectors and not as a reservoir for the spirochete.",

Some evidence points to the host's inflammatory response to the organism as etiologic for disease (Pershing et aL, 1994; Greene, 1991) . Seroconversion in dogs occurs 4-6 weeks after infection with B. burgdorferi. Antibody titers may remain extremely elevated for at least 18 months. IgM titers also remain elevated for several months and are indicative of neither acute nor active infection (Appel and Jacobson, 1995) .

IFA or ELISA tests for Borrelia antibodies are the assays of choice. It should be re-membered, however, that a positive titer in an endemic area indicates exposure and not necessarily disease and that vaccinated dogs will also have a positive titer.

The third, or paralytic, stage is characterized by incoordination and ascending ataxia of the hindlimbs due to viral-induced damage of motor neurons.

For this reason, random-source dogs or dogs housed in outdoor kennels are much more likely to have heartworm infestations than indoor, purpose-bred dogs. Mosquitoes become infested with heartworm microfilariae when they take a blood meal from the dog. The microfilaria progress through several larval stages within the mosquito, eventually terminating at the third stage. This stage is then returned to the canine bloodstream during feeding. This stage matures within the dog's circulatory system, and the adults reside in the pulmonary artery. Male and female heartworms will then sexually reproduce to create more microfilariae and propagate the parasitic life cycle. In the United States, transmission of heartworm by mosquitoes occurs over a 6month or shorter period, except for the southeastern and Gulf Coast states. Here, climatic conditions enable longer survival of the mosquitoes (possibly year-round), thus resulting in the highest prevalence of heartworm infestation (Knight, 2000) .",

Use of adult heartworm antigen tests has virtually eliminated the historical status of \"occult\" heartworm disease, which was caused by infestation of adult worms without corresponding microfilarial circulation. Commercial test kits that assay for the presence of adult heartworm antigens, and designed for use by veterinary practitioners, are readily available. False-negative results can occur during the prepatent period after initial infection (first 6-7 months), and when the adult worm burden is light or predominantly male. Infections consisting of more than three mature female worms are usually detected by antigenic serology (Knight, 2000) . A significant feature of these tests for circulating antigen is that they have a very high specificity (low rate of false-positive resuits).

Such studies have looked at factors released by adult heartworms, as well as changes in the function of host tissues in response to the worm presence. Probably the most consistent finding is that endothelial cell-dependent relaxation of pulmonary arterial smooth muscle is depressed in heartworm-infected dogs as compared with control dogs, indicative of alterations in local endothelial cell behavior (Maksimowich et al., 1997; Matsukura et al., 1997; Mupanomunda et al., 1997) . The extension of this effect on peripheral arteries (in vivo and in vitro) has been supported in some studies (Kaiser et al., 1992) but refuted in others (Tithof et al., 1994) . It is thought that the endothelium is perturbed by a factor released from the adult Dirofilaria, possibly a cyclooxygenase product such as prostaglandin D2 (Kaiser et al., 1990 (Kaiser et al., , 1992 . These products have also been demonstrated to cause constriction in in vitro rat tracheal ring preparations (Collins et al., 1994) , suggesting that bronchoconstriction could be an aspect of the pathogenesis of the infestation. Platelet reactivity was also been found to be enhanced in dogs naturally infected with Dirofilaria, when compared with uninfected controis (Boudreaux and Dillon, 1991) . Based on these data, dogs that are positive for adult heartworm antigen should be considered inappropriate for use as research subjects and, if used, should be restricted to nonsurvival preparations that do not require physiological measurements.",

            "text": "Clinical signs. Because it affects metabolism in general, hypothyroidism can produce a large number of clinical signs referable to many organ systems. An individual dog with hypothyroidism may have one or any combination of clinical signs. Hypothyroidism reduces the dog's metabolic rate, which then produces such signs as obesity, lethargy, cold intolerance, and constipation. Additionally, hypothyroidism can produce several dermatologic abnormalities, including alopecia, hyperpigmentation, seborrhea, and pyoderma (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Panciera, 1994) . Several clinicopathologic abnormalities have also been reported in a large percentage of hypothyroid dogs. These aberrations include increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides due to a decrease in lipolysis and decreased numbers of low-density lipopolysaccharide receptors (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Panciera, 1994) . Normocytic normochromic nonregenerative anemia and increased serum alkaline phosphatase and creatine kinase have also been reported in a significant number of hypothyroid dogs (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Panciera 1994) . Neurologic signs of hypothyroidism, which include lameness, foot dragging, and paresis, may be caused by several mechanisms such as segmental nerve demyelination or nerve entrapment secondary to myxedema (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989) . Mental impairment and dullness have also been reported in hypothyroid dogs, secondary to atherosclerosis and cerebral myxedema (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989) . Hypothyroidism has been implicated in other neurological abnormalities such as Horner's syndrome, facial nerve paralysis, megaesophagus, and laryngeal paralysis; however, these conditions do not always resolve with treatment (Bischel et al., 1988; Panciera, 1994) , and so the relationship between hypothyroidism and these problems has not been completely defined (Panciera, 1994) . Myopathies associated with hypothyroidism are caused by metabolic dysfunction and atrophy of type II muscle fibers and can present with signs similar to neurological disease (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989) . Hypothyroidism can also cause bradycardia as a result of decreased myocardial conductivity. Abnormalities that may be detected by ECG include a decrease in P and R wave amplitude (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989) and inverted T waves (Panciera, 1994) . These electrocardiographic abnormalities are caused by lowered activity of ATPases and calcium channel function. Several reports have suggested that hypothyroidism is associated with von Willebrand's disease and bleeding abnormalities. However, the relationship is probably one of shared breed predilection and not a true correlation. It has been demonstrated that dogs with hypothyroidism are not deficient in von Willebrand's factor when compared with other dogs. In addition, the replacement of thyroid hormone in dogs did not increase the levels of vWF:Ag in naturally occurring (Panciera and Johnson, 1994) or experimentally induced (Panciera and Johnson, 1996) hypothyroidism.",

            "text": "Currently, the ability to diagnose hypothyroidism relies heavily on the measurement of serum total T 4 (thyroxine) and free T 4 (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Ferguson, 1994) . T 4 serves primarily as a precursor for T 3 in the body and is heavily proteinbound. Free T4 represents the unbound fraction that is available to the tissues (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989) . Using the measurement of serum total T 4 and free T4, hypothyroidism can usually be ruled out if the values are within the normal range or higher. If both hormone concentrations are low, it is highly likely that the patient has hypothyroidism, and a therapeutic trial is in order (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989) . However, it must be noted that nonthyroidal illnesses and some drugs (e.g., glucocorticoids, anticonvulsants, phenylbutazone, salicylates) can falsely lower these values (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Ferguson, 1994) . Therefore, low values do not always indicate that hypothyroidism is present, and animals should not be treated solely on the basis of serum hormone levels if clinical signs are absent. If the clinical signs are equivocal or if only total T 4 or free T 4 is decreased, further diagnostic testing is warranted (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989) . Although T 3 is the most biologically active form of thyroid hormone in the body, the measurement of serum T 3 levels is an unreliable indicator of hypothy-roidism (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Ferguson, 1994) . Like T4, serum T 3 can be falsely lowered by many nonthyroidal illnesses and many drugs (see above). In addition, T 3 may be preferentially released, and conversion of T 4 to T 3 may be enhanced in the hypothyroid dog (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Ferguson, 1994) . T 3 was within normal limits in 15% of the hypothyroid dogs in one study (Panciera, 1994) . Autoantibodies can be responsible for false elevations in the concentrations of T 3 and T 4 found in these respective assays. It has been recommended that free T4, measured by equilibrium dialysis, be assayed in dogs that are suspected of hypothyroidism and have autoantibodies with normal or high T 3 and T 4. Autoantibodies have been found in less than 1% of the samples submitted to one laboratory (Kemppainen and Behrend, 2000) .",

In humans, endogenous TSH (thyroid-stimulating hormone) levels provide reliable information on thyroid status, and an assay for endogenous TSH is now available in dogs. However, TSH levels can be normal in some dogs with hypothyroidism, and high TSH levels have been noted in normal dogs. Therefore, it is recommended that TSH levels be considered along with other information (clinical signs, T4) prior to diagnosis and treatment (Kemppainen and Behrend, 2000) . TSH stimulation testing using exogenous bovine TSH provides a good and reliable method for establishing a diagnosis. Unfortunately, the availability and expense of TSH limit the use of this diagnostic tool (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Ferguson, 1994) . Another drawback of TSH testing is that the test must be postponed for 4 weeks if thyroid supplementation has been given (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989) . When TSH is available for testing, there are several recommendations for dosage, routes of administration, and sampling times. One recommendation is 0.045 U of TSH per pound of body weight (up to a maximum of 5 U) to be administered IV. For this protocol, blood samples are taken prior to administration of TSH and 6 hours after. A normal response to the administration of TSH should create an increase of T 4 levels at least 2 ktg/dl above the baseline levels or an absolute level that exceeds 3 ~tg/dl (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Wheeler et al., 1985) .",

If drugs that decrease thyroxine levels are being administered concurrently, it may be necessary to divide the thyroxine dose for twice daily administration. After the supplementation has begun, the thyroid hormone level should be rechecked in 6-8 weeks, and blood samples should be drawn 4-8 hours after the morning pill. A clinical response is usually seen in 6-8 weeks and would include weight loss, hair regrowth, and resolution of other signs (Panciera, 1994) .

            "text": "Etiology. Obesity is defined as a body weight 20-25% over the ideal. In general, obesity occurs when the intake of calories exceeds the expenditure of energy. Excessive caloric intake resuits from overeating or eating an unbalanced diet. Overeating is a common cause of obesity in pet dogs and may be triggered by boredom, nervousness, or conditioning (MacEwen, 1992) . In addition, pet animals are often subjected to unbalanced diets supplemented with high-fat treats. In the laboratory animal setting, overeating is less likely than in a household, because access to food is more restricted and diets are usually a commercially prepared balanced ration. However, obesity can still be a problem if specific guidelines for energy requirements are not followed. In addition, the necessary caging of dogs in the research environment and thus the limitation to exercise reduces energy expenditure and predisposes dogs to weight gain. It is also important to realize that other factors may predispose dogs to obesity, even when guidelines for caloric intake and energy expenditure are followed (Butterwick and Hawthorne,. 1998 ). As in humans, genetics plays an important role in the development of obesity in dogs. It has been established that certain breeds are more predisposed toward obesity. In a study of dogs visiting veterinary clinics in the United Kingdom, Labrador retrievers were most likely to be obese. Other breeds affected included Cairn terriers, dachshunds, basset hounds, golden retrievers, and cocker spaniels. The beagle was also listed as a breed predisposed to obesity in the household environment (Edney and Smith, 1986) .",

The ideal body condition for dogs is considered to be achieved when the ribs are barely visible but easily palpated beneath the skin surface. When the ribs are not easily palpated and/or the dog's normal function is impaired by its weight, the animal is considered obese. There are few objective, quantifiable methods for establishing this diagnosis. Ultrasound has been evaluated for measurement of subcutaneous fat in dogs, and measurements taken from the lumbar area can be used to reliably predict total body fat (Wilkinson and McEwan, 1991) . After a diagnosis of obesity has been made, additional diagnostic tests should be performed to determine if there is an underlying cause for the problem. A complete physical exam should be performed to look for signs of concurrent disease and to establish if obesity has adversely affected the individual. Serum thyroid hormones should be evaluated (see Section III,B,l,a), and serum chemistry may reveal an increased alkaline phosphatase associated with hyperadrenocorticism.",

Ideally, weight loss will occur at a rate of 1-2% of body weight per week (Laflamme et al., 1997) .

Alternatively, several diet dog foods are available, and there is some evidence that these diets are superior to simple volume restriction (MacEwen, 1992) . There has been much concern about the addition of fiber to the diet in both humans and animals as a method for reducing caloric intake while maintaining the volume fed. Studies in dogs have examined the addition of both soluble and insoluble fibers to calorierestricted diets. These studies have shown that the addition of fiber does not have an effect on satiety in dogs and therefore does not have a beneficial effect in weight loss protocols (Butterwick and Thorne, 1994; Butterwick and Thorne, 1997) .",

It is best to avoid using topical disinfectants in the wound until further wound treatment (culture, debridement, lavage) has been performed (Swaim, 1980) . When the treatment of a wound begins, anesthesia or analgesia may be necessary, and the choice of anesthetic regimen will depend on the size and location of the wound as well as the preference of the clinician. If the wound is contaminated or dirty, bacterial cultures, both aerobic and anaerobic, should be performed at this time. Then a water-soluble lubricant gel may be applied directly to the wound. A wide margin of hair should then be clipped from around the wound, using a #40 blade. After the clipping, a surgical scrub is performed around the edges of the wound. Povidone-iodine alternating with alcohol or chlorhexidine gluconate scrub alternating with water is most often recommended for surgical preparation of the skin surface (Osuna et al., 1990a,b) . Simple abrasions that involve only a partial thickness of the skin do not generally require further treatment. Full-thickness wounds require further attention, including irrigation with large quantities of a solution delivered under pressure. Two solutions, 0.05% chlorhexidine diacetate in water (Lozier et al., 1992) and 1% povidone-iodine in saline, are most often recommended for wound lavage (Waldron and Trevor, 1993) . The chlorhexidine solution may offer the advantage of greater bactericidal activity but does not significantly alter wound healing when compared with povidone-iodine (Sanchez et al., 1988) . Actually, the type of solution chosen may not be as important to wound care as the volume and pressure at which the solution is delivered. It has been suggested that 8 psi is required to obtain adequate tissue irrigation, and this may be achieved by using a 35 ml syringe and an 18-or 19gauge needle (Waldron and Trevor, 1993) .",

Skin that is obviously necrotic should be removed. Although it is often recommended to remove skin back to the point at which it bleeds, this may not be feasible with large wounds on the limbs. In addition, other factors such as edema or hypovolemia may reduce bleeding in otherwise viable skin (Waldron and Trevor, 1993) . If one is unsure about tissue viability in areas that are devoid of extra skin, the tissue may be left (Swaim, 1980; Waldron and Trevor, 1993) , and nonviable areas will demarcate within 2-3 days (Waldron and Trevor, 1993) . Necrotic fat should be resected liberally, because it does not have a large blood supply and will provide an environment for infection. Often, resection of subcutaneous fat is necessary to remove debris and hair that could not be removed during wound irrigation. Damaged muscle should also be liberally resected (Swaim, 1980) . The wound should be irrigated several times during debridement and again after completion.",

The principles of basic surgery are discussed in several good texts, and readers are encouraged to pursue additional information. Primary wound closure is defined as closure of the wound at the time of initial wound therapy and is the treatment of choice for clean and clean-contaminated wounds. Closure is performed in two or more layers, carefully apposing tissues and obliterating dead space. If dead space will remain in the wound, a drain should be place d. Subcutaneous closure should be performed with absorbable suture such as polydioxanone (PDS), polyglactin 910 (Vicryl), or polyglycolic acid (Dexon). It is best to use interrupted sutures and avoid leaving excess suture material in the wound. It may be necessary to choose tension-relieving suture patterns, such as horizontal mattress. Skin closure is generally performed with nylon (3-0 or 4-0).",

After debridement and irrigation, the wound should be bandaged. Initially, the wound can be covered by gauze sponges soaked in saline or chlorhexidine to create a wet-to-dry bandage. When the sponges are later pulled from the wound, dried exudates will also be removed. When the wound appears clean, the layer in contact with the wound may be changed to a nonadherent dressing such as vaseline-impregnated gauze (Swaim, 1980) . The contact layer is covered by cotton padding, and the entire bandage is covered by a supportive and protective layer. The bandages should be changed once or twice daily, depending upon the amount of discharge coming from the wound. Wound closure within 3-5 days of wounding (prior to the formation of granulation tissue) is considered delayed primary closure. When the wound is closed after 5 days, this is considered secondary closure (Waldron and Trevor, 1993) . Secondintention healing involves allowing the wound to heal without surgical intervention. This type of healing is often used on limbs when there is an insufficient amount of skin to allow complete closure (Swaim, 1980) . It is important to note that second-intention healing will take longer than surgical repair of a wound, and in the case of large wounds it will be more expensive because of the cost of bandaging materials.",

When wounds have been severely contaminated or are dirty, antibiotics are indicated, and the type of antibiotic will ultimately depend on culture and sensitivity results. Until such results are available, the choice of antibiotic is based on the most likely organism to be encountered. In skin wounds, Staphylococcus spp. are generally of concern, whereas Pasteurella multocida should be considered in bite wounds. Cephalosporins, amoxicillin-clavulanate, and trimethoprim sulfas are often recommended for initial antibiotic therapy (Waldron and Trevor, 1993) .",

The compression of the soft tissues between the hard surfaces results in vascular occlusion, ischemia, and ultimately tissue death (Swaim and Angarano, 1990) . Several factors that increase pressure at the site and/or affect the integrity of the skin will predispose an individual to develop pressure sores. These factors include poor hygiene, self-trauma, low-protein diet, preexisting tissue damage, muscle wasting, inadequate bedding, and ill-fitting casts or bandages (Swaim and Angarano, 1990) .",

All of the damaged tissue should be debrided, and wound management guidelines should be followed (see Section III,C,1).

One of the most important aspects of treatment is to break the cycle of self-trauma. Mechanical restraint with an Elizabethan collar is one of the easiest methods to accomplish this goal. Several direct treatments have been examined, including intralesional and topical steroids, perilesional cobra venom, acupuncture, radiation, and surgery (Swaim and Angarano, 1990; Walton, 1986) . Opioid antagonists have been used in an attempt to treat acral lick granuloma by blocking endogenous opioids. In one study, either naltrexone (1 mg/kg SQ) or nalmefene (1-4 mg/kg SQ) successfully reduced the excessive licking behavior in 7 of 11 dogs; however, lesions returned after the drug was discontinued (Dodman et al., 1988) . The use of a mixture of flunixin meglumine, steroid, and dimethyl sulfoxide (3 ml of Banamine [Schering] mixed with 8ml of Synotic [Diamond Laboratories]) applied topically twice daily has also been shown to be effective (Walton, 1986) . The prognosis for acral lick granuloma should be considered guarded, because the lesions often recur or new lesions develop when treatment is discontinued.",

Conservative management of the elbow hygroma is aimed at relieving pressure at the point of the elbow by providing a padded cage surface and/or bandaging the elbow in a manner similar to that used to treat pressure sores (see Section III,C,2). More aggressive therapy, including needle drainage and the injection of corticosteroid into the hygroma, has been described but is not recommended, because infection is a serious complication of this treatment (Johnston, 1975) . Likewise, simple surgical excision of elbow hygromas can be associated with complications such as wound dehiscence and ulceration (Johnston, 1975) . A technique that has been used successfully involves placement of multiple Penrose drains. The drains are kept in place for 2-3 weeks, and the limb remains bandaged for 4 weeks with this technique (Bellah, 1993) . Another technique has been described that involves the removal of a crescent-shaped piece of the skin and capsule. The remaining dead space is closed with mattress sutures over stents, and then the wound is closed in a routine fashion. The stents are removed in 5-7 days, and the wound is bandaged until suture removal in 10-14 days (Newton et al., 1974) . Regardless of the method used to treat an elbow hygroma, recurrence of the problem is likely unless the predisposing factors are identified and relieved.",

Ointments are preferred over drops, because use of the former requires less frequent. Simple corneal ulcers are restained with fluorescein after 3 days and should show complete healing at that time. If the ulcer is not healed, this may indicate that the ulcer has an undermined edge impeding proper healing. Topical anesthetic should be applied to the eye, and a cotton-tipped applicator can be rolled over the surface of the ulcer toward its edge.

Because indwelling catheters play an important role in many research protocols, it is highly desirable to prevent catheter complications that may result in loss of the device. The catheter should be made of nonthrombogenic material. In addition, it is recommended that catheters be as simple as possible. A catheter with extra ports or multiple lumens requires addi- tional management and supplies more routes for infection. The use of vascular access ports that lie entirely under the skin eliminates many problems with infection. It has also been found that a long extension of tubing connected to the port may actually reduce the potential for infection of the catheter (Ringler and Peter, 1984) . The initial placement of an indwelling catheter must be done under aseptic conditions by individuals who are familiar with the procedure. The placement of the catheter should be verified by radiography. Catheters that are used for delivery of drugs or blood sampling should be positioned in the vena cava and not in the right atrium, thereby minimizing trauma to the tricuspid valve. After catheter placement, the animals should be observed daily for signs of either local or systemic infection. The catheter entry site should be disinfected, coated with antibiotic ointment, and rebandaged every other day. Once a month, the catheter line may be disinfected with chlorine dioxide, as described below (see \"Treatment\"). Throughout the life of the catheter, injections into and withdrawals from the catheter should be done in a sterile manner, and the number of breaks in the line should be kept to a minimum.",

Systemic antibiotic therapy should be initiated for a 10-day period. The choice of drug will ultimately be based on previous experience and culture results. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures of blood and locally infected sites should be performed (Ringler and Peter, 1984) . Localized abscesses or sinus tracts may be managed by establishing drainage and flushing with chlorhexidine. Again, the catheter should be removed. If retention of a catheter is important, the catheter lumen may be disinfected by filling with chlorine dioxide solution. It has been shown that there are no adverse effects from the use of chlorine dioxide in catheters (Dennis et al., 1989) . The solution is removed after 15 min and replaced with heparinized saline. All of the extension lines and fluids used in the catheter should be discarded. The blood cultures should be repeated 3 days after the antibiotic therapy has ceased.

This complication has largely been eliminated with the improved security afforded by a synthetic cuff added to the end of the catheter (Meunier et al., 1993) . The chapter authors have also seen migration of the catheter end within the lumen of the intestine (caused by peristaltic motion to egest the catheter), extensive intra-abdominal adhesions, and intestinal torsion (Figs. 6a,b) as complications of intestinal access ports.",

In addition, it is important to place the proper length of catheter within the peritoneal cavity; excess catheter length can promote adhesion formation, whereas insufficient catheter length to account for visceral organ motion can result in detachment. The placement and patency of the catheters can be verified periodically by contrast radiography using iodinated contrast material or by fecal occult blood testing after a small amount of blood has been injected through the catheter (Meunier et al., 1993) .",

Systemic blood pressure and cardiac output will be increased or within the normal range. The animals will often be febrile. Later in the course of the syndrome, the animals will show the classic signs of septic shock, including decreased temperature, pale mucous membranes, and a prolonged capillary refill time. Cardiac output and blood pressure are decreased as shock progresses. Peripheral edema and mental confusion have also been reported (Hauptman and Chaudry, 1993) . Pathogenesis. The pathophysiology of sepsis is complex and is mediated by immune responses involving mediators such ~ as cytokines, eicosinoids, complement, superoxide radicals, and nitric oxide. The body responds to overwhelming infection with an attempt to optimize metabolic processes and maximize oxygen delivery to tissues. However, if inflammation is left unchecked, the system may be unable to compensate, and the result is cardiovascular collapse.",

In general, a presumptive diagnosis of sepsis is made based on the occurrence of several in a group of signs, including altered body temperature, increased respiratory and/or heart rate, increased or decreased white blood cell count, increased number of immature neutrophils, decreased platelet count, decreased blood pressure, hypoxemia, and altered cardiac output. However, extreme inflammation without infection (e.g., pancreatitis, trauma) may create similar signs. One study examined the diagnosis of sepsis in canine patients at a veterinary hospital based on easily obtainable physical and laboratory findings. That study found that septic individuals had higher temperatures, WBC counts, and percentage of bands than nonseptic individuals, whereas platelet counts were lower in the septic dogs. There were no differences in respiratory rate or glucose levels between the groups. Using these criteria, the results had a high sensitivity and a tendency to overdiagnose sepsis (Hauptman et al., 1997) . Ultimately, the presence of a septic focus simplifies diagnosis greatly; however, the focus may not be obvious. If the signs of sepsis are evident but the focus is not, several systems should be evaluated for infection, including urinary tract, reproductive tract, abdominal cavity, respiratory tract, teeth, and heart valves (Kirby, 1995) .",

Deeper burns develop a thick covering, or eschar, composed of the coagulated proteins and desiccated tissue fluid. The wound heals by granulation under the eschar, which eventually sloughs or is removed to allow further healing by contraction and reepithelialization. Within 2-3 days of injury, the burn wound will be colonized by grampositive bacteria that rapidly cover the entire wound.

Because the degree of injury and extensive treatment associated with perivascular extravasation of a drug can be detrimental to research protocols and can cause severe discomfort to the dog, prevention of these injuries is preferred. Prior to the use of any substance, the investigator should be aware of its chemical composition and the potential for problems. If a potentially caustic compound is to be used in a fractious subject, sedation of the dog is warranted if this will not interfere with the research protocol. Whenever possible, insertion of an indwelling catheter is extremely important. Access to a central vessel such as the cranial or caudal vena cava is preferred over the use of peripheral vessels. When peripheral catheters are used, the injection should be followed by a vigorous amount of flushing with saline or other physiological solution and removal of the catheter. Additional injections are best given through newly placed catheters in previously unused vessels. The repeated use of an indwelling peripheral catheter should be approached cautiously and done only out of necessity. Prior to use, the catheter should be checked repeatedly for patency by withdrawal of blood and injection of saline. Any swelling at the catheter site or discomfort by the subject indicates that the catheter should not be used.",

In most cases, dilution of the drug with subcutaneous injections of saline is recommended. In addition, steroids may be infiltrated locally to reduce inflammation. Topical application of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) may also be helpful in reducing the immediate inflammation and avoiding the development of chronic lesions (Swaim and Angarano, 1990 ). The addition of lidocaine to subcutaneous injections of saline has been used in cases of thiacetarsemide injection (Hoskins, 1989) , and local infiltration of hyaluronidase accompanied by warm compresses has been suggested for use in cases of vinblastine injection (Waldron and Trevor, 1993) . Despite these treatments, necrosis of skin may be observed and would require serial debridement of tissues with secondary wound closure or skin grafting. In cases of doxorubicin extravasation, early excision of affected tissues is advocated to prevent the progressive sloughing caused by sustained release of the drug from dying tissues (Swaim and Angarano, 1990) . In all cases, the condition can be painful, and analgesia should be addressed.",

The type of drug to be used for seizure control is controversial. The short halflife of diazepam makes it an attractive choice compared with barbiturates, which have prolonged metabolism when hepatic function is impaired (Maddison, 1995) . However, endogenous benzodiazepines mediate some of the CNS signs seen with hepatic encephalopathy. Therefore, the use of diazepam has been discouraged in favor of phenobarbital (Johnson, 2000) .

Because protein metabolism is a major source of ammonia, all oral food intake should cease until the signs of hepatic encephalopathy have abated. Because gastrointestinal bleeding may occur in individuals with liver failure and this is also a source of protein, the use of H2 blockers such as cimetidine or ranitidine is suggested (Swalec, 1993) . In addition, lactulose retention enemas should be performed (10-15 ml/lb of a 30% solution in water, retained for 20-30 min) (Hardy, 1989) . Lactulose is an indigestible semisynthetic sugar that is metabolized in the gut to lactic and other acids. The decrease in colonic pH reduces ammonia levels in the bloodstream by converting intestinal ammonia into less diffusible ammonium ions. Lactulose will also cause an osmotic diarrhea. Antibiotics such as neomycin (10 mg/lb, 3-4 times/ day) or metronidazole (9 mg/lb, 3 times/day) should also be used to reduce the intestinal load of urease-producing bacteria responsible for splitting urea into ammonia (Hardy, 1989) .",

These requirements may be met by slowly increasing protein in the diet as long as signs of hepatic encephalopathy do not recur.

The nuclei are regular, the cytoplasm is packed with large granules that stain deeply, and mitotic figures are rare to absent. Grade II (intermediately differentiated) mast cell tumors have indistinct cytoplasmic boundaries with higher nuclear-cytoplasmic ratios, fewer granules, and occasional mitotic figures. Grade III (anaplastic or undifferentiated) mast cell tumors have large, irregular nuclei with multiple prominent nucleoli. The cytoplasmic granules are few, but mitotic figures are much more frequent. In addition to skin lesions, mast cell tumors have been associated with gastric ulcers. These lesions are most likely secondary to tumor production of histamine. Histamine stimulates the H2 receptors of the gastric parietal cells, causing increased acid secretion. Gastric ulcers have been observed in large numbers (>75%) of dogs with mast cell tumors (Howard et al., 1969) .",

Nuclear sclerosis is an apparent opacification of the lens caused by the compression of older lens fibers in the center of the lens (nucleus) as a consequence of the production of new fibers. Because the nucleus increases in size as the animal ages, the sclerosis is more apparent in older animals and may be mistaken as a senile cataract.

If the research study concerns steroidal hormone functions, then neither the condition nor the treatment is compatible.

Finasteride (Proscar) is a 5a-reductase inhibitor that limits metabolism of testosterone to 5a-dihydrotestosterone. Treatment at daily doses of 1-5 mg/kg has been effective in causing prostatic atrophy without affecting testicular spermatogenesis (Kustritz and Klausner, 2000) . Dogs given 1.0 mg/kg were proven to still be fertile. There are also indications that lower doses may be effective in relieving B PH. Androgen receptor antagonists (flutamide and hydroxyflutamide) have also been studied in the dog and found to be effective for treatment of BPH while maintaining libido and fertility (Kustritz and Klausner, 2000) .
