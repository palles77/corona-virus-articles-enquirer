Using questionnaires, we aimed to determine the direct and/or indirect contacts of flying foxes in an Indonesian nature conservation area with domestic animals and humans living in the surrounding area. We surveyed 150 residents of 10 villages in West Java. Villages were classified into 3 groups: inside and/or within 1 km from the outer border of the conservation area and 1-5 km or 5-10 km away from the reserve's outer border. Data were collected by direct interview using a structured questionnaire consisting of the respondent characteristics (age, sex and occupation); histories of contacts between flying foxes and humans, dogs and other domestic animals; and knowledge about infectious diseases, mainly rabies, in flying foxes. We found that flying foxes from the nature conservation area often enter residential areas at night to look for food, especially during the fruit season. In these residential areas, flying foxes had direct contacts with humans and a few contacts with domestic animals, especially dogs. People who encounter flying foxes seldom used personal protective equipment, such as leather gloves, goggles and caps. The residents living around the conservation area mostly had poor knowledge about flying foxes and disease transmission. This situation shows that the population in this region is at a quite high risk for contracting infectious diseases from flying foxes.",

KAP information was collected about rabies-related diseases including classical rabies, i.e., lyssavirus diseases themselves, natural reservoirs of lyssaviruses, their modes of transmission and prevention and treatment of lyssavirus diseases derived from flying foxes.",

The distribution of respondents in each area is shown in Fig. 2 . Respondent characteristics are shown in Table 1 . The majority of respondents (89.3%) were men, as explained above. This is because men are more interested in flying foxes compared with women. Men more frequently go outside their houses at night and thus have more opportunity to encounter flying foxes. Most respondents were also over 40 years old. The educational attainment of more than half of respondents (54.7%) was elementary school level; residents of area (c) had the lowest educational levels. This is likely because access to schools is difficult owing to poor transportation.",

Most farms in the district use the animal sharing system wherein farm owners entrust the management of their livestock to farmers through agreements. In turn, owners share the animal products, such as milk, meat or offspring. Many livestock animals in Garut are mainly grazed on rubber plantations along roads, because of a lack of land. There are also many free-roaming dogs in Garut that are owned by residents for protection and hunting purposes. This is the conventional way of keeping dogs, similar to other areas of Indonesia. Data from Jakarta and the surrounding areas before 1990 indicated that 65.5 and 24.0% of dog owners in rural and urban areas, respectively, let their dogs roam freely outside their house [18] . These free-roaming dogs could be a source of pathogens like rabies that are transmitted to other animals, including humans. Flying foxes have been known to fly long distances [2] . They occasionally fly hundreds of kilometers from their roosts to seek food [7] . Flying foxes have the ability to efficiently track food sources throughout the archipelago [22] . During fruit season, they usually enter residential areas where fruit trees are located, thus increasing the possibility of contact with other animals, such as in the case of Garut in the present study. In Australia, spectacled flying-foxes tend to have roosts near human residences. This appears to be owing to habitual behavior rather than habitat destruction [27] .",

Public knowledge in this area must be improved, considering that flying foxes frequently enter residential areas and come in contact with humans. Local communities and relevant government offices must equip the local population with appropriate knowledge, to prevent infectious disease from flying foxes. A study on human attitudes and public opinion in Australia about flying foxes and Hendra virus showed that most people already have moderate to high [14] . Nevertheless, only a few people in Garut believe that flying foxes can directly transmit infectious viruses to humans. Information on the involvement of bats in transmission of zoonotic diseases remains limited in that region, perhaps because no serious endemic zoonotic infectious diseases mediated by flying foxes have appeared in Garut. On the other hand, programs to increase awareness of bats being carriers of serious pathogens have not been established in Indonesia. With respect to the risk of human exposure to pathogens carried by bats in Thailand, Robertson et al. found that only a small proportion (11%) of people consider bats a potential source of rabies [25] . Although 27% of participants in that study had a history of being bitten or scratched by a bat, 36% of them took no action or did not know what to do in such cases. Based on these findings, it is highly recommended that people are educated on the risk of zoonoses from bats in Southeast Asian countries.",
