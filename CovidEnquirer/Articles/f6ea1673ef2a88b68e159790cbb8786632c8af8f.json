Oral infections may arise either from an endogenous source, that is, one yielding microorganisms normally found in the mouth, such as plaque-related dental caries and periodontal disease, or an exogenous source yielding microorganisms not normally found as part of the oral microflora. Dental caries and periodontal disease involve the adherence of bacteria and development of biofilms on both the natural and restored tooth surface.

Both deand remineralization processes of the teeth are also mediated by the pellicle.

Initial colonizers include Streptococcus oralis, Streptococcus sanguinis, and Streptococcus mitis.

The disease process involves acidogenic plaque bacteria, including Streptococcus mutans, Streptococcus sobrinus, and Lactobacillus spp. [14] , whereas periodontal diseases can involve both the soft and hard tissues and are initiated by components of the plaque biofilm that develop on the hard root surface adjacent to the soft tissues of the supporting periodontium. Periodontal disease may be confined to the gingiva (gingivitis) or extend to the deeper supporting structures with destruction of the periodontal ligament and the alveolar bone that supports the teeth (periodontitis). This loss of attachment, with associated periodontal pocket formation, may ultimately lead to loosening and loss of the affected teeth.

This infection is a key cause of dental implant failure whereby the induced inflammatory changes in the soft tissues surrounding oral implants lead to a progressive destruction of the supporting bone (classified as peri-implantitis and seen in up to 43% of implant-treated subjects) or soft tissues (classified as peri-implant mucositis and seen in up to 50% of implant-treated subjects) [19] . Current forms of treatment are often inadequate and may result in chronic infection requiring implant removal and costly resective and regenerative procedures in an attempt to restore and reshape the implant-supporting tissue [19] .

However, they do not necessarily kill the microorganisms within the biofilm. In contrast, agents classified as antimicrobial act by inhibiting the growth of (bacteriostatic) or killing (bactericidal) microorganisms, which are defined as minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC) or minimum bactericidal concentration (MBC), respectively. The uptake and penetration of antimicrobial agents into biofilms are key considerations in the administration of therapeutics [21] . This is of particular importance within the oral cavity when these agents have to reach less accessible stagnation sites or through plaque to the enamel. The development of plaque control measures that require a minimum of patient compliance and professional healthcare intervention are therefore of particular interest [22] . Within this context, antimicrobial nanoparticles may be of particular value if retained at approximal teeth surfaces and below the gum margin. The anticaries potential of fluoride and other conventional antimicrobial/antiplaque agents, which are mostly deployed in mouthwashes and toothpastes, have been well characterized [16] . The potential of nanoparticles as constituents of topical agents to control oral biofilms through either their biocidal or antiadhesive capabilities has now emerged as an area that should be given serious consideration. The studies by Robinson and coworkers using the \"Leeds in situ model,\" a device that allows dental plaque to develop in situ on a removable human enamel surface, have helped in the assessment of novel antimicrobial agents and take into account the extremely complex microbial composition and architecture of plaque biofilms [23] . The use of such intact biofilms on natural tooth surfaces would be of particular value to a study of the penetration of nanoparticles and released ions. This model has indicated that plaque contains voids and channels, sometimes extending completely through the biomass to the underlying enamel [24] and may have considerable influence on the transfer of nanoparticles through biofilms. The main considerations are the physical and chemical characteristics of the particular nanoparticles used, including the surface charge and degree of hydrophobicity, the surface area-to-mass ratio of the plaque biofilm and the ability of the particles to adsorb to/be taken up at the biofilm surface. Within this context nanoparticles are potentially useful because it is possible to alter their surface charge, hydrophobicity, and other physical and chemical characteristics [25] .",

An inverse relationship between the size of nanoparticles and antimicrobial activity has been clearly demonstrated, where particles in the size range of 1 2 10 nm have been shown to have the greatest biocidal activity against bacteria [3, 32] . Indeed, it has been shown that smaller silver nanoparticles are more toxic than larger particles, more so when oxidized [33] . At the nanoscale, Ag 1 ions are known to be released (leached) from the surface [34] . Sotiriou et al.

It has been demonstrated that the shape of silver nanoparticles can influence antimicrobial activity, as has been shown in the case of Escherichia coli [37] .

The high reactivity of nanotitanium dioxide and nanosilicon dioxide (SiO 2 ) is exploited extensively for their bactericidal properties in filters and coatings on substrates such as polymers, ceramics, glasses, and alumina [39] . Significant activity using metal and metal oxide nanoparticles and their compound clusters against fungal and bacterial pathogens such as meticillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) and E. coli has been demonstrated.

For example, new broad-spectrum materials (5 2 60 nm) can reduce virus levels by 80% 2 100% through direct or indirect contact.

Silver also exhibits a strong affinity for zeolite, a porous crystalline material of hydrated aluminosilicate which can bind up to 40% Ag 1 ions within its structure. Silver zeolite has been incorporated into tissue conditioners, acrylic resins, and mouth rinses within the dental field [43\u00c046]. Silver nanoparticles ( Fig. 10 .1C), either alone or together with other antimicrobial agents, have shown particularly encouraging results [27, 47, 48] . The use of silver salt nanoparticles instead of elemental silver or complex silver compounds to prevent biofilm formation on surfaces for both biomedical and more general use has been investigated. Using silver bromide precipitation to synthesize polymer-nanocomposites, surfaces comprised of this material were shown to resist biofilm formation.

The mechanism of the antimicrobial activity of silver is not completely understood, but is likely to involve multiple targets in comparison to the more defined targets of antibiotics. Studies have shown that the positive charge on the Ag 1 ion is critical for antimicrobial activity, allowing the electrostatic attraction between the negative charge of the bacterial cell membrane and positively charged nanoparticles [36] . In regards to molecular mechanisms of the inhibitory action of Ag 1 ions on microorganisms, it has been shown that DNA loses its ability to replicate [50] , and the expression of ribosomal subunit proteins and other cellular proteins and enzymes necessary for ATP production become inactive [51] . It has also been hypothesized that Ag 1 ions affect membrane-bound respiratory enzymes [52] . However, the precise mechanism(s) of biocidal activity of silver nanoparticles against bacteria remains to be fully elucidated. The work of Sondi and Salopek-Sondi [27] demonstrated structural changes and damage to bacterial membranes resulting in cell death. These particular studies suggest that sulfur-containing proteins in the membrane or inside the cells and phosphorus-containing elements, such as DNA, are likely to be the preferential binding sites for silver nanoparticles. The contribution of Ag 1 ion release from nanoparticles to the overall antimicrobial activity remains unclear. It is suggested that a bacterial cell in contact with silver nanoparticles will take up Ag 1 ions, which possibly in turn will inhibit respiratory enzymes and so help to generate free radicals, and subsequent free-radical-induced damage to the cell membrane. In order to determine the relationship between free-radical formation and antimicrobial activity, the use of antioxidants suggests that free radicals may be derived from the surface of silver nanoparticles [36] .",

The bactericidal effect of the nanoparticles was compared using disc diffusion tests and MIC and MBC determinations. Bacterial sensitivity was found to differ according to the species tested and the test system employed. For all strains of S. aureus and E. coli, the action of silver nanoparticles was found to be superior. Strain-specific variation for S. aureus was negligible, while some strainspecific variation was observed for E. coli. A higher sensitivity, as shown with B. subtilis, may be attributed to more amine and carboxyl groups (in comparison to other species) on the cell surface; these groups having a greater affinity for copper [57] . Released copper ions within the cell may then disrupt nucleic acid and key enzymes [58] . In theory, a combination of silver and copper nanoparticles may give rise to a more complete bactericidal effect, especially against a mixed population of bacteria. Indeed, the studies of Ren et al. [40] demonstrated that populations of Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria could be reduced by 68% and 65%, respectively, in the presence of 1.0 mg/mL nano copper oxide within 2 hours.

TiO 2 is widely used in a number of applications, as a powder and increasingly in a nanoparticulate form, and is generally considered to be nontoxic at the concentrations normally employed. The antimicrobial properties of TiO 2 are related to its crystal structure, shape, and size [78] . However, there are concerns that nanotitanium oxide may present a hazard to health through inflammation as generated by the release of IL-1\u03b1 [79] . The anatase form of nano-TiO 2 and UV light excitation are required to ensure maximum antimicrobial activity. TiO 2 photocatalysis is able to promote the peroxidation of the polyunsaturated phospholipid component of the microbial lipid membrane, induce loss of respiratory activity, and elicit cell death [80] . The study of Tsuang et al. [81] demonstrated TiO 2 -mediated photocatalytic and bactericidal activities against obligate aerobes (P. aeruginosa), facultative anaerobes (S. aureus, E. coli, and Enterococcus hirae) and obligate anaerobes (Bacteroides fragilis). Concentrations of titanium oxide (predominantly anatase phase; in the absence of UV light; particle size: approximately 18 nm; surface area: 87 m 2 /g) required to have a growth-inhibitory and killing effect against a range of pathogens including E. coli and MRSA have been shown to be 1.0\u00c02.5 and .2.5 mg/mL. respectively (K. Memarzadeh and R.P. Allaker 2012, unpublished observations). Meanwhile, with those organisms implicated in oral infections, including A. actinomycetemcomitans, P. gingivalis, P. intermedia, and F. nucleatum, growth-inhibitory and killing concentrations under anaerobic conditions are in the same order at 0.25\u00c02.5 and .2.5 mg/mL, respectively [41] .",

The study of Ahn et al.

No significant difference between ECAs and conventional adhesives was shown as regards bond shear strength.

Both chitosan nano-and microparticles have been investigated as a potential platform for local delivery of drugs [103] . Chitosan nanoparticles are effective against a variety of microorganisms, and this effect can be further enhanced when silver salts are added [104] . Although antimicrobial irrigants (without chitosan), as employed to disinfect root canals in the treatment of endodontic infections are capable of killing E. faecalis, the bacterium frequently associated with this condition, endodontic restorations often fail [105] . The in vitro study of Kishen et al.

In theory, such surface treatment could prevent bacterial recolonization and biofilm formation in vivo.

Companies have used silica (silicon dioxide \"SiO 2 \" and often classed as \"microfine,\" but with a particle size within the definition of nanoparticles) in toothpastes for many years, and some have actively sought new directions in this area through the use of porous silicon and nanocrystalline silicon technology to carry and deliver antimicrobials, for example, triclosan. These may well offer advantages to some of the slower and more prolonged delivery systems under investigation. The use of silica nanoparticles to polish the tooth surface may help protect against damage by cariogenic bacteria, presumably because the bacteria can more easily be removed. This has been investigated on human teeth ex vivo [109] . Atomic force microscopy demonstrated lower nanometer-scale roughness obtained when silica nanoparticles were used to polish the surface of teeth as compared with conventional polishing pastes. It was also shown that adherent S. mutans could be more easily removed. However, concerns remain as to the longevity of the effect, and whether the polished surface will inhibit mineralization and plaque formation in vivo. Spherical silica nanoparticles (up to 21 nm) deposited onto polystyrene surfaces by poly-cationic binding has been investigated with respect to the development of C. albicans biofilms and invasive filament formation [110] . Modified surfaces were shown to reduce attachment and growth of C. albicans, with the greatest effect observed with 7-and 14-nm particles. These effects could possibly be attributed to the surface topography or slow dissolution of the bound silica. Such treatment has the advantages of being nontoxic, simple to apply, and adaptable to three-dimensional surfaces.",

            "text": "Photodynamic therapy (PDT) is very well suited for the control of bacteria in oral plaque biofilms where there is relatively easy access for the application of the photosensitizing agent and light sources to areas requiring treatment [120] . This approach is now being utilized within the clinical setting in some countries. The killing of microorganisms with light depends upon cytotoxic singlet oxygen and free-radical generation by the excitation of a photoactivatable agent or sensitizer. The result of excitation is that the sensitizer moves from an electronic ground state to a triplet state, which then interacts with microbial components to generate cytotoxic species [121] . One of the advantages of light-activated killing is that the resistance to action of singlet oxygen is unlikely to become widespread in comparison to that experienced with more traditional chemical antimicrobial agents. A sensitizer ideally should absorb light at red to near-infrared wavelengths because these wavelengths are able to penetrate more. The most commonly tested sensitizers on bacteria have been tricyclic dyes (e.g., methylene blue, erythrosine), tetrapyrroles (e.g., porphyrins), and furocoumarins (e.g., psoralen). The use of nanoparticles within this area is now under investigation. For example, a complex of biodegradable and biocompatible poly(lactic-co-glycolic acid) and colloidal gold nanoparticles, loaded with methylene blue and exposed to red light at 665 nm, has been tested against planktonic E. faecalis and in experimentally infected root canals [122] . In theory, gold nanoparticle conjugates should have improved binding and cell wall penetration properties, and so should deliver a higher concentration of photoactive molecules. It remains to be fully established whether such conjugates will show an increased antibacterial activity when compared to more conventional treatments. Most work on light-activated killing has been performed using suspensions of planktonic bacteria, with relatively few studies observing biofilm-grown microorganisms. In vitro biofilm-grown S. mutans cells demonstrated a 3-log reduction when treated with erythrosine and white light (500\u00c0650 nm) [123] , while an approach using antibody-and erythrosine-labeled nanoparticles has shown the potential for targeting specific bacterial species in oral plaque biofilms (S. Wood et al., unpublished observations). These in vitro studies, employing constant-depth film fermenters with gold nanoparticles conjugated to erythrosine and antibody to either S. mutans or Lactobacillus casei, have shown specific killing of target organisms in mixed-biofilm cultures.",

The photosensitizer erythrosine has an advantage over other dyes because it is currently used in dentistry to visualize dental plaque in vivo, and so its lack of toxicity in the host is well established. For use in periodontitis, the dye needs to be applied subgingivally prior to fiberoptic laser light activation. However, when disease is present, the periodontal site has a marked flow of GCF into the pocket, and most photosensitizers lose some activity in the presence of extraneous protein. Also, some have virtually no effect in the presence of saliva and other body fluids. This is because the agents complex with proteins and host cells in the GCF and effectively compete for binding to bacteria. The use of nanoparticles as applied to PDT may help to overcome some of the issues associated with serum constituents.",

Testing of NO-releasing silica nanoparticles (at the highest concentration tested of 8 mg/mL) with fibroblasts demonstrated that cell proliferation was inhibited to a lesser degree than with chlorhexidine [111] . Likewise, QA-PEI nanoparticles incorporated into composite resins to restore teeth at 1% w/w demonstrate no additional toxic effects on cultured cells or experimental animal tissue in comparison to unmodified composites [94] . BG nanoparticles generally have very good biocompatibility. In vitro investigations with MG-63 osteoblast-like cells reveal a high cyto-compatibility of nanoscale BG particles [127] . In comparison to other metals, silver is less toxic to human cells, and is only ever used at very low concentrations in vivo [27] . For example, silver nanoparticles have been shown to inhibit Candida spp. at a concentration of 0.2 \u03bcg/mL, which is markedly less than the concentration (30 \u03bcg/mL) required to demonstrate a toxic effect against human fibroblasts [128] . Besides, it has been reported that by incorporating AgNPs into titanium implant material, not only the antibacterial ability of the implant is enhanced, but also the surface remains biocompatible [129] . Similarly, nZnO has been shown to possess good biocompatibility. Memarzadeh et al. studied the cytotoxicity of nZnO against UMR-106 and MG-63 cells. The results indicated that UMR-106 cells exposed to nZnO supernatants showed minimal toxicity. Similarly, MG-63 cells cultured on nZnO substrates did not show release of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-6 cytokines [74] .",

The contribution of surface charge to both mammalian and microbial interactions has been illustrated using surfactant-coated nanoparticles [132] . Antiadherent and antifungal effects were shown using buccal epithelial cells treated with nondrugloaded poly(ethylcyanoacrylate) nanoparticles. Nanoparticles were prepared using emulsion polymerization and stabilized with cationic, anionic, or nonionic surfactants. Cationic surfactants, for example, cetrimide, which are known antimicrobial agents, were the most effective in reducing C. albicans blastospore adhesion, and showed a growth-inhibitory and biocidal effect against the yeast. Production of nanoparticles with an anionic surfactant gave lower yields and wide particle size distributions. No evidence of killing against C. albicans was shown. Nonionic surfactant-coated nanoparticles produced intermediate kill rates. These studies clearly demonstrate the importance of surface charge on the nanoparticle surface. It is suggested that the buccal epithelium could possibly be treated using polymeric-type nanoparticles in a mouthwash-type formulation; in theory this would prime the potential target cells against adhesion and infection.",

It was shown that the main independent particle variables which determine compatibility are size, surface charge, and dispersibility (particularly the effect of hydrophobicity). Cationic particles or particles with a high surface reactivity are more likely to be toxic (to both eukaryotes and prokaryotes). Larger, more hydrophobic or poorly dispersed particles, which would be rapidly removed by the reticuloendothelial system, were shown to be less toxic. Karlsson et al. [62] have shown that metal oxide nanoparticles are more toxic than at first envisaged at concentrations down to 40 \u03bcg/mL and show a high variation as regards different nanoparticle species to cause cytotoxicity, DNA damage, and oxidative DNA lesions. Toxic effects on cultured cells were assessed using trypan blue staining, the comet assay to measure DNA damage, and an oxidation-sensitive fluoroprobe to quantify the production of reactive oxygen species [62] . Copper oxide was found to be the most toxic and therefore may pose the greatest health risk. Nanoparticulate ZnO and TiO 2 , both ingredients in sunscreens and cosmetics, also showed significant cytotoxic and DNA-damaging effects. The potential mechanisms of toxicity for these and other selected nanoparticles are listed in Table 10 .1.",

PEG-capped ZnO nanoparticles demonstrated an increase in antimicrobial efficacy with a reduction in particle size. Again, Gram-negative bacteria were more affected than Gram-positive, which suggests that a membrane damage mechanism of action rather than one involving the production of reactive oxygen species is of overriding significance. PEG-capped nanoparticles were found to be highly toxic to human cells with a very low concentration (at 100 \u03bcM) threshold for cytotoxic action, whereas the concentration for antibacterial activity was 50 times greater (at 5 mM).
