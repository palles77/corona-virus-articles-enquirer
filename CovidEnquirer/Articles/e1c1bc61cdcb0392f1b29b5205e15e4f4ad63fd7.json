Increasing populations, urbanization, deforestation, climate change, anti-vaccination movements, war, and international travel are some of the contributing factors to this trend. The recent Ebola, MERS-CoV, and Zika outbreaks demonstrated we are insufficiently prepared to respond with proven safe and effective countermeasures (i.e., vaccines and therapeutics). The State University of New York Upstate Medical University and the Trudeau Institute convened a summit of key opinion and thought leaders in the life sciences and biomedical research and development enterprises to explore global biopreparedness challenges, take an inventory of existing capabilities and capacities related to preparation and response, assess current ''gaps,\" and prospect what could be done to improve our position. Herein we describe the summit proceedings, ''Translational Immunology Supporting Biomedical Countermeasure Development for Emerging Vector-borne Viral Diseases,\" held October 2-3, 2018, at the Trudeau Institute in Saranac Lake, NY.",

The mission was to define today 0 s most pressing global health problems, identify critical obstacles which challenge the develop-ment of solutions to these problems, and prospect how both may be overcome. Summit sessions focused on disease preparedness and vaccine development. Summit organizers desired to catalyze the formation and sustainment of productive and strategic interdisciplinary partnerships and collaborative research networks with a focus on the rapid development of countermeasures against our most pressing global health threats. Three keynote speakers representing the International Vaccine Institute (IVI), Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations (CEPI), and the U.S. National Institutes of Health (NIH) framed four concept areas which were then discussed during two individual sessions per topic; each session was defined by a specific topic and led by a pre-selected session leader. The overall organization is presented in Box 1. The first concept discussed was, ''How do we identify and prepare for Disease X,\" referring to the next major infectious disease epidemic or pandemic. Dr. Melanie Saville, Director of Vaccine Development from CEPI, introduced the concept by discussing possible Disease X pathogens stressing they may be currently known or unknown. This may include known threats such as Ebola, known viruses with unrecognized impacts such as Zika, and unknown threats not previously identified. Current global trends indicate that a new disease emerges every four months, and more likely than not, Disease X will emerge as zoonotic in origin, as nearly 60% of all pandemics fit that model. The need to identify a burgeoning outbreak and initiate development of countermeasures was stressed. Citing a key example from the 1918 flu pandemic, which was modeled by the Vaccine Modeling Initiative and presented recently by the Gates Foundation [1] , were such a pandemic to occur today, all major cities in the world would be impacted, with 13 million dead within 60 days. A more recent example was coordination of the global response to the 2014-2016 West Africa Ebola pandemic and the challenges with fielding and testing therapeutic and vaccine candidates [2] . A review of the Ebola response produced four key recommendations: (1) strengthen humananimal surveillance systems as the first line of defense; (2) reinforce global coordination and capabilities; (3) accelerate product development, and; (4) provide economic incentives to help.",

As such, an important CEPI goal is to address both preparedness and rapid response to ''Disease X\" by leveraging pre-developed vaccine platforms such as injectable formulations of DNA, self-replicating RNA, recombinant proteins and viral vectors. It was recognized, however, that regulators license vaccines, not platforms, so even the use of well-established platforms for rapid vaccine development for an emerging virus may not allow for rapid regulatory approval and regulatory agencies vary globally. However, the use of pre-developed platforms could expedite the path from preclinical research to clinical development.",

Note added after review: The concepts discussed herein for Disease X are not limited to vector borne diseases. We deliberately chose not to include human engineered bioterrorism agents not encountered in nature, as we felt that adequate consideration would include a separate, full discussion on intelligence gathering, countermeasures, mitigation and bio-preparedness, which would be beyond the scope of the meeting agenda.",

A suggestion for improving the global biosurveillance enterprise is to transition from monitoring the advance of specific outbreaks over time (vertical surveillance) to horizontal surveillance (quantifying the presence of diverse pathogens across the population over time). Another suggestion is to create standard criteria for assessing global viral threats-tropism, replication, structure, genotype, evolution, immune evasion, pathogenesis, animal models, and correlates of protection. However, this may be difficult for viruses that can utilize a range of hosts, vectors, etc. To achieve the ultimate goal of fully implemented global health biosurveillance we should be proactive instead of reactive.

The group asked the question, ''Is there a more effective way to quantify frailty that alerts us to whom will need close monitoring during flu season?\" Vaccines against influenza are beneficial because they modify infection outcomes in addition to preventing disease. Clinical trials of universal influenza vaccine candidates should implement a validated severity score for children and adults to capture the full value of the intervention. Can metrics that provide a severity score be developed and validated? If we can sustain multiyear clinical trials, then many important questions related to the natural history of influenza infection in a population can be addressed. For example, what is the relative efficacy in individuals with pre-existing immunity (natural or through seasonal vaccination) versus na\u00efve children? What is the impact of co-infection with other pathogens during an outbreak of influenza? Is it possible to achieve sustained protection by exposure to multiple strains over years? These important objectives face the stiff reality that important endpoints beyond those strictly required for licensure are difficult to incorporate into already expensive and logistically challenging trials. Establishing field sites in low and middle-income countries for longitudinal surveillance of respiratory diseases would build globally-beneficial disease surveillance and vaccine evaluation capacity.",

One may pay particular attention to differences in how a pathogen is delivered in nature (i.e., mosquito, superficial dermis, salivary proteins) and how this may or may not translate depending on how we deliver in the context of vaccination (i.e., needle, intramuscular or subcutaneous, no salivary proteins). Note added after review: Back correlations between efficacious vaccines and mechanisms of protection should be carried out to derive correlates of protection. Alternative approaches using in vitro organoids and ex vivo studies should be used to supplement live animal models, although their role in supporting product development is uncertain. Several other parameters of animal models can be poorly reflective of the human infection and disease experience. For example, the time course of infection in animal models can be remarkably different from humans. Further, lethal challenge models (e.g., Nipah) do not provide endpoints suitable for translation to clinical trials. Model relevance was also discussed in the context of a Zika pregnancy model in immunocompetent mice, in which the infected dams did not get viremia and there was no detectable vertical transmission of virus, yet there was virtually 100% fetal demise. Monoclonal antibody blocking studies indicated that, despite the absence of productive infection, the pathology was apparently caused by virus, raising the possibility of fetal demise due to specific placental pathology [7] . There would be great value in developing high quality, standardized animal models and challenge strains of particular pathogens that are broadly accepted. Following Good Laboratory Practices within high bio-containment required for handling some pathogens is difficult and could impact countermeasure development efforts in these areas. Note added after review: Emphasis should be placed on working with biocontainment labs to get as close to GLP compliance as possible. Once a candidate vaccine or drug has entered into clinical testing or has been proven safe and effective it would valuable to go back and assess how pre-clinical animal models supported or did not support informed programmatic decision making.",

Innovative approaches such as the stepped wedge method [9] and delayed ring vaccination [10] were taken to control the vaccine trials, and efficacy was successfully demonstrated. Incorporating human challenge models into vaccine development for Disease X with high mortality can be done given: availability of a partially attenuated vaccine virus or pseudotyped attenuated virus for challenge; operation under the consideration of ''do no harm;\" and, in specific instances studying cross protection with an antigenically-related virus strategy in an emergency (example -use of approved Japanese encephalitis vaccine against the West Nile [11] [12] [13] or a chikungunya vaccine against o 0 nyong nyong) [14] .

Note added after review: However, manufacturing and facility requirements pose challenges associated with validating new processes and facilities. Vaccination of animals responsible for transmission of agents to humans can be a very effective tool to combat the spread of a pandemic, and therefore it is important to understand the natural history of the disease. Some examples were given where accessible animals play a role in amplification and could be vaccinated to interrupt a human outbreak (example -Venezuelan equine encephalitis, Rift Valley fever, Nipah virus disease). Importantly, veterinary vaccines are faster and easier to develop, and the USDA grants a conditional approval pathway. Despite the success of this approach for control of rabies, wildlife vaccination remains virtually unexplored. We have many opportunities to learn from our experience. It is important to assess effectiveness and evidence of vaccine failures. There should be more efforts to make use of studying protection against subclinical or mild infections. Finding clues to correlates of protection from such cases can be used to focus development resources more effectively. Can we use Jennerian (cross reactive) vaccines in the event of an emergency (e.g., chikungunya vaccine vs. O 0 nyong 0 nyong or Japanese encephalitis vaccine vs. West Nile)? Note added after review: The Animal Rule is reserved for drugs and vaccines in which traditional and accelerated approval pathways are not possible, and is not directly related to a time-sensitive window to prove efficacy in phase 2b trials. Also preclinical toxicology studies may be useful when negative toxicology findings have affected the decision to pursue product development.",
