The activity of known ISGs is insufficient to account for the antiretroviral effects of IFN, suggesting that ISGs with antiretroviral activity are yet to be described. We constructed an arrayed library of ISGs from rhesus macaques and tested the ability of hundreds of individual macaque and human ISGs to inhibit early and late replication steps for 11 members of the retroviridae from various host species. These screens uncovered numerous ISGs with antiretroviral activity at both the early and late stages of virus replication. Detailed analyses of two antiretroviral ISGs indicate that indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1 (IDO1) can inhibit retroviral replication by metabolite depletion while tripartite motif-56 (TRIM56) accentuates ISG induction by IFNa and inhibits the expression of late HIV-1 genes. Overall, these studies reveal numerous host proteins that mediate the antiretroviral activity of IFNs.",

Therefore, antiviral protein activity is sometimes revealed by using viral mutants or non-native viral hosts. HIV-1, for example, evades or antagonizes human APOBEC3, TRIM5a, and tetherin but is fully sensitive to these proteins in non-hominid species (Doyle et al., 2015) . Species-dependent variation in antiretroviral proteins can constitute a profound genetic barrier to interspecies retroviral transmission. Accordingly, type I IFN is a significantly more potent inhibitor of HIV-1 and SIV infection in cells of nonnative primates (Bitzegeio et al., 2013) .

We conducted these screens in two different ways. First, we used an HIV-1-based lentiviral vector (SCRPSY, Figure 1B ) to express each ISG along with TagRFP in target cells that were then challenged with GFP-encoding retroviruses or retroviral vectors. Infection was then measured using two-color flow cytometry. This ''incoming screening'' strategy ( Figure 1C ) identifies ISGs that inhibit steps in the retroviral life cycle prior to GFP expression. Second, we co-transfected an ISG-expression plasmid (pDEST40) with a plasmid(s) that generates retroviral particles, then measured the yield of infectious virions by transduction of a GFP reporter gene, or using a reporter cell line. This ''production screening'' strategy ( Figure 1D ) identifies genes that inhibit the latter stages of the retroviral life cycle. For each ISG, the fraction of infected, ISG/TagRFP-expressing cells (incoming screens) or the yield of infectious virions (production screens) was expressed as a percentage of the mean value across all wells in a given screen ( Figures 1E, 1F , 2A-2G, S1B-S1E, S2, S3, and S4).",

            "text": "The screens identified numerous ISGs that were apparently capable of inhibiting the retroviral life cycle. A number of ISGs that were known to have antiretroviral activity, including several APOBEC3 proteins, TRIM5, tetherin, MOV10, SAMHD1, CNP, and Mx2, were identified in the appropriate incoming or production screens (Figures 1, 2 , S1, S2, and S3; Table S5 ), suggesting that this approach is a powerful way to identify antiviral genes. Many additional ISGs whose expression conferred either resistance to incoming retroviral infection or reduced the production of infectious retroviral particles were identified. Some ISGs appeared to be specific inhibitors of one or a few retroviruses, while others were broadly inhibitory. As examples, OASL inhibited the production of infectious prototypic foamy virus (PFV) virions, and ULK4 inhibited the production of feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV), but OASL and ULK4 had no activity against other retroviruses. Conversely, macaque SLFN12 inhibited the production of all retroviruses (Figures 1,  2 , S1, S2, and S3; Table S5 ). Overall, 60% of ISGs were hits against a single retrovirus, and the remainder targeted multiple retroviruses. In general, a greater number of ISGs were more potently inhibitory in production screens than in the incoming screens. This finding may result from potentially higher ISG protein levels associated with transient transfection, or may be due to the greater number and complexity of events associated with the late, as opposed to the early, steps of retroviral replication. A number of ISGs appeared to exert antiretroviral activity in a species-dependent manner. For example, human, but not macaque, ANGTPL1 inhibited SIVmac production, while macaque, but not human, IRF2 inhibited HIV-1 infection in human MT4 cells (Figures S1E-S1F and S4; Table S5 ). More than one-third of the ''hits'' were identified exclusively using our macaque ISG library (Table S5 ), but further work is required to determine which of these candidates have genuine species-dependent antiretroviral activity.",

Interestingly, more ISGs were protective in THP-1 cells than in MT4 cells, even though MT4 cells were more efficiently transduced with the ISG-encoding vectors (Figures 1 and S1; Table  S2 ). Ten ISGs conferred >10-fold protection against infection by at least one primate lentivirus in THP-1 cells but conferred minimal or no protection in MT4 cells (Figures 1, S1 , S2, and S3). These genes (cGAS, RIPK2, TLR7, IRF7, TRIM5,  TRIM38, MYD88, IL1R, LGALS9, and IFI16) included ISGs known to mediate pattern recognition and inflammatory signaling.

Overexpression screening can also lead to inhibition resulting from unnatural perturbation of cell physiology. ISGs that inhibit one or a few retroviruses are less likely to exert their effects through regulatory or nonspecific mechanisms. However, ISGs with broad activity (e.g., tetherin) can also have important effects. Validation and characterization of all the candidate antiretroviral ISGs identified herein would take many years. We therefore adopted a targeted approach to identify ISGs that (1) act directly to inhibit viral replication or (2) act as regulators of the antiviral state. Importantly, we sought to identify ISGs that affected retrovirus replication at native expression levels. Multiple ISGs that stimulated ISRE or IFNb promoter activity were identified using this approach. An example was TRIM38, whose expression activated the IFNb promoter ( Figure 3A ; Tables S3 and S4). Both human and macaque variants of TRIM38 conferred substantial protection against infection with HIV-1, HIV-2, and SIVmac when expressed in THP-1 cells (5-to 10-fold), but not in MT4 cells (Figures 1, S1 , S2, and S3). These findings suggest that TRIM38 may participate in pattern recognition or signaling pathways that lead to type I IFN expression and consequently to inhibition of retroviral infection. As such, this and other proteins identified in this screen are worthy of further investigation as proteins that may regulate IFN expression.",

From a list of ISGs that conferred >2-fold protection in any incoming HIV-1 or HIV-2 screen, we selected genes that did not stimulate IFNb-promoter or ISRE driven reporter expression (Figures 3A and 3B; Tables S3  and S4 ). Thereafter, we determined infectious titers of HIV-1 and HIV-2 on MT4 and THP-1 cells expressing these ISGs (Figures 3C and 3D) . This analysis confirmed the activity of ISGs known to inhibit incoming HIV-1 and HIV-2 infection (such as TRIM5 and Mx2) as well as a number of ISGs for which anti HIV-1 or HIV-2 activity was not previously described (e.g., IDO1, BCL3, LGALS9, and C5orf39) ( Figures 3C and 3D ). Despite our attempts to focus this sub-screen on directly acting ISGs, several genes that only conferred protection in THP-1 cells, such as cGAS, human TRIM5, and TLRs 3 and 7, likely act by inducing an antiviral state, even though they did not activate IFNb or ISRE reporters ( Figures  3A and 3B ). Nevertheless, one ISG that had anti-HIV-1 activity only in THP-1 cells, CDKN1A, may exert its effect by decreasing SAMHD1 phosphorylation (Pauls et al., 2014) . Thus, certain ISGs may exert antiretroviral activity, contingent on cofactors that are expressed in a cell-type-dependent manner. ",

IDO1 encodes indoleamine 2,3-dioxygenase 1, which catalyzes the initial ratelimiting step in the conversion of L-tryptophan (L-Trp) to kynurenine (Hayaishi, 1976) . Although IDO1 expression is upregulated by type I IFNs, the magnitude of its induction by IFNg is clearly greater (Hassanain et al., 1993) . Notably, IDO1 expression is profoundly upregulated during HIV-1 infection (Favre et al., 2010) . IDO1 was active in incoming screens against a number of retroviruses but appeared most potent against HIV-2 ( Figures 1F, 2 , S1, S2, and S3; Table S5 ). Interestingly, it reduced both the intensity and the number of EGFP-positive cells (Figures 4A and 4B) and was effective in MT4 cells, but not THP-1 cells (that were less efficiently transduced) ( Figure 1 ). We generated MT4 cells that inducibly expressed IDO1 (Busnadiego et al., 2014) at levels similar to those in IFNg-treated A549 cells (in which IFNg is known to stimulate IDO1 expression) ( Figure 4C ). In single-cycle infection assays, IDO1 expression in target cells inhibited incoming HIV-2 infection by 5-fold but did not inhibit HIV-1 infection ( Figure 4D ). However, in spreading replication assays, IDO1 reduced the number of HIV-1-infected cells by >10-fold for several days ( Figure 4E ). Correspondingly, the yield of infectious HIV-1 or HIV-2 progeny virions, harvested 44 hr after infection, was reduced by 50-to 100-fold, by IDO1, similar to the reduction conferred by rhTRIM5a over a single replication cycle ( Figure 4F ). Western blot analyses revealed that IDO1 caused a substantial reduction in HIV-1 Gag, Env, and Nef protein levels, and a corresponding reduction in extracellular particulate CA ( Figures 4G and 4H ). Thus, IDO1 appears to act by inhibiting viral protein production, and its identification in an incoming screen was the result of reduced reporter gene expression.",

Single-cycle HIV-1 replication was inhibited when cells MT4 expressing inducible IDO1 were mixed with unmodified cells, even when <50% cells expressed IDO1 ( Figure 4I ). This finding suggested that IDO1 inhibits HIV-1 through L-Trp catabolites or by L-Trp depletion, rather than the direct action of the IDO1 protein. Moreover, 1-methyl-L-tryptophan (1-MT), a competitive inhibitor of IDO1 enzymatic activity, substantially reversed the anti-HIV-1 effect of IDO1 ( Figure 4J ). Crucially, L-Trp supplementation fully restored IDO1-inhibited HIV-1 Gag expression and infectious particle generation ( Figure 4K ). In the absence of IDO1, treatment with 1-MT or additional L-Trp had little influence on infectious progeny virion yield ( Figure S5A and S5B). Because L-Trp supplementation should not prevent the formation of IDO1-specific catabolites, IDO1 appears to inhibit HIV-1 through L-Trp depletion.",

IDO1 is induced in antigen-presenting cells (APCs) following HIV-1 infection in vivo or IFNg stimulation in vitro (Favre et al., 2010), but most immortalized cell lines do not respond to IFNg in this way. Therefore, we used A549 cells, which, unusually, exhibit robust IDO1 induction following IFNg treatment ( Figure 5A ). IFNg treatment of A549 cells conferred only 2-to 3-fold protection from incoming pseudotyped HIV-1 infection ( Figure 5B ). In contrast, IFNg caused up to 100-fold reduction in HIV-1 infectious virion yield from infected A549 cells in a single cycle of replication ( Figure 5C ). Addition of L-Trp or 1-MT increased the yield of infectious HIV-1 from IFNg-treated A549 cells by 10-fold ( Figure 5D ) but did not have this effect in the absence of IFNg ( Figure S4C) . A similar L-Trp induced rescue of infectious virion yield occurred with IFNg-treated TZM-bl cells, a commonly used HIV-1 indicator cell line ( Figures 5D-5F and S5D). Thus, IDO1-induced nutrient (L-Trp) depletion is responsible for a substantial fraction of the anti-HIV-1 activity of IFNg in A549 and TZM-bl cells.",

HIV-1 replication in GHOSTX4 cells is resistant to inhibition by IFNa (our unpublished data), so this strategy could, in principle, capture ISGs that regulate the antiviral state, or directly inhibit late HIV-1 replication steps. Most of the selected ISGs modestly inhibited HIV-1 replication GHOSTX4 cells ( Figures 6A and  6B ), but one ISG, TRIM56, substantially delayed HIV-1 spread ( Figure 6A ). TRIM56 has previously been reported to inhibit the replication of some, but not all, RNA viruses through mechanisms that are unclear (Liu et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2011) . In our screens, TRIM56 greatly inhibited the production of infectious HIV-1 and HERV-K virions and exhibited weak activity against HIV-2 in incoming screens (Figures 1E, 1F, and 2D) .",

Replication was eventually detected in some GHOST-TRIM56 clones ( Figure 6E ), and virions harvested from these cells were used to initiate an iterative passage series in GHOSTX4-TRIM56#2 cells ( Figure 6H ). After eight passages, replication was only modestly delayed in GHOSTX4-TRIM56#2 cells. Sequence analysis of a full-length molecular clone of the adapted virus (termed HIV-1/TRIM56R) revealed numerous mutations including a frameshift in Vif and missense mutations in Gag, Pol, Vpr, Tat, Rev, and Env ( Figure 6I ). In single-cycle replication experiments, the yield of WT HIV-1 virions was diminished in the TRIM56-expressing clones, while HIV-1/TRIM56R yielded similar levels of virions from control and TRIM56-expressing cells ( Figure 6J ). Unlike WT HIV-1, the cloned HIV-1/TRIM56R virus replicated robustly in GHOSTX4-TRIM56#2 cells ( Figure 7A ) and with slightly faster kinetics than WT HIV-1 in unmodified GHOSTX4 cells. Analysis of chimeric proviruses containing either the 5 0 or 3 0 half of the HIV-1/TRIM56R genome (5 0 R and 3 0 R; Figure 6I ) suggested that TRIM56 resistance mapped to the 3 0 R region ( Figure 7B ). Further analysis of chimeric viruses containing elements from 3 0 R indicated that the TRIM56 resistant phenotype could not be mapped to a single determinant (our unpublished data). Nevertheless, a single substitution in the HIV-1 Env gene (T6421A, Env N67K) present in 3 0 R enabled some level of replication in GHOSTX4-TRIM56 cells ( Figure 7B ). When the T6421A mutation was combined with mutations in 5 0 R (generating HIV-1 5 0 R-6421), the HIV-1/TRIM56R virus phenotype was reproduced. Attempts to map determinants within 5 0 R conferring TRIM56 resistance upon HIV-1 5 0 R-6421 again indicated that multiple determinants in 5 0 R contributed to the HIV-1/TRIM56R phenotype (our unpublished data). Thus, the ability of the HIV-1/TRIM56R virus to replicate in GHOSTX4-TRIM56#2 cells was conferred by the cumulative effect of multiple mutations and not governed by a single viral gene.",

All control MT4/LTR-GFP clones expressed equivalent levels of TRIM56, while the TRIM56 targeted clones expressed greatly reduced or undetectable levels of TRIM56 ( Figure 7C ). HIV-1 replicated with nearly identical kinetics in each of the cell clones ( Figure 7D ), indicating that they were equally permissive and that endogenous TRIM56 does not inhibit HIV-1 replication ( Figure 7D ). Strikingly, however, in the presence of IFNa, which elevated the level of TRIM56 expression 2-fold (Figures S7A and S7B), replication was inhibited to a far greater extent in unedited clones compared to clones in which TRIM56 was disrupted.",

A microarray analysis of the four control and sevevn TRIM56 knockout MT4 clones, focusing on the 120 most highly IFNa-induced ISGs, revealed that, despite variation among individual cell clones, basal ISG expression (i.e., in the absence of IFN) was generally unaffected by TRIM56 ( Figure 7F ). In contrast, following IFNa treatment, many ISGs were expressed at higher levels in control than in TRIM56 knockout clones ( Figure 7G ). These genes included several that were hits in our screens ( Figure 1C ), as well as known antiretroviral genes, including APOBEC3G, Mx2, MOV10, and IFITM3.

Previously, we conducted a narrowly focused incoming screen that tested the ability of human ISGs to inhibit HIV-1 (Schoggins et al., 2011) . Notably, those results are generally consistent with this study, with five of seven ISGs re-identified in this study. However, in this study we identified many additional candidate anti-retroviral genes, a large number of which have not previously been reported to have antiretroviral activity. In general, our findings underscore the complexity of the interferon response with respect to inhibition of retroviral replication and suggest that the antiretroviral activity of type I IFN is mediated and regulated through the action of many ISGs (Table S5) . Some ISGs appeared to act in a retrovirus-specific manner, while others had broad activity (Table S5 ). We also found some discrepancies in the antiretroviral activity between human and macaque variants of ISGs, which may contribute to the species-dependent barriers to retroviral replication that can be erected by type I IFN treatment (Bitzegeio et al., 2013) . However, a caveat is that the screens were conducted in human cells, and it is possible that some ISGs may only function properly in cells of species from which they originate. Clearly, some of the genes identified herein act to enhance or modify signaling pathway rather than as directly antiviral proteins, while others appear to have direct antiviral activity. To characterize all of the candidate antiretroviral genes identified herein would take many years. Thus, we have focused on a small number of ISGs, as proofof-principle of the usefulness of this strategy. Expression screens such as those reported herein are a powerful tool, but have weaknesses, including the potential for overexpression artifacts. However, we emphasize the fact that endogenous levels of two host factors we identify characterized herein can cause inhibition of retroviral replication. These two ISGs contribute to the anti-HIV-1 activity of IFNs via completely different mechanisms.",

The observation that exogenous L-Trp can relieve inhibition by IDO1 and IFNg strongly suggests that IDO1 inhibits HIV-1 through L-Trp depletion rather than through the generation of catabolites such as kynurenine. Nutrient-depletion is a recognized antipathogen strategy and similar effects of IDO1 have been noted for other pathogens including measles virus and hepatitis B virus (Mao et al., 2011; Obojes et al., 2005) . Indeed, SAMHD1, an IFNinducible deoxynucleoside triphosphate (dNTP) triphosphohydrolase that is also active against HIV-1, acts by depleting essential substrates required for retrovirus replication (Goldstone et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "A simple explanation for the effects of IDO1 is that L-Trp depletion could inhibit HIV-1 by limiting the availability of L-Trp for nascent viral protein synthesis. However, it is also true that T cells can actively respond to L-Trp depletion by activating GCN2 and mTOR signaling pathways (Cobbold et al., 2009; Munn et al., 2005) , which could potentially impact viral gene expression. Importantly, it is plausible that L-Trp could be sufficiently depleted in T cells in vivo to exert an antiretroviral effect. IDO1 is expressed at very high levels in APCs in HIV-1-infected patients (Favre et al., 2010) , and abundant IDO1 is observed in the lymph nodes of SIV-infected macaques (Estes et al., 2006) . Efficient local depletion of L-Trp by APCs could therefore inhibit HIV-1 replication in neighboring CD4+ T cells. Notably, IDO1 is sufficiently active during chronic HIV-1 infection that serum L-Trp can be 50% lower than in healthy controls (reviewed in Murray, 2003) . To impact serum L-Trp levels, extreme local depletion of L-Trp likely occurs in the microenvironments (i.e., lymphoid tissues) that support viral replication. Crucially, such local depletion of L-Trp is observed in vivo. GCN2 is activated by L-Trp depletion to levels around 20-fold lower than in normal serum and this IDO-dependent GCN2 activation is readily observed in vivo (Munn et al., 2005) . Thus, tissue microenvironments likely experience L-Trp depletion to an extent that could suppress HIV-1 replication.",

            "text": "Our screens uncovered two antiretroviral TRIM proteins, TRIM38 and TRIM56, that appear to act by regulating the establishment of an antiviral state. Other TRIM proteins can stimulate cell responses to pathogens, including TRIM25, which induces ubiquitination of RIG-I (Gack et al., 2007) , and TRIM5, which has been implicated in promoting inflammatory transcription (Pertel et al., 2011) . Overexpression screens have suggested that other TRIM proteins have antiretroviral activity, through unknown mechanisms (Uchil et al., 2008) . While overexpressed TRIM56 did not appear to function through IFNb or ISRE promoter elements, endogenous TRIM56 both increased the expression of many ISGs in response to IFNa and enhanced the establishment of an anti-HIV-1 state. Moreover, modest TRIM56 overexpression caused dramatic inhibition of HIV-1 replication. It is likely that these findings are causally related, although we cannot exclude the possibility that these reflect distinct activities of TRIM56, as the signaling and directly antiviral activities of tetherin and TRIM5 are clearly separable functions APOBEC3G  APOL3  C14ORF149  C19ORF66  C5ORF39  CACNA1I  CCL3L1  CCL4L1  CD38  CD68  CHMP5  CHRNB1  CSAG1  CSAG3A  CSAG3B  CT45A1  CT45A4  CT45A5  CXCL10  DDX58  DHX58  EIF2AK2  ENPP2  EPSTI1  FHL3  FLJ32255  FXYD6  GCA  GCH1  GCNT2  HAPLN3  HESX1  HS.458448  HSH2D  IFI16  IFI27  IFI27L1  IFI35  IFI44  IFI44L  IFI6  IFIH1  IFIT1  IFIT2  IFIT3  IFITM1  IFITM2  IFITM3  IL29  IRF7  IRF9  ISG15  ISG20  KIAA1618  LACTB  LAP3  LBA1  LOC100128274  LOC100131091  LOC100133005  LOC147645  LOC389386  LOC643384  LOC643624  LOC643977  LOC644423  LOC647942  LOC728835  LY6E  MOV10  MVP  MX2  MYD88  NAPSB  NFKBIE  NMI  NT5C3  NUB1  OAS1  OAS2  OASL  PARP10  PARP10  PDGFRL  PHF11  PLEKHA4  PLSCR1  PRIC285  PRICKLE1  PSMB9  RAB7L1  RARRES3  RASGRP3  RBCK1  RBM43  RTP4  SAMD9  SAMD9L  SLFN13  SLFN5  SP100  SP110  SP140  SPN  STAT1  STAT2  STMN2  TDRD7  TMEM140  TNFSF10  TNFSF13B  TRAFD1  TRIM21  TRIM22  UBA7  UBE2L6  UNC93B1  WARS  ZBTB32  ZNFX1   10   100   1000   10000   100000 Expression level (a.u.) (Gal\u00e3 o et al., Pertel et al., 2011) . Previously, TRIM56 has been reported to inhibit the replication of several RNA viruses, while other RNA viruses are unaffected (Liu et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2011) ; it has also been reported to enhance cellular responsiveness to TLR3 signaling by binding to TRIF (Shen et al., 2012) and to enhance IFNb production in response to dsDNA by binding to and ubiquitinating STING (Tsuchida et al., 2010) . Our data are not consistent with an important role for STING-induced IFN expression as a key mediator of TRIM56 antiretroviral activity, because anti-HIV-1 activity of overexpressed TRIM56 was observed in cells that do not express STING and cGAS, and endogenous TRIM56 only exerted anti-HIV-1 activity and enhanced ISG expression following IFNa treatment. STINGindependent TRIM56 antiviral activity has also been reported for influenza viruses (Liu et al., 2016) . Further work will be required to determine precisely how TRIM56 functions to inhibit HIV-1 replication and whether any previously described properties are relevant to its antiretroviral activity. The consequences of ISG expression (such as nutrient depletion) are expected to have fitness costs for the host. However, if those costs are temporary, and smaller than those imposed by viral infection, then ISG expression is ultimately beneficial to the host. Thus, these data highlight the need for caution when contemplating therapeutic interventions designed to modulate the consequences of HIV-1 infection. Multiple ISGs that are associated with immune activation, illness, and disease progression during chronic infection likely also mediate suppression of HIV-1 replication. While the antiretroviral activities of ISGs are unable to tip the balance in favor of the host during natural HIV-1 infection, it is clear the IFNs can slow or ameliorate disease in HIV-1 and other retroviral infections. The findings reported herein should inform future efforts to understand the molecular basis by which IFNs shape susceptibility to retroviral infection, disease progression, cross-species transmission, and retroviral emergence.",

When viral spread became evident in GHOSTX4-TRIM56#2 cells (>50% GFP+ cells) viral supernatant from GHOSTX4-TRIM56#2 cells was filtered and used to inoculate fresh cultures of GHOSTX4 and GHOSTX4-TRIM56#2 (MOI=0.01-0.02). After 8 passages in GHOSTX4-TRIM56#2 cells, a full length HIV-1 clone was derived from infected GHOSTX4-TRIM56#2 cells by extracting genomic DNA (Qiagen QIAamp DNA Mini Kit) from the cells when they were 50% GFP positive and amplifying the integrated viral DNA in two portions. The 5'half was amplified using HIV-1 specific primers from the 5'LTR to the EcoRI site in vpr, the 3' half was amplified using HIV-1 specific primers from the EcoRI site in vpr to the end of the 3'LTR. The amplified 5' and 3' portions of TRIM56R were then used to generate chimeric proviral plasmids containing portions of HIV-1/NL4-3 and HIV-1/TRIM56R.",

Suspension rhesus 221 cells (RPMI supplemented with IL-2 and 17% FBS) and human MT4 and THP-1 cells were maintained in RPMI supplemented with 10% FBS and gentamicin. MT4-LTR-GFP indicator cells were generated by transduction with a lentivirus derived from pSIR LTR-GFP, a self-inactivating MLV reporter construct containing a cassette in which hrGFP expression is driven by the HIV-1 LTR. A single cell clone was generated by limiting dilution and maintained in 2.5\u00b5g/ml puromycin. ISG-expressing MT4 and GHOSTX4 cell lines were modified using lentiviral vectors. Limiting dilution was also used to generate a panel of GHOSTX4 cells, modified to express TRIM56.

            "text": "An HIV-1 based vector pSCRPSY-DEST used to express the ISGs was based on a previously described HIV-1 based vector, pV1/hrGFP (Zennou and Bieniasz, 2006) . pSCRPSY-DEST (GenBank accession KT368137) consists of a minimal packageable HIV-1 genome containing all essential cis-acting sequences with Gateway att R and SfiI restriction sites inserted in place of Nef, and a TagRFP-2A-Puro R cassette inserted in place of a deleted fragment containing gag, pol, vif and vpr genes. The vpu and env genes are also deleted or inactivated. Thus, cells transduced with pSCRPSY-DEST express HIV-1 Tat and Rev and any cDNA inserted into the DEST sequences from completely spliced 'early' HIV-1 transcripts, while TagRFP and PAC (Puro R ) are expressed from a late, unspliced HIV-1 transcript PAC2ATagRFP where PAC and TagRFP proteins are separated by a FMDV 2A stop-start peptide.In pilot experiments this vector format minimized the number of cells that expressed the transduction marker (TagRFP) but did not express a gene inserted into the DEST sites (typically EGFP).Using the same criteria used to select human ISGs (Dittmann et al., Schoggins et al., 2011) , primer pairs were designed to amplify ~600 different macaque genes by RT-PCR. In order to target genuine orthologous transcripts, multiple primer pairs were designed based on transcript variants of the most significant BLAST match of the rhesus macaque (M. mulatta) genome using human reference sequence ISGs as probes. Directional SfiI restriction sites and 4 additional nucleotides were appended to the forward SfiI oligos (5'-CTCTGGCCGAGAGGGCCATG-3') and the final 3 nucleotides of the SfiI site provided Kozak consensus sequences for the macaque ISGs. The reverse oligo also contained 4 additional nucleotides (5'-TCTCGGCCAGAGAGGCCTTA-3') and were immediately followed by the reverse complement of the ISG stop codon (ochre/UAA in this example). Each oligo also contained ~25 nucleotides complementary to the macaque ISG target. In total 864 primer pairs were designed and subsequently synthesized by Operon. IFN#-stimulated (1000 units/ml) FRhK4, LL-CMK2 and 221 cells were used as a source of macaque RNA (M. mulatta) for cDNA synthesis (superscript III). Pooled RNA from cells stimulated for 4, 16 and 24 hours was used. Each gene was PCR amplified using Pfu polymerase and reactions that did not yield the expected amplicon were repeated using Taq polymerase. PCR amplicons were conventionally cloned into a Gateway\u00ae (Invitrogen) compatible entry vector modified to contain directional sfiI sites. ISGs were subsequently sequence verified (Genewiz). ISG ORFs were selected for the library that either matched the amino acid sequence of NCBI macaque entries or yielded at least two clones with identical amino acid sequences. Selected ORFs were subcloned into pSCRPSY-DEST and pcDNA-",
