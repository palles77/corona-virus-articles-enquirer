            "text": "Bovine coronavirus (BCV) is a member of the Coronaviridae, possessing a single-stranded, nonsegmented RNA genome of positive polarity (7). The virion contains four major structural proteins: the nucleocapsid protein (N), the transmembrane glycoprotein (M), the spike glycoprotein (S), and the hemagglutinin/esterase glycoprotein (HE) (2). BCV binds to receptors on erythrocytes and possesses a receptor-destroying enzyme similar to the HEF glycoprotein of influenza C virus (3-72). The receptor-destroying activity of the HEF protein is associated with the acetylesterase (AE), which hydrolyzes an ester linkage to release the acetyl group from position C-9 of N-acetyl-9-O-acetylneuraminic acid (3-5, 7). The 9-0-acetyl residue is crucial for influenza C virus recognition of the glycoprotein receptor, a major determinant for viral attachment to cells and initiation of viral infection (73). By analogy to influenza C virus, the BCV HE is probably involved in virus attachment and entry during the infectious process in addition to the S glycoprotein. Recently, the BCV HE protein was shown to induce neutralizing antibodies both in vitro and in viva (74, 75). Four neutralizing epitopes were found on the HE protein of the BCV-Quebec strain, however, their locations and functional properties such as receptor-binding and receptor-destroying activities were not defined (75). The HE protein is N-glycosylated with a molecular weight of 62 to 65",

The genome of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) A59 contains an open reading frame (ORF) coding for an HE protein. However, this protein is not expressed in infected cells (20, 27) . The HE protein of MHV-JHM was shown to have AE activity (22). It was assumed that the HE gene is not required for viral infectivity in MVH-A59 and MHV-JHM (27). Clearly, the role of the HE glycoprotein in coronavirus evolution, replication, and pathogenesis remains enigmatic.",

All of the HE genes contained a large ORF of 1272 nt encoding a predicted protein of 424 amino acid residues, which has a calculated molecular weight of approximately 42.5 kDa. The only variations among these sequences consisted of nucleotide sub-stitutions. Frameshift, deletion or insertion, and nonsense mutation were not observed. There were 15 nt substitutions between the virulent and the avirulent strains. Eleven of them occurred in the third codon position and did not result in amino acid changes. The HE gene sequence of the Quebec strain differed by only 1 base from that of BCV-L9 (A to T transition at nt 522) which did not cause an amino acid change. In the Mebus strain, only 1 base differed from the sequence of BCV-L9 (G to C at nt 322) resulting in a Leu to Val change at aa 103. There were several features conserved in all BCV strains: the consensus intergenic sequence CTAAAC upstream of the HE gene; two nonoverlapping internal ORFs of 408 (ORFl) and 249 (ORF2) bases; a hydrophobic putative signal sequence of 18 amino acids at the N-terminus; an extremely hydrophobic region of 26 amino acids near the C-terminus which may serve as a potential membrane-anchoring domain; a stretch of 10 hydrophilic amino acids at the C-terminus which may be the intravirion domain. The 9 potential N-linked glycosylation sites, the 14 cysteine residues, and the putative active site for neuraminate-O-acetylesterase activity, F-G-D-S, at the N-terminal of the HE peptide were conserved in all BCV strains.",

MAbs specific for the HE glycoprotein reacted differently with the two strains in HI and AEI assays ( Table 2 ). The epitopes on the HE proteins seemed to be continuous epitopes since these MAbs reacted with the HE in Westerns under denatured conditions (data not shown). These results imply that at least one epitope is located proximal to one of the three strain-specific amino acids. Importantly, the sequences of the putative esterase active domain were conserved in all virulent and avirulent BCV strains, MHV-A59, MHV-JHM, and in the influenza C virus sequenced so far. This indicates that the esterase active site is essential for the structure and function of the HE glycoprotein. However, this domain is probably not a determinant for BCVvirulence, since it is conserved in both virulent and avirulent strains. All three MAbs against HE inhibited both HA and AE activities of BCV-L9. This implies that these two activities are functionally linked to each other, however, we can not exclude the possibility that the two functional domains may be located at different regions of the HE molecule. It is worth noting that in the case of influenza (6).",

Since the S glycoprotein of coronaviruses is involved in virus attachment to permissive cells, we reexamined the possibility that the S glycoprotein may also recognize receptors on erythrocytes to facilitate hemagglutination. As shown in Table 2 , the results confirm our previous observation that the S glycoprotein of BCV-L9 is involved in agglutination of chicken erythrocytes and that this activity can be blocked by S-specific MAbs (34) . These results are also in agreement with the observation that the isolated S glycoprotein of MAbs specific for the S did not inhibit HA activity of BCV-Quebec. One possible explanation is that there is a strain difference in receptor-binding activities of S glycoproteins. This is supported by the observed differences in agglutination patterns of different BCV strains with chicken erythrocytes (Table 1 ; Storz et a/.",

This is unlikely, however, because pretreatment of the ascites with kaolin, heat, and potassium periodate did not eliminate the HI activity. These treatments were employed to eliminate nonspecific inhibitors in sera derived from humans and animals which may interfere with detection of influenza antibodies (27, 36) . The anti-S-specific MAbs did not react with the HE glycoprotein in Western blots (28). This evidence argues against the possibility that the ascites were contaminated with anti-HE MAbs. Consequently, these results suggest that the BCV S glycoprotein is involved in agglutination with chicken erythrocytes (36). This may explain why some IBV strains, which lack a HE glycoprotein, exhibit HA activity (37). The receptor determinants on chicken etythrocytes specific for BCV S protein appear to be similar to those of the HE protein (35) . However, we cannot exclude the possibility that anti-S MAbs inhibit HA activity of BCV by steric hindrance of the antibody molecule on HE protein.",
