Most, if not all, secretory tissues have a measurable rate of secretion in the absence of secretagogues (basal rate), and their secretory rate can be increased substantially in response to appropriate stimuli (stimulated rate). The terms \"constitutive\" and \"regulated\" pathways have been widely used to describe the cellular entities leading to basal and stimulated secretion (2, 3).

The released ACTH was subsequently measured quantitatively using a standard ACTH (1251) Irma adrenocorticotropin-hormone kit (Euro-Diagnostics BV, Apeldoorn, Holland). The sensitivity of the assay is 8pg/ml as judged by a 2.5 SD change of duplicate standards from zero values. Both inter-and intraassay variability was less than 10%. It should be mentioned that this kit is highly specific for ACTH1-39 and that ACTH fragments l-24, l-32 and 18-39 do not interfere with the assay. Aliquots of suspensions containing 1 X lo6 cells/ml were also incubated for different times before pH adjustment. From Figure 1 the linearity between ACTH production and time of incubation is clear.

The abovementioned finding is in agreement with previous investigations on pituitary cells, where it was found that basal secretion of neuropeptides was enriched with precursor molecules while stimulated secretion was enriched with product peptides (17, 18, 19, 20) . Subsequent investigations revealed that adjustment to pH2 alone was sufficient to produce ACTH in quantifiable amounts. This could be the result of stimulation of specific endopeptidases involved in the processing of the POMC-molecule, similar to those found in pituitary cells (21) .

This is in agreement with results observed in this study. In the present study it was also shown that ACTH production increased linearly with increasing concentrations of lymphocytes.",

From this study it was also concluded that mice, resistant to the in vivo effects of LPS, did not appear to express the enzymes necessary to process the POMC molecule in the lymphocyte system.",
