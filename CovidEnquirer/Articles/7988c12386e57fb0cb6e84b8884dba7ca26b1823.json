            "text": "There are many reasons for using a molecular test in an epidemiologic study. The test might be used to confirm or exclude disease, assess disease severity, or identify the precise location of disease. It might characterize how the host responds to disease or how microbes interact with each other or with the host. The test might be used to distinguish between disease types, identify microbes, or differentiate among microbes of the same species. The test might detect a known or suspected marker of disease prognosis, a known or suspected marker of exposure that modifies disease risk, or one that is known or suspected to interact with a defined exposure disease relationship. Alternatively, the measure might detect a marker in search of an association. New technologies have identified genetic, transcript, and protein variants whose association with disease is unknown. Regardless of the reason for measurement, a test is only useful if it is reliable and valid, and interpreted appropriately. The validity and reliability of a test result depend on everything from whether the specimen was collected correctly to whether the results were recorded accurately. Once a test is selected and the validity and reliability determined in the hands of the research team, the continued validity and reliability is assured by quality control and quality assurance procedures (discussed in Chapter 10).",

            "text": "The extent that a test result reflects the true value, that is, it is valid, depends on minimizing two major classes of error: systematic error (also known as bias) and random error (Figure 8 .1). Systematic error is an error that occurs in one direction, for example, a scale that shows the weight as two grams higher than the true value. Though a systematic error can be corrected post hoc if detected, it is best avoided by regularly calibrating instruments. Depending on the direction of the bias, a systematic error can lead to the overestimation or underestimation of the frequency of exposure or disease. However the primary concern is if the systematic error occurs differentially between cases and controls or exposed and unexposed individuals. This difference can lead to an erroneous association. For example, if values are always higher for cases, it will appear that there is an association with being a case, even if the effect is due solely to systematic error in measurement. A welldesigned and well-implemented study protocol will avoid systematic errors by (1) setting inclusionary and exclusionary criteria that result in unbiased selection and follow-up of study participants; (2) making collection, storage, and processing of specimens from all participants as similar as possible; and (3) arranging laboratory procedures so that any effects of storage or testing equally impact specimens from cases and controls or exposed and unexposed participants.",

Random error increases variation and decreases the ability to detect a difference between groups -if a difference exists. Random errors can be minimized, but not avoided entirely, by minimizing technical variability in procedures, using uniform reagents and instruments, and training and periodically retraining personnel in the study protocol. Ideally, each specimen will be collected, handled, processed, and tested in exactly the same way from each study participant. If we could attain this ideal, all observed differences between participants would be attributable to true biological variation -given a test with perfect reliability and validity.

Variation also is affected by the type of specimen, the quality of the specimen, the test itself, and how the results are to be interpreted. Results from tests of liquid specimens can be quantitative, because the test can be referred back to a sample of known volume. The amount of bacteria isolated from urine is reported as the number of colony-forming units per milliliter urine. Tests of solid specimens may give only qualitative results. The amount of bacteria isolated from a throat swab is reported as heavy, moderate, little, or no growth. It is possible to process solid specimens or that collected on swabs by dissolving, or grinding, to test a known amount. Depending on processing, results may be reported qualitatively or semiquantitatively. Although many tests give results per volume, others give values relative to some standard. For example, we can use real-time polymerase chain reaction (PCR) to estimate the total bacterial load and then the proportion of that load due to a specific species, enabling semiquantitation even if the initial specimen is solid or a secretion collected on a swab.

If the investigator wishes to measure concentration of a specific biomarker, participants might be directed to collect a first morning void, and to either record the amounts of liquid consumed or drink a specified amount of liquid the day before, which will enable the investigator to adjust for liquid proportional to the individual's size.

Regardless of specimen collected, the goal of specimen collection should be to minimize variation due to differences in how, when, and where a specimen is collected, in order to maximize ability to detect true biological variation among study participants. The investigator should determine both the minimum and optimal amount of a specimen required for a valid test. An optimal volume enables retesting (if required either because of test failure or for validation) and storage for future use. Specimen vials can be marked so that there is an easy visual check that sufficient volume was collected. For swabs, the investigator might institute visual checks that there is material on the swab, or include culture on nonselective media in addition to selective media to ensure adequate sample was collected. With an infectious disease process it is impossible to revisit a participant at the same disease state, so it is critical to get the specimen collected right each time.

Further, different assays are more or less tolerant of how the specimen is handled and processed. There are some DNA hybridization assays with high tolerance for presence of proteins in with the DNA, such as colony blots and in situ hybridizations. By contrast, for use in a microarray format, extensive preparation of the DNA may be necessary to remove all other materials.

The label should be able to tolerate the storage conditions, because some labels fall off when a vial is frozen and thawed.

Invariably, some individuals will enroll in the study but be unable or refuse to give the required specimens or amount of specimen. Though there may be an optimal method of collecting a specimen, a less optimal alternative may be allowed. We conducted a study of urinary tract infection where Escherichia coli were isolated from vaginal specimens and urine. Vaginal specimens were self-collected using a tampon. Participants were instructed to insert a tampon before urinating. This had the added advantage of minimizing contamination of the urine specimen with vaginal secretions. Although almost all women were comfortable with this protocol some had never used a tampon and were unwilling to try. We offered selfcollection of the vaginal specimen using a swab as an alternative, even though this increased the potential for contamination of the urine with vaginal secretions. Similarly, some women had emptied their bladder before meeting with our study recruiter. If unable to urinate, we offered women something to drink and a place to wait until they were able to urinate, even though these urine samples would have had less time in the bladder and lower bacterial counts than if collected at a later point.

Currently there are few estimates in the literature of how frequently there is a change in the bacterial strains (or other colonizing microbes) that commonly colonize the human gut, mouth, vaginal cavity, and skin.

The weakest criterion is content validity; this criterion is generally invoked when developing a new measurement and appears more often in the social science literature than in assessments using laboratory techniques. The assessment of content validity is by professional judgment or consensus of the field. Assessing construct and criterion validity requires conduct of studies relative to some standard. Generally the investigator uses a case-control design, and selects specimens from individuals known to have the outcome of interest and those known not to have the outcome of interest. For construct validity the specimens will be positive or negative for some relevant characteristics of the phenomena, such as another test, and the results of the study will be the correlation or agreement between the two measures. For criterion validity, the specimens will be positive or negative for the phenomena as defined by the current standard (\"truth\"), and the results will predict the sensitivity, specificity, and predictive value of the new test relative to truth.",

As we move increasingly toward rapid testing using nonculture techniques like PCR, phenotypic tests become less practical because they require more time because the microbe must be grown. Alternatives, such as identifying the presence of a gene that causes resistance, can be used if the gene is known. Streptococcus pneumoniae resistance to penicillin is known to be caused by variations in penicillin binding proteins. A PCR-based test that assessed these variations would have content validity, because penicillin is known to bind to bacterial cell walls at the site of penicillin binding proteins. If presence of mutations in binding proteins correlates with resistance phenotype, then the test would have construct validity. Finally, if variants in penicillin binding proteins predict resistance based on a phenotypic test, the measure would have criterion validity. Although nonculture techniques show great promise for rapid detection of antibiotic resistance for many organisms -meeting all three types of validity -they have some disconcerting limitations. Phenotypic tests for antibiotic resistance detect resistance regardless of mechanism. A PCR-based test is limited to a specific genetic mechanism of resistance. Thus, if not all mechanisms of resistance are included in a test or a new mechanism emerges, the test will be incapable of detecting that the bacterium is resistant. Further, a mechanism may be present and not active because the gene is degenerate, there is a missing regulator, or there is some other reason. In this case the test would be falsely positive.",

Hageman and associates 9 (2003) conducted an assessment of laboratories participating in the U.S. National Nosocomial Surveillance System to validate antimicrobial testing results; 193 laboratories participated from 39 states. Laboratories were sent test organisms including an oxacillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus and vancomycin-resistant Enterococcus faecalis; S. aureus and E. faecalis are important causes of hospital-acquired infections (nosocomial). All laboratories were able to correctly identify the S. aureus as oxacillin resistant; and although 88% of the laboratories identified the E. faecalis as resistant to vancomycin, the accuracy depended heavily on the testing method. Only 28% of laboratories using the disk diffusion methods correctly reported the result compared to 94% using minimum inhibitory concentration methods. These types of assessment studies highlight which methods work best in practice; providing feedback to participating laboratories improves diagnostic capability everywhere and the accuracy of surveillance data.

If there is almost as much variation within an individual over the course of a week as observed between two individuals at a single point in time it is difficult to draw any valid conclusions.",

Envision an ELISA that quantifies the amount of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) present in the urine. hCG is only found in the urine if a woman is pregnant. The added level of precision that quantifying the amount of hCG has no real meaning if the construct being measured is pregnancy.

The effects of such losses can bias inference and generalizability. The potential for bias can be evaluated by comparing results from analyses of the subset with complete data to a set where missing values are inputted. Selection biases occur even within repositories and data banks; reasons for participation or refusal are associated with health, access to medical care, clinical manifestations of illness, socioeconomic status, and age, which in turn are associated with disease risk. 10 Not all variables can be accurately assessed from existing specimens. For many variables that may modify the study interpretation and generalizability of study results, the investigator will be dependent upon the quality of the data already collected. Because the purpose of the secondary analysis may be somewhat or even quite different from that of the original study, important modifying variables may not be measured with the optimum level of precision.

Similarly, if specimens are sensitive to storage and are collected from individuals each year, degradation over time might be erroneously interpreted as an increase in the item of interest with time: with less time to degrade, the most recent specimens will have higher levels.

DNA, RNA, or protein may alter or degrade with time. Microbes may die, or when regrown following storage display different phenotypes. Any changes in results attributable to storage are problematic because they add an additional source of variation beyond that due to technical and biological variation. Sample quality depends on how the original sample was collected, the processing it was subjected to, and the storage conditions -including times thawed and refrozen. Different laboratory tests are more or less sensitive to these factors; when using existing specimens the investigator must judge the potential impact on any inferences made. Thus it is critical to assess the validity and reliability of the planned assays on the specimens. As stored specimens are precious and often irreplaceable, these studies must be planned carefully to maximize the assessment while minimizing any losses.",

If there is limited amount of sample available that is not renewable, or if there are concerns about affecting specimen integrity if thawed and refrozen, it may be difficult to obtain access to stored samples. Bacterial and viral collections are generally renewable resources, and human DNA can be immortalized, making it effectively renewable. But other microbes and biological specimens (blood, cells, tissue) generally are not renewable. The investigator will want to optimize use of nonrenewable resources, grouping secondary tests together, which may limit the amount of sample available. Even if collections are renewable, investigators are appropriately concerned that other users be aware of the collections strengths and weaknesses, and appropriately take into account any design limitations. Ensuring proper use and data interpretation takes time and effort even if data are well documented. Moreover, the group collecting the data quite rightly would like to have first crack at using it. Finally, identifying, packing, and shipping specimens to another site for testing is not without cost. Thus, it is not surprising that repositories tend to closely guard access to their collections, often requiring potential users to complete some sort of application process, and tending to favor those with whom they have some sort of social connection. Unfortunately, this can mean that specimens are not used to optimum effect, because the zeal to protect the collection can lead to little or no use.",
