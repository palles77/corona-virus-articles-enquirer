            "text": "Resistance to respiratory pathogens, including coronavirus-induced infection and clinical illness in chickens has been correlated with the B (MHC) complex and differential ex vivo macrophage responses. In the current study, in vitro T lymphocyte activation measured by IFNg release was significantly higher in B2 versus B19 haplotypes. AIV infection of macrophages was required to activate T lymphocytes and prior in vivo exposure of chickens to NP AIV plasmid enhanced responses to infected macrophages. This study suggests that the demonstrated T lymphocyte activation is in part due to antigen presentation by the macrophages as well as cytokine release by the infected macrophages, with B2 haplotypes showing stronger activation. These responses were present both in CD4 and CD8 T lymphocytes. In contrast, T lymphocytes stimulated by ConA showed greater IFNg release of B19 haplotype cells, further indicating the greater responses in B2 haplotypes to infection is due to macrophages, but not T cells. In summary, resistance of B2 haplotype chickens appears to be directly linked to a more vigorous innate immune response and the role macrophages play in activating adaptive immunity.",

(2013) had suggested that innate immunity initially contributed to the enhanced resistance of the B2/B2 birds to IBV Fig. 6 . Both CD4 and CD8, B 2 T lymphocytes from vaccinated B2 birds were activated by B2 infected macrophages. T cell phenotypes were enriched by depletion of CD8 and CD4 antibody, respectively. Controls represent T lymphocyte responses in the absence of macrophages. AIV indicates infection of macrophages cultured with either phenotype. Fig. 7 . ConA stimulation of B19 derived T lymphocytes was significantly better than that of B2 T lymphocytes (p < 0.05). Neither B2 nor B19 derived T lymphocytes were stimulated in the controls in the absence of ConA. associated clinical illness. In the current study, we used AIV rather that IBV because macrophages are readily infected with AIV. Although belonging to different viral families with distinctly different properties, both viruses have single-stranded RNA genomes and both have enveloped virion particles. It should be assumed that IBV, although not readily infecting macrophages, infects epithelial cells and consequential pathology would be expected to activate innate immunity.",

Differences in macrophage function, correlating with differential innate immune responses (Dawes et al., 2014) , corroborate recent studies that demonstrate a much more important role macrophages play, in general, in directing the adaptive immunity, particularly T cell responses, in a variety of diseases including cancer and autoimmunity (Mills et al., 2000; Mosser, 2003; Mills, 2012; Biswas et al., 2012) .",

Elwood Briles and Mrs. Ruth Briles for whom this manuscript is dedicated and who were responsible for the early recognition of the chicken B haplotypes. We also thank Dr. Briles' technician Ms. Linda Yates and his assistant, Dr. Rene Kopulos for their essential contributions to the development and characterization of these chicken haplotypes. Dr. Maisie Dawes' contributions to the initial development of the macrophage culture technologies cited in this paper are greatly appreciated (Dawes et al., 2014) . We also received critical personnel support from the Western University of Health Sciences College of Veterinary Medicine.
