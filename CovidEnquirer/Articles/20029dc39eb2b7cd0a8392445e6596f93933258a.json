As shown in Table 1 , they include viral infections alone or combined with immunologic defects. Waksman [1] summarizes these observations: \"Theiler's virus induces an MS-like state only in SJL mice. It is thought therefore that this disease may be due to an autoimmune process, triggered by the viral infection in a genetically defective host. On the other hand, mutants of the JHM virus give a chronic demyelinative disease by infecting oligodendroglia to the exclusion of other cells. Experimental autoallergic encephalomyelitis (EAE) has been investigated for just a half century. Yet it is only in the last decade that a chronic, relapsing EAE closely resembling MS has been studied in any detail. Since this disease is readily produced in SJL mice and not in other mice strains, there is again an implication that defective immune regulation permits development of a chronic, relapsing autoimmune state. In other animal species, this relationship is less clearcut.\" Thus, the animal model studies support the idea that MS may be the result of a chronic viral infection with a genetically determined abnormality of immune regulation.",

However, antibodies are high not only against measles virus but also against a number of other viruses, including herpes, vaccinia, varicella- zoster, influenza, mumps, and rubella. The significance of these high antibody levels is unknown, but they probably result from the deranged immunologic response. In his review, Norrby [2] writes that the high levels may hinge upon \"a nonspecific immune activation of immune-competent cells that were once conditioned to produce antibodies. This possibility is supported by the observation that the oligoclonal IgG represents antibodies against several different viruses and presumably other antigens. It is known from studies on the occurrence of oligoclonal IgG in sera of patients with different diseases that 'non-specific' activation of immunoglobulin production may occur both as a result of lymphoproliferative disorders and also secondary to neoplastic disorders of cell types not known to produce immunoglobulins, diseases of suspected autoimmune origin (e.g., chronic active hepatitis), chronic infections, parasitic diseases, and liver cirrhosis.\" To search for the presence of latent viruses that are in a noninfectious state, radioactive probes can now be used. With this technique, the measles virus genome has been detected in the brain tissue of four of ten patients who died of MS [3] , and DNA sequences of herpes simplex virus have been found in brain tissue, but in tissue from normals as well as from MS patients [4] .",

Ten years ago [5] a virus was isolated in Japan from the CSF of patients suffering from subacute myelo-optico-neuropathy (SMON), a finding which other investigators disputed [6] . Because so much difficulty was reported in working with the original isolate, we set out to determine if we could establish conditions for obtaining reproducible titrations of the virus and for conducting neutralization tests. Once this objective was met, we attempted the isolation of virus from 12 consecutively taken samples of CSF of Houstonian patients with chronic CNS disease. Four isolates were made-three from patients with MS and one from a patient with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS)-and none from 27 CSF specimens from \"control\" patients.",

For a period of several months our work was disrupted and could only be put back on track when we improved the quality of our water. For detection of virus, a cell monolayer was used in the shape of an elongated triangle, which formed when tube cultures were prepared in a stationary, slightly inclined position. After virus inoculation, the cultures were rolled and the cytopathic changes were examined primarily at the boundary between the cell monolayer and the culture fluid. When virus was present, the cells lost their parallel orientation and crisscrossed with each other. Some cells retracted and clear spaces appeared on the glass surface. Some cells swelled and granules appeared within them. Crucial to the interpretation of the results of each test was the requirement (a) that each test which was set up by one worker be read independently by two 100 TCDso per 0.1 ml with 0.5 ml of the serum diluted 1:25 or greater. The mixtures were incubated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C and then randomly coded; 0.2 ml of each coded sample was inoculated in each of three cultures. The cultures were rolled at 37\u00b0C and examined on day 5. Then, without knowledge of the results of this reading, they were examined again on day 6. Virus titrations were included in each test to assure the infectivity of the agent. At the end of the test, the results of the virus titration and the virus-serum mixtures were decoded.",

Tests for mycoplasma were negative when third passage virus harvests of the four strains described in this paper and a fifth strain isolated from the CSF of another MS patient were inoculated into diphasic broth and onto E-agar plates [11] . In addition, the cytopathic changes were not inhibited by antimycoplasma drugs such as tylocine at 60 Ag/ml or gentamicin at 25 Ag/ml. Further, the selective neutralization of the virus by sera from the patients who yielded the agent indicates that we are not dealing with a contaminant. The possibility of contamination of our cultures by the agent previously isolated in Japan is ruled out by repeated isolations of the virus from the positive spinal fluids during periods when the Japanese agent was not being cultivated in our laboratory.

            "text": "We are having difficulty in characterizing our agent. In spite of much effort, we have been unable to visualize the agent in the electron microscope, either in infected cells or in purified concentrates. From our preliminary data, we suspect that we may be dealing with an agent similar to scrapie. A puzzling aspect of these agents is their \"invisibility\" by electron microscopy, despite the fact that estimates of their size, based on their retention by filters having pores of known dimensions, show them to be large enough for detection by electron microscopy. Our agent passes a 100-nm filter, but seems to be held back by a 50-nm filter. It is not sedimented in the ultracentrifuge when spun at 35,000 x g for 1 hour, but is sedimented at 175,000 x g for 2 hours. Like the scrapie agent, its infectivity is destroyed by ether, but it is inactivated by heating at 50\u00b0C. It has been suggested that scrapie-like agents do not possess any nucleic acid with which to reproduce themselves [12] . Such infectious proteins, called prions, may act as infectious agents by invading susceptible cells, where they are replicated by utilizing the DNA of the host cell [13] . Reorganizing host DNA fragments may result in the formation of new genes which then direct the synthesis of the original infectious proteins. Rather than a conventional virion, we may have isolated such an infectious protein. Time will tell.",
