Antibody capture was essentially complete in the optimized assay. In combination with an antigen-dependent ELISA, the assay allowed estimation of the absolute concentration of specific monoclonal antibody in ascites.

Often, it is helpful or essential to know the concentration of a given monoclonal antibody in absolute, or weight/volume, units. In this regard, one method which has been used to rigorously determine absolute Ig concentration is to purify the antibody and subsequently perform a protein determination. Although precision may be achieved in this way, purification methods themselves vary as to yield, relative purity, and convenience (Manil et al., 1986) . Furthermore, Ig extraction from most monoclonal antibody preparations may co-purify substantial amounts of non-specific antibody molecules. For example, even when tissue culture media containing serum is pre-treated with protein A, substantial amounts of non-specific Ig remain (Underwood, 1986) .",

It is not clear, however, that such assays provide an unequivocal measure of antibody concentration. While these immunoassays do in part reflect antibody concentration, it has also been established that they depend heavily upon the affinities of particular antibodies, the properties of other reactants, such as conjugated secondary antibodies, and the density of antigen in each assay (reviewed by Steward and Lew, 1985) . ,Most importantly, it has been shown that the binding of an antibody to its specific antigen is quantitatively quite different from the binding of the same antibody to a solidphase support such as plastic (Mattila, 1985; Dierks et al., 1986) . Thus, the common practice of using myeloma proteins bound to plastic as standards in assaying Ig bound to specific antigen rests on a flawed premise. Mattila (1985) has estimated that the magnitude of error when plastic-bound myeloma standards are used to measure antigen-bound Ig may be in the range of 10-70fold.",

This method, which has been used in many laboratories, potentially provides a reliable means of determining the concentration of specific antibodies in weight/ volume units.

In this report, we describe a solid-phase capture assay for murine IgG. We explicitly address several critical aspects of this assay such as the importance of capture antibody concentration and quality, the lack of interference by exogenous, non-murine antibody, and the influence of IgG subclass on the sensitivity of the assay. In addition, the validity and reliability of the assay are demonstrated, and the application of the assay to common problems is presented.",

This strategy would not be valid if interfering proteins in ascites prevented a true estimate of the relative reference:ascites titer of the monoclonal antibody. In order to assess this possibility, experiments were performed with mixtures of monoclonal antibodies J.2.2 and J.7.2 (specific for JHM virus, essentially no specific binding to A59 virus) and monoclonal antibody A.3.10 (specific for A59 virus, essentially no specific binding to JHM virus). Each mixture or 'artificial ascites' was produced by mixing 30 #1 of a SPA-purified antibody with 60 ~tl of ascites from another, heterologous antibody, for example, J.2.2 SPA with A.3.10 ascites. Thus, the known or expected concentration of a SPA antibody (for example, J.2.2 SPA) was three times the concentration of the same antibody in a SPA-ascites mixture (for example, J.2.2 SPA and A.3.10 ascites). Experimentally, relative antibody titers in the SPA, ascites, and SPA-ascites mixtures were determined by Viral-ELISA against the relevant viruses, for example, JHM virus in the case of J.2.2 SPA added to A.3.10 ascites. The Viral-ELISA titers were compared by a modification of the multiple of normal activity method (Tijssen, 1985) , utilizing semilog paper in which absorbances were displayed on the ordinate and serial log10 dilutions of the reactants were displayed on the abscissa. In each experiment, the absorbance of the SPA-ascites mixture was corrected for the small amount of non-specific binding of heterologous ascites to the virus corresponding to the specific antibody (for example, A.3.10 ascites binding to JHM virus, absorbance usually 0.10-0.20). The relative titers were then calculated by comparing the extent of horizontal separation of the curves in their linear ranges.",

Having shown that GAM-CAP was necessary for a practical assay, we next sought to determine the optimal amount of this capture antibody. Ideally, capturing antibody should bind all of the IgG to be assayed, since capture that is partial or inconsistent may yield misleading resuits. As shown in Fig. 1 , capture of 500 pg/well of myeloma IgG2a was increasingly efficient as mote GAM-CAP was used until 40 ng/well of GAM-CAP was reached; beyond this value, essentially complete capture of all added IgG was achieved. Similar results were obtained with the IgG1, IgG2b, and IgG3 myelomas. The relative sensitivity of the C-ELISA as a function of amount of GAM-CAP was also investigated. As also shown in Fig. 1 , there was a drastic decrease in sensitivity of the assay outside of the range of 10-40 ng/well of GAM-CAP. This unexpected result indicates that the amount of capture antibody employed is a critical determinant of assay efficiency, and, further, that the optimum amount of capture antibody falls within a very narrow range of acceptable values.",

A representative experiment is shown in Fig. 2A , in which myeloma IgG2a was assayed with and without added serum components. There was no interference by either horse serum or fetal bovine serum, in contrast to the marked interference noted in assays in which GAM-CAP was omitted. To judge the sensitivity of the C-ELISA for all murine IgG subclasses, the study shown in Fig. 2 B was performed. This indicated reasonably consistent detection of each subclass, with the exception of myeloma IgG3, to which the assay showed significant dimunition of sensitivity. ",

            "text": "It is often of interest to monitor the production of antibody by hybridomas under different conditions. For example, Fig. 3 demonstrates the growth and monoclonal antibody secretion of hybridoma J.2.2. In Fig. 3A these parameters are displayed for J.2.2 after adaptation to serum-free culture in HL-1 media, and in Fig. 3B similar data is displayed for growth in media supplemented with 10% horse serum. Although cell growth was comparable in both instances, the yield of antibody per cell was approximately three times higher when serum was included in the medium. With regard to the C-ELISA, the low background at day 1 indicates that neither HL-1 nor serum-supplemented media contain detectable protein cross-reacting with murine IgG in the assay. Fig. 3 also demonstrates that the C-ELISA reliably distinguished among closely related determinations, for exampie, between the concentration of J.2.2 in the morning and afternoon samples. A vexing problem in hybridoma methodology is to measure the weight/volume concentration of a specific monoclonal antibody in ascites (Partridge et al., 1985) . To address this problem, SPA-ascites mixing experiments were performed as noted in the materials and methods section. Table III summarizes these experiments and shows that there is close agreement between the known and observed concentrations of specific monoclonal antibody in SPA-ascites mixtures. This result indicates that the relative concentration of a specific monoclonal antibody in SPA-preparations and the same antibody in ascites can be reliably determined by the Viral-ELISA, despite the presence of a large excess of other proteins and irrelevant murine IgG in ascites. Since it was demonstrated above that the absolute concentration of a monoclonal antibody may be determined either in purified or tissue culture preparations of the antibody by C-ELISA, it follows that the concentration of specific monoclonal antibody in ascites may reliably be estimated by the combined use of the Viral-ELISA and the C-ELISA. When these methods were applied to a series of ascitic fluids induced by our hybridomas, specific monoclonal antibody was found to be at a concentration of 0.24 to 10.3 mg/ml and constituted approximately 20-90% of the total IgG.",

Building upon this experience, we have examined methodological requirements, underlying assumptions, and several useful applications of such assays. We have shown that this type of assay reliably determines mouse IgG concentration in hybridoma supematants and in ascitic fluids. To our knowledge, the estimation of specific monoclonal lgG concentration in ascities by these methods has not been reported previously. Specifically, the following characteristics of the C-ELISA we have optimized were demonstrated: (1) essentially complete murine IgG capture, (2) sensitive and comparable detection of all murine IgG subclasses, except IgG3, (3) lack of interference by contaminating, non-mouse Ig from added serum, (4) close correspondence to murine IgG standards measured by the Folin (Lowry) method and UV absorbance at 280 nm, and (5) good precision and reliability (approximately 5-15% coefficient of variation). With regard to alternative methods of murine IgG measurement, it has been suggested that competitive inhibition enzyme immunoassays (CIEIA) have superior precision to immunoglobulin capture assays (Bosworth et al., 1983) . However, the use of affinity-purified capture antibodies, as in the C-ELISA we have studied, results in precision (Table II) which is comparable to that of reported CIEIAs. Another consideration when comparing CIEIAs and C-ELISAs is that inhibition assays may lead to artifactually low estimates of monoclonal Ig concentration (Springer, 1983) . This may have been the case in the CIEIA determinations reported by Hunter and Bosworth (1986) , where the average concentration of monoclonal antibodies in hybridoma cultures was approximately 1 gg/ml. By contrast, the range of monoclonal antibodies we have measured in hybridoma supernatants by C-ELISA is more in keeping with the values usually reported in the literature (10-100 gg/ml of Ig) (Galfr~ and Milstein, 1981; Underwood, 1986) . Finally, the C-ELISA requires only one set of plates, rather than the two sets of plates in the CIEIA to accommodate liquid-phase and solid-phase reactions. The simplicity of the C-ELISA, both with regard to the reagents and procedures used, should make it easy to set up in any laboratory with immunoassay experience.",

            "text": "In conclusion, several methodological aspects of the assays we have used require emphasis. First, as Shields and Turner (1986) have pointed out, the use of highest quality affinity-purified antibodies in both the capture and indicator steps (GAM-CAP, GAM-HRP) is very important in maximizing assay sensitivity and reliability. Second, the concentration of capture antibody is an especially critical determinant of the C-ELISA; as we have shown, the optimum value of capture antibody may lie in a very narrow range. The paradoxical decrease in sensitivity of the C-ELISA when excess capture antibody is used may be similar to the 'hook' or prozone phenomenon in solid-phase assays discussed by Pesce et al. (1981) . Third, the diminished sensitivity of the assay to IgG3 probably relates to the relatively low concentration of this subclass in murine serum and to the corresponding bias of our anti-IgG reagents against this subclass. This problem could be obviated by isotyping all monoclonal antibodies to be tested and using an IgG3 myeloma reference protein if necessary. Similar considerations may apply in the small minority of monoclonal antibodies with lambda light chains (data not shown). Fourth, a major source of error and imprecision in the C-ELISA related to the marked sensitivity of the assay and the corresponding need for serial dilutions of reactants, standards, and samples to be tested. For reliable determinations, it is essential to dilute samples so that their concentrations fall within the relatively narrow range (1-20 ng/ml) of the C-ELISA; outside of this range, measurements will be misleading and imprecise. Fifth, in the present study data were plotted manually and interpreted by visual inspection. Although this sort of analysis is adequate for most investigational purposes, increased assay sophistication and performance may be achieved by the application of rigorous mathematical methods (Tijssen, 1985; Kay et al., 1986) or computer-based techniques (Butler et al., 1987) . Finally, the assays presented have been validated for murine IgG only. While it is likely that similar assays would be useful in measuring other Ig classes of mice and Ig of other species, this must be determined empirically in each case.",
