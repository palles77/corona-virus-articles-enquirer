Biologically relevant macromolecules, such as proteins and nucleic acids, contain many protons and their molecular tumbling is slow, leading to the problems of signal overlap and line broadening. In this context, stable isotope labeling of target molecules is essential for investigating biological macromolecules. In the stable isotope labeling approach, the isotopic composition of specific atoms is altered, depending on the intended purpose. In general, the atoms for which the isotopic composition is commonly altered are proton, carbon, and nitrogen atoms. In addition, the use of other kinds of atoms, such as fluorine and oxygen isotopes, is sometimes considered.",

Thus, each protein molecule in the NMR sample tube has a different 2 H labeling pattern. The NMR signals from the residual protons in the random fractionally deuterated proteins yield useful structural information similar to that obtained from the fully protonated proteins, except that the NMR signals are narrower. The usefulness of random fractional deuteration has been demonstrated for a variety of proteins, such as thioredoxin and staphylococcal nuclease. 11, 12 LeMaster and Richards achieved the chemical shift assignment for Escherichia coli thioredoxin using B75% random fractional deuteration. 11 This 108-amino acid residue protein was previously considered to be too large for an analysis with 1 H-1 H homonuclear two-dimensional (2-D) NMR spectra. Their report clearly showed how 2 H labeling could alleviate the molecular size limitation for NMR studies. However, the chemical shifts in a deuterated sample are slightly different from those in a fully protonated sample due to deuterium-induced isotope shifts, and thus the residual proton signals were more complex, as described later.",

            "text": "The most important reason to label protein samples with 13 C and 15 N is to introduce the heteronuclear NMR dimensions into NMR spectroscopy, which facilitate the analysis of complex proton NMR spectra. The heteronuclear one-bond spin couplings between 13 C/ 15 N and directly attached 1 H are large enough to efficiently transfer nuclear magnetization through these spin couplings, which facilitates a variety of heteronuclear multidimensional experiments. 15 The availability of multidimensional experiments enormously expands the range of NMR study, and these provide a wealth of information on the protein. For example, the [ 1 H, 15 N] heteronuclear singlequantum correlation spectroscopy (HSQC) spectrum from a uniformly 15 N-labeled protein can be used to evaluate the quality of the NMR sample. Therefore, an NMR study of a new protein often starts with the preparation of the uniformly 15 Nlabeled protein. A good quality [ 1 H, 15 N] HSQC spectrum promises advanced NMR analysis; otherwise, further optimization of the NMR sample should be performed in a trialand-error manner. Once a preparation method for an NMR sample with good quality is established, the uniformly 13 Cand 15 N-labeled protein is prepared, with the aim of the sequential assignment of the backbone and, if required, side chain resonances. For the assignment of the NMR resonances in uniformly 13 C-and 15 N-labeled proteins, a series of heteronuclear multidimensional experiments have been established, which are now widely and routinely employed. 16, 17 The assignment of the NMR resonances enables a wide variety of NMR studies on protein structures, dynamics, and interactions at an atomic resolution, even in the case of relatively large proteins. For example, the structure determination of a protein up to 25 kDa can be achieved by employing uniform 13 C and 15 N labeling and the heteronuclear multidimensional NMR method. 18 The emergence of the 13 C and 15 N labeling approach and multidimensional experiments has enormously advanced NMR investigations of proteins smaller than 25 kDa.",

            "text": "It is noteworthy that the application of 13 C labeling is not limited to heteronuclear correlation experiments. An NMR experiment using direct 13 C observation may also yield useful structural information, which cannot easily be obtained by the other methods. The utility of the 13 C NMR experiments has been well demonstrated through the observation of backbone carbonyl carbons. 1, [19] [20] [21] In contrast to the 1 H detection experiments, the signal dispersion in the 13 C chemical shifts and the narrower linewidths are advantages of the 13 C direct observation approach for relatively large proteins. The study on Streptomyces subtilisin inhibitor (SSI), a 23-kDa homodimer, is a classic example of such an approach. Residue selective 13 C labeling was used to observe the carbonyl carbon signal of the functionally important Met residue (Met73-Val74; P1-P1 0 ). 19 To differentiate the three Met carbonyl carbon signals, an SSI sample simultaneously labeled with [1-13 C]Met and [ 15 N]Val was prepared. Because the other two Met residues have different N-terminal neighbors, only the Met73 signals showed a 15-Hz one-bond 13 C-15 N spin coupling. This type of method, which is referred to as selective 13 C, 15 N double labeling, is the prototype of the widely used sequential assignment method using uniformly 13 C, 15 N double-labeled proteins. The original selective 13 C, 15 N doublelabeling method by itself is still often used as a reliable assignment method for the carbonyl carbon and amide nitrogen signals of backbone peptides. Another interesting application of carbonyl carbons is the effect of deuterium-hydrogen exchange of amides on the line shapes, known as the deuterium-hydrogen exchange of amide on the line shapes (DEALS) method. 20 This method can be used to investigate the hydrogen exchange rate of backbone amide groups in proteins. When the carbon spectra of proteins dissolved in H 2 O and D 2 O solutions are compared, the chemical shifts of their backbone carbonyl carbons differ by B0.1 ppm between them. This difference arises from the proton/deuterium substitution in the amide groups of its own residue and the following residue, which is known as the deuterium isotope shift. In the DEALS method, the backbone carbonyl carbon peaks are observed in a mixture of H 2 O and D 2 O. In these circumstances, when the lifetime of the amide proton is longer than the inverse of the deuterium isotope shift in the hertz scale, the carbon peaks appear as separate peaks. Conversely, when the exchange rate is rapid, the carbon peaks appear as single averaged peaks. Therefore, slowly exchanging amide protons can readily be identified based on their line shape on the carbon spectrum. This method has an advantage in that the experiment can be conducted in a steady state, which enables the relatively precise estimation of the exchange rate, compared to other proton/deuterium exchange experiments that utilize real-time monitoring. Improvements in sensitivity, using cryogenic probes, have enabled 13 C detection in multidimensional protein NMR spectroscopy. [22] [23] [24] Further development of the pulse sequences with non-proton detection might allow the establishment of a new strategy of NMR structure determination without 1 H-1 H nuclear Overhauser effects (NOEs), using fully deuterated and 13 C-/ 15 N-labeled proteins.",

The merits of the use of 2 H labeling, such as line narrowing and reduced spin diffusion, are quite important when studying large proteins by NMR. The SAIL method utilizes proteins exclusively composed of stereo-and regioselectively labeled amino acids (SAIL amino acids) for NMR studies. 7 In the SAIL amino acids, selected protons are substituted by deuterium, such that each carbon or nitrogen nucleus in the final protein will have at most one 1 H nucleus bonded to it. In addition, 13 C and 15 N are used only where a 1 H is bound to it or where it is needed for uninterrupted through-bond assignment pathways. To achieve this, SAIL amino acids are designed as follows ( Figure 1 The 20 SAIL amino acids ( Figure 2 ) were synthesized based on these design concepts by chemical and enzymatic means. These SAIL amino acids are commercially available from SAIL Technologies (http://www.sail-technologies.com). The NMR signals from SAIL proteins are sharpened by both decreasing the long-range couplings and eliminating the dipolar relaxation pathways, in comparison to those of UL proteins. The labeling pattern of SAIL amino acids preserves the through-bond connectivity required for backbone and side chain assignments. However, the extensive deuteration of the side chain protons enables efficient transfer of the magnetization. In addition, the stereospecific deuteration in the methylene and prochiral methyl groups eliminates the need for their stereospecific assignment. Thus, a higher level of assignment can readily be achieved by using SAIL proteins compared to UL proteins.",

A brief consideration shows that the number of nonexchangeable side chain protons in SAIL proteins is less than half, and the number of expected NOESY cross peaks is decreased by 40-45%, relative to UL proteins. However, most of the additional NOEs from UL proteins either involve fixed (geminal) distances or become redundant in the absence of stereospecific assignments and cause spectral overlap without furnishing independent information. In practice, the stereospecific assignment of methylene and prochiral methyl groups is quite difficult. Indeed, the Biological Magnetic Resonance Data Bank (http://www.bmrb.wisc.edu) contains the stereospecific assignments for well below 10% of the methylene protons and the Val/Leu methyl groups. On the other hand, the NOE distance constraints obtained from SAIL proteins are effective in defining the conformations of proteins due to the information from their exclusive stereospecific assignments 33 and the rare signal overlap. In addition, the proton density is decreased in SAIL proteins, which mitigates spin diffusion and thus improves the accuracy of the interproton distance measurements from NOE peaks ( Figure 3 ). More detailed theoretical considerations, 7 which take into account the enhanced signal strength and sharper lines in SAIL spectra and the fact that overlap can render peaks unidentifiable, have shown that in practice, with larger molecules, SAIL is expected to increase, rather than decrease, the number of identifiable NOE cross peaks. The expected increase is moderate in regions without overlap but significant in regions with strong overlap. Thus, for larger proteins, SAIL is expected to yield two or more times the number of relevant conformational restraints as uniform labeling.",

To this end, it will presumably be necessary to further optimize the isotope labeling patterns of each SAIL amino acid in order to cope with the extensive crowding and line broadening resulting from the large molecular size. In an overlap and relaxation-optimized version of the SAIL approach, the number of 1 H nuclei is reduced further to enable the observation of well-shaped and separated signals, even for proteins larger than 50 kDa. SAIL patterns can be characterized by the percentage of 1 H atoms relative to the uniformly labeled protein in an H 2 O solution. The original SAIL amino acids retain 64% of all protons and 44% of all side chain protons. 7 An overlap and relaxation-optimized SAIL pattern comprised 53% of all protons and only 28% of all side chain protons. 34 The modified SAIL 1 H labeling pattern is essentially a subset of the original SAIL amino acids. For instance, a uniformly 13 C-labeled Leu side chain contains four 13 C and nine 1 H nuclei. The original SAIL pattern reduces the NMR-active nuclei to three 13 C and three 1 H. In the case of overlap and relaxation-optimized SAIL, the H g methine proton, which tends to be overlapped and to provide only largely redundant NOEs, is additionally replaced by 2 H. C g can either be replaced by 12 C for further reduction of the relaxation or be kept as 13 C to enable the assignment of the 13 Figure 1 The design concept of the SAIL method. In methylene groups, one of the two methylene protons is stereospecifically substituted by deuteron. In the case of methyl groups, two of the three methyl protons are deuterated.

First, this allows for a comparison between the NMR spectra obtained from in vivo and in vitro expression. The [ 1 H, 15 N] HSQC spectra from both approaches should be compared to detect any possible difference between in vivo and in vitro expression. It should be kept in mind that N-terminal processing does not necessarily occur in the case of cell-free synthesis. 45 Second, it is less costly and requires less effort to produce proteins from E. coli cells than by the cell-free method. Thus, optimizations of the purification protocol and the NMR buffer conditions should be performed using proteins produced by E. coli. Third, most proteins that are expressed well in E. coli cells can be produced successfully by the cell-free method. Among 44 proteins that were expressed in E. coli, 35 (80%) were also found to work well in the cell-free synthesis system.

            "text": "For a successful cell-free reaction, the preparation of an S30 extract with high activity is quite important. Most investigators and commercial vendors of cell-free systems have focused on the level of activity of the extract. [47] [48] [49] [50] [51] For example, the activity ( 2) V108 ( 2) V35 ( 2) V142 ( 2) V91 ( 2) V121( 2) L32 ( 1) L18 ( 1) L69 ( 1) L105 ( 1) L112 ( 1) L39 ( 1) L116 ( 1) ( 2) L32 ( 1) V121 ( 2) L18 ( 1) L105( 1) L112 ( 1) L4 ( 1) L39 ( 1) L48 ( 1) L116 ( 1) L69 ( 1) M76 ( 2) M0 ( 2) M51 ( 2) M124 ( 2) M144( 2) ( 3) M0 ( 2) M76 ( 2) M144 ( 2) Q135 ( 2) K77 ( 3) K94 ( 3) K148 ( 3) V136( ) ( 2) M124 ( 2) ( 2) R37 ( 3) R106 ( 3) R106 ( 2) R37 ( 2) 3 depends on the kind of E. coli cells used for the preparation. Escherichia coli strain A19 yielded a reliable extract because of its lack of RNase I. 49 The strain BL21 Star (DE3) (Invitrogen), lacking RNase E activity, had 1.2-1.4 times higher activity than A19 and was therefore chosen for the extract. The activity also depends on how the extract is prepared and its concentration. The presence of DTT in the S30 extract is necessary for preserving its activity over time. S30 extracts prepared with and without DTT have equivalent activity initially, but the activity of the extract without DTT declines to 80-90% after only 3 months of storage at \u00c080 1C. 45 In addition to the level of activity, the efficacy of isotope labeled amino acid incorporation is important. When the extract is prepared according to the original procedures, an abundance of unlabeled amino acids remains in the resulting extract. For example, when an S30 extract prepared according to the conventional protocol was used, the incorporation rate of the added amino acids into the target protein was only B90%. The authors thus introduced a gel filtration step in the preparation of the S30 extract to remove the remaining amino acids. As a result, the incorporation level increased to 96%, without any loss of the activity of the extract. In addition, the concentration of the extract in the cell-free reaction should be optimized in terms of both the expression level and the incorporation rate of added SAIL amino acids. A higher concentration of extract leads to higher yields of protein but also to dilution of the label by the endogenous amino acids in the extract. This problem of label dilution has been quantitatively analyzed. 45 The extract described previously produced up to 2 mg (E. coli peptidyl-prolyl cis-trans isomerase b (EPPIb)) protein per milliliter of the reaction solution with optimal concentrations of added amino acids (1 mM each). The protein yield decreases as the levels of added amino acids are reduced, although the labeling efficiency increases. In the case of calmodulin, the optimal concentration for the amino acid mixture was determined to be 1.7 mg ml \u00c01 , representing a value slightly below the maximum determined by analyzing protein yields as a function of concentration. Because the labeled amino acids represent the most important cost factor, the mole ratios of the individual amino acids were also adjusted to match the amino acid composition of calmodulin, with the exception that the mole ratio of Gly was increased by a factor of 4. A sample of [ 13 C, 15 N]-calmodulin, prepared using the dialyzed extract with the optimal level of amino acids, was hydrolyzed into amino acids and analyzed by liquid chromatography-quadrupole mass spectrometry (MS) and capillary electrophoresis MS to investigate the percentage of unlabeled amino acids incorporated into the protein. These were as follows: Gly, 2.2%; Ala, 2.9%; Ser, 3.2%; Pro, 3.2%; Val, 3.7%; Thr, 2.3%; Leu, 3.6%; Asx, 7.5%; Lys, 4.5%; Glx, 0.8%; Met, 1.9%; His, 2.2%; Phe, 1.8%; Arg, 5.7%; and Tyr, 3.0%. When the amount of Gly added was not increased by a factor of 4, the incorporation of unlabeled Gly increased to 12.7%. This is the reason why a higher concentration of Gly was used. If necessary, the levels of other unlabeled amino acids can be decreased by increasing the amounts of the labeled species.",

This problem can be overcome by using a cleavable N-terminal tag. 45 This approach has been used successfully for the cell-free production of a large number of proteins. 45 Small-scale reactions are useful for determining whether a target protein is actually synthesized. The recommended composition of reagents in the small-scale reaction is the same as that in the large-scale reaction used for the NMR sample preparation except for the presence of PEG-8000. PEG plays an important role as a stabilizer of the system. 49 In the case of calmodulin, the ratio of protein yields with and without PEG-8000 was 1.6. Even a small amount of PEG can disturb the sodium dodecyl sulfate polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (SDS-PAGE) quantitation of the level of target protein production, despite attempts to remove the PEG by acetone or trichloroacetic acid (TCA) precipitation of the protein. For example, after cell-free synthesis and prior to purification, the SDS-PAGE band from acetone-or TCA-precipitated calmodulin was not observed, although it could be observed following purification. For this reason, PEG should be omitted from the small-scale screening reactions.",

One strategy to overcome this problem involves the use of auxotrophic E. coli strains. By growing the E. coli auxotrophic strain in minimal medium containing a small amount of the target isotope labeled amino acid and a large amount of the 19 other unlabeled amino acids, a reasonable yield of the selectively labeled protein can be obtained:",

However, it is often difficult to analyze these spectral regions in uniformly 13 C/ 15 N-labeled proteins, especially for Phe and Tyr residues. In addition to the inherently low sensitivity, the resonances of the d, e, and z ring carbons of Phe residues and the d carbons of Tyr residues are prone to overlap with each other in NMR spectra. Such limited chemical shift dispersion and strong 13 C-13 C spin couplings hamper the spectral analyses, especially for Phe residues. Furthermore, exchange broadening due to aromatic ring flipping motions, which have occasionally been reported in the literature, 53,54 makes the NMR signals for the d and e atoms of some Phe and Tyr residues even more difficult, or sometimes impossible, to observe. In the SAIL aromatic amino acids, new 2 H, 13 C labeling patterns were introduced to make the NMR spectra for aromatic resonances simple and sensitive and to facilitate their spectral assignment by exclusively using through-bond correlations. 39 Figure 4 illustrates the repertoire of the currently available SAIL Phe and SAIL Tyr amino acids. In the [ 13 C g , 13 In all cases, the aliphatic moieties were uniformly labeled with 13 C and 15 N, and the pro-R hydrogen of the b-methylene group was stereospecifically labeled with 2 H, thus enabling the unambiguous stereospecific assignment of the prochiral methylene signals. All of the SAIL Phe and Tyr residues lack directly bonded aromatic 13 C-13 C pairs in order to avoid strong onebond 13 C-13 C scalar couplings, and the alternate 2 H labeling eliminates large scalar and dipolar interactions among the ring protons. Figure 5 compares the aromatic regions of [ 1 H, 13 C] HSQC spectra of EPPIb, containing uniformly [ 13 C, 15 N]-labeled Phe, d-SAIL Phe, e-SAIL Phe, or z-SAIL Phe. It is obvious that the severe signal overlap observed for uniformly [ 13 C, 15 N]-labeled Phe is resolved by using SAIL Phe because of the absence of resonances and the sharpening of the remaining resonances. Employing SAIL Phe increased the aromatic signal intensities. One of the reasons for the improvement is the attenuation of dipolar interactions, which was achieved by replacing the hydrogens adjacent to the detected nuclei with 2 H. In the case of the uniformly 13 C-labeled aromatic ring, a long (17-or 34ms) constant time evolution period, which causes a reduction of the magnetization, must be used in the [ 1 H, 13 C] HSQC measurement to refocus the 13 C-13 C couplings. In contrast, the SAIL Tyr/Phe labeling patterns do not require constant time evolution in the [ 1 H, 13 C] HSQC measurement.",

The 3-D HBCB(CG)HE experiment can also be performed in a 2-D version, (HB)CB(CG)HE. These pulse sequences are composed of previously employed building blocks 55 and are similar to the previously reported sequences, 56 A major difference between the previously published sequences and the sequences for SAIL proteins is the incorporation of H b evolution. This was feasible because the stereoselective deuteration in the b methylene group alleviated the overlap of the H b resonances and prolonged the H b relaxation time. In addition, the slower relaxation of 13 C b , due to the deuteration, also enhanced the measurement sensitivity. In the case of HBCB(CG)HE, the magnetization is transferred from C g to H e directly via 3 J CgHe (7.9 Hz for Phe and 7.1 Hz for Tyr) after the transfer to C g . In the HBCB(CGCZ)HZ experiment, the magnetization is transferred from C g to C z via 3 J CgCz (9.3 Hz), before the final C z -H z one-bond INEPT transfer. The sitespecific 2 H and 13 C labeling patterns made it possible to transfer the magnetization through long-range scalar couplings. Using these experiments, the correlations between the H b and the ring protons could be detected for Phe and Tyr residues in calmodulin and EPPIb, except for those undergoing aromatic flipping-broadening. 39, 57 The 13 C-1 H pairs of aromatic ring moieties are considered to be amenable for strong TROSY effects, but the results reported thus far are not quite satisfactory for uniformly 13 Clabeled, fully protonated proteins. 27 In each type of SAIL Tyr/ Phe, however, all of the 13 C-1 H moieties are separated from each other by at least one 12 C-2 H group, and thus the TROSY effect works perfectly. The linewidths of the TROSY peaks observed for the F1-coupled [ 1 H, 13 C] HSQC spectra are narrower than those of the anti-TROSY peaks for the 18-kDa protein EPPIb, and it has been found that the TROSY components of SAIL Phe remain reasonably sharp, even for protein particles as large as 80 kDa. Thus, the use of SAIL aromatic amino acids opens up new possibilities for studying very large proteins.",

In TOCSY-type experiments for side chains, such as HCCH-TOCSY, the efficiency of spin-lock magnetization transfer is improved due to the extensive deuteration attached to the side chains. Compared to UL proteins, a high degree of resonance assignment can readily be accomplished by using SAIL proteins. As described in Section 1.16.3.2, spin relaxation is weakened in SAIL proteins compared to the corresponding UL proteins, which allows long NOE-derived distance constraints to be obtained. Prior knowledge of the stereospecific assignment eliminates the need for using pseudo atoms for methylene and prochiral methyl groups. Distance restraints for the structure calculation were obtained from 3-D 15 N-and 13 C-edited NOESY spectra 58 and from a 2-D NOESY spectrum for the aromatic region. These spectra were simplified by the presence of fewer signals, as expected. The reduced spin-diffusion maximum NOE intensities for SAIL proteins were typically reached at 1.5-3 times longer mixing times than with uniform labeling ( Figure 6 ). This simplification of the NMR spectra opens up the possibility of the automated analysis of proteins of 10-20 kDa or higher. The automated NOE assignment algorithm of the program CYANA automatically assigns NOESY cross peaks 59,60 on the basis of the chemical shift assignments and lists the NOESY cross peak positions and intensities. The fully automated NMR structure analysis algorithm (FLYA) 61 can solve NMR protein structures by purely computational means using only the primary structure and the NMR spectra as input. As in the classical manual approach, structures are determined by a set of experimental NOE distance restraints without reference to previously existing structures or empirical molecular modeling information. In addition to the 3-D structure of the protein, FLYA yields backbone and side chain chemical shift assignments and cross peak assignments for all spectra. By uniting optimal labeling with full automation, SAIL-based fully automated protein structure analysis (SAIL-FLYA) is designed to solve protein structures rapidly and with enhanced accuracy and size-range applicability. 46,62",

The previous NMR structure employed residual dipolar couplings measured mainly for the polypeptide backbone, in addition to conventional NOE distance restraints, to improve the structural quality. The application of the SAIL method to the structure of calmodulin vastly improved the quality of the NMR spectra, especially for the side chains. 7 Based on the side chain information, the NMR structure of the SAIL calmodulin showed good convergence for each domain using only NOE distance constraints and TALOS-derived angle constraints (Figure 7(a) ).

These proteins are found in plants as part of a complex with the glucosinolate-degrading enzyme, myrosinase, and are suspected to play a role in the myrosinase-dependent defense against pathogens. Many myrosinase binding proteins and their relatives are composed of repeated homologous sequences with an unknown structure. The size of the protein is larger than that amenable to high-throughput analysis by uniform 13 C/ 15 N labeling methods. Nevertheless, the 3-D structure of the At3g16450.1 protein from Arabidopsis, which consists of two tandem repeats, was solved with SAIL. 66 NMR data sets collected with the SAIL protein enabled the assignment of the 1 H, 13 C, and 15 N chemical shifts to 95.5% of all atoms, even at the low concentration (0.2 mM) of the protein product. Using NOESY data, the 3-D structure was calculated with the CYANA software package. The structure, the first for a myrosinase binding protein family member, revealed that the At3g16450.1 protein consists of two independent, but similar, lectin-fold domains composed of three b sheets (Figure 7(c) ).",

            "text": "The solution structure of the 41-kDa MBP was determined in order to prove that the SAIL method could render large proteins amenable to NMR structure determination. 7 Due to the improved sensitivity and resolution, the signals of SAIL MBP could readily be assigned by established methods to the extent of 94% for SAIL MBP, including more than 90% of the aliphatic and aromatic side chain protons. Many of the shifts that could not be assigned are clustered in the region of residues 229-241, which interacts with the bound cyclodextrin 67 and is assumed to undergo conformational exchange. 68 A dense network of NOEs, including 949 non-redundant, long-range distance restraints, was established for SAIL MBP. Among the 3818 non-redundant NOE distance restraints, 1879 involve side chain atoms beyond H b . On the basis of the simplified and more quantitative NOESY spectra, detailed structures of SAIL MBP were obtained by means of the combined automated NOE assignment and structure calculation protocol in the program CYANA. 59, 60 The solution structure of the 41-kDa SAIL MBP coincides closely with the crystal structure 67 that was determined previously under slightly different conditions (Figure 7(d) ). The 41-kDa SAIL MBP solution structure has similar precision and accuracy to those of smaller proteins, and the structural statistics are comparable to those commonly found in NMR structure determinations of smaller proteins. Previously, 68 a global fold of MBP was determined by NMR on the basis of the NOEs between the amide and methyl protons, the residual dipolar couplings for the polypeptide backbone, and the hydrogen bond restraints. Although that NMR study determined the global fold of the polypeptide backbone and the conformations of the methyl-containing side chains of valine, leucine, and isoleucine, the approach could not provide direct structural information for the other side chains. EPPIb is an 18.2-kDa protein. The backbone assignment of EPPIb was previously accomplished by using a uniformly 13 C, 15 N double-labeled sample prepared by the cell-free method. 69 EPPIb contains 12 Phe and 3 Tyr residues, some of which form a hydrophobic cluster. Thus, the collection of NOEs involving the aromatic residues is essential for the precise structure determination of this protein. For this purpose, the use of SAIL aromatic residues was found to be very effective. The aromatic ring signals of its 12 Phe residues were well resolved for all SAIL Phe types and could be assigned readily by correlating them to the previously assigned backbone signals. 57 Importantly, for the dand e-SAIL Phe-labeled EPPIb proteins, the signals of Phe27, Phe110, and Phe123 were broadened beyond detection due to the intermediate ring flipping rates of these residues at 30 1C, except for a single, very weak peak assigned to the d-13 C/ 1 H signal of Phe110. At 40 1C, this weak d-13 C/ 1 H cross peak became sharper due to the increased ring flipping rate of Phe110. In contrast, all 12 peaks were clearly observed for the z signals in z-SAIL Phelabeled EPPIb. The z signals are not affected by ring flipping because the z 13 C-1 H moiety lies on the C b -C g axis.",

More than 100 NOESY cross peaks involving the aromatic rings of Phe and Tyr were observed for the d-SAIL Phe/Tyr combination, whereas the corresponding number of NOEs for the z-SAIL Phe/e-SAIL Tyr combination was B50. However, approximately half of the NOEs acquired for the d-SAIL Phe/Tyr combination were intraresidual or sequential and thus did not conceivably contribute to defining the overall structure. In contrast, in the case of the z-SAIL Phe/e-SAIL Tyr combination, most of the NOEs were observed between sequentially distant residues. Consequently, the convergence of the resulting structural ensemble calculated with CYANA is much better for the z-SAIL Phe/e-SAIL Tyr combination than for the d-SAIL Phe/Tyr combination (Figure 8 ). The precision of the structure was slightly lower for the d-SAIL Phe/Tyr combination compared to the other structures, especially for two loop regions on the protein surface. This local structural difference is due to the complete lack of NOE restraints between the rings of Phe55 and His147, which were clearly observed for eand z-SAIL Phe but not for d-SAIL Phe. The lack of NOEs for the d and e protons of Phe27, Phe110, and Phe123 is due to the intermediate ring flipping rates and is clearly reflected in the poorly defined ring positions of these three Phe residues, although their backbone conformation was defined by other NOEs. The structure determined by the simultaneous use of all NOEs observed with the aforementioned three combinations of SAIL Phe/Tyr was well-defined, with a root mean square deviation against the crystal structure of EPPIb 70 of 1.43 \u00c5 for the backbone atoms, excluding the unstructured loop regions. Because the structural quality obtained by the z-SAIL Phe/e-SAIL Tyr combination is very similar to that generated by the combined NOE data using all three combinations, the z-SAIL Phe/e-SAIL Tyr combination may be a good choice for structure determinations.",

            "text": "The SAIL method is also a powerful tool for investigations of protein dynamics, as well as the averaged structure. One of the applications is a hydrogen exchange study of Tyr side chain hydroxyl groups. 71 In principle, this method is an extension of the DEALS method, which is used for investigating the hydrogen exchange of backbone amide groups, to study the hydrogen exchange of hydroxyl groups. 20 In the case of Tyr hydroxyl groups, proton/deuterium substitution slightly alters the chemical shifts of the carbon atom at the z position in the Tyr ring by B0.13 ppm due to the proton/deuterium isotope shift effect. In a 1:1 mixture of H 2 O and D 2 O, the 13 C z (-OH) and 13 C z (-OD) peaks are resolved on a carbon spectrum when the residence time of the corresponding hydroxyl proton is longer than the inverse of the deuterium isotope shift effect in hertz; otherwise, they appear as a single averaged peak. However, the observation of such a slight chemical shift is difficult in the case of a uniformly 13 C-labeled Tyr ring due to the broad linewidth of the carbon peaks arising from dipole interactions and scalar couplings. To overcome this problem, (2S,3R)-[b 2 ,e 1,2 -2 H 3 ;0,a,b,z-13 C 4 ; 15 N]-Tyr, z-SAIL Tyr, was synthesized by SAIL technology. In this Tyr aromatic ring, only the carbon at the z position is selectively enriched by 13 C, and the ring protons at the e positions are deuterated (Figure 9 ). This labeling pattern facilitates efficient magnetization transfer between the 1 H d protons and the 13 C z atoms via three-bond scalar couplings, with a size of 7 or 8 Hz. Therefore, the assignment of the 13 C z atoms can readily be performed by the NOE correlation between 1 H b and 1 H d and subsequently by the HSQC correlations between the 1 H d and 13 C z atoms. The linewidth of the 13 C z peak is sharp enough to observe the slight deuterium isotope shift effect from the hydroxyl group. Phenylalanine and tyrosine residues are colored red. His147 is colored cyan.",

The isotope labeling approach has great potential to address the size problem of NMR, and the combined and sophisticated use of 2 H, 13 C, and 15 N isotopes promises to expand the applicability of NMR for investigating various biological and biophysical problems. The essential concept of the SAIL method is to optimize the isotope labeling patterns of amino acids, and thus the proteins labeled with such amino acids, for various steps of protein NMR spectroscopy, such as data acquisition, spectral analysis, structural determination, relaxation analysis and dynamics, and protein-protein and protein-ligand interactions. This chapter described only a small portion of the numerous possible applications to be explored in the future, for which only NMR spectroscopy can be used. Developments in NMR instrumentation, including superconducting magnets as high as 1 GHz and highly sensitive cryogenic probes for various applications, have made NMR spectroscopy an even more important technique to bridge protein structures and their biological functions. In this context, the further optimization of NMR samples based on the SAIL concept will be the most crucial issue for the NMR spectroscopy of biological macromolecules. ",
