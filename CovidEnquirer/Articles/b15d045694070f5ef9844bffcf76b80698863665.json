            "text": "Given the highly contagious and acute nature of porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED), especially in piglets, there is an urgent need for the development of rapid and sensitive diagnostic assays. The diagnostic potentials of specific porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) accessory and nonstructural proteins, if any, have not yet been investigated. In order to determine and compare which of the viral proteins may be useful as diagnostic antigens, whole virus (WV) particles and a panel of structural and nonstructural PEDV proteins [spike subunit 1 (S1), the C-terminal part of ORF3 (ORF3C), envelope (E), nonstructural protein 1 (Nsp1), Nsp2, Ac (acidic domain of Nsp3), and ADRP (ADP-ribose-1-monophosphatase domain of Nsp3), expressed individually in bacterial and/or mammalian cells] were tested for reactivity with sera from PEDV-infected pigs by ELISA and/or western blot analysis. According to western blots, serum antibody interactions with the S1 protein were relatively more sensitive and specific than ORF3C, E and Ac. Furthermore, a total of 851 serum samples from diarrheal pigs of different ages were analyzed by ELISA, with most showing immune-reactivity towards the WV, S1, ORF3C, and E proteins. The earliest IgG antibody response was observed in the one-week-old piglets, with similar antibody ontogeny and patterns of seroconversion for S1, ORF3C, E, and WV antigens. In addition, the pattern of neutralizing antibody was more similar to that of IgA in weaning piglets after PEDV infection. Collectively, these data provide more reliable information on the host immune response to different viral proteins, which will be useful for development of novel serological assays and for design of vaccines that better stimulate protective immunity.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea (PED) is characterized by severe diarrhea, vomiting, and dehydration followed by high mortality in suckling piglets . The causative agent, porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), was initially identified in Europe in 1978, and its genome (\u02dc28 kb in size) consists of seven open reading frames (ORFs) (Kocherhans et al., 2001) . The 5' two-thirds of PEDV genome encodes ORF1 (consisting of overlapping ORF1a and ORF1b), and the 3' onethird harbors ORFs encoding four structural proteins, the spike (S), envelope (E), membrane (M) and nucleocapsid (N), and an accessory ORF3 between S and E Kocherhans et al., 2001; Tian et al., 2014) . RNA synthesis in PEDV is carried out by a replicase-transcriptase composed of 16 nonstructural proteins (Nsp1-16) encoded by ORF1a and ORF1b. Among them, Nsp3 comprises multiple structural domains, including a highly acidic domain at the amino terminus (Ac), and a highly conserved ADP-ribose-1-phosphatase (ADRP) macrodomain. The Ac domain of Nsp3 is essential for virion assembly and plays a critical role in interaction with the viral nucleocapsid during early infection, whereas the ADRP provides activities necessary for synthesis of genomic and subgenomic RNAs (Hurst-Hess et al., 2015) . As pigs of all ages are susceptible to PEDV (Alvarez et al., 2015; Annamalai et al., 2015) , there is an urgent need for the development of highly sensitive and specific diagnostic assays for use in the field (Diel et al., 2016) .",

Another common diagnostic method is serological testing for the presence of specific antibodies against viral proteins, which is also fast and convenient for epidemiologic investigations. Many tools have been developed for the detection of anti-PEDV antibodies based upon the major structural proteins (such as S, M or N proteins) in serum, colostrum, milk, feces and oral fluid, including indirect immunofluorescence assays (IFA), virus neutralization assays (SN), enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (ELISA), and fluorescent microsphere immunoassays (FMIA) (Diel et al., 2016; Gerber et al., 2014; Gerber and Opriessnig, 2015; Gimenez-Lirola et al., 2017; Okda et al., 2015) . But comparative studies of the above assays using different PEDV structural and nonstructural proteins as antigens are rarely conducted. Meanwhile, the diagnostic potentials of specific PEDV accessory and nonstructural proteins, if any, have not yet been investigated in details.",

The E protein was not used to immunize rabbits in this study. Staining of anti-Ac polyclonal serum resulted in specific fluorescence at 48 h post-infection ( Fig. 2A, B ) similar to the signal observed using the anti-S1 MAb as the positive control (Fig. 2G, H) . Specific fluorescence was also detected with the anti-ORF3C (Fig. 2C, D) and the anti-Nsp2 polyclonal antibodies (Fig. 2E, F) . In contrast, no specific fluorescence was observed when using the anti-ADRP and anti-Nsp1 polyclonal antibodies. IFA with pre-immune rabbit sera displayed no fluorescent signal in Vero cells infected with PEDV (Fig. 2I, J) . The viral antigens were all detected in the cytoplasm of the infected cells.

In this study, in order to determine the pattern of antibody response of weaning piglets in a 17-day weaning period after PEDV infection, serum or fecal samples from experimentally-infected 3-day-old piglets were examined by ELISA based on the PEDV WV or the S1 protein, and by serum neutralization test (Fig. 3) . The results indicated that IgG and IgA responses against both antigens were detected in serum at different time points after PEDV infection ( Fig. 3A and B ). Despite challenge with PEDV in these piglets, levels of serum IgG and IgA decreased from 1 dpi, reaching a minimum after 7 dpi as detected by both WV and S1 antigens (Fig. 3A, B) , and the pattern or trend of neutralizing antibody (NA) was more similar to that of IgA (Fig. 3C) . A good linear relationship between the S1-based IgA ELISA titers and NA titers was observed (Spearman's rank correlation coefficient of 0.98; p < 0.001), demonstrating the correlation between them (Fig. 3D ). There were some differences in the sensitivity of the antigens to detect antibodies, as levels of serum IgA were slightly higher when the S1 protein was used as the detection antigen. Levels of fecal IgA were also highest before challenge (0 dpi), and continuously declined after challenge (Fig. 3E) . The specificity and sensitivity of detection of S1 and WV antigens were similar for serum IgA. The high IgG and IgA antibodies and NA detected at the early stages of the weaning piglets are presumably maternal antibodies received from sows that were not PEDV negative. In addition, piglets during weaning have not developed their own immunity to the virus. These results also demonstrated that the S1-based ELISA is an alternative (to WV-based) and ideal serological assay for detection of anti-PEDV antibodies.",

Overall, the levels of antibodies against PEDV WV and the three proteins antigens were generally higher in primiparous and multiparous sows than those in 3-5 weeks-old pigs (p < 0.01). The trend of serum IgG response to each PEDV antigen from the 1-week-old to the 3-week-old pigs was similar to that of the experimentally-infected weaning piglets (Fig. 3A) . Antibodies were highest in the 1 week-old piglets (p < 0.01) except for WV antigen, and then declined to a minimum by 5 weeks-of-age significantly (p < 0.01) before increasing again to a relatively stable level from 7 to 20 weeks-of-age (Fig. 5B ,C; p < 0.01). This pattern was in agreement with a recent report about the prevalence of PEDV antibodies in swine farms (Bertasio et al., 2016) , which might reflect that newborn piglets receive maternal IgG antibodies from sows, though the level of the antibodies decline quickly, and the weaned piglets must begin to develop their own immunity to PEDV.",

PEDV herd-infection status is very important for biosecurity and the control of PED. Compared to RT-PCR and other nuclei acid detection assays, serological tests are advantageous to study immune responses related to vaccination, wild-type virus infection, and to determine whether sow immunity is adequate in individual litters after PEDV exposure (Diel et al., 2016) . PEDV infection is not always obvious in finishing pigs, which increases the risk of widespread disease in pigs of all ages (Bertasio et al., 2016) . Thus, sensitive serological tests would allow detection of recent infections, to avoid the introduction of these animals into na\u00efve herds. However, there are many different structural and non-structural proteins to choose from when selecting an antigen to use in novel diagnostic assays. Previously, we have developed and validated indirect ELISA based on the S1 protein to detect anti-PEDV IgG and IgA antibodies in postweaning pigs (Gerber et al., 2014) . The present study was set up to investigate diagnostic potentials of specific PEDV accessory and nonstructural proteins, which have not yet been reported systematically. Fig. 4 . Detection of antibodies against PEDV peptides in porcine sera by western blot. Representative serum samples from diarrheic pigs were used in western blots to detect PEDV S1 (A), Ac (B), ORF3C (C), and E proteins (D); 5 \u03bcg of recombinant peptides were loaded in each lane. HRP-conjugated goat anti-porcine IgG was used as the secondary antibody, and PEDV-negative serum was used as negative control. Fig. 5 . Distribution of cumulative IgG ELISA sample-to-positive (S/P) ratios in serum samples collected from diarrheic pigs at commercial pig farms. Various indirect ELISA assays based on PEDV whole virus (WV) (A), S1 (B), ORF3C (C), and E proteins (D) were used to test serum samples from commercial sows and pigs with diarrhea at different ages with unknown PEDV infectious status. Sera from na\u00efve piglets were used as negative controls; samples above the determined S/P cutoff (dashed line) were considered positive. One-way analysis of variance (ANOVA) was used for multiple comparisons between different ages among the individual antigens with an alpha value of 0.01. The \"ns\" denoted no statistical differences.",

The pattern of change in anti-PEDV IgG/IgA from serum samples and in anti-PEDV IgA fecal samples (immediate decline post-infection) indicates that the piglets had obtained maternal antibodies at birth, and did not produced antibodies even after PEDV challenge until their immune system matured. Additionally, levels of NA were more closely correlated with IgA than IgG (Fig. 3B-D) , as seen in other studies (Paudel et al., 2014) . Abundant anti-PEDV NA have been demonstrated in colostrum on the day of birth, decreasing rapidly in milk by day 3, and gradually declining further from days 3-19 post-farrowing, which may contribute to variable protective capacity . The current study showed a similar decline, further confirming the reliability of the S1-based ELISA assays applicable to weaning pigs in addition to postweaning pigs (Gerber et al., 2014; Gerber and Opriessnig, 2015) , and also highlighting the importance of accurate diagnosis in a short window for proper immunization of sows and piglets.",

It is worth noting that the recombinant S1 protein was expressed in a eukaryotic expression system and should display a natural conformation with high glycosylation, as shown in Fig. 1D , which may be one reason for its higher detection sensitivity. On the other hand, WV was mainly purified by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, differential centrifugation or polyethylene glycol (PEG) precipitation (Hoffmann and Robert, 1990) . These methods would damage the integrity of the virus, especially the surface spike glycoprotein. Therefore, the eukaryotic-expressed S1 protein is likely more advantageous than the WV as the antigen for PEDV serological assays. For another two major structural proteins M and N, due to common epitopes shared by PEDV, TGEV and PDCoV, several studies have previously demonstrated that PEDV M or N presented some cross-reactivity to TGEV or PDCoV (Gimenez-Lirola et al., 2017; Lin et al., 2015; Ma et al., 2016) . In contrast, recombinant PEDV-S1 had no cross-reactivity with sera from these porcine coronaviruses, showing the best diagnostic sensitivity (Gimenez-Lirola et al., 2017) . Therefore, we did not pursue the development of serological assays based on M or N proteins in this study.",

The small structural E protein has important roles in the assembly of coronavirus virions, virus egress and in the host stress response (Ruch and Machamer, 2012) . Besides the structural proteins, PEDV has several non-structural proteins (Nsp1, Nsp2, Nsp3, among others) that express in the early stage of virus infection and have important functions in the viral replication cycle. The coronavirus Nsp3 is a conserved component of the viral protein processing machinery, and may be incorporated in the virion viaits intimate association with viral RNA (Neuman et al., 2008) . The Nsp3 is known as the largest replicase subunit, consisting of numerous distinct structural domains separated by disordered linkers. Some of these, such as the Ac and ADRP (macrodomain), are well conserved across all genera of coronaviruses, though there have been no reports about serological assays based on PEDV Ac and ADRP domains. Considering their potential use in the study of host immune response, these proteins were specifically included in the current study.",

Subsequently, they were used individually as detection antigens in western blot and/or indirect ELISAs to detect anti-PEDV IgG antibodies in sera from diarrheic pigs (Fig. 5) . The PEDV WV and the recombinant S1 expressed from mammalian cells was used for comparison. The S1, ORF3C, and E peptides each reacted strongly with the sera, reflecting expected distributions of PEDV-specific antibodies. The reactivity of Ac, ADRP, Nsp1 and Nsp2 peptides was less pronounced (data not shown), thus they were discarded from consideration as novel diagnostic antigens. The generally high level of IgG against S1, ORF3C, and E proteins in old-age pigs was consistent with recent reports that anti-PEDV IgG in infected pigs persisted for over than 17 weeks after the onset of diarrhea symptoms (Lin et al., 2016) . All antibody levels declined to their lowest levels at 3 weeks-of-age, which was consistent with the result from experimentally-infected piglets at weaning (Fig. 3) . Western blot was implemented to confirm the ELISAs, with additional \"fuzzy\" bands appeared when the ORF3C, Ac and E were used as detection antigens, indicating non-specific recognition (Fig. 4) . This may be related to differences in antigens used and/or the sensitivity of the assays for detecting anti-PEDV antibodies.",

Negatively-stained PEDV particles showing pleomorphism are labeled with black arrows whereas the \"regular\" virions (rounded or elongated shaped) are marked by white arrows. The bar represents 100 nm. (B) Western blot analysis of recombinant PEDV Ac, E and ORF3C peptides. Expression of PEDV Ac, E and ORF3C peptides in bacteria was confirmed with an anti-His monoclonal antibody (MAb). Approximately 150 ng of each protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to western blot. (C) SDS-PAGE and western blot analysis of recombinant PEDV Nsp1, ADRP and Nsp2 peptides. Expression of PEDV Nsp1, ADRP and Nsp2 peptides was identified using SDS-PAGE (left panel) and confirmed with an anti-His MAb (right panel). Approximately 100 ng of each protein were separated by SDS-PAGE and subjected to western blot. An HRPconjugated goat anti-mouse IgG was used as the secondary antibody. (D) SDS-PAGE of the recombinant PEDV S1 peptide. The arrowheads indicate bands of the target proteins.",
