Methods: Retrospective case series of patients managed by our mobile extracorporeal membrane oxygenation team and transferred to San Gerardo University Hospital from December 2004 to December 2012. Results: 42 patients were transported. The mean age was 42.11 (standard deviation \u00b118.11) years, with a range between 2 years and 70. 14 patients were females (33%) and 28 males (67%). The average transport distance was 121.69 km (\u00b1183.08) with a range between 9 km and 1044 Km. The mission's mean time was equal to 508 minutes (\u00b1185) with range of 120-960 minutes. 29 patients (69%) were transported with extracorporeal membrane oxygenation support, while 13 patients (31%) were transported with conventional ventilation. In 28 patients (97%) a veno-venous bypass was utilized, while in one case (3%) a Veno-Arterial cannulation was performed. 32 patients survived (76%) and have been discharged alive from hospital. No major clinical or technical issues were observed during the transport. Conclusions: According to our data, we conclude that a dedicated mobile team allowed safe ground transportation of patients with severe acute lung injury to our tertiary care institution.",

Patient's safety is dependant on the adherence to transport's protocols (4, 5) . Patients af-fected by Adult Respiratory Distress Syndrome (ARDS) present with hypoxia and instability of gases exchange, a situation which may require the use of extracorporeal respiratory support (ECMO -Extra Corporeal Membrane oxygenation) as an emergency life-saving therapy or as a protective strategy to prevent further barotraumas from mechanical ventilation (ALI -acute lung injury) (6) (7) (8) (9) (10) . In many cases, patients with ARDS should be referred to an ECMO centre, but the severe and often rapid onset of hypoxia, not manageable with conventional treatments, Heart, Lung and Vessels. 2014, Vol. 6 may not allow for a safe conventional transport (11) (12) (13) (14) . The General Intensive Care of San Gerardo University Hospital-Monza has been working since 1989 as an Italian ECMO referring centre. Up to 2004, patients from different hospitals eligible for ECMO treatment were transported with conventional ventilation techniques by the same hospital's clinical team, increasing in this way risks related to unsafe transport. In 2004, inspired by similar programs carried out in other countries, we implemented and put in practice a new program of ECMO positioning at the reporting ICU and consequent inter-hospital transport of these patients (8, 11) . The basic team consist of two intensivists, an ICU nurse and a perfusionist. The aim of this paper is to present our 8-year experience on inter-hospital transport of patients with severe acute respiratory failure managed by our mobile transport team (which also has ECMO capability).",

All consecutive patients transferred by our mobile transport team were included in the study. Clinical records (Innovian Medical Suite \u00a9 -Drager Medical) and manual data sheets were retro- spectively reviewed. Due to the retrospective observational design of the study, informed consent was waived, according to Italian Regulations (AIFA, Directive of March 20, 2008) . Data from the fi rst 14 transports have previously been published (13) . All patient transfers were performed from local trust to San Gerardo Hospital (SGH) and subsequently admitted into our 10-bedded General ICU. The National Health insurance covered the expenses of the transport, and the average cost was 10.000,00\u20ac \u00b1 800,00 per transport (ambulance 720,00 \u20ac \u00b1278,00 -staff 2.500,00 \u20ac \u00b1780,00 -medical devices: 6.500,00 \u20ac \u00b1100,00). The alert protocol and procedure for patient eligible for ECMO treatment was based on phone call to our unit for the fi rst evaluation and commence for possible transport activation ( Figure 1) . Criteria for ECMO team activation were: reversible respiratory failure, PaO 2 value <50 mmHg with FiO 2 \u226560% for more 12 hours, Lung Injury Score \u22653; or respiratory acidosis pH \u22647.2 (13) . Exclusion criteria were: intracranial bleeding/haemorrhage, unable to undergoing to heparinization, negative prognosis,body weight \u2265130 Kg (logistic and equipment restrictions). The internal standard procedure, in case of positive assessment for transport, guarantee an ECMO crew activation time within 60 to 90 minutes after the distress call. The basic team includes two intensivists (MD), one Registered Nurse specialist (RN) and one perfusionist. When possible, a professional on training joined the mission for transport education. The transportation program began in 2004 based on experience gained by our ICU staff from in-hospital patient transport on extracorporeal support (14) . Since 1994, in hospital transfers were performed by a mobilization system able to house all the biomedical equipment. This tool underwent continuous evaluation to optimize logistics and performance (15) . This device is composed of an x-ray spine board compatible and multi-storey counter top. The pulmonary ventilator, the ECMO pump, syringe pumps and monitoring are placed on shelves. The counter top is equipped with an electrical junction box that provides power to all equipment by a single connection from the main electricity network.

Many patients referred for ECMO treatment cannot take benefits from this advanced support due to high risks of death related to an ordinary transfer based on standard respiratory setting. Implementing the ECMO cannulation standards outside of SGH required several steps. The first transport required two days of preparation to assemble the equipment and suitable staff. The ambulance choice required a strict collaboration between ICU staff, ambulance crew and the SGH medical physics dept., to get through/to rule out all the technical issues related to the vehicle (electricity power supply and medical gas circuit). The nursing staff that carried out the transport was trained on fieldwork by tutoring, which was held after the first transport, according to the literature (20, 21) . In order to be qualified for transport, these are the minimum requirements: two years experience in ICU, 2 in hospital cannulation, 2 in intra-hospital transport experience and two out of hospital missions supervised by a qualified nurse. The nursing staff education (theoretical and practical) was managed by the head nurse and a senior qualified nurse. To sort out the mission different paper-work (flow charts and checklists) were created in order to verify the equipments (22, 23) . Patients included in this report had an average severe hypoxia (pO 2 : 64.96\u00b118.15 mmHg). Despite their respiratory instability, the cardiovascular status of patients was stable. The transport described above requireed a great preparation time compared with traditional techniques. Benefits of this system involve the absence of extra adjustments after this stage, so patient will be ready to be transported straight to ambulance, furthermore after positioning in the back, there is no need to rearrange any equipment (syringe pumps ,circuit, ventilator) because they are already settled, reducing the time of transfer and possible complications according to the literature (13, 14) . All the equipment's packs for transport are dedicated to ECMO transports only (24) . It makes easier to perform the quality checks and battery packs levels. These are relevant facts, identified as the most responsible in the case of adverse events such as battery failure (25, 26) . Finally, it is important to point out our attitude and confidence, as referral centre, in using intensive care ventilators to perform ECMO transport compared with dedicated transport's ventilator (27, 28 (30) ; b) since the number of ventilation days before ECMO institution is clearly related to survival, it is of paramount importance that all patients deemed eligible for ECMO treatment are referred as early as possible to a specialized ICU. These data is similar to those published by all centers related to Italian \"ECMOnet\" (12) .",

            "text": "). Our choice is related to an operating principle of veno-venous circuit. With a severe hypoxic patient due to ARDS, the oxygenation is strictly related to the amount of blood volume able to get trough the gas exchange membrane surface (natural and artificial lung). In case of high cardiac output, not unusual in patients with ARDS, just a portion of the total flow could pass through the artificial membrane lung. The average Blood Flow of the subjects investigated was equal to 2.96 L/min (\u00b10.93). It means that a certain part of the blood flow should be oxygenated via the natural lung. In order to perform advanced respiratory care with high levels of PEEP despite a very poor compliance, it is essential to use high performance ventilators able to get advanced ventilation settings, allowing to mix them as well (Volume guaranteed steady pressure \u00ae -CPPV Autoflow \u00ae , Sigh option on control ventilation \u00ae ) and with high air-operating performance. The average level of PEEP during missions was equal to16.50 (\u00b13.84) cm H 2 O. Our results confirm two important findings reported in the recent literature: a) transfer to a tertiary-level ICU with ECMO capability has a positive impact on patients' outcome",
