For quantification of the viral content of the vaccine, dilution series of the final product are inoculated in embryonated chicken eggs. After the incubation period of seven days standard practice is for the embryos to be taken from each egg and examined visually for IB specific lesions; these readings are used to determine an end-point in viral titrations. The result is a titre value to which both strains contribute. However, it is not clear what the live virus titre is for strain IB H120 and for strain IB D274. In order to determine end-points in the titration for each of the two strains, we collected the allantoic fluids from each egg after the incubation period and tested these for the presence of IB H120 and IB D274 by a strain specific reverse phase PCR. Based on the data obtained by PCR we were able to determine an end-point for each of the two strains. For a given commercial batch of Poulvac IB primer we determined titres of 10 6.31 EID 50 per vial for IB H120 and 10 6.59 EID 50 for IB D274 using PCR for end-point determination. These end-points matched well with the end-point determined for both strains cumulatively after visual examination, i.e. 10 6.67 EID 50 per vial. It is concluded that PCR is a suitable means to determine end-points in titrations of live viruses.",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a coronavirus, is one of the foremost causes of economic losses within the poultry industry, affecting the performance of both meat-providing and egg-laying chickens (Cavanagh, 2007; De Wit et al., 2011) . The major reason for the high profile of IBV is due to the existence of a very large number of serotypes, although the virus is also highly contagious. In order to control the disease in poultry, both live and inactivated IB vaccines are used extensively. The nature of the protective immune response to IBV is poorly understood, but research has demonstrated that the surface spike protein, and particularly the amino-terminal S1 portion, is sufficient to induce good protective immunity. There is increasing evidence that only a few amino acid differences amongst S proteins are sufficient to have a detrimental impact on cross-protection (Cavanagh, 2007) . As it is not always clear which serotype is responsible for any health problems in poultry, combinations of vaccines are widely used to generate broad protection * Corresponding author.

Another possibility is to use vaccines which contain a combination of different vaccine viral strains. Zoetis is marketing a live combination vaccine for chickens named Poulvac \u00ae IB Primer. This lyophilized vaccine contains two attenuated infectious bronchitis strains, IB H120 (MacDonald and McMartin, 1976) and IB D274 (Kusters et al., 1987) . Both vaccine strains have been attenuated by passage in embryonated chicken eggs, which is the usual method for attenuation of infectious bronchitis viruses and development of vaccines (MacDonald and McMartin, 1976; Klieve and Cummings, 1988; Jackwood et al., 2003; Liu et al., 2007) . In order to quantify the viral content of the vaccine, dilution series of the final product are inoculated in 10 days embryonated chicken eggs. After the incubation period the eggs are opened and the embryos removed for examination of IB specific lesions. The product titre defined is the reciprocal value of the dilution causing embryonal lesions in 50% of the eggs. For the combination vaccine Poulvac \u00ae IB Primer the result is a cumulative titre to which both IB strains contribute. In order to titrate both virus strains separately, strain specific neutralizing antisera have been tested. It has been shown that antiserum against strain IB D274 does not cross-react with strain IB H120 (Kusters et al., 1987) and it was speculated that antiserum against IB H120 would not cross react with strain IB D274. However, during titration experiments it was determined Table 1 PCR primers for detection of the strains IB H120 and IB D274, with the respective PCR product size in base pairs.",

After the routine incubation period samples of the allantoic fluids were tested also by PCR. It now appeared that after the egg passage dilutions up to 10 \u22126 were positive by PCR for IB D274 and dilutions up to 10 \u22127 were positive by PCR for IB H120, see Table 2 . The embryos were also examined visually, and the results show that at a dilution of 10 \u22126 all (5 of 5) embryos were affected by the virus. At a dilution of 10 \u22127 one of 5 embryos was affected. The only possible explanation for the presence of IB H120 and IB D274 in the allantoic fluids was that the viruses had been able to cause a productive infection in the eggs. It is concluded that in this test live virus titres were determined.",

            "text": "Numerous publications are available in which viral titrations and possible issues have been described. For several viruses tissue culture methods can be used, in which a positive response can be observed by examination of monolayers of cells for the presence of a cytopathogenic effect (Heldt et al., 2006) . If the virus does not form a cytopathogenic effect, the presence of live virus in the culture can be demonstrated by methods using colour agents (Heldt et al., 2006) or specific antibodies (Zielinska et al., 2005; Yap and Lam, 1994) . For avian viruses suitable substrates are needed and sometimes there are different possibilities (Nicholas et al., 1986) . For titrations in embryonated eggs the presence of the virus in allantoic fluid can be tested using a specific property of the virus, for example its ability to cause haemagglutination (Klimov et al., 2012) . The presence or absence of lesions on the embryos also can be used to determine the presence of live virus, such as has been demonstrated for IB viruses (De Wit, 2000) . The use of PCR for screening samples from titrations for the presence of virus has not been described previously. Initially PCR was used mainly for testing for the presence of viruses or other infectious agents in samples (Tafuro et al., 1996) . Currently, with the introduction of real time PCR it is possible to determine quantities of virus particles in samples (Hiroshi Kimura et al., 1999; Isabel Costafreda et al., 2006; Spackman and Suarez, 2008) . Because of its specificity it is possible also to detect more than one virus strain in one test using PCR (Van Elden et al., 2001) .",

Based on the results of the PCR we determined whether an allantoic fluid was positive for one or both of the viruses or not, and as such we were able to define a separate endpoint in the live virus titration for each of the two strains. It has to be clear that this is not the same as a quantitative PCR. In a quantitative PCR the number of genomic fragments is determined based on the number of cycles in the real time PCR required for a positive response. In such a PCR genomic fragments coming from live as well as 'dead' virus particles are determined. In the test described in this paper we determined whether an egg was positive for the presence of virus coming from a productive infection using PCR with a fixed number of cycles. Only a live virus particle can cause a productive infection. If the egg would have been inoculated with a dead virus particle, it would not have given a positive response in the PCR. The titration method using PCR for testing the allantoic fluids is highly suitable to determine titres of different vaccine strains in one presentation. The PCR could be used also for end-point determinations of other IB strains, for example IB strains which do not have a very clear effect on embryos making it difficult to read egg titrations visually. Furthermore, the use of PCR for end-point determination makes it possible also to perform titrations on a large scale using specialized equipment.",
