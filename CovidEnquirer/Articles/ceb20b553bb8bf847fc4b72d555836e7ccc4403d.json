Methods: A total of 10,429 specimens were analyzed, and IgM antibodies against 9 respiratory pathogens including MP were detected using indirect immunofluorescence assay from serum. Results: It showed that 59.3% of the enrolled children were positive for at least 1 pathogen; highest detection rates included those between 3 and <6 years of age (70.4%), female (63.2%), and who were hospitalized in 2014 (80.9%). The most predominant pathogen was MP (45.6%), followed by Parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) (22.6%) and influenza B viruses (IFVB) (14.7%). Coinfection was observed in 2,907 specimens (27.9%); the coinfection combination containing MP and PIVs had the highest detection rate of 15%, followed by MP and IFVB as well as IFVB and PIVs. Conclusions: MP was the most commonly detected bacteria among hospitalized children, which should be included in the differential diagnosis for hospitalized children with RTI. These findings will contribute to the effective prevention and therapeutic approaches of pathogens among local children suffering from RTI.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] From the severe acute respiratory syndrome outbreak in 2003, the influenza A (H1N1) pandemic in 2009, to the influenza A (H7N9) pandemic in 2013, new respiratory infections have become increasingly important in modern infectious diseases, especially H1N1. The US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention first reported 2 cases of H1N1 in April, 2009 . And the outbreak spread rapidly around the world, the WHO announced that it had raised its alert level to phase \u2165 marking the start of a pandemic on June 11, 2009 . The first imported case in mainland China was reported on 11 May, 2009 . Then the H1N1 epidemic in mainland China has increased rapidly and spread widely, with the outbreak of H1N1 mainly in schools. WHO declared the epidemic was ended on August 10, 2010. Over time, however, the virus continues to mutate. It is clear that respiratory infections caused by virus are a serious threat to children health, we need to be constantly vigilant against it.",

It belongs to a transitional climate zone, featuring weather between subtropical to warm temperate. Climate is with 4 distinct seasons: spring is dry and windy; summer is hot, rainy, and humid; autumn is long and sunny; and winter is cold with little rain or snow. Limited data exist on the epidemiology of respiratory pathogens, MP in particular, causing RTIs from children in the region of Luoyang. Therefore, we recruited the hospitalized children in pediatric ward at the Luoyang Central Hospital, to evaluate the epidemiologic characteristics of 9 respiratory pathogens including MP among hospitalized children with RTI from June 2014 to May 2019. We investigated MP, Legionella pneumophila (LP), Coxiella burnetiid (CB), and Chlamydophila pneumoniae (CP), and 5 respiratory viruses: respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), adenovirus (ADV), influenza A viruses (IFVA), influenza B viruses (IFVB), and Parainfluenza 1, 2, and 3 viruses (PIVs). Although respiratory pathogens have different epidemic characteristics in different geographic regions and populations, respiratory diseases spread quickly and widely. Even now we only deal with the population in Luoyang, which also has high value and contribute to a further understanding of the prevalence.",

Our study is a retrospectively observational case control study. A total of 10,429 specimens have taken from children (\u226414 years old) and tested between June 1, 2014 and May 31, 2019. In this study, we analyzed IgM antibodies against 9 respiratory pathogens using indirect immunofluorescence assay from serum. Sometimes it is not possible to obtain a respiratory sample in some patients, due to his/her age, symptomatology or any special circumstance; in these cases, blood samples are needed for serologic analyses. Health care workers are well trained to obtain blood samples but not all of them are properly trained for obtaining high quality respiratory samples. When a quick and secure transport condition shipment of the respiratory samples cannot be guaranteed, it may be advisable to obtain blood samples rather than respiratory ones. IgG and IgM antibodies show a different behavior during the primoinfections and reinfections. In a primoinfection, IgG and IgM appear in almost all cases (IgM appears earlier than IgG). In reinfections IgM antibodies do not appear in all cases; therefore, IgG detection is the only method that is useful to perform the diagnosis. High titers of IgG can exist in many diseases during the whole patient life, while IgM, generally, only is measurable in sera during 2 or 3 months after the infection, and therefore is an ideal marker of recent infections.",
