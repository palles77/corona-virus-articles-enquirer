Crystal structures of several protein complexes, including mitochondrial respiratory chain complex II, have been characterised, 11 and the fi rst human proteome catalogue for the liver has been generated. 12 Advances in other domains have also been made-eg, the eff ect of lymphoid microenvironments on dendritic cells 13 and signal transduction, such as the involvement of \u03b2 arrestin in the regulation of G-protein-coupled receptor signalling. 14 Biochips have been applied to clinical medicine and food safety.

This strategy suggests that excellence in cutting-edge technologies should be pursued along with a serve-all approach. In the Guidelines on National Medium-and Long-term Program for S&T Development (2006 Development ( -2020 , drug innovation and prevention and control of major emerging infectious diseases have been listed as two of 16 mega projects. 17 In line with the notion of predictive, preven tive, personalised, and participatory medicine, disease prevention should be a priority, with importance attached to provision of clean drinking water, environ mental health, natural disasters and disaster prepared ness, large-scale production of good-quality food, drug, and vaccine production and regulation, production of reliable reagents for diagnosis and screening, and devel op ment of an e-health-care system to manage chronic non-communicable diseases. Moreover, modern isation of traditional Chinese medicine will be strengthened by multicentre clinical trials to evaluate effi cacy, and to implement standardisation and quality control, and also by studying systems biomedicine. 18 China's translational research capacity will be improved by combining its clinical resources and research strength, while creating an environment that considers ethical, legal, and societal input. While encouraging indigenous innovation, China needs to further extend international collaboration through personal exchanges and joint projects. We believe that all these factors will contribute to the improvement of public health in the 21st century.",
