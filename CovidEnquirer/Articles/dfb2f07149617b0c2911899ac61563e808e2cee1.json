In addition, with the change of time, multiple evidence (i.e. 3 3 7 haplotype number, Tajima's D, Fu's FS) indicated a relatively highest population 3 3 8 growth at around 21 st -27 th of January (Table S3 ). The demographic expansion of 3 3 9 SARS-CoV-2 during this period was consistent with the patients first diagnosed on 8 th 3 4 0 December, 2019 [4, 19] and the previously suggested most recent common ancestor 3 4 1 (TMRCA) dates for SARS-CoV-2 at 6 th December, 2019) [17] . Additionally, 3 4 2 considering that the virus has longest reported incubation period of up to 24 days [6], 3 4 3 the virus may had first infected humans in mid to late November, which is basically 3 4 4 consistent with the results of previous studies [25] . Therefore, in this study, EBSP 3 4 5 revealed that SARS-CoV-2 experienced an effective population size expansion since 3 4 6 7 th December 2019, which was also supported by a star-like network, EBSP, the 3 4 7 neutral tests (Fu's and Tajima's D test) and mismatch analysis.
