In infected cells, we detected the actual existence of nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2. Cleavage sites between nsp1\u03b1/nsp1\u03b2 and nsp1\u03b2/nsp2 were identified by protein microsequencing analysis. Time course study showed that nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 mainly localize into the cell nucleus after 10 h post infection. Further analysis revealed that both proteins dramatically inhibited IFN-\u03b2 expression. The nsp1\u03b2 was observed to significantly inhibit expression from an interferon-stimulated response element promoter after Sendai virus infection or interferon treatment. It was further determined to inhibit nuclear translocation of STAT1 in the JAK-STAT signaling pathway. These results demonstrated that nsp1\u03b2 has ability to inhibit both interferon synthesis and signaling, while nsp1\u03b1 alone strongly inhibits interferon synthesis. These findings provide important insights into mechanisms of nsp1 in PRRSV pathogenesis and its impact in vaccine development.",

            "text": "The host innate immune response is the first defense line to prevent viral infection. A key aspect of the antiviral innate immune response is the synthesis and secretion of type I interferons (IFN) such as IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2, which exhibit antiviral, anti-proliferative and immunomodulatory functions (reviewed by Samuel, 2001; Haller and Weber, 2007; Randall and Goodbourn, 2008) . Two events required to trigger an effective antiviral innate immune response are: (a) detection of the invading virus by immune system receptors; and (b) initiation of protein signaling cascades that regulate the synthesis of IFNs. Initially, the pathogen-associated molecular pattern in dsRNA is recognized by host cell receptors, including Toll-like receptor 3 (TLR3), retinoic acid-inducible protein I (RIG-I) or melanoma differentiationassociated gene 5 (MDA5). In one dsRNA-signaling pathway, RIG-1 caspase recruitment domains associate with IFN-\u03b2 promoter stimulator 1 (IPS-1) to activate the downstream kinases, such as TBK1 and IKK\u025b, resulting in the phosphorylation and activation of transcription factors, including IRF3 and NF-kB. The coordinate activation of these transcription factors results in the formation of a transcriptionally competent enhanceosome that induces type I IFN production (Thanos and Maniatis, 1995) . After being secreted, type I IFN binds to their receptors on adjacent cell surfaces to activate the so-called JAK-STAT signaling pathway. The coupling of receptor-ligand activates JAKs (Janus activated kinases), leading to phosphorylation of STATs (signal transducers and activators of transcription). The phosphorylated STAT1 and STAT2, in association with IRF9, form the heterotrimeric complex ISGF3. ISGF3 translocates to the nucleus where it binds to IFNstimulated response elements (ISRE) in the promoter and induces the transcription of IFN-stimulated genes (ISGs). Activation of these genes enables the cell to fight the infection and inhibit virus replication (Weber et al., 2004) .",

            "text": "Previous studies have demonstrated the important role of interferon-mediated innate immune responses against PRRSV infection. In an earlier study, inoculation of pigs with porcine respiratory coronavirus, a potent inducer of type I interferon, provided protection from a subsequent PRRSV infection (Buddaert et al., 1998) . Overend et al. (2007) showed that recombinant swine IFN-\u03b2 protects swine alveolar macrophages and MARC-145 cells (a PRRSV permissive cell line) from infection with PRRSV. Royaee et al. (2004) showed that utilizing an expression plasmid encoding porcine IFN-\u03b1 as an adjuvant resulted in a temporary increase in the frequency of PRRSV-specific IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells in vaccinated animals, which demonstrated an important role of type I interferon as a link between the innate and adaptive immune responses. However, PRRSV infection appears to elicit a poor innate antiviral type I interferon response, which is postulated to result in a weak adaptive immune response as demonstrated by cell-mediated immune responses of short duration, and slow development of virusspecific IFN-\u03b3 secreting cells leading to a prolonged viremia (Meier et al., 2003; Royaee et al., 2004) . Miller et al. (2004) showed that stimulation of MARC-145 cells by exogenous double-stranded RNA resulted in significant increases in type I IFN mRNA expression, but the double-stranded RNA induction of type I IFN activation was significantly inhibited by dual-exposure with PRRSV. Results from Luo et al (2008) showed that PRRSV infection significantly blocked dsRNAinduced IFN-\u03b2 production. However, little is known about the molecular mechanism of PRRSV proteins in the regulation of interferon activity.",

            "text": "PRRSV contains a single positive-stranded RNA genome, encoding nine open reading frames. The replicase-associated genes, ORF1a and ORF1b, are situated at the 5\u2032 end of the genome and represent nearly 75% of the viral genome. According to the studies of the closely related equine arteritis virus (EAV), the ORF1a-encoded replicase polyprotein pp1a is predicted to be proteolytically cleaved into eight nonstructural products, nsp1 to nsp8 (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998; Allende et al., 1999; Nelsen et al., 1999) . The nsp1 contains two putative cysteine protease domains, PCP1\u03b1 and PCP1\u03b2. PCP1\u03b1 was predicted to autocleave between nsp1\u03b1/nsp1\u03b2, and release nsp1\u03b1 from pp1a, while PCP1\u03b2 was predicted to auto-cleave between nsp1\u03b2/nsp2, and release nsp1\u03b2 from the pp1a (den Boon et al., 1995; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) . In a previous study, den Boon et al. (1995) identified nsp1 auto-cleaved into nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 using an in vitro translation system. Johnson et al. (2007) showed that recombinant nsp1 protein could be auto-catalytically processed into nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2. However, these two cleavage products have not been identified in virus-infected cells. More importantly, our recent study suggested that nsp1 is the main protein antagonizing cellular production of type I interferon. However, the detailed mechanism of how nsp1 is involved in the inhibition of interferon production is unknown. In the present study, we identified the nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 in virus-infected cells and determined the role of nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 in the inhibition of type I interferon synthesis and signaling. The capability of PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 to interfere with the establishment of the innate antiviral state suggests that these two proteins are critical virulence determinants of PRRSV, which provides important insight into the mechanism of PRRSV pathogenesis and future PRRSV vaccine development.",

(1995) showed that PRRSV nsp1 was autocleaved into \u03b1 and \u03b2 subunits of approximately 20 and 27 kDa, respectively. These two auto-cleavage products were also obtained when the nsp1 recombinant protein was purified from expression in E. coli (Johnson et al., 2007) . To determine if these two putative subunits actually exist in virus-infected cells, we generated rabbit polyclonal antiserum (pAb-nsp1, pAb-nsp1\u03b1) and a monoclonal antibody (mAb-nsp1\u03b2) directed against the nsp1, nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 using purified recombinant nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 proteins that were selfcleaved products from nsp1 expression in E. coli (Johnson et al., 2007) . These antibodies were used to probe mock-infected and PRRSV SD23983 infected MARC-145 cells by Western blot. As shown in Fig. 1 , from PRRSV infected cell lysate, pAb-nsp1\u03b1 recognized a protein band slightly larger than the molecular weight marker 16 kDa, which corresponds to the predicted size of nsp1\u03b1 at 20 kDa. The mAb-nsp1\u03b2 detected a sharp protein band above 22 kDa molecular weight marker, which corresponds to the predicted size of nsp1\u03b2 at 27 kDa. Both protein bands were detected using pAb-nsp1. These specific protein bands were not detected in cell lysates from mock-infected cells or in cell lysates from infected cells with pre-immune serum or negative control mAb. This result demonstrated that the two auto-cleavage products, nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2, actually exist in PRRSV-infected cells.",

Based on the homologous sequence comparison between PRRSV and EAV, the Type II PRRSV nsp1\u03b1/1\u03b2 was predicted to be cleaved between 166 Q\u2193R 167 , while nsp1\u03b2/nsp2 was predicted to be cleaved between 383 G\u2193A 384 (den Boon et al., 1995; Allende et al., 1999; Nelsen et al., 1999; Wootton et al., 2000; Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . For subsequent functional study of each individual nsp1 protein, it is critical to elucidate the actual cleavage sites. Therefore, we performed protein N-terminal sequencing analysis on these cleavage sites. Each individual nsp1\u03b2 and nsp2 protein was immunoprecipitated from SD23983 infected cells using specific anti-nsp1\u03b2 and anti-nsp2 monoclonal antibodies. These precipitated proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE and transferred to a PVDF membrane. Proteins corresponding to the predicted size of nsp1\u03b2 and nsp2 were excised from PVDF membrane and subjected to protein identification by N-terminal sequential Edman degradation. For nsp2 N-terminal sequence, the primary (1 0 ) major signals of the sequence were AGRRARKARH, which is consistent with the predicted N-terminal sequence of nsp2 at the cleavage site of 383 G\u2193A 384 (Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . This cleavage site is well conserved between Fig. 1 . Identification of PRRSV nsp1 auto-cleavage products nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 in infected cells by Western blot. MARC-145 cells were infected with SD23983 virus or mock-infected. Viral proteins from cell lysate were separated by 15% SDS-PAGE gel and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane. The membrane was probed with rabbit polyclonal anti-sera against nsp1 (pAb-nsp1) or nsp1\u03b1 (pAb-nsp1\u03b1), or monoclonal antibody against nsp1\u03b2 (mAb-nsp1\u03b2). Arrows point to specific PRRSV nsp1 proteins. different PRRSV isolates (Fig. 2) . Interestingly, the Edman degradation of nsp1\u03b2 generated a major signal of N-terminal sequence as ATVYDIGRDA, which indicated the cleavage site between nsp1\u03b1/ nsp1\u03b2 is at 180 M\u2193A 181 that is 14 amino acids downstream of the predicted cleavage site at 166 Q\u2193R 167 . Sequence analysis showed that this cleavage site is conserved among different PRRSV Type II strains (Fig. 2) . While this manuscript was in preparation, a recent report from Sun et al. (2009) identified crystal structure of nsp1\u03b1 from another Type II PRRSV strain, XH-GD, and the same nsp1\u03b1/nsp1\u03b2 cleavage site was determined in their study, which further confirmed that the actual cleavage site between nsp1\u03b1/nsp1\u03b2 of Type II PRRSV is at 180 M\u2193A 181 . The corresponding cleavage site on Type I PRRSV is at 180 H\u2193S 181 based on our sequence analysis (Fig. 2) . Whether this is the actual cleavage site needs to be further identified in Type I PRRSV.",

To determine whether PRRSV nsp1 follows the same cellular distribution pattern as that of EAV, we detected the subcellular localization of nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 following the time course of viral infection in MARC-145 cells. PRRSV SD23983 infected MARC-145 cells were fixed at 4, 6, 8, 10 and 12 hours post infection (hpi), and stained with pAb-nsp1\u03b1 or mAb-nsp1\u03b2 antibodies (Fig. 3 ). Viral protein specific fluorescence can be detected as early as 6 hpi. All PRRSV infected MARC-145 cells stained with anti-nsp1\u03b1 or anti-nsp1\u03b2 antibody showed small dot-like bright punctate fluorescent foci, mostly concentrated on one side of the perinuclear region in the cell cytoplasm. At 8 hpi, more intense and widespread fluorescence was observed for both proteins. Small punctate dot-like fluorescent staining pattern was observed for nsp1\u03b1, while the nsp1\u03b2 was stained as bright fluorescence mostly around the perinuclear region in cytoplasm. At 10 hpi, we found that in some infected cells, nsp1\u03b1 or nsp1\u03b2 localized into cell nucleus. To determine the percentage of cells showing nuclear localization for nsp1\u03b1 or nsp1\u03b2, we counted infected cells in five fields of view under fluorescent microscopy. For nsp1\u03b1, 49% of infected cells showed nuclear localization, while more infected cells (82%) showed nsp1\u03b2 nuclear localization. At 12 hpi, almost all of the infected cells (98%) showed nuclear localization for nsp1\u03b2, and about 83% of infected cells showed nuclear localization for nsp1\u03b1. Although both proteins were localized into the nucleus, the localization pattern was quite different. For the nsp1\u03b1 proteins that retained in the cytoplasm, a scattered punctate dot-like fluorescent staining pattern was consistently observed. In contrast, nsp1\u03b2 expression showed a predominant nuclear and cytoplasmic staining pattern, and the fluorescent staining in the cytoplasm was diffused through the cytoplasm.",

However, the double-stranded RNA induction of type I IFN activation was significantly inhibited by exposure with PRRSV (Miller et al., 2004; Luo et al., 2008) . Our preliminary result showed that PRRSV nsp1 is the main protein responsible for the inhibition of type 1 IFN activation. Since the two auto-cleaved products of nsp1, nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2, showed different subcellular localization patterns, we speculated that these two proteins may inhibit the interferon response by different mechanisms. In this study, we used an IFN-\u03b2 promoterluciferase reporter system to determine which of the nsp1 autocleaved products had an effect on IFN-\u03b2 activation. Based on our Nterminal protein sequencing analysis, the SD23983 virus nsp1 contains amino acid (AA) 1-383 of pp1a, nsp1\u03b1 contains AA 1-180, and nsp1\u03b2 contains AA 181-383 of pp1a. Each of these proteinencoding regions was cloned into the pCAGGS plasmid to generate plasmids pCAGGS-nsp1, pCAGGS-nsp1\u03b1 or pCAGGS-nsp1\u03b2. Protein expression from these plasmids was confirmed by IFA and Western blot using pAb-nsp1\u03b1 or mAb-nsp1\u03b2 antibodies (Fig. 4) . HEK293T cells were co-transfected with each of these plasmids, a reporter plasmid, p125-Luc that contains IFN-\u03b2 promoter driving the expression of the luciferase reporter gene, and a Renilla luciferase expression plasmid (pRL-SV40) to normalize expression levels of samples. As a Comparative sequence analysis of the nsp1\u03b1/nsp1\u03b2 and nsp1\u03b2/nsp2 cleavage sites. Partial ORF1a amino acid sequence of six PRRSV strains corresponding to SD23983 ORF1a amino acid position 160-204 and 361-409 was aligned with EAV nsp1. The alignment was generated by ALIGNX program of Vector NTI Suite software (InforMax, Inc.). Two boxes depicted in the map of amino acid sequence comparison represent the result of nsp1\u03b2 and nsp2 protein N-terminal sequencing, which was determined by sequential Edman degradation of 10 cycles for each viral protein. The upward and downward solid arrows point to the identified cleavage site of nsp1\u03b2/nsp2 and nsp1\u03b1/nsp1\u03b2, respectively. The downward dashed arrow points to the predicted nsp1\u03b1/nsp1\u03b2 cleavage site. positive control, influenza nsp1 (Sol\u00f3rzano et al., 2005) was used to co-transfect the cells with the reporter plasmid. Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were infected with SeV to induce luciferase production. As shown in Fig. 5A , expression of either nsp1, nsp1\u03b1 or nsp1\u03b2 strongly suppressed the expression of the IFN-\u03b2 promoterdriven luciferase. As we expected, the expression of influenza nsp1 also significantly inhibited the luciferase synthesis. In contrast, a strong reporter signal was observed in cells transfected with empty plasmid, pCAGGS after infection by SeV.",

Maximal activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter requires the binding of transcription factors to the promoter and forming a so-called enhanceosome on the PRDs (reviewed in Randall and Goodbourn, 2008) . Previous study from Luo et al. (2008) demonstrated that PRRSV suppresses IFN-\u03b2 transcription by interfering with IRF3 activity but not NF-kB and AP-1 activities, and its effect is through interrupting the IPS-1 activity in the upstream of the IRF3 signaling pathway. We investigated whether the PRRSV nsp1 associated proteins were the proteins to block the IRF3 signaling pathway. Cells were cotransfected with control plasmids or with plasmids expressing the PRRSV nsp1 proteins, the plasmid pRL-SV40, and a plasmid containing a firefly luciferase gene under the control of a promoter with three IRF3 binding site (p55-CIB-Luc).

Since MDA5 or RIG-1 is associated with IPS-1 caspase, we cotransfected cells with a plasmid expressing MDA5, RIG-1 or IPS-1 protein, a plasmid expressing individual PRRSV proteins, the plasmid pRL-SV40, and the p55-CIB-Luc reporter plasmid. Previous study showed that overexpression of RIG-1 or IPS-1 in cells led to activation of transcription from the reporter plasmid (Childs et al., 2007) . As shown in Figs. 5C-E, this activity was suppressed by co-expression of the nsp1\u03b1 or nsp1\u03b2. This result suggests that PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 may block the IPS-1 mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction. Another possibility is that the downstream portion of the signaling pathway was being blocked by these proteins. TBK1 and IKK\u025b are essential components downstream of RIG-1/IPS-1 caspase. We further tested the effect of PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 on the TBK1 and IKK\u025b mediated IFN-\u03b2 induction. Interestingly, either nsp1\u03b1 or nsp1\u03b2 had the ability to suppress TBK1 and IKK\u025b mediated reporter gene expression (Figs. 5F-G). Both TBK1 and IKK\u025b expression should induce the activation of downstream transcription factor IRF3, and overexpression of IRF3 itself should lead to activation of transcription from the reporter plasmid. Again, nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 blocked this effect (Fig. 5H ). To confirm that the PRRSV nsp1 proteins were specifically affect on the IRF3 signaling pathway, activation of NF-kB was examined using a reporter plasmid containing a firefly luciferase gene under the control of an NF-kB responsive promoter with two NF-kB binding sites (pNF-kB-Luc). HEK293T cells were cotransfected with PRRSV nsp1 proteins expression plasmids, pNF-kB-Luc (or p55-CIB-Luc), pRL-SV40, and a plasmid expressing TRIF, a key component upstream of NF-kB and IRF3 signaling pathways. As we expected, PRRSV nsp1 proteins did not affect the NF-kB dependent reporter gene expression (Fig. 5I ). In contrast, PRRSV nsp1 blocked the IRF3 dependent reporter gene expression (Fig. 5J ).

These data suggest that the PRRSV nsp1 proteins have ability to block induction of IFN-\u03b2 at a point downstream of activation of IRF-3, since nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 expression inhibit the activation of the IFN-\u03b2 promoter but do not block the activation of IRF-3.

However, little is known about the structure and function of PRRSV nonstructural proteins (nsp), which account for 75% of the viral genome. Individual PRRSV nsp proteolytic processing products were mainly predicted based on the homologous genome sequence comparison between PRRSV and EAV (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998; Allende et al., 1999; Nelsen et al., 1999; Ziebuhr et al., 2000) . This study is the first to identify and characterize individual nsp processing products in PRRSV-infected cells. Our results demonstrated the actual existence of two autocleaved products of nsp1, nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 in PRRSV infected cells. This result is consistent with previous findings in the in vitro system (den Boon et al., 1995; Johnson et al., 2007) . More importantly, we identified the actual cleavage site between nsp1\u03b1/nsp1\u03b2 and nsp1\u03b2/ nsp2 of Type II PRRSV. This data is further supported by the recent identification of the crystal structure of nsp1\u03b1 (Sun et al., 2009 ). Identification of the actual cleavage sites between nsp1\u03b1/nsp1\u03b2 and nsp1\u03b2/nsp2 has clarified the confusion previously reported in the PRRSV literature, especially for the nsp1\u03b1/nsp1\u03b2 site. Further analysis of the dynamic movement of nsp1 proteins in PRRSV infected cells revealed the interesting localization patterns of nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2. Our results showed that during the early stage of infection (6 and 8 hpi), the nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 were mainly retained in the cell cytoplasm. At this stage, especially at 6 hpi, we observed that both nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 co-localized with most of the PRRSV ORF1a encoded nsps, including nsp2, nsp4, nsp7 and nsp8, into a perinuclear site as a distinct fluorescent spot (data not shown), which is assumed to be the site of the replication complex (Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) . At the later stages of infection (10 and 12 hpi), these two proteins are mainly localized into the cell nucleus. One simple explanation of this phenomenon is that during the early stage of infection, nsp1 is synthesized as part of a large pp1a polyprotein staying in the cytoplasm, and the subunits are subsequently liberated as individual proteins capable of translocating to the nucleus. Another possibility is that there may be two forms of nsp1\u03b1 (and nsp1\u03b2): The cytoplasmic form participates in the replication complex formation, and the nuclear form interacts with the host protein(s). We have noticed that certain lots of rabbit anti-nsp1\u03b1 serum stained nsp1\u03b1 predominantly in cytoplasm by immunofluorescence assay.",

            "text": "Another important finding from this study is that PRRSV nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 proteins were determined to be involved in blockage of the type I interferon synthesis and signaling pathway. As we indicated above, each of these two proteins encode a papain-like cysteine protease (PCP) (nsp1\u03b1 encodes PCP\u03b1; nsp1\u03b2 encodes PCP\u03b2). Thus, the nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 are multifunctional proteins. They not only play an important role in the proteolytic processing of replicase polyproteins, but are also involved in suppressing of the host innate antiviral response. Previous studies showed that proteases of positive-stranded RNA viruses are commonly multifunctional, and they are actively involved in antagonizing the host cell antiviral response. For example, hepatitis C virus NS3 and NS4A proteins associated to form an active enzyme, which possesses RNA helicase and serine protease activities in the polyprotein processing and HCV replication. The NS3/4A also has an ability to block the type I interferon gene expression by targeting the toll-like receptor 3 adaptor protein TRIF and interfering with the RIG-I-dependent signaling pathway (Karayiannis, 2005; Li et al., 2005) . The N (pro) of pestiviruses is the first protein encoded by the single large open reading frame of the positive-sense RNA genome. It is a cysteine protease, which has an autoproteolytic activity to cleave itself off from the polyprotein. The N (pro) subverts host cell antiviral responses by targeting IRF3 and promoting its proteasomal degradation, a process that is independent of the proteolytic activity of N (pro) (Hilton et al., 2006; Bauhofer et al., 2007; Chen et al., 2007; Seago et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "It remains to be determined where in the IFN induction pathway PRRSV nsp1 proteins (\u03b1 and \u03b2) are having their effect. Overexpression of components of the pathway by which IRF-3 is activated in response to cytoplasmic dsRNA stimulation showed that PRRSV nsp1 proteins act downstream of all of them. We hypothesize that the PRRSV nsp1 proteins may be acting downstream of IRF-3 activation, which may have a direct effect on the formation of the transcription enhanceosome on the IFN-\u03b2 promoter inside the nucleus. This hypothesis is supported by our observation that the nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 were predominantly localized into the cell nucleus during the later time of infection, and by the fact that IRF3 appears to be activated and transported into the nucleus normally after SeV infection of nsp1, nsp1\u03b1 or nsp1\u03b2 transfected cells. An example of this case is the Thogoto virus ML protein. The ML protein prevents the IRF3 dimerization and binding to c-AMP response element binding protein (CBP), which in turn prevents the formation of the transcription enhanceosome on the IFN-\u03b2 promoter (Jennings et al., 2005) . Further studies are required to map the exact point(s) on the IFN induction pathway at which PRRSV nsp1 proteins act. It will be interesting to determine the requirement for nuclear localization of the PRRSV nsp1 proteins, which relates to their interferon antagonist function. PRRSV nsp1 does not contain the traditional nuclear localization signal (NLS), a similar feature as Fig. 6 . PRRSV nsp1 proteins inhibit expression from an ISRE promoter.

            "text": "Besides their inhibition in IFN-\u03b2 synthesis, the PRRSV nsp1, especially nsp1\u03b2, was determined to be able to inhibit interferon signaling pathway. The nsp1\u03b2 demonstrated strong inhibition effect on the expression of reporter gene from an ISRE promoter after IFN-\u03b2 stimulation. Its action on this pathway appears on the blockage of the STAT1 phosphorylation and preventing the STAT1 nuclear localization. Limited inhibition effect of nsp1\u03b1 on this pathway was observed. Under natural infection, both nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 exist in the infected cells. It was consistently shown that cells transfected with nsp1 (nsp1\u03b1 plus nsp1\u03b2) had lower levels of luciferase reporter signal than those cells transfected with nsp1\u03b2 or nsp1\u03b1 alone. Based on our results, it seems that the sum of effect by nsp1\u03b1 and nsp1\u03b2 alone are equivalent to the effect of nsp1. Another interesting observation is that nsp1\u03b2 alone appears to suppress STAT1 phosphorylation, whereas nsp1\u03b1 alone appears to lead to disappearance of STAT1 from the cytoplasm. Fig. 7A shows nsp1\u03b1 concentrated in dots on the edge of nuclei and almost no cytoplasmic STAT1, whereas nsp1\u03b2 does not show intense perinuclear fluorescence and has no apparent effect on the cytoplasmic fluorescence signal of STAT1, only on exclusion of STAT1 from nuclei. The detailed mechanism involved in this pathway needs to be further elucidated in the future. The fact that PRRSV nsp1 is also a functional antagonist in IFN signaling pathway opens a wide range of possibilities towards analyzing the pathways involved. There is no previous evidence for the ability of arteriviruses to interfere with IFN signaling pathways. In contrast, coronaviruses, a family of viruses closely related to arteriviruses, have been well studied on their function of antagonizing interferon signaling. The SARS-CoV nsp1 not only inhibits IFN production, but also inhibits IFN-dependent signaling pathways (Wathelet et al., 2007) . This study demonstrated an initial step toward understanding the effect of PRRSV proteins on the IFN signaling pathway. Future studies are required to elucidate the detailed mechanisms that PRRSV involve in this pathway. It will be interesting to determine the effect of PRRSV nsp1 proteins on other components of IFN signaling.",

            "text": "Like the SARS-CoV nsp1, PRRSV nsp1 proteins are able to target multiple steps of the interferon response. Viral proteins that target multiple steps of interferon activation increase the likelihood that the virus can completely inhibit the interferon response. The observation that nsp1a and nsp1\u03b2 can act independently to antagonize the host cell interferon response does not exclude the possibility that additional PRRSV proteins might exert a similar function or act synergistically to antagonize interferon activity. Preliminary studies from our laboratory and others suggest that PRRSV most likely expresses a number of proteins to suppress host antiviral innate immune response. A recent study from Frias-Staheli et al. (2007) reported that the cysteine protease encoded by PRRSV nsp2 is capable of inhibiting Ub-and ISG15-dependent innate immune responses. Under natural viral infection conditions, the IFN antagonist activity involves entire viral proteins that function simultaneously. The function of a single protein may be enhanced or diminished in the context of the multi-protein system. Therefore, future studies are needed to identify the other PRRSV proteins that function as interferon antagonists, and study the synergist effect of the PRRSV nsp1 proteins with other proteins. It is possible that other PRRSV proteins target different parts of innate immune response from those of nsp1 proteins, such as SARS-CoV N, ORF3b and ORF6, which interact in different steps of the interferon synthesis and signaling pathway (Kopecky-Bromberg et al., 2007) . Viruses encoding multiple proteins that are able to target more than one step of the interferon response are most likely to cause a severe inhibition of interferon. The data from this study demonstrated that PRRSV nsp1 proteins, especially nsp1\u03b2, are virulence factors that can inhibit multiple steps of the host interferon response. Their synergistic effect with other PRRSV proteins, such as nsp2, during the course of infection could be able to shut down the host cell innate immune response completely. This may explain why the induction of interferon and some innate cytokines is inhibited during PRRSV infection.",

The membrane was then incubated with primary antibodies (1:1000 dilution of mAb; 1:200 dilution for pAb) for 1 h at room temperature. For detecting the expression of PRRSV proteins, rabbit polyclonal antibodies against nsp1 or nsp1\u03b1, or mouse monoclonal antibody against nsp1\u03b2 were used. For detection of STAT1 expression, a nitrocellulose membrane was probed with rabbit anti-total STAT1, or rabbit anti-phospho-STAT1 recognizing phosphorylation at tyrosine 701 (Santa Cruz Biotechnology). The mouse anti-\u03b2-tubulin (Lamda Biotech) antibody was used as a control. After incubation with primary antibody, the membrane was washed with PBST. The secondary antibody, goat antimouse or anti-rabbit (Kirkegaard & Perry Laboratories, Gaithersburg, MD), was added and incubated for 60 min. The membrane was developed using the method we described previously (Wu et al., 2001) .",

The PRRSV proteins were immunoprecipitated from the SD23983 virus infected cell lysate using anti-nsp1\u03b2 and anti-nsp2 monoclonal antibodies. The immunoprecipitated PRRSV proteins were separated by electrophoresis on a polyacrylamide gel. After gel electrophoresis, gels were soaked in transfer buffer (10 mM 3-[cyclohexylamino]-1-propanesulfonic acid, 10% methanol, pH 11.0) for 5 min. At the same time, the PVDF membrane was rinsed with 100% methanol and stored in transfer buffer. The gel, sandwiched between a sheet of PVDF membrane and blotting papers, was assembled into a blotting apparatus for 1 h at 0.24 A in transfer buffer. The transferred PVDF membrane was washed in deionized H 2 O and stained with 0.5% Ponceau S in 1% acetic acid. The membrane was finally rinsed in deionized H 2 O and air dried. Corresponding protein bands were cut from the membrane and were subjected to automatic sequential Edman degradation for 10 cycles using the PE/ABD Procise 494 HT Protein Sequencing System.",

The alignment was generated by ALIGNX program of Vector NTI Suite software (InforMax, Inc.). Two boxes depicted in the map of amino acid sequence comparison represent the result of nsp1\u03b2 and nsp2 protein N-terminal sequencing, which was determined by sequential Edman degradation of 10 cycles for each viral protein. The upward and downward solid arrows point to the identified cleavage site of nsp1\u03b2/nsp2 and nsp1\u03b1/nsp1\u03b2, respectively. The downward dashed arrow points to the predicted nsp1\u03b1/nsp1\u03b2 cleavage site.",
