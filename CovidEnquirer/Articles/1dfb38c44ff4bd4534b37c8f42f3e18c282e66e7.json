The gene expression data set GSE10474 was downloaded and assessed to identify differentially expressed genes (DEGs). Principal component analysis, functional enrichment analysis and differential co-expression analysis of DEGs were performed. Furthermore, potential target drugs for key DEGs were assessed. A total of 209 DEGs, including 107 upregulated and 102 downregulated genes were screened. A number of DEGs, including zinc finger and BTB domain containing 17 (ZBTB17), heat shock protein 90 kDa \u03b2, member 1 (HSP90B1) and major histocompatibility complex, class II, DR \u03b1 were identified. Furthermore, gene ontology terms including antigen processing and presentation, glycerophospholipid metabolism, transcriptional misregulation in cancer, thyroid hormone synthesis and pathways associated with diseases, such as asthma were identified. In addition, a differential co-expression network containing ubiquitin-conjugating enzyme E2 D4, putative and tubulin, \u03b3 complex associated protein 3 was constructed. Furthermore, a number of gene-drug interactions, including between HSP90B1 and adenosine-5'-diphosphate and radicicol, were identified. Therefore, DEGs, including ZBTB17 and HSP90B1, may be important in the pathogenesis of sepsis-induced ALI. Furthermore, drugs including adenosine-5'-diphosphate may be novel drug candidates to treat patients with ALI.",

ALI may also be caused by collagen vascular diseases, drugs, ingestants, inhalants, shock, acute eosinophilic pneumonia, immunologically mediated pulmonary hemorrhage and vasculitis and radiation pneumonitis (4) . However, it remains unclear whether all patients with sepsis develop ALI and studies are being conducted to determine whether this is the case. Exaggerated responses to inflammatory stimuli and endothelial dysfunction occur in patients with ALI and in those with sepsis. In addition, platelets serve an important role in sepsis-induced lung injury by increasing the expression of Mac-1 (5) . However, the mechanisms underlying the development of sepsis-induced ALI remain largely unknown. Several treatment options for ALI have been developed, including low tidal volume ventilation, fluid-conservative therapy and anti-inflammatory drugs (6) , however at present there is no single recommended therapy available. Thus, it is also important to identify the underlying cause of sepsis-induced ALI and the most effective method of treating it.",

The protein encoded by UBE2D4 introduces covalent attachment of the E1 complex to other proteins and promotes polyubiquitination (28) . The results of the current study indicated that protein misfolding and the unfolded protein response were enriched by DEGs, including HSPA5, HSP90B1 and HYOU1. The results of previous studies suggested that the endoplasmic reticulum-located HSPA5 is involved in protein folding and protein assembly (29) and may be critical for the intercellular transport of proteins (30) . It has also been demonstrated that the protein Grp94, which is encoded by HSP90B1, induces similar effects (31) . HYOU1 functions as a molecular chaperone and participates in protein folding and secretion (32) . In a previous study, certain DEGs associated with membrane protein transport, such as GOSR2 (33) were also obtained. All these DEGs may participant in sepsis-induced ALI through protein folding, assembly and secretion. Several potential drug targets, including HSP90B1, HLA-DQB1, CD86 and HSPA5 were identified in the current study. Adenosine-5'-diphosphate, which participates in the aggregation of human blood-platelets and myocardial infarction (34) , was found to target HSP90B1. HLA-DQB1 was targeted by amoxicillin, clavulanate and insulin. Amoxicillin and clavulanate are widely used as anti-inflammatory drugs and it is thought that insulin may also exhibit anti-inflammatory activity (35) . Previous study showed that ALI was associated with inflammation (36) . Antihemophilic factor was found to target HSPA5, whereas abatacept, which inhibits T lymphocyte activation (37) , was found to target CD86.",
