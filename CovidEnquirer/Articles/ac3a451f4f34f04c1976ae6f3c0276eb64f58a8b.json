SARS-CoV 3Clike protease (3CL pro ) mediates the proteolytic processing of replicase polypeptides 1a and 1ab into functional proteins, playing an important role in viral replication. In this study, we demonstrated the expression of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro in Escherichia coli and Vero cells, and then characterized the in vitro trans-cleavage and the cell-based cis-cleavage by the 3CL pro . Mutational analysis of the 3CL pro demonstrated the importance of His41, Cys145, and Glu166 in the substratebinding subsite S1 for keeping the proteolytic activity. In addition, alanine substitution of the cleavage substrates indicated that Gln-P1 in the substrates mainly determined the cleavage efficiency. Therefore, this study not only established the quantifiable and reliable assay for the in vitro and cell-based measurement of the 3CL pro activity, but also characterized the molecular interaction of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro with the substrates. The results will be useful for the rational development of the anti-SARS drugs.",

SARS-CoV particles contain a single positive-stranded RNA genome that is approximately 30 kb in length and has a 5 0 cap structure and 3 0 poly(A) tract [8] [9] [10] . The SARS-CoV genome encodes for replicase, spike, envelope, membrane, and nucleocapsid. The replicase gene encodes two large overlapping polypeptides (replicase 1a and 1ab, $450 and $750 kDa, respectively), including 3C-like protease (3CL pro ), RNA-dependent RNA polymerase, and RNA helicase for viral replication and transcription [11] . The SARS-CoV 3CL pro mediates the proteolytic processing of replicase polypeptides 1a and 1ab into functional proteins, playing an important role in viral replication. Eleven cleavage sites of the 3CL pro on the viral polyprotein have been mapped using the computer prediction based on the substrate conservation among CoV main proteases [12] , being confirmed by the in vitro trans-cleavage of 11 substrate peptides [13] . Therefore, the SARS-CoV 3CL pro becomes an attractive target for developing effective drugs against SARS.",

Furthermore, alanine substitution at the Cys145-His41 catalytic dyad resulted in a significant loss of the 3CL pro enzyme activity (Fig. 3) , revealing the importance of the Cys145-His41 catalytic dyad. According to the crystallographic data [17] , the Glu166 in the substratebinding subsite, SI, of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro has a salt bridge with His172 and hydrogen bonds with the NH group of the other monomer Ser1, being important for the substrate binding and the 3CL pro dimerization. Mutational analysis of Glu166 conformed the importance of Glu166 in the enzymatic function of the SARS-CoV 3CL pro (Fig. 3) . These results showed the important role of the substrate-binding subsite S1 in the anti-SARS drug design.",

Based on the conserved LQA(S,N) motif, Leu-P2 and Gln-P1 were selected for mutational analysis of the substrate specificity by the 3CL pro . Alanine substitution at Leu-P2 and Gln-P1 revealed that Gln-P1 dominantly determined the cleavage efficiency of the substrates by the SARS-CoV 3CL pro (Fig. 4G ). We will further characterize the substrate specificity by the systematically mutational analysis for the molecular-based design on the anti-SARS drugs.",

Furthermore, the Luc activity referred to the cell-based cis-cleavage activity will be useful for the examination of the inhibitory effects on the SARS-CoV 3CL pro in the Vero cells. Therefore, this study not only characterizes Fig. 3 . ELISA for the trans-cleavage of the S-I/nsp7 fusion protein by the 3CL pro and the mutants H41A, C145A, and E166E. After a 3-h incubation, the mixture of the fusion protein Nus-Tag/S-Tag/S-I/nsp7/ HSV-Tag and the 3CL pro was added into the anti-HSV mAb-coated wells. The inhibitor ABF was also added into the trans-cleavage assay. The non-cleavage S-I/nsp7 fusion protein captured onto 96-well plates with anti-HSV mAb was detected using the S protein-HRP conjugate and ABTS/H 2 O 2 substrates. The ELISA product was measured at A405 nm. The relative trans-cleavage activity was calculated as 1 ) \u00f0A405 3CL pro \u00de=\u00f0A405 no 3CL pro \u00de.",
