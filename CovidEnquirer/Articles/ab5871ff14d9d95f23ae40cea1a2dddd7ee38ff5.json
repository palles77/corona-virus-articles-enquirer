            "text": "Background: Acute viral respiratory infections (VRI) are the most common diseases in humans and are associated with high morbidity and mortality in infants and the elderly. Children with congenital heart disease (CHD) are more susceptible to get severe forms of VRI due to their altered lung mechanics, leading to several complications, such as increased hospital stay, longer mechanical ventilation, and higher mortality. This study aimed to identify the frequency of VRI in children with CHD undergoing cardiac surgery, and to compare the major outcomes according to the presence or absence of a VRI. Methods: This was a longitudinal, observational cohort study. Nasopharyngeal secretion samples were collected pre-and postoperatively for patients undergoing cardiac surgery, from May 2013 to May 2014. Respiratory viruses were detected using CLART Pneumovir\u00ae. Results: Forty-eight patients were enrolled. We found a VRI preoperatively in 16 children with CHD before surgery (33.3%), and the frequency of new infections was 8.3% (4 patients). However, in this study, in univariate analyses, the two groups did not differ in any of the studied outcomes. In the multivariate regression models, adjusting for age and STAT category, the presence of a VRI did not show a significant effect on the major outcomes. Conclusions: In conclusion, VRI was frequent in children undergoing open-heart surgery, but the presence of a VRI did not impact on major outcomes in this cohort.",

Bold means a significant effect at p < 0.05. mechanical ventilation, more extubation failures, frequent use of bronchodilators, and longer hospital stay [11] . In another study, children submitted to open-heart surgery that had VRI experienced longer hospital and PICU length-of-stay, compared with matched controls [12] . Altman et al. studied the impact of RSV infection in children with CHD, and they found that these patients had more significant morbidity and higher mortality, with higher healthcare-associated costs [6] . We speculate that our results were negative because of: (a) limited power, given the small sample size, and (b) detection of viruses in asymptomatic children, since the ones with symptoms of VRI were rescheduled. In the study by Delgado-Corcoran et al. [11] , children were considered infected when they had symptoms of VRI, while in the study by Spaeder et al. [12] , infection was defined as the presence of viruses in nasopharyngeal or endotracheal specimens. Although there is evidence that a symptomatic VRI will negatively impact outcomes [12] , it is not clear whether asymptomatic presence of a virus in the respiratory system will affect the outcomes. Therefore, the usefulness and the cost-effectiveness of screening all children scheduled for congenital heart surgery regarding the presence of respiratory viruses need clarification. In Brazil, RSV is the most common cause of VRI requiring hospitalization in children [13] . In a systematic review of 20 published studies, Homaira et al. showed that patients who most benefit from passive immunization against RSV were preterm infants (< 33 weeks), children with chronic lung disease and children with congenital heart disease [14] . However, the most frequent virus in our patients was rhinovirus, and RSV was detected in a single patient. This finding cannot be attributed to the use of passive immunization against RSV, since only a few of our patients were given it.",

Simsic et al. adopted preoperative testing for respiratory virus by PCR before cardiac surgery for all patients with single-ventricle and, if the test is positive, surgery is rescheduled for 6 weeks, pending a negative follow-up viral PCR [15] . There are some rapid tests for VRI in the market, like the Abbott TESTPACK RSV (Abbott Diagnostics, Santa Clara, CA), the QuickVue RSV Test (Quidel Corp., San Diego, CA) or the RAMP\u00ae RSV TEST (Response Biomedical Corp., Vancouver, Canada), which are rapid enzyme immunoassay for the direct detection of RSV antigen in nasopharyngeal swab specimens [16] . The clinical value of these rapid tests in children with CHD is unknown. In children admitted to an emergency department, bedside testing for RSV, if immediately available, could have changed medical management in 64% of cases, reduced the number of tests ordered, antibiotics prescribed, and saved an average of USD 669 per patient [17] . Another issue that may be considered is the lack of preventive strategies for most of the viruses that cause VRI in these patients, besides RSV. New vaccines for these viruses could bring benefit to many patients in similar situations.",

Patients scheduled for congenital heart surgery undergo only clinical evaluation, and surgery is postponed for a few weeks if the patient has symptoms of a VRI. Our findings are important because they bring awareness to the high frequency of asymptomatic VRI in patients with CHD scheduled for open heart surgery, although, here, not associated with poorer outcomes. Although the screening test is non-invasive and technically simple, on the other hand, it is expensive. Besides, identification of a respiratory virus does not necessarily mean an active infection, since respiratory viruses can be detected weeks after a VRI. Nevertheless, despite the limitations of this study, our results suggest that screening asymptomatic children for VRI before open-heart surgery is not costeffective, since there was no difference in outcomes.",
