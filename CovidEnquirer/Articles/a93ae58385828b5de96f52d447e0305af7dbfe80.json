Several molecules have been developed in the past few decades to achieve this objective and continous refinements are being continuously made in the quest of the ideal blood substitute. Currently, available technology manufactures artificial blood from haemoglobin obtained from outdated human/bovine blood (Haemoglobin Based Oxygen Carriers) or utilizing Perfluorocarbons. These synthetic blood substitutes are advantageous in that they do not require compatibility testing, are free from blood borne infections, have prolonged shelf life and do not require refrigeration. Artificial blood is projected to have a significant impact on the development of medical care in the future. It can complement the current blood products for transfusion and create a stable supply of safe and effective products. It is likely to reduce the requirements of blood transfusions drastically especially in settings of trauma and surgery thereby reducing the reliance on banked donated blood.",

The number of units collected from blood donors is insufficient to cope up with the increasing requirements of human blood which modern day medicine and surgery demands. Additionally, donated human blood is fraught with concerns related to short storage life, possibility of transmission of blood borne infections, allergic reactions and increasing costs of collecting, processing and crossmatching. To mitigate this ever expanding disparity between the demand and supply of blood and the difficulties associated with stored human blood, artificial blood has emerged as a promising option. Artificial blood serves to provide a substitute of conventional blood transfusion where blood or blood products derived from one person is infused into another. The term artificial blood is often used interchangeably with blood surrogate or blood substitutes and all of them are actually misnomers as artificial blood lacks numerous essential attributes of human blood like haemostatic processes, typing and immunologic defense of the body, nonetheless it serves to carry out the important function of transporting *Address correspondence to this author at the Department of Anaesthesia, Sanjay Gandhi Post Graduate Institute of Medical Sciences, Lucknow, India; Tel: 9256543256; E-mail: rudrashish@yahoo.com oxygen and carbon dioxide throughout the body.

Various other substances like urine, plant resins, sheep blood, milk (for treatment of Asiatic cholera) and salt solutions were also tried previously. Following the path breaking research of Landsteiner on the various blood groups, blood transfusion became a safer and established medical procedure. As the understanding of oxygen transport and delivery of RBC's gradually improved and the necessity of type specific allogenic transfusion was recognized, the foundations of development of artificial blood started being laid in the early 1900's. Amberson et al. in 1949 reported the first infusion of cell free haemoglobin in a patient with postpartum haemmorhage for resuscitation [3] . Animal experiments where free haemoglobin was collected by lysing the red blood cells and transfusing the unmodified products in animals resulted in renal failure, coagulopathy, complement activation, antigenicity, histamine release, iron deposition and vasoconstriction. The toxicity was later attributed to the presence of red cell stroma in the product [4, 5] . Also the strong affinity of free haemoglobin for nitric oxide (a potent vasodilator) caused unopposed vasoconstriction and pressor response due to its nitric oxide scavenging effect [6] .",

Allogenic blood transfusions also resulted in certain non infectious complications like haemolytic transfusion reaction, transfusion related acute lung injury, graft versus host rejection, anaphylaxis and post transfusion purpura. The amount of donated stored blood was gradually being unable to cope up with the ever increasing demand and thus a deficiency is projected in the years to come. The incurred expenditure of collecting, storing and processing blood and products is also gradually rising [10] .

            "text": "HBOC's are derived from haemoglobin which is isolated or synthetically manufactured (Fig. 1) . Oxygen binds covalently to these compounds as they do to naturally occurring haemoglobin. They were designed to fulfill the following purposes : (1) inherent decreased oxygen affinity to increase tissue unloading (2) prolonged intravascular retention (3) decreased colloidal osmotic activity (4) absence of renal toxicity. The source of haemoglobin is either human, obtained from outdated stored blood or bovine blood or genetically engineered [10, [12] [13] [14] . Blood group substances, proteins and viruses (if any) are removed by heating and filtration through the process of haemoglobin purification from erythrocytes. The isolated haemoglobin is subjected to molecular modification and reconstitution in an artificial blood formula. Haemoglobin in its natural form consists of 2 \u03b1 and 2\u03b2 chains which are bound to an iron haem group which binds oxygen. Manufacturing processes of HBOC involves extraction of haemoglobin and thereafter stabilisation with crosslinking as tetramers or polymerization (using glutaraldehyde or o-raffinose), or conjugation with polyethylene glycol or encapsulation in phospholipid vesicles before mixing into an electrolyte solution [13] . Stabilisation of HBOC using cross linking or polymerization with larger molecules like polyethylene glycol, dextran or polyoxyethylene also aids in a substantial increase in the intravascular \"dwell\" time (24-48 hours). Newer molecules are being developed which have antioxidants like superoxide dismutase or catalase cross linked to the haemoglobin structure. The incorporation of antioxidants help in reducing the severity of ischaemic reperfusion injury in conditions like stroke, myocardial infarction or organ transplantation [15] . Based on the techniques of improving stability, the following groups of haemoglobin solutions are available: i) Surface Modified Haemoglobin (PEG Hb, PHP, Haemospan): They are produced by attachment of large molecules like polyethylene glycol to surface lysine groups. This modification increases the viscosity and oncotic pressure of the solution. These solutions have the propensity to cause moderate vasoconstriction. The small size of the haemoglobin molecules allows them to pass through small vessels and oxygenate areas which cannot be reached by RBC's. Thus, they are useful in the treatment of patients with stroke, for increasing susceptibility of tumour cells to radiation or chemotherapy and also the vaso-pressor effects can be utilized to treat hypotension following septic shock. They also have a lower incidence of antibody production ii) Intramolecular Cross Linked Haemoglobin (Hemassist, r-Hb1-1,r-Hb 2-0):The tetrameric stabilization and prevention of renal filteration is accomplished by intermolecular cross linking between the two \u03b1 and the two \u03b2 subunits using a site specific crosslinker which cross links the two \u03b1 or the two \u03b2 chains. Cross linking also reduces the affinity of haemoglobin for oxygen. Commonly used cross linkers include 3,5-dibromosalicyl fumarate (DBBF) and nor-2-formylpyridoxal 5-phosphate (NFPLP).",

The liposomes are made of phospholipid bilayer with cholesterol molecules added for increasing the rigidity and mechanical stability and enclose a stroma free haemoglobin solution and 2,3 diphosphoglycerate or inositol hexaphosphate as a gelatinous fluid. For added stabilization, ultraviolet radiations or redox inhibitors are used which causes polymerization of unsaturated phospholipids. Stabilisation can also be achieved by coating the liposomes with polymers. Encapsulated haemoglobin (often called haemosomes) allows manipulation of their physiochemical properties and circulation lifetime [18, 19] . The P 50 of the modified haemoglobin can be suitably altered through modifications of the liposomes which allows for easier oxygen unloading. Oxygen affinity can be adjusted by co encapsulating an allosteric effector like pyridoxal 5'phosphate [20] . They often have negatively charged lipid in their capsules which limits their aggregation. Encapsulation also prevents denaturation of haemoglobin and enhances biodistribution. Further modification with polyethylene glycol increases their half life, makes them water soluble, lowers antigenicity and increases site specific targeting [21, 22] . Since these vesicles are made up of purified haemoglobin or lipids, they are compatible with the immune system. Nanocapsules of haemoglobin made of biodegradable polymer like polylactide have been developed [23] . Polylactide gets converted to water and carbon dioxide in the body and hence does not accumulates in the reticuloendothelial system. Fig. (1) . Synthetically manufactured HBOC.",

RBC's do not exert any colloidal osmotic pressure whereas haemoglobin (like other plasma proteins) exerts the same. As a result a cellular haemoglobin can alter the intravascular volume and act as a plasma expander. HBOC's circulation half life is shorter than normal RBC's. Majority of HBOC remain in circulation for around 20-30 hours whereas whole blood transfusion lasts 34 days. They release free radicals inside the body from free haemoglobin and the breakdown products like haem and iron. Methaemoglobin concentrations also increase due to the oxidative properties of HBOC's [7, 8, 24, 25] . The first choice for obtaining haemoglobin is outdated human blood which has a limited supply. Thus bovine blood has to be utilized for procurement of haemoglobin. Bovine haemoglobin has the potential of harbouring the prion pathogen responsible for causing bovine spongiform encephalopathy (Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease). To overcome this problem and also to ensure a steady supply of haemoglobin in future, genetically engineering bacteria to produce a recombinant source of human haemoglobin was attempted.",

Their size is about 100 times smaller than RBC's. They are capable of carrying oxygen and carbon dioxide without binding to these gases [26] and had been previously used to provide oxygen to premature infants with respiratory distress syndrome. Due to their insolubility in water, they need to be emulsified by addition of lipids through high pressure homogenization which suspends tiny particles of PFC in the blood. Saturation of PFC occurs passively as molecules of oxygen dissolve into molecular cavities within liquid droplets. Oxygenation of PFC is related to partial pressure of oxygen which is in contact with PFC. Therefore, best results are obtained if the patient is breathing 100% oxygen at the time of infusion (PaO 2 \u02c3 350 mm Hg). The reticuloendothelial system is responsible for the systemic removal of PFC's and they are exhaled via the lungs resulting in a short dose dependant circulatory half life. After infusion, the molecules vaporize and then are exhaled over days. The PFC's which were used initially had the disadvantages of accumulating in the reticuloendothelial system. They score over haemoglobin based molecules on the following counts (1) no reactivity with oxygen or other gases (2) increases oxygen solubility in the plasma (3) No effect of temperature, pH and 2, 3 diphosphoglycerate on dissolution of oxygen (4) allows easy and faster transfer of oxygen from cells to the tissues (5) Variable carrying capacity dependent upon the FiO 2 .

Additionally, they are being utilized as contrast agents [40] or infection tracers [41] . Future research initiatives in this context should, therefore, be directed towards providing adequate quantities of safe, efficacious, commercially viable alternatives with lesser drawbacks which will reduce dependency on donated blood and reduce mortality due to transfusion requirements. A new avenue in the field of transfusion medicine is thus open to immense possibilities. ",
