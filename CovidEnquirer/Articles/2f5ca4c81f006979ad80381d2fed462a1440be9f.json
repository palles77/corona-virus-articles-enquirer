Suspected modes of transmission between nonhuman primates include aerosol, direct contact, and biting insects (Wachtman and LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE Mansfield, 2012) . Transmission of monkeypox from captive nonhuman primate populations to humans has not been recorded. The first reported case of human monkeypox outside of Africa occurred in the Midwestern United States in June 2003 following the importation of 800 West African small rodents for the pet trade, six of which (two rope squirrels (Funisciurus spp.), one Gambian giant rat (Cricetomys spp.), and three dormice (Graphiurus)) were later shown to be infected with the West African clade of monkeypox virus (CDC, 2003; Guarner et al., 2004) . The infected rodents were co-housed with black-tailed prairie dogs (Cynomys ludovicianus) who contracted the disease and then served as the source of a human monkeypox disease outbreak with 87 reported (37 laboratoryconfirmed) human cases (CDC, 2003; Parker et al., 2007) . Infection was also identified in hamsters (Cricetus spp.), gerbils (Gerbillus spp.), and chinchillas (Chinchilla spp.) cohoused with the infected animals (Parker et al., 2007) . As a result of this outbreak, U.S. importation of African rodents and interstate transportation of prairie dogs and select African rodents was banned. Human-to-human and zoonotic transmission of this agent is low and has occurred presumably through close contact with active lesions, recently contaminated fomites, or respiratory secretions (CDC, 1997; Damon, 2011; Ligon, 2004) .",

Nonhuman primates are susceptible to experimental smallpox virus infection and have been shown to contract the virus from infected humans.

The virus is not naturally transmitted directly between humans or between nonhuman primates. Although multiple genuses of mosquitos can be infected and transmit the disease, the Aedes spp. (Stegomyia spp.) mosquito is of primary importance due to its feeding habits and the ability of the virus to persist in the insect over the dry season by transovarian transmission (Wachtman and Mansfield, 2012) . LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE Two forms of the disease are recognized based on the cyclic transmission between vertebrate hosts and mosquito vectors. In the jungle (sylvatic) form, disease transmission occurs most commonly between treehole breeding mosquitoes (e.g., A. africanus in Africa, Haemagogus spp. in Central and South America) and nonhuman primates residing in the forest canopy. Virus transmission to humans occurs where the human and mosquito ranges overlap such as during forestry activities that disrupt mosquito feeding preferences. Once introduced into a human population, the urban (rural) form of disease transmission may develop in which the virus is transmitted between individuals by peridomestic mosquitoes (predominantly Aedes aegypti) which breed well in urban settings and feed on humans (Blanchard and Russell-Lodrigue, 2012; Monath and Staples, 2011) .",

However, in the natural outbreak of Ebola-Reston infection in a laboratory colony of nonhuman primates, transmission occurred among animals without apparent direct intimate contact, suggesting the possibility of airborne or aerosol transmission. Three of six animal technicians working with these animals developed antibody response to Ebola-Reston virus, but the details of transmission were not determined in all cases. One of these individuals was infected during postmortem examination of an infected monkey . Epidemiologic findings in animal caretakers working in the Philippine-source colony for Ebola-Reston-infected nonhuman primates suggest that the transmission of Ebola-Reston to humans is rare (Miranda et al., 1999) .",

Transmission of the infection can also occur through an animal bite or from disturbing dried materials contaminated with rodent excreta, allowing wound contamination, conjunctival exposure, or ingestion to occur (CDCP-NIH, 2009 ). Infection of animal caretakers and research personnel has resulted from the introduction of infected wild rodents into the laboratory animal facility environment as well as biologics derived or contaminated by them. Person-to-person transmission is rare, but has been documented with select hantaviruses (Schmaljohn and Hjelle, 1997) .",

Rodent infestations are common in zoos and mice, as known carriers of LCMV are the probable source of infection in these outbreaks. Some outbreaks have been traced to the feeding of neonatal mice ('pinkies') from enzootically infected mouse populations to callitrichids (Montali et al., 1993) . Interestingly, two veterinarians involved in the care of infected callitrichids seroconverted to the agent but did not develop clinical signs of disease (Blanchard and Russell-Lodrigue, 2012) . The pathologic lesions observed in LCMV-infected callitrichids share many similarities with those of humans infected with another Arenavirus in sub-Saharan Africa, Lassa hemorrhagic fever virus.

Under some circumstances, LCMV produces a pantropic infection and may be copiously present in the blood, cerebrospinal fluid, urine, nasopharyngeal secretions, feces, and tissues of natural hosts and possibly humans. In endemically infected mouse and hamster colonies, the infection is transmitted in utero or early in the neonatal period, producing a tolerant infection characterized by chronic viremia and viruria without significant clinical disease. Thus, bedding material and other fomites contaminated by LCMV-infected animals can be important sources of infection for humans, as demonstrated in numerous outbreaks among laboratory animal technicians (Dykewicz et al., 1992; Newcomer and Fox, 2007; CDC, 2012b) . Exposure of adult, immunocompetent mice most frequently results in a transient infection with seroconversion although persistent infection with wasting may develop following immune exhaustion (Maclachlan et al., 2011b) .

Open wire cages were correlated with the highest rate LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE of infection, whereas deep boxes and aquariums were associated with a lower human infection rate. Similarly, cage placement in an area of high human activity was associated with infection, but cages located away from areas of frequent human activity (e.g., the basement) did not result in infection of occupants (Biggar et al., 1975) . Also, infections are known to occur in individuals who have not had direct physical contact with infected hamsters but who had simply entered the room housing the animals (Hinman et al., 1975) .

These assays are not useful to diagnose persistently infected, immune tolerant mice, as circulating antibodies may not be present at detectable levels. RT-PCR should be used in these circumstances and to screen biologic materials (e.g., cell lines, tumors, serum). The virus does grow easily in many cell types but produces minimal cytopathic effects. Therefore, cell cultures must be assayed for antigen detection (Charrel and de Lamballerie, 2010; Maclachlan et al., 2011b) . Depopulation of infected colonies is highly recommended. Prevention of this disease in animal facilities is achieved through the periodic serological surveillance of both new animals with inadequate disease profiles and resident animal colonies at risk. Screening all biologics intended for animal passage for the presence of LCMV is another crucial element in the program to prevent the introduction of LCMV into established animal colonies. The exclusion of wild rodent vermin and the elimination of ectoparasites and insect vectors from animal facilities are part of the overall scheme for LCMV disease prevention and are expected of modern laboratory animal facilities.",

Other confirmed routes of B virus transmission to humans include needle stick injury (Benson et al., 1989) and exposure to infected nonhuman primate tissues (Wells et al., 1989) . The possibility of fomite transmission through an injury obtained in handling contaminated caging warrants consideration in an institution's hazard assessment and risk analysis. One case of human-tohuman transmission has been documented (CDC, 1987) . In this case, the spouse of an infected animal handler contracted B virus infection after applying ointment to herpetic skin lesions on her husband and then to an area of dermatitis on her own hand (Cohen et al., 2002) .",

Of particular concern is the risk of aerosol transmission of the rabies virus, although the true risk of this means of transmission has been questioned (Gibbons, 2002) . Most human cases are associated with bat variant rabies virus infection contracted either during an unrecognized exposure incident or following an exposure incident for which the individual did not seek prompt medical care (Dyer et al., 2013) .

The disease course proceeds through several phases: incubation, prodrome state, acute neurologic period, coma, and death (CDC, 2010a). The incubation period in humans is ordinarily 1-3 months but may vary from 9 days to over 8 months. During the 2-to 4-day prodromal stage, patients experience a period of apprehension and develop headache, malaise, and fever. An abnormal, indefinite sensation at the exposure site is the first specific symptom. Patients may also develop intermittent periods of excitation, nervousness, or anxiety interspersed with quiet periods when the mental state appears normal. Further progression of the disease is marked by paresis or paralysis, inability to swallow, hydrophobia, delirium, convulsions, and coma. Few individuals recover from rabies infection; once clinical signs develop, the disease is almost invariably fatal from an acute viral encephalomyelitis followed by respiratory paralysis (Banyard and Fooks, 2011; Hemachudha et al., 2013) .",

Passive protection should be given before experimental animal HAV infection studies begin because infected animals start shedding HAV at 7-11 days postinoculation and continue shedding for several weeks. Two different dosages of ISG are recommended, each providing differing durations of passive protection (1-2 months versus 3-5 months) (ACIP, 2006) .

HEV is classified in the genus Hepevirus and is currently subdivided into at least four major genotypes, although additional genotypes are proposed (Maclachlan et al., 2011c) . Genotypes 1 and 2 infect only humans; genotypes 3 and 4 can infect both humans and a range of other species involved in zoonotic transmission of the virus. HEV infects people worldwide, causing a sometimes fatal viral hepatitis (Lhomme et al., 2013) . Its detection in animal populations has steadily risen in the recent past, thereby prompting increased concern of its zoonotic potential.",

In industrialized countries, serologic evidence of HEV exposure is high and widespread, although clinical HEV infection is only sporadically diagnosed. Hepatitis E may be disproportionally fatal in pregnant women, with over a 25% case fatality rate as compared to 1% in the general population (Meng, 2005) . However, it is unclear what role other underlying health factors may have played in this increased fatality rate (Meng, 2010a) . In industrialized countries, identified cases usually occur sporadically, presumably due to zoonotic transmission from one or more animal reservoirs or following consumption of contaminated meat or shellfish (Lhomme et al., 2013; Meng, 2010a) . In contrast, outbreaks most commonly occur in developing countries secondary to fecal contamination of food or water (Maclachlan et al., 2011c; Meng, 2005) . Direct human-to-human transmission is rare (Pavio et al., 2010) .",

Other animals including farmed rabbits, wild rats, wild boar, bats, mongeese, and deer are susceptible to HEV infection and are being evaluated as potential sources of human disease (Cossaboom et al., 2011; Lhomme et al., 2013; Meng, 2011) .

Aerosol transmission is not suspected. Given the suspected routes of virus transmission to humans, the risk within an animal facility should be minimal. Nevertheless, personnel are advised to observe proper PPE practices to prevent possible HEV exposure. Clinical Signs Disease is frequently self-limiting and asymptomatic, although an acute hepatitis can develop with classical signs of liver involvement including jaundice, anorexia, and hepatomegaly. A fulminant, fatal hepatitis of pregnant women has been attributed to HEV infection, although this disease course has not been observed in naturally or experimentally infected pigs or experimentally infected rhesus macaques (Lhomme et al., 2013; Meng, 2010b) . Chronic disease may develop in the immunocompromised including transplant recipients (Zhou et al., 2013) .

Natural HBV infection was first noted by demonstration of HBV surface antigen in cynomologus in 1985 (Kornegay et al., 1985) . Recently, wild-living cynomolgus macaques from Mauritius Island were diagnosed with natural, chronic infection of a genotype of HBV distinct from the human genotype. The disease appears relatively benign in the infected animals. The zoonotic risk of the cynomolgus genotype is yet unknown (Dupinay et al., 2013) . It is postulated that infected cynomolgus monkeys may serve as a useful animal model of the disease. Other natural hepadnavirus infections of animals (woodchuck, ground squirrel, and duck) are used as animal models of HBV infection, but none are transmissible to humans (Blanchard and Russell-Lodrigue, 2012) . The chimpanzee has been used as an experimental model for the study of hepatitis C and D viruses. Thus, the concern for hepatitis B, C, and D as zoonoses is minimal in the laboratory animal facility environment except where these agents are used in experimental animal studies.

The zoonotic potential for animal retroviruses has been clearly identified. Retroviruses are RNA viruses with a high mutation rate, facilitating the virus' adaptation to novel hosts. It is currently postulated that all human retroviral pathogens have evolved from simian retroviral precursors (Huang et al., 2012) . HIV-1 and HIV-2 evolved from simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) strains originating in the chimpanzee (Pan troglodytes troglodytes) and sooty mangabey (Cercocebus atys), respectively (Chen et al., 1996; Gao et al., 1999) . In addition, human T-cell lymphotropic virus type 1 (HTLV-1) appears to have evolved in humans following interspecies transmission of an earlier form of the virus (simian Tcell leukemia virus) from nonhuman primates (Gessain et al., 2013) . These findings have heightened the concerns of zoonotic retroviral transmission, particularly in connection with the use of nonhuman primates as potential xenograft donors to humans requiring organ transplantation. Similar concerns have been raised about the pig as a donor for xenotransplants to humans because the porcine endogenous retrovirus has been demonstrated to grow in human cells in vitro (Wilson et al., 1998) . However, although there are numerous retrovirus infections of wild, laboratory, and domestic animal species, the transmission of these agents from their natural host to humans under laboratory conditions has been infrequent but consistently involves nonhuman primates as source species. Four simian retroviruses have crossed species to infect humans: SIV, simian retrovirus, simian T-cell leukemia virus, and simian foamy virus (SFV). Each is detailed below although it must be noted that there is concern that additional simian retroviruses may adapt and become zoonotic agents.",

Infection rates in many wild and captive nonhuman primate colonies approach 100% with transmission suspected to occur through exposure to saliva (e.g., contamination of deep fight wounds) and possibly blood. A wide range of animal species have been experimentally infected with SFV. No evidence of pathogenicity has been detected in these species or the natural nonhuman primate hosts although lifelong, stable virus persistence is suspected (Khan, 2009 ). Human infection with SFV has been documented with no apparent ill effects. The virus has recently been detected in the saliva of infected humans (Huang et al., 2012) . Humanto-human transmission has not been detected, suggesting that humans may serve as dead-end hosts. In Africa and Asia, human infection is believed to result from contact with infected wild nonhuman primates, especially during their hunting, butchering, or consumption (Khan, 2009) . It is debatable if a human foamy virus variant exists. However, foamy virus infections have been confirmed on multiple occasions. The first was reported in 1971 from the cell culture of an East African patient with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The isolated foamy virus was, based on immunologic and sequence data, judged to be closely related to a chimpanzee foamy virus (Heneine et al., 1998; Schweizer et al., 1997) . The second case involved an animal handler employed at a research institute for over 20 years and who had suffered multiple bite wounds from African green monkeys. The worker became seropositive for foamy virus within 6 years of employment. African green monkey foamy virus DNA was later detected in his peripheral blood mononuclear cells, indicating persistent yet asymptomatic infection (Schweizer et al., 1997) . A subsequent survey of U.S. and Canadian workers with occupational exposure to nonhuman primates revealed evidence of SFV infection via serology, proviral DNA detection, and/or virus isolation in 4 of the 231 individuals tested. Each of the four was employed at different institutions. Three individuals were infected with SFV of baboon origin, one with SFV of African green monkey origin. Infection was asymptomatic in all four individuals and evidence of infection was not found among their close contacts, including the three spouses tested (Heneine et al., 1998) . From these and other confirmed cases of human infection (Gessain et al., 2013; Switzer et al., 2004) , it is now assumed that human infections with SFV result in a latent, asymptomatic infection with minimal risk for human-to-human transmission.",

Macaques and other species of Old World primates commonly develop a mild upper respiratory infection although asymptomatic infections occur. Clinical signs most frequently seen in Old World monkeys include nasal and ocular discharge, conjunctivitis, facial edema, blepharitis, and a maculopapular skin rash. The rash first develops on the ventral body surface then becomes generalized before ultimately progressing to a dry and scaly desquamative dermatitis. Immunosuppression is common. Occasionally, measles infection progresses to depression, anorexia, coughing, and dyspnea in conjunction with giant cell pneumonia. Abortions and neurologic signs have also been reported. Koplik's spots inconsistently appear on the buccal mucosa (Wachtman and Mansfield, 2012) . Morbidity is high and mortality, caused by secondary bacterial infections, is low in Old World monkeys. The disease is much more severe in marmosets, owl monkeys, and colobines in which hemorrhagic gastroenteritis and immunosuppression predominate and respiratory tract lesions and the skin rash are absent or less significant. To mitigate the possibility of introducing the virus into a susceptible monkey population, personnel working with these primates should have a measles virus antibody titer to assess their immunity to the virus.",

A monovalent human measles vaccine is effective in protecting both Old World and New World monkeys from the disease. A less expensive monovalent vaccine designed for use in dogs has been shown to be equally effective.

Animals, however, are thought to play a significant role in the emergence of new human strains of influenza virus and may serve as disease reservoirs. Animals can be infected with influenza strains that then undergo mutational and reassortment events resulting in the emergence of a novel, pathogenic virus transmissible to humans. Pigs are well-known examples and are believed to serve as 'mixing vessels' during the adaptation of avian influenza viruses to human hosts, although their full role in this capacity is still unknown (De Vleeschauwer et al., 2009; Mak et al., 2012; Webster, 1997) . In the laboratory, ferrets are highly susceptible to human influenza and often are used as experimental models of influenza infection (Belser et al., 2011) . Recently, concern of avianto-mammalian transmission has intensified, as such transmissions are presumed to have occurred resulting in human fatalities such as in the 1997 H5N1 influenza outbreak in Hong Kong. In addition, the human influenza viruses from the 1918, 1957, and 1968 pandemics are believed to have originated in avian species (CDCP-NIH, 2009 ).",

The prevalence of the infection among sheep is high throughout the United States, and sheep have been the primary species associated with disease outbreaks associated with research animal facilities . However, human cases of the disease have also been associated with nonruminants, such as pregnant cats (Langley et al., 1988; Kopecny et al., 2013) and wild rabbits (Marrie et al., 1986) . Thus, a broad range of domestic and wild animal species, including birds, should be given consideration as potential sources for Q fever infection in animal care and use activities .

The primary method of transmission is through infectious aerosols. The organism produces a spore-like form that is resistant to desiccation and persists in the environment for long periods of time, contributing to the widespread dissemination of infectious aerosols and resulting in infections miles from the original organism source (Franz et al., 1997; Tissot-Dupont et al., 1999) . The importance of these factors was (Bernard et al., 1982) . In these outbreaks, personnel who did not have direct contact with infected sheep but who worked along the transport routes for these animals became serologically positive for Q fever (Bernard et al., 1982; Reimer, 1993) . Also, five of nine laundry workers without direct sheep contact but who processed linens soiled during sheep surgery developed serological evidence of infection.",

However, serious extrapulmonary complications, such as acute or chronic hepatitis, nephritis, epicarditis, and endocarditis, may also occur. Individuals with valvular heart disease should not work with C. burnetii due to the prospect of serious, chronic, relapsing infection (Asher, 1989; Chosewood and Wilson, 2009) .

Multiple commercial vendors now supply sheep from closed, SPF flocks that have been serologically negative for an extended period. Although serological status is not a reliable indicator of organism shedding in an individual sheep, many institutions have elected to use these animals, reasoning that cumulative and consistent negative Q fever serology on a herd basis provides a reasonably strong assurance of Q fever-free status. Advances in PCR methods have improved the sensitivity of C. burnetii detection over that of the antigen capture ELISA, as well as improved the speed, safety, and convenience of the assay. The PCR method allows for the assessment of organism shedding, which may provide an option to minimize the potential risk of Q fever outbreaks in animal facilities (Lorenz et al., 1998; Yanase et al., 1998) . However, shedding can be sporadic, and diagnostic samples such as amniotic fluid and placenta are not readily available antemortem. A combination of colony health components such as acquisition from a 'clean' flock, serological testing of incoming animals with follow-up postmortem PCR screening can be combined for a comprehensive program to minimize Q fever risks.",

In many institutions, ABSL3 compliant physical containment for sheep may prove to be unachievable as a preventative measure for sheep held under agricultural conditions for food and fiber production or utilized for instructional exercises.

A proposal to split a number of species into the new genus Chlamydophila has been published (Everett et al., 1999) , but it has not been uniformly adopted by the scientific community and the latest edition of Bergey's Manual retains the designation of these species as Chlamydia spp. (Kuo et al., 2010) . Chlamydial species are widely distributed among birds and mammals worldwide and occur naturally among many laboratory animal species, including birds, mice, guinea pigs, hamsters, rabbits, ruminants, swine, cats, ferrets, muskrats, and frogs (Storz, 1971; Newcomer et al., 1982) . Of these host species, birds with Chlamydia psittaci infection, particularly psittacines, have proven to be the most frequent sources of virulent human infection (CDCP, 1997); however, infections with C. abortus in ruminants (Hyde and Benirschke, 1997; Jorgesen, 1997) and C. felis in cats (Cotton and Partridge, 1998) also have the potential to cause human disease. The most common human chlamydial infection, C. trachomatis, is not naturally transmissible to animals but is used to produce experimental infections in nonhuman primates. C. muridarium occurring in the mouse and C. suis occurring in the pig are closely related to C. trachomatis but are not infectious for humans. C. caviae has been isolated from the guinea pig. C. pecorum produces intestinal LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE infection in ruminants and other animals but not in humans. C. pneumoniae produces respiratory infections in humans and related biovars have been isolated from the koala, horse, frog, and reptiles (Bodetti, et al., 2002) . Zoonotic infections from animal-related biovars of Chlamydia pneumoniae have not been recorded, but genomic studies suggest that one or more animal-tohuman transmission events led to the establishment of the human C. pneumonia biovar (Roulis et al., 2013) .",

A variety of serological tests are available, but differentiation between active infection and previous exposure can be difficult. Whenever possible, birds used in research animal facilities should be acquired from flocks free from C. psittaci infection. Prophylactic antibiotic treatment should be considered for wild-caught birds or birds of unknown disease status, and therapeutic antibiotics may be useful when treating mammals or amphibians diagnosed with chlamydial infection. Personnel protection adhering to ABSL-2 procedures along with respiratory protection is generally adequate when dealing with known infections, but ABSL-3 procedures are warranted for research activities with the high potential for droplet or infectious aerosol production, such as necropsy of known-infected birds (Chosewood and Wilson, 2009 ).",

As with bites from dogs and cats, the majority of rat bites occur in children. It is estimated that 2% of rat bites become infected (Ordog, 1985) .

Common organisms isolated from dog bites include Staphylococcus species, Streptococcus species, including S. canis and a variety of anaerobes, and Pasteurella multocida (Takeda et al., 2001; Bert and Lambert-Zechovsky, 1997) . Also, a case of zoonotic transmission of S. equi subsp. zooepidemicus from a dog to its handler, via wound infection or aerosols, has been recently reported (Abbott et al., 2010) . In a comprehensive multicenter study, 60% of dog bite wounds were punctures, 10% were lacerations, and 30% were a combination of both. This compared to 85% of cat bite wounds being punctures, 3% lacerations, and 12% a combination of both. In this study, 39% of 57 patients with cat bites presented as purulent wounds, whereas abscesses were present in 19% of the cases reviewed (Talan et al., 1999) . Of the 50 patients with dog bites, 58% had purulent wounds, 30% were nonpurulent, and 12% were noted to have abscesses. Dog and cat bites had a mean of five bacterial species per wound; 63% of the cat bites analyzed compared to 48% of dog bites had a mixed anaerobic and aerobic population (Talan et al., 1999) . Only aerobes grew in 36% of the cases (42% of dog bites and 32% cat bites), whereas anaerobes were the only species grown in 1% of the cases. Capnocytophaga canimorsus, an invasive organism, was recovered from 4.7% of the wounds. It should be noted that if fever occurs in immunocompromised patients (including asplenic individuals) after a bite wound, this organism should be considered in the differential diagnosis. Erysipelothrix rhusiopathiae was isolated from two cat bite wounds, whereas Pasteurella spp. were present in the wounds 75% of the time in cats and 50% in dogs. Geographic locale is also important in defining bacterial flora of bites and scratches. In a study conducted in the southwestern and central United States, 17 of 1041 (1.6%) of the cases of tularemia in humans diagnosed from 1981 to 1987 were associated with cat scratches or bites (Taylor et al., 1991) .",

Historically, bites from wild rats and subsequent illness (usually in small children) relate to poor sanitation and overcrowding (Hull, 1955) . One survey of rat bites in Baltimore tabulated RBF in 11 of 87 cases (Brooks, 1973) . The disease can also occur in individuals who have no history of rat bites but reside or work in rat-infested areas. Exposure to dogs and cats who prey on wild rodents may also be the source of the organism. Ingestion of milk, food, or water contaminated with rat feces can result in RBF (CDC, 1995) .",

Because of its properties as a bacterial growth promoter, sodium polyanethol sulfonate, which is sometimes found in blood-based media, should not be used due to its inhibitory effects on S. moniliformis. Growth on agar consists of 1-2 mm gray, glistening colonies. The API ZYM diagnostic system can be used for rapid biochemical analysis and diagnosis. Unfortunately, no serological test is available. Acute febrile diseases, especially if associated with animal bites, are routinely treated with penicillin or other antibiotics.",

Subsequently there is self-inoculation by scratching the flea bite, or alternatively by having the contaminated claws or teeth of cats inoculate the organism into traumatized skin. Importantly, several surveys have shown that cats can be chronically infected with B. henselae, with the organism capable of being isolated from blood of asymptomatic cats over an extended period of time (Koehler et al., 1994; Goldstein and Greene, 2009) .

Sciurid rodents (rock squirrels, California ground squirrels, chipmunks, and prairie dogs) account for the primary plague reservoir in the western parts of the United States (Kaufman et al., 1980; Rosner, 1987) . Cricetid rodents, such as the wood rat, are occasionally cited as reservoir hosts. The oriental rat flea, X. cheopis, the common vector of plague, is well established throughout the United States, particularly in the southern states and southern California. It is important to remember that more than 1500 species of fleas and 230 species of rodents are infected with Y. pestis. Only 30-40 rodent species, however, are permanent reservoirs of the infection (Macy, 1999) . Plague is infrequently reported in the United States, with a low of one case in 1972 and a high of 40 cases in 1983 (Craven and Barnes, 1991) . Ninety percent of the cases have been diagnosed in New Mexico, Colorado, and California. Urban development (particularly in New Mexico) encroached into plague-enzootic rodent habitats, placing human populations at increased risk of contracting the disease. In addition to rodent epizootics, dogs, and increasingly cats, either have served as passive transporters of the disease or have been actively infected (Rosner, 1987) . The disease has seasonal peaks, with the highest proportion occurring May through September.",

In the 1950s, in a study conducted in Baltimore, 45.5% of 1643 rats were infected with Leptospira; higher prevalence rates occurred in older rats (approximately 60%). In the late LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE 1970s, more than 90% of adult Brown Norway rats sampled in Detroit were infected with L. icterohaemorrhagiae (Thiermann, 1977) . Other studies confirm the high prevalence of this organism in wild rats inhabiting U.S. cities (Alexander, 1984; Sanger and Thiermann, 1988) . Rodent reservoir hosts of leptospirosis, in addition to rats, include mice, field moles, hedgehogs, gerbils, squirrels, rabbits, and hamsters (Torten, 1979; Fox and Lipman, 1991) . Livestock serve as a significant source of primary long-term shedding of at least three serovars. Cattle are the natural carriers of the serotype L. hardjo, whereas swine carry L. pomona and L. bratislava; each animal can shed the organism for extended periods in their urine. Dogs also commonly harbor two other serotypes; feral dogs harbor L. icterohaemorrhagiae as well as serve as natural carrier hosts of L. canicola. Sheep, goats, and horses can also be infected with a variety of serotypes. Raccoons are reservoirs of L. autumnalis and L. grippotyhosa, whereas rats, mice, and other wild rodents are common animal hosts for another serotype, L. ballum. In wild mice, the infection can persist unnoticed for the animal's lifetime and can also be harbored by laboratory mice, although their carrier rates in the United States are unknown (Torten, 1979) . There was, however, a report of leptospirosis in a research colony of mice in the United States in the early 1980s (Alexander, 1984) . In several European laboratories, personnel have contracted leptospires from laboratory rats (Geller, 1979) .",

Skin abrasions or mucous membrane exposure may serve as the portal of entry in humans. All secretions and excretions from infected animals should be considered infective. In one instance, a father apparently was infected after his daughter used his toothbrush to clean a contaminated pet mouse cage. Handling infected wild rats increases the risk of contracting leptospires (Luzzi et al., 1987) . Also, a young man died of acute leptospirosis by falling into a heavily polluted river contaminated with L. icterohaemorrhagiae (Sanger and Thiermann, 1988) . In addition, rodent bites can transmit the disease. Children living in rat-infested tenements may be at increased risk of infection. For example, children from inner-city Detroit had significantly higher L. icterohaemorrhagiae antibody titers when compared to those of children living in the Detroit suburbs (Demers et al., 1983) . It is important to note that leptospirosis can infect hosts on a chronic basis, by colonizing their kidney tubules. Outbreaks of leptospirosis in humans with varying mortality in underdeveloped countries have been documented in 1995-1998. Clinical Signs The disease may vary from inapparent to severe infection and death. Individuals infected with Leptospira spp. experience a biphasic disease (Sanger and Thiermann, 1988; Faine, 1991) . They become suddenly ill with weakness, headache, myalgia, malaise, chills, and fever, and usually exhibit leukocytosis. During the second phase of the disease, which is immunologically mediated, conjunctival suffusion and a rash may occur (Fig. 28.7) . On examination, renal, hepatic, pulmonary, and gastrointestinal findings may be abnormal. The most severe form of the diseases, known as Weil's disease, is characterized by hepatic and renal dysfunction, hemorrhage, and circulatory collapse (Bharti et al., 2003; Levett, 2001) . Treatment of the disease is controversial given the disease is self-limiting. Penicillin is the drug of choice in treating early onset of leptospirosis infection (Vinetz, 2003) . Comparison of penicillins to ceftriaxone, cefotaxime, and doxycycline in cases of severe leptospirosis indicated that all of these antibiotics were equally efficacious in reducing fever and clinical complications (Vinetz, 2003) . Ampicillin and doxycycline have also been effective in treating people with leptospirosis.",

            "text": "Diagnosis and Control Leptospirosis in humans is often difficult to diagnose; therefore, the low incidence of reported infection in humans may be misleading. Outbreaks have been documented in the United States from personnel working with laboratory mice (Stoenner and Maclean, 1958; Barkin et al., 1974) . In one study, 8 of 58 employees handling infected laboratory mice (80% of breeding females were excreting L. ballum in their urine) contracted leptospirosis (Stoenner and Maclean, 1958) . Personnel performing field research may be predisposed to developing leptospirosis and other zoonotic diseases, since occupational exposure to wild animal habitats is a work-related risk factor (Adjemian et al., 2012) . Because of the variability in clinical symptoms and lack LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE of pathognomonic findings in humans and animals, serological diagnosis or actual isolation of leptospires is imperative (Bharti et al., 2003; Levett, 2001) . As an aid to diagnosis, leptospires can sometimes be observed by examination or direct staining of body fluids or fresh tissue suspensions. The definitive diagnosis in humans or animals is made by culturing the organisms from tissue or fluid samples. Culture media with long-chain fatty acids with 1% bovine serum albumin are routinely used as a detoxicant (Faine, 1991) . Serological assessment is accomplished by indirect hemagglutination, agglutination analysis, complement fixation, microscopic agglutination, and fluorescent antibody techniques (Faine, 1991) . Growth of the organism is slow, and cultures should be incubated in the dark for 6 weeks at 30\u00b0C (Goldstein, 1991; Collins and Lorber, 2009 ). The serological test most frequently used is the microscopic agglutination test, which employs dark-field microscopy. Titers of 1:100 or greater are considered significant. When comparing serological assays, ELISA and dot ELISA have the highest sensitivities and specificities (Goldstein, 1991; Collins and Lorber, 2009 ). PCR-based assays are also available for diagnosis (Smythe et al., 2002) . Personnel hygiene and protective garments that minimize exposure to infected urine and other infected animal tissue are important for control of zoonotic infection with leptospires.",

Because H. cinaedi has been isolated from normal intestinal flora of hamsters, it was suggested that the pet hamsters served as a reservoir for transmission to the mother. The mother had a diarrheal illness during the third trimester of pregnancy; the newborn was likely to have been infected during the birthing process, although this was not proven (Orlicek et al., 1993) . Furthermore, the hamster has been suggested as possibly infecting other humans with H. cinaedi (Gebhart et al., 1989) . Studies are needed to confirm zoonotic risk of handling H. cinaedi-infected hamsters (Gebhart et al., 1989) . Also of interest is the isolation, based on cellular fatty acid and biochemical identification, and molecular analysis, of H. cinaedi from the feces of dogs, cats, and nonhuman primates.

Because of the slow growth of H. cinaedi and other enteric helicobacters, laboratory diagnosis is unlikely if blood culture procedures that rely on visual detection of the culture media are used (Kiehlbauch et al., 1994; Burman et al., 1995; Kiehlbauch et al., 1995) . Use of dark-field microscopy or acridine orange staining of blood culture media, rather than gram staining, increases likelihood of seeing the organism. Likewise, fecal isolation is difficult; selective antibiotic media are required, and recovery is facilitated by passing fecal homogenates through a 0.45-pm filter (Gebhart et al., 1989) . In one study, several strains of both H. cinaedi and H. fennelliae were inhibited by concentrations of cephalothin and cetazolin used frequently in selective media for isolation of enteric microaerophilic bacterium. These organisms also require an environment rich in hydrogen for optimum in vitro growth. Until diagnostic laboratories embark on routine isolation attempts of Helicobacter spp. from feces, the extent of their presence in companion and pocket pets and their zoonotic potential will be unknown.",

In colony-reared dogs, cats, and nonhuman primates, GHLO infection may approach 100%. H. pylori, the primary gastric pathogen in humans, has been isolated from only one colony of commercial cats and macaque species. If H. pylori, as demonstrated in commercially reared cats (Handt et al., 1994; Fox et al., 1996) , is isolated from pet cats, the zoonotic potential of helicobacteriosis from cats would obviously increase substantially. H. pylori infection is an important cause of human gastritis; however, most epidemiologic studies do not incriminate animal contact as a cause of human infection. An epidemiologic survey conducted in Germany did not show an increased risk of H. pylori because of cat ownership. In a serological survey measuring antibodies to H. pylori, lower socioeconomic status, and not pet ownership or day care, was associated with seropositivity (Staat et al., 1996) .",

Until all animal feeds in the United States and Europe are Salmonella-free and animals are procured from Salmonella-free sources, laboratory animal-associated cases of salmonellosis in humans will continue. The increasing number of recalls due to Salmonellacontaminated, commercially available dog and cat food, presumably manufactured in facilities with improper quality control procedures, is particularly of concern (CDC, 2012c). Endemic salmonellosis in commercially raised guinea pigs as well as dogs, cats, and nonhuman primates has also been a source of infection in personnel working with these animals. Prevalence data from eight studies conducted worldwide indicated that a wide range (0.6-27%) of cats were culture positive for Salmonella, and a conservative estimate for the U.S. canine population would be 10%. Rats are extremely susceptible to infection with Salmonella. In studies performed in the 1920s through 1940s, the prevalence of Salmonella in wild rats surveyed in the United States varied from 1% to 18%, compared to 19% in Europe (Geller, 1979; Weisbroth, 1979; Alexander, 1984) . In experimental studies, when rats were dosed orally with Salmonella, 10% shed the organism in the 2 months after inoculation, and a few remained carriers when examined 5 months after experimental challenge. These rats, when placed with other naive rats, were capable of initiating new epizootics. Fortunately, the disease in laboratory rats, although common prior to 1939, has been isolated rarely in U.S. commercially reared rats since that time. Birds and reptiles are particularly dangerous sources of Salmonella; as much as 94% of all reptiles harbor Salmonella. (Chiodini and Sundberg, 1981) . Turtles have received a great deal of zoonotic attention and in 1970 alone may have caused 280,000 human cases of salmonellosis. In the late 1960s, with annual sales of 15 million turtles, zoonotic salmonellosis became a growing problem. In 1972, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) banned importation of turtles and turtle eggs and the interstate shipment of turtles that were not certified as free of Salmonella or Arizona hinshawii in their state of origin. However, the unreliable effectiveness of this method forced the FDA in 1975 to rule against the sale of viable turtle eggs or live turtles with a carapace length less than 10.2 cm, with exceptions made for educational or scientific institutions and marine turtles. Subsequently, there was a substantial decrease in turtle-associated salmonellosis, indicating the efficacy of this regulation. These restrictions are difficult to enforce, and other reptiles, e.g., iguanas, are increasingly cited in zoonotic outbreaks of salmonellosis, particularly in children. Also of note, because of repeated reports of chick-and duckling-associated salmonellosis, some states have also restricted their sale as pets.",

            "text": "An outbreak of multidrug resistant S. enterica serovar Typhimurium associated with commercially distributed pet rodents, including rats, mice, and hamsters, was recently reported (Swanson et al., 2007) . Twenty-eight matching isolates identified by PFGE of S. enterica serotype Typhimurium from humans were identified from humans; 13 (59%) had previously had contact with rodents purchased from retail pet stores and 2 patients (9%) had secondarily acquired the infection from a patient who had been exposed to an infected rodent. These 15 patients whose median age was 16 years (neonate-43) resided in 10 different states. No single source of rodents was common in all cases and each case household had purchased the rodents from a different retail pet store. It was ascertained that several of the rodent breeders and distributors routinely used antimicrobials (e.g., spectinomycin, leptomycin, tetracycline, and nitrofurazone) in the drinking water as a preventative measure for nonspecific rodent enteritis. Interestingly, all human animal and environmental samples of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium isolates tested in this outbreak were uniformly resistant to ampicillin, chloramphenicol, streptomycin, sulfisoxazole, and tetracycline (R-type ACSSuT). Patients infected with multiple antibiotic resistant strains of S. enterica serotype Typhimurium have higher hospitalization rates than patients infected with susceptible strains (Martin, 2004; Varma, 2005) . There are also reports of increased risk of septicemia, treatment failure, and mortality associated with multidrug resistant S. enterica serotype Typhimurium (Helms et al., 2002) . The spread of these multiple antibiotic resistant strains in rodents may have been facilitated by the widespread use of antibiotics as a prophylactic measure in the pocket pet retail industry. Indeed treatment with oral antibiotics may eliminate normal enterobacteriacae enteric flora and facilitate colonization with antibiotic resistant Salmonella, as observed in mice treated with antimicrobials (Que, 1985; van der Waaij, 1968; van der Waaij et al., 1971 . The authors of this outbreak urged heightened disease surveillance in pet retail facilities, as well as increased hygiene and husbandry practices to minimize the need for prophylactic antimicrobial therapy. Individuals purchasing rodents as pets or for food consumption by reptiles should be alerted to the possibility that these animals' feces are potentially infectious. For example, additional outbreaks of Salmonellosis have been traced to households that have pet snakes. The source of Salmonella infection in humans, particularly children, was caring for the pet snakes that, as part of their diet, were fed Salmonella-infected frozen rats and mice sold commercially in the United States, as well as the United Kingdom (Fuller, 2008; Harker et al., 2011) . Aquatic frogs, particularly African dwarf frogs, can also be a source of Salmonella infection (CDC, 2010b; CDC, 2011) . This highlights the importance of ascertaining pet status of prospective animal technicians who have applied for positions in vivaria. Another multistate outbreak of S. enterica serovar Typhimurium has been recently reported due to exposure to infected pet hedgehogs (Marsden-Haug et al., 2013) . The increased incidence of Salmonella infections can be reduced by hand washing with soap and water after handling of rodents, their cages, and bedding.",

As with other microbial infections, the severity of the disease relates to the serotype of the organism, the number of bacteria ingested, and the susceptibility of the host. In experimental studies with volunteers, several serovars induced a LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE spectrum of clinical disease, from brief enteritis to serious debilitation. Incubation varied from 7 to 72 h. Cases of asymptomatic carriers, persisting for several weeks, were common (Hull, 1955) .",

In one double-blind placebo study of infants, oral antibiotics did not significantly affect the duration of Salmonella carriage. Bacteriological relapse after antibiotic treatment occurred in 53% of the patients, and 33% of these suffered a recurrence of diarrhea, whereas none of the placebo group relapsed (Nelson et al., 1980) . Also of interest is the fact that in outbreaks of DT104 S. enterica serotype Typhimurium infection, a high percentage of patients had been recently on antibiotics before becoming infected with the S. enterica serovar Typhimurium strain DT104 (Molba et al., 1999) .",

Fat and moisture in food promote survival of Salmonella. Pasteurization of milk and proper cooking of food (56\u00b0C for 10-20 min) effectively destroy Salmonella. In the laboratory, control and prevention of salmonellosis depends on the rapid detection, removal, or treatment of both acute and chronic animal infections, particularly during the quarantine period. Multiple antibiotic resistance is commonly encountered in Salmonella strains. For example, multiple-resistant S. enterica serotype Typhimurium strain DT104 has been increasingly cited (in Europe and recently in the United States) as a cause of human infections (Tauxe, 1999) . Importantly, this organism has been isolated from farm animals, cats, wild birds, rodents, foxes, and badgers. It definitely has been transmitted from cattle and sheep to humans and has caused epizootic gastroenteritis and fatal bacteremia in dairy cattle (Besser et al., 1997) .",

In one interesting report, three children with B. bronchiseptica infection developed whooping cough-like symptoms; both their pet rabbits and cats subsequently died of B. bronchiseptica pneumonia (Kristensen and Lautrop, 1962) .

It is caused by acid-fast bacilli of the genus Mycobacterium. Natural reservoir hosts for the etiologic agent of this disease correspond to the three most common species of Mycobacterium: M. bovis, M. avium complex, and M. tuberculosis. Although cattle, birds, and humans are the major reservoir hosts, many animals, including swine, sheep, goats, monkeys, cats, dogs, and ferrets, are susceptible and contribute to the spread of disease (Marini et al., 1989; Fox and Marini, 2014; Swennes and Fox, 2014) . This susceptibility varies according to the immune response of the host and to the particular Mycobacterium spp. infecting the host. In nonhuman primates, outbreaks of tuberculosis still occur, particularly in the Old World species of monkeys. They initially contract the disease in the wild through human contact, and then the organism is transmitted from monkey to monkey (Richter et al., 1984) .",

However, this vaccine often elicits a positive tuberculin test, thereby negating the best diagnostic indicator of early disease.

Epidemics of amebiasis in humans usually result from ingestion of fecally contaminated water containing amebic cysts. Laboratory animal workers handling nonhuman primates are potentially exposed to infection from infected fecal matter transferred through the workers' skin or clothing. The infective cyst forms may be subsequently ingested.",

The disease may have periods of remission and exacerbation over months to years (Ravdin, 2000) .

The organism must be carefully measured to differentiate it from other nonpathogenic amebas. As is the case with many infectious agents potentially present in stool samples, PCR screening methods have also been developed (Rivera et al., 2010) . Control measures to prevent amebiasis should include strict adherence to sanitation and personal hygiene practices. Water supplies should be protected from fecal contamination since usual water purification chlorine levels do not destroy the cysts (Chin, 2000) . A chlorine concentration of 10 ppm is necessary to kill amebic cysts (Ravdin, 2000) . Cysts may also be killed by heating to 50\u00b0C. Nonhuman primates should be screened during quarantine to identify carriers of E. histolytica and should be appropriately treated. Nonhuman primates with acute diarrhea or dysentery should also have stool examined for the presence of E. histolytica and should be treated as necessary. Recommended drugs for treatment of E. histolytica infection include metronidazole, paromomycin, emetine, and iodoquinol (diiodohydroxyquin). The benzoate salt of metronidazole does not posess the bitterness inherent in standard preparations and is useful for oral regimens. Both asymptomatic carriers and symptomatic patients should be treated (Ravdin, 2000) .",

Disease transmission is through ingestion of infectious oocysts.

Another transmission was recorded in an individual who became infected performing a survey of Cryptosporidium spp. in calves (Reese et al., 1982) . In this patient, clinical remission occurred by day 13, and oocytes of cryptosporidium were no longer apparent on fecal flotation (Fig. 28.9 ). Disease in neonatal ruminants may be subclinical or may present with protracted watery diarrhea, very similar to what occurs in humans. Symptoms in humans occur 1-2 weeks after contact with infected calves, and diarrhea may be accompanied by vomiting, severe abdominal cramps, lassitude, fever, and headache. Disease is generally self-limiting except in immunocompromised individuals (Fayer and Ungar, 1986) . Most of the recorded cases of protracted human cryptosporidiosis have occurred in immunodeficient individuals, particularly AIDS patients, and are regarded as opportunistic infections (Chin, 2000) . Disease in these individuals produced low-grade fever, malaise, anorexia, nausea, abdominal cramps, and a protracted, watery diarrhea.

Historical classification schemes have speciated Giardia based on host origin, since the recovered cysts are for the most part morphologically indistinguishable. However, based on experimental infections, it is known that cross-species transmission can occur. Considering the cosmopolitan distribution of the parasite in wild and domestic animals, the potential for zoonotic transmission appears significant. When infected beavers were identified in the watersheds associated with human waterborne outbreaks, this circumstantial evidence led to supposition that beavers were the cause (Dykes et al., 1980; Keifer et al., 1980) and resulted in the disease being referred to as 'beaver fever.' Experimental transmission studies showed that cysts from a beaver source can infect dogs as well as human volunteers (Davies et al., 1979) . However, further studies comparing the infectious dose of homologous and heterologous isolates determined that host-adapted strains are more readily transmitted, and the significantly higher innolum required for cross-species transmission in some cases is enough to lend some doubt to the likelihood of natural transmission (Erlandsen et al., 1988) . Wildlife giardiasis may be a reverse zoonosis whereby human contamination of the environment leads to animal infection (Thompson et al., 2011) . To paraphrase a veterinary school lecture comment by parasitologist Dr. W.J. Bemrick (attended by author GO), \"Show me a stream where humans contracted giardiasis and I'll show you a stream contaminated by humans.\"",

In addition, as the definitive hosts in the T. gondii life cycle, felines develop intestinal infection, with the shedding of oocysts. Thus, the domestic cat is the primary reservoir for the zoonotic transmission of T. gondii in the laboratory environment. The three common modes of transmission are congenital infection, ingestion of T. gondii-infected tissue, and ingestion of toxoplasma oocytes or from direct exposure and consumption of contaminated food or water (Dubey, 1998) . Most postnatally acquired infections in cats are asymptomatic and have a variable prepatent period and pattern of oocyst shedding. The prepatent period can be as brief as 3 days if the cat has ingested mice or meat containing T. gondii cysts, or it can be as long as several weeks if oocysts have been ingested. Shedding of oocysts in the feces occurs for 1-2 weeks, during which time cats are considered a public health risk (Dubey, 1998) . Oocysts become infectious after sporulation, which occurs in 1-5 days. Oocysts survive best in warm, moist soil. Oocyst shedding is less likely to occur if the cat was infected by oocysts or tachyzoites than if infection resulted from the ingestion of Toxoplasma cysts. Oocyst shedding can be reactivated by induction of hypercorticism or by superinfection with other feline microorganisms, such as Isospora felis (Chessman, 1972) . Oocysts of T. gondii have been observed infrequently in the feces of naturally infected cats (Ladiges et al., 1982) , and shedding usually precedes the development of antibody titers to T. gondii. The oocyst is very hardy and can survive freezing and as much as several months of extreme heat and dehydration. Importantly, high IgG titers do not prove recent or active infection (Dubey et al., 1995) .",

In addition to sporadic clinical cases, occasional epidemics can occur when humans are exposed to oocyst-contaminated environments (Teutsch et al., 1979) . Populations at high risk of infection are pregnant women and immunodeficient individuals. Congenital infection in humans results in systemic disease, frequently with severe neuropathological changes. Postnatal infection results in disease that is less severe and commonly presents as nondescript, consisting of fever, myalgia, and generalized lymphadenopathy that may resolve without treatment in a few weeks. Asymptomatic infection may recrudesce with encephalitis if patients become immunocompromised. Although rare, serious systemic toxoplasmosis can be acquired by older individuals. This is manifested by fever, maculopapular eruption, malaise, myalgia, arthralgia, posterior cervical lymphadenopathy, pneumonia, myocarditis, and meningoencephalitis. Ocular toxoplasmosis, usually chorioretinitis, is commonly seen in postnatal infections but can also occur in infections of older individuals. Clinically severe and progressive LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE illness is most likely to develop in immunocompromised individuals. As high as 10% of AIDS patients have toxoplasmosis (Gill and Stone, 1992) . These patients develop neurologic disease and can experience convulsions, paralysis, or coma or even die from toxoplasmosis, even after treatment is administered. Infection in these cases is considered in most cases to be reactivation of tissue cysts from a chronic infection.",

The preferred therapy in humans is pyrimethamine administered in combination with a sulfa drug. Laboratory-acquired infections are likely restricted to the use and handling of laboratory cats (DiGiacomo et al., 1990) . Rigorous sanitation should effectively prevent human toxoplasmosis from occurring in the laboratory environment. Since oocysts must sporulate before they are infectious, daily cleaning of litter plans will prevent accumulation of infectious oocysts. Personnel should wear gloves when handling litter pans and wash their hands thoroughly before eating. Pregnant women should completely avoid contact with cat feces. Most cats acquire infection shortly after weaning and shed the oocysts for a short period of time (<3 weeks). Nevertheless, unsporulated oocysts are more susceptible to proper disinfection, and control of exposure should be centered around disinfection of litter pans at this stage.",

However, arthropods can serve as vectors to systemic illnesses such as rickettsial pox, tularemia, and Lyme disease. Those working with laboratory animals, particularly those species arriving directly from their natural habitat, should be familiar with the arthropods capable of transmitting these diseases. Mites probably pose the greatest health hazard, not only because they are the most common inhabitants in number and variety of species, but because they also readily transmit agents from almost every major group of pathogens: bacteria, chlamydia, rickettsia, viruses, protozoa, spirochetes, and helminths (Yunker, 1964) . In addition, most of these mites are capable of producing severe allergic papular dermatitis in humans (Fox and Reed, 1978; Fox, 1982b) (Fig. 28.11) . Control of mite infestation is primarily dependent on their habitats. Some, such as Sarcoptes spp. and Notoedres spp., are obligate parasites that require treatment of the host. Other mites, such as Ornithonyssus bacoti, which live most of the time off the animal, require treatment of the environment with appropriate insecticides (Markell et al., 1999; Fox, 2009 , Fox, 1982b .",

Ticks, like mites, can transmit a variety of diseases, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever, tick-borne typhus, Lyme disease, and others (Table 28 .4). Lyme borreliosis is a commonly reported tick-borne infection in Europe and North America. The illness is caused by a spirochete, Borrelia burgdorferi, which is transmitted during the blood feeding of ticks of the genus Ixodes. The larvae and nymphs feed readily on a wide range of hosts, including birds, and an abundance of reservoir hosts exists, usually small and medium-sized animals. Larger animals, such as deer, sheep, cows, or horses, must be present for the maintenance of the tick population since adult ticks only engorge successfully on larger animals. Transmission occurs through salivation during the feeding process on a host. Control of ticks indoors is aimed primarily at the resting places of the unattached ticks and proper treatment of newly arrived animals, which are noted for harboring ticks.",

Three rodent fleas, X. cheopis, Nasopsyllus fasciatus, and Leptopsylla segnis, have been found in a high percentage of urban dwellings in certain areas of the United States and are potential transmitters of disease in the laboratory. Apparently, X. cheopis in the past was readily established in animal facilities. At a Midwestern U.S. university, it inhabited rooms housing laboratory mice, where on two separate occasions fleas bit students (Yunker, 1964) . L. segnis, the mouse and rat flea, bites humans and is a vector for plague and typhus, serious diseases in humans. L. segnis can also serve as an intermediate host for the rodent tapeworms H. (Rodentolepsis) nana and H. diminuta, both of which can infect humans (Markell et al., 1999) . The flea bite can be irritating and can cause allergic dermatitis. The cat flea, Ctenocephalides felis, is the most common flea in and around human dwellings in the United States. This flea is capable of experimentally transmitting plague and murine typhus, and therefore, the potential exists for transmitting the disease to humans. Control of fleas consists of treatment of infested areas as well as the primary host; in the case of rodent fleas, the animal facility must be free of feral rodents and their entry to prevent introduction of these arthropods.

Oral and transcutaneous routes of infection occur. Heavy infections produce transient respiratory signs during larval migration followed by anemia due to gastrointestinal blood loss. Old World primates Humans Heavy infections result in anemia. Encapsulated parasitic granulomas are usually an inocuous sequella to infection.
