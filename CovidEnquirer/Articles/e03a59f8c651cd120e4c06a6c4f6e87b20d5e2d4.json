            "text": "In this study, we report the fabrication of aluminum oxide-coated glass (ACG) slides for the preparation of glycan microarrays. Pure aluminum (Al, 300 nm) was coated on glass slides via electron-beam vapor deposition polymerization (VDP), followed by anodization to form a thin layer (50\u221265 nm) of aluminum oxide (Aloxide) on the surface. The ACG slides prepared this way provide a smooth surface for arraying sugars covalently via phosphonate formation with controlled density and spatial distance. To evaluate this array system, a mannose derivative of \u03b1-5-pentylphosphonic acid was used as a model for the optimization of covalent arraying based on the fluorescence response of the surface mannose interacting with concanavalin A (ConA) tagged with the fluorescence probe A488. The ACG slide was characterized using scanning electron microscopy, atomic force microscopy (AFM), and ellipsometry, and the sugar loading capacity, uniformity, and structural conformation were also characterized using AFM, a GenePix scanner, and a confocal microscope. This study has demonstrated that the glycan array prepared from the ACG slide is more homogeneous with better spatial control compared with the commonly used glycan array prepared from the N-hydroxysuccinimide-activated glass slide.",

            "text": "Glycan microarrays have been used as an effective tool for the high-throughput analysis of protein\u2212glycan interactions and are thus useful for disease diagnosis, drug discovery, and vaccine development. 1\u221228 Numerous surfaces have been made available for glycan arraying, including (a) noncovalent adsorption of sugar derivatives to the surface of a porous nitrocellulose membrane; [1] [2] [3] [4] 7, 9, 10, 17, 22, 23, 26 metal oxide surface; 5 microtiter plate; fabricated plastics of polystyrene, polypropylene, or polycarbonate; and polyfluorohydrocarbon-linked aluminum oxide-coated glass (ACG) slides 21 and (b) covalent attachment to a gold surface or alkenthiol-activated gold surface, 6, [9] [10] [11] 22 epoxy-activated glass slide, 6, 18, 19, 22, 25 N-hydroxysuccinimide (NHS)-activated glass slide, [8] [9] [10] 14, 20, 22, 24, 25 and ACG slide. 15, 21 The glycan array on ACG slides developed in our laboratory 15, 21 was prepared by spotting glycan\u2212phosphonic acids onto the surface of the ACG slides, 29\u221231 and the properties of the arrays were characterized using both mass spectrometry and fluorescence scanning microscopy. 15, 21 The fluorescence intensity of sugar\u2212protein interaction on the ACG slide was found to be more sensitive and homogeneous with higher glycan density than that on the NHS-activated glass slides. 14, 15 We have further used the ACG slides to prepare a mixed-glycan array for the study of broadly neutralizing monoclonal antibodies isolated from HIV patients and found that some of the antibodies recognized two different glycans simultaneously; a new observation that was not detected previously by the use of NHS-activated glass slides. 28 In addition, the ACG slide surface can be used for noncovalent hydrophobic adherence of glycans with a fluorohydrocarbon tail for the identification and study of enzyme activity analyzed using MALDI mass spectrometry. 16, 21 Despite all of these studies, the fabrication method for the preparation of ACG slides has not been clearly defined. In our previous study, the anodized aluminum oxide (AAO) surface had properties and functions similar to those of the native aluminum oxide (NAO) surface. 16 Different vapor deposition polymerization (VDP) techniques have resulted in various degrees of surface roughness. Even the surface morphology of the ACG slides appeared different from that of aluminum objects that have been widely used in industry. 29,32\u221238 Previous surface treatment of aluminum objects involved mostly indepth anodization for the control of pore sizes but not for the preparation of glycan microarrays. On the basis of our experience, the AAO surface to be used in glycan microarrays should have the following properties: (1) The aluminum oxide (Al-oxide) layer should be smooth enough for the covalent coupling reaction with sugar derivatives of phosphonic acid. 29, 30 (2) The thickness of the Al-oxide layer on the surface should be adjusted to provide optimal fluorescence intensity for the detection of the protein\u2212sugar interaction. In this study, we use the glass slide with electron-beam (E-beam)-coated aluminum to produce ACG slides with various thicknesses under various anodization conditions and then study their effect on the fluorescence intensity in sugar\u2212protein interactions. Mannose with an \u03b1-5-pentylphosphonic acid tail was used as a model compound for covalent attachment to the Al-oxide layer, and the fluorescence intensity of Alexa Fluor-488-tagged ConA (ConA-A488) that interacts with the covalently bound sugar was used to evaluate and optimize the system. Computer software was used to design experiments to fabricate the surface with various thicknesses and roughness of the AAO layer for the study. Data analysis of the result was conducted mathematically and used for the development of optimized conditions for the preparation of ACG slides. ",

Therefore, an ideal glycan array is one that best mimics the glycans that are found on living cell surfaces. For example, the density and spatial distribution of Globo-H on malignant cells and their stem cells of breast cancer patients progressively increase. To identify the patients who would benefit from vaccination with the Globo-H vaccine, 39 to study the disease progression, and to monitor the antibody response to the vaccine in vitro, it would be useful if the glycan arrays were able to mimic the changes on the cell surface at different stages of the disease. However, there is no such glycan array available to date as the cell surface is a dynamic and heterogeneous system with variations in substrates on the surface, and as such the development of a glycan array to mimic the real cell surface remains a major challenge. Nevertheless, the preparation of a surface for glycan array in a controllable and reproducible manner with regard to the distribution, density, and spatial orientation of glycans is important to address some fundamental questions such as the avidity of weak binding and multivalent heteroligand interaction. The glycan array on ACG slides has been shown to meet these needs.",

These VDP screening studies included (1) Al-oxide of 50 nm thickness produced using atomic layer deposition onto the Al-coated (with e-beam evaporation) glass slide; (2) Al-oxide of 2 nm thickness obtained from direct oxygen plasma treatment on a 300 nm thick aluminum (with e-beam evaporation) coated on glass slides; and (3) Al-oxide of 36 nm thickness produced using magnetron sputtering on the Alcoated (with magnetron sputtering), the nickel-coated (with ebeam evaporation), or the chromium-coated (with e-beam evaporation) glass slides. All of these substrates were examined using the GenePix fluorescent scanner. The original purpose of screening diversified methods was to create different Al-oxide microstructures on the surface to identify an optimal way to enhance the signal. However, the best fluorescence intensity produced from these slides was the AAO grown on glass slides. Without further investigation of the VDP techniques, we then focused on the use of E-beam evaporation with argon plasma to coat a layer of pure aluminum on the glass slide followed by acid anodization of the aluminum surface. Our pervious study 15 showed that the slide surface roughness with rms (root mean square) < 18 nm can be used for microarray printing. Schott's glass slides provided a smooth surface (rms 0.33\u22120.42 nm scanned using AFM over 10 \u00d7 10 \u03bcm 2 area) for aluminum coating. The Al-coated glass slides produced in this way have a smooth surface with a rms of 0.75 nm (for 100 nm) and 2.33 Table S5 .

We believe that during the electrochemical surface anodization, the electropolishing process 42\u221244 occurred simultaneously to remove the convex, sharp, and rough materials from the surface. Therefore, a thin layer of AAO with surface roughness similar to glass can be prepared under the optimized surface anodization reaction condition.

Visually, we can see that the substrate fabricated from the 100 nm Al-coated glass slide was semitransparent. Therefore, Alcoated glass slides with 300 nm of aluminum have been used in all surface anodization experiments. As can be seen in the cross section image in Figure 2B , part of the aluminum has been converted into Al-oxide. The final Al thickness was greater than 200 nm, and the substrate was nontransparent. Figure 3 shows a molecular model of mannose/ConA-A488 binding. Mannose with an \u03b1-5-pentylphosphonic acid tail was covalently bound to the surface of the ACG slide. The ConA-A488 (c11252 from Invitrogen) was bound specifically to the immobilized mannose. Con A is a lectin tetramer with a subunit dimension of 42 \u00d7 40 \u00d7 39 \u00c5 3 , and each subunit has a mannose binding site. 45, 46 Geometrically, only two binding sites per tetramer are available for mannose binding. The most effective mannose/ConA-A488 binding produces the strongest fluorescence intensity, and we have been using the fluorescence intensity of mannose/ConA-A488 binding to tailor-make the Al-oxide surface for the glycan microarray. 15 Designed experiments were used to optimize the preparation of ACG slides for glycan microarray.",

The surface roughness of the starting glass base material (with rms 0.33\u22120.42 nm and 0.47\u22123.89 nm for the glasses obtained from Schott and Arrayit, respectively) affected the final rms (2.31 vs 4.56 nm) but not the thickness of the AAO layer.

There were no pores created during surface anodization for the formation of Al-oxide. Because the thickness of the coated aluminum layer was only 300 nm, in 15 min of reaction time, all Al-oxide/aluminum layers were dissolved and only the clear transparent glass slide remained. Surface roughness of the AAO layer fabricated within the experimental conditions ranged from 2.85 to 9.07 nm, as indicated in Figure S1A,C(b) , all within the \"capable region\" (<18 nm) for glycan microarrays. At constant low reaction temperature (4\u00b0C), the reaction time had a minor effect on the thickness growth of the AAO layer, as indicated by the response measurement shown in Figure 4C . However, an optimized surface of the ACG slide (with rms at around 2 nm) was fabricated under the combined conditions of voltage and reaction time at 4\u00b0C. Therefore, we proposed the AAO growth on the Al-coated glass slide into two regions: (1) the \"major AAO growth\" (fast thickness increasing) region and (2) the \"electropolishing (surface smoothing) growth\" region, as presented in Figure 6A ). Figure 6B shows the comparison of fluorescence intensity of mannose/ConA-A488 binding on ACG slides no. 5 from the RSM (response surface measurement) experiments vs the conventional NHS-activated glass slide. The ACG slide gave higher fluorescence intensity than the NHS glass slide resulting from the fluorescence tagged ConA binding to mannose on the surface. The differences in these two types of slides (ACG slide vs NHS glass slide) have been investigated further.",

Particle counts were obtained by counting the number of particles above the height of one half width of the particle height distribution. Mannose derivatives can be covalently bound to the surface only where the activated (either Al-oxide or NHS) functional groups are available. The ACG slide provides a surface of more uniformly distributed reactive sites for covalent reaction than that of the NHS glass slide. Particle height changes on the slide surfaces are summarized and given in Table S6 . Higher rms indicated higher surface roughness of the ACG slide than that of the NHS-activated slide. The mean height varied before and after sugar grafting and protein binding is an indication of conformational change. Along this concept, as mannose was covalently bound on the slide surface, the mean, minimum, and maximum particle height on the ACG slide were higher than those on the NHS slide, suggesting that the mannose derivative existed in a more extended structural conformation perpendicular to the slide surfaces, as shown in Scheme 1. Figure 8A ,B shows the GenePix scanning images (at PMT 380) of ConA-A488 bound to mannose (1 mM) arrayed on the ACG slide versus the NHS-activated glass slide. As can be seen, the Al-oxide surface has a higher sugar loading capacity such that the array spots are reaching saturation even at the very low value of photomultiplier tubes (PMT) of 380. The fluorescence intensities of the averaged 20 spots for the ACG slide and NHS slide are given in Figure 8C . The GenePix scanner has a resolution up to 5 \u03bcm (25 \u03bcm 2 per 1 pixel), and the dimension of the arrayed spots ranges from 60 to 250 \u03bcm in diameter with corresponding 110\u22121960 pixels, respectively. This has made it possible for us to access the uniformity/distribution of covalently bound sugars within an array spot. Figure 8D shows the analysis of spot 1\u22125 (the first row and the fifth spot counting from the right) of ACG versus NHS slides as shown in Figure 8A ,B. The result from the GenePix scanner recorded the spot dimension (Dia.), average fluorescence intensity per pixel (F488 Mean) with standard deviation (F488 SD), total fluorescence intensity of the spot (F488 total intensity), percentage saturation (F488% sat.), and coefficient of variation within the spot (F488 CV) are tabulated in Figure 8D . Even though the individual pixel intensity cannot be resolved visually with the naked eye, the coefficient of variation of pixel intensities (F488 CV) of 17 versus 65 indicates that the ConA-A488/mannose distribution within a specific array spot on the ACG slide is more uniform than that on the NHS glass slide.",

The fabrication of AAO layer has been considered in two regions: (1) the \"major fast AAO growth\" region and (2) the \"electropolishing growth\" region. At constant temperature, the combined effects on voltage and reaction time are related to the thickness of AAO growth. Using the Con A/mannose binding system, the sugar loading capacity and uniformity/distribution of the reactive site for sugar attachment to the ACG slide have been compared with those of the NHS-activated glass slide. The ACG slide has a surface that is more stable, higher loading capacity, and more uniformly distributed reactive site for sugar arraying through covalent phosphonate formation. This array system is more convenient to prepare and should be useful for the study of multivalent interaction and heteroligand binding in addition to the traditional use in the study of protein\u2212sugar interaction. 3 . The thickness of the coated aluminum layer was fixed at 100 and 300 nm. After being coated with pure aluminum, the slides were packed immediately (one slide per container under the nitrogen atmosphere), vacuum-sealed with an air-tight laminated foil, free from exposure to oxygen to prevent the formation of NAO, and kept sealed until the electrochemical reaction for surface anodization. The thickness, surface roughness, and particle counts of the AAO layer were analyzed using nondestructive ellipsometry (SOPRA ES4G) and AFM (Veeco di Dimension 3100 SPM), and the surface morphology and cross section view were examined using SEM (FE-4300).",
