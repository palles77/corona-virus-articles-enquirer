The development of a vaccine to prevent SARS should be pursued with the same urgency and cooperative spirit, as SARS is highly lethal and, if not controlled during the first few generations of transmission, is likely to become endemic in regions of the world where health-care infrastructure is underdeveloped and epidemiological control measures are weak. The scientific community already learned many important lessons from HIV vaccine development; these should be heeded. For example, consideration should be given to the development of a vaccine that will protect across regional strains of SARS, as the newly emergent coronavirus SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV) is proving to be variable and may be mutating in response to immune pressure. SARS-specific research reagents should also be collected and shared. These would include SARS peptides, adjuvants, DNA vaccine vectors and clinical grade viral vectors. Rapidly developing a collaborative approach to developing a SARS vaccine that will be both effective and safe is the only way to go. This article reviews parallels between HIV and SARS and proposes an approach that would accelerate the development of a SARS vaccine.",

As a result of this groundbreaking international collaboration we now know that the SARS epidemic is due to a human coronavirus (HCoV) infection, now named SARS-coronavirus (SARS-CoV). Several SARS-coronavirus genomes have been mapped and the functions of at least some of the proteins have been determined [1, 2] . These genomes are now available on GenBank, making it possible for laboratories around the world to begin the process of building a safe and effective SARS vaccine.",

SARS, like HIV, is a RNA virus whose replication is error-prone. Studies of 14 separate SARS strains that emerged from a single point source suggest a pattern of evolution in response to immune pressure that is much like the evolution of HIV. Some forms of coronavirus-murine hepatitis virus in particular-are known to mutate to escape from host immune response. Will clades and strains of SARS emerge as they have for HIV? If so, will SARS vaccine researchers be able to develop a vaccine that adequately addresses this problem? HIV vaccine developers were slow to address HIV variability; scientists involved in the SARS vaccine effort must address this issue more promptly.",

            "text": "More important, the HIV vaccine development effort initially focused on replicating the approach that had been used to develop Hepatitis B vaccine development, which was to clone and express the surface protein of the virus. This simplistic approach to a complex virus was recently proven to be a failure [3] . Will scientists once again pursue \"quick and easy solutions\" in the hopes of stimulating a protective antibody response despite existing evidence that coronavirus vaccines (for animals) based on the S or spike surface protein have largely been ineffective? In order to best define an effective SARS vaccine approach, it is important to consider the correlates of protection from coronaviruses in animal models and any evidence for immunity that may be emerging from clinical experience. Little is known, as yet, about the human immune response to SARS-CoV but much can be learned from examining the immunology of other coronaviruses and the history of coronavirus vaccines. We must also examine the host-pathogen interaction and ask whether specific antigens (proteins derived from the pathogen) or host responses, such as antibodies and T cell response, provide any insight into the type of vaccine that should be developed. SARS, like HIV, has the potential to set off a global pandemic. In this article, we argue that there is much to be learned from the past-both in terms of building a cooperative approach in order to expedite the development of an effective vaccine and in terms of the scientific knowledge that has emerged as a result of this collaborative process [4] . There is no better time to begin working on a new SARS vaccine than now. It is imperative to capture this moment, when the virus is relatively new, before clades and strains of this highly virulent airborne virus emerge.",

While reinfection in the case of common-cold coronavirus HCoV-229E implies either that immunity is incomplete or that antigenic variation impedes the development of immunity, the low rate of reinfection (based on available data) that has been observed with SARS and the high rate of recovery from acute illness in the absence of effective medical therapy (approximately 80% of young adults do recover) suggest that protection from disease is achievable.

Persistent infection in the case of MHV seems to be due to CTL escape (mutations in the viral genomes that abrogate the ability of the cellular immune system to stimulate CTL response). Mutation occurs, even in the MHV spike protein, in response pressure from cell-mediated immune response [13] . Escape from CTL response may allow MHV to persist in the CNS [8, 9, 36] . The MHV-specific CTL response is polyclonal, but CTL escape occurs nonetheless [37, 38] .",
