Methods: We conducted a multi-stage sampling, cross-sectional survey using self-administered anonymous questionnaires from May to June, in 2014. The main outcome variable was residents' willingness to accept a future H7N9 vaccine. Logistic regression was used to identify the predictors of vaccination willingness. Results: Of the 7264 eligible participants, 14.5% of Beijing residents reported that they had not heard of H7N9. Among those who had heard of H7N9, 59.5% of the general adult population would be willing to accept a future H7N9 vaccine, and approximately half of them reported 'I am afraid of being infected by H7N9' and 'H7N9 vaccine can prevent infections', and 28.1% reported 'my daily life is affected by H7N9'. The variables that were significantly associated with a higher likelihood of reporting willingness were being younger adults (aged 18-29 years: OR = 1.52, 95% CI: 1.17-1.97; aged 30-39 years: OR = 1.39, 95% CI: 1.08-1.78), being farmers (OR = 1.61; 95% CI: 1.32-1.96), being unemployed people (OR = 1.36; 95% CI: 1.04-1.78), living in suburban areas (OR = 2.18; 95% CI: 1.89-2.51), having !2 children in the family (OR = 1.41; 95% CI: 1.03-1.92), perceived risk in China (OR = 1.30; 95% CI: 1.15-1.48), perceived susceptibility to disease (OR = 3.13; 95% CI: 2.73-3.58), perceived negative effect on daily life (OR = 1.32; 95% CI: 1.13-1.55), perceived effectiveness of vaccination (OR = 2.34; 95% CI: 2.07-2.64), and recent uptake of influenza vaccine (OR = 2.26; 95% CI: 1.92-2.66). Conclusions: A great number of Beijing residents had doubts about the vaccine's effectiveness and were not concerned about disease risk, which were the factors affecting willingness to be vaccinated. Targeted education programs on disease risk as well as vaccine's effectiveness are needed to improve the willingness of vaccination for potential H7N9 pandemic preparedness.",

During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, pandemic influenza vaccination was first provided to priority populations (e.g., older adults, public servants in key positions, students, teachers and people with chronic diseases) and then other persons in Beijing, and it was proven to be an effective strategy in controlling epidemics [11] . Our previous study showed the vaccination coverage rate was relatively low within the general adult population of Beijing, and the perceptions of not expecting to contract influenza was the predominant barrier to influenza vaccination [12] . Although Beijing has only reported 37 laboratory-confirmed cases of influenza A (H7N9) and 11 deaths as of August 2017, a potential threat of H7N9 pandemic has always been in Beijing. Therefore, preventive measures, including pandemic vaccination policy, should be prepared for possible H7N9 pandemic. Understanding the willingness to accept a future H7N9 vaccine and its main related factors may enable policy makers to take measures for future vaccination coverage improvement. Although several surveys have been conducted in Southern China [13] [14] [15] , only one of these studied a general population while the other two focused on food producers or live poultry traders. Considering the diverse epidemic strength [16] , income levels and healthcare access across China, public willingness to accept a future H7N9 vaccine may vary by region. In the present study, we conducted a large population-based cross-sectional survey to estimate residents' willingness to accept a future H7N9 vaccine and to identify its associated possible factors in the general adult population of Beijing at the end of the second epidemic wave.",

Because the family size of Beijing residents was ranged from 2 to 3, approximately 16 to 24 households were randomly selected for interview. Before visiting a household, they made an appointment with the family. If all the residents in a household were not available for the first visit, re-visits would be made to the household. During the interviews, participants were asked to complete the questionnaire by themselves or with the help of interviewers if they had difficulty with reading or writing.",

Weighted analysis was conducted to calculate the standardized proportion of people who would be willing to accept a future H7N9 vaccine, accounting for age and living area (urban or suburban) in Beijing population, as reported in the 2010 Census of Beijing [17] . Descriptive analyses were initially performed to generate frequency distributions of the survey variables. Differences among the subgroups were tested by Pearson's Chi-square test. Logistic regression models were then performed to examine the factors associated with residents' willingness to accept a future H7N9 vaccine. Demographic characteristics of participants and residents' perceptions regarding H7N9 were included as the independent variables. Adjusted odds ratios with 95% confidence intervals (95% CI) for the variables were calculated. All the statistical tests were two-sided, with p value <0.05 considered to be statistically significant. All the statistical analyses were carried out using SPSS Version 20.0 (IBM Corporation, New York, United States). Fig. 1 shows the framework for sample selection. In total, 7264 of the 7369 participants that we approached completed the survey, yielding a response rate of 98.6%. Of the 7264 eligible participants, 1054 (14.5%) participants who had not heard of H7N9 were excluded from the analysis of willingness to accept H7N9 vaccine. Finally, a total of 6210 participants who had heard of H7N9 were included in the further analysis of willingness to be vaccinated.",

In this cross-sectional study, we found that a large proportion (14.5%) of Beijing residents had not even heard of H7N9 at the end of the second epidemic wave. Unlike the unforgettable experience of SARS in 2003, the emergence of H7N9 had Note: ''Missing\" indicates the number of respondents who did not answer this question. a Other employees: factory workers, government employees, and employees from business and service industry. Note: Missing referred to ''how many people did not answer this question\". not caused public panic yet; a previous study also showed this result [22] . In addition, a study in China showed that the experience of H1N1 pandemic in 2009 did not also result huge in society [23] . This may be explained by the great progress in the mechanism for emergency responses to emerging infectious diseases after the SARS outbreak in China. The current mechanism allowed China to successfully deal with the subsequent H1N1 pandemic and H7N9 epidemics [24] . In a public health emergency, pandemic vaccination remains one of the most effective strategies in controlling epidemics, but promoting the vaccination uptake can be a difficult challenge for local governments [6] . In this study, 59.5% of the general adult population who had heard of H7N9 would like to accept H7N9 vacci-nation in the future. Our estimate was comparable to that of Hong Kong during the epidemic of H7N9 (50.5%) [13] . However, previous studies have shown that residents' willingness of future H7N9 influenza vaccine uptake varied across different regions and sub-populations: 50.5% among the general population of Hong Kong, 84% among the employees of food production of Guangzhou and 42.2% among live poultry traders of Guangzhou, a city located in Southern China [13] [14] [15] . Our estimate during the epidemic of H7N9 was also consistent with some findings from a systematic review during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [25] (56.1% in the United Kingdom [26] , 64% in the United States [27] and 54.7% in Australia [28] ). Moreover, the systematic review found that there was a lot of variation (8.7-67%) in respondents' willingness to accept Table 3 Logistic regression analysis for the factors associated with residents' willingness of influenza A (H7N9) vaccine uptake in Beijing, China.",

Factors thought to contribute to willingness to receive the H1N1 pandemic vaccine included personal risk perception, vaccination attitude, communications and information sources, access and demographic variables [25] . The present study only estimated the willingness to be vaccinated, but not actual vaccination. Most estimates of vaccination intention tend to be much greater than actual vaccine coverage estimates during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [29] . Although the Beijing government launched mass vaccination campaigns during the second wave of the pandemic, the influenza vaccination coverage rates were relatively low (21.8%) and did not increased significantly during the 2009 H1N1 pandemic [12] . For the above reasons, we can infer that the actual coverage of H7N9 vaccination will be much lower than our estimate of 59.5% in emergency mass-vaccination campaigns during an emergency.",

First, as a crosssectional study using a self-administered questionnaire, selfreported data may have introduced information bias in data collection. Second, the current study did not include 'I do not know' option, which could also lead to information bias. Nevertheless, a large proportion of the participants who had not heard of H7N9 and thus more likely to report 'I do not know' option were not included in the analysis of willingness to accept a future H7N9 vaccine. In addition, during the survey, very few participants asked the interviewers whether there was an 'I do not know' option. Thus, we believed that the participants who might otherwise have chosen 'I do not know' accounted for only a small proportion, if any, of the total participants. Third, because the households but not individuals were selected at random in this study, the statistical effect of this further clustering would be to increase design effect and result in inappropriately narrow confidence intervals. Fourth, the rates for uptake willingness may differ from season to season because of changing conditions such as mortality rates and epidemic strength, which suggests the need for continued monitoring in Beijing. Finally, the findings of this study are representative at the level of Beijing, perhaps Northern China, but considering the diverse epidemic strength, income levels and healthcare access across regions, our observations might not be generalized well to other countries or regions.",

Among those who had heard of H7N9, 59.5% of the general adult population would be willing to accept a future H7N9 vaccine in the future, and a large proportion of them had doubts about the vaccine's effectiveness and were not concerned about disease risk, which were the factors affecting residents' willingness to accept H7N9 vaccination. Therefore, health education programs targeted at increasing public perceptions towards disease risk and vaccine's effectiveness are warranted to improve the willingness of vaccination for potential H7N9 pandemic preparedness.",
