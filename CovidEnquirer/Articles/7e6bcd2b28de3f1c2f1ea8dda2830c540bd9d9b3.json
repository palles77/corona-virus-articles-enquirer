Earlier references to ferrets are probably the basis of the belief that ferrets originated in North Africa (Thomson, 1951) . Evidently they were bred specifically for rabbiting (rabbit hunting) and were muzzled before being sent into rabbit burrows. This practice was later introduced into Europe, Asia, and the British Isles, where the sport is still practiced today.",

Commercial farms have been raising ferrets for almost 50 years. Biomedical researchers in the United States can request animals of a specific sex, weight, and age for individual experiments. Investigators in other countries may acquire ferrets from fur operations or may make arrangements with commercial vendors in the United States. Even though the ferret is nonstandardized with regard to exact genotype and pedigree, its routine availability in a clinically healthy state has aided immeasurably its acceptance as a research animal. Readily available commercial stocks, based on coat color, are albino, sable (or fitch), Siamese, silver mitt, and Siamese-silver mitt (Siamese with white chest and feet) (McLain et al., 1985) . The fitch or so-called wild coat color is the most common, recognized by yellow-buff fur with patches of black or dark brown, particularly on the tail and limbs (Andrews and Illman, 1987) . The production of ferrets by large commercial operations has raised concern by some that inbreeding of these animals has made the ferret more susceptible to diseases, e.g., endocrine-related disorders. Anecdodally, it has been suggested that 75% of US ferrets with a blaze or white head can suffer from the Waardenburg syndrome and are deaf (J. Mayer, personal observation). The only study providing a physiologic basis for auditory impairment describes a reduction in the ipsilateral projections of the cochlear nucleus to the auditory midbrain in albino ferrets (Moore and Kowalchuk, 1988) . Albino ferrets also have impaired motion perception and contrast sensitivity (Hoffmann et al., 2004; Price and Morgan, 1987; Akerman et al., 2003; Hupfeld et al., 2006) .",

An absorbable paper liner may be used in the pan beneath the cage to facilitate daily disposal of urine and feces. In a research setting, the plastic caging should be washed weekly to avoid excessive soiling. Use of one or two additional pieces of cage board or similar substance within the cage also helps maintain cleanliness, and ferrets enjoy burrowing beneath and between the sheets of paper. The spacing of grid walls should be 1.0 \u00d7 0.5 inches apart, or 0.25 inch if using wire mesh. Ferrets like to lick and bite at their enclosures, so sharp edges and galvanized metal should be avoided. Fractured teeth are often a consequence if this behavior is not corrected. Zinc toxicosis has been reported from licking galvanized bars from which metals had leached during steam sterilization (Straube and Walden, 1981) (Table 14 .1) Ferrets can be trained to use a litter box because they repeatedly urinate or defecate in one corner of the cage. Clay litters have been reported to cause chronic upper respiratory irritation from inhaled dust (Jenkins and Brown, 1993) . Ferrets prefer sleeping in a soft isolated area, and in a research facility this can be accomplished by providing a washable 'snooze tube' or hammock (Fox, 1998c) . Environmental enrichment is now commonly used in order to prevent boredom or misplaced reactions towards cagemates. Some studies suggest that the lack of environmental stumuli has potentially wide-ranging effects on the overall wellbeing of ferrets. Chivers and Einon (1982) found that some of the isolation-induced effects on behavior seen in rats also occurred in ferrets, with deprivation of rough and tumble social play causing hyperactivity that persisted into adulthood. Socially reared ferrets whose environment was enriched with a series of changing tube systems (Weiss-Buerger, 1981) were superior in maze learning and reversal. Korhonen (1995) demonstrated that optimal health occurred when ferrets were provided with increased floor space and compatible cagemates and when offered balls and bite cups with which to play. Russell (1990) found that ferrets raised in enriched conditions would choose the arm of a maze leading to the more prey-like of two play objects and were superior in capturing prey-models. These forms of enrichment are easy to implement and carry a minimal risk of injury to the animal. Examples of enrichment ideas include making tunnels from PCV pipe or dryer hose, and filling a box with rice, plastic balls, or crumpled paper balls, in order to let the ferrets fulfill their instinctive digging behaviors. All these items can easily be sterilized or exchanged between uses. Care must be taken that the enrichment items are not ingested by the ferret. Foreign body ingestion in ferrets is usually a true medical emergency.",

The tracheal size and laryngeal anatomy make endotracheal intubation somewhat challenging, and as a result the ferret has been advocated as a species suitable for use in pediatric intubation training (Powell et al., 1991) . The lungs are relatively large, and the total lung capacity is nearly three-times that which would be predicted based on body size, as compared with other mammals. This characteristic, together with a higher degree of bronchiolar branching and more extensive bronchial submucosal glands (as compared with the dog), makes the ferret an attractive model for pulmonary research studies (Vinegar et al., 1985) . Although a previous report (Willis and Barrow, 1971) commented that the carotid arterial branching pattern in the ferret is unusual, it is actually typical for a carnivore. As is the case in the dog and the cat, the paired common carotid arteries arise from the brachiocephalic trunk (sometimes called the innominate artery) at the level of the thoracic inlet (Andrews et al., 1979b) .",

Ferrets, especially intact males and estrous jills, may possess a distinctive musky odor even after a successful descenting, because of normal sebaceous secretions. Ferrets lack well-developed sweat glands for use in thermal regulation, and as a result they are predisposed to heat prostration when ambient temperatures reach 32\u00b0C (90\u00b0F) (Ryland et al., 1983) .",

The adult weight of nonobese male and female ferrets that have been gonadectomized prior to weaning and raised in captivity will generally fall between 0.8 and 1.2 kg (Brown, 1997a) . Adult animals (especially those that are sexually intact) may be subject to seasonal fluctuations in body fat percentage, which can cause body weight to fluctuate by 30-40% (Fox and Bell, 1998) . The approximate life span for the ferret is 6-8 years, but on rare occasions they may live as long as 11 years ( et al., 1979; Lee et al., 1982; Fox, 1998e) . These values are not greatly dissimilar from those of other domestic carnivores.

            "text": "Ferret diets have been formulated both empirically and based upon the nutrient requirements of other mustelids (Fox and McLain, 1998) . Specific requirements for various life-cycle stages have not been determined experimentally. Available commercial diets are certainly capable of supporting growth, reproduction, and maintenance (Loeb and Quimby, 1999) . (continued) in conventional settings. In recent years speciality diets designed for ferrets have entered the commercial market. Some of these diets contain extremely high crude LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE protein contents (up to ~50%) and low charbohydrate values (<10%) in order to try to mimic a more natural composition of a whole-prey diet. Other speciality foods are considered hypoallergenic as they are made with turkey, venison, and lamb, and contain no chicken. In the absence of careful analysis, however, it is uncertain whether the proportion and quantity of ingredients in these diets is optimal or even beneficial. Ferrets are strict carnivores with a high requirement for dietary fat and protein. Their short digestive tract and rapid gastrointestinal transit time require protein to be readily digestible. There is general agreement that ferrets should not be given diets high in complex carbohydrates or fiber. Diets that are high in fish products are also not recommended for ferrets (Fox and McLain, 1998) . The use of any raw chicken, beef, or other meats is strongly discouraged because of the potential contamination by Campylobacter, Salmonella, Listeria, Mycobacterium, and Streptococcus (Fox, 1998a) . The daily maintenance energy requirement of the ferret is estimated to be 0.5 MJ metabolizable energy (ME)/kg metabolic body weight (BW 0.75 ; Kamphues et al., 1999) . The requirement may reach multiples of the above value during growth, pregnancy and lactation (Bell, 1996) .",

A ratio of 13 and a caloric density of 550 kcal/100 g of feed, corresponding to 42% protein, provided optimum growth for male kits up to 16 weeks. After 16 weeks, ratios of 17 and 21, corresponding to 36% and 26% protein, respectively, were recommended. Diets containing 9-28% fat and 22-42% carbohydrate have been used successfully to maintain ferrets. One author recommends 30-40% protein and 18-20% fat for adult, nonbreeding animals and a minimum of 35% protein and 25% fat for reproductively active animals and those that have not reached sexual maturity (Brown, 1997a) . The long-term impact of diets containing high levels of fat and protein are unknown. A recent study demonstrates that the digestibility of crude protein in ferrets is significantly lower than in cats while the digestibility of crude fat is significantly higher (Fekete et al., 2005) . The study concludes that the ferret cannot be used as a model animal for cats with respect to either feed preference or nutrient digestibility and care must be taken when extrapolating data obtained from feline research to the ferret.",

Ferrets, like humans, convert \u03b2-carotene to vitamin A in the gut and absorb \u03b2-carotene intact (Fox and McLain, 1998) . In intestinal perfusion experiments in ferrets, it was demonstrated that \u03b2-carotene, retinol, and retinyl esters are absorbed intact into lymph and that cleavage products, including \u03b2-apo-12\u2032-carotenal, \u03b2-apo-10\u2032-carotenal, and retinoids, accumulate in the intestinal mucosa (Wang et al., 1992) . The intestinal mucosa is capable of converting \u03b2-carotene into retinoic acid and other polar metabolites, which are then transported via the portal vein to the liver (Wang et al., 1993) . \u03b2-Carotene absorption is enhanced by coperfusion with \u03b1-tocopherol, and the perfusion of the latter is unaltered by the presence of \u03b2-carotene. The conversion of \u03b2-carotene into retinol is also enhanced by the presence of \u03b1-tocopherol (Wang et al., 1995) . Studies have shown that ferrets have the capacity to excrete retinol and retinyl esters in the urine. This response seems dependent on oral vitamin A supplementation (Raila et al., 2002) . Based on the various studies available, it can be concluded that the ferret can be used as a model to investigate aspects of beta-carotene metabolism as well as aspects of the metabolism of vitamin A such as absorption in the gut, regulation of incorporation of retinyl esters into lipoproteins in the liver, and renal uptake and regulated urinary excretion of vitamin A. A lung cancer model of ferrets exposed to tobacco smoke has been used to evaluate the cancer-modulating properties of these micronutrients (Kim et al., 2006a (Kim et al., , b, 2012 .",

The season under natural illumination in the Northern Hemisphere is from March to August for females and from December to July for males, corresponding temporally to increasing day length. Ferrets born in the late spring or early summer and maintained under natural lighting will not assume an adult pattern of gonadal activity (i.e., puberty) until the following season (Baum, 1998) . Under artificial illumination, jills that are maintained at 8 h light-16 h dark reach puberty at 10-12 months. Stimulatory photoperiods may be used, however, in the laboratory or intensive production setting, as a method of breeding ferrets out of the natural season. However, the transfer from short to long photoperiods should not occur prior to 90 days of age, because jills that are prematurely transferred will remain anestrous (Hammond and Chesterman, 1972) . Management practices in one breeding facility are such that jills commence breeding at 7-10 months, average 3.7 litters a year, and are cycled out of reproduction after six litters. In another strategy, ferrets are exposed to a 16:8 h photoperiod at 12 weeks of age, are bred at 16 weeks during their first estrus, and whelp at 5\u00bd months.",

The ease with which estrus is detected in the ferret, as well as the size of the ferret and ease of its maintenance in captivity have made the ferret a model for study of neuroendocrine events and their gonadal correlates. Along with the hamster, the ferret has contributed extensively to an understanding of the photoperiodic influences on the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis (Baum, 1998) . As in females of other species, estradiol concentrations are responsible for controlling the development of the female reproductive tract and secondary sexual characteristics, and the tonic inhibition of luteinizing hormone (LH) secretion by the anterior pituitary during both prepubertal life and anestrus. The sensitivity of the hypothalamic gonadostat to negative feedback inhibition by estradiol changes at the time of puberty, and under the influence of increasing light exposure, LH levels rise despite estradiol (Ryan, 1984) . Similarly, age differences in the sensitivity of negative feedback inhibition of the hypothalamic secretion of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) by testosterone, or to estrogenic compounds derived from the aromatization of testosterone, appear to be essential in determining puberty and seasonality of reproduction in the male (Baum, 1998) .",

Changes in vaginal cytology have also been described for the ferret and other mustelid species, but these changes are seldom used to determine onset of estrus or to schedule breeding (Williams et al., 1992) . After a 2-to 3-week proestrus, estrus occurs. Estrus onset is not associated with elevated serum FSH in the ferret, as it is in the rodent. Once estrus has occurred, it may terminate in coitus-induced ovulation and pregnancy, pseudopregnancy after infertile mating, pharmacologic termination (by injection of human chorionic gonadotropin [hCG], GnRH or GnRH analogs), death due to estrogen-induced aplastic anemia, or spontaneous remission and anestrus due to reduced photoperiod. Waves of follicular development occur in estrus, and five to 13 ova are ovulated approximately 30-40 h after coitus. Female ferrets are brought to the male approximately 14 days after vulvar enlargement. Females and males copulate many times and for prolonged periods of time; they are typically left together for 2 days. Both intromission and neck restraint by the Fox and Bell (1998 LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE male are apparently required for induction of ovulation (Baum, 1998 ). An LH surge accompanies coitus in females, but the same is not true of males (Carroll et al., 1987) . Implantation occurs 12 days after mating; both a functional corpus luteum and the anterior pituitary are required for implantation and maintenance of pregnancy. Placentation is typical of carnivores and is zonary and endotheliochorial (Morrow, 1980) . Pregnancy may be detected by ultrasonographic demonstration of 3-to 5-mm discrete nonechogenic structures as early as day 12 (Peter et al., 1990) , by palpation as early as day 14, or by radiographic demonstration of calcified fetal skeletons at approximately 30 days of gestation.",

When rabbit cages are used for housing, nest boxes may take the form of polypropylene rat cages or other plastic boxes (cat litter box or dish pan). Nest boxes should have bedding provided for warmth and comfort. Materials suitable for bedding include pieces of fabric (towels), ripped cageboard, shredded paper, or cotton batting. The nest box should be at least 6 inches deep and should prevent the kits from wandering from the jill. Entrance to the nest box should be smooth, to avoid injury to the teats and mammary gland. At our institution, jills are provided a stainless steel rectangular box with a smooth-surfaced plastic entrance (Fig. 14.1). A retractable steel roof panel and a guillotine side panel exposing a Plexiglas sidewall allow access to the jill and permit observation with minimal disturbance. One major supplier of ferrets uses sunken tubs filled with bedding to promote a sense of security and isolation of the jill. Most jills will leave the nest box to eat and drink. If the jill will not leave, however, low-sided food bowls should be placed within the nest box. Adequate nutritional care for the pregnant jill is of utmost importance, as during pregnancy the ferret fetuses have a large glucose demand that must be satisfied by the mother. If the fetal demand and the maternal supply become imbalanced due to fasting of the mother or increased nutritional demands of the rapidly developing fetal placental unit, females suffer from negative energy balance and succumb to severe hypoglycemia (Batchelder et al., 1999; Dalrymple, 2004) . Prohaczik et al. (2009) describe in detail the metabolic changes which occur during pregnancy toxemia and how to monitor for them. Their findings showed that in contrast to healthy animals, hypoglycemia, hyperketonemia, hypoinsulinemia, and decreased T4 and T3 levels were detected in females with pregnancy toxemia. Necropsy showed excessive hepatic lipidosis (Batchelder et al., 1999; Dalrymple, 2004; Prohaczik et al., 2009) .",

There are few signs of impending parturition, although abdominal enlargement and mammary development do occur in the last week or two. Small litters (fewer than three) may result in inadequate stimulus for parturition. Jills that pass their due date without delivery should be palpated for fetuses. Kits remaining in utero beyond the 43rd day typically die; kits with congenital malformations such as cyclopia and exencephaly may also delay the initiation of labor. Dystocia is common in ferrets because of positional abnormalities and fetal oversize and should be treated by cesarean section. Jills tolerate cesareans well and will nurse kits delivered in this way. If small litter size is responsible for delayed parturition, prostaglandins (0.5-1.0 mg Lutalyse) may be used, followed by 0.3 ml oxytocin (6 U) after 3 h (Fox and Bell, 1998) . Failure to deliver within 8 h of administration of prostaglandin is an indication for cesarean section. Jills should be provided heat, energy, hydration, and analgesia following cesarean.",

Offering the jill regular chow mixed with warm water may promote maternal acceptance. Kits should be kept warm pending acceptance by the jill. Jills should be left undisturbed for the first several days postpartum to minimize as much as possible provoking litter cannibalization. Crossfostering to other jills may be successfully accomplished, provided that the kits are warm and that the foster jill has kits of similar age.

The ear canals of a ferret do not open until approximately 32 days postnatally (as compared with 6 days in a cat), which coincides with the appearance of a startle response to loud hand claps and the recording of acoustically activated neurons in the midbrain (Moore, 1982) . This late onset of hearing may explain why kits produce exceptionally loud, piercing sounds during the first 4 weeks of life. Lactating jills are tuned in to kit vocalizations and will respond to high-frequency (greater than 16 kHz) sounds in a maze test, whereas males and nonlactating females will ignore these sounds (Shimbo, 1992) .

A superficial gastritis present in the body of the stomach showed that H. mustelae was located on the surface of the mucosa but not in the LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE crypts. Inflammation occupied the full thickness of the distal antral mucosa, the so-called diffuse antral gastritis described in humans (Fig. 14.2a, b) . In this location, H. mustelae was seen at the surface, in the pits, and on the superficial portion of the glands. In the proximal antrum and the transitional mucosa, focal glandular atrophy, a precancerous lesion, and regeneration were present, in addition to those lesions seen in the distal antrum. Also, deep colonization of H. mustelae was observed focally in the affected antral glands. Argyrophilic bacteria have also been demonstrated in the liver and biliary tract of ferrets with chronic cholangiohepatitis, bile duct hyperplasia, and cholangiocellular carcinoma. Organisms shared sequence homology with H. cholecystus (Garcia et al., 2002) .",

In humans, epidemiologic data strongly support the association between H. pylori and development of gastric adenocarcinoma. Similarly, we have recently documented a series of H. mustelae-infected ferrets with gastric mucosaassociated lymphoid tissue (MALT) lymphoma that parallels the same syndrome found in humans. Lymphoma was diagnosed in the wall of the lesser curvature of the pyloric antrum, corresponding to the predominant focus of H. mustelae-induced gastritis in ferrets. Gastric lymphomas demonstrated characteristic lymphoepithelial lesions, and the lymphoid cells were IgG positive in all ferrets (Erdman et al., 1997) .

Ferrets might be more susceptible to mycobacterial infections than other species. Natural infections with Mycobacterium bovis and M. avium have been reported in the ferret (de Lisle et al., 2008; Saunders and Thomsen, 2006) . Ferrets are also susceptible to experimental infection with human tubercle bacillus. Most reports of tuberculosis in ferrets are in animals that were used for research in England and the rest of Europe between the years of 1929 to 1953 and were likely related to the feeding of raw poultry, raw meat, and unpasteurized milk to ferrets during this time (Fox, 1998a) . In New Zealand the prevalence rate in the endemic area for M. bovis was 17.9% for feral ferrets (n = 548) (Ragg et al., 1995a) The feeding of commercially prepared diets and widespread tuberculosis testing and elimination in livestock and poultry have resulted in the reduced incidence of the disease in ferrets. Mycobacterium avium-infected wild birds shed the organism in feces; prevention of contamination of food and outdoor housing areas of ferrets is warranted. Horizontal transmission of M. bovis infection was demonstrated in ferrets under experimental housing conditions. Several behavioral interactions were observed that could result in M. bovis transmission, including den sharing, playing, fighting, sniffing of orifices and faeces, cannibalism, and aggressive breeding behavior (Qureshi et al., 2000) .",

Several Salmonella serovars have been isolated from mink with gastroenteritis and abortion (Gorham et al., 1949) . Contaminated raw meat products were suspected as the source in one outbreak. S. Typhimurium was isolated in ferrets in an outbreak of clinical disease (Coburn and Morris, 1949) and several serotypes including S. Hadar, S. Enteritidis, S. Kentucky, and S.

Typhimurium of ferret origin included marked tissue pallor, petechiae in the gastric mucosa, and the presence of melena in one and a dark-colored fibrinous exudate in the large intestine of the other ferret (Coburn and Morris, 1949) . Studies involving experimental inoculation with S. Enteritidis, S. Newport, and S. Choleraesuis via the oral route to healthy, distemper-infected, and feed-depleted ferrets and mink showed a fairly high resistance to infection (Gorham et al., 1949) . Only two animals of 29 in the diet-restricted group -1 ferret and 1 mink -showed clinical signs of infection after feeding S. Newport culture. Signs included lethargy, anorexia, trembling, and fecal blood. The gastrointestinal tract showed a large amount of mucus containing red blood cells; bits of desquamated epithelium and few mononuclear cells overlying the gastric mucosa; an exudate in the small intestine consisting of mucoid material, red blood cells, and desquamated small intestinal villi; edematous villi in the ileum; and a diffuse infiltrate of the small intestinal mucosa with lymphocytes and macrophages. Necrotic foci in the liver, spleen, and, less commonly, the kidney, as well as splenomegaly and visceral lymphadenopathy, were observed in chronic fatal infections (Coburn and Morris, 1949) . Abortion and gastroenteritis have been reported in mink (Gorham et al., 1949) . A recent outbreak of Salmonella Dublin infection was recorded in a large number of Danish mink farms (Dietz et al., 2006) . All of the affected farms suffered extensive disease problems; clinical and pathological observations included abortion, stillbirths, necrotizing endometritis, and increased mortality. The outbreaks took place mainly during April and May, around the time of whelping when the animals are very susceptible to Salmonella infections. The most common lesion at necropsy was a characteristic dark-red, very fragile uterus which correlated histologically with severe, necrotizing endometritis, often complicated with endometrial rupture and concurrent, diffuse, purulent peritonitis. The strain was identified as S. Dublin.",

One exception to this commonly seen secondary pneumonia is the description of an outbreak of severe respiratory disease associated with a novel Mycoplasma species in ferrets (Kiupel et al., 2012) . This report describes an outbreak of respiratory disease characterized by a dry, nonproductive cough which was observed in 6-to 8-week-old ferrets.

Jills may require aggressive care, because acute mastitis may progress rapidly and animals may become septicemic and moribund (Liberson et al., 1983) . Oral antibiotic administration to kits nursing on affected jills is recommended (Bell, 1997a) . Supplementation of kits with milk replacer may also be necessary, because jills with acute mastitis are reluctant to nurse, and jills with the chronic form have diminished lactation as milk-producing tissue is replaced by scar tissue (Bell, 1997a) . Surgical resection and debridement of affected glands and supportive care may be necessary for jills with acute mastitis. In the laboratory setting, in which foster mothers are often available, it is far more common to remove and foster the kits, after which jills are treated medically. When cross-fostering kits is required, kits may spread infection to healthy jills. Maintaining thorough personal hygiene practices when handling affected jills is important in minimizing spread to other lactating jills. Jills with the chronic form of mastitis should be culled (Bell, 1997a) .",

Humane euthanasia of affected animals is recommended due to the absence of any literature reports of an animal surviving active infection. Distemper infection can be prevented by vaccination with modified live vaccine (MLV) of chicken embryo tissue culture origin (CETCO) administered subcutaneously or intramuscularly. Kits should be vaccinated every 2-3 weeks, starting at age 6 weeks, until 14 weeks and annually thereafter . It is important to adhere to the prescribed vaccination protocol, because ferret deaths have been reported following double-dose vaccination (Carpenter et al., 1976) . Vaccine reactions manifest as vomiting, diarrhea, fever, and collapse. A report evaluating a large number of such reactions found an event rate of 1% for distemper administered as a sole vaccine. This incidence was associated with the cumulative number of distemper vaccines received (Moore et al., 2005) . Diphendramine (0.5-2 mg/kg IV, IM) or epinephrine (20 \u03bcg/kg SQ, IV, IM, intratracheally) with standard supportive care should be initiated. Inactivated distemper vaccines do not elicit consistent, effective immunity and are not recommended. It is important to know the vaccination schedule of your ferret supplier and to vaccinate supplementally as appropriate. New ferrets should be held in quarantine for 2 weeks prior to introduction into the resident colony.",

The characteristic histopathologic finding is severe pyogranulomatous inflammation, often surrounding vessels, that infiltrates, destroys, and replaces affected parenchyma. All parenchymatous organs can be affected, with subsequent organ-specific clinical manifestations. In the brain, the lesions are pyogranulomatous meningoecephalomyelitis, with a distribution centered on blood vessels, and parenchymal involvement which is most severe periventricularly (Garner et al., 2008) .",

This newer drug has been used in a variety of small mammals at a dose of 10-50 mg/kg once daily for 10 days (Mitchell, 2008) .

Yeasts are oval, whereas cryptosporidium oocysts are spherical or ellipsoidal. Additionally, yeasts will stain with iodine and are not acid-fast, whereas Cryptosporidium has the opposite staining characteristics. The oocyst residuum is seen as a refractive dot under phase-contrast microscopy, a structure lacking in yeast (Kirkpatrick and Dubey, 1987) . Sugar-solution centrifugation and fecal sedimentation using formalin-ether or formalin-ethyl acetate are effective diagnostic concentration techniques (Hill and Lappin, 1995) . Oocysts may then be viewed with phasecontrast or bright-field microscopy of specimens stained with an acid-fast method. A direct fecal smear may be methanol-or heat-fixed and stained with an acid-fast method (Hill and Lappin, 1995) .",

Efficacy was evaluated by microscopic evidence of ear mites in debris from aural swabs taken weekly for an 8-week period. Topical 1% ivermectin (Ivomec, Merck AgVet Division, Rahway, New Jersey), diluted 1:10 in propylene glycol at a dosage of 400 \u03bcg/kg body weight divided equally between the two ear canals and administered on days 1 and 14 of the study, was the most effective treatment. However, more recent publications suggest that because of the anatomical characteristics of the ear of the ferret, conventional treatment involving instillation of drops into the ear canal is of very limited efficacy (Fisher et al., 2007) . A single topical application of approximately 15 mg/kg selamectin per ferret has been reported to be highly effective in the treatment of this irritant infestation. Another study showed that the combination of imidacloprid 10% + moxidectin 1% (Advocate \u00ae spot-on for small cats and ferrets) applied to ferrets naturally infested with O. cynotis achieved 100% cure after two or three treatments at 2-week intervals (Le Sueur et al., 2011) . These medications can be partially given into the ear canal with the rest applied directly to the skin of the interscapular region.",

Microfilaria are ingested by mosquitoes and, after two molts, become infective third-stage larvae. Infective larvae are deposited onto the skin when mosquitoes feed, and larvae find their way into the body of the final host through the bite wound and migrate subcutaneously to the thorax and eventually to the heart (Knight, 1987) . The primary reservoir of infection is dogs, but heartworm may be found in a variety of mammals, including humans. All species except wild and domestic canids, domestic felines, ferrets, and the California sea lion are considered aberrant hosts (Knight, 1987) .",

Moist lung sounds and/or muffled heart sounds were revealed by thoracic auscultation in many of these cases. Pleural or abdominal effusion may be observed radiologically. The ferrets described in these cases were housed outdoors and either died or were euthanized. In one case the key clinical signs included the caval syndrome, mild anemia and biliverdinuria (Sasai et al., 2000) . One of the authors (JM) has also observed biliverdinuria in a confirmed case of dirofilariasis, suggesting that biliverdinuria development in heartworm-infected ferrets may be of increase diagnostic value for this condition.",

The dosage recommended for ferrets by the American Heartworm Society is 0.006 mg ivermectin per kg body weight monthly (Fox, 1998g) . Housing ferrets indoors, particularly during the mosquito season, would help minimize exposure. Successful adulticide treatment in ferrets has been described and includes the administration of thiacetarsemide, with the same precautions used in dogs: antithrombotic therapy, treatment for heart failure, and strict cage confinement (Stamoulis et al., 1997) . The current recommended treatment protocol for affected ferrets is ivermectin (50 \u03bcg/ kg SC q30d) given until clinical signs resolve and microfilaremia is absent. Previous treatment protocols using adulticide therapy with melarsomine have fallen out of favor because of adverse reactions (Morrisey and Kraus, 2011) . One should follow up with heartworm antigen tests until negative and resume heartworm prevention 1 month after adulticide treatment (Stamoulis et al., 1997) .

Any jill with 15 or more kits may develop pregnancy toxemia because abdominal space is not adequate for both the gravid uterus and the volume of food required to support it. Pregnancy toxemia of the ferret is of the metabolic type and shares features with similar conditions in pregnant sheep, obese cattle, pregnant camelids, obese guinea pigs, and starved pregnant rats, as well as with the condition feline idiopathic hepatic lipidosis. It is characterized by abnormal energy metabolism with consequent hyperlipidemia, hypoglycemia, ketosis, and hepatic lipidosis. In LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE this condition, energy demand exceeds intake, leading to excessive mobilization of free fatty acids and a chain of metabolic events that culminates in a shift from fatty acid metabolism and export to ketosis and hepatic lipidosis. A study evaluating the metabolic and endocrine characteristics of pregnancy toxemia in ferrets showed that in contrast to healthy animals, hypoglycemia, hyperketonemia, hypoinsulinemia, and decreased T4 and T3 levels were detected in females with pregnancy toxemia.

Anemia was found in 50% of ferrets tested. Necropsy findings included tan or yellow discolored liver, gastric hemorrhage, and gravid uterus. Treatment for jills within a day of their due date should include cesarean section and intensive postoperative support, including force-feeding a gruel of high-quality cat food and ferret chow, nutritive pastes, intravenous fluids containing glucose, and supplemental heat. Ceasarean section should be performed under isoflurane or sevoflurane anesthesia because hepatic dysfunction prolongs the metabolism of injectable agents. Agalactia is common after cesarean section, and kits may require hand feeding with kitten or puppy milk replacers, administered per os by fine-tipped syringe six times daily for the first 24 h. Cross-fostering is an effective method of enhancing kit survival; hand rearing of kits if the jill fails to nurse within a day postoperatively is energy-consuming and generally unrewarding.

Hematology findings may vary from an initial neutrophilia and thrombocytosis early in the disease course to lymphopenia, thrombocytopenia, neutropenia, and anemia. The anemia begins as normocytic normochromic but progresses to macrocytic hypochromic (Sherrill and Gorham, 1985) . Coagulopathy associated with hepatic dysfunction and thrombocytopenia combine to produce extensive manifestations of bleeding, pallor, melena, petechiation or ecchymosis, subdural hematoma, and hematomyelia (Hart, 1985; Fox and Bell, 1998) . At necropsy, tissue pallor, light tan to pale pink bone marrow, hemorrhage, bronchopneumonia, hydrometra, pyometra, and mucopurulent vaginitis may be seen. Histopathology may reveal cystic endometrial hypoplasia, hemosiderosis, diminished splenic extramedullary hematopoiesis, and mild to moderate hepatic lipidosis (Sherrill and Gorham, 1985; Bell, 1997a) . Treatment consists of terminating estrus while supporting the animal with antibiotics, blood transfusion, B vitamins, and nutritional supplementation. Estrus may be terminated by injection with 50-100 IU of human chorionic gonadotropin (hCG) or 20 \u03bcg of gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), repeated 1 week after initial injection if required. Ovariohysterectomy may be considered for ferrets that are stable and have adequate numbers of platelets and red cells. Ferrets with a packed cell volume (PCV) of 25% or greater have a good prognosis and require only termination of estrus for resolution of aplastic anemia. Jills with a PCV of 15-25% may require blood transfusions and have a guarded prognosis. Ferrets with a PCV of less than 15% have a poor prognosis and require aggressive therapy with multiple transfusions. The lack of identifiable blood groups in ferrets makes multiple transfusions uncomplicated by potential transfusion reactions .",

A 40-to 45-day pseudopregnancy then follows, except in the case of ovariohysterectomy. Repeated administration of hCG may result in sensitization and anaphylaxis. After several administrations, hCG is unlikely to be effective in termination of estrus. Anaphylaxis is manifest as incoordination, tremor, vomiting, and diarrhea and may be reversed by prompt administration of diphenhydramine. In order to avoid the risk of anaphylaxis, GnRH can be injected, as it is a smaller molecule and anaphylaxis to it is extremely rare. A GnRH analog (Deslorelin)-releasing implant has recently been approved in ferrets for the treatment of hyperadrenocortisism in the United States. This implant could also be used to 'chemically' sterilize the female. The 4.7-mg implant has been shown to suppress clinical signs of hyperadrenocorticism for up to 30 months with an average of 17.5 months (Wagner et al., 2005) .",

Anecdodal reports suggest that the clinical presentation is very much similar to the classical signs in domesticated animals, which are most consistently obesity, lethargy, decreased activity, and excessive sleeping. Ante mortem diagnosis can be challenging but a recent publication reports T4 levels using human recombinant TSH (Thyrogen) in 11 neutered ferrets, and successful stimulation of the thyroid axis was achieved by this method. Prestimulation values for T4 in neutered male and female ferrets were determined to be 29.9 \u00b1 5.8 ng/ml and 21.8 \u00b1 3.3 ng/ml, respectively. Ferrets were stimulated using 100 mg Thyrogen intramuscularly, and euthyroid ferrets were found to have an increase of 1.4-times basal levels after 4 h (Wagner, 2012) . Another study involving 25 laboratory and pet neutered ferrets using the same protocol noted a median poststimulation T4 level at 34.8% above prestimulatory levels, and found the mean plasma T4 of euthyroid ferrets to be 21.3 nmol/l (Mayer et al., 2013) .

Disease may be evident in ferrets as young as 2 years old, but later onset (at 4-5 years of age) is typical LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE (Caplan et al., 1996; Ehrhart et al., 1996) . Nonspecific presenting signs include weight loss, vomiting, and ataxia. Weakness is often evident, ranging from lethargy to posterior paresis or outright collapse (Caplan et al., 1996) . Hypoglycemia caused by excess production of insulin by neoplastic \u03b2-cells may cause tremors, disorientation, or seizures (Fox and Marini, 1998) . Excessive salivation (ptyalism) or pawing at the mouth is a frequent finding. Clinical signs are often intermittent or episodic. Other common findings include hindlimb weakness, splenomegaly, and lymphocytosis. Presumptive diagnosis is made based on clinical signs in conjunction with the demonstration of hypoglycemia. Blood glucose determinations for the diagnosis of insulinoma are most useful when taken after a 4-h fasting period. Fasting glucose concentrations below 60 mg/dl (3.33 mmol/l) are considered diagnostic for the condition (Quesenberry and Carpenter, 2012) , whereas values between 60 and 85 mg/ dl (3.33-4.72 mmol/l) are suspect and the test should be repeated (Fox and Marini, 1998) . The repeat test should be standardized by force feeding the ferret some amount of food with subsequent fasting for 4 h prior to the repeat blood collection. Other potential causes for hypoglycemia should be ruled out, including anorexia, starvation, hepatic disease, sepsis, and nonpancreatic neoplasia (Antinoff, 1997) . Demonstration of concurrent hyperinsulinemia aids the diagnosis (Caplan et al., 1996) but secretion of insulin from the pancreas can be erratic in ferrets with insulinoma, resulting in non-diagnostic baseline insulin levels. Normal insulin concentrations have been reported to be between 4.88 and 34.84 mU/ml (35-250 pmol/l) (Jenkins, 2000) . Medical management using prednisone and/or diazoxide along with dietary modification such as frequent feeding of high-protein meals can minimize or control clinical signs but will not affect the underlying tumor (Quesenberry and Rosenthal, 1997) . Surgical exploration of the pancreas and tumor excision are recommended for animals that are healthy enough to be subjected to anesthesia and surgery. In a comparison of medical versus surgical treatment, Weiss et al., (1998) found that surgery improved disease-free interval and survival time. Histological examination of the tissue removed can provide a definitive diagnosis, and although the effect may be transient, clinical signs are often reduced or eliminated after surgical debulking (Figs. 14.7 and 14.8) (Ehrhart et al., 1996) . Histologically, these tumors reveal malignant proliferation of pancreatic \u03b2-cells, and local recurrence or metastasis to lymph nodes, mesentery, spleen, or liver may occur (Caplan et al., 1996) but it is considered uncommon.",

            "text": "Adrenocortical cell tumor is the second most common type of neoplasia in ferrets and is generally diagnosed between 3 and 6 years of age. If clinical signs are present, they often include weight loss and a bilateral, symmetric alopecia. Pruritus is a variable finding (Quesenberry and Rosenthal, 1997) . These primary clinical signs in ferrets are directly related to the increase of sex steroids in the blood resulting in estrogen toxicity. Although ferrets with this syndrome have been called 'cushingoid,' it is rare to diagnose elevated resting levels of glucocorticoids or an abnormal response to adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) stimulation or dexamethasone suppression testing. The pathophysiologic difference between the ferret adrenal disease and the typical Cushing presentation is the production in affected ferrets of a significant increase of the sex steroids by the zona reticularis and not significant levels of cortisol from the zona fasciculata. The sex steroids that are usually elevated are estradiol, 17-hydroxyprogesterone, testosterone, and androstenedione. The elevation of the adrenal sex hormones leads to characteristic changes such as estrus-like vulvar swelling in spayed females and prostatic changes and cystitis in males Coleman et al., 1998) . Rule-outs for enlarged vulva include estrus in an intact female or functional ovarian remnants in a spayed female (Patterson et al., 2003) . Abdominal palpation may reveal cranial abdominal masses, and ultrasound is extremly useful in documenting a potential increase in size of the adrenal glands. However, with an endocrine disease, the size of the organ does not always correlate with the clinical signs. It is not uncommon for a ferret to have severe clinical signs without having a truly enlarged adrenal gland (J. Mayer, personal observation). In these cases, a serum assay for abnormal levels of the sex hormones listed above should be considered (Lipman et al., 1993; Wagner and Dorn, 1994; Rosenthal and Peterson, 1996) . Adrenal panels are available from the endocrinology Laboratory, School of Veterinary Medicine.",

Affected ferrets may exhibit localizing signs (e.g., dyspnea in a ferret with mediastinal involvement or peripheral lymphadenopathy in an animal with a multicentric distribution) but as is the case in many species, lymphoma is a 'masquerader,' and affected ferrets often present with chronic, nonspecific signs. Weight loss, anorexia, and lethargy are often reported. Splenic and/or hepatic enlargement may be evident. Cutaneous involvement has been documented (Li et al., 1995; Rosenbaum et al., 1996) . Blood work should not be used as a primary diagnostic tool but it should be performed in every patient with lymphoma to evaluate overall health. Although hematological examination typically reveals anemia, which is usually mild and nonregenerative, and lymphopenia, lymphocytosis may be found, especially in younger ferrets. Lymphocytosis should not be immediately interpreted as leukemia. Ferrets with chronic inflammatory/infectious disease will often present with persistent lymphocytosis. Atypical lymphocytes are identified in the circulation in some cases. Ante mortem definitive diagnosis of lymphoma can be made by cytological examination of specimens obtained via fine-needle aspiration or excisional biopsy.

As in other species, histological evaluation reveals neoplastic lymphocytes in affected tissues, generally evident as a monomorphic population (Fig. 14.12 ) . Although surgery and radiation therapy may be useful in certain cases, most attempts to treat ferret lymphoma have utilized chemotherapeutic regimens with dosages extrapolated from other domestic animals or humans. Treatment generally results in a remission that may last from 3 months to 5 years (Brown, 1997b; Erdman et al., 1998) . Different treatment protocls have been published in the past. Unfortunately, the paucity of information regarding remission durations and survival make comparison between the different protocols impossible. The simplest form of chemotherapy for lymphoma is oral prednisolone/prednisone given at 1-2 mg/kg PO q 12-24 h. This treatment will achieve partial or complete, short-lived remission. It is important that the animal should not be exposed to steriods prior to the diagnostic biopsy as the remission can occur very quickly and a false negative biopsy report would follow if the animal has been medicated for longer than 48 h. In addition, chemotherapy may be less effective in ferrets receiving chronic immunosuppressive doses of prednisolone at the start of therapy (e.g., as part of a medical insulinoma management). Most of the commonly used protocols are modified feline lymphoma protocols, which include commonly used drugs for which repeated IV access is needed. Several multidrug chemotherapy protocols have been described, using L-asparaginase, vincristine, cyclophosphamide, doxorubicin, methotrexate, and prednisone. Due to the possible complication of extravasation of these drugs and the perceived invasive charater of these protocols, one of the authors (JM) was part of a team who developed and successfully implemented a non-invasive protocol (Tables 14.9, 14.10). This protocol involves only oral and SC drugs, which allow for a relatively easy implementation of the protocol without much risk or the need to hospitalize the patient. In general, chemotherapy can be considered chronic treatment because the treatment usually lasts for weeks to months.

Detailed dissection with fine scissors and forceps under a heat lamp or on a heated surface can free the kits. Occasionally, kits may need to be rotated on their umbilical pedicle to achieve adequate clearance to cut the cord; cords should be cut as far from the umbilicus as possible.

Histologic examination of affected organs has revealed that the most common cause for splenic enlargement (in the absence of a neoplastic infiltrate) is extramedullary hematopoiesis (EMH) (Erdman et al., 1998) . This may be an incidental finding, but it has been suggested that in some cases a pathologically enlarged spleen may play a role in chronic anemia that may respond to splenectomy, a syndrome known as hypersplenism (Ferguson, 1985) . Splenomegaly can also be commonly found in conjunction with lymphoma, with or without intrasplenic neoplastic lymphoid accumulations. In anesthetized ferrets, splenomegaly may be caused by splenic sequestration of erythrocytes (Marini et al., 1994 (Marini et al., , 1997 .

Presenting signs for this syndrome generally include chronic weight loss, anorexia, diarrhea, and occasionally, vomiting. Eosinophilic granulomas have been found in the mesenteric lymph nodes of most affected ferrets, and in some cases other organs (e.g., lung or liver) may be involved. An interesting finding in many ferrets is the presence in inflamed lymph nodes of Splendore-Hoeppli material, a histological phenomenon that has been associated in other species with helminths, bacteria, fungi, and foreign bodies (Fig. 14.13 ). An etiological agent has not been identified; consequently, therapy consists largely of supportive care to treat the chronic enteritis (Fox, 1998b) . Based on the biology of eosinophils, however, the use of corticosteroids or ivermectin has been attempted and may be beneficial (Bell, 1997b) .",

Transmural and circumferential esophageal infiltrate along the length of the organ is a characteristic lesion. Treatment is supportive; a combination of prednisone, cyclophosphamide, and chloramphenicol may be successful (Ramsell and Garner, 2010) . Gray, yellow, or white small raised lesions may be found on the surface of ferret lungs at gross examination. Histologically, these lesions are composed of a superficial thickening of the lung tissue with mononuclear cell infiltration and varying degrees of fibrosis, with or without cholesterol-like clefts. The etiology of this condition (known as subpleural histiocytosis, pleural lipidosis, or lipid pneumonia) is unknown, and it appears to be an incidental lesion (Fox, 1998f) . ",
