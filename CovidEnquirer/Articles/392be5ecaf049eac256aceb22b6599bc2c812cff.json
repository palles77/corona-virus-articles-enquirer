With a growing population, urbanization, and increased income, the food industry has become increasingly market driven. As a result of globalization and reduced trade barriers, it has grown to account for approximately 10% of the world's gross domestic product (Murray 2007) . Fortunately, environmental protection and sustainability are currently better aligned with the worlds' consumption of natural resources. Over the past few decades, it has tried to adopt technologies to improve waste minimization and environmental performance. Although the most valuable elements are extracted from foods during harvest and processing, what remains in both the product-specific and product-nonspecific wastes may also contain other potentially valuable components.",

Harvesting of crops also results in an inedible portion of the biomass (including edible product lost during harvest) contributing to what is known as crop residues. For most common edible crops, the residue-to-crop-production ratio is between 0.9 and 3 to 1 (Scarlat et al., 2010) . This mass is not accounted for in Table 1 .2, however, typical quantities of some common food crops are given in Table 1 .3. In lower-income regions, losses occur at every stage, particularly postharvest, to a much higher degree, but occur significantly less at the consumption stage. Higher losses throughout production in low-income regions are an artefact of inadequate knowledge, skills, technologies, and infrastructure to support the food supply chain compared to the industrialized world (Godfray et al., 2010b) .",

Oil meals are obtained by solvent extraction of the oil cakes, which are obtained by pressing the seed. In 2013, 269 MMT of various oil meals were produced globally, of which 181 MMT was soymeal (united States department of Agriculture, 2015a). In the united States alone, 36 MMT of soymeal is produced annually (united States department of Agriculture, 2015a), representing more than two-thirds of the proteinaceous animal feed in the country (lefferts et al., 2006) . Other oilseed meals are lower in protein and higher in fiber and are often used for feeding ruminants. cottonseed meal is also high in protein and is mainly used as cattle feed in the united States or as aquaculture feed. unlike other seeds, the press cake obtained from castor seeds during castor oil production is inedible because of its high level of phytotoxins (ricin, a toxic protein), hydrocyanides, and other allergens, however, this too has a high level of protein, \u223c20-30% (Table 1 .4).",

However, as a result of the discrepancies between each state's local policy making and a lack of cohesive global regulations, the intersection between risk and commerce continues to be a major challenge facing the international trading system. A significant amount of trade conflict experienced at the World Trade Organization has involved the united States, canada, and/or the european union (Hornsby, 2013) . Some topics that became the focus of either formal or informal disputes have included hormone-fed beef, bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSe), raw milk cheese, genetically modified organisms, chlorine-washed chicken, and wood packing materials. Such disputes imply the presence of a transatlantic divide over what constitutes a legitimate risk regulation, however, this is an oversimplification. Although the risk regulations set forth by the european union take a precautionary approach, acting in light of scientific uncertainty and taking into account public concerns, the uS system is based on a \"sound science\" approach, free from political influence, however, this has not always been the case. It has been argued that the united States used to be more precautionary than the european union (Hornsby, 2013) , but was pressured to limit the calculation of risk in public policy. The eu's regulatory failures during food safety crises served to undermine public trust in the eu institutions, resulting in the use of a precautionary approach (Hornsby, 2013) . Overall, it has also been proposed that both regions partake in \"occasional and selective application of precaution to different risks in different places and time\" (Wiener, 2011) . nevertheless, there are some consistencies around the world regarding the safe handling, distribution, and disposal of food, animal wastes, and by-products.",

More recent infectious disease outbreaks, such as avian influenza and severe acute respiratory syndrome, have further jeopardized diplomatic relations, frightened the public, and caused massive economic losses by disrupting global commerce (Karesh and cook, 2005) . Since then, concern over the risks posed by ABPs, including infectious diseases (such as swine fever, foot and mouth) and other contaminants (such as dioxins), to human and animal health, has resulted in strict regulations regarding their safe handling and disposal (cunningham, 2003 ; department for environment Food and rural Affairs, 2011). As such, most countries now have local regulations put in place that are typically broad in scope and directly affect any person or business that generates, uses, disposes, stores, handles, or transports food waste containing animal products and ABPs derived from the food processing industry.",

The regulation covers the safe disposal options available for all animal products, including meat, fish, milk, and eggs not intended for human consumption, and other products of animal origin, including hides, feathers, wool, bones, horns, and hooves. It also prohibits catering waste being used as livestock feed and covers disposal of fallen stock, companion animals, and wild animals if they are suspected of being diseased. The regulations also control the use of ABPs as feed, fertilizer, and technical products with rules for their transformation via composting and biogas operations and their disposal via rendering and incineration (department for environment Food and rural Affairs, 2011).",

The choice of media used will largely depend on the cost, customs, and regulatory environment. For example, converting the by-product to animal fodder (bioreduction) may not be feasible in all countries. excess and waste food has been used as animal fodder for centuries, and in many parts of the world, farmers still use waste food to feed their animals-primarily pigs and poultry. The practice of feeding waste material containing meat products to pigs was banned in the united Kingdom in 2001 (Statutory Instrument 2001 , no. 1704 The Animal By-products Amendment) to prevent further spread of BSe, and soon after, a new regulation was implemented throughout the european union (The Animal By-Products regulation, ec no: 1774/2002) prohibiting catering waste from being fed to farmed animals. This includes all waste food and used cooking oils, as well as waste from vegetarian restaurants and kitchens.

However, most food wastes are not appropriate for incineration, owing to their high moisture content. When properly equipped, an incinerator can be used as a means of energy recovery to generate electricity. Heat released from the combustion of waste can be used to produce steam, which can turn a steam turbine, generating electricity. However, because of the increased concentration of toxins in the ash, incinerators must be operated alongside landfill systems in order to dispose of them. combustion destroys chemical compounds and diseasecausing bacteria, leaving it pathogen free, but causes serious environmental problems through the production of carbon dioxide, nitrogen oxides, sulfur dioxide, and trace quantities of toxic pollutants, such as heavy metals and dioxins. The remaining residues are often landfilled, owing to their high heavy metal content.",

This involves a combination of chemical and microbiological processes occurring throughout three stages that convert organic materials to a stable, soil-like product called compost (Som et al., 2009; Verbeek et al., 2012) . Provided composting is carried out well, the volume and mass of the waste can be reduced by up to 40%. For composting to occur efficiently, the conditions of the composting process must be maintained at an optimal level to encourage microbial growth. Because of changes in the composition of waste material with location and over time, the compost mixture needs optimization through regular adjustments. For example, if the system becomes anaerobic, offensive odors can be produced, and if it becomes too wet or too dry, the process will halt altogether. Some of these organic waste materials require specific pretreatment before composting can occur. In the united Kingdom, eu standards must be implemented over and above uK standards if the site treats category 2 ABPs, which have first been pressure rendered, or category 3 ABPs if they exclude catering waste. exceptions apply for some types of ABPs in the united Kingdom, which can be composted in closed reactors at 70\u00b0c for more than 1 h or in housed rows of piled green-waste (windrows) at 60\u00b0c for more than 8 days under strict operating parameters with a maximum particle size of 400 mm.",

Protein-based raw materials can be used for the production of 1,2-ethanediamine and 1,4-butanediamine from the amino acids serine and arginine, respectively . Furthermore, protein-based surfactants are valuable mild surfactants, because the structure and properties of the amino acids in the surfactants are similar to the amino acids that make up the tissue of skin.",

In light of current legislation and potential markets for value-added commodities, it is becoming apparent that the use of protein-rich agricultural by-products for lower value applications, such as animal fodder, is no longer a sensible use of such a valuable resource.
