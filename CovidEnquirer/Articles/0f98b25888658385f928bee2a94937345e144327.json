            "text": "The JHM strain of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a member of the Coronavirus family, experimentally produces several diseases in mice and rats, depending on the dose and route of inoculation and the age and strain of the infected animals (LePrevost et a/., 1975; Levy-LeBlond et a/., 1979; Sorensen et al., 1982 Sorensen et al., , 1984 . MHV-JHM is highly neurotropic (Lampert et a/., 1973; Weiner, 1973; Robb et a/., 1979; Knobler et a/., 1981) . Infection of adult mice by this virus results in encephalomyelitis featuring prominent demyelination. Ten percent of the animals survive the acute infection and subsequently develop a persistent, demyelinating disease, reminiscent of multiple sclerosis. The development of demyelinating lesions is thought to be a primary effect of infection of oligodendrocytes, rather than being immunologically mediated (Lampert et a/., 1976; Wege et a/., 1982) . The MHV genome encodes a nucleocapsid protein (N), a matrix-like transmembrane glycoprotein (El), and a peplomer protein (E2) as well as several nonstructural proteins (Siddell et a/., 1981; Sturman and Holmes, 1983; Bond eta/., 1984) . The E2 glycoprotein is responsible for the attachment MHV to the host cell plasma membrane and elicits the production of neutralizing antibody (Collins et al., 1982) . Monoclonal antibodies reacting with E2 have been used to identify several antigenic sites on MHV-JHM E2, some of which have been shown to be important determinants of pathogenicity (Talbot et a/., 1984; Talbot and Buchmeier, 1985) . The E2 glycoprotein is synthesized on membrane-bound polyribosomes (Holmes et al., 1981; Siddell et al., 1981) . The primary translation product, a 120-kDa polypeptide, is rapidly glycosylated to a 150-kDa E2 precursor which is subsequently further glycosylated to a 180-kDa species. The predominant intracellular form of E2 in MHV-infected cells has an apparent molecular weight of 180,000 Da. Shortly before the release of virions from cells, some of the cell-associated 180,000-Da E2 protein is cleaved to yield two 90,000-Da glycoproteins, 90A and 9OB (Ricard and Sturman, 1985; Sturman et a/., 1985) . The cleavage of E2 is host cell-dependent, with the ratio of uncleaved E2 (180,000 Da) to cleaved E2 (90A and 9OB) varying from cell line to cell line and depending on the physiologic state of the host cells (Frana et a/., 1985) . Cleavage of E2 is necessary to activate its membrane fusing activity (Sturman et al., 1985) .",

This observation led us to investigate the hypothesis that MHV, like the herpesviruses, induce infected cells to display Fc receptor (FcR) activity (Watkins, 1964; Yasuda and Milgram, 1968) . The IgG Fc-binding receptors induced by herpes simplex virus type I (HSV-1) have been characterized in detail (Longnecker et a/., 1987; Johnson e? a/., 1988) . They are composed of a complex containing the virally encoded glycoproteins gE and gl (970) with both of these polypeptides being required for Fc receptor activity.

All other monoclonal antibodies used in this work were kindly provided by Dr. C. D. Platsoucas of the M. D. Anderson Cancer Center. The OKT3 (IgG,,), OKT4 (lgG&, and OKT8 (IgG,,) mab have been described (Kung er al., 1979; Reinherz et al., 1979; Thomas et al., 1980) . Purified anti-Leu4 (IgG,) monoclonal antibody (Platsoucas, 1984) was purchased from Beckton-Dickinson (Mountainview, CA). The 3D5 anti-y chain T cell receptor mab (IgG,) has been described (Nanno et a/., 1989) . MKD6 mouse mab specific for I-Ad (lgG*,) and 15-5-5' mouse mab specific for Dk, Kd, H-2'(IgG,,) originated from the ATCC (Rockville, MD). The rat anti-mouse FcrR antibody 2.4G2 was originally described by Unkeless (Unkeless, 1979) . Goat antiserum against purified MHV-A59 glycoprotein E2 was a generous gift from Dr. K. Holmes (Uniformed Services University for Health Sciences). The 1.38.1 anti-E2 mab, the 3D5 anti-T cell receptor mab, the anti-l-Ad, and the 15-5-5' mab were used as ammonium sulfate concentrates of tissue culture supernates. The 2.4G2 anti-FcR mab was used as tissue culture supernate without concentration. OKT3, OKT4, and OKT8 mab were purchased from Orthodiagnostic Corp. (Raritan, NJ) and used as diluted ascitic fluids. Purified whole rabbit IgG specific for Micrococcus lysodeikticus as well as F(ab'), fragments were a generous gift of Dr. S. Rodkey (University of Texas, Health Science Center at Houston). The F(ab'), fragments were prepared as described (Nisonoff et a/., 1961) . Residual intact IgG molecules were removed from our F(ab'), preparation by affinity chromatography over a protein A-Sepharose column. The purified F(ab'), fragments were determined to be free of undigested IgG by Ouchterlony immunodiffusion assays. Affinity-purified rabbit anti-goat IgG, goat anti-rabbit IgG, rabbit antimouse IgG, and goat anti-rat IgG, and their FITC-cpnjugates, were purchased from Jackson lmmunoresearch Laboratories (West Grove, PA) and were heavy and light chain specific.",

The 180,000-Da polypeptide was specifically expressed by virus-infected cells. Mock-infected cells did not express the 180-kDa polypeptide (Fig. 4A, lane b) , nor was the 180-kDa protein precipitated from mock-infected cells by monoclonal antibodies (Fig. 4B) , even upon prolonged exposure of the autoradiogram. Precipitation of this 180,000-Da polypeptide was not via the secondary goat antibodies (goat anti-rat, goat anti-rabbit, or goat anti-mouse) used in these experiments since goat IgG alone did not precipitate a detectable protein of this size from MHV-infected cells. The polypeptide precipitated via the Fc portion of rat, mouse, and rabbit IgG had a molecular size, as judged by SDS-PAGE, identical to the MHV E2 protein precipitated by a neutralizing anti-MHV-JHM E2 mab.",

We demonstrated that the molecules recognized by these two antibodies yield identical V-8 maps, and that the E2 protein has an FcrR-like affinity for the Fc portion of IgG.

They provide a link between humoral and cellular immune responses by permitting antibody-dependent cell-mediated toxicity (ADCC) to take place (Nathan et al., 1980; Mellman ef al., 1983; Leslie, 1985) . To date three distinct murine FcyR have been identified: a low-affinity, trypsin-resistant receptor for IgG, or lgGZb (Unkeless, 1979; Hibbs et al., 1986; Lewis et al., 1986 ) a high-affinity, trypsinsensitive receptor for monomeric IgG2, (Unkeless and Eisen, 1975 ) and a receptor for lgGB (Diamond and Yelton, 1981) . One of the best characterized is the mouse macrophage-lymphocyte receptor for IgG, or lgGZb (FcrRII). The study of the latter receptor has been facilitated by the development of the rat mab 2.462 directed against FqR present on macrophages and lymphocytes (Unkeless, 1979; Weinshank et al., 1988) . The receptor is a transmembrane glycoprotein with two extracellular domains that are homologous to members of the lg superfamily (Williams and Barclay, 1988 (Schmidt eta/., 1987; Luytjes et al., 1987; Lewis ef al., 1986) . main (Mellman and Unkeless, 1980) . The binding of goat anti-E2 to the FcrR is an indication that the FcrR shares an antigenic determinant with the MHV E2 protein as well as an Fc binding activity. We have not as yet unequivocally determined if the antigenic site recognized by our goat anti-E2 antibody and shared by E2 and the FcrR and the Fc binding site on E2 and FcyR are equivalent. The FcrR which is recognized by antibody 2.4G2 binds mouse IgG, , IgG,,, and lgGZb. MHV E2 binds mouse IgG2, and igGZb, but not IgG,. The difference in the ability of MHV E2 and Fc+yR to bind mouse IgG, could be an indication that their Fc binding sites have somewhat different structures. It is interesting in this regard that 2.462 did not neutralize MHV infectivity in a plaque reduction assay(data not shown).",

            "text": "Expression of receptors for the Fc regions of IgG are induced also by herpesviruses, mainly HSV-1, HSV-2, cytomegalovirus, and varicella zoster virus (Watkins, 1964; Ogata and Shigeta, 1979; Para et al., 1982; Murayama et a/., 1986; Eizuru and Minamishima, 1988) . For HSV-1, the best studied of these viruses, Fc receptors are composed of a complex containing the virally encoded gE and gl (g70) glycoproteins (Johnson and Feenstra, 1987; Johnson et a/., 1988) . Both are required for Fc receptor activity. The FcyR-like molecules on MHV-JHM-infected cells are also encoded in the virus genome. The Fc binding activity of E2 was conserved among the three strains of MHV we tested. Furthermore, MHV-A59 E2 reacted with the anti-FcyR monoclonal antibody 2.462 as did MHV-JHM E2 (data not shown). No obvious common structural basis for the Fc binding activities of the MHV E2, HSV-1 gE and gl, and FcyR molecules could be demonstrated on the basis of their primary sequences using the Dayhoff Align program (Dayhoff et a/., 1983) . Comparisons of secondary structure using the Garnier and Robson method (Garnier et a/., 1978) were also unrewarding. The demonstration of an Fc binding activity which has been conserved among the MHV strains tested, and the presence of a similar activity among the herpesviruses, suggests that binding of IgG via the Fc portion of the molecule must provide some selective advantage for these viruses.",

In addition, two regions of sequence similarity between the MHV E2 protein and the FcyR were detected (Fig. 8) . The data do not currently allow us to determine if either of the two E2 regions we have identified with sequence similarity with the Fc receptor are responsible for either the Fc binding activity of E2 or its antigenic cross-reactivity with the Fc receptor which we report here. Both of these regions mapped to the same portion of the Fc receptor molecule, adjacent to the first cysteine of the second loop (Lewis et a/., 1986) . In terms of the E2 protein, these regions of sequence similarity are located within the N-terminal subunit of the E2 peplomer. Molecular mimicry between molecules with similar degrees of sequence similarity have been reported (Dyrberg and Oldstone, 1986) . However, molecular mimicry can also occur on the basis of conformational determinants (Dyrberg and Oldstone, 1986) . The current data do not permit us to distinguish between these two possibilities for E2 and the Fc receptor. The molecular mimicry we report here led us to search the PIR and Genebank data bases for possible homologies between E2 and other polypeptides which belong to the immunoglobulin gene superfamily. Small degrees of homology of uncertain significance were detected between E2 and some members of this family.",

It has been postulated that binding of polyclonal IgG lacking antiviral specificity to viral antigens exposed on the cell surface could mask these antigens from specific anti-viral antibody by sterically hindering the attachment of specific antibody (Adler et al., 1978) . Such binding could reduce complement and cell-mediated lysis of infected cells. These effects could possibly be important in allowing virus-infected cells to avoid the host immune response, especially ADCC-mediated destruction, and potentially play a role in MHV persistent infections. This may be especially important in experimentally produced persistent infection of rats, since the binding of rat IgG to E2 appears to be of a higher affinity than the binding of mouse IgG.",
