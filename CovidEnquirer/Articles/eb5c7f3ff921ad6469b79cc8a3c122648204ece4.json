Young children have a relatively large surface area in relation to body weight, a high basal requirement for water, electrolytes and nutrients, and immature renal function with a relative inability to conserve fluid and electrolytes. The problem is further compounded in developing countries, where vulnerable infants and young children are exposed to environmental contamination, malnutrition and inadequate medical care. High mortality and prolonged morbidity are the results (Mata and Guerrant , 1988) .",

Of these, one billion occur in children under 5 years of age. Diarrhoea accounts for five million deaths per year, of which half are in children under 5 years of age. Seven per cent of all children in this age-group die of diarrhoea (Snyder and Merson, 1982) . In contrast, acute diarrhoeal disease in industrialized countries, although still a common cause of hospital admission in childhood, produces less morbidity and mortality (Guerrant et al, 1990) . In adults, infective diarrhoea is more commonly a social inconvenience than a lifethreatening disorder. The ease of world travel has led to the emergence of travellers' diarrhoea as an important problem (Steffen and Boppart, 1987) .",

Characteristically, organisms which switch on fluid and electrolyte secretion (enterotoxigenic) attach to the intestinal mucosa but do not invade. They induce secretion by the production of enterotoxins which interact with intracellular mediators of intestinal electrolyte transport (Vibrio chole~ue, toxigenic Escherichia coli). Other organisms invade and damage the mucosa and may elaborate cytotoxins and/or enterotoxins (Salmonella, Shigella, Campylobacter jejuni) . In order to provide a framework for discussing the mechanisms whereby diarrhoea-inducing organisms can disturb water and electrolyte transport, we have included a brief outline of the regulation of intestinal ion transport.

The hypothesis that crypt cells are the site of secretion has recently been supported by observations on the cell-specific expression of the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR), which acts as a regulated chloride channel (Trezise and Buchwald, 1991) . CFTR mRNA was determined by in situ hybridization in rat small intestine. CFTR was maximally expressed in the intestinal crypts, and least in villous cells, a distribution consistent with crypt cells being the site of chloride secretion. Net small intestinal secretion, which is therefore an exaggeration of a physiological process, arises usually from a combination of a failure to reabsorb the large amount, of endogenous secretions which enter the gut each day, and active chloride secretion. for secreted protons, and chloride in exchange for bicarbonate (Turnberg et al, 1970; Liedtke. and Hopfer, 1982; Booth et al, 1985) . Sodium is also cotransported with glucose or amino acids, a mechanism of particular clinical importance. These symports usually remain intact during infective secretory diarrhoea, and therefore represent a maintained route for sodium absorption (Editorial, 1981) .",

It is against this background that a potentially key role for the enteric nervous system in mediating the effects of cholera toxin (CT) has been proposed. CT-induced secretion can be blocked in the cat in vivo by a variety of nerve and ganglion blockers, suggesting that CT may activate neuronal reflexes as part of a secretory reaction (Cassuto et al, 1981) . There is also evidence that 5-HT is involved. For example, a combination of 5-HT2 and 5-HTa receptor blockade totally abolishes CT-induced secretion without any influence on the concurrent increase in CAMP (Beubler and Horina, 1990) . A model has been suggested in which CT induces release of 5-HT from enterochromaffin cells, causing prostaglandin E2 formation via 5-HTz receptors and activation of neuronal structures by 5-HTs receptors. 5-HT has also been implicated in diarrhoea caused by Entumoeba histo-Zytica. Cell-free supernatants stimulate calcium-dependent chloride secretion in the colon. Amoebic lysates were found to contain high concentrations of 5-HT and the secretory response could be inhibited by the 5-HT antagonist bufotenine (McGowan et al, 1983) .",

Until recently, it was thought that each organism had one main pathogenic mechanism. This is now known not to be the case. Vibrio cholerae, for example, was thought to induce secretory diarrhoea by producing cholera toxin (CT). It is now known that at least three toxins are produced, that the enteric nervous system is important in mediating the response, and that 5HT is probably involved. Similarly, the notion that Yersinia enterocolitica produces diarrhoea solely by damaging the small intestinal mucosa is incorrect. The organism possesses at least one further, and very subtle, virulence mechanism. The attractive past classification of organisms on the basis of their main pathogenic mechanism has therefore become progressively harder, and is no longer possible. In what follows each organism is considered singly.",

Severe secretory diarrhoea is the hallmark of the disease. Infected patients may pass up to 20 units of stool per day, with sodium and potassium concentrations similar to those in plasma. Despite massive secretion, there is no histological evidence of epithelial damage. The structure and mechanism of cholera toxin are now well understood, although new insights continue to be obtained. After colonization of the small intestine, V. cholerae releases an 84-kDa enterotoxin (CT) comprising five identical B subunits and the catalytically active A subunit (AI peptide linked to an A2 peptide by a disulphide bond; Figure 2 ). The B chains of CT bind irreversibly with GM1 ganglioside on the microvillous membrane and remain there, while the Al peptide enters the cell and activates adenylate cyclase. The A2 subunit may position the Ai peptide within the B-subunit ring structure and/or enable passage of the A1 unit across the cell membrane. V. chblerae produces a neuraminidase which catalyses the conversion of higher-order gangliosides to GMt. Neuraminidase may therefore produce locally high concentrations of GM1 receptor, thereby enhancing the binding and the pathological effects on water and electrolyte fluxes (Galen et al, 1992) . It seems likely that the lag of up to 60 min between B-subunit attachment and changes in ion transport is accounted for by the time taken for the Ai subunit to penetrate the cell membrane (Fishman, 1980) .",

Al catalyses the transfer of the ADP-ribose moiety from nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) to an arginine side chain of the a-subunit of Gs ( Figure 5 ). This ADP ribosylation inhibits the GTPase activity of Gs and thereby inhibits its inbuilt deactivation. Consequently, the Gs OL subunit remains permanently in the active form and adenylate cyclase is continually activated (Cassel and Selinger, 1977) . Toxin-catalysed ADP ribosylation is stimulated in vitro by a family of guanine nucleotide-binding proteins, termed ADP-ribosylation factors (Moss and Vaughan, 1991) , which serve as allosteric activators of the toxin. As a result of adenylate cyclase activation, apical chloride channels open and sodium chloride absorption is inhibited.

This has now been identified (Fasano et al, 1991) and its gene has been cloned (Baudry et al, 1992) . Culture supernatants of CT-negative V. cholerae strains were found to contain a toxin which increased small intestinal permeability by altering intracellular tight junctions (zonula occludens) ( Figure 6 ). The ability to produce toxin (ZOT) correlates with diarrhoeagenicity in humans. The toxin is reversible, heat-labile and sensitive to protease digestion. The gene encoding ZOT has now been cloned. The DNA sequence predicts a molecular mass of 44.8 kDa. The ZOT gene encoding the new toxin is immediately upstream of the operon encoding CT (Baudry et al, 1992) . ZOT is important on two counts. It has a very unusual mode of action and may be the first bacterial product capable of reversibly altering tight junctions. It also has implications for oral vaccine development, as ZOT may well be the cause of continuing symptoms seen during vaccine trials to date.",

However, following the cloning and expression of cDNAs encoding cell surface receptors for the atria1 natriuretic peptides (ANPs), the concept of receptor-guanylyl cyclases has emerged. It is now clear that in the case of ANP, binding sites for hormones and the guanylyl cyclase catalytic activity reside on the same protein separated by a single transmembrane domain (Chang et al, 1989) . De Sauvage et al (1991) reported the first identification of a human STa receptor. The receptor retains the same overall structure as ANP receptors, but does not itself respond to ANP. Cells overexpressing the STa receptor bind STa with high affinity and respond with a 50-fold increase in cellular cGMP levels. As a number of natriuretic hormone receptors have now been identified, it seems possible that there may also be other STa receptors.",

Major insights have recently been gained into the mechanism of the attaching and effacing lesion in enterocytes which follows EPEC colonization. EPEC stimulate protein kinase activity in enterocytes, leading to phosphorylation of myosin light chain, an integral cytoskeletal component (Baldwin et al, 1990; Manjarrez-Herrendez et al, 1992) . This phosphorylation leads to alterations in cell shape and in actin organisation (Knutton et al, 1989) . EPEC infection also leads to raised intracellular calcium concentrations, and it seems likely that the formation of the characteristic lesion is due to calcium activation of the actin depolymerizing protein villin, leading to accumulation of actinomyosin within the lesion (Baldwin et al, 1991) . At present it is unclear whether raised intracellular calcium concentrations also lead to phosphorylation of other cell membrane proteins involved in electrolyte transport across the brush border membrane. One plausible hypothesis is that stored intracellular calcium is released by inositol 1,4,5triphosphate (IPa) (Figure 4 ). For example, dantrolene, an inhibitor of calcium release from IPa-sensitive stores, will also abolish the increase in cytosolic calcium seen following EPEC infection. Moreover, another second messenger, also generated by phospholipase C, diacylglycerol, activates calcium-and phospolipiddependent protein kinase C, an enzyme of considerable importance in regulating ion fluxes (Figure 4 ).",

E. coli haemolysin is transiently inserted into lipid membranes, forming monomeric ion-specific pores that allow influx of calcium. In contrast to EPEC, in which intracellular calcium is increased following mobilization from intracellular stores, EAggEC haemolysin appears to increase intracellular calcium from external calcium. Myosin light-chain phosphorylation was also produced by culture with a supernatant of EAggEC strains, while heating again abolished this activity. It seems likely that the observed phospho-rylation is due to calcium-dependent kinases, such as myosin light-chain kinase.

This invasive property depends on expression of several outer membrane proteins, structural genes for which are found on 140-MDa enteroinvasive plasmids that are almost identical to the plasmids in Shigella flexneri (Harris et al, 1982) . Watery diarrhoea frequently precedes dysentery in EIEC infection, and may occur in the absence of bloody diarrhoea. Recently it has been shown that EIEC also produce low levels of Vero cell cytotoxins that are distinct from Shiga-like toxin I or II of enterohaemorrhagic E. coli (EHEC). Secretory activity in EIEC culture supernatants was also demonstrated in rabbit ileal loops and in Ussing chambers. Curing the 140-MDa invasiveness plasmid from an EIEC strain did not diminish enterotoxin production. The enterotoxin is 68-80 kDa in size and is distinct from EIEC cytotoxin (Fasano et al, 1990 ).",

A plasmid locus virG is necessary for reinfection of adjacent cells. Subsequently, the host cell is killed by Shigella, in a process which involves a rapid fall in intracellular ATP and an increase in pyruvate, both consistent with a block in cellular respiration.

Campylobacter jejuni is known to produce two toxins, an enterotoxin and a cytotoxin (Johnson and Lior, 1984) . The enterotoxin is similar to CT in many ways (Ruiz-Palacios et al, 1983) and activates adenylate cyclase. At present, the role of these toxins in human disease is uncertain, but it has been suggested that differing toxin production may predict the major clinical manifestations of infection (Klipstein et al, 1985) .

            "text": "It is now well recognized that the severe disease which may accompany antibiotic administration is often due to a pseudomembranous colitis caused by C. difjicile infection (Bartlett, 1978) . Clostridium dijfficile produces four toxins which affect the gut: toxin A, an enterotoxin; toxin B, a cytotoxin; a heat-labile toxin (Banno et al, 1984) ; and a motility-altering factor (Justus et al, 1982) . The gene for toxin A has now been cloned and sequenced (Dove et al, 1990) . AND A. S. McNEISH Toxin A is responsible for changes in intestinal ion transport, reduced nutrient absorption from the small intestine and the induction of marked electrolyte secretion (Triadafilopoulos et al, 1987) . The secretory changes are not associated with increased tissue concentrations of cyclic nucleotides (Guandalini et al, 1988) ) although the changes may be calcium-dependent (Triadafilopoulos et al, 1989) . Toxin A also has cytotoxic properties: instillation into rabbit ileal loops leads to enterocyte death and infiltration of the lamina propria with neutrophils, features which distinguish it from cholera toxin (Triadafilopoulos et al, 1987) . There is some evidence that toxin A may kill cells by altering the organization of microfilaments and microtubules (Fiorentine et al, 1990) . Toxin B is probably responsible for the pseudomembranous exudate which characterizes the infection clinically (Bartlett, 1978; Viscidi and Bartlett, 1981) . AEROMONAS Aeromonas spp. were first proposed as enteric pathogens in humans more than 30 years ago (Martinez-Silva et al, 1961) and many subsequent clinical reports support the association. However, acceptance of the role of Aeromonas in human diarrhoeal disease (Khardori and Fainstein, 1988) has not been universal, partly because of the complexity of the taxonomy of aeromonads and their precise identification, and the use of inappropriate procedures for their isolation (Janda and Duffey, 1988) and methods to establish their diarrhoeagenicity (Morgan et al, 1985) . The strongest evidence in support of Aeromonas spp. as enteric pathogens comes from adequately controlled epidemiological studies, e.g. in Western Australia, where 11% of children with diarrhoea had enterotoxigenic Aeromonas detected in comparison with less than 1% in the control group (Burke et al, 1983) . There are now many reports of patients with diarrhoea in whom Aeromonus was the only recognized pathogen and several reviews on Aeromonus-associated diarrhoea are available (Freij, 1984; Agger et al, 1985; Agger, 1986; Burke and Gracey, 1986; Sack et al, 1988; San Joaquin and Pickett, 1988) . Aeromonas usually causes mild, self-limiting watery diarrhoea but can cause dysenteric symptoms (bloody diarrhoea with mucus) or persistent diarrhoea. The disease has a summer peak and may be water-borne. Differences in biotype and virulence characteristics between environmental and clinical isolates suggest that only some strains which occur in water are potentially pathogenic (Burke et al, 1984) . The taxonomy of Aeromonas spp. has been revised recently and the genus now includes ten species (A. hydrophila, A. sobria, A. caviae, A. salmonicida, A. media, A. veronii, A. schubertii, A. eucrenophilu, A. jandaei and A. trotu) (Carnahan et al, 1991) , most of which have been associated with disease in humans (Altwegg et al, 1990) . These micro-organisms are capable of producing a wide range of toxins, which is compatible with the scope of gastrointestinal and extraintestinal illness which Aeromonas infections can cause (Rolston, 1988) . Recognized Aeromonas toxins include cytotonic and cytotoxic enterotoxins and cytolytic haemolysins (Burke and Gracey, 1986) . The determinants of enterotoxic, cytotoxic and haemolytic activity are believed to be located at three different segments of the A. hydrophilu chromosome (Chakraborty et al, 1984) . The mechanism(s) of action of Aeromonas enterotoxins are not known. The cytotonic toxin increases steroid secretion and CAMP in Y 1 cells and rabbit intestinal cells (Ljungh et al, 1982) ; however, mucosal damage from the cytotoxic effects may also play a role. Although invasiveness does not occur in the guinea-pig, keratoconjuctivitis (Serbny) test, invasion of the subepithelial space in rabbit ileal loops (Pitarangsi et al, 1982) and invasion in tissue culture cells in vitro have been reported (Lawson et al, 1985) , which may have relevance to those patients who have dysenteric illnesses. Aeromonas spp. can adhere to intestinal brush borders (Levett and Daniel, 1988) , and agglutination of erythrocytes or yeast cells has been reported (Adams et al, 1983) although the pathogenic significance of this is uncertain.",

Invasiveness is encoded by a chromosomal inv gene which specifies a 103-kDa protein, invasin. The inv gene is not expressed by non-pathogenic strains, which are unable to penetrate intact epithelial cells. An additional chromosomal locus, the ail locus, specifies attachment and invasiveness (Millan et al, 1988 (Millan et al, , 1989 .

Glucose-coupled sodium absorption was impaired, but there was no active chloride secretion. Abnormal epithelial cell renewal, as seen in viral gastroenteritis, did not seem to be the cause of these changes. Rather, they were due to a direct effect of the organism or its products.

Indeed, bacteria may well interact with host cells in a much more sophisticated way than previously recognized (Clemens et al, 1991) . Tyrosine kinases are a family of enzymes responsible for tyrosine phosphorylation, the extent of which plays an integral part in the regulation of the cell cycle and the transduction of growth signals. For example, the binding of insulin to its receptor switches on tyrosine kinase activity and the multiple effects of insulin are probably mediated by the phosphorylation of tyrosine residues on target proteins. Similarly, the epidermal growth factor receptor contains a cytosolic tyrosine kinase domain; many oncogenes also act through tyrosine kinase.",

Moreover, conversion of a cysteine residue to alanine in the catalytic domain of YopH abolished PTPase activity in Y. pseudoturberculosis and significantly reduced its virulence in a mouse model (Bliska et al, 1991) . Infection of macrophages by Yersinia also causes the dephosphorylation of several phosphotyrosine-containing proteins.
