            "text": "Blood transfusions have many things in common with fluid therapy. Like crystalloid and colloid solutions, blood products are not used to treat disease; they are supportive therapies given to correct deficiencies in the patient until the underlying disease process can be treated. For example, a red blood cell transfusion is given to replace red blood cells lost as a result of a traumatic laceration. The transfusion of red blood cells increases the oxygen-carrying capacity of the blood, allowing for surgical repair of the laceration; it is not the primary treatment for hemorrhage. Likewise, sodium chloride is used to replace sodium, chloride, and water in a dehydrated patient with hypoadrenocorticism until adrenal hormones can be replaced.",

Volume overload, electrolyte disturbances, and transmission of infection can occur from administration of pathogen-contaminated blood products or fluids. 31, 66, 130 Despite the potential negative effects of transfusion, most veterinarians view it as lifesaving therapy, allowing the transfusion recipient to receive other necessary treatments such as surgery, chemotherapy, or medical care. 56 Three major differences exist between the more commonly used fluids and blood products. The differences between crystalloid or colloid solutions and blood products are their immunogenicity, availability, and cost. The immunogenicity of blood products stems from the proteins and cellular material in the blood. Because crystalloid solutions lack proteins and cellular material, they are not considered immunogenic; however, certain colloid solutions such as hydroxyethyl starch have been reported to cause acute anaphylaxis in rare instances in humans. 96 The mechanism of this reaction is unknown.",

When collected from the donor, it contains all the elements of blood: red blood cells, white blood cells, platelets, coagulation factors, immunoglobulins, and albumin. Whole blood can be transfused into the recipient as it is collected from the donor, but it is neither a specific therapy nor an economical use of blood. The optimal method of preservation of blood for transfusion is to separate whole blood into its component parts. Appropriate use of blood components not only conserves the products but also allows the most specific and safe product to be administered for each patient. When blood components are used instead of whole blood for transfusion, two dogs can benefit from 1 unit of whole blood. A plasma transfusion counteracts the anticoagulant effects of rodenticide intoxication in one dog, and red blood cells from the same donor provides enhanced oxygen-carrying capacity in a second, anemic dog. Component transfusions also have been used in cats, but preparation of components is more difficult because of the small volume of blood collected from donor cats. 23, 53, 68, 99 Production of components is not feasible for most veterinary practices. Most will purchase their blood inventory because they lack the time and equipment to recruit donors, and collect and process whole blood into components. Blood components predominate in the inventory of commercial blood banks, requiring veterinarians to become familiar with their usage.",

Preparation of blood components from whole blood requires that the blood from the donor be collected into the anticoagulant-containing bag of a multibag plastic blood collection system. The whole blood then is separated into packed red blood cells (PRBCs) and plasma by differential centrifugation in a refrigerated blood bank centrifuge, and the plasma is transferred into one or more of the attached satellite bags via the sterile tubing linking the bags. The bags are separated, and PRBCs are stored in a refrigerator and plasma is stored in a freezer. Blood collected into glass bottles is not amenable to centrifugation and cannot be processed into components. Additionally, storage of canine blood in a glass bottle results in lower levels of 2,3-diphosphoglycerate and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) than blood stored in plastic bags; consequently, plastic bags are the preferred storage container for blood. 28 The most commonly used blood products, their indications, and suggested dosages are described later. The dosage of a blood product depends on the physical state of the patient and the response of the patient to the treatment: in essence, the treatment is \"to effect.\"",

When whole blood is centrifuged to produce plasma and PRBCs, the anticoagulant segregates with the plasma fraction. Fresh frozen plasma contains all clotting factors, which, if frozen at \u00c030 C in a blood bank freezer, maintains activity for 12 months. 121 Fresh frozen plasma maintained in an upright freezer at \u00c020 C maintains clotting factor activity for 6 months. When frozen, the plastic storage bag becomes brittle and if not carefully handled can crack, rendering the plasma unusable. For this reason, plasma is stored in special boxes to protect the plastic bag and must be handled carefully before transfusion. If plasma is thawed, and not transfused, it can be refrozen within 1 hour of thawing without loss of coagulation factor activity. 131 Fresh frozen plasma has been used to treat a wide variety of clinical patients. A retrospective analysis of fresh frozen plasma usage in dogs identified multiple indications for administration of fresh frozen plasma, including replacement of coagulation factors, albumin, a 2 -macroglobulin, and immunoglobulin despite the recommendation that fresh frozen plasma should not be used as a source of albumin, for volume expansion, or nutritional support. 75, 87 Calculations suggest 45 mL/kg of plasma would need to be given to increase albumin serum concentration by 1 g/dL. 120 In cases of coagulation factor deficiencies, plasma should be given to effect (i.e., until active bleeding ceases). 70 For the treatment of coagulation disorders, 6 to 10 mL/kg is the recommended starting dosage. Multiple doses may be required to control bleeding because of the short half-life of clotting factors, especially in patients with disseminated intravascular coagulation.

Most report a single administration of the drug at a dosage of 0.5 to 1.0 g/kg, but in some cases the dose is administered three times on 3 consecutive days. 8, 9, 113, 129 Because of its immunomodulatory properties, transfusion of hIVIG has become more common in veterinary patients. 94 The two major diseases treated with hIVIG have been immune-mediated hemolytic anemia (IMHA) and immune-mediated thrombocytopenia (ITP), but hIVIG has also been used to treat some immune-mediated dermatologic disorders as well. 8, 9, 113, 129 Randomized, controlled prospective studies of glucocorticoids with and without hIVIG for the treatment of IMHA and ITP have been published. 8, 129 The ITP study demonstrated reduction in platelet recovery time without a concurrent increase in associated charges in the group randomized to receive glucocorticoids and hIVIG. The IMHA study did not show an advantage to treatment with hIVIG and glucocorticoids compared with glucocorticoids alone, but the study was underpowered to distinguish a difference between the two treatment groups. Administration of hIVIG to normal dogs promoted a hypercoagulable state, but in clinically ill dogs causality of thromboembolism is difficult to determine given the complexity of diseases undergoing hIVIG transfusion. 100, 116 ",

Maintaining a donor on the premises is advantageous because they are readily available for donation and their health status and disease exposure can be controlled, but the expense associated with feeding, housing, and caring for a blood donor is significant. 54 Volunteer blood donor programs have replaced many on-site blood donors. 14, 59 Collecting blood from stray animals is unsafe because infectious disease exposure and health status are unknown.",

            "text": "For nearly 60 years, the best blood donor was believed to be a large, quiet dog not requiring anesthesia during blood collection. 78 The current recommendation is unchanged. A canine blood donor weighing more than 27 kg can safely donate 450 mL of blood in one donation, allowing collection of blood into commercially manufactured blood collection bags designed to facilitate sterile processing of components. Dogs weighing 27 kg or more have been shown to consistently donate 1 unit of blood for 2 years at 3-week intervals. 92 Dogs selected as donors also should have an easily accessible jugular vein to facilitate venipuncture. Prior pregnancy does not exclude female dogs from donation because pregnancy does not induce alloantibodies. 12 Greyhounds have been promoted as ideal blood donors because of their gentle disposition, high hematocrits, and lean body type, which simplifies blood collection. 45 Many greyhounds are euthanized because of poor racing performance, and these dogs are available from racetracks, breeders, and rescue organizations. 36 Blood banks choosing greyhounds as blood donors should be aware of certain breed idiosyncrasies that will impact on the management of a greyhound donor. The greyhound idiosyncrasy most important in transfusion medicine is the high red blood cell count, PCV and hemoglobin concentration, and low white blood cell counts and platelet count compared with mixed breed dogs. 91, 109 Greyhounds in Florida have a 46% seroprevalence of babesiosis. 111 Because the geographic origin of greyhounds serving as blood donors cannot always be determined, all greyhounds being screened as donors should have serologic testing for Babesia canis performed, and dogs with positive titers should be excluded as donors. Greyhounds with negative titers against B. canis should have B. canis polymerase chain reaction (PCR) performed, and if the test is positive, the dog should be excluded as a donor.",

In a laboratory setting, antibodies against DEA 1.2 have been reported to cause transfusion reactions, but clinical reports of hemolytic transfusion reactions mediated by anti-DEA 1.2 antibodies are lacking.

One feline blood group system has been identified with three blood types: A, B, and AB (see Box 24-2) and recently a new common red blood cell antigen, Mik has been identified. 6, 128 Unlike dogs, cats have naturally occurring alloantibodies. Type A cats have naturally occurring alloantibodies against type B cells and type B cats against type A cells. 38 Cats of blood type B have strong hemagglutinating antibodies of the IgM type against type A cells, and cats of blood type A have weak hemolysin and hemagglutinating antibodies of the IgM and IgG type against type B cells. The clinical significance of these alloantibodies is threefold in transfusion medicine. First and most importantly, a cat may have a transfusion reaction without sensitization from a previous transfusion; second, type A kittens born to a type B queen are at risk for neonatal isoerythrolysis 21 ; and third, the antibodies are useful in determining the blood type of a cat. Mik appears to be a common red blood cell antigen. Only a few cats lacking Mik have been identified and they all produce anti-Mik alloantibodies. Donors of both type A and type B blood must be available because there is no universal donor in cats. Incompatible transfusions result in shortened red blood cell survival and potentially death in the transfusion recipient; therefore the serologic compatibility between recipient and donor must be determined before every transfusion in cats. 38 Donors of type A blood are easy to find because more than 99% of the domestic cats in the United States are type A. 42 The prevalence of domestic cats with type B blood varies geographically. In the United States, the western states have the highest percentage of type B cats, 4% to 6%. 42 Australia has the highest reported percentage of type B cats in their domestic cat population, 73%. 6 In Europe, the frequency of blood type B in domestic cats varies from 0% in Finland, 14.9% in France, and 24.6% in Turkey. 3, 41 Some purebred cats have a higher frequency of type B in their population. 39 The British shorthair, Devon rex and Turkish van have been reported to have the highest proportion of type B individuals, approximately 50% to 60%. 4 The Siamese, Oriental shorthair, Burmese, Tonkinese, American shorthair, and Norwegian forest cat breeds have not been reported to have any members with type B blood. Blood type AB is extremely rare, occurring in 0.14% of cats in the United States and Canada. 46 Fortunately, a type AB donor is not required to successfully transfuse a type AB cat.

Infectious disease screening of canine and feline blood donors varies within the different geographic regions of the United States and with the breed of the blood donor. An American College of Veterinary Internal Medicine consensus statement, developed by a committee consisting of members of the Infectious Disease Study Group and the Association of Veterinary Hematology and Transfusion Medicine should serve as the guideline for donor screening. 124 Organisms infectious to dogs and known to be transmitted by blood transfusion include B. canis, B. gibsoni, Haemobartonella canis, and Leishmania sp. 31 124 Dogs should not donate if they are ill or have fever, vomiting, or diarrhea; using donors with these clinical signs has resulted in Yersinia enterocolitica contamination of human units of blood. 32 Organisms infectious to cats and known to be transmitted by blood transfusion include: feline leukemia virus (FeLV), feline immunodeficiency virus (FIV) Bartonella henselae, Anaplasma phagocytophilum, Ehrlichia spp. and Neorickettsia spp., and the organisms formerly classified as Haemobartonella sp. (Mycoplasma haemofelis and Candidatus Mycoplasma haemominutum). 33, 49 Potential donor cats should be screened for FeLV and FIV. Because the prepatent period for FeLV infection can be 3 months, cats being considered as donors should be screened monthly for FeLV for 3 consecutive months. Testing for FIV antibodies can be performed simultaneously. Bartonella henselae is an emerging feline infectious disease and has been transmitted to cats by infected blood. 69 The use of cats with positive serology or cultures for B. henselae as blood donors is controversial and eliminating these cats from the donor pool is the safest approach. Testing for hemoplasma should include both light microscopy and PCR, and infected cats should be eliminated from the donor pool. 33 Screening of donor cats for feline infectious peritonitis (FIP) is problematic because there is no reliable test to identify the FIP-causing coronavirus. Feline blood donors should be screened for infection with Cytauxzoon felis and the agents causing feline ehrlichiosis if they reside in or are known to have traveled to endemic locations.",

When blood typing is unavailable, crossmatching will administration of an incompatible transfusion due to A, B, or Mik alloantibodies. When crossmatching is performed with a known type A donor, an incompatible major crossmatch strongly suggests the potential recipient is a type B or a Mik negative cat because of the naturally occurring alloantibodies in these cats. If cat plasma is administered, it should be the same blood type as the recipient because plasma will contain anti-A, anti-B, and anti-Mik antibodies. Crossmatching the donor to the recipient cat will prevent a reaction because of A, B, or Mik alloantibodies.",

The most common reason for an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction in human patients is clerical error-the wrong unit of blood is released from the blood bank or a unit of blood is given to a patient who was not intended to receive a transfusion. 110 In veterinary medicine, it is crucial to confirm that the blood comes from the correct species of blood donor in addition to being typed and matched to the patient requiring a transfusion. The contents of the bag also should be examined for normal color and consistency. Bacterially contaminated blood often appears brown or purple because of deoxygenation, hemolysis, and formation of methemoglobin. 55, 65 Blood and plasma can be administered using several routes. Most commonly, blood is given intravenously. The diameter of the catheter used for transfusion is important in determining the rate of blood flow because blood flows more slowly through a small catheter; however, small diameter catheters have not been associated with increased risk of hemolysis during transfusion. 118 The intraosseous route can be used successfully for administration of blood and plasma. 88 In normal dogs, 93% to 98% of red blood cells administered through an intraosseous catheter are found in the peripheral circulation within 5 minutes. 24 This rapid and simple method is especially useful in animals with vascular collapse and in extremely young puppies and kittens. Special intraosseous catheters are available, but a spinal needle, bone marrow aspiration needle, over-the-needle catheter, or even an ordinary hypodermic needle can be used. Sites for the placement of the intraosseous catheter include the trochanteric fossa of the femur, the medial tibia, and the iliac crest. Blood flows very rapidly through an intraosseous catheter, and rate of administration should be monitored closely. Plasma can be administered intraperitoneally in emergency situations, but red blood cells are slowly and poorly absorbed when administered by this route, and it is not recommended for red blood cell transfusions.",

Warming of blood probably is only necessary if a large volume of blood is to be given or if the recipient is a neonate. For adult animals receiving a single unit of blood, the blood can be administered directly from the refrigerator. Warming blood has the potential for excessive heating, causing red blood cell membrane damage and hemolysis or promoting bacterial growth if contamination is present. Blood warming devices that use dry heat, radio waves, microwaves, or electromagnetic energy are available, but cost often is prohibitive. Refrigerated human blood can be warmed quickly by admixing it with warm (45 C to 60 C) 0.9% saline in a ratio of 1:1 without damage to red blood cells. 61 This method has not been tested for dogs or cats. Once blood is warmed to 37 C, it deteriorates rapidly and, if not used, should be discarded. Fresh frozen plasma must be thawed before transfusion. A method for thawing canine fresh frozen plasma in a microwave oven has been described, but the author has found this unsatisfactory because of uneven heating by household microwave ovens. 60 Plasma can be thawed at room temperature, and if the thawing time needs to be shortened, the plasma can be placed into a plastic bag and thawed in a 37 C water bath. The plastic bag is necessary to prevent contamination of the infusion ports in the water bath. If thawed and not used within 1 hour, it maybe refrozen with out loss of anticoagulant activity. 131 Plasma should be used within 4 hours of thawing or discarded.",

In all animals suspected of having some form of acute transfusion reaction, the transfusion should be stopped and samples of patient blood and urine obtained for baseline evaluation of biochemical, hematologic, and coagulation values. The unit of blood should be inspected to ensure it is from the appropriate species and is the intended unit based on the crossmatch or blood type. A Gram stain and bacterial culture of the blood remaining in the blood bag should be submitted to the laboratory. Urine can be visually inspected to determine the presence or absence of hemoglobin. Rectal temperature of the recipient should be compared with the pretransfusion value. A transfusionassociated fever is defined as an increase in 1 F over the pretransfusion temperature. 118 The cardiovascular system should be monitored by electrocardiogram and blood pressure measurement. Immediate evaluation of serum ionized calcium and potassium concentrations are critical, but certain electrocardiographic changes serve as surrogate markers of hypocalcemia (long QT-interval with a normal heart rate) or hyperkalemia (decreased height of P waves, loss of P waves, or widening of the QRS complex with large T waves) if rapid measurement of serum electrolyte concentrations cannot be obtained. Venous access and blood pressure should be maintained by an infusion of a crystalloid solution such as lactated Ringer's solution or 0.9% NaCl. Intravenous administration of short-acting glucocorticoids may suppress some of the mediators of acute hemolytic transfusion reactions and lessen the clinical progression, but their efficacy in transfusion reactions has not been evaluated in veterinary patients. When the evaluation of a patient with a suspected transfusion reaction suggests that an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction is occurring, the blood typing and crossmatching must be repeated to determine whether a laboratory error is responsible for the reaction.

In clinical situations in the United States, the commercially available blood typing cards for feline types A, B, and AB are commonly used (DMS Laboratories, Inc., Flemington, N.J.). However, when results indicate type AB, the results should be interpreted with caution as the card typing method commonly gives false positive results as type AB when the cat is actually type A. 7 Any cat typed as AB should be confirmed by a second typing method. Gel tube typing tests, available in Europe, but not currently available in the United States, give accurate results when used in cats of type A, B, and AB. A simple immunochromatography method of blood typing has recently become available in the United States. 57 A paper strip impregnated with anti-A and anti-B monoclonal antibodies is placed in a red blood cell solution, allowing the cells to migrate up the strip and bind to the antibodies. Results are rapidly available and easily interpreted. When using any blood Equipment for Performing Crossmatch ) is an ultrapurified, polymerized hemoglobin of bovine origin (13 g/dL) in a modified Ringer's lactate solution with a physiologic pH (7.8). The hemoglobin polymers range in molecular mass from 65 to 500 kDa, with an average of 200 kDa. The viscosity is low compared with blood (1.3 and 3.5 centipoise, respectively), and the solution is isosmotic (300 mOsm/kg) with blood. The concentration of methemoglobin, the inactive form of hemoglobin, is 10%. Oxyglobin can be stored at room temperature or refrigerated (2 C to 30 C) for up to 3 years. Its intravascular half-life is dose dependent (18 to 43 hours, at a dosage of 10 to 30 mL/kg), as measured in healthy dogs. It is expected that more than 90% of the administered dose will be eliminated from the body in 5 to 7 days after infusion. The oxygen half-saturation pressure (P-50) of Oxyglobin is greater than that of canine blood (38 vs. 30 mm Hg, respectively). This increase in P-50 facilitates off-loading of oxygen to the tissues. The hemoglobin is packaged in the deoxygenated state in an overwrap that is impermeable to oxygen. Complications of severe anemia result from poor oxygenation of tissues. Restoration of adequate tissue oxygenation typically is achieved by administering a blood transfusion. Improvement in the clinical signs of anemia results from a corresponding increase in hemoglobin concentration, which in turn increases the arterial oxygen content of the blood. The increased oxygen content of the blood supplied by Oxyglobin also relieves the clinical signs of anemia.",

            "text": "Two prospective randomized trials have evaluated Oxyglobin for the treatment of anemia. 95, 133 One was a multicenter clinical trial for dogs with moderate to severe anemia (PCV, 6% to 23%). 95 Sixty-four dogs in need of blood transfusion were studied, including those with anemia caused by blood loss (n \u00bc 25), hemolysis (n \u00bc 30), or ineffective erythropoiesis (n \u00bc 9). Dogs in both groups were monitored for a decrease in hemoglobin concentration or deterioration in physical condition at which time they received additional oxygen-carrying support. If additional oxygen-carrying support was needed, Oxyglobin-treated dogs received PRBCs (n \u00bc 1), and untreated control dogs received Oxyglobin (n \u00bc 19). Treatment success was defined as the lack of need for additional oxygen-carrying support for 24 hours. The success rate in the 30 treated dogs (95%) was significantly greater than the success rate in the 34 control dogs (32%). This difference between treated and control dogs was significant, regardless of the cause of anemia. The other trial randomized 12 dogs with severe anemia (PCV \u00bc 10% to 20%) secondary to babesiosis to receive either 20 mL/kg of Oxyglobin, or packed red blood cells. 133 Blood gas, acid-base, and blood pressure were objective measures of response to treatment. Similar overall improvements were seen in both the Oxyglobin and PRBC transfusion groups.",

Oxyglobin administration to cats has been retrospectively evaluated. 34, 127 The median dosage was approximately 10 to 11 mL/kg/24 hours. Oxyglobin has also been administered to other species to increase oxygen carrying capacity: mallard duck, miniature horse, and serval cat. 73, 82, 101 One published dosage for birds is 5 mL/kg IV or interosseously for the treatment of shock and for the treatment of shock in small mammals, 2 mL/kg as a 10 to 15 minute intravenous bolus followed by a continuous rate infusion at 0.2 to 0.4 mL/kg/hr. 74 Because it lacks the antigenic red blood cell membrane, Oxyglobin is not only useful in multiple species, but it eliminates some of the pretransfusion testing required with red blood cell transfusions. Blood typing and crossmatching are not necessary because the red blood cell membrane, which is the major cause of transfusion incompatibility, has been removed during the manufacturing process. Repeated dosing of Oxyglobin was reported in both feline retrospective studies. 34, 127 No allergic reactions were reported. A laboratory study of repeated dosing in dogs showed antibodies to Oxyglobin did form, but those antibodies did not decrease binding of oxygen to Oxyglobin and did not result in systemic allergic reactions. 52 Adverse effects of treatment with Oxyglobin are similar in dogs and cats. After treatment, a transient discoloration (yellow, brown, or red) of the mucous membranes, sclera, urine, and sometimes skin occurs. Overexpansion of the vascular volume may occur, especially in normovolemic animals. Rates of administration greater than 10 mL/kg/hr in anemic, clinically ill dogs sometimes resulted in increased central venous pressure, with or without pulmonary edema or other respiratory signs of circulatory overload. Pleural effusion and pulmonary edema were found commonly in cats given Oxyglobin, but evidence was insufficient to directly link either to the administration of Oxyglobin. 34, 127 Cats recently administered blood transfusions or having underlying cardiac disease appear to be more likely to develop pleural effusion and pulmonary edema. Low infusion rates are recommended in these cats (<5 mL/kg/hr). In the canine clinical trial, vomiting occurred in 35% of the treated dogs. Diarrhea, fever, and death also were seen in approximately 15% of Oxyglobin-treated dogs; however, an association with Oxyglobin or the underlying disease could not be determined. These findings were most common in dogs with immune-mediated hemolytic anemia that received Oxyglobin.",

Splenectomy of donor dogs to facilitate identification of B. canis and H. canis carriers is not recommended. In neutered dogs, a single negative test for Brucella canis is adequate. Based on travel history and breed, additional screening for Trypanosoma cruzi, Bartonella vinsonii, B. canis, B. gibsoni, L. donovani, and organisms previously classified as Ehrlichia spp. (Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Anaplasma platys) may be indicated.",
