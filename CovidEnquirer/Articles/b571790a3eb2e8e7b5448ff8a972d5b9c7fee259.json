Several molecular clock and demographic models available in the BEAST package were compared on three avipoxvirus genes (P4b, cnpv186 and DNA polymerase genes), which enabled to determine that avipoxviruses evolved at a rate of 2-8 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 substitution/site/year, in the range of poxviruses previously reported evolution rates. In addition, the date of mean time of divergence of avipoxviruses from a common ancestor was extrapolated to be about 10,000-30,000 years ago, at the same period as modern poxvirus species. Our findings will facilitate epidemiological investigations on avipoxviruses' spread, origin and circulation.",

Although this codivergence seems more likely in the case of papillomaviruses (millions of years of association, (Bernard et al., 2006) ), it is less probable or at least more recent in the case of newly emerging viruses (e.g. the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome Coronavirus evolution (Peiris et al., 2004) ).

Only the oldest sequence was kept when identical sequences were available. Table 1 summarizes the details of included APV sequences. For each gene, DNA sequences were translated to amino acid (aa) sequences using BioEdit 7.2.5 (Hall, 1999) , the aa sequences were aligned with ClustalX 2.1 (Larkin et al., 2007) , and the original BioEdit format aa sequences were aligned with the ClustalX aa aligned sequences before they were reverse-translated in an aligned nucleotide file using BioEdit. The sequence of the APV pigeon/CAPM V-101/CZE/1965 P4b gene (accession number: GU982736) was removed due to many deletions resulting in non-functional short proteins; the P4b sequences of APV isolates from Hawaii EL1.1H1900, APAP16.2H03, and HAAMB.07H02 (accession numbers EF568402 to EF568404) were also removed because they were too short (116 bp). In order to exclude recombinant sequences (as done in Firth et al., 2010) which can bias the calculation, possible recombinant sequences were searched with the Recombinant Identification Program (RIP) (www.hiv.lanl.gov).

We used empirical base frequencies and three partitions into codon positions. Different combinations of demographic models and clock models were compared as suggested (Drummond and Rambaut, 2007) : constant size or extended Bayesian skyline plot models, strict or relaxed (lognormal or exponential) clocks. At least 200 million MCMC iterations were run for each gene and each demographic model/clock model combination. Subsampling was performed every 10,000 generations to decrease autocorrelation between model parameter samples. The estimation of parameters and divergence time was carried out using Tracer (http://beast.bio.ed.ac.uk/Tracer). A correct mixing of MCMC was verified by effective sampling size (ESS) calculations available in Tracer. The best fitting model was also assessed using ''Model Comparison'' available in Tracer and choosing the lowest Akaike's information criterion (AICM) value. The dN/dS ratios (x) were calculated using the single-likelihood ancestor (SLAC) method available in the HyPhy package available on the http://www.datamonkey.org/ server (Kosakovsky Kosakovsky Pond and Frost, 2005) .",

To assess both substitution rate per site per year and TMRCA, different combinations of demographic models and clock models were compared: constant size or extended Bayesian skyline plot models, strict or relaxed (lognormal or exponential) clocks. The lowest AICM values were obtained with a relaxed exponential clock and the extended Bayesian skyline plot model for both cnpv186 and the DNA polymerase genes (AICM values of 11,673.74 \u00b1 0.11 standard error (SE) and 7,316.26 \u00b1 0.12 SE for cnpv186 and DNA polymerase genes, respectively, Table 2 ). For the P4b gene, the AICM value was slightly lower with a strict clock and the Extended Bayesian Skyline Plot model than with a relaxed exponential clock and the extended Bayesian skyline plot model (AICM values of 8, 492.42 \u00b1 0.21 SE and 8, 493.49 \u00b1 0.44 SE, respectively) . We however decided to use the same combination for our three genes for consistency: a relaxed exponential clock and the extended Bayesian skyline plot model (Table 2 ). Analyses were also performed using the General Time Reversible substitution model with gamma-distributed rate and invariant sites (GTR + G + I, best fitted model as per MrModeltest), which gave similar results (data not shown).",

            "text": "The present study aimed at assessing the substitution rate of APV and at estimating their TMRCA. We compared several clock and demographic models available in the BEAST package and found that APV evolved at a rate of 2-8 \u00c2 10 \u00c05 substitution/site/year. The date of mean time of divergence of APV from a common ancestor was extrapolated to be about 10,000-30,000 years ago. We observed a threefold difference between substitution rates and TMRCA of P4b on the one hand and cnpv186 and DNA polymerase on the other hand (Table 2) . DNA polymerase encodes a polymerase protein, cnpv186 an immunodominant protein, and P4b a core protein (Tulman et al., 2004) . The slower evolution rate of P4b is therefore somewhat surprising: while viable DNA polymerase and cnpv186 mutants may be more difficult to generate, one could expect more flexibility on a core protein. The selection pressure may however be lower on P4b than on its counterparts. Esposito et al. showed that the genes coding for host range and virulence proteins vary the most for Smallpox Virus compared to genes involved in virus replication, suggesting that these genes are most targeted by selection pressure (Esposito, 2006) . But the large confidence intervals (95% HPD) associated with the values we found (within the range of what had been calculated in previous studies) does not show a statistically significant difference (Table 2) . Therefore, it is not possible to draw any conclusion. In addition, our analysis has a bias as it was carried out on three genes only: a very small fragment of avipoxvirus genomes (260-306 kbp). Cnpv186, P4b and DNA polymerase genes were selected on the basis of available sequence data but might have a substitution rate different from the rest of the avipoxvirus genome. The molecular clock analyses of avipoxviruses will gain in precision when more sequence data (and more full genomes) become available. To run the analyses with as much data as possible, we extrapolated sampling years for some sequences. This also represents a bias. When excluding the sequence data for which no collection year was available, the substitution rates and TMRCA results for P4b and DNA polymerase genes were almost unchanged, but cnpv186 gene had a tenfold lower calculated substitution rate and a TMRCA of 2,274 years only. McLysaght et al. (2003) tested poxvirus genes for selection acting on the evolution of genes by looking at synonymous and nonsynonymous mutations. They observed positive selection for genes involved in virulence or for gene candidates for host-pathogen interaction (McLysaght et al., 2003) . Indeed, positive selection of viruses could also contribute to an increase of substitution rate, which can be observed either for viruses inducing a strong host immune response or for those which have been the object of vaccination or intervention campaigns (Firth et al., 2010) . While the houbara bustards we focus on in our projects in Morocco, the United Arab Emirates, Kazakhstan and Uzbekistan are vaccinated annually (Le Loc'h et al., 2015) , APV vaccination is not systematic worldwide, thus making selection pressure assessment difficult. Our selection pressure analyses demonstrated a purifying selection of the three APV genes we studied with x values ranging between 0.065 and 0.200, suggesting that a non-synonymous mutation has only 7-20% as much chance as a synonymous mutation of being fixed in the population. This finding might correlate with relatively weak vaccination/intervention pressure and may be linked with the low host specificity of avipoxviruses. Vaccination is likely not the sole factor driving potential selection pressure and ecological and epidemiological factors should be further investigated for a proper understanding of the observed selection phenomenon. Li et al. (2007) worked on Smallpox Virus evolution and linked sequence data and the first description of smallpox in humans (4th century AD in China; suspicions of smallpox as early as 1122 BC). Their dating was based on time-structured sequence data (207-231 years before present (ybp) using strict and relaxed clocks, respectively; these values were discarded for obvious discrepancy with historical and epidemiological data), or with calibration with historical records of smallpox infection (1400-6300 ybp) (Li et al., 2007) . However, the latter method proved erroneous as epidemiological records may not correlate with real origin of a pathogen (Hughes et al., 2010; Shchelkunov, 2009 ). The absence of ancient epidemiological data on APV prevented us from including any historical calibration in our analyses.",

            "text": "Several research teams have in the past warned evolutionary biologists studying DNA viruses about the biases associated with the use of heterochronous phylogenetic modeling designed for faster evolving RNA pathogens (Firth et al., 2010) . In addition, it was shown that molecular evolution is artificially accelerated on short timescales (Ho et al., 2007) . Indeed our datasets contain very recent sequences only (from 1865 to now) compared to the TMCRA of APV. Hence our results should be considered with caution. But Babkin and Shchelkunov estimated that Poxviridae evolve at a rate of 0.9-1.2 \u00c2 10 -6 substitutions/site/year. They calculated the ancestors of poxviruses, orthopoxviruses, and modern poxvirus species dated approximately 500,000, 300,000, and 14,000 years, respectively (Babkin and Shchelkunov, 2006) . The evolution rate of APV estimated in the present study is therefore within the range of what was observed for poxviruses. The divergence between APV clades (canarypox-like viruses, fowlpox-like viruses, and psittacinepox-like viruses) is as old as the divergence among modern poxvirus species. Our results therefore suggest that APV may keep their ''Genus'' classification and not become a sub-family as proposed in the past (Jarmin et al., 2006) , even if taxonomic classifications could not be based solely on the time of divergence. In addition, when Firth et al. tried to account for the specificity of double stranded DNA genomes in evolution calculations, their most robust virus model (with the different clock and demographic models tested) was Variola virus, suggesting that heterochronous phylogenetic modeling may be used for poxviruses evolution calculations (Firth et al., 2010) . They however emphasized that the TMRCA calculated for Variola virus based on the high substitution rates observed were likely erroneous. Our TMRCA values should really be considered as first estimates and not overinterpretated.",

C. undulata/MA/2009/LN795881 interestingly clustered in sub-clade B2 (sequence identical to C. undulata/ MA/2011/LK021679 described in (Le Loc'h et al., 2014)) whereas C. undulata/MA/2009/LN795880 (sequence identical to C. undulata/MA/2011/LK021670 described in (Le Loc'h et al., 2014)) and C. undulata/MA/2009/LK021680 clustered in a distinct sub-clade (B1). The two sub-clades showed a divergence 3,455 (95% HPD: 222-27,041) years ago which is not compatible with an on-site evolution of the virus. Selection pressure analyses showed that P4b, cnpv186 and DNA polymerase genes were under purifying selection with x (dN/dS) values of 0.067 (with a 95% confidence interval (CI) of 0.057-0.078), 0.200 (95% CI: 0.183-0.219), and 0.065 (95% CI: 0.055-0.076) for P4b, cnpv186 and DNA polymerase genes, respectively.
