Maximum titers of infectious virus (-10' PFU/ml) were observed at 12 hr p.i., while incorporation of PI-Ijuridine into virus-specific RNA became detectable at 4 hr pi. and increased to reach a maximum rate at 8 hr p.i. This RNA was labeled between 2.5 and 7 hr p.i. and isolated from infected cells. About 44% bound to oligo(dT)-cellulose; this material was denatured using glyoxal and dimethyl sulfoxide and analyzed by electrophoresis in a 1% agarose-urea gel. Six virus-specific RNA species were found having the following molecular weights: 4.3 X lo6 (RNAl), 1.3 X 10' (RNAB), 0.9 X l@ (RNAS), 0.7 X 10' (RNA4). 0.3 X 10' (RNA5), and 0.2 X lo6 (RNA@. RNA1 comigrated with the viral genome. Artifacts caused by defective interfering particles or breakdown of RNA were excluded. Subsequently, the target sizes of the templates for the synthesis of the genome-sized RNA and the five subgenomic RNAs were determined by uv transcription mapping. Infected cells were irradiated at 6.5 hr p.i. The effect of increasing uv doses on the RNA synthesis was determined by quantitation of the individual RNAs after separation by agarose gel electrophoresis. The uv target sizes calculated for the templates for RNAs 2-5 were very close to the physical size of RNAl. The target size of the template of RNA6 was smaller (2.8 X lo6 daltons), although much greater than its physical size. The data are consistent with a model in which the individual RNAs are derived from a larger precursor RNA molecule. The consequences of these findings for the taxonomy of Togaviridae are discussed.",

The genome of EAV is a single-stranded, infectious RNA with a molecular weight of 4 x lo6 ( Van der Zeijst et al., 1975) . Three virion proteins have been described, a nucleocapsid protein of 12,000 molecular weight, a 14,000 nonglycosylated envelope protein, and a 21,000 glycosylated envelope protein (Zeegers et al., 1976 ; see also Brinton, 1980; Horzinek, 1981) . On the basis of these data EAV has been classified as nonarthropod-borne member of the Togaviridae family, not belonging to one of the existing genera (Porterfield et al., 1978) . In this paper we describe our studies on the replication mechanism of EAV. Multiple polyadenylated virus-specific RNAs were detected in virus-infected cells and VAN BERLO, HORZINEK, AND VAN DER ZEIJST uv transcription mapping was used to answer questions about the transcription mechanism of these RNAs. Our studies suggest that EAV has a replication strategy completely different from that of the alphaviruses or flaviviruses, the two main genera of the family Togaviridae. MATERIALS AND METHODS Cells and viruses. The Bucyrus strain of EAV was used. The virus was plaque purified twice before virus stocks were prepared at 37\" in Vero cells infected at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.01. After 1 hr adsorption the inoculum was removed and 50 ml of Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum and containing penicillin (100 IU/ml) and streptomycin (100 pg/ml) (DMEM-10% FCS) was added. The virus-containing culture medium was harvested 45 hr postinfection (p.i.) when most of the cells showed cytopathology.",

Quantitation of the overall synthesis of RNA after various uv doses as depicted in Fig. 3 , might lead to artifacts caused by the presence of prematurely terminated RNA molecules. Therefore, the RNAs were separated by agarose gel electrophoresis, excised from the gel, and counted. The results of a representative experiment are shown in Fig.  4 . As expected on the basis of the theory, there was a linear correlation between the logarithm of the remaining RNA synthesis (N,/NO) and the time of uv irradiation. The slopes of the curves were about the same, indicating that the target sizes are not widely different. The target sizes for the RNAs were calculated more exactly using the numerical values for the slopes FIG. 3. Effect of uv irradiation on the overall synthesis of virus-specific RNA in EAV-infected BHK-21 cells. Infected cells grown on coverslips in 35mm tissue culture dishes were exposed to uv irradiation at 6.5 hr pi. for increasing periods of time. The amount of [!H]uridine incorporated into trichloroacetic acid-precipitable material in the presence of act D between '7 and 7.5 hr p.i. (0) or 7.5 and 8 hr p.i. (0) was determined. After subtraction of the background in mock-infected cells (about 27% of the incorporation of the unirradiated control), the remaining virus-specific RNA synthesis at the various irradiation times was calculated. Vertical bars indicate the standard error of the mean. of the curve in Fig. 4 obtained by linear regression analysis ( Table 2) . The values obtained for each of the RNAs did not correlate with the actual molecular weight but they were about equal to the molecular weight of the genome. RNAs 2 to 5 had target sizes of 4.3 + 0.5 X 106. The template of RNA6 had a target size of 2.8 X 106, which is smaller than that of the other RNAs; it is, however, 14 times greater than the physical size of RNAG.",

RNAs were extracted from the cells and separated by electrophoresis in an urea-containing agarose gel; RNA bands were excised from the gel, and the amount of radioactivity was determined. The graphs were fitted by linear regression analysis. The correlation coefficients (r) varied between 0.94 and 1.69. now appears that the involvement of multiple subgenomic RNAs is not an unique feature of coronaviruses, since EAV, provisionally classified as a togavirus (Porterfield et aL, 19'78) , shows a similar pattern. However, fundamental differences seem to exist in the mode by which these RNAs are generated between coronaviruses and EAV. The results of uv transcription mapping with mouse hepatitis virus (Jacobs et aL, 1981) indicate that the subgenomic RNAs are synthesized via independent initiation on one or more template molecules. The uv target sizes of the templates for the EAV-specific RNAs, on the other hand, are most easily explained if we assume that the subgenomic RNAs are derived by specific cleavage or splicing from a full-length positive-stranded precursor.",

This implies that the information in the subgenomic RNAs could be adjacent in the genome; overlapping sequences between the RNAs do not have to be postulated. We will prepare RNAs T1 oligonucleotide fingerprints of the RNAs to answer this question. The difference between the total molecular weight of the RNAs and that of the genome may be accounted for by inaccuracies in the determination of the molecular weights or could be explained by the assumption that part of the information present in the genome is lost during the processing.",

The main viral proteins synthesized in infected cells are the nucleocapsid protein VP1 with a molecular weight of 14,000 and the nonglycosylated envelope protein VP2 possessing a molecular weight of 19,000 (unpublished results; we consider these slightly higher molecular weights as more accurate than those described previously by Zeegers et aL, 1976) . The molecular weights of these two proteins correspond to the coding capacity of RNAs 6 and 5, respectively, the two main virusspecific RNAs. Studies to determine the coding potential of some of the RNAs directly are in progress. More experiments are also needed to explain why RNA5 and RNA6 are synthesized in much greater molar ratios than the other RNAs.",

When the Togaviridae family was officially established on the basis of morphologic criteria for the virion and the size and infectivity of the RNA (Wildy, 1971) , it was already clear that it contained viruses differing considerably in ecology and antigenic properties. Initially, however, there were insufficient data to argue for or against a common origin of all togaviruses (Porterfield, 1980) . As more became known about the replication mechanism of alpha-and flaviviruses, the two main genera of the togavirus family, it OThe value of K X T was obtained from the slope of the curves of Fig. 4 and K was calculated a8 7.49 X lOme see-' by substituting the molecular weight of RNA1 as target size for this RNA.",
