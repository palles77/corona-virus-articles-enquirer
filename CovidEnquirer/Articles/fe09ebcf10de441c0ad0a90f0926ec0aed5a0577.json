In recent years, a number of \"hidden\" coding open-reading frames (ORFs) have been discovered in the genomes of various (+)ssRNA viruses (Chung et al. 2008; Loughran et al. 2011; Fang et al. 2012; Firth 2014; Smirnova et al. 2015; Napthine et al. 2017; Lulla et al. 2019 ). Such \"hidden\" genes tend to be very short and/or to overlap previously known coding ORFs, explaining why they have escaped previous detection prior to the application of sensitive comparative genomic methods. However, all of these experimentally verified novel coding ORFs have been in the positive-sense. To our knowledge, no negative-sense coding ORF has ever been demonstrated in any (+)ssRNA virus. Thus, an unanswered question in virology is whether the negative strand of (+)ssRNA viruses can encode proteins.",

We also identified related rORF-containing sequences in public Puccinia striiformis and Uromyces appendiculatus transcriptome shotgun assembly (TSA) data sets.

            "text": "As currently defined by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV), the family Narnaviridae contains two genera: Mitovirus and Narnavirus. Both genera contain single-stranded positive-sense RNA viruses which are non-encapsidated and hence are expected to be transmitted either vertically though cell division or horizontally during host mating. Mitoviruses replicate in the mitochondria of host cells whereas narnaviruses replicate in the cytoplasm. These viruses were originally described as infecting fungi, but related viruses have since been observed in transcriptomic data sets derived from diverse organisms. The narnaviral positive strand normally contains a single long ORF that covers most of the genome and encodes an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) which catalyses viral replication. The narnaviral RdRp is highly divergent from those of other eukaryotic RNA viruses, and shows closer homology to the RdRps of RNA bacteriophages in the family Leviviridae (Rodriguez-Cousi\u00f1o et al. 1991; Esteban et al. 1992; Wolf et al. 2018) . Detailed comparative genomic and phylogenetic analyses suggest that the Narnaviridae are descended from a levivirus-like bacteriophage which may have been carried within the bacterial progenitor of mitochondria at the point of eukaryogenesis, followed by loss of the capsid protein giving rise to capsidless (\"naked\") RNA elements (Koonin et al. 2015; Wolf et al. 2018 ). The escape of a group of these viruses into the cytosol may have given rise to the Narnavirus genus (Koonin and Dolja 2014; Wolf et al. 2018 ).

ScNV-20S persistently infects most laboratory strains of the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, whereas fewer strains carry ScNV-23S. Their genomes have no 3\u2032 poly(A) tail and it is not known if they have a 5\u2032 cap structure (Rodr\u0131\u01f5uez-Cousi\u00f1o et al. 1998 ). The genomes do not encode capsids, but form ribonucleoprotein complexes with the RdRp in a 1:1 stoichiometry in the host cell cytoplasm; the RdRp interacts with both the 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 ends which may help protect the viral RNA from degradation by host exonucleases (Sol\u00f3rzano et al. 2000; Fujimura and Esteban 2004; Fujimura and Esteban 2007) . Under suitably inducing conditions such as heat shock and nitrogen starvation, copy numbers of either virus can reach 100,000 copies per cell (Kadowaki and Halvorson 1971; Wejksnora and Haber 1978; Esteban et al. 1992) . Approximately 98-99% of viral RNA in the cell is in a single-stranded positive-sense form, whereas the remainder exists as single-stranded negative-sense replication intermediates (Rodriguez-Cousi\u00f1o et al. 1991; Fujimura et al. 2005) .",

The PCA allowed clear segregation of arthropods from ascomycetes and basidiomycetes (two major fungal phyla) and streptophytes (land plants and some green algae), but the latter three groups did not clearly segregate from each other (Supplementary Figure S5) .

The proposed genus Betanarnavirus contains pathogens of diverse unicellular eukaryotes, including the oomycete Phytophthora infestans and the trypanosomatid Leptomonas seymouri. The two proposed genera differ in terms of their relative codon usage preferences and in the composition of their genomic termini, with alphanarnaviruses having GC-rich termini and a higher overall GC3 content in codons, and the betanarnaviruses having AU-rich termini.

In ScNV-20S and ScNV-23S, the 5\u2032-GGGG and CCCC-3\u2032 genomic termini, besides 5\u2032 and 3\u2032 RNA structures, are essential for efficient virus replication (Esteban and Fujimura 2003; Fujimura and Esteban 2004; Esteban et al. 2005) . Since narnavirus RNAs are non-polyadenylated and probably non-capped, they are vulnerable to host mRNA degradation pathways. However, the viral RdRp binds to the 3\u2032terminal CCCC and an adjacent RNA stem-loop structure in the positive strand and this is thought to stabilize the genome and protect the 3\u2032 end from host 3\u2032 exonuclease degradation (Fujimura and Esteban 2004; Fujimura and Esteban 2007) . Similar elements also exist at the 3\u2032 end of the negative strand Fujimura and Esteban 2007) . Meanwhile, the positive-strand 5\u2032proximal RNA structure protects the genome from the host SKI1/XRN1 5\u2032 exonuclease (Esteban et al. 2008) . These stability elements are thought to be particularly important for narnaviruses due to the lack of capsids or membrane-associated replication that other (+)ssRNA viruses use to protect their genomes (Fujimura and Esteban 2007) .

The rORF occurs exclusively in the R0 frame relative to the RdRp ORF, and large sections of the latter therefore exhibit a specific exclusion of the three codons CUA, UUA and UCA, which are however widely used in the RdRp ORF of non-rORF-containing narnaviruses. Nonetheless, these codons are still used occasionally in rORF-containing narnaviruses, exclusively within the 5\u2032-most extremity (3%) of the RdRp coding region (at or upstream of the rORF stop codon). This indicates that selection against these codons is not due to an inability for these codons to be decoded by the host translational machinery (e.g. due to the lack of cognate tRNAs). This is also supported by our analysis of cellular organism codon usage which showed that the vast majority of organisms with GC3 in the same range as rORF-containing narnaviruses have CUA, UUA and UCA mean codon usage values well above those of the rORFcontaining narnaviruses ( Figure 6B) . Thus, the presence of the long rORF in highly divergent alphanarnaviruses cannot be explained as an artefact of RdRp ORF codon usage or GC bias.",

            "text": "To our knowledge there is no experimental evidence for protein-coding ORFs in the negative strand of any (+)ssRNA virus. A recent bioinformatic study used single-sequence randomization procedures to identify ORFs overlapping previously annotated ORFs in RNA virus sequences that are statistically significantly longer than expected by chance, with the assumption being that such ORFs are likely to be functional (Schlub et al. 2018 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the . https://doi.org/10.1101/664342 doi: bioRxiv preprint Tymoviridae). However it remains unclear how these ORFs would be translated. In eukaryotes, translation normally relies on recruitment of pre-initiation ribosomes to the 5\u2032 end of mRNAs, followed by scanning and initiation at the first AUG in a good initiation context. Thus, the majority of de novo protein-coding ORFs tend to evolve towards the 5\u2032 ends of transcripts, frequently overlapping the 5\u2032 end of an ancestral protein-coding ORF where they can be translated via a process known as leaky scanning (Firth and Brierley 2012) . If protein-coding ORFs exist in the negative strand of (+)ssRNA viruses, one might expect the majority to have initiation sites close to the 5\u2032 end of the negative strand. However for the six ORFs above there are, respectively, 171, 101, 115, 8, 3 and 100 intervening AUG codons between the 5\u2032 end of the negative strand and the first in-frame AUG codon in the ORF, which would appear to rule out 5\u2032-end-dependent scanning as a translation mechanism. 5\u2032-distal ORFs on positive-sense transcripts are often translated via ribosomal frameshifting or stop codon readthrough, but that still requires 5\u2032-proximal initiation in the pre-frameshift/pre-readthrough ORF (Firth and Brierley 2012) . 5\u2032-distal ORFs are occasionally translated via an internal ribosome entry site (IRES), but IRESes are normally complex elements and it would be difficult for them to evolve within protein-coding sequences. Simple inefficient IRESes are a possibility and, compounded with the low availability of negative strand, would lead to extremely low expression levels of any resulting proteins. Splicing is unknown in (+)ssRNA viruses as they all replicate cytoplasmically. Subgenome-sized negative-sense transcripts, where they are produced, are normally 5\u2032 co-terminal with the full-length negative strand so would not normally provide access to internal ORFs, although the production of other classes of negative- Sequestering replication within membranous compartments may also play a role in separation of translation from replication: positive-sense mRNAs are extruded into the cytoplasm for translation, whereas the negative strand remains protected within the membranous compartment for replication.",

Thus, at least at later time points, the negative strand is expected to be generally sequestered away from the translational machinery. Further, the negative strand of (+)ssRNA viruses often lacks the 5\u2032 structures (such as a 5\u2032 cap, 5\u2032 covalently linked viral protein of the genome, or IRES structure) required to efficiently recruit ribosomes. Narnavirus replication is, however, quite atypical among eukaryote-infecting (+)ssRNA viruses, and this may explain why they -possibly uniquely -appear to have evolved negative-strand coding capacity.

As mentioned above, the narnavirus RdRp is more closely related to the RdRp of bacteriophages in the family Leviviridae than it is to the RdRp of other (+)ssRNA viruses. Similar to leviviruses, the RNA in narnavirus replication intermediates is essentially single-stranded (Blumenthal and Carmichael 1979; Dobkin et al. 1979; Zinder 1980; Takeshita and Tomita 2012; Fujimura et al. 2005; Wickner et al. 2013) . Each newly synthesized RNA is released before a new round of replication commences and resting complexes comprising a negative-sense or positive-sense single-stranded RNA bound to a single copy of the viral RdRp are present within the cytoplasm (Sol\u00f3rzano et al. 2000) . Thus, for narnaviruses, the positive and negative strands likely have similar accessibility to the host cell translational machinery.",

Thus it may have evolved multiple times, or it may have been present ancestrally and lost from some lineages. The observation that the rORF is always in the R0 frame relative to the RdRp ORF may be evidence against independent evolution in multiple lineages, although it could also be a consequence of codon bias, e.g. if long ORFs are by chance more likely to occur in the R0 frame as a result of RdRp ORF codon usage. Such random ORFs could provide \"seeds\" for the evolution of longer overlapping genes (Belshaw et al. 2007) . Another surprising feature is that the rORF, where present, is nearly always full-length. If the sole function of the rORF were to encode an additional protein, one might expect to see a variety of rORF lengths in different lineages whereas we only see a single example of an rORF beginning within 200 nt of the 5\u2032 end of the negative strand with length in the range 24-94% of the full sequence length (Figure 4) . We found scant evidence for amino acid conservation in the rORF.

It is also not inconceivable that some (+)ssRNA viruses might have evolved mechanisms to allow some negative strands access to the translational machinery even at late timepoints. If so, it is possible that some (+)ssRNA viruses might have evolved ribosome recruitment elements within their negative strands. Thus it is perhaps too early to dismiss the possibility of negative-strand ORFs in other (+)ssRNA virus lineages. In most cases, however, any proteins encoded on the negative strand would be expected to be expressed at much lower levels than positive-strand encoded proteins simply because of the huge disparity in positive:negative RNA abundance during virus infection (typically of order 100:1; Novak and Kirkegaard 1991; Kopek et al. 2007; Irigoyen et al. 2016) . Even for narnaviruses, less than 1-2% of ScNV-20S viral RNA in infected cells is negative-sense (Rodriguez-Cousi\u00f1o et al. 1991; Fujimura et al. 2005), indicating that the rORF, where present, is likely to be expressed at a much lower level than the RdRp.",

Since ScNV-20S is a well-characterized virus of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, it is likely that the Nephila clavipes sequence derives from fungal contamination. The Entomophthora muscae sequences were obtained from fungus-infected Delia radicum cabbage flies, and indeed the NCBI SRA taxonomy analysis webpages (alpha version, 30 May 2019) for the corresponding RNA-Seq libraries show 4-16 times as much fly RNA as fungal RNA (within the only 8-9% of reads that were taxonomically identified); thus these TSAs may derive from infected insect cells. Similarly, the Hordeum vulgare TSAs may derive from infected fungal cells since the NCBI SRA taxonomy analysis webpages show contamination with Opisthokonta (i.e. animal/fungi) RNA at ~4% the level of plant RNA. Thus, it is important to apply caution when attempting to infer the host of TSA sequences.",

Thus there is now strong evidence that at least some rORF-containing alphanarnaviruses are bona fide arthropod viruses. On the other hand, other rORF-containing alphanarnaviruses come from fungal (or plant) samples that have no obvious association with arthropods (< 0.8% metazoan-mapping reads in total per sample), such as the Uromyces appendiculatus and Puccinia striiformis samples, indicating that presence of the rORF is likely not a unique adaptation to arthropod infection.Since our original identification of long rORFs in the ONLV1 and ONLV2 genomes, besides sequences from Uromyces appendiculatus and Puccinia striiformis transcriptomes(Cook et al. 2013), a number of other studies have discovered narnaviral genomes containing similar",

Given the pronounced evolutionary adaptations that might be required to express such negative-strand ORFs, in the absence of experimental data they would be more plausible if they were conserved in related species. However this has not been demonstrated. For example, the Nhumirim virus rORF is not conserved in the the forward ORF) where the rORF region is disrupted by eight stop codons. Similarly, the sweet potato virus 2 rORF is not conserved in sweet potato virus G (NC_018093.1; 74% aa identity in the forward ORF) where the rORF region is disrupted by nine stop codons. Indeed it is not even conserved in other isolates of sweet potato virus 2 -e.g. KP729268.1 and KP115618.1 each have a stop codon. Thus we contend that the alphanarnavirus rORF is currently the only plausible candidate for a negative-strand coding ORF in (+)ssRNA viruses.The replication of most (+)ssRNA viruses is membrane-associated (den Boon and Ahlquist 2010;Romero-Brey and Bartenschlager 2014;Shulla and Randall 2016;Ertel et al. 2017). Infection typically results in extensive rearrangement of host membranes to produce membrane-bound miniorganelles within which genome replication occurs.
