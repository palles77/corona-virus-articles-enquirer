All the novel tricyclic derivatives were evaluated for inhibitory activity against herpes simplex virus 1 and 2 (HSV-1, HSV-2) and thymidine kinase deficient (ACV resistant) HSV-1. The tricyclic HBG derivatives were devoid of inhibitory activity however several of the tricyclic PCV derivatives showed promising antiviral activity, in particular 9g (R = 4-MeO-C 6 H 4 ) displayed good inhibitory activity (HSV-1 EC 50 1.5 \u03bcM, HSV-2 EC 50 0.8 \u03bcM) and retained inhibitory activity in HSV-1 TK \u2212 cells (EC 50 0.8 \u03bcM). Computational docking experiments supported the biological data observed and this preliminary study provides useful data for further development of tricyclic acyclic nucleoside derivatives with improved lipophilicity and retention of activity in HSV-1 TK deficient strains. Also, the new tricyclic derivatives were evaluated against a broad range of other DNA and RNA viruses, but were found to be inactive at subtoxic concentrations. In addition, weak to moderate cytostatic effect was observed for the new compounds. 100:0 to 94:6 v/v to give the product as a white solid. Yield: 0.19 g",

            "text": "The herpes simplex virus (HSV), like all herpes viruses, establishes lifelong latency following a primary infection. HSV-associated diseases can range from mild orolabial ulcers (cold sores) to severe encephalitis. 1 Herpes simplex viruses are categorised into two types: HSV-1, which is mainly transmitted through oral-oral contact resulting mainly in cold sores; 1 and HSV-2, which is mainly sexually transmitted resulting in the most common infection of genital herpes. 2 Globally two thirds of the population under the age of 50 are estimated to be infected with HSV-1. 3 Herpes simplex encephalitis (HSE) is the most common cause of sporadic fatal viral encephalitis, accounting for almost 20% of all cases of encephalitis. 4 HSE presents as an acute focal necrotising infection of the brain, which, if untreated, has a 70% mortality rate. 5 The first line treatment of HSE is aciclovir (ACV), administered intravenously for 14-21 days, however even when treated, HSE is associated with a 30% mortality rate and permanent neurological damage. [6] [7] [8] Limitations of ACV therapy for HSE are the development of viral resistance 9 and low CNS uptake. 10 Tricyclic ACV and ganciclovir (GCV) derivatives ( Fig. 1 ) were shown to be effective inhibitors of HSV-1 thymidine kinase (TK) and are of interest as they maintain the inhibitory activity against the enzyme and, as they are more lipophilic than the current medications, may be valuable agents for the treatment of CNS infections. [11] [12] [13] Moreover, these tricyclic compounds were found to exhibit strong intrinsic fluorescent properties, which allows for sensitive concentration monitoring and optimal therapeutic dosing. [11] [12] [13] Penciclovir (PCV) and hydroxybutylguanine (HBG) (Fig. 1) are the carbocyclic analogues of GCV and ACV, respectively. The spectrum of activity of PCV against human herpesviruses was found to be similar to that of ACV, however in certain circumstances PCV was more active than ACV owing to the higher stability of PCV-TP in infected cells relative to ACV-TP. 14 Also, at concentrations up to 100 \u00b5g/mL, it was confirmed that PCV, like ACV, was highly selective and subsequently did not exhibit any toxicity in cell culture. 14 Similarly, HBG is reported to have higher affinity for HSV-1 TK than ACV in addition to relatively comparable selectivity for inhibition of viral DNA synthesis and good safety profile in cell https://doi.org/10.1016/j.bmc.2019.02.005 Received 11 December 2018 ; Received in revised form 18 January 2019; Accepted 1 February 2019 culture. 15 Application of the tricyclic scaffold modification to PCV and HBG was of interest to determine whether antiviral activity was maintained and, importantly, modification of the nucleobase moiety with an additional ring may result in beneficial physicochemical properties (enhanced lipophilicity, fluorescence) and/or enhanced enzyme binding interaction. A library of tricyclic PCV and HBG derivatives (Fig. 2 ) was designed and synthesised to evaluate antiviral activity and study structure-activity relationships, supported by computational docking analysis.",

The new compounds were purified by flash column chromatography using a gradient eluting mixture of CH 2 Cl 2 -MeOH followed by recrystallisation (Scheme 1). The procedure used for the preparation of the new derivatives mostly followed a previously reported method for the preparation of analogously modified guanosine and other tricyclic derivatives. 12 The tricyclic derivatives showed some sensitivity towards light and air, so were protected by wrapping with foil and rapid storage in amber coloured vials. The 6-thien-2-yl group was highly unstable to light and air and in the case of the PCV derivative decomposed rapidly during collection. Conversely, its HBG congener (10h) was stable enough to be collected safely.",

However, rather than Gln125, the 4-HO-C 6 H 4 and 4-MeO-C 6 H 4 form a H-bond interaction with Ala168 or water-bridged H-bonds with Ala168 and Gln125 (Fig. 4) . The moderately active fluoro substituted analogues, 9b and 9e, showed almost similar binding modes, although the small fluoro substituent was better docked within the base pocket with the tricyclic moiety forming \u03c0-\u03c0 interaction with Tyr172. As the tricyclic purine moiety is longer than the guanine base of PCV, the orientation of the 6-arylgroup has an impact on the geometry of the acyclic hydroxyl groups and hence the stability of the formed complex for further phosphorylation. PCV analogues 9h, 9i and 9j with relatively more bulky ether moieties (4-EtO-C 6 H 4 , 3-OCH 2 O-4-C 6 H 3 and 4-C 6 H 5 O-C 6 H 4 ) formed weak interactions within the acyclic sugar binding pocket. In addition a steric clash was observed in the case of compound 9j. The steric effect might consequently diminish or abolish their complex stability. Analysis of the docked HBG analogues 10a-h compared with HBPG suggests that the ligand likely competes between two different binding orientations within the active site. In one orientation the tricyclic base moiety stacks with Tyr172 with the carbonyl group forming a H-bond with Gln125, while the acyclic hydroxyl group is situated 5.73-7.13 \u00c5 from the sulphate group (HPBG 5.66 \u00c5) and donates a H-bond to Glu83 and/or accepts water bridged H-bonds from Arg163, Glu83, Arg222 and Lys62. Also, Arg176, in some derivatives, donates a H-bond to N-1 (Fig. 5A ). In the other orientation the tricyclic structure is lying in a location that allows a stacking interaction with His58 and the carbonyl group is being upturned to accept a H-bond from Arg163 and/or waterbridged H-bonds from Arg163, Glu83, Arg222 and Lys62. In contrast, the same acyclic hydroxyl group in the second ligand orientation is 12.75 \u00c5 away from the sulphate compared with the former orientation where it accepts a H-bond from Arg176 (Fig. 5B ). In both orientations no contribution in ligand binding was observed for the 6-aryl group resulting in more flexibility and weaker binding of the whole compound within the active site.",

Importantly, for two of the tricyclic PCV derivatives with R = 6-(4-MeO-C 6 H 4 ) and R = 6-(4-F-C 6 H 4 ) groups activity was retained in the ACV resistant HSV-1 TK -KOS strain, which was not observed for the tricyclic GCV compounds. 11, 12 This preliminary study provides useful data for further development of tricyclic acyclic nucleoside derivatives with improved lipophilicity and retention of activity in TK deficient strains.",

Elemental analysis was performed (for compounds 10e and 10g) by MEDAC Ltd (Chobham, Surrey, UK). High resolution mass spectra (HRMS) were determined (for compounds 9a-j, 10a-d, 10f, and 10h) at the EPSRC National Mass Spectrometry Facility at Swansea University and Medac Ltd (Chobham, Surrey, UK), using ESI (Electrospray Ionisation). Flash column chromatography was performed with silica gel 60 (230-400 mesh) (Merck) and TLC was carried out on precoated silica plates (kiesel gel 60 F 254 , BDH). Compounds were visualised by illumination under UV light (254 nm). Melting points were determined on an electrothermal instrument and are uncorrected. All solvents were dried prior to use and stored over 4 \u00c5 molecular sieves, under nitrogen. All the compounds were \u226595% pure.",

Confluent cell cultures (or nearly confluent for MDCK cells) in microtiter 96-well plates were inoculated with 100 CCID 50 of virus (1 CCID 50 being the virus dose to infect 50% of the cell cultures) or with 20 plaque-forming units (PFU). After 1-2 h virus adsorption period, residual virus was removed, and the cell cultures were incubated in the presence of varying concentrations (200, 40, 8, 1.6, 0.32 \u03bcM) of the test compounds. Viral cytopathicity was recorded as soon as it reached completion in the control virus-infected cell cultures that were not treated with the test compounds. Antiviral activity was expressed as the EC 50 (50% effective concentration) or compound concentration required to reduce virusinduced cytopathogenicity or viral plaque formation by 50%. The MCC (minimal cytotoxic concentration) values were determined as the compound concentration required to afford a microscopically visible alteration of cell morphology. The new compounds were screened for their potential cytostatic activity against eight human cancer cell lines. The 50% cytostatic inhibitory concentration (IC 50 ) causing a 50% decrease in cell proliferationrelative to the number of cells in the untreated controls was determined against retina (non cancerous) hTERT RPE-1, pancreatic adenocarcinomaCapan-1, chronic myeloid leukaemia Hap1, lung carcinoma NCI-H460, acute lymphoblastic leukaemia DND-41, acute myeloid leukaemia HL-60, chronic myeloid leukaemia K-562 and non-Hodgkin lymphoma Z-138.",

The Alpha Triangle placement, which derives poses by random superposition of ligand atom triplets through alpha sphere dummies in the receptor site, was chosen to determine the poses. The London \u0394G scoring function estimates the free energy of binding of the ligand from a given pose. Refinement of the results was done using the MMFF94 forcefield, and rescoring of the refined results using the London \u0394G scoring function was applied. The output database dock file was created with different poses for each ligand and arranged according to the final score function (S), which is the score of the last stage that was not set to zero.",
