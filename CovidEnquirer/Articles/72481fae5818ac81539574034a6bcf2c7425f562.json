            "text": "In April 2003, sequencing of all three billion nucleotides in the human genome was declared complete. This landmark of modern science brought with it high hopes for the understanding and treatment of human genetic disorders. There is plenty of evidence to suggest that the hopes will become reality-1631 human genetic diseases are now associated with known DNA sequences, compared to the less than 100 that were known at the initiation of the Human Genome Project (HGP) in 1990. The success of this project (it came in almost 3 years ahead of time and 10% under budget, while at the same time providing more data than originally planned) depended on innovations in a variety of areas: breakthroughs in basic molecular biology to allow manipulation of DNA and other compounds; improved engineering and manufacturing technology to produce equipment for reading the sequences of DNA; advances in robotics and laboratory automation; development of statistical methods to interpret data from sequencing projects; and the creation of specialized computing hardware and software systems to circumvent massive computational barriers that faced genome scientists. Clearly, the HGP served as an incubator for interdisciplinary research at both the basic and applied levels. The human genome was not the only organism targeted during the genomic era. As of June 2004, the complete genomes were available for 1557 viruses, 165 microbes, and 26 eukaryotes ranging from the malaria parasite Plasmodium falciparum to yeast, rice, and humans. Continued advances in technology are necessary to accelerate the pace and to reduce the expense of data acquisition projects. Improved computational and statistical methods are needed to interpret the mountains of data. The increase in the rate of data accumulation is outpacing the rate of increases in computer processor speed, stressing the importance of both applied and basic theoretical work in the mathematical and computational sciences.",

Some viruses maintain their genetic data in RNA, but no emphasis will be placed on such exceptions. The size of genomes, measured in counts of nucleotides or base pairs, varies tremendously, and a curious observation is that genome size is only loosely associated with organismal complexity (Table 13 .1). Most of the known functional units of genomes are called genes. For purposes of this chapter, a gene can be defined as a contiguous block of nucleotides operating for a single purpose. This definition is necessarily vague, for there are a number of types of genes, and even within a given type of gene, experts have difficulty agreeing on precisely where the beginning and ending boundaries of those genes lie. A structural gene is a gene that codes instructions for creating a protein ( Fig. 13 .2). A second category of genes with many members is the collection of RNA genes. An RNA gene does not contain protein information; instead, its function is determined by its ability to fold into a specific three-dimensional configuration, at which point it is able to interact with other molecules and play a part in a biochemical process. A common RNA gene found in most forms of life is the tRNA gene illustrated in Figure 13 .3.",

The number and variety of genes in organisms is a current topic of importance for genome scientists. Gene number in organisms ranges from tiny (470 in mycoplasma) to enormous (60,000 or more in plants). Non-free-living organisms have even smaller gene numbers (the HIV virus contains only nine). The number of genes in a typical human genome has been estimated to be about 30,000, perhaps the single most surprising finding from the Human Genome Project. This number was thought to be as large as 120,000 as recently as 1998. The confusion over this number arose in part because there is a not a ''one gene, one protein'' rule in humans, or indeed, in many eukaryotic organisms. Instead, a single gene region can contain the information needed to produce multiple proteins. To understand this fact, the series of steps involved in creating a functional protein from the underlying DNA sequence instructions must be understood. The central dogma of molecular biology states that genetic information is stored in DNA, copied to RNA, and then interpreted from the RNA copy to form a functional protein ( Fig. 13 .2). The process of copying the genetic information in DNA into an RNA copy is known as transcription (see Chapter 3). The process is thought by many to be a remnant of an early RNA world, in which the earliest life forms were based on RNA genomes. It is at the level of transcription that gene expression is regulated, determining where and when a particular gene is turned on or off.",

It is this molecule of messenger RNA (mRNA) that will serve as a template for producing a protein. However, it is necessary for organisms to regulate the expression of genes to avoid having all genes being produced in all cells at all times. Transcription factors interact with either the genomic DNA or the polymerase molecule to allow delicate control of the gene expression process. A feedback loop is created whereby an environmental stimulus such as a drug leads to the production of a transcription factor, which triggers the expression of a gene. In addition to this example of a positive control mechanism, negative control is also possible. An emerging theme is that sets of genes are often coregulated by a single or Figure 13 .3 The transfer RNA (tRNA) is an example of a non-protein-coding gene.

            "text": "One of the earliest surprises of the genomic era was the discovery that many eukaryotic gene sequences are not contiguous, but are instead interrupted by DNA sequences known as introns. As shown in Figure 13 .2, introns are physically cut, or spliced, from the mRNA sequence before the RNA is converted into a protein. The presence of introns helps to explain the phenomenon that there are more proteins produced in an organism than there are genes present. The process of alternative splicing allows for exons to be assembled in a combinatoric fashion, resulting in a multitude of potential proteins. For example, consider a gene sequence with exons E1, E2, and E3 interrupted by introns I1 and I2. If both introns are spliced, the resulting protein would be encoded as E1-E2-E3. However, it is also possible to splice the gene in a way that produces protein E1-E3, skipping exon E2. Much like transcription factors regulate gene expressions, there are factors that help to regulate alternative splicing. A common theme is to find a single gene that is spliced in different ways to produce isoforms that are expressed in specific tissues.",

The shortest sequence would correspond to the subsequence A; its reporter tells us that the final nucleotide is an A. The second shortest subsequence is AG, with a final nucleotide of G.

Radioactive reporters have been replaced with safer and cheaper fluorescent dyes, and automatic laser-based systems now read the sequence of fluorescentlabeled nucleotides directly as they migrate. Early versions of Sanger sequencing only allowed for reading a few hundred nucleotides at a time; modern sequencing devices can read sequences of 800 nucleotides or more. Perhaps most important has been the replacement of ''slab gel'' systems with capillary sequencers. The older system required much labor and a steady hand; capillary systems, in conjunction with the development of necessary robotic devices for manipulating samples, have allowed almost completely automated sequencing pipelines to be developed. Not to be ignored in the series of technological advances is the development of automated base-calling algorithms. A laser reads the intensities of each of the four fluorescent reporter dyes as each nucleotide passes it. The resulting graph of those intensities is a chromatogram. Statistical algorithms, including the landmark program phred, are able to accept chromatograms as input and output DNA sequences with very high levels of accuracy, reducing the need for laborious human intervention. By assessing the relative levels of the four curves, the base-calling algorithms not only report the most likely nucleotide at each position, but they also provide an error probability for each site.

The fundamental approach to shotgun sequencing of a genome is simple: (1) create many identical copies of a genome; (2) randomly cut the genomes into millions of fragments, each short enough to be sequenced individually; (3) align the overlapping fragments by identifying matching nucleotides at the ends of fragments, and finally; (4) read the complete genome sequence by following a gap-free path through the fragments.

A variety of technologies have emerged for creating such slides, ranging from simple pin spotting devices to technologies using laser jet printing techniques. The RNA of expressed genes is next collected from the target cell population. Through the process of reverse transcription, a cDNA version of each RNA is created. A cDNA molecule is complementary to the genomic DNA sequence in the sense that complementary base pairs will physically bind to one another. For example, a cDNA reading GTTAC could physically bind to the genomic DNA sequence CAATG. During the process of creating the cDNA collection, each cDNA is labeled with a fluorescent dye. The collection of labeled cDNAs is poured over the microscope slide and its set of attached DNA molecules. The cDNAs that match a DNA on the slide physically bind to their mates, and unbound cDNAs are washed from the slide. Finally, the number of bound molecules at each spot (genes) can be read by measuring the fluorescence level at each spot. Highly expressed genes will create more RNA, which results in more labeled cDNAs binding to those spots.",

Variations of the banding patterns in polytene chromosomes, for instance, have been studied for many decades.

Alignment (a) is considered best under the standards of this scoring scheme, and, in fact, it has the best score of all 129 possible alignments. This example suggests an algorithm for finding the best scoring alignment of any two sequences: enumerate all possible alignments, calculate the score for each, and select the alignment with the highest score. Unfortunately, it turns out that this approach is not practical for real data. It can be shown that the number of possible alignments of 2 sequences of length n is approximately 2 2n = ffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffiffi 2pn p when n is large. Even for a pair of short sequences of length 100, the number of alignments is 6 \u00c2 10 58 , 35 orders of magnitude larger than Avogadro's number! Techniques such as the Needleman-Wunsch and Smith-Waterman algorithms, which allow for computationally efficient identifications of the optimal alignments, are important practical and theoretical components of bioinformatics. Conceptually, the task of aligning three or more sequences is essentially the same as that of aligning pairs of sequences. The computational task, however, becomes enormously more complex, growing exponentially with the number of sequences to be aligned. No practically useful solutions have been found, and the problem has been shown to belong to a class of fundamentally hard computational problems said to be NP-complete. In addition to the increased computation, there is one important new concept that arises when shifting from pairwise alignment to multiple alignment. Scoring columns in the pairwise case was simple; that is not the case for multiple sequences. Complications arise because the evolutionary tree relating the sequences to be aligned is typically unknown, which makes assigning biologically plausible scores difficult. This problem is often ignored, and columns are scored using a sum of pairs scoring scheme in which the score for a column is the sum of all possible pairwise scores. For example, the score for a column containing the three nucleotides CGG, again using the scores m \u00bc 5, d \u00bc \u00c01, and i \u00bc \u00c03, is \u00c01 \u00c0 1 \u00fe 5 \u00bc 3. Other algorithms, such as the popular CLUSTALW program, use an approach known as progressive alignment to circumvent this issue.",

The most important improvement is the replacement of the simple match and mismatch scores with scoring matrices obtained from empirical collections of amino acid sequences. Rather than assigning, for example, all mismatches a value of \u00c01, the BLOSUM and PAM matrices provide a different penalty for each possible pair of amino acids.

It turns out that this type of database searching is a special case of pairwise sequence alignment. Essentially, all sequences in the database are concatenated end to end, and this new ''supersequence'' is aligned to our query sequence. Since the supersequence is many, many times longer than the query sequence, the resulting pairwise alignment would consist mostly of gaps and provide relatively little useful information. A more useful procedure is to ask if the supersequence contains a short subsequence that aligns well with the query sequence.

A simple model of the genome assigns each nucleotide to one of three possible classes (Fig. 13.15a) : a high G+C class (H), a low G+C class (L), or a normal G+C class (N). In the normal class, each of the four bases A, C, G, and T is used with equal frequency (25%). In the high G+C class, the frequencies of the four bases are 15% A, 35% C, 35% G, and 15% T, and in the low G+C class, the frequencies are 30% A, 20% C, 20% G, and 30% T. In the parlance of HMMs, these three classes are called hidden states, since they are not observed directly. Instead, the emitted characters A, C, G, and T are the observations.

In the first case, the functions of the genes may have changed during the tens or hundreds of millions of years since the two organisms shared a common ancestor. However, if two or more such distantly related organisms have gene sequences that are nearly identical, a strong argument can be made that the gene is critical in both organisms and that the same function has been maintained throughout evolutionary history. Short matches may arise simply as a result of elementary protein structure. For example, two sequences may have regions that match simply because they both encode alpha helical regions. Such matches provide useful structural information, but the stronger inference of shared function is not justified. Multigene families are the result of gene duplications followed by functional divergence. Examples include the globin and amylase families of genes. At some point in the past, a single gene in one organism was completely duplicated in the genome. At that point, the duplicated copy was free to evolve a new, but often related, function. Subsequent duplications allow for the growth and diversification of such families. Because of their shared ancestry, all members of a gene family tend to have similar DNA sequences.

This general principle has been used to create clusters of genes that are predicted to have similar or identical functions. The COGs (Clusters of Orthologous Groups of proteins) database at NCBI (http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/COG) represents a comprehensive clustering of the entire GenBank protein database using this type of scheme.",

The PFAM (Protein Family) database (http:// www.sanger.ac.uk/Software/Pfam) includes multiple sequence alignments of almost 7500 such protein families. Using the sequence data for each alignment, the PFAM project members created a special type of HMM called a profile HMM. This database makes it possible to take a query sequence and, for each of the 7500 families and their associated profile HMMs, ask the question, ''Is the query sequence a member of this gene family?'' A query to the PFAM results in a probability assigned to each of the included protein families, providing not only the best matches but also indications of the strength of the matches. Currently, about 74% of the proteins in GenBank have a match in PFAM, indicating a fairly high likelihood of any newly discovered protein having a PFAM match. PFAM is of interest not only because of its effectiveness, but also because of its theoretical approach of combining comparative genomic and HMM components.",

It is often the case that one treatment is a control while the other is an environmental stimulus such as a drug, chemical, or change in a physical variable such as temperature or pH. Other possibilities include comparisons between two tissue types (e.g., brain vs. heart), between diseased and undiseased tissues (e.g., tumor vs. normal), or between samples at two developmental phases (e.g., embryo vs. adult). One of the primary reasons to carry out such an experiment is to identify the genes that are differentially expressed between the two treatments.",

            "text": "The basic format of the data from a simple two-treatment microarray experiment is the following: Each spot on a microarray corresponds to a single gene, and in competitive hybridization experiments, a single spot usually provides measurements of gene expression under two different treatments. Note that the first column has been intentionally labeled ''Spot'' instead of ''Gene.'' It is important that the same gene be used and measured multiple times; therefore, a number of different spots will typically correspond to the same gene. The final column of data is the most important for interpreting this experiment. The most extreme difference in relative expression levels is found at spot 4, where the gene is expressed almost fourfold higher under treatment 2. The question now becomes, ''How large (or small) must the ratio be to say that the expression levels are really different?'' This question is one of variability and of statistical significance. Phrased differently, would a ratio near 0.27 for spot 4 be likely if the experiment were repeated? The data in the table do not provide the necessary information to answer this question, and this fact points out the importance of replication in experimental design. Whenever quantitative measurements are to be compared, replication is needed in order to estimate the variance of the measurements. This fundamental tenet of experimental design was largely ignored during the early history of microarray studies. Fortunately, recent work has included careful attention to experimental design and proper analysis using the analysis of variance (ANOVA). Typical experiments now include five or more replicate measurements of each gene. In order to detect very small treatment effects on levels of expression, even larger amounts of replication are needed.",

Examples of such studies might involve measuring expression levels in laboratory mice each hour following exposure to a toxic chemical, expression levels in a mother or fetus at each trimester of a pregnancy, or expression levels in patients each year following infection with HIV. If plots of expression levels (y axis) against time (x axis) for each gene are overlaid as shown in Figure 13 .18, it is possible to visually compare the expression profiles of genes. The desired pattern is a group of genes that tend to increase or decrease their expression levels in unison. In Figure 13 .18 it appears that genes 2 and 5 have very similar expression profiles, as do genes 1 and 4.",

When faced with thousands of profiles, the task becomes a bit more problematic. A common theme is to cluster genes on the basis of the similarity in their profiles, and many algorithms for carrying out the clustering have been published. All of these algorithms share the objective of assigning genes to clusters so that there is little variation among profiles within clusters, but considerable variation between clusters. Top down clustering begins with all genes in a single cluster, then recursively partitions the genes into smaller and smaller clusters. Bottom up methods start with each gene in its own cluster and progressively merge smaller clusters into larger ones. Clustering algorithms may also be supervised, meaning that the user specifies ahead of time the final number of clusters, or unsupervised, in which case the algorithm determines the final number of clusters.",

It has been the catalyst for an astounding burst of interdisciplinary research, and it has challenged long-established hierarchies found in most institutions of higher learning. The next generation of biologists will need to be as comfortable at a computer workstation as they are at the lab bench. Recognizing this fact, many universities have already reorganized their departments and their curricula to accommodate the demands of genomic science. From a more practical point of view, the results of genomic research will begin to trickle into medicine. Already, diagnostic procedures are changing rapidly as a result of genomics. The next phase of genomics will focus on relating genotypes to complex phenotypes, and as those connections are uncovered, new therapies and drugs will follow. Consider, for example, a drug that is of significant benefit to 99% of users, but causes serious side effects in the remaining 1%. Such drugs currently have difficulty remaining in the marketplace. However, the use of genetic screens to identify the patients likely to suffer side effects should make it possible for these drugs to be used safely and effectively. Less imminent, but certainly in the foreseeable future, are gene therapies that will allow for repair of genetic defects. The continued interplay of Figure 13 .18 Overlaid expression profiles for 5 genes. Note that genes 2 and 5, as well as genes biology, engineering, and the mathematical sciences will be responsible for exploration of these frontiers. EXERCISES 1.

What are possible advantages and disadvantages of introns? 3. Most amino acids are encoded by more than a single codon. If one of these synonymous codons is energetically more efficient for the organism to use, what effect would that have on the organism's genome content? How might this fact be used in gene finding algorithms? 4. What is the chance that a 20-nucleotide oligonucleotide matches a sequence other than the one it was designed to match? Assume for simplicity that all nucleotides have frequency 25%. How many matches to that oligonucleotide would one expect to find in the human genome? 5. If each of the 13 SSR markers used by the FBI for identification purposes has 20 equally frequent alleles, what is the chance that two randomly chosen individuals have the same collection of alleles at those 13 markers? 6.
