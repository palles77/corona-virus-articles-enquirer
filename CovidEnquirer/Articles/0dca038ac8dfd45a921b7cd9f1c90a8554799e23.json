In the early stages of this pneumonia, severe acute respiratory infection symptoms occurred, with some patients rapidly dev eloping acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS), acute respiratory failure, and other serious complications. On Jan 7, a novel coronavirus was identified by the Chinese Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) from the throat swab sample of a patient, and was subsequently named 2019nCoV by WHO. 4 Coronaviruses can cause multiple system infections in various animals and mainly respiratory tract infections in humans, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and Middle East respiratory syndrome (MERS).

So far, a few patients with 2019nCoV have developed severe pneumonia, pulmonary oedema, ARDS, or mul tiple organ failure and have died.

We did not find other respiratory viruses in any of the patients. Acinetobacter baumannii, Klebsiella pneumoniae, and Aspergillus flavus were all cultured in one patient. A baumannii turned out to be highly resistant to antibiotics. One case of fungal infection was diagnosed as Candida glabrata and three cases of fungal infection were diagnosed as Candida albicans.",

Patient 1 was transferred to Jinyintan Hospital and diagnosed with severe pneumonia and ARDS. He was immediately admitted to the intensive care unit (ICU) and given an intubated ventilatorassisted breathing therapy. Later, the patient, having developed severe res piratory failure, heart failure, and sepsis, experienced a sudden cardiac arrest on the 11th day of admission and was declared dead. Patient 2 had severe pneumonia and ARDS after admission. The patient was transferred to the ICU and given ventilatorassisted breathing, and received anti infection and ECMO treatment after admission. The patient's hypoxaemia remained unresolved. On the ninth day of admission, the patient died of severe pneumonia, septic shock, and respiratory failure. The intervals 1 (1A) . The brightness of both lungs was diffusely decreased, showing a large area of patchy shadow with uneven density.

Tracheal intubation could be seen in the trachea. Heart shadow roughly presents in the normal range. On the left side, the diaphragmatic surface is not clearly displayed. The right side of the diaphragmatic surface was light and smooth and rib phrenic angle was less sharp. Chest x-ray on Jan 10 showed worse status (2B). Case 3: chest CT obtained on Jan 1 (3A) showed mass shadows of high density in both lungs. Bright bronchogram is seen in the lung tissue area of the lesion, which is also called bronchoinflation sign. Chest CT on Jan 15 showed improved status (3B). between the onset of symptoms and the use of ventilator assisted breathing in the two patients were 3 days and 10 days, respectively. The course of the disease and lung lesions progressed rapidly in both patients, with both developing multiple organ failure in a short time.

            "text": "We observed a greater number of men than women in the 99 cases of 2019nCoV infection. MERSCoV and SARSCoV have also been found to infect more males than females. 19, 20 The reduced susceptibility of females to viral infections could be attributed to the protection from X chromosome and sex hormones, which play an important role in innate and adaptive immunity. 21 Additionally, about half of patients infected by 2019nCoV had chronic underlying diseases, mainly cardiovascular and cerebrovascular diseases and diabetes; this is similar to MERSCoV. 19 Our results suggest that 2019nCoV is more likely to infect older adult males with chronic comorbidities as a result of the weaker immune func tions of these patients. [19] [20] [21] [22] Some patients, especially severely ill ones, had co infections of bacteria and fungi. Common bacterial cultures of patients with secondary infections included A baumannii, K pneumoniae, A flavus, C glabrata, and C albicans. 8 The high drug resistance rate of A baumannii can cause difficulties with antiinfective treatment, leading to higher possibility of developing septic shock. 23 For severe mixed infections, in addition to the virulence factors of pathogens, the host's immune status is also one of the important factors. Old age, obesity, and presence of comorbidity might be associated with increased mor tality. 24 When populations with low immune function, such as older people, diabetics, people with HIV infection, people with longterm use of immuno suppressive agents, and pregnant women, are infected with 2019nCoV, prompt administration of antibiotics to prevent infection and strengthening of immune support treatment might reduce complications and mortality.",

This result suggests that 2019nCoV might mainly act on lympho cytes, especially T lymphocytes, as does SARSCoV. Virus particles spread through the respiratory mucosa and infect other cells, induce a cytokine storm in the body, generate a series of immune responses, and cause changes in peripheral white blood cells and immune cells such as lymphocytes. Some patients progressed rapidly with ARDS and septic shock, which was eventually followed by multiple organ failure. Therefore, early identification and timely treatment of critical cases is of crucial importance. Use of intra venous immunoglobulin is recommended to enhance the ability of antiinfection for severely ill patients and steroids (methylprednisolone 1-2 mg/kg per day) are recommended for patients with ARDS, for as short a duration of treatment as possible. Some studies suggest that a substantial decrease in the total number of lymphocytes indicates that coronavirus consumes many immune cells and inhibits the body's cellular immune function. Damage to T lymphocytes might be an important factor leading to exacerbations of patients. 25 The low absolute value of lymphocytes could be used as a reference index in the diagnosis of new coronavirus infections in the clinic.",
