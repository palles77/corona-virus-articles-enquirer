Divalent cations, such as zinc and iron, are increased following respiratory tract infection with viruses, and these changes influence adherence of the bacteria, production of adhesins, and the immune responses, and favor colonization of the lungs by bacteria and subsequent development of pneumonia.

Thus, most infections occur when an infected animal is introduced into a herd or when animals are confined in crowded pens in feedlot situations. The main source of genital disease is venereal transmission, and in bulls the infection can be subclinical. 54 Most bulls for artificial insemination are required to be seronegative for IBRV. In carrier animals the virus could persist in the trigeminal ganglia in a latent stage. If an animal is sufficiently stressed, as during shipping, the virus may become reactivated, with the host becoming viremic again, and virus may be shed into the environment. Infections by IBR start as foci with the herd of infection and spread within 2 to 4 weeks throughout the herd; the outbreak ends in 4 to 6 weeks when all animals have been exposed to the virus. Most infections occur in animals over 6 months of age, after maternal antibodies have waned. Both humoral and cell-mediated immune responses provide protection against the disease. Wild ruminants, such as deer, have been reported to be reservoirs of the virus. Other ruminants, such as goats, are also susceptible and can transmit the virus to domesticated cattle. Thus, cattle from endemic areas should be considered as carriers and capable of transmitting to previously unexposed animals. The severity of clinical disease is related to the strain of the virus, the immunologic status of the animal at the time of the infection, environmental stressors, and the age of the animal. The presence of even a low level of passive antibody in neonates is sufficient to reduce virus replication and the severity of the IBR infection. Even modified live IBR vaccines are not innocuous, and can cause death and generalized disease and death in young calves. 8 Face flies can retain BHV -1 for a short time, but they are not involved in either mechanical or biological transmission. 20",

Following passive transfer (colostrum and monoclonal antibodies) the antibodies prevent death but do not provide complete protection. 33 Antibodies against BHV-l participate in neutralization and antibody-dependent, cell-mediated cytotoxicity, and also block immunosuppressive effects induced by BHV-1 on T cells. 19 Interactions with cells of monocyte / macrophage lineage occur early in the course of IBRV infection, and play an important role in all aspects of host-virus interactions. Monocytes and macrophages collected from infected animals can produce IFN-ex, function as cytotoxic cells, and express increased major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class II molecules, and thus are functional during the infection. Cytotoxic activity, increase in MHC class II expression, and cellular infiltration have been demonstrated in the lung parenchyma and contribute to pathological changes associated with the disease. 7 Autologous fibroblasts infected by BHV -1 stimulate a strong glV (gD)-specific T-cell response. In the supernatants of BHV -I-stimulated leukocytes, IL-2 and IFN--y have been demonstrated. These cytokines could be essential in recovering from BHV-l infection. l1 IL-2 has been shown to expand CD8+ cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) and induce lymphokine-activated cells capable of limiting the BHV -1 infection. Cells capable of producing IFN--y in response to BHV-l infection have been recovered from peripheral circulation as early as 3 days after infection. IFN--y induces MHC class II expression and cytotoxicity in the lung parenchyma. 12 During the early stages of BHV -1 infection (1 to 4 days) a marked reduction in lymphocyte activity occurs. Thus, balance between opposing responses may be critical for the outcome of the disease. Natural killer (NK)-like activity mediated by lymphocytes lacking markers for T or B cells or macrophages is antigen dependent. Bovine NKlike cells can lyse gl (gB) and glV (gD), but not gIll (gC)-transfected cells. 39 Polymorphonuclear neutrophils playa role in the immunity and pathologic changes associated with BHV-l infection. In vitro, PMNs treated with BHV -1 antigen produce an interferon-like substance called polyferon 43 ; however, polyferon has not been demonstrated after in vivo infection with BHV -1, and in vitro interactions of PMNs with other bovine viruses, like PI-3, BRSV, and BVD, fail to induce this protein. 6 PMNs from BHV-l-infected animals, however, have reduced chemotactic and phagocytic activities.

Peripheral blood mononuclear cells isolated from PIV3-infected calves have decreased in vitro proliferative responses to lymphocyte mitogens. 40 The mechanism of immunosuppression caused by PIV3 is poorly understood, but infection of macrophages and monocytes may contribute to decreased lymphocyte functions. Bovine alveolar macrophages and monocytes can serve as accessory cells for antigen-and mitogen-stimulated lymphocyte proliferation. 2 ,4 Infection of macrophages with PIV3 results in a significant decrease in their ability to support lymphocyte proliferation. 4 Even though PIV3-infected macrophages secrete potentially immunosuppressive factors, it was shown experimentally that PIV3-induced depression of lymphocyte proliferation was not due to secreted soluble factors, but required direct contact with activated lymphocytes. In vitro studies concluded that close contact between PIV3-infected alveolar macrophages and stimulated lymphocytes facilitated viral infection of lymphocytes. s Lymphocytes had intracytoplasmic viral inclusions similar to those seen in macrophages and respiratory epithelium. These studies were the first to show PIV3-infected lymphocytes and that infection resulted in altered lymphocyte functions. s Infection of calves with PIV3 is rarely fatal, producing mild or inapparent clinical signs. PIV3 is important in mixed infections, and may predispose to bacterial pneumonia by altering bacterial clearance in the upper airway and lung. Immunosuppression may result from altered macrophage and lymphocyte functions as the result of virus infection of these cells and release of immunosuppressive factors.",

The severity of respiratory BRCV infection can be reduced by feeding colostrum to newborn calves. In cell culture, hygromycin B inhibits BCV transcription and protein production. 57 Hygromycin B has no known toxicity in cattle after long-term feeding under feedlot conditions. Because hygromycin B has been found to inhibit mouse hepatitis virus infection in vitro and in vivo, it is hoped hygromycin B will prove to be a suitable treatment for BCV -associated infections in calves.",
