            "text": "Viruses with RNA genomes dominate the eukaryotic virome, reaching enormous diversity in animals and plants. The recent advances of metaviromics prompted us to perform a detailed phylogenomic reconstruction of the evolution of the dramatically expanded global RNA virome. The only universal gene among RNA viruses is the gene encoding the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp). We developed an iterative computational procedure that alternates the RdRp phylogenetic tree construction with refinement of the underlying multiple-sequence alignments. The resulting tree encompasses 4,617 RNA virus RdRps and consists of 5 major branches; 2 of the branches include positive-sense RNA viruses, 1 is a mix of positive-sense (\u03e9) RNA and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) viruses, and 2 consist of dsRNA and negative-sense (\u03ea) RNA viruses, respectively. This tree topology implies that dsRNA viruses evolved from \u03e9RNA viruses on at least two independent occasions, whereas \u03eaRNA viruses evolved from dsRNA viruses. Reconstruction of RNA virus evolution using the RdRp tree as the scaffold suggests that the last common ancestors of the major branches of \u03e9RNA viruses encoded only the RdRp and a single jelly-roll capsid protein. Subsequent evolution involved independent capture of additional genes, in particular, those encoding distinct RNA helicases, enabling replication of larger RNA genomes and facilitating virus genome expression and virus-host interactions. Phylogenomic analysis reveals extensive gene module exchange among diverse viruses and horizontal virus transfer between distantly related hosts. Although the network of evolutionary relationships within the RNA virome is bound to further expand, the present results call for a thorough reevaluation of the RNA virus taxonomy. IMPORTANCE The majority of the diverse viruses infecting eukaryotes have RNA genomes, including numerous human, animal, and plant pathogens. Recent advances of metagenomics have led to the discovery of many new groups of RNA viruses in a wide range of hosts. These findings enable a far more complete reconstruction of the evolution of RNA viruses than was attainable previously. This reconstruction reveals the relationships between different Baltimore classes of viruses and indicates extensive transfer of viruses between distantly related hosts, such as plants and animals. These results call for a major revision of the existing taxonomy of RNA viruses.",

RdRps belong to the expansive class of polymerases containing so-called Palm catalytic domains along with the accessory Fingers and Thumb domains (24, 25) . In addition to viral RdRps, Palm domain polymerases include reverse transcriptases (RTs) of retroelements and reverse-transcribing viruses and the DNA polymerases that are responsible for genome replication in cellular organisms and diverse DNA viruses. Within the Palm domain class of proteins, RT and the \u03e9RNA virus RdRps are significantly similar in sequence and structure and appear to comprise a monophyletic group (22, (24) (25) (26) . More specifically, the highest similarity is observed between the \u03e9RNA virus RdRps and the RTs of group II introns. These introns are widespread retrotransposons in prokaryotes that are thought to be ancestral to the RTs of all other retrotransposons as well as retroviruses and pararetroviruses (recently jointly classified as the order Ortervirales) of eukaryotes (27) (28) (29) (30) .",

The origin of eukaryotic \u03e9RNA viruses from their prokaryotic counterparts is an obvious possibility. However, given the dramatically greater prevalence of \u03e9RNA viruses among eukaryotes compared to the narrow spread of leviviruses and \"levi-like viruses\" in bacteria, an alternative scenario has been proposed. In this scenario, RdRps of the prokaryotic and eukaryotic \u03e9RNA viruses independently descended from distinct RTs (11, 31) . Among eukaryotic \u03e9RNA viruses, phylogenetic analysis of the RdRps strongly supports the existence of picornavirus and alphavirus \"supergroups,\" which are further validated by additional signature genes (7, 15) . However, both the exact compositions of these supergroups and the evolutionary relationships among many additional groups of viruses remain uncertain. Some RdRp phylogenies suggest a third supergroup combining animal \"flavi-like viruses\" and plant tombusviruses, but this unification is not supported by additional shared genes and thus remains tenuous (7, 15, 21) .",

In particular, to build a phylogenetic tree of thousands of viral RdRps, we designed an iterative computational procedure that alternates phylogeny construction with refinement of the underlying multiple alignments. Although RNA viruses have relatively short genomes (\u03f33 to 41 kb), the combined gene repertoire (pangenome) of these viruses includes numerous genes that are shared, to various degrees, by related subsets of RNA viruses. To obtain further insight into virus evolution, we therefore attempted to reconstruct the history of gain and loss of conserved proteins and domains in different virus lineages. We also investigated evolution of the single jelly-roll capsid protein (SJR-CP), the dominant type of capsid protein among \u03e9RNA viruses. Our analysis revealed patterns that are generally congruent with the RdRp phylogeny and provide further insights into the evolution of different branches of RNA viruses. Finally, we analyzed a bipartite network in which RNA virus genomes are connected via nodes representing virus genes (44, 45) to identify distinct modules in the RNA virosphere. The results shed light on the evolution of RNA viruses, revealing, in particular, the monophyly of \u03eaRNA viruses and their apparent origin from dsRNA viruses, which seem to have evolved from distinct branches of \u03e9RNA viruses on at least two independent occasions.",

Many such lineages consist of viruses newly discovered by metaviromics and are not yet formally classified by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV) and therefore cannot be assigned formal names. For the purpose of the present work, we adopted a semiarbitrary naming scheme using the following approach. (i) We use taxon names that had been fully accepted by the ICTV as of March 2018 (47) whenever possible. These names are recognizable through their capitalization and italicization and rank-specific suffixes (e.g., -virales for orders and -viridae for families). As is the common practice in virus taxonomy, the officially classified members of each ICTV-approved taxon are referred to via vernacular designations (recognizable through their lack of capitalization and italicization). For instance, the members of the ICTV-approved order Bunyavirales are called bunyaviruses, whereas those of the family Tombusviridae are called tombusviruses. However, in this work, both taxon and vernacular terms are to be understood sensu lato: if our analysis indicates certain viruses to be members of or very closely related to an ICTV-established taxon, we consider them members of that taxon despite the lack of current ICTV recognition. As a result, the order Bunyavirales has more members in our analysis than in the official taxonomy. (ii) We use vernacular names in quotation marks for viruses/lineages that are clearly distinct from those covered by the official ICTV framework. Whenever possible, we use names that circulate in the literature (e.g., \"hepeliviruses,\" \"statoviruses\"). In the absence of such unofficial names, we name the lineage reminiscent of the next most closely related lineage (e.g., \"levi-like viruses\" are a clearly distinct sister group to Leviviridae/leviviruses). (iii) Monophyletic clusters that transcend the currently highest ICTV-accepted rank (i.e., order) are labeled according to terms circulating in the literature (i.e., \"alphavirus supergroup,\" \"flavivirus supergroup,\" and \"picornavirus supergroup\"). (iv) Lineages represented by a single virus are labeled with the respective virus name.",

This tree topology is compatible with the monophyly of the RdRps and, by inference, of RNA viruses and the origin of eukaryotic RNA viruses from a prokaryotic RNA virus ancestor shared with leviviruses.

One major group of dsRNA viruses that includes partitiviruses and picobirnaviruses is firmly embedded within \u03e9RNA virus branch 2, whereas another, the members of a larger dsRNA virus group that includes cystoviruses, reoviruses, totiviruses, and viruses from several other families comprise a distinct branch, branch 4, which might be related to \u03e9RNA virus branch 3 (Fig. 1 ). This placement of the two branches of dsRNA viruses is conceptually compatible with the previous evolutionary scenarios of independent origins from \u03e9RNA viruses. However, the presence of a strongly supported branch combining 3 lineages of dsRNA viruses that infect both prokaryotes and eukaryotes suggests a lesser extent of polyphyly in the evolution of dsRNA viruses than originally proposed (15, 32) .",

Instead, branches 4 and 5 are separate and positioned deep in the tree, immediately above the split between branch 1 and the rest of the RdRps. Given the poor resolution of the RAxML tree and a strong biological argument, namely, the absence of identified \u03eaRNA viruses in prokaryotes or protists (with the exception of the \"leishbuviruses\" infecting kinetoplastids [49, 50] ; see also Discussion below), we believe that the tree topology presented in Fig. 1 carries more credence than that shown in Data Set S3B.

Thus, after performing the phylogenetic analysis of RdRps, we assigned the proteins and domains shared by diverse viruses to the branches of the RdRp tree. Multiple alignments and hidden Markov model (hmm) profiles were constructed for 16,814 proteins and domains encoded by RNA viruses, and a computational pipeline was developed to map these domains on the viral genomes (Data Set S5). The resulting patterns of domain presence/absence in the branches of the RdRp tree were used to reconstruct the history of the gains and losses of RNA virus genes (or proteins and domains, for simplicity), both formally, using the ML-based Gloome method (51) , and informally, from parsimony considerations. These reconstructions reveal a high level of branch specificity in the evolution of the gene repertoire of RNA viruses. The only protein that is likely to have been gained at the base of the eukaryotic virus subtree (branches 2 to 5) (which also includes the bacterial cystoviruses) is the single jelly-roll capsid protein (SJR-CP) (Fig. S2A ). Retroelements lack capsid proteins, and therefore, there is no indication that SJR-CP was present in the hypothetical element that encoded the common ancestor of RdRps and RTs. Furthermore, reconstruction of the evolution of branch 1 (leviviruses and their relatives) argues against the ancestral status of SJR-CP in this branch.",

            "text": "(ii) Branch 1: leviviruses and their descendants. The current RdRp tree topology combined with gene gain-loss reconstruction suggests the following evolutionary scenario for branch 1 ( Fig. 2A) : a levivirus-like ancestor that, like the extant members of the Leviviridae, possessed a capsid protein unrelated to SJR-CP (19, 52) gave rise to naked eukaryotic RNA replicons known as \"mitoviruses\" and \"narnaviruses.\" These replicons consist of a single RdRp gene (Fig. 2B ) and replicate in mitochondria and in the cytosol of the host cells of fungal and invertebrate hosts, respectively (the latter hosts were identified in metaviromic holobiont analyses) (14, 53) . Recently, the existence of plant \"mitoviruses\" has been reported although it is not known whether these viruses reproduce in the mitochondria (54) . The \"narnavirus\" RdRp is also the ancestor of the RdRp of the expanding group of \"ourmiaviruses\" (Fig. 2A) . \"Ourmiaviruses\" were originally identified in a narrow range of plants, and genomic analysis revealed the chimeric nature of these viruses, with a \"narnavirus\"-like RdRp but SJR-CPs and movement proteins (MPs) which were apparently acquired from \"picorna-like\" and \"tombuslike\" viruses, respectively (55) . Use of metaviromics has led to the identification of numerous related viruses associated with invertebrates, many of which encode distinct SJR-CP variants and some of which acquired an RNA helicase ( Fig. 2B and S2 ) (14) . Thus, the evolution of this branch apparently involved the loss of the structural module of leviviruses, which yielded naked RNA replicons that reproduced in the mitochondria of early eukaryotes. A group of these replicons subsequently escaped to the cytosol, which was followed by the reacquisition of unrelated structural modules from distinct lineages of eukaryotic viruses inhabiting the same environment (Fig. 2B ). This complex evolutionary scenario emphasizes the key role of modular gene exchange in the evolution of RNA viruses.",

Nevertheless, the core of the supergroup remains coherent, suggestive of common ancestry.

The second largest, deep-branching clade consists of two lineages that include, respectively, \u03e9RNA and dsRNA viruses (Fig. 3 ). The \u03e9RNA virus lineage combines astroviruses and potyviruses, the evolutionary affinity of which is well recognized (31, 60) . The dsRNA lineage includes the members of the families Amalgaviridae, Hypoviridae, Partitiviridae, and Picobirnaviridae, with each of these families greatly expanded by unclassified affiliates. Finally, the \"middle\" clade is smaller and less diverse; it encompasses nidoviruses, including the longest of all \u03e9RNA virus genomes (61) , and solemoviruses with much shorter genomes (Fig. 3) . Notably, some members of the family Luteoviridae and Heterocapsa circularisquama RNA virus, the only known alvernavirus (62) , are nested within the solemovirus clade. Given the lack of support beyond the phylogenetic affinity of the RdRps and the dramatic differences in the genomic architectures of nidoviruses and solemoviruses, the possibility that this unification was caused by a tree construction artifact is difficult to rule out (the branch support notwithstanding).",

Typical partitiviruses and picobirnaviruses have minimalist genomes that consist of two dsRNA segments encapsidated separately into distinct 120-subunit T\u03ed1 capsids (65) (66) (67) (68) . These genome segments encode, respectively, RdRps and CPs that are clearly homologous between the two families. The CPs of the partitivirus-picobirnavirus clade have been suggested to be distantly related to those of other dsRNA viruses that belong to branch 4 (33, 69) . Notably, this clade also includes some naked RNA replicons that reproduce in algal mitochondria or chloroplasts, use a mitochondrial genetic code, and, in terms of lifestyle, resemble \"mitoviruses\" (14, 70, 71) . By analogy, the origin of the partitivirus-picobirnavirus group in an as-yet-undiscovered lineage of prokaryotic RNA viruses seems likely. More specifically, this group of dsRNA viruses could have evolved through reassortment of genomic segments encoding, respectively, a \u03e9RNA virus RdRp of branch 2 (possibly a naked RNA replicon) and a dsRNA virus capsid protein related to those of branch 4 viruses. The most recently evolved branch of partitiviruses is characterized by larger, 4-to 6-partite genomes, in contrast to the mono-or bipartite genomes in the deeper branches (14) . This observation emphasizes a major tendency in virus evolution: increases in genome complexity via gradual acquisition of accessory genes (72) .",

Branch 2 includes viruses with relatively long genomes and complex gene repertoires (nidoviruses, potyviruses, and many members of Picornavirales) along with viruses with much shorter genomes and minimal sets of genes (astroviruses and solemoviruses). Clearly, evolution of branch 2 viruses involved multiple gene gains. Of special note is the gain of 3 distinct helicases in 3 clades within this branch: superfamily 3 helicases (S3H) in members of Picornavirales, superfamily 2 helicases (S2H) in potyviruses, and superfamily 1 helicases (S1H) in nidoviruses ( Fig. 3B ; see also Fig. S2B ). This independent, convergent gain of distinct helicases reflects the trend noticed early in the study of RNA virus evolution, namely, that most viruses with genomes longer than \u03f36 kb encode helicases, whereas smaller ones do not. This difference conceivably exists because helicase activity is required for the replication of longer RNA genomes (73) . Another notable feature is the change of virion morphologies among potyviruses (replacement of ancestral SJR-CP by an unrelated CP forming filamentous virions) and nidoviruses (displacement by a distinct nucleocapsid protein).

Within the \"alphavirus supergroup\" alone, the genome lengths range from \u03f36 to \u03f320 kb.

It was traditionally thought that the latter capsid type is specific to viruses of flowering plants (20) . However, the recent discovery of a virgavirus-like CP in invertebrate viruses (e.g., B\u011b ih\u01cei charybdis crab virus 1 [ Fig. 4B ]) (14) suggests that the emergence of this unique CP fold antedates land colonization by plants at \u03f3100 million years ago (Mya). Yet another \"structural\" theme is offered by endornaviruses, naked RNA replicons which, similarly to the hypoviruses in branch 2 (see above), originally were classified as dsRNA viruses. However, endornaviruses possess all the hallmarks of the alphavirus supergroup and are clearly derived from \u03e9RNA viruses of this group. They seem to have been mislabeled dsRNA viruses due to the accumulation of dsRNA replication intermediates in infected cells (18, 77) . A parallel loss of the CP genes apparently occurred in the deltaflexiviruses, which, in RdRp phylogenies, form a sister group to the flexible filamentous gammaflexiviruses (78) , and in the umbraviruses that are included in the family Tombusviridae based on the RdRp phylogeny. Notably, unlike most other capsidless viruses that are vertically inherited, umbraviruses can hijack capsids of coinfecting luteoviruses for aphid transmission (79) .",

            "text": "The previously suggested, tenuous Flaviviridae-Tombusviridae affinity is gone in the present tree, although members of both families belong to the same major branch, branch 3. Plant tombusviruses (and members of closely related plant virus genera), representing the only group of \"tombus-like viruses\" that was available at the time of previous analyses (7, 21) , now form but a small twig deep within the large assemblage that we refer to as tombusviruses. Tombusviruses are affiliated with \"statoviruses\" (80) and with a subset of unclassified viruses from invertebrate holobionts rather than with flaviviruses (Fig. 4A) . Flaviviruses now form a separate clade within branch 3, the flavivirus supergroup that includes members of four recognized flaviviral genera (Pegivirus, Hepacivirus, Flavivirus, and Pestivirus), the newly discovered \"j\u0131 ngm\u00e9nviruses\" with segmented genomes (38) , and a variety of unclassified, extremely divergent \"flavi-like viruses\" of animals and plants. This clade is split into two well-supported lineages; one includes pegiviruses and hepaciviruses, and the other consists of the rest of flaviviruses (Fig. 4A ). Flaviviral virions are enveloped, with the envelope proteins forming an external icosahedral shell, whereas the core nucleocapsid is apparently disordered; the evolutionary provenance of the core protein, with its distinct fold, is unclear (19, 82, 83) . Notably, flaviviral envelope proteins are class II fusion proteins that are closely related to alphavirus envelope E1 proteins (84) . The theme of gene swapping between these distantly related virus groups of branch 3 is further emphasized by the homology between the alphavirus CPs that form icosahedral capsids under the lipid envelopes and the flavivirus nonstructural NS3 proteases that share a chymotrypsin-like fold (84) . Because the RdRp tree topology implies that the alphavirus ancestor is more recent than the ancestor of flaviviruses (Fig. 1) , such adoption of the NS3 protease for a structural role is suggestive of emerging alphaviruses borrowing their structural module from preexisting flaviviruses (19) .",

Indeed, the lengths of the genomes in this clade range from \u03f39 kb to \u03f326 kb, with even the shortest ones encoding at least three of the flavivirus signature genes (serine protease [Spro], S2H, and RdRp). One potential clue, however, is provided by \"j\u0131 ngm\u00e9nviruses,\" with tetrapartite genomes in which the protease-helicase modules and the RdRps are encoded by separate genome segments; two other segments apparently encode structural proteins of unclear provenance (38) . This genome architecture could hint at an ancestral flavivirus genome that was assembled from genes borrowed from preexisting viruses, one of which possessed a divergent \"tombus-like virus\" RdRp. Although the origins of branch 3 are murky, major trends in its subsequent evolution clearly included lineage-specific gene capture, starting with helicases and CapEs in the ancestors of the major lineages and followed by diverse genes in smaller groups (Fig. 4B) .",

            "text": "(v) Branch 4: dsRNA viruses. Branch 4, which joins branch 3 with weak support, includes the bulk of the dsRNA viruses ( Fig. 1 and 5 ). All dsRNA viruses in this branch share a unique virion organization and encode homologous CPs. In particular, the specialized icosahedral capsids of these viruses, involved in transcription and replication of the dsRNA genome inside cells, are constructed from 60 homo-or heterodimers of CP subunits organized on an unusual T\u03ed1 (also known as pseudo-T\u03ed2) lattice (69, 91) . The only exceptions are the chrysoviruses, which encode large CPs corresponding to the CP dimers of other dsRNA viruses and form genuine T\u03ed1 capsids (92) . The icosahedral capsids of partitiviruses and picobirnaviruses, which encode RdRps belonging to branch 2, are also constructed from 60 homodimers (66, 67, 93) and have been suggested to be evolutionarily related to those of the dsRNA viruses from RdRp branch 4 (94) despite little structural similarity between the corresponding CPs. Totiviruses, many of which have \"minimal\" genomes encoding only RdRps and CPs, comprise one of the two major clades in branch 4, whereas cystoviruses, the only known prokaryotic dsRNA viruses, together with members of the vast family Reoviridae, which consists of multisegmented dsRNA viruses infecting diverse eukaryotes, comprise the second clade (Fig. 5) . The concept of the closer phylogenetic affinity between cystoviruses and reoviruses appears to be corroborated by the fact that the inner T\u03ed1 icosahedral capsid is uniquely encased by the outer icosahedral shell constructed on a T\u03ed13 lattice in both families (34) . Both cystoviruses and reoviruses appear to have gained many cladespecific genes, in particular, RecA-like packaging ATPases of the former (95) and the CapEs of the latter that are only distantly related to CapEs of other RNA viruses and likely were acquired independently (96, 97) ( (vi) Branch 5: \u060aRNA viruses. Branch 5, the 100% supported lineage combining all \u03eaRNA viruses, is lodged within branch 4 as the sister group of reoviruses, and this position is upheld by two strongly supported internal branches in the RdRp tree ( Fig. 1  and 6 ). The \u03eaRNA branch splits into 2 strongly supported clades. The first clade encompasses the 348 viruses-strong membership of the order Mononegavirales (98), along with the members of the distantly related family Aspiviridae (99), 3 groups of \u03eaRNA viruses discovered through metaviromics (\"ch\u01d4 viruses,\" \"q\u00ednviruses,\" and \"yu\u00e8viruses\") (14, 39) , and a group of unclassified fungal viruses (Fig. 6A) (42, 100) . In contrast to the members of the Mononegavirales, most of which possess unsegmented genomes, the remainder of this clade is characterized by bi-, tri-, or even tetraseg-mented genomes (Fig. 6B) . The second clade combines the family Orthomyxoviridae, the genus Tilapinevirus (101), and the large order Bunyavirales (394 viruses) (102) . The latter order consists of two branches, one of which is the sister group to the orthomyxovirus/tilapinevirus clade (albeit with weak support). The numbers of negativesense or ambisense genome segments in this clade range from 2 to 3 in most of bunyaviruses to 8 in viruses of the genus Emaravirus and the orthomyxovirus/tilapinevirus group (10, 99, 101, 103) . A notable acquisition in the first clade is a CapE, whereas members of the second clade share \"cap-snatching\" endonucleases (En) (10) .",

The SJR-CP is the dominant type of CP among \u03e9RNA viruses and is also found in members of one family of dsRNA viruses (Birnaviridae). Structural comparisons indicate that SJR-CPs of RNA viruses form a monophyletic group and likely were recruited from cellular SJR proteins on a single occasion during the evolution of RNA viruses (19) . The short length and high divergence of SJR-CPs preclude adequate resolution in phylogenetic analysis; thus, we performed profile-profile sequence comparisons and clustering of all viral SJR-CP sequences in our data set (see Materials and Methods for details). Analysis of the resulting network reveals patterns that are generally congruent with the RdRp phylogeny and provides further insights into the evolution of different branches of RNA viruses. At conservative P value thresholds (P \u03fd 1e \u03ea10 ), the majority of SJR-CPs segregated into two large clusters, both of which contained representatives from RdRp branch 2. Cluster 1 included the members of Picornavirales and Caliciviridae and diverse \"picornalike viruses\" of invertebrates, whereas cluster 2 consisted of the members of the families Astroviridae, Luteoviridae, and Solemoviridae and \"sobemo-like viruses\" (Fig. S3 ). In addition, cluster 2 contained members of several families from RdRp branch 3, namely, Tombusviridae (and diverse \"tombus-like viruses\"), Hepeviridae, a subgroup of Nodaviridae, and \"statoviruses.\"",

Only \"ourmiaviruses\" had stronger affinity to picornaviruses in cluster 1 (Fig. 7) . This pattern of connectivity is consistent with the radiation of SJR-CPs from a common ancestor, likely resembling sequences from cluster 2 of branch 2. This analysis also reveals high CP sequence divergence among members of some families (e.g., Bromoviridae) and numerous cases of apparent CP gene replacement. For instance, the CPs of nodaviruses fall into two groups; one is related to the turreted CPs of tetraviruses, and the other is similar to CPs of tombusviruses, mirroring the RdRp phylogeny (Fig. 7) . At a greater phylogenetic distance, CPs of astroviruses and hepeviruses are closely related despite their affiliation with branches 2 and 3, respectively, suggesting CP gene replacement in the ancestor of one of the two families. Given that the CPs of hepeviruses connect to SJR-CPs of other viruses through astroviruses, CP gene replacement most likely occurred in the ancestor of hepeviruses (Fig. S3) . Notably, the CPs of \"zh\u00e0oviruses,\" \"w\u00e8iviruses,\" and \"tombus-like\" and \"sobemo-like\" viruses (representing a diverse virus assemblage within the solemovirus branch, to the exclusion of bona fide Solemoviridae) did not form discrete clusters but rather were affiliated with diverse virus groups, suggesting extensive recombination in these viruses, with multiple CP gene exchanges (Fig. 7) . In the case of unclassified \"narnaviruses\" and \"ourmiaviruses,\" the CP genes apparently were acquired on more than 3 independent occasions from different groups of viruses, emphasizing the impact of recombination and gene shuffling in the evolution of RNA viruses. Previously, a similar extent of chimerism was also observed among singlestranded DNA (ssDNA) viruses (104, 105) , highlighting the evolutionary and functional plasticity of short viral genomes.",

The pronounced structural and functional modularity of virus proteomes and the pervasive shuffling of the genomic regions encoding distinct protein modules are key features of virus evolution (11, 15, 17) . Therefore, a productive approach to the study of the virosphere that complements phylogenetics is the construction and analysis of networks of gene sharing. Bipartite networks, in which one type of node corresponds to genes and another to genomes, have been employed to investigate the double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) domain of the virosphere (45) . This analysis revealed hierarchical modular organization of the network, with several modules that included Global RNA Virome \u00ae nonobvious connections between disparate groups of viruses (44, 106) . Although this type of analysis is less informative for RNA viruses due to the small number of proteins encoded in each viral genome, the \"pan-proteome\" of RNA viruses is large (Data Set S5), prompting us to experiment with bipartite gene sharing networks for RNA viruses. The initial search for statistically significant modularity identified 54 distinct modules, most of which included a single virus family (Fig. 8A and B) . Remarkably, the family Reoviridae has been split into 5 modules, highlighting the vast diversity of this family, comparable to that seen in order-level taxa. Among the exceptions, the most expansive module included the viruses of the order Picornavirales (module 29), together with those of the family Caliciviridae (module 47), which are linked through the conserved suite of genes that includes those encoding SJR-CP, chymotrypsin-like protease, S3H, and the RdRp (Fig. 8A and C) . Viruses of the order Bunyavirales were also recovered in a single module characterized by the presence of a conserved nucleocapsid (with the exception of the families Nairoviridae and Arenaviridae) and the cap-snatching endonuclease (module 51; Fig. 8A and C) .",

However, an alternative scenario might be considered. No known prokaryotic viruses are classified in branch 2, but it has been proposed that the picobirnaviruses, for which no hosts have been reliably identified, actually are prokaryotic viruses. This proposal is based on the conspicuous conservation of functional, bacterium-type, ribosome-binding sites (Shine-Dalgarno sequences) in picobirnavirus genomes (107, 108) . Should that be the case, viruses of prokaryotes might be lurking among totiviruses as well.

The leaves of the tree were labeled with the known hosts, the entropy of the host ranges for each subtree was calculated, and the resulting values were plotted against the distance from the root (Fig. 9 ). By design, for all branches, entropy (host diversity) drops from the maximum values at the root to zero at the leaves. All branches show substantial host range diversity such that, for example, at the half-distance from the root to the leaves, all branches, except for branch 1, retain at least half of the diversity (Fig. 9 ). Furthermore, the differences between the branches are substantial, with the highest entropy observed in branch 4 (dsRNA viruses) and branch 5 (\u03eaRNA viruses). With all the caveats due to potential errors and ambiguities in host assignment, this analysis strongly suggests that HVT played an important role in the evolution of all major groups of RNA viruses.",

Indeed, \u03e9RNA viruses use the simplest genomic strategy and, in all likelihood, represent the primary pool of RNA viruses. The dsRNA viruses conceivably evolved when a \u03e9RNA virus switched to encapsidating a replicative intermediate (dsRNA) together with the RdRp. Naked replicons similar to those of \"mitoviruses,\" hypoviruses, and endornaviruses might have been evolutionary intermediates in this process. This switch does not seem to be as \"easy\" and common as previously suspected (15, 32) but, nevertheless, appears to have occurred at least twice during the evolution of RNA viruses. The Global RNA Virome \u00ae origin of \u03eaRNA viruses is the next step during which the plus strand is discarded from the virions, perhaps simplifying the processes of transcription and replication. Conceivably, the evolution of dsRNA and \u03eaRNA viruses, in which transcription and replication of the viral genomes were confined to the interior of virions or nucleocapsid transcription/replication complexes and no dsRNA accumulated in the infected cells, was driven by the advantage of escaping some of the host defense mechanisms, in particular, RNA interference (RNAi) (109, 110) . The membrane-associated replication complexes of \u03e9RNA viruses could represent an initial step in this direction (9) .",

At least in the case of partiti-picobirnaviruses in branch 2, the dsRNA virus (\"toti-like virus\") CP apparently displaced the ancestral SJR-CP. However, this particular protein structure does not seem to be essential to encapsidate a dsRNA genome; birnaviruses, whose provenance is uncertain due to the permutation in their RdRps, retain SJR-CP, which is most closely related to SJR-CP of nodaviruses and tetraviruses (19) . An even more striking example of module shuffling is presented by amalgaviruses, dsRNA viruses that group with partitiviruses in the RdRp tree but encode a distant homolog of the nucleocapsid protein of \u03eaRNA bunyaviruses (111) (112) (113) (114) . More generally, structural and replication modules have been repeatedly shuffled during the evolution of \u03e9RNA viruses. Examples include displacement of the ancestral SJR-CP by a filamentous CP in potyviruses and by a helical nucleocapsid protein in nidoviruses and multiple cases of displacement with rod-shaped-like CP and unique nucleocapsid proteins in branch 3. Thus, exchange of genes and gene modules among RNA viruses is pervasive and can cross the boundaries of Baltimore classes.",

These uncertainties notwithstanding, the extensive diversity of hosts even within small branches of the RdRp tree is undeniable. A coevolution scenario in which the ancestors of all these viruses originated from the common ancestor of the respective groups of eukaryotes and coevolved with the hosts implies an enormous diversity of RNA viruses in early eukaryotes. This scenario appears to be highly unlikely given the apparent paucity of RNA viruses in the extant protists (although new metaviromic studies might substantially expand the range of protist viruses).

Given that viruses of branches 2, 3, and 4 are present in modern protists, it appears likely that these branches emerged in early eukaryotes. However, because of the apparent dominance of the viruses of RdRp branch 2 (members of the \"picornavirus supergroup\" in general and of the \"aquatic picorna-like viruses\" clade in particular) in protists, this branch likely diversified first, whereas the diversification of branches 3 and 4 occurred later, after ancestral protist viruses were transferred to marine invertebrates during the Cambrian explosion. Results of the recent analysis of the viromes of ctenophores, sponges, and cnidarians suggest that substantial diversification of RNA viruses had already occurred in these deeply branching metazoa (120) . Invertebrates brought their already highly diverse RNA virome to land at the time of terrestrialization and subsequently inoculated land plants. In land plants, RNA viruses, particularly those of branch 3, dramatically expanded, perhaps in part because of the exclusion of competing large DNA viruses. Finally, it seems plausible that, given the high prevalence of \u03eaRNA viruses in metazoa and their virtual absence in protists (with the exception of the recently discovered \"leishbuviruses\" that likely invaded their parasitic protist hosts via HVT from an animal host [49, 50] ), the viruses that comprise RdRp branch 5 evolved in animals via mixing and matching genes from reovirus-like and flavivirus-like ancestors.",

At the depth of divergence characteristic of RdRps, the relationship between the major branches in the tree cannot be established with confidence. Nevertheless, monophyly of several expansive groups, in particular, the 5 main branches in the RdRp tree, is strongly supported.

Additionally, RT sequences were placed into two clusters consisting of group II intron RTs and non-LTR retrotransposon RTs.

Profiles for the latter proteins were generated by running one iteration of Jackhmmer (132) against the UniRef50 database. Protein regions that did not have significant hits were extracted and clustered with cluster analysis of sequences (CLANS) (133) , and groups containing at least three members were identified, annotated (if possible), and added to the manually annotated profile database.

Highly similar viruses (with identical domain organizations and \u03fe94% identical RdRps) were removed from the data set. In addition, only one representative genome was retained for some members of overrepresented species (e.g., Hepacivirus C). Many genomes (e.g., alphaviruses, tombusviruses, and nidoviruses) encoded readthrough proteins, resulting in domains from the shorter protein contained within the longer readthrough protein.

After removal of genomes with fewer than 2 domains and of domains that appeared in less than 3 genomes, the network consisted of 2,829 nodes, of which 2,515 corresponded to genomes and 314 to domains. Genome and domain nodes were connected by links wherever a domain was present in a genome. A consensus community detection approach was used to identify the modules of the network (134, 135) . First, we ran 500 replicas with Infomap (136) (bipartite setting, using domains as factors) and built a similarity matrix by assigning to each pair of nodes a similarity value equal to the fraction of replicas in which both nodes were placed in the same module. Then, hierarchical clustering was performed on the similarity matrix, setting the number of clusters equal to the median number of modules obtained in the 500 replicas. Order statistics local optimization method (Oslom) software (137) was subsequently used to filter significant modules with a P value threshold equal to 0.05. To detect higher-order (super)modules, we first identified connector domains as those present in at least 2 modules with prevalence greater than 0.65. The second-order network, composed of 54 modules and 34 connector domains, was searched for second-order modules with Infomap (500 replicas, bipartite setting with connector domains as factors). Due to the small size of the second-order network, consensus community detection did not qualitatively improve the results of the search, and therefore we took the replica with the best Infomap score and skipped hierarchical clustering for this and subsequent steps of the higher-order module search. After assessing statistical significance with Oslom, 4 second-order modules were recovered, encompassing 12 of the original modules associated with closely related virus families. A third-order network was built by pooling the 4 second-order modules with the 46 modules that remained unmerged. The third-order network was analyzed in the same manner to obtain the 9 supermodules. None of these supermodules was assessed by Oslom as significant.",

Each internal node of the tree therefore defines a set of leaves with assigned hosts; the distribution of (weighted) relative frequencies of hosts can be characterized by its Shannon entropy. Each leaf has one host defined such that the entropy of the host range distribution is 0 whereas the host diversity is maximal at the root. The entropy generally declines along the tree because viruses that belong to relatively shallow branches tend to share their host ranges. The node depth versus node host range entropy data were averaged for each major branch separately using a Gaussian kernel with a bandwidth equal to 10% of the total tree depth.",

Inv., viruses of invertebrates (many found in holobionts, making host assignment uncertain); uncl., unclassified. (B) Genome maps of a representative set of branch 5 viruses (drawn to scale) showing color-coded major conserved domains. Where a conserved domain comprises only a part of the larger protein, the rest of this protein is shown in light gray. The locations of such domains are approximated (indicated by fuzzy boundaries).
