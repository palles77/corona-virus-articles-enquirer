In this study, we conducted serial nucleotide truncation, ranging from 1 to 190 nucleotides, to the 5 UTR of the porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) infectious full-length cDNA clone pAPRRS. In vitro synthetic RNAs were transfected into MARC-145 cells for further genetic and virologic analysis. Our results demonstrated that the first three nucleotides of PRRSV 5 UTR were dispensable for virus viability, which however was repaired with foreign sequences. In order to assess if the primary sequence or structural element play more important regulatory roles, the CMV promoter-driven 5 UTR truncation mutant cDNA clones were directly transfected into the BHK-21 cell lines. We found that PRRSV tolerated the first 16 nucleotides sequence alteration of 5 UTR without losing virus viability. However, these revertant viruses contained a range of non-templated with unknown origin exogenous nucleotides in the repaired 5 end. Further analyses revealed that the 5 proximal stem-loop 1 (SL1) in the highly structured 5 UTR was invariably required for virus infectivity. Taken together, we conclude that authentic 5 -proximal primary sequence is nonessential, but the resultant structural elements are probably indispensable for PRRSV infectivity.",

There are four family members in the order Nidovirales, which includes coronavirus, torovirus, arterivirus and ronivirus (Pasternak et al., 2006) . Nidoviruses cause a variety of infectious diseases, for example, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) virus in humans, which gripped the attention of the world in 2003, is the member of coronaviridae (Drosten et al., 2003; Ksiazek et al., 2003; Peiris et al., 2003) . There are also severe nidoviral diseases in animals, such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus (PRRSV) (Cavanagh, 1997; Snijder, 2001) , which is a member of the family Arteriviri-dae together with equine arteritis virus (EAV), simian hemohagic fever virus (SHFV), and the lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus of mice (LDV) (den Boon et al., 1991; Pasternak et al., 2006; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) . Since 2006, massive outbreaks of highly pathogenic PRRSV have overwhelmed the swine industry in China and its neighboring countries (Lv et al., 2008; Tian et al., 2007; Zhou and Yang, 2010) . Despite massive efforts have been directed towards prevention and control of PRRS, little improvement has been shown and the latter is still the biggest threat to the swine industry, particularly in developing countries. One of the reasons for such ineffective PRRS control is that many puzzles remain unearthed for PRRSV biology.",

            "text": "PRRSV genome has a 5 cap and a 3 poly (A) tail and is \u223c15 kb in length. There are at least nine open reading frames (ORFs), flanked by the 5 UTR, 3 UTR, respectively, which are believed to play pivotal regulatory roles in PRRSV life cycle Verheije et al., 2001 Verheije et al., , 2002 . Like other nidoviruses, PRRSV generates a 3 co-terminal nested set of subgenomic mRNA (sg mRNA) to produce structural proteins. PRRSV sg mRNAs also contain a common 5 leader sequence, which comes from the genomic 5 end (Pasternak et al., 2006; Snijder and Meulenberg, 1998) . The sg mRNA synthesis involves a process of unique discontinuous RNA transcription similar with the RNA recombination (Pasternak et al., 2006 ; van Marle et al., 1999) . During the process of discontinuous RNA transcription, the transcription-regulating sequence (TRS) plays a crucial role by base-pairing interaction between body TRS (TRS-B) and Leader TRS (TRS-L) during the synthesis of minus-strand RNA (Pasternak et al., 2006 (Pasternak et al., , 2001 Sawicki and Sawicki, 1995) . The TRS-Bs in the genome would act as attenuation signals for minus-strand RNA synthesis, after which the nascent minus strand, having an anti TRS-B at its 3 end, would be guided to the 5 -proximal region of the template, through a base-pairing interaction with the TRS-L. Following the addition of the anti-leader to the nascent minus strands, the sg-length minus strands would serve as templates for transcription. However, many molecular details for such a unique transcription process remain to be investigated. In particular, what are the roles of the TRS-flanking sequences and/or local or genomic global RNA structures? Dose Arteriviral RNA synthesis also requires cross-talk between the genomic termini, as described for other positive-strand RNA viruses (Filomatori et al., 2006; Suzuki et al., 2008) ?",

Nonviral terminal sequences usually have deleterious effects on viral replication (Boyer and Haenni, 1994; Herold and Andino, 2000) . Intriguingly, Choi et al. (2006) reported that PRRSV tolerated deletion of the 5 -proximal 7 nucleotides ( 1 AUGACGU 7 ) without the loss of the viral infectivity. These authors found that the rescued PRRSVs contained a range of novel 5 AU-rich sequences without known origin (Choi et al., 2006) . We hypothesized that the 5 UTR structural elements rather than the primary sequences were required for PRRSV replication.",

The in vitro RNA transcripts from T7 promoter were utilized to investigate if presence of the authentic 5 -terminal nucleotide sequence was required, while in vivo RNA transcripts from CMV promoter were intended for sequence specificity and/or structural RNA signal studies. Serial truncations of the 5 -proximal end of pAPRRS were performed. In the RNA-launched reverse genetics system (RGS), we found that the first 3 nucleotides ( 1 AUG 3 ) at the very beginning of PRRSV 5 UTR were dispensable for virus viability, yet the deleted nucleotides were repaired with different sequences. In the DNA-launch system, we demonstrated that the first 16 nucleotides, 1 AUGACGUAUAGGUGUU 16 , of PRRSV 5 UTR could be altered by a combination of deletion and substitution in the in vivo RNA transcripts. However, the altered sequences were repaired with a variable length and largely AU-rich exogenous sequences in the rescued viruses. Surprisingly, in all cases the reverted AU-rich sequences were found to restore the original stem-loop 1 (SL1) structure of the PRRSV 5 UTR. Moreover, the infectivity of the transfected DNAs were found to be directly related to the presence of the SL1, which was probably a key for the initiation of PRRSV process. We therefore concluded that the structural RNA elements rather than primary sequences of the 5 -terminus of the PRRSV 5 UTR played more important regulatory roles in virus replication process.",

In general, the desired mutations were included in the synthetic forward primers (Table 1) of which the representative plasmids are drawn in Fig. 1 . All the mutants were divided into three groups. Mutant cDNA clones of group I were intended to be used as templates for in vitro genomic RNA synthesis, by T7 DNA-dependant RNA polymerases in the RNAlaunched form. On the other hand, group II and group III, controlled under CMV promoter, were directly transfected into cells in a form of DNA-launched RGS. Moreover, the T7 promoter was substituted as GC-rich sequences in pAPRRSMzg3 and pAPRRSMzg6. As shown in Fig. 1 , the transcription initiation site of CMV promoter was located in the T7 promoter if DNA-launched transfection was used, thus the in vivo synthesized RNA genomes contained 9 extra foreign nucleotides (CAC UAU AGG) immediately before the viral sequence.",

Mutant plasmids containing more than 18 nucleotides deletion, as well as the nonreplicative control pAS, were negative even after prolonged incubation for 7 dpt, and three subsequent blind passages. Moreover, the expression level of N protein was invertedly correlated to the number of the nucleotides deleted, and only a few secluded spots were found in pAPRRSM17 and M18 transfected wells (Fig. 3) . In addition, IFA with anti-Nsp2 antibody results revealed that all mutants including pAPRRSM190 containing no leader sequence at all, expressed Nsp2 protein, which was translated from the CMV-driven genomic RNAs (data not shown). Again, the expression level were different, with mutants containing more than 16 nucleotide deletion only displayed sparse positive cells, implying that the first 16 nucleotides could have a role for virus replication.",

The predicted secondary structure of 5 terminal 246 nucleotides of APRRSV was shown in Fig. 6 . A total of 6 stem-loops were predicted and verified by multiple Algorithms. The overall secondary structure was dramatically changed when the first 12 nucleotides \" 1 ATGACGTATAGG 12 \" were deleted in pAPRRSM12 (Fig. 6Ai) . In particular, the original stem-loop 1 (SL1) was replaced with two minor stem-loops. However, the filling-in by the T7 promoter sequence restored the SL1-like structure, though the sequence is different (Fig. 6Aii) . Surprisingly, all of the sequences in the recovered viable viruses were found to form a SL1-like structure, as represented by that of vAPRRSM12S1 (Fig. 6Aiii) . We then analysed the nucleotide deletion and substitution in pAPRRSMzg6. Pure deletion of the first 6 nucleotides would disrupt both SL-1 and SL-2 (Fig. 6Bi) . However, filling-in by T7 promoter and an artificial GC-rich sequence restored both stem-loops (Fig. 6Bii) . Again, all recovered viruses displayed the similar structures, though with different sequence (Fig. 6Biii) . Furthermore, we investigated the failure of vAPRRSM17 to initiate virus production, and found that the filling-in by T7 sequences after deletion of the first 17 nucleotides was not enough to restore the SL1 structure. Overall, we concluded that the SL1, and probably SL2, structure rather than the primary sequence is important for viral infectivity.",

The first RNAlaunched PRRSV RGS was performed for the type 1 Lelystad strain by assembling its full-length cDNA under the control of the T7 promoter in the low-copy-number plasmid pOK12. Identical strategies were also previously used in the construction of an infectious cDNA for the North American prototypic VR-2332 strain (Nielsen et al., 2003) . In this study, we utilized an infectious cDNA clone pAPPRS that are dually controlled by CMV and T7 promoter (Yuan and Wei, 2008) , which offered us more flexibilities for investigating the roles of 5 UTR in the forms of both in vitro and in vivo synthetic genomic RNAs. As the results, we found that the first 16 nucleotides in the PRRSV 5 UTR could be altered without lethal effect to virus infectivity, which is 9 nt longer than that previously reported by Choi et al. (2006) . Intriguingly, only 3 nts could be deleted without loss of the viral viability in our RNA-launched system, despite three independent transfections were conducted, and the 4 nt deletion was always lethal for virus recovery. The difference between our observation and that by Choi et al. (2006) may be explained by the genetic diversity between the APRRS and PL97, as only 93.4% identity exist, and 96.3% of 5 UTR. It may be possible that the long-range RNA-RNA interaction and/or the global genomic high-ordered structure were adversely affected by deletion of more nucleotides in APRRS. Alternatively, we found that the SL1 structure was disrupted in the pAPRRSD4, which may be one of the reasons for this lethal mutation.",

Besides acting as RNA signals, high-ordered RNA structure has been confirmed to protect viral RNAs from degradation by exonucleases (Gallie, 1998) , and stabilize the genomic RNA (Barton et al., 2001) . In our DNA-launched study here, we found that the infectivity of the mutants was directly related to the presence of the SL1, and the lack of which by insufficient substitution, e.g., pAPRRSM17, would render the failure of virus recovery. In fact, both SL1 and SL2 were disrupted in this 17 nt deletion mutant. The viral titration for the first cycle and multiple cycles of mutant viruses were conducted in this study. The viral titers were gradually decreasing along with the deletion number of the 5 proximal nucleotides. But multi-step growth curve revealed that the peak titer of mutant viruses at 72 hpi difference was small, as shown in Fig. 4A and C. According to the exogenous AU-rich sequence detection and secondary structure prediction, it could be deduced that virus viability restoration occurred in viral SL1 structure restoration and stability. The fact that the first 16 nts could be altered without loss of the virus infectivity led us to conclude that the structural RNA, at least SL1, rather than the primary sequence at the PRRSV 5 UTR was crucial for virus replication. Moreover, all viable viruses acquired nucleotide sequences that invariably restored the SL1 structure, as represented in Fig. 6 .",

In DNA-launched system described here, the in vivo synthetic RNA of pAPRRS contained 9 nt nonauthentic sequences in between the transcription initiate site and the 5 proximal genomic end of PRRSV. However, all the recovered transfectant vAPRRS contained the exact original 5 genomic end of the parental virus. On the other hand, the rescued viruses from the mutants with longer sequence alteration all contained exogenous largely AU-rich sequences, of which the vAPRRSM14S1 was 6 nt shorter than the authentic sequence.",

            "text": "The restoration sequences of the mutant viruses shared great identity with part of T7 promoter sequence behind the CMV transcription initiation site, and were largely AU-rich. To differentiate if the repaired 5 end is template-dependent, we modified the T7 sequence as GC-rich immediately behind the CMV transcription initiation site (Fig. 1, group III) . Surprisingly, both rescued viruses, vAPRRSMzg3 and vAPRRSMzg6, were again repaired with AU-rich, indicating that viral genomic end repair is template-independent. At this stage, it was difficult to explain the origin of these novel 5 foreign sequences and the molecular mechanism of their addition at the very beginning of the viral genome. It is likely that they are acquired from cellular RNAs via a process of RNA recombination involving template switching during either negative-or positive-sense RNA synthesis, as has been described for pestivirus (Meulenberg et al., 1993) and poliovirus (Kirkegaard and Baltimore, 1986) . Alternatively, the nucleotides were randomly added to the genomic end during RNA synthesis, and the AU-rich sequence containing viruses were selected for their overall better fitness. The selective pressure could come from the sequence requirement for local or long-range RNA-RNA and/or RNA-protein interactions. For instance, the viral RdRp binding site at the 5 end of the Dengue virus genome facilitates template recognition at the 3 end of the genome via long-range RNA-RNA interactions (Filomatori et al., 2007) . In addition, the overall high-ordered structures of the 5 UTR or the genomic RNA possibly play a role in the end-repair process, which is supported by our finding that the SL1 is invariably maintained for virus recovery.",

            "text": "The 5 UTR of plus-strand RNA viruses has also documented for multiple functions that regulate the viral life cycles, including genomic RNA translation, replication, subgenomic mRNA (if any) transcription, progeny genome encapsidation (Andino et al., 1990; Choi et al., 2006; Frolov et al., 1998; Herold and Andino, 2001; Liu et al., 2007 Liu et al., , 2009 Suzuki et al., 2008; Van Den Born et al., 2004 . In this study, we found that all in vitro and in vivo synthetic genomic RNAs including pAPRRSM190 in which all 5 UTR sequence was deleted were positive for Nsp2 protein expression by IFA (data not shown), demonstrating that the PRRSV 5 UTR has little effect on genomic RNA translation. These results confirmed the finding by the Snijder group showing that none of the EAV 5 UTR sequence or structure played any role in regulating viral RNA translation (Van Den Born et al., 2005) . This is not unexpectedly because that nidoviral mRNA translation adopt a leaky-scanning model, while there was probably internal ribosomal entry site (IRES) as those in 5 UTR of a variety of positive-strand RNA viruses (Rijnbrand et al., 1997) . However, our IFA results showed that the N protein was not expressed in transfected cells by deletion of the first 19 or more nucleotides, which could be a result of the lack of mRNA7. In addition, our preliminary analyses suggested that the nonviable mutants contained no minus-and probablly plus-strand genomic RNAs. Van Den Born et al. (2005) reported that nt 1-135 in the EAV 5 UTR had little role in subgenomic mRNA synthesis. Therefore, we think that the PRRSV 5 UTR SL1 structure could be an element controlling genomic RNA synthesis.",
