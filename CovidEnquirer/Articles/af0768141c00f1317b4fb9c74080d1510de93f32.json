Approximately 70% of students felt comfortable prescribing antibiotics for a known infection compared with 40% at baseline (P = .02), and approximately 83% were able to identify the appropriate personal protective equipment for specific scenarios. Approximately 99% agreed that they have a role in promoting patient safety and preventing healthcare-associated infections as medical students. At 20 months, appropriateness of trainee antibiotic prescriptions increased by 20% (P < .01). Almost all ID fellows indicated that the AS and IPC seminar was a vital training supplement. Uptake of internist antibiotic recommendations using AS decision support tools was approximately 70%.",

In 2011, Abbo et al [2] surveyed faculty and residents at 2 teaching hospitals to assess knowledge, attitudes, and perceptions about antimicrobial use and resistance. The majority of respondents desired further education on antibiotics and agreed that better use of antibiotics would reduce resistance, but they did not feel responsible for antibiotic over prescribing. In a 2013 follow-up multicenter survey of fourth year medical students, 90% desired further education on antimicrobial prescribing, but only 40% were familiar with the role of antimicrobial stewardship (AS) in promoting judicious antimicrobial use and preventing multidrug resistance [3, 4] . Authors also noted that only 15% of students surveyed completed a clinical ID rotation, an underused opportunity to augment ID knowledge and explore a potential career path [3] .",

The Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services and the Joint Commission proposed similar ASP standards in 2016 [12, 13] . Per Ohl and Luther [14] , the goal of stewardship education is not only to reduce total antibiotic use, but also to ensure that antibiotics are prescribed only when indicated, at the correct dose, route, and for the proper duration for each infection.",

These tools can effectively introduce AS concepts to medical students, because studies indicate that only 65% of medicals schools address stewardship in their curricula [20, 21] . A recent collaborative study by MacDougall et al [21] at the University of California San Francisco suggests that early introduction of core AS concepts to both pharmacy and medical students may foster appropriate antibiotic use as a shared responsibility of both professions. Since its introduction in 2013, our AS student seminar has evolved to better suit students' needs, and it has become a cornerstone of Einstein's preclinical clinical microbiology and ID curriculum. Introduction of the APPropriate Use app resulted in a 30% increase in the percentage of students who felt more confident prescribing antibiotics for a given syndrome. Likewise, introduction of an ID core curriculum and tailored antibiotic guide for medical residents enabled a 20% increase in appropriate antibiotic prescriptions over time. To further leverage this success, we adapted our antibiotic guide to a smart phone app for all Montefiore prescribers, which we launched during the Centers for Disease Control's \"Get Smart about Antibiotics\" campaign in November 2015. This \"version 2.0\" of the APPropriate Use app was downloaded onto over 200 devices and accessed over 1200 times within the first 6 months of introduction [22] .

Attending physicians often serve in leadership roles in the medical unit, and they are charged with a myriad of responsibilities, including improving hospital throughput and use as well as teaching and evaluating trainees. Challenges of outreach to the mature prescriber include (1) time constraints, (2) long-standing prescribing behaviors, (3) staff turnover, and (4) emphasis on individual patients over aggregate outcomes. Education to improve prescribing at the senior level needs to respect existing attitudes, expectations, and knowledge, and maintain a collegial and collaborative atmosphere. Our strategy has focused on recurring feedback sessions to prescriber groups and discrete detailing to individual prescribers. Subtle reminders evoking the \"public commitment\" to responsible prescribing has been referred to as \"antibiotic judo\" [23] . Our senior prescribers have also benefited from the prescribing tools initially developed for our students and trainees.",

Many students requested additional training before the start of their clinical rotations, and they judged ours to be the most interactive session held in the education center in 2016. After the seminar, students felt much more comfortable identifying the appropriate PPE and isolation precautions for each scenario. Our findings suggest that emphasis on IPC best practices in medical school promotes a culture of patient safety and lays the groundwork for sustained infection prevention behaviors as students mature into clinicians. The AS and IPC interventions were implemented in different time frames and settings, which served to reduce potential confounding between learner groups.

We did not conduct an educational needs assessment before study implementation. Interventions were designed based on our perceived educational needs extracted from daily interactions with learners. For example, we observed from >5000 stewardship pager interactions per year that 80%-90% of requests are for empiric antimicrobial regimens, often broad spectrum, or intended for patients with remote penicillin allergies, for whom more streamlined \u03b2-lactam regimens are more appropriate. Quasi-experimental, before and after study design, particularly when applied to small sample sizes, has several limitations, including lack of random assignment and internal validity, generalizability of results, and robustness of conclusions on the effectiveness of educational techniques [24] . However, this methodology is common to published studies in stewardship and infection prevention. Techniques described herein are best suited for adaptation at an academic medical center, because they have not been studied outside this setting. Only 1 of the interventions was designed for and implemented in a community hospital.",

In addition, a statistically significant improvement in syndrome-based antibiotic prescribing was not demonstrated in all categories due to insufficient sample sizes. In the ID fellows' seminar, content of the program, mix of learners, and preand postassessment questions varied slightly each year, which may have affected survey results. Although a majority of local ID fellows attended our AS and IPC workshop, the study was not powered to demonstrate statistically significant differences in pre-and postsurvey responses. Past course attendees have not been surveyed to determine the role of AS and IPC in their current careers and their perceived preparedness after completion of the workshop. A baseline audit of patient characteristics and antibiotic prescribing on the geriatric units was not conducted before stewardship implementation, and unadjusted length of stay was obtained from 2013 hospital discharge data only. Reduced length of stay observed during the pilot was likely due to other factors in addition to ASP intervention. Fianlly, we",
