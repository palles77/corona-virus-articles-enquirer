            "text": "In the U.S. the use of breathing filters remains controversial because of the potential risk of crosscontamination and cross-infection. In their \"Guidelines for Preventing Health-Care Associated Pneumonia, 2003,\" the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) provide no recommendation for \"placing a bacterial filter in the breathing system or patient circuit of anesthesia equipment\" and regard this as an \"unresolved issue\" [4] . However, these CDC guidelines also mandate that \"between uses on different patients\" \u2026 \"reusable components of the breathing system or patient circuit (eg, endotracheal tube or face mask; inspiratory and expiratory breathing tubing; y-piece; reservoir bag; humidifier; and tubing)\" be cleaned and that these items be sterilized or subject \"to high-level liquid chemical disinfection or pasteurization in accordance with the device manufacturers' instructions for their reprocessing.\" Based on current federal laws in the U.S. if a device labeled in the packaging as single-use is to be considered for reuse, it must undergo reprocessing and be certified as safe as when it was originally shipped by the manufacturer. Reuse of disposable single-use items shifts all liability from the manufacturer to the practitioner in the operating room (OR). Because the Food and Drug Administration's policy for medical devices is that valid scientific evidence is needed to ensure safety, manufacturers would need to perform expensive prospective studies to prove the safety of their breathing circuits (used with a filter) before being able to market the circuits as multiple-use.",

Because of these concerns, it is said that it would be unethical to change the practice of the use of the filters for economical and environmental reasons [7, 8] . Ideally, the clinical safety of breathing filters and reuse of the breathing systems would need to be evaluated by comparing the incidence of postoperative respiratory tract infections with the incidence associated with the standard practice of using a sterile system for every patient [9] . Other noninfectious risks associated with breathing filters include barotrauma and pneumothorax caused by obstruction of the filter, air leak, inefficient ventilation, and disconnection of the breathing system [8] .",

Breathing systems in the U.K. now have new filter products with licenses for multiple uses up to one week, if a new filter is placed at the Y-piece of the system for each patient.

The filtration performance of pleated hydrophobic membrane filters is greater than that of electrostatic filters. In addition, pleated hydrophobic filters prevent liquid contamination of breathing systems [12] .

Material and labor costs between different practices (change of the anesthesia breathing circuits after each patient versus the use of a hydrophobic HME-F with daily or weekly change of the circuit) were compared.

For this analysis we assumed the breathing circuit would also be replaced in 10% of cases because it was visibly soiled after the previous case, or with a patient with special infectious disease status (eg, tuberculosis, HIV, variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, avian influenza A, severe acute respiratory syndrome). With breathing system reuse, 9,568 circuits would have been needed such that purchasing costs for breathing circuits would have been $68, 890. The purchasing costs for breathing filters would have been 21, 137 \u00d7 $2.50, or $52, 843. With the reuse of breathing circuits, the total purchasing costs for breathing circuits and filters would have been $121, 733. Our findings confirmed the results of a similar study that showed savings of up to $50, 000 per year in a facility with about 60 general anesthetics per day [14] . Nevertheless, estimated cost savings can differ widely depending on the manufacturer, type, and quality of breathing filter used, and the purchase agreement. For example, pleated paper hydrophobic breathing filters may be more expensive than electrostatic felted polypropylene filters. Under such circumstances the cost of the former may exceed the cost of a disposable circle breathing system.",

The medicolegal concerns could be negotiated with the suppliers. As concern for the environment continues to grow worldwide, perhaps there is an opportunity to reduce landfill waste of plastic breathing hoses.
