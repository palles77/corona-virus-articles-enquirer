The outbreak of SARS caused a crisis in the tourism industry in many parts of Asia in that year. The purpose of this study is to examine and to compare the post-SARS recovery patterns of inbound arrivals from Japan, Hong Kong and USA in Taiwan. Taking the cusp catastrophe model as its foundation, this study proposes a wellgrounded approach to understanding the nature of the recovery processes and to explaining the difference between the recovery patterns displayed by arrivals from Japan and those from Hong Kong and USA. Implications regarding tourism promotion policies are drawn from the analysis.",

Tourism demand is particularly sensitive to security and health concerns , and the industry is highly susceptible to changes in the international political situation, natural disasters, and epidemics (Cavlek, 2002; Ioannides & Apostolopoulos, 1999; Richter, 2003; Sonmez, 1998; Sonmez, Apostolopoulos, & Tarlow, 1999) . In recent years major disruptions that have affected international tourism flows include the September 11, 2001 terrorist attack on the US, the Foot and Mouth outbreak in UK farms in 2001, the October 12, 2002 terrorist attack on Indonesia's resort island of Bali, the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 and the 2004 tsunami in South Asia. These events caused severe declines in tourist arrivals in those places and had a crucial impact on regional tourism Blake, Thea Sinclair, & Sugiyarto, 2003; Huang & Min, 2002; Prideaux et al., 2003) . Tourists concern about health risks is increasing. Infectious disease particularly poses a direct impact on travel behavior and on the choice of tourist destination (Cartwright, 2000) .",

Explaining the process of crisis/disaster and the recovery is rarely addressed. On the other hand, traditional methods such as regression can be used to perform data analysis to indicate what has happened, but cannot explain why. The use of the catastrophe model can help achieve this.",

            "text": "Catastrophe theory was developed in the early 1970s to provide a theoretical framework for studying discontinuous phenomena in otherwise continuous systems (Thom, 1975; Woodcock & Davis, 1978; Zeeman, 1976 Zeeman, , 1977 . Catastrophe phenomena are ''a class of dynamic processes that exhibit a sudden and large scale change in at least one variable in correspondence with relatively small changes in other variables'' (Brown, 1995, p . 1) (e.g., water suddenly boils, ice melts, earthquake, and stock market crash). In some ways the original designation of the dynamics as ''catastrophic'' is unfortunate because this term is colloquially used to describe extreme and negative changes (Lockwood & Lockwood, 1993) . In the mathematical usage, the term ''catastrophe'' means a process that is manifested as sudden changes in the state of the system (e.g., the shift of an animal's behavior from attack to submission, Saunders, 1980) . The theory was popularized in the early 1970s, and has been applied to human and social science (e.g., Bigelow, 1982; Guastello, 1982; Herbig, 1991; Kauffman & Oliva, 1994; Poston & Stewart, 1996; Saunders, 1980; Sheridan & Abelson, 1983; Zeeman, 1976 Zeeman, , 1977 . Some controversy in the application of the theory has been discussed (e.g., Kolata, 1977; Sussman & Zahler, 1978a , 1978b Zahler & Sussman, 1977) . The main controversy includes excessive reliance on qualitative methods, inappropriate quantization in some applications, and the use of excessively restrictive or narrow mathematical assumptions. However, one advantage of the theory is that the most important idea associated with it can be learned without getting into the detailed mechanics of catastrophe theory itself.",

As the disease continued to spread rapidly, this global alert was followed on March 15, 2003 by a recommendation that emergency travel restrictions be imposed. Such advisories have been extremely rare in the history of WHO. Governments adopted emergency measures to combat the spread of the disease, appealing to both businesses and individuals to keep unnecessary travel, meetings etc. to a minimum. Besides the direct impact on global economic activity, the fear of infection and the quarantine measures being imposed by governments around the world led many people to cancel or change their travel plans; the SARS epidemic, therefore, had a severe negative impact on the global travel and tourism industry. World Tourism Organization (WTO) statistics indicated that the number of outbound trips made in 2003 fell to about 694 million, representing a decline of 8.6 million or 1.2% from the year before, the biggest drop recorded in recent years and severely affecting the tourism industry worldwide (WTO, 2004) .",

However, Japanese tourists tend to have a high preference for safe and passive activities (Pizam & Jeong, 1996; Pizam, Verbeke, & Steel, 1997) . As a result, the willingness of Japanese tourists to visit Taiwan fell sharply due to the adverse impact of SARS outbreak. It is known that the traveling purposes that do qualify as tourism include recreation, visiting friends and relatives, and business (Weaver & Oppermann, 2000, p. 29) . However, only the purpose of recreation is considered in this study. According to the statistics of the TTB, before the outbreak of the SARS, the number of Japanese tourist arrivals (only for the purpose of recreation) in Taiwan averaged around 50,000 per month. During the SARS period, the number of Japanese arrivals declined sharply from 60,786 in March 2003 to 1227 in June, the steepest drop ever recorded in history. After Taiwan was officially removed from the list of SARS-affected areas on July 2003, there was a slight rebound in the number of fully independent travelers from Japan. The number of Japanese tour groups, however, remained very low. The TTB immediately launched aggressive promotion campaigns in the Japanese market to jack up the tourism demand. The number of inbound tourists altogether from Japan started bouncing up slowly and but steadily since August 2003, it was until September 2004 the Japanese travelers regained the pre-SARS level of 50,000-plus arrivals per month (see Fig. 1 ).",

The right hand side surface belongs to the original state; the left hand side surface belongs to the terminal state. The change of the system state can be perceived as the process of a ball rolling from one side of the state surface to the other. As shown in Fig. 2 , when the ball rolls from the original state (point M) to the left, an abrupt change of system state occurs at the edge of the pleat (point p), i.e., the system state drops from the surface of the original state to the lower surface of the terminal state. The edge of the pleat at which a sudden jump (or threshold effect) of the system state takes place is the critical line of the catastrophe phenomenon. The change of system state in a cusp catastrophe system is reversible. However, in the backward journey from the terminal state (point N) to the original one, the reversal of the system state does not occur at the previous point p but at a farther right point q which locates on the edge of the lower surface of the terminal state. This phenomenon where the critical point of the recovery process does not coincide with that of the original state change process, but locates at a farther away position (or equivalently with a time lag comparing to the ''supposedly to occur'' time point) is called the hysteresis effect of a catastrophe system (The forth and back tracks of the state change processes shown on the state surface should be aligned together, but are drawn as separated lines for the convenience of illustration.). The hysteresis phenomenon represents the effect of system memory or the inertia of the system. Thus for a changed system to recover its original state, it must be ''overcorrected'' with extra efforts. The existence of hysteresis effect also calls for the need to exercise a deliberate ''unfreezing'' (to break the ice of system inertia) endeavor before any drastic change of the state of a system can bring about.",

The downward pointing b axis with a value !0, represents the perceived risk of the travelers of the origin country.

Thus Japanese tourists were more alert and sensitive to this subject. Consequently after Taiwan was removed from the list of SARS-affected area (the reason for ''not come'' was removed), the majority of the Japanese tourists still chose ''not come'', altered their decision only until they felt fully safe regarding the situation in Taiwan.

The existence of the hysteresis effect will be determined by whether the tourist arrivals fully return to the pre-SARS level not immediately after the removal of SARS alert but until much later time. In other words, to test the applicability of the cusp catastrophe model to the cases in this study, it is sufficient to use only two variables, namely the state variable x (reflected by tourist arrivals) and the normal factor a.

The inbound tourist market in Taiwan was severely hit in 1999 in the aftermath of the 921 earthquake. The earthquake, of 7.3 Richter scale, killed 2400 people, injured 8000, and left about 100,000 homeless. It destroyed and damaged infrastructure that served residents and tourists. Compared to previous years, international tourism to Taiwan dropped by 15% from September to December 1999 (see, e.g., Huan et al., 2004; Huang & Min, 2002) . To exclude the influence of the 921 earthquake, we use the data on inbound arrivals from Hong Kong, Japan and USA over the period of January 2001 through August 2005. We classify the data into four stages for comparison purpose. Stage 1 is the pre-SARS period Regression analysis with dummy variables that represent different stages is used to test for the significance of the threshold effect, binary modality and hysteresis effects. The consumer price index in Taiwan (CPI, with the base of 2001) and the exchange rate to US dollars are controlled for to exclude their potential influences on inbound arrivals.

The studies on the subjects of crisis, disaster and their recovery, in the past, are mainly addressing the economic impacts and the prospects for crisis management. The issue regarding the pre-through-post process of the incident is rarely dealt with mainly because of its complexity. This study has demonstrated that the catastrophe theory is useful to describe the disastrous process and to explain its underlying causal relationships among the key factors. It is plausible to argue that the same approach (including statistical verification) can be applicable to analyze other disasters in the tourism market, for instance, the 2002 terrorist attack in Bali, the 2004 tsunami in South Asia, and the 2005 Hurricane Katrina in New Orleans. New insights can be drawn from such an application. Natural and social phenomena can be described and well understood by using catastrophe theory (e.g., Aubin, 2004) , as demonstrated for the post-SARS tourist arrival recovery patterns in this study. However, due to the limitation of data availability on the splitting factor b, this study does not have the opportunity to further calibrate the cusp model. Establishing a database for the splitting factor b becomes desirable in the tourism arena. Moreover, how the splitting factor can be well measured is interesting and needs to be further studied.",
