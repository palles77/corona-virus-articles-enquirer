We consider a deterministic model for the transmission dynamics of the Zika virus infectious disease that spreads in, both humans and vectors, through horizontal and vertical transmission. The total populations of both humans and mosquitoes are assumed to be constant. Our models consist of a system of eight differential equations describing the human and vector populations during the different stages of the disease. We have included the hospitalization/isolation class in our model to see the effect of the controlling strategy. We determine the expression for the basic reproductive number R 0 in terms of horizontal as well as vertical disease transmission rates.",

It is also shown that when R 0 > 1, there exists a unique endemic equilibrium. We showed that the endemic equilibrium point is globally asymptotically stable when it exists. We were able to prove this result in a reduced model. Furthermore, we conducted an uncertainty and sensitivity analysis to recognize the impact of crucial model parameters on R 0 . The uncertainty analysis yields an estimated value of the basic reproductive number R 0 = 1.54. Assuming infection prevalence in the population under constant control, optimal control theory is used to devise an optimal hospitalization/isolation control strategy for the model. The impact of isolation on the number of infected individuals and the accumulated cost is assessed and compared with the constant control case.",

Although Esteva (Esteva and Vargas, 2000) discussed vertical disease transmission it was among vectors in a Dengue transmission. Our deterministic model for Zika virus transmission includes horizontal and vertical transmission in both humans and vectors. As stated previously, it has been suggested that Zika virus can spread to newborns from their mothers, and we therefore feel that an accurate model must include the vertical transmission. Our work is an extension of our previous model (Imran et al., 2017) by including a population group that is using controlling measures. In the previous work, we considered death due to the infection and the total human and vector populations were functions of time. The previous model did not possess global stability for both disease-free and endemic equilibriums. We showed a backward bifurcation phenomenon. The current model has constant population size. Since death cases reported from Zika fever were negligible, we take disease-induced mortality to be zero. There is no backward bifurcation and the steady states results are global. Since the only way to control the disease is to isolate patients who have been infected with the Zika virus, we included a new population compartment consisting of hospitalized individuals. We have calculated the basic reproductive number associated with our model that guarantees the elimination of the disease. Finally, using optimal control techniques, we also propose and analyze the control strategies for decrease infected individuals while minimizing the costs and resources simultaneously.",

Susceptible individuals get infected with Zika fever virus (due to contact with infected vectors) at a rate \u03bb h and thus enter the exposed class E h . In order to consider vertical transmission in our model, we make the assumption (see, e.g., Li et al., 2001 ) that a fraction of newborn individuals from parents in the E h (t) and I h (t) classes will be infected, and thus remain in E h class before becoming infectious. We have assumed that the hospitalized individuals do not contribute to vertical transmission. Population in each class is removed at the natural death rate \u03bc h . We assumed a lifelong immunity for humans who recovered from Zika virus. The exposed individuals who got an infection, move to infectious class at a rate \u03be. The infected population recovers from the Zika fever at a rate \u03b8 I and some infected individuals are transferred to hospitalized class at a rate \u03c4. The hospitalized population recovered at a rate of \u03b8 H .",

The only way to control this disease is to reduce the contact rate either by killing the mosquitoes or using the protective measure like mosquito repellents, nets etc. The effective contacts will be further reduced by isolating the infected humans. Isolation of individuals with disease symptoms constitutes what is probably the first infection control measure since the beginning of recorded human history (Hethcote, 2000) . Over the decades, these control measures have been applied, with varying degrees of success, to combat the spread of some emerging and re-emerging diseases such as leprosy, plague, cholera, typhus, yellow fever, smallpox, diphtheria, tuberculosis, measles, Ebola, pandemic influenza and, more recently, severe acute respiratory syndrome (Gumel et al., 2003; Imran et al., 2013; Lipsitch et al., 2003; Lloyd-Smith et al., 2003) . Chavez et al. analyzed a SAIQR model in detail, to investigate the effect of isolation on influenza (Vivas-Barber et al., 2015) . They used the isolation (quarantine) I-Q model, where the infected population is isolated. We have included epidemiological factors like permanent or partial immunity after recovery as well as intervention control measures through the inclusion of a hospitalized (or isolated) class, H h .",

            "text": "Now, we discuss the numerical solutions of the optimality system and the corresponding optimal control obtained using \u03b6 = 0.5. The optimal strategy is obtained by solving the optimal system consisting of both the state system as well as the adjoint system. Since there are initial conditions present for the state equations, we start solving them with a guess for \u03c4 using the fourth-order forward Runge-Kutta method. The adjoint equations are then solved using the fourth-order backward Runge-Kutta method because of the presence of final conditions. Then, the controls are updated by using a convex combination of the previous control and the value from the characterization given above. This process is repeated until we obtain a desired accuracy of convergence (Fig. 7) . Fig. 8 represents the optimal isolation(hospitalization) strategy to be employed to minimize the cost and the infected population. Considering the practical constraints, an upper bound of 0.5 was chosen for the optimal hospitalization control. The figure shows that initially, the optimal level remains at the upper bound of 0.5 after which it declines steadily to 0. This implies that in the early phase of the endemic breakout, keeping the control at the upper bound would help in decreasing the number of infected individuals. Fig. 9 captures the dynamics of the infected population (I H ) by virtue of a comparison between the infected host population under optimal control and constant control. It can be seen that the decrease in the number of infected individuals is greater with optimal control as compared to that with constant control. Furthermore, in contrast with a constant control, the infected population remains lower when an optimal control is applied. Fig. 10 shows a comparison between the costs associated with optimal and different constant control strategies. It is clear that the cost associated with different control strategies is higher as compared to that of optimal control. It is important to note that high constant isolation rate (\u03c4 = 0.4) incurs almost the same cost as the of optimal control. However, practically it is highly unlikely to implement these high constant controls primarily due to the lack of required resources and facilities. Fig. 11 captures the effect of the change in effective contact rate over the optimal control strategy. It is clear from the simulation that an increase in the contact rate may or may not lead to higher rates of hospitalization.",

This model features the study of Zika fever by considering vertical transmission in both humans as well as vectors. The basic reproductive number R 0 is formulated by using a next-generation matrix. This reproductive number is simplified in order to better understand the effect of vertical transmission parameters. It is shown that the disease-free steady state is globally asymptotically stable when the basic reproductive number (R 0 ) is less than 1. The model has a unique endemic equilibrium when the reproduction number R 0 exceeds unity. This equilibrium is shown to be globally asymptotically stable when the reproduction number R 0 exceeds unity under the reduced model. It is locally asymptotically stable when we consider a full model. We performed a parameter based global uncertainty and sensitivity analysis on R 0 . The uncertainty analysis yields an estimated value of the basic reproductive number R 0 = 1.54 with 95% confidence interval (1.3491, 1.7669). This estimated value of R 0 is close to the calculated value of basic reproductive using real data (Villela et al., 2017 ). Our previous model had an estimated basic reproductive number R 0 = 1.31 with 95% confidence interval (1.23, 1.39) given in Imran et al. (2017) . Our sensitivity analysis on the Zika model parameters showed that the most influential parameters are the effective contact rates, the recovery rate of the infected individuals and the birth rate of mosquitoes.",
