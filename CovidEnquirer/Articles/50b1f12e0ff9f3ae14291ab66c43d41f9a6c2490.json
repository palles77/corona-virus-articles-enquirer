            "text": "Murine hepatitis viruses are members of the group of RNA-containing enveloped viruses termed Coronaviruses (Tyrrell et aL, 1978) . The agents cause a wide variety of diseases in rodents including hepatitis, enteritis, and encephalomyelitis, the disease type varying with the strain of virus, and age and genetic background of the host (Wege et al, 1982) . In some virus-host combinations, persistent infections occur resulting in chronic hepatitis or chronic demyelination of the central nervous systems (Wege et aL, 1982) . This later observation, centered mainly on studies with the JHM strain of the virus (Cheever et aL, 1949; Weiner, 1973; Sorensen et al., 1980) or a temperature-sensitive mutant of it (Knobler et aL, 1982) , has received considerable interest as a potential model relevant for the study of slowly degenerative neuropathies (Weiner, 1973; Weiner et aL, 1973; Sorensen et aL, 1980) . These agents can also readily establish persistent infections in vitro in both neural and nonneural cell lines (Lucas et ak, 1977 (Lucas et ak, , 1978 Stohlman and Weiner, 1978) , without requirements of viral modifications or en-' Presented in preliminary form at the coronavirus workshop in Zeist, The Netherlands, June 1983. vironmental manipulations such as the presence of viral antibody or interferon. Our previous results have indicated that when the infection was of the persistent type, virus replication was almost invariably thermosensitive and that this was due to unknown factors under host control, since the progeny virions themselves were not temperature sensitive (Lucas et ak, 1977 (Lucas et ak, , 1978 . In addition, one cell line, the RN2 Schwannoma, had the unique ability to discriminate between the MHV, strain and the more neurotropic strain JHM (Lucas et aL, 1977) . JHM was replicated persistently in this line, whereas, MHV, replication was aborted. At present, it is unclear as to the mechanism of persistence or restriction in this cell line. These observations coupled with others (Stohlman and Weiner, 1978; Holmes and Behnke, 1982) strongly imply that the host cell has a profound influence in regulating the replication of these agents. As a further approach to analyzing the host functions involved in viral persistence and restriction, somatic cell hybrids have been formed between mouse L2 cells, a cell line totally permissive for both MHV3 and JHM infection, and the rat RN2 cells. The results described in this report indicate that the L-cell functions appear to be dominant over the RN2 controlled ones since both viral agents replicated lytically in the somatic cell hybrids.",

As shown in Fig. 3 , the enzymatic activity produced in the hybrid cells was inactivated by heat at a rate intermediate between the mouse and rat enzymes. This is consistent with the presence in the hybrids of both mouse and rat fi-glucuronidases since the heat inactivation was similar to that of a l-to-l mixture of cell extracts from the two parental lines. Taken together the above results indicate that these cells are authentic mouse-rat hybrids. Morphologically, these hybrid cells did not differ dramatically from the two parental lines. Some hybrids contained cells displaying the flattened irregularly shaped morphology of the RN2-2 cell line, whereas, others contained cells roughly triangular in shape with well-defined margins characteristic of the L2 cell line.

Previous results indicated that mouse L2 cells supported the replication of both the JHM and MHVa virus strains in a lytic fashion involving extensive cell destruction through syncytial formation. When RN2 cells were used as host, JHM replicated persistently with restricted cytopathology in a temperaturesensitive manner. MHV3 replication was totally restricted in the RN2 cells (Lucas et al, 1977 (Lucas et al, , 1978 . The availability of somatic cell hybrids between these two cell lines permitted an examination of which host cell type dominantly affected the virus replication process. Confluent monolayer cultures of several independently selected hybrid cells were infected at a multiplicity of infection (m.o.i.) of 0.05 with either JHM or MHVa, maintained at either 32 or 39\", and virus production determined after 24 hr. As shown in Table 3 , the hybrid cells could replicate both JHM and MHV3 at both temperatures. The virus yields for the most part were similar to those obtained with the L2 TGROuaR7-1 cell line as host and considerably higher than those obtained with the RN2 cell. Accompanying these high levels of virus production was an extensive cytopathic effect (cpe) resulting from syncytial formation. By 24 hr at 39\", essentially all the cells in the monolayer were involved and total destruction and cell lifting had occurred. A similar cpe was observed at 32\", however, total destruction was delayed until 30 to 36 hr postinfection. These effects were apparent with the L2 TGROuaR7-1, and hybrid lines 1, 2, 3, 4; 5, 7, and 8. Hybrid 6 showed some differences. This hybrid, which produced lower yields of virus than the other hybrid lines at 24 hr (Table 3) , showed very little, if any, cpe, at both temperatures with JHM virus. If a cpe was present it was restricted to less than 10% of the cells in the population. Similar results were also obtained with MHV3 infections, although the cpe was somewhat more extensive, perhaps involving 20 to 30% of the cells in the population. The cpe observed with either virus in this line appeared to be restricted since longer incubation periods up to 7 days did not result in a more extensive cpe even though 30-80% of the cells scored as infectious centers. The extent of the cpe was also not affected by increasing the m.o.i. to 5 even though the number of cells scoring as infectious centers was 80%. Initially hybrid 6 cells could produce either JHM or MHV3 virus at 39\". However, after about 1 week in culture these infected cells lost the ability to shed virus at 39' even though they continued to produce virus in a cyclical manner at 32\". At this time, if cells shedding virus at 32\" were shifted to 39\" there was a cessation of virus production. The properties of cyclical release of virus and restricted virus replication at the elevated temperature is reminiscent of the JHM infection of RN2 cells in which from 0.1 to 10% of the cells are infected (Lucas et al, 19'77, 19'78) . In the case with hybrid 6 cells, however, both JHM and MHV3 were replicated and the number of infected cells was from 50 to 80%. Ten subclones of the hybrid 6 cells behaved similarly when challenged with virus.",

This conclusion is based on the demonstration that the hybrids support the replication in a lytic manner of both JHM and MHVB at 32 and 39\". The features of these infections are similar to those of L2 cells with a comparable time course, virus yields, and cytopathic effects. Such features are not characteristic of the infections of RN2-2 cells (Lucas et al, 1977 (Lucas et al, , 1978 . It is conceivable, however, that one of the rat chromosomes codes for a dominantly acting factor which is responsible for virus resistance or persistence. Since chromosome loss does occur in cell-cell hybrids (Francke and Francke, 1981) , perhaps this chromosome is frequently lost which would then lead to virus susceptibility in the hybrids. This seems unlikely, however, since although there was variability among the rat chromosomes present in the hybrid cells, there was no apparent preference for the loss of specific rat chromosomes.",

Several of the lines have been kept in continuous culture for up to 8 months and periodically screened for susceptibility to lytic virus infection.

To my knowledge, this is the first study with cell hybrids formed between a cell line that is totally permissive for virus production and one that supports either a persistent infection or is restrictive to infection. The result that the totally permissive state (i.e., the L cell) is dominant over the restrictive or persistent state (i.e., the RN2 cell) is not unlike other host-virus systems where it has been demonstrated that permissive host functions are dominant over nonpermissive ones (Miller et aZ., 1974; Garver, et aL, 1980; Lemons et a& 1980) .",

A., and URLAUB, G. (1976) At present it is unclear as to the nature of the host cell functions that are involved in coronavirus persistence. Recent evidence suggests that in one system the ability of the host cell to resist infection and withstand cytopathic effects may be important parameters (Mizzen et a& 1983) . It is thus unclear as to the nature and role that the L2 functions play in overcoming the RN2-2 controlled persistent, and thermosensitive replication of JHM, and the restriction of MHVB. Knowledge of these L-cell functions might prove useful in an understanding of both coronavirus persistence and restriction. It is of interest to note that although MHV3 replication is restricted in RN2 cells, if it is permitted to initiate replication as it does in hybrid 6 then after about 1 week in culture a persistent infection not unlike that of the JHM infection of RN2-2 cells can be obtained. Since there are available several different cell lines that can become persistently infected with the JHM and MHV3 virus strains (Lucas et al., 1978) , it will be of interest to determine whether these cell lines behave in a manner similar to the RN2 cells when somatic cell hybrids are formed with the mouse L2 cells. Such studies are currently in progress. ",
