It can be used to improve access to health services because it shows the factors that affect health service utilization such as household income, distance to health facilities, service availability, health insurance, and prices of the services offered. Moreover, demand analysis can help identify factors that affect patients' perceptions of the quality of medical care, enabling policy makers to implement interventions to change patterns of health service usage in socially desired ways. These issues are important because health care helps the population only when it is used to maintain and promote health or to cure or prevent illnesses. Information on demand patterns could further be used to improve equity in health outcomes because it reveals social groups that are excluded from basic health care due to poverty or other factors. Such health care can then be delivered to vulnerable groups through targeted interventions. Thus, evidence on demand patterns provides policy makers with the information they need to address efficiency and equity issues in health care. Broadly conceived, health-care demand analysis includes investigations into behaviors and practices that improve health.",

            "text": "The economic approach to the analysis of health-care utilization is based on three ideas. The first idea is that people know what they can do to maintain health and prevent or cure illnesses, and they are capable of ranking the actions that can be taken. In other words, people are endowed with the abilities or preferences for ranking health services. The second idea is that the material means that people possess, such as income and assets, limit the type and intensity of the actions they can take to maintain or promote health. This limitation arises from the fact that health services, like other goods, have prices that consumers must pay directly or indirectly given limited incomes or assets. The third idea is that, faced with this limitation, people try to do the best for themselves. Expressed strongly, the idea says that people make choices and behave in ways that enable them to maximize the benefits from health-care consumption given their income or wealth. This maximization hypothesis is the cornerstone of much economic analysis, including demand analysis. Not surprisingly, the hypothesis is the subject of intense debate in the health-care demand literature. Since individuals and households possess limited information about health care, the assumption that this care is optimally used to confront illnesses is too strong. For example, the assumption is contradicted by consumption behaviors that harm health, such as smoking, drug abuse, and unhealthy eating habits. Economists have to date not been able to respond convincingly to the persistent criticism that people do not possess the ability and the information required to engage in optimizing behavior. However, in order to derive the strong prediction of demand theory, that people respond to price incentives, a view on optimization assumption is required. Economists generally assume that people behave as if their purpose in life is to do the best for themselves using their scarce resources. This assumption permits a straightforward derivation of policy relevant prediction of demand models that is generally in agreement with everyday experience. For example, the models predict that people will reduce consumption of health-care services if health-care prices are increased, provided that other factors such as income and the disease environment remain the same. Policy makers can use estimation results from these models to set appropriate prices for health-care services. Indeed, information on demand parameters is essential for evidence-based financing of health services.",

An important property of the model is that the production of health is embedded in the utility maximizing behavior of a household member. The household member is assumed to have preferences over health-neutral goods, health-related goods, and over the health status. To simplify the analysis, it is usually assumed that the household members share the same preferences about health care and other commodities. Under this assumption, all household members act as one unit when demanding healthcare services so that the utility function of any member can be expressed as:",

            "text": "In the ensuing discussion, reference is made mainly to eqn [4.3] above, as it is the only direct demand function for health services in the equation system [4.1-4.3]. Equation [4.3] states that the empirical health service demand, i.e., the observed health service utilization pattern, is a function of exogenous prices, P, exogenous income, I, and m. The term exogenous in this context means that over the relevant period, the household is powerless to change the key factors that determine health-care demand, namely, the commodity prices, income, and unobserved parameter m. This demand function is to be understood as a quantity-price relationship. That is, the function depicts how the utilization of a particular health service is affected by its own prices holding other factors constant. Other relevant factors that can easily be incorporated in the equation include the time prices of using the health service in question and education, age, gender, and location of patients or their households. Equation [4.3] can be used to estimate the effect of the price of a health service on the demand for that service; this is called the own-price effect. It can also be used to estimate the impact of the price of other goods on the demand for the health service, called the cross-price effect. An interesting cross-effect that can be estimated is the impact of the price of a health-neutral good on health-care demand. This cross-price effect, like all price effects, manifests itself through the budget constraint. It is possible to demonstrate through further manipulation of eqn [4.3] that efficacy of medical care is a key parameter in demand predictions (see Rosenzweig and Schultz, 1983) . That is, in order to accurately predict the demand for health services, information is needed both on the effectiveness of medical treatments and on the estimated impacts of prices and incomes.",

The unified demand model has been used to investigate determinants of birth weight in both developed and developing countries. For example, in the United States, Rosenzweig and Schultz (1982) , showed that smoking during pregnancy and delay in using prenatal care reduce birth weight. African evidence generated using the model shows that tetanus immunization during pregnancy is associated with improvements in birth weight (Dow et al., 1999) .",

Thus, the amount of health produced and the quantities of the inputs used to produce it are determined by households in consultation with health-care providers. As previously noted, the motivation for the unified model is to answer the policy question: How does utilization of health-care services affect health? In order to answer this question well, eqn [2] must be estimated using a special econometric technique known as the two-stage least squares (TSLS) method (Wooldridge, 2002) . In the first stage of the technique, health-care demand equations are estimated using exogenous prices and incomes as explanatory variables. In the second stage, demands predicted from those first-stage equations are used to estimate the health production function (Wooldridge, 2002) . This procedure permits a statistically correct identification and measurement of the effect of health-care services on health. Despite the attractiveness of the unified model, the data required for its estimation may not exist. Moreover, by making some reasonable assumptions about the correlation between health-care utilization and health status, much simpler demand models can be specified and estimated.",

The models have been used extensively to study health service utilization in developed and developing countries. Results from these studies show that changes in relative prices shift households from one health-care sector to another. In particular, an increase in user fees at government health facilities in developing countries has been shown to shift patients from these clinics to traditional and informal medications of low quality. The results suggest that health-care financing methods can have major effects on population health and should be designed with care. Information on health-care-seeking behavior obtained using discrete choice models of health-care demand can help in designing appropriate health-care financing policies. A related and consistent finding from the discrete choice demand literature is that the poor and the vulnerable groups are very sensitive to price changes. Thus, in the event of an increase in the cost of drugs or consultation, for example, health-care utilization by the poor is reduced proportionately more than that of the non-poor. This finding can be used to target public subsidies within the health sector in ways that improve equity in health service utilization. The literature further shows that service quality is a key determinant of patients' choice of medical facilities and of the intensity at which the facilities are used. Information on determinants of the quality of care can be used to increase health-care utilization by the population without changing the existing service costs. For example, the information can be used to encourage mothers to deliver at the health facilities rather than at home. Despite these advantages of discrete choice models, their estimation can be very demanding in data and skill requirements (see Culyer and Newhouse, 2000) .",

In a setting in which households are imperfectly informed about medical care, quality is an overriding determinant of demand. Health care is sought because it increases the probability of maintaining good health or of being cured or the probability of preventing an illness (see Leonard, 2003) . If households have little or no information about the benefits of health services, they might not use them even when provided free of charge. Thus, institutions that help households to learn about health-care quality can have an important impact on demand. The agency relationship that universally exists between the patient and a healthcare provider is the prime example of an institution that ideally solves the information problem just noted. That is, since a health-care provider is trained in diagnosis and treatment of illness, she is knowledgeable enough to decide the type and quantity of care for the patient upon being consulted. However, even in a situation where the provider has full information about disease diagnosis and treatment, she cannot accurately predict the effect of treatment prescribed, because the patient might not comply with that treatment. As regards the patient, he too cannot tell whether the provider is using her medical expertise to the fullest extent possible or in his best interest. Thus, in practice, the standard agency relationship presented in the literature does little to assure either the provider or the patient as to the quality of care being provided. The reason is that health-care quality, i.e., the probability of prescribed treatment maintaining health or curing a disease, also depends on unobservable efforts of both the caregiver and the patient. Leonard (2003) has shown that an implicit contract between the caregiver and the patient that allows the cost of treatment to be paid after its effect on illness has been observed improves the standard agency relationship, thereby increasing the demand for health care. The outcome-contingent payment mechanism increases demand, both because it reduces the patient's risk of receiving ineffective treatment and because it provides an incentive for the caregiver to provide quality treatment so that she can be paid.",

            "text": "The market for health-care services offered by traditional healers, particularly in Africa, offers an excellent opportunity to study the effect of outcome-contingent payment mechanisms on health-care demand. The healers are able to enforce the implicit contract surrounding the outcome-contingent payment method because of the powers that social belief systems in some societies ascribe to them. For example, in many rural communities in Africa, healers are believed to have the power to harm patients who refuse to pay agreed fees after successful treatment. Because of their fear of this power, patients pay treatment fees voluntarily after being cured. Leonard (2003) shows that poor households in rural Cameroon rely importantly on traditional healers for medical treatments. Patients from poor households preferred traditional healers partly because of the outcome-contingent contracts that offered them a form of credit, and partly due to the quality of the healers' services, as measured by the unobservable effort they devoted to treating long-lasting illnesses. As producers of health, patients and households work better with healers than with modern health caregivers to treat chronic illnesses.",

            "text": "One may doubt whether outcome-contingent payment systems are applicable in other settings. However, there is evidence that equivalent payment systems can be designed. For example, the Grameen bank model of credit extension to poor people, especially women, without them offering any collateral, which originally started in Bangladesh (Yunus, 2006) , has some parallels with the outcome-contingent payment for traditional medicine in Africa. In a Grameen bank context, the peer pressure to honor a loan agreement and the social networks through which the borrower is monitored guarantee repayment, whereas in the traditional medicine context, credit repayment is ensured by the collective belief that the healer has the power to harm defaulters. In both cases, institutions play a role in repayment. In the African context, the debtor is anonymous, but the sharing of the common belief as to the powers of the healers leads to repayment. In the context of a grameen (i.e., village) bank, the debtor is known to peers and to other village members, and this puts pressure on the debtor not to defray the loan to avoid punishment such as ostracism from a group. The great lesson from the Grameen model of credit extension for health-care financing is that there are substitutes to collaterals in the credit market. Because nonpayment of credit by a group member can reduce creditworthiness of the whole group, the group has an incentive to devise mechanisms to help a lender recover a loan. Thus, group reputation, which is valued in the marketplace, serves as a collateral for credit. Yunus (2006) has strongly argued that institutions might exist or could be created that can allow extension of credit to beggars with a small risk of default.",

Under this system, the patient or his representative knows he would be legally compelled to pay if he defaults, so he pays. Similarly, the caregiver knows he would not be paid if his performance is found to be inadequate; so he tries to put forth a sufficient amount of unobservable effort. This situation is quite similar to the case of traditional medicine in Africa where outcome-based contracts are prevalent.",

Patients often incur substantial opportunity costs in terms of the time they spend to travel to sources of treatment and to wait for treatment there. Thus, time costs affect health-care demand. However, in the models discussed so far, the effect of time on the health-care making process itself, is rarely analyzed. Instead, what is analyzed is the effect of the time cost on the outcome of that decision process. For example, if the outcome of the decision process is to seek health care outside the home, the time cost will determine the facility chosen, other things constant. Typically, empirical demand analysis of this kind (Sahn et al., 2003) is conducted over short durations in a life cycle, such as 2 weeks or 1-3 months, i.e., the durations over which health service utilization data are available.",

For example, a smoker might decide to quit smoking today, but fail to implement this decision in subsequent periods, a behavior that is inconsistent with his rational decisionmaking processes at different points in time. People who display this type of behavior are, for obvious reasons, said to have time-inconsistent preferences. The reasons for this behavior might include the nature of time discount rates and attitudes toward risk. Since persons with timeinconsistent preferences lack self-control, with regard to consumption that is harmful to health, a study designed to generate information to help them change behavior should not focus on their demand for addictive substances, but on things that strengthen their decisions against addiction. In the case of smoking, such a study could investigate the effects of smoking bans on smokers' intentions to quit smoking. Persons who want to quit smoking but cannot do so for lack of self-control, would support bans on cigarettes or increases in cigarette prices (Kan, 2007) , because such policies help them achieve their intentions. This is an example of how demand analysis can be used to uncover and implement policies that induce health-improving behaviors. A similar analysis can be extended to socially undesirable lifestyles, such as relationships involving multiple sexual partners that need to be understood when designing policies to control HIV/AIDS (Over et al., 2006) .",

The article has further shown how information asymmetries and risks in health care can be incorporated in the standard models of demand to improve their predictive powers and policy relevance. Future research on health-care demand should focus on these newer modeling efforts, using data from both household surveys and field experiments to test the hypotheses generated by the models.",
