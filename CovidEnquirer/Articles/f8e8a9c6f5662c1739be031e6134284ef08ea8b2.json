            "text": "Viral detection is critical for controlling disease spread and progression. Recent emerging threats including the Zika and Ebola virus outbreaks highlight the cost and difficulty in responding rapidly. In low-resource areas, a key obstacle is quick and accurate detection of viruses near the point of care. To address these challenges, we develop a platform for low-cost and rapid detection of viral RNA with DNA nanoswitches designed to mechanically reconfigure in response to specific viruses. Using Zika virus as a model system, we show non-enzymatic detection of viral RNA to the attomole level, with selective and multiplexed detection between related viruses and viral strains. For clinical-level sensitivity in biological fluids, we paired the assay with a sample preparation step using either RNA extraction or isothermal preamplification. Our assay can be performed with minimal or no lab infrastructure, and is readily adaptable (with ~24-hour development time) to detect other viruses. Given this versatility, we expect that further development and field implementation will improve our ability to detect emergent viral threats and ultimately limit their impact.",

Technological advancements in structural biology and genomics have been important for identifying viruses, and for advancing fundamental viral research and antiviral therapeutics. 4 However, clinical methods for robust, low-cost and rapid detection of viral infections optimized for use in low-resource areas and point-of-care (POC) mode remain a major challenge for emergent viruses.",

            "text": "Detection of RNA viruses in the clinical setting is typically performed using either immunological detection based on enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) to detect IgM antibodies or Nucleic acid testing (NAT) based on a reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assay to detect viral RNA. 5-8 Diagnosing RNA viruses is made challenging by several factors including a limited time window for detection, low or varying viral load, cross-reactive IgM antibodies, and laboratory resources. The detection time windows can vary widely from as short as several days to as long as several months, 5 and molecular detection techniques are usually most reliable if performed within the first two weeks of the disease. 9, 10 Depending on the timing of testing relative to infection, even highly sensitive NAT assays may still produce false negative or positive results. 6, 11 On the other hand, results from IgM serology tests often cannot distinguish related viruses or different strains of the same virus due to cross-reactivity of IgM antibodies, thus leading to false positive results. 12, 13 These detection challenges are further exacerbated when outbreaks occur in low resource settings where infrastructure for these lab-intensive tests can be lacking, accelerating the spread of disease. 7, 14, 15 In response to some of these challenges, new techniques are being developed to detect emerging viruses. Among these are methods that adopt nanoparticles, 16, 17 graphene-based biosensors, 18, 19 and CRISPRbased methods, [20] [21] [22] to name a few. Many of these proposed strategies, although based on cutting-edge technology, require multiple reactions or signal transformation steps that may make them less suitable for a resource-limited POC setting. Here, we addressed these biosensing challenges by developing an assay that uses programmable DNA nanoswitches 23, 24 for detection of viral RNA at clinically relevant levels. We validate our strategy using ZIKV as a proof-of-concept system due to its high global health relevance and continued threat due to its re-emerging mosquito-borne nature. Although ZIKV is typically associated with mild symptoms, it has been linked to devastating birth defects associated with intrauterine infections and the appearance of Guillian-Barr\u00e9 syndrome in adults. 7,10 Moreover, despite significant advances in understanding the molecular biology of ZIKV, there is still a lack of antiviral drugs and vaccines, making robust detection of ZIKV vital to controlling the spread of the disease and implementing early treatments. 25 Our strategy for detecting the presence of viral RNA is based on using DNA nanoswitches that have been designed to undergo a conformational change (from linear to looped) upon binding a target viral RNA sequence. Using ZIKV as an example, the presence of the viral RNA would be indicated by shifted migration of the looped nanoswitch by gel electrophoresis (Fig. 1A) . Importantly, the system is designed to use common nucleic acid staining of the nanoswitch itself that can intercalate thousands of dye molecules to provide an inherently strong signal. Previously, we demonstrated sensitive and specific detection of DNA oligonucleotides 26 and microRNAs (~22 nucleotides long) 27 using this approach. Applied here to viral RNA detection, we solved the challenges of detecting a long viral RNA (>10,000 nucleotides), improving the signal for long RNAs with a new signal multiplication strategy, and developing workflows for measuring viral loads in biological and mock clinical samples. We showed how multiplexing can be used to detect multiple viruses simultaneously from a single sample and demonstrated high specificity even between closely-related strains of Zika. This work enables direct detection of ZIKV RNA without amplification and paves the way toward a low-cost point-of-care assay for detection of ZIKV and other viruses.",

We made the DNA nanoswitches by hybridizing singlestranded DNA (ssDNA) oligos to linearized single-stranded M13mp18 (M13) genomic DNA in a thermal annealing ramp for 1 hour 24 and then purified them by high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). 29 For our initial detection target, we in vitro transcribed RNA from the pFLZIKV infectious plasmid containing the full length genome of the Cambodia ZIKV isolate (FSS13025) (Fig. S1 ). 30 Previous results have shown robust nanoswitch detection of small DNA and RNA sequences (20-30 nucleotides) , however, the strong secondaty structures present in long viral RNA was expected to interfere with our detection. 31, 32 To overcome this, we used a chemical fragmentation method to segment the RNA into small pieces that are mostly shorter than 200 nt ( Fig. 1B-C and S2 ). By incubating with our nanoswitch in an annealing temperature ramp, we showed successful detection of the fragmented viral RNAs by gel electrophoresis, thus validating our approach (Fig. 1D) .",

Once the long viral RNA is fragmented, the number of available target sequences increases dramatically. Since our detection signal is proportional to the number of looped nanoswitches, a nanoswitch mixture for different target sequences within the viral genome is expected to provide an increased signal. To test this, we developed an algorithm for choosing multiple sequence regions in the viral genome that can be targeted by the nanoswitches (Note S1). First, we chose the default target length as 30 nucleotides based on results from screening nanoswitches with different detection arm lengths (Fig.  S3) . Then, the algorithm selectively excluded target sequences that could form stable secondary structures (Fig. S4 ) and cross-binding with nanoswitch backbone oligos (Fig. S5) , and enforced GC content and uniqueness of sequences. Based on these criteria, we chose 18 target regions along the entire ZIKV RNA for testing and designed the nanoswitches. To facilitate use of our Matlab-based software, we have built a graphical user interface (Fig. S6 ) and made it freely available (File S1).",

All nanoswitches performed well with a molar excess of positive DNA controls, although they showed more signal variation with fragmented ZIKV RNA (Fig. S7) . We ranked the nanoswitches from strongest to weakest signal and made a series of equimolar nanoswitch mixtures. Using these mixtures, we validated our inherent signal multiplication strategy using a low concentration pool of equimolar DNA fragments to mimic the fragmented RNA. We observed that our detection signal increased steadily up to around 12 nanoswitches (Fig. 1E, F) , and then plateaued above that value. This plateau was not unexpected considering that the largest mixtures added lower performing nanoswitches that may contribute less to the overall sample. Since there was no significant change in performance between 12 and 18, we continued with using the 18 nanoswitches mix for our follow up experiments. High sensitivity is one of the key requirements for viral detection. Clinical levels of ZIKV RNA in body fluids of infected patients are often in the femtomolar range, 7,21,33 making amplification a prerequisite for most detection approaches.",

We reacted the DNA nanoswitch mixture with different amounts of fragmented RNA in a 12-hour annealing temperature ramp from 40 \u00b0C to 25 \u00b0C. The results showed visible detection for ZIKV RNA as low as 12.5 pg (~3.5 attomole) ( Fig. 1G and S8 ) in a 10 \u00b5L reaction volume. Consistent with Fig. 1F , the approach based on using a nanoswitch mix outperformed the highest performing nanoswitch used as a single agent, which had visible detection to about 50 pg (~14 attomole) (Fig. S9) . Another key requirement for a clinical viral detection assay is specificity. Since ZIKV and Dengue virus (DENV) have overlapping geographical distributions and clinical symptoms, infection with either virus may result in clinical misdiagnosis. 34 Serological diagnostic assays are known to show antibody crossreactivity between the two viruses, and DENV has some similarity to ZIKV in its envelope protein 12 and genome sequence. 21, 31 To test the specificity of our approach, we designed a similar panel of nanoswitches to detect DENV (Fig. S10) . Using the pooled nanoswitches specific for ZIKV and DENV, we mixed each set with in vitro transcribed RNA from each virus and found perfect specificity, with each assay only detecting its correct target RNA ( Fig. 2A) . Using the programmability of the nanoswitch, we further demonstrated a multiplexed system for simultaneous detection of ZIKV and DENV. In this case we modified the DENV responsive nanoswitches to form a smaller loop size (Fig. S11) , causing two distinct detection bands to migrate to different positions in the gel. Specifically, ZIKV RNA-nanoswitch complex migrated slower/higher in the gel, while the complex of DENV RNA and the nanoswitch migrated faster/lower in the gel (Fig. 2B) . Therefore, in a single reaction our nanoswitch showed differential and specific detection of ZIKV and DENV RNA. By programming different loop sizes for different targets, this assay can be expanded for up to five viral targets. 27 The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the .",

For example, in Latin America four different DENV serotypes are known to be present and co-circulate, where misdiagnosis of the infecting strain can have significant implications for treatment options. 35 Thus being able to accurately identify a circulating strain of virus broadly impacts medical care, surveillance and vector control. 36 ZIKV was first identified in Uganda in 1947 before spreading to Asia and the Americas, and ZIKV strains (classified within African or Asian lineage) share significant sequence homology. 37 To investigate if our assay can distinguish between the Asian and African lineages, we tested our nanoswitches against two ZIKV strains which have a ~89% sequence homology, namely the FSS13025 isolated from Cambodia and the MR766 strain isolated from Uganda. In designing the ZIKV strain-specific nanoswitches, we identified five target regions that each have a 5-6 nucleotide difference ( Fig. 2C and S12) . To achieve better discernment of the detection signal, the nanoswitches for the Uganda strain were designed to form a smaller loop-size than those designed for Cambodia. Next, a human hepatocellular carcinoma cell line (Huh7) was infected with either the Cambodian or Ugandan ZIKV strain. Infected cells were processed to extract total RNA, which was then fragmented and incubated with nanoswitches to probe for viral RNA from either the ZIKV Cambodia or ZIKV Uganda infected cells. The results showed that our assay was able to discriminate between two strains of the same virus even with high genetic similarities (Fig. 2D, S12) .",

            "text": "Further applying our technique to detect ZIKV RNA in biological samples, we either mock-infected or infected Huh7 cells with the Cambodia ZIKV strain at a multiplicity of infection of 1 and extracted RNA from the ZIKV infected cells at 1-, 2-and 3-days post-infection. 38 The nanoswitch assay detected ZIKV viral RNA from the infected cells but not the mock infected cells (Figs. 3A, 3B & S13 ). Our detection result shows that the copies of ZIKV RNA within infected cells steadily increased upon the infection and plateaued at 2-and 3-days post-infection (Fig. 3C) . These data demonstrate that our assay can detect ZIKV RNA in infected cell lines, and in contrast to typical RT-PCR assays without amplification of the viral RNA. Moving toward clinical applications, we aimed to demonstrate detection of relevant levels of ZIKV RNA from biological fluids. ZIKV is present in the serum, urine, and other body fluids of infected patients. 39 The viral loads can vary dramatically between individuals, body fluid, and post infection time, 6, 7 but are frequently in the subfemtomolar to femtomolar range, with ZIKV in human urine reported as high as 220 \u00d7 10 6 copies/ml (365 fM). 33 While our nanoswitch sensitivity for in vitro transcribed viral RNA in buffer approaches clinically relevant concentrations, detection from body fluids is further challenged by varying viral loads and by body fluids that can reduce the performance of the nanoswitches due to physiological conditions and nuclease activity. 26, 40 To overcome these potential difficulties, we investigated two independent solutions: 1) adding a preprocessing step to extract RNA from body fluids such as urine, or 2) adding an isothermal pre-amplification step. In the first approach, we spiked a clinically-relevant amount of in vitro transcribed ZIKV RNA into human urine and processed viral RNA extraction using a commercial RNA extraction kit. We then mixed the extracted RNA with the nanoswitches and demonstrated non-enzymatic, clinical level detection of the RNA at 0.28 pM (Fig. 4A-B & S14) . In the second approach, we demonstrated that our detection can be coupled with other amplification approaches such as nucleic acid sequence-based amplification (NASBA). 41,42 NASBA combines multiple enzymes and primers to achieve RNA amplification in a one-pot isothermal reaction (Fig. S15A) . First, we showed feasibility of the amplification of ZIKV RNA by NASBA in water, followed by nanoswitch detection (Fig. S15) . To mimic clinical samples, we spiked infectious ZIKV particles into either PBS or 10% human urine at clinical-levels (1.49 fM to 0.03 fM). From these samples our assay detected ZIKV RNA in ~5 hours (Fig. 4C-E and S15) . We went one step further and showed that our assay can be performed using a commercially available bufferless gel cartridge (ThermoFisher E-gel) and imaged on a small and potentially portable gel reader (Fig. S16) . With the help of NASBA amplification, the detection ability of our method has about 10,000-fold increase, from ~350 fM (Fig. 1G) to 0.03 fM (Fig.  4D , E) and the detection time was reduced from ~13 hours to ~5 hours (Fig. S17) .",

Moreover, DNA nanoswitch viral RNA detection strategy has femtomolar detection limit without an RNA amplification step, and attomolar detection limit when used with amplification.

Using this approach, we reached near-clinical levels of detection in urine without the use of enzyme-mediated amplification strategies. This is of significance because enzymes can be key drivers of assay cost and complexity due to requirements including cold storage/transportation, special buffers and reagents, and strict operating temperatures. These factors make enzymatic assays difficult for field use or for use in low resource areas without modern lab infrastructure. Despite these challenges, most currently available techniques rely on enzyme triggered amplification. 7, 21, 57 For our assay, we demonstrated compatibility and dramatic signal improvement with an optional enzymatic preamplification step (Fig. 4C-4E) . However, we believe that further improvements should enable complete coverage of the clinical range without enzymes.

            "text": "Two key features of our approach are simplicity and low cost. Our DNA nanoswitches align with the goals of \"frugal science\" movement, where cost and accessibility to new technologies are valued alongside typical performance metrics. 59, 60 Our nanoswitches cost around 1 penny per reaction and can be stored dry at room temperature for at least one month, and can be delivered globally without transportation or biosafety concerns. The assay consists of few steps and can be performed in a matter of hours with limited laboratory needs (Fig. S17) . Our assay uses a readout by gel electrophoresis, which is relatively inexpensive and already part of the workflow in many labs, which is comparatively simpler than many nanotechnology-based assays involving multiple incubation and wash steps. Improvements to the signal readout could potentially help make this approach even more lab independent. Successful detection with a commercially available bufferless gel system (Fig. S16) takes us a step closer to enabling field deployment of our assay, and sample preparation could be aided by other frugal science approaches such as the \"paperfuge\" 61 and low-cost thermal cycler. 62 The programmability of our system makes it versatile for a wide variety of viruses, which can be detected with high specificity as we showed for ZIKV and DENV ( Fig. 2A-2B) and for different strains of ZIKV (Fig. 2C-2D) , even in a multiplexed fashion. Here we have focused on single-stranded RNA viruses but assays for other RNA or DNA viruses could likely be developed similarly. The fast construction and purification processes can facilitate rapid production of DNA nanoswitches to detect an emerging viral threat, potentially in as little as 1-2 days from knowledge of the target sequences, limited mostly by oligo synthesis turnaround time (Fig. S17) . Due to the low cost of the test, our assay could also be useful for monitoring viral progression over time in patients, or for testing potentially infected insects or animals. Therefore, with future optimization towards point-of-care clinical applications in resource-limiting environments, the platform we describe here has a potential to improve accuracy and ease of diagnosis in humans, non-human vectors and other animals. Ultimately this can enhance our ability to control spread of infection and more rapidly respond to emerging viral threats, working toward a reduced death toll and economic burden.",
