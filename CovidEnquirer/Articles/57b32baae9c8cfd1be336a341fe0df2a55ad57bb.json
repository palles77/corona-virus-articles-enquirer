            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is believed to be an autoimmune disease in which autoreactive T cells infiltrate the central nervous system (CNS). Animal models of MS have shown that CNS-specific T cells are present in the peripheral T cell repertoire of healthy mice and cause autoimmune disease only when they are activated by immunization. T cell entry into the CNS is thought to require some form of peripheral activation because the blood-brain barrier prohibits trafficking of this tissue by naive cells. We report here that naive T cells can traffic to the CNS without prior activation. Comparable numbers of T cells are found in the CNS of both healthy recombinase activating gene (Rag) \u03ea / \u03ea T cell receptor (TCR) transgenic mice and nontransgenic mice even when the transgenic TCR is specific for a CNS antigen. Transgenic T cells isolated from the CNS that are specific for non-CNS antigens are phenotypically naive and proliferate robustly to antigenic stimulation in vitro. Strikingly, transgenic T cells isolated from the CNS that are specific for myelin basic protein (MBP) are also primarily phenotypically naive but are unresponsive to antigenic stimulation in vitro. Mononuclear cells from the CNS of MBP TCR transgenic but not nontransgenic mice can suppress the response of peripheral MBP-specific T cells in vitro. These results indicate that naive MBP-specific T cells can traffic to the CNS but do not trigger autoimmunity because they undergo tolerance induction in situ.",

The pool of autoreactive T cells available for activation is limited to a large extent by mechanisms of tolerance induction that eliminate self-reactive T cells (1) . Animal models of autoimmune disease, however, demonstrate that some self-reactive T cells remain in the periphery. These T cells are described as \"ignorant\" because they do not cause autoimmune disease when encountering self-antigen in vivo unless the self-antigen is presented in an immunostimulatory context (2, 3) . Experimental allergic encephalomyelitis (EAE), 1 an animal model of multiple sclerosis (MS), illustrates this phenomenon. EAE is induced by immunization with central nervous system (CNS) antigens such as myelin basic protein (MBP) in CFA (4) . Recognition of MBP in this context activates naive T cells circulating in the periphery, which then enter the CNS and initiate destruction of myelin (5) . In the absence of experimental intervention, the MBP-specific T cells are not activated and do not induce EAE.",

MBP1-11-specific T cells in the periphery of TCR transgenic mice are primarily naive and proliferate readily to MBP in vitro (11, 14) . EAE can be induced in these mice by administration of pertussis toxin or 872 In Situ Tolerance within the CNS can occur spontaneously in an environment with increased microbial exposure (14) . In the studies reported here, we analyzed the ability of the MBP1-11-specific T cells to traffic to the CNS in the absence of any exogenous stimulation. Surprisingly, comparable numbers of T cells were isolated from the CNS of both MBP-specific TCR transgenic mice and wild-type mice. In contrast to wild-type mice, however, most of the MBP-specific T cells found in the CNS of young mice exhibited a naive phenotype rather than an activated or memory phenotype. Similar observations were made in TCR transgenic models specific for nonself antigens. TCR transgenic models differ significantly from wild-type mice in that TCR transgenic mice have few activated/memory peripheral T cells. These results indicate that, in the absence of activated T cells in the periphery, naive T cells can traffic to the CNS. Despite the trafficking of naive MBP-specific T cells through the CNS, the majority of MBP TCR transgenic mice do not develop autoimmunity. We show that the lack of spontaneous EAE is due in part to suppression of the responses of naive MBP-specific T cells within the target organ. Furthermore, CNS cells from MBP TCR transgenic mice are able to suppress the response of nontolerant peripheral MBP-specific T cells in vitro. These data demonstrate that CNS autoimmune disease is regulated in part by the induction of tolerance to CNS antigens in situ.",

The high incidence of spontaneous EAE in recombinase activating gene (Rag) \u03ea / \u03ea MBP TCR transgenic mice suggests that T cells may be activated by encountering MBP epitopes in vivo. Activation of MBP-specific T cells within the CNS is only possible if some naive T cells gain access to this tissue. To investigate this possibility, we isolated lymphocytes from the brain and spinal cord of clinically healthy, 4-7-wk-old, well perfused, MBP TCR1 transgenic mice on the Rag \u03e9 / \u03e9 background. Lymphocytes from individual animals were analyzed to avoid mixing cells from any mice that had preclinical spontaneous EAE with cells from healthy mice. Surprisingly, the number of T cells per gram of CNS tissue isolated from young, healthy MBP TCR1 transgenic mice was comparable to the number isolated from nontransgenic control mice ( Fig.  1 ). This result was unexpected because entry into the CNS is believed to be limited to activated T cells (7, 9, 10) , and TCR transgenic mice typically have few activated T cells in the periphery (14, 24) .",

The observation that young Rag \u03ea/\u03ea MBP TCR1 transgenic mice have a similar percentage of CD45RB low T cells in the CNS and spleen as nontransgenic mice suggested that interactions with the MBP-specific TCR on these cells promotes the accumulation of T cells with a memory phenotype. Antigenic stimulation could be provided by MBP itself, by a cross-reactive self-antigen, or environmental antigen. In wild-type mice, the percentage of memory T cells increases with age in the peripheral lymphoid compartments, presumably due to an increased number of encounters with environmental antigens (28) . We hypothesized that a similar increase in the number of memory T cells should be observed in MBP TCR1 transgenic mice if T cells in these animals are continuously interacting with antigen. Analyzing T cell populations in the spleen and CNS of MBP TCR1 transgenic mice and nontransgenic mice as a function of age tested this prediction. Rag \u03e9/\u03e9 instead of Rag \u03ea/\u03ea MBP TCR1 transgenic mice were analyzed because older Rag \u03ea/\u03ea MBP TCR transgenic mice exhibit a 100% incidence of spontaneous EAE (12) . In contrast, Rag \u03e9/\u03e9 MBP TCR1 transgenic mice exhibit EAE primarily between 5 to 10 wk of age, but very few cases of EAE are observed in mice \u03fe69 d of age (14) . Older MBP TCR1 transgenic mice (\u03fe69 d) exhibited a significant increase in the percentage of activated/memory cells (CD45RB low , CD44 high ) in both the CNS and the periphery compared with young MBP TCR1 transgenic mice (P \u03ed 0.0006; Fig. 3 and Table I ). Furthermore, the age-dependent decrease in naive T cells was significantly greater in MBP TCR1 transgenic mice than in nontransgenic mice (P \u03ed 0.0003). A similar age-dependent decrease in naive T cells is seen in MBP TCR2 transgenic mice (data not shown).",

First, the absolute number of CNS T cells per gram of tissue in older MBP TCR transgenic mice is significantly greater than the number found in older nontransgenic mice (1.4 \u03eb 10 4 CNS T cells in nontransgenic mice, n \u03ed 11; 6.0 \u03eb 10 4 CNS T cells in MBP TCR1 mice, n \u03ed 10, P \u03ed 0.0007; 7.1 \u03eb 10 4 CNS T cells in MBP TCR2 mice, n \u03ed 3, P \u03ed 0.007). This observation suggests that expression of the MBP TCR results in more antigenic stimulation than the diverse repertoire of TCRs expressed in nontransgenic mice. Second, the absolute number of both total MBP-specific (V \u2423 2 \u03e9 ) T cells and CD45RB low V \u2423 2 \u03e9 T cells increases with age within the CNS in MBP TCR1 transgenic mice, suggesting that the increase in memory T cells does not simply reflect an in-crease in T cells with endogenously rearranged TCR chains (data not shown, P \u03ed 0.00004). These data are in contrast to results from MHC class II-restricted TCR transgenic mice specific for a nonself antigen, pigeon cytochrome C (24) . In this model, there was an increase in peripheral memory T cells as the animals aged; however, this increase was completely in the transgene-negative T cells rather than the transgene-positive T cells. Our data demonstrate that as MBP TCR transgenic mice age, an increasing number of T cells expressing MBP-specific TCRs are activated and converted to a memory phenotype in the absence of spontaneous EAE.",

            "text": "In Situ Tolerance within the CNS CNS of healthy, older transgenic mice than in younger mice was inconsistent with the fact that the incidence of spontaneous EAE is significantly higher in younger rather than older mice. Therefore, we investigated the possibility that, in contrast to activated T cells, naive MBP-specific transgenic T cells entering the CNS undergo tolerance in situ and become unresponsive to MBP. CNS T cells isolated from 14-17 healthy MBP TCR1 transgenic mice were pooled and cultured in vitro with MBP Ac1-11. T cell-depleted splenocytes from wild-type mice were added as APCs. V \u2423 2 \u03e9 T cells isolated from the CNS of MBP TCR1 transgenic mice did not proliferate in response to antigen (Fig. 4, A and B , P \u03ed 0.004). In contrast, V \u2423 2 \u03e9 T cells from LNs of the same animals plated at the same density as the CNS T cells proliferated robustly in response to MBP Ac1-11. CNS T cells isolated from MBP TCR2 transgenic mice also did not proliferate in response to antigen, whereas LN T cells proliferated strongly (Fig. 4 B) . To determine whether the induction of nonresponsiveness in T cells within the CNS was unique to T cells specific for MBP, two different MHC class II-restricted TCR transgenic mouse models specific for non-CNS antigens were analyzed using the same experimental protocol. Both CNS and LN T cells harvested from TEa TCR transgenic mice specific for the MHC class II E\u2423 peptide and DO11.10 TCR transgenic mice specific for ovalbumin proliferated equally when stimulated with E\u2423 peptide and Ova peptide, respectively, in vitro (Fig. 4 B) . Thus, nonresponsiveness of T cells from the CNS was observed only when the T cells were specific for a CNS antigen. Previous studies of tolerance to tissue-specific antigens have implicated draining LNs as the site for induction of T cell tolerance. Therefore, we investigated the possibility that nonresponsiveness may be induced in the MBP-specific T cells by presentation of MBP epitopes in the cervical LNs that are believed to drain the CNS (29, 30) . In the experiments in Fig. 4 B, T cells from multiple peripheral LNs draining different tissues were pooled together such that nonresponsiveness in the cervical LNs might not have been detected. Fig. 4 C compares the proliferative responses to MBP Ac1-11 of V \u2423 2 \u03e9 T cells isolated from the cervical and inguinal LNs of MBP TCR1 transgenic mice. T cells from both types of LNs proliferated strongly to MBP peptide, supporting the idea that induction of tolerance in MBPspecific T cells occurs within the CNS itself.",

CNS T cells isolated from both transgenic models remained nonresponsive to antigen even in the presence of IL-2, whereas LN T cells from the same mice proliferated robustly (data not shown). Therefore, the lack of proliferation observed with MBP-specific T cells from the CNS was not due to an ability to produce IL-2. In all experiments described so far, no more than 21 MBP TCR transgenic mice were pooled per experiment. In one additional experiment, 36 MBP TCR1 TCR transgenic mice were pooled in order to expand the number of wells exposed to IL-2. In this experiment, both CNS and LN T cells proliferated in the presence and absence of IL-2 (data not shown). No proliferation was detected in any of the other experiments using MBP TCR transgenic CNS T cells (n \u03ed 5). Therefore, we suspect that the unusually large number of mice pooled in this experiment included a mouse with subclinical EAE. The incidence of spontaneous EAE in the colony from which these mice were obtained is 15%. T cells in the CNS of mice with subclinical EAE will already be activated and would be expected to proliferate in vitro.",

The transgenic LN T cells proliferated strongly to MBP Ac1-11 in both the presence and absence of CNS mononuclear cells isolated from nontransgenic mice (Fig. 5) . These results confirm our observations made with the TEa and DO11.10 TCR transgenic mice that CNS mononuclear cells do not generally suppress T cell proliferation. Interestingly, CNS cells isolated from MBP TCR transgenic mice had a very different effect in these experiments. Proliferation of MBPspecific LN T cells was significantly inhibited upon incubation with CNS cells isolated from MBP TCR transgenic mice compared with incubation with peptide and irradiated APCs alone (Fig. 5, P \u03ed 0.004) . These data are the results of four independent experiments using CNS cells from MBP TCR transgenic mice.

Previous work indicated that immunological privilege was the result of the specialized structure of the blood-brain barrier that limited T cell trafficking to activated T cells (7, 9, 10) . Our data support the notion that T cells found in the CNS of wild-type mice are predominantly activated/memory T cells. However, recent experiments in sheep demonstrated that naive lymphocytes infused directly into the blood could circulate through the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF [31] ). Our experiments suggest a basis for reconciling these apparently conflicting findings. We show that the same number of T cells are found in the CNS of nontransgenic, TCR transgenic, and even Rag \u03ea/\u03ea TCR transgenic mice that have very few activated T cells in the periphery. Thus, a similar number of T cells traffic through the CNS of healthy animals regardless of the number of activated T cells present in the periphery. The CNS of nontransgenic mice is enriched in activated/memory T cells, suggesting that activated T cells have a competitive advantage over naive T cells in crossing the blood-brain barrier. However, as the number of activated T cells in the periphery decreases, more naive T cells are able to enter the CNS. This is most clearly illustrated in Rag \u03ea/\u03ea TCR transgenic mice in which there are very few activated T cells in the periphery and the vast majority of T cells in the CNS exhibit a naive phenotype.",

Although the degree of trafficking through the CNS by naive T cells is greater in Rag \u03ea/\u03ea TCR transgenic mice than in nontransgenic mice, some trafficking of the CNS by naive T cells occurs continuously in nontransgenic animals. We demonstrate that initiation of autoimmunity by these naive T cells in the CNS is specifically prevented by the induction of tolerance in situ. Naive MBP-specific T cells isolated from the CNS are unresponsive to antigen while MBP-specific T cells from the periphery of the same animals are fully functional in response to antigen stimulation. Induction of tolerance is unique to MBP-specific T cells present in the CNS, as CNS T cells isolated from TCR transgenic mice specific for non-CNS antigens are not tolerized and proliferate robustly in response to antigen in vitro.",

First, we confirmed that our CNS T cell isolation procedures from MBP TCR transgenic mice produced T cells that were present behind the blood-brain barrier in vivo without significant contamination of peripheral T cells (see Materials and Methods). Second, we examined T cells isolated from cervical LNs for evidence of tolerance because these LNs are believed to drain the CNS (29, 30) . ",

Exposure of naive T cells to antigens within parenchymal tissues has been suggested as a basis for some forms of neonatal tolerance. T cell trafficking through extra-lymphoid tissues is thought to occur more extensively in neonates than in adult mice. However, in at least one example the tolerance induced in neonates by increased trafficking of peripheral tissues was systemic tolerance and did not result in the presence of tolerant T cells exclusively in the relevant tissue (39) . In contrast to these findings, we demonstrate that the tolerance to MBP within the CNS is tissue-specific rather than systemic.",

Inhibition of proliferation of CNS MBP-specific T cells is not mediated by inhibitory factors found in the CSF or brain during inflammation that appear to modulate T cell activity (40, 41) . These factors operate within the microenvironment of the inflamed CNS and would not be present in our in vitro cultures. In addition, naive CD4 \u03e9 T cells specific for non-CNS antigens proliferate equally well when they are isolated from either the CNS or LNs, and it is only T cells from MBP TCR transgenic mice that are nonresponsive. Our data suggest instead that the interaction of naive MBPspecific T cells with antigen in the CNS results in an irreversible state of nonresponsiveness that is maintained even in the absence of soluble factors found in CNS microenvironments during inflammation. The nonresponsiveness induced in MBP-specific T cells in situ was not reversed by addition of exogenous IL-2 in vitro; however, in vivo induction of T cell anergy is not necessarily overcome by addition of exogenous IL-2 (42) (43) (44) (45) (46) . Influenza hemagglutinin-specific TCR transgenic T cells that have been anergized in vivo have been shown to contain high levels of IL-4 and IL-10 mRNA, suggesting that the anergic T cells may function as regulatory T cells (46) . This phenomenon could explain our finding that mononuclear cells isolated from the CNS of MBP TCR transgenic mice are capable of suppressing the proliferation of nontolerant peripheral MBP-specific T cells in vitro. Investigation is underway to determine which cell types mediate the suppression and whether this bystander suppression is mediated by soluble factors and/or is cell contact dependent.",

Interestingly, our studies show that at the age when the incidence of spontaneous EAE in MBP TCR1 transgenic mice declines, the number of MBP-specific T cells in the CNS of these mice doubles and their phenotype converts to that of an activated/memory T cell. This increase in activated/memory T cells is due in part to expression of the MBP-specific TCR because the number of memory T cells is greater in the CNS of older TCR transgenic mice than in the CNS of age-matched nontransgenic mice, and much of this increase in MBP TCR transgenic mice can be accounted for by an increase in MBPspecific (V \u2423 2 \u03e9 ) memory cells. Thus, although T cells in older MBP TCR transgenic mice appear to have encountered antigen more frequently than T cells in older nontransgenic mice, this encounter is not correlated with initiation of disease. Spontaneous EAE may be prevented in older MBP TCR transgenic mice by the development of nontransgenic CD4 \u03e9 regulatory T cells that have been shown to be critical in prevention of spontaneous EAE (12, 47, 48) . These regulatory T cells must not function by decreasing exposure of MBP-specific T cells to antigen since memory MBP-specific T cells accumulate in older MBP TCR transgenic mice, but rather the regulatory T cells must change the outcome of this interaction.",

These T cells are prevented from initiating CNS autoimmune disease by in situ tolerance when they encounter antigen within the CNS. The spontaneous autoimmune disease that occurs in some mice may be caused by a failure of tolerance at several levels. Peripheral events could activate MBP-specific T cells either by immunization, as is the common mechanism for the induction of EAE, or via molecular mimicry mediated by an infectious agent (49) (50) (51) (52) (53) . Once activated, the MBP-specific T cells are no longer susceptible to tolerance in situ and can initiate autoimmune disease. Alternatively, autoimmunity could develop because tolerance occurring within the CNS is circumvented. Potential mechanisms for overcoming tolerance in the CNS include an infection that may increase costimulation and MHC expression in situ, genetic defects in the tolerance mechanisms, or peripheral infections that may influence antigen presentation within the CNS through the release of soluble factors. These experiments reveal a new form of immunoregulation of CNS-specific T cells that must be considered in the study of the pathogenesis of CNS autoimmunity.",
