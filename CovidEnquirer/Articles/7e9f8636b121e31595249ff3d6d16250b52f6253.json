We briefly review important advances in molecular microbiology, and then discuss specific assays that have been implemented in clinical microbiology laboratories throughout the country. We also discuss emerging methods and technologies that will soon be more widely used for the prompt and accurate detection of the agents of infectious diseases. Semin Hematol 46:248 -258 \u00a9 2009 Elsevier Inc. All rights reserved. C linical microbiology has entered a new era of diagnostic testing, in which molecular tests have transcended the confines of the basic science research laboratory and become important tools in the clinical laboratory. Traditional and cumbersome polymerase chain reaction (PCR) methods have given way to simpler, faster, and less costly techniques that can be used by smaller clinical laboratories that lack extensive training in molecular methods. The past decade has seen a surge in the development of various molecular diagnostics to rapidly identify or characterize infectious microorganisms, with each test designed to improve sensitivity, specificity, and/or turnaround times of conventional methods. A significant proportion of the recent developments described below are molecular tests. For this reason, a brief overview of molecular microbiology is provided, followed by a discussion of the most important advances in diagnostic testing that have been employed by key clinical microbiology laboratories throughout the country.",

Some of the first molecular assays to be commonly used in clinical microbiology laboratories consisted of oligonucleotide acid probes used for the direct detection of bacteria, mycobacteria, and fungi. 1 In situ hybridization is another type of signal amplification reaction that uses the human eye as the complex detection device. When a fluorophore-labeled oligonucleotide probe is used to hybridize to its target sequence and the fluorescent signal is observed using a fluorescent microscope, the procedure is fluorescent in situ hybridization (FISH) . Although in situ hybridization techniques have been used for many years in anatomic pathology and research laboratories, they are relatively new to the clinical microbiology laboratory.",

Most of them use PCR as the base chemistry, but other forms of nucleic acid amplification are also available in a rapid cycle or \"real-time\" format. Traditional PCR, which in the distant past took days to accomplish, has often been supplanted by faster and more user-friendly rapid cycle or real-time PCR methods. These assays are performed in a closed system, in which both amplification and detection occur within the same reaction vessel. Opening of the vessel and further manipulation of the amplicon are unnecessary, which greatly minimizes the risk of amplicon contamination of the laboratory and significantly diminishes the possibility of subsequent false positive amplification results. Although many of these are laboratory-designed and verified assays, several have been submitted and approved by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA), and many more are under development or in clinical trials.",

            "text": "Monoplex PCR refers to the detection of a single target sequence, and this method is most commonly used in a qualitative manner, wherein the expected result is the presence or absence of a microorganism in a clinical specimen. For example, one may use this type of approach for the detection of Mycobacterium tuberculosis, Legionella pneumophila, or Pneumocystis jiroveci from respiratory specimens. [2] [3] [4] The technique is most advantageous for the rapid diagnosis of serious infections with microorganisms that are slow-growing, fastidious, or that cannot be cultivated in the routine laboratory. When multiple organisms cause similar or identical clinical manifestations, or an internal amplification control is desired, then a multiplex PCR reaction is needed (that is, two or more nucleic acid amplifications are performed in one assay). Multiplex assays that address the most likely causes of a particular disease (for example, community-acquired pneumonia or diarrhea) would be the most helpful and cost-effective way to diagnose the responsible pathogen in many instances. Multiplex assays have recently been developed for the viruses that cause meningitis, and two FDAapproved assays are available for the rapid detection of common respiratory viruses. 5, 6 Post-amplification analysis represents the third category in which there has been, and we predict will continue to be, advances in diagnostic molecular microbiology. Post-amplification analysis consists of a variety of methods that involve additional amplicon processing or analysis, in order to obtain more information than is available from the amplification reaction alone. Post-amplification analysis allows more accurate identification or characterization of a microorganism, often to the species level. Methods include melt curve analysis, reverse hybridization, DNA sequencing, and microarray analysis. Melt curve analysis consists of differentiating amplified DNA products after real-time PCR based on the probe dissociation characteristics. In brief, amplicons from a PCR reaction that are detected as fluorescently labeled oligonucleotide probes that are not consumed by the reaction (such as FRET or Eclipse probes) may yield additional information based on melt curve analysis. Oligonucleotide probes that hybridize to their target sequence with 100% complementarity will have a particular dissociation or melt curve that may be analyzed by heating the reaction mixture while monitoring fluorescence. If any nucleotide polymorphisms exist at the probe hybridization site, then the melt curve will be shifted. There have been amplification assays and probes designed that will afford microorganism differentiation through post-amplification melt curve analysis. This type of analysis has been used to detect and differentiate M tuberculosis from nontuberculous mycobacteria (Figure 1 ), and to distinguish the subtypes of herpes simplex virus (HSV). Whiley et al described an assay that detected both the BK and JC polyomaviruses but differentiated them from one another based on the unique melt curves generated. 7 Post-amplification melt curve analysis may also be accomplished using nonspecific DNA binders like SYBR green, or more recently with newer modifications of these chemistries that afford high-resolution melt curve analysis without the need for an oligonucleotide probe.",

            "text": "Reverse hybridization is a simple-to-perform method for detecting a variety of pathogens following either a multiplex or a broad-range amplification reaction. In brief, the amplicon is labeled and then applied to a nitrocellulose membrane strip that contains the probes for the microorganisms of interest; the amplicon will hybridize to the location on the nitrocellulose strip of the complementary probe. Thereafter, a chemical reaction demonstrates the location of the amplicon, and the identification of the microorganism of interest is thereby obtained. This technology has been used to detect common and unusual mycobacteria, human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotypes, and more frequent causes of fungal infections. [8] [9] [10] [11] DNA sequencing likewise has important uses in diagnostic microbiology, including identification and characterization of organisms to the species, as well as strain level differentiation (eg, multilocus sequence typing [MLST]); it may also be used to detect resistanceassociated mutations from bacteria, fungi, and viruses. This method of post-amplification analysis consists of determining the nucleic acid sequence of the amplicon, usually through either Sanger or pyrosequencing ( Figure 2 ). Once a sequence of an unidentified microorganism is determined, it is queried against a genetic database to find a match. DNA sequencing is becoming, if it is not already recognized as such, the method of choice for identifying Mycobacterium sp., Nocardia, and other aerobic actinomycetes. 12, 13 Microarray technology, which has been used for discovery by researchers for many years, has come to the clinical laboratory. Research tools, which have the capability to detect thousands of reactions simultaneously, have been pared down to address complex diagnostic problems that usually have one of numerous possible answers. These have been used to differentiate numerous microbial pathogens within a group, as well as to identify a large variety of genetic determinants of drug resistance. FDA-approved microarray-based assays are currently available for the genetic characterization of patients with cystic fibrosis, and for the detection and differentiation of respiratory viruses, discussed in more detail below.",

            "text": "The cell cytotoxicity assay is presently considered the standard for Clostridium difficile testing. 21 However, rapid enzyme immunoassay (EIA) testing has been used more commonly in clinical laboratories, due to its faster turnaround time and ease-of-use. The EIA tests vary widely in sensitivity (50%-99%) and specificity (70%-100%), depending on the study and the reference standard. 22 Ticehurst et al showed the sensitivity of one EIA to be as low as 36% when they compared this test to the two-step diagnostic algorithm for Clostridium difficile-associated disease (CDAD) consisting of a screening glutamate dehydrogenase (GDH) by solidphase EIA (C diff Check-60; Techlab, Blacksburg, VA), followed by a confirmatory cell culture cytotoxicity neutralization assay (CCNA) for those specimens that test positive with the GDH assay. Sensitivity for screening GDH EIA was 96% with a negative predictive value of \u03fe99%. This approach rapidly screened out the negative specimens (75%-80% of samples); confirmatory testing was then performed on the remaining 20% by CCNA. Negative results could be reported on the same day, whereas the GDH-positive specimens had to be incubated for another 2 days before CCNA results could be finalized. 23 Gilligan also found a low sensitivity of 59.5% for the Premier (Meridian Biosciences, Cincinnati, OH) toxin A and B EIA compared to the two-step diagnostic algorithm. The use of the screening GDH followed by CCNA enhanced the detection of C difficile-positive specimens by 40% in this study. 24 Although the GDH EIA test is easy to perform and gives rapid results, the CCNA portion of the assay is labor-intensive, requiring both filtration and centrifugation steps, and takes 18 to 48 hours of incubation before results can be finalized. Several laboratory-validated real-time PCR assays have subsequently been developed that demonstrate superior sensitivity compared to EIA; these also have a fast turnaround time and are easy to use. [25] [26] [27] In a prospective multicenter study, EIA, an enzyme-linked fluorescent assay, a laboratoryverified real time-PCR assay targeting the tcdB gene, and CCNA were compared; PCR had the highest concordance with CCNA (the reference standard) at 71.4% and was recommended as the preferred method for diagnosing CDAD. 25 In another study, Peterson and colleagues, using clinical criteria as part of their reference standard, demonstrated that a real-time PCR was significantly more sensitive than EIA (sensitivity 73.3%) with sensitivity, specificity, PPV, and NPV of 93.3%, 97.4% 75.7%, and 99.4%, respectively. 22 Most recently, the FDA has approved a real-time PCR assay for CDAD detection, the BD GeneOhm Cdiff Assay (BD GeneOhm, San Diego, CA), which amplifies a highly conserved region of the tcdB gene. This assay was compared to CCNA (Wampole C difficile Toxin B Test [TOX-B]; Techlab) and to toxigenic culture. 28 The overall agreement was high (94.8%) between the PCR assay and CCNA. Sensitivity and specificity of the BD assay were 83.6% and 98.2%, respectively, compared to toxigenic culture. Real time-PCR proved to be more sensitive than CCNA, which had 67.2% sensitivity and 99.1% specificity in detecting C difficile from fecal specimens. We believe these new testing algorithms and new approaches to C difficile testing represent significant advances in clinical microbiology. In the future, clinicians will likely be offered tests that will more reliably help them to confirm or exclude enteritis caused by C difficile.",

CHROMagar MRSA (CHROMagar Microbiology, Paris, France; BD Diagnostics, Erembodegem, Belgium) also contains cefoxitin but has a different chromogenic reaction that yields rose to mauve MRSA colonies. The sensitivities of these assays vary somewhat between media and incubation, but the specificities are uniformly high for 24 hours of incubation. 16 34 The bacteria that caused false positives on the MRSA ID included Enterobacter sp. and coagulase-negative staphylococci (CoNS), whereas on CHROMagar MRSA they were streptococci, CoNS, and Corynebacterium spp. In general, an extended incubation for these chromogenic media results in increased sensitivity but decreased specificity at \u03fe24 hours for MRSA detection. Hence, some authors recommend additional confirmatory testing in the form of Gram stain and latex agglutination tests to improve specificities, especially if incubation times \u03fe24 hours are used. 16, 34 It is also important to note that if this chromogenic media alone is used for MRSA screening, as many as 18% of the MRSA-colonized patients may be missed compared to real-time PCR. 35 Chromogenic media are relatively new methods that afford the rapid detection of select isolates in a culturebased format. It suffers from many of the limitations of culture and may not be as sensitive as nucleic acid amplification, but the assay also has many of the benefits of culture (for example, the organisms are available for subsequent testing, such as susceptibility testing or typing).

There are several commercially available PNA FISH assays for use on blood culture bottles that signal positive and have a particular organism morphotype present. Test results are obtained within approximately 2.5 hours.

[39] [40] [41] One of the most popular assays available tests for S aureus when gram-positive cocci in clusters are present in the blood cultures. A positive appears as multiple clusters of brightly fluorescent green cocci, signifying the presence of S aureus. Non-S aureus cocci in clusters are nonfluorescent. The sensitivity and specificity of this assay compared to culture were found to be 100% and 99.2%, respectively. 42 A newer version contains probes for both S aureus and coagulase-negative staphylococci, wherein the S aureus is fluorescent green and the CoNS is red.
