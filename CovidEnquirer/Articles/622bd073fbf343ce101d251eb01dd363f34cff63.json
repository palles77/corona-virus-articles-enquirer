            "text": "Ventilation system with air recirculation is designed to conserve energy, yet at the same time may result in transporting hazardous substance among different rooms in the same building, which is a concern in indoor air quality control. There is a lack of effective methods to predict indoor contaminant distribution primarily because of uncertainty of the contaminant concentration in supply air which in turn due to the mixing ratio of fresh and recirculation air. In this paper, a versatile numerical method to determine the pollutant distribution of ventilation system with recirculation at steady state is proposed based on typical ventilation systems with accessibility of supply air (ASA) and accessibility of contaminant source (ACS). The relationship is established between contaminant concentrations of supply air and return air in a ventilated room or zone. The concentrations of supply air and contaminant distribution in each room can be determined using such parameters as ASA and ACS. The proposed method is validated by both experimental data and numerical simulation result. The computing speed of the proposed method is compared with the iteration method. The comparisons between the proposed method and the lumped parameter model are also conducted. The advantages of the proposed method in terms of accuracy, speed and versatility make it advantageous to be applied in air quality control of complex ventilation systems with recirculation.",

Contaminant distributions in typical buildings, such as the building with fan-coil units, fresh air system and recirculation air were investigated by Li et al. [16] and Yang et al. [17] . There is a lack of a versatile method to determine the contaminant distribution in generic buildings with recirculation air. Hiyama et al.

GAHU is an air handling unit in which return air is handled with or without fresh air mixing. Openings between adjacent spaces such as doors and windows exist in actual buildings to allow the air from one airspace to another. The interacting air flow inevitably transports the contaminant from one airspace to the adjacent airspace. In this case, the interacting air flow between airspaces can be treated as a virtual AHU, as shown in Fig. 2 . In this virtual AHU, the interacting air is treated as 'return air' for one airspace and the same air is treated as 'supply air' for the adjacent airspace. No fresh air exists in the virtual AHU. Essentially, the interacting air flow has the same feature as the ventilation system with air recirculation, so it can also be included into the generic ventilation system.",

The air flow rates supplied and returned by GAHU, direct fresh air flow rates and direct exhaust air flow rates are also defined. The contaminant concentration is known for direct fresh air, but is unknown for supply air of GAHU because of utilization of return air. The contaminant concentrations of direct exhaust air and return air of GAHU are unknown because the contaminant distribution is non-uniform and cannot be obtained simply by mass balance. If the concentrations of supply air from GAHUs are known, the contaminant distribution in the room can be calculated using appropriate CFD tools. Yang et al.

No matter how complex a ventilation system with air recirculation may be, the calculation method will attribute to the two factors. Therefore, the validation of the proposed method is in nature the validations of the concentration expression in the room and the mass balance relationship in AHU. Obviously, the mass balance must be satisfied, while the expression of concentration at an arbitrary point in the room was also well validated by Yang [20] . Therefore, the reliability of these two expressions should make the proposed method reliable.",

While the iteration method will need 101 min CPU time and 12 simulations (Table 8 ). Fig. 7 shows the computing time consumption change with case number. As the case number increases (e.g. changes of emission rate of contaminant source, concentration of direct fresh air or the ratio of fresh air), the proposed method will still only need 5 simulations to obtain the accessibility indices and consume the same 48 minutes. The following calculation of sup- ply air concentration and final concentration distribution (by Eqs. (19) and (11)) will hardly need time. But for the iteration method, the computing time will increase in proportion with the increase of case number, because it is necessary to do the CFD simulations repeatedly when boundary condition changes. Since it is inevitable to do a large number of case simulations when contaminant dispersion features are studied in a complex building, the proposed method can be much more efficient than the iteration method.

After obtaining the supply air concentrations of all GAHUs, all the boundary conditions are known for each room, so the final contaminant distributions of all the rooms can be simulated. However, the real indoor environment is not fully mixed and the real concentration of return air or exhaust air is different from the average concentration in the room, which may result in discrepancy between the calculated supply air concentration and the real value and further influence the finally simulated results.

The obtained supply air concentrations are 9.9713 and 5.8868 mg/kg, respectively. The final contaminant distributions from both methods are illustrated in Figs. 9 and 10. It can be seen that the contaminant distribution by the lumped parameter model is different from that by the proposed method, especially the distributions in Room 1 and Room 3. In Room 1 both two sources are located in the right area, so they have relatively smaller influence on the left area. In this situation, the effect of supply air concentrations on the concentration distribution of the left area is dominant. While in Room 3, no contaminant source exists and the only pollution factor is the supply air concentration. Therefore, different results in Room 1 and Room 3 show the difference of calculated supply air concentrations between proposed method and lumped parameter model.",

A primary reason for the large discrepancy is that the lumped parameter method supposes the concentrations in all return air outlets in one room are the same, but real return air concentrations are different because of the non-uniform feature in the room. The deviation in the assumption of return air concentration from the real situation will cause different calculated supply air concentrations, and further result in large discrepancy between the proposed method and lumped parameter model. Therefore, it is suggested that lumped parameter model be not employed unless the users are sure that the discrepancy between lumped parameter model and proposed method is small enough.",

The second part is the accuracy of the CFD method with respect to the real case. Since the crucial indices such as ASA and ACS in the proposed method are calculated using the CFD method, the accuracy of CFD simulation will influence the accuracy of the proposed method. The accuracy of CFD method is influenced by the simplification degree of each kind of boundary condition and the accuracy of the adopted turbulence model, which are the problems to solve for the CFD method itself.

With the mass balance of contaminant in each GAHU, there are M constraint equations for M supply air concentrations of GAHUs.

The lumped parameter model does not take the information of the source location and flow pattern into account, so it may cause large discrepancy with the real values.
