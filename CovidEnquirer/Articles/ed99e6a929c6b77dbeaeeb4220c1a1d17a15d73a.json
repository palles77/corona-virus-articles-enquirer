            "text": "Upper respiratory tract infections are a common cause of morbidity, general discomfort, and missed days of work. Symptoms are more frequently encountered during the winter \"flu season.\" More than 200 different viruses can cause common colds in adults, including rhinovirus (the most frequent cause), coronavirus, adenoviruses, respiratory syncytial virus, and parainfluenza viruses. 1 In the United States, on average, adults develop 2 to 4 colds and children 6 to 8 colds each year. 2 Herbal preparations of the leaves and root of the plant Echinacea purpurea increase phagocytic cells in the spleen and bone marrow, acting as phytoimmune modulators or immune system enhancers. [3] [4] [5] In vitro studies support claims of immune modulation and indicate that this effect may be mediated by a modification of the activity of polymorphonuclear neutrophil granulocytes and macrophages. 6 -9 Echinacea-containing preparations are extensively used for the treatment and prevention of infections and, apart from allergic reactions and an increased incidence of rash, are reported to be generally safe. 10 -14 Clinical trials 14 -25 testing the ability of echinacea to prevent colds and ameliorate symptoms have had mixed results. A Cochrane Review 26 found that most available studies reported benefits from echinacea use, but variations in the preparations of echinacea used and methodological quality limited the conclusions. A recent meta-analysis 27 found that standardized echinacea extracts were effective in the prevention of symptoms of the common cold after clinical inoculation. Methodological shortcomings in studies of herbal medicines, including echinacea, have been noted by other researchers as well. 28 A meta-analysis 10 of studies published since 1997 suggested that echinacea was more effective at treating colds than at preventing them.",

These differences suggest that the dropouts are people who are less afflicted with respiratory symptoms and less preoccupied with prevention. One might speculate that the burden of adherence to the protocol was excessive for this group. Dropouts and nonadherent participants were evenly distributed between the control and intervention groups.",

Outcomes were not collected from those who dropped out, precluding an intention-to-treat analysis. However, the equal number of dropouts in both arms, coupled with the finding of no effect on symptom days in those taking echinacea, suggests that an intention-to-treat analysis would likely not have changed the conclusions.",

Al-though none are suspected, if parsley has effects on respiratory symptoms, we could expect that findings might be different for the use of a truly inert placebo.
