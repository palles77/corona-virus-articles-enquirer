            "text": "The relative motion of moving objects is an essential research topic in geographical information science (GIScience), which supports the innovation of geodatabases, spatial indexing, and geospatial services. This analysis is very popular in the domains of urban governance, transportation engineering, logistics and geospatial information services for individuals or industrials. Importantly, data models of moving objects are one of the most crucial approaches to support the analysis for dynamic relative motion between moving objects, even in the age of big data and cloud computing. Traditional geographic information systems (GIS) usually organize moving objects as point objects in absolute coordinated space. The derivation of relative motions among moving objects is not efficient because of the additional geo-computation of transformation between absolute space and relative space. Therefore, current GISs require an innovative approach to directly store, analyze and interpret the relative relationships of moving objects to support their efficient analysis. This paper proposes a relative space-based GIS data model of moving objects (RSMO) to construct, operate and analyze moving objects' relationships and introduces two algorithms (relationship querying and relative relationship dynamic pattern matching) to derive and analyze the dynamic relationships of moving objects. Three scenarios (epidemic spreading, tracker finding, and motion-trend derivation of nearby crowds) are implemented to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model. The experimental results indicates the execution times of the proposed model are approximately 5-50% those of the absolute GIS method for the same function of these three scenarios. It's better computational performance of the proposed model when analyzing the relative relationships of moving objects than the absolute methods in a famous commercial GIS software based on this experimental results. The proposed approach fills the gap of traditional GIS and shows promise for relative space-based geo-computation, analysis and service.",

In absolute space, geocoded locations are bound to previously existing geometry and topology relationships among the corresponding points in the space (Meentemeyer, 1989; Couclelis, 1999) . Therefore, moving objects are always represented as a series of observations that consist of an id, location and time (Hornsby and Egenhofer, 2002; Spaccapietra et al., 2008) , alongside additional information such as activities (Wang and Cheng, 2001; Shaw and Yu, 2009 ) and semantics Vandecasteele et al., 2014) .

            "text": "Moving objects are a very popular representation requirement in current GIS applications because of the large volume of their tracked trajectories, e.g., cars in cities, vessels at sea, and even people around the world. Therefore, many research projects have been conducted to store, manage and query moving-object data in the communities of computer science and geographical information science. In computer science, several data structures have been defined to support the storage and querying of moving objects. The first structure is the storage unit in DBMSs (database management systems). G\u00fcting and his group abstracted moving objects into moving points and moving regions and developed a discrete model in a DBMS to store, manage and query moving objects' data (Forlizzi et al., 2000; G\u00fcting et al., 2000 G\u00fcting et al., , 2004 G\u00fcting and Schneider, 2005) . Based on abstracted data types, moving objects could be managed and queried by using SQL. These works provided a solid foundation to support research on moving objects. The second is tree structures. Moving objects were usually abstracted as points (Ranu et al., 2015) , single continuous polynomials (Ni and Ravishankar, 2007) , or non-regulated sequences of roads in transportation networks (Sandu Popa et al., 2011) . Then, these objects were indexed by the tree's derivatives, for example, B + -trees (Sandu Popa et al., 2011) , R-trees (Yue et al., 2018) , 3D R-trees (Xu et al., 2018) , FN (fixed network) R-trees , PA-trees (Ni and Ravishankar, 2007) , and grid trees (Yan et al., 2015) . These tree-based indices could facilitate efficient queries on moving objects. The third structure is moving object-oriented databases. To satisfy the demand of faster processing with big data, PostgreeSQL , Mon-goDB , MonetDB (Boncz et al., 2005) , and Cassandra (Hospital et al., 2015) were developed to store and analyze large volumes of moving objects' information.",

            "text": "In the community of geographical information science, traditional GIS data models, such as field-based models (e.g., raster-based models) (Cova and Goodchild, 2002) and feature models (e.g., object-and vector-based models) (Tang et al., 1996) , usually depended on absolute coordinates in their reference frames to describe spatial object's motion or relationships. These models were often used to represent some key concepts that were related to moving objects, i.e., the place, activity and semantics. The concept of \"place\" was used to indicate the location of activity, which usually complied with a certain upper-bound distance and lower-bound duration (Kang et al., 2004) . Human daily activities were always represented as a sequence of place visits (Do and Gatica-Perez, 2014) . Additionally, space time path was a key concept in classical time geography framework that was used to represent and analyze activities and interactions in a hybrid physical-virtual space (Shaw and Yu, 2009 ) and social space (Yin and Shaw, 2015) . Several basic semantics of moving objects were derived from the trajectories of moving objects, for example, episodes, stops, and moves (Ilarri et al., 2015) . Based on these basic semantics, researchers (Parent et al., 2013; Bogorny et al., 2014; Jiang et al., 2015; Wan et al., 2018) built semantic trajectories from semantic point sequences. Semantic trajectories were easy for urban planners and migration or transportation agencies to use to mine spatial-temporal mobility patterns.",

            "text": "Moving object-oriented operators (i.e., range queries, nearestneighbor queries) were derived to support the analysis of moving objects' relationships. The first common operator is range queries, which specify a value of moving objects to fall within a lower and upper boundary Zhan et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2018; Yue et al., 2018) , e.g., finding all the objects of a specific traveler between 7 am and 9 am. Filtering and refining are two important steps of range queries. Filtering determines candidate locations (such as a node in a tree structure) that contain specified attribute values and overlap the query area in space and time, while refining retrieves well-matched objects under the querying conditions through some advanced filtering techniques, such as statistics-based approaches (Zhan et al., 2015) and time-based partitioning techniques (Yue et al., 2018) . The second common operation is nearest-neighbor (NN) queries, which find the nearest neighbors to a given object in a database for a specific time interval. Two similar phases of NN queries include searching for candidate units based on the idea of node pruning with large coverage and determining the well-matched results according to various conditions, such as time limits (G\u00fcting et al., 2010) , obstacles (Gao et al., 2011) , spatial-network structures (Cheema et al., 2012) , reverse nearest neighbors (Cheema et al., 2012) and movement uncertainties (Niedermayer et al., 2013) . These operators are usually applied by calculating the distance between the coordinates of moving objects to derive relative metrics such as the distance, direction and time. This situation could produce repeated computations and misrepresent the relative relationships of moving objects without a geocoding technique.",

An STC is a three-dimensional cube that includes space-time bins in the x and y dimensions and time in the t dimension and represents limited space coverage over a fixed period. The basic idea of RSMO is to directly record moving objects' relationships and relative dynamics with a three-dimensional space-time cube to facilitate transfer to absolute space by maintaining the current locations of moving objects via additional space-time bins. This data model reduces the calculation of moving objects' relationships and relative dynamics in traditional GIS data models to provide efficient relative space-based queries between moving objects for real applications with cars, vessels, people, etc. RSMO is designed to support some basic functions such as moving objects' motion storage and organization, queries based on relative relationships, relative motion-pattern analysis and mining, and transformation between absolute space and relative space. The following section will first introduce RSMO and then the basic functions that depend on RSMO.",

Here, the motion in the STC is represented by the relationships of moving objects, which is a natural approach to represent the actual cognitive processes of moving objects in an environment. Fig. 2 illustrates the extended-entity-relationship (EER) diagram of the RSMO model, which shows the elements (entities, relationships and attributes) and the hierarchical relationships among these elements. This model defines six basic entity types, i.e., \"Object\", \"Relative Location\", \"Relationship\", \"Relative Relationship Bin\", \"Relative Relationship Matrix\" and \"Relative Relationship Cube\". Here, Object represents the moving object in a real scenario, such as the people in Fig. 2 , vehicles/ unmanned ground vehicles, unmanned aerial vehicles, vessels, planes, and so on. Relative Location is the position of any Object relative to other Object (Fig. 2) , which can be represented by the relative distance and angle. Relationship indicates the mutual spatial or social relationships among Objects, for example, closeness, friendship, colleague does not require much additional computation to build relationships among objects from the coordinates in traditional STCs and provides a natural approach to analyze a moving object's behavior. Fig. 3 provides an example of RSMO's organization. Fig. 3 (a) illustrates the spatial trajectories of five moving objects (Objects labelled as A, B, C, D and E). Fig. 3 (b) illustrates a right-handed coordinate system for detecting objects' Relative Location from each object's view. Fig. 3 (c) shows a geometric transformation method from Relative Locations to ) of moving objects are organized akin to x and y coordinates. In this matrix, rows represent \"Reference\" objects and columns represent their detected \"Target\" objects. Fig. 3 (e) shows a Relative Relationship Cube that includes all Relative Relationship Matrices sorted by Time. The proposed model replaces the orthogonal coordinate axes (X, Y) in the STC with two object axes that represent reference and target objects to store their relationships.",

The main idea of this algorithm are to organize the relative relationship as three dimensions, namely, Reference object, Target object and Time, which is based on model's structure, and then to index relative relationship by corresponding objects and time. By using a composite index consisting of Reference object, Target object and Time, this algorithm can quickly find out the relative relationship completely covered by the given restricted objects and time. In the query, this algorithm retrieves relationships by accessing the relative relationship according to the corresponding composite index of given object and time, instead of extracting each relative relationship bins of reference or target object one by one in the cube. Therefore, this algorithm can be integrated with all the operators shown in Section 3.2.1 and constrained by six parameters, namely, Cube, Query_type, C_ref, C_ tar, C_T, and rel, which are explained in Algorithm 1. Cube is a structure of map, whose key consists of a reference and target object, while value is also a map whose key is the time and value is the relationship. The detail of the Query processing algorithm is described in Algorithm 1. When comparing this algorithm with traditional GIS querying in absolute space, this algorithm can avoid many redundant computational address coordinates, which can improve the efficiency of the relative relationship querying. We will test this approach in Section 5.5.",

Dynamic pattern is represented as a space-time trajectory (Bao et al., 2017) , which is consist of specific locations in absolute space (shown in Fig. 7) . Given a specific pattern (Pattern_S), each object's distance to the Pattern_S needs to be calculated to measure its similarity to Pattern_S. Finally, the trajectory, whose distances are all in matching threshold (in Fig. 7) , would be got as the outcome of Pattern matching in absolute space. In relative space, dynamic pattern is represented as a relative relationship bin series, which is composed of bin with specific relative distance. In this algorithm, the bins with each object's relative distance to Pattern_S can be directly got by reference cutting at first. Then, they are labeled according to whether their relative distance is in matching threshold. Finally, the relative relationship bin series are obtained, which match the Pattern_S in all time. This algorithm provides a more efficient way for relative relationship dynamic pattern matching. It simplifies the spatial computation to measure the similarity on basis of reference cutting and labeling in the proposed model.

Thus, tracing the back-propagation path of a virus and finding close contacts are meaningful to prevent the spread of diseases. This experiment assumed a severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) carrier's walking path to find its close contacts. SARS is a viral respiratory disease of zoonotic origin that is caused by the SARS coronavirus (SARS-CoV). The primary route of transmission for SARS is the contact of mucous membranes with respiratory droplets or fomites (World Health Organization, 2003) . The research about respiratory droplets transmission shows that the largest droplets will totally evaporate before falling 2 m away (Xie et al., 2007) . Therefore, a person will be identified as a close contact if the distance to the carrier (whose ID is 2 in Fig. 9 ) is less than 2 m. Therefore, this paper uses 2 m as the parameter for querying close contacts.",

To remain unnoticed, trackers usually stay within a certain range from the target to neither be found nor lose the target. This distance range is a critical parameter to build specific patterns for trackers. According to the sociological theory (Moore et al., 2010) , trackers are easily found if their distance to the victim is less than 3 m. Therefore, this study set the parameter of 3 m as the lower distance limit for this query. On the other hand, the upper distance limit must guarantee that the target is within the tracker's sight. This study set the upper distance limit as 42 m to ensure that the tracker did not lose the target. This parameter was calculated according to the waiting time of intersections in this study area (30 s). Therefore, 30 s \u00d7 1.4 m/s = 42 m, where 1.4 m/s is the normal average walking speed (Fitzpatrick et al., 2006) . Sometimes, the distance is probably larger than 42 m, which may cause the tracker to lose the target; thus, the tracker will speed up to follow the target. In this case, the tracker must find the target within 30 s because of the constraints of traffic lights. The conditions of tracker finding can be expressed as follows:",

First, the relative relationships of all the experimental subjects relative to the Feng, et al. ISPRS Journal of Photogrammetry and Remote Sensing 153 (2019) 74-95 walker were derived by using Reference cutting. Then, a matrix that contained the motion trend (relative distance change and relative acceleration) was calculated through the Trending operator. This matrix was labeled with a legend of colors in Fig. 14 through the Labeling operator, which illustrates changes in the relative trend motion of the other subjects compared to the walker. In Fig. 14 , the red bins in the matrix mean that these subjects are accelerating towards the walker, orange bins mean that the subjects are decelerating towards the walker, gray bins mean that the subjects are accelerating away from the walker, blue bins mean that the subjects are decelerating away from the walker and yellow bins mean no change in distance and speed. The gray, blue and yellow relative relationship bins were removed with the Filtering operator. Fig. 15(a) shows the results after this operation. Then, the number of bins where the subjects moved towards the walker was counted by Time flattening, which counted any red or orange bins. The updated result is shown in Fig. 15(b) , indicating that more than half of the individuals were moving closer to the walker from T1 to T27 (16:14:05-16:16:15) . Similarly, Fig. 15 (c) shows the number of subjects that were accelerating towards the walker at each time, indicating that more than half of the subjects were accelerating towards the walker at eight times (T2, T4, T9-T11, T12, T15, T17, T20-T23 and T26-T27) . This study transformed these bins from relative space to absolute space by the operator of transformation between absolute space and relative space, and the locations of surrounding people are shown in Fig. 16(a) and (b) at 16:14:05 and 16:14:40, respectively. By combining all the locations of surrounding people close to the walker, we could find the concentrated area of surrounding people, which is labeled in red in Fig. 16(c) . In this case, the walker may have felt uncomfortable and potentially at risk in the crowd road. Setting walker as initial reference object, this model derived the crowd's motion trends for all subjects by the operator of initial reference transformation. Fig. 17 showed the results of initial reference transformation from object 2 at t 0 to object 14 at t 16 . Those who were moving closer to subject 2 in Fig. 17 (a) didn't show clear motion trend for the new walker (subject 14 at t 16 ) in Fig. 17(b) .

            "text": "The second comparison examined the time efficiency between the proposed model and the absolute model (Geodatabase in ArcGIS). The proposed model presents an obvious advantage in terms of conducting three functions (Point extraction, Time drilling, Reference cutting) because these functions only require a simple query, while the absolute model requires additional relative relationship transformation. The other three functions (Querying close contacts, Finding tracker and Deriving the motion trend of crowd nearby) are meaningful to real situations and require a relatively complicated implementation. Therefore, this study compared the second set of three functions that were implemented by the proposed model and absolute model. In ArcGIS, \"Buffer\" and \"Overlay analysis\" were used to implement Querying close contacts. The point features of the reference subject's trajectory were the input features of Buffer analysis in ArcToolBox. The outputs of this operation were face features that represented the close-contact area. Then, the Intersect tool in Overlay analysis could be used to check the status of the subjects' trajectories inside or outside the close contact area. However, no appropriate tools exist in ArcGIS to directly implement Finding tracker or Deriving the motion trend of crowd nearby. In terms of Finding tracker, we computed each subject's distance relative to the reference subject at each time via coordinates in Geodatabase and filtered the subjects according to the conditions in Section 5.3. In terms of Deriving the motion trend of crowd nearby, we calculated all the subjects' relative speeds and relative accelerations relative to the reference subject and statistically counted five types of motion trends, as described in Section 5.4. Table 8 lists the execution times of the three selected functions for the proposed model and absolute GIS method with 12 of the 14 datasets; these last two datasets were omitted because the absolute GIS method would stop responding if the volume the of dataset increased to 3.5 GB. Fig. 19 illustrates the computation time of each function among these datasets. The execution times of the proposed model were approximately 5-50% those of the absolute GIS method for the same function. The computation time of Querying close contacts for the proposed model was approximately 5% that for the absolute GIS method, the most evident improvement from the proposed model. This improvement considerably increased with increasing dataset volume ( Fig. 19(a) ), and the execution-time difference was 331 s when the volume was 3.46 GB. The second function was Deriving the motion trend of the crowd nearby, whose time-efficiency improvement was similar to that of Querying close contacts. The execution time of the proposed model was approximately 10% that of the absolute GIS method. Additionally, the improvement from the proposed model became significant if the dataset's records were larger than 3*10 7 (Fig. 19(c) ). The execution-time difference was 171 s when the volume was 3.46 GB. The execution time of the third function (Finding tracker) with the proposed model was only 10%-50% that of the absolute GIS method; this improvement was not as evident as that for the previous two functions. In Fig. 19(b) , the execution time from the proposed model and absolute GIS method steadily increased as the number of dataset records increased. However, the execution-time difference only reached 8.146 s when the dataset's volume was 3.46 GB, an insignificant increase compared to the previous two functions. This result indicates that the proposed model exhibits better efficiency when implementing these functions compared to the absolute GIS method.",

In absolute GIS, this task could be achieved by buffer analysis in ArcGIS software. Corresponding buffer areas related to a carrier had to be built while it was moving all the time in absolute space. However, in the proposed model, there is no need to build many buffer areas to recognize relationships in all time. It only executed once reference cutting to get all object's relationships to the carrier, no matter how many objects in the scenario. This is fundamental reason for the better performance of our model in this case study.

It is a complicated computation process in absolute GIS method. The proposed model directly extracted each object's relationship referred to the target in relative space by reference cutting. Then, the operators of trending and matching were used to find tracker. These computation processes are simple matrix-based computation.

In this model, the X and Y in STC are substituted as the reference and target objects, and the STB in STC are extended to store the data structure related to relative relationship among moving objects. To support the analysis of moving objects, this paper introduces six classes of operators according to the type of relationship outcome, namely, query processing, group relative dynamic calculation, transformation between absolute space and relative space, initial reference object transformation, attribute transformation, relative relationship dynamic pattern transformation. Then, two common used algorithms, relative relationship querying and relative relationship dynamic pattern matching, are introduced on the base of these defined operators. The former algorithm organizes the relative relationship as three dimensions (Reference object, Target object and Time) based on the model's structure, and queries relative relationship by corresponding objects and time. The later algorithm implements reference cutting and labeling to match each object's relative motion with specific pattern, which simplifies similarity measure in absolute space. This study collected the trajectories of walking pedestrian and used these data to demonstrate the feasibility of the proposed model. Finally, the proposed model was successfully tested in three real-life scenarios to analyze dynamic and complex relationships between moving objects. The results validated the capabilities of these designed functions and indicated that the proposed model saved up to 50%-95% execution time compared with traditional absolute GIS methods. And the proposed model could be widely applied in the domains of public health, security, individual-based services. Therefore, the contributions of this paper could be summarized as follows:",
