To analyze the samples for viral infection using the Anyplex\u2122 assays, cDNA was first synthesized from extracted nucleic acids using the cDNA Synthesis Premix included (Seegene, Inc.). Anyplex\u2122 assays were analyzed in real-time using the CFX96\u2122 Real-time PCR System (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Berkley, CA., USA).

Because S. pneumoniae, H. influenzae, and coronavirus 229E/NL63 were only included in the Seeplex \u00ae assays and B. parapertussis, coronavirus 229E, coronavirus NL63 were only included in the Anyplex\u2122 assays, Kappa scores could not be calculated. Pathogens without any positive results or without a Kappa score were excluded from the table. Nevertheless, a high degree of correlation was found between the two assays. Agreement was highest for M. pneumoniae, B. pertussis, metapneumovirus and respiratory syncytial virus A. Low Kappa values, indicating poor agreement (i.e., those calculated for adenovirus and human enterovirus) likely reflect the differences in the genetic targets used among the two assays. For example, in addition to the adenovirus types detected by Seeplex \u00ae , the Anyplex\u2122 II kit also detects types 2, 4 and 5. Moreover, the Anyplex\u2122 II kit detects multiple strains of both coxsackievirus and echovirus as human enterovirus, according to the included user manual (Seegene, Inc.)",

Although, the workload for each of these assays is lighter when compared to culture detection, some downfalls do exist. For instance, the Seeplex \u00ae assays require post-amplification detection after nucleic acid extraction and amplification. Furthermore, because of the post-amplification detection, Seeplex \u00ae results are subject to more interpretation, creating the potential for false positive results. In contrast, the Anyplex\u2122 assays do not require post-amplification detection; therefore, runtime is reduced. Realtime detection also eliminates the manipulation of amplified products, which minimizes problems associated with amplicon contamination and carryover [10] . Still, Anyplex\u2122 II kits are measured against an internal threshold set by the manufacturer, which could potentially create false negative results. However, despite these minor shortcomings, the sensitivities and specificities are comparable with other PCR detection kits [1, 6, 7, 11, 12] , and remain high when evaluated against bacteria and viral culture [12, 13] . Kim et al., specifically states that Anyplex\u2122 and Seeplex \u00ae kits are superior to the Luminex xTAG respiratory viral panel because they are time saving and less labor-intensive [6] .",
