Transplant recipients are susceptible to a broad spectrum of infectious pathogens while manifesting diminished signs and symptoms of invasive infection. Thus the diagnosis of infection is more difficult in transplant recipients than in immunologically normal individuals. The interactions between infection, immunosuppression, and immune function often result in clinical syndromes reflecting multiple simultaneous processes, such as infection and graft rejection. Immunocompromised patients tolerate invasive infection poorly, with high morbidity and mortality, lending urgency to the need for an early, specific diagnosis to guide antimicrobial therapy. Given the predominant T-lymphocyte dysfunction inherent to transplant immunosuppression, viral infections are a major contributor to morbidity resulting in graft dysfunction, graft rejection, systemic illness, and increased risk for other opportunistic infections (e.g., Pneumocystis and Aspergillus) and virally mediated cancers.",

Some of these infections are latent (e.g., viral, parasitic), whereas others are active (e.g., bacteremia, fungemia) in the donor at the time of procurement. Frequent pathogens and endemic organisms causing significant morbidity in recipients form the basis of screening paradigms for organ donors. [5] [6] [7] Bloodstream infections (with bacteria or yeast) in donors at the time of donation can cause local (abscess) or systemic infections, and, importantly, may adhere to anastomotic sites (vascular, urinary) to produce leaks or mycotic aneurysms. Transmission of some donor-derived viral infections are common and expected, including cytomegalovirus (CMV) and Epstein-Barr virus (EBV), and are associated with specific syndromes in transplant recipients (see section on selected infections of importance). The greatest risk of viral infections is transmission from seropositive donors (latent infection) to seronegative (immunologically na\u00efve) recipients (or D+/R\u2212). Some viruses demonstrate accelerated progression (lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus [LCMV] , rabies, West Nile virus [WNV] ) in transplant recipients. Latent infections, such as tuberculosis, toxoplasmosis, or strongyloidiasis, may activate many years after the initial, often unrecognized exposures.",

            "text": "Donor screening for transplantation is limited by the available technology and by time constraints within which organs from deceased donors must be used (discussed later). 5, 8, 9 Routine screening of donors relies on history, and both antibody detection (serologic tests) and nucleic acid testing (NAT) for common infections. Risk factors for infection in the donor are often unknown. As a result, transmission may occur from seronegative donors with active viral or other exposures (before seroconversion in the \"window period\") or with viral loads below the limits of detection by the NAT selected. This risk has been demonstrated by clusters of donor-derived Trypanosoma cruzi (Chagas' disease), rabies virus, WNV, and LCMV infections in organ transplant recipients. 7,10-13 NAT for donor screening (e.g., for human immunodeficiency virus [HIV] , hepatitis B virus [HBV] , hepatitis C virus [HCV] , WNV) has the capacity to reduce the window period between exposure and pathogen detection over serologic tests albeit with some risk for false-positive assays given heightened assay sensitivity. [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] Given the risk of transmission of infection from the organ donor to recipients, certain syndromes should be considered relative contraindications to organ donation. Because kidney transplantation is typically elective surgery, it is reasonable to avoid donation from individuals with unexplained fever, rash, or infectious syndromes, including meningitis or encephalitis. At some centers, transplantation from donors with untreated HCV or HIV (to HIV-positive recipients) infections is undertaken. Common criteria for exclusion of organ donors are listed in Table 31 .2.",

            "text": "A crucial challenge in screening deceased organ donors is the narrow time frame for the evaluation. A useful organ must be procured and implanted before some microbiologic assessments have been completed. Thus bacteremia or fungemia may not be detected until after transplantation has been performed. Such infections generally have not resulted in transmission of infection if the infection has been adequately treated before procurement using antimicrobial agents to which the organism is susceptible for an appropriate duration. In recipients of tissues from 95 bacteremic donors, a mean of 3.8 days of effective therapy after transplantation prevented transmission of susceptible pathogens (in an era of reduced antimicrobial resistance). Surveillance with additional courses of therapy in the recipient are employed, targeting known donor-derived pathogens. 2, 35 Bacterial meningitis must be treated with antibiotics that penetrate the cerebrospinal fluid before organ procurement. Individuals with unidentified and untreated causes of meningoencephalitis or sepsis should not be used as organ donors. Donor-derived infections caused by Candida species have resulted from organ contamination or candidemia at the time of procurement. 36, 37 Susceptibility testing of the isolate and prolonged treatment (2-4 weeks) with effective agents to avoid pyelonephritis, abscess formation, mycotic aneurysm, or candidemia in the recipient is recommended. Vascular involvement by Candida species in the recipient requires at least 6 weeks of therapy. Certain active infections (CMV, VZV, HSV, EBV, or HCV) may be unsuspected even in the seropositive donor and require NAT for diagnosis. Likewise, the donor's clinical, social, and medical histories are essential to reducing the risk of such infections. Known infection should be treated before procurement if possible. See previous discussion of unrecognized donor pathogens. Major exclusion criteria are outlined in Table 31 .2.",

Other at-risk groups include adults coinfected with CMV or those receiving greater intensity of immunosuppression, notably with T cell depletion and possibly with belatacept. [46] [47] [48] Monitoring should be considered for at-risk individuals using a quantitative molecular assay for EBV. 49 EBV is also a cofactor for other lymphoid malignancies. VZV screening should be used to identify seronegative individuals (no history of chickenpox or shingles) for vaccination before transplantation. It is likely, although unstudied, that the new herpes zoster subunit vaccine will replace live vaccine before and after transplantation. HSV screening is performed by most centers although active infection is prevented by most anti-CMV prophylaxis (except with newer agents such as maribavir and letermovir) during the posttransplant period. VZV serologic status is particularly important in nonimmune children who may be exposed at school (for antiviral or VZV immunoglobulin prophylaxis) and in adults with atypical presentations of infection (pneumonia or gastrointestinal disease). Other herpesviruses also may reactivate, with HHV-6 and HHV-7 serving as cofactors for CMV and fungal infections, and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus (HHV-8) causing malignancy, notably in endemic regions in South America and surrounding the Mediterranean basin.",

For latent viral infections or tuberculosis, activation is evidence of excessive immunosuppression relative to the host's immune function. In contrast, for intercurrent bacterial or fungal infections, reductions in immunosuppression might be reversed when resolution of infection is demonstrated. The specific reduction chosen may depend on the organisms isolated (e.g., corticosteroids and bacterial infections). Similarly, reversal of some immune deficits (e.g., neutropenia, hypogammaglobulinemia) may be possible with adjunctive therapies (e.g., colony-stimulating factors or antibody therapy).

These events share features of inflammation and fever, endothelial activation and injury, and secretion of proinflammatory cytokines, including tumor necrosis factor-\u03b1 that activates intracellular NF-\u03baB. NF-\u03baB translocates to the cell nucleus to activate the CMV major immediate-early promoter/enhancer and viral replication. 76, 77 The risk of viral activation with graft rejection is most prominent in the D+/R\u2212 combination with the alloimmune response producing graft inflammation and injury, generally the site of greatest viral load and MHC mismatch, intensification of immunosuppression, systemic inflammation with fever, and enhanced MHC display in the allograft. Thus a bidirectional linkage exists between CMV replication and graft rejection. Reinke et al. 67 showed that 17 of 21 patients with biopsy evidence of late acute rejection demonstrated a response to antiviral therapy. Similarly, Lowance and colleagues have demonstrated that preventing CMV infection also resulted in a lower incidence of graft rejection. 73, 78 The cellular and immunologic effects of CMV (\"indirect effects\") are as important to the immunocompromised host as invasive viral infection. The mechanisms for these effects are complex and relate to viral strategies to evade the host's responses and allow CMV-infected antigen-presenting cells to travel throughout the host and spread the virus.",

The antigenemia assay is labor-intensive and, being semiquantitative, it is less commonly used than NAT; circulating neutrophils are immunostained for CMV early antigen (pp65) that is taken up nonspecifically as a measure of the total viral burden. QNAT is generally used for diagnosis, preemptive management strategies, and monitoring response to therapy. [85] [86] [87] [88] [89] CMV deoxyribonucleic acid (DNA) is generally detected earlier in whole blood compared with plasma; one specimen type and one laboratory should be used when monitoring patients. The highest viral loads often are associated with tissue-invasive disease; the lowest are associated with asymptomatic CMV infection. Multiple viral strains are often present during infection. Viral loads present during CMV syndrome vary widely. A single quantitative assay should be used consistently for monitoring each patient. A World Health Organization (WHO) International Reference Standard became available in 2010 from a clinical isolate (Merlin) with a titer of 5\u00d7106 IU/mL. All laboratory tests should be calibrated to the WHO International Standard with results reported as IU/mL. 90 One source of variability is different DNA extraction methods. Multiple viral genotypes may be observed, often in patients with more severe disease and in antiviral resistance. Resistance testing should be performed in the face of poor clinical and virologic response to adequate therapy for at least 10 to 14 days; responses may be delayed with high-level viremia. Multiple risk factors for drug resistance often coexist, including prolonged antiviral drug exposure; notably with inadequate dosing, lack of immunity, high-level viral replication; and intensive immunosuppression.",

In preemptive therapy, QNAT assays are used to monitor patients at predefined intervals (generally weekly for weeks 1-12) to detect early disease. Positive assays result in therapy. Preemptive therapy incurs extra costs for monitoring and coordination of outpatient care, while reducing the cost of drugs and the inherent toxicities. Prophylaxis has the possible advantage of not only preventing CMV infection during the period of greatest risk but also diminishing infections secondary to HHV-6, HHV-7, and EBV. The indirect effects of CMV (i.e., graft rejection, herpesvirus infections, opportunistic infections) also may be reduced by routine prophylaxis. In practice, neither universal prophylaxis nor preemptive therapy is perfect. Many centers use a combination of both approaches: universal prophylaxis for the highest-risk recipients (D+/R\u2212 and R+ with T cell depletion) and preemptive therapy for others.

Current data support the use of universal prophylaxis (not preemptive therapy) in the prevention of indirect effects of CMV infection, including PTLD, opportunistic infections, allograft rejection, and mortality. 73 Increasingly, \"late\" disease has been observed after the completion of prophylaxis. 92, 93 Thus monitoring may be useful after prophylaxis. The rate of late disease varies but is thought to be as high as 17% to 37% in D+/R\u2212 recipients, supporting the value of prophylaxis for 6 months in D+/R\u2212 renal recipients (the IMPACT study). 93 Options for CMV prophylaxis include valganciclovir (900 mg orally once daily), oral ganciclovir (1 g three times daily), intravenous ganciclovir (5 mg/kg once daily), or high-dose oral valacyclovir (2 g four times daily)-each corrected for renal function. Valganciclovir and ganciclovir are associated with neutropenia; however, dose reduction risks breakthrough viremia and the emergence of viral resistance.

In symptomatic patients slow to respond to therapy and who are seronegative, the addition of CMV hyperimmune globulin (150 mg/ kg/dose IV monthly) for 3 months is controversial, costly, and of uncertain benefit. Relapse does occur, primarily in seronegative patients, in those with high viral burdens, if not treated to the achievement of a negative quantitative assay, and in gastrointestinal disease treated with an oral regimen. Repeat endoscopy may be considered with poor clinical response, or if other processes are present (ischemia, cancer).

Such patients may benefit from 2 to 4 months of oral valganciclovir (900 mg daily based on creatinine clearance) administered as secondary prophylaxis after the completion of intravenous therapy.

Clinically, the patient's viral load or clinical syndrome fails to respond to appropriate therapy, including a reduction in immunosuppression over 10 to 14 days. Genetic resistance testing is useful in managing resistant CMV infection. Many mutations have now been identified, including mutations in the viral UL97 (thymidine kinase) or UL54 (DNA polymerase) genes that confer ganciclovir resistance. Some of the common mutations in the UL97 gene respond to higher doses of intravenous ganciclovir. Combined mutations (UL97 and UL54) may manifest high-level resistance to ganciclovir. Alternative therapies have been available in intravenous form only. These include foscarnet and cidofovir. Foscarnet is active against many ganciclovirresistant strains of CMV, although associated with marked magnesium and potassium wasting, seizures (notably with calcineurin inhibitor therapy), and renal toxicity. Cidofovir may also be used, but often incurs significant nephrotoxicity and ocular toxicity. Viral polymerase UL54 mutations may cause resistance to foscarnet and cidofovir depending on the nature of the mutation.

In the polyclonal form, particularly in children, reestablishment of immune function may suffice to cause PTLD to regress. 120 At this stage, it is possible that antiviral therapy might have some utility given the viremia and role of EBV, and of CMV, if present, as an immunosuppressive agent. 121 With progression of disease to extranodal and monoclonal malignant forms, reduction in immunosuppression may be useful, but alternative therapies are often required. In kidney transplantation, the failure to regress with significant reductions in immunosuppression may suggest the need to sacrifice the allograft for patient survival. Combinations of anti-B cell therapy (anti-CD20, rituximab), chemotherapy (CHOP: cyclophosphamide, hydroxydaunomycin, vincristine, prednisone), irradiation especially for CNS tumors, or adoptive immunotherapy with stimulated T cells have been used.

Less commonly, polyomaviruses have been identified in association with trichodysplasia spinulosa (TSV), in some malignancies (Merkel cell carcinoma [MCV]), and in condylomas. Tissue receptors for these human viruses are ubiquitous. The seroprevalence in adults for all polyomaviruses ranges from 40% to 90%. BKV resides in latency in renal tubular epithelial cells. JCV also has been isolated from renal tissues but has preferred tropism for neural tissues.

BKV nephropathy is rarely recognized in recipients of extrarenal organs. The clinical presentation of disease is usually as asymptomatic, sterile pyuria, reflecting shedding of infected tubular and ureteric epithelial cells. These cells contain sheets of virus and are detected by urine cytology as \"decoy cells.\" In some cases, the patient presents with diminished renal allograft function or with ureteric stenosis and obstruction. In such patients, the etiologies of decreased renal function must be carefully evaluated (e.g., mechanical obstruction, drug toxicity, pyelonephritis, rejection, thrombosis, recurrent disease), and choices must be made between increasing immunosuppression to treat suspected graft rejection or reducing immunosuppression to allow the immune system to control infection. 131, 132 Patients with BKV nephropathy treated with increased immunosuppression have a high incidence of graft loss. Reduced immunosuppression may stabilize renal allograft function but risks graft rejection.

The use of urine cytology to detect the presence of infected decoy cells in the urine has high sensitivity for BKV infection but a low (29%) predictive value for PyVAN. Detection of urine BKV by electron microscopy, urine BKV viral (DNA) loads greater than 7 log gEq/mL or BKV VP1 gene mRNA of >6 log copies/ng total urine RNA are useful diagnostically, keeping in mind that BKV molecular tests vary depending on the target and the matrix tested. Patients with BKV nephropathy tend to have higher plasma viral loads; in one study >7700 BKV copies per mL of plasma, P < 0.001, 50% positive predictive value, 100% negative predictive value compared with patients without disease. 135 A high serum BKV viral load is considered a basis for reduction in immunosuppression, especially if serum creatinine has risen. The diagnosis should be made by the demonstration of BKV cytopathic changes with cellular infiltration consistent with the diagnosis of interstitial nephritis in the allograft and by immunohistology for BKV proteins, or by in situ hybridization for BKV nucleic acids in a renal biopsy. There is a semiquantitative scoring system for histologic changes of PyVAN. 135 For immunohistochemistry, crossreacting antibodies against the large T antigen of the simian virus 40 or antibodies against BKVVP1 or agnoprotein have been used. PyVAN is characterized by intranuclear polyomavirus inclusion bodies in tubular epithelial and/or glomerular cells. Fibrosis is often prominent, occasionally with calcification. PyVAN is often focal, with false-negative biopsies in some cases. Graft rejection may accompany PyVAN, and complicates both diagnosis and management.",

Screening can also be performed using plasma BKV DNA loads. For patients with plasma BKV DNA loads of >4 log10 gEq/mL on duplicate testing 2 to 3 weeks apart, a presumptive diagnosis of PyVAN should be made and immunosuppression reduced (see later).

Soon after transplantation, CNS fungal infection is most often a result of Aspergillus; 1 year or later after transplantation, other fungi (Mucorales, dematiaceous fungi) become more prominent. The drug of choice for documented Aspergillus infection is voriconazole, despite its significant interactions with calcineurin inhibitors and rapamycin. 138, 139 Isavuconazole, an azole antifungal with activity against yeasts, Aspergillus, and some Mucorales, has been shown to be safe and efficacious in solid-organ transplant recipients although it may require dose adjustment and therapeutic drug monitoring of immunosuppressive agents.

Combination therapy using voriconazole and anidulafungin has been studied in the hematologic malignancy population but did not show a survival advantage.

The risk of infection with PJP is greatest in the first 6 months after transplantation (up to 10% without TMP-SMX or other prophylaxis) and during periods of increased immunosuppression. [152] [153] [154] [155] There is a continued risk of infection in three overlapping groups of transplant recipients: (1) recipients who require higher than normal levels of immunosuppression (notably corticosteroids) for prolonged periods because of poor allograft function or chronic rejection; (2) recipients with chronic CMV infection; and (3) recipients undergoing treatments (e.g., cancer chemotherapy, drug toxicity) that increase the level of immunodeficiency or neutropenia. The expected mortality secondary to PJP is increased in patients on cyclosporine compared with other immunocompromised hosts. The hallmark of PJP is the presence of marked hypoxemia, dyspnea, and cough with a paucity of physical or radiologic findings. In the transplant recipient, PJP is generally acute to subacute in development. Atypical Pneumocystis infection (radiographically or clinically) may be seen in patients who have coexisting pulmonary infections or who develop disease while receiving prophylaxis with second-line agents (e.g., pentamidine or atovaquone). Patients presenting with PJP outside the usual highest risk period may have indolent disease that can be confused radiographically with heart failure. mTOR inhibitors (sirolimus and everolimus) have also been associated with the development of interstitial lung disease that can be confused radiographically and clinically with PJP. 156 Further, two case-control studies reported an association between the use of sirolimus and the development of PJP. 157, 158 In such patients, invasive procedures are often required for definitive diagnosis.",

No diagnostic pattern exists for PJP on routine chest radiograph.
