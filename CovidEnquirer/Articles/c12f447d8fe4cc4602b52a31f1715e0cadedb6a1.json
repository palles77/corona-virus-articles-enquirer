However, in the absence of vaccination and among a population with increased numbers of immunocompromised persons, the risk for human poxvirus infections is increasing. Early diagnosis is essential for differentiating cowpox from illnesses and skin reactions with similar signs and symptoms, such as smallpox, monkeypox, generalized vaccinia virus infection, disseminated herpes zoster and herpes simplex virus infections, drug-associated eruptions, erythema multiforme, enterovirus infections, secondary syphilis, scabies, insect bites, impetigo, and molluscum contagiosum. The oral drug tecovirimat (previously known as ST-246), as well as cidofovir, CMX-001 (an antiviral substance), and vaccinia immune globulin, should be considered for use as postexposure therapeutic treatment for orthopoxvirus disease (10).

MERS-CoV is a cause of concern for global public health. The only natural host of MERS-CoV identified so far is the dromedary camel (Camel dromedarius) (1, 2) , and transmission from camels to humans has been documented (3). The geographic distribution of MERS-CoV in dromedaries extends beyond the Arabian Peninsula (where human cases have been reported) to North and East Africa (where human cases have not been reported) (2, 4) . However, MERS-CoV from a camel in Egypt and MERS-CoV from a human were phenotypically similar in tropism and replication competence in ex vivo cultures of the human respiratory tract (5) .",

Serum samples were tested for MERS-CoV antibodies at a screening dilution of 1:20 by using a validated MERS-CoV (strain EMC) spike pseudoparticle neutralization test (9) . Positive and negative controls were included in each run. Absence of positivity for any sample indicated a lack of recent or past MERS-CoV infection.",

However, the finding that MERS-CoV is not endemic in dromedaries in all geographic regions suggests the possibility that dromedaries may not be the ultimate natural reservoir (i.e., the long-term host of a pathogen of an infectious disease). Topography (i.e., mountain chains) may limit camel movements from the Middle East or Africa to Central Asia, although such interchange certainly occurred centuries ago as a consequence of the silk-trade routes through southern Kazakhstan. The only known recent imports to Kazakhstan are dromedaries (Arvana breed), brought from Turkmenistan for cross-breeding with Bactrians to improve milk production (8) . The findings that MERS-CoV is not universally endemic in dromedaries raises the hypothesis that certain species of bats or some other animal, the environment, or both, may constitute a maintenance community and be the true natural reservoir of MERS-CoV and that the virus spills over to camels and is maintained within camels for varying periods of time.",
