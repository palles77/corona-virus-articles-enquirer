The postictal phase is characterized by abnormal behavior, disorientation, weakness, blindness, and sensory or motor dysfunction that can last from minutes to 48 hours. E. The interictal period is the time between seizures, during which the animal is clinically and neurologically normal. F. Status epilepticus is a seizure lasting >5 minutes or repeated seizures without a return to consciousness between them (Thomas, 2003) . G. Cluster seizures are defi ned as \u22652 seizures within 24 hours. VIII. Epilepsy is defi ned as recurrent seizure activity caused by a chronic brain disorder (Berendt and Gram, 1999) . A. Strictly defi ned, epilepsy does not imply an underlying cause of recurrent seizures. B. Epilepsy is commonly applied to situations in which an underlying cause is not defi ned and there may be a possible inheritance of the seizures. 1. There is a familial predisposition for idiopathic epilepsy in certain breeds of dogs. 2. In dogs, the age at onset is 1 to 5 years. 3. Often the seizures are generalized, but they can be partial. 4. Seizures occur spontaneously, often during rest or sleep. 5. Seizure frequency initially is every 4 to 6 weeks. 6. There is a tendency for frequency to increase if left untreated. C. Refractory epilepsy is frequent or severe seizure activity despite appropriate therapy.",

The activity disperses to different areas of the brain over thalamocortical pathways, intrahemispheric association or commissural pathways (Podell, 2004) . III. The cause of the excessive electrical discharge may be an increased excitability of neurons (Gandini et al., 2005) . IV. A common mechanism may involve changes in equilibrium between the main inhibitory neurotransmitter (gamma aminobutyric acid [GABA]), and the main ex-citatory neurotransmitter (glutamate), with greater concentrations of glutamate (Fenner and Hass, 1989) . V. If the epileptic focus activates a critical number of areas, a generalized seizure occurs (March, 1998) . VI. Theoretically, the more new seizure foci that are recruited, the more diffi cult the seizures are to control medically (Podell, 2004) . VII. The end of the seizure is normally caused by active inhibition (Gandini et al., 2005) . VIII. Seizures can result in various secondary intracranial consequences.",

Despite lack of evidence or identifi cation of an underlying etiology, cryptogenic epilepsy is often presumed in dogs <1 year or >5 years and in most cats with seizures. X. Age relationship to causes in dogs (see Table 22-2) A. Age <1 year 1. Dogs often have symptomatic or reactive epilepsy. 2. Seizure activity often arises from congenital anomalies or infl ammatory diseases of the central nervous system. a. Hydrocephalus: Chihuahua, Maltese, Yorkshire terrier, potentially any breed b. Canine distemper virus c. Noninfectious infl ammatory diseases: necrotizing meningoencephalitis in the pug, necrotizing leukoencephalomyelitis in the Yorkshire terrier, Maltese, Chihuahua, and other small breeds 3. Portosystemic shunts must always be ruled out in this age group. B. Age 1 to 5 years 1. Most common cause: idiopathic epilepsy 2. Later onset of seizure possible with congenital anomalies C. Age >5 years 1. Intracranial neoplasia is a common cause. 2. Cryptogenic epilepsy is suspected when an underlying etiology cannot be found. XI. Age relationship to causes in cats A. Age <1 year 1. Infectious infl ammatory diseases: FIP, protozoal diseases 2. Congenital anomalies of the brain 3. Metabolic disorders, portosystemic shunts B. Age 1 to 7 years 1. Infectious, infl ammatory diseases 2. Trauma 3. Vascular insults: feline ischemic encephalopathy from Cuterebra spp. It may be administered IV, rectally, or intranasally. 3. Midazolam can be used as an alternative.C. In reactive epilepsy, treatment of the underlying etiology is undertaken. D. With cryptogenic or idiopathic epileptic seizures, longterm anticonvulsive drugs are initiated simultaneously with benzodiazepine administration. E. If seizures stop after emergency treatment, then continue with long-term anticonvulsants. II. The goal of long-term treatment is to provide chronic control of seizure activity. In cases where an identifi able structural lesion is causing seizures 5. Delayed onset of seizure activity after head trauma III. Long-term anticonvulsants are initiated after emergency control of seizures(Table 22-3).A. Phenobarbital is the anticonvulsant of choice and can be used in both dogs and cats. If seizures recur after stopping the CRI, restart a diazepam or midazolam CRI for another 6 hours and continue phenobarbital 2 mg/kg IV, IM, PO BID. 7. If seizures do not stop with repeated diazepam or midazolam, then give propofol 4 to 8 mg/kg IV and start a",

IV. Dose adjustment of phenobarbital is initially based on the degree of seizure control.A. If the high end of the dosage range is needed to control seizures, serum phenobarbital levels are measured to prevent toxicity. 1. Levels can be checked at any time during the day after steady state has been reached. 2. Avoid serum separator tubes, because silicon binds phenobarbital and results in artifi cially low serum levels. 3. Therapeutic serum phenobarbital levels (dependent on laboratory) are as follows: a. Dogs: 20 to 40 mg/mL b. Cats: 10 to 30 mg/mL B. Side effects of phenobarbital are listed inTable 22-3. C. A CBC, biochemistry profi le, and urinalysis are performed every 6 months. D.
