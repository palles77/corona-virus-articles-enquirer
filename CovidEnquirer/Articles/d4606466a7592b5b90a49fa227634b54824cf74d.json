The subjects of interest were the travelers from the disease affected countries to the United States. The health inspection strategies were represented by discrete event simulation models. The simulation model focused on the West African Ebola virus epidemic, which occurred from 2014 to 2016. The health screening strategies analyzed included different combinations of screening station locations (origins, destinations, and/or connecting airports). This research also studied the effectiveness of the screening strategies by varying the percentages of symptomatic travelers who were infected with the infectious disease.",

They are either asymptomatic carriers or spreaders. Asymptomatic carriers, or simply carriers, are persons who are infected with the pathogenic microorganism, but do not confer any symptom. Depending on the disease, asymptomatic carriers might, acting as a host, potentially transmit the disease's pathogenic microorganism to other persons. Asymptomatic carriers are difficult to distinguish from persons who are not sick, by observation and by the devices that detect the signs of the symptom. The term spreader was adopted from \"super-spreaders\" in CDC (2003a) and Wong et al. (2015) . In this paper, spreaders refer to persons who are infected with the agent and symptomatic (e.g., fever). Compared to a carrier, a spreader has a much higher tendency of transmitting the disease's pathogenic microorganism to another person. A person who is infected with an agent initially becomes a carrier, and is asymptomatic from a few days to a few weeks. After the incubation period, the infected person becomes a spreader. A spreader who travels by air transportation mode could transmit the disease's pathogenic microorganism to other travelers, to cabin crew on board the same aircraft, to anyone who comes in close contact at the airport terminals and at the destination. A carrier may become a spreader during his or her trip or after arrival at the destination. Therefore, carriers and spreaders should be identified at screening stations and be interrupted from boarding the aircrafts or entering the destination countries.",

The disease is transmitted by the bite of an infected Aedes species (Ae. aegypti and Ae. albopictus) mosquitos. The Zika Virus Disease was first discovered in Central-Eastern African monkeys in 1947, and in humans in 1952 in the same region. The first major human outbreak occurred in Oceania in 2007. The most recent outbreak began in Brazil in 2015, and has spread to many countries in South America, Central America, Africa, and Asia. Zika can be transmitted from one individual to another through a mosquito bite. In the United States, more than 41,000 Zika cases have been reported between 2015 and 2017. Zika's incubation period ranges from 3 to 12 days. However, many people who are infected with Zika either do not develop symptoms or develop only mild symptoms. The most common symptoms are fever, rash, arthralgias, conjunctivitis, myalgias, and headache. The feared consequence of the Zika infection is when it occurs during pregnancy. Maternal transmission of Zika virus to the fetus may result in microencephaly, a very serious congenital brain abnormality which leads the brain to be smaller in size (WHO, 2017c).",

During the SARS epidemic, the body temperature of both arriving and departing international air travelers at airports in Taiwan were scanned by NCITCs, and if a fever was suspected, passengers were screened by ear infrared thermometers. In addition, each entering and exiting air traveler filled-out a \"SARS Survey Form\" (Shu et al., 2005) . Gaber et al. (2009) proposed a health screening framework for international air travelers called The Frankfurt Model. It is based on the experience in screening travelers during the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic at the Frankfurt International Airport. The Frankfort Model described the exit screening process at the airport's departure terminal, and the entry screening process in the aircrafts in detail. Only the process that takes place in the terminal, which is within the scope of this research, is reviewed here. Gaber et al. (2009) proposed that the exit screening in the disease affected country be limited to departing passengers of international flights. Only travelers with valid tickets are allowed to enter the international departure terminal. Once inside the terminal, all travelers' body temperatures are measured by NCITCs. If the NCITC suspects that a traveler has a fever, the traveler's body temperature is measured again by an ear infrared thermometer. If either the NCITC or ear infrared thermometer does not indicate that the traveler is having a fever, the traveler is allowed to proceed to the check-in counter. If both the NCITC and ear infrared thermometer suspect that the traveler is having a fever, the traveler is asked to undergoes a medical examination. A traveler who \"fails\" the medical examination (who has also \"failed\" both the NCITC and ear infrared thermometer tests) is not allowed to check into the departing flight.",

Furthermore, all the sick travelers (in categories SE and S) may have fever (F ) or no fever (F ). Therefore, a traveler's health status is assigned to one of the five categories: not sick (S), sick with Ebola with fever (SEF ), sick with Ebola without fever (SEF ), sick with another illness with fever (SEF ) and sick with another illness without fever (SEF ). A person who has a health category as SEF is an Ebola carrier. A person who has a health category as SEF is likely an Ebola spreader. The purpose of health screening stations is to identify travelers with health status SE, i.e., SEF and SEF , and interrupt their trips. However, existing technologies (screening instruments) are not perfect. They are not capable of detecting all the travelers with health statues of SEF and SEF . The instruments may wrongly identify limited number of travelers with health statues of SEF and SEF\u00afas suspected cases. One of the challenges in designing screening strategies is to maximize the detection of travelers with health statues of SEF and SEF , but doing so will usually increase the alarms caused by travelers with health statues of SEF and SEF\u00af.",

The total population of the three affected countries was 23,207,613 (CIA, 2014) . The probability that a traveler was infected with Ebolavirus was estimated by dividing the number of persons infected with Ebolavirus by the total population of these countries. That was, P SE ( ) = 28,610/23,307,613 = 0.00123. Furthermore, 87% of the people who were infected with Ebolavirus showed symptoms of fever (Gostic et al., 2015) . This gave P SEF ( )= 0.00123 \u00d7 0.87 = 0.00107, and it followed that P SEF (\u00af) = 0.001123 \u00d7 0.23 = 0.00016. The probability of a traveler infected with another agent was arbitrarily set to P SE (\u00af) = 0.010, out of which 95% did not have fever (P SEF (\u00af\u00af)=0.01 \u00d7 0.95 = 0.0095) and 5% had fever (P SEF (\u00af)=0.01 \u00d7 0.05 = 0.0005). The value P SE (\u00af) = 0.010 was estimated by dividing the 178,837 cases of leather infectious diseases other than Ebola, which occurred in the three Ebola affected counties (WHO, 2016a; Knoema World Data Atlas, 2011 , by the population of these three countries. The initial estimation gave the probability of 0.0077. Considering that there were many unreported cases of such infectious diseases, the probability was arbitrarily increased to P SE (\u00af) = 0.010 in the simulation experiment. Due to the uncertainty associated with the estimation of P SE (\u00af), the P SE (\u00af) value was later varied between 0.005 and 0.015. Three P SE (\u00af) values of 0.005, 0.010 and 0.015 were used to test the sensitivity of the screening strategies in detecting travelers who were sick with Ebola (health status of SE), while there was an unknown fraction of travelers who had other leather infectious diseases (health status of S), in the absence of good estimates of the upper and lower bound values of the P SE (\u00af). The rest of the travelers were not sick.",

No trip interruption meant the traveler continued with his or her trip without any intervention. Trip interruption resulted in the traveler being sent to a secondary screening station for a medical examination, which may take a few minutes to a few hours. If, after the medical examination, the traveler was suspected to be infected with Ebola, he or she was then transferred to a quarantine facility or a hospital. The medical examination and its resulting actions were not part of the simulation. Based on the data in Gostic et al.

When an additional layer of entry screening was implemented at the airports in the United States (Strategy 2), the correct detection rate increased by only 0.63%, from 84.31% to 84.94%. The slight increase was because most of the \"travelers\" who were sick with Ebola (health status SE) had already been prevented from leaving the diseased affected countries by the exit screening process.

The lack of symptoms during the incubation period of a disease, or the development of either mild or no symptoms with some diseases, makes developing a fool-proof screening system impossible. Fig. 6 plots the number of travelers who were sick with Ebola (health status SE), uninterrupted by the screening strategies, and were allowed to enter the E.U. member states and the United States. The consequence and cost of a missed detection were beyond the scope of this research. Like the correction detection rates, the missed detection rates remained the same regardless of the P SE (\u00af) values. In Fig. 6 , the statistics at airports in E.U. member states were higher because there were more travelers from the three countries in West Africa who went to the E.U. member states than to the United States. There were, on average, 319 travelers who were sick with Ebola (health status SE) generated by the simulation model. In Strategy 0, without screening, 225 of them entered the E.U. member states and another 94 entered the United States. These uninterrupted travelers were reduced to 38 and 18, respectively, with the implementation of exit screening in the Ebola affected countries in Strategy 1. When the United States implemented entry screening at its airports (Strategy 2), the number of travelers who were sick with Ebola, but were uninterrupted and entered the United States, was reduced to 8 persons. From this point of view, the implementation of Strategy 2, with entry screening at the airports in the United States, interrupted nine travelers who were sick with Ebola (at the rate of 1 in every 67 days) when they arrived at the United States. Comparing Strategy 3 with Strategy 2, the additional entry screening measure at airports in E.U. member states in Strategy 3 further reduced the number of travelers who were sick with Ebola from entering E.U. member states and the United States, from 38 to 20, and from 8 to 7, respectively.",

The False Alarm Rate (FAR) was calculated by dividing the number of interrupted travelers who were in fact not sick (outcome I S |\u00af), by the total number of travelers who were not sick (health status S). The values of the numerator and denominator in the FAR calculation varied depending on the P SE (\u00af) value used to generate the number of travelers with specific health statutes (see Fig. 4 ). From the simulation results, the calculations of FARs are Table 3 . When the value of P SE (\u00af) is the same the number of travelers, who were not sick (health status S) was the same for all the screening strategies tested. In Strategy 0, there was no false alarm because there was no screening. When Strategies 1, 2 and 3 were implemented respectively, the number of false interruptions increased with every additional station added to a traveler's trip. With higher P SE (\u00af) values, there were more travelers sick with other illnesses. This led to fewer travelers who remained not sick. When these travelers were screened by the three strategies, the number of false alarms reduced correspondingly but the FAR remained the same. From the results in Table 3 , one can conclude that the FAR is dependent on the screening strategy but independent of the P SE (\u00af) value.",

            "text": "Some travelers who were sick with some virulent agent other than Ebola and have a fever (health status SEF ) were also interrupted by the health screening strategies. Since these other positive cases imposed additional work load to medical officers, the Other Positive Alarm Rate (OPAR) was also of interest to the system designer. If a traveler who was sick with another illness with fever, and his or her trip was interrupted at a screening station (in airports in the United States, the traveler was sent to the CDC's quarantine station within the airport terminal), the subsequent medical response is required but it is beyond the scope of this research. The OPARs were computed by dividing the number of interrupted travelers who were sick with other illnesses with fever (outcome I SEF |\u00af), by the total number of travelers who were sick with other illnesses (health status S). The computations of OPARs were presented in Table 4 . As in FAR, in Strategy 0, OPAR = 0.00% because there was no screening. As Strategies 1, 2 and 3 were implemented, the number of interrupted travelers who were sick with other illnesses with fever (outcome I SEF |\u00af) increased. However, when P SE (\u00af) remained constant, the total number of travelers who were sick with other illnesses (health status S) stayed the same. The ratio of the two caused the OPAR to increase with Strategies 1, 2 and 3. It was observed that for the same screening strategy, when P SE (\u00af) was varied between 0.005 and 0.015, both the number of positive alarms as well as the number of travelers who were sick with other illnesses increased. Overall, with the same screening strategy, when the P SE (\u00af) was tripled from 0.005 to 0.015, the increase in OPAR was at most 0.12%. Comparing the magnitude of 0.12% with OPAR in the range of 14.56%-20.01%, it was concluded that, although the P SE (\u00af) estimate was not certain, the OPAR was insensitive to the change in P SE (\u00af) values. Brown et al. (2014) reported that, between August and October 2014, 80,000 travelers left the Ebola affected countries, of which 18,000 arrived in the United States. The exit screening at the airports of the disease affected countries in West Africa did not identify any traveler who was sick with Ebola (carrier or spreader, with health status SE). There was no entry screening at airports in the United States during that period. This screening scenario was similar to Strategy 1 but most likely without proper execution, and the results were similar to what was obtained with Strategy 0. In this situation, the correct detection rate was zero, even when the number of travelers with health status of SE between August and October 2014 was unlikely to be zero. There were two travelers with health status SE who entered the United States uninterrupted. In fact, their health status was SEF at the time of arrival, but they developed a fever not long after. The missed detection rate could not be estimated because the number of travelers with a health status of SE was not known. The discussion here highlights the difficulty in determining the effectiveness of a health screening strategy due to insufficient data or good estimates of the number of travelers in each of the health categories.",

This percentage is based on the estimation by Gostic et al. (2015) . This section presents the cases when the fever prevalence rate increased to 95% (i.e., the fever became more common among the travelers who were sick with Ebola) and dropped to 50% (i.e., fever becomes less common among the travelers who were sick with Ebola). The results gave an indication on the effectiveness of the health screening strategies if the characteristic of the observable sign is different. Obviously, if the fever prevalence rate was only 50%, detecting the person infected with viral agent by measuring body temperature was not as effective as anticipated. Similar to Section 5.3, the analysis present in this section is independent of the P SE (\u00af) value. Fig. 7 plots the correct detection rates of the four screening strategies, each simulated with fever prevalence rates of 95%, 87% and 50%, respectively. When there was no screening, the fever prevalence rate did not matter. For the same screening strategy, the correct detection rate increased with the fever prevalence rate. This figure shows the importance of understanding the symptoms of the infectious disease, health status disparities, and the symptoms' prevalence rates. The screening stations should be designed for detecting the sign that has the highest prevalence rate as the indirect way of identifying travelers who are sick with the disease. Fig. 8 plots the missed detection rates for the four simulated health screening strategies each with fever prevalence rates of 95%, 87% and 50%, respectively. In all these screening strategies, the number of travelers who were sick with Ebola were the same. However, when the fever prevalence rate was lower, more travelers who were sick with Ebola remained uninterrupted. Other performance measures were not presented in this sub-section because the identifications of travelers who were not sick (health status S) and travelers with other illnesses (health status S) were independent of the Ebola's fever prevalence rate.",

The simulated scenarios progressively increased in complexity with the order of: (1) no health screening at all; (2) exit screening only at the terminals of the departing airports in the disease affected countries; (3) exit screening plus entry screening at the terminals of the arriving airports in the United States; and (4) exit screening, entry screening, plus entry screening of travelers at terminals of connecting airports in the E.U. member states en-route to the United States. Each station screened travelers by means of a questionnaire and NCITs to decide if a traveler's trip should be interrupted for a medical examination. The simulations were based on the Ebola epidemic that occurred in West African countries from 2014 to 2016. Based on the simulation results, it was concluded that exit screening alone correctly detected 83.4% of the travelers who were sick with Ebola, and who tried to leave the three West African countries for the United States and E.U. member states. Additional entry screenings at airports in the United States and connecting airports in E.U. member states brought relatively small improvements in the correct detection rate. Our numerical results appeared to justify the European Commission's decision not to implement entry screening at airports in E.U. member states. The simulation results also affirmed that the correct detection rate increased in a parallel fashion with the fever prevalence rate.",

The benefits of interrupting the trips of additional travelers who are infected with the infectious viral agent is compared against the cost of space, devices, printing of questionnaires and staff at the new screening stations.

Our simulation experiment did not put a limit on the arriving airports in the United States, because all travelers were screened in Strategies 2 and 3. -Malone et al.
