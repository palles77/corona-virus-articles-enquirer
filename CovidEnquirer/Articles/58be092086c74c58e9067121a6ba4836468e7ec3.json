However, The fever has already been falling from the day before, and the cough lasted for few more days. Since LPV/r was given to patients on day 10, it could not be regarded as being administered in the early stages of the disease. However, the authors argue that antivirals should be given early in the disease, based on this case. For the reasons described so far, it is difficult to say that LPV/r lowers the virus level or improves symptoms or is \"recommended\" for COVID-19 treatment based on this case report alone.",

But even if the epidemic is underway, we should reiterate that we should try to find evidence based on a scientific background, and be careful to advise what is not. I appreciate Dr. Kim's interest in our article entitled \"Case of the Index Patient Who Caused Tertiary Transmission of Coronavirus Disease 2019 in Korea\" and we would like to thank him for his critical comment to improve our article. 1 Our report focused on the decrease of virus loads and the alleviation of the patient's symptoms during lopinavir/ritonavir (LPV/r) administration. As Dr. Kim mentioned in the letter, our findings did not prove whether it was caused by the natural course of the disease or by the effects of drug and there is no clinical evidence. We did not argue that the decline of viral load was caused solely by the antiviral agent we used and emphasize that broader clinical trials will be needed to reveal the therapeutic efficacy of this study of this antiviral agent.",
