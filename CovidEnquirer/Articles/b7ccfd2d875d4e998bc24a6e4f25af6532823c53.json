Methods: Focus groups were conducted at the APIC 2006 Conference to evaluate ICPs' perceived needs related to disaster planning topics, products they feel are needed for education and reference materials, and lessons learned from past disasters. Results: ICPs' role in disaster preparedness and response is essential, even in noninfectious disease emergencies. Infection control issues in shelters, such as overcrowding, foodborne illness, lack of restroom facilities, inadequate environmental cleaning procedures and products, difficulty assessing disease outbreaks in shelters, inability to isolate potentially contagious patients, and too few hand hygiene supplies can contribute to secondary disease transmission. Other important topics on which ICPs need to be trained include surge capacity, employee health and safety, incident command system, educating responders and the public on disaster preparedness, addressing changing standards/recommendations, and partnering with public health. ICPs need quick reference materials, such as checklists, templates, tool kits, and algorithms to better equip them for disaster response. Conclusion: Infection control must continue to partner with public health and other responding agencies to address gaps in disaster planning. (Am J Infect Control 2007;35:374-81.) ",

Focus group sessions were audiotaped, and the tapes were transcribed verbatim. Content analysis included identifying, coding, and categorizing participants' response to the questions of interest. In addition, major themes that emerged were identified and categorized. Quotations that characterize the major themes are reported.

Participants felt that communicating this information and training to the public will prevent ''10,000 people [from] . show[ing] up at your hospital.'' Focus group participants stressed that it is important to have education or reference materials that do not rely on electricity because power outages may occur after disasters. They emphasized that disaster responders need education or reference tools that are ''rechargeable in some way other than electricity,'' such as a personal digital assistant (PDA) that uses batteries. Another option suggested by focus group participants was to have paper versions of reference materials and notebooks for recording information. One participant described it this way:",

ICPs also stated that partnering with public health would bridge gaps in public health's knowledge of infectious disease emergency planning and foster the reciprocal sharing of information. ICPs felt that some public health professionals ''are not very well trained'' on communicable disease issues ''because they're so stretched in everything they have to cover, they don't necessarily have the expertise in infection control and infectious diseases in all of the public health departments across the country.'' One participant stated that public health frequently calls their hospital during a disaster and asks, ''Can you help us out with what we should tell the public about this and this and this?'' ICPs felt that they should share their expertise of infection prevention and control knowledge with public health, which would result in a better prepared community. Shared training and participating together in disaster exercises were mentioned as 2 ways that ICPs could share information and education with public health. Participants indicated that working together through disaster exercises and training programs would strengthen the relationship between public health and ICPs. One participant described it in this way: ''[Training and exercising together] made everybody on the same level, and everybody gets along better now after that.''",

ICPs indicated that disasters involving an element of the unknown and frequent changes to practice as likely to create an evolution of fear and mistrust in health care workers and first responders. Focus group participants indicated that the fear of a potential avian influenza pandemic is causing many education and planning challenges in their facility and community. One of the biggest challenges is related to the unknown mechanism of transmission for avian influenza, resulting in conflicting guidance that has been released and the recommendation to change isolation precautions midway during the response to an outbreak. Focus group participants stressed that changing recommendations and standards also have legal and ethical considerations. The general public does not always understand why medication recommendations (such as postexposure prophylaxis for anthrax) change, and this can be interpreted as discrimination in that it appears that health care and public health are providing a lower standard of care for different victims. One participant described the challenges and potential legal consequences of changing recommendations/standards midway through disaster response this way: ",

Although ICPs are essential to disaster preparedness and response, ICPs indicate that participation is not always easy. ICPs' role in disaster response can be complicated by a lack of supplies, inability to conduct real-time surveillance, difficulty in communicating information between facilities, too few staff, need to provide training to nonhealth care individuals, and challenges in functioning within the ICS. Disasters involving an element of the unknown, such as an outbreak of a new or reemerging pathogen, increase the difficulty in response. Changing standards and recommendations must be communicated carefully to prevent mistrust among the staff and/or the general public.

Infectious disease outbreaks following disasters can devastate a community, and ICPs' expertise is needed to help prevent secondary spread within alternate care sites as well as their facility. To be most effective, ICPs need to partner with public health professionals in their region before a disaster and establish strong linkages between hospitals and community agencies. These partnerships can strengthen facility preparedness and maximize a community's ability to respond to a disaster. They should also result in stronger health care and public health systems by strengthening surveillance, communication, and basic infection prevention and control needed for day-to-day duties as well as disaster situations.",

So we were really having to deal quite a bit one-on-one with the staff [to convince them to stay], and we were there pretty long-24 hours of the day.''
