            "text": "Spatial and temporal organization of cellular signaling pathways heavily relies on compartmentalization. Structural surfaces for signal transduction can be formed by membranes, components of the cytoskeleton, membrane-surrounded organelles, or membrane-less organelles (MLOs). These MLOs occur in the cytoplasm and nucleoplasm of eukaryotic cells and have recently also been discovered in bacteria (Uversky, 2017; Brangwynne, 2013; Al-Husini et al., 2018) . These liquid-like subcellular compartments are believed to be formed by phase separation (Boeynaems et al., 2018) , a process that involves the spontaneous separation of a supersaturated solution into a dense and a dilute phase. The liquid-like nature of MLOs allows fusion and fission events and a dynamic exchange of components. MLOs comprise a variety of subcompartments including nucleoli, promyelocytic leukemia (PML) nuclear bodies, P bodies, and stress granules (SGs) (Boeynaems et al., 2018; Darling et al., 2018; Wheeler and Hyman, 2018) . The dense phase inside MLOs contains a high concentration of proteins, which may facilitate biochemical reactions and control signaling thresholds from these very crowded environments (Boeynaems et al., 2018; Gomes and Shorter, 2018; Woodruff et al., 2017) . In addition, MLOs can act as dynamic buffers for RNAs and proteins. This buffering function also serves as a passive noise filter and thus reduces the inherent randomness of chemical reactions (Saunders et al., 2012) . Different MLOs have a variety of functions ranging from the expression of rRNAs and pre-assembly of ribosomes (nucleoli) to the organization of the spindle apparatus (centrosomes) and mRNA splicing (splicing speckles) (Bernardi and Pandolfi, 2007; Boulon et al., 2010; Brangwynne, 2013; Hyman et al., 2014) . Aberrant forms of MLOs occur upon failure of the protein quality control system or by mutation of MLO-resident proteins, often causing age-related diseases such as amyotrophic lateral sclerosis, inclusion body myopathy, and frontotemporal dementia (Hock and Polymenidou, 2016; Malinovska et al., 2013; Ramaswami et al., 2013; Taylor et al., 2016) . Furthermore, various viruses hijack MLO proteins to aid in their replication (Dhillon and Rao, 2018; M\u00f6 ller and Schmitz, 2003; Nakagawa et al., 2018; Reineke and Lloyd, 2013) . MLOs are dynamically formed by an interplay between RNA and intrinsically disordered proteins (IDPs) that typically harbor low-sequence-complexity domains enriched in polar side chains (Arg, Gln, Glu, Ser, Lys) or structure-breaking amino acids (Gly, Pro) (Uversky and Dunker, 2010) . The dynamic formation of MLOs can be regulated by post-translational modifications such as acetylation, SUMOylation, or phosphorylation (Bernardi and Pandolfi, 2007; de la Vega et al., 2011; Saito et al., 2019; Wippich et al., 2013) or by environmental cues such as changes in temperature, pH, or osmolarity (Uversky, 2017) . Interestingly, a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen identified several kinases as regulators of MLO formation, including the Ser/Thr kinase TBK1 as a regulator of splicing speckles (Berchtold et al., 2018) .",

            "text": "TBK1 has been initially identified as a component of the antiviral response based on its ability to phosphorylate and thus activate IRF3 or IRF7 transcription factors, which in turn leads to inducible expression of type I interferons (IFN) (Fitzgerald et al., 2003; Sharma et al., 2003) . TBK1, IRF3, and further components for induced type I IFN signaling are known to translocate to perinuclear punctate structures (Saitoh et al., 2009; Seo et al., 2016) . Recent years have witnessed the identification of many additional TBK1 functions, which range from regulation of mitotic microtubule dynamics to the regulation of tumor necrosis factorinduced cell death (Lafont et al., 2018; Pillai et al., 2015; Xu et al., 2018) . Furthermore, stress-regulated TBK1 functions comprise its role in autophagy, mitophagy, and xenophagy (Heo et al., 2015; Pilli et al., 2012; Wild et al., 2011) . More recent evidence shows that TBK1 directly inhibits the AMP-activated protein kinase to increase energy storage and to repress respiration in adipose tissue, thus mediating a cross talk between immune signaling and metabolism . Basal TBK1 signaling is also required for the development of KRAS-driven cancers (Barbie et al., 2009) . Given the involvement of TBK1 in so many stress signaling pathways, TBK1 is a frequent target of viral proteins affecting its localization or protein-protein interactions (Liu et al., 2018; Onorati et al., 2016) .",

One possible answer to this conundrum might rely on the differential association of TBK1 to various adapter proteins, which co-determine its function (Goncalves et al., 2011) . These adapter proteins include SINTBAD (TBKBP1), TANK (I-TRAF), and AZI2 (NAP1) and serve to assist in substrate binding and also affect the subcellular localization of TBK1 (Helgason et al., 2013) . Although the adapter proteins lack any intrinsic enzymatic activity, they can affect biological functions, as exemplified by AZI2-and SINTBAD-regulated intracellular xenophagy of Salmonella (Thurston et al., 2009) . SINTBAD also facilitates activation of the autophagy-initiating kinase ULK1 to control interleukin (IL)-15-induced autophagy in natural killer T cells .",

Determination of the SINTBAD interactome allowed the identification of proteins contained in constitutive and inducible SINT-speckles or as regulators of this dynamic process. The formation of inducible SINT-speckles is inhibited by the constitutive chaperone activity of heat shock proteins (HSPs) and ULK1 signaling, whereas KAT2A (also referred to as GCN5) promotes SINT-speckle formation. The SINT-speckle components AZI2 and SINTBAD determine the threshold of TBK1 activation, which partially occurs within SINT-speckles. Knockdown of ULK1/2 was sufficient to trigger SINT-speckle formation, but interfered with focal TBK1 activation in a pathway-specific fashion.",

To test the possible impact of cellular stress on the solubility of SINTBAD, HeLa cells were exposed to heat shock for different periods, followed by fractionation into a cytosolic and a nuclear/insoluble fraction representing not only chromatin proteins but also poorly soluble or aggregated proteins. A western blot analysis revealed that treatment with heat shock triggered the time-dependent transition of SINTBAD from the soluble to the nuclear/insoluble fraction, whereas this dynamic redistribution between the fractions did not occur for the SINTBAD-related proteins AZI2 or TANK ( Figure 1A) . A similar inducible redistribution of SINTBAD also occurred in arsenite-treated 293T cells ( Figure 1B) , showing that various stressors can trigger the relocation of SINTBAD in different cell types. It was also interesting to test whether SINTBAD translocation to the insoluble fraction is also seen in response to further different stimuli representing inflammatory conditions or osmotic or proteotoxic stress. These results show that most adverse agents, with the exception of inflammatory stimuli, triggered translocation of SINTBAD to the nuclear/insoluble fraction ( Figure 1C ). This behavior was seen for the endogenous proteins and also for the adapter proteins when expressed at moderate levels (Figures S1A and S1B).",

The resolution of speckles occurred also in the absence of de novo protein synthesis ( Figure S5A ) and in the presence of different lysosome inhibitors ( Figure S5B ), suggesting that lysosomal degradation and autophagic processes do not significantly contribute to this process. As chaperone function prevents aberrant phase transition of SGs (Mateju et al., 2017) it was interesting to test whether well-characterized inhibitors of HSP70 (VER155008, Pifithrin-m) or HSP90 (geldanamycin, radicicol) affect SINTBAD localization (Massey et al., 2010; Roe et al., 1999) . Inhibition of HSP70 or HSP90 function resulted in the formation of speckles even in the absence of stress signals ( Figure 3C ), revealing the importance of continuous chaperone function for the cytosolic localization of SINTBAD. Coimmunoprecipitation experiments showed the interaction between SINTBAD and HSP70, which was impaired under thermal stress conditions ( Figure 3D ). The interaction between SINT-BAD and HSP90 was only detectable after coexpression of TBK1 ( Figure 3E ), suggesting a rather indirect interaction that can be controlled by the relative abundance of the known HSP90 interactor TBK1 (Yang et al., 2006) or that the interaction is phosphorylation dependent.",

These experiments confirmed the results of the mass spectrometry analysis and are exemplified for the interaction of SINTBAD and the tyrosine phosphatase PTPN23 or the autophagy regulator AMBRA1 ( Figure 5B ). Also, binding of ABIN2 (A20-binding inhibitor of nuclear factor-kB activation 2, also referred to as TNIP2) to SINTBAD was confirmed, and mapping experiments revealed the importance of the N-terminal region of SINTBAD for this interaction ( Figure 5C ). Interestingly, expression of SINTBAD and all of its mutants led to an increase in ABIN2 protein levels by an unknown mechanism. The other tested interactions are listed in Table S1 . The identified interacting proteins are known to serve various biological functions, as displayed in Figure 5D . While the biggest group is represented by enzymes and regulators of metabolic processes, two very prominent groups represent proteins with relevance in membrane trafficking or autophagy and also mitosis and cytoskeleton dynamics. The two smallest groups are represented by regulators of innate immunity and proteins mediating transcription, probably assisting in expression of inflammatory gene expression. To test whether mutual interactions have already been described for some of the SINTBAD-interacting proteins, we analyzed the interactors in the STRING database. This analysis revealed the existence of known protein interaction networks between the 150 proteins, as visualized in Figure 5E . We then compared the intracellular localization of SINTBAD with that of some of its interacting proteins. These experiments revealed that some of the proteins such as PTPN23 exactly mirrored the behavior of SINTBAD, as shown in Figure 5F . PTPN23 localizes in the cytosol of control cells and forms speckles after induction of cell stress. Costaining with SINTBAD revealed a complete colocalization in speckles after treatment with heat shock ( Figure 5F ) or arsenite ( Figure S8B ), confirming PTPN23 as a bona fide constituent of speckles. According to the ability of SINTBAD to bind and colocalize with further proteins we term these speckles inducible SINT-speckles.",

            "text": "Further costaining experiments revealed that some interactors can trigger the formation of SINT-speckles even in unstressed cells. An example of such a positive regulator is the lysine acetyltransferase KAT2A. Expression of this predominantly nuclear protein triggered the formation of SINT-speckles even in unstressed cells and also increased the fraction of nuclear speckles ( Figure 6A ). Another interactor triggering the formation of SINT-speckles was ABIN2, as its expression resulted in SINT-speckle formation even in unstressed cells ( Figure 6B ). The dominant effect of ABIN2 also occurred for PTPN23 ( Figure 6B , lower) and resembles that of AZI2, which was sufficient to trigger incorporation of SINTBAD into speckles (see Fig Figure S10 ). A kinase-inactive ULK1 K46I point mutant (Chan et al., 2009) , in contrast to the ULK1 wild-type, formed speckles upon cellular stress when expressed alone ( Figure 6D ). Coexpression of the kinase-inactive mutant with SINTBAD resulted in the formation of SINTspeckles even in unstressed cells, emphasizing the importance of ULK1 kinase activity for controlling SINTspeckle formation. To determine the consequences of ULK knockdown on SINT-speckle formation we interfered with the expression of ULK1 and also ULK2, as both kinases can have redundant functions (Lee and Tournier, 2011; Li et al., 2016) . Loss of both kinases already triggered the formation of SINTspeckles even in unstressed cells ( Figure 6E ), supporting the finding that constitutive ULK signaling is important for restriction of SINT-speckle formation. These kinase-dependent regulatory processes could enable regulation of SINT-speckle formation, as MLOs are highly dynamic and their formation is typically also regulated during the cell cycle (Rai et al., 2018) . This also applies to SINT-speckles, which do not occur in unstressed or stressed mitotic cells ( Figure 6F ).",

To test whether loss of ULK1 and ULK2 affects TBK1 phosphorylation in response to thermal stress, the expression of both kinases was downregulated with specific siRNAs ( Figure S11 ). Immunofluorescence analysis of control cells revealed the heat shock-activated TBK1 in focal structures mainly in the nucleus with a partial overlap with cytosolic SINT-speckles. Downregulation of ULK1/2 largely inhibited the heat shock-induced phosphorylation of TBK1 ( Figure 7B ), suggesting an important contribution of these kinases for this activation pathway. In contrast, arsenite-induced TBK1 phosphorylation was not changed by ULK1/2 knockdown and occurred to a significant part in SINTspeckles ( Figure 7B) , showing that the ULK kinases control phosphorylation of TBK1 in a pathway-specific manner.",

Treatment with arsenite or heat shock resulted in a partial recruitment of TBK1 to SINT-speckles (Figure 7C) , suggesting that this previously identified interaction (Ryzhakov and Randow, 2007) also occurs in MLOs. To investigate a possible contribution of SINTBAD for the activation of TBK1, SINTBAD and AZI2 double-deficient U2OS cells were treated for various periods with arsenite and TBK1 activation was assessed with a phospho-specific antibody by immunoblotting. Knockout of SINTBAD alone had no effect (data not shown), whereas cells lacking SINTBAD and AZI2 ( Figure S2 ) showed reduced TBK1 phosphorylation ( Figure 7D ). To investigate the contribution of SINTBAD and AZI2 for ULK1-induced TBK1 phosphorylation by an independent experimental approach, cells were transfected to express ULK1 together with SINTBAD and/or AZI2. Immunoblotting revealed that ULK1-triggered TBK1 phosphorylation was further enhanced by SINTBAD and AZI2 ( Figure 7E ), corroborating the finding that both adaptor proteins contribute to control of the TBK1 activation threshold.

            "text": "Here we identified the stress-induced translocation of SINTBAD to SINT-speckles, as revealed by immunofluorescence and cell fractionation experiments. These SINT-speckles form a subcellular compartment with no significant overlap to other characterized MLOs (Darling et al., 2018) . SINTBAD contains two lowcomplexity domains containing 12.9% Gln (residues 106-346) and 27.7% Pro (residues 340-535). Core components of constitutive SINT-speckles such as ABIN2 and AZI2, and also the inducible interactor SINTBAD, are predicted to harbor long intrinsically disordered regions ( Figure 9A , Table S1 ), which are typical for MLO-resident proteins (Elbaum-Garfinkle et al., Nott et al., 2015; Uversky and Dunker, 2010) . Accordingly, about one-third of the SINT-speckle proteins (47 from 150) are predicted to have >40% disordered regions (Table S1 ). The mechanisms controlling the formation of constitutive SINT-speckles are not known and might involve post-translational modifications such as ULK1/2-mediated phosphorylation. Another possible mechanism could involve the bridging of two ABIN2 dimers by binding to M1-linked tri-ubiquitin chains, which might facilitate ABIN2 assembly to higher-order signaling complexes (Lin et al., 2017) . Also, changes in the relative expression levels of ABIN2 speckle components affect the formation of these MLOs, explaining the abundant finding that expression of a given protein such as ABIN2 or AZI2 can affect the intracellular localization of its interactors. This behavior is characteristic for MLO formation, and accordingly, also overexpression of SG components such as TIA1 or G3BP1 is sufficient to trigger formation of SGs (Kedersha and Anderson, 2007) . This implies that physiological variations in the amounts of SINTspeckle proteins can already affect speckle formation. Regulation of ABIN2 protein levels occurs in the presence of increased glucose levels or by the kinases TPL2 or IKKa/b (Chen et al., 2013; Leotoing et al., 2011; Nanda et al., 2018) , and it will thus be interesting to investigate whether these situations will affect the formation of SINT-speckles. The formation of inducible SINT-speckles is regulated by several mechanisms, as schematically shown in Figure 9B . SINT-speckle formation is triggered by the acetyltransferase KAT2A. A recent study showed the relevance of acetylation of low-complexity domains for the formation of SGs (Saito et al., 2019) , and it will be interesting to investigate whether the enzymatic activity of KAT2A contributes to its ability to promote inducible SINT-speckle formation. Formation of inducible SINT-speckles is antagonized by the kinase activity of its component ULK1, raising the possibility of an autoregulatory control of speckle homeostasis. Interestingly, a recent study showed that, vice versa, SINTBAD Figure 6 . Continued cotransfected to express FLAG-KAT2A and hemagglutinin (HA)-SINTBAD were treated the same way. Scale bar, 10 mm.

            "text": "A B E C D is required for ULK1 phosphorylation occurring during the cell type-specific induction of autophagy , suggesting a mutual cross talk between these SINT-speckle components. Depletion of ULK1/2 leads to the formation of SINT-speckles in unstimulated cells. As expression of a kinase-inactive ULK1 mutant results in the spontaneous formation of SINT-speckles it is reasonable to assume an important contribution of the kinase function for this process. Also, other protein kinases function to restrict the formation of MLOs. The related kinases HIPK1 and HIPK2 decrease the size and number of PML-NBs during the cell cycle (Berchtold et al., 2018) , and active DYRK3 facilitates the dissolution of several types of MLOs during mitosis (Rai et al., 2018) . Kinase-dependent mechanisms might also contribute to the elimination of SINT-speckles during mitosis, a process that is accompanied by massive SINTBAD phosphorylation (Figures S12A and S12B). MLO composition can be modulated in response to stress (Boulon et al., 2010; Dellaire and Bazett-Jones, 2004) , and accordingly this study reveals the recruitment of SINTBAD to SINT-speckles in response to a variety of cell stresses or after inhibition of the chaperone function of HSPs. Heat shock-induced speckle incorporation of SINTBAD can probably also be explained by the temperature-regulated SINTBAD-HSP70 interaction. The relevance of HSP70 was also shown for the prevention of aberrant SG formation (Mateju et al., 2017) , and it will be interesting to reveal whether HSPs play a general role in the control of MLO integrity, as recently implicated by the analysis of the cellular chaperone network (Rizzolo et al., 2017) . This study revealed the existence of a large functional chaperone supercomplex and its preferential interaction with proteins forming foci or condensates under stress conditions.",

Active and phosphorylated TBK1 in arsenite-treated cells was largely occurring in the cytosol and showed considerable colocalization with SINT-speckles. In contrast, heat shock-induced TBK1 phosphorylation was mainly nuclear and showed only a partial overlap with SINT-speckles. These differential intracellular localizations together with their distinct dependency on upstream UKL1/2 signals suggest that several pathways lead to TBK1 phosphorylation. Thus it is conceivable that SINT-speckles serve as sites of TBK1 phosphorylation in a stimulus-and context-specific manner. The occurrence of phosphorylated TBK1 in SINT-speckles and also outside from these MLOs can be explained by the fact that only a fraction of TBK1 is found in SINT-speckles at a given time point. A further possible explanation is derived from the mechanism of TBK1 activation, where the initial activation of the kinase leads to rapid interdimer trans-autophosphorylation of its activation loop (Ma et al., 2012) . This implies that after primary activation of the kinase (probably facilitated by the high local protein density in SINTspeckles) active TBK1 can rapidly spread to create high local concentrations at substrate sides. This local enrichment of phosphorylated TBK1 is frequently seen by immunofluorescence and can occur in diverse subcellular localizations (Moharir et al., 2018; Pourcelot et al., 2016) . The localization of TBK1 is also controlled by differential interaction with adaptor proteins including SINTBAD, TANK, and AZI2, which compete for binding to a C-terminal interaction domain in TBK1 (Goncalves et al., 2011) . Contrary to the initial assumption that the TBK1 adaptor proteins control the antiviral function of the kinase, recent publications have shown their dispensability for IRF3 activation (Fang et al., 2017) .",

Interestingly, the ULK kinases have also been implicated in the regulation of glucose metabolic fluxes and lipid metabolism (Ro et al., 2013) . In addition, metabolic processes co-determine effector functions and cell fate decisions of cells from the innate and adaptive immune systems (Ganeshan and Chawla, 2014; Odegaard and Chawla, 2013) . Vice versa, immunomodulatory signals such as cytokines directly regulate metabolic hormones or pathways (K\u00f6 nner and Br\u00fc ning, 2011; Matsuki et al., 2003) . The second largest group is formed by proteins involved in vesicle trafficking and autophagy, which is consistent with a previous study identifying ABIN2 as a hub protein binding to components of the endosomal sorting complex (Banks et al., 2016) . This set of interactors might be also relevant for the recently uncovered role of SINTBAD as a regulator of IL-15-induced autophagy , adding to the emerging role of innate immune signaling proteins such as TBK1 and TRAF6 for the formation of autophagosomes Pilli et al., 2012; Shi and Kehrl, 2010; Thurston et al., 2009) . The third largest group of the SINTBAD interactome comprises regulators of mitosis and components of the cytoskeleton, in line with previous reports, documenting a function of TBK1 as a centrosome-associated regulator of mitotic microtubule dynamics (Pillai et al., 2015; Kim et al., 2013) . Although this study focuses on the identification and cell biological characterization of SINT-speckles, future studies must comprehensively characterize the function(s) of constitutive and inducible SINT-speckles.",

It will be interesting to investigate the functional consequences of this association as well as the molecular mechanisms leading to this interaction, as the NSs protein is a structured protein (Barski et al., 2017) . ABIN2 is also bound by the rabies virus-encoded M protein, which in turn controls the expression of inflammatory target genes (Besson et al., 2017) , and also other components of SINT-speckles assigned to the functional group ''inflammation and infection'' (see Figure 5D ) is targeted by viruses or involved in the antiviral response (Schmitz et al., 2014) . Another possible pathophysiological scenario is due to the function of MLOs as signaling hubs in a crowded microenvironment, which can come at the cost of unwanted protein aggregation. Interestingly, partial loss of TBK1 causes protein misfolding diseases, namely, familial amyotrophic lateral sclerosis and frontotemporal dementia (Freischmidt et al., 2015; Gijselinck et al., 2015) . Also, mutations in TBK1 and its substrate protein optineurin contribute to frontotemporal lobar degeneration (Le Ber et al., 2015; Pottier et al., 2015) . This disease is also associated with an elevated SINTBAD expression (Broce et al., 2018) , and it will be very interesting to reveal in future studies whether the formation and function of SINT-speckles is affected in neurodegenerative diseases.",

Full MS spectra were acquired with a data-dependent Top10/15 method that comprised a resolution of 70,000/60,000 at 200 m/z and an automatic gain control (AGC) target of 3e6 at a maximum injection time of 20 ms. The 10/15 most intense ions were further fragmented with higher-energy collisional dissociation (HCD) at a normalized collision energy of 25/27 and MS\u00b2 spectra were generated at 35,000/30,000 resolution, AGC target of 5e5/1e5 and maximum injection time 120/64 ms.",

Protein assignment was accomplished with correlation of fragment spectra with the UniProt human database (July 2016). Common contaminants were excluded from the analysis. Data processing was performed with tryptic specifications and default settings for mass tolerance in MS and MS/MS spectra. The minimal peptide length was set to 7 amino acids by default and the false discovery rate on protein and peptide level was set to 1 %. Prior to further processing of the data, contaminants, reverse entries and proteins that were only identified by a modification site were filtered out. In order to define high confidence interactors, identified proteins were classified according to criteria given in suppl. Fig. 8A . Proteins from all three groups were combined and constitute the SINTBAD interactome.",

Prionlike propagation as a pathogenic principle in frontotemporal dementia. J. Neurochem. 138 (Suppl 1 ), . Fig. S1. Relocalization of adapter proteins in response to cell stress, Related to Figure 1. 293T cells were transfected to express Flag-or HA-tagged SINTBAD (A) or AZI2 and TANK (B) as shown. Cells were stimulated with 0.5 mM arsenite for 1 h, harvested and fractionated into cytosolic (cyto.) and nuclear/insoluble (nucl./insol.) extracts. Western blotting was performed to detect the adapter proteins, controls for successful cell fractionation (histone H3 and Tubulin) and cell stimulation (ERK1/2-P). The positions of molecular weight markers are indicated. . Fig. S2. Generation of SINTBAD-and/or AZI2-deficient U2OS cells, Related to Figure 1. (A) U2OS cells were transfected with a px459 plasmid encoding a sgRNA targeting the second exon of the AZI2 gene or the first exon of SINTBAD. After selection of non-transfected cells with Puromycin, individual cell clones were grown and analyzed by Western blotting using AZI2-and SINTBAD-specific antibodies. The AZI2 antibody also detects a non-specific band which is indicated by an asterisk. Double-deficient U2OS cells were generated by transfecting the sgRNA against AZI2 into SINTBAD knockout cells. (B) Genomic DNA was isolated from SINTBADdeficient cell clones and double-knockout cells. The respective genomic region encompassing the Cas9 cleavage site was amplified by PCR and sequenced as shown. The position of homozygous insertion of a nucleotide base in comparison to the wt sequence is highlighted in blue. . Fig. S3. Characterization of U2OS-sgAZI2/sgSINTBAD (U2OS-DKO) cells reconstituted to stably express Flag-SINTBAD, Related to Figure 1. (A) U2OS wt cells, U2OS-sgAZI2/sgSINTBAD double knock-out (DKO) cells and their derivative cell clone reconstituted to stably express Flag-SINTBAD were lyzed and tested by Western blot analysis for expression of Flag-tagged SINTBAD as shown. (B) U2OS-sgAZI2/sgSINTBAD cells reconstituted to stably express Flag-SINTBAD were exposed to heat shock for the indicated periods. Cells were harvested and fractionated into cytosolic (cyto.) and nuclear/insoluble (nucl./insol.) extracts. Western blotting was performed to detect the dynamic relocalization of Flag-SINTBAD, the detection of histone H3 and Tubulin show the purity of cell fractions. Suppl. Fig. S4. Analysis of stress-induced SINTBAD relocalization, Related to Figure 1. U2OS-sgAZI2/sgSINTBAD cells reconstituted to stably express Flag-SINTBAD were treated with 0.5 M sorbitol for 1 h or the starvation medium EBSS (Axe et al., 2008) for 4 h and analyzed by indirect immunofluorescence for the intracellular distribution of SINTBAD.
