Maximal oxygen uptake (V o 2 max) is the usual measure of cardiorespiratory endurance. 7 Use of a maximal exercise test to measure V o 2 max was not feasible in this study because it requires more sophisticated equipment and par-ticipants must exercise to the point of volitional fatigue under physician supervision. 8 Submaximal exercise testing is therefore a common alternative to determine and predict a patient's cardiorespiratory fitness. 8 Cardiorespiratory fitness was assessed by the 6-minute walk test (6MWT) 9 and the Chester step test. 10 The 6MWT is a simple functional assessment commonly applied in long-term follow-up of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 11 and survivors of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS). 12 Subjects are required to walk at their own pace but to cover the farthest distance in the 6-minute time interval. 9, 11 The Chester step test is another economical method used to predict V o 2 max. 8 It is an incremental 5-level step test, commencing at the relatively slow pace of 15 steps per minute and increasing every 2 minutes to 20, 25, 30, and 35 steps per minute. The test is terminated when the subject reaches approximately 80% of maximum heart rate or a rating of perceived exertion of 6 (moderately hard). V o 2 max can then be predicted by plotting the corresponding heart rate at different step levels, with a minimum of 3 points (level 3). 10 Musculoskeletal fitness. Clinically, many SARS survivors appeared to suffer from certain degrees of weakness involving central, proximal, and distal muscles. We used a digital handheld dynamometer a to assess the isometric strength of the anterior deltoid and gluteus maximus muscles. Strength is measured as the subject attempts to hold an isometric contraction while the tester pushes against the body part with the dynamometer to break the contraction. 13 We used a Jamar handheld dynamometer b to measure the handgrip (distal muscle) strength. 14, 15 All patients also performed 1-minute curl-up and push-up tests. The numbers of curl-ups and push-ups were recorded to evaluate the endurance of their abdominal and upper-limb muscles. 16 One assessor was assigned to take all measurements.",

The remaining 171 (111 women, 60 men) patients (66.28%) who consented to participate had a mean hospitalization stay of 21.8 days, with intensive care unit (ICU) admission from 0 to 120 days (n\u03ed24; mean, 2.63\u03ee11.2d). The demographic data for all subjects are listed in table 1. Figure 1 shows the means \u03ee SDs of the 6-minute walk distance covered by the patients. It shows that distance covered declined with advancing age, from 667.57\u03ee57.13m for men who were 20 to 29 years old to 402.43\u03ee166.33m for men who were more than 60 years old, and from 636.64\u03ee93.08m for women who were 20 to 29 years old to 467.43\u03ee75.05m for women more than 60 years old. When compared with the normative data matched for age, 19 there was a significant decrease in the mean performance of our patients across different age groups (P\u0545.005), as analyzed by independent t test (table 2). Further analysis revealed that the 6-minute walk distance correlated significantly and positively with the post-SARS duration but correlated negatively with the number of hospitalization days (table 3) . The predicted V o 2 max ranged from 41.63\u03ee7.57mL\u00b7kg -1 \u00b7min -1 (age range, 20 -29y) to 39.50\u03ee11.60mL\u00b7kg -1 \u00b7min -1 (age range, 40 -49y) for men and from 37.94\u03ee8.05mL\u00b7kg -1 \u00b7min -1 (age range, 20 -29y) to 37.22\u03ee5.88mL\u00b7kg -1 \u00b7min -1 (age range, 50 -59y) for women (see fig 1) . The percentage of subjects who completed all 5 levels of the Chester step test was 41% (see table 1 ). Further analysis showed the predicted V o 2 max correlated negatively with the total dosage of prednisolone consumed while the resting heart rate correlated positively with the number of days of hospitalization (P\u03ed.022) (see table 3 ).",

However, exercise performance of recovering SARS patients was superior to patients with COPD. The 6-minute walk distance covered by our post-SARS patients (597.9m) was greater than the distance reported in studies of patients with COPD (473.5m). 24 Also, the predicted V o 2 max in SARS patients who required ICU admission was 36mL\u00b7kg -1 \u00b7min -1 , whereas for those recovering from ARDS after intensive care was 24mL\u00b7kg -1 \u00b7min -1 , 25 and for those with COPD was as low as 12.4mL\u00b7kg -1 \u00b7min -1 . 26 The decrease in cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal function in patients who were hospitalized for a mean of 3 weeks was not surprising. At the time of our assessment (82\u03ee19d from disease onset), 78 patients (45.61%) were still on maintenance steroid therapy (\u03fd0.5mg\u00b7kg -1 \u00b7d -1 of prednisolone) for residual ground-glass opacities. 5 The cause of the decreased function is believed to be multifactorial, including immobility, anxiety, drug-induced hemolytic anemia from ribavirin treatment, high-dose steroid-induced myopathy, and underlying lung pathology such as atelectasis and fibrosis. 1, 22, 23 Because SARS is a new disease, there are no previous reports on the disease profile of patients with this condition. Our findings suggest that physical and cardiorespiratory impairments in post-SARS patients are comparable to patients with ARDS. In view of their moderate physical impairment, full recovery of cardiorespiratory and musculoskeletal function should be possible through early and intensive rehabilitation programs.",

These factors, not surprisingly, resulted in the low SF-36 scores. And it appears that this predominately pulmonary disease has a greater impact on one's physical health than on one's mental health, with more profound adverse effects on women because men could probably tolerate more stress in both functional and psychological aspects. 29, 30 Because there are obvious deficits in the cardiopulmonary performance and muscular strength and endurance among our SARS patients, we intend to evaluate further the effect of a physical rehabilitation program to improve their physical profiles and HRQOL. Some patients with specific muscular deficiencies may need more professional assessment, supervision, and advice. Apart from the safety issue, a supervised exercise program is necessary to encourage and motivate patients who may experience the unpleasant sensation of exertional dyspnea in the early rehabilitation phase. These patients require coaching and monitoring to overcome their fear-avoidance behavior when participating in the exercise program. We hope a supervised and tailored exercise program may boost their physical and emotional performance.",
