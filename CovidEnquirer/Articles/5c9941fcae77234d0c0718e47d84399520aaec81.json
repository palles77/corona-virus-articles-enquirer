The species is found in the temperate Himalayas, from Kashmir to Sikkim, at an elevation of 2000-3800 m. It is found in the alpine zone on rocky soil, moraines and crevices, between boulders and near streams in specific pockets. R. emodi is restricted to the temperate, sub-alpine, and alpine zones of the Himalayas. Welldrained, porous, humus-rich soil is suitable for its cultivation. It prefers exposed or partially shaded habitat and can be cultivated at altitudes above 1800 m.",

Instead of commonly used antioxidants like butylated hydroxyanisole (BHA) and butylated hydroxytoluene (BHT), which have been restricted, due to their toxicity and DNA damage induction potential, floral resources have received considerable attention as sources of antioxidants because of their safety in biological systems. Methanolic and aqueous extracts of the roots of R. emodi are reported to possess antioxidant and anticancer potential (Rajkumar, Guha, & Kumar, 2010) . In Chinese folkloric medicine, R. emodi is used in the treatment of cancer and liver ailments. The compounds like marsupsin and maesopsin obtained from the rhizome/root extracts of R. emodi are found to possess antioxidant activity (Krenn et al., 2003) . In a study, the anthraquinone derivatives, such as aloe-emodin, emodin, rhein, chrysophanol and physcion are reported to possess anti-angiogenic activity, by preventing blood vessel formation in zebra-fish embryos (He, He, Ma, & But, 2009) . The anticancer effect of aloe-emodin has been established in two human cancer cell lines, Hep G2 and Hep 3B. Aloe-emodin inhibited cell proliferation and induced apoptosis in both examined cell lines by different antiproliferative mechanisms (Kuo, Lin, & Lin, 2002) .",

Heavy metals tend to accumulate in kidneys where they may produce a broad spectrum of morphological and functional effects (Conner & Fowler, 1993) . A number of antibiotics, including the penicillins, cephalosporins, tetracyclines, as well as aminoglycosides and sulphonamides, are potential nephrotoxins. Aminoglycoside nephrotoxicity is manifested functionally by decreased urine-concentrating capacity, tubular proteinuria, lysosomal enzymuria, mild glucosuria, decreased ammonium excretion and lowering of glomerular filtration rate (Kaloyanides, & Pastoriza-Munoz, 1980) . The nephroprotective activity of both the fractions (water-soluble and water-insoluble) of alcoholic extract of R. emodi has been established. The protective effect of water-soluble extract is pronounced on all the segments (S 1 , S 2 and S 3 ) of the proximal tubule of kidney against cadmium, mercury and potassium dichromate-induced nephrotoxicity in rats. The water-insoluble fraction was found to have protective effect on S 2 segment only. The effect has been proposed because of the tannins present in the fraction. The nephrotoxicity was induced using cadmium chloride, mercuric chloride, potassium dichromate and gentamicin in rats and monitoring the levels of urea, nitrogen and creatinine in serum (Alam, Javed, & Jafri, 2005) .",

An important characteristic of alcohol-induced liver injury is an impaired vitamin A nutritional status. Studies in human Hep G2 cells have shown that ethanol is cytotoxic to Hep G2 cells, which are transduced to express P-450 2E1 (CYP 2E1) and this toxicity is apoptotic in nature (Wu & Cederbaum, 1999) , predominantly in the liver. The main pathways for hepatic oxidation of ethanol to acetaldehyde involve alcohol dehydrogenase (Svensson et al., 1999) and are associated with the reduction of NAD+ to NADH (Lieber, 1997) . The magnitude of derangement of liver by disease or hepatotoxins is generally measured by the level of glutamate pyruvate transaminase (ALT), glutamate oxaloacetate transaminase (AST), alkaline phosphatase (ALP), bilirubin, albumin, and whole liver homogenate.",

Nearly 150 phytoconstituents from 101 plants are claimed to possess liver protecting activity (Doreswamy & Sharma, 1995) . At the same time, surprisingly, we do not have satisfactory plant drugs/formulations to treat severe liver diseases. Most of the studies on hepatoprotective plants are carried out using chemical-induced liver damage in rodents as models. A few excellent reviews have appeared on this subject in the recent past (Evans, Subramoniam, Rajashekaran, & Pushpangadan, 2002) . The extract from the rhizomes of R. emodi has shown significant hepatoprotective activity against CCl 4 -induced liver injury both in vitro and in vivo using 50 mg/kg, p.o.
