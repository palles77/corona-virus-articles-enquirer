            "text": "Studies were conducted to evaluate the feasibility of using canine herpesvirus (CHV) as a vaccine vector for bait-delivered oral vaccination of wild foxes. To test the viability of CHV in baits, CHV was freeze-dried, incorporated into different baits, stored, and the remaining viral infectivity tested in cell culture after varying periods of time at different storage temperatures. Experimental baits (mouse carcasses) and commercial baits (FOXOFF and PROBAIT) were prepared with either liquid or freeze-dried CHVand tested in two fox trials for their capacity to induce CHV-specific antibodies following oral baiting. Freezedrying and storage temperatures below 0 8C had a stabilizing effect to virus infectivity. When stored at \u00c020 8C, freeze-dried CHV retained its full infectivity for up to 3 months in PROBAIT baits, the remaining infectivity in FOXOFF baits was 100-fold less. Oral baiting with CHV induced antiviral serum antibodies in all vaccinated foxes (20/20). None of the vaccinated foxes became ill or shed infectious virus into the environment although viral DNA was detected in body secretions as evaluated by PCR. The results indicate that CHV can be freeze-dried and stored over extended periods of time without loosing much of its infectivity. This is the first report of CHV being used for oral bait vaccination of foxes. It appears that CHV is well suited for use as a recombinant vector for wild canids. #",

These vaccines have proven to be safe and highly effective in combating many important viral diseases of domestic dogs such as distemper, parvovirosis or rabies (Carmichael, 1999) . Rabies vaccines were successfully used also in wild canids, in particular foxes, coyotes and racoons, for which immunization via oral baits is the only practical, largescale method (Woldehiwet, 2002) . However, in addition to the well-known infectious epidemics, wildlife management is likely to face novel challenges in the future, for example, from newly emerging www.elsevier.com/locate/vetmic Veterinary Microbiology 114 (2006) [225] [226] [227] [228] [229] [230] [231] [232] [233] [234] [235] [236] [237] [238] [239] diseases such as severe acute respiratory syndrome among various wildlife species in China, Nippah virus epidemics in pigs in Malaysia or recent zoonotic avian influenza cases in South East Asia (Bengis et al., 2004; Daszak et al., 2001; Peiris et al., 2004; Audsley and Tannock, 2004) . Development of vaccines against such emerging infections will be time-consuming and costly, especially when conventional methods such as virus attenuation or inactivation are applied.",

            "text": "Overabundance of certain wildlife species is another challenge for wildlife management. Antifertility vaccination (also known as immunocontraception) is currently being developed in an attempt to address problems associated with overabundant wildlife such as foxes in Australia . Here, the overabundance of introduced European red foxes poses not only a major threat to the survival of endangered native fauna, but also considerably impacts on lamb production. Antifertility vaccination is particularly appealing for use in foxes because of its humane, non-lethal approach and the potential to reduce the size of pest animal populations by reducing recruitment rather than increasing mortality (for review see (Ferro, 2002) ). Research on antifertility vaccines is fundamentally different from the development of antiviral vaccines. The aim of antiviral vaccination is to confer protective immunity against a viral pathogen whereas the intention of antifertility vaccination is to cause an immune response in the vaccinated individual in a way that critical reproductive processes are interrupted. To elicit such immune responses, the antifertility vaccine needs to contain an antigen with contraceptive properties. This can be achieved by either manufacturing the vaccine using appropriate components derived from native proteins or from transgenic proteins that were harvested and purified from bacterial or fungal sources. A more widely used approach is the genetic manipulation of a live vaccine vector in which the antifertility component of the vaccine is supplied, for example, by a genetically engineered virus (Shellam, 1994) . Genetic engineering of suitable viral vectors has proven to be a successful method to overcome some of the shortcomings of conventional vaccine development (Jackson et al., 1998) . However, of all vaccines currently used in wildlife on a wide geographical scale only one has been developed using biotechnological genetic engineering. This vaccine is based on a genetically altered vaccinia virus that contains the immunogenic components of rabies virus (Brochier et al., 1991) . Unfortunately, the potential of vaccinia virus to indiscriminately infect a wide range of species including humans impedes its general use as a vaccine vector, for example, for applications such as antifertility vaccination of wildlife. It is for this reason that alternative, more species-specific vectors such as canine herpesvirus (CHV) or canine adenovirus (CAdV) are currently being researched.",

A number of biological criteria need to be considered that influence the choice of virus as a vaccine vector (Shellam, 1994; Boyle, 1994) . Among them are, for example, the speciesspecificity of the vector, the ability of the virus to disseminate within a population, the potential of preexisting population immunity to the vector, the intended route of immunization, and, most critically, the suitability of the vector genome to accommodate additional heterologous DNA without disruption of essential viral gene functions.

            "text": "Based on serological evidence, European red foxes appear to be susceptible to many viral infections commonly described in domestic dogs (Truyen et al., 1998; Garcelon et al., 1992) . With regards to the potential of these viruses as vaccine vectors for wild canids, however, very few appear to be suitable candidates. We have focused our attention on CHV as potential vaccine vector for wild foxes for several reasons: In a previous study we have shown that foxes can be experimentally infected with CHV which caused a long-lasting seropositivity in all foxes (Reubel et al., 2001) . Orally infected foxes did not shed CHV into the environment and transmission to in contact foxes was not observed. Although viral DNA was detected at the site of latency, the spinal ganglia of infected foxes, no reactivation of virus could be observed even after high dose corticosteroid treatment (Reubel et al., 2004) . In conjunction with this, antibody prevalence in domestic dog populations has been reported to reach up to 88% (Gaskell and Willoughby, 1999) , indicating that the chance of virus transmitting between foxes or from foxes to other canids is low. In contrast to the high seroprevalence in dogs, only a very low percentage of wild foxes that were investigated in Australia (T. Robinson, CSIRO SE, Canberra, Australia, personal communication) and parts of Europe (Truyen et al., 1998) had antibodies to CHV. This lack of population immunity against the vaccine vector may be of critical advantage over other potential canid viruses, such as CAdV which are common in foxes (Truyen et al., 1998; Garcelon et al., 1992; Riley et al., 2004) . Furthermore, it has previously been shown that the CHV genome is capable of accommodating heterologous transgenes from other pathogens such as rabies virus or Neospora caninum, and able to confer protective immunity in domestic dogs (Nishikawa et al., 2000; Xuan et al., 1998) . Finally, the development of a bacterial artificial chromosome system for CHV has recently been reported (Strive et al., 2005) . This system can be expected to greatly facilitate genetic manipulations of the viral genome, enabling quick modification of traits such as insertion of different antigens or removal of essential genes to generate replication defective, nondisseminating viruses.",

To increase the likelihood of foxes eating the baits, foxes were starved 24 h prior to the beginning of the baiting experiment. Foxes received one bait per day on 3 consecutive days. This procedure was repeated after 14 days. For the first 10 days the foxes were monitored daily for signs of clinical disease, and body temperatures and body weights were recorded on a regular base.

A variety of biological criteria need to be considered that influence the choice of virus as a vaccine vector (Shellam, 1994; Boyle, 1994) . Among them are for example the species-specificity of the vector, the potential of preexisting population immunity to the vector, and the intended route of immunization. For wildlife vaccines which are usually delivered perorally in baits, the stability of the virus at different environmental conditions and the suitability of the virus for freezedrying and incorporation into baits are of particular importance. Predictions of the in vivo efficacy of live antiviral vaccines can be made by determining the infectivity of the vaccine virus in cell culture in vitro (for review see (Terpstra and Kroese, 1996) ). We therefore explored in laboratory experiments suitable conditions for freeze-drying of CHV, and how various storage conditions or vaccine additives would affect the infectivity of the virus. Because CHV had not yet been used in a freeze-dried form for vaccination or as a component of oral baits, we also tested in fox trials whether peroral application of CHV-coated baits could induce antiviral antibody responses in the baited foxes.",

However, exposure of fd-CHV to FOXOFF bait over time was more detrimental to virus infectivity than exposure to PROBAIT bait matrix. The reasons for this difference were not established, but FOXOFF baits appear to have a higher moisture content than PROBAIT baits which may have been a contributing factor for the quicker virus inactivation in this bait. Temperature and moisture are known to be the most important factors affecting virus survival in the environment (Hurst et al., 1980) . It was therefore not surprising that temperatures above 0 8C destroyed the infectivity of fd-CHV in some baits within weeks. However, fd-CHV survived considerably longer in PROBAIT baits at those temperatures than in FOXOFF baits where the virus infectivity was completely lost within 1 month when stored at 20 8C, and within 3 months when stored at 4 8C. In contrast, there was still considerable amounts of infectious virus left in PROBAIT baits that were stored at 4 and 20 8C. Most importantly, fd-CHV did not loose any infectivity when stored at \u00c020 8C in PROBAIT baits for 3 months.

We showed for the first time that perorally or intranasally applied fd-CHV induced antiviral anti- Table 6 Detection of CHV DNA by real-time PCR in mouth/nose/eye secretions (A) and genital secretions (B) of foxes after baiting with FOXOFF or PROBAIT baits coated with freeze-dried CHV B, baiting days; +, positive; \u00c0, negative; ND, not done. body responses in 11/12 foxes. CHV was not pathogenic, and infectious CHV was not shed into the environment. Although manual administration of CHV to control foxes induced higher antibody titres than bait feeding, the results clearly warranted further investigations of CHV administration in baits.",

            "text": "The second fox trial focused on the use of two commercially available baits, FOXOFF and PRO-BAIT which were coated with fd-CHV. Foxes appeared to have a preference for PROBAIT baits compared to FOXOFF baits which was reflected both in the temporal uptake of the baits and in the overall numbers of baits taken. It was observed that foxes tended to cache FOXOFF baits for possible later consumption whereas PROBAIT baits were usually eaten soon after they were supplied. PROBAIT-baited foxes had higher average anti-CHV antibodies than foxes in the FOXOFF group. This could be explained by a higher intake of infectious CHV in the PROBAIT group which is more likely when the bait is eaten soon after distribution. Exposure of virus to the environment is expected to inactivate the virus over time and thus its potency to induce immune responses will be reduced. As in the first trial, none of the baited foxes became ill or shed infectious virus into the environment although CHV DNA was found in secretions of all foxes. After the first baiting, all mouth/nose/eye secretions were PCR positive for up to 7 days, but genital secretions were only occasionally positive. After the second baiting, viral DNA was detected in secretions of only two foxes. Eleven out of 12 foxes had seroconverted at this time (week 2 post vaccination), and it is likely that newly developed antiviral immunity prevented further viral replication and viral DNA shedding. Five of the six positive genital swabs were collected from male foxes. Previous studies have shown that systemic virus replication and viremia following oral CHV intake is unlikely (Reubel et al., 2001) . It seems rather probable that the PCR positivity of genital swabs was caused by the presence of CHV-containing saliva trough grooming and licking. It is noteworthy that fox 85221 ate none of the baits during the first baiting period, but seroconverted by week 3. It could be that by carrying the bait in the mouth for caching and possibly by licking on it, enough of fd-CHV was resorbed through the oral mucosa to cause an antiviral antibody response. Feeding of fd-CHV-coated baits induced anti-CHV antibodies in 12/12 foxes which corroborated the serological findings of the preliminary trial.",
