            "text": "By far and away the most important pulmonary diseases in humans are related to the smoking of tobacco. However, occupational lung diseases caused by inhalation of industrial chemicals, particulate matter and antigens are also important causes of morbidity and mortality. For this reason, considerable effort has been directed to the examination of airborne pollutants over recent years, including study of their effects in laboratory animals when administered by the inhalation route. Extensive study has shown that a complex array of defensive mechanisms protects the lung against the adverse effects of airborne substances and pathogenic organisms. Aerodynamic factors prevent access of particles larger than 10 \u03bcm diameter for these are deposited on the walls of the nasal passages. Particles measuring between 2 and 10 \u03bcm diameter tend to be trapped by the mucuscovered ciliated epithelium lining the bronchial tree and removed by mucociliary transport aided by the cough reflex. Smaller particles may reach the alveoli where they are ingested and transported by pulmonary macrophages. 1 So-called nanoparticles sized between 1 and 100 nm which exist in the environment as a result of dust storms, volcanic ash and other natural processes as well as a result of recent technological advancements appear to be less efficiently removed by pulmonary macrophage clearance than larger particles. 2 When inhaled these particles may translocate from the alveoli directly into the circulation. 3, 4 Some small inhaled particles reach the pleural cavity where they enter the lymphatic system via small round or oval openings from 2 to 10 \u03bcm diameter (stomata) in the parietal peritoneum. These stomata provide communication between the pleural space and the lymphatic vessels thus permitting the passage of cells, small particles and macromolecules into the lymphatic system. 5, 6 Consideration of airborne delivery to the lungs is also important in the development of therapies to be administered via the respiratory tract. While the inhalation route has been used for many years for volatile anesthetic gases, the respiratory tract is increasingly being employed for delivery of therapy. This is not only for asthma and other lung diseases but also for systemic delivery of polypeptides such as insulin and drugs to increase solubility, decrease immunogenicity and protect from excessive metabolism. 7 In contrast to the adverse pulmonary effects of cigarette smoke and industrial pollutants, therapeutic agents remain a relatively minor cause of pulmonary toxicity in humans although actual incidence is difficult to ascertain. However, drug-induced pulmonary disease appears to be an increasingly frequent clinical problem. The number of drugs associated with parenchymal pulmonary injury in humans continues to increase. In patients drug-induced pulmonary toxicity can occur through several mechanisms and take different forms. 8\u00c010 Through their specific pharmacological action drugs can produce excessive effects on bronchial caliber or pulmonary function. Acute lung injury often manifests as pulmonary edema. This may be the result of cardiogenic or non-cardiogenic changes. For example, cocaine is believed to produce pulmonary edema as a consequence of an effect on pulmonary cardiovascular function. 8 Cytokines may alter vascular permeability. Drugs mediate allergic reactions in the bronchi or lungs. They may also produce a variety of obscure, diffuse pulmonary alveolar conditions including a pulmonary syndrome resembling systemic lupus erythematosis. As the respiratory tract is a major route by which microorganisms gain entry into the body, opportunistic pulmonary infections with bacteria, viruses, fungi or protozoa are consequences of immunosuppression or broad-spectrum antibacterial therapy. As in other organs, drugs that disturb coagulation may precipitate pulmonary thromboembolism or hemorrhage. Localized lung lesions also result from accidental, diagnostic or therapeutic inhalation of xenobiotics. Mucociliary clearance is also sensitive to therapeutic agents that affect the secretion of mucus and fluid, ciliary activity and transport. 11 Treatment with antacids or histamine H 2 blockers can also increase the risk of pneumonia developing in patients in intensive care units through increasing gastric pH. This leads to an overgrowth of Gram-negative bacteria in the stomach and retrograde pharyngeal colonization. 12 Anticancer therapy appears to be one of the main causes of serious pulmonary toxicity in patients. Although it is difficult to characterize because of the confounding effects of the underlying disease process, it has been suggested that about 10% of patients receiving well-established anticancer drugs develop various forms of pulmonary toxicity. 8 Some newer antineoplastic therapies and biological agents may have a similar liability. 10,13\u00c015 Toxicity may be manifest as an early onset pulmonary edema or present after more than two months after therapy has been completed. 16 Bleomycin-induced toxicity is considered to be the typical form of late onset lung injury.",

Whereas there are two broad categories of rhinitis, allergic and non-allergic, drug-induced rhinitis is usually non-allergic in nature. 17 Although some causes are obscure, rhinitis medicamentosa denotes the inflammatory changes which occurs with persistent overuse of topical nasal decongestants. Aspirin and the non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs are examples of drugs that induce an acute inflammatory response in the nose probably via a mechanism involving the inhibition of cyclooxygenase-1. Clonidine, guanethidine and methyldopa are examples of \u03b1 and \u03b2 adrenergic antagonists that are believed to induce rhinitis through a neurogenic mechanism. 17 In preclinical safety studies, pathology of the respiratory system can be the result of intercurrent disease or be induced by drugs administered systemically by various routes. Intranasal or inhalation modes of therapy pose particular challenges in terms of the formulations and the technologies required to administer drug. The different anatomical and physiological characteristics of the airways also influence drug toxicity, disposition and metabolism. The development of drugs to be administered by inhalation or intranasal routes is particularly difficult because of the perceived risks of high local drug concentration in respiratory tissues and their use in potentially vulnerable patients with pulmonary disease. 18 ",

Site of deposition depends primarily on particle size, but variability in the sites of deposition occurs among different laboratory animal species and humans by virtue of the differences in the size and shape of the respiratory passages as well as breathing patterns. 21 In addition, there are different types of inhalers used in human therapy to consider: nebulizers, propellant-driven metered dose inhalers and dry powder inhalers. 22 The need to phase out ozone-depleting chlorofluorocarbons as propellants has also generated a need to assess new propellants and their impact on drug delivery. 7 The subsequent fate of inhaled particles depends not only on their size but also on their shape, chemical nature, and solubility in body fluids. Soluble substances are absorbed into the bloodstream and are removed by the pulmonary circulation. They may also undergo metabolism by enzymes present in the cell populations of the respiratory tract and reactive metabolites may cause local pulmonary damage. Insoluble, inert particles are removed primarily by the mucociliary transport system of the trachea and bronchi or through phagocytosis by macrophages. Overload of the lung by relatively inert, non-fibrous particles such as titanium dioxide or carbon black may impair alveolar macrophage-mediated particle clearance. 23 This may lead in turn to accumulation of dusts over time with eventual fibrotic and tumorigenic responses. 24 This has led to concerns that newer materials such as engineered long carbon nanotubes may accumulate in the lung and pleural cavity and induce inflammation and neoplasia. 25, 26 Unlike larger particles, it has been shown that nanosized particles are less easily phagocytized by macrophages and are less readily cleared from alveoli. 27 Nevertheless like larger particles effects of nanoparticles appear also to relate to levels of exposure, their chemistry, size, shape, state of agglomeration and electromagnetic properties. 2 Measurements of respiration rate, tidal volume, airway resistance, pulmonary gas exchange and the disposition of the inhaled substances have an important place in the evaluation of chemically induced lung damage in laboratory animals. 28, 29 Even though there are novel and very sensitive physiological methods for the characterization of edema following lung injury in rodents, light and electron microscopy of lung tissue sections provides vital qualitative evidence of the nature of any injury. 30 ",

As a consequence, regional nasal airflow and disposition patterns vary considerably and this influences the distribution of lesions produced by inhaled xenobiotics in the nasal cavity. 36 Comparison of the nasal cavity of rhesus monkey and humans using magnetic resonance imaging and nasal casts has shown that many similarities in structure exist between these two species. 37 The anterior nares are lined by stratified squamous epithelium. In other zones the sinuses are covered either by respiratory or olfactory epithelium with a zone of transitional epithelium at the junction between the two types. Respiratory epithelium is similar to that found elsewhere in the respiratory passages being composed of ciliated cells, serous and mucous cells, brush cells, intermediate cells and progenitor basal cells. It represents a cellular system engaged in mucociliary clearance carrying surface secretions to the nasopharynx to be cleared by swallowing. Although this epithelium is similar to that lining the other large airways, key differences are the particularly rich complement of secretory cells and the complex vasculature of the nose which can modulate capillary, arterial and venous blood flow through the mucosa. 38 Mucins may be particularly important. It has been postulated that they not only have a physical protective function but also possess antioxidant properties by virtue of the scavenging behavior of their high proportion of sugar groups. 39 The proportion of the nose lined by olfactory mucosa is variable between species being disposed over a much larger area in dogs and rodents than in primates. 32 However, it is structurally similar in humans and rodents. It is located in more dorsal or posterior regions of the nasal passages out of the direct line of airflow during normal respiration. Olfactory mucosa is a pseudostratified columnar epithelium composed of basal cells, sustentacular cells and sensory cells with mucus-secreting Bowman's glands situated in the lamina propria. Basal cells are composed of two distinct types, light and dark cells. The light type represents the primitive, stem cell population. Sustentacular or supporting cells are non-ciliated, columnar cells possessing microvilli that extend into the overlying layer of mucus.",

These are both situated in the posterior parts of the nasal cavity and composed of mucus-secreting cells. 40\u00c042 Immunocytochemical study using antisera against the major isoenzymes of rat hepatic microsomal cytochromes P450 induced by \u03b2-naphthoflavone, 3-methylcholanthrene, phenobarbitone and pregnenolone-16-\u03b1-carbonitrile as well as NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase, epoxide hydrolase and glutathione S-transferases B, C and E has shown their presence in rat nasal mucosal cells. 43 CYP2A enzymes appear to be expressed at high levels in the respiratory tract mucosa. 44\u00c048 This suggests that the nasal mucosa has a capacity not only for metabolizing and activating xenobiotics by oxidation, but also for hydration and inactivation of potentially toxic epoxides and conjugating electrophilic, reactive metabolites with reduced glutathione. It has been shown that the distribution of immune-reactive enzymes is different in olfactory and respiratory mucosa. 49 Xenobiotics can be metabolized within both olfactory and respiratory mucosa but the olfactory regions appear to possess greatest capability for oxidative metabolism. Consequently, regional differences in nasal toxicity and tumor formation from inhaled materials may be a response not only to different water solubility and deposition patterns but also differences in the formation of reactive metabolites. 49 Another feature of this metabolizing activity is that it can be induced by systemically administered xenobiotics and this can alter the distribution of enzyme activity in the nasal mucosa. 43 Studies of the mouse olfactory mucosa have shown that while typical hepatic inducers of CYP2A5 do not significantly change its expression, olfactory toxicants can alter the pattern of enzyme distribution. 46, 48 Like many other tissues exposed to external environmental agents, the nasal mucosa possesses aggregates of lymphoid tissue in the underlying lamina propria. In rats these areas, characterized by follicles containing both T and B cell areas, are located in the ventral aspects of the lateral walls of the nasal airways at the opening of the nasopharyngeal duct. 32, 50 Like the gut-associated lymphoid tissue, these nasal follicles have been shown in the rat to be covered by specialized epithelium with islands of cells with microvilli, socalled M or membranous cells. Little is known of any toxicity occurring in this tissue despite its strategic position in the respiratory tract. 51",

Although dissection is required, a similar procedure following decalcification can be adopted. High-resolution three-dimensional magnetic resonance imaging has also been used to characterize the dimensions of the nasal cavities of cynomolgus monkeys and map the distribution of lesions induced by inhaled xenobiotics. 58, 59 Examination of hematoxylin and eosin-stained sections remains paramount in the assessment of the nasal cavity, although special stains may be helpful. Examination of cytokeratin expression in the respiratory mucosa has been used as a marker of epithelial differentiation in the respiratory tract. 60 A test system that relates to the innervation of the nasal mucosa is that proposed by Alarie. 61 The trigeminal nerve endings in the nasal mucosa of mice mediate the response to sensory irritants and this can be measured by a decrease in respiratory rate. It has been shown that a good correlation exists between the decrease in respiration rate in mice exposed to airborne chemicals and the nasal irritancy potential of the chemicals in humans. 62 This enables the detection of airborne sensory irritants and the prediction of acceptable levels of exposure to the upper respiratory tract in people.",

While therapeutic agents administered by the inhalation route do not usually produce a severe degenerative or inflammatory response in the nasal mucosa, at least at therapeutic doses, the simple categories proposed by Hardisty and colleagues in recording of degenerative and reactive lesions following exposure to volatile chemicals are useful. 57 Categories suggested are: inflammation, degeneration, regeneration, atrophy (postdegenerative), respiratory metaplasia and basal cell hyperplasia. A far more detailed scheme along similar lines has been put forward in the context of the International Harmonization of Nomenclature and Diagnostic Criteria for Lesions in Rats and Mice (INHAND) project. 68 Degeneration is usually the earliest morphological change characterized by loss of sensory and sustentacular cells resulting in a thinner mucosa. Individual cell necrosis may be seen in more severe cases. Regeneration is characterized by proliferation of basal cells associated with an epithelium that loses its regular structural features. Post-degenerative atrophy usually follows severe damage and is characterized by loss of sensory and sustentacular cells. Respiratory metaplasia is a process whereby the normal olfactory mucosa is replaced by pseudostratified epithelium of respiratory type often with cilia. Basal cell hyperplasia represents a longer-term effect where the proliferating basal cells form a distinct layer of cells below the respiratory epithelium.",

Although the degree of histological changes varied with different agents, the changes were broadly similar in type and distribution. 69 Most agents examined produced little or no alteration in the squamous mucosa lining the anterior part of the nose apart from some mild increase in thickness of the squamous layers. Principal sites of damage were shown to be the anterior respiratory epithelium adjacent to the vestibule and the olfactory epithelium of the dorsal meatus. There was a distinct decrease in severity in posterior regions. Histologically, the lesions in respiratory epithelium ranged from mild loss of cilia and small areas of epithelial exfoliation to frank erosion, ulceration and necrosis of the epithelium and underlying tissues including bone. Variable polymorphonuclear cell infiltration was also found. In some cases, early squamous metaplasia developed on the free margins or the naso-maxillo-turbinates. Changes to the olfactory epithelium varied from focal to extensive loss of sensory cells associated with damage to sustentacular cells. In severe cases, complete loss of olfactory epithelium occurred. Although the degree of histological change was shown to vary with different agents, lesions induced by the more watersoluble chemicals tended to remain localized in the anterior part of the nasal cavity whereas agents with relatively low water solubility produced lung lesions in addition. It was suggested that these findings demonstrated the powerful 'scrubbing' action of the nasal cavity for water soluble, airborne xenobiotics. 70 Inflammatory alterations have been induced in the nasal cavity of rodents treated with therapeutic agents at high doses by inhalation. Significantly irritant substances do not make viable therapies but the precise relevance for humans of inflammatory changes that occur only at high exposures by the inhalation route is sometimes questionable.",

            "text": "In the case of tulobuterol, a \u03b2 2 adrenergic receptor agonist, it was argued that the nasal inflammation induced in rats in a one-month inhalation toxicity study was the result of a particularly high exposure of the nasal epithelium to drug, not representative of the likely human exposure to tulobuterol by inhalation, where little or no nasal exposure would occur. 71 RP73401 [3-(cyclopentyloxy)-N-(3,5-dichloro-4-pyridy)-4-methoxybenzamide], a novel type IV phosphodiesterase inhibitor which was being developed for the treatment of asthma and rheumatoid arthritis, was also reported to produce degeneration of the olfactory epithelium in rats but neither dogs nor mice after single and repeated oral doses and by inhalation. 72 Histologically, the olfactory epithelium showed necrosis of the superficial epithelial layers including the sustentacular and sensory cells with sparing of the basal cell layer. There was also damage to Bowman's glands. The development of proliferative lesions and ultimately tumors of principally neuroectodermal origin followed chronic treatment. As RP73401 was highly metabolized and the nasal lesions could be inhibited by treatment of rats with metyrapone, a non-specific inhibitor of cytochromes P450, it was postulated that the changes were the result of P450-mediated activation in the olfactory tissues, not linked to its pharmacological phosphodiesterase activity. 72 Nasal epithelial degeneration and necrosis has also been reported in both rats and dogs treated with another candidate anti-inflammatory drug CI-959 by the intranasal route. This agent effected olfactory epithelium more than respiratory mucosa suggesting that metabolism was important in the generation of this toxicity. 73 ",

            "text": "Although the nasal cavity is not routinely examined histologically in great detail in toxicity studies conducted on drugs administered orally or by parenteral routes, damage to the nasal mucosa can be induced by drugs administered by these routes. One example is methimazole, a thioureylene antithyroid drug used in clinical practice where oral doses of 0.2 to 2 mg/kg/day are employed and abnormalities of taste and smell have been described. 74 Administration of methimazole at relatively high doses to Long-Evans rats by single oral (50 mg/kg) or intraperitoneal (25 mg/kg) routes was shown to produce damage to the sustentacular and sensory cells with sparing of the basal cells and basement membrane. 75 Bowman's glands were also involved. Methimazole is metabolized by the flavin-containing monooxygenase system and it is employed as a model substrate for this enzyme in vitro. The presence of flavin-containing monooxygenase isoforms in olfactory mucosa of Long-Evans rats suggested that reactive intermediates may be responsible for the nasal toxicity. 75 Similar changes have been reported in mice where depletion of 214 6 . RESPIRATORY TRACT glutathione in the olfactory mucosa has been demonstrated, also suggesting formation of local reactive metabolites. 76 Histological examination has also shown that intravenous administration of a single dose of vincristine to mice damages the olfactory epithelium. 77, 78 Vincristine is a vinca alkaloid derivative used in cancer therapy which has antimitotic activity and binds to tubulin. Cell death was noted in olfactory cells two to five days after dosing with a peak of cell proliferation at five days and repair after about ten days. These features resemble those that can be seen in other proliferating tissues after single doses of antimitotic drugs. Rats and marmosets have been shown to be less sensitive to these effects of vincristine, probably as a consequence of drug disposition differences. 79 The risk of damage to human olfactory cells from agents with these effects in rat nasal mucosa often remains uncertain because of a lack of understanding of relative exposure and metabolism in different species and the metabolic potential of human olfactory mucosa.",

Tracheal cartilage rings may also show alterations in genetically engineered animals such as the C57BL/6J-TgN(C3-1-TAg) cJeg (TAg) mice that have generalized defects in cartilage development. 92 The larynx of rodents is also susceptible to the effect of inhaled substances, notably tobacco smoke but also pharmaceutical agents and propellants. 81, 93 In view of the localized nature of induced lesions in the larynx, standardized histological sectioning techniques have been proposed for rats, mice and hamsters using anatomical landmarks. 94\u00c097 The target site is located on the ventral floor of the larynx near the base of the epiglottis cranial to the ventral laryngeal diverticulum.

The larynx responds to inhaled irritants by inflammatory, degenerative and regenerative changes in a manner similar to other regions of the respiratory tract. These include disruption of the epithelial cells, inflammatory cell exudates and infiltration, goblet cell hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia. 93 Squamous metaplasia represents a common adaptive response to inhaled irritants of diverse types. 98 These changes are not specific to inhaled irritants but also occur as a response to natural respiratory tract pathogens in conventionally housed rats. 99 An international expert group concluded that in the context of inhalation exposure to non-genotoxic chemicals squamous metaplasia in the rodent larynx does not generally represent a pre-neoplastic lesion. 100 The pseudostratified ciliated and non-ciliated mucosa of the trachea may also show pathological alterations in inhalations studies, although sites at the bifurcation (carina) are those often first affected. Consequently, the carina should be systematically included in examination of the respiratory tract for induced lesions. 82, 97 Neoplasia As in the nasal passages a range of proliferative lesions including squamous hyperplasia, mucous cell hyperplasia, as well as papilloma, carcinoma and mesenchymal tumors are occasionally reported in the airways in laboratory rodents and large species. 68, 101 ",

The cytoplasm of ciliated cells contains scattered profiles of rough endoplasmic reticulum, a supranuclear Golgi and numerous mitochondria particularly near the apex where a prominent cytoskeleton is also found. Mucous or goblet cells represent about 10% of the bronchial mucosa cell population in humans but less than 1% in pathogen-free rats. 11 The serous cell is a cylindrical or pyramidal cell containing small, round, closely packed serous granules. 104 The mucus-secreting and ciliated cells form the cellular basis for the mucociliary clearance mechanism of the main conducting airways. The epithelium is covered by a mucous blanket that is fairly complete in humans and rabbits but patchier in rats. 11 A deficient mucous barrier, excessive mucus or defective clearance contributes to the pathogenesis of all the common airway diseases. 106 The mucous layer is segregated into an upper layer or gel phase separated from epithelial cells by a serous, periciliary layer. The depth of the periciliary layer is uniform throughout the conducting airways and is vital for mucociliary clearance. However, the superficial gel layer increases in thickness from the distal to proximal airways. 106 Normal mucus is over 90% water and about 3% of solid matter comprising mucins, other proteins, salts, lipids, and cellular debris. Mucins are large glycoproteins with regions rich in serine and threonine residues linked by their hydroxyl side groups to sugar chains. They are highly anionic because most of their terminal sugars contain carboxyl or sulfate groups. 106 The complex carbohydrates of the glycocalyx and secreted mucosubstances show species-related differences in their sugar residues, which can be demonstrated histochemically by the use of labeled lectins. 107 Pathological changes in mucus occur through its excessive production, infiltration by inflammatory cells or processes that alter its hydration and biochemical constituents, notably abnormalities in secretion of salt and water.",

Anesthetic gases, barbiturates, narcotics and alcohol depress clearance function. By contrast, topical, oral or parenteral administration of \u03b2 adrenergic agonists, isoprenaline and epinephrine (adrenalin), produce a dose-dependent stimulation of mucociliary transport by an effect on ciliary beat frequency, probably mediated by increasing levels of cyclic adenosine monophosphate in ciliated cells rather than through vascular changes. Although basal mucociliary function is dependent of normal vagal tone, parasympathomimetic agents can affect mucociliary transport. Acetylcholine and cholinergic agents stimulate ciliary activity whereas anticholinergic drugs, atropine and hyoscine, inhibit ciliary activity and mucociliary transport. These substances may alter deposition of inhaled particles in the lung. 11 Clara cells or non-ciliated bronchiolar cells located in the bronchiolar epithelium, first described by Clara in 1937, are small and cylindrical in shape with highly infolded nuclei, surface microvilli, well-developed Golgi, abundant smooth endoplasmic reticulum and characteristic oval, homogeneous electron-dense granules in the apical cytoplasm. In rats, rabbits and humans the granules are PAS positive, although they are usually considered PAS negative in hamster and mouse. 104 Clara cells have high metabolic activity. They contain cytochrome P450-dependent enzymes and secrete a variety of proteins. 108\u00c0110 Clara cell secretory protein is the major component of their cytoplasmic granules as well as surfactant proteins and they have been shown to produce mucin following antigen challenge. 110 In most laboratory rodents, the conducting airways terminate abruptly at the non-cartilaginous terminal bronchiole that opens directly into an alveolar-type airway, the alveolar duct which in turn communicates with the alveoli. 111 Squamous epithelial or type I cells form only about 10% of all lung cells but they line over 90% of the alveolar surface, by virtue of extremely long cytoplasmic extensions. The principal gas exchange takes place across this cell. In the rat, the typical thickness of this barrier is 20 nm for a cytoplasmic extension of a type I pneumocyte, 90 nm for basal lamina and 90 nm for an endothelial cell. 104 The type I cell contains juxtanuclear mitochondria and the long smooth cytoplasmic extensions contain many ribosomes and pinocytotic vesicles. The anatomical configuration and function of type I cells render them highly vulnerable to the adverse effects of inhaled gases and particles.",

The cell cytoplasm contains rough endoplasmic reticulum, Golgi apparatus, some mitochondria and characteristic oval, osmiophilic lamellar inclusions. Surfactant, a microaggregate of phospholipid and protein which modifies alveolar surface tension at low inflation volumes, is secreted by type II alveolar cells. Ultrastructural immunocytochemistry has shown the presence of surfactant apoproteins in the synthetic organelles and in the lamellar bodies of these cells, in agreement with the concept that the surfactant apoproteins are synthesized in the rough endoplasmic reticulum, glycosylated in the Golgi and are stored in lamellar bodies. 113 Type II cells are more resistant to the damaging effects of xenobiotics and unlike type I cells they retain the ability to undergo mitotic division. Following damage to type I cells, increased numbers of mitoses are evident in type II cells which results in the appearance of large undifferentiated epithelial cells which ultimately differentiate into type I and type II cells. 104 The lung also contains a dense neural network and a population of endocrine-like cells believed to be important in lung function. 114 These neurosecretory cells (Kultschitsky or APUD cells) are scattered sparsely in the epithelial surface of the larynx, trachea bronchi, bronchioles and alveoli. These cells are oval or cuboidal with oval nuclei, argyrophilic cytoplasm which electron microscopic examination shows to contain dense core granules. The role of neuroendocrine cells in the lung is uncertain but immunocytochemical study has shown them to contain a number of neuroendocrine substances including neuronespecific enolase, synaptophysin, chromogranin and a variety of other peptides similar to vasoactive intestinal peptide, bombesin, calcitonin, serotonin, leu-encephalin, \u03b2 endorphin and ACTH. 114, 115 Cells lining the bronchi, bronchioles and alveolar walls are capable of metabolizing xenobiotics. Immunocytochemical study of the rat lung has shown the presence of immune-reactive cytochromes P450, NADPH cytochrome P450 reductase, epoxide hydroxylase and glutathione S-transferase in bronchial epithelial cells, ciliated bronchiolar cells, Clara cells, type II and possibly type I pneumocytes. 43 Different cell populations contain different amounts of enzymes, Clara cells containing the greatest concentrations of the phenobarbitone-inducible isoenzyme of cytochrome P450, NADPH-cytochrome P450 reductase and epoxide hydrolase. Studies of microsomal enzyme activities suggest that lung tissue contains fewer P450 isoenzymes than liver, principally forms CYP1A1, CYP2B1, CYP3A2 and CYP4B1. 116 Whereas P450 enzyme activity is highly concentrated in specific cell types, overall microsomal enzyme activity is low compared with liver on the basis of microsomal protein weight. 116 ",

The morphology of BALT is a useful guide to the nature and degree of immune stimulus in the lung. BALT is organized in a way that is characteristic of other peripheral lymphoid organs. It is structurally similar in the laboratory rat, mouse, rabbit, guinea pig as well as in humans but its size and prominence is species and strain dependent as well as a function of the degree of antigenic stimulus. 119\u00c0121 In the rat, the BALT is composed of lymphoid aggregates or follicles located mostly between a bronchus and artery with a zone of lymphocytes situated immediately under the bronchial epithelium. As in other peripheral lymphoid tissue, BALT is organized into B and T cell zones but in no predetermined manner. Immunocytochemical staining has shown that B and T lymphocyte zones differ in location from one aggregate to another. There are about two T lymphocytes for every three B cells compared with a ratio of 2:5 in rat Peyer's particles. 122 The ratios may be different in other species. Quantitative observations of T cell subsets using monoclonal antibodies have also shown that rat BALT normally contains twice as many T helper as T suppressor/cytotoxic lymphocytes. 122 The T cells are confined to one or two discrete zones with a light scattering of T cells within the B cell zones and immediately under the bronchial epithelium. In common with lymph nodes, interdigitating cells are also found. The epithelium overlying BALT shows anatomical modifications. It is composed of ciliated and non-ciliated cells covered by microvilli.",

Rats, dogs and rabbits have a thin visceral pleura with blood supplied from the pulmonary circulation whereas in humans and pigs it is thicker with a blood supply from the bronchial (systemic) circulation. In all species the blood from the visceral pleura is drained by the pulmonary veins. 5 The visceral pleura is covered by a mesothelial cell layer which synthetizes a number of macromolecules including hyaluronan, surfactant, elastin and collagen. 5 There is a thin space between the visceral pleural layer and the parietal pleura lining the chest cavity. This space contains pleural fluid which is constantly being elaborated by subpleural capillaries with a contribution from mesothelial cells that secrete glycosaminoglycan. The fluid leaves the pleural cavity by virtue of stomata or lymphatic stomata situated in the caudal regions of the parietal pleura. These drain into the lymphatic vessels that reach the hilar, mediastianal and parasternal lymph nodes. 5, 6, 128 There has been renewed study of these stomata because of questions concerning the fate of and potential pathology produced by nanoparticles in the lungs. The stomata on the parietal pleural are 2 to over 10 \u03bcm in diameter and are found in association with accumulations of leukocytes, termed milky spots on the pleura. It appears that some inhaled particles reach the pleural fluid and drain into these stomata to eventually reach the hilar and other lymph nodes. It has been argued that long thin and durable fibers such as asbestos become impeded at these stomata thereby inducing localized inflammatory reactions, fibrosis and eventually neoplasia at these sites in the pleural cavity (see below). 25 ",

Nevertheless, studies in the normal Fischer 344 rat have shown that after exsanguination, wet lung weights show a close relationship to body weight and that dry weight of lungs consistently represents about 20% of the wet weights regardless of age or body weight. 129 An increase in wet weight over dry weight appears to be a good index of pulmonary edema. 30 Various methods of fixation have been employed although simple immersion fixation in formalin for conventional light microscopy has the virtue of simplicity and it avoids the risk of translocation or removal of exudates from airways and alveoli. Mixtures of formaldehyde, paraformaldehyde and glutaraldehyde are used in initial fixation for electron microscopy. 53 The best overall appreciation of lung architecture is achieved by instillation of fixative via the trachea under an appropriate constant pressure or by perfusion fixation of the pulmonary arteries that is less liable to dislodge intra-alveolar exudate. In a review of methods employed routinely in rodent toxicity studies, instillation of fixative via the trachea was the preferred method in most laboratories because its advantages were seen to outweigh its disadvantages. 95 The sampling procedure is an important aspect of histological examination of the bronchi and lungs, particularly those of large laboratory animals. The extent of histological sectioning in conventional toxicity studies should be modulated to take account of lesions found by macroscopic examination, the type of study and the nature of the test substance. The bronchi should be carefully sampled to allow assessment of any alterations in bronchial epithelium.",

Magnetic resonance imaging and micro-computed tomography have also been tried as techniques for the study of pulmonary disease in small animals allowing correlation with conventional pathology techniques. 132, 133 Conventional special stains for reticulin and collagen as well as PAS and alcian blue for mucins are helpful in the characterization of lung damage and changes to the respiratory epithelium. Immunocytochemistry and enzyme cytochemistry are also useful in the study of the heterogeneous cell population of the lung. Xenobiotic metabolizing activity can be studied both by enzyme cytochemical methods as well as by immunocytochemical techniques using antisera specific for pulmonary monooxygenases and related enzymes. 48 Important structural components, particularly collagen and laminin, can be studied both at light and ultrastructural level with immunocytochemical methods. 134 Cytokeratin immunocytochemistry can be used as a method for the characterization of changes to epithelial cells. 60 Clara cells can be localized by the presence of Clara cell secretory protein and ciliated cells by the presence of tubulin. 110 They can also be visualized using immunohistochemical staining using antibodies for other cell constituents notably surfactant proteins and cytochromes P450. 108, 135 Endocrine cells are visualized by immunocytochemistry using antibodies to general neuroendocrine markers such as chromogranin and synaptophysin or regulatory peptides. 114 Other useful antigens, which can be demonstrated in the lung, include surfactants, lysozyme, immunoglobulins and those of microorganisms that infect the lung. 136 Electron microscopy is particularly useful for the detailed characterization of injury to the cells of the alveolar epithelium and endothelium (Figure 6 .1).",

            "text": "Sequential histopathological examination of the lungs of laboratory animals following inoculation with respiratory tract pathogens has characterized the evolution of pathological changes produced by individual organisms. For instance, following inoculation with Mycoplasma pulmonis, one of the more important respiratory pathogens among laboratory rodents both Lewis and Fischer 344 rats were shown to develop upper and lower respiratory tract inflammation. In the Lewis strain this was characterized after 28 days by a variable acute inflammatory exudate in bronchi and bronchioles with focal bronchiectasis, inflammation and hyperplasia of the epithelium with a predominantly macrophage infiltration of the alveoli and alveolar walls. 65, 143 These changes were associated with marked hyperplasia of the bronchus-associated lymphoid tissue (BALT), which extended down the airways and blood vessels towards the periphery of the lungs. Although the lymphoid hyperplasia was also found in inoculated Fischer 344 rats, it was less marked and accompanied by little or no mucopurulent exudate or active inflammation of the bronchial walls. This disparity in response suggested that differences were related to the degree of lymphocyte activation in the two strains, an imbalance in regulation of lymphocyte proliferation in Lewis rats, or both. 143 Other studies have been conducted in both rats and mice infected with another important respiratory pathogen of laboratory rodents, the Sendai virus (parainfluenza type 1). Sequential studies showed that the initial damage to bronchial and bronchiolar epithelium is associated with polymorphonuclear and lymphocytic inflammation (bronchiolitis). Immunocytochemical and ultrastructural studies revealed the presence of viral antigen in the mucosa. 141 Hyperplastic and multinucleated syncytial epithelial cells develop in the hyperplastic terminal bronchiolar epithelium and the inflammatory process extended to involve peribronchial or peribronchiolar parenchyma with infiltration of alveolar walls by mononuclear cells, macrophages and neutrophils. A similar cell population accompanied by cell debris and edema fluid develops in air spaces. Pulmonary arteries show only minor involvement with inflammatory cells and focal reactive hyperplasia of the endothelium. Immunocytochemistry and ultrastructural examination suggested that virus replication takes place in alveolar type I and type II epithelial cells and macrophages but not in endothelial or interstitial cells of the alveolar septae. 144 It was shown that when repair occurs there may be residual distortion of bronchiolar and alveolar walls by collagen and hyperplastic cuboidal epithelium may line the thickened alveolar septa. Air spaces may also contain enlarged macrophages with pale vacuolated cytoplasm. 145 Strain differences in susceptibility have also been demonstrated to this virus. There is differential pulmonary interleukin 12 (IL-12) gene expression between virus-susceptible Brown Norway rats and resistant Fischer 344 rats, and IL-12 treatment provides protection from virus-induced chronic airway inflammation and remodeling. Moreover increased tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) expression has been shown to be an important regulatory factor in the development of Sendai virus-induced bronchiolar fibrosis in infected rats. 146 Virus-inoculated Brown Norway rats had increased TNF\u03b1 pulmonary mRNA levels and increased numbers of bronchiolar macrophages and fibroblasts expressing TNF\u03b1 protein compared with virus-inoculated Fischer 344 rats. 147 The Corona virus, which causes sialodacryoadenitis in many rat colonies, also produces lower respiratory tract inflammation. This is characterized by acute bronchitis and bronchiolitis with focal extension into lung parenchyma. Thickened edematous, hypercellular alveolar walls infiltrated by monocytic cells are found. 90 Immunocytochemistry has shown the presence of viral antigen in bronchial and bronchiolar epithelial cells. There is also 226 6. RESPIRATORY TRACT peribronchial lymphocytic infiltration and increased prominence of BALT. Ultimately complete resolution occurs.",

Canine adenovirus type 2, parainfluenza SV5, canine herpes virus, coronavirus and parvovirus have all been isolated from laboratory dogs developing respiratory disease. 148 The syndrome of visceral larva migrans also incites focal inflammation, granulomas and fibrosis in the lungs of species such as dog and primate in which parasites may be prevalent. The syndrome of visceral larva migrans is usually defined as that which results from the migration of nematode larvae into the viscera. It has been well described in the beagle dog lung where it results from the larvae of toxocara species or metastrongyloid nematodes. 149, 150 The precise identification of parasites is not always possible in tissue sections. Histological appearances of infested lungs are highly variable. Nematodes surrounded by granulomas and granulomatous inflammation, mostly in a subpleural location, may be visible in sections. In affected lungs there may be perivasculitis and active arteriolitis, bronchiolitis and peribronchiolitis. Pleural involvement by the inflammatory process can be marked, particularly in regions overlying granulomas. Scarring develops and pleural and subpleural fibrosis is frequently associated with epithelial hyperplasia and squamous metaplasia of the associated airways ( Figure 6 .2a). 150 The lesions may be sufficiently severe to resemble those induced by high doses of anticancer drugs such as bleomycin (see below). Pulmonary acariasis is a common infestation of many species of non-human primates caused by various species of the mite Pneumonyssus. Reproduction of the mites appears to take place in the terminal bronchioles. Pneumonyssus simicola is the recognized form found in rhesus monkeys. 151 Although it is most prevalent in wild caught primates, the disease is not easily eliminated during breeding in captivity. 152 Even when eliminated by ivemectin the lesions of chronic bronchiolitis, bronchiectasis and pigmentation may persist as an incidental finding. 153 As the mite can produce significant destructive pulmonary pathology and render animals susceptible to secondary pulmonary bacterial infections, it can disrupt or confound the interpretation of toxicity studies performed in primates. The lesions are located most frequently in cranial lobes and are characterized by the presence of bullae distending the pleural surface, parenchymal cysts, nodules and scar tissue. 151, 152 Histologically, there is a wide range of inflammatory activity. Fully developed lesions are characterized by granulomatous bronchiolitis and peribronchiolitis with involvement of immediately adjacent alveoli. Cystic lesions involving the bronchiolar walls develop around the parasites giving rise to the appearance of walled-off cysts composed of highly cellular granulation tissue, associated with neutrophils, lymphocytes, macrophages, multinucleated giant cells and various pigments (see below). In less active lesions, dilated, cystic airways with walls composed of thick bands of smooth muscle and lined by squamous or cuboidal epithelium are found.",

Both clinical and experimental evidence suggests that impaired cellular immunity is much more important as a predisposing factor than impaired humoral immunity. 154 As in humans, laboratory animals may have latent pneumocystis infection that becomes clinically evident following immunosuppression. It has been shown in the rat that chronic administration of various regimens of corticosteroids, low protein diets, cyclophosphamide and other immunosuppressive drugs with concomitant antibiotic administration to prevent other infections gives rise to typical pneumocystis pneumonia. 155 Rodents with genetically deficient cellular immunity also develop pneumocystis pneumonia. The importance of pneumocystis pneumonia in toxicology is that it can be considered as a sentinel of chronic immune depression.",

IL-2 is a glycoprotein lymphokine, molecular weight 15 kDa, which is normally produced by activated T cells and mediates immunoregulatory responses. It has been produced in large quantities by recombinant DNA technology for use in tumor immunotherapy. However, high doses have been associated with a number of adverse effects, notably the vascular leak syndrome, characterized clinically by pulmonary edema, pleural effusions and ascites. 157 The vascular leak syndrome has been reported in laboratory animals given high doses of this agent. Histological examination of the lungs of B6D2F mice developing this syndrome following administration of IL-2 showed infiltration of the alveolar walls with large lymphocytes and intra-alveolar proteinaceous exudate which contained large lymphocytes, macrophages and red blood cells. 158, 159 Pulmonary venules and arterioles showed the presence of lymphocytes attached to or lying beneath the endothelium, infiltrating vessel walls or in a perivascular location where they were accompanied by edema fluid or red blood cells. Similar, but less severe changes have been demonstrated in rats given IL-2. 158 In addition, treated rats showed an infiltration of pulmonary vasculature with eosinophils probably secondary to an eosinopoietic cytokine produced by IL-2-stimulated lymphocytes. Immunocytochemical evaluation of the lymphoid infiltrate in mice showed that most of the cells were Thy 1.2-positive (CD90) lymphocytes. Furthermore, co-administration of asialo GM1 (ganglio-n-tetrosyl-ceremide) with IL-2 not only abrogated the clinical signs but also reduced the number of asialo GM1-positive lymphocytes in the tissue sections.",

Immunocytochemical and detailed electron microscopic studies in rats have supported the concept that IL-2 induces cytotoxic vascular damage that is mediated both directly by lymphokine-activated killer cells and cytotoxic T lymphocytes with secondary release of inflammatory cytokines. 160 As in humans, severe chronic pulmonary inflammatory disease in laboratory animals may compromise pulmonary function and lead to secondary alterations in other organs.

            "text": "Inflammation with granulomas develops in the lungs of laboratory animals under a variety of different circumstances, which have been alluded to above. A common cause in rodents is granulomatous pulmonary inflammation resulting from aspiration of stomach contents or food particles (aspiration pneumonia). This is sporadically observed in aged rodents where it is associated with general ill-health, particularly resulting from pressure effects of large pituitary adenomas and subsequent disturbance of pharyngeal or laryngeal reflex mechanisms. 164 Histologically, the lungs show peribronchial and peribronchiolar granulomatous inflammation with macrophages and foreign body cells associated with fragments of refractive vegetable matter. The associated bronchial mucosa may also show reactive changes including goblet cell hyperplasia in long-standing cases. As dogs and primates are more liable to be infested by parasites, granulomatous inflammation in response to pulmonary larvae is more common in these species. However, tiny particles of inhaled food or plant materials may also be associated with foreign body granulomas in these species. 142 Pulmonary tuberculosis represents a potential problem among non-human primate colonies in view of its insidious onset and its liability for transmission from monkeys to humans. 165 Pathological findings are similar to those so well known in the human disease. The disease is characterized by the presence of granulomas in lung parenchyma and lymph nodes. In florid cases there may be caseation surrounded by epithelioid and multinucleated giant cells and variable numbers of lymphocytes, plasma cells and fibroblasts. Diffuse granulomatous pneumonia as a result of tuberculosis is also reported in nonhuman primates. Granulomatous pneumonitis is also produced in laboratory animals by the intravenous injection of bacille Calmette-Gue\u00b4rin (BCG). Twenty-eight days following intravenous injection of BCG, the lungs of C57B1/6 mice contained numerous granulomas composed of histiocytes and round cells which were surrounded by alveoli with thickened walls and associated with mild interstitial pneumonitis. 166 These histological changes were associated with an increase in the number of Thy 1.2-positive (CD90) cells, especially Lyt-1 (CD5) positive lymphocytes. The histological changes were abrogated by treatment with cyclosporin A suggesting an important role for CD5-positive lymphocytes in the development of the granulomas.",

One comparative study of the response to dusts between rats and humans suggested that although rats develop greater intra-alveolar inflammation and alveolar hyperplasia than humans the relative ranking of the fibrotic response is the same in both species. 176 Regardless of the inciting agent, the fibrogenic process appears to be generally characterized by disruption of the normal alveolar\u00c0capillary structure, leakage of exudate from the vascular compartment into the airspaces, subsequent invasion by inflammatory cells and fibroblasts associated with excess matrix formation. Studies in laboratory animals with different fibrogenic agents as well as in humans have suggested that central to pulmonary fibrogenesis increased production of tumor necrosis factor \u03b1 (TNF\u03b1) by macrophages. 23, 146 ,177\u00c0179 This cytokine is not only a mitogen for fibroblasts but also a potent activator and chemo-attractant for macrophages, capable of stimulating release of other cytokines and inducing expression of adhesion molecule expression on endothelial cells.

This form of fibrosis tends to present more than two months after therapy has commenced. 16 Bleomycin, a glycopeptide preparation derived from Streptomyces verticillus, is the best known example but pulmonary fibrosis is also associated with the clinical use of a number of other anticancer agents including 1,3-bis-(2-chloroethyl)-1-nitrosourea (BCNU or carmustine), busulfan, mitomycin C and methotrexate as well as some of the newer agents. 8, 10, 16, 137 ,181\u00c0184 Therapeutic use of cyclophosphamide is also occasionally associated with the development of pulmonary interstitial fibrosis. 182, 183 Cyclophosphamide appears to be associated with two forms of pathology: an early onset pneumonitis and a late onset progressive pulmonary fibrosis. 183 The precise mechanisms involved in the induction of pulmonary fibrosis by antineoplastic drugs in humans are poorly understood. The true incidence for a particular drug is difficult to estimate because of confounding factors in cancer patients, such as concomitant administration of several drugs, radiation and oxygen therapy, diffuse pulmonary cancer and opportunistic infections. It is probable that drug-induced fibrosis is accentuated by concomitant administration of several antineoplastic agents, radiation therapy, hyperoxia, pre-existing pulmonary damage and age of the patient. Severity is often related to total dose of drug received. 137 Novel antineoplastic drugs may also produce this form of lung toxicity. 10 The iodinated benzofuran derivative amiodarone, a highly effective drug used in the treatment of cardiac arrhythmia, is an example of a non-cancer drug that has been associated with pulmonary fibrosis in patients although its etiology is clouded by the presence of systemic phospholipidosis (see below). However, it has been suggested based on clinical\u00c0pathological correlation that patients affected by treatment with amiodarone can be separated into two categories. One group are those with dyspnoea alone which correlates with the presence of foam cells or phospholipidosis. The second group of individuals are those with major changes in pulmonary function characterized by alterations in chest radiographs, a decline in diffusion capacity for carbon monoxide, vital capacity or total lung capacity. It is this latter group that shows pulmonary fibrosis as well as type II cell hyperplasia. 185 The bronchiolitis, alveolar septal inflammation and fibrosis induced by gold therapy in patients with rheumatoid arthritis is a distinctive syndrome characterized by presence of fever or skin rash, lymphocytosis in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid and alveolar opacities along the bronchovascular bundles on chest imaging studies. 186 It is probably immune mediated. This condition may be associated with peripheral eosinophilia and other druginduced alterations to the immune system. 174 ",

However, the histopathological appearances of bleomycin-induced pulmonary fibrosis in patients are in many instances different from those seen in laboratory animals because the lungs of patients treated with beomycin are modified by the primary neoplastic disease, smoking, multiple drugs, radiation therapy and secondary pulmonary infections, interstitial pneumonitis and fibrosis. 187 It has been postulated that TNF\u03b1 is an important mediator in the development of bleomycin-induced fibrosis. 178 In the preclinical evaluation of bleomycin beagle dogs were given cycles of drug by the intravenous route for periods of up to 26 weeks. 188 Dogs developed anorexia, weight loss, a variety of epithelial lesions as well as focal interstitial pneumonia and fibrosis. The focal lung lesions were characterized by increased elastic fibers, reticulin, collagen and acid mucosubstances. The lesions were situated predominantly in the pleural and subpleural zones, suggestive of a potentiating effect of friction between the pleural surfaces. Histologically the lesions resembled those produced by larvae migrans in the dog (Figure 6.2a) .",

Early changes include mild, diffuse increases in interstitial lymphocytes, macrophages, polymorphonuclear cells and perivascular or interstitial edema. After about a week, interstitial infiltrates also comprise fibroblasts with early collagen deposition, associated with proliferation of macrophages and type II pneumocytes. 189, 190 Subsequently, the amount of interstitial collagen increases, with eventual scarring and collapse of lung tissue in proportion to the cumulative dose given. 191 Immunohistochemical and ultrastructural study of rats and mice treated with bleomycin shows a large accumulation of immune-reactive laminin and reduplication of the basement lamina within the thickened alveolar walls. 192 In bleomycin-treated rats three-dimensional scanning electron microscopy shows drug-induced capillary remodeling comprising irregular alveolar and pleural capillaries with increased diameter and decreased branching. 193 Certain strains of mice have been shown to possess greater sensitivity to bleomycin fibrogenesis. The C57BL/6 strain produces a greater fibroblastic response than DBA/2 and Swiss mice and the BALB/C strain demonstrates a particularly poor fibroblastic response. 194 Changes similar to those reported in patients with cyclophosphamide, an anticancer alkylating agent have been less easy to reproduce in laboratory animals. When mice were sequentially examined for periods of up to one year after a single intravenous dose of 100 mg/kg of cyclophosphamide, only slight pulmonary interstitial thickening and hypercellularity was observed in association with progressive multifocal accumulation of intra-alveolar macrophages. 195 However, these changes were also accompanied by a progressive increase in pulmonary hydroxyproline content and a decrease in pulmonary compliance with time in treated animals compared with controls. The changes were amplified by exposure to 70% ambient oxygen.",

Although phospholipidosis is more likely to occur at high doses employed in toxicity studies than at lower therapeutic doses used in patients, it has been suggested that this may be offset by faster elimination of the drug, characteristic of small laboratory animals. 210 The potential for drugs to accumulate in critical tissues such as eye and heart is especially important when drugs are administered for long periods of time particularly as tissue/plasma ratios of some amphiphilic drugs may exceed 100, following repeated administration. 238 Consequently, although phospholipidosis may not have direct functional consequences, any implications for humans of drugs that induce phospholipidosis in laboratory animals can only be appropriately assessed on a case-by-case basis, with due consideration of mechanism, drug disposition and clinical risk\u00c0benefit analysis.",

A similar effect seems to have been produced in rats by Elmiron s , a semi-synthetic heparin-like macromolecular carbohydrate derivative, chemically and structurally similar to glycosaminoglycans used clinically for anticoagulant effects and interstitial nephritis. 242 Hook reviewed other agents such as oxidant gases and insoluble particles including silica that can also increase phospholipid levels and histological appearances that resemble those seen in systemic phospholipidosis. 243 Some of these agents inhibit phospholipid catabolism in the lungs giving rise to accumulation of surfactant protein A and surfactant lipoproteins and a clinical and pathological picture similar to pulmonary alveolar proteinosis in humans. Foamy macrophages associated with inhaled silica in the rat appear to be sparser than those in drug-induced phospholipidosis. 68 Studies from humans with pulmonary alveolar proteinosis have shown that three clinically distinct forms of this condition occur: congenital, secondary or acquired. The congenital disease is caused by a diverse range of mutations in the genes encoding surfactant proteins or the \u03b2 c chain of the receptor of granulocyte\u00c0monocyte colony stimulating factor (GM-CSF). The secondary form occurs in association with conditions where there is functional impairment or reduced numbers of alveolar macrophages such as in hematological cancers, following immune suppression or inhalation of silica or toxic fumes. Acquired or idiopathic alveolar proteinosis that accounts for over 90% of all cases (0.37 per 100,000 persons) has been an enigma until recently. Patients are at risk from infections, particularly nocardia, and the five-year survival rate appears to be about 75%. Studies from transgenic mouse models and in humans have shown that autoantibodies against GM-CSF are important in the development of the acquired form of the disease as this antibody causes a defect in macrophage function which impairs the catabolism of surfactant lipids and proteins. 244, 245 Eosinophilic inclusions",

Electron microscopy shows no evidence of cell degeneration or adverse effects on Clara cells. Although the reason for increase in these secretary products in Clara cells following treatment with corticosteroids is unclear, they appear to have no pathological significance. Goblet cell hyperplasia is a well-recognized response of the mucosa of conducting airways to chronic inflammation and inhalation of irritant substances such as cigarette smoke and sulfur dioxide. 84, 93, 246, 247 The degree of goblet cell hyperplasia is dictated by the severity and duration of the irritation or inflammatory process. Florid cases of goblet cell hyperplasia are characterized by thickening and pseudostratification of the tracheal or bronchial mucosa by a population of tall, mucus secreting cells with abundant pale cytoplasm. In addition, goblet cells extend further down the airways than in normal animals and mucus may fill or distend the airways or impact in the alveoli. In less florid cases, a simple increase in the number of goblet cells may be found without other structural change. 93 Goblet cell hyperplasia of the lining epithelium may be accompanied by an increase in size of the underlying submucosal glands. This has clearly been demonstrated in patients with chronic bronchitis and in rats where submucosal glands are normally quite prominent. 246, 248 Species differences may exist because the airways of laboratory animals are variably endowed with goblet cells and submucosal mucous glands. The normal rat has more goblet cells lining the airways than either mouse or hamster. 246 The factors controlling these alterations are uncertain but is has been long suggested that increased mitotic activity as well as cell conversion, probably by metaplasia of serous or Clara cells to mucous cells is involved. 249 It has more recently been shown in mice sensitized to ovalbumin and subject to a single antigen challenge by aerosol that Clara cells in the proximal airways show great plasticity and become mucin-secreting cells. 110 Pharmacological agents can induce goblet or mucous cell hyperplasia. Rats given six or 12 daily injections of isoprenaline, a non-selective \u03b2 receptor agonist, showed a dose and time-dependent increase in the number and size of alcian blue-positive goblet (mucous) cells as well as serous cells in the tracheal and bronchial mucosa. This was associated with an increase in length, width and depth of submucosal glands. 250 Similar changes were produced by pilocarpine. Both alcian blue and PAS positive cells were increased in number following administration of this agent, suggesting that pilocarpine induced both acid and neutral glycoprotein secretion. Comparison of the distribution of these changes in the rat following isoprenaline, with those of salbutamol, pilocarpine and tobacco smoke, showed that there were regional differences in the distribution of these changes in the airways. 251 Isoprenaline produced a greater increase in secretory cells in peripheral airways than tobacco smoke which itself produces a greater increase in mitotic activity. Isoprenaline and pilocarpine produced a more diffuse change than the more selective \u03b2 agonist, salbutamol. The changes induced by these therapeutic agents are presumably the result of their pharmacological activity. 251 Sturgess and Reid showed that the changes in the rat were accompanied by hypertrophy of the pancreas, submaxillary and parotid salivary glands. 250 (See Digestive System, Chapter 8.)",

It may be related to improved diagnosis of peripheral tumors, an increasing proportion of ex-smokers or changes in cigarette composition favoring greater exposure of the lung periphery to inhaled carcinogens. 265 Some of the most aggressive subtypes are small and large cell neuroendocrine lung cancers, defined as small or large tumor cells with greater than ten mitoses per two square mm (10 high power microscopic fields). 265 These seem to be seen almost exclusively in heavy cigarette smokers. Bronchogenic carcinoma and malignant mesothelioma have also been linked to exposure to asbestos fibers. The less carcinogenic serpentine fibers (e.g. chrysotile) are curly stranded structures, whereas the more potent are the amphiboles (e.g. crocidolite, amosite, tremolite) which have straight, rod-like fibers. 266 In contrast to findings in people, squamous cell lung tumors are only occasionally seen arising spontaneously in laboratory animals. Even laboratory animals, rats, mice, hamster, monkeys and dogs exposed to tobacco smoke for long periods and at high doses fail to develop significant increases in lung tumors. 267, 268 While some have argued that pulmonary proliferative changes seen in rodents exposed to tobacco smoke correlate with human tobacco-induced cancer, these rodent lesions are quite different from those seen in people. 269 Moreover, there is no good experimental model for neuroendocrine lung cancer linked to smoking that has such a poor prognosis in patients.

They usually compress surrounding tissues without infiltration or metastatic spread (adenoma) although loss of differentiation, infiltration and spread to adjacent tissues can occur (adenocarcinoma). Ultrastructural study of bronchiolar-alveolar neoplasia in Fischer 344 rats has shown the presence of osmiophilic, lamellated inclusion bodies similar to those found in alveolar type II cells. Therefore it has been suggested that the neoplasms may be derived from this cell type. 272 Bronchiolar-alveolar adenomas and carcinomas are usually considered together in the evaluation of carcinogenicity. 273 Pulmonary squamous carcinoma occurs but is a very uncommon spontaneous neoplasm in the rat. 82 The large proliferative but benign cystic lesions found in the lungs of rats following accumulation of large amount of particulate matter have been termed pulmonary cystic keratinizing epitheliomas for they have been regarded as benign neoplasms. When these lesions show evidence of tissue invasion they are regarded as pulmonary squamous cell carcinomas. Similar lesions are very occasionally reported as spontaneous lesions. 274 ",

On the basis of sequential light and electron microscopic study of pulmonary adenomas induced in Bagg-Webster Swiss mice by transplacental exposure to ethylnitrosourea, it has been suggested that they develop from either alveolar type II cells or Clara cells. 281, 282 Careful, stepwise analysis using light microscopic and electron microscopic examination has suggested that adenomas can be divided into three principal groups. Some are composed of solid growths of uniform cuboidal cells with expanding margins limited to alveolar septae (alveolar pattern). These cells contained concentrically arranged cytoplasmic lamellar bodies and abundant, large mitochondria similar to mitochondria found in alveolar type II cells. Tubular or papillary patterns are composed of cuboidal cells showing histological and ultrastructural features of Clara cell differentiation. 281 However, immunocytochemical studies of chemically induced and spontaneous pulmonary neoplasia in B6C3F1, BALB/c or A strain mice have shown that the majority of adenocarcinomas, including those showing papillary patterns, contain surfactant apoprotein, typical of type II antigens suggesting that most neoplasms show alveolar type II differentiation. 283 However, in view of the plasticity of Clara cells, this does not exclude a Clara cell origin of the tumors. Immunocytochemistry of specific Clara cell secretory protein expression in a transgenic mouse model of lung carcinomas developing from Clara cells has shown that the protein is lost during tumor cell progression. 284 It has also been shown in strain A mice that the proportion of tumors with papillary and solid/alveolar growth patterns varies with the inducing agent. 285 This also suggests biological differences exist between histological subtypes.",

In the analysis of group differences, consideration needs to be given to tissue sampling procedure, age standardization, historical control incidence, effects on food intake as well as the results of mutagenicity studies and carcinogenicity bioassays in other rodent species. Indeed, a considerable number of widely employed therapeutic agents of different classes have produced an increase in benign or malignant pulmonary tumors in carcinogenicity studies performed in mice without this proving of any significance to humans. Davies and Monro counted at least 17 drugs in the 1994 Physicians' Desk Reference of the United States. 288 In the two-year rodent carcinogenicity studies conducted in the National Toxicology Progam, the lung is second to the liver as the most common site of neoplasia in male and female mice and common in female rats. 270 One example of the difficulties is the carcinogenicity bioassay in which CF1 mice were treated for 80 weeks with the synthetic analgesic tilidine fumarate. Here a statistically significant difference (p , 0.01) was reported in the incidence of lung adenocarcinomas between the top dose female group (24%) and concurrent controls (10%). 289 It was argued that group differences did not indicate tumorigenic potential of tilidine fumarate on the basis that the incidence in the high dose group was within the historical control range (27%) and that there was no tumorigenic effect in the parallel 104-week rat carcinogenicity study.",

It was argued that the risk to human patients was slight because the increase in prevalence in pulmonary tumors was likely to be a result of changes in nutritional status of the mice through the effect of metronidazole on gut flora, as similar differences could occur between ad libitum-fed mice and those fed the same but restricted diet. 291 It was also postulated that the positive findings in bacterial mutagenesis assays were an inherent part of the antibacterial activity of metronidazole as a result of nitroreduction that does not occur in normal mammalian tissues. This conclusion was supported by negative effects in hamster carcinogenicity bioassays as well as lack of excess cancer risk in women followed up for 10 years or more. 291 ",
