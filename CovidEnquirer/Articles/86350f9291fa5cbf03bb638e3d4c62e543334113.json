            "text": "The common cold has intrigued physicians and the general public for centuries. It has been defined as an acute epidemic respiratory disease characterized by mild coryza1 symptoms of rhinorrhea, nasal obstruction, and sneezing. The nasal discharge is usually copious and thin during the first 2 days of illness, then it generally becomes more viscous and purulent.ZZ The disease is self-limited. Symptoms may persist for 2 days to more than 14 days; however, the cold may abort after only 1 day. Fever, cough, sore throat, or lacrimation may or may not be present. The common cold is of itself harmless, but bacterial invasion frequently follows the initial infection. It is these secondary invaders that may produce disorders of serious consequence.",

About half the population gets at least one cold every year.5 Colds account for 40% of all time lost from jobs among employed people (23 million days of work per year) and about 30% of absenteeism from schools (26 million school days per year). Estimates vary, but the average preschool child has somewhere between 4 and 10 colds per year, and the average adult has about two to four colds per year. The actual cost of caring for patients with colds in US physicians' offices is estimated to be $1.5 billion annually. 64 Seasonal patterns of infection can be identified for some of the various types of viruses that are responsible for outbreaks of the common cold. For example, available epidemiologic data suggest early fall and late spring are the most common times to find more outbreaks of rhinovirus. Respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) tends to follow winter and spring incidence, with a peak number of cases found mainly in January. Parainfluenza types 1 and 2 seem to peak during the autumn, whereas parainfluenza type 3 has an increased incidence during the late spring. Adenoviruses and coronaviruses tend to produce epidemics during the winter and spring (Fig. 1) .",

This gives place to itching, tickling, or stinging sensations, followed by paroxysms of sneezing, copious flow of serum and mucus from the nostrils, suffusion of the eyes, lacrimation, flushed countenance, and possibly sensations of constriction over the eyes in the frontal sinuses and headache. The patient is put to bed and the bowels relaxed if necessary. When the temperature is high it is reduced with anti-pyrin or one of its efficient substitutes, and the pain and other distressing symptoms are relieved by the coryza tablets containing a combination of morphia, atropia, and caffeine in the proportion of one-twelfth grain of morphia with one-six hundredth grain of atropia and one-sixth grain of caffeine. The morphia relieves the pain and nervous irritability, surpresses the excessive secretions and stimulates the circulation; the atropia elevates the tone of the blood vessels, quickens the pulse, decreases all the secretions except the urine, stimulates the respiratory center and counteracts the constipating effect of the morphia; and the caffeine stimulates the nervous centers and the kidneys and diminishes the tendency of the morphia to produce nausea. The sneezing and nasal discharge cease, the nostrils open up, and the pain disappear^.^ By 1930 an infectious cause for the common cold was being considered.

After this brief contact with the outside world, the community became totally isolated for the remaining 8 months of the year. The incidence of common colds in the city of Longyear was one attack per person per year. Local history proved that epidemics of the common cold would never break out before the ships started to arrive each summer. In 1931 the first boat arriving in May had only one seaman who had symptoms suggestive of the incubating stage of a fresh common cold. Two men on the ship's crew had recovered from a recent attack of a cold in the week before arriving. Forty-eight hours after the arrival of the boat three cases of common cold developed in the town. There had been no common colds in the 3 months preceding the arrival of the first boat.

He reported that the virus in some experimental colds was present not only in the nasal discharge of the patient with a fully developed cold but also in nasal washings obtained during the incubation period. The most successful means of viral spread is transmission of infectious mucous secretions to the iingers and hands and subsequently to the nose or eyes of a susceptible recipient. This finding has been reported in numerous studies during the past 20 years.63 Most respiratory viruses produce reinfection after re-exposure. Subsequent infections with the same or similar agents are generally more mild and last shorter periods.56 Risks factors for increased rates of infections and increased severity of disease include young age, low birth weight, prematurity, chronic disease, congenital immunodeficiency disorders, malnutrition, crowding, the presence of large numbers of susceptible people in the community, and exposure of the child to other infected persons. Rhinoviral infections are spread from person to person by virus-contaminated respiratory secretions. Possible routes for spread are inhalation of small airborne particles, inhalation or impaction of large particles transmitted over a short distance, and contact directly or indirectly via contaminated environmental objects. Although all three routes probably are involved to some extent, the most likely is direct contact. 24 In a series of studies with experimental infections Gwaltney and HendleyZ6 showed the feasibility of contact transmission. Persons with high concentration of virus in their respiratory secretions exhibited a propensity for contamination of their hands and environmental objects with the virus. Rhinovirus was recovered from 40% to 90% of hands of persons with colds and from 6% to 15% of environmental objects such as doorknobs and coffee cups. Rhinoviruses were shown to exhibit good survival on many environmental surfaces for hours, and infections were transmitted readily by finger contact with a contaminated object and then back to the eye or nasal m u c o~a .~~",

The surface cells loosen and begin to slough off. A necrotic zone then develops next to the surface cells. This may extend deeper into the submucosal layer. The entire epithelium finally disintegrates. Later in the disease the cells begin to regenerate, starting with those nearest the basement membrane and then gradually replacing cells layer by layer. 31 Bardin et al* reported much later on several studies of the histologic appearance of nasal mucosa infected by rhinoviruses and other respiratory viruses.

He also showed increased numbers of lymphocytes in nasal secretions during rhinoviral infections. It is possible that the decrease in circulating T lymphocytes may be related to increased levels of interferon. Lymphocytes release cytokines that are involved intimately in the inflammatory process. The production of cytokines by viruses and T lymphocytes may be one of the major influences on airway inflammation. In elegant studies by Hsia, human peripheral blood cells were incubated with rhinovirus. The cellular immune response was evaluated by measuring the production of interleukin-2. Interleukin-2 increased by a factor of four and was related inversely to the duration of virus shedding but was unrelated to total symptom scores and to convalescent antibody titers. Interleukin-2 may play a major role in the duration of viral shedding, and further studies may implicate cytokines produced by lymphocytic activation.",

Except for rhinoviruses, the common cold is only one of the patterns of illness that a particular virus can cause. The symptoms most prevalent in patients with the common cold, in order of prevalence, are throat clearing, nasal obstruction, nasal discharge, cough, and postnasal drip.I5 These symptoms often are found in association with sneezing, sore throat, drowsiness, weakness, dry mouth, and dizziness. In a study by Curley et al,I5 sore throat, sneezing, and drowsiness were found to have decreased significantly by day 2 or 3 of the illness. Cough, nasal discharge, postnasal drip, and throat clearing frequently still were present on day 14 after onset. In young children, RSV and parainfluenza viruses cause cough by direct invasion of the lower respiratory tract. These same viruses cause cough in older children and adults indirectly by stimulation of the upper respiratory tract. Coronaviruses produce a syndrome that is typical of the common cold but are more likely to produce myalgias, headaches, and general malaise than rhinoviruses or RSVs. Like the parainfluenza viruses, coronaviruses commonly will produce a bit more fever than the rhinoviruses and the RSVs. Adenoviruses are well known to produce a syndrome similar to the common cold but much more commonly produce conjunctivitis and laryngitis as part of the syndrome. Adenovirus types 3 and 7 cause pharyngoconjunctival fever distinguished by severe conjunctivitis and pharyngitis with minor contribution of other cold symptoms. Pharyngoconjunctival fever most often is found in summer when people are swimming in lakes and other nonchlorinated pools. The echoviruses and coxsackieviruses can produce coryza alone, an acute episode of rhinitis with minimal other symptoms. This is a summer disease also. Table 2 presents the major symptoms of common cold by the frequency with which they are associated with each virus type.",

Nucleic acid hybridization has only modest sensitivity, requiring as many as lo5 molecules for identification.

            "text": "Many elegant studies such as Gwaltney and Hendley'sZ6 show that iodine or phenol/alcohol disinfectants can interrupt transmission of rhinoviral infections. Coxsackievirus type A 21 was shown to be transmittable from one end of a long room to the other, suggesting that coxsackievirus is carried in small, airborne droplets that can be inhaled onto the nasal mucosa. Numerous studies have shown that the use of virucidal impregnated nasal tissues can reduce the transmission of cold viruses significantly.20 The difficulty of consistently using tissues impregnated with a virucidal chemical is obvious, particularly with small children.",

            "text": "The traditional approach to preventing infection has been vaccination. Influenza vaccine has been used since the 1940s. The large number of serotypes of rhinovirus plus other respiratory viruses make vaccine development difficult. A major problem with developing a vaccine to the cold viruses is that durable immunity to the respiratory viral infections is difficult to produce. Parenteral immunization does not produce much nasal secretion of antibodies and provides little or no protection against a challenging virus. Even with influenza vaccine it is known that the immunity, although high initially, is lost after only 3 or 4 months.",

            "text": "Considerable effort has been expended in recent years to produce a form of interferon that is safe and effective. Interferon has been shown in several studies to produce good protection against infection. The high doses necessary to produce a prophylactic effect were associated with serious undesirable side effects, including nasal stuffiness, bloody mucus, and mucosal erosions. Some viruses replicate well at low temperatures and poorly at higher temperatures. Mande1147 reasoned that because elevated body temperature is a nearly universal manifestation of infection, perhaps the increased body temperature affects phagocytosis of bacteria or viruses. Carmichael et all0 inoculated puppies with canine herpes virus. Most puppies survived the almost universally fatal infection when they were kept at elevated temperatures for several days after the inoculation. Reducing fever with antipyretics may be a counterproductive effort. Treatment with aspirin might be useful in preventing infection by cold viruses, but aspirin, acetaminophen, and other nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agents actually can be shown to increase the duration of viral shedding.62",
