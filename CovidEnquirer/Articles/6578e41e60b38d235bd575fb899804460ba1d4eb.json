In brief, peripheral blood mononuclear cell (PBMC) samples were obtained from a single healthy donor after vaccination following written consent. Memory B cells were isolated from cryopreserved or fresh PBMCs using CD22 microbeads or anti-FITC (fluorescein isothiocyanate) microbeads (Miltenyi Biotec) after staining of PBMCs with CD22-FITC, and were immortalized with Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) and CpG in multiple wells. Supernatants of immortalized B cell clones containing monoclonal antibodies were screened for binding to HA proteins representing two different HA subtypes. Using this methodology, we identified a monoclonal from primary screening in ELISA assay that showed crossreactive binding to recombinant HA proteins of A/Vietnam/2005 H5N1 and A/ Netherlands/2003 H7N7. Variable gene sequences were isolated from this cross-reactive clone by RT-PCR, cloned and expressed as a full-length IgG transiently in 293 T cells. The lead FY1 antibody was further modified to revert the non-germline framework amino acid changes and affinity optimize the CDRs. For the affinity optimization, full-length IgG constructs containing the different variants created by CDR based parsimonious mutagenesis were expressed transiently in 293 T cells and supernatants were screened by ELISA to select clones that resulted in increased binding activity to H3 while maintaining or increasing the binding activity to H1 HA proteins. Coating concentrations of 0.15 \u00b5g/ml of rabbit anti-human IgG were used to capture and normalize variant IgG constructs from supernatants, and binding was probed using 0.5 \u00b5g/ml of biotinylated HA proteins A/Perth/2009 H3N2 and A/California/7/2009 H1N1 followed by the addition of streptavidin-HRP (1:5000). Beneficial single mutations were combined and cloned into a combinatorial library, which were expressed and screened by ELISA as described above, leading to the generation of MEDI8852.",

ELISA plates were washed, blocked 1% (w/v) casein (Thermo Scientific), and serially diluted antibodies were incubated for 1 hr at room temperature. Bound antibodies were detected using a peroxidase-conjugated mouse anti-human IgG antibody (KPL 1:10,000), followed by development with TMB solution (KPL). The absorbance at 450nm was measured, and EC 50 values were calculated using a non-linear regression of log (inhibitor) vs response in Graph Pad Prism. Cell surface expressed protein binding assays were conducted using flow cytometry to detect binding of antibodies to HA transfected cells. HEK 293 cells were transiently transfected with full-length wild type HA expressing plasmids. Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were detached with trypsin, and incubated with 5 \u00b5g/ml of FY1 or MEDI8852 on ice for 1 hour. Antibody remaining bound to surface expressed HA protein after washing was then stained with a goat anti-human IgG Daylight 649 (Jackson ImmunoResearch), and detected by flow cytometry.",

Cold adapted (ca) live-attenuated influenza vaccine viruses were generated by either classical reassortment or by reverse genetics (Jin et al., 2003) . All viruses were propagated in embryonated chicken eggs, and virus titers were determined by mean 50% tissue culture infective dose (TCID50) per milliliter. Complete viral strain designations are shown in Table S1 . The microneutralization assay was performed as described previously (Benjamin et al., 2014) . Briefly, 60 TCID50 of virus/well was added to three-fold serial dilutions of antibody in a 384-well plate in complete MEM medium containing 0.75ug/ml Trypsin (Worthington) in duplicate wells. After 1 hour incubation at 33\u00b0C 5% CO2, 2x10 4 MDCK cells/well were added to the plate. Plates were incubated at 33\u00b0C 5% CO2 incubator for approximately 40 hr, and the NA activity was measured by adding a fluorescently-labeled substrate, methylumbelliferyl-N-acetyl neuraminic acid (MU-NANA) (Sigma) to each well and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 hr. Virus replication represented by NA activity was quantified by reading fluorescence using the following settings: excitation 355 nm, emission 460 nm; 10 flashes per well. The concentration of antibody required for a 50% reduction in viral replication (IC 50 ) was calculated using a non-linear fit algorithm curve fit in Graph Pad Prism. If neutralization curve was not complete, then value was assigned the highest concentration of inhibitor tested.",

Mice were weighed on the day of or 1 day before virus challenge and monitored daily for 14 days for weight loss and survival (mice with body weight loss of \u226525% were euthanized). For the study of prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy, mice were infected intranasal with 3 x MLD50 of CA/2009 (9.5 x 10 4 TCID50/mouse); 5x MLD50 of WSN/33 (6 x 10 2 TCID50/mouse); 7 x MLD50 of rHK/68 (3.6 x 10 4 TCID50/mouse) on Day 0.

For oseltamivir comparison studies, mice were administered 25 mg/kg oseltamivir PO BID for 5 days, or a single dose of MEDI8852 10mg/kg IV with equivalent volume of vehicle given PO BID for 5 days to mimic the hydration of oseltamivir treated animals. To assess virus load in the lungs, four mice from each group were euthanized on Day 5 post-infection. Whole lungs were homogenized in 10% (wt/vol) sterile L15 medium (Invitrogen) and titrated on MDCK cells to determine the TCID 50 /gram of tissue.

Diffraction datasets were indexed and integrated with XDS (Kabsch, 2010) and scaled with XSCALE. . For solving the MEDI8852 Fab fragment, a search model was generated by blasting the sequences of its heavy and light chains and using the structures with the highest sequence homology. The search models were generated in chainsaw from CCP4 (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994). Molecular replacement was carried out with Phaser (McCoy et al., 2007) , which found two constant domains and two variable domains corresponding to two Fab fragments. The structure was refined by rigid body and simulated annealing refinement in Phenix (Adams et al., 2010) , then completely rebuilt into the electron density, and then refined by alternating cycles of model building in Coot (Emsley and Cowtan, 2004) and TLS, restrained coordinate and B factor refinement in Refmac (Murshudov et al., 2011) . The complex structures were solved by molecular replacement using the cognate HA and MEDI8852 Fab structures as search models. For the H5 complex, Phaser found solutions for two HA trimers as well as for two variable domains of MEDI8852. Electron density was visible for the other 4 variable domains as well and atomic models were placed in the appropriate positions. After rigid body refinement in Phenix, electron density appeared for the constant domains, which were manually placed in the structure. There was clear difference density for HCDR3 and LCDR1 of MEDI8852 in the complex. To build the model of the complex, an unbiased omit map was calculated for each domain (HA1 fusion, HA1 esterase, HA1 head, HA2, MEDI8852 heavy chain variable, MEDI8852 heavy chain constant, MEDI8852 light chain variable, MEDI8852 light chain constant) in Phenix. Figures of merit were calculated for these Fourier maps using SigmaA (Collaborative Computational Project, Number 4, 1994) and the maps were subjected to twofold and six fold noncrystallographic symmetry averaging in DM. A sharpening B factor of 75 A 2 was applied to the structure factors before averaging. HCDR3 and LCDR1 were completely rebuilt into the averaged maps, and other residues were rebuilt according to the averaged maps as well as difference Fourier maps. The H7 structure was solved by molecular replacement in Phaser which found the one HA monomer as well as one variable and one constant domain of MEDI8852 in the asymmetric unit. The structure was refined by restrained coordinate refinement with global NCS restraints and TLS refinement in Refmac, and TLS and group B factor refinement in Phenix with one TLS group per domain (see above).

Briefly, anti-His-tag monoclonal antibody was amine-coupled to a GLC sensor chip with final anti-His-tag capture surface densities of ~2000 resonance units (RUs). Kinetic measurements were preformed by injecting a 100 nM solution of each HA protein, and then bound with three-fold serial dilutions of MEDI8852 Fab. Binding data for all concentrations of each HA protein, plus buffer alone, were collected, and dissociation data were collected for 30 min. Binding data was globally fit to a 1:1 binding model (ProteOn Manager software) that included a term to correct for mass transport-limited binding, should it be detected. This analysis determined the kinetic rate constants (k on , k off ), from which the apparent K D was then calculated as k off /k on . Purified H5 and H7 binding to immobilized MEDI8852 was measured on an Octet RED biolayer interferometer (Pall ForteBio Corp., Menlo Park, CA, USA) . Biotinylated anti-IgG-CH1 conjugate (Thermo Fisher Scientific) was first immobilized on streptavidin biosensors (Pall ForteBio Corp., Menlo Park, CA, USA) at a concentration of approximately 1 \u00b5g/ml in 10 mM HEPES (pH 7.4), 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA and 0.005% Tween-20. MEDI8852 Fabs were then bound to the anti-IgG-CH1 conjugate and the binding of HA (at 0.2 -200 nM) to the immobilized Fabs was measured at 25 o C in a 400 second association step. isotype control mAb, R347 resulted in 13% survival for WSN/33 H1 and 0% survival for rHK/68 H3 infection b Log viral titer reduction was calculated by comparing to R347 treated animals with lung viral titers of 9.51 log 10 TCID 50 /g for WSN/33 H1 and 7.99 log 10 TCID 50 /g for rHK/68 H3 *p<0.05 using the Log Rank Mantel-Cox test for survival, and students t-test for lung viral titers of MEDI8852 treated animals verses R347 control treated animals ",
