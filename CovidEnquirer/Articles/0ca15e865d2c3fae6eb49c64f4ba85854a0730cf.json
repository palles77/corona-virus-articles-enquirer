The most common procedures include gastric banding (which may be adjustable), sleeve gastrectomy, Roux-en-Y gastric bypass, and biliopancreatic diversion with duodenal switch. Some patients treated with these procedures suffer from postoperative gastrointestinal complaints, including nausea, vomiting, the dumping syndrome (especially with the Roux-en-Y procedure), and other complaints such as ulcers, bowel obstructions, hernias, and adhesions. 3 These patients have specific nutritional needs after surgery. Many patients have food intolerances, including intolerance to bread, dairy foods, carbonated beverages, dry or sticky food, or foods of high sugar content. In addition, these patients often require protein-rich foods, and especially in the early postoperative period, they need to avoid dehydration. 4 Thus, the complicated logistics of nutritional support in a disaster may put these patients at risk for a variety of gastrointestinal complaints, poor wound healing, and dehydration. In addition, besides the routine presentation of these complications at the time of a disaster, the signs and symptoms of these adverse effects may also mimic the signs or symptoms of a variety of common disaster-related complications, including blast abdomen, toxin or chemical ingestion, gastrointestinal complications of biologic agents or acute radiation exposure, or simply the overwhelming effects of the stress of experiencing a disaster. Therefore, especially in these patients, a thorough knowledge of the medical and surgical history becomes important in discerning the effects of the previous surgery from that of the acute event.",

For example, simply recognizing the problem can be especially difficult, because emergency personnel can accurately predict the weight of patients with a BMI greater than 30 only 23% of the time. 5 Even internal medicine residents who often treat the medical consequences of obesity do not know the BMI required to diagnose obesity 60% of the time; 40% do not even know their own BMI. 6 Patients presenting to emergency departments during normal daily operations are increasing in number as reflected by national statistics. From 1986 to 2000, patients with a BMI greater than 30 increased from 10% to 20% of the population; those with a BMI greater than 40 increased from 0.5% to 2%. Those with a BMI greater than 50 increased from 1 in 2000 to 1 in 400 persons. More than three-fourths of emergency departments in 2006 reported an increase in the number of these \"superobese\" patients. These patients require specialized transportation equipment and extra support personnel. Ambulances need special beds, ramps, winches, and other equipments to bring them to the emergency departments. Emergency departments also require expensive equipments such as patient lifters that cost approximately $18,000. 7",

            "text": "As the patients' weight and mobility requirements increase, so do the resource requirements to meet those needs. Once exposed to a disaster scenario, patients require on-scene treatment and transportation to a facility capable of managing them. Unlike normal events, in which most survivors find their own conveyance to the closest hospital, obese patients will most likely not be able to do that, relying therefore on emergency medical services (EMS). Less critically ill patients may be taken to lower-acuity facilities or, in the setting of a slowly evolving event like pandemic flu, a community surge facility such as an acute care facility. For example, special accommodations may also be needed to get these patients immunized, because it is unlikely Geiling that they will be able to get to a community vaccine or medication point of distribution (POD). If hospitalization is required, these patients will need to be managed regionally as is done with pediatric or burn patients at present. Regional Medical Control Centers should monitor what facilities can manage these patients and ensure that proper transportation assets are available to assist in their movement. 8 In addition, community health planners need to be aware of these patients in their community, in the same way they should be aware of patients with home oxygen or medical devices. If these patients need evacuation because of a pending disaster or sudden event, then the local medical control should be proactive in seeking resources to move them to appropriate care or transportation hubs for moving them out of the region. 9 When disasters occur, the effect on the health care system depends on the nature of the event. In sudden-impact disasters such as transportation accidents, bombings, or fire, large numbers of patients tend to present to the closest facility over a short time span, typically within 3 hours. The hospital is mostly affected in the emergency department and, perhaps, the operating room. However, more protracted events such as pandemic flu would have a more prolonged effect on intensive care units (ICUs). These valuable resources may quickly become overburdened, requiring resources to surge to meet those needs. Ideally, hospitals discharge less critically ill patients to home, long-term care facilities, or even community disaster centers, leaving staffed ICU beds available for those needing this care. However, because those strategies also become overwhelmed, hospitals will need to expand their internal critical care capabilities with creative approaches to surging equipment, staff, and care space, that is, stuff, staff, and space. Because of the increased needs and comorbidities of obese patients, they pose additional challenges to this surge strategy. 10 Stuff Simple measures such as determining vital signs may be challenging in a disaster setting. In a review from France, prehospital management problems of morbidly obese patients included inability to measure blood pressure in 9%, inability to gain venous access in 13%, and difficulty in intubating 20% of the patients, often requiring advanced airways. 11 The routine use of noninvasive blood pressure cuffs may not be useful because of the inherent inaccuracies of the cuff's bladder size to arm circumference. 12 Normal emergency department and ICU procedures may also need additional support, including changed or decreased quality of electrocardiograms, poor radiographic or ultrasonographic imaging, increased reliance on invasive monitoring or procedures, such as diagnostic peritoneal lavage if the patient cannot fit the computed tomographic scanner, and advanced airway support due to oropharynx size or neck mobility limitations. 13 In 2008, the Task Force on Mass Critical Care reviewed the recommended ventilator characteristics for disaster settings as well as ancillary equipment. 14 Although review of that information reveals no specific recommendations for the needs of the obese patient, it does point to the requirement to ensure the equipment cached for disaster events do, indeed, fit these patients. The ventilator characteristics should meet such patients' needs, although if noninvasive ventilation is considered (which was not recommended by the Task Force), appropriately sized masks must be available. In addition, monitoring equipments such as blood pressure cuffs and pulse oximeters as well as central venous catheters and other tubes and lines must be of sufficient sensitivity and size to care for these patients.",

They have also been noted to have difficulty in clearing secretions when recumbent. 17 Also, in shelters, observed snoring and OSA in patients have prompted urgent \"disaster sleep studies\" and have been shown to adversely affect others in the shelter, disturbing their sleep. 18 Shelters also have limited toilet and bathing facilities. Obese patients may require special accommodations for these routine functions. For example, nurses are often not aware of the weight limitations of toilets or bedside commode, leading to potential patient safety challenges. 19 The US Department of Health and Human Services has developed and continues to improve several fully equipped Federal Medical Stations (FMS) that can deploy to disaster locations. The FMS provide a 250-bed capability that includes 3 days of medical supplies, equipment, and pharmaceuticals. FMS are deployed to disaster locations and set up in buildings of convenience, such as convention centers, arenas, or warehouses.

Once hospitalized, severely obese patients with a BMI greater than 30 have higher mortality than obese patients. Increased injury severity score and BMI are independent determinants of outcome with obese patients having increased pulmonary, renal, and thromboembolic complications. 25 Obese patients who survive also require longer periods of mechanical ventilation and hospitalization. 26 However, the mortality data on these patients suffering blunt traumatic injury are not consistent. 27 In fact, although obese patients may have longer hospitalizations, which must be considered in planning health care system capabilities, they do not seem to suffer increased ICU or hospital mortality, which may actually be lower. 28 Most assume that airway management in trauma patients is compromised by the physical changes and limitations in the morbidly obese. However, data demonstrating this problem are limited. In comparison with lean and overweight patients, a review of airway management experience at a level 1 trauma facility showed no difference in difficult intubations. However, an important caveat is that 92% of the intubations were conducted by an experienced anesthesia team, with 6% by experienced emergency department personnel. In short, although classically these patients are thought to have challenging airway management issues, in experienced hands this has not been demonstrated. 29 Blast injuries result in primary (such as tympanic membrane rupture), secondary (from blast projectiles), tertiary (from being projected into an obstacle), and quaternary (from associated injuries such as burns) injuries. Prognostic factors include the magnitude of the explosion, building collapse, time interval to treatment, triage accuracy, and immediacy of medical or surgical support. 30 Several of these prognostic factors may be affected by the size of the patient, including accuracy of the triage, ability to transport the patient, and the resources needed to get the patient immediately to the operating room. Specific effects of the blast may also be affected by the size of the patient, including the development of intestinal injuries. The potential cushioning effect of a pannus could serve as a protective barrier, yet diagnosis of acute blast abdomen may be challenging depending on ultrasonography or computerized axial tomographic scan capabilities; peritoneal lavage may need to be performed. Large wounds in patients with significant subcutaneous tissue involvement may be predisposed to poor wound healing.",

Many nurses believe the patients are not motivated to change their condition, and they do not believe they are effective in helping the patients achieve any behavioral change. Similarly, physicians have adverse opinions especially about the morbidly obese patients. The patients often view the health care community as biased against them, often disrespectful in the care they receive. 18 Thus, faced with a disaster setting of limited resources and perhaps with some patient care bias in managing obese patients, a transparent process of triaging resources must be developed. Several models have recently been proposed in triaging hospital or ICU resources for nontrauma patients, so-called tertiary triage. Most models focus on use of the sequential organ failure assessment (SOFA) score. Through the use of an intensivist-led multidisciplinary triage team, patients in need of advanced clinical resources are evaluated for inclusion and then exclusion criteria and followed up using the SOFA score to determine illness severity and course. Patients with predicted high mortality or failure to improve, in this model, would be supported with palliative care and have their resources reallocated to other patients with greater chance of survival. Important to note is that none of the models specifically target patient weight as a criterion in determining need or exclusion; what counts is the severity of the illness. 38, 39 SUMMARY Management of the morbidly obese patient under normal circumstances requires increased resources such as personnel, supplies, and special equipment. In the often Critical Care of the Morbidly Obese in Disasters resource-constrained setting of disasters, normal support to these patients may be jeopardized. In addition, their underlying condition with limited mobility and comorbidities may increase their likelihood of suffering harm depending on the type and tempo of the disaster. Morbidly obese patients are a special-needs population for whom necessary planning must be done to mitigate the effects of the disaster on them. Prior planning not only addresses appropriate care needs for these patients but also avoids crisis intervention during an event that might detract care and support from others during stressful times. In the end, such planning helps optimize the care for all.",
