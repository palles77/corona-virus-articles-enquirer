In the present study, a multiplex quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (mqPCR) panel was optimized for the detection of eight canine neurologic pathogens (Blastomyces dermatitidis, Cryptococcus spp., Neospora caninum, Borrelia burgdorferi, Bartonella spp., Toxoplasma gondii, Ehrlichia canis, and canine distemper virus [CDV]). The mqPCR panel was subsequently applied to 53 cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) samples collected from dogs with ME. The analytic sensitivity (i.e., limit of detection, expressed as molecules per 1 \uf06dL of recombinant vector) was 3.8 for CDV, 3.7 for Ehrlichia canis, 3.7 for Bartonella spp., 3.8 for Borrelia burgdorferi, 3.7 for Blastomyces dermatitidis, 3.7 for Cryptococcus spp., 38 for Neospora caninum, and 3.7 for Toxoplasma gondii. Among the tested CSF samples, seven (15%) were positive for the following pathogens in decreasing order of frequency: Cryptococcus spp. (3/7), Blastomyces dermatitidis (2/7), and Borrelia burgdorferi (2/7). In summary, use of an mqPCR panel with high analytic sensitivity as an initial screen for infectious agents in dogs with ME could facilitate the selection of early treatment strategies and improve outcomes.",

Nucleic acids (DNA and RNA) extracted from whole blood in two dogs were used as negative controls. All field isolates were identified by culture, conventional PCR, or antigen-capturing ELISA and verified by DNA sequencing. The vectors were constructed by amplifying synthetic oligonucleotides based on sequences obtained from the GenBank database (National Center for Biotechnology Information, USA) using the primers listed in Table 1 and cloned into a T-Blunt PCR Cloning Kit (SolGent, Korea) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Correct insertion into the vector was verified by sequencing.

The analytic sensitivity of the panel was as good as each singleplex assay, and there was no interference among primer/probe sets, suggesting that the panel could be substituted for the singleplex assay. The panel optimized in this study was also designed for use with one-step extraction and PCR procedures in a 48-well format. Accordingly, simultaneous testing of a large number of samples can be achieved at a lower cost, with less time and effort than routine diagnostic techniques, such as individual PCR, cultures, microscopic examination, and ELISA. ME is a common inflammatory CNS disease in dogs [22] . Histopathology can be used to classify ME based on the tissue manifestations of the disease. However, histopathological diagnosis has little relevance for clinical outcome because treatments are not specific for the ME subtype. A previous study employed PCR to examine the presence of viral agents that cause human ME in a small number of canine ME cases and found that none were positive for human ME viruses [26] . In contrast, the present study focused on eight known neurologic pathogens that have caused outbreaks in Korea and confirmed their relatively high prevalence among dogs with ME (7/47). Therefore, it is possible that the prevalence of neurologic infections causing ME in dogs has been underestimated. Although the cases of ME that tested positive for pathogens were not confirmed by histopathology, one case of infection with Cryptococcus spp. exhibited dramatic clinical improvement after a two-month treatment with oral fluconazole. Moreover, after observation for one year, there was no relapse of neurological signs, suggesting the importance of early pathogen detection for the selection of an effective treatment strategy. In the present study, five of the seven cases of infection were with a fungal agent that could not be eradicated by conventional antibiotics or anti-inflammatory agents, demonstrating the importance of proper diagnosis.",

B. dermatitidis, which is endemic to North America, is seldom associated with CNS infection [1] and usually presents with lymphadenopathy or pulmonary infiltration [17] .
