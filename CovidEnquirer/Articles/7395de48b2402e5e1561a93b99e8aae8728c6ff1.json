Our recent study provided first clues: we have shown that the binding of TRIM25 to pre-let-7 leads to its more efficient Lin28a-mediated uridylation (Choudhury et al., 2014) . This finding raised the possibility that RNA processing may be spatially controlled through post-translational protein modifications by RNA-binding protein-modifying enzymes, such as TRIM25. Furthermore, TRIM25 could be using RNA as a scaffold to ubiquitinate its targets. Importantly, the transcriptome and proteome-wide targets of TRIM25 have not yet been identified. Finally, its RNA-binding domain has not been unequivocally described.",

Our CLIP-seq data identifies hundreds of coding and non-coding RNAs bound by TRIM25. We show that TRIM25 binds a distinct set of RNAs and prefers to bind sequences rich in G and C. We also demonstrate that TRIM25 associates with many RNA-binding proteins, thus suggesting it could play a role in regulating RNA metabolism.",

            "text": "More than 300 novel RNA-binding proteins have been identified in HeLa (Castello et al., 2012) , HEK293 (Baltz et al., 2012) and mouse ES cells (Kwon et al., 2013) . Furthermore, a recent study identified 393 new RNA-binding proteins unique to cardiomyocytes (Liao et al., 2016) . Strikingly, many of these proteins were not previously known for their RNA-binding properties and do not contain canonical RNA-binding domains. Intriguingly, E3 ubiquitin ligases from the Tripartite Motif (TRIM) family (TRIM25, TRIM56 and TRIM71) are among these newly identified RNA-binding proteins. TRIM proteins have a characteristic architecture that includes RING zinc-finger, B-Box, coiled-coil (CC) and variable C-terminal domains. There are over 80 TRIM proteins in the human genome, and they have been divided into 11 subfamilies based on their structural composition (Versteeg et al., 2013) . The largest subfamily (C-IV) of 33 TRIM proteins is characterized by the PRY/SPRY domain at the Cterminal end. Most the proteins from the TRIM family are involved in innate immune responses (Jefferies et al., 2011; Rajsbaum et al., 2014; van Tol et al., 2017) . For example, TRIM25 plays a role in the RIG-I-mediated interferon response to viral RNAs (Ozato et al., 2008; Versteeg et al., 2013) . RIG-I recognizes viral RNA molecules with a 5'-triphosphate (5'-ppp-RNA) (Yoneyama et al., 2004) and initiates a downstream signaling cascade that culminates with the expression of type I interferons (interferon \u03b1 and \u03b2 ) (Loo and Gale, 2011) and an anti-viral response. TRIM25 mediates K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I, which leads to efficient recruitment of its downstream partners. Such recruitment in turn triggers the interferon response (Gack et al., 2007) . Recently, TRIM25 was shown to be required for the antiviral activity of RNA-binding Zinc Finger Antiviral Protein (ZAP) Zheng et al., 2017) . Almost nothing is known about the RNA-mediated roles and characteristics of these RNA-binding E3 ligases.",

In brief, wild-type T7-tagged TRIM25 was expressed in HeLa cells, and the co-IP was performed using protein A agarose beads coupled with the anti-T7 antibody (Fig. 3a) . The control cells (without T7-TRIM25) were grown in \"heavy\" medium, and the cells expressing T7-tagged TRIM25 were grown in detected in the co-IP with T7-TRIM25 but not T7-TRIM25\u0394RBD, although the RNase treatment resulted in only a decreased interaction (Fig. 3e) . Importantly, many proteins that were enriched in the T7-TRIM25\u0394RBD and RNase-treated T7-TRIM25 assays were associated with ribosomal and translation functions ( Fig. 3b-3c ). They represent RNAindependent interactions with TRIM25 (Table S1) . Surprisingly, the T7-TRIM25\u0394RBD and RNase-treated T7-TRIM25 co-IPs detected several proteins that were not seen in the wildtype T7-TRIM25 co-IP. This could be due to a synthetic effect of the mutation, lack of binding to RNA or unspecific binding events. Altogether, these results reaffirm that the PRY/SPRY domain is important for RNA-binding and show that TRIM25 interacts with many RNA-binding proteins, using RNA as a scaffold.",

After UV crosslinking and immunoprecipitation, we observed a specific RNA-protein complex ( Figure S3a ). CLIPseq of T7-TRIM25\u0394RBD resulted in a lack of detectable RNA-protein interactions (data not shown). The RNA from the T7-TRIM25/RNA complex was isolated using a CLIP-seq protocol and sequenced on a HiSeq platform. Data analysis and cluster identification using pyCRAC (Webb et al., 2014) revealed a significant correlation between three biological replicates with a correlation coefficient between clusters from 0.94 to 0.96 ( Figure S4 ). Five thousand five hundred and forty-nine clusters were common between all three experiments, and we identified 2611 distinct transcripts (Table S3) . Importantly, there was no correlation between transcript abundance, measured by a separate RNA-seq assay, and the cluster intensities, with a Pearson correlation of 0.1 ( Figure S5 ). This shows that TRIM25 does not simply bind the most abundant RNAs but has a substrate preference. Among the identified transcripts, mRNAs and lincRNAs were the most abundant (Fig. 4a ). GO-term annotation of TRIM25-bound transcripts revealed several nodes including RNA processing and translation, WD repeats, phosphorylation and ubiquitination ( Figure S6a ).",

Furthermore, we observed a noticeable enrichment of TRIM25 clusters just after the stop codon (Fig. 4e ). TRIM25 binds to its own transcript, which could be biologically important ( Figure S3b ). Intriguingly, even though TRIM25 is localized to both nucleus and cytoplasm (Choudhury et al., 2014) intron binding events were not common in CLIP-seq analysis. This could be demonstrated on TRIM25 mRNA target -c-Myc. Both high throughput CLIP-seq and TRIM25 RNA Immunoprecipitation (RIP) followed by targeted amplification of c-Myc transcript showed that TRIM25 predominantly interacts with mature mRNA ( Figure S3c -S3d). Nevertheless, TRIM25 interacts with many RNA-binding proteins (Fig. 3) and they could provide a platform for interactions with other targets at the level of pre-mRNAs.",

            "text": "To uncover the RNA-related function of TRIM25 and the reason behind binding to its own mRNA, we focused on the well-documented molecular event of TRIM25 K117 autoubiquitination (Inn et al., 2011) . We confirmed that TRIM25 undergoes autoubiquitination by co-overexpression and co-IP of T7-tagged TRIM25 together with HAtagged ubiquitin ( Figure S8a-S8b) . This was also confirmed by the in vitro ubiquitination experiments described below. Next, we asked if binding of TRIM25 to its own mRNA augmented TRIM25 ubiquitination. To address this, we overexpressed EGFP-TRIM25 or EGFP-TRIM25\u0394RBD in HeLa cells and assayed for TRIM25 ubiquitination. We used EGFP fusion proteins to distinguish overexpressed and endogenous TRIM25. The overexpression of EGFP-TRIM25 led to the appearance of modified EGFP-TRIM25 ( Fig. 5a-5b) . However, upon EGFP-TRIM25\u0394RBD overexpression, the intensity of the modified band was noticeably reduced (Fig. 5a-5b ). Of note, we had to use more EGFP-TRIM25\u0394RBD plasmid to achieve protein expression comparable to that of EGFP-TRIM25. Surprisingly, overexpression of EGFP-TRIM25, but not EGFP-TRIM25\u0394RBD, led to significant accumulation of modified forms of endogenous TRIM25, with much higher ratios of the modified forms compared to the non-modified form ( Fig. 5a-5b) . These results suggest that the intact RBD is required for efficient ubiquitination. They also show that endogenous TRIM25 can be modified by EGFP-TRIM25 to a much greater extent than EGFP-TRIM25 modifies itself. One important difference between endogenous TRIM25 mRNA and the mRNA coding for EGFP-TRIM25 is the presence of 5' and 3' UTRs, which were shown to bind TRIM25 in the CLIP-seq experiments ( Figure S3b ).",

We also used a T7-TRIM25\u0394RING_3'UTR construct that contained the TRIM25 3'UTR. Notably, we had to use more T7-TRIM25\u0394RING_3'UTR plasmid to achieve protein expression comparable to that of T7-TRIM25\u0394RING (Fig. 5c ). This is most likely connected to microRNA/3'UTR-mediated control of protein expression. As predicted, T7-TRIM25\u0394RING does not support efficient autoubiquitination (Fig. 5c ). However, upon EGFP-TRIM25 overexpression, we noticed the appearance of ubiquitinated forms of T7-TRIM25\u0394RING ( Fig. 5c-5d ). We could not detect abundant ubiquitination bands in T7-TRIM25\u0394RING when EGFP-TRIM25\u0394RBD was cooverexpressed ( Fig. 5c-5d ). Even so, the ratio between the ubiquitinated and main bands still showed a positive value, most likely due to weaker expression of T7-TRIM25\u0394RING in the presence of EGFP-TRIM25\u0394RBD and to background noise. Importantly, when we cooverexpressed the T7-TRIM25\u0394RING_3'UTR construct with EGFP-TRIM25, we observed a noticeable increase in the ratio of ubiquitinated vs non-ubiquitinated bands for TRIM25\u0394RING, when compared with the T7-TRIM25\u0394RING construct without the 3'UTR ( Fig. 5c-5d ). To prove that the observed modification of TRIM25 was specific to K117 we performed similar analyses with T7-TRIM25\u0394RING_K117R constructs. We did not observe modification of T7-TRIM25\u0394RING_K117R in the absence or presence of EGFP-TRIM25 ( Figure S8c ). Altogether, these results strongly suggest that RNA elements such as the 3'UTR, as well as TRIM25 binding to the RNA, contribute to TRIM25 ubiquitination.",

Here, we revealed that the RNAbinding activity of TRIM25 is contained in its PRY/SPRY region. We also presented the first high-throughput analysis of the molecular interactomes of TRIM25. We showed that TRIM25 is a bona fide RNA-binding protein that associates with many proteins involved in RNA metabolism and interacts with numerous coding and non-coding transcripts. This suggests that TRIM25 could play a role in the regulation of RNA metabolism. Our data showed that TRIM25 binding to RNA and to the 3'UTR of TRIM25 mRNA in particular can augment its autoubiquitination. Finally, we demonstrated that RNA is an important constituent of TRIM25's ubiquitin ligase activity towards itself and its physiologically relevant protein target ZAP. Recently, ZAP was shown to suppress HIV-1 replication by binding CG-rich regions in viral RNAs (Takata et al., 2017) . Intriguingly, the first paper that described ubiquitin conjugation to substrates showed that tRNA is required for selected ubiquitination reactions (Ferber and Ciechanover, 1986) . We propose a model whereby the ubiquitin ligase activity of TRIM25 is substantially enhanced by using RNA as a scaffold (Fig. 9a) .",

This discrepancy could arise from the fact that deletion of the CC domain from TRIM25 eliminates its dimerization (Li et al., 2014; Sanchez et al., 2014; Streich et al., 2013) and oligomerization (Koliopoulos et al., 2016 ) ability (Fig. 2c) . While it is not univocally confirmed that TRIM25 needs to dimerize to bind RNA, such a phenomenon is widespread across many RNA-binding proteins (Feracci et al., 2016; Lunde et al., 2007) . Additionally, the experiments presented in Kwon et al. were performed in wild-type mouse Embryonic Stem Cells (mESC), where levels of endogenous TRIM25 are particularly high (Kwon et al., 2013) . This means that any ectopically overexpressed TRIM25 mutant (if it has the CC domain), including TRIM25\u0394PRY/SPRY, will have a chance to heterodimerize with the wild-type, endogenous TRIM25. This could mask the requirements for a TRIM25 domain, such as PRY/SPRY, to bind to RNA. Our RNA pull-down data with the extracts from the TRIM25 KO cells clearly demonstrated that T7-TRIM25\u0394PRY/SPRY could not bind RNA (Fig. 1g) . Further structural characterization of the TRIM25/RNA complex should reveal novel features of this interaction and shed more light on this novel, putative RNA-binding domain.",

In this context TRIM5 was shown to generate K63 ubiquitin chains, which are required for restriction of retroviral reverse transcription (Fletcher et al., 2015) . Thus, in the future, it will be important to assay other TRIM proteins to determine their RNA-binding activities. Notably, other E3 ubiquitin ligases, including Mex3b and Dizip3, have been shown to use RNA as a scaffold to mediate the ubiquitination of their substrates, which are bound to the same RNA (Yoon et al., 2013) . Roquin is another example of an E3 ubiquitin ligase with a well-established RNA-binding ability (Leppek et al., 2013) . Moreover, the BRACA1 E3 ubiquitin ligase, which is implicated in familial breast cancer, has been shown to interact with RNAs (Kawai and Amano, 2012) . Altogether, these results strongly suggest the possibility of widespread roles of E3 ubiquitin ligases in the direct regulation of RNA metabolism.",

K63-linked ubiquitination of RIG-I by TRIM25 is required for an efficient interferon response (Gack et al., 2007) . RIG-I can also be stimulated by unanchored polyubiquitin chains generated by TRIM25 (Zeng et al., 2010) . This interaction is targeted by viruses to suppress the interferon response. For example, the influenza's RNA-binding protein NS1 inhibits TRIM25-mediated ubiquitination of RIG-I by binding to the TRIM25 CC domain and disrupting its dimerization, allowing the virus to avoid the innate immune response (Gack et al., 2009) . This inhibitory activity is significantly reduced in an NS1 mutant R38A/K41A, which cannot bind RNA (Donelan et al., 2003) . This raises questions about a possible functional link between the RNA-binding activities of TRIM25 and NS1. Finally, SARS-CoV nucleocapsid protein (N-protein) has been shown to inhibit TRIM25 by binding to TRIM25's PRY/SPRY domain (Hu et al., 2017) .",
