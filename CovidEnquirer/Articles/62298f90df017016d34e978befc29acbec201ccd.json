Here, we have systematically studied the impact of minor differences in NP composition on cellular stress responses and viability by using highly similar poly(alkylcyanoacrylate) (PACA) particles. Surprisingly, PACA particles differing only in their alkyl side chains; butyl (PBCA), ethylbutyl (PEBCA), or octyl (POCA), respectively, induced different stress responses and modes of cell death in human cell lines. POCA particles induced endoplasmic reticulum stress and apoptosis. In contrast, PBCA and PEBCA particles induced lipid peroxidation by depletion of the main cellular antioxidant glutathione (GSH), in a manner depending on the levels of the GSH precursor cystine, and transcription of the cystine transporter SLC7A11 regulated by ATF4 and Nrf2. Intriguingly, these particles activated the recently discovered cell death mechanism ferroptosis, which constitutes a promising alternative for targeting multidrug-resistant cancer stem-like cells. Of the two, PBCA was the strongest inducer. In summary, our findings highlight the cellular sensitivity to nanoparticle composition and have important implications for the choice of PACA monomer in therapeutical settings.",

In NP-mediated drug delivery, cellular stress pathways that are induced as a response to the nanocarrier itself may be beneficial if these stress responses sensitize the target cells. A variety of NPs have been shown to alter the cellular redox balance either by overproduction of reactive oxygen species (ROS) or by depleting the cellular reserve of the main ROS scavenger molecule, reduced glutathione (GSH) [2] . To regain redox homeostasis, an antioxidant response is initiated by activation of transcription factors like Nrf2, HIF1, NF\uf06bB, or ATF4, which leads to increased expression of proteins with antioxidant properties [5, 6] . ER stress is characterized by disruption of ER lumen homeostasis, which leads to accumulation of unfolded proteins in the ER. This activates the unfolded protein response (UPR), an adaptive pathway that aims to clear unfolded proteins and restore ER homeostasis [7] . A diversity of NPs has been reported to induce accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins or activate the UPR [3] .",

However, if the insult is too severe or prolonged the antioxidant response can no longer protect the cells, and the UPR response is switched to a pro-death pathway [8] . Thus, NP-induced stress pathways are two-faced; they may positively contribute to the intended NP-based therapy in certain settings, but may also prevent an optimal effect in others. Moreover, excessive stress responses may give rise to NP supplemented with 10% fetal calf serum, 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 \uf06dg/ml streptomycin at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO 2 . All cells were seeded one day prior to the experiments. For inhibitor studies, cells were pretreated with the inhibitor at the indicated concentration for 30 minutes before addition of PACA particles. The cellular ATP level (as a surrogate for viability) was measured using the CellTiter-Glo\u00ae Luminescent Cell Viability Assay (Promega) and cell death was measured by the CellTox\u2122 Green Cytotoxicity Assay (Promega) according to the manufacturer's procedures. Both luminescence and fluorescence were measured by a Synergy2 plate reader (BioTek). Cystine-free medium was prepared by supplementing DMEM without cystine and methionine (#21013, Gibco) with L-methionine (200 \u00b5M), 10% fetal calf serum, 4 mM GlutaMAX\u2122 (Gibco), 100 U/ml penicillin, and 100 \uf06dg/ml streptomycin. Determination of protein synthesis was performed after 4 hours of treatment with PACA particles, by incubating the cells with leucine-free HEPES-buffered medium complemented with 2 \u03bcCi/ml [ 3 H]leucine (PerkinElmer) at 37\u00b0C for 20 min before proteins were precipitated with 5% (w/v) trichloroacetic acid and washed once with the same solution.",

The resulting particles exhibited similar mean sizes, in the range of 133-153 nm, with a relatively narrow size distribution. All three NPs were slightly negatively charged with a zeta-potential of approximately -3 mV ( Figure 1B ). When particle cytotoxicity was compared across a panel of cancer cell lines (MDA-MB-231, SW480, Huh7, HCT116, MCF7, and HeLa) the POCA particles consistently exerted the highest cytotoxicity, whereas PEBCA particles were the least toxic ( Figure 1C ). This is in agreement with our previous screening study with a set of 12 other cancer cell lines [11] . Importantly, we have found that this pattern of cytotoxicity is not caused by gross differences in cellular uptake of the particles [11, 18] . To assess whether the differential PACA cytotoxicity is caused by particle-specific induction of cellular stress responses, we focused on the triple negative breast cancer cell line MDA-MB-231 that displayed the largest diversity in particle cytotoxicity ( Figure 1C ).",

This allows for preferential translation of UPRdependent genes, such as the activating transcriptional factor 4 (ATF4), which initiates transcription of genes encoding ER chaperones, amino acid transporters, and antioxidant proteins that contribute to restoration of cellular homeostasis [7] . Intriguingly, the three variants of PACA NPs induced a highly different UPR activation pattern ( Figure 2B This might suggest that eIF2\u03b1 is predominantly phosphorylated by an alternative kinase in PBCA-treated cells.

These kinases sense various internal or external stressors, including amino acid starvation, viral infection, proteasomal inhibition, and redox imbalance [19] . In order to see whether the PBCA-induced ATF4 accumulation is mediated via the ISR, we employed the recently developed ISR inhibitor ISRIB, which blocks all downstream effects of phosphorylated eIF2\u03b1 [20] ( Figure 2E ). Indeed, the PBCA-induced accumulation of ATF4 was inhibited by ISRIB ( Figure 2F -G). Thapsigargin was used as a positive control for ISR-induction [21] .

As expected, the positive control L-leucyl-L-leucine methyl ester (LLOMe), a lysosomotropic detergent-like substance [24] , rapidly induced numerous mCherry-Galectin-3 puncta ( Figure 4F ). In contrast, the PACA particles, even at high concentrations and prolonged treatment, did not induce evident galectin-3 staining stronger than the background level ( Figure 4F , Supplementary videos 4-7). The only exception was galectin-3 puncta appearing in POCAtreated cells several hours after initiation of membrane blebbing, likely as a secondary event of apoptosis.

The cystine starvation-induced cell death, and importantly also the cell death induced by PBCA particles in cystine-free medium, was fully inhibited by the ferroptosis inhibitors ferrostatin, liproxstatin, or DFP, or by re-addition of cystine ( Figure 5D -E), whereas z-VAD had no effect. Surprisingly, in cystine-free medium even the relatively non-cytotoxic PEBCA particles exerted potent ferroptosis-dependent cytotoxicity ( Figure 5D -E). To test whether the increased vulnerability towards these two PACA particles was caused by a lower antioxidant capacity in cystine-starved cells, the cellular GSH levels were measured.

Remarkably, PBCA particles transiently activated the two major amino acid sensing pathways [31, 32] , as revealed by activation of GCN2 and suppression of mTORC1 signaling. The particles induced dephosphorylation of the mTORC1 substrate S6K after 15-30 minutes of addition and a transient phosphorylation of GCN2 after 15 minutes ( Figure 7A-C) . mTORC1 and GCN2 not only sense cellular amino acid levels, but are also the main regulators of cellular protein biosynthesis [33, 34] . Accordingly, in parallel with the PBCAinduced dephosphorylation of S6K, protein synthesis was reduced during the first hour of incubation, before gradual recovery ( Figure 7D ). As cystine is consumed both in general protein synthesis and in GSH production, a reduction in general protein synthesis would increase the cellular availability of cystine. In line with this, cycloheximide, a well-known inhibitor of protein synthesis, totally abolished the cellular stress responses induced by low concentrations of PBCA under cystine starvation, including the accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins, ATF4, and Nrf2, the phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1, and the dephosphorylation of S6K ( Figure 7E) .

From our data, it seems unlikely that the three particles merely affect the cells via the same mechanism with different potency. Rather, it seems that each particle induces specific effects during the NP-cell interaction. Moreover, the net effect on cell viability of each particle seems to be determined by the balance between particle-induced pro-death and pro-survival responses. Both the POCA particles and high concentrations of PEBCA particles clearly induced ER stress, as revealed by phosphorylation of PERK, and yet the particle-induced cytotoxicity was very different. Thus, although treatment with both PEBCA and POCA particles affect ER homeostasis, the POCA particles may exert a more acute and severe effect, which renders the cells less able to activate pro-survival pathways to restore homeostasis, and as a result, apoptosis is rapidly induced. In contrast, the PBCA particles did not induce ER stress and PERK activation, but still induced rapid and potent phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1 and accumulation of ATF4. This activation was mediated by the ISR, as the accumulation of ATF4 was blocked by the ISR inhibitor ISRIB or simultaneous depletion of the four ISR kinases. We were unable to identify a specific kinase responsible for the PBCA-induced ATF4 accumulation, however, this may be explained by the significant redundancy among ISR kinases [35] [36] [37] . As both GCN2, HRI, and PKR have been implicated in detection of oxidative stress [19] , and the PBCA-induced ATF4-induction was abolished by both GSH and the antioxidant NAC, it is likely that PBCA-induced oxidative stress author/funder.

Activation of ATF4 via the ISR exerted a pro-survival role upon treatment with low PBCA concentrations. This may be caused by increased ATF4-mediated transcription of components involved in antioxidant responses, such as the cystine transporter SLC7A11. Furthermore, the PBCA-induced ISR could potentially contribute to cell survival by downregulation of protein synthesis via phosphorylation of eIF2\u03b1. Inhibition of protein synthesis would both increase the availability of cysteine for GSH production and reduce the workload for the ER protein folding machinery, thus potentially, limiting both oxidative stress and ER stress. The protein synthesis inhibitor cycloheximide prevented PBCA-induced accumulation of ubiquitinated proteins and activation of the ISR and Nrf2, linking amino acid availability, most likely cystine, to initiation of stress responses. Cycloheximide also abolished the PBCA-induced amino acid starvation response, in line with data from HepG2 cells starved for cystine [30] . Cysteine availability for GSH production may also depend on the extent of amino acid liberation through protein degradation pathways, such as proteasomal degradation. Along these lines, inhibition of proteasomal degradation by bortezomib, a promising anti-cancer drug, induced cell death via limiting the levels of intracellular cystine, and thus GSH, in myeloma cells [38] . Taken together, activation of the ISR constitutes a prosurvival response at low PBCA concentrations. Notably, although the PEBCA-induced ATF4 accumulation is likely caused by the upstream PERK activation, a contribution from the other ISR kinases, for instance by detection of oxidative stress, cannot be excluded.",

An alternative scenario is that the particles induce concomitant GSH depletion and reduced cystine availability, as shown to be required for ferroptosis induction in HepG2 cells [30] .

The PBCA particles were able to induce ferroptosis also in cells grown in full medium. These findings are of great interest in drug-delivery, as cellular stress pathways that are induced as a response to the nanocarrier itself may be beneficial if these stress responses sensitizes the target cells. Many cancer types have been shown to be sensitive to ferroptosis induction [41, 42] . Ferroptosis-sensitive cells are characterized by low antioxidant gene expression, including Nrf2 target genes, and decreased levels of GSH and NADPH [15] , are highly vulnerable to GSH depletion, and depend on constant cystine import via the Xc-transporter [13] .

Interestingly, PEBCA particles loaded with doxorubicin are currently in clinical trials for hepatocellular carcinoma (ClinicalTrials.gov NCT01655693), and since PACA particles accumulate in the liver [46] , they may influence the redox status of the tumor cells and contribute to cell killing by ferroptosis. Our data also suggests that exchanging the PEBCA monomer with PBCA could potentially prove even more efficient in cell killing of drug-resistant cancers. Moreover, induction of a necrotic tumor cell death such as ferroptosis could potentially contribute to higher tumor infiltration of immune cells, further contributing to tumor clearance [47] .

The microscope stage was kept at 37\u00b0C under 5% CO 2 by an incubation chamber. For detection of caspase-3/7 activity the PACA particles was added to a 4-chamber MatTek dish in the presence of the fluorogenic dye CellEvent\u2122 Caspase 3/7 Green Detection Reagent (Invitrogen), and then time-lapse images (5 z-sections 2.5 \u00b5m apart) were acquired every 10 minutes over a total time period of 18 hours.

Depletion of ATF4 in MDA-MB-231 cells further potentiated PBCA cytotoxicity at low particle concentrations (up to 25 \u00b5g/ml) (Figure 5H, Supplementary Figure 5A), indicating that ATF4 is activated as a pro-survival response. ATF4 was induced at the transcriptional level by low PBCA concentrations, reaching maximum levels at 12.5 \u00b5g/ml (Figure 5I). In line with the lower cytotoxicity of PEBCA particles, ATF4 mRNA was maximally induced at higher PEBCA concentrations (50 \u00b5g/ml) (Figure 5I). Moreover, the importance of cystine availability in PBCA/PEBCAinduced stress responses was demonstrated by the significantly higher levels of ATF4 induced under cystine starvation conditions even at low particle concentrations (Figure 5J-K).",

This demonstrates that Nrf2 protects the cells against particle-induced ferroptosis. Combined depletion of Nrf2 and ATF4 dramatically sensitized the cells towards both PEBCA and PBCA particles (",

This strongly sensitized the cells towards PEBCA and PBCA particles (Figure 6I), in a manner similar to double knockdown of Nrf2 and ATF4 (Figure 6G). In cells depleted for SLC7A11, low concentrations of PBCA/PEBCA particles potently induced cell death, in a manner fully reversed by ferroptosis inhibitors, but not z-VAD (Figure 6J-K). To confirm the importance of cystine under these conditions, the cells were treated with \uf062-mercaptoethanol, which reduces extracellular cystine to cysteine that can be imported through the LAT1 transporter (Figure 6L), thus circumventing the need for the xCT transporter. Treatment with \uf062-mercaptoethanol fully reversed the PBCA/PEBCAinduced cell death (Figure 6J-K). Taken together, PEBCA and PBCA particles affect the cellular GSH levels, and compensatory cellular stress responses are induced via activation of ATF4 or Nrf2 to regain homeostasis and prevent cell death.",
