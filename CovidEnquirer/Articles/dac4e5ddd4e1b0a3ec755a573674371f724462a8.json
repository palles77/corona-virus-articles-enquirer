Although the virus has already been isolated in 1953, in-depth research has been limited since then and was primarily motivated by sporadic outbreaks like the French island La Reunion outbreak in 2005/2006 [1] . Although CHIKV is mainly transmitted via bites of hematophagous arthropods such as mosquitoes (eg, Aedes aegypti), nonvector transmission through contaminated saliva has been reported in an experimental mouse model [2] . Therefore, additional routes of viral transmission formally cannot be excluded. Infection with CHIKV often results in acute illness characterized by the classic triad of fever, arthralgia, and rash, and it can become chronic in a subset of patients. Recent outbreaks in Southeast Asia and South America [3] as well as genetic adaptation to new vectors including Aedes albopictus [4] justify the growing perception of CHIKV as a global health concern. However, guidelines on handling contamination and occupational exposure as well as confirmed procedures of virus inactivation and disinfection have not been established to date.",

Alcohol-based disinfectants are routinely used for the decontamination of solutions, surfaces, skin, or wounds that were exposed to enveloped viruses. To evaluate the susceptibility of CHIKV to inactivation by biocides, we exposed the virus to different alcohols and commercially available alcohol-containing hand disinfectants (Supplementary Table 1 ). Specifically, 1 part virus suspension was mixed with 1 part organic load (0.3% bovine serum albumin [BSA] as interfering substance) and 8 parts disinfection solution of different concentrations. After an incubation time of 30 seconds, samples were serially diluted and the TCID 50 /mL values were determined as described above. Cytotoxic effects were monitored by microscopic analysis for altered density and morphology of the cellular monolayer and were quantified analogous to the TCID 50 /mL of the virus infectivity and was also verified by MTT assays. Strikingly, full inactivation by 1-propanol and 2-propanol was achieved at concentrations of 20% and 30%, respectively, whereas the fully effective concentration of ethanol was 40% ( Figure 1B ). In line with this observation, Sterillium classic pure and Manorapid Synergy, containing high concentrations of propanol, were more effective in disinfecting CHIKV than Desderman pure, a mainly ethanol-based hand disinfectant ( Figure 1C ). To simulate surface disinfection, we established an experimental system to test the stability on inanimate surfaces. Metal carriers providing a smooth surface were used on which virus suspension was applied. The ability of disinfectants to inactivate potentially residual infectivity of the dried virus was then monitored. The coated virus was covered with commercial surface disinfectants, and their virucidal activities were determined by a TCID 50 assay. Specifically, 9 parts of virus suspension were mixed with 1 part organic load of 0.3% BSA. Fifty microliters of this solution were pipetted onto the middle of a metal disc. After 60-minute incubation at room temperature, the dried suspension was challenged for 1 minute with 100 \u00b5L of individual surface disinfectants. We chose surface disinfectants differing in their chemical composition. Bacillol AF represents an alcohol-based disinfectant, whereas Descosept spezial contains a quarternary ammonium compound and Perform belongs to the oxygen releasing agents. Subsequently, the carrier was transferred into a tube containing 900 \u00b5L 4\u00b0C cold cell culture medium and 0.5 grams of glass beads (diameter of 0.25-0.5 mm). The glass beads were added because they help in the complete recovery of all non-inactivated virus. The virus was reconstituted into the medium by vortexing the carrier-containing tube for 1 minute. Infectivity of the treated virus suspension was determined as TCID 50 /mL in HEK293T. Although CHIKV infectivity was surprisingly resistant to air-drying, the 3 tested surface disinfectants (Bacillol AF, Descosept spezial, and 0.5% Perform) shared the ability to fully inactivate dried virus at concentrations recommended by the manufactures (Figure 1D ). To verify that the susceptibility of the HEK293T target cells for the virus infection were not negatively influenced with the treatment by the product test solution, an interference control was performed.",

The WHO formulation II, a propanol-based disinfectant, exerted a stronger antiviral effect than the ethanol-based WHO formulation I (Figure 2A and B).

            "text": "In this study, we provide a profile of the sensitivity of CHIKV against heat-mediated inactivation and chemical disinfection. Heat inactivation of CHIKV has been partially addressed in the context of serum inactivation at 56\u00b0C for 30 minutes as a firststep preparation for plaque reduction neutralization tests [11] . However, no systematic analysis of CHIKV's thermosensitivity is available. We show that CHIKV is sensitive to increasing temperatures and can be safely and quickly inactivated when treated at temperatures above 70\u00b0C for at least 1 minute. Furthermore, we demonstrate a superior virucidal effect of propanol-based disinfectants over ethanol-based solutions. The resistance of CHIKV to short-term drying is consistent with results for freeze-dried virus [12] . This finding underlines the necessity to probe existing antiviral disinfection protocols against emerging viral pathogens because this property could pose a potential risk for nonvector transmission of the virus.",
