To elucidate the functional and structure properties of I1R, we developed the newly monoclonal antibody against the N-terminal hIRAS region including the PX domain (10-120aa) through immunization of BALB/c mice with the NusA-IRAS fusion protein containing an IRAS N-terminal (10-120aa). Stable hybridoma cell lines were established and monoclonal antibodies specifically recognized full-length IRAS proteins in their native state by immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation. Monoclonal antibodies stained in a predominantly punctate cytoplasmic pattern when applied to IRAS-transfected HEK293 cells by indirect immunofluorescence assays and demonstrated excellent reactivity in flow immunocytometry. These monoclonal antibodies will provide powerful reagents for the further investigation of hIRAS protein functions.",

Based on their physiologic and pharmacological properties, imidazoline receptors are classified into three main types: I1R, I2R, and I3R [2] [3] [4] . I1R and I2R have been implicated in hypertension and psychiatric disorder regulation, respectively, while I3R may be involved in insulin secretion [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] . Compared with mitochondrial I2R, which resides within the monoamine oxidase protein [10] , the clonidine-preferring imidazoline binding sites (known as I1R) are localized to plasma membrane fractions [11, 12] and specifically to synaptic plasma membranes [13] .",

            "text": "A strong candidate for I1R, known as imidazoline receptor antisera-selected protein (IRAS), has been cloned from human hippocampus [14] . hIRAS is a larger protein of 1504 amino acids consisting of an NH 2 -terminal phox (PX) domain, 5 putative leucine-rich repeats, a predicted coiledcoil domain, and a long COOH-terminal region. Several evidence supported the identity of native I1R and IRAS protein in tissue distributions, ligand binding properties, some cellular functions and downstream signal pathways [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] . The murine form of IRAS, Nischarin, truncated at the N-terminal 244 amino acids including the PX domain compared with the hIRAS, was a soluble cytosolic protein involved in cytoskeletal organization [19] . It has been shown that decreasing the expression of rat IRAS or Nischarin in PC12 rat pheochromocytoma cells could attenuate the activation of extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) or reduce the radioligand binding to I1R, which further supported that hIRAS or Nischarin might serve as I1R itself, or at least a functional subunit of I1R [20] . Recently, Molderings et al. have reported that the \"I1-imidazoline receptors\" mediating effects of clonidine and moxonidine in PC12 and the transfected HEK293 cells belonged to the S1P-receptor family, in particular, representing a mixture of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1P)1-and S1P3-receptors and/or heterodimers of both. It was then proposed that an increased expression of IRAS or Nischarin may improve the receptor-trafficking from cytosolic S1P-receptors to the cell membrane and thereby increase the number of binding sites in the plasma membrane for radioligand binding [21] . In our previous study, we also reported that IRAS mediated agmatine-induced inhibition of opioid dependence in morphine-dependent cells [22] . Despite intensive efforts, the molecular base of the I1R had not yet been elucidated.",

Because of IRAS splice variants or nonspecificity of these antisera, more sizes of IRAS (\u224833, \u224885, \u2248170 KDa) have been visualized in various tissue and cells, which limited their uses on western blot. IRAS was reported to target to the endosomes by a combined action of a PX domain and a coiled-coil region. The PX domain, consisting of 10-130 amino acids, was first identified from the sequence analysis of two SH3 domain-containing cytosolic components of NADPH oxidase, p47phox and p40phox [24] . Therefore, in the present study, we developed the newly monoclonal antibody against the N-terminal hIRAS region including the PX domain (10-120aa) . This development has great utility for immunoblotting, indirect immunofluorescent staining, immunoprecipitation, and flow cytometry. These monoclonal antibodies will provide powerful reagents for the further investigation of hIRAS protein functions.",

The pEGFPC1-IRAS plasmid was transfected into HEK293 cells. IRAS protein localization was tested by fluorescence confocal microscopy after 48 hours transfection. GFP-IRAS was primarily located in the cytoplasm in a punctate pattern (Figure 3(a) ) with concentration onto discrete loci and spot fluorescence (panel A, E, I, Journal of Biomedicine and Biotechnology M, and Q), as confirmed in previous studies [30] . The mAbs DA041, DD015, and BE073 were used as probes to detect a predominantly punctate cytosolic distribution as expected (panel B, F, G). However, the mAb BA022 homogenously detected the fluorescence distribution over the cytoplasm (panel N) and the mAb AH021 scored negatively (panel R). Merged images revealed that the GFP-IRAS fluorescence significantly coincided with the immunostaining with mAbs DA041, DD015, and BE073 (panel D, H, and L), but was not reflected by the mAbs BA022 and AH021 (panel P and T). Further, the punctate fluorescence patterns appeared to be unique to the mAbs DA041, DD015, and BE073. In addition, we also detected the endogenous IRAS protein with monoclonal antibody DA041 in PC12 cells, showing a strong signal associated with the membrane and faint signal in the cytoplasm (data not shown). These results suggest that the 3 mAbs specifically detect IRAS proteins by immunofluorescence, similar to immunoblotting results. Flow cytometry is a rapid, quantitative, multiparameter cellular analysis based on the measurement of visible and fluorescent light emission. We chose the representative mAb DA041 for further characterization based on the strong signals detected by immunoblotting and immunofluorescence. The IRAS cDNA was cloned into the mammalian expression vector PCMV-myc and was expressed in HEK293 cells. The mAb DA041 and the c-myc mAb (used as a positive control) resulted in significant increases in fluorescence intensity when compared to cells incubated with preimmune serum (Figure 3(b) ). The binding efficiencies were 30.77% by the mAb DA041 and 48.26% by the c-myc mAb. No reactivities were detectable in preimmune sera (0.01%).

(b) The whole cell extracts derived from HEK293 cells were transfected with pEGFPC1-IRAS and the control vector pEGFPC1 plasmid, respectively. Cell lysates were prepared 48 hours after transfection and were separated by SDS-PAGE. Proteins transferred to PVDF membranes were probed with anti-GFP antibody or the mAbs DA041, DD015, BE073, BA022, and AH021. Sizes (kDa) of molecular mass marker were indicated on the left side.",

Cellular localization of IRAS was observed by scanning fluorescence confocal microscopy. Green represented EGFP fluorescence (A, E, I, M, and Q) from the GFP-IRAS fusion protein, blue (C, G, K, O, and S) fluorescence represented Hoechst stained cell nuclei, red (B, F, J, N, and R) fluorescence represented cells expressing GFP-IRAS labeled with TRITC-conjugated goat antimouse antibody using IRAS mAbs as the primary antibody, and yellow (D, H, L, P, and T) represented overlapping green and red fluorescence. All 3 panels had the same field of view. Scale bar, 100 \u03bcm. (b) Samples were collected and separately analyzed by flow cytometry for the ability to bind the preimmune serum (control), the c-myc mAb, and the mAb DA041 after 48 hours transfection of PCMV-myc-IRAS. Results were expressed as histograms with the DNA content on x-axis and the number of fluorescent cells on y-axis. Cells were distributed in 2 populations, and the second population (R2) with high fluorescence reflected the population of transfected cells recognized by the mAb DA041. Analysis of immunoprecipitates revealed that the IRAS mAbs specifically recognized the native state of the IRAS protein. The HEK293 cells were transiently transfected with the empty vector PCMV-myc (negative control) and PCMV-myc-IRAS. Whole cell lysates were prepared and immunoprecipitated with the c-myc mAb or the mAbs DA041, DD015, BE073, BA022, and AH021. Immunoprecipitation of the same lysates using mouse normal IgG did not result in the detection of any protein species. Immunocomplexes were analyzed by western blot with indicated antibodies.",
