Methods and Materials: A total of 182 patients with a primary diagnosis of prostate, breast, or lung cancer referred for consultation to the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute Department of Radiation Oncology enrolled in our institutional review board-approved protocol. All patients completed patient preference instrument surveys before meeting their radiation oncologist. Survey responses to 10 statements were categorized into three groups (agree, neutral, or disagree), and the association of survey responses by cancer site was tested with chi-squared tests. Results: Ninety-nine percent of all patients preferred to be addressed by their first name in encounters with their radiation oncologist. There were significant associations of Item 3 (hand holding) with gender (p = 0.039) and education (p = 0.028). The responses to Item 5, a statement that patients would feel uncomfortable if the radiation oncologist offered to hug them at the end of treatment, was significantly associated with disease site (p < 0.0001). Further analysis was performed for Item 5 and revealed that the male lung cancer patients had a much higher rate of disagreement with Item 5 compared with prostate cancer patients (37% vs. 18%). Conclusions: Results of this study may afford greater insight and foster better understanding of what patients want from their radiation oncologist. For breast, lung, and prostate cancer patients, initial preferences for their radiation oncologist are generally similar, according to this tool. However, there are important difference among cancer sites (and gender) regarding physical contact at the end of treatment. \u00d3 2007 Elsevier Inc.",

When first diagnosed, cancer patients are often overwhelmed with a life-threatening diagnosis. Patients struggle with loss of control and are further burdened by the psychological impact of the diagnosis. Their primary care physician and medical oncologist may be readily available, but by virtue of the daily radiation treatments, commonly for 6-8 weeks, the radiation oncologist has the unique opportunity to develop a strong bond with patients and gain their trust to serve as their leader through a complex treatment regimen.",

However, depending on the individual patient, these same actions may also have an adverse affect and make the patient feel uncomfortable, causing them to mentally and emotionally distance themselves from their radiation oncologist. Physicians may also be concerned that unwanted, unnecessary physical contact with patients could be interpreted as sexual harassment.

This study used a survey instrument consisting of 10 questions focusing on certain aspects of the patient-radiation oncologist interaction, such as the professional image of the radiation oncologist, communication with the radiation oncologist, and physical and emotional behavior between the patient and the radiation oncologist (Appendix). The survey was developed by the authors and was then tested, critiqued, and modified on the basis of a sample focus group of breast, lung, and prostate cancer patients under a separate IRB-approved study (IRB no. 0512075). The focus groups established the content validity (relevance and coverage) of the items.

In the control group, the radiation oncologist participant was blind to the results of their patient's questionnaire. At the end of treatment the patients completed a satisfaction survey, which was a modified version of an established, validated instrument currently being used at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute to assess patient/subject satisfaction. The radiation oncologist participant did not have access to the patient satisfaction survey. For this report, data from only the first time point (before consultation with the radiation oncologist) for both arms were analyzed. Eligibility of patients was determined according to disease site, including age >18 years with lung, breast, or prostate malignancies, referred for radiation oncology consultation at the University of Pittsburgh Cancer Institute.

Schafer used a developed patient questionnaire to determine the ideal amount of information physicians should share with patients. At the beginning and end of their radiation oncology treatment, 51 German patients completed this questionnaire. Compared with curatively treated patients, there was a significant decrease in satisfaction among palliative patients. Schafer et al. stressed the importance of providing adequate information in the management of oncology patients. They state, ''The radiation oncologist needs to discuss radiation therapy in general, to describe the treatment goal and the side effects of radiotherapy, as well as to discuss treatment alternatives.'' (12) In an Australian study, Zissiadis et al. (13) evaluate the process of developing a successful satisfaction questionnaire for long-term use with radiation oncology patients. This study enrolled 120 patients. The majority of patients claimed to be satisfied or very satisfied with the explanation of their radiation toxicities. Fewer patients were satisfied with the explanation of lifestyle and practical issues than with the explanation of the treatment plan and side effects. After the study, the Perth Radiation and Oncology Center in Australia developed and began distributing information booklets addressing lifestyle and practical issues.",

The goal of this study was to obtain information for future use by radiation oncology centers during times of infectious disease precautionary control. The study found that, ''despite the high satisfaction levels with SARS precautions, 24% of patients believed that the precautionary measures adversely affected the doctor patient interaction.'' A significant portion of patients were upset by the possible delay, restrictions on patient visitors, and lack of physical contact, such as shaking hands as a greeting, which resulted from the precautionary measures. The study also found that age and type of cancer were both predictive factors for patients' dissatisfaction. Older patients were less likely to feel satisfied with the amount of information given to them, although this is also likely affected by cultural factors. In addition, non-breast cancer patients were less satisfied with the doctor-patient interaction, which Tang et al. postulate may be owing to more time spent counseling breast cancer patients compared with other cancer patients.",

Interestingly, the response to Item 5, which dealt with physical contact after the completion of radiation treatment, was associated with cancer site and gender. Because cancer sites correlated with gender for breast and prostate cancer, we performed a subset analysis of lung cancer to determine any unique associations for cancer site compared with gender. Subset analysis of cancer sites revealed that male lung cancer patients had a much higher rate of disagreement compared with prostate cancer patients (37% vs. 18%). A possible hypothesis for this distinction between male lung and prostate cancer patients is the increased emotional needs for lung cancer patients due to the poorer prognosis compared with prostate cancer. This finding will be validated once the study has completed its planned accrual of 500 patients.",

Another limitation of this study is that these patient preferences may not be representative of the U.S. population but only representative of the regional population.

All patients were randomized according to whether their radiation oncologist was blinded or unblinded to their patients' initial survey responses. Our hypothesis is that patients who were randomized to the nonblinded cohort (in which physicians had access to their responses) would have a greater satisfaction score than pa-tients whose radiation oncologists were blinded to the patient preference survey responses.
