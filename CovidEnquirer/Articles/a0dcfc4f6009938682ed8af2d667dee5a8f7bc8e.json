            "text": "A thorough knowledge of pulmonary anatomy and physiology is essential to the practicing anesthesiologist, who should be familiar with common clinical conditions such as chronic obstructive lung disease (COPD) and asthma. This chapter presents a comprehensive review of less common pulmonary conditions, organized anatomically (pulmonary vasculature, airways, pulmonary interstitium), and conditions extrinsic to the lungs that affect pulmonary function, such as severe arthritic disorders. Drug-induced lung injury is also discussed, followed by rare infectious pulmonary diseases, including influenza A (H1N1), severe acute respiratory syndrome, and echinococcal disease of the lung. Many of these conditions are severe, and some are difficult to diagnose. Patients with pulmonary disease may present with varied symptoms, including productive or nonproductive cough, fever, shortness of breath, chest pain, and decreased exercise tolerance. In most circumstances, patients who have these conditions will already be under the care of an internist or pulmonary specialist. The patient evaluation necessary to arrive at an accurate diagnosis often is comprehensive, including detailed history and physical examination; chest radiograph; pulmonary function tests (PFTs), including spirometry, diffusing capacity, and lung volume determination; and perhaps arterial blood gas (ABG) analysis. For some conditions, bronchoscopy and biopsy may be performed, and others require echocardiography or cardiac catheterization for diagnostic certainty. For urgent or emergent surgery, the gravity of the clinical situation often precludes additional diagnostic assessment. For elective surgery, preoperative evaluation should include a review of these diagnostic studies and a determination as to whether the patient's clinical condition has changed substantially. If a diagnosis has already been established, there is no evidence to suggest that additional pulmonary testing will improve pulmonary outcomes after surgery. Spirometry and lung volume determination are the \"gold standards\" for the presence or absence of pulmonary disease, but are poor predictors of patients who will develop a pulmonary complication after surgery. 1 If a diagnosis has not been established in a patient who has symptoms consistent with one of these respiratory diseases, pulmonary consultation should be obtained preoperatively as the patient's pulmonary disorder may be more urgent than an elective surgical procedure.",

[2] [3] [4] [5] Pre-existing lung disease, smoking, congestive heart failure, American Society of Anesthesiologists (ASA) classification, obesity, obstructive sleep apnea, anesthetic time in excess of 180 minutes, and advanced age are also risk factors for pulmonary complications. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] There is no standard definition of exactly what constitutes a pulmonary complication, but the most important complications are those that cause significant morbidity (e.g., postoperative pneumonia) and postoperative respiratory failure. Because all the disorders discussed in this chapter constitute pre-existing lung disease, patients with these disorders who come to the operating room are at increased risk of postoperative pulmonary complications. Effective preoperative and intraoperative treatments are discussed with the individual diseases. In the postoperative period, aggressive treatment with mechanical measures such as incentive spirometry can reduce pulmonary complications. 10, 11 Other intraoperative interventions, such as laparoscopic surgery, nasogastric tube decompression, and shorter-acting neuromuscular blockade, may also be beneficial. 12, 13 ",

Surgical preoperative evaluation requires chest computed tomographic angiography (CTA) or pulmonary arteriography to localize the lesion. Pulmonary lobectomy, segmentectomy, or wedge resection using thoracotomy or video-assisted thoracoscopic surgery (VATS) are the most common procedures. Embolization procedures are becoming the preferred treatment for the majority of patients because embolization is less invasive, is easily repeated, and may be an adjuvant to decrease bleeding and other complications during definitive surgical resection. 15, 16 Anesthetic evaluation focuses on the degree of shunt and hypoxemia, using ABG analysis. Review of the pulmonary angiogram will reveal the size of the lesion and whether multiple fistulas are present. A significant fistula in the nonoperative lung may compromise arterial oxygenation if one-lung ventilation is required for surgical exposure. Efforts to minimize flow through a pulmonary AV fistula involve avoiding both increased pulmonary vascular resistance (PVR) and elevated levels of positive end-expiratory pressure (PEEP), both of which will increase flow through the low-resistance fistula.",

A double-lumen endotracheal tube (ETT) provides the added benefit of isolating the nonoperative lung and airways from any bleeding, which may occur during a potentially bloody resection. The risk of significant bleeding is decreased if the lesion has been embolized before resection. Large-bore intravenous (IV) access is recommended in the event significant hemorrhage occurs. An arterial catheter is also indicated to monitor oxygenation and guide resuscitative efforts. As mentioned, an important anesthetic goal is to minimize flow through the pulmonary AV fistula. AV fistulas do not have capillary beds and have lower resistance to blood flow than normal pulmonary vasculature. It is important to avoid a general increase in PVR because this will increase flow through the AV fistula. Similarly, minimizing the use of PEEP will minimize increases in PVR and help minimize blood flow through the fistula. Because of the risk of paradoxical emboli passing through the fistula, extra caution must be taken to avoid injection of any air or particulate material into the venous system, because such debris may bypass the pulmonary capillary bed and gain access to systemic arteries, where endorgan embolization can occur (Box 4-3).",

Respiratory compromise increases the risk of hypoxia under general anesthesia, or if the patient hypoventilates secondary to sedating agents used for premedication or for monitored anesthesia care. If general anesthesia is chosen, the potential for postoperative intubation and respiratory support should be addressed with the patient. The need for postoperative mechanical ventilation is more likely in patients who have advanced disease with extensive destruction of lung tissue, pleural effusions, or pneumothorax. There is no clear answer to which anesthetic technique is superior, and the approach should be tailored to the individual patient's comorbidities and the surgical procedure.

The prevalence of PPH is thought to be approximately 1:1 million, with women being twice as likely as men to present with the disease. Some cases appear to be genetically linked. 24 Overall, PPH is more severe and aggressive than secondary pulmonary hypertension. Vascular remodeling, an alteration in pulmonary vascular tone, and a loss of cross-sectional pulmonary arterial area are responsible for the increase in PVR seen in this disease. Dyspnea is the most common presenting symptom, and syncope is a particularly poor prognostic sign (Box 4-8). Rightto-left shunting may occur in the 30% of patients with a patent foramen ovale (PFO). Death typically results from hypoxia, a further increase in pulmonary artery pressure (PAP), and eventually right ventricular (RV) failure. 25 Historically, treatment for PPH relied on oxygen and calcium channel blockers in an effort to decrease PVR (Table 4-1 ). In addition, warfarin (Coumadin) is used to reduce the risk of thromboembolism resulting from the enhanced platelet activity seen in PPH. Pulmonary embolism or primary pulmonary vascular thrombosis is poorly tolerated in this patient population. Diuretics and digoxin are also employed when RV failure ensues. More recently, prostaglandins (PGI 2 , PGE 1 ; alprostadil) BOX and nitric oxide (NO), alone or in combination, have been used to induce pulmonary vasodilation, with minimal systemic effects. 24, 26 Currently, prostacyclins must be delivered by continuous IV infusion because of their short half-life. NO is delivered by inhalation and requires a tank and delivery system. Phosphodiesterase-5 inhibitors such as sildenafil and dipyridamole potentiate the NO-induced pulmonary vasodilation and can be used separately or in combination. 24 Unfortunately, cost and unwieldy delivery systems have limited the use of these therapies to the short term or the most severe cases. New approaches to delivering PGI 2 are under development, including the inhaled, subcutaneous, and oral routes. A newer agent, bosentan, an oral endothelin receptor antagonist thought to inhibit smooth muscle vasoconstriction and proliferation, is now approved by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to treat PPH. 24, 27 Adjunctive therapy with bosentan has demonstrated promise when combined with prostacyclin therapy. 26, 27 Preoperative studies focus on the severity of PPH, degree of hypoxia, and resulting effects on the heart (Table 4 -2). ABG analysis elucidates the level of hypoxia and acidemia, both of which exacerbate pulmonary hypertension. A chest radiograph may reveal enlarged main pulmonary arteries or an enlarged heart caused by RV hypertrophy or right atrial dilation. An electrocardiogram (ECG) may also reveal changes consistent with pulmonary hypertension (e.g., right atrial enlargement), as well as the presence of abnormal cardiac rhythm (e.g., atrial fibrillation). Sinus rhythm is essential to adequate RV filling. Preoperative echocardiography is helpful in determining the extent of RV hypertrophy and function, right atrial enlargement, pulmonic or tricuspid valve dysfunction, and patency of the foramen ovale. Pulmonary systolic pressures may be estimated by Doppler techniques. A more accurate but much more invasive method of measuring pulmonary pressures, gauging response to therapies, and detecting a PFO is rightsided heart catheterization. This procedure should be considered only if other studies have not provided an adequate assessment of disease severity and is not typically needed for preanesthetic evaluation. The patient treated with digoxin should have serum potassium and digoxin levels measured.",

This causes airway obstruction and impaired defense against bacterial infection, which results in the majority of deaths related to CF. Recurrent bacterial infections result in dilation of the conducting airways, leading to bronchiectasis. 29 Although CF is a chronic progressive disease, the extent of current pulmonary infection fluctuates, creating significant daily variability in a patient's pulmonary function. Eventually, as the disease progresses, there is destruction of parenchyma and conduction airways. Loss of pulmonary arterial vascular cross-sectional area results in pulmonary hypertension. Chronic hypoxemia also develops. Patients with more advanced CF may develop spontaneous pneumothorax. The etiology of pneumothorax is unknown but presumably involves rupture of subpleural blebs through the visceral pleura. This becomes more likely in advanced disease. Over a lifetime, the incidence of pneumothorax may be as high as 20% in adult CF patients. Application of PPV can increase the risk of spontaneous pneumothorax. In the event of pneumothorax, surgical pleurodesis is the treatment of choice for CF patients who have a low anesthetic risk; higher-risk patients frequently receive talc pleurodesis as a safer, yet less effective, alternative. 30 Ventilation/ perfusion inequality results in hypoxemia. The chronic hypoxia seen in this population causes an increase in PVR and pulmonary hypertension. Loss of pulmonary arterial vascular cross-sectional area also causes increased PVR and pulmonary hypertension, which is exacerbated by chronic hypoxemia. The severity of pulmonary hypertension correlates with the severity of CF. Chronic pulmonary vasoconstriction (from hypoxia) results in a muscularization of the pulmonary arterial vascular tree, which results in cor pulmonale, although the initial enlargement of the right ventricle is considered a beneficial adaptation to the increased resistance to pulmonary blood flow. The only medical therapy effective in treating pulmonary hypertension and improving RV performance in this population is supplemental oxygen. 31 Although lung transplantation has been successful with a 2-year survival of greater than 50%, about 40% of patients do not survive awaiting the transplant due to organ shortage. 28 The primary gastrointestinal manifestation of CF is malabsorption and steatorrhea caused by pancreatic dysfunction from obstruction of pancreatic ducts with viscous exocrine secretions, usually requiring pancreatic enzyme replacements as well as multivitamins. Malnutrition and deficiencies of fatsoluble vitamins such as vitamin K can increase the patient's risk of bleeding if this issue is not addressed. Glucose intolerance resulting from pancreatic dysfunction (impaired endocrine function) is also common and may require insulin therapy. CF patients also have an increased incidence of gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). 32 Preparation for anesthesia should focus on evaluation of the CF patient's pulmonary status. Significant variation in symptoms and disease severity from increased respiratory secretions or infection can be seen in a patient from one day to the next. Surgery should be postponed, if possible, unless the patient is at a baseline level of health. Preoperative testing should include a recent chest radiograph to diagnose pneumothorax, pneumonic processes, or bullous disease. In one series of patients with CF, 16% had an asymptomatic pneumothorax. Thus, chest radiography is essential in these patients. 30 Coagulation studies such as prothrombin time and partial thromboplastin time can provide information regarding coagulopathy resulting from vitamin K deficiency or general malnutrition. Sedating premedications should be given only if absolutely necessary, because of the risk of exacerbating pre-existing respiratory compromise, and only then under close observation with administration of supplemental oxygen to minimize the risk of desaturation. All CF patients should be questioned regarding symptoms consistent with GERD. If present, appropriate premedications and aspiration precautions such as a rapid-sequence induction should be considered, although CF patients may desaturate rapidly when apneic.",

This increases the risk of recurrence. Treatments with plasmapheresis, azathioprine, and cyclophosphamide have been attempted with some success, but these therapies are generally reserved for patients refractory to corticosteroid therapy. Definitive therapy is offered by double-lung transplantation, although there is a case report of recurrence of IPH 40 months after transplantation. 35 Evaluation of ongoing alveolar hemorrhage and quantification of the extent of any fibrotic changes is essential for a complete preoperative assessment. The presence of dyspnea or hemoptysis provides a starting point. Gas exchange is impaired by ongoing alveolar hemorrhage, and there is an increased need for transfusion in the perioperative period because of the acute and chronic loss of red blood cells. It is prudent to postpone elective surgery until active alveolar hemorrhage resolves. Evaluating recent chest radiographs for bilateral alveolar infiltrates or new or changing infiltrates will help identify ongoing alveolar hemorrhage.

Confirmation of correct positioning of the ETT by fiberoptic visualization is essential.

The nonventilated lung is then lavaged repeatedly with saline while the ipsilateral chest wall is mechanically percussed. The procedure is repeated until the drained saline is almost clear, indicating removal of the majority of the lipoproteinaceous material. The BPL fluid should be warmed to decrease the risk of hypothermia and the volume of the drainage and presence of bubbles closely monitored, to ensure isolation of the contralateral lung. Oxygenation may improve during the instillation of fluid as alveolar pressure increases. This results in decreased perfusion to the lavaged lung (which is not being ventilated) and thus improves overall ventilation/perfusion matching. Hypoxia is most likely to occur during the drainage phases of the procedure, when an increase in intrapulmonary shunting occurs because of the dramatic drop in alveolar pressure. Significant hemodynamic changes can also occur during the infusion of saline into the lung. Hypotension and an increase in central venous pressure or pulmonary capillary wedge pressure may be seen. TEE suggests these changes are caused by impaired venous return to the left side of the heart. 45 Presumably, saline infusion compresses alveolar capillaries, increasing PVR and resulting in increased central venous pressure, while also causing decreased left-sided heart output because of decreased blood flow to the left ventricle.

PFTs frequently demonstrate restrictive disease with decreased lung volumes and diffusion capacity. In some cases an obstructive pattern may also be present because of airway narrowing. In more advanced cases, ABG analysis reveals hypoxemia and an increased alveolar-arterial gradient. A significant number of sarcoid patients have cardiac symptoms resulting from myocardial granulomas or the effects of respiratory system disease on the heart. Possible findings include conduction abnormalities (complete heart block, bundle branch block, or first-degree AV block), ventricular arrhythmias, CHF, pericarditis, supraventricular tachycardia, ventricular aneurysms, and sudden death. 46 Neurologic findings in sarcoid patients are uncommon, although all the nervous system is at risk. Possible manifestations of neurologic involvement include seizures, progressive dementia, diabetes insipidus, hydrocephalus, and acute mononeuropathy. Facial nerve neuropathy is the most common of the neurologic lesions and usually has a benign course. 47 The airways are involved in approximately 5% of patients with sarcoidosis. 48 Symptoms may include dyspnea, dysphagia, throat pain, hoarseness, a weak voice, or stridor. Most lesions are supraglottic and involve the epiglottis, aryepiglottic folds, and arytenoids. 49 These lesions may result in airway compromise and, rarely, the need for tracheostomy. Vocal cord paralysis has also been reported, from recurrent laryngeal neuropathy caused by sarcoid mediastinal lymphadenopathy. 50 Encountering a pregnant patient with a history of sarcoid is not unusual, because sarcoid occurs with an increased frequency in women of childbearing age. In general, however, pregnancy tends to improve sarcoid-related symptoms, presumably because of increased cortisol levels during pregnancy. 51 Corticosteroids are often required to treat sarcoid and, regardless of the lack of correlative data, remain the standard of care. Systemic corticosteroids appear to improve or shorten the length of most symptoms related to sarcoidosis. The relapsing, remitting nature of the disease makes it difficult to verify the efficacy of this treatment. Data are limited correlating oral steroids and improved lung function. 52, 53 Remission occurs within 3 years from diagnosis for more than half of patients with sarcoidosis. 54 As is often the case, early diagnosis and treatment appear to improve the likelihood of successful treatment. Radiation therapy and immunosuppressants such as cyclophosphamide and azathioprine may also be used. Anti-inflammatory agents, such as anti-tumor necrosis factor (anti-TNF) therapy (adalimumab) currently are in clinical trials. 54 Serial chest radiographs, PFTs, and serum angiotensinconverting enzyme (ACE) levels can be used to follow the progress of a patient. Serum ACE appears to be synthesized within sarcoid granulomas. High levels are associated with more severe pulmonary infiltration, and lower levels are seen with disease inactivity. Trends within a given patient are more important than the absolute level of ACE. Cardiac rhythm abnormalities can result from sarcoid heart disease and may necessitate placement of a pacemaker or implantable cardiac defibrillator, as well as other treatment for arrhythmias, cardiomyopathy, and heart failure.",

A typical patient is a middle-aged man. Diagnosis is based on the histologic pattern of usual interstitial pneumonia and exclusion of other causes of this histologic pattern. Extrapulmonary involvement does not occur. The presentation is insidious and typically involves dyspnea and a nonproductive cough. Physical examination frequently reveals fine crackles at the lung bases, expanding upward as the disease progresses. Clubbing, cyanosis, peripheral edema, and cor pulmonale are later findings. There must be a restrictive pattern on spirometry and radiologic changes on chest radiography or high-resolution CT consistent with the diagnosis. 61 Patients with IPF also have an increased incidence of pulmonary malignancy. Unfortunately, it is unclear if resection of these lesions adds to life expectancy in this population. 62 No effective treatment is currently available, although corticosteroid and cytotoxic agents are frequently used. Many novel therapies attempt to block fibrogenic pathways and may be of benefit (Table 4-6) . 63 Lung transplantation is the only therapeutic option available for IPF patients. Although thought to be effective, there is still only a 49% survival rate 5 years after transplantation. 64 The median survival time is 2 to 3 years from time of diagnosis. 65 Patients with IPF presenting for surgery typically are tachypneic and cyanotic and appear to be in poor health. Preoperative evaluation should include a review of recent spirometry and other PFTs. A decrease in lung volumes with a reduction in diffusion capacity is expected. Ventilation/perfusion inequality and impaired diffusion result in hypoxemia. In patients with advanced disease, echocardiography may reveal pulmonary hypertension and cor pulmonale. IPF patients seem to have a very high incidence of GERD. 66 It is appropriate to consider premedication to reduce gastric volume and acidity, as well as an anesthetic technique to minimize the risk of pulmonary aspiration of gastric contents. An aspiration event in such a patient could easily be fatal. Placement of an intra-arterial catheter is advised for all but the most vigorous of these patients undergoing minor surgery (see .",

            "text": "Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) is a severe form of acute lung injury resulting from an underlying illness or lung injury. ARDS may occur in as many as 10 to 20 per 100,000 individuals. 67 Several disorders are implicated as risk factors for developing ARDS, through direct lung injury or a systemic inflammatory response (Table 4-7) . The underlying lesion is injury to the alveolar-capillary membrane and increased membrane permeability. Proteinaceous edema fluid accumulates in the alveoli, resulting in impaired oxygenation and poorly compliant (stiff) lungs. ARDS develops acutely over 1 to 2 days. If a patient is alert and spontaneously ventilating, anxiety and dyspnea will be the earliest signs. As inflammatory changes occur, tachypnea and increased work of breathing will be noted. Mechanical ventilation is required to maintain oxygenation. Chest radiographs typically reveal diffuse bilateral alveolar infiltrates similar to the findings of pulmonary edema. There is no laboratory test to diagnose ARDS. As a clinical diagnosis, criteria for diagnosing ARDS are acute onset of respiratory distress requiring intubation and mechanical ventilation; a Pao 2 /Fio 2 ratio of less than 200, a chest radiograph with bilateral infiltrates suggestive of pulmonary edema, and no evidence of CHF or, if measured, a pulmonary artery wedge pressure less than 18 mm Hg. 68 Although it has declined over the past 10 years, ARDS still has a high mortality rate of 25% to 35%. Patients who do survive generally return to a pulmonary function near their baseline. Any remaining defect is likely restrictive or involving decreased diffusion capacity, and more disabling sequelae are possible. 69 Intraoperative management of ARDS is an extension of the patient's ICU care. Many patients have a severe underlying injury or illness, which also requires significant perioperative attention. The approach to ventilator management plays a significant role in ARDS mortality. Instituting low-tidal volume ventilation of 6 mL/kg (predicted body weight) and maintaining plateau pressures of less than 30 cm H 2 O were found to reduce mortality by almost 20%. 70, 71 This approach may result in hypercapnia and respiratory acidosis, which can be monitored and treated with sodium bicarbonate. Permissive hypercapnia is usually well tolerated and may reduce mortality from lung injury. 72 There is no clear evidence to support that pressure-cycled ventilation is superior to volume-cycled ventilation.",

Invasive monitors will frequently be in place when the patient arrives in the OR; if not, an intra-arterial catheter should be inserted. For procedures involving major fluid shifts, placement of a PAC or use of TEE may be helpful in guiding resuscitation and avoiding overzealous fluid administration, which might adversely impact the patient's respiratory status. However, ARDS patients in an ICU do not have better outcomes when managed with a PAC as opposed to a central venous catheter. 73 Neutral fluid balance can also benefit patients with ARDS, although appropriate fluid resuscitation and maintenance of vital organ perfusion usually preclude such an intraoperative fluid management strategy.

Reticulonodular infiltrates, upper-lobe and middle-lobe cysts, and stellate nodules with sparing of the costophrenic angle on chest radiography highly suggest PHX; bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) or biopsy confirms the diagnosis. Results of spirometry may yield an obstructive, restrictive, mixed, or normal pattern. A decrease in diffusion capacity appears to be the most consistent finding. Physical limitation in PHX patients is frequently out of proportion to spirometry results, and pulmonary hypertension may play a significant role in contributing to diminished exercise capacity. In advanced disease, pulmonary artery pressures in the range of 60 mm Hg are not unusual. 74 The course of PHX is unpredictable. Improvement or complete remission may occur spontaneously or as the result of smoking cessation. A minority of patients progress to pulmonary fibrosis. Age at presentation (>26 years), forced expiratory volume in 1 second/forced viral capacity (FEV 1 /FVC) ratio less than 0.66, and right ventricular/total lung capacity (RV/TLC) ratio greater than 0.33 are cited as predictors of advanced disease and increased mortality. 75 Corticosteroids and chemotherapeutic agents are used in attempts to treat PHX, but the disease is frequently refractory to treatment. Lung transplantation has been performed with success, although PHX has recurred in the transplanted lungs of patients who had extrapulmonary involvement and had resumed smoking. 76 Patients who are in remission or have only mild symptoms do not require special preoperative evaluation or intraoperative management beyond that warranted by the scheduled procedure. In patients with more advanced disease, a review of PFT results and ABG analysis and evaluation of pulmonary pressures by echocardiography or direct measurement are recommended. Based on these results, intraoperative management should be tailored to avoid increases in pulmonary artery pressure. Placement of a PAC may be necessary to help achieve this goal. The risk of pneumothorax in this population warrants an effort to minimize peak airway pressures. If diabetes insipidus is present, treatment with desmopressin should be continued perioperatively. The potential for pathologic fractures from cystic bone lesions requires special attention to patient positioning and padding. As in all patients with pulmonary disability preoperatively, the potential for postoperative ventilatory support should be factored into the anesthetic plan and discussed in advance with the patient (see Box 4-10).",

LAM occurs in women of reproductive age and is exacerbated by pregnancy. It also occurs in male and female patients with tuberous sclerosis. The condition results from the proliferation of interstitial smooth muscle and formation of cysts, which obliterate and obstruct the airways. Complaints of dyspnea are the typical presenting symptom. Individuals with LAM develop hyperinflated lungs with an increased total lung capacity. They also develop an obstructive pattern on spirometry. Spontaneous pneumothorax caused by cyst rupture is common. Obstruction and eventual rupture of the thoracic duct, resulting in chylothorax, is another manifestation of LAM. Hemoptysis occurs infrequently. Chest radiographs are normal appearing early in the disease but resemble those of end-stage emphysema in advanced disease. Reticulonodular opacities may also be seen. An obstructive or occasionally a mixed pattern is present on spirometry, along with a significant decrease in diffusion capacity. Exercise capacity will be severely decreased because of ventilation/perfusion inequality and increased work of breathing. 77 ABG analysis typically reveals a decrease in Po 2 and Pco 2 , although pH is normal. 78 Estrogen is thought to play a role in the development of LAM because of its almost exclusive occurrence in women of childbearing age, its exacerbation by pregnancy, and presence of estrogen receptors on biopsy tissue. Recently, rapamycin (sirolimus) has been suggested as a therapeutic option for LAM. The results are not consistent, and some studies show significant reduction in size of angiomyolipomas and improvement of lung function. 79 Corticosteroids are ineffective. Modalities to block the molecular effects of estrogen (e.g., doxycycline) have been somewhat more successful. These approaches include oophorectomy, progesterone, and tamoxifen. Lung transplantation is offered to patients with advanced disease, although this is frequently complicated by diseaseassociated problems such as pleural adhesions, postoperative chylothorax, pneumothorax, and recurrent LAM. 79 Lung transplant may be considered as an option for end-stage pulmonary LAM. Survival after lung transplant is 79% at 1 year and 73% at 3 years. 80 Preoperative evaluation should include a review of recent PFTs and chest radiographs, as well as ABG analysis in advanced cases. Elective surgery should be postponed until after significant chylothorax, if present, can be drained and chest tubes inserted to resolve existing pneumothoraces. Recurrent leakage of lymph results in an impaired immune response and nutritional wasting, which increase the patient's risk of perioperative complications and should be addressed before surgery by enteral or parenteral nutritional support. For patients with advanced disease, ventilator management should be similar to that for a patient with severe emphysema, including prolonged expiratory time and avoidance of high inspiratory pressure. Postoperative ventilatory support may be required if the patient has severe underlying disease and is undergoing major or extensive surgery. Placement of an intraarterial catheter is helpful in obtaining serial ABGs to guide ventilator management (see .",

For this reason, cyclo-oxygenase (COX-2) inhibitors have been increasingly used as an alternative. The controversy regarding the cardiovascular safety of COX-2 inhibitors indicates careful consideration of the risks and benefits. Sulfasalazine, methotrexate, and corticosteroids are used in severe cases. Most recently, more than a third of AkS patients were in remission after 5 years of continuous TNF inhibitors therapy. 84, 85 ANESTHESIA MANAGEMENT A patient with advanced AkS presents a significant challenge to the anesthesiologist, frequently needing orthopedic procedures on the hips and knees (Box 4-12). Preoperative evaluation should include radiographs of the lower and cervical spine to assess the extent of fusion. Caution should be exercised when instrumenting the airway because of involvement of the cervical spine. Decreased range of motion and poor mouth opening can make direct laryngoscopy difficult, and excess force applied to the neck can result in cervical fracture. Atlantoaxial subluxation is also present in a subset of these patients. 86 If advanced disease is present, an alternative and conservative approach to airway management (including an awake intubation) is strongly recommended, preferably one that maintains spontaneous ventilation. Adjuncts such as a laryngeal mask airway (LMA), videolaryngoscope, and fiberoptic bronchoscope should be readily available. Neuraxial anesthesia is very challenging in AkS patients. The ossification of spinal ligaments significantly narrows or even closes the intervertebral space and prevents optimal positioning. Alternatives reported as successful include a lateral approach to spinal placement 87 and placement of caudal catheters. 88 Intraoperative management must include special attention to positioning because of the inflexibility of the AkS patient's spine. Diaphragmatic function should be optimized during spontaneous ventilation because of a restrictive thoracic cage. This can be accomplished by avoiding the Trendelenburg position and using large-diameter ETTs when possible. Interscalene blocks can result in short-term ipsilateral diaphragmatic paralysis and should be avoided. Higher peak pressures may occur with PPV and are expected. Adequate ventilation during laparoscopic surgery may not be possible, and hypercarbia may develop; if not excessive, it can be tolerated until the end of the procedure. Strictest extubation criteria should be observed in patients with AkS, because their heavy reliance on diaphragmatic function increases their risk of postoperative respiratory insufficiency, and emergent reintubation carries a significant risk of morbidity and failure.",

These procedures frequently involve significant blood loss, possible one-lung ventilation, and the need for deliberate hypotension. The patients have underlying pulmonary restrictive disease. All of these factors make arterial line placement and ABG analysis critical to effective perioperative management. The presence of restrictive lung disease combined with prone or lateral positioning can make oxygenation and ventilation with acceptable peak airway pressures challenging. The use of an anesthesia machine or ventilator capable of pressure control ventilation may be helpful. Based on the level of preoperative disability, the need for postoperative ventilation should be discussed with the patient and family. Of note, adequate oxygenation during one-lung ventilation for anterior thoracic approaches may be difficult. Placement of a double-lumen ETT instead of a bronchial blocker offers the advantage of delivering passive oxygenation to the nonventilated lung. However, such tubes have the disadvantage of needing to switch to a single-lumen ETT at the end of the procedure if postoperative ventilation is required. Improvement in the patient's pulmonary function does not occur immediately after surgery, and any improvement may take months to several years, depending on the procedure. 91 Large-bore venous access, central or otherwise, is needed to ensure rapid replacement of intraoperative blood loss. Central venous pressure monitoring is of limited usefulness in these procedures because of the effects of positioning on the values obtained and possible pulmonary hypertension or cor pulmonale, which reduces the value of central venous pressure monitoring in determining the adequacy of intravascular volume.

The one exception to this is during preoxygenation, which is relatively brief, before induction of general anesthesia. 94 When adequate oxygenation does require an Fio 2 greater than 30%, use of PEEP may facilitate oxygen action without necessitating higher levels of Fio 2 . Fluid therapy should be conservative, with the goal of maintaining adequate intravascular volume and avoiding excess fluid administration. There is no evidence to support the use of colloid instead of crystalloid in bleomycin patients. When significant blood loss or significant fluid shifts are expected in surgery, intraarterial and central venous catheters may be helpful. There is no clear answer as to how long after completion of therapy with bleomycin a patient continues to be at risk for pulmonary fibrosis, although minimizing Fio 2 for 1 to 2 years would seem prudent (Box 4-13).",

Influenza viruses undergo continual antigenic drift, aiding in their ability to resist the host's immunity. This contributes to the continued pandemics of viruses, particularly influenza A strains. Most recently, the H1N1 strain led to catastrophic mortality, particularly in the infant and young population. First identified in Mexico in 2009, H1N1 quickly spread worldwide. This variant is composed of swine, bird, and human strains of influenza A. The rates of transmission are higher than for the seasonal influenza.

The eggs of the worm are passed in the feces of infested dogs. Humans acquire the infection by unintentionally ingesting the eggs. Larvae then migrate to the liver, with some eventually arriving in the lungs and other tissues. The parasites then mature to form hydatid cysts. The lung forms a protective granulomatous layer around the cyst, which over time becomes fibrotic. It is estimated that hydatid cysts grow 1 to 2 cm a year. 101 As a result of the fecal-oral transmission, echinococcal lung disease is more common in children than adults. Overall it is rare in North America but common in other parts of the world. These cysts are frequently asymptomatic, and pulmonary cysts are often detected on routine chest radiographs. The most likely symptoms are cough, dyspnea, and chest pain. Rupture of a cyst can occur spontaneously or on surgical manipulation. This may result in an anaphylactic reaction or spread the disease to other organs. For this reason, transthoracic needle aspiration should never be attempted. Chest radiographs will reveal a cystic lesion, which may be rather large, accompanied by an area of pneumonitis or atelectasis.

Plan for possible bronchoscopy and pulmonary toilet (use large ETT when possible). May require stress-dose steroids. Avoid high airway pressures and tidal volumes. Assess pulmonary function. Delay surgery until steroid therapy implemented. May need intraoperative bronchodilators. Utilize PEEP cautiously and at low levels, if needed at all; minimize intrathoracic pressures to decrease shunt. Assess cardiopulmonary and renal function (BUN/creatinine, urinalysis, ABGs, ECG, echocardiography, spirometry). Maintain oxygenation but limit supplemental O 2 to lowest level consistent with arterial saturation >90%. Consider invasive monitors. Arterial catheter used for all but the mildest disease; consider TEE or PAC if assessment of volume status or adequacy of cardiac output unclear. Assess pulmonary function (level of dyspnea, baseline O 2 saturation, time since last BPL, ABGs, chest radiograph). Double-lumen ETT required for BPL. Invasive monitoring (PAC, TEE) may facilitate intraoperative management for higher-risk procedures. Assess all organ system involvement (PFTs, ECG, echocardiography, BUN/creatinine). Evaluate airway to rule out lesions by indirect laryngoscopy or CT. Possible postoperative ventilatory support. Consider invasive monitors. May require perioperative stress-dose steroids. Systemic Lupus Erythematosus Assess all organ system involvement (chest radiograph, PFTs, ABGs, BUN/creatinine, LFTs). Invasive monitors may be indicated if cardiac or pulmonary involvement and for type of surgery (arterial catheters). Minimize airway manipulation secondary to risk of inflammation and potential laryngeal involvement. Refrain from nitrous oxide use secondary to bone marrow suppression. Utilize permissive hypercapnia as needed. Consider invasive monitors (arterial/central venous catheters, TEE). Provide supportive care, with carefully guided fluid resuscitation. Ensure postoperative ventilatory support. Assess cardiopulmonary function. Tailor anesthetic management to progression of disease. Give special attention to possible pathologic fractures.
