The controversy over the characterization of triaditis as a separate syndrome is not surprising, considering that the 3 component diseases remain poorly characterized with regard to their pathogenesis and their clinical, laboratory, and histopathological 4 total thyroxine fT 4 free thyroxine concentrations 95% CI 95% Confidence Interval manifestations. 2 In addition, the inconsistent clinical and laboratory findings and lack of specific and sensitive laboratory tests often make their ante-mortem diagnosis challenging. Histopathologic evaluation of hepatic, pancreatic, and intestinal biopsy specimens is essential for a definitive diagnosis. However, no consensus exists regarding the histopathological nomenclature and classification of the lesions of the component diseases of triaditis. Also, interpretation of borderline lesions of these component diseases might be challenging. These factors have made it difficult to compare results of different studies and definitively define clinical, diagnostic, and therapeutic standards. To address this problem, the World Small Animal Veterinary Association (WSAVA) has formed the Liver Standardization Group, 3 and later, the Gastrointestinal Standardization Group, 4 which have summarized histopathological standards for the diagnosis of hepatic and gastrointestinal inflammation in biopsy samples from dogs and cats. [3] [4] [5] However, since the publication of these standards in 2006 and 2010, 5, 6 there have been concerns about the validity and reproducibility of these standards in clinical cases. 7 To date, there is little literature focused on feline triaditis and clinical studies are lacking. Several case reports describe cats with different combinations of inflammatory conditions of the intestine, liver, and pancreas, in some patients also in combination with hepatic lipidosis, chronic nephritis, or some combination of these disorders. 2, [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] However, these reports are either incomplete in terms of laboratory analysis [22] [23] [24] or include only a small number of cases. 21, 25, 26 Current knowledge mostly is derived from retrospective postmortem studies. 1, [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] In 2 independent studies, the coexistence of feline cholangiohepatitis or cholangitis with pancreatitis and IBD was reported in 39% 29 or 32% 31 of cats examined.",

Furthermore, in our study pancreatitis alone or triaditis was only present in cats that were symptomatic. Also, the combination of cholangitis and pancreatitis without concurrent lesions of IBD was not detected. In addition, the histological severity of IBD lesions was positively correlated with the number of comorbidities.

Although highly localized inflammation can be missed with this technique, it remains the 'gold standard' for diagnosing cholangitis, 39-41 pancreatitis, 14, 35, 42 or IBD. 4, 5 Although invasive, open surgery was selected instead of other methods because laparotomy allows direct visual inspection of the organs and detection of gross lesions, and also facilitates control of hemorrhage during liver biopsy. Laparotomy also allows for the collection of fullthickness tissue samples from all segments of the small intestine, which facilitates the differentiation of IBD from lymphoma. 43 In this study, lymphocytes and plasma cells were the predominant cell types seen in all sites evaluated. In cats, chronic inflammatory liver disease mostly affects the biliary tree and portal areas and less commonly the hepatic parenchyma. 6, 44, 45 Also, cholangitis is predominantly lymphocytic. 40, 41 According to a recent study, many cases of lymphocytic cholangitis remain subclinical, whereas concurrent inflammatory diseases such as pancreatitis, IBD, or both more frequently might be associated with clinical signs. 31 Regarding pancreatic inflammation, cats with chronic pancreatitis were likely to have concurrent disease. 30 Finally, lymphoplasmocytic enteritis is considered the most common type of IBD in the cat. 36, 46, 47 In our study, no statistically significant differences in the severity of histopathological lesions of either a single organ or a combination of several organs were identified between symptomatic and asymptomatic cats. However, epithelial dysplasia was not seen in asymptomatic cats with lesions suggesting IBD. Also, the severity of cholangitis lesions, when present alone, did not differ significantly from when present along with IBD or both IBD and pancreatitis lesions. In contrast, the histopathological lesions of IBD in cats with triaditis were significantly more severe than in cats where IBD lesions were present alone. These findings support the hypothesis that in this multifactorial syndrome, IBD might play a predominant role.",

Furthermore, it was shown that the severity of pancreatitis was positively related with age and that cats with triaditis (median age, 7.5 years) were significantly older than cats with lesions of cholangitis, IBD, or IBD in combination with cholangitis (median age, 3.5 years). Although a statistically significant correlation between age and the number of comorbidities with IBD could not be confirmed, an increased frequency of older cats among cats with triaditis was noted, compared to cats with only 2 comorbidities or IBD only.",

Although histopathologic examination of pancreatic biopsy specimens allows for definitive diagnosis when inflammatory infiltrates are observed, pancreatic biopsy is not always feasible. Furthermore, focal inflammatory lesions of pancreatitis might escape diagnosis. 37, 59 Serum total lipase activity 60-62 and serum fTLI [63] [64] [65] [66] are not considered sensitive or specific for the diagnosis of exocrine pancreatic disease in cats, and this was confirmed in our study for the fTLI test. Concerning serum total lipase activity, although a mild positive correlation was detected between median activity of this test and the severity score of pancreatitis, the difference between the controls and the triaditis group was not statistically significant. Feline pancreatic lipase immunoreactivity (fPLI, as measured by Spec fPL \u00d2 ) is an assay that specifically quantifies lipase that originates from pancreatic acinar cells. 32, 34 The fPLI's overall sensitivity for the diagnosis of pancreatitis has been estimated to be 67% (ranging from 54% in mild cases to 100% in moderate-to-severe cases of pancreatitis) and its specificity has reached 100% in healthy cats and 91% in cats with gastrointestinal disease without histopathological lesions in the pancreas. 62, [64] [65] [66] In a recent study of naturally occurring pancreatitis, the sensitivity of the method was reported to be 78%. m As shown in our study, median fPLI in cats with triaditis was significantly higher when compared with the control group, although the median score of pancreatitis recorded in the triaditis group was suggestive of mild-to-moderate pancreatitis and the median fPLI did not exceed the upper limit of the reference interval (3.5 lg/L). Moreover, a statistically significant increase in the median value of the variable also was observed in group Ch, compared with controls and all of the other groups of cats. One possible explanation is that a number of cats from group Ch might have had localized pancreatitis that was missed on histopathology (because only a single biopsy specimen was evaluated for the purpose of our study). Consequently, additional studies involving larger numbers of cats with triaditis and of variable severity pancreatitis are needed. Several pancreatic biopsy specimens should be collected and evaluated, and serum fPLI must be considered along with other clinical and laboratory findings to maximize the diagnostic capabilities for pancreatitis and triaditis.",

Only 1 tissue specimen per site was collected from the client-owned cats because of the inherent risk of biopsy, especially for critically ill cats, and this might have limited the accuracy of histopathological assessment.

In 6 of them ([20%]; 95% CI: 10-30%) cholangitis was the only inflammatory lesion found, whereas in 24/30 ([80%]; 95% CI: 70-90%) cholangitis coexisted either with lesions of IBD (16/30 [53.3%]; 95% CI: 36.7-70%) or IBD and pancreatitis (8/30 [26.7%]; 95% CI: 16.7-36.7%). Specific lesions identified included inflammatory cell aggregates in portal areas, fibrosis, and hyperplasia of the bile ducts and oval cells. In the majority of cats (25/30 [83.3%]; 95% CI: 65.3-94.4%), the inflammatory cell component consisted primarily of lymphocytes and a relatively small number of plasma cells (lymphocytic cholangitis). Regarding the lymphocytic type of cholangitis, coexistence was observed in most of the cases (20/25 [80%]; 95% CI: 59.3-93.2%) either in combination with IBD (15/25 [60%]; 95% CI: 38.7-78.9%) or in the combination of triaditis (5/25 [20%]; 95% CI: 6.8-40.7%). In a small number of cases (5/30 [16.7%]; 95% CI: 5.6-34.7%), in addition to mononuclear cells a considerable population of neutrophils was present (chronic neutrophilic cholangitis).6 The majority of chronic neutrophilic cholangitis cases (4/5) also had IBD lesions(1/5)  or triaditis (3/5). Cholestasis was evident in 18/30 (60%; 95% CI: 40.6-77.3%) cats with cholangitis. A small number of cats with cholangitis also had focal or multifocal hepatitis (4/30 [13.3%]; CI 95%: 3.8-30.7%). The variably sized focal hepatitis lesions typically had a mixed mononuclear cell and neutrophilic infiltrate with (3/30 [10%]; 95% CI: 2-27%) or without necrosis of the hepatic parenchyma.",
