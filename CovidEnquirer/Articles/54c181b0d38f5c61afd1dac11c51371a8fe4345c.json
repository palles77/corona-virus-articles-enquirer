The p80 and p54 probes hybridized to 23/24 (96%) and 22/24 (92%), respectively, of CP strains examined. In contrast, these same two probes only detected 16/37 (43%) and 5/37 (13%), respectively, of the NCP strains examined. The gp53 probe detected 18/24 ( 75% ) and the gp62 probe detected 19/24 (79%) of the CP strains. In contrast, these latter two probes only detected 9/37 (24%) and 7/37 (20%), respectively, of NCP strains. This tow detection rate of NCP strains suggests a need for developing a probe based on NCP sequences for identification of NCP strains.",

Current methods to detect BVDV infection of cattle include virus isolation and viral neutralization tests. These methods are expensive, time consuming, and difficult to use in large scale screening of animals or animal products for BVDV (Baker, 1987; Radostits and Littlejohns, 1988) . Nucleic acid hybridization techniques using cloned probes are finding application in assays of clinical specimens in research and diagnostic laboratories. Such probes, highly specific in their nature, have widespread applications in the detection of routine microbial diagnostic assays (Highfield and Dougan, 1985; Linet al., 1985; Pettersson and Hyypia, 1985; Shockley et al., 1987) . Application of dot blot assays, particularly with in situ hybridization, to avoid the difficulties of RNA extraction has not been used for BVDV. This technique would solve many of the problems associated with current assays. The dot blot assay could be used in 96-well plate for screening of animals or biologic products. The purpose of this study is to test the cloned cDNA regions of the BVDV genome to determine sequences most useful for detection and differentiation of a large number of field strains of BVDV.",

Classification of the cytopathic viral biotype was based on the induction of cytoplasmic vacuolation and cell death within 48 h of infection of culture cells. The viruses were isolated over a 30-year period from cattle, fetal calf serum, swine, deer, and cell cultures infected with adventitious BVD virus. Confluent monolayers of BT cells were inoculated with virus at a multiplicity of infection of five. After 24 to 32 h for cytopathic viruses or 48 h for noncytopathic viruses, the infected BT cells were harvested by treatment with trypsin-versene solution. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation and suspended in Eagle's minimum essential medium containing 10% fetal calf serum and 10% dimethyl sulfoxide, and frozen at -70\u00b0C until further use. The BT cells used for growth of virus were tested by direct fluorescent antibody staining procedures and were found free of adventitious BVD virus. The fetal calf serum used in the cell culture medium was free of adventitious BVD virus by virus isolation and antibodies to BVD virus by viral neutralization and indirect immunoperoxidase staining procedures.",

Four hybridization probes were developed representing genomic regions encoding the viral proteins, gp62, gp53, p54, and p80. All probes were derived from cloned cDNA of the NADL CP strain. These four genes represented greater than 40% of the NADL genome. These probes were tested against 61 field-collected strains of BVDV. Of these 61 samples, 37 were NCP and the remaining 24 samples were CP. A summary of how effective these four probes were at identifying the BVDV infected cells is given in Tables 2 and 3. Based on the results of Table 2 , use of probes other than p80 did not result in detection of additional NCP strains, presumably because there is not complementary detection among the probes. Thus, p80 was the best choice for BVDV detection among the probes tested.",

The failure to detect 36% of the NCP strains with any of the tested probes developed from the CP strain indicates a significant variation in sequences and the necessity of developing additional probes for highly conserved segments of NCP strains to allow identification of all of NCP BVDV. Currently, we are sequencing the genomes of two NCP strains and these sequences may show which regions are highly conserved and would likely serve as sequence for probe development and NCP detection. By employing the appropriate combination of CP and NCP genomes cDNA sequences as probes, it may be possible to use the dot blot assay as a general BVD diagnostic test for all BVDV strains.",

This low detection rate may indicate that the p54 region is the least conserved segment between CP and NCP strains (Collett et al., 1989) .

Pestiviruses have recently been suggested as a likely new genus with the family Flaviviridae (Collett et al., 1988b; Collett et al., 1989). The various BVDV strains differ in their ability to cause cytopathic (CP) changes in cell culture. Thus, CP and noncytopathic (NCP) biotypes of BVDV are identified. The CP strains induce cytoplasmic vacuolation in infected cells, where NCP strains do not. In the United States, serological surveys have demonstrated that 70 to 80% of bovine samples examined *To whom all correspondence should be addressed.Mention of a trade name, proprietary product or specific equipment does not constitute a guarantee or warranty by the U.S. Department of Agriculture and does not imply its approval of the exclusion of other products that may be suitable.",
