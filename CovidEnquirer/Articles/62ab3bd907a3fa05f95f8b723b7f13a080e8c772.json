The taxa include the largest mammals on earth, baleen whales, as well as marine and freshwater toothed whales, dolphins, and porpoises (the odontocetes). The taxonomy of the cetacean infraorder is presented in the Supplemental Materials in Tables e1 and e2. There are approximately 89 living species of cetaceans. Of these, 15 species comprise the baleen whales and there are more than 70 species of toothed whales. Odontocetes include species with diverse ecological (including foraging strategies, prey selection and habitat use), anatomical and physiological differences ranging from the freshwater river dolphins to deep diving beaked whales. This subgroup includes sperm whales, porpoises, dolphins, beluga, narwhal, and beaked whales. These adaptations can have important implications when evaluating gross pathology and histopathologic findings. Free-ranging whales and dolphins may have global distributions but many ecotypes have localized habitats with or without a specific migratory range. A limited number of odontocetes, primarily delphinids, are maintained in captivity. For this reason, the published material of cetacean pathology is heavily biased towards odontocetes using material from captive and stranded animals.",

This condition is more thoroughly presented in Chapter 4. This altered clotting system does not lead to pathologic bleeding tendencies but can impede collection of serum as part of routine clinical chemistry evaluations. To manage this, routine clinical blood draws typically involve three different blood collection tubes containing anticoagulant: one orange-topped (thrombin), one light blue-topped (sodium citrate), and one purple topped (potassium EDTA) tube ( Fig. 22.1 ). This assortment of tubes facilitates clinical chemistry with minimal hemolysis, electrolytes and acid-base determinations, hematology, clotting profiles, whole blood sedimentation times, and plasma fibrinogen determination. For genomic assays, a greentopped (lithium heparin) tube should be added to the collection set.",

            "text": "The anatomy of cetacea varies from domestic mammal species in many ways. The most obvious difference is musculoskeletal, with the lack of hind limbs and evolutionary transformation of the forelimb to a flipper appendage. With the loss of hindlimbs there is an associated reduction of the pelvis. Vestigial hip bones with occasional articulations (pseudoarthroses) remain and can be located deep in the muscle of the ventrolateral caudal abdominal wall. The presence of these bones has been linked to male sexual performance (Dines et al., 2014) . The altered gravitational effects of a fluid environment, hydrodynamic configurations, and buoyancy enhanced by a thick blubber layer and lung capacity, have resulted in lower bone densities than would be expected if cetacean bones had the gravitational forces of terrestrial mammalian counterparts. As long bones of the forelimbs have no medullary cavity, bone marrow is best extracted from vertebral bodies or ribs. The torso is enveloped by a thick axial fibroelastic sheath which stores kinetic energy with each fluke stroke to enhance swimming efficiency.",

The skull elongation is asymmetrical with the bony margins of the blow hole off center. Above the elongated maxilla, is the melon, a structure designed for forward propagation of echolocation clicks. Returning sound or echolocation vibrations enter the head via the soft tissues and are specifically focused towards the mandibular fat body within the caudal, \"pan\" section of the mandibles. Cetaceans have no external ears and have a rudimentary ear canal that does not connect to the tympanoperiotic capsule containing the bones of the middle and inner ears. In contrast to the axial and appendicular skeleton, these bones are remarkably dense and have ligamentous attachments to the adjoining skull with expanded accessory tympanoperiotic air sinuses, homologous to guttural pouches in horses. At necropsy, ear wax may be collected from eustachian tubes from some large cetaceans, and hormonal and chemical analyses provide valuable insights into temporal reproductive and stress hormone levels, as well as contaminant exposure through the life of the animal.",

            "text": "The gastrointestinal morphology of cetaceans varies by genera/species. Instead of teeth, oral cavities of the baleen (mysticete) whales contain multiple plates of keratin with a fibrous fringe extending from the upper jaw to the lower gums. To resist forces of water engulfment and prey extraction associated with filter feeding, the plates are secured by zwischensubstanz to the gingiva. The number and length of plates vary throughout the baleen suborder. On cross section, they present thick cortical plates encasing 3-5 layers of horny tubules (Slijper, 1979) . Isotopic analysis of baleen provides valuable insights into life history endocrine levels and prey selection (Hunt et al., 2014) and foreshortening, abrasion, fraying, and erosion of plates have been attributed to mechanical forces associated with lunge or ram feeding and tongue movements. At necropsy, thorough examination of the oral cavity for foreign debris is imperative. The teeth of the odontocetes vary by family and prey-type. Tooth shape of the delphinids is either conical or spadeshaped; each tooth has only one root. There are no incisors or molars-all teeth are more or less identical (homodont). The squid-eating sperm whale has one row of conical teeth on both sides of the lower jaw but none in the upper jaw. The Kogiadae-pygmy and dwarf sperm whales similarly only have lower teeth. The beaked whales have no more than one or two erupted teeth in the lower jaw. In one species of beaked whale, the strap-toothed whale, the lower teeth erupt and extend to encircle the maxilla so that the jaw can only open a few centimeters. A unique dental modification of the odontocetes is found in the narwhal. Narwhal gums typically have only a single erupted tooth. The male's tusk is a giant canine tooth with a distinct left-handed spiral. It can grow as long as three meters and is covered in cementum rather than enamel. Rarely, both canines can erupt and form tusks. The canines of females can erupt and produce a shortened tusk. The porosity of the tusk suggests that the structure acts as a sensory device for measuring water salinity, temperature and pressure (Nweeia et al., 2014) , as well as for social interactions (dominance) and hunting (striking) of prey species.",

The main fundic stomach is a smaller, generally round structure with a deep red-brown folded, glandular mucosa. Gastric glands containing neck cells, parietal cells, and chief cells line the surface of this chamber. The third, pyloric chamber of the stomach is \"U-shaped\" with a prominent sphincter that regulates the passage of ingesta into the small intestine. There is a sacular dilation of the proximal duodenum to form an ampulae. The size, length, and number of saculations in the connecting chamber vary considerably between species. The saculations are created by a series of valves without distinct sphincters. Histologically, the mucosa of the connecting chambers and pylorus is the same and features deep branching tubular pits producing primarily mucus along with gastrin and lysozyme. In contrast, the duodenal ampula is identified histologically by the regular components of the duodenal wall-villous mucosa, submucosa, tunica muscularis, and serosa. All cetaceans lack a gall bladder. Likewise, the cecum is notably absent in the odontocetes with the exception of river dolphins, making gross distinction between small and large intestine difficult. The rectum of odontocetes has lymphoid nodules within the mucosa and submucosa termed the \"colonic tonsil.\" Dwarf and pygmy sperm whales (Kogia spp.) have a sacular dilation of the distal colon colloquially called the \"ink sac\" (Fig. 22.2) . This structure can hold up to 12 L of dark, fluid, fecal material. When forcibly expelled, this liquid creates a dense cloud to distract predators, allowing the whale to swim away. In sperm whales a unique compound, ambergris is produced by consumption and partial digestion of squid beaks.",

The blow hole is analogous to the nostrils and is located on the dorsal aspect of the head. There are two external openings in mysticetes and a single blowhole in odontocetes. The blowhole is closed as the associated muscles are relaxed. In either group, the underlying skull has a nasal septum so all cetceans have dual entry into the upper respiratory tract. There are no turbinates to filter inhaled particles in any cetaceans. With large tidal volumes and respiratory exchange rates of less than 1-2 s, deposition of particles and pathogens deep into the respiratory tract is easier than with terrestrial mammals. Because of this, respiratory disease is a much more significant cause of morbidity and mortality in cetaceans . A nasal air sac system with analogous anatomy and function to the paranasal sinuses in terrestrial mammals extends from the cranial respiratory tract rostral to the integration of the larynx. These sacs are not enclosed in bone like sinuses (Reidenberg and Laitman, 2008 ). An elongated larynx called a \"goosebeak\" extends through the esophagus to the bony nasal passage and is held in place by the muscular palatopharyngeal sphincter (Reynolds and Rommell, 1999) . While the sphincter and larynx form a tight seal, the larynx can still be displaced through esophageal pressure associated with swallowing large objects or voluntarily by the animal contracting the hyoepiglottic and associated laryngeal muscles. This behavior has been associated with cases of fatal aspiration and asphyxiation. At the base of the larynx, are numerous trabeculae that entrap foreign particulate material and overlie microscopic lymphoglandular elements; the latter are, homologous to human adenoids. The trachea has a large vascular venous plexus with prominent lacunae in the subepithelium. This structure has a critical role in fungal tracheitis (presented under fungal infections).",

First, cartilage extends from the trachea all the way to the level of distal bronchioles and on gross examination, are visible as cartilage \"nodules\" throughout the parenchyma. Within the bronchioles, smooth muscle and elastic sphincters create a series of compartments along the airway to the level of the alveoli (Fig. 22.3) . These changes are a diving adaptation. However, the valves can obstruct pulmonary clearance of parasites and secondary bacterial involvement can result in bronchiectasis and multifocal pulmonary abscesses. Additionally, granular to tophic, basophilic calcific deposits can be present in the epithelium and subepithelial tissues of the bronchioles. These deposits likely reflect prior areas of bronchiolar damage or inspissated material. Lastly, the alveolar walls of the cetacean lung contain both type I and type II pneumocytes, but type III (brush border cells) are absent. The alveolar walls contain double (as opposed to single in terrestrial mammals) rows of capillaries ( Fig. 22 .3). A common age-related change is an increase in fibrous tissue expanding the alveolar interstitium and pleura. This change likely reflects an element of a chronic immune response.

The gray whale barnacle, Cryptolepas rhachianecti, attaches to calves and mothers. Once the crustacean has settled, it spends its entire life cycle attached to the whale. Barnacle clusters, similar to callosities can be used to identify individual whales. Also as with the callosities, species specific cyamids lodge within these proliferative areas to feed on whale skin. These parasites spread from dams to their calves during birth, nursing, and general contact. Microscopically, affected skin is markedly hyperplastic with hyperkeratosis, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, and spongiosus with superficial bacterial colonization and varying degrees of inflammation in the superficial dermis.",

Nevertheless, even small regional spills may pose a risk if critical habitats are involved, particularly to threatened or endangered populations. Exposure may be through direct contact with the skin, eyes, oral cavity, blowhole, or through ingestion and prey contamination so an awareness of pre-existing stressors in the habitat is essential. The lack of baseline data on ecosystem components, animal health, demographics, and population trends within an oiled area may significantly impede interpretation of pathology and ancillary diagnostic findings and confound delineation of long term lethal and sublethal effects of spills. Although oil exposure laboratory studies were conducted in the 1980s there are few investigations to assess the pathogenesis of exposure. Moreover, as petroleum products may include a number of inorganic and organic compounds, it is difficult to extrapolate the effects of one spill to another. As a result, the pathogenesis of oil exposure is often delineated from review of findings with oiling spill events. In the Deep Water Horizon spill, adrenocortical atrophy, pneumonia, and reproductive loss where significant findings in exposed animals and long term follow up studies may provide valuable insights into the consequences of exposure and population recovery. Detection of visible oil on the surface or within the upper respiratory tract or digestive system should prompt notification of appropriate regional and national authorities and, if the scale of the spill is sufficient, an Emergency Response with Incident Command Activation may occur. (Venn-Watson, 2015) Although banned in many regions of the world, persistant organopollutants (POPs) (Table 22 .1) are still detected in many marine mammal populations . This phenomenon is due to aerosolization and widespread dispersal, environmental persistence, and longevity of many cetacean species. Individual and synergistic effects of POPs may potentiate toxicity of some compounds. Although numerous hematology, clinical chemistry and in vitro and in vivo immune function studies have been conducted in cetaceans and surrogate pinnipeds, there are few descriptive gross or histopathology descriptions. In addition to impacting immune function, endocrine disruption also occurs. Long term necropsy results linked to contaminant loads of stranded cetaceans have been analyzed and identify a reduction in splenic and thymic lymphoid populations with increasing POP levels and immunosuppression is inferred. However, it is important to place contaminant loads in context of post mortem state and nutritional status of the animal as artifactual increases may occur with peripheral mobilization of adipose tissue and post mortem dissolution of fat stores.",

Moreover, post mortem change (autolysis), scavenging and mutilation can impede recognition and interpretation of gross and microscopic findings in examined animals. However, advanced imaging studies, chemical analysis of gas emboli, and an increasing knowledge about sharp and blunt force injuries, have all contributed significantly to our improved detection and confirmation of anthropogenic insults. It is important to note that these categories are not mutually exclusive and detection and interaction of more than one entity may occur. Conversely, a single insult may result in multiple pathologic manifestations. As these incidents may trigger regulatory enforcement or legal investigation, review and use of appropriate forensic diagnostic protocols is imperative. Moore et al.

As with \"the bends\" in humans, change in the dive profile is a prime contributor to gas bubble formation and can result in subsequent embolization, impaired vascular perfusion, ischemia, and infarction. The most common anthropogenic activities associated with this process include deployment of mid-range tactical naval sonar and net entanglement due to fisheries interaction resulting in abrupt ascent from depth to the surface. With acute presentations, gas bubbles may be seen in the mesenteric ( Fig. 22 .16A), renal, pulmonary, hepatic, coronary, meningeal, and spinal epidural rete vasculature; subserosal and mesenteric vasculature should be closely scrutinized for intravascular gas. Associated hemorrhage is most commonly identified in visceral pleura, epicardium, and acoustic fat. Histopathology typically features occlusion and variable vascular distention by clear microcavitations with acute perivascular hemorrhage and occasional infarction ( Fig. 22.16B ). In the acute phase of decompression, fat emboli may also be seen in the pulmonary vasculature as well as the epidural rete, subcapsular sinuses of lymph nodes, and renal vasculature ( Fern\u00e1ndez et al., 2005) . Should animals survive the initial insult, lesions may resolve through vascular resorption and exhalation or offloading of gases. Progession to more chronic stages is characterized by fibrous encapsulation of pseudocysts with variable granulomatous infiltrates and Langhan's type multinucleated giant cells. These cavitations are most commonly recognized within the liver, kidney, spleen, and stomach wall. Dysbaric osteonecrosis has also been reported in larger cetaceans. In the past, gas production associated with putrefaction, and hemorrhage associated with substrate in live stranded animals may have confounded diagnoses of decompression disease; however, with computed tomography imaging studies and mass spectrophotometric analysis of gas samples, nitrogen may be differentiated from those gases attributed to decomposition artifact.",

Due to the unique physical properties of the aquatic environment and substrate, lesions in cetaceans are typically more profound in aquatic than in terrestrial mammals. With detonation of an explosive, there is rapid conversion of the liquid or solid to a gas under high pressure and temperature, which generates a blast front and immediate increase in underwater static pressure. This energy is transmitted and propagated radially as alternating positive and negative pressure waves. On impact with an animal, there are implosive and pressure differentials, which can generate up to a ninefold increase in pressure. In contrast to detonations on the ground or in the air, underwater explosions are more lethal due to the incompressibility of water, resulting in shock wave propagation up to three times farther than on land, as well as reflection of shock waves along the substrate and air surface interface resulting in more complex blast waves (Cox et al., 2006; Jepson et al., 2003) .",

On gross examination, hemorrhage may be apparent in the trachea and lungs with pulmonary hematomas, edema, and emphysema tend to be more pronounced on the side of impact. Pulmonary rents with pneumothorax or hemothorax may also occur and microscopically, bronchoalveolar spaces may have frank hemorrhage admixed with exfoliated type I pneumocytes and rafts of detached and aspirated ciliated respiratory epithelia. With shearing of blood vessels in the lung and blubber, intravascular gas and fat may be apparent and embolization may further compromise homeostasis. Although the blast wave may impact the abdomen with no apparent external effect, due to gas content within the lumen of the gastrointestinal tract, this system is particularly prone to injury. Gross lesions may include segmental hemorrhage and tearing or perforation of different levels of the digestive system. Ear pathology may include peribullar hemorrhage and fractured tympanic bullae . Recent advancements in acoustic mapping of the cochlea have provided valuable insights to potential sources of acoustic injury. If ears are harvested and perfused within 18-24 h after death, ultrastructural evaluation of stereocilia and immunofluorescence studies of afferent nerves may provide further evidence of barotrauma.

Although small cetaceans and larger whales can be impacted, larger slower moving whales tend to be more frequently involved, particularly when congregated in shipping lanes. Depending on the point of contact with the vessel, animals may present with blunt force or sharp injury that may be directly lethal or contribute to sustained injuries, which may resolve or can persist for extended periods of time. Case definitions and examples of traumatic lesions are available (Moore et al., 2013) . Although animals affected with blunt force injury may have no apparent external lesions, on reflection of the skin and blubber, subcutaneous hemorrhage and edema at the impact site is usually noted. If the fibroelastic sheath is intact, focally extensive bulging may be observed and on incision, massive hematoma formation with shearing and necrosis of the subjacent skeletal musculature may be evident. Rupture of the sheath at the time of impact is more typically associated with extensive subcutaneous hemorrhage, which may track dependently in the hypodermis. Inspection of the abdominal and thoracic cavities may also reveal organ herniation, transposition, rupture, and associated hemorrhage. Histologicaly, acute myocellular degeneration and necrosis with edema and hemorrhage at the impact site and in muscle samples remote to the site of impact are seen and flocculent, granular, discoid and hyalinized segmental myodegeneration are attributed to agonal catecholamine surge. Fat embolization may be apparent in the pulmonary and renal microvasculature. Depending on the circumstances, animal impacts with stationary structures, such as piers, moorings, wind farms or tidal hydroelectric turbines, may present with similar gross lesions to those of ship strike (Moore et al., 2013) .",

Helicobacter cetorum has been identified in numerous delphinid species with gastritis (Davison et al., 2014) . Histopathology reveals mild to moderate lymphoplasmacytic gastritis in the superficial mucosa of the main and pyloric compartments with superficial to deep ulcerations and occasional hemorrhage.

It is considered the most significant threat to marine mammal populations. Critically endangered species including the vaquita and baiji have largely been extirpated by fisheries interactions that may ultimately result in their extinction. Derelict and active fisheries netting, commercial monofilament lines, crab-trap lines and rope impact cetaceans directly through entanglement or entrapment. External evidence of net entanglement may include gear impressions along the surface of the skin or oral mucosa (hatched or linear furrows), abrasions, incisions, lacerations, and subcutaneous hemorrhage ( Fig. 22.18 ). However, surface evidence of entanglement may not always be apparent, particularly when animals are entrapped in a trawl with large numbers of fish that prevent direct contact with the netting. In these instances, animals may present in good nutritional condition with stable white tracheobronchial froth, hyperinflated lungs with generalized pulmonary edema, congestion and subpleural emphysema. Pleural and pulmonary petechiae and ecchymoses may also be noted. Diagnosis may be contingent on the circumstances of death. In those animals that are entrapped at depth, gas bubble formation and embolization may occur with rapid accent and the pulmonary and renal microvasculature should be closely evaluated for possible fat emboli (Moore et al., 2009) .",

In animals with chronic entanglement with advanced autolysis with generalized skin sloughing, the raised linear ridges of fibrosis associated with entanglement are noted and may feature superficial plaques or plugs of adhered epidermis due to adhesions. Based on long-term data analysis, it is suggested that persistent organic pollutants and harmful algal blooms (toxins) may be associated with an increased risk of entanglement. If feasible, samples to screen for these compounds should be harvested at necropsy. In some instances, the force of initial impact may be so severe, that fracture of the rostrum or mandible with tooth loss may be evident. An indirect consequence of fisheries interaction is depredation, a learned behavior recognized predominantly in killer whales, false killer whale, pilot whales, and sperm whales characterized by removal of fish from long line hooks. In rare instances, hooks have been ingested and penetrated the oropharynx, resulting in secondary septicemia. This behavior may also result in whale harassment and possibly gunshot, further contributing to the loss of these animals. Less common forms of entrapment may include interactions with aquaculture net-pen facilities, piers, and boat harbors (Read and Murray, 2000) .

Pica and terminal ingestion of foreign debris is noted in live, moribund stranded dolphins and may reflect a behavioral effect; whereas, in ram or lunge feeding baleen whales, ingestion of floating or suspended debris may be inadvertent. Other cetaceans with more discriminate feeding habits appear to selectively ingest material that may accumulate to sufficient quantity to impair normal digestive processes. Postmortem findings include distention of the stomach by foreign debris (including netting up to 16 m 2 in sperm whales, rope, plastic bags, fishing line, and other materials), which in more severely affected animals has resulted in obstruction, localized ulceration, perforation, and secondary peritonitis (Moore et al., 2013) . In additional to the physical consequences of ingested debris, manufactured plastics also incorporate polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs), persistent organic pollutants, and other additives, which over time, may be assimilated and have a direct immunotoxicologic consequence to animals. This process may be exacerbated with inadvertent ingestion of microplastics or may result from mechanical breakdown of larger plastic items in the marine environment to secondary microparticles ( Simmonds, 2012) .

Determination of a cause of death may be further confounded due to the different types of asphyxiation, including cellular, vascular, and ventilatory or mechanical obstruction. At present, there are no pathognomonic lesions or biochemical markers for asphyxiation and diagnosis typically relies on circumstances associated with recovery of the carcass. In marine mammals a presumptive diagnosis of asphyxiation is most commonly associated with bycaught individuals where animals present or are recovered entrapped in gill nets or trawls (see by-catch section for additional details). An additional form of asphyxiation is more sporadic and related to ingestion of foreign debris, such as fishing line which may obstruct or displace the larynx. The same effect is achieved when cetaceans consume prey that is sufficiently large to cause displacement of the larynx and secondarily obstruct the exposed airway ( Fig. 22.19 ). Cases in animals in managed care have been seen where regurgitated objects have subsequently lodged in the displaced larynx and resulted in fatal asphyxiation. A recent case of phytobezoar asphyxiation in a bottlenose dolphin demonstrates that material need not be swallowed to be fatal (Wright et al., 2017) . Angiomatosis (Fig. 22 .20) is a common finding among the stranded bottlenose dolphins in the Gulf of Mexico. The lesion has also been seen in stranded Atlantic bottlenose dolphins from eastern Florida and occasionally in common dolphins from Southern California. An evaluation of common dolphin strandings in the Canary Islands showed a majority of animals with pulmonary angiomatosis (D\u00edaz-Delgado et al., 2012); a correlation with lung worm infections was seen in these cases. Alternate etiologic considerations include bartonellosis (see section, Bacteria). The condition is characterized by a proliferation of small, thick-walled blood vessels focally, multifocally, or diffusely throughout the lungs without inflammation, exudation, or alveolar hemorrhage. The vascular proliferation concurrently occurs in lung-associated and other visceral lymph nodes. The vascular proliferation reduces alveolar airspace and may occlude Lesions of ocular disease in cetaceans are similar to those of domestic animals but reports as scarce. Corneal ulceration commonly affects marine mammals, and corneal defects may develop secondary bacterial or fungal infections. Scarring is a common consequence and visual deficits can result. Corneal opacities that progress to keratomycosis caused by Candida albicans have been described in bottlenose dolphins (Simeone et al., 2017) .",

Skin sloughing also occurs as the result of postmortem decomposition and the two should be differentiated. Histologic changes in the epidermis in humans and many animals associated with sunburn include dyskeratotic and vacuolated keratinocytes (sunburn cells). In cetaceans, keratinocytes are not a feature of the epidermis. Degeneration of the cells in the stratum spinosum includes individual cell contraction and dissociation (Martinez-Levasseur et al., 2011) . In these instances, the burn damage is coupled with damage from drying/dehydration of the skin. This results in the degeneration, fragmentation, and lifting of the stratum externum and superficial layers of the stratum spinosum. In more severe cases, clefts extend below the stratum germinativum lifting the entire epidermis. The dermis contains hemorrhage, vascular dilation, and perivascular edema.

Over a 30 year time frame, 222 dead animals were recovered and available for necropsy. Of these, 39 neoplasia were diagnosed in 35 adult beluga. Malignant tumors were identified as the cause of death in 14% of the beluga examined with gastrointestinal adenocarcinoma the most common, affecting 7% of mature adults. Eight cases of mammary carcinoma were identified in 10% of examined adult females. These tumors were often metastatic and in 6 of the 8 cases, mammary gland carcinoma was identified as the cause of death in affected whales. There were 2 fatal cases of thyroid carcinoma, 1 of lymphoma, and 2 benign ovarian tumors (Lair et al., 2014) . No comparable prevalence of neoplasia has been found in other free-ranging cetacean populations. The hypothesis to explain this unusually high frequency of neoplasia is environmental exposure, persistence and possible foodweb bioaccumulation of carcinogens, such as polyaromatic hydrocarbons (Martineau et al., 2002) .",

For this reason, these proliferative lesions are designated as orogenital papillomas with the caveat that only oral masses have been identified as transforming to either carcinoma in situ or squamous cell carcinoma at this time (Bossart et al., 2005) . Oral papillomas present as raised, well-circumscribed, pale, irregular masses or plaques in the oral mucosa, mucocutaneous junction, or on the tongue. Histologically, they are composed of hyperplastic epithelium and tend to recur after excision. With time, these masses may progress to carcinoma in situ or a more aggressive squamous cell carcinoma. Grossly, malignancies present with irregular, poorly demarcated ulcerative areas admixed within neoplastic and proliferative tissue. Histologically, the presentation is classic for both concerns. The oral SCC cases bridge the mucosal basement membrane and irregular islands and fingers of proliferating cells expand from the central lesion both deeply and widely (Fig. 22.22A, B) .",

Phylogenetic studies have identified six separate species or clusters of cetacean poxviruses. These sequences cluster together but are distinctly separate from the adjacent orthopoxviruses, suggesting that cetacean poxviruses form a separate genus. This unique phylogeny fits the unusual biologic behavior of cetacean pox in creating non-proliferative skin lesions that are present for extended periods of time. No pattern regarding species-specificity of viruses has been delineated. Both toothed and baleen whales can be infected, and typical lesions have been identified in bottlenose dolphins, killer whales, harbor porpoise, short and long-beaked common dolphins, Commerson dolphins, striped dolphins, white-beaked dolphins, Pacific white-sided dolphins, dusky dolphins, Burmeister's porpoise, both short and long finned pilot whales, Southern right whales, and a bowhead whale (Barnett et al., 2015) . The \"tattoo\" lesions are foci of hyperpigmented skin variously presenting as pinpoint, ring, and serpiginous patterns ( Fig. 22.23A, B) . Lesions are generally contiguous with the healthy skin surface. Pinpoint lesions have a dark center, which may be depressed relative to adjacent skin), and may be surrounded by a pale margin forming a target lesion. Lesions can occur anywhere on the body but the flippers and flukes are generally less affected. They often wax and wane over many months and years. Studies in captive bottlenose dolphins demonstrate a marked reduction in lesion intensity to the point of clearing the skin with warming water temperatures (S. DiRocco, personal communication). Work by Van Bressem et al. (2009) with free-ranging animals strongly suggests anthropogenic factors as promoting expression of infection. Tattoo lesions commonly occur adjacent to or directly associated with areas of skin damage from conspecific trauma (rakes). Histologically, there is an increase in melanocytes in the basal layer, cytoplasmic vacuolation in the stratum intermedium, and mild hyperplasia within the stratum externum of the skin. Scattered within the stratum intermedium are small round, eosinophilic, intracytoplasmic viral inclusion bodies that displace the nucleus. Occasionally, viral inclusions are present within nuclei. Unless there is associated skin damage (as with rakes), inflammation is not a feature of these lesions. In spite of the hyperplasia of the stratum externum, these lesions are not raised.",

Based on viral sequencing, currently there are at least five PV variants. As with many viruses of cetaceans, cetacean PVs demonstrate phylogenetic relatedness to PVs of artiodactylids (Gottschling et al., 2011) . Serologic positivity to PV is high in free-ranging dolphins (90%) and common in captive dolphins (51%); ELISA reactivity is higher in males than females. The mean age of free-ranging dolphins with papillomas is \u223c11 years; it is \u223c30 years in captive dolphins. PV infection in bottlenose dolphins is common and the main route of transmission is likely horizontal with orogenital papilloma development early in life in certain free-ranging bottlenose dolphins (Rehtanz et al., 2010) . PV-associated mucosal lesions are typical and an orogenital predilection with a tropism for vulvar and vaginal mucosa, penile mucosa, and oral or esophageal mucosa and frequent involvement of the frenulum of the tongue. While far less common, papillomatous proliferations in the skin of the body, have been seen in a variety of cetaceans including harbor porpoises, killer whales, and pilot whales. Lesions can be warty and/or plaque-like, singular or multiple, and coalescing. Histologic findings consist of epithelial hyperplasia producing finger-like or warty projections along a fibrovascular core.

            "text": "Cetacean morbilliviruses (CeMV) are RNA viruses that were first recognized in 1988 following a series of mass cetacean and pinniped mortalities in Northwestern Europe. There are at least six distinct viral strains each of which is associated with a particular cetacean species. They include porpoise morbillivirus (PMV), first isolated from harbor porpoises, dolphin morbillivirus (DMV), first isolated from Mediterranean striped dolphins, and pilot whale morbillivirus (PWMV). Closely related to these three strains is beaked whale morbillivirus (BWMV). Additional, less well-characterized strains include isolation of CeMVs from a long-finned pilot, Longman's beaked whale, Guiana dolphin and, Indo-Pacific bottlenose dolphin. Cetacean morbilliviruses have also caused several mass mortality events in odontocetes and mysticetes (Birkun et al., 1999; Di Guardo and Mazzariol, 2016; Van Bressem et al., 2014) . Morbillivirus transmission is thought to occur mostly by horizontal dissemination after inhalation of aerosolized virus shed by infected individuals. The close association of animals in cetacean pods makes transmission within a group through aerosols highly effective. The migratory behavior of cetaceans promotes transmission between groups (Rowles et al., 2011). CeMV infected females may also transmit the virus transplacentally to fetuses and to neonates during lactation. Chronically infected animals likely serve as reservoirs for the virus (Bossart, 2010) . Morbilliviruses are lymphotropic, epitheliotropic, and neurotropic and they replicate in the lymphoid tissue before dissemination and infection of other cell types and organ systems. All are highly contagious and generally cause pneumonia and encephalitis with marked immunosuppression. Infection rates vary among populations.",

Secondary infections as a consequence of profound immunosuppression are common and thus the presentation can vary based on the role of these additional pathogens. Secondary infections include Toxoplasma gondii, herpesviruses, opportunistic bacteria, such as Photobacterium damselae, Streptococcus phocae, and fungi including Aspergillus spp. Histologically, CeMV infection can be pancytopathic, but is primarily associated with lesions of the respiratory, lymphoid and central nervous system (CNS) organ systems. Interstitial pneumonia is characterized by necrosis of type I pneumocytes and bronchiolar epithelial cells, interstitial edema, type II pneumocyte hyperplasia, and formation of large syncytia in the alveolar and bronchiolar air spaces. Intracytoplasmic and intranuclear, eosinophilic viral inclusion bodies can be found in respiratory epithelia, bronchiolar gland epithelia, and syncytial cells. Generalized lymphoid depletion and edema with germinal center necrosis is common and syncytial cells (Warthin-Finkeldey type) are often prominent. The cortex of lymph nodes is generally the best site to identify inclusions within syncytia (Fig. 22.24) ; virus-laden cells are often difficult to identify in the face of opportunistic bacterial or fungal infections. Immunohistochemistry is very helpful in detecting these cells. Multifocal nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis with prominent perivascular cuffs, expansion of the meninges with edema, fibrin, hemorrhage and a mix of lymphocytes and plasma cells, and multifocal areas of demyelination characterizes brain lesions. Immunohistohemial (IHC) labeling using monoclonal antibodies (MoAb) to the hemagglutinin (H) glycoprotein of phocine distemper or neuraminidase (N) protein of canine distemper virus, or a rabbit polyclonal antiserum to rinderpest virus have been successfully used to diagnose CeMVs, and are valuable when tissue decomposition impedes histologic examination (Van Bressem et al., 2014) .",

Real-time RT-PCR (rtRT-PCR) targeting the hypervariable C terminal domain of the N gene provides rapid and reliable detection of dolphin and porpoise morbilliviruses. This test is very sensitive and specific for either DMV or PMV and does not crossreact with a number of other important morbilliviruses (Van Bressem et al., 2014) . Serological studies including virus neutralization (VN) tests, plaque reduction (PR) assays and indirect enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays (iELISAs) are the main platforms for detecting antibodies against CeMV.

In these animals, morbillivirus can be detected in lymphoid tissues as well as in the hepatic sinusoidal endothelial cells and Kupffer cells, biliary epithelium, and myocytes in the tunica media blood vessels in the liver and mesenteric lymph nodes but not in the lungs or brain. If the pathogenesis of CeMV is similar to that of measles virus in humans, cetaceans that survive acute and subacute infection may show prolonged viral RNA persistence in the blood and lymphoid organs. Additionally, cetaceans that have cleared systemic DMV infection may develop lesions that localize only in the brain. Eosinophilic inclusions are only occasionally detected and syncytial cells are not observed. Neuronal processes have patchy positive immunostaining; some zones demonstrating almost no staining. In these cases, CeMV spread may be the result of cell-to-cell transmission rather than blood-borne infection. This CNS form shares histological characteristics with subacute sclerosing panencephalitis (SSPE) and old dog encephalitis (ODE), chronic latent localized infections in humans and dogs caused by defective forms of MV and CDV infections, respectively. Lesions are localized predominantly in the cerebral cortex, subcortical white matter, and the thalamus. Perivascular cuffing, diffuse gliosis, and glial nodules with neurophagia are the most prominent changes. Demyelination is less prominent than in dolphins with the acute or sub-acute infection. As in the human and canine presentations, antigen and viral RNA can be detected in dolphin brains but the virus is difficult to isolate. The mechanism of demyelination is undetermined but delayed antigen and RNA clearance from the CNS may be related to the reduced immune surveillance (Van Bressem et al., 2014) .",

The acute presentation is associated with sudden death and few, if any, premonitory signs. On gross examination, these animals have ascites along with mottled livers. Histologically, there is moderate multifocal necrotizing lymphadenitis and hepatitis with a hepatic capsular edema, an influx of neutrophils with fewer mononuclear cells, and numerous intralesional Gram positive bacilli (Fig. 22.25) . The milder, cutaneous form of the disease has been seen in display beluga whales and bottlenose dolphin calves. In these cases, a clear rhomboid shaped patch of skin discoloration and ulcerative dermatitis appears in association with a loss of appetite and an inflammatory leukogram (Fig. 22.26) . These cases are responsive to antibiotics and the lesions resolve by regression with or without sloughing of the affected skin. Additionally, development of disease in calves from vaccinated dams in enzootic populations suggests a role of species-susceptibility or antibody transfer that is protective against the acute, septicemic form of the disease.",

This group of bacteria is ubiquitous in nature and is associated with soil, detritus and water. Infections are via environmental exposure with percutaneous inoculation or secondary contamination of cutaneous lesions and animal to animal or animal to person infection is uncommon. Atypical mycobacteria do not have the ability to pass through the mucosa or the integument. Infections usually occur due to reduced host immunity or generalized debilitation. The unique anatomy of the cetacean respiratory tract may predispose to and possibly advance these infections. Multiple case reports of atypical mycobacteriosis in cetceans currently exist but to date have not been compiled and reviewed. Notable cases include: a beluga with extensive ulcerative dermatitis, panniculitis, and chronic proliferative pleuritis with a marked thoracic histiocytic exudate due to Mycobacterium marinum infection ( Bowenkamp et al., 2001) ; panniculitis with blubber pyogranulomas, necrosuppurative pneumonia and lymphadenitis due to M. chelonae in a bottlenose dolphin (Wunschmann et al., 2008) ; M. abscessus pyogranulomatous pneumonia and associated coughing and bloody respiratory discharge in a bottlenose dolphin (Clayton et al., 2012) ; and an untyped mycobacterial pyogranulomatous lymphadenitis in a pygmy sperm whale and infection in bottlenose dolphin secondary to net entanglement (Ladds, 2009 ).

It is likely that any marine mammal can contract this infection.

The disease presents in two forms, an acute septicemic form and a chronic, debilitating granulomatous form. Clinical presentation and pathologic lesions depend on exposure load and the immune status of the animal at the time of infection. The organism has been isolated from air samples and inhalation, ingestion, or contamination of open wounds, are likely sources of infection.

However, recent molecular studies have identified Paracoccidioides brasiliensis (Paracoccidioidomycosis ceti) as the causative organism (Vilela et al., 2016) . This distinction may account for subtle ultrastructural distinctions in yeast morphology previously reported between dolphin and human cases. Dolphin infections are most commonly reported from Florida (United States) to the Gulf of Mexico and extend south into South America. Recent reports from Asia are suggestive of infections with a morphologically similar organism. Gross lesions tend to occur along the torso but may occur anywhere on the body, and consist of focally extensive to disseminated, smooth, cutaneous swellings that progress to papules, nodules, plaques, verrucae, and occasional ulcerations ( Fig. 22.29A) . Microscopically, the dermis is expanded and effaced by myriad, 6-10 \u00b5m diameter, round, thick-walled, PAS, and GMS positive (mucicarmine negative) yeast that form single to multiple budding cells or chains interconnected by a tubular isthmus. As with cryptococcosis, melanin may accumulate in or be associated with the cell wall and is considered a virulence factor, protective against oxidative stress. Yeast are embedded within lymphohistiocytic infiltrates admixed with numerous foreign body and Langhan's type multinucleated giant cells, fewer plasma cells and occasional neutrophils (Fig. 22.29B ). The yeast are slow growing and depending on the stage of infection and degree of dermal infiltrate, pseudoepitheliomatous hyperplasia, acanthosis, and parakeratotic hyperkeratosis may also be seen; expansile dermal lesions, atrophy of the overlying epidermis with attenuation or loss of rete ridges and ulceration may also occur. Opportunistic bacterial infection is associated with loss of epidermal integrity. Regional lymph node involvement has been reported, but infection is usually limited to the skin and can persist in a nonprogressive state for many years. The mode of infection is believed to be direct penetration and subsequent proliferation in the dermis.",

            "text": "Zygomycosis refers to infection with members of a diverse group of fungi (class Zygomycetes) in one of its two orders, the Mucorales and Entomophthorales. The most common fungi associated with mucormycosis are Mucor spp., Rhizopus spp., Rhizomucor spp., Absidia spp., Aphophysomyces spp., and Saksenaea spp. (Abdo et al., 2012; Bossart et al., 2017; Higgins, 2000) . All are distributed worldwide and typically associated with soil and detritus. Infections are most commonly acquired through inhalation, ingestion or percutaneous inoculation of spores. The fungi are angioinvasive and fungemia can result in disseminated infections. They are broad to ribbon like, have thin hyaline walls, are pauciseptate and nondichotomously branching. The hyphae are prone to twisting and folding. Vascular infections are associated with necrosis, vasculitis, perivascular hemorrhage, thromboembolism, ischemia, and infarction. An inflammatory response may be absent or consist of suppurative, pyogranulomatous, or granulomatous infiltrates. Individual case reports of localized dermatitis, cellulitis or myositis and disseminated mucormycosis (zygomycosis) have been documented in sporadic wild stranded and managed cetaceans; mucormycosis with pulmonary dissemination has also been reported secondary to satellite tag deployment in a southern killer whale. Entomophthoramycosis is generally limited to tropical regions and involves one of two genera, Basidiobolus spp. and Conidiobolus spp. Infections are more chronic, indolent and can arise through inhalation or direct inoculation of spores from decaying plant material, soil and leaves. Host animals are generally immunocompetent. In contrast to mucormycosis, fungi tend not to invade blood vessels and infections rarely disseminate from the primary site of infection. The hyphae are broad and pauciseptate with 90 degree branching. Skin and subcutaneous infections result in localized swelling, which may be fluctuant to firm. Microscopically there is granulomatous inflammation with foreign body multinucleated giant cells and Splendore-Hoeppli material. Eosinophils often accompany the inflammation and eosinophilic microabscessation may occur.",

In most cetacean cases, Aspergillus fumigatus has been isolated or identified by molecular studies, although A. niger and A. terreus have also been reported (Reidarson et al., 1999) . Infections are generally opportunistic, acquired by inhalation with deposition of spores deep in the respiratory tract. From an epidemiologic perspective, aspergillosis in free-ranging cetaceans is often associated with morbillivirus co-infection. Initial stages of infection with airway oriented fungal hyphae are associated with invasion and necrosis in subjacent parenchyma. Gross examination reveals well delineated, grey nodules in the parenchyma with hemorrhagic margins or large cavitations composed predominantly of fungal hyphae. Dissemination to other tissues, such as the brain, kidney, and eye occur secondary to vascular invasion. Tracheal involvement with circumferential to segmental disruption and effacement of the respiratory mucosa by fibrosis and granulomatous infiltrates and variable luminal occlusion has been reported in four captive bottlenose dolphins (three with aspergillosis and one with possible zygomycosis). Severe mycotic otitis media due to A. terreus has also been described in a juvenile live stranded harbor porpoise from the United Kingdom. On gross exam, green yellow purulent exudate and caseous debris was noted in both tympanic cavities and the periotic sinuses; histologically, a large fungal aggregate was present in the tympanic cavity. Osteolytic changes were evident in the adjoining periotic bone and stapes, and small numbers of lymphocytes, plasma cells, neutrophils overlaid the scala vestibuli with granulation tissue, serous exudate, and pseudocyst formation associated with the round and oval windows. The lesions in conjunction with generalized emaciation were considered sufficiently severe to account for the live stranding of this animal. A similar presentation was identified in a by-catch harbor porpoise.",

Infections involved humans, companion animals, exotic birds, ter-restrial wildlife, and among the first animals diagnosed with C. gattii infection was a harbor porpoise that stranded along the southeast coast of Vancouver Island, BC. In the Pacific Northwest, C gattii is the primary fungal pathogens recovered from stranded cetaceans and predominantly occurs in harbor porpoises, Dall's porpoises, and rarely in Pacific white sided dolphins. Gross lesions include generalized emaciation, pulmonary consolidation, and generalized lymphadenopathy. Pulmonary lesions vary from single large, tan yellow to gray red homogeneous and occasionally centrally friable nodules that protrude above the pleural surface and extend deep into and occasionally span the entire lung lobes. In more severe infections, the nodules are miliary or become confluent with secondary bacterial and verminous pneumonia. Prominent rib impressions may be apparent. Regional lymph nodes are markedly enlarged (up to 5-10 times normal size) and on cut surface may be homogenous, glistening yellow white, and ooze clear gelatinous material or multinodular, pale gray white to brown red and associated with inflammatory infiltrates, necrosis, hemorrhage, and cavitation. Microscopically, in the more acute stages of infection, pulmonary bronchoalveolar spaces are distended and occluded by dense aggregates of encapsulated yeast with sparse to mild infiltrates of lymphocytes and histiocytes. With progression of inflammation to more chronic stages, there is nodular to diffuse accumulations of granulomatous inflammation with scattered Langhan's type multinucleated giant cells, intra and extracellular yeast, and occasional fibrous encapsulation. Similar transition from small aggregates to variably extensive sheets of yeast is noted in the subcapsular and medullary sinuses of regional lymph nodes where yeasts are often admixed with mild lymphohistiocytic infiltrates. In more fulminant disease, evidence of multisystemic fungemia may be seen in the brain, kidney, prostate, or mammary glands, in developing feti and in other tissues. In contrast to terrestrial species, adrenal gland involvement tends to be localized to the medulla, rather than the cortex. The cell walls of organisms are best highlighted with methenamine silver and Fontana-Masson stains, and the capsule stains red with mucicarmine and blue with Alcian blue stains. Although fungal immunohistochemistry is available, fungal culture and isolation with molecular genotyping yields more valuable information.",

Occasionally, organisms will attach to the mucosa of the gastric pylorus and duodenal ampula. The parasite produces a small focus of chronic gastritis at the site of mucosal attachment to the mucosa. While the attachment does not appear to be associated with significant disease, heavy parasitism can be so intense that extensive areas of the gastric mucosa (more than 50%) may be involved and covered by associated mucus secretion.

The life cycle of this parasite is likely complex, and infection is most likely acquired through consumption of infected fish (prey items) that contain the larval stages. Aberrant migration of this parasite can result in neuritis of the eighth cranial nerves, otitis media, and marked meningoencephalitis. Migration tracts in the both gray and white matter of the brain are associated with necrosis and cavitations, extensive areas of hemorrhage, edema, and an influx of gitter cells, degenerate neutrophils and eosinophils, lymphocytes, plasma cells, and intralesional black birefringent material (fluke pigment). Within the lesions, sections of adult trematodes and thick walled, golden-brown, triangular eggs approximately 50 \u00b5m in diameter are occasionally surrounded by multinucleated giant cells. Adult trematodes are 500 \u00b5m wide with a 15 \u00b5m thick, spiny tegument and contain numerous vitellaria, paired ceca, and testes, all surrounded by parenchyma. Spongiosis and gliosis may occur within the adjacent neural tissue, and the meninges and perivascular spaces are expanded by edema, fibrin, lymphocytes, plasma cells, eosinophils, and fewer neutrophils and hemosiderin-laden macrophages ( Fig. 22.33) . A study published in the mid-1980s found a high percentage of the cetaceans stranded along the Southern Californian coastline with massive infestation of Nasitrema spp., with mature, gravid (egg-bearing) helminths in the brain tissue (Cowan et al., 1986) . Because of the extent and severity of encephalitis and necrosis of the neuropil, researchers have inferred that the brain lesions were a contributing factor to the stranding of small cetaceans. Interestingly, examinations of stranded cetaceans in this same region since 2000 have demonstrated a very low incidence of this condition despite thorough neuropathology exams. This shifting prevalence may reflect a change in the dietary preferences or prey availability or distribution in this region.",

Infections have been reported in a number of New Zealand Hector's and critically endangered Maui dolphins. One study identified death in 7 of 28 (25%) dolphins due to disseminated toxoplasmosis, including two of three Maui dolphins. A further ten dolphins had one or more tissues that were positive for the presence of T. gondii DNA using PCR. Fatal cases had intralesional protozoal zoites and cysts in areas of necrotizing and hemorrhagic pneumonia, lymphadenitis, hepatitis, and adrenalitis ( Fig. 22.34A, B) . Tachyzoites and tissue cysts were present in other organs including the brain, heart, stomach, and uterus with minimal associated inflammatory response. One dolphin had a marked suppurative metritis with numerous intraepithelial tachyzoites (Roe et al., 2013) . Two of eight striped stranded dolphins in late 2007 on the Ligurian Sea coast of Italy had nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis characterized by prominent perivascular mononuclear cell cuffing and macrophage accumulations in the neuropil. These lesions were associated with mild lymphocytic and plasmacytic inflammation in the choroid plexus in one dolphin. Toxoplasma gondii cysts and zoites, confirmed by immunohistochemical labeling, were scattered throughout the brain parenchyma (Di Guardo et al., 2009) . Similarly, two Atlantic spotted dolphins were diagnosed with nonsuppurative meningoencephalitis due to toxoplasmosis in the Canary Islands (Arbelo et al., 2013) . As with the Hector's and Maui dolphins, the toxoplasmosis \"hot spots\" may suggest excessive marine contamination from terrestrial run-off, sexual recombination of parasites with emergence of hypervirulent clones, or possible occult morbillivirus infections. Sarcocystis neurona is associated with lesions and mortality in cetaceans from the Pacific Northwest. Microscopic examination of a Pacific white-sided dolphin revealed marked, nonsuppurative and necrotizing meningoencephalitis with perivascular lymphoplasmacytic cuffing, scattered gliosis, and intralesional protozoal schizonts and dispersed merozoites. In contrast, a harbor porpoise presented with moderate interstitial pneumonia, peribronchial lymphofollicular hyperplasia and florid, predominantly intravascular accumulations of protozoa, mild nonsuppurative encephalitis, cholangiohepatitis, myocarditis, and tonsillitis. In both cases, immunohistochemistry was strongly positive for Sarcocystis neurona. Tissue exams of Atlantic white-sided dol-phins performed by Ewing et al. (2002) demonstrated both skeletal muscle and cardiac incidental Sarcocystis spp. cysts in 39% of animals from two mass stranding events. Similar cysts have been seen in stranded beluga.",

They are a common commensal and do not suggest specific disease. They are referred to as \"whale lice\" but they are not insects. They can be found anywhere on the skin. Typically, they reside in genital folds, ventral pleats, nostrils, are associated with callosities and barnacles, and occur at the periphery of the eyes and within and around skin wounds. The primary \"party fact\" of cyamids is that each whale species generally has its own species of cyamid parasite. They do not experience a freeswimming phase and infections are transferred by contact. The parasites spread from dams to their calves during birth, nursing, and general contact. In the sperm whale, the parasitic relationship is sex-specific. Cyamus catodontis lives exclusively on the skin of the male, while Neocyamus physeteris is found only on females and calves. Cyamids consume the algae and sloughing superficial skin of their hosts. The rapid turnover of cetacean skin provides ample support for hundreds, even thousands of these organisms on individual whales. ",
