            "text": "The science of virology is relatively young. We can recognize specific viruses as the causative agents of epidemics that occurred hundreds or thousands of years ago from written descriptions of disease or from study of mummies with characteristic abnormalities. Furthermore, immunization against smallpox has been practiced for more than a millennium. However, it was only approximately 100 years ago that viruses were shown to be filterable and therefore distinct from bacteria that cause infectious disease. It was only about 60 years ago that the composition of viruses was described, and even more recently before they could be visualized as particles in the electron microscope. Within the last 20 years, however, the revolution of modern biotechnology has led to an explosive increase in our knowledge of viruses and their interactions with their hosts. Virology, the study of viruses, includes many aspects: the molecular biology of virus replication; the structure of viruses; the interactions of viruses and hosts and the diseases they cause in those hosts; the evolution and history of viruses and viral diseases; virus epidemiology, the ecological niche occupied by viruses and how they spread from victim to victim; and the prevention of viral disease by vaccination, drugs, or other methods. The field is vast and any treatment of viruses must perforce be selective.",

Because of the scope of virology, and because human viruses that cause disease, especially epidemic disease, are not uniformly distributed across virus families, the treatment is not intended to be comprehensive. Nevertheless, we feel that it is important that the human viruses be presented in the perspec-tive of viruses as a whole so that some overall understanding of this fascinating group of agents can emerge. Thus, we consider many nonhuman viruses that are important for our understanding of the evolution and biology of viruses.",

            "text": "Viruses are of intense interest because many cause serious illness in humans or domestic animals, and others damage crop plants. During the last century, progress in the control of infectious diseases through improved sanitation, safer water supplies, the development of antibiotics and vaccines, and better medical care have dramatically reduced the threat to human health from these agents, especially in developed countries. This is illustrated in Fig. 1 .1, in which the death rate from infectious disease in the United States during the last century is shown. At the beginning of the twentieth century, 0.8% of the population died each year from infectious diseases. Today the rate is less than one-tenth as great. The use of vaccines has led to effective control of the most dangerous of the viruses. Smallpox virus has been eradicated worldwide by means of an ambitious and concerted effort, sponsored by the World Health Organization, to vaccinate all people at risk for the disease. Poliovirus and measles virus have been eliminated from the Americas by intensive vaccination programs. There is hope that these two viruses will also be eradicated worldwide in the near future. Vaccines exist for the control of many other viral diseases including, among others, mumps, rabies, rubella, yellow fever, Japanese encephalitis, rotaviral gastroenteritis, and, very recently, papillomaviral disease that is the primary cause of cervical cancer.",

There is a small but vocal movement in the United States and Europe to eliminate immunization against viruses, for example. However, viral diseases continue to plague humans, as do infectious diseases caused by bacteria, protozoa, fungi, and multicellular parasites. Deaths worldwide due to infectious disease are shown in Fig. 1 .2, divided into six categories. In 2002 more than 3 million deaths occurred as a result of acute respiratory disease, much of which is caused by viruses. More than 2 million deaths were attributed to diarrheal diseases, about half of which are due to viruses. AIDS killed 3 million people worldwide in 2002, and measles is still a significant killer in developing countries. Recognition is growing that infectious diseases, of which viruses form a major component, have not been conquered by the introduction of vaccines and drugs. Viral diseases and disease caused by other pathogens continue to resist elimination. Furthermore, the overuse of antibiotics has resulted in an upsurge in antibiotic-resistant bacteria, which has exacerbated the problems caused by them.",

            "text": "The persistence of viruses is in part due to their ability to change rapidly and adapt to new situations. HIV is the most striking example of the appearance of a virus that has recently entered the human population and caused a plague of worldwide importance. The arrival of this virus in the United States caused a noticeable rise in the total number of deaths from infectious disease, as seen in Fig. 1.1 . Other, previously undescribed viruses also continue to emerge as serious pathogens. Sin Nombre virus, a previously unknown virus associated with rodents, caused a 1994 outbreak in the United States of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome with a 50% case fatality rate, and it is now recognized as being widespread in North America. Junin virus, the cause of Argentine hemorrhagic fever, as well as related viruses have become a more serious problem in South America with the spread of farming. Ebola virus, responsible for several small African epidemics with a case fatality rate of 70%, was first described in the 1970s. Nipah virus, a previously unknown virus of bats, appeared in 1998 and caused 258 cases of encephalitis, with a 40% fatality rate, in Malaysia and Singapore. The SARS virus, also a previously unknown virus of bats, caused an epidemic that killed more than 700 humans worldwide in [2002] [2003] . The H5N1 strain of influenza, known as \"bird flu,\" has killed more than 150 humans in the last few years and there is fear that it might eventually cause a worldwide pandemic with hundreds of millions of deaths. It is obvious that the potential for rapid spread of all viruses is increasing as faster and more extensive travel becomes ever more routine. The possibility exists that any of these viruses could become more widespread, as has HIV since its appearance in Africa perhaps half a century ago, and as has West Nile virus, which spread to the Americas in 1999. A discussion of emerging and reemerging viral diseases is found in Chapter 8. Newly emerging viruses are not the only ones to plague humans, however. Many viruses that have been known for a long time continue to cause widespread problems. Respiratory syncytial virus, as an example, is a major cause of pneumonia in infants. Despite much effort, it has not yet been possible to develop an effective vaccine. Even when vaccines exist, problems may continue. For example, influenza virus changes rapidly and the vaccine for it must be reformulated yearly. Because the major reservoir for influenza is birds, it is not possible to eradicate the virus. Thus, to control influenza would require that the entire population be immunized yearly. This is a formidable problem and the virus continues to cause annual epidemics with a significant death rate (Chapter 4). Although primarily a killer of the elderly, the potential of influenza to kill the young and healthy was shown by the worldwide epidemic of influenza in 1918 in which 20-100 million people died worldwide. In the United States, 1% of the population died during the epidemic and perhaps half of all deaths were due to influenza ( Fig. 1.1 ). Continuing study of virus replication and virus interactions with their hosts, surveillance of viruses in the field, and efforts to develop new vaccines as well as other methods of control are still important.",

Further, the development of viruses as vectors for the expression of foreign genes has given them a new and expanded role in science and medicine, including their potential use in gene therapy (Chapter 11). As testimony to the importance of viruses in the study of biology, numerous Nobel Prizes have been awarded in recognition of important advances in biological science that resulted from studies that involved viruses ( In addition to the interest in viruses that arises from their medical and scientific importance, viruses form a fascinating evolutionary system. There is debate as to how ancient are viruses. Some argue that RNA viruses contain remnants of the RNA world that existed before the invention of DNA. All would accept the idea that viruses have been present for hundreds of millions of years and have helped to shape the evolution of their hosts. Viruses are capable of very rapid change, both from drift due to nucleotide substitutions that may occur at a rate 10 6 -fold greater than that of the plants and animals that they infect, and from recombination that leads to the development of entirely new families of viruses. This makes it difficult to trace the evolution of viruses back more than a few millennia or perhaps a few million years. The development of increasingly refined methods of sequence analysis, and the determination of more structures of virally encoded proteins, which change far more slowly than do the amino acid sequences that form the structure, have helped identify relationships among viruses that were not at first obvious. The coevolution of viruses and their hosts remains a study that is intrinsically interesting and has much to tell us about human biology. In these two instances, the prize was shared with unlisted recipients whose work did not involve viruses.",

The mature, extracellular virus particle is called a virion. The virion contains a genome that may be DNA or RNA wrapped in a protein coat called a capsid or nucleocapsid. Some viruses have a lipid envelope surrounding the nucleocapsid (they are \"enveloped\"). In such viruses, glycoproteins encoded by the virus are embedded in the lipid envelope. The function of the capsid or envelope is to protect the viral genome while it is extracellular and to promote the entry of the genome into a new, susceptible cell.

First, most viruses encode enzymes required for replication of the genome and the production of mRNA from it. RNA viruses must encode an RNA polymerase or replicase, since cells do not normally replicate RNA. Most DNA viruses have access to the cellular DNA replication machinery in the nucleus, but even so, many encode new DNA polymerases for the replication of their genomes. Even if they use cellular DNA polymerases, many DNA viruses encode at least an initiation protein for genome replication. An overview of the replication strategies used by different viruses is presented later, and details of the replication machinery used by each virus are given in the chapters that describe individual viruses. Second, viruses must encode proteins that are used in the assembly of progeny viruses. For simpler viruses, these may consist of only one or a few structural proteins that assemble with the genome to form the progeny virion. More complicated viruses may encode scaffolding proteins that are required for assembly but are not present in the virion. In some cases, viral proteins required for assembly may have proteolytic activity. Assembly of viruses is described in Chapter 2. Third, many (most?) viruses encode proteins that interfere with defense mechanisms of the host. These defenses include, for example, the immune response and the interferon response of vertebrates, which are highly evolved and effective methods of controlling and eliminating virus infection; and the DNA restriction system in bacteria, so useful in molecular biology and genetic engineering, that prevents the introduction of foreign DNA. Vertebrate defenses against viruses, and the ways in which viruses counter these defenses, are described in Chapter 10.",

The smallest known nondefective viruses have genomes of about 3 kb (1 kb = 1000 nucleotides in the case of single-stranded genomes or 1000 base pairs in the case of double-stranded genomes). These small viruses may encode as few as three proteins (e.g., the bacteriophage MS2). At the other extreme, the largest known RNA viruses, the coronaviruses (family Coronaviridae), have genomes somewhat larger than 30 kb, whereas the largest DNA viruses, poxviruses belonging to the genera Entomopoxvirus A and C (family Poxviridae), have genomes of up to 380 kb. These large DNA viruses encode hundreds of proteins and can finely regulate their life cycle. Further, as stated before, many or even most viruses interfere with host defenses. In the smaller viruses this may involve only one or two proteins that interfere with limited aspects of host defense, whereas the large viruses have the luxury of encoding more than a dozen proteins that can finely regulate the host defense mechanisms. It is worthwhile remembering that even the largest viral genomes are small compared to the size of the bacterial genome (2000 kb) and miniscule compared to the size of the human genome (2 \u00d7 10 6 kb).",

Other RNA viruses, such as measles virus (family Paramyxoviridae) and rabies virus (family Rhabdoviridae), have a genome that is anti-messenger sense, defined as minus strand. The arenaviruses (family Arenaviridae) and some of the genera belonging to the family Bunyaviridae have a genome that has regions of both messenger and anti-messenger sense and are called ambisense. The replication of these viruses follows a minus-sense strategy, however, and they are classified with the minus-sense viruses. Finally, some RNA viruses, for example, rotaviruses (family Reoviridae), have double-strand RNA genomes. In the case of all RNA viruses, virus-encoded proteins are required to form a replicase to replicate the viral RNA, since cells do not possess (efficient) RNA \u2192 RNA copying enzymes. In the case of the minus-strand RNA viruses and double-strand RNA viruses, these RNA synthesizing enzymes also synthesize mRNA and are packaged in the virion, because their genomes cannot function as messengers. Replication of the genome proceeds through RNA intermediates that are complementary to the genome in a process that follows the same rules as DNA replication.",

Thus, the replication of their genome occurs through a DNA intermediate (RNA \u2192 DNA \u2192 RNA). The hepadnaviruses (e.g., hepatitis B virus, family Hepadnaviridae) contain the DNA phase as their genome, which is circular and largely double stranded.

Just as the minus-strand RNA viruses and double-strand RNA viruses package their replicase proteins, the retroviruses package active RT, which is required to begin the replication of the genome in the virions.

The latter can be considered analogous to chromosomes and can reassort during replication. In the case of animal viruses, when a virus has more than one genome segment, all of the different segments are present within a single virus particle. In the case of plant viruses with multiple genome segments, it is quite common for the different genome segments to be separately encapsidated into different particles. In this case, the infectious unit is multipartite: Infection to produce a complete replication cycle requires simultaneous infection by particles containing all of the different genome segments. Although this does not seem to pose a problem for the transmission of plant viruses, it must pose a problem for the transmission of animal viruses since such animal viruses have not been found. This difference probably arises because of different modes of transmission, the fact that many plant viruses grow to exceptionally high titers, and the fact that many plants grow to very high density.",

The decision as to what constitutes a species is arbitrary because a species usually contains many different strains that may differ significantly (10% or more) in nucleotide sequence. Whether two isolates should be considered as being the same species rather than representing two different species can be controversial. Virus species that exhibit close relationships are then grouped into a genus. Species within a genus usually share significant nucleotide sequence identity demonstrated by antigenic cross-reaction or by direct sequencing of the genome. Genera are grouped into families, which can be considered the fundamental unit of virus taxonomy. Classification into families is based on the type and size of the nucleic acid genome, the structure of the virion, and the strategy of replication used by the virus, which is determined in part by the organization of the genome. Groupings into families are not always straightforward because little or no sequence identity is present between members of different genera.

            "text": "The infection cycle of an animal virus begins with its attachment to a receptor expressed on the surface of a susceptible cell, followed by penetration of the genome, either naked or complexed with protein, into the cytoplasm. Binding often occurs in several steps. For many viruses, the virion first binds to an accessory receptor that is present in high concentration on the surface of the cell. These accessory receptors are usually bound with low affinity and binding often has a large electrostatic component. Use of accessory receptors seems to be fairly common among viruses adapted to grow in cell culture but less common in primary isolates of viruses from animals. This first stage binding to an acces-sory receptor is not required for virus entry even where used, but such binding does accelerate the rate of binding and uptake of the virus. Binding to a high-affinity, virus-specific receptor is required for virus entry, and virus may be transferred to its high-affinity receptor after primary binding to an accessory receptor, or may bind directly to its high-affinity receptor. Cells that fail to express the appropriate receptor cannot be infected by the virus. These receptors are specifically bound by one or more of the external proteins of a virus. Each virus uses a specific receptor (or perhaps a specific set of receptors) expressed on the cell surface, and both protein receptors and carbohydrate receptors are known. In some cases, unrelated viruses make use of identical receptors. A protein called CAR (Coxsackie-adenovirus receptor), a member of the immunoglobulin (Ig) superfamily, is used by the RNA virus Coxsackie B virus (Picornaviridae) and by many adenoviruses (Adenoviridae), which are DNA viruses. Sialic acid, a carbohydrate attached to most glycoproteins, is used by influenza virus (family Orthomyxoviridae), human coronavirus OC3 (family Coronaviridae), reovirus (Reoviridae), bovine parvovirus (Parvoviridae), and many other viruses. Conversely, members of the same viral family may use widely disparate receptors. Fig. 1 .4 illustrates a number of receptors used by different retroviruses (family Retroviridae). These receptors differ widely in their structures and in their cellular functions. Where known, the region of the cellular receptor that is bound by the virus is indicated. Table 1 .3 lists receptors used by different herpesviruses (Herpesviridae) and different coronaviruses.",

Poliovirus will bind only to the version of this molecule that is expressed in primates, and not to the version expressed in rodents, for example. Thus, in nature, poliovirus infection is restricted to primates. Although chicken cells or most mammalian cells that lack CD155 are resistant to poliovirus infection, they can be transfected with the viral RNA by a process that bypasses the receptors. When infected in this way, they produce a full yield of virus, showing that the block to replication is at the level of entry. Cells lacking CD155 have been transfected with expression clones so that they express CD155, and these modified cells are sensitive to infection with poliovirus. This was, in fact, the way the receptor was identified. Such a system also allows the testing of chimeric receptors, in which various domains of CD155 come from the human protein and other parts come from the homologous mouse protein, or even from entirely different proteins like CD4. In this way it was shown that only the distal Ig domain from human CD155 (cross-hatched in Fig. 1 .5) is required for a chimeric protein to function as a receptor for poliovirus.",

In the case of Sindbis virus, the situation is complex and interesting. Primary isolates of the virus do not bind to heparan sulfate. Passage of the virus in cultured cells selects for viruses that do bind to heparan sulfate, and which infect cultured cells more efficiently. It is thought that selection for heparin sulfate binding upon passage of the virus in the laboratory speeds up the process of infection in cultured cells because virus bound to the cell surface by binding to heparin sulfate can diffuse in two dimensions rather than three to encounter its high-affinity receptor.

The best studied example is HIV, which requires one of a number of chemokine receptors as a coreceptor. Thus a mouse cell that is genetically engineered to express human CD4 will bind HIV, but binding does not lead to entry of the virus into the cell. Only if the cell is engineered to express both human CD4 and a human chemokine receptor can the virus both bind to and enter into the cell. It is thought that binding to the first or primary receptor induces conformational changes in the virion that allow it to bind to the second or coreceptor. The requirement for a coreceptor has important implications for the pathology of HIV. Chemokines are small proteins, secreted by certain cells of the immune system, that serve as chemoattractants for lymphocytes. They are important regulators of the immune system and are described in Chapter 10. Different classes of lymphocytes express receptors for different chemokines at their surface. To simplify the story, macrophage-tropic (M-tropic) strains of HIV, which is the virus most commonly transmitted sexually to previously uninfected individuals, require a coreceptor called CCR5 (a receptor for \u03b2 chemokines). Human genetics has shown that two mutations can block the expression of CCR5. One is a 32-nucleotide deletion in the gene, the second is a mutation that results in a stop codon in the CCR5 open reading frame (ORF). The deletion mutation is fairly common, present in about 20% of Caucasians of European descent, whereas the stop codon mutation has been reported in only one individual. Individuals who lack functional CCR5 because they are homozygous for the deleted form, or in the case of one individual, heterozygous for the deletion but whose second copy of CCR5 has the stop codon, are resistant to infection by HIV. Heterozygous individuals who have only one functional copy of the CCR5 gene appear to be partially resistant. Although they can be infected with HIV, the probability of transmission has been reported to be lower, and once infected, progression to AIDS is slower. During the course of infection by HIV, T-cell-tropic strains (T-tropic) of HIV arise that require a different coreceptor, called CXCR4 (a receptor for \u03b1 chemokines). After the appearance of T-tropic virus, both M-tropic and T-tropic strains cocirculate. The requirement for a new coreceptor is associated with mutations in the surface glycoprotein of HIV. The presence of T-tropic viruses is associated with more rapid progression to severe clinical disease.",

For viruses that fuse at the plasma membrane, interaction with the receptor appears to be sufficient to activate the fusion protein. In the case of viruses that fuse with intracellular membranes, the virus is internalized via various cellular vesicular pathways, which may differ depending upon the virus. The best studied internalization process is endocytosis into clathrin-coated vesicles and progression through the endosomal pathway. During transit, the clathrin coat is lost and the endosomes become progressively acidified. On exposure to a defined acidic pH (often ~5-6), activation of the fusion protein occurs and results in fusion of the viral envelope with that of the endosome.

The external gp120 binds to the receptor CD4 and then to the coreceptor chemokine. The fusion domain at the N terminus of gp41 rearranges and penetrates the host cell membrane. Two trimeric helical bundles in gp41 then rearrange to form a hexameric helical bundle, which forces the cellular membrane and the viral membrane together, resulting in fusion. Fusion can be blocked by peptides that bind to one or the other of the trimeric bundles, preventing the formation of the hexameric bundle.",

After binding to a receptor, somehow the virus or some subviral component ends up on the cytoplasmic side of a cellular membrane, the plasma membrane for some viruses, or the membrane of an endosomal vesicle for others. It is believed that the interaction of the virus with a receptor, perhaps potentiated by the low pH in endosomes for those viruses that enter via the endosomal pathway, causes conformational rearrangements in the proteins of the virus capsid that result in the formation of a pore in the membrane.

The N terminus of VP4 is myristylated and thus hydrophobic [myristic acid = CH 3 (CH 2 ) 12 COOH]. It is proposed that the conformational changes induced by receptor binding result in the insertion of the myristic acid on VP4 into the cell membrane and the formation of a channel through which the RNA can enter the cell. It is presumed that other viruses also have hydrophobic domains that allow them to enter. A number of other viruses also have a structural protein with a myristilated N terminus that might promote entry. In some viruses, there is thought to be a hydrophobic fusion domain in a structural protein that provides this function.",

Therefore, in poxviruses, early mRNA is transcribed from the incoming genome by a virus-encoded RNA polymerase that is present in the virus core. For all animal DNA viruses, translation of early mRNA is required for viral DNA replication to proceed. Early gene products may include DNA polymerases, proteins that bind to the origin of replication and lead to initiation of DNA replication, proteins that stimulate the cell to enter S phase and thus increase the supply of materials required for DNA synthesis, or products required for further disassembly of subviral particles. The initiation of the replication of a viral genome is a specific event that requires an origin of replication, a specific sequence element that is bound by cellular and (usually) viral factors.

The resulting RNA primers are then extended by DNA polymerase. The ribonucleotides in the primer are removed after extension of the polynucleotide chain as DNA. Removal requires the excision of the ribonucleotides by a 5\u00a2 \u2192 3\u00a2 exonuclease, fill-in by DNA polymerase, and sealing of the nick by ligase. Because DNA polymerases can synthesize polynucleotide chains only in a 5\u00a2 \u2192 3\u00a2 direction, and cannot initiate a DNA chain, removal of the RNA primer creates a problem at the end of a linear chromosome. How is the 5\u00a2end of a DNA chain to be generated? The chromosomes of eukaryotic cells have special sequences at the ends, called telomeres, that function in replication to regenerate ends. The telomeres become shortened with continued replication, and eukaryotic cells that lack telomerase to repair the telomeres can undergo only a limited number of replication events before they lose the ability to divide.",

Adenoviruses use a virus-encoded protein as a primer, which remains covalently linked to the 5\u00a2 end of the linear genome.

The product is two double-strand circles. In the herpesviruses, the genome is circular while it is replicating but the replication fork proceeds in only one direction. A linear double-strand DNA is produced by what has been called a rolling circle. For this, one strand is nicked by an endonuclease and used as a primer. The strand displaced by the synthesis of the new strand is made double stranded by the same mechanism used by the host cell for lagging strand synthesis. In adenoviruses, in contrast, the genome is linear and the replication fork proceeds in only one direction. A single-strand DNA is displaced during the progression of the fork and coated with viral proteins. It can be made double stranded by an independent synthesis event.

Hepadnaviruses, which are enveloped, have a life cycle that also involves alternation of the information in the genome between DNA and RNA. The incoming genome is circular, partially double-stranded DNA. The genome is transported to the nucleus where it is converted to a covalently closed, circular, double-strand DNA (cccDNA). Unlike the retroviruses, the DNA does not integrate into the host genome but persists in the nucleus as a nonreplicating episome. It is transcribed by cellular RNA polymerases, using several different promoters in the cccDNA, to produce a series of RNAs. These RNAs are exported to the cytoplasm where they serve as mRNAs. One of these RNAs, called the pregenomic (pg) RNA, is slightly longer than unit length and serves as a template for reverse transcription into DNA. Reverse transcription is performed by RT and RNase H that are translated from the viral mRNAs. It occurs in a core particle assembled from viral capsid proteins, the viral enzymes, and pgRNA. Reverse transcription, described in detail in Chapter 6, resembles that which occurs in the retroviruses, but differs in details.

The core with its DNA can proceed through one of two pathways. Early in infection, newly assembled cores may serve to amplify the cccDNA present in the nucleus. These cores contain genomic DNA and are essentially indistinguishable from cores that enter the cytoplasm upon infection by a virion, and their genomic DNA can be transported to the nucleus and converted into cccDNA. Amplification of cccDNA occurs only through an RNA intermediate, using the pathway just described; there is no direct replication of the DNA in the nucleus. Later in infection, the cores mature into virions by budding through the endoplasmic reticulum. The switch to budding appears to be driven by the presence of viral envelope proteins.",

The basis for the host restriction is an incompatibility between the DNA polymerase \u03b1-primase of the nonpermissive host and the T antigen of the restricted virus. T antigens are large multifunctional proteins, one of whose functions is to bind to the origin of replication. The T antigens of the viruses form a preinitiation complex on the viral origin of replication, which then recruits the primase into the complex. Because the preinitiation complex containing SV40 T antigen cannot recruit the mouse primase to form an initiation complex, SV40 DNA replication does not occur in mouse cells. However, replication will occur in mouse cells if they are transfected with the gene for monkey primase. Similarly, monkey primase is not recruited into the complex containing mouse polyoma virus T antigen and mouse polyoma virus does not replicate in monkey cells.",

Early studies on the RNA replicase of RNA phage Q\u03b2 showed that three cellular proteins were associated with the viral RNA polymerase and were required for the replication of Q\u03b2 RNA. These three proteins, ribosomal protein S1 and two translation elongation factors EF-Ts and EF-Tu, all function in protein synthesis in the cell. The virus appropriates these three proteins in order to assemble an active replicase complex. Recent studies on animal and plant RNA viruses have shown that a variety of cellular proteins also appear to be required for their transcription and replication. One interesting finding is that the animal equivalents of EF-Ts and EF-Tu are required for the activity of the replicase of vesicular stomatitis virus. This suggests that the association of these two translation factors with viral RNA replicases is ancient.

As a second example, the replication of poliovirus in a restricted set of cells in the gastrointestinal tract and its profound tropism for neurons if it reaches the CNS was also described earlier. These tropisms exhibited by poliovirus do not correlate with the distribution of receptors for the virus, and are a result of restrictions on growth after entry of the virus. Thus in addition to a requirement for a specific receptor for the virus to enter a cell, there may be a need for specific host factors to permit replication once a virus enters a cell.

Ribosomes bind to the IRES and initiate translation in a capindependent fashion. It is known that the secondary structure of the IRES is critical for its function and that the position of the initiating AUG with respect to the IRES is important.

Thus, for example, poliovirus blocks capdependent translation after infection by cleaving the cellular cap-binding protein. By blocking cap-dependent translation, most host mRNAs cannot be translated (although IRESs are known to exist in some eukaryotic mRNAs), whereas viral mRNAs are not affected. This reserves the translation machinery for translation of viral mRNAs and also blocks many host defense mechanisms (Chapter 10).",

Termination of the polyprotein at the stop codon leads to production of a truncated polyprotein having certain functions, whereas readthrough leads to the production of a longer polyprotein with additional functions. This was illustrated in Fig. 1 .14 for a retrovirus. Two mechanisms are used by different viruses to ignore the stop codon. The first is simply to read the stop codon as sense. In this case the downstream sequences are in the same reading frame as the upstream sequences. The mechanism of readthrough is thought to involve wobble in the third codon position that allows a tRNA to bind to and insert an amino acid at the stop codon position. Both amber (UAG) and opal (UGA) codons have been found in different readthrough positions. Readthrough efficiency is variable, although usually between 5 and 20%.",

Frameshifting occurs at a precise sequence known as a \"slippery\" sequence, shown in green. Slippery sequences have short strings of the same nucleotide and are often rich in A and U. For ALV, termination at the UAG indicated with the asterisk produces a polyprotein that contains the sequences for Gag and Pro. Frameshifting results in movement into the \u22121 frame at this point so that the codon following UUA (leucine) becomes AUA (isoleucine) rather than UAG (stop), and translation of the downstream gene (pol) follows to produce the polyprotein Gag-Pro-Pol.",

The structure that is required for frameshifting in a yeast RNA virus called L-A is shown in Fig. 1.18 . The sizable hairpin just downstream of the slippery sequence is further stabilized by a pseudoknot. In this case the slippery sequence, in which frameshifting takes place, occurs about 110 nucleotides upstream of the stop codon for the upstream reading frame (Gag protein reading frame). Thus, these 110 nucleotides are translated in two different reading frames: the Gag reading frame if frameshifting does not occur, or the Pol reading frame if frameshifting does occur.

The replacement of the active site serine by cysteine causes problems with nomenclature. Here we use serine protease (or serine-type protease) to refer to a protease whose structure and active site geometry are related to those of the animal serine proteases, rather than as a description of the catalytic amino acid.

As one example, herpes simplex virus type 1 establishes a lifelong, latent infection of neurons of the trigeminal ganglia. In this case it is thought that latent state arises because the neuron lacks cellular factors required for the transcription and replication of the viral DNA, rather than because of the production of a herpes protein that suppresses replication.

It was this feature that led to their discovery in the first place and resulted in intensive study of the retroviruses. Cellular oncogenes encode proteins that regulate the cell cycle. They induce the cell to enter S phase, in which DNA replication occurs, on receipt of appropriate signals. Following infection by a sarcoma virus and intergration of the provirus into the host genome, the overexpression of the incorporated oncogene, or expression of a mutated oncogene that continuously induces the cell to multiply, results in transformation of the infected cell. The incorporation of cellular oncogenes into a retrovirus is an accident that results from recombination of the viral genome with a cellular mRNA encoding an oncogene. The oncogene replaces viral genes in the genome and almost all sarcoma viruses are defective, unable to undergo a complete replication cycle without a helper. In nature sarcoma viruses are able to cause a tumor in the animal in which they arise but are not passed on, and thus die out. The subject of sarcoma viruses will be covered in more detail in Chapter 6, after a discussion of the genome organization of retroviruses and the details of their replication.",

These viral oncogenes induce cycling in infected cells, providing an environment suitable for the replication of the viral DNA. Whereas the cellular oncogenes present in sarcoma viruses serve no function in viral replication, the viral oncogenes in DNA viruses are essential for viral replication. If the cell is not induced to enter S phase, the virus replicates poorly or not at all. Infection of a cell by a DNA virus normally leads to the death of the cell caused by replication of the virus. Thus, although transformed, the infected cell does not survive. However, if the virus is unable to undergo a complete lytic cycle, either because it is defective or because the cell infected is nonpermissive or semipermissive, the cell may survive as a transformed cell if the early (transforming) genes continue to be expressed. We return to the subject of viral oncogenes in Chapter 7, because they are an ingredient of the replication cycle of DNA viruses.",

Cells maintained in culture are normally derived from solid tissues and require anchorage to a solid substrate as well as a supply of nutrients, including growth factors, for growth. Transformed cells have a decreased requirement for a solid substrate and may have lost such a requirement entirely, and thus may grow in soft agar or in liquid culture. They have decreased requirements for growth factors and will continue to divide in medium with lowered amounts of such factors. They grow to higher densities in culture than do normal cells, and tend to pile up in multilayers on the surface of the culture dish (loss of contact inhibition or density-dependent growth). Transformed cells may be immortal and able to divide indefinitely in culture, whereas normal cells stop dividing after a limited number of divisions. Many of these changes in growth properties are reflected in changes in their cytoskeleton, their metabolism, and in their interactions with the extracellular matrix.",

Humans, in which these viruses (e.g., Lassa fever virus; Junin virus, the causative agent of Argentine hemorrhagic fever; and Sin Nombre virus, the causative agent of hantavirus pulmonary syndrome) cause serious illness, can become infected by inhaling aerosols containing excreta from infected rodents. Rabies virus (family Rhabdoviridae) is associated with unvaccinated domestic dogs and with many species of wildlife, including foxes, coyotes, skunks, raccoons, and bats. It is spread by the bites of infected animals. The virus is present in salivary fluid of the infected animal, and the disease induces an infected animal to become aggressive and bite potential hosts. Interestingly, although many humans die worldwide of rabies each year contracted from the bites of rabid animals, human-to-human transmission does not occur. Some other human infections have been contracted from wildlife only indirectly. Nipah virus (family Paramyxoviridae) is associated with flying foxes, large fruit-eating bats. The virus recently caused an epidemic of disease in pigs in Malayasia and Singapore, and pig farmers contracted the disease from the pigs. Before the epidemic died out, 258 humans developed encephalitis, of which 40% died.",

The glycoproteins are translated from spliced mRNA and transported to the cell plasma membrane. Immature virions containing Gag, RT, and the genome RNA assemble near the modified cell membrane.

As another example, the study of the interactions of viruses with the immune system has told us much about how this essential means of defense against disease functions, and this resulted in a prize for Rolf Zinkernagel and Peter Doherty.
