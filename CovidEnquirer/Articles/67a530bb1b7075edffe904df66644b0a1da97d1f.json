In particular, monthly detections of human bocavirus and enterovirus showed significant indirect correlations with KD occurrence. Several studies have shown that human bocavirus may play a pathogenic role in the development of KD using direct specimen tests from KD patients. 10) 15) The association with enterovirus such as coxsackie virus and KD occurrence also has been suggested from several case series. 11) 16) For evaluating the direct association between the occurrence of KD and viral infection, several studies have tried to detect certain viruses in patients with acute KD. Using direct fluorescent antibody assays, Jordan-Villegas et al. 17) reported that 8.8% of 251 KD patients studied were positive for more than one of 7 different viral respiratory infections (RSV; parainfluenza virus types 1, 2, and 3; influenza virus A and B; and adenovirus). Using multiplex real-timepolymerase chain reaction (PCR), Cho et al. 18 also revealed that 22% of acute KD patients tested positive for more than one of 11 respiratory viruses { RSV; adenovirus; rhinovirus; parainfluenza viruses 1 and 3; influenza viruses A and B; human metapneumo virus; human bocavirus; and human coronavirus (OC43/229E, NL63) } . 18) However, these rates of viral infection showed no differences between acute KD patients and febrile patients without KD in a small case-control study (32.7% in 55 acute KD patients versus 30.8% in 78 febrile patients without KD) using a multiplex real-time-PCR assay. 19) These reports support the hypothesis that various infectious agents are involved in the onset of KD, but do not cause KD directly. 2) 14) According to the data collected for this study, incidents of KD in South Korea are highest in the summer and winter seasons (most ",

At this time, there is no explanation for the discrepancy between the high incidence of KD and the low viral detection during the summer season. This may suggest the existence of causative agents for KD other than well-known detectable organisms. A subsequent is underway that will attempt to find a causative airborne pathogen for KD by filtering the air over Japan at various altitudes during a period when the agent is suspected to be present. 21)22) Several factors limit the efficacy of this study. First, the design of this study does not allow for the accurate assessment of individual patient-level association between viral infection and occurrence of KD. Future studies should include meticulously designed large-scale prospective studies using specimens from KD patients. Additionally, the Laboratory of Respiratory Viruses at the Korea Centers for Disease Control contributed data from only 91 primary and secondary medical institutions and may not be representative of all viral infection cases in South Korea.",
