The conformation of the mRNA containing these three elements was investigated using chemical and enzymatic probes. The probing data show that the structure is a speci\u00aec stem-loop. The bottom half of the stem is more stable than the top half of the stem. The function of the stem-loop was further investigated by mutagenic analysis. Reducing the stability of the bottom half of the stem strongly effects frameshifting levels, whereas similar changes in the top half are not as effective. Stabilizing the top half of the stem gives increased frameshifting beyond the WT ef\u00aeciency. The identity of the primary RNA sequence in the stem-loop is unimportant, provided that the overall structure is maintained. The calculated stabilities of the variant stem-loop structures correlate with frameshifting ef\u00aeciency. The SD-interaction and the stem-loop element act independently to increase frameshifting in dnaX.",

            "text": "A very ef\u00aecient programmed ribosomal frameshift is used in decoding the Escherichia coli dnaX gene. Two dnaX encoded products, g and t, are synthesized in a 1:1 molar ratio and both are subunits of DNA polymerase III. Decoding of the dnaX gene is unusual in that programmed frameshifting yields a product (g), that is shorter than the non-shift product (t; Flower & McHenry, 1990; Tsuchihashi & Kornberg, 1990; Blinkova & Walker, 1990) . Frameshifting occurs at a speci\u00aec site twothirds of the way through the coding region. The second codon in the new frame is a stop codon, and consequently the frameshift product, has only its carboxy-terminal amino acid decoded from the new frame (Tsuchihashi & Kornberg, 1990) . As commonly found in programmed frameshifting, the change in reading frame at a particular site is stimulated by recoding signals present in the mRNA . For dnaX frameshifting, three crucial elements have been ident-i\u00aeed: a 5 H Shine-Dalgarno sequence (SD; Larsen et al., 1994) , a very slippery (Weiss et al., 1989) double-shift site and a 3 H structural element (Flower & McHenry, 1990; Tsuchihashi & Kornberg, 1990; Blinkova & Walker, 1990) . Similar to retroviral frameshifting (Jacks et al., 1988) , mRNA dissociates from both A and P site bound tRNAs at the shift site, slips``forwards'' by one base, and re-pairs to permit a continuation of triplet reading, but now in the \u00c01 frame. The SD sequence preceding the shift site is not involved in ribosomal initiation. 16 S rRNA in the translocating ribosomes transiently pairs with the SD sequence in the mRNA and stimulates \u00c01 frameshifting 10 nucleotides downstream (Larsen et al., 1994) . The 3 H structure, which also stimulates the shift, was proposed to be either a stem-loop (Tsuchihashi & Kornberg, 1990; Flower & McHenry, 1990; Blinkova & Walker, 1990) or possibly a pseudoknot (Blinkova & Walker, 1990) . Tsuchihashi & Kornberg (1990) replaced blocks of nucleotides in the 3 H region and showed that the putative pseudoknot was not involved. Two different models for the top portion of the stem-loop have been proposed (Tsuchihashi & Kornberg, 1990; Flower & McHenry, 1990; Blinkova & Walker, 1990) , and the experiments presented here address this issue.",

Despite the functional importance of these RNA structures in programmed frameshifting, detailed structural information is available only for a few structural elements. Mutational analysis was used to identify pseudoknots involved in frameshifting in avian coronavirus infectious bronchitis virus (IBV; Brierley et al., 1989 Brierley et al., , 1991 and in mouse mammary tumor virus (MMTV; Chamorro et al., 1992) . In the latter case structural analyses as well as functional studies were performed on variant pseudoknots resulting in a model based on NMR analysis (Chen et al., 1995 (Chen et al., , 1996 Kang et al., 1996) . A pseudoknot was also shown to promote ef\u00aecient \u00c01 frameshifting in simian retrovirus type 1 (SRV-1) by mutagenesis and probing analysis (ten Dam et al., 1994) . More recently, a general model was proposed for the conformation of pseudoknots involved in retroviral frameshifting (Du et al., 1996) . However, some animal viruses, e.g. human astrovirus (Marczinke et al., 1994) and perhaps human immunode\u00aeciency virus (HIV; Parkin et al., 1992) appear to use a stem-loop rather than a pseudoknot, for the stimulation of frameshifting. The 3 H structural elements involved in bacterial recoding are stem-loops with the exception of a pseudoknot in the insertion sequence IS3 (Sekine et al., 1994) .",

Chemical modi\u00aecation with DMS and CMCT was done on RNA-1, the long transcript, since it was not possible to do primer extension on RNA-2 (see Materials and Methods). Nuclease S 1 cleaves single-stranded RNA with no known sequence speci\u00aecity. RNase T 1 cleaves after unpaired guanosine residues and to a lesser extent, after guanosine residues involved in non-canonical base-pairing (Felden et al., 1997) . The V 1 nuclease from cobra venom preferentially hydrolyzes double-stranded RNA and within regions containing stacked nucleotides. However, Lowman & Draper (1986) suggest that V 1 nuclease recognizes any 4 to 6 nucleotide segment of polynucleotide backbone with an approximately helical conformation, and does not require that the bases are paired. Detailed structural requirements for Pb(II)-induced hydrolysis are not known, although, site-speci\u00aec cleavages in a tRNA molecule have been identi\u00aeed (Werner et al., 1976; Krzyzosiak et al., 1988) . A particular tertiary folding and an increased\u00afexibility of the phosphate backbone have been suggested as speci\u00aec structural features for Pb(II)-induced cleavage (Brown et al., 1983) . The use of Pb(II) to probe the conformation of 16 S rRNA shows its predominant af\u00aenity for loops and inter-helical regions (Gornicki et al., 1989) . Imidazole induces cleavages preferentially in single-stranded regions (Vlassov et al., 1995) . Probing of Watson-Crick base-pairing positions with DMS (N-3 of C, N-1 of A) and CMCT (N-3 of U, N-1 of G) was done under both native (in the presence of magnesium) and semi-denaturing (in the presence of 1 mM EDTA) conditions.",

However, these regions are outside the dnaX sequence. Two degradation sites are present in the control lanes of RNA-1 (between C55 and G56, and between C66 and U67). The reactivities at Watson-Crick pairing positions on the 5 H side of these degradation sites could not be revealed, since during gel electrophoresis those primer extension products co-migrate with the degradation products.

Furthermore, this structure is not part of dnaX; it is in the downstream lacZ sequence. Another small stem-loop structure 5 H of the frameshift site can be predicted. The stem would involve nucleotides G-6 to C-2 and C11 to C16 including a bulged A. This structure is supported by V 1 cleavages (strong cut at G-6 and cuts at G-2 and C11 to A13), weakly supported by S 1 , T 1 , DMS and CMCT data and is inconsistent with both the lead and the imidazole pattern. This structure does include some dnaX sequence (the SD sequence and spacer 1 are part of the structure), but the HindIII cloning site is part of the stem.

The stimulatory effect of this 3 H structure was examined by deletion (SL del) and speci\u00aec base changes (SLM 1-22). In Figure 6 , the functional effects of in vivo mutations are summarized, using b-galactosidase as a reporter. Synthetic oligonucleotides, containing the frameshift cassette, were cloned into a lacZ-containing plasmid. The different constructs were designed on the basis of the two-dimensional (2D) structure predicted from the probing results. The FoldRNA program (the Wisconsin Sequence Analysis Package, GCG Inc.) was used to analyze each mutant construct for alternate secondary structures. In all constructs, the \u00c01 frame stop codon (UGA) was changed to UGU (cysteine) to permit synthesis of b-galactosidase. The change did not affect the ef\u00aeciency of frameshifting (Tsuchihashi & Kornberg, 1990; Larsen et al., 1994) . The ef\u00aeciency of frameshifting of all the mutants has been normalized to the WT, de\u00aened as 100%. In the WT the proportion of ribosomes that shift frame at the dnaX shift site is 50% based on comparison to an in-frame control. As ribosome drop-off is expected to be the same in both the frameshift construct and the in-frame control, we expect the estimated frameshift level to be unbiased by this issue. Deletion of the 3 H structure (SL del) reduced frameshifting to 27% of WT. The location of the beginning of the stem was tested by substitution of A29 with C (SLM 1). Frameshifting was reduced to 65%. Substitution of the potential partner (U58) was not attempted as the FoldRNA program predicted an alternate structure. The probing data argue against the formation of a canonical A \u00c1U base-pair at the base of the stem. However, it is possible that the A29 \u00c1 U58 base-pair does form, and contributes to frameshifting, but it may breath in solution and therefore show up on the structure mapping as single-stranded.",

An identical set of mutants were made that lacked the SD sequence in the frameshift window. The data obtained from these mutants are plotted in Figure 7B . Given the uncertainty in the theoretical calculations, a surprisingly good linear correlation exists between predicted stabilities and frameshift levels for both sets of mutants. More stable stemloop structures produce higher levels of frameshifting. Furthermore, the slopes of the two lines are nearly identical. This strongly suggests that the SD-like interaction, involving mRNA and 16 S rRNA, does not in\u00afuence the way the stem-loop works to stimulate frameshifting. The two stimulators work independently. Furthermore, there is a threshold stability below which the stem-loop does not stimulate frameshifting (non-zero x intercept). As expected, this threshold is lower for the set of mutants in which the SD sequence is present (line shifted to the right in Figure 7B compared to 7A), since the SD interaction increases frameshifting (Larsen et al., 1994) .

Values are adjusted by subtracting the level obtained from a stemloop deletion construct and are expressed as a percentage of the WT level. A linear regression line is shown along with the equation for the line and the regression statistic, R 2 . Data are shown for the mutants in which the wild-type SD sequence is present (A) and absent (B). viously a three-nucleotide insertion in spacer 2 showed a slight reduction in frameshifting (Tsuchihashi & Brown, 1992) . To determine if this spacing is critical several constructs with deletions or additions of nucleotides in spacer 2 were made (Table 1 and Figure 8 ). The constructs containing the 5 H SD sequence will be presented \u00aerst ( Figure 8A ). Deleting 1 nucleotide in spacer 2 reduced frameshifting to about 50%. The effect of deleting three nucleotides was tested in two different constructs. In one construct, the serine codon (AGU) was deleted and in the other the valine (GUA) codon was deleted. In both, frameshifting dropped to about 17%. This level is lower than that of the construct where the stem-loop was deleted (SL del, 27%). The effect of increasing spacer 2, by one, two, three, or four codons, was tested using two different sets of codons; both yielded similar results. Frameshifting dropped respectively to 64%, 53%, 58%, and 41% when adding one, two, three, and four codons to spacer 2 ( Figure 8A ).",

Our probing data distinguish between the two, and strongly suggest that the model illustrated in Figure 1A is correct, except that the probing results argue against the formation of the A29 \u00c1 U58 base-pair. The data also rule out possible pairing between the SD sequence and nucleotides in the loop. The \u00aeve nucleotides in the loop are all accessible to cleavage by imidazole and lead, and their Watson-Crick positions are all (Turner et al., 1988) show that the stability of the stem-loop structure correlates with the frameshifting ef\u00aeciency ( Figure 6 , and Figure 7 ). The more stable stem-loop structures cause increased frameshifting even above WT levels. The strength of the stem-loop is not the only factor in\u00afuencing frameshifting. The SD sequence 10 bases 5 H of the shift site is also a signi\u00aecant contributor to frameshifting, both in dnaX mRNA and mRNAs from other genes (Larsen et al., 1994) . Our data strongly suggest that the two stimulators work independently. The SD-like mRNA:rRNA interaction does not in\u00afuence the way the stem-loop works to stimulate frameshifting and vice versa. To a \u00aerst approximation, the identity of any single nucleotide in the stem-loop is unimportant provided that the overall structure is maintained. A similar result was observed for the pseudoknot involved in IBV frameshifting (Brierley et al., 1991) .",

One could imagine that retention of the top part of the stem-loop may re\u00afect selection at the amino acid level, but this is dif\u00aecult to envisage for the SD sequence. It is not obvious that regulation is the reason for the complexity. The dnaX frameshifting ratio appears to be set; there is no evidence for autoregulation as in RF2 frameshifting (Craigen & Caskey, 1986; Kawakami & Nakamura, 1990) . Adding puri\u00aeed t and g subunits to an in vitro translation system had no effect on frameshifting (Tsuchihashi, 1991) . However, there could be some reason for the complexity that is not yet apparent.",

The 58 nucleotides frameshift cassettes are identical, apart from two base substitutions in spacer 1 and two base substitutions in the loop. This high degree of conservation in important parts of the cassettes means that the shift cassette will have to be analyzed, in more distant bacteria, to detect variability.

In contrast, strengthening the dnaX stem-loop beyond the WT level increased frameshifting. The shift: non-shift product ratios can be set at a wide range of levels. However, in the WT dnaX mRNA the stimulators are tuned to give a 1:1 ratio of t and g. It is remarkable that levels as high as 88% frameshifting can be achieved (SLM 16) .
