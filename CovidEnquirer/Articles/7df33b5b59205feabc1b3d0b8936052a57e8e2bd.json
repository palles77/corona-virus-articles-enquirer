We reported previously that leukocyte cultures of children suffering from recurrent respiratory tract infections produce less IFN than those of healthy children (Pitk/iranta et al., 1993) .

The yields of IFN obtained in leukocyte cultures are known to vary according to both the inducer used and the cell donor. The inducer can be standardized but the inherent time-dependent variation of blood leukocyte composition and of physiological status of the donor might compromise attempts to determine an IFN yield typical of an individual. Previously, we reported that by using a set of different inducer viruses, it is possible to demonstrate that the yields of IFN obtained under standard conditions remain relative constant for successive blood specimens of healthy individuals, and that especially the ratio of 1FN induced by different viruses shows a reproducible typical pattern (Pitkfiranta et al., 1991) . In a subsequent study, we showed that leukocytes from children with recurrent respiratory tract infections produce significantly less IFN than cells from normal children, when stimulated with standard amounts of common respiratory pathogenic viruses (Pitkfiranta et al., 1993) . It has been earlier suggested, based on circumstantial evidence, that the lowered IFN yields in this group of patients may be secondary to the underlying disease, as some children had been shown to present improved responses after the cycle of recurrent respiratory infections was over (Chadda et al., 1983) . Our current follow-up study tested this hypothesis with a larger group of patients and with five different natural respiratory pathogens as IFN inducers. To avoid possible seasonal variation (Pugliese et al., 1985) retesting was perlbrmed during the same summer months, May August, similar to the initial study two years earlier. Unfortunately, it was not possible to collect follow-up specimens from the healthy control children of our previous study (Pitkfiranta et al., 1993) .",

            "text": "While responses of leukocytes stimulated with corona-or RS-viruses improved in accordance with the improved health, those due to rhino-and influenza viruses did not. This virus-dependent divergence of correlations is, as such, not surprising, as leukocyte cultures of individual donors were also previously shown to differ strikingly in their relative IFN responses to a given virus (Pitk/iranta et al., 1991 (Pitk/iranta et al., , 1993 . It appears that if we had tested the responses only with corona-or RS-virus, we could have easily concluded that the observed lowered IFN responses of leukocyte cultures from children with recurrent respiratory infections are only secondary to the underlying disease. However, the lack of statistically significant improvement of the responses obtained with the other inducers makes the interpretation more difficult. While the lowered response to coronaand RS-virus stimulation appears to be associated with the continuing infectious situation, for the time being, it cannot be suggested as a diagnostic marker for this condition as the yields of IFN from leukocytes of healthy children vary widely (Pitk~ranta et al., 1993) . One possible explanation for lower IFN-responses in children suffering from recurrent infections may be due to putative continuous stimulation of the IFN system which may lead to hyporeactivity. However acute respiratory infection has not been found to impair IFN production by leukocytes in vitro (Bondestam et al., 1984; Vanecek and Lehovcova, 1985; Pitk/iranta et al., 1993) . The age of the child is an important factor in predicting the risk of respiratory tract infections. The age of the continuously sick children was lower than that of those children whose infections had come to an end. The incidence of the illness has been shown to be higher in children under the age of three years than among older children (Wald et al., 1988; Pfnk/i et al., 1991) . The number of respiratory tract infections in early childhood can partly be due to immunological immaturity (Prellner et al., 1992) . Although contradictory findings of age-dependence in IFN production have been reported (Abb et al., 1984; Kishida et al., 1986 ) the ages within the range they showed in our study children do not affect IFN production (Cantell et al., 1968) . Thus the age factor cannot explain the differences in our IFN yields. Furthermore, when IFN yields of leukocytes from the youngest and oldest thirds out of the entire follow-up group were compared, we could not find any differences (data not shown). This corroborates previously published findings (Bondestam et al., 1984; Pitk~iranta et al., 1993) .",

Yet they already had a longer history of disease and, accordingly, had had an earlier onset of the chain of infections known to be a characteristic of some selected children suffering from recurrent respiratory tract infections (Klein, 1994) . It is obvious that children suffering from recurrent respiratory tract infections are not a homogeneous group of patients but rather may comprise distinct pathogenetic subgroups. Our current results do not exclude the possibility that a subset of patients has a genetic trait resulting in lowered IFN production connected to proneness to respiratory infections. This possibility should be investigated in a prospective cohort assessing the predictive value of IFN yields produced by leukocytes in relation to later respiratory infections.",
