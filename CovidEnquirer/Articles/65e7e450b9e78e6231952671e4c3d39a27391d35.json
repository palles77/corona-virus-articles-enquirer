Gastrointestinal parasitism alone is the most significant cause of production and animal losses in much of North America. 1, 2 There is no substitute for a thorough physical examination when trying to determine the affected body systems of a sick animal; this is especially true in diseases of the gastrointestinal system. A complete physical examination should include palpation for body condition, assessment of abdominal shape and rumen motility, observation of the consistency of the stool, and evaluation for the presence of bloat. However, because rectal palpation cannot be performed in sheep and goats, diagnosis of disease in a particular segment of the gastrointestinal system can be difficult. Therefore, the clinician may have to perform ancillary diagnostic procedures to characterize gastrointestinal diseases properly.",

            "text": "Clinicopathologic data consisting of a complete blood count (CBC), serum biochemical evaluation (SBE), and urinalysis can be helpful in differentiating gastrointestinal diseases, developing a prognosis and plan for treatment, and monitoring treatment. A CBC rarely identifies a specific disease, but it can be helpful in evaluating the severity of dehydration, anemia, and hypoproteinemia. The clinician must take care to interpret the packed cell volume (PCV) and total protein in light of the hydration status of the animal as noted on physical examination. An anemic or dehydrated hypoproteinemic animal may have normal PCV and total protein values. Both the CBC and SBE can be helpful in characterizing the presence and severity of an inflammatory disease process. Changes in the total and differential white blood cell count indicate acute or chronic inflammation; increases in globulins or fibrinogen suggest a chronic inflammatory disease. Low protein levels, especially albumin, can point to chronic blood loss from intestinal parasitism or infiltrative bowel disease. Liver disease should be suspected if liver enzymes or bilirubin are elevated. However, liver enzymes can be normal in chronic liver disease. Also, albumin levels rarely drop in ruminants with liver disease, as they do in other species. 3 Changes in electrolytes can occur with gastrointestinal disease, especially if the animals are anorexic. Electrolyte measurements also are helpful in formulating a treatment plan. Hypochloremia and metabolic alkalosis occasionally occur in abomasal disease. A mild hypocalcemia may be encountered in some small ruminants with gastrointestinal atony. Because many animals with gastrointestinal disease are dehydrated and therefore azotemic and possibly hypoproteinemic, urinalysis is helpful to eliminate urinary disease as a cause of these pathologies.",

The first technique involves tapping the lowest point of the abdomen slightly to the right of midline; it is useful in ruling out a ruptured bladder as the cause of general ascites (Figure 4-4) . 4, 13 The clinician should take care to avoid the prepuce in males. The second technique is useful if peritonitis is suspected. Because localized peritonitis is more common than generalized peritonitis, four sites are tapped. 14 The two cranial sites are slightly caudal to the xyphoid and medial to the milk veins on the left and right sides. The two caudal sites are slightly cranial to the mammary gland and to the left and right of midline. For either technique, manual restraint with sedation is recommended; the use of real-time ultrasonography may help locate fluid pockets. A 20-gauge needle or teat cannula can be used for fluid collection. 13 The clinician should prepare the site using sterile technique and provide local anesthesia when employing a teat cannula. Fluid should be collected in a small ethylenediamine tetra-acetic acid (EDTA) tube for analysis and a sterile tube for culture. Abdominal fluid can be difficult to obtain because of the small amounts normally present in both sheep and goats. The clinician should minimize the ratio of EDTA to fluid because EDTA can falsely elevate protein levels. Using EDTA tubes made for small animals or shaking excess EDTA out of large tubes resolves this problem. Normal culture values are similar to those for cattle (clear, colorless to slightly yellow, 1 to 5 g/dl protein, less than 10,000 cells). 14 Cytologic examination 1 . Weigh 2 g of feces and thoroughly mix with 28 ml of water. This is the preferred method.

Free gas bloat-caused by failure to eructate Pathogenesis. Frothy bloat is usually associated with the ingestion of legume forages or hay (particularly alfalfa) and with grazing on lush cereal grain pastures, but it also may occur with high-grain diets. 3 In the case of frothy bloat from a finely ground diet (usually corn), mucoprotein released from rumen protozoa stabilizes the foam at a low pH. In legume-associated frothy bloat, plant chloroplasts released into the rumen trap gas bubbles. Regardless of the form of frothy bloat, the small bubbles fill much of the rumen, preventing clearance of the rumen's cardia and resulting in a cessation of eructation. Free gas bloat also occurs with grain diets, especially if the animals are not adapted to the diet. Failure to eructate has a variety of causes. Physical obstructions of the esophagus such as choke or swollen mediastinal lymph nodes can cause free gas bloat. Any disease of the rumen wall can interfere with rumen contractions and eructation. Hypocalcemia, endotoxemia, pain, peritonitis, and some pharmaceutical agents (especially xylazine) can all interfere with rumen function and eructation. 1, 2, 4, 5 Clinical signs. Clinical signs of frothy bloat and free gas bloat from either food intake or physical obstruction of the esophagus are usually more severe and immediately life-threatening than bloat seen from rumen wall diseases and systemic influences. Abdominal enlargement occurs, particularly in the dorsal left paralumbar fossa. This may be subtle in sheep or Angora goats with full fleece. Signs of colic and anxiety are common. The rumen may be either hypomotile or hypermotile. Respiratory distress is evident, with some animals breathing through their mouths; death can ensue if the bloat is not treated. 3",

If the animal is not in immediate danger of dying, an orogastric tube can be passed. Most cases of free gas bloat are relieved with passage of the tube. A clinician should then take a thorough history and perform a complete physical examination to find the cause of the bloat. If the bloat is not relieved with an orogastric tube, the tube should be removed and examined for evidence of froth. Frothy bloat can be treated with poloxalene (44 mg/kg) or dioctyl sodium sulfosuccinate (DSS) (28 cc [1 oz]) delivered by orogastric tube. The froth encountered in frothy bloat caused by the ingestion of finely ground grain has a pH of less than 5.5. If frothy bloat occurs while animals are being fed concentrates, mineral oil (100 ml) may work better. Peanut oil (20 to 50 mg/kg), vegetable oil (100 to 200 ml), and hand soap (10 ml) also have been recommended in emergency situations. 3 If the animal is in severe respiratory distress, the clinician should insert a trocar or large needle into the rumen at the paralumbar fossa. If gas does not escape, or froth is seen coming out of the trocar, an emergency rumenotomy should be performed (see the Rumenotomy section of this chapter). 3 If several cases of bloat are encountered in a group of pastured animals, the entire group should be removed from the pasture and reintroduced slowly after gradual acclimation. If only one or two cases of bloat are encountered, the healthy animals can remain on the offending pasture, but grazing should be limited to ensure gradual acclimation.",

Prevention of frothy bloat involves limiting access to offending pastures or feedstuffs; providing supplemental feed and providing poloxalene in mineral supplements; and adding ionophores to the ration or supplement. When grazing or consuming legumes as \"greenchop,\" animals should be introduced to the feed or pasture slowly, preferably over 2 to 3 weeks. Animals should be closely monitored after a frost and during the rapid growth phase of plants because legumes, particularly alfalfa, may be more likely to cause bloat at this time. Certain varieties of legumes that are designed for intensive grazing systems (e.g., Alfagraze) should be planted and managed in a manner that decreases the incidence of bloat (limited or creep grazing). Feeding dry, stemmy hay for 1 to 2 hours before allowing access to the legume pasture also may help minimize bloat. Grass-legume pastures in which legumes are limited to less than 50% of the forage are safer but can still pose a problem for animals that are selective grazers. Grazing legumes with high leaf tannin concentrations (e.g., arrowleaf clover, kudzu) is usually safer because tannins help break down rumen foam. The inclusion of poloxalene (10 to 20 mg/kg daily) in the feed or mineral supplement is useful in preventing frothy bloat. If poloxalene supplements are used, keepers should feed them for 1 to 2 weeks before moving animals onto a problem pasture.",

Rumen acidosis usually occurs in animals that have been fed predominantly forage-based rations and are suddenly given access to large amounts of highly fermentable concentrates or concentrated forms of energy. It also can occur in animals that have been receiving concentrates previously, if the amount is suddenly and drastically increased; if access is denied for a time, then suddenly returned (e.g., during weather changes and alterations in water availability); or if ration mixing errors occur (e.g., leaving out monensin and rumen buffers)",

Lactate concentrations increase in the blood and may cause systemic lactic acidosis. The lactic acid in the rumen also is toxic to the rumen epithelium. Damage to the epithelium can result in leakage of bacteria and toxins into the portal and systemic circulation. Chronic sequelae to rumen acidosis include fungal rumenitis and occasionally liver abscesses. 1, 7 Liver abscesses are less commonly encountered in sheep and goats than in cattle.

IV fluids containing 5% sodium bicarbonate should be administered. 1, 11 Oral fluids are contraindicated because they cannot be absorbed and may increase the rumen distention and discomfort of the animal. NSAIDs are indicated for toxemia (flunixin meglumine, 1.1 to 2.2 mg/kg IV). 1, 11 Oral administration of magnesium hydroxide and magnesium oxide (1 g/kg) may neutralize the acidic pH and is sufficient in mild cases. However, if much of the feed is still in the rumen, these two alkalinizing agents will only work temporarily. Oral antibiotics have been recommended to kill rumen microflora and stop fermentation. However, the authors of this chapter feel they are contraindicated because the gram-negative anaerobes that need to flourish to reestablish normal rumen microflora are susceptible to most antimicrobials effective against Lactobacillus species. Removing the substrate for the Lactobacillus species is more effective. Because orogastric tubes with large enough bores to reflux feedstuffs are too large for sheep and goats, rumenotomy is indicated in severe cases to remove the feed (see the section on Rumenotomy in this chapter). After the rumen pH is cor-rected, transfaunation of the rumen microflora with about 1 qt of rumen fluid from a small ruminant is beneficial (Box 4-2). Thiamine supplementation (vitamin B 1 , 5 mg/lb subcutaneously [SC] three times a day [TID] to four times a day [QID]) is indicated until rumen function returns. 11 In certain instances, calcium may be indicated and can be included in the IV fluids (calcium gluconate). The clinician should avoid mixing calcium salts and sodium bicarbonate. Bacterial leakage into the rumen wall, liver, and systemic circulation makes antimicrobial therapy necessary. The systemic antimicrobial agent of choice is penicillin (procaine penicillin G, 22,000 IU/kg IM BID) because anaerobes are the most likely offending organisms. If treated aggressively, the prognosis for immediate survival is good. Feed (grass hay only) and water should be limited until rumen contractions return to prevent overdistention of the rumen. The chronic sequelae discussed previously influence long-term survival.",

Dietary change from a lower to a higher fermentable energy concentration should occur slowly and preferably over a 2-to 3-week period. In the case of animals being fed high-grain rations (e.g., club lambs, feedlot lambs, dairy goats), buffering agents can be added to the diet. Rumen buffers may improve milk production, increase feed intake, and increase rate of gain. The crude fiber content should comprise a minimum of 20% of the diet's total digestible nutrients (TDN). For example, the TDN is 75%, the minimum acceptable crude fiber is 15%. Crude fiber levels lower than this can be fed for short periods if the rumen is properly adapted, but problems may nevertheless occur. Sodium bicarbonate is probably the most commonly used buffer; it can be offered free choice or included in the diet as 1% of dry matter intake. Calcium carbonate or limestone (which both have low can be collected through a weighted orogastric tube. Alternatively, fluid can be collected from any normal ruminant at slaughter.

Decades of research have been devoted to the study of the pathophysiology of infectious diarrhea of calves; the pathology in lambs and kids is quite similar. Despite improvements in management practices and prevention and treatment strategies, diarrhea is still the most common and costly disease affecting neonatal ruminants. [1] [2] [3] [4] Some general preventive measures (e.g., improved sanitation) decrease disease no matter the cause. However, specific control measures such as vaccination require the definition of a specific cause of diarrhea. Table 4 -2 lists the agents most likely to cause diarrhea in lambs and kids, tissues or other samples required for diagnosis, and commonly employed test methods. The color and consistency of the feces and any gross lesions can appear similar no matter the cause. Therefore laboratory identification of infectious agents and tissue histopathology are key to establishing a diagnosis. Because autolysis and secondary bacterial invasion of the gut begins within minutes of death, necropsy samples taken immediately from euthanized lambs and kids yield the most reliable diagnostic material. Mixed infections with two or more pathogens are common, and pathogens that are a problem on a farm change from year to year. 3, 5, 6 In some cases an underlying nutritional deficiency or excess may occur concurrently with an infectious agent. Therefore the clinician should be careful to take a variety of samples to ensure that all pathogens and predisposing factors involved are recognized; continued reevaluation of the causes of diarrhea is crucial. Examination of several cases, with a focus on those in the acute phases, is important. Although examination of antemortem fecal samples can be diagnostic, laboratory testing of tissue samples may yield better results. Treatment and preventive measures specific to a particular disease are discussed with that disease in the following paragraphs. General supportive treatment and control measures are covered at the end of this section.",

After the organism attaches to the villi, it produces the second virulence factor, enterotoxin. Enterotoxin interferes with the normal physiology of the gut, with resultant diarrhea. 8 Calves have an age-associated resistance, most likely related to the blocking of fimbrial attachment to the gut, so ETEC occurs mainly in calves less than a week old. 9, 10 The mode of infection is fecal-oral.",

ETEC is seen in lambs and kids less than 10 days of age but is most common at 1 to 4 days of age, so age-related resistance also may occur in these animals. 3, 7 It usually presents as an outbreak in lambs and kids between 12 and 48 hours of age. Because ETEC causes a \"secretory\" diarrhea, bicarbonate loss in the diarrhea leads to severe acidosis, with lambs and kids quickly becoming dehydrated and recumbent. However, many infected animals die before developing diarrhea. Affected neonates are depressed, stop nursing, and may show excessive salivation. Fluid sequestration in the abomasum causes a \"splashing\" sound on movement.This condition results in high mortality if animals are not treated promptly. 7 Diagnosis. Fecal culture and serotyping for the K99 and F41 fimbrial antigens are the basis for diagnosis. Because many nonpathogenic E. coli are normal gut inhabitants, simply culturing this organism is usually insignificant. 8 Occasionally the bacteria do not express the fimbrial antigens in culture, so ETEC cannot be ruled out if the culture is negative for K99 and F41. 11 Histologic evidence of colonization of the small intestine can support a diagnosis.",

The disease occurs in peracute, acute, and chronic forms and is commonly called enterotoxemia or overeating disease. In the case of type C infection, a beta-toxin can cause acute hemorrhagic enteritis. Type C infection is seen mostly in lambs or kids younger than 3 weeks of age. An epsilon-toxin is responsible for pathology in type D infections. Enterotoxemia is usually seen in rapidly growing feedlot lambs on high concentrate rations. It also is associated with other feeding changes, including changes in type of pasture. However, it occasionally occurs with no reported dietary changes, particularly in goats. 4, 7, 39 This disease usually occurs in the fastest-growing and most well-conditioned animals. It can occur in vaccinated herds (again, more commonly in goats) so it should not be ruled out if a history of previous vaccination is present. 4 Clinical signs. The peracute form of clostridial infection is characterized by the rapid onset of severe depression; abdominal pain; profuse, bloody diarrhea; and neurologic signs. Death occurs within hours of the onset of signs. Sudden death may occur without signs of diarrhea. The onset of neurologic signs followed by sudden death is more common in sheep, whereas goats are more likely to show signs of diarrhea before death. 4 Similar but less severe signs are seen in the acute form of the disease. The chronic form occurs more commonly in goats. 4, 39 Diagnosis. Antemortem diagnosis is based on clinical signs. At necropsy, C. perfringens can be cultured from intestinal tissue samples. However, the significance of a positive culture can be difficult to interpret because these organisms can be present in the gut normally and then proliferate after death. Histologic examination of sections of the gut can be helpful. Identification of the toxins (namely the epsilon-toxin) in intestinal contents is required for a definitive diagnosis. 4, 7 Because the toxin degrades within several hours of death, not finding the toxin does not preclude enterotoxemia as a diagnosis. 38 Treatment. Treatment is rarely effective but consists mainly of aggressive supportive care. C. perfringens type D antitoxins (15 to 20 ml SC) can be administered to animals during an outbreak of enterotoxemia if clinical signs are noted before death. The antitoxin may be more effectively used as a preventive in the face of an outbreak. During an outbreak any animals that have not been vaccinated should be given the antitoxin and vaccinated with the toxoid simultaneously; those previously vaccinated should receive a booster vaccination.",

            "text": "Pathogenesis. Coccidiosis is a protozoan parasitic disease that is a common cause of diarrhea in lambs and kids. It also may cause subclinical production losses. 19 Clinical disease is often seen when some form of stress (e.g., dietary change, weather changes, parturition, weaning) is occurring on the farm or in the flock. Eimeria species cause the disease in sheep and goats; each is infested with its own host-specific species. Unlike Cryptosporidium, which can be shed in feces in the infective stage, coccidia must sporulate outside the host to become infective. Sporulation occurs under moderate temperatures and high moisture conditions. The nonsporulated and sporulated oocysts can survive a wide range of temperatures and may survive for years under certain conditions. Clinical signs. Lambs and kids are most susceptible to the problem at approximately 1 to 4 months of age, although younger animals may become infected. Clinical disease is common after the stress of weaning, feed changes, or shipping. Crowded conditions result in excessive manure and urine contamination, which is ideal for the buildup and sporulation of the oocysts. Under these conditions, animals may be exposed to high numbers of infective organisms and develop diarrhea.The diarrhea in lambs and kids is usually not bloody, but it can contain blood or mucus and be very watery. Anorexia, dehydration, weakness, rough hair coat, and death all may occur. 19 Weight loss is common, and constant straining can result in rectal prolapse. In severe cases the disease becomes protracted because of necrosis of the mucosal lining. Even if these animals are treated appropriately, the diarrhea continues until the intestinal mucosa heals, which can take several days to weeks. Permanent scarring can result in chronic poor development, even if the diarrhea subsides. 19, [40] [41] [42] Diagnosis. Acute coccidiosis can be easily diagnosed from a direct smear or flotation of feces (Figure 4-10) . In the chronic stages, most of the organisms have been shed and very low numbers are seen on fecal examination. Because normal animals can shed small numbers of pathogenic species or large numbers of nonpathogenic species, interpretation of fecal examinations in the chronic stages of coccidiosis or in animals with diarrhea from other causes can be difficult. [40] [41] [42] In these cases the clinician should rule out other diseases before making a diagnosis of coccidiosis. Blood analysis may show both anemia and hypoproteinemia.",

All animals in the group should be treated during an outbreak. The use of coccidiostats has little effect on the existing infection, but it does prevent the spread of the disease from continued exposure to infective organisms. 40 Many coccidiostats inhibit coccidia development and prevent disease if given prophylactically. 40 They are of little value if they are given after the onset of clinical disease. Sulfa drugs appear to be clinically beneficial, but they may simply decrease secondary or concurrent bacteria-induced diarrhea. 40 Because coccidia develop some resistance to coccidiostats, these drugs should be administered only before stressful events (e.g., shipping, weaning, parturition). 40 The drugs listed in Table 4 -3 and trimethoprim sulfa (15 mg/kg orally SID for 5 days) are approved for use in the United States. 7, 41 Prevention. Control involves improved sanitation and possibly the use of coccidiostats. Preventing overcrowding decreases the buildup of manure and infective oocysts. Exposure to sunlight and desiccation are two of the most effective means of killing the organisms. Minimizing stress and optimizing nutritional intake also are important. Coccidiostats available in the United States are shown in Table 4 -3 and Appendix I. To avoid toxicity in growing animals, the clinician or keeper must carefully adjust dosages to the changing levels of feed intake as animals grow. All agents except amprolium should be fed for at least 4 weeks. 19, 40 This allows exposure and subsequent development of immunity to occur while preventing the detrimental effects of clinical disease. However, coccidia can become resistant to coccidiostats; fecal samples should be periodically evaluated after prolonged use of a particular product. Anecdotal reports suggest amprolium resistance may occur on some farms. Moreover, if amprolium is offered with a creep feed rich in thiamine, its ability to act as a thiamine antagonist may be compromised. Year-round use of coccidiostats increases the potential for resistance. Therefore they should be fed only during times of expected risk. 40 The inclusion of lasalocid (1 kg of 6% premix) or decoquinate (1 kg of 13% premix) in 22 kg of trace mineralized salt fed as the only source of salt for 30 days prepartum can reduce the number of oocysts shed in ewe or dam feces. This practice can reduce the coccidia contamination of pasture and thereby remove a source of infection for kids and lambs. The benefits of administering lasalocid and monensin beyond coccidia control include increased feed efficiency, enhanced growth rate, and decreased incidence of free gas bloat. However, if coccidiostats are included in either mineral or feed supplements, inconsistent or depressed intake may result in subtherapeutic drug dosing.",

Animals with only mild diarrhea, especially mild nutritional diarrhea, may not require therapy unless they become dehydrated. If kids or lambs become less than 8% dehydrated and are only mildly depressed but still willing to nurse, they can be treated with oral electrolytes designed for calves. Fluids can be administered by bottle or by tube if the animal will not nurse. The keeper or clinician should carefully adjust the amount of fluids for lambs and kids (250 to 500 ml, or 8 to 16 oz, as opposed to 4 L in a calf ). Because most electrolyte solutions designed for calves contain glucose, after they have been mixed they should be refrigerated and any leftovers discarded within 24 hours. IV fluids may be needed to treat more severe dehydration. If the lamb or kid is too weak to stand, IV fluids are indicated. Isotonic fluids containing electrolytes should be given to replenish losses. Glucose can be added to fluids to make a 1% to 2.5% solution. Sodium bicarbonate also may be administered, especially if the dehydration is severe. A rule of thumb is to give one fourth of the calculated fluid need (see Appendix II) as isotonic bicarbonate (1.3%). Extra potassium (10 to 20 mEq/L) can be added to fluids because most animals are severely dehydrated from diarrhea and depleted in potassium, even though their blood potassium levels may be elevated. If extra potassium is added, acidosis must be corrected concurrently. After correcting the dehydration, the keeper or clinician can offer oral electrolyte-enriched fluids to replace ongoing losses caused by continued diarrhea.",

Animals being hand fed should be offered small amounts frequently to help minimize problems. Electrolytes should never be mixed with milk, but should instead be given in separate feedings.

It is the authors' opinion that antimicrobial agents should be reserved for proven outbreaks of salmonellosis and for animals with other causes of diarrhea that do not respond to fluid therapy and NSAIDs; these drugs should only be administered parenterally. The use of oral coating agents and antacids is popular, but it has not been shown to be beneficial and is not therapeutically logical in light of the pathogenesis of these diseases.

When disposing of waste material containing either Cryptosporidium or Giardia, the keeper should be careful to avoid contaminating water sources. Infected animals should be isolated to prevent spread of the infection throughout the flock. In general, infected animals should remain in the environment where the infection was first diagnosed, because it is already contaminated.

Sheep and goats are infested with many of the same gastrointestinal nematode parasites as cattle, but these parasites tend to either be species-specific or have some amount of host specificity. Sheep and goats are susceptible to the same nematodes and tend to share resistance to those that infect cattle and horses. The major gastrointestinal nematodes that parasitize pastured sheep and goats are Haemonchus, Ostertagia, Trichostrongylus, Cooperia, Nematodirus, Oesophagostomum, and Bunostomum species. The acronym HOTC comes from the first letter of each of the first four genera of parasites listed. The specific parasites that produce disease vary from flock to flock. Climate usually determines which parasites are of clinical significance on a farm, and the weather determines when the parasites will be transmitted and infective. In much of the United States, Haemonchus is the most significant parasite with respect to both clinical disease and anthelmintic resistance. Most of these parasites affect the abomasum or small intestine of young, recently weaned animals and occasionally adult animals. Sheep (and, to a lesser extent, goats) that are older than 18 months may be less susceptible. Overcrowding and overgrazing with concurrent pasture mismanagement and malnutrition usually increase susceptibility to these parasites. Inadequate nutrient or protein intake may result in greater susceptibility. 2 The life cycle appears to be similar in most of these parasite species. Adults lay eggs that are passed in the feces; except for Nematodirus species, the eggs hatch under favorable environmental conditions. The larvae go through several free-living developmental stages becoming infective. When the infective larvae are ingested by the host, the parasite completes its life cycle as an adult. Trichuris eggs are the infective stage and can survive for extended periods in dry lots or barns. 4 However, Trichuris is associated with minimal pathology. During dry environmental conditions, fecal pellets tend to trap the nematode larvae, whereas in wet conditions, larvae are released onto the pasture. Therefore drought conditions followed by rain can result in devastatingly high rates of pasture contamination as larvae that have remained in fecal pellets are released. 2 Very high environmental temperatures result in shorter survivability of some stages of infective larvae. Most of the larvae have adapted the ability to over-winter, but can survive only for short periods outside the host during spring. Nematodirus is an exception in that the developmental stages leading to infective larvae occur while the microbe is still encapsulated in the egg. However, compared with other species of parasite, Nematodirus is of minor importance. Nematodirus battus may pose a threat to young, newly weaned and therefore immunologically naive grazing lambs. The hookworm Bunostomum also is different, as it may infect the host by either oral ingestion or percutaneous penetration. With the exception of the small intestinal parasite Strongyloides, lambs or kids fed indoors or in dry pens tend to be free of parasites.",

All intestinal nematode infections produce similar signs, although infection with the more rarely encountered Bunostomum may perhaps result in more profound anemia. If they infest the animal in sufficient numbers, all nematodes may cause poor growth, decreased feed conversion, decreased milk production, weight loss, diarrhea, anemia, ventral edema (bottle jaw), midline edema, and death. Again, all these parasites can potentially result in disease, but Haemonchus is the most devastating, particularly in more temperate regions. 2 Diagnosis. Antemortem diagnosis of nematode infestation is made by examining the feces for nematode eggs. Although a direct fecal smear can be examined, the mere presence of parasite eggs is not helpful in determining the parasite load of an animal or animals. Quantifying of the EPG of feces is the best way of estimating parasite loads. The quantitative McMaster's technique for determining the EPG of feces is shown in Box 4-1. Common nematode eggs are shown in Figure 4 -10.",

            "text": "Treatment and control program. After taking a thorough history of the previous parasite control program used on a farm and determining its effectiveness, the clinician can design and implement a new control program. 2,3 However, before deciding to implement a deworming program, the clinician should decide which parasites are in need of control and whether control of these parasites is cost effective in a particular flock. Whenever possible, a dewormer that can reduce EPG counts on the farm by 90% should be identified and used for at least a year. Of all the parasite prevention programs, strategic deworming or a combination of strategic and tactical programs appear to produce the best results. 2, 4, 5 Strategic deworming is used when most of the parasites are inside the animals and not on the pasture. 2 In northern climates, strategic deworming can best be carried out during the winter, when the nematode parasites are in a hypobiotic state. When environmental conditions are inhospitable for the survival of the infective larvae, some of the most pathogenic nematodes (e.g., Haemonchus) may become hypobiotic; that is, they assume a state of arrested development. They may then mature to the adult stage when environmental conditions become conducive for the survival of their eggs or larvae. Preventing or decreasing the numbers of maturing adults by killing the larvae before the periparturient rise in parasite egg production and pasture contamination is an excellent management tool. 4, 6, 7 Unfortunately, in warmer, more temperate to subtropical environments, this method is less effective because larvae can survive the environment for longer periods. The addition of a protein supplement overlapping the expected periparturient rise has been shown to decrease the number of parasite eggs shed around the time of parturition. However, the cost of the protein supplement may outweigh its benefits. 8 A strategic program entails the use of an anthelmintic agent that is capable of killing encysted larvae. Animals are then moved to parasite-free or safe pastures-areas in which the level of parasite contamination is too low to result in infection of grazing animals. Examples of safe pastures include pastures where sheep or goats have not grazed for 3 to 6 months in the spring or fall, respectively (and depending on the climate); pastures used for hay production; new pastures (i.e., those used for corn, cotton, or other crops); and pastures grazed by horses or cattle. The use of safe pastures is paramount in any de-worming program. Rotating pastures after less than 3 months during the warm part of the year or less than 6 months during cooler months is ineffective. 3 However, if pastures are tilled and replanted, by the time new grazeable forage is available, infective parasite larvae will be dead or significantly decreased. 3 An alternative to pasture rotation is to perform an initial strategic deworming before lambing or kidding and follow it with two to four more dewormings at 3week intervals throughout the lambing and kidding period. [9] [10] [11] Treating lambs or kids at weaning and moving them to a safe pasture is a form of strategic deworming. 4 In lambs or kids to be sold at an early age, the administration of a single anthelmintic treatment followed by a move to a safe pasture may be all that is required. A \"double treat and move\" system is required for lambs kept for 12 to 18 weeks after weaning, particularly during the summer. 12, 13 This form of strategic deworming requires two treatments 6 to 8 weeks apart as well as two safe pastures. In northern climates where animals are moved to a dry lot or barn for the winter, a strategic anthelmintic administration as animals are moved off pasture can help reduce the parasite burden through the winter. 14 If this deworming is followed by minimal or no exposure to grazing areas and another dewormer is administered before the spring rise in fecal egg counts, the total parasite burden on spring pasture can be drastically reduced, effectively controlling parasites until summer or fall.",

            "text": "Tactical deworming programs are used to remove parasites from their hosts before they enter their reproductive phase and can contaminate the pasture. 4 An example of tactical deworming is treating animals 10 to 14 days after a rain, particularly if the rain has followed a drought. Parasite transmission is worse in most flocks during this time as pastures become heavily contaminated. McMaster's counts of more than 1000 EPG in the spring or more than 2000 EPG in the fall warrant tactical deworming. 2, 4, 7 Opportunistic deworming and salvage deworming are usually less effective in long-term flock management. Many times salvage deworming programs are used to save the lives of heavily parasitized animals. 4 If animals are dewormed only after showing signs of parasitism (e.g., bottle jaw, anemia), animal and flock productivity have already been depressed. Deworming during handling for other procedures (e.g., castration, vaccination, shearing) is an example of an opportunistic program. It is convenient but is not conducive to long-term flock health. Flock work should be scheduled around parasite management programs, not vice versa. 2, 14 Suppressive deworming programs entail the use of anthelmintics at regular intervals, usually every 2 to 4 weeks. Suppressive programs are labor-intensive, tend to be very expensive, fail to identify animals with superior immunity to parasites, and ultimately result in anthelmintic resistance despite initial effectiveness. 2, 4 As a general rule, the more frequently deworming occurs, the more quickly resistance is attained to anthelmintics. After deworming, only resistant parasites remain to infect the animal and they are able to reproduce freely, resulting in proliferation of resistant strains. 2, 4 Using drugs that remain in tissues at inappropriately low concentrations and treating and retaining immunocompromised animals encourage the development of anthelmintic resistance. Practices that ensure adequate dosages, proper treatment techniques, and appropriate types of anthelmintics should be emphasized. 2, 13 The clinician should do everything in his or her power to minimize the incidence of anthelmintic resistance, both through their own actions and by counseling owners in proper use of deworming drugs. The product development market for anthelmintics is the cattle industry. The small sheep and goat markets simply use drugs made available for cattle. Because most available anthelmintics are highly effective in controlling parasites, anthelmintic resistance in sheep and goats must be avoided. The anthelmintics that have been used previously on a flock, the route of administration (e.g., PO, SC, IM, pour-on), and the length of use should be determined. Few dewormers are approved for use in sheep and goats, but many approved for use in cattle and horses may be effective. 2, 7 If sheep graze with goats that harbor anthelmintic-resistant parasites, the sheep also may become infected. 4 However, if sheep are allowed to graze while the goats browse and the two groups rarely mingle, less parasite movement will occur between these species.",

            "text": "Resistance to macrolides (e.g., ivermectin, doramectin, moxidectin) does occur. Resistant worms are generally not very tolerant of cold temperatures and therefore resistance to this drug class in northern environments is not as large a problem as it is in more temperate or subtropical zones. 15 Although moxidectin is not approved for use in sheep and goats in the United States, it has been shown to be effective in cases where ivermectin resistance is encountered. 2 Still, this drug should be avoided until all other anthelmintics have failed. Craig 3, 4 has suggested that clinicians refrain from injecting or using pour-on macrolide preparations designed for cattle in small ruminants. This practice may enhance the development of resistant strains of some internal parasites because of inappropriately low drug absorption (with pour-on use) or long-term subtherapeutic levels (with injection). 4 If resistance to tetrahydropyrimidines (e.g., morantel, pyrantel) occurs in a flock, levamisole also may be ineffective. Morantel and levamisole resistance in parasites appears to be sex-linked. Therefore if animals are not exposed to these drugs for several years, reversion to susceptibility can occur. 3, 4 If resistance to one of the benzimidazole dewormers has been documented in a flock, some resistance to all members of that class is likely. 4 Benzimidazole-resistant Haemonchus species appear to be more virulent, produce more eggs, cause greater environmental contamination, and survive in the environment as free-living larvae for longer periods. Benzimidazole-resistant parasites apparently do not revert to susceptible forms, even over long periods. Therefore the clinician or keeper should exercise caution to minimize resistance. 4 Benzimidazole efficacy can be improved by increasing dosages, dividing dosages into two treatments administered at 12-hour intervals, and instituting pretreatment fasting. 2 If resistance to numerous classes of anthelmintics occurs on a farm, combining two of the resistant classes of dewormers (fenbendazole and levamisole) has proven effective. 16 When using combined dewormers, the clinician should administer the full therapeutic dosage of each. Anthelmintics are metabolized at different rates by sheep and goats. Goats may require larger dosages of some dewormers than sheep. 7 Craig 4 has suggested that if no dose rate is known for a particular anthelmintic for sheep or goats, the animals should be treated at twice the suggested cow dosage. Pour-on anthelmintics designed for cattle tend to be of limited value when used topically on either goats or sheep. 2 Table 17 -3. To maximize a parasite control program, anthelmintics that appear effective should be used for only 1 year before a new class of deworming drug is used. More frequent rotation (after less than 1 year) of anthelmintic agents hastens resistance and should be avoided whenever possible.",

Underdosing can hasten the formation of parasitic resistance and therefore should be avoided. 4 Holding the sheep or goats in a dry lot overnight or feeding only dry hay for 12 to 24 hours before and 12 hours after deworming appears to improve the efficacy of some orally administered anthelmintic agents (benzimidazole). Limiting feed intake before deworming slows the rate of passage of ingesta through the bowel, enhancing drug effectiveness. 2, 13, 14 Feed should never be withheld from sick or debilitated animals or late-term females. 2, 13, 14 Most dewormers may effectively control adult or larval parasites but are ineffective against eggs. Therefore animals should be kept on a dry lot for as long as 3 days after deworming, then moved to a safe pasture. Use of this procedure minimizes parasite egg contamination of the new pasture because most of the egg-contaminated feces is voided within 72 hours of deworming. If more than one dosage appears on the drug label, the larvacidal dose should be used (fenbendazole at 10 mg/kg rather than 5 mg/kg). 2 Anthelmintic effectiveness can be determined by comparing a McMaster's fecal EPG on the day of deworming with one taken 7 to 14 days later. If less than a 90% drop in EPG is found, anthelmintic resistance exists and the animals should be switched to another class of dewormer. 2 Although it is a controversial method, the authors have used this technique to identify anthelmintic effectiveness for many years and on many farms and ranches. 2, 14 The authors randomly collect feces from 5% to 10% (or a minimum of 10 animals) of the sheep or goats on the farm. A composite sample is prepared by combining equal amounts of stool from all animals. Craig 3 has suggested that combining stool samples from many animals alters the accuracy of the tests because great individual variation in fecal egg counts occurs among animals. Composite egg counts more accurately reflect parasite burdens in groups of young animals, and individual fecal examinations are more accurate in adults. 2, 4 Still, the authors prefer to use composite samples unless obvious differences in stool character or body condition score exist among the sampled animals. Anthelmintic resistance can be minimized by using drugs that reduce fecal egg counts by 90%. Pre-and postdeworming changes in EPG should be evaluated yearly or whenever resistance is suspected. 4 In vitro methods of assessing flock parasite resistance also are available at some diagnostic laboratories. In most in vitro tests, larvae are hatched from collected feces and the sensitivity of different anthelmintics is determined by larval exposure. These tests are very accurate but tend to be quite expensive.",

Only a small number of flock members contribute the greatest amount of environmental parasite contamination because susceptible animals shed the most eggs in their feces. Animals with the lowest EPG in a flock may be those that possess the most parasite resistance. 4 Salvage deworming programs should generally be avoided, but they may be used as aggressive selection criteria. That is, animals that do well with little or no deworming, particularly those grazing heavily contaminated pastures, should be identified and retained in the breeding flock. Those that become infected should be dewormed to salvage them or save their lives and then sold when possible. Proper record keeping and identification of all animals is paramount in selecting for parasite resistance. 2, 14 This aggressive approach can yield excellent results if it is carefully implemented, but devastating losses can occur if it is poorly managed.",

Sheep strains of Johne's disease and some goat variant strains seem to be more difficult to culture in media used to identify cattle strains of the disease.Therefore fecal culture in sheep and goats appears to be of limited benefit. 19, 20 A relatively inexpensive and easily performed method of identifying approximately 50% of all clinically infected animals is acid-fast staining of fecal smears. 18, 19 A PCR test of feces also is available, but its sensitivity is lower than that of fecal culture. Good diagnostic results can be obtained with serologic testing for antibodies (e.g., agar gel immunodiffusion [AGID], enzyme-linked immunospecific assay [ELISA], complement fixation) in animals showing clinical signs. The specificity of all the serologic tests is greater than 95% in sheep and goats with signs of clinical disease, although the sensitivity is not as high. [19] [20] [21] Therefore a positive serologic test in an animal showing clinical signs indicates that the animal has Johne's disease. However, the disease cannot be ruled out with a negative test. Sheep and goats appear to respond differently in regard to the formation of antibodies. Sheep tend to develop antibodies in the later stages of the disease, whereas antibodies may be detected much earlier in the goat. The AGID test appears to be the best serologic test currently available. 22, 23 The ELISA and complement fixation tests can cross-react with Corynebacterium pseudotuberculosis, making them of limited value in flocks with caseous lymphadenitis infections. 19, 24 Necropsy diagnosis is based on the finding of thickened, corrugated intestines, especially in the area of the ileum. Acid-fast staining of impression smears (taken from the ileum and ileocecal lymph nodes) can help yield a quick diagnosis.

This evagination of the rectal mucosa and rectal structures (and possibly the descending colon) is usually associated with excessive straining. Straining is seen in lambs with diarrhea caused by coccidiosis, Salmonella, or dietary imbalances, in ewes or ewe lambs with vaginal prolapse, in males with urolithiasis, and in animals grazing lush forage (particularly legumes such as alfalfa and clover). It also can occur secondary to chronic coughing, short tail docking, and the use of growth implants. [5] [6] [7] Rabies also can cause chronic straining and rectal prolapse. [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] Regardless of the cause, after the rectal mucosa becomes everted and exposed, irritation of the mucosa causes further straining, which exacerbates the problem. Venous drainage of the prolapse may be compromised, but the arterial supply usually remains intact and contributes to the swelling. Rectal prolapses are graded as Type I to IV, based on the portion of rectum and distal colon that is everted. 5 A description of these grades in shown in Table 4 -4.",

However, if less aggressive therapies do not relieve the problem in 24 hours, a purse-string suture may become necessary, particularly in Type I and II prolapse. In all cases and modes of treatment, restricting feed for 24 to 48 hours and administering mineral oil is recommended.

The clinician should tie the suture in a bow knot to allow easy identification over the next few days and then remove the tubular object.

The clinician should regularly reevaluate the animal and if possible loosen the purse-string suture at 24-hour intervals until no tension exists.

Another circular incision is made just distal to the caudal extent of the prolapse into the point where the mucosa reflects on itself on the innerside of the prolapse. The clinician connects these two incisions with a longitudinal incision parallel to the prolapse and dissects the mucosa between the circumferential incisions. 5 The mucosal edges are then sutured with a simple interrupted pattern using a suitable absorbable suture material. After completely suturing the mucosal surfaces, the clinician removes the two spinal needles and places a purse-string suture in the anal sphincter. Placement of the suture and follow-up care are the same as described for the purse-string suture technique. Submucosal resection decreases the incidence of both peritonitis and stricture formation compared with other surgical techniques, but it is expensive. 5 In all of these techniques, a caudal epidural anesthetic (2% lidocaine, 0.5 ml per 45 kg) is recommended to decrease straining and ease pain from the procedures. 6,7 A xylazine epidural (0.01 to 0.03 mg/kg as sufficient [QS] to 2 ml with 2% lidocaine) may give longer relief (approximately 4 to 6 hours) from straining than lidocaine.

It is most common in thin or obese ewes or does with a single large fetus, twins, or triplets. 1 During late gestation, particularly in obese females, the abdominal space is filled with accumulated fat and an ever-expanding uterus. Because of the lack of rumen space, these females have difficulty consuming enough feedstuffs to satisfy energy requirements. In most management systems, late gestation occurs during the winter months, when less pasture is available and poorer-quality feedstuffs are offered. Energy requirements for ewes and does carrying twins or triplets is greatly increased during the final 2 months of gestation because 70% to 80% of fetal growth occurs during this time. Ewes with twins require 180% more energy, and those with triplets need 200% to 250% more dietary energy. Pregnancy toxemia also occurs in association with anorexia caused by other diseases (foot rot, OPP, CAE) or sudden stresses (feed or weather changes, predator attacks, hauling). Whatever the initiating cause, a period of anorexia and lack of sufficient energy intake result in a negative energy balance. These animals begin to mobilize body stores of fat and transport them to the liver. In the liver, fat is catabolized to glycerol and free fatty acids (FFAs). FFAs can be used in the citric acid cycle (Krebs cycle) as an energy source, but not in the direct formation of glucose. Anorexic animals have less ruminal substrate available for production of the glucose precursor propionic acid. However, oxaloacetate, which is an integral part of the citric acid cycle, is removed from the cycle and converted into glucose. Depletion of oxaloacetate inhibits the normal citric acid cycle's function, inhibiting the use of FFAs. As the pool of FFAs increases, they are converted to ketone bodies or repackaged into lipoproteins. Because ruminants are not efficient at transporting lipoproteins out of the liver and back to the adipose stores, the lipoproteins overwhelm the liver's ability to handle this massive buildup, resulting in a fatty liver. Because less substrate is available for glucose formation, more oxaloacetate is \"cannibalized\" from the citric acid cycle, further inhibiting the body's ability to use FFAs. This in turn causes the continued accumulation of ketone bodies. Hypoglycemia, hy-perketonemia, and potentially uremia and death can occur.",

A balanced electrolyte solution with extra calcium (25 ml of a 23% calcium borogluconate per liter), potassium (10 to 20 mEq/L), and 5% dextrose is needed. In some cases, sodium bicarbonate is valuable in treating acidosis (see Appendix II). Energy intake must be increased, and propylene glycol can be administered (15 to 30 ml every 12 hours) as a glucose precursor. Rumen transfaunation and supplementation with vitamin B complex (including vitamin B 12 , biotin, niacin, and thiamine) also are recommended. After females become recumbent, treatment must be very aggressive. Removal of the fetuses is crucial in these cases. Chemically inducing parturition (by administering 2.5 to 10 mg of prostaglandin F 2a or 0.75 mg/45 kg of cloprostenol in does and 15 to 20 mg of dexamethasone in ewes) and giving the ewe or doe medical support (fluids, B vitamins, glucose) while waiting is a useful protocol in some cases. Unfortunately, during the time before parturition, endotoxemia from dead fetuses further compromises the female. For this reason, the authors recommend immediate Cesarean section on depressed moribund animals (see Chapters 6 and 16) . The owner should be forewarned of the poor prognosis for animals already in a moribund state. Fluid support during and after surgery is crucial.",

Clinical signs. F. hepatica infestation usually causes acute disease in sheep and goats but can present as a chronic condition. Chronic disease is the result of the mature flukes in the bile ducts and is manifested in depressed growth and milk production. Acute disease occurs when large numbers of immature flukes migrate at once, particularly in animals with limited immunity to flukes. Signs include anorexia, depression, weakness, dyspnea, anemia, ascites, colic-like signs, dry feces, and sudden death. The clinical signs are identical to those of nematode infestations (i.e., chronic weight loss, ill thrift, diarrhea, anemia, hypoproteinemia). Similar but more severe signs occur with F. magna infection, which is usually fatal. 2, 5, 8 Diagnosis. Antemortem diagnosis of fluke infestation can be difficult. Finding eggs in feces is diagnostic for F. hepatica. Eggs are only produced by adults and not in great numbers, so a negative fecal test cannot preclude acute or chronic fascioliasis. Fluke eggs do not float in routine fecal flotation methods used for nematode diagnosis; a sedimentation technique should be used for suspected fluke infestations. To perform a sedimentation test, the clinician mixes 2 to 3 g of feces with 200 ml of tap water and strains the mixture through a tea strainer into a beaker. The sediment can be examined 15 minutes later under a dissecting microscope. Eggs are light yellow to golden and have an operculum at one end (see Figure  4 -10). F. magna does not mature, so eggs are not produced and fecal examination is of no value. Most fluke infestations are discovered by finding the flukes at necropsy or slaughter. An ELISA test may be available in the future. 2, 5, 8 CBCs of affected animals may indicate eosinophilia and anemia. Increased liver enzymes and hypoalbuminemia also are occasional findings.",

If fascioliasis is diagnosed at necropsy, the remaining animals in the herd should be treated. Because flukicides available in the United States are highly effective only against mature flukes, the timing of treatment is important. In the southern portions of North America the snails are ingested in the spring and the flukes migrate in the summer and mature in the fall. In cooler, northern climates, snails may remain active during summer, so flukes can mature in the fall and into the winter. Clinicians should begin treatment in the southern United States in the late summer or early fall. A single treatment in late winter or early spring is commonly used in the northern climates of North America. Albendazole (15-20 mg/kg orally) and clorsulon (7 mg/kg orally, 2 mg/kg SC) are very effective against adult F. hepatica. 2, 9, 10 Clorsulon has no efficacy against nematode parasites but is highly efficacious against both adult and late-stage immature flukes. Albendazole (15 mg/kg orally) is somewhat useful in controlling F. magna at 8 weeks after infestation, and clorsulon is effective only at very high dosages. [11] [12] [13] Unfortunately, neither agent can kill 100% of F. magna, and only a few remaining flukes can be fatal.",

In sheep, a Cuto-Mo ratio greater than 10\u03fa1 leads to the accumulation of excess Cu.

Acute disease is seen when Cu is suddenly released from the liver in large amounts. Stress usually precipitates this acute phase. Acute release and subsequent high blood Cu concentrations cause an acute hemolytic crisis, resulting in anemia, hemoglobinuria, and acute renal failure. Existing hepatic disease (such as that caused by liver flukes) may predispose animals to this condition. Some breeds seem to be prone to Cu absorption and storage problems (Merino sheep), whereas others tend to be more resistant and prone to deficiency (pygmy goats) (see Chapters 2 and 3).",

Animals can be sedated and then infiltrated with a local anesthetic or placed under general anesthesia. The area around the hernia is clipped and surgically prepared. The clinician opens the hernial sac and introduces a finger into the abdomen to ensure that no viscera have adhered to the inner lining of the ring and that no enlarged or infected umbilical remnants are present. He or she then carefully excises the ring and closes the defect in the abdominal wall. This closure can be made by simply opposing the abdominal wall with a horizontal mattress pattern stitch (absorbable suture). An alternate closure of the abdominal wall is to suture the peritoneal lining in a separate pattern and close the abdominal wall defect so one side of the defect is pulled to overlap the other side. The upper free edge is sutured to the opposite wall with a near-far-far-near pattern. The authors choose not to employ surgical techniques that slow this procedure. The subcutaneous tissue can be closed with simple interrupted pattern using absorbable suture and the skin should be closed with whatever pattern the clinician prefers. Animals should be given tetanus prophylaxis and antibiotics. They should be closely monitored for signs of sepsis and surgical failure. Exercise should be limited for 7 to 14 days after surgery.",

Contamination of the umbilicus, retracting of these structures after stretching and breaking, and chemical damage (from strong tincture of iodine) to the amniotic remnants are other possible causes. 1,2,3 Dipping the umbilicus with iodine or iodine-chloriodine substances is a common practice. Aggressive use of these chemicals may precipitate serious inflammation of the cord. Excessive torsion of the umbilical cord, distention of the proximal urachus, and some genetic factors may all be associated with patent urachus, which also may occur as a sequela to omphaloarteritis or omphalophlebitis.",

Palpation and transabdominal ultrasonographic evaluation reveal an enlarged cord-like structure ascending from the umbilicus cranially (umbilical vein) or caudally (urachus or um-bilical artery). Ultrasonographic evaluation may indicate an abscess or thickened tissue. Patent urachus is associated with dermatitis, urine scalding of the ventral abdomen, and urine dribbling. If the urachus becomes infected it may leak urine intraperitoneally or subcutaneously. Both of these developments may be identified with abdominal palpation, ballottement, ultrasonographic evaluation, and, when indicated, paracentesis. 1 The CBC may indicate neutrophilia. Blood culture is indicated if sepsis occurs simultaneously. Occasionally infection of the internal structures may occur with no outward umbilical swelling. Deep abdominal palpation and/or the use of real-time ultrasound are necessary to attain a diagnosis. Animals with umbilical infections also may have signs of septicemia, anorexia, depression, joint distention, and fever.",

The area around the umbilicus should be clipped and surgically prepared, and the animal should be placed on a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent 2 to 4 hours before surgery. The clinician opens the abdomen lateral to the umbilicus and digitally explores the adjacent area for adhesion formation. The urachus should be identified and followed to the urinary bladder.

Prolonged antibiotic therapy with a broad-spectrum antimicrobial agent (ceftiofur 2.2 mg/kg SID or oxytetracycline 20 mg/kg SC every 72 hours) may be attempted. However, if medical therapy is ineffective, the infected umbilical remnants should be marsupialized or excised. The authors prefer more aggressive, surgical removal of the umbilical rem-nants. As with urachal surgery, the abdomen should be opened lateral to the umbilicus. Depending on the severity of infection and the amount of tissue involved, the clinician may need to perform extensive dissection of necrotic tissue and possibly intestinal resection. 3 If the infection of the umbilical vein extends to and involves the liver, marsupialization of the umbilical vein is an effective method of therapy. 2, 3 The clinician can pull the vein to the most cranial portion of the abdominal incision and suture it to the muscle layers and skin before closing the abdomen as described for umbilical hernia repair. However, a preferable method is to close the abdominal wall, pull the transected umbilical vein through, and suture it to a separate stab incision. This may help minimize the incidence of abdominal wall herniation. Only monofilament, absorbable, non-gut suture material should be used. 3 The venous stump should be flushed daily with antiseptic solution (1% chlorhexidine, 0.1% povidone iodine), and the animal should be maintained on antibiotics for more than 14 days. The venous stump usually closes within a month. 3",

The miracidia develop through several intermediate hosts to form cercariae, which emerge from the intermediate hosts to encyst as infective metacercariae on forage. Sheep or goats accidentally ingest the metacercariae, which then encyst in the small intestine. They can migrate into the liver in approximately 6 weeks and may begin to lay eggs within 3 months after infection. F. hepatica is capable of laying eggs in sheep for several years. The flukes also can migrate into the bile ducts or through hepatic tissue, leaving large anaerobic tracts and producing acute or chronic disease. 7 Sheep and goats are definitive hosts for F. hepatica, whereas only some species of deer and elk are definitive hosts for F. magna. F. magna, unlike F. hepatica, never matures and continues to migrate, causing severe damage and death. 7,8 F. magna does not complete its life cycle in sheep or goats.
