METHODS: We performed a prospective diary card exercise in 69 patients with CVID recruited from a primary immunodeficiency clinic in the United Kingdom, generating 6210 days of symptom data. We collected microbiology (sputum microscopy and culture, atypical bacterial PCR, and mycobacterial culture) and virology (nasopharyngeal swab multiplex PCR) samples from symptomatic patients with CVID. RESULTS: There were 170 symptomatic exacerbations and 76 exacerbations treated by antibiotics. The strongest symptomatic predictors for commencing antibiotics were cough, shortness of breath, and purulent sputum. There was a median delay of 5 days from the onset of symptoms to commencing antibiotics. Episodes characterized by purulent sputum responded more quickly to antibiotics, whereas sore throat and upper respiratory tract symptoms responded less quickly. A pathogenic virus was isolated in 56% of respiratory exacerbations and a potentially pathogenic bacteria in 33%. CONCLUSIONS: Patients with CVID delay and avoid treatment of symptomatic respiratory exacerbations, which could result in structural lung damage. However, viruses are commonly represented and illnesses dominated by upper respiratory tract symptoms respond poorly to antibiotics, suggesting that antibiotic usage could be better targeted. \u00d3 Common variable immunodeficiency (CVID) is a heterogeneous primary immunodeficiency in which patients fail to produce adequate levels of immunoglobulins.

[6] [7] [8] [9] Respiratory tract infections were thought to be caused largely by encapsulated bacteria. 6, 10 However, recent evidence shows that there may be a significant contribution from viral infections. 11, 12 Despite the high incidence of respiratory tract infections and their negative influence on quality of life in primary antibody deficiency syndromes, 13 the nature of symptoms during these episodes remains unknown. Patients are often prescribed antibiotics to mitigate respiratory tract infections, both as \"rescue\" courses to promptly self-administer for acute events and as prophylaxis to reduce infection frequency. However, the symptomatic triggers for taking breakthrough antibiotics and the clinical response to these treatments are not known.",

Although this may be partly explained by underlying bronchiectasis in some patients, we frequently observed co-infection with bacteria. Although this may represent simply colonizing bacteria in the presence of an acute viral exacerbation, there is evidence from COPD that rhinovirus infections adversely affect microbiome and the prevalence of pathogenic bacteria. 21, 22 Our earlier results suggest that new or worsening purulent sputum predicts rapid response to antibiotic therapy, regardless of the organism isolated. Further research is required to investigate how the pathogens identified here influence the balance of other organisms in the respiratory tract and thereby the response to antibiotic therapy. However, our current recommendation would be to promptly treat exacerbations characterized by purulent sputum irrespective of virology results, not least because neutrophil elastase is significantly implicated in bronchiectasis pathogenesis. 22, 23 Our study has some limitations. It was performed at a single tertiary care center during the winter, when respiratory tract infections are more frequent. 24, 25 The true incidence of symptomatic exacerbations and antibiotic use throughout the year thus cannot be extrapolated. We cannot exclude that factors particular to our geographic location and particular to the brief study period have influenced our results. No pathogen (gray) was found in 24 (44%) exacerbations. A pathogenic virus was found in 30 (56%) exacerbations. Rhinovirus was found in 18 (33%) exacerbations, including 2 co-infections with adenovirus (Adeno), 2 with respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and 1 with human metapneumovirus (hMPV). B, Bacterial culture was performed on spontaneously expectorated sputum in 43 symptomatic respiratory exacerbations in patients with CVID. No pathogen (gray) was found in 29 (67%) exacerbations. A pathogenic bacterium was found in 14 (33%) exacerbations. Pseudomonas aeruginosa was isolated in 3 (7%) exacerbations; among those was 1 co-infection with Streptococcus pneumoniae. Two patients (accounting for 4 exacerbations) were probably colonized with Haemophilus influenzae. J ALLERGY CLIN IMMUNOL PRACT VOLUME 6, NUMBER 1",

Phocine distemper virus was added as internal control to each sample and a primer pair and probe were designed to amplify K-Ras oncogene. Cloned complementary DNA (cDNA) positive controls for each of the targeted viruses were included; a negative control consisting of the reaction mixture and PCR-grade water was included in each run. Nucleic acid was extracted from 0.5 mL of nasopharyngeal swab using the automated extraction platform NucliSENS(r) easyMAG(r) (Biomerieux, Marcy l'Etoile, France). The Superscript III platinum one-step reverse transcription kit (Invitrogen, Paisley, UK) was used to generate and amplify cDNA. RT-PCR was performed on the TaqMan 7500 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, Calif). Sputum samples were examined by microscopy and culture for bacteria and mycobacteria plus an in-house multiplex RT-PCR for Chlamydia pneumoniae, Legionella pneumophila, and Mycoplasma pneumoniae. Techniques used in our laboratories for sputum processing, microbiological culture, and multiplex PCR detection of bacteria have been described in greater detail elsewhere. E3 We included multiple samples from a single patient if the samples were separated by at least 2 weeks and the patient was asymptomatic between episodes. Airway colonization by pathogenic bacteria was considered possible if the same organism had been isolated more than twice within the 2 years before our study.",
