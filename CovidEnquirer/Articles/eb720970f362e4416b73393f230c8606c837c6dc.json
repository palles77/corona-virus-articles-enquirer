We have presented epidemiologic aspect of this phenomenon as a three-component model -host, information on an attack and social network. We have proposed a mathematical model of panic and counter-measures as the function of time in a population exposed to a bioterrorist attack. The model comprises ordinary differential equations and graphically presented combinations of the equations parameters. Clinically, we have presented a model through a sequence of psychic conditions and disorders initiated by an act of bioterrorism. This model might be helpful for an attacked community to timely and properly apply counter-measures and to minimize human mental suffering during a bioterrorist attack.",

Instead, biological weapons are quintessentially weapons of terror. The purpose of these weapons is to wreak destruction via psychological means by inducing panic in everyday life [1] .",

Between 25% and 50% of survivors, directly exposed to a bioterrorist attack, could be expected to develop PTSD (Post Traumatic Stress Disorder). Moreover, most of those survivors who do not develop a diagnosable psychiatric illness suffer from painful, severe, and often long-term reactions. Fear of biolog-ical attacks may be associated with epidemics of medically unexplained illness (also known as mass sociogenic illness, mass psychogenic illness, or mass hysteria), involving the rapid spread of medically unexplained signs and symptoms, which are misinterpreted by affected persons as signs of serious physical illness. Social problems may emerge after exposure to biological agent (e.g., population displacement; breakdown of community support systems; and social stigma associated with contagion or contamination). Persons with altered behaviors may be so numerous that they overwhelm available medical resources [5] .",

This is our attempt to present a new epidemiological model of panic during and after bioterrorist attack, based on the Lotka-Volterra population model [7] . First, we defined the parameters of a model and their mutual interactions. Using these parameters we formulated mathematical functions of panic and protection against panic. Finally, we formulated model of panic and presented it as a system of ordinary differential equations. The system was solved numerically [8] and graphical presentations of changing panic and protection against panic depending on time are given. Considering the epidemiologic aspect of this model the corresponding elements to classic triangle (agent, environment and host), would be information, environmental and social network and host.",

In public health, like other fields, social networks facilitate dissemination of information. A central goal of health communication and health education is to devise efficient and effective ways to translate and disseminate health information to practitioners, communities and consumers, which could reduce disease risk and promote health. Health information is transmitted through and to health consum-ers. Katz and Lazarsfeld proposed that the impact of media messages is mediated by social relationships. Not only did having a link to the source of information make a difference, but the composition of an individual's personal network and an individual's position within that network also had some relationship to knowledge and behavior. The role social networks play in health and health behavior is to build more effective community-based coalitions [23] . Protecting nation's health is a vital part of preserving national security and the continuity of critical national functions. Public health interventions can both limit distress and alter health risk behaviors (e.g., increased smoking and alcohol consumption). In this way, such information and education can restore communities, families, and workplaces and reduce a post-disaster mental health burden of distress and possible illness. One component of psychological first aid is the establishment of a sense of safety (e.g., through evacuation or protection from retraumatization) [24] .",

Preparedness has to include understanding and monitoring of bioterrorism related perceptions and psychological responses. Experts should anticipate psychological responses, and anticipate avoidance behaviors in the event of a local bioterrorist act. With the likelihood of pandemic, the level of distress in a community cannot be determined by local factors only; panic in other countries may start a chain reaction. International efforts to reduce panic are warranted. It is interesting to see that even before the onset of a newly emerging infectious disease (SARS, human and avian influenza), people may change their behaviors (e.g., avoiding visiting hospitals because of fear of contracting avian influenza infection and eating less poultry meat). Such behavioral changes were associated significantly with anticipated distress and anticipated avoidance behaviors. With the onset of a human avian influenza outbreak in Hong Kong, more than 50% would adopt at least 4 out of the 5 avoidance behaviors studied. There is little doubt that a local economy would be affected, even at the onset stage of a local human influenza epidemic. It is likely that the level of distress would be enhanced in a vicious cycle, as seen in the SARS epidemic. It is very likely that even at the onset of a human avian influenza epidemic-regardless of whether it is a bird-to-human or human-to-human transmission-widespread distress, panic, and avoidance behaviors would occur in Hong Kong as well as in other affected countries.",
