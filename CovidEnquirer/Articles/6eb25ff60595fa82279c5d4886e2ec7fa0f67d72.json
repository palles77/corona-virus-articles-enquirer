To show the important connection between human health and environmental quality, this study surveys the prevalence of sick building syndrome (SBS) among apartment residents and their evaluation of indoor environmental quality (IEQ). Based on a sample of 748 households living in Hong Kong, two interesting findings are revealed: (1) nasal discomfort was the commonest home-related SBS symptom despite the absence of any central ventilation system in apartment buildings; (2) noise, rather than ventilation, was the major IEQ problem perceived by residents. Our statistical analysis further showed that residents with SBS symptoms were less satisfied with their IEQ than those without. That is, despite a positive evaluation of specific IEQ criteria with respect to the building residents lived in, if they reported feeling SBS related symptoms, the overall IEQ evaluation of their building could still be negative. This perception bias gives rise to a sample selection problem in measuring perceived IEQ, which has implications on housing management practices and the formulation of a healthy housing policy.",

One important strand lies in sick building syndrome (SBS), which is widely used to describe symptoms experienced inside a building, such as headaches, eye, nose, or throat irritations, itchy skin, and fatigue (e.g. Burge, Hedge, Wilson, Bass, & Robertson, 1987; Finnegan, Pickering, & Burge, 1984) . These symptoms, while common in the general population, become more prominent the longer a person stays inside a building, but they tend to disappear when he or she goes out. It is the non-specific and untraceable nature of these symptoms from which the name SBS originated. If the exact causes of these symptoms were known to be a specific component of a building (e.g. the volatile organic compounds [VOC] emitted from finishes), they would have been classified as building-related illnesses (e.g. Menzies & Bourbeau, 1997) .",

            "text": "This study, being interdisciplinary by drawing expertise and survey resources from the medical, architectural, building construction and planning fields, aims to explore the prevalence of SBS in apartment buildings and then relate it to the potential bias in occupants' evaluation of IEQ. 1 Apartment buildings are our focus because of the growing concern over their ''healthiness'', especially after the outbreak of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in 2003 in Hong Kong. This communicable disease has clearly given a health warning to people who are used to high-density living. Since the SARS outbreak, we have seen an increasing amount of research not just in the medical field (e.g. Lee et al., 2003; Tsang et al., 2003; Yu et al., 2004) but also on housing conditions and economic impact (e.g. Ho et al., 2004 Ho et al., , 2007 Lai, Chau, Ho, & Lin, 2006a , 2006b Wong, Cheung, Yau, Ho, & Chau, 2006) . However, the healthiness of apartment buildings in Hong Kong remains largely unknown. 2 There is no information on the current status of occupants' health in terms of SBS symptoms. There is also no standardized tool to measure perceived IEQ in residential buildings. 3 A primary contribution of this study is to provide a systematic survey of the types of SBS symptom reported by residents in apartment buildings and the level of satisfaction to the IEQ of their homes. 4 In the footsteps of Engvall, Norrby, Bandel, Hult, and Norb\u00e4 ck (2000) , this study develops a questionnaire that can reliably measure residents' perceptions of SBS and IEQ, and then draws implications for devising a healthy housing policy for apartment buildings. Nowadays, apart from field measurements and expert opinions, occupants' feedback often forms an integral part of an IEQ assessment exercise. 5 With the survey data, we can further look into the measurement problem of perceived IEQ when some respondents are prone to SBS. The idea is that if SBS cannot be attributed to a particular source, it is psychologically possible that occupants with SBS are satisfied with every individual component of IEQ (e.g. air quality, thermal comfort, lighting, and acoustic performance), but still give their buildings a low overall IEQ score. Whether or not this psychological possibility exists in practice is an empirical question. If it does exist, the result of perception-based IEQ assessments could well be biased, leading to a wrong decision for housing improvement, healthy building certification, and legal compliance checks.",

However, Letz (1990) pointed out that acute illnesses could occur in residences. Engvall et al. (2000) further confirmed this by a large-scale questionnaire survey (9808 responses out of 14,235 residences) on SBS of apartment buildings in Sweden, and found that symptoms afflicting the eye, nose, throat, and facial skin were common during the time building users stayed home. Such comprehensive evidence allows us to infer that SBS does not only arise in workplaces, but also at home.",

As the use of perception-based assessment becomes more popular, it is worth asking if perceived IEQ could be biased by the presence of SBS. As we pointed out in the Introduction, it is important to understand this bias because if the presence of SBS leads to a divergence between the perceived levels of overall IEQ and individual IEQ components, then the validity of evaluating IEQ based on occupants' subjective assessments would be compromised.",

Respondents were required to answer ''never'', ''sometimes'' or ''often''. The prevalence of these symptoms from respondents in Hong Kong was then compared to another home-SBS study in Sweden by Engvall et al. (2000) . Respondents were also asked to report other health-related issues like whether they were smokers and had chronic respiratory problems diagnosed by a Western doctor. These questions were derived from part of a standardized local medical questionnaire called SF-12 (Lam, Tse, & Gandek, 2005) . Such health-related information is useful for robustness check in our statistical analysis. Finally, the third part of the questionnaire asked the respondent to evaluate the IEQ of his/her home.

Respondents could answer ''dissatisfied'', ''neutral'' or ''satisfied''. These answers will form the basis to test if the presence of SBS symptoms could lead to perception bias.

Then the questionnaires, written in Chinese, were sent to 6262 residences in YTM. For each flat, an invitation was extended only to the adult household member who spent the longest time inside his/her flat to complete the questionnaire. A total of 881 responses were received, which meant a response rate of 14%. This seemingly low response rate should be viewed in light of the response rates and scale (absolute number of respondents) for studies of similar nature with the cultural specificities of Hong Kong in mind. In the medical study by Wun, Tang, and Chao (2001) using postal questionnaire survey, the response rate was only 9.6% (with a total of 124 responses). The educational or professional background of respondents did not appear to be significant. An e-questionnaire survey for a doctoral thesis that pioneered Hong Kong light pollution research achieved just 4.6% response rate (with a total target population of 11,737 persons) (Chui, 2008) . As revealed by the findings of relevant social surveys (Chan & Yung, 2004; Chui, 2008; Dissanayaka & Kumaraswamy, 1999; Hui, 2006; Lee & Chan, 1998; Leung, Lu, & Ip, 2005; Poon, Yu, & Jaillon, 2004; Shen & Tam, 2002; Tam, Tam, & Zeng, 2002; Tam, Tam, Zeng, & Chan, 2006; Wun et al., 2001) , surveys administered to the general public tended to have a lower response rate than those administered to specific groups. Besides, there was also an inverse relationship between response rates and the scale of the survey. The response rate of our survey, though not impressive, was compensated by the scale of the successful interviewed information (after Chui, 2008 but on a par with Hui, 2006) . To show that we have a general distribution of samples, we provide stratification of respondents according to their sex, age and education as shown in Table 2 .",

While approximately 16% of the subjects living in buildings no older than 30 years submitted replies, this percentage fell to 9.1% for buildings built more than 40 years ago. This was probably due to the higher vacancy rates for the older buildings and higher illiteracy rates among the older heads of household.

Among the 16% of respondents choosing ''often,'' 62% of them thought it was related to their built environment, which was substantially higher than for other symptoms (see Table 5 ). Comparing the reported symptom of nose discomfort to the results in Engvall et al. (2000) , which was carried out in Stockholm, Sweden, reveals that the reported prevalence of nasal symptoms was only 13% of all participants and 46% among them thought it was building-related (see Table 6 ). The reason for a stronger perception of building-related nose discomfort in Hong Kong could be that the densely-populated buildings in YTM reduce the air flow within the district, making occupants in apartment buildings more susceptible to air pollution, particular from the heavy traffic. When we conducted the health survey, the daily average of the hourly air pollution index (API) in Mongkok was the third highest 9 among all monitored (14) areas in Hong Kong.",

Fatigue appears to be the commonest (53% ''sometimes'' and 19% ''often''), though it is not widely perceived to be building-related (only 34% believed so).

A lot of studies have suggested a variety of environmental and personal determinants, on which no consensus has been reached.

Medically, extreme thermal conditions can have an indirect health impact in an affluent Asian context, as in the cases of Japan (Kai, Inoue, Higaki, & Tomokuni, 2008; Wakamori, Katoh, Hirano, Kishimoto, & Ozasa, 2009 ) and Hong Kong which has a notoriously excessive ''air-conditioning culture'' in certain public places (Lin & Deng, 2006) . 10 Also, at a personal level, the period of stay at home could modify one's reporting of symptoms. But its exact effect is not clear, depending on whether a resident is more or less sensitive to the indoor environment after living in the same premises for a long period of time. Further research is needed to address these issues.",

The negative effects of these two symptoms on the perception of overall IEQ were not due to environmental factors because they were controlled in the models. It follows that SBS could bias residents' rating of overall IEQ -residents' experiences with nose or head symptoms affected their perception of overall IEQ in a way that was different from their perception of individual IEQ criteria or objective building characteristics. This might be due to the fact that residents were not able to locate the exact causes of their nose symptoms due to invisible air pollutants. The same applies to the effect of head symptoms, which might be attributed to environmental factors other than those included in the models. Other symptoms, including problems with the eyes, throat, skin, and fatigue, were insignificant in both models. Eye, throat, and skin problems might be more related to the presence of allergenic substances identifiable in the flats or the external areas, whereas fatigue might be related to the physical condition of the respondents themselves (e.g. older people may experience more fatigue than younger people).",

It was reckoned that people could manually adjust the amount of light by switching on artificial light in case there was not enough natural lighting, and closing curtains if the sunlight was too strong. These self-adjustments might make the amount of sunlight insignificant to explain the satisfaction of overall IEQ. For the variables concerning building characteristics, building age was negative and significant in both models. Older buildings tend to have more maintenance and hygiene problems. Buildings over 30 years old are the targeted buildings in the government's Mandatory Building Inspection Scheme (MBIS), which was proposed during a public consultation report published by the former Housing, Planning and Lands Bureau (Housing, Planning and Lands Bureau, 2007) . Therefore, people living in older buildings may rate their living environments lower. Flat size was positive and significant in Model 1, but not Model 2.

The respondents strongly believed that their nose discomfort was building-related despite the absence of any central ventilation system in their apartment buildings. There are two implications. First, the results shed light on the controversy over whether the occurrence of SBS is mostly related to the physical indoor environment or psychosocial factors. Researchers have conducted most of their epidemiological indoor environmental studies in workplaces. The study added insight to the existing literature by arguing that SBS can also occur in residential buildings, which are presumably warm shelters for families and where job pressure should be less severe. Second, the nose symptoms are much commoner in Hong Kong than in Sweden, implying that home SBS could vary from place to place. Such a variation could be due to the fact that homes are generally less self-contained (e.g. rely more on natural lighting and ventilation) than offices so that the SBS exhibited at home depends very much more on the quality of the external environment. Further study is, however, needed to examine how much time people actually spend in the flat with the windows open or without using air-conditioners.",

Residents with nose and head symptoms gave a significantly lower rating of their overall IEQ than those without. This is the case even after the perception of individual IEQ factors (e.g. the quality of noise, light, and air) and building characteristics have been controlled. This finding has a very important implication for those who base the evaluation of internal spaces on perceived IEQ: the overall IEQ rating would be biased downward if the respondents have SBS symptoms. That is, even if respondents were satisfied with specific IEQ criteria, the overall IEQ could still be unsatisfactory to respondents with selfreported SBS symptoms. This could purely be a perception bias that has no bearing on the actual IEQ or SBS symptoms. Ignoring this bias might lead a housing manager to make a wrong decision on improvement measures. There are two approaches to solving this problem. One is to abandon any attempt to make subjective measurements and to base all improvement decisions solely on objective IEQ investigation. This approach, however, can be very costly if objective measurement is to be carried out frequently. It also undermines the importance of customer satisfaction. The other approach is to correct for the bias in subjective IEQ assessment. This is relatively easy: ask the respondents for their SBS symptoms in addition to their IEQ ratings, and use statistical methods, such as the Heckman's (1979) two-stage estimator, to correct for the bias. In this way, occupants' opinions can be effectively incorporated into the building management process (e.g. before carrying out objective IEQ investigation and after completion of improvement work).",

Policymakers can, through an examination of the collected responses, realize what criteria are regarded as important for evaluating overall IEQ satisfaction and enhancing the building designs pertaining to these criteria. From our survey, occupants were more sensitive to air quality and noise problems within their flats and the immediate neighborhood, and hence, perceived nose and head symptoms to be more relevant to their IEQ satisfaction.

The influences of some building characteristics, such as flat areas and window sizes, on the occurrence of SBS symptoms can be considered as well. This will contribute to a better understanding of home SBS and will have important implications for the design and management of residential buildings for sustainable development.
