Many of the models formulate stochasticity and spatial heterogeneity, which are of great interest recently. The spatial heterogeneity ranges from the uneven probabilities of contacts between the individuals in communities [1, 2] , dependence of the strength of the demographical interactions between cities on the distance [3] , to nation-wide or world-wide inhomogeneous geographical structures [4, 5] .",

In such a simulation, accuracy and reproducibility of the input demographical knowledge such as the amount of traffic between cities have great impacts on the reliability of the output pattern of the movement of pathogens and their hosts. But, in studying world-wide epidemics, just a collection of regular airline routes and aircraft capacities does not always present the transportation network which results in the real chain of transmission. Some routes are influential decisively, but the others are not. Examples are found in the spread of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) from Asia to the world in 2003. There were not any cases in Japan in spite of the heavy traffic there from Asian countries. Many patients appeared in Canada earlier than the United States to which airlines connect Asian countries much more densely. Here arises an interesting question. Inversely, is it possible to learn the effectively decisive transportation network by observing how the disease spreads, reinforce the demographical knowledge on the network, and import the acquired knowledge into the mathematical model? This is an inverse problem similar to the network tomography [6, 7] .",

This may happen to make [B] a tall but narrow peak in the landscape of the likelihood, which simulated annealing sometimes fail to discover. In addition to these sub-structures, a few remarkable points are seen in these topologies. The nodes SIN and ROC are stubs where k i = 1. The role of SIN is not so relevant in spreading the disease despite the fact that the number of cases there was more than 100 in the middle of April. The nodes CAN and USA have links to distant geographical regions, and USA is a hub (k i is the largest). They are relevant intermediate spreader nodes. The links around GER are not stable among the three topologies. The number of cases in some European countries is too small to draw a reliable conclusion.",

The network topology discovered from a seemingly noisy dataset on the SARS outbreak reproduces some characteristic patterns of the spread from Hong Kong to Southeast Asia and North America. So far, there has been a great deal of effort in obtaining a complete picture of how an infectious disease did and will spread from the found pieces of an epidemiological jigsaw puzzle.

If some demographical statistics on the traffic between cities or the findings on the past contacts between individual patients are available, the consequent posterior distribution enables more comprehensive Bayesian inference. Another extension is to employ more complicated but realistic epidemiological compartment models. The latent period (infected but not infectious) and hospitalization are relevant for some diseases. The dependence of recovery on time (\u03b2 = constant) is realistic for other diseases. Strictly speaking, the time interval from infection to recovery and from a movement to another obeys appropriate probability density functions. Analytical treatment of the stochastic process with these effects tends to be considerably difficult. The estimation may count on such a numerical method as a Markov-chain Monte-Carlo sampling.",

Understanding the landscape of the likelihood functions is essential in identifying the requisites for a dataset, a network topology, and a mathematical model of disease transmission to make the inverse problem well-posed and stabilize the solution.
