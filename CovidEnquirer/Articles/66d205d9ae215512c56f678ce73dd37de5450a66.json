Chest films are normal in children with psychogenic (habit) cough and in children with sinusitis or gastroesophageal reflux (GER) as the primary cause of cough. A normal chest radiograph indicates the unlikelihood of pneumonia caused by respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), influenza, parainfluenza, adenovirus, Chlamydia species, or bacteria. Although children with cough resulting from CF, Mycoplasma species, tuberculosis, aspiration, a bronchial foreign body, or an anatomic abnormality usually have abnormal chest radiographs, a normal radiograph does not exclude these diagnoses. Hyperinflation of the lungs is commonly seen on chest films of infants with RSV bronchiolitis or Chlamydia pneumonia, and a lobar or round (coin lesion) infiltrate is the radiographic hallmark of bacterial pneumonia.

In adults, it is generally thought that \"postnasal drip\"-that is, nasal or sinus secretions draining into the posterior nasopharynx-causes cough and, in fact, may be one of the most frequent causes of cough. Indeed, sinus CT in older patients , or the phalangeal depth ratio, is normally less than 1 but increases to more than 1 with finger clubbing. The DPD/IPD ratio can be measured with calipers or, more accurately, with finger casts. The hyponychial angle is measured from lateral projections of the finger contour on a magnifying screen and is normally less than 180 degrees but greater than 195 degrees with finger clubbing. Schamroth's sign is useful for bedside assessment. The dorsal surfaces of the terminal phalanges of similar fingers are placed together. With clubbing, the normal diamond-shaped aperture or \"window\" at the bases of the nail beds disappears, and a prominent distal angle forms between the end of the nails.

In adults, the cough of the common cold may respond to a combination antihistaminedecongestant preparation, presumably from the decreased postnasal drip.

Chest pain, abdominal pain, headache, or any combination of these symptoms may occur. Upper lobe pneumonia may produce meningeal signs, and lower lobe involvement may cause abdominal pain and an ileus.",

However, many toddlers and children continue to have reflux, although it may be \"silent\" or nonregurgitant (without spitting up). In most people with GER, it is merely a nuisance or not noticed. In some there are sequelae, and this condition is designated gastroesophageal reflux disease (GERD). One manifestation is cough; the mechanisms for the cough are not fully understood. Aspiration of refluxed material is one mechanism for cough but is probably not very common in neurologically intact children. A major mechanism for GERD with cough is mediated by vagal esophagobronchial reflexes (bronchoconstriction), stimulated by acid in the esophagus. Whether acid in the esophagus is sufficient stimulus to cause bronchoconstriction by itself or whether it merely heightens bronchial reactivity to other stimuli is not yet clear (see Chapter 3).

If the results of the therapeutic trial are negative or equivocal, it may make sense to establish a causal relationship between the GER and the cough, by using the modified Bernstein test. During this test, hydrochloric acid and saline are alternately infused into the esophagus through a nasoesophageal tube while the child is observed for cough or wheeze or while the older child undergoes serial pulmonary function tests.

The currently recognized mutations account for approximately 90% of cases. The mutation affects the gene's protein product, termed cystic fibrosis transmembrane regulator, which acts as a chloride channel and affects other aspects of membrane transport of ions and water. Not all the consequences of the defective gene and protein have been determined. Most explain the long-observed clinical manifestations of the disease, including thick, viscid mucus in the tracheobronchial tree, leading to purulent bronchiolitis and bronchitis with subsequent bronchiectasis, pulmonary fibrosis, and respiratory failure; pancreatic duct obstruction, leading to pancreatic insufficiency with steatorrhea and failure to thrive; and abnormally high sweat chloride and sodium concentrations. The airway disease in CF is characterized by infection, inflammation, and endobronchial obstruction. The infection begins with S. aureus, H. influenzae, Escherichia coli, Klebsiella species, or combinations of these organisms but eventually is dominated by nonmucoid or mucoid Pseudomonas aeruginosa. Other organisms, such as Burkholderia cepacia, Xanthomonas maltophilia, Alcaligenes xylosoxidans, Aspergillus fumigatus, or nontuberculous mycobacteria may also appear; their significance remains undetermined. In some patients, B. cepacia has been associated with rapid deterioration and death, and in others, Aspergillus species has caused allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis.

            "text": "There is no such thing as a child who looks \"too good\" to have CF; common abnormalities found on physical examination are noted in Table 2 -16. One of the most important physical findings is digital clubbing. In most patients with CF, clubbing develops within the first few years of life. Although the list of conditions associated with digital clubbing (Table 2-17) is long, they are less common than CF, or the incidence of digital clubbing with these conditions is low. There is some relationship between the degree of pulmonary disease severity and the degree of digital clubbing. A child who has had years of severe respiratory symptoms without digital clubbing is not likely to have CF. The diagnosis is confirmed by a positive sweat test or confirming the presence of two CF mutations on chromosome 7. The sweat test, if not performed correctly in a laboratory with extensive experience with the technique (as, for example, in an accredited CF center), yields many false-positive and false-negative results. The proper technique is to use the Gibson-Cooke method, with quantitative analysis of the concentration of sodium, chloride, or both, in the sweat produced after pilocarpine iontophoretic stimulation. Chloride (and sodium) concentrations higher than 60 mEq/L are considered positive indications, and those lower than 40 mEq/L are negative (normal). Healthy adults have slightly higher sweat chloride concentrations than do children, but the same guidelines hold for positive tests in adults. The non-CF conditions yielding elevated sweat chloride concentrations are listed in Table 2 -18. False-negative results of sweat tests can be seen in CF children presenting with edema or hypoproteinemia and in samples from children with an inadequate sweat rate. Sweat testing can be performed at any age; newborns within the first few weeks of life may not produce a large enough volume of sweat to analyze (75 mg minimum), but in those who do (the majority), the results are accurate. Indications for sweat testing are noted in Table 2-19. In patients for whom sweat testing is difficult (e.g., because of distance from an experienced laboratory, small infants who have not produced enough sweat, patients with extreme dermatitis, or patients with intermediate-range sweat chloride concentrations), DNA testing can be useful. Demonstration of two known CF mutations confirms the diagnosis. Finding one or no known mutation makes the diagnosis less likely but is not exclusive, inasmuch as there are patients with not-yet-characterized mutations. Furthermore, commercial laboratories do not identify all of the 1000-plus mutations.",

Similarly, pansinusitis is nearly universal among CF patients but is quite uncommon in other children. Some states are using a neonatal screen for CF. The CF screen is for immunoreactive trypsinogen (IRT) levels, which are elevated in most infants with CF for the first several weeks of life. (Some states do genetic testing on DNA.) Because of the very high sensitivity of this test (almost no one with CF has normal IRT levels) and because early institution of treatment is beneficial, this test may come into wider use. Its main drawback is that it has relatively poor specificity; as many as 90% of the positive results on the initial screen are false-positive results. If an infant's IRT screen is positive, the test should be repeated; at 2 to 3 weeks of age, which is when the test is repeated, the false-positive rate has fallen dramatically but is still quite high (25%). Definitive testing needs to be carried out on infants with two elevated IRT levels. In the unusual older child whose appendix is removed and examined carefully by a knowledgeable pathologist, the diagnosis may be suggested by the typical histologic appearance of the appendix (the mucus-secreting glands are overdistended with eosinophilic material). Laboratory data that may support the diagnosis of CF include absence of stool trypsin or chymotrypsin. This suggests pancreatic insufficiency, which occurs most commonly in CF but can be seen in other diseases. The test is not perfect even for confirming pancreatic insufficiency, because intestinal flora may produce or destroy trypsin. Pulmonary function test findings with an obstructive pattern, incompletely responsive to bronchodilators, are consistent with CF but, of course, can be seen in other conditions. Conversely, some patients with CF also have asthma and may show a marked response to a bronchodilator. Complications of CF that should suggest the diagnosis are noted in Table 2 -20.",

This occurs because 40% of the mucus viscosity in CF is attributed to DNA released from dying polymorphonuclear cells. Another drug that appears promising is amiloride.

The expiratory component is louder and longer than the inspiratory component; a definite pause is heard between the two phases. Bronchovesicular breath sounds are a mixture of bronchial and vesicular sounds. The inspiratory (I) and expiratory (E) components are equal in length. They are usually heard only in the first and second interspaces anteriorly and between the scapulae posteriorly, near the carina and mainstem bronchi. Vesicular breath sounds are soft and lowpitched; they are heard over most of the lung fields. The inspiratory component is much longer than the expiratory component; the latter is softer and often inaudible. (From Swartz MH: The chest.
