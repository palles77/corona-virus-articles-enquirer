Importantly, combining two monoclonal antibodies that target different epitopes effected almost complete suppression of wild type virus replication.

Coronaviruses are enveloped, positive-strand RNA viruses that encode the structural Spike (S), Envelope (E), Membrane (M) and Nucleocapsid (N) proteins, as well as non-structural proteins [1] . The 1255 amino acid (aa) viral S protein mediates both cell attachment and membrane fusion. The S1 and S2 domains of the SARS-CoV are defined, although the S protein of SARS-CoV does not appear to be cleaved [2, 3] . The viral receptor binding domain (RBD) of the S protein, located between residue 318 and 510 of the S1 domain [4] , interacts with angiotensin-converting enzyme 2 (ACE2), which has been identified as the SARS-CoV receptor [5] .",

Convalescent serum has been reported to contain high titers of IgG antibody against SARS-CoV [6] , suggesting that anti-SARS-CoV antibodies could be useful for passive immunization against SARS. Among the different protein candidates recognized by the anti-SARS-CoV antibodies, the S protein has emerged as a major target for vaccine development [7] . In particular, the RBD of S1 contains important epitopes for neutralizing antibodies, although a neutralizing mAb that recognizes the S1 N-terminal region (aa 130e150) was also reported [8] . These findings suggest that SARS-CoV infection could be inhibited by interfering with the interaction between S1 and ACE2, and specifically the binding of ACE2 with the RBD of S1.",

To further characterize these mAbs, murine A20.2Jderived S6.2 cells expressing S protein [17] were stained with biotinylated anti-S mAbs and analyzed using FACScalibur. SKOT19 stained the surface of S6.2 cells only marginally, whereas the staining signals obtained with SKOT3 and SKOT20 were stronger (Fig. 2B , upper panel). Importantly, these signals were substantially enhanced by combining SKOT3 and SKOT19 or SKOT19 and SKOT20 (Fig. 2B , lower panel). Of note, we previously showed that S expression in S6.2 cells was detectable at high levels using a mixture of all anti-S mAbs [17] . To further define the epitopes targeted by the mAbs, we next performed competition experiments. As shown in Fig. 2C , binding of SKOT-3 to virion was not inhibited either by SKOT19 or SKOT20, whereas binding of SKOT19 and SKOT20 was partially inhibited by each other and also by SKOT3. Together this indicated that the mAbs recognize two distinct epitopes of S protein, one epitope recognized by SKOT3 and the other by SKOT19 and SKOT20. Taken together, these anti-S mAbs likely recognize distinct conformational epitopes of S protein.",

A greater level of resistance to mAb was shown by clones with two aa substitutions (v3-1 and v3-3) compared to the clone with only a single aa modification (clone v3-4).

Although other v19 subclones were weakly resistant to much lower concentrations of SKOT19 (approximately 0.04e0.2 mg/ml), we did not detect any mutation in the S region in these clones. The neutralizing curve shown in Fig. 1 indicates that the concentration of SKOT-19 used (0.5 mg/ml) was not sufficient for the selection of escape mutants, other than v19-5 with Y442F mutation. Alternatively, it is possible SKOT19 is a low affinity antibody and requires many molecules for exerting a clear neutralizing effect in this assay. Three SKOT20-resistant clones (v20-3, v20-3 and v20-4) contained the same Y442F substitution. Thus, the Y442F substitution, which occurs in the RBD of the S1 region, appears to be important for viral escape from the neutralizing effect of both SKOT19 and SKOT20. The additional aa alteration that was identified in v20-4 (A834V) appeared to give an advantage for this clone to escape from the most powerful neutralizing effect of SKOT20 (approximately 0.2e1.0 mg/ml).

The resistance of v20-2 and v19-5 to SKOT19 (middle) was similar to that of v20-4 and only the growth of v20-3 was affected at a minimum concentration of SKOT19.

In this study, we further characterized three mAbs (SKOT3, SKOT19 and SKOT20) that possessed strong neutralization activity but different affinities towards the S protein. Immunofluorescence assays indicated that these mAbs reacted similarly to the cytoplasmic and ER/Golgi membranes of SARS-CoV-infected Vero E6 cells, but did not recognize purified virion that was blotted onto a membrane [16] . Flow cytometry analysis suggested that three mAbs recognize distinct conformational epitopes of S protein. Furthermore, the competition assay using these mAbs indicated that the epitope recognized by SKOT3 and that by SKOT19 and SKOT20 do not overlap. We generated neutralization escape viral mutants against these mAbs, and detected substitutions at positions 442 and 601 in the S1 domain, as well as 757 and 834 in the S2 domain, indicating that the major antigenic determinants of SKOT3 include aa 757 in the S2 domain, whereas those of SKOT19 and SKOT20 include aa 442 in the S1 RBD. We speculate that SKOT19 and SKOT20 may block virus entry by interfering with the interaction between the RBD and ACE2 receptor. Although SKOT3 binds outside of the RBD and with low affinity, it can also inhibit virus entry, presumably by interfering with the conformational change in the S2 region that is induced by binding.",

For example, Yi et al. identified a positively charged region (aa 422e463) within the S protein that is critical for the induction of neutralizing antibodies in the DNA immunization of mice [22] . They found that pseudoviruses containing the R441A substitution failed to induce neutralizing mAbs, indicating that the Y442F substitution we identified here reflects the virological importance of this region. Interestingly, Tyr442 is well conserved in SARS-CoV isolated from humans and related viruses in civets and palm civet cats, but not those in bats (Ser442).

Thus, passive immunization with neutralizing antibody could be an effective SARS therapy. Human mAbs have been developed using a variety of techniques, and similar to the findings with murine mAbs, many of the epitopes were located in the RBD (review in [7] ). In this context, Coughlin et al. immunized the XenoMouse, in which mouse immunoglobulin genes are replaced with human genes, with baculovirus-derived S protein to produce various human mAbs with neutralizing activity [25] . Twenty-seven reacted to a variety of epitopes within the S1 domain, whereas an additional 57 mAbs did not. Three mAbs that reacted with the HR2 domain did not exhibit neutralizing activity. Importantly, recently developed human neutralizing mAbs are potently cross-reactive to many clinical isolates, including zoonotic viruses [26, 27] .",
