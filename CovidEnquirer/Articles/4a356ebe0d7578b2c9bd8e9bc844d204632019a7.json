            "text": "Syndromic surveillance is increasingly used to signal unusual illness events. To validate data-source selection, we retrospectively investigated the extent to which 6 respiratory syndromes (based on different medical registries) refl ected respiratory pathogen activity. These syndromes showed higher levels in winter, which corresponded with higher laboratory counts of Streptococcus pneumoniae, respiratory syncytial virus, and infl uenza virus. Multiple linear regression models indicated that most syndrome variations (up to 86%) can be explained by counts of respiratory pathogens. Absenteeism and pharmacy syndromes might refl ect nonrespiratory conditions as well. We also observed systematic syndrome elevations in the fall, which were unexplained by pathogen counts but likely refl ected rhinovirus activity. Earliest syndrome elevations were observed in absenteeism data, followed by hospital data (+1 week), pharmacy/general practitioner consultations (+2 weeks), and deaths/laboratory submissions (test requests) (+3 weeks). We conclude that these syndromes can be used for respiratory syndromic surveillance, since they refl ect patterns in respiratory pathogen activity. E arly warning surveillance for emerging infectious disease has become a priority in public health policy since the anthrax attacks in 2001, the epidemic of severe acute respiratory syndrome in 2003, and the renewed attention on possible infl uenza pandemics. As a result, new surveillance systems for earlier detection of emerging infectious diseases have been implemented. These systems, often labeled \"syndromic surveillance,\" benefi t from the increasing timeliness, scope, and diversity of health-related registries (1) (2) (3) (4) (5) (6) . Such alternative surveillance uses symptoms or clinical diagnoses such as \"shortness of breath\" or \"pneumonia\" as early indicators for infectious disease. This approach not only allows clinical syndromes to be monitored before laboratory diagnoses, but also allows disease to be detected for which no additional diagnostics were requested or available (including activity of emerging pathogens). Our study assessed the suitability of different types of healthcare data for syndromic surveillance of respiratory disease.",

The hospital, GP, pharmacy, and laboratory submissions data strongly correlated with RSV and infl uenza A counts (Table 2) . Mortality data correlated strongly with infl uenza A (r = 0.65) and infl uenza B (r = 0.50) infections.

Table 4 presents, for each registry, the time lag (in weeks) that maximized the model fi t of regressing syndrome on pathogens. For the GP, hospital, mortality, and pharmacy data, the respiratory pathogens explained the syndrome variation very well (78%-86%). Variations in the absenteeism syndrome could be explained for 68% by variations in the pathogen counts. Although the laboratory submissions syndrome had the lowest explained variance, still 61% of the variations in this syndrome were explained by variations in pathogen counts.

Models with seasonal terms alone mostly had lower explained variance than the pathogen models. For the GP and hospital data, some pathogens became insignifi cant after seasonal terms were added (Table 6 ) but not those pathogens with the largest effect estimates (RSV, infl uenza A and B). Therefore, we are confi dent in concluding that the GP, hospital, laboratory submission, and mortality syndromes do refl ect pathogen activity suffi ciently for use in syndromic surveillance. The higher R 2 value of the absenteeism model with seasonal terms alone suggests seasonality of absenteeism caused by several nonrespiratory conditions (28, 29) . To some extent, this also applies to the pharmacy syndrome, which includes medications that are not specifi c for respiratory infections (e.g., antimicrobial drugs). This could be validated in future studies by linking medications to illness. However, for both the absenteeism and pharmacy syndromes, the variation explained by seasonal terms is probably overestimated to some extent because data for only 2 and 3 years were used. Consequently, these time series contained less information on variation between different years than for the other registries, which benefi ts fi tting of a model with several sine and cosine terms.",

The modest explained variance for the laboratory submissions syndrome could possibly refl ect the limited use in our country of laboratory testing algorithms, which leads to substantial differences in diagnostic regimes for patients with similar clinical symptoms. In addition, occasional extra alertness by clinicians can make these data unreliable for surveillance. For instance, an unusual peak was observed in the laboratory submissions syndrome in 1999, after the offi cial announcement of an outbreak of Legionnaires' disease (30) .",

These peaks preceded the syndrome peaks concurring with peaks in infl uenza A, infl uenza B, and RSV counts and may be caused by rhinovirus activity-and asthma exacerbations caused by rhinovirus-which usually rises in the fall (31) (32) (33) . Rhinovirus might go undetected because GP physicians rarely ask for diagnostics if they suspect a nonbacterial cause for relatively mild respiratory disease. Although (Table 1) . Measured by the syndrome lag with the maximized R 2 , the timeliness differed between the registries in the following order: absenteeism, hospital, pharmacy/general practice (GP), mortality/ laboratory submissions (as projected on the x-axis). specifi c asthma diagnoses were excluded from the respiratory syndrome defi nitions, exacerbations of asthma might affect other respiratory categories in the GP or pharmacy syndrome. This observation illustrates that additional diagnostics are needed for identifying the causes of unexplained respiratory disease elevations. Several novel respiratory pathogens for which diagnostics are not yet widely available have been discovered in recent years, underlining that it is quite possible that \"hidden\" epidemics occur (34) (35) (36) . The extra October peak and several other syndrome elevations above the 95% UCLs in our study may well refl ect such hidden epidemics. The fact that these occur is supported by studies showing that many individual syndrome cases cannot be linked to known pathogens. For example, Cooper et al. (37) , who investigated syndromic signals by using patient self-sampling (at home), could only obtain diagnostic results for 22% of these cases.",

Unexpectedly, the hospital data refl ect respiratory pathogen activity earlier than the GP data. Although in the Netherlands patients are encouraged to consult their GP before going to the hospital, elderly persons, for whom respiratory infections are more likely to cause severe illness, may often go to a hospital directly. Therefore, hospital data may prove to be an earlier marker for respiratory disease than GP data, but this possibility needs further exploration.",

To illustrate this we defi ned every exceeding of the UCLs of the regression models as a \"signal,\" i.e., a syndrome elevation unexplained by known pathogen activity and therefore possibly refl ecting activity of underdiagnosed or emerging infectious disease. Over 2002-2003 (the period that all 6 registries were in the study), only 5 \"concurrent\" signals occurred versus 34 \"single\" signals over all registries. We did not evaluate whether the syndromes indeed detect outbreaks of infectious diseases earlier than clinical or laboratory pathogen surveillance. Such an evaluation is often performed by testing the ability to detect historical natural outbreaks or simulated outbreaks (10, 38) . However, historical natural outbreaks are rare and simulated outbreaks may be unrealistic. Nevertheless, further research into the outbreak detection performance of these syndromes would be worthwhile.",
