However, the effectiveness of this protocol in preventing self-contamination has not been validated. To determine if removing PPE according to the CDC protocol prevents viral contamination of the wearer, a human challenge study was undertaken using a nonpathogenic virus.",

Sites of contamination were as follows: front shoulder of gown, back shoulder of gown, right side of N95 respirator, upper right front of goggles, and palm of dominant hand. Each site was contaminated with a total of 10 4 PFU of MS2 in 5 drops of 5 \u03bcL each. Participants performed a healthcare task (measuring blood pressure on a mannequin) and then removed PPE according to CDC protocol. Hands, items of PPE, and scrubs worn underneath were sampled for virus. Hands were sampled by using the glove juice method (7) . Each hand was placed inside a bag containing 75 mL stripping solution (0.4 g KH 2 PO 4 , 10.1 g Na 2 HPO 4 , 1.0 mL Triton-X/L) and massaged for 60 seconds to cover all hand surfaces with solution. PPE items were immersed in 1.5% beef extract, pH 7.5, and agitated on a shaker for 20 minutes. Eluent from hands and PPE was assayed by the most probable number (MPN) enrichment infectivity assay (8) . To prevent cross-contamination, samples from only 1 volunteer were processed at a time, and individual eluent samples were processed separately in a biological safety cabinet, with decontamination in between.",

While removal of gloves and gowns required 2 hands, mask and goggle removal was one-handed, which could have resulted in larger quantities of virus being transferred to the dominant hand during removal. In the single left-handed study participant, recovery of virus was greater from the left hand than the right (1.82 log 10 vs. 0.98 log 10 MPN). The mean amount of virus recovered from scrub shirts was signifi cantly greater than that recovered from pants (p = 0.01), possibly because of contact with hands when the gown is pulled away from the shoulder during removal.",

When the HCW is fi nished, goggles and respirator are removed fi rst, and gown and gloves are then removed together by peeling off both at the same time, again avoiding handling PPE with ungloved hands.

Even if double gloving is incorporated into protocols for PPE use, it is not a substitute for proper hand hygiene.
