The POLI-IF (Newcastle virus plus endotoxin of E. cold and Freund's incomplete adjuvant) rapidly induces the aspecific immunity. Given twice with 7-10 days interval in between, on occasion of a programmed stress (weaning, transport, crowding) it proved its efficacy in artificially suckled calves and in weaning piglets. The field trials, carried out on 2,782 treated calves in comparison with 2,909 untreated controls and on 4,387 piglets in comparison with 4,461 untreated controls, revealed statistically significant differences for P < 0.005 among the groups of treated and control animals. The immunostimulator reduced the incidence of the disease, dead and discarded animals, as well as it shortened the mean duration of the disease in single heads. Though the way the POLI-IF acts is not perfectly known so far, yet it increases the serum bactericidal activity and the circulating leukocytes, while it induces high levels of IFN. In our opinion the acti~,ity of the POLl-IF is bound to 3 factors at least: activation of the complementary fractions, mobilization of the immunocompetent cells, induction of IFN.",

In Figs 1 and 2 the mean values and the mean square deviation seen in calves and piglets are reported. With the horizontal lines the field is shown where the normal values of controls are framed. Following the injection the increase ofleukocytes reaches the peak within 12 h in piglets and in 48 h in calves. In such points the circulating leukocytes number is redoubled. Within 48 h following the peak the values get back to normal again. At the 2nd injection the increase of circulating leukocytes is rapid and the peak, in both animal species, is reached 24 h later. The values of the 2nd peak are higher than those of the previous one and even the duration of the phenomenon is longer. Within 72 h the circulating leukocytes in piglets get back to normal while in calves they are still double in number after 4 days from injection.",
