Aminoglycoside-mediated ISG induction resulted in 56 significant protection against genital HSV-2 infection and significantly reduced Zika virus 57 replication. Aminoglycoside-mediated antiviral protection was independent of the host 58 microbiota, as intravaginal aminoglycoside treatment protected germ-free mice form HSV-59 2 infection. This protection mechanism operates in the vaginal mucosa and nasal mucosa, 60 as intranasal aminoglycoside treatment increased ISG expression in the lung and 61 aminoglycoside pre-treated hosts had increased survival after highly virulent influenza A 62 virus infection. ISG expression was dependent on TLR3 and downstream signaling 63 pathway, and robust recruitment of TLR3-expressing XCR1+ dendritic cells to the vaginal 64 mucosa.

We 120 identified over a hundred significantly upregulated genes ( Fig. 2a ; Supplementary Table  121 1). No genes were significantly downregulated in expression. Using Ingenuity pathway 122 analysis, we found that genes in the type I interferon (IFN) pathway were heavily enriched 123 ( Fig. 2b) , with over 30% of the upregulated genes falling within this pathway. We 124 independently confirmed the upregulation of a subset of IFN-stimulated-genes (ISGs) 125 using RT-qPCR (Fig. 2c) . ISG expression was also increased in germ-free mice upon 126 neomycin treatment ( Supplementary Fig. 2 ). Neomycin-induced ISG expression was rapid, 127 as a single treatment was sufficient to significantly increase ISG expression 2-5 fold 128 though not to the levels observed after a week's treatment (8-10 fold) ( Supplementary Fig.  129 3a). Neomycin-mediated ISG induction was also dose-dependent as increased amounts of 130 neomycin correspondingly increased ISG expression ( Supplementary Fig. 3a ). Significant 131 ISG induction was maintained up to 3 days after neomycin treatment and was only partially 132 lost by 1 week post neomycin treatment with 5 of 8 genes still significantly upregulated 133 ( Supplementary Fig. 3c ). Finally, this neomycin-mediated ISG induction was restricted to 134 the site of application, as we observed no upregulation of ISG expression in the lungs of 135 neomycin-treated mice ( Supplementary Fig. 3d ). 136 137",

The 391 interaction of aminoglycosides with mitochondrial ribosomal RNA, which is closely related 392 to bacterial ribosomal RNA, is well characterized and aminoglycosides have also been 393 found to bind mitochondrial ribosomal RNA at multiple sites 38,55 . It is possible that 394 mitochondrial rRNA-bound aminoglycosides might activate TLR3 in XCR1+ DCs in the 395 endosome. Our results show that aminoglycoside and Poly I:C can synergize to induce 396 increased ISG expression (Supplementary Fig. 13 ). Future studies are needed to identify 397 the manner in which aminoglycoside-bound RNA stimulate TLR3. 398",

Since the vaginal mucosa is composed of 259 stratified squamous epithelial cells, small numbers of resident leukocytes and circulating 260 leukocytes, we investigated whether ISG induction by neomycin requires tissue resident 261 cells or circulating leukocytes. To determine if circulating leukocytes were responsible for 262 increased ISG expression, we blocked cellular recruitment by treating mice intravaginally 263 with pertussis toxin. Pertussis toxin (PTX) blocks Gi-protein coupled receptor signaling, 264 thereby preventing most chemokine-mediated cellular recruitment to the vaginal mucosa 265 when applied intravaginally 25 . Treatment with PTX ablated the protective effect of 266 neomycin as mice treated with both pertussis toxin and neomycin prior to infection had 267 significantly reduced vaginal ISG expression compared to PTX-untreated mice(Fig. 5a). 268This absence of ISG expression resulted in significantly higher levels of mucosal viral titers 269 and an increase in disease pathology upon HSV-2 infection(Fig. 5b,c). These results 270 suggested that cellular recruitment to the vaginal tissue is prerequisite to the enhanced 271 ISG induction and protection against HSV-2 conferred by topical neomycin treatment. 272 neomycin treatment(Fig. 5d,e). However, PTX treatment of neomycin-277 inoculated mice resulted in significant blockade of CD11c+ and CD11b+CD11c+ cells(Fig. 2785e), suggesting that one or both of these cell types might be responsible for the neomycin-279induced ISGs in the vaginal mucosa. 280To test this hypothesis, we isolated CD11c+ cells from the vaginal tissue of neomycin-281 treated and control mice and found significant increases in transcripts of ISGs 282 (Supplementary Fig. 8). Likewise, these recruited CD11c+ cells were also found to express 283 IFNb (Supplementary Fig. 9a). To determine whether DCs are required for the increase in 284 ISG expression following neomycin application, we treated CD11c-DTR mice with 285 diphtheria toxin to deplete DCs and then administered neomycin intravaginally. In the 286 absence of DCs, neomycin treatment failed to increase vaginal ISG expression(Fig. 5f).287 Collectively, our results suggest that recruited DCs are necessary for aminoglycoside-288 mediated ISG expression. 289 290 XCR1+DCs are recruited to the vaginal mucosa upon neomycin treatment and are 291 required for ISG induction 292",

A single antibiotic, neomycin, was responsible for the protection and this 345 protection extended to multiple members of the aminoglycoside family. Surprisingly, 346 aminoglycoside-mediated antiviral protection occurred in germ free mice, indicating a 347 microbiome-independent mechanism of resistance. Mucosal aminoglycoside treatment 348 recruited XCR1+ dendritic cells, and induced ISGs expression via TLR3, TRIF and 349 of bioactive compounds for antiviral activity have identified antibiotic 353 compounds including azithromycin and nanchangmycin 41,42 . Azithromycin, a macrolide 354 antibiotic, potently inhibits Zika virus replication in cell culture via an as yet unknown 355 mechanism 42 . Nanchangmycin was also originally identified in a screen for antiviral 356 compounds effective against ZIKV. Pretreatment of cells with this antibiotic blocks entry of 357 many flaviviruses including dengue virus and chikungunya virus by inhibiting clathrin-358 mediated endocytosis 41 . Chloroquine, a member of the quinolone family of antimalarials 359 has also demonstrated broad antiviral activity 43-45 and is thought to reduce viral replication 360 by interfering with endosome acidification 46 . These studies collectively highlight the 361 unexpected antiviral functions of antibiotics, albeit through distinct downstream pathways. 362 Our study identifies a class of antibiotics, aminoglycosides, which mediate their antiviral 363 activity by increasing host expression of a broad range of ISGs, potentially reducing the 364 opportunity for viruses to develop resistance. Of note, a previous study demonstrated the 365 ability of anthracyclines (chemotherapy agents that are natural products of Streptomyces 366 bacteria) to also induce ISG expression in cancer cells in a TLR3-dependent manner 47 . 367 Thus, bacterial products with nucleic acid binding capacity may have the ability to trigger 368 TLR3 and possibly other PRRs. 369 How do aminoglycosides induce ISGs? Our results indicate that aminoglycoside treatment 370 in the vaginal mucosa results in the increased expression of chemokines and is 371 accompanied by recruitment of monocyte-derived DCs and cDCs. Blocking this 372 recruitment through PTX treatment, or depletion of DCs, aborted the ISG response. With 373 TLR3 as the key sensor required for ISGs and as only cDC1 expresses TLR3 (Ref. 29 )ion channels 49 which are also expressed on DCs 50 . Aminoglycosides are known 378 for inducing cytotoxicity in specific cell types such as the hair cells of the inner ear and 379 kidney epithelial cells 32,33,36 but their effect on immune cells has not been well 380 characterized. Aminoglycosides may also be taken up by the vaginal epithelial cells via the 381 megalin receptor which has been shown to bind these compounds 51,52 . While we 382 observed no inflammation or cytotoxicity in aminoglycoside-treated vaginal tissues 383 (SupplementaryFig. 11), we cannot rule out phagocytosis of nearby dead or dying cells by 384",
