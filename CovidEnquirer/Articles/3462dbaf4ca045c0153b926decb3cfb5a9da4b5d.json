In this study, we aimed to investigate serum neopterin levels in patients with CrimeaneCongo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) and its clinical significance as a predictor factor of mortality. Methods: Neopterin concentrations on the first day of hospitalization were measured in serum samples from 51 CCHF patients. Serum neopterin levels and other clinicalelaboratory parameters for fatal and nonfatal CCHF patients were compared. Results: Serum neopterin levels (73.22 AE 54.30 nmol/L) were highly elevated in all CCHF patients (p < 0.0001) with higher levels in fatal group (153.66 AE 81.34 nmol/L, p Z 0.0001) compared to nonfatal disease (55.99 AE 24.09 nmol/L). In univariate analysis, the level of neopterin on the first day of hospitalization, bleeding, platelet count, aspartate transferase and lactate dehydrogenase were associated with mortality. In multivariate analysis, only the serum level of neopterin was associated with mortality. As a mortality risk factor, area under the curve was 0.939 (p Z 0.0001, 95% confidence interval: 0.85e1.00). Conclusions: In this first study of serum neopterin levels for CCHF, elevated serum neopterin level showing strong activation of monocytes/macrophages was a risk factor for CCHF.",

            "text": "CrimeaneCongo hemorrhagic fever (CCHF) is an acute tickborne viral illness with the potential of human-to-human transmission affecting multiple organ systems and characterized by ecchymosis, visceral bleeding and hepatic dysfunction. 1, 2 The virus belongs to the genus Nairovirus in the Bunyaviridea family. 3, 4 The reported fatality rate ranges 5e50%. 2, 3 Increased white blood cell count (WBC), decreased platelet count, elevated alanine transferase (ALT), aspartate transferase (AST), lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) and creatine kinase (CK) levels, prolonged activated partial thromboplastin time (aPTT) and prothrombin time (PT), decreased fibrinogen, echhymosis, melena, hematemesis, somnolence, and absence or low detection of specific IgM and IgG antibodies against CCHF have been described as risk factors for fatal CCHF in different studies. 2, 5, 6 The pathogenesis of CCHF is not well described. Their ability to disable the host immune response by attacking and manipulating the cells that initiate the antiviral response is a common pathogenic feature of hemorrhagic fever viruses. 7 The vascular endothelium is both direct and indirect target of all viral hemorrhagic viruses. Mononuclear phagocytes are also target cells for viral hemorrhagic viruses. They are activated upon infection and release certain cytokines and chemokines. These mediators indirectly target the endothelium. 8, 9 Serum levels of the proinflammatory cytokines IL-6 and TNF-a were higher in fatal CCHF patients. 10, 11 Neopterin derivatives are produced by human monocytederived macrophages and dendritic cells upon stimulation by interferons. Plasma or urine neopterin concentrations reflect the activation of the macrophage/monocyte line cells. 12 Neopterin has become one of the useful tools to assess the intensity of the cell-mediated immune response. It appears to be an indicator of severity, progression, and outcome of infectious and inflammatory diseases. 13 In this study, we aimed to investigate serum neopterin levels in patients with CCHF and its clinical significance as a predictor factor of mortality.",

Suspected patients for CCHF were defined as the cases with clinical symptoms and signs of CCHF such as fever, myalgia, malaise, and bleeding, and also the history of tick bite or inhabit (or travel to) endemic region. Diagnosis of all patients in the study group was confirmed with elevated IgM antibodies and/or viral RNA by RT-PCR. Blood samples of suspected cases were collected on admission to hospital for IgM antibodies and RT-PCR test of CCHF virus. The IgM antibodies were detected by using ELISA at Refik Saydam Hygiene Center of Ankara, Turkey. TaqMan-based one-step RT-PCR assay was used for detection of CCHF virus RNA. 14 The assay was performed in a PerkineElmer 7700 Sequence Detection System by using the combination of reverse-transcriptase (MBI Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania) and hot start Taq DNA polymerase (Birion GmBH, Munchen, Germany) enzymes. All of the manipulations were performed in a biosafety class II cabinet.",

            "text": "Although serum neopterin has been investigated in some studies with hemorrhagic fevers including Dengue fever 17, 18 and Ebola hemorrhagic fever, 19 it has not been studied in CCHF disease previously. Recently, Chan et al. studied neopterin concentrations in 110 patients with acute Dengue Fever (DF). 17 They found higher neopterin concentrations in acute DF sera compared with those in measles and influenza and in healthy controls. Baize et al. studied inflammatory mediators in patients with Ebola hemorrhagic fever during two recent outbreaks in Gabon. 19 They also found higher levels of serum neopterin concentrations compared to controls. In the current study, we found increased serum neopterin levels in CCHF patients after admission to hospital. Since the mean time for hospital admission was approximately same for both fatal (6 AE 5.8 days) and nonfatal (5.8 AE 3.0 days) groups in the current study, measurements 'on the first day of admission of patients to the hospital' were practical and appropriate to compare both groups. The mean serum neopterin concentration in CCHF patients exceeded that of the controls by approximately 15-fold. According to our knowledge, this is the first study in the literature to evaluate neopterin levels in CCHF patients. The very high serum neopterin levels may suggest that monocytes/macrophages are strongly activated during CCHF infection. Neopterin is mainly secreted by activated monocytes/macrophages in response to IFNg. 20 Serum neopterin levels have been studied in other viral diseases including severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 21 cytomegalovirus (CMV), 22 rubella, 23 measles and influenza infection. 17 Our finding of increased serum level of neopterin in CCHF agrees with results from other viral infections such as Dengue fever, rubella, Ebola, measles and influenza. 17e19, 23 The clinical significance of neopterin was also determined in hemorrhagic fevers including Dengue fever and Ebola virus infection. 17e19 Higher increase of neopterin level in DF patients was associated with longer duration of fever and thus predicted the clinical course of the disease. 17, 18 In Ebola infection, Baize et al. found low but significant levels of neopterin in survivors during the symptomatic phase and significantly high neopterin concentrations in fatalities. 19 In the current study, we also analyzed the clinical significance of increased neopterin in early stage of hospitalization of CCHF patients. The mean concentration of neopterin in the patients with fatal CCHF disease was nearly threefold higher than that of nonfatal CCHF disease. The mean concentrations of neopterin before death in patients with fatal CCHF disease were even higher than the mean serum neopterin of the first day of hospitalization. However, the levels of neopterin decreased to lower levels in patients with nonfatal CCHF. This shows that those CCHF patients with lower neopterin concentrations are more likely to recover than others. High serum neopterin levels in fatal patients may reflect severe inflammation and intense activation of cell-mediated immune response in severe CCHF disease. Recently, in another study we found that viral load !1 \u00c2 10 9 RNA copies/ml could be considered to predict a fatal outcome in CCHF disease. 24 Together with viral load, neopterin could be a measure of the severity of CCHF disease.",
