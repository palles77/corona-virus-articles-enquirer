Acute and catastrophic presentations with back pain have a poorer outcome. 14 Recovery is often related to the clinical presentation and may or may not be complete. In general, one third of patients with acute TM make a good recovery, another third have fair recovery, and the rest either fail to improve or die. 3, 5, 13 In idiopathic TM treated with methylprednisolone using the Medical Research Council (MRC) scale for muscle strength, 37.5% were reported to have complete recovery or minimal residual deficit (MRC 5-4), 43% had partial recovery (MRC 3), and 19.4% had severe disability or absent recovery (MRC 0-2). Factors associated with poor outcomes include severe initial symptoms with spinal shock, delayed presentation to the hospital after maximum deficits have already occurred, development of syringomyelia, and extensive MRI lesions. 6, 13 If no recovery has occurred by 1 to 3 months, complete recovery is less likely. 4, 14 ",

Weakness may affect only the lower limbs or all four limbs with varying severity. It may be complete, incomplete, or may present as one of the spinal cord syndromes. The clinical spinal level usually corresponds to the lesion, but lower limb findings do not preclude a lesion at the cervical level. Sensory complaints may include hypersensitivity, numbness, tingling, coldness, burning, or as a circumferential constriction. Pain is a common symptom in one third to one half of patients and may be central or localized, aching or radicular in character. Bowel frequency or constipation may occur, and bladder symptoms include increased frequency, retention, and incontinence. 2, 3, 13 The history, including past medical, family, and detailed social, may reveal symptoms of recent infection, immunocompromised or autoimmune condition, space-occupying lesion, demyelinating disease, travel, vaccination, trauma, sexual exposure, animal, insect or tick bites. Whether vaccination triggers TM has been debated. There were only seven cases of TM and eight of acute disseminated encephalomyelitis (ADEM) in the primary vaccination exposure window of 5 to 18 days prior to onset, after 64 million doses within a healthcare network. The incidences were both nonstatistically significant except ADEM with Tdap (tetanus, diphtheria, and pertussis) vaccine at P = .04 (translating into 1.16 cases per million doses). 15 A careful review may yield systemic symptoms, including the upper respiratory tract with cough and difficulty in breathing, chest pain, rashes, joint aches, muscle pain, vision changes, nausea, diarrhea, constipation, and problems with urinary function. Particular attention should be paid to details pointing toward potentially treatable or reversible conditions responsive to antimicrobials or surgical decompression.",

The patient can independently use a powered wheelchair and propel a lightweight manual wheelchair with hand rim projections (\"quad knobs\") for limited distances over level ground. C6 innervation allows independence with upper extremity dressing, bathing with equipment, and functional propulsion of a manual wheelchair indoors. The patient with superior balance and motor control could theoretically perform independent or supervised transfers with a sliding board, and self-catheterize with appropriate assistive devices. Driving a specially adapted automatic transmission vehicle with powered steering, hand-controlled accelerator and brake can be achieved with C7-C8 preservation. A C7 level allows independence in all self-care activities with equipment, independent transfers with ability to push off using intact elbow extensor muscles, and the patient may be able to live alone. A patient with C8 and T1 innervation will have improved manual strength and dexterity for self-care, is independent with a manual wheelchair, and should be able to self-catheterize. Preservation of upper thoracic innervation allows a greater degree of trunk control, increasing stability during use and propulsion of a manual wheelchair. It also adds to ease and independence with bladder and bowel self-management. With bracing of the hips, knees, and ankles (KAFO or knee-ankle-foot orthoses), minimal ambulation can be attempted, although mainly for training and exercise purposes than truly functional. Independent ambulation, even with bracing and bilateral axillary or forearm crutches, is usually not realistic unless the patient has preservation of some upper lumbar innervation. Further preservation of lumbar and sacral innervation will increase ease of ambulation with better trunk and pelvic control. The patient with incomplete spinal injury is less predictable, and functional abilities will largely depend on the degree and nature of neurologic preservation.",

            "text": "MRI scans show features that help differentiate TM from disorders such as multiple sclerosis (Figs. 162.1 and 162.2). The lesion in TM tends to affect the central region of the cord and involve more than two thirds of the cord diameter, whereas in multiple sclerosis it is usually more peripheral and involves less than half of the cord diameter. 17 TM is more often associated with high signal intensity on T2-weighted images extending longitudinally over more segments. 17, 18 The number of segments involved may be from 1 or 2 up to 11, and the entire cord or sometimes only the medulla may be affected. 17, 18, 20, 21 The lesion in TM at times resembles a spinal cord tumor and biopsy may even be attempted during investigation. 17, 18, 19 MRI of the brain with contrast enhancement is often performed to help determine whether the MRI findings point toward multiple sclerosis rather than \"idiopathic\" TM. In idiopathic partial TM, a study that does not show brain lesions translates to the likelihood of evolving multiple sclerosis at 15% to 44%. When brain lesions such as white matter plaques (especially periventricular) are seen, the chance for development of multiple sclerosis increases to 44% to 93%. 22 Asymmetric motor or sensory symptoms and absence of peripheral nervous system involvement at presentation suggest acute myelopathic multiple sclerosis, whereas symmetric symptoms and peripheral nervous system involvement suggest acute TM. 23, 24 Immunoglobulin G antibodies may be useful for determining neuromyelitis optica (Devic's disease) as the etiology in patients with acute complete TM. Longitudinally extensive TM spanning three or more vertebral segments is an important feature and detection of anti-aquaporin 4-specific antibodies (anti-AQP4, AQ4P-Ab, or NMO-IgG) is useful to determine both increased risk for recurrence and conversion to neuromyelitis optica. 13, 25 Other tests include the usual blood counts and chemistry, tests for autoimmune conditions, such as antinuclear antibodies, anti-double-stranded DNA antibodies, anti-Sm antibodies, erythrocyte sedimentation rate, SS-A antibody for Sj\u00f6gren disease, immunoglobulin levels, and VDRL. Vitamin B 12 enteric cytopathic human orphan virus may be elevated. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) technique is useful for amplifying minute quantities of DNA or RNA. It was used in a recent case report on acute myelitis caused by Zika virus infection, which responded well to high-dose prednisolone. 26 A lumbar puncture allows assessment of cerebrospinal fluid pressure, and samples for cell count, determination of protein and glucose concentrations, measurement of immunoglobulins, and protein electrophoresis. Oligoclonal bands detected in cerebrospinal fluid are useful in making a diagnosis. In one report, they were present in three of five patients with multiple sclerosis-associated TM, but in none of four patients with parainfectious TM. 4 Nerve conduction studies (NCS), electromyography (EMG), as well as somatosensory and motor evoked potentials may be useful for establishing diagnosis and monitoring progress. 2,27 Urinary system evaluation including cystourethrography, cystoscopy, a baseline renal ultrasound, and urodynamic studies with or without video, have been recommended because of the very high rates of persistent long-term bladder dysfunction. 28, 29 Bowel evaluation may require radiography, computed tomography (CT), and MRI scans with or without contrast, or colonoscopy to rule out obstruction. In 2002, the TM Consortium Working Group proposed the criteria in Table 162 .1 for the diagnosis of idiopathic acute TM. 1 A comparison by de Seze 8 of the clinical findings, MRI results, laboratory profiles, and outcomes of patients with acute myelopathy according to etiology is presented in ",

The ability to provide antiviral or antibacterial agents and surgical intervention may also be critical when a specific cause has been identified. Several anti-inflammatory drugs have been tried for TM without clear success. Although there is insufficient evidence for corticosteroid efficacy, intravenous methylprednisolone is often used to prevent further damage to the spinal cord as a result of swelling. 12, 20, 21 During the acute phase, it may lead to faster recovery and less disability, and is well tolerated. 22 Cyclophosphamide exerts an immunosuppressive and immunomodulatory effect through suppression of cell-mediated and humoral immunity (on the T cells and B cells). 22 Cyclophosphamide together with methylprednisolone may help in lupus-related TM. 21, 30 However, there appears to be an absence of any beneficial effect of immunosuppressive drugs (cyclophosphamide, azathioprine, intravenous immune globulin) in patients with idiopathic acute TM. 6, 12 Plasma exchange to remove autoreactive antibodies and other toxic molecules from plasma may be effective with a good clinical response, especially within 20 days of onset and when nonresponsive to highdose corticosteroids. 12, 21 The monoclonal antibody rituximab can be effective in decreasing relapses in TM due to NMO. 12",

All muscles and joints should be kept as active as possible, and daily exercises to preserve range of motion of the joints will help prevent contractures and keep joints flexible. Progressive resistive exercises and possibly functional electrical stimulation (FES), also known as neuromuscular electrical stimulation, help maintain strength and decrease muscle atrophy. 31 Exercises for inspiratory muscles should be included and use of an incentive spirometer as needed. Rarely, glossopharyngeal breathing may need to be taught and electrical stimulation of the phrenic nerve diaphragm considered in the high cervical cord patient not showing recovery. 32 Spasticity (see Chapter 154) is a possible complication and regular stretching with use of antispasticity medications such as baclofen, diazepam, gabapentin, and tizanidine, can minimize and decrease development of joint contractures. If pain is present, appropriate medications, thermal (heat, cold), and electrical modalities including transcutaneous electrical stimulation may be helpful. Antiepileptic drugs such as gabapentin, pregabalin, and carbamazepine, may be prescribed as they have good efficacy for neuropathic pain. Amitriptyline may also be useful, although caution is advised with its strong anticholinergic effects. Thorough checks of the skin on a daily basis can help avoid pressure sores and associated infections. Insensate areas, particularly over bony prominences, should be relieved with special cushions and mattresses such as eggcrate foam and alternating pressure overlays, and pressurerelieving ankle-foot orthoses (PRAFO) may be helpful.

A program may be needed to avert a neglected neurogenic bowel or bladder leading to stool impaction and hydroureter or hydronephrosis. An indwelling catheter can initially be used for bladder drainage but intermittent catheterization, independently or otherwise, should be instituted whenever possible. Longterm follow-up of 2 to 10 years in pediatric patients with TM has shown that residual bladder dysfunction is common even with improvement of paraparesis and lack of urologic symptoms. In one study, 86% had persistent bladder dysfunction and 77% had persistent bowel dysfunction. 28, 29 A bowel program includes adequate fluids, proper diet, activity, and scheduled bowel movements. Upper motor neuron bowels may need a stool softener (e.g., docusate), osmotic laxative (lactulose), or stimulant laxative (senna or bisacodyl) for evacuation. Digital stimulation of the rectum is often effective and needs to be taught. With areflexic lower motor neuron bowels, use of bulk laxatives like psyllium or methylcellulose to produce formed stools may help during digital manual evacuation. Bowel evacuation is often done on a daily basis in the hospital, but frequency can be extended to every 2 or 3 days once an individual returns home.

Pain management may include medications such as analgesics, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs, short courses of cyclooxygenase-2 inhibitors, various anticonvulsants, and tricyclic antidepressants.",

            "text": "Overuse syndromes often occur because muscles and joints are overstressed during functional compensation for weakness or even during the process of rehabilitation training. Shoulder pain is a common phenomenon with causes including tendinitis, rotator cuff injury, impingement syndromes, contractures, and inflammatory or degenerative arthritis. Steroid and local anesthetic injections in the joint may sometimes be needed, but topical anti-inflammatory drugs, heat, cold, and other modalities, with proper transfer techniques or specific adaptive equipment such as sliding board, are often helpful. A common complication is ischemic breakdown of the skin if pressure relief is not regularly performed. Awareness and monitoring for deep venous thrombosis and pulmonary embolism should be routine. Prolonged pressure on a peripheral nerve can also cause dysesthesias, pain, or weakness. There may be sexuality, reproduction, and fertility concerns, particularly in younger as well as sexually active patients. The concerns and possible solutions should be discussed, addressed, or referred to a specialist as appropriate.",

Strictures or tracheal irritation can result from tracheostomy tubes, lung infections are common in this population, and the ventilators may break down, resulting in an emergency situation. High-dose corticosteroids frequently used for treatment of inflammation in the spinal cord may result in peptic ulcer disease or gastrointestinal bleeding. Thromboembolism prophylaxis and anticoagulant treatment in the event of this happening may result in serious bleeding complications. Skin breakdown may result at contact and pressure areas with devices or dressings used. Frequent catheterization results in increased risk for urinary tract infections and accidental creation of false passages in the urethra with development of strictures. If bowel programs are not well managed or carried out gently, there may be discomfort, pain, and anorectal injuries.",

Similar devices are available for upper limb training (e.g., InMotion ARM [Bionik Labs] and Armeo [Hocoma Inc.]). Neuroprostheses using FES to increase forearm reach, hand grasp, and opening (e.g., H200 [Bioness Inc.]) or compensate for thigh weakness and foot drop (e.g., Para-Step I [Sigmedics, Inc.], L300/L300Plus [Bioness Inc.], WalkAide [Innovative Neurotronics Inc.]) are also available. Less frequently encountered in the United States but more in Europe, the anterior sacral root stimulation Finetech-Brindley device can be very effective for bladder management (Vocare, NeuroControl/NDI Medical).
