Boophilus microplus infestation caused a marginal decrease in the percentage of T lymphocytes in PBL, which was observed in both lightly (5000 larvae) and heavily (40 000 larvae) infested cattle, and began at the second infestation and continued until the end of the fourth infestation. The percentage ofB lymphocytes in heavily tick-infested cattle was less than that in non-infested control cattle after the fourth infestation. The response of PBL from tick-infested cattle to phytohemagglutinin (PHA) was always less than that of tick-free cattle after the second infestation. No noteworthy differences were detected betwccn the three stages of tick infestation, that is. 1 week before the peak of adult engorgement, the middle of the peak and 1 week after all ticks had dropped. Boophilus microplus saliva ( 100/11 ml-t ) suppressed 47% of the response of bovine PBL to PHA in vitro.",

The response oflymphocytes from tick-infested cattle was consistently less than that of lymphocytes from tick-free cattle from the second infestation onwards.

Salivary gland extract showed increasing inhibition up to a concentration of 500/~g ml-~ (Fig. 4) . To confirm this effect, PBL were isolated from three cattle and the effect of saliva at 50/tg ml-~ and salivary gland extract at 0.5, 5.0 and 50.0 #g ml-I on PHA-induced mitogenesis were measured. Saliva produced a mean inhibition of 46% (range 49-44%) and salivary gland protein at 50 #g ml-I induced a mean inhibition of 41% (range 46-32% ). The lower concentrations of salivary gland protein did not producc significant inhibition. It was shown that 100 #1 ml-t of saliva used as the maximum concentration in the lymphocyte assay contained 1.5 X 10 4 M pilocarpine as a result of the means of isolation. In control experiments it was shown that this concentration of pilocarpine had no detectable effect on lymphocyte mitogenesis.",

This decrease in the percentage of T lymphocytes was observed in both lightly and heavily infested cattle.

Importantly, there was no difference between the two groups. After the fourth infestation, the percentage of B lymphocytes in heavily tick-infested cattle was less than that from tick-free cattle. Histological studies revealed that lymphocytes could accumulate in skin sites where ticks were feeding (Schleger et al., 1976; Askenase, 1977; Nithiuthai and Allen, 1985 ) . It is possible that tick infestation caused the migration into skin sites of circulating lymphocytes, thus resulting in the slight reduction in mature lymphocytes in peripheral blood.",

The decrease in the percentage of T lymphocytes was too small to explain the reduction of the response of PBL from tick-infested cattle to PHA, suggesting that there may be a direct effect on the capacity of the lymphocytes to respond to stimuli. No noteworthy differences were detected between the three stages of tick infestation, that is, l week before the peak engorgement of adults, the middle of the peak and l week after all ticks had dropped. This suggests that any suppressive effects of tick infestation are manifested during the entire adult tick infestation period and for some time after ticks have left the host. We did not determine how long the suppressive effect lasted after all the ticks had dropped off the host. It is known that tick infestation causes anemia, loss of appetite, reduced body weight growth, change of blood composition and other deleterious effects on the bovine host (O 'Kelly et al., 197 l; Seebeck et al., 1971; Nelson et al., 1977 ) . Consequently, the stress of infestation may also contribute directly to altered lymphocyte function in host animals. Wikel and Osburn (1982) showed that repeated low-level infestation with D. andersoni (ten females and five males) caused a significant reduction of the response of bovine PBL to PHA, while George et al. (1985) found that Amblyomma americanurn infestation of cattle did not alter the responsiveness of lymphocytes to concanavalin A nor to Escherichia coli lipopolysaccharide. Different tick species clearly have different effects on host PBL function. Interestingly, D. andersoni produces a strong toxin (Gregson, 1973) which might cause immunosuppression directly or through a general systemic effect such as stress.",

This suppressive effect may contribute to the lower responsiveness of PBL from tick-infested cattle. Saliva of Ixodes dammini suppressed interleukin-2 (IL-2) secretion by a T lymphocyte hybridoma (Ribeiro et al., 1985) and also inhibited neutrophil function (Ribeiro et al., 1990) . In those studies, 0.15-0.57/tl ml-~ of saliva suppressed 38-95% of IL-2 production by the T lymphocyte hybridoma. It was proposed that the inhibitory activity of saliva was due to prostaglandin E2 (PGE2) and it was estimated that 1 ml of saliva from I. dammini contained 94 ng ofPGE2. Higgs et al. ( 1976 ) estimated that the saliva of B. microplus contained 153 ng mlof PGE2 which is approximately the same concentration as for I. dammini. In the present study, 100/~1 ml-~ of B. microplus saliva suppressed 47% of the response of PBL to PHA. Consequently, something other than PGE2 may cause the strong suppression of lymphocyte function induced by saliva from I. dammini, and saliva from B. microplus must contain negligible quantities ofthis substance. Alternatively, the differences may reflect species differences in the lymphocytes or the different sensitivity of IL-2 production and lymphocyte mitogenesis to suppression.",
