            "text": "Minimizing transmission of tuberculosis (TB) in health care facilities is vital for controlling tuberculosis. Outbreaks of nosocomial TB have been reported frequently. 1-4 TB is endemic in Taiwan. In 2004, 24,161 TB cases were notified, 17,142 were confirmed, and 957 TB-related deaths occurred. 5,6 The notification rate of TB in that year was 75.6 per 100,000 population, a rate 15.1 times higher than in the United States. 7 In 2003, an outbreak of nosocomial transmission of Mycobacterium Background/Purpose: Delayed diagnosis and isolation increases the risk of nosocomial transmission of tuberculosis (TB). To assess the risk of delayed management of TB, we analyzed the risk factors of prolonged delay in isolation of smear-positive TB patients in pulmonology/infectious diseases and other wards in a tertiary teaching hospital. Methods: We enrolled smear-positive TB patients aged > 16 years with delayed respiratory isolation following hospitalization. Medical records were reviewed retrospectively. Time intervals between admission, order of sputum acid-fast staining, initiation of anti-tuberculous treatment and isolation were compared between pulmonology/infectious diseases wards (PIWs) and other wards. Risk factors were analyzed in patients with prolonged isolation delay of > 7 days in individual groups. Results: Isolation was delayed in 191 (73.7%) of 259 hospitalized smear-positive TB patients. Median suspicion, treatment and isolation delays were 0, 3 and 4 days in PIWs and 1, 5 and 7 days in other wards. For patients admitted to non-PIWs, atypical chest radiographs, symptoms without dyspnea or not being admitted from the emergency department (ED) were risk factors for prolonged isolation delay exceeding 7 days. The only risk factor for delayed isolation in patients admitted to PIWs was age \u2265 70 years. Conclusion: Delays in suspicion, treatment and isolation of TB patients were longer in non-PIWs. Clinicians should be alert to those admitted to non-PIWs with atypical chest radiographs, atypical symptoms, or not admitted from the ED. [J Formos Med Assoc 2009;108(3):202-209] ",

            "text": "tuberculosis was discovered through screening for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in a hospital in northern Taiwan. 8 Guidelines for TB infection control published by the US Center for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) have been implemented widely in health care facilities in the United States. 9 The results have been readily apparent in the decreased number of TB outbreaks and transmission of M. tuberculosis to patients and health care workers (HCWs) in health care facilities. [10] [11] [12] The CDC guidelines recommend calculating the time intervals from admission to suspicion, diagnostic procedures, isolation and initiation of effective anti-tuberculous chemotherapy as an important part of infection control programs. 9, 10 The risk of exposure to TB is thought to be higher in pulmonology/infectious diseases wards (PIWs) because of the larger number of contagious patients managed in these departments. In addition, infectious disease specialists and pulmonologists are more familiar with the symptoms of TB, and are more alert to its radiographic findings. As a result, TB patients are more likely to be diagnosed earlier in PIWs. We therefore hypothesized that delayed diagnosis, treatment and isolation may be shorter in these departments.",

Medical records were retrospectively reviewed. There were 1880 patients reported with TB at CGMH between July 2002 and September 2004. As a result of the limited number of available negative-pressure isolation rooms, most of the reported TB patients were not hospitalized and were managed in the outpatient clinics. Only 259 (13.7%) patients with positive sputum AFS and cultures were hospitalized. Delayed isolation was defined as patients with positive AFS and M. tuberculosis cultures in respiratory tract specimens who were not transferred to negativepressure isolation rooms immediately after admission.

Nevertheless, institutional risk of TB transmission is correlated with indicators of patient care such as delayed diagnosis and treatment. 15 TB transmission occurs when patients are not immediately placed in respiratory isolation. 1 Lack of specific presentations may delay suspicion, diagnosis and ultimately, respiratory isolation. 16, 17 HCWs with unprotected exposure to infectious TB before suspicion of TB and proper respiratory isolation are at increased risk of contracting TB. 10 The duration of management delays has varied in previous studies. A study in Washington DC, USA, found that 58% of hospitalized TB cases were not identified immediately after admission, 26% were not diagnosed until 4 weeks after admission, and 20% were not diagnosed or treated throughout their entire hospital stay. 18 Another study in St. Louis, USA, reported a median treatment delay of 3 days, and up to one-third of these patients had a management delay of more than 10 days. 19 In a Canadian multicenter study, which included both smear-positive and smearnegative TB patients, the median interval from admission until isolation was 12.5 days in hospitalized patients receiving delayed treatment. 15 The present study showed that 73.3% of hospitalized AFS-positive TB patients were not initially managed properly.

The present study demonstrated that TB patients in PIWs had significantly shorter delays for suspicion, treatment and respiratory isolation. Fifty-four (28.3%) of 191 patients experienced prolonged delays in respiratory isolation, which exceeded 7 days. The proportion of patients with prolonged delays was significantly higher in the non-PIW group (41.9%, 39/93) than in the PIW group (15.3%, 15/98). However, in the multiple regression model that included all study subjects, the ward of admission was not a significant factor for prolonged isolation delay after we adjusted for other variables. The proportion of patients with atypical chest radiographs did not differ significantly between these two groups. More patients had fever and respiratory symptoms including cough, sputum or hemoptysis in PIWs. A higher percentage of TB patients admitted to PIWs had been suspected of having TB and AFS was ordered at the ED. For patients in non-PIWs, most of the diagnoses were not related to pulmonary disease and fewer patients had been suspected of having TB at the ED. Factors such as symptoms, radiographic presentations or sputum AFS at the ED, but not the ward of admission, were the risk factors for delayed diagnosis and isolation. In the non-PIW group, multiple logistic regression analysis showed that patients without dyspnea, those with atypical chest radiographs, and those not admitted from the ED had a higher risk of delayed isolation of > 7 days. On the contrary, respiratory symptoms, systemic symptoms, patterns of chest radiographs or AFS ordering at the ED were not associated with prolonged isolation delay in PIW patients. The only significant risk factor for prolonged isolation delay was age \u2265 70 years in PIW patients.",

Physicians at the ED play a role of \"gatekeeper\" in providing a first-line defense against nosocomial transmission of infectious diseases including TB, SARS and other communicable respiratory diseases. 20 Eighty-nine percent of our patients with delayed respiratory isolation were admitted to the hospital from the ED. A similar result in a New York City hospital study showed that the percentage of AFS-positive patients admitted from the ED was 84.7-88.5% between 1992 and 1994. 21 Moran et al found that TB was presumed in 71% of cases admitted from the ED and was significantly associated with shorter delays in isolation and therapy. 22 Here, only 35% of the patients had been suspected of having TB with sputum AFS ordered at the ED. The reason for the low rate of suspicion was probably the lack of typical radiographic findings at the ED. Sokolove et al reported that 25% of active TB patients had atypical chest radiographs at the ED. 16 Our data showed that 34% of smear-positive TB patients had atypical chest radiographs at the ED. Lack of typical symptoms might be another risk factor for delayed suspicion. Sokolove et al also found that only onethird of active TB patients at the ED had chief complaints of pulmonary symptoms, and cough was noted in only 64% of cases and was the chief complaint in < 20% of cases. 16 In the present study, cough was noted in 54.5% of hospitalized AFS-positive TB patients, 49.2% of them had fever, and only 37.7% had sputum. Ordering sputum AFS for all patients with pulmonary infiltrates at the ED, but not only for those with typical chest radiographs, might be beneficial for the earlier detection of contagious TB in hospitalized patients.",

This may result in the delayed isolation of these contagious TB patients. The median delay from suspicion to isolation was 3 days in the present work. If all TB suspects were isolated properly before AFS results become available, the delay of isolation could be shortened for a median of 3 days. An expanded respiratory isolation policy to isolate all TB suspects has been implemented in a US hospital, which led to proper isolation of > 95% of patients with TB upon admission, but resulted in an eight-fold overuse of isolation rooms. 23 There were not sufficient isolation rooms to isolate all TB suspects in our hospital, and early suspicion and diagnosis might be the better way to decrease the risk of unprotected exposure to infectious TB.",

Patients admitted to non-PIWs with atypical chest radiographs, atypical symptoms for TB, or those not admitted from the ED had a higher risk of prolonged isolation delay that exceeded 7 days.
