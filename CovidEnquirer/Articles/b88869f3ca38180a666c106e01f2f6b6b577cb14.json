            "text": "influenza vaccinee was a healthy 28-year-old woman who, unlike the other volunteers, had not received yearly influenza vaccinations, but had a clinical history of a severe influenza-like syndrome 3 years before scanning. Her 5-day post-vaccination scan (figure) revealed extensive bilateral node activation throughout the chest external to the mediastinum. She was completely free of signs or symptoms during the ensuing extensive negative work-up for occult disease, and has remained completely healthy over the subsequent 6 years. We interpret this massive activation of upper torso nodes, in part, as a physical reflection of recall responses to non-vaccine strains-the \"original antigenic sin\" phenomenon, which is well described for influenza. It is also consistent with the finding that the secondary immune response to influenza infection exceeds the primary response by 1000-fold in terms of responding cell numbers. 3 It hints at greater potential protection by natural infection than by yearly vaccination in the setting of a major antigenic shift in influenza.",

            "text": "Sir--There is still no proven therapy for severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS). The protocol reported by Loletta So and colleagues 1 emphasised the combination use of ribavirin and high-dose corticosteroid. However, if given very early in the course of the disease, this approach could suppress the generation of host immunity to the novel coronavirus. We observed a biphasic pattern of illness in SARS and postulated that the first stage represents a viraemic phase and the second phase is an immune phase. 2 Acute respiratory distress syndrome seems to be a complication in the second phase. 2 If this hypothesis is true, antiviral agents will be most beneficial in the first phase, whereas corticosteroids should be delayed until the onset of the second phase to maximise benefit and keep the negative effects of immune suppression to a minimum. We, therefore, developed a treatment protocol 3 that emphasises early use of ribavirin but delayed introduction of corticosteroids until the second week, if possible. One oral 2000 mg loading dose of ribavirin was given to patients as soon as they received medical attention, followed by 600 mg ribavirin twice daily for patients with a bodyweight greater than 75 kg or 1000 mg daily for those with a bodyweight of 75 kg or less (400 mg in morning, 600 mg in evening) for 10 days. For patients who developed pneumonia, intravenous methylprednisolone (2 mg/kg daily for 5 days) was started on day 8 of fever or later. If rapid deterioration occurred before day 8, steroid treatment was started upon development of dyspnoea. If respiratory distress was not responsive to this dose, 500 mg methylprednisolone daily for 3 days was given. Upon improvement, the dose of steroid was tapered off over the next 2 weeks as recovery warranted.",

Overwhelmed by the might and sophistication of western science, traditional medical texts in developing countries were soon replaced by western books. And that is where the problem arose.

Terms such as \"Swiss cheese appearance\", \"doughnut mastopexy\", \"Champagne glass appearance\", \"cottage loaf sign\", \"scalloped meat sign\", \"pig-tail catheter\", and \"jack-in-the-box\" might be completely meaningless to many medical students training in countries where such items are not available. Students studying medicine in these countries face two obstacles: understanding the scientific content of the lessons, and deciphering terms that were originally coined to make their lessons more understandable.

            "text": "Japan. Information about cases of SARS needs to be reported accurately and disseminated in a timely way to help limit the spread of the disease. Inadequate reporting and lack of information may propagate public myths and cause further transmission of the disease. 1 Fortunately, local transmission of SARS was not observed in Japan this Spring.
