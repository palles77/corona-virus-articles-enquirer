The purified lectin has a molecular mass of \u223c30 kDa in reducing as well as in non-reducing SDS-PAGE. In hydrodynamic studies by Dynamic Light Scattering (DLS) showed that purified lectin was monomeric in nature with a molecular size of 2.38 \u00b1 0.03 nm. Agglutination activity of purified lectin was confirmed by rabbit erythrocytes and its agglutination activity was inhibited by d-mannose and a glycoprotein (ovalbumin). Glycoprotein nature of purified lectin was confirmed by Periodic Acid Schiff's (PAS) stain. Purified lectin showed moderate pH and thermal stability by retaining hemagglutination activity from pH 6-8 and temperature up to 60 \u2022 C. It also suppressed the growth of human colon cancer cells (Caco-2) and cervical cancer cells (HeLa) with IC 50 values of 127 g/mL and 158 g/mL respectively, after 24-h treatment. Morphological studies of treated cells (Caco-2 and HeLa) with hyacinth lectin by AO/EB dual staining indicated that purified lectin is capable of inducing apoptosis.",

Initially, lectins were characterised as hemagglutinins due to their ability to agglutinate either human or rabbit erythrocytes [2] . They are found in all living organisms (bacteria, fungus, plant, and animal) [3] and are mainly involved in carbohydrate recognition with various applications in immunology, glycoproteins purification, virology, cytochemistry and cell biology [2, [4] [5] [6] [7] . In plants, they are expressed in all parts and are extracted from seeds, bulbs, leaves, fruits, roots, and flowers [8] [9] [10] [11] . Due to their diverse role in plants such as storage of proteins [12] , protection from insects [13] , cell wall propagation [14] , a carrier for sugar moieties [15] and mitogenic stimulation [16] , lectins have been explored more in detail over the last couple of years. Besides their biological activities plant lectins are also used for diagnostics purpose of various diseases, and widely used in drug delivery systems [17] . Several lectins also act as antiviral agents such as concavalin A, musa acuminate lectin, narcissus pseudonarcissusu lectin and many more [18, 19] . Mannose specific lectin isolated from plant showed anti-corona viral activity which is an acute respiratory syndrome caused by coronavirus [20] .",

Hyacinth lily is a bulbous monocotyledon plant that belongs to the family of Asparagaceae and subfamily Scilloideae.

Lectin was purified using a combination of an ion exchange chromatography DEAE and gel filtration chromatography sephadex G-75. Purified hyacinth lectin showed hemagglutination activity towards rabbit erythrocytes with titter value of hemagglutination observed up to 0.06 mg/mL. Purified lectin was found to be a glycoprotein as determined by PAS staining whereas carbohydrate content of lectin was observed up to 5.2%. Similar carbohydrate contents of lectin have been reported in case of lectin purified from Artocarpus integerifolia and Clathrotropis nitida [34] Hemagglutination activity of hyacinth lectin was inhibited by mannose and ovalbumin which suggested that its manose binding lectin which is one of the significant properties of lectin purified from monocotyledon plants. Hyacinth lectin showed moderate temperature and pH stability. It is stable up to 60 \u2022 C and started to lose hemagglutination activity after heating above 60 \u2022 C. It maintained 50% hemagglutination activity upto 70 \u2022 C while above 70 \u2022 C it did not showed any activity. Similar pattern of stability of lectin was shown in case of Colocasia esculenta, Crinum latifolium [38] . Hyacinth lectin is stable over wide a range of pH from 4 to 12. Hemagglutination activity of hyacinth lectin is maximum in the range of pH 6-8 while in lower pH 4 its hemagglutination activity decreased upto 50% in higher pH 10 it is reduced upto 70% and above pH 10 it did not showed any hemagglutination activity. Dynamic scattering experiment showed that hyacinth lectin was monomeric in nature with no aggregation in solution. The hydrodynamic redii of hyacinth lectin showed 2.38 \u00b1 0.03 nm which corresponds to a molecular weight of \u223c30 kDa [39] . Antiproliferative and apoptosis activity have been shown in case of various lectins isolated from plant bulbs such as Sauromatum venosum, Arisaema jacquemontii [40, 41] We have demonstrated dose dependent antiproliferative nature of hyacinth lectin against human cancer cell lines Caco-2 and HeLa. Among the two cell lines we observe higher sensitivity of lectin mediated apoptotic response in Caco-2 cells with an IC 50 value of 127 \u00b1 5 g/mL. This is the first report from hyacinth lectin on antiproliferative activity although other lectins from different plant sources have been reported for their anti-proliferative activity [42] .",
