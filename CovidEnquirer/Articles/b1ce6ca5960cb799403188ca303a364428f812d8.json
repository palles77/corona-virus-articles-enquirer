            "text": "[58], these results are suggestive of 402 nucleic acid deterioration in mosquitoes upon storage at high temperature. 403 Discussion 404 Mosquito control strategies that rely on the introduction of Wolbachia are now being deployed 405 around the world [7-9], and the surveillance of efficacy and spread require agile, field-based 406 methods for both mosquito and symbiont detection. Unfortunately, currently available tools for 407 mosquito diagnostics have several shortcomings. Morphological identification methods are 408 inherently low throughput, require extensive technical expertise, and cannot also readily identify 409 pathogens or biocontrol agents such as Wolbachia. Spectroscopy, such as near infrared 410 spectroscopy [59] and Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy [60], allow identification of 411 mosquito species, Wolbachia, and pathogens, but require expensive instruments and expertise that 412 are generally incompatible with low-resource settings. Immunoassays can detect pathogen-413 carrying vectors but are insensitive and cannot also identify vector species. Nucleic acid 414 amplification methods could potentially look at both vector and sybmiont sequences, but are heavily 415 reliant on PCR with the ensuing encumbrances of expensive instruments and trained operators, 416 again precluding widespread use. 417 Isothermal nucleic acid amplification assays would facilitate field-based vector monitoring, but most 418 reported approaches rely on nucleic acid purification and non-specific readout, and thus suffer from 419 laborious setup and the risk of false positives [61-63]. Probe-read isothermal methods such as the 420 assay (RPA) are more reliable but still require expensive and proprietary 421 reaction formulations and probes, which limits their flexibility and versatility in assay engineering. 422 Furthermore, most RPA applications for vector diagnostics [64] also depend on extensive sample 423 processing and nucleic acid purification prior to amplification. 424 These drawbacks led us to develop a simpler, more robust field-deployable assay based on loop-425 mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) that can identify both mosquito species and specific 426 Wolbachia strains in mosquitoes. While LAMP assays have previously been developed for 427 Wolbachia detection by targeting the 16S rRNA gene for amplification [61], these assays required 428 extraction and purification of DNA prior to assay, and used non-specific readouts that were highly 429 prone to false positive signals. 430 To overcome these barriers to the use of LAMP, we have previously adopted methods that 431 originated in the field of nucleic acid computation: the use of strand exchange reactions that 432 initiate at complementary single-stranded 'toeholds' and progresses via branch migration. The 433 base-pairing predictability and programmability of strand exchange kinetics promotes the 434 construction of exquisitely sequence-specific oligonucleotide strand displacement (OSD) probes 435 for LAMP amplicons (S2 Fig), thereby greatly reducing the detection of non-specific amplification 436 background [39, 41, 42]. For instance, we recorded positive coi LAMP-OSD signals from field-437 caught Ae. aegypti mosquitos but did not detect signal from closely related Ae. albopictus and 438 Ochlerotatus species mosquitoes. Similarly, the wsp assay detected wAlbB and wPip, as 439 expected, but not wMel Wolbachia. 440 Strand exchange circuits have the additional advantage that they can be used to embed 441 algorithms and act as 'matter computers' [35-37, 65]. For example, strand exchange transducers 442",
