Many of these are a result of the unusual relationship of the lung with the outside world. Every breath that a human takes brings the outside world into the body in the form of infectious agents, organic and inorganic particles, and noxious agents of all types. Although the lung has many defense mechanisms to protect itself from these insults, these are not infallible and so lung pathology arises. Damage to the lung is particularly important given the role of the lung in the survival of the organism. Any impairment of lung function has widespread effects throughout the body, since all organs depend on the lungs for the oxygen they need. Pulmonary pathology catalogs the changes in the lung tissues and the mechanisms through which these occur. What follows is a review of lung pathology and the current state of knowledge about the pathogenesis of each disease. We believe that a clear understanding of both morphology and mechanism is required for the development of new therapies and preventive measures.",

The most recent estimates available from the Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results (SEER) program of the National Cancer Institute are that in 2007 over 213,000 people in the United States were diagnosed with cancer of the lung and bronchus, and over 160,000 will have died due to this disease [1] . However, in the past decade incidence and mortality rates have begun to move in a more positive direction, particularly in men. Overall, men show a decline in lung cancer incidence, while in women, although lung cancer rates grew from 1975 through 1998, they stabilized from 1998 through 2004 [2] . Similarly, cancer death rates due to lung cancer have declined for men and have slowed for women. Although, for women, lung cancer death rates have increased since 1975, the rate of increase has slowed to 0.2% annually from 1995 to 2004 [2] . These trends parallel changes in the prevalence of tobacco smoking, the most important risk factor for development of lung cancer.",

            "text": "The World Health Organization (WHO) classification scheme is the most widely used system for classification of these neoplasms (Table 18 .1) [3] . Although there are numerous histologic types and subtypes of lung cancers, most of the common malignant epithelial tumors can be grouped into the categories of nonsmall cell lung cancers (NSCLCs) and small cell carcinomas (SCLCs). NSCLCs include adenocarcinomas (ACs), squamous cell carcinomas (SqCCs), large cell carcinomas, adenosquamous carcinomas, and sarcomatoid carcinomas. SCLCs include cases of pure and combined small cell carcinoma. Common pulmonary symptoms associated with these tumors include cough, shortness of breath, chest pain or tightness, and hemoptysis (coughing up blood). Since some tumors cause airway obstruction, they predispose to pneumonia, which can be an important clue to the existence of a tumor in some patients. Constitutional symptoms can include fever, weight loss, and malaise. Some neoplasms will declare themselves with symptoms related to local invasion of adjacent structures such as chest wall, nerves, superior vena cava, esophagus, or heart. SCLCs are known for early and widespread metastasis and are therefore particularly prone to being discovered through presentations as metastases in distant sites. Some tumors are discovered due to pathophysiologic changes triggered by the release of soluble substances from tumor cells. Endocrine syndromes due to elaboration of hormones are well recognized, and include Cushing syndrome, syndrome of inappropriate antidiuretic hormone, hypercalcemia, carcinoid syndrome, gynecomastia, and others. Hypercoagulability commonly occurs with lung cancers, leading to manifestations of venous thrombosis, nonbacterial thrombotic endocarditis, and disseminated intravascular coagulation. Hematologic changes can include anemia, granulocytosis, eosinophilia, and other abnormalities. Other paraneoplastic syndromes such as clubbing of the fingers, myasthenic syndromes, dermatomyositis/polymyositis, and transverse myelitis are noted in subsets of patients.",

As research advances, these lists continue to grow, and as knowledge has expanded about the roles of these genes in carcinogenesis and tumor behavior, new targeted therapeutic agents have been designed to treat this disease ( Figure 18 .1 and Table 18 .3) [14] . Many other agents are under investigation. In cancers, chromosomal regions harboring TSGs and oncogenes are often deleted or amplified. Allele loss involving loci in 3p14-23 is a consistent feature of lung cancer pathogenesis [15, 16] . Wistuba et al. reported allelic losses of 3p, often multiple and discontinuous, in 96% of the lung cancers studied and in 78% of the precursor lesions [15] . Larger segments of allelic loss were noted in most SCLCs (91%) and SqCCs (95%) than in ACs (71%) and preneoplastic/preinvasive lesions [15] . There was allelic loss in the 600-kb 3p21.3 deletion region in 77% of the lung cancers; 70% of the normal or reneoplastic/preinvasive lesions associated with lung cancers; and 49% of the normal, mildly abnormal, or preneoplastic/ preinvasive lesions found in smokers without lung cancer, but no loss was seen in the samples from people who had never smoked [15] . 8p21-23 deletions are also frequent and early events in the pathogenesis of lung carcinomas [17] , and other common alterations include LOH at 13q, 17q, 18q, and 22p [16] .",

A recent study utilizing a bacterial artificial chromosome array to perform high-resolution whole genome profiling of SqCC and AC cell lines showed that regions of frequent amplification shared by both types of tumors included 5p; chromosome 7, 8q, 11q13, 19q, and 20q; and common regions of deletion included 3p, 4q, 9p, 10p, 10q; chromosome 18; and chromosome 21 [10] . However, ACs appeared to have higher frequencies of deletion of chromosome 6; 8p, 9q, 15q; and chromosome 16 than SqCCs, and possess small regions of amplification on chromosomes 12 and 14 not seen in SqCCs. Chromosome arms 2q and 13q were frequently deleted in AC but amplified in SqCC cell lines. Both types of tumors showed deletion of chromosome arm 17p, but it was more frequent in the SqCC cell lines, while amplification of chromosome 17p was more frequent in ACs. Amplification of chromosome 3q was common to both types of tumors but showed frequent alteration at 3q23-3q26 in the SqCC lines and at 3q22 in the AC lines. Inactivation of recessive oncogenes is believed to occur through a two-stage process. It has been suggested that the first allelic inactivation occurs, often via a point mutation, and the second allele is later inactivated by a chromosomal deletion, translocation or other alteration such as methylation of the gene promoter region [19] . Inactivating mutations in the TSG TP53, which encodes the p53 protein, are the most frequent mutations in lung cancers. These mutations are found in up to 50% of NSCLCs and over 70% of SCLCs, and are largely attributable to direct DNA damage from cigarette smoke carcinogens [20] . TP53 mutational patterns show a prevalence of G to T transversions in 30% of smokers' lung cancers versus only 12% of lung cancers in nonsmokers [20] . p53 protein is a transcription factor and a key regulator of cell cycle progression; cellular signals induced by DNA damage, oncogene expression, or other stimuli trigger p53dependent responses including initiating cell cycle arrest, apoptosis, differentiation, and DNA repair [21] . Loss of p53 function in tumor cells can result in inappropriate progression through the dysregulated cell cycle checkpoints and permits the inappropriate survival of genetically damaged cells [22] .",

            "text": "The p16 INK4a -cyclin D1-CDK4-Rb pathway, which plays a central role in controlling the G1 to S phase transition of the cell cycle, is another important tumor suppressor pathway that is often disrupted in lung cancers. It interfaces with the p53 pathway through p14 ARF and p21 Waf/Cip1 . Thirty percent to 70% of NSCLCs contain mutations of p16 INK4a , including homozygous deletion or point mutations and epigenetic alterations, leading to p16 INK4a inactivation [22] . Almost 90% of SCLCs and smaller numbers of NSCLCs, on the other hand, display loss of Rb expression [23] , and mutational mechanisms usually responsible include deletion, nonsense mutations, and splicing abnormalities that lead to truncated Rb protein [22] . p16 INK4a leads to hypophosphorylation of the Rb protein, which causes arrest of cells in the G1 phase. The active, hypophosphorylated form of Rb regulates other cellular proteins including the transcription factors E2F1, E2F2, and E2F3, which are essential for progression through the G1/S phase transition. Loss of p16 INK4a protein or increased complexes of cyclin D-CDK4-6 or cyclin E-CDK2 lead to hyperphosphorylation of Rb with resultant evasion of cell cycle arrest and progression into S phase [21, 23] . Cell cycle progression is inhibited by p21 Waf/Cip1 through its inhibition of the cyclin complexes. The 10%-30% of NSCLCs lacking detectable alterations in p16 INK4a and Rb may have abnormalities of cyclin D1 and CDK4, which cause inactivation of the Rb pathway [22] . Figure 18 .2 provides an overview of the p53 and retinoblastoma (Rb) pathways, showing the complex interactions between the components [21] .",

            "text": "Epigenetic alterations (hypermethylation of the 5 0 CpG island) of TSGs are also frequent occurrences during pulmonary carcinogenesis, and methylation profiles of NSCLCs show relationships to smoke exposure, histologic type, and geography. Methylation rates of p16 INK4a and APC and the mean methylation index (MI) (a reflection of the overall methylation status) in current or former smokers were significantly higher than in never smokers; the mean MI of tumors was highest in current smokers; methylation rates of APC, CDH13, and RARbeta were significantly higher in ACs than in SqCCs; methylation rates of MGMT and GSTP1 in cases from the United States and Australia significantly exceeded those from Japanese and Taiwanese cases; and no significant gender-related differences in methylation patterns were found [24] . Proto-oncogene activation and growth factor signaling are important in pulmonary carcinogenesis. The tyrosine kinase epidermal growth factor receptor (EGFR) is frequently mutated in NSCLCs, particularly in ACs, and the mutational status is important in determining response to tyrosine kinase inhibitors. A related pathway, the phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)/Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) pathway, is frequently deregulated in pulmonary carcinogenesis. As reviewed by Marinov et al., this pathway has been reported to mediate the effects of several tyrosine kinase receptors, including EGFR, c-Met, c-Kit, and IGF-IR, on proliferation and survival in NSCLC and SCLC [25] . Clinical trials are ongoing, investigating the efficacy of the mTOR inhibitor rapamycin and its analogues on lung cancer [26] . HER2/neu is another related receptor tyrosine kinase that is upregulated in approximately 20%-30% of NSCLCs [27, 28] , but unlike the situation with HER2/neu-positive breast cancers, treatment with anti-HER2/neu antibody (trastuzumab) does not seem to yield comparable benefits for NSCLC when used alone or in combination with chemotherapy [28, 29] . Point mutations of RAS family proto-oncogenes (most often at K-RAS codons 12, 13, or 61) are detected in 20%-30% of lung ACs and 15%-50% of all NSCLCs [22] . Although farnesyl transferase inhibitors prevent Ras signaling, these agents have not shown significant activity as single-agent therapy in untreated NSCLC or relapsed SCLC [30] . MYC family genes (MYC, MYCN, and MYCL), which play roles in cell cycle regulation, proliferation, and DNA synthesis, are more frequently activated in SCLCs than in NSCLCs, either by gene amplification or by transcriptional dysregulation [22] . Vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) is a homodimeric glycoprotein that is overexpressed in many lung cancers and directly stimulates endothelial cell proliferation, promotes endothelial cell survival in newly formed vessels, and induces proteases involved in the degradation of the extracellular matrix needed for endothelial cell migration [31] . Its angiogenic effects are mediated by three receptors: VEGFR-1, VEGFR-2, and VEGFR-3; ligand binding leads to tyrosine kinase activation and activation of the signaling pathways required for angiogenesis [31] . Monoclonal antibodies to VEGF (bevacizumab) and tyrosine kinase inhibitors to VEGFRs have been developed and show promise for treatment of NSCLC. A phase III trial of bevacizumab showed significantly improved overall and progression-free survival when this agent was used in combination with standard first-line chemotherapy in patients with advanced NSCLC, and several smallmolecule VEGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitors have yielded favorable results in phase I and II trials in NSCLC [32] .",

AC has become the most frequent histologic type of lung cancer in parts of the world. It occurs primarily in smokers, but represents the most common type of lung cancer in people who have never smoked and in women. A small subset of these tumors arise in patients with localized scars or diffuse fibrosing lung diseases such as asbestosis and interstitial pneumonia associated with scleroderma [35] . These neoplasms usually arise in the periphery of the lung, and are more likely to invade the pleura and chest wall than other histologic types of lung cancers. Radiologic studies can show one or more nodules, ground-glass opacities, or mixed solid and ground-glass lesions. On gross examination, the neoplasms are often solitary gray-white nodules or masses, sometimes with necrosis or cavitation, which pucker the overlying pleura. Mucin-producing tumors can have a glistening, gelatinous appearance. Other presentations include a pattern of consolidation resembling pneumonia (usually bronchioloalveolar carcinoma) ( Figure 18 .3), multiple nodules, diffuse interstitial widening due to lymphangitic spread, endobronchial lesions with submucosal infiltration, and diffuse visceral pleural infiltration and thickening resembling mesothelioma.",

ACs usually exhibit differentiation toward Clara cells or type II pneumocytes or, less often, goblet cells. They manifest a range of differentiation extending from very well-differentiated tumors with extensive gland formation and little cytoatypia, to poorly differentiated, solid tumors that cannot be categorized as ACs unless one orders a mucin stain (Figure 18.7) . However, most examples include readily identifiable glands. Invasiveness is reflected by the presence of neoplastic glands that infiltrate through stroma or pleura, stimulating a fibroblastic (desmoplastic) response ( Figure 18.4) , or by cells in the lumens of blood vessels or lymphatics.",

AAH exists on a histologic continuum with bronchioloalveolar carcinoma (BAC), which is defined as an in situ (noninvasive) form of AC, in which the neoplastic cells grow along alveolar septa (lepidic growth) without invasion of stroma or vasculature ( Figure 18 .5, Figure 18 .6) [34] . Most BACs exceed 1 cm in diameter and consist of cells with greater degrees of cytoatypia than AAH. Although AAH is found in approximately 3% of patients without lung cancer at autopsy [37] , it has been reported in 9%-21% of lung resection specimens with all types of primary lung cancer and 16%-35% of lung resection specimens with AC [36] .

This region includes NKX2-1, which encodes a lineage-specific transcription factor (thyroid transcription factor-1 [TTF-1]) that activates transcription of target genes including the surfactant proteins, and may be an important proto-oncogene involved in a significant fraction of lung ACs. Immunohistochemical staining for TTF-1 can be performed to detect expression of this factor in most lung adenocarcinomas, aiding in the determination of the lung as the site of origin of the tumor (Figure 18 .9). Additional work using small interfering RNA (siRNA)mediated knockdown of this gene in lung cancer cell lines with amplification led to reductions in tumor cell proliferation, through both decreased cell cycle progression and increased apoptosis, suggesting that gene amplification and overexpression contribute to lung cancer cell proliferation rates and survival [39] .",

EGFR is a receptor tyrosine kinase whose activation by ligand binding leads to activation of cell signaling pathways such as Ras/mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and phosphatidylinositol-3-kinase, which in turn propagates signals for proliferation, blocking of apoptosis, differentiation, motility, invasion, and adhesion [21] . Tumor-acquired mutations in the tyrosine kinase domain of EGFR, often associated with gene amplification, have been found in approximately 5%-10% of NSCLCs in the United States, and are associated with AC histology, never-smoker status, East Asian ethnicity, and female gender [14, 40, 42] . EGFR mutations are frequently in-frame deletions in exon 19, single missense mutations in exon 21, or in-frame duplications/insertions in exon 20, and occasional missense mutations and double mutations can also be detected [40, 43] . EGFR mutation has an inverse correlation with methylation of the p16 INK4a gene and SPARC (secreted protein acidic and rich in cysteine), an extracellular Ca2\u00fe-binding glycoprotein associated with the regulation of cell adhesion and growth [41] . EGFR status is an important predictor of response to EGFR kinase inhibitors: patients with EGFR mutations are most likely to have a significant response to EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy, and EGFR amplification and protein overexpression have been reported to correlate with survival after EGFR tyrosine kinase inhibitor therapy [14, 44] . K-Ras is a member of the Ras family of proteins, which function as signal transducers between cell membrane-based growth factor signaling and the MAPK pathways [21] . K-RAS mutations are associated with smoking, male gender, and poorly differentiated tumors [43] . HER2 (also known as EGFR2 or ERBB2), a member of the EGFR family of receptor tyrosine kinases, is mutated in less than 2% of NSCLC, and does not occur in tumors with EGFR or K-RAS mutation [45] . The HER2 mutations are in-frame insertions in exon 20 and are significantly more frequent in ACs (2.8%), never smokers (3.2%), Asian ethnicity (3.9%), and women (3.6%), similar to EGFR mutations [45] .",

These lesions arise in the bronchi and may be contiguous with the invasive tumor or exist as one or more separate foci. These precursor lesions can also be observed without coexisting invasive carcinoma. Like SqCC, tobacco smoking is the main predisposing factor for SqCC in situ and dysplasia. Unlike invasive SqCC, however, these lesions are not invasive-they do not extend through the basement membrane of the bronchial epithelium. Grossly, they may be invisible or appear as flat, tan or red discolorations of the bronchial mucosa, or tan wart-like excrescences. Microscopically, these lesions encompass a Chapter 18 Molecular Basis of Pulmonary Disease range of squamous changes that include alterations in the thickness of the bronchial epithelium, the maturational progress of squamous differentiation, cell size, and nuclear characteristics ( Figure 18 .13, Figure 18 .14) [11, 49] . As dysplasia increases from mild to moderate to severe, the epithelium thickens, and maturation is increasingly impaired. The basilar zone expands with epithelial cell crowding, the intermediate zone shrinks, and there is reduced flattening of the superficial squamous cells. Cell size, pleomorphism, and anisocytosis usually increase, and there is coarsening of the chromatin and appearance of nucleoli, nuclear angulations, and folding. In carcinoma in situ, although the epithelium may or may not be thickened and the cell size may be small, medium, or large, there is minimal or no maturation from the base to the superficial aspect, and the atypical nuclear features are present throughout the entire thickness of the epithelium. Mitoses appear in the lower third (mild or moderate dysplasia), lower two-thirds (severe dysplasia), or throughout the full thickness of the epithelium (carcinoma in situ).",

SCLC and LCNEC are high-grade carcinomas, typical carcinoid is a low-grade malignant neoplasm, and atypical carcinoid occupies an intermediate position in the spectrum of biologic aggressiveness. In one large series, the 5-year and 10-year survival rates for typical carcinoid were 87% and 87%, 56% and 35% for atypical carcinoid, 27% and 9% for LCNEC, and 9% and 5% for SCLC, respectively [59] . By light microscopy, these tumors display NE architectural features including organoid nesting, a trabecular arrangement, rosette formation, and palisading. These patterns are more prominent in carcinoids than in LCNECs and may or may not be visible in individual SCLCs. Typical carcinoids contain fewer than 2 mitoses per 2 mm 2 (10 HPF) and lack necrosis ( Figure 18 .16), while atypical carcinoids show 2-10 mitoses per 2 mm 2 (10 HPF) or necrosis, which is often punctate [60] . SCLC consists of small, undifferentiated tumor cells with scant cytoplasm and finely granular chromatin and absent or inconspicuous nucleoli ( Figure 18 .17). Nuclear molding is characteristic, necrosis is common, and the mitotic rate is typically high, with a mean of over 60 mitoses per 2 mm 2 [61] . Combined Differences also exist in the characteristics of patients with carcinoids, as compared to patients with SCLC and LCNEC. Patients with carcinoids are typically younger and less likely to smoke than those with SCLCs and LCNECs, the vast majority of whom have a current or previous history of tobacco smoking [62, 63] . Rare patients with carcinoids have the multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 (MEN1) syndrome, an association that is not seen with SCLCs and LCNECs. In addition, an association with diffuse idiopathic pulmonary neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia (DIPNECH) has been noted for carcinoids but not for SCLCs and LCNECs, leading to classification of DIPNECH as a preinvasive lesion in the most recent version of the WHO classification scheme [64] . DIPNECH is a diffuse proliferation of single cells, small nodules (NE bodies), and linear proliferations of pulmonary NE cells that may reside in the bronchial and/or bronchiolar epithelia ( Figure 18 . 19) , and may be accompanied by extraluminal proliferations Part IV Molecular Pathology of Human Disease (tumorlets and carcinoids) [64] . However, morphologically identifiable precursor lesions for SCLC and LCNEC have not been established.",

More than 90% of SCLCs and SqCCs demonstrate large, often discontinuous segments of allelic loss on chromosome 3p, in areas encompassing multiple candidate tumor suppressor genes, including some of those listed previously [15, 75] . Atypical carcinoids show a higher frequency of LOH at 3p, 13q, 9p21, and 17p than typical carcinoids, but not as high as the high-grade NE tumors [77] . Some typical and atypical carcinoids possess mutations of the multiple endocrine neoplasia 1 (MEN1) gene on chromosome 11q13 or LOH at this locus [78] , while these abnormalities occur with lower frequencies in SCLCs and LCNECs, supporting separate pathways of tumorigenesis [79] . MEN1 encodes for the nuclear protein menin, which is believed to play several roles in tumorigenesis by linking transcription factor function to histone-modification pathways, in part through interacting with the activator-protein-1 family transcription factor JunD, modifying it from an oncoprotein into a tumor suppressor protein [80] . Oncogenes frequently amplified in SCLCs include MYC (8q24), MYCN (2p24), and MYCL1 (1p34), and additional amplified genes that represent candidate oncogenes include the antiapoptotic genes TNFRSF4 (1p36), DAD1 (14q11), BCL2L1 (20q11), and BCL2L2 (14q11) [76] . The Myc proteins are transcription factors that are important in cell cycle regulation, proliferation, and DNA synthesis, and can induce p14 ARF , leading to apoptosis through p53 if cellular conditions do not favor proliferation [21] .",

Most of the TP53 mutations in SCLCs are missense point mutations that result in a stabilized p53 mutant protein which can be easily detected by immunohistochemistry [71] . p53 protein overexpression occurs frequently in high-grade NE carcinomas, but is unusual in typical carcinoids and intermediate in atypical carcinoids [82, 83] . Dysregulation of p53 produces downstream effects on Bcl-2 and Bax. Antiapoptotic Bcl-2 predominates over proapoptotic Bax in the high-grade NE carcinomas, while the reverse is true for carcinoids [82] . LCNECs resemble SCLCs in their high rates of TP53 mutation and predominance of Bcl-2 expression over Bax expression [84] .",

Mutations in the RB1 gene exist in many SCLCs, with associated loss of function of the gene product [71, 74, 85] . In another study, 89% of the NE carcinomas (excluding carcinoids) versus 13% of the non-NE carcinomas exhibited LOH and loss of Rb-protein expression [86] . The hypophosphorylated form of Rb protein functions as a cell cycle regulator for G1 arrest; cyclin D1 overexpression and P16 INK4a loss produce persistent hyperphosphorylation of Rb with consequent evasion of cell cycle arrest [23] . Recent data also suggest that in SCLCs, overexpression of MDM2 (a transcriptional target of p53) or p14 ARF loss leads to evasion of cell cycle arrest through the p53 and Rb pathway ( Figure 18 .2) [71] .",

The incidence of this tumor in the United States peaked in the early to mid-1990s, and appears to be declining, likely related to decreases in the use of amphiboles since their peak period of importation in the 1960s [107] . These tumors are characterized by long latency periods between asbestos exposure and clinical presentation of the tumor, with a mean of 30-40 years [108] . Radiation, a nonasbestos fiber known as erionite, and potentially other processes associated with pleural scarring have also been implicated in the causation of smaller numbers of cases of malignant mesothelioma [108] , and a role for Simian virus 40 (SV40) in the genesis of this tumor has been suggested by some, but remains controversial [109, 110] .",

Lymph node metastasis can cause superior vena caval obstruction, and cardiac tamponade, subcutaneous nodules, and contralateral lung involvement can also occur. From the time of diagnosis, the median survival is 12 months [110] . Treatment may include surgery, chemotherapy, radiotherapy, immunotherapy, or other treatments, often in combination [110] . The intent of surgery is usually palliative. Whether extrapleural pneumonectomy with chemotherapy and radiotherapy can lead to cure is unclear [111] .

These cells most often form sheets, tubulopapillary structures, or gland-like arrangements, and some tumors can have a myxoid appearance due to production of large amounts of hyaluronate. Sarcomatoid mesothelioma is composed of malignant-appearing spindle cells occasionally accompanied by mature sarcomatous components (osteosarcoma, chondrosarcoma, others). Desmoplastic mesothelioma can be a diagnostic challenge due to its frequently bland appearance and resemblance to organizing pleuritis.

Electron microscopy can also be helpful in difficult cases by demonstrating long thin microvilli in many MMs with an epithelioid component. Pan-cytokeratin staining is helpful for supporting a diagnosis of sarcomatoid or desmoplastic MM as opposed to sarcoma, since most (but not all) sarcomas will not stain for pan-cytokeratin.

            "text": "Exposure to asbestos fibers is believed to trigger the pathobiological changes leading to the majority of MMs. Currently, it is believed that asbestos may act as an initiator (genetically) and promoter (epigenetically) in the development of MMs [113] . The degree to which tumorigenesis results from direct interactions of the fibers with the mesothelial cells, or through other mechanisms involving oxidative stress (or both), is unresolved [113, 114] . Multiple chromosomal alterations are often noted in MMs, and inactivation of TSGs plays an important part in the pathogenesis of MM [113] . A variety of genetic abnormalities have been reported including deletions of 1p21-22, 3p21, 4p, 4q, 6q, 9p21, 13q13-14, 14q, and proximal 15q, monosomy 22, and gains of 1q, 5p, 7p, 8q22-24, and 15q22- Part IV Molecular Pathology of Human Disease 25 [108, 115] . The most common genetic abnormality in MM is a deletion in 9p21 encompassing the CDKN2A locus encoding the tumor suppressors p16 INK4a and p14 ARF , which participate in the p53 and Rb pathways and inhibit cell cycle progression ( Figure 18 .2) [113, 116] . Recent studies have shown that SV40 large T antigen (present in some MMs) inactivates the TSG products Rb and p53, raising the possibility that asbestos and SV40 could act as co-carcinogens in MM and suggesting that perturbations of Rb-and p53-dependent growth-regulatory pathways may be involved in the pathogenesis of MM [115] . Other common findings include inactivating mutations with allelic loss in the TSG neurofibromin 2 (NF2), found at chromosome 22q12 [117] , and inactivation of CDKN2A/p14 ARF and GPC3 (another TSG) by promoter methylation [108] . Loss of CDKN2A/ p14 ARF also results in MDM2-mediated inactivation of p53 [116] . However, in MMs, unlike many other epithelial tumors, mutations in the TP53, RB, and RAS genes are rare [118] .",

Activation of the pathway leads to accumulation of b-catenin in the cytoplasm and its translocation to the nucleus. Interactions with TCF/ LEF transcription factors promote expression of multiple genes including c-myc and Cyclin D. The mechanism of activation does not appear to involve mutations in the b-catenin gene, but may instead involve more upstream components of the pathway, such as the disheveled proteins [119] . Recent evidence also suggests that the phosphatidylinositol 3-kinase (PI3-K/AKT) pathway is frequently activated in MMs, and that inhibition of this pathway can increase sensitivity to a chemotherapeutic agent [120] . The Wilms' tumor gene (WT1) is also expressed in most MMs, but its role in the pathogenesis of MM is unclear [114] . Finally, EGFR signaling in MMs has recently become a focus of greater attention, and there are some data showing that the EGFR is an early cell membrane target of asbestos fibers and is linked to activation of the MAPK cascade [113] . Unfortunately, a Phase II clinical trial of gefitinib treatment in patients with MMs did not show effectiveness, despite EGFR overexpression in over 97% of cases [121] . Another study found that common EGFR mutations conferring sensitivity to gefitinib are not prevalent in human malignant mesothelioma [122] . Further investigation continues into new, potentially efficacious agents for the treatment of MM.",

The prevalence of disabling asthma has increased over 200% since 1969, ranging from as low as 1% in rural Ethiopia to over 20% among children in parts of Central and South America [123] . In the United States, asthma affects approximately 8%-10% of the population and is the leading cause of hospitalization among children less than 15 years of age [123] . Clinically, the disease is defined as a generalized obstruction of airflow with a reversibility that can occur spontaneously or with therapy. It is characterized by recurrent wheezing, cough, or shortness of breath resulting from airway hyperactivity and mucus hypersecretion. The hyperresponsiveness is a result of acute bronchospasm and can be elicited for diagnostic purposes using histamine or methacholine challenges. The key feature of these symptoms is that they are variable-worse at night or in the early morning, and in some people worse after exercise. It has previously been assumed that these symptoms are separated by intervals of normal physiology. However, evidence is now accumulating that asthma can cause progressive lung impairment due to chronic morphologic changes in the airways. The treatment strategies for this complex disease are myriad. In atopic individuals, allergen avoidance should be the primary therapy. For example, in children, reducing exposure to house dust mites early in life decreases sensitization and the incidence of disease. For those who do develop the disease, avoidance of allergens later in life improves symptom control. Established treatments for asthma flairs include inhaled corticosteroids, and short-acting and long-acting b2-adrenoceptor agonists. Phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitors such as theophylline have been used for decades to treat asthmatic bronchoconstriction, but both cardiac and central nervous systems side effects have limited their use. Newer PDE inhibitors without side effects include non-xanthine drugs such as rofumilast.",

In the wall of the airway, smooth muscle hypertrophy and submucosal gland hyperplasia are also present ( Figure 18 .27). In acute asthma exacerbations, a transmural chronic inflammatory infiltrate with variable amounts of eosinophilia may be present, resulting in epithelial injury and desquamation that can become quite pronounced. One sees clumps of degenerating epithelial cells mixed with mucin in the lumen airway. These aggregates of degenerating cells are referred to as Creola bodies and can be seen in expectorated mucin from these patients. Also present in these sputum samples are Charcot-Leyden crystals, rhomboid-shaped structures that represent breakdown products from eosinophil cytoplasmic granules ( Figure 18 .28). The changes seen in the walls of these airways represent long-term airway remodeling caused by prolonged inflammation. This remodeling may play a role in the pathophysiology of asthma. The amount of airway remodeling is highly variable from patient to patient, but remodeling has been found even in patients with mild asthma. Currently, the effect of the treatment on this chronic pathology is unclear [124] .",

Most commonly, asthma is divided into two categories: atopic (allergic) and nonatopic (nonallergic). Atopic asthma results from an allergic sensitization usually early in life and has its onset in early childhood. Nonatopic asthma is late-onset and, though the immunopathology has not been as well studied, probably has similar mechanisms to atopic asthma.

First, they release a variety of cytokines such as IL-4, IL-5, and IL-13 that mediate a wide variety of responses. IL-4 and IL-13 stimulate B-cells and plasma cells to produce IgE, which, in turn, stimulates mast cell maturation and the release of multiple mediators, including histamine and leukotrienes. Second, these Th2 cells secrete IL-5 that, together with IL-4, also stimulates mast cells to secrete histamine, tryptase, chymase, and the cysteinyl leukotrienes causing the bronchoconstrictor response that occurs rapidly after the exposure to the allergen. IL-5 from these lymphocytes also recruits eosinophils to the airways and stimulates the release of the contents of their granules, including eosinophil cationic protein (ECP), major basic protein (MBP), eosinophil peroxidase, and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin.

The number of eosinophils in the airways correlates with the severity of asthma and the amount of bronchial hyperresponsiveness. Proteins released by these cells including ECP, MCP, and eosinophil-derived neurotoxin cause at least some of the epithelial damage seen in the active form of asthma. Neutrophils are prominent in the more acute exacerbations of asthma and are probably recruited to these airways by IL-8, a potent neutrophil chemoattractant released by airway epithelial cells [123] . These cells also release proteases, reactive oxygen species (ROS), and other proinflammatory mediators that, in addition to the epithelial damage, also contribute to the airway destruction and remodeling that occurs in the more chronic forms of this disease. The susceptibility of the epithelium in asthma to this oxidant injury may be increased due to decreased antioxidants such as superoxide dismutase in these lungs [129] . Finally, mast cells are activated to release an abundance of mediators through the binding of IgE to FceRI, high-affinity receptors on their surface. Allergens bind to IgE molecules and induce a cross-linking of these molecules, leading to activation of the mast cell and release of a number of mediators, most notably histamine, tryptase, and various leukotrienes, including leukotriene D 4 (LTD 4 ), and interact with the smooth muscle to induce contraction and the acute bronchospastic response [130] .",

Although cholinergic pathways are responsible for maintaining the airway smooth muscle tone, it is the NANC system that releases bronchoactive tachykinins (substance P and neurokinin A) that bind to NK2 receptors on the smooth muscle and cause the constriction that characterizes the acute asthmatic response [123] .",

Though there are different forms of COPD with different etiologies, the clinical manifestations of the most common forms of the disease are the same. These include a progressive decline in lung function, usually measured as decreased forced expiratory flow in 1 second (FEV1), a chronic cough, and dyspnea. Emphysema and chronic bronchitis are the most common diseases of COPD and are the result of cigarette smoking. As such, they usually exist together in most smokers. Chronic bronchitis is defined clinically as a persistent cough with sputum production for at least 3 months in at least 2 consecutive years without any other identifiable cause. Patients with chronic bronchitis typically have copious sputum with a prominent cough, more commonly get infections, and typically experience hypercapnia and severe hypoxemia, giving rise to the clinical moniker blue bloater. Emphysema is the destruction and permanent enlargement of the air spaces distal to the terminal bronchioles without obvious fibrosis [133] . These patients have only a slight cough, while the overinflation of the lungs is severe, inspiring the term pink puffers.",

The first two of these are responsible for the overwhelming majority of the clinical disease. Centriacinar emphysema (sometimes referred to as centrilobular) represents 95% of the cases and is a result of destruction of alveoli at the proximal and central areas of the pulmonary acinus, including the respiratory bronchioles ( Figure 18 .30). It predominantly affects the upper lobes The remaining two types of emphysema, paraseptal and irregular, are rarely associated with clinical disease. In paraseptal emphysema, the damage is to the distal acinus, the area that abuts the pleura at the margins of the lobules. Damage in this area may cause spontaneous pneumothoraces, typically in young, thin men [136] . Irregular emphysema is tissue destruction and alveolar enlargement that occurs adjacent to scarring, secondary to the enhanced inflammation in the area. Though this is a common finding in a scarred lung, it is of little if any clinical significance to the patient.",

The main theories of the pathogenesis of COPD support the interaction of airway inflammation with two main systems in the lung: the protease-antiprotease system and the oxidant-antioxidant system. These systems help to protect the lung from the many irritants that enter the lung via the large pulmonary surface area that interfaces with the environment. In the protease-antiprotease system, proteases are produced by a number of cells, including epithelial cells and inflammatory cells that degrade the underlying lung matrix. The most important proteases in the lung are the neutrophil elastases, part of the serine protease family, and the metalloproteinases (MMPs) produced predominantly by macrophages. These proteases can be secreted in response to invasion by environmental irritants, most notably infectious agents such as bacteria.",

To protect the lung from unwanted destruction by these enzymes, the liver secretes antiproteases that circulate in the bloodstream to the lung and inhibit the action of the proteases. In addition, macrophages that secrete MMPs also secrete tissue inhibitors of metalloproteinases (TIMPs). A delicate balance of proteases and antiproteases is needed to maintain the integrity of the lung structure.

The affected gene is the SERPINA1 gene (formerly known as P1), located on the long arm of chromosome 14 (14q31-32.3). The genetic mutations that occur have been categorized into four groups: base substitution, in-frame deletions, frame-shift mutations, and exon deletions. These mutations usually result in misfolding, polymerization, and retention of the aberrant protein within the hepatocytes, leading to decreased circulating levels. aAT deficiency is an autosomal codominant disease with over 100 allelic variants, of which the M alleles (M1-M6) are the most common; these alleles produce normal serum levels of a lessactive protein [139] . Individuals who manifest the lung disease are usually homozygous for the alleles Z or S (ZZ and SS phenotype) or heterozygous for the 2 M alleles (MZ, or SZ phenotype) [139] . An aAT concentration in plasma of less than 40% of normal confers a risk for emphysema [140] . In individuals with the ZZ genotype, the activity of aAT is approximately one-fifth of normal [141] .",

As in the protease system, the lung is protected from oxidative stress in the form of ROS by antioxidants produced by cells in the lung. ROS in the lung include oxygen ions, free radicals, and peroxides. The major antioxidants in the airways are enzymes including catalase, superoxide dismutase (SOD), glutathione peroxidase, glutathione S-transferase, xanthine oxidase, and thioredoxin, as well as nonenzymatic antioxidants including glutathione, ascorbate, urate, and bilirubin [142] . The balance of oxidants and antioxidants in the lung prevents damage by ROS. However, cigarette smoke increases the production of ROS by neutrophils, eosinophils, macrophages, and epithelial cells [143] . Evidence that damage to the lung epithelium and matrix is a direct result of ROS includes the presence of exhaled H 2 O 2 and 8-isoprostane, decreased plasma antioxidants, and increased plasma and tissue levels of oxidized proteins, including various lipid peroxidation products. In addition to this direct effect, ROS may also induce a proinflammatory response that recruits more inflammatory cells to the lung. In animal models, cigarette smoke induces the expression of proinflammatory cytokines such as IL-6, IL-8, TNFa, and IL-1 from macrophages, epithelial cells, and fibroblasts, perhaps through activation of the transcription factor NFkB [144, 145] (Figure 18.34) . Finally, there is some evidence that cigarette smoke further disturbs the oxidant-antioxidant balance in the lung by depleting antioxidants such as ascorbate and glutathione [132] .",

These infections usually occur because airway secretions and entrapped organisms cannot be effectively cleared. This pathology dictates the clinical features of the disease, which include chronic cough with copious secretions and a history of recurrent pneumonia. The five major causes of bronchiectasis are infection, obstruction, impaired mucociliary defenses, impaired systemic immune defenses, and congenital. These may produce either a localized or diffuse form of the disease. Localized bronchiectasis is usually due to obstruction of airways by mass lesions or scars from previous injury or infection. Diffuse bronchiectasis can result from defects in systemic immune defenses in which either innate or adaptive immunity may be impaired. Diseases due to the former include chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), and diseases due to the latter include agammaglobulinemia/hypogammaglobulinemia and severe combined immune deficiencies. Defects in the mucociliary defense mechanism that is responsible for physically clearing organisms from the lung may also cause diffuse bronchiectasis. These include ciliary dyskinesias that result in cilia with aberrant ultrastructure and cystic fibrosis (CF). Congenital forms of bronchiectasis are rare but do exist. The most common include Mounier-Kuhn's syndrome and Williams-Campbell syndrome, the former causing enlargement of the trachea and major bronchi due to loss of bronchial cartilage, and the latter causing diffuse bronchiectasis of the major airways probably due to a genetic defect in the connective tissue [146, 147] .",

            "text": "The pathogenetic mechanism of bronchiectasis is complex and depends on the underlying etiology. In general, the initial damage to the bronchial epithelium is due to aberrant mucin (cystic fibrosis), dysfunctional cilia (ciliary dyskinesias), and ineffective immune surveillance (defects in innate and antibody-mediated immunity), leading to a cycle of tissue injury, repair, and remodeling that ultimately destroys the normal airway. The initial event in this cycle usually involves dysfunction of the mucociliary mechanism that inhibits the expulsion from the lungs of organisms and other foreign substances that invade the airways. This may be due to defects in the cilia or the mucin. Ciliary defects are found in primary ciliary dyskinesia, a genetically heterogeneous disorder, usually inherited as an autosomal recessive trait that produces immotile cilia with clinical manifestations in the lungs, sinuses, middle ear, male fertility, and organ lateralization [148] . Over 250 proteins make up the axoneme of the cilia, but mutations in 2 genes, DNAI1 and DNAH5, which encode for proteins in the outer dynein arms, most frequently cause this disorder [149] . In CF the main defect affects the mucin. In patients with this autosomal recessive condition, there is a low volume of airway surface liquid (ASL) causing sticky mucin that inhibits normal ciliary motion and effective mucociliary clearance of organisms. This is due to a defect in the cystic fibrosis transmembrane conductance regulator (CFTR) gene, located on chromosome 7 that encodes a cAMP-activated channel which regulates the flow of chloride ions in and out of cells and intracellular vacuoles, helping to maintain the osmolality of the mucin. This protein is present predominantly on the apical membrane of the airway epithelial cells, though it is also involved in considerable subapical, intracellular trafficking and recycling during the course of its maturation within these cells. This genetic disease manifests in multiple other organs that depend on chloride ion transport to maintain normal secretions, including the pancreas, intestine, liver, reproductive organs, and sweat glands [150] .",

These mutations are grouped into five classes according to their functional deficit: Group I, CFTR is not synthesized; Group II, CFTR is inadequately processed; Group III, CFTR is not regulated; Group IV, CFTR shows abnormal conductance; Group V, CFTR has partially defective production or processing. Approximately 70% of CF patients are in Group II and have the same mutation, F508D CFTR, a deletion of phenylalanine at codon 508 [154] . In these patients, most of the CFTR protein is misfolded and undergoes premature degradation within the endoplasmic reticulum, though a small amount of the CFTR protein is present on the apical membrane and does function normally. CF patients may have a combination of genetic mutations from any of the five groups.

The first category consists of a number of genetic diseases that cause either agammaglobulinemia or hypogammaglobulinemia. These include Xlinked agammaglobulinemia (XLA) and common variable immunodeficiency (CVI). XLA is caused by a mutation of the Bruton's tyrosine kinase (BTK) gene that results in the virtual absence of all immunoglobulin isotypes and of circulating B lymphocytes. In CVI there is a marked reduction in IgG and IgA and/or IgM, associated with defective antibody response to protein and polysaccharide antigens. As expected, both of these diseases increase susceptibility to infections from encapsulated bacteria. The second category of immune deficiency is hyper-IgE syndrome, a disease with markedly elevated serum IgE levels that is characterized by recurrent staphylococcal infections. The third category is chronic granulomatous disease (CGD), a genetically heterogeneous group of disorders that have a defective phagocytic respiratory burst and superoxide production, inhibiting the ability to kill Staphylococcus spp. and fungi such as Aspergillus spp. Finally, severe combined immune deficiency (SCID) comprises a group of disorders with abnormal T-cell development and B-cell and/or natural killer cell maturation and function, predisposing these patients to Pneumocystis jiroveci and viral infections [152] .",

For example, Pseudomonas aeruginosa, changes from a nonmucoid to a mucoid variant and also releases virulence factors to protect against phagocytosis [153] . Second, in the case of cystic fibrosis, neutrophils are directly recruited by proinflammatory cytokines, such as interleukin-8 (IL-8), released from the bronchial epithelial cells as a result of the defective CGFT protein [154] .

The best known and most prevalent entity of the IIPs is idiopathic pulmonary fibrosis (IPF), which is known pathologically as usual interstitial pneumonia (UIP). UIP is a histologic pattern characterized by patchy areas of chronic lymphocytic inflammation with organizing and collagenous type fibrosis. These patients usually present with gradually increasing shortness of breath and a nonproductive cough after having had symptoms for many months or even years. Imaging studies usually reveal bilateral, basilar disease with a reticular pattern [155] . Therapy begins with corticosteroids, advancing to more cytotoxic drugs such as methotrexate and cytoxan, but most current therapies are not effective in stopping the progression of the disease.

The progression from inflammation to fibrosis includes interstitial widening, epithelial injury and sloughing, fibroblastic infiltration, and organizing fibrosis within the characteristic fibroblastic foci. Deposition of collagen by fibroblasts occurs in the latter stages of repair. The presence of the abundant collagen produces stiff lungs that are unable to clear the airway secretions, leading to recurrent inflammation of the bronchiolar epithelium with eventual fibrosis and breakdown of the airway structure.

Early theories favored a primary inflammatory process, while current theories favor the concept that the fibrosis of the lung proceeds independently of inflammatory events and develops from aberrant epithelial and epithelial-mesenchymal responses to injury to the alveolar epithelial cells (AECs) [161] . The AECs consist of two populations: the type 1 pneumocytes and the type 2 pneumocytes. In normal lungs, type 1 pneumocytes line 95% of the alveolar wall, and type 2 pneumocytes line the remaining 5%. However, in lung injury, the type 1 cells, which are exquisitely fragile, undergo cell death, and the type 2 pneumocytes serve as progenitor cells to regenerate the alveolar epithelium [162] . Though some studies have suggested that repopulation of the type 2 cells depends on circulating stem cells, this concept remains to be fully proven. According to current concepts, the injury and/or apoptosis of the AECs initiates a cascade of cellular events that produce the scarring in these lungs. Studies of AECs in lungs from patients with IPF have shown ultrastructural evidence of cell injury and apoptosis as well as expression of proapoptotic proteins. Further, inhibition of this apoptosis by blocking a variety of proapoptotic mechanisms such the Fas-Fas ligand pathway, angiotensin, and TNFa production, and caspase activation can stop the progression of this fibrosis [163] .",

DAD is divided into three major phases that follow each other chronologically after the original insult. These are exudative, proliferative, and fibrotic DAD. The initial injury primarily involves the epithelium of the alveolar wall and the endothelium in the capillary, causing the destruction and sloughing of the type 1 pneumocytes into the alveolar space and a breakdown of the tight junctions of the endothelium. In combination, these two events result in the loss of the epithelial-endothelial barrier of the alveolus and leakage of plasma from the capillary into the alveolar space. This flooding of the airspace with fluid markedly decreases oxygen exchange and causes the hypoxia that these patients experience. In addition, acute inflammatory changes of the endothelium also cause thrombi to form in vessels, adding to a decreased amount of blood circulating through the lung and further compromising gas exchange. As air is brought into the alveoli, the positive pressure within the alveolar space forces the plasma against the alveolar wall, producing a membranous morphology referred to as hyalin membranes characteristic of the first phase of DAD, referred to as exudative DAD (Figure 18.38) .",

First, type 2 pneumocytes undergo hyperplasia and re-epithelialize the alveolar wall after the loss of the type 1 cells. This re-establishes the epithelial barrier and, because these cells secrete surfactant, results in increased surfactant production, which lowers the surface tension of the alveolus and inhibits its collapse. Because of the increased numbers of type 2 pneumocytes, this is known as the proliferative phase of DAD (Figure 18.38) . In the final phase of DAD, fibrotic DAD, fibroblasts migrate in from the adjacent interstitium to the alveolar space and produce organizing and irreversible fibrosis within both the alveolar space and the interstitium. In addition to this mechanism, fibrosis may also occur in those areas where alveolar walls collapse when surfactant is decreased during the initial insult. The histopathologic picture during this fibrotic phase is one of thickened alveolar septa, intra-alveolar granulation tissue, microcyst formation, and areas of irregular alveolar scarring. In rare cases, these microcysts progress to large cysts, an adult equivalent of bronchopulmonary dysplasia.",

In the first, a large influx of neutrophils and plasma enter the alveolar space. The role the neutrophils play in the initial cellular injury and death is unclear, but it is known that they are necessary for this injury to occur. In addition, clinical studies have shown that within the peripheral blood and bronchoalveolar lavages (BAL) of these patients, neutrophils are present along with a myriad of proinflammatory cytokines, such as IL-8, IL-1, and TGFa, all of which are capable of recruiting them to the lung. Also present in these fluids are mediators that recruit fibroblasts such as TGFb. All of these mediators are probably the result of upregulation of NFkB, a proinflammatory transcription factor, in alveolar macrophages. The adherence of neutrophils to the capillary endothelium in the lung occurs through adhesion molecules such as selectin, integrin, and immunoglobulins. Neutrophil adherence and subsequent transmigration through the endothelium of the lung capillaries may cause some endothelial damage. However, most speculate that ROS and reactive nitrogen Chapter 18 Molecular Basis of Pulmonary Disease species (RNS) secreted by the neutrophils modulate the majority of this injury [169] . This is supported by the finding that patients with ARDS have products of oxidative damage such as hydrogen peroxide (H 2 O 2 ) in the exhaled breath and myeloperoxidase and oxidized aAT in the BAL.",

These cells are the same in both S-LAM and TSC-LAM Part IV Molecular Pathology of Human Disease and are a clonal population although they lack other features of malignancy [178] . Molecular studies reveal that the abnormal LAM cell proliferation is caused by mutations in one of two genes linked to tuberous sclerosis: tuberous sclerosis complex 1 or 2 (TSC1 or TSC2). These two genes control cell growth and differentiation through the Akt/mammalian target of rapamycin (mTOR) signaling pathway [172] . In this pathway, a growth factor receptor (such as insulin or PDGF receptors) becomes phosphorylated when an appropriate ligand binds, resulting in activation of downstream effectors and ultimately Akt. The gene products of TSC1 and TSC2 are hamartin and tuberin, which act as dimers to maintain Rheb (a member of the Ras family) in a GDP-loaded state via statins, acting as a break to the Akt/mTOR pathway, thereby retarding protein synthesis and cell growth. In LAM cells, loss-of-function mutations in these two genes remove this inhibition, leading to enhanced Rheb activation, mTOR activation (with raptor), and subsequent phosphorylation of downstream molecules which result in uncontrolled cell growth, angiogenesis, and damage to the lung tissue ( Figure 18 .41) [179] .",

The most common finding on chest imaging studies is bilateral hilar lymph node enlargement and reticular, reticulonodular, and focal alveolar opacities within the lung parenchyma [182] .",

Unlike infectious granulomas that usually contain areas of central necrosis, the granulomas in pulmonary sarcoidosis are predominantly non-necrotizing [184] . Also, the granulomas in sarcoidosis follow a distribution along the lymphatics, which includes the area in the subpleural, along the interlobular septae and around the bronchovascular area containing the bronchiole and branch of the pulmonary artery (Figure 18 .42). The granulomas occur much more commonly in the upper lobes, leading to the predominant upper lobe fibrosis and bronchiectasis that can be seen in longstanding sarcoidosis [185] .",

A genetic basis of sarcoidosis has been suggested by studies that demonstrate familial clustering and racial variation [188, 189] . Further, complex inheritance patterns for the disease suggest that more than one gene may be involved [190] . Several genes of the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) region of the genome have been implicated. Most are clustered on the short arm of chromosome 6 that encompasses the human leukocyte antigen (HLA) domain. The HLA class I MHC molecules associated with sarcoidosis are the HLA-B7 and HLA-B8 class I alleles [191, 192] . HLA Class II molecules implicated in susceptibility include the HLA-DR alleles [193, 194] . Genes other than MHC genes thought to regulate the susceptibility to sarcoidosis include those for chemokines such as macrophage inflammatory protein-1a and RANTES (CCR5 and CCR3) [195, 196] .",

The clinical presentation is variable and usually includes an insidious onset of slowly progressive dyspnea, a dry cough, and other symptoms of respiratory distress, including fatigue and clubbing. However, almost one-third of patients are asymptomatic and are found clinically by abnormal chest X-rays [205, 206] . The secondary form of PAP can be found in patients with environmental exposures, including fine silica, aluminum, titanium dioxide, and kaolin dust [206] .

Subsequent studies from humans with PAP revealed an autoimmune mechanism by which a circulating neutralizing antibody to GM-CSF blocked its binding to the GM-CSF receptor, depressing the effect of GM-CSF on the AMs [217] [218] [219] .

PPARg controls the expression of genes involved in intracellular lipid metabolism. AMs from patients with PAP have a deficiency of this transcription factor, which is correctable by GM-CSF therapy [223] . Overall, the lack of GM-CSF-initiated signaling in AMs from patients with PAP leads to inhibition of both PPARg and PU.1 pathways.

The classification of these diseases has undergone a number of revisions. The most recent revision (in 2003) groups these diseases based on both their pathologic and clinical characteristics [224] . There are five major disease categories in the current classification system: (i) pulmonary arterial hypertension (PAH); (ii) pulmonary hypertension with left heart disease; (iii) pulmonary hypertension associated with lung disease and/or hypoxemia; (iv) pulmonary hypertension due to chronic thrombotic and/or embolic disease; and (v) miscellaneous causes, including sarcoidosis, histiocytosis X, and lymphangioleiomyomatosis. The clinical course of most patients with pulmonary hypertension begins with exertional dyspnea, and progresses through chest pain, syncope, increased mean pulmonary artery pressures and, eventually, right heart failure. The rate of this clinical progression varies among patients, from a few months to many years [225] . Treatment of these diseases focuses on blocking the mediators involved in the pathogenesis of the diseases. However, current therapies rarely prevent progression of the disease, and lung transplantation provides the only hope for long-term survival.",

However, two other diseases in this group, pulmonary veno-occlusive disease and pulmonary capillary hemangiomatosis, involve predominantly other components of the pulmonary vasculature, the veins, and the capillaries, respectively. The pathologic changes seen in the pulmonary vessels of these patients primarily reflect injury to and repair of the endothelium. Early pathologic changes include medial hypertrophy and intimal fibrosis that narrows and obliterates the vessel lumen. These are followed by remodeling and revascularization, producing a proliferation of abnormal endothelial-lined spaces. These structures are known as plexogenic lesions and are the pathognomonic feature of PAH (Figure 18.45) . In the most severe pathologic lesions, these abnormal vascular structures become dilated or angiomatoid-like and may develop features of a necrotizing vasculitis with transmural inflammation and fibrinoid necrosis.",

            "text": "Though the exact pathogenetic mechanism of PAH remains unknown, research over the past 10 years has begun to offer some clues. The familial form of PAH, with a 2:1 female-to-male prevalence, has an autosomal dominance inheritance pattern with low penetrance. The genetic basis for this has been found to be germline mutations in the gene encoding the bone morphogenetic protein receptor type 2 (BMPR2). These mutations account for approximately 60%-70% of familial PAH and 10%-25% of patients with sporadic PAH [233] . Approximately 140 BMPR2 mutations have been identified in familial PAH, each resulting in a loss of receptor function, either through alteration in transcription of the gene through missense, nonsense, or frameshift alterations in the codon or by RNA spicing mistakes [226] . The mechanism by which a single mutation to the BMPR2 gene induces vascular smooth muscle proliferation and decreased apoptosis that is not completely understood, but it most likely involves defects in the BMPR2 signaling pathway. BMPR2 is a receptor for a family cytokines (BMPs) that are members of the TGFb superfamily of proteins that play a role in the growth and regulation of many cells, including those of the pulmonary vasculature. In the vascular smooth muscle cells of the lung, TGFb signaling causes a proliferation of smooth muscle in pulmonary arterioles, while BMPR2 signaling causes an inhibition of the proliferation of these cells, favoring an apoptotic environment. The BMPR2 signaling occurs through an activation of a receptor complex (BMPR1 and BMPR2) that leads to phosphorylation and activation of a number cytoplasmic mediators, most notably the Smad proteins (Mothers against decapentaplegic). These Smad proteins, especially the Smad 1, Smad 5, and Smad 8 complex with Smad 4, translocate to the nucleus where they target gene transcription that induces an antiproliferative effect in the cell. In familial PAH, the BMRPR2 gene mutation may lead to insufficient protein product and subsequent decreased protein function, in this case decreased BMPR2 receptor function, decreased Smad protein activation, and decreased antiproliferative effects in the vascular smooth muscle cells. The imbalance between the proproliferative effects of the TGFbs and the antiproliferative effects of the BMPs results in the formation of the vascular lesions of PAH (Figure 18 .46) [227, 228] .",

MPA and CSS are primarily diseases of MPO antibodies, and WG is primarily a disease of PR3 antibodies. The mechanism by which the ANCAs are induced is not known but may be part of an autoimmune response to environmental exposures early in life. These autoantibodies then inflict damage on the vessels through a mechanism that is not yet completely understood. One theory suggests that circulating ANCAs bind to PR3 and MPO on the surface of neutrophils and initiate a respiratory burst, degranulation, and apoptosis. ROS and proteases are released and inflict endothelial and tissue damage on the adjacent vessel. The ANCA binding may also induce the release of proinflammatory cytokines and chemokines such as IL-1 and TNFa that further contribute to the vascular inflammation. The second theory postulates that circulating immune complexes of excess ANCA antigen (MPO or PR3) and ANCA autoantibodies attach to the vascular endothelium and activate complement that results in the chemotaxis and adhesion of inflammatory cells, causing these cells to undergo a respiratory burst and, as in the first theory, release of ROS and proteases that cause the vascular endothelial damage. In both theories, it is important to remember that MPO and PR3 are also present in monocytes and that ANCA autoantibodies may be involved with monocytes in similar ways to release inflammatory mediators [231] .",

The bronchial epithelium contains cilia of up to 20 microns in length that extend into the air surface liquid (ASL). The ASL is a bilayer of 50-100 microns in thickness consisting of a low-viscosity or watery lower layer that is covered by a high-viscosity or gel upper layer secreted by adjacent goblet cells.

Though a common community pathogen, it is found twice as frequently in pneumonias in hospitalized patients. It often attacks the elderly and patients with CF and arises as a co-infection with influenza viral pneumonia. The clinical course is characterized by high fevers, chills, a cough with purulent bloody sputum, and rapidly progressing dyspnea. The gross pathology commonly reveals an acute bronchopneumonia pattern (Figure 18 .49) that may evolve into a necrotizing cavity with congested red/purple lungs and airways that contain a bloody fluid and thick mucoid secretions. The histologic pattern is characterized by a bronchopneumonia that spreads distally from the small airways into to the alveolar spaces (Figure 18 .50) to form abscesses that connect with the pleural surface and may result in empyemas. The treatment of this organism has become increasingly problematic due to antibioticresistant strains, most notably methicillin-resistant S. aureus. Legionella pneumophila Legionella are gram-negative bacilli found predominantly in aquatic habitats such as lakes, rivers, and ponds. Standing pools of water from humidifiers and other water outlets may be other sources. Approximately 50% of air conditioners contain these bacilli. Though 15 serogroups of Legionella have been identified, 3 cause the overwhelming majority of human pneumonia. The clinical disease takes two forms: (i) Legionnaires' disease, named after the outbreak of pneumonia at the 1976 American Legion convention in Philadelphia; and (ii) Pontiac fever, a self-limiting flu-like disease with nonspecific symptoms. Legionella pneumonia presents as a severe infection of the lung with chills and rigors with a nonproductive cough. It can progress rapidly to systemic symptoms of nausea, vomiting, and diarrhea and can lead to renal failure and death without immediate antibiotic therapy. The infected lungs are remarkably red and congested and appear to be distended with fluid. The microscopic picture reveals fibrinopurulent exudates that fill the alveolar space mixed with a necrotic, cellular infiltrate of degenerating neutrophils and monocytes (Figure 18 .51). Hyaline membranes may form in the periphery of the lesions, and pleural effusions consisting of fibrinoserous exudates are common.",

Pneumonias caused by this organism are usually found in intensive care units of hospitals and burn units, in patients with underlying chronic lung diseases including cystic fibrosis, emphysema, and in patients with prolonged hospitalization. The pathology is necrosis with a bronchopneumonia pattern that usually consists of an area of congestion and hemorrhage that is surrounded by a halo of tan/white consolidation (Figure 18.52) . A necrotizing vasculitis with abundant organisms in vessel walls can be seen, and cavitation is common ( Figure  18 .53).

Other Gram-Negative Bacilli Gram-negative bacilli such as Klebsiella pneumoniae, Acinetobacter, and various Enterobacteriaceae spp. are common nosocomial pathogens. Similar to P. aeruginosa, these pathogens colonize the oropharynx and are usually introduced into the lung by inhalation or aspiration of oral contents. The most notable of these is Friedlander's pneumonia caused by K. pneumoniae, the most common cause of gramnegative bacterial pneumonia. This typically occurs in men over 40 years of age, usually in the setting of alcoholism, diabetes mellitus, or chronic lung disease.

Those organisms thought to be pathogenic to the lung include The clinical presentation of these lung infections can vary from minimally symptomatic small lesions discovered by routine radiography to sudden hemoptysis from advanced disease with severe cavitation (Table 18 .5). The two most characteristic lesions are those of diffuse infiltrates in an immunocompromised patient, seen most commonly in the HIV-positive population and an Viruses Most pulmonary infections are due to viruses from four major groups: influenza, parainfluenza, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), and adenovirus (Table 18 .6) [241] . The clinical presentations of these infections have some common features, including insidious onset, nonproductive cough, fever, and chest pain. Chest imaging studies usually reveal bilateral, multifocal infiltrates, most without evidence of cavitation or pleural involvement. These infections are mild, self-limiting, and require no more than supportive therapy except in immunocompromised hosts, where the clinical course can be much more serious. Also, immunocompromised patients are susceptible to other viruses such as herpesvirus and cytomegalovirus pneumonias, which are not common pathogens in normal hosts [242] . Since the 1980s, a subset of pulmonary viral infections has emerged with a much more aggressive clinical course, most notably SARS, coronavirus, and Hantavirus. These viruses present with systemic symptoms of headache, myalgias, and weakness followed by a deteriorating clinical course with respiratory distress, shock and, in over 50% of the cases, death [243, 244] . Therapy for most respiratory viral infections is supportive, although antivirals are available for some viruses, mostly used in the setting of immunocompromised patients. Ribavirin, a guanosine analogue, is the main antiviral used for RSV; M2 inhibitors or adamantanes (amantadine and rimantadine) are used against influenza A and neuraminidase inhibitors (oseltamivir and zanamivir) are used against both influenza A and B [245] .

Approximately 75% of people have skin tests that are positive for exposure to H. capsulatum, but most exposures do not cause clinical disease. Disease typically occurs in people exposed to large amounts of organisms, such as construction workers who move large volumes of dirt or spelunkers who venture into bat-ridden caves. The acute disease has flu-like symptoms which are self-limiting. Healed disease may leave behind calcified granulomas in the lung that appear as buckshot on chest imaging studies.

They are weak pathogens that produce invasive infections predominantly in immunocompromised hosts or in those with significant chronic lung diseases. In tissue, aspergilli form septate hyphae, 3-6 microns in diameter, with characteristic acute-angle, dichotomous branching (Figure 18.62) . These organisms affect the lung in three major ways: (i) saprophytic growth in bronchi or pre-existent cavities; (ii) as an allergic or hypersensitivity reaction, predominantly in asthmatics; and (iii) invasive aspergillosis in immunocompromised hosts [249, 250] . As a saprophyte, aspergillus produces surface growths or minute masses of hyphae, usually in bronchiectatic cavities, emphysematous bullae, or scars from previous lung diseases such as tuberculosis or sarcoidosis. The pathology is usually that of a fibrous-walled cavity containing degenerating hyphae (Figure 18 .63). In this setting, hyphae do not invade into the lung tissue, but surface erosion of a vascularized cavity may cause hemoptysis. Aspergillus causes an immunologic response resulting in mucoid impaction or eosinophilic pneumonia in asthmatics, an entity known as allergic bronchopulmonary aspergillosis (ABPA). Pathologically, one sees mucoid plugs and superficial erosions of the airways with histiocytic inflammation, with only rare hyphal fragments present. The final form of the disease, invasive pulmonary aspergillosis, is found in severely immunocompromised, neutropenic patients. The hyphae, which disseminate through the blood, invade the blood vessels causing thrombosis, hemorrhage, and infarction to form typical targetoid lesions. This form of the disease has a poor prognosis despite aggressive antifungal therapy.",

The inability to culture Pneumocystis jiroveci has slowed the understanding of this organism. Animal models have helped in defining the antigenic and genotypic differences among the various Pneumocystis organisms, which has led to the proposal for species-specific strains, with P. jiroveci found in human infections [252] . The molecular methods used for the typing these species examine a number of gene loci. Most importantly, sequence analysis of the thymidylate synthase (TS) and superoxide dismutase (SODA) gene loci, the EPSP synthase domain of the multifunctional arom gene, and the mitochondrial small subunit ribosomal RNA (mtSSU rRNA) locus have been used to distinguish the various Pneumocystis species that infect different mammalian hosts [253] .",

The trophozoite form, which adheres to the type 1 epithelium, replicates and enlarges through three precyst stages before maturing into a cyst form that is found in the alveolar space. Sporozoites develop within immature cysts through meiosis and mitosis. The mature cyst contains eight haploid sporozoites.

The attachment of the organism to the lung epithelium is via glycoprotein A present on the surface of the organism. The binding of the organism to the type 1 cell occurs via surface receptors on the type 1 cell that include macrophage mannose receptors. These interact with glycoprotein A and activate pathways in the organism that induce genes encoding for pathways that induce mating and proliferation responses, and for the formation of pheromone receptors, transcription factors, and heterotrimeric G-protein subunits [263] . In addition to these genetic effects, the cyst wall contains chitins, polymers, and other substances, in particular, 1,3-glucan, that maintain its integrity and induce the inflammatory response of the host. The 1,3-glucan in the wall of the organism stimulates the release by the macrophages of reactive oxidant species and the generation of potent proinflammatory cytokines, such as TNFa, which bind to the organism and exert a toxic effect. Once inside the macrophage, the organism is incorporated into the phagolysosome and degraded. TNFa also directly recruits other inflammatory cells including neutrophils, lymphocytes, and circulating monocytes, and induces the release of IL-8 and IFN-g that recruit and activate inflammatory cells [255] . In aggregate, the recruitment of these inflammatory cells and the mediators they release is responsible for the damage to the lung epithelium and endothelium that is seen in this disease [255] .",

In this form of the disease, the organisms are abundant and the diagnosis can usually be made by bronchoalveolar lavage. Atypical pathologic variants include a necrotizing variant that has a pattern similar to the typical form with exudative alveolar infiltrates, but which undergoes necrosis and cavity formation. These cavities heal into fibrous-walled cysts, similar in gross appearance to those found in pseudomonas pneumonia. A third variant has wellformed granulomas involving the airways, a pattern common to histoplasmosis and tuberculosis. In this form, the organisms are rare and very difficult to find, even with tissue organismal stains.

Whether this more mature immune phenotype leads to an unregulated immune response and destruction of the bronchial epithelial cells is not known. However, some studies have shown that bronchiolar epithelial cells may induce the expression of this mature phenotype by secreting cytokines in response to environmental stimulants such as cigarette smoke or viral infections, or by the development of hyperplastic or dysplastic lesions that express new foreign antigens [265] .",

These histiocytes have abundant phagolysosomes and express the antigen CD1a and are consistent with a phagocytic cell, most likely closely related to alveolar macrophages. The peripheral monocytosis and the proinflammatory cytokine profile that is found in these patients might suggest that the histiocytic infiltrate is a result of systemic monocytic activation and invasion of circulating monocytes into the tissues throughout the body [275] . Recently, an ECD patient was successfully treated by an agent toxic to monocytes, supporting the theory that these cells play a part in the disease [275] . Alternatively, end organ cytokine production by local inflammatory cells resulting in proliferation and differentiation of resident immature histiocyte populations may produce a similar picture. Another interesting observation is that Erdheim-Chester has been reported to occur in patients with Langerhans' cell histiocytosis [276] , which may suggest that this is a disease where macrophages transition between two different phenotypes along the differentiation spectrum of tissue dendritic cells [276] .

In both diseases, it is known that other factors increase the risk of developing disease. For example, smokers exhibit worse disease than nonsmokers with similar exposures to asbestosis.

Once inside the cells, the fibers activate the release of ROS that can lead to cellular and molecular damage through a number of pathways. First, ROS can directly cause lipid peroxidation, membrane damage, and DNA damage. Second, silicainduced free radicals can trigger phosphorylation of cellular proliferation pathways through mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs), extracellular signal regulated kinases (ERKs), and p38. These pathways are also involved in the proliferation of fibroblasts in asbestosis and of mesothelial and epithelial cells in the neoplastic diseases associated with the inhalation of these fibers [279] . In addition, these fibers can activate proinflammatory pathways controlled by such transcription factors as nuclear NFkB and activator protein 1 (AP-1).

Two major transcription factors are responsible for the normal branching morphogenesis. The first, thyroid transcription factor-1 (TTF-1), is a member of the Nkx2.1 family of hemeodomain-containing transcription factors. This factor plays a role in the lung epithelial-specific gene expression and proper lung bud development in the embryonic stage, as well as in the maturation of the respiratory epithelium. The second major factor is somatic hedgehog (SHH)/Gli, expressed by endodermally derived cells and required for branching morphogenesis. The development of the lung bud from the foregut endoderm depends on the appropriate expression of these lung-specific genes at the correct time in development. In the presence of genetic defects, aberrant lung development may occur. For example, mutations of various types in the SHH/Gli gene have been found to cause tracheoesophageal fistulas, anomalous pulmonary vasculature, and aberrant airway branching. Also, deletions in the TTF-1 gene are associated with tracheoesophageal fistulas and a variety of forms of lung dysgenesis [284] . Finally, factors present in the surrounding mesenchyme play a role in inducing the proper development of the pulmonary endoderm. A prominent mesenchymal factor in this process is fibroblast growth factor (FGF), which modulates both the proximal and distal lung branching morphogenesis. Deletions in this gene may cause lung agenesis and tracheal malformations [284] .",

            "text": "Surfactant dysfunction disorders represent a heterogenous group of inherited disorders of surfactant metabolism, found predominantly in infants and children. Pulmonary surfactant includes both phospholipids and surfactant proteins, designated surfactant proteins A, B, C, and D (SP-A, SP-B, SP-C, SP-D), synthesized and secreted by type 2 cells beginning in the canalicular stage of lung development. Damage to type 2 cells during this time period can lead to acquired surfactant deficiencies. However, more commonly these deficiencies are the result of genetic defects of the surfactant proteins themselves.",

Defects in SFTPB and ABCA3 have an autosomal recessive inheritance pattern, and defects in SFTPC have an autosomal dominant pattern. SP-B deficiency is the most common. It presents at birth with a rapidly progressive respiratory failure and chest imaging studies showing diffuse ground glass infiltrates. The gross pathology in these lungs consists of heavy, red, and congested parenchyma with microscopic features that range from a PAP-like pattern to a chronic pneumonitis of infancy (CPI) pattern. In SP-B deficiency, the PAP pattern predominates with a histologic picture of cuboidal alveolar epithelium and eosinophilic PAS-positive material within the alveolar spaces that appears with disease progression. In the late stages of the disease, the alveolar wall thickens with a chronic inflammatory infiltrate and fibroblasts. This alveolar proteinosis-type pattern of injury can be confirmed with immunohistochemical studies that establish the absence of SP-B within this surfactant-like material. Diseases due to ABCA3 or SFTPC deficiency may present within a week of birth or years later; the former has a poor prognosis, but the latter has a more variable prognosis with some patients surviving into adulthood. Indeed, SP-C mutations have also been recognized in some families as a cause of interstitial pneumonia and pulmonary fibrosis in adults [285] . The pathology of SP-C deficiency has more CPI features and less proteinosis. In contrast, ABCA deficiency can have either PAP or CPI features, with the former present early in the disease and the latter present in more chronically affected lungs [286] .",

There are approximately 35 dominantly expressed mutations in SFTPC that result in acute and chronic lung disease. Approximately 55% of them arise spontaneously, and the remainder are inherited. The most common mutation is a threonine substitution for isoleucine in codon 73 (I73T), found in 25% of the cases, including both sporadic and inherited disease [287] . This mutation leads to a misfolding of the SP-C protein, which inhibits its progression through the intracellular secretory pathway, usually within the Golgi apparatus or the endoplasmic reticulum [288] . The absence of SP-C within the alveolar space causes severe lung disease in mouse models. Infants with documented mutated proSP-C protein, the larger primary translation product from which SP-C is proteolytically cleaved, can have respiratory distress syndrome (RDS) or CPI. In older individuals, pathologic patterns observed in the lungs with these mutations include nonspecific interstitial pneumonitis (NSIP) and UIP. In this affected adult population, the pathology and age of disease presentation vary even within familial cohorts, suggesting the involvement of a second hit, perhaps an environmental factor [289] .",

The presence of abnormal lamellar bodies within the type 2 cells by ultrastructural analysis suggests a disruption in the normal surfactant synthesis and packaging in this disease. There is some evidence that this gene contains promoters that share elements consistent with their activation by the transcription factors TTF-1 and Foxa7, and deletions in either or both of these genes may play a role in this disease [289] .",
