Recent trials suggest that primary percutaneous coronary angioplasty (PCI) offers some benefit over thrombolytic therapy, 3 but rapid access to primary PCI is limited in most parts of the world. Combinations of newer anti-platelet regimens 4 or direct thrombin inhibitors 5 have not yielded clear incremental benefit, but cause increased bleeding. Although heparin is commonly used after AMI, especially in patients receiving a fibrin-specific thrombolytic agent, and some trials of low-molecular-weight heparin (LMWH) appear promising, there is no convincing evidence that these agents reduce mortality in patients receiving thrombolytic therapy and aspirin (Tables I,  II , A and II, B). 6 -8,9 -12,13-18 Although LMWH reduces reinfarction, there appears to be no impact on mortality. Furthermore, there are significant increases in major bleeds and a trend towards more hemorrhagic strokes with both agents (Tables II, A and II, B) . Therefore, the net benefit-risk ratio is not clear. Fur-ther, some of the larger trials were not blinded, so one cannot exclude the potential for biases in the ascertainment of outcomes that involve judgement (eg, early reinfarction). The uncertainty about the net benefits and risks of LMWH is reflected in no clear recommendation for the use of thrombin inhibitors in AMI, especially in those receiving a thrombolytic agent that is not fibrin-specific. Although UFH is widely used after a fibrin-specific thrombolytic agent, this is based on improved coronary artery patency in 2 small trials, which did not have the power to reliably assess the impact on clinical outcomes such as death, reinfarction, bleeding, or strokes. Therefore, a large definitive trial of LMWH vs placebo, is urgently needed.",

Most of these trials antedate thrombolytic agents or aspirin, and some had incomplete follow-up or lack of information on the integrity of randomization. Although encouraging, a large definitive trial of GIK in the context of modern management of AMI is required. Despite the low costs of GIK and potential global applicability, a large trial of this question is yet to be done, perhaps because of a lack of commercial interest, and complex rules which hamper the conduct of large trials of academically-driven questions with little external funding.",

In addition, in India and China (CREATE), we simultaneously evaluated a LMWH, Reviparin, in about 15 000 subjects. Although the 2 trials were designed and initiated separately, given the substantial similarity of the GIK components, an early decision was made to merge and standardize the 2 trials to more reliably evaluate GIK. Below, we describe the design of this study, the base-line characteristics, and discuss the challenges faced in establishing this trial.",

The lack of external funding required that investigator meetings were generally attached to other meetings, although annual regional meetings were held in India and China. The centers in ECLA were not provided with any compensation and the centers in CREATE (India, China, and Pakistan) received modest compensation per patient to cover their visible costs. Despite this, over the last 2 years of the study, recruitment rates averaged 7000 patients per year. The National Coordinating Centers obtained national regulatory approvals and licences for drug imports. These processes were extremely bureaucratic and slow (9 -18 months in each country), and were chiefly designed to be done by pharmaceutical companies or independent contract research organizations (CRO) at considerable expense. A quote from a CRO in India for obtaining approval and monitoring the trial exceeded the entire cost of running the study in India (note that, in most countries, there is no streamlined and efficient mechanism to obtain regulatory approvals for studies conducted independent of industry). Several of the participating centers did not have institutional review boards (IRBs) or ethics committees, so national and independent IRBs had to be used.

Despite their enthusiasm and the relative simplicity of the study, some centers initially had problems with accurate completion of forms, complying with certain aspects of the study protocol, and maintaining careful documents. Therefore, we instituted a system of on-site monitoring and training which trained staff at sites in CREATE, and provided support. This improved protocol adherence and data quality considerably. For randomization in India, the study initially used sealed envelopes (due to lack of low-cost, reliable and accessible telephone lines 24 hours-a-day at all hospitals). Despite multiple safeguards, allocation errors occurred in a few patients. Therefore, despite higher costs, randomization was switched to a 24-hour central telephone system in Bangalore, India, which substantially reduced the allocation error rate. In China, 24hour central randomization was used throughout, and so few errors occurred. Given that the centers were compensated very modestly, the study was repeatedly threatened by the withdrawal of centers who wished to participate in \"competing\" trials, sponsored by pharmaceutical companies with higher rates of compensation. This substantially slowed recruitment into ECLA so that, instead of the original target of 10 000 patients over 3 years, only 4000 patients were randomized over 6 years. This was less of a problem in India and China, where only a few centers stopped randomizing by the end of 2003 to participate in other trials. Nevertheless, most centers had made important contributions to the trial. During 2003, the epidemic of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) in China adversely affected recruitment and several participating hospitals were closed down, or stopped admitting AMI patients.",

First, if important generic questions are incorporated into a very simple protocol, sufficient numbers of physicians are still willing and able to collaborate at little or no reimbursement. Second, the \"merger\" of CREATE and ECLA was possible because of long-standing previous collaboration between the investigators from the 2 groups, and a mutual commitment to sharing credit. This led to ensuring a statistically robust, reliable result regarding GIK, rather than the potential for an inconclusive result from the ECLA study alone. Third, the bureaucratic hurdles for conducting this trial in India and China were formidable and took between 9 -18 months to overcome, chiefly through the tenacity, determination and dedication of the National Coordinators in Beijing and Bangalore. Fourth, even in a very simple trial, some streamlined and sensible (\"helpful and supportive\" as opposed to \"policing\") monitoring could help in improving study quality, especially when centers had not previously participated in trials. Fifth, much of the increasing regulatory bureaucracy imposed by guidelines such as the \"Good Clinical Practice\" guidelines may not enhance the quality of the study or improve patient safety more than careful attention to a few key aspects of study design, conduct (such as proper randomization and complete and unbiased outcome ascertainment), and periodic review of the data by an independent DSMB. In fact, there is a danger that these well-intentioned guidelines could prevent the conduct of important low-cost academic trials of generic (non-pharmaceutical) questions by imposing burdensome and expensive processes which may be of little scientific, medical, or ethical value. Sixth, peer review and governmental organizations should develop mechanisms to support international trials and epidemiologic studies. Current funding mechanisms do not generally support such studies in multiple countries, especially if they are low-or middle-income countries.",

The practical experiences in conducting this trial indicate how large trials of important questions can be successfully conducted in resourcepoor settings, by academic groups without industry involvement.
