Canine parvovirus 2 targets rapidly proliferating cells, like those in intestinal crypts and lymphoid organs, causing necrosis of crypt epithelia and depletion of lymphoid organs such as spleen, thymus, lymph node and bone marrow (Carman and Povey, 1985; .

In total 34,117 trimmed reads were obtained and using BLAST analysis more than 10 reads were detected that had the highest similarity with canine bocaviruses, while no other viral sequences were detected. The presence of a novel canine bocavirus, tentatively called canine bocavirus F13000791S, was confirmed by PCR and the complete coding sequence of this canine bocavirus was established (GenBank accession number KF771828). Three main open reading frames were identified, coding for the nonstructural protein (NS; nt 153-2162), the nucleoprotein (NP; nt 2304-2891) and the viral capsid protein (VP1; nt 2875-5013), with a similar genome organization as described previously for canine bocaviruses (Kapoor et al., 2012; Lau et al., 2012) (Fig. 2A) . In addition, a putative RNA splicing site was present at position nt 2078. Phylogenetic analysis of the complete deduced amino acid sequence of the canine bocavirus F13000791S indicated that this virus belongs to the species Canine bocaparvovirus 2 (Fig. 2B) . Additional phylogenetic analysis and analysis of pairwise identities of the nucleotide and deduced amino acid sequence of a partial region of the VP1/2 region which was available for various viruses that are closely related to canine bocavirus F13000791S revealed that this novel virus is most closely related to canine bocavirus Dis-017 (pairwise identities of 96% and 97% on the nucleotide and deduced amino acid level respectively), which was detected previously in a sample collected from a dog with respiratory disease of unknown origin (Kapoor et al., 2012) (Fig. 2C) .",

Screening of various tissues of the other puppies indicated that all puppies were infected with this virus.

To understand the role of bocaviruses in enteric disease, demonstration of virus replication in tissue and association with histologic lesions is an important first step. In the present study, viral nucleic acid could be detected by in situ hybridization mainly in the cytoplasm of lymphoid cells of the submucosal lymphoid tissue of the enteric tract. Only low amounts were present in epithelial cells lining the villi of the small intestinal tract. The presence of viral nucleic acid in the cytoplasm suggests that virus transcription and replication occurred in these cells. However, parvovirus DNA replicates in the nucleus and additional studies are required to elucidate why in the present study viral nucleic acid was detected mainly in the cytoplasm. Of interest, observed in situ hybridization results for the canine bocavirus F13000791s cases were in contrast to small intestinal tissue of a dog infected with MVC. In this control case, viral nucleic acid could be detected exclusively in the nucleus of epithelial cells lining the villi. The divergent histological lesions and apparent viral cell tropism of the CaBoV-2-and the MVC-infected control case may be related to different levels of virulence of both viruses. However, in the cases of CaBoV-2 infection tissue samples were collected from puppies that had died four to five days after onset of disease. Thus, infection and replication of the virus in the enteric tract might have declined while viral nucleic acid could still be detected. Alternatively, CaBoV-2 may have infected only low numbers of epithelial cells of the intestinal tract but played a role in the observed intestinal disease due to infection and partial destruction of the intestinal immune system (including the Peyer patches). Subsequent immunosuppression might have allowed pathogenic bacteria to colonize the intestinal tract and thus contributed to the severe lesions. Therefore, only by fulfilling Koch's postulates the exact role of CaBoV-2 in the observed disease can be demonstrated.",
