Models for in vitro testing of viruses, bacteria, and parasites also need to develop in a timely fashion. Ideally, at least a 6-10 log 10 reduction in pathogen load is suggested to be an acceptable level of efficacy for the methodology. Peak viral load in the window period, however can be as high as 10 8 -10 14 units per milliliter. These high viral loads might prevent reduction of pathogen load to a level that does not transmit infection. 2 Phase III trials demonstrating clinical efficiency can be clinically difficult. Many factors decrease phase III trial assessment feasibility: First, too large a study population might be necessary to see a statistical or clinical difference. Since the initiation of NAT assays, even larger cohorts are required to find additional benefits of PR above those achieved with testing alone because the risks of contamination with the current methods of testing are so small. Second, PR techniques are not applied to all blood products (i.e. cryoprecipitate) given to patients. Third, and epidemiologically, multiple transmission routes/vectors are present by which patients acquire infections making it difficult to prove the infection came from blood; therefore, reliance on phase IV or surveillance of use is required to evaluate for subtle risks and marginal benefits. 2 Elimination of compounds that clearly damage labile blood components is necessary when evaluating PR procedures. Gross hemolysis (O1%), platelet dysfunction, and a O 30% reduction in coagulation factor activity are problems to be avoided. Subtle damage is more difficult to assess. Radiolabeling cells for autologous transfusions and monitoring survival or recovery can be used to evaluate clinical efficacy. Clinically, bleeding time is inadequate to assess platelet function, and delivery of oxygen to tissues is inadequate to assess red cell function after treatments with this technique. 2 The FDA currently favors a clinical assessment of bleeding using the WHO criteria.",

            "text": "The challenge of PR technologies is to continue or increase benefit as threat levels decrease. As techniques in donor selection, collection processes, screening test methodologies, and detection limits are improved, additional benefit from the use of PR techniques decreases. The risks to the recipients decrease as pathogen reduction increases, with development of less toxic and more efficient techniques. More benefit is apparent when new transfusion-transmissible pathogens emerge (SARS, Ebola virus). As PR technologies are developed, however, the likelihood of replacing pathogenscreening tests is not expected nor anticipated. Rather, such technologies should complement existing protocols. 2 Numerous methods have been cultivated and are in various stages of development and use. Solvent detergent pathogen reduction of plasma is the most widely studied methodology and is currently in use across Europe. Other methods include photosensitizing chemicals that interact with pathogen DNA and/or RNA and crosslink following exposure to UVA or visible light, thus inactivating the nucleic acids. Alkylating agents and ethyleneimines are PR technologies that also cross-link nucleic acids but do not require light for activation. 19 An interesting side benefit of these technologies is that white cells are also inactivated, thus potentially eliminating the risk of transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD). This chapter will discuss the more recent developments and address those technologies either in use or likely to be used in the near future.",

This compound acts as an organic solvent and removes lipids during SD processing by extracting and sequestering them into a separate micellar (colloidal) phase. 22 The molecular structure of polyoxyethelene-p-t-octylphenol (Triton X-100) is shown in Figure 2 . This non-ionic detergent disrupts lipid bilayers for easier extraction and stabilizes TNBP. 22 History SD viral inactivation technologies were first licensed for treatment of clotting factor concentrates in 1985. 23, 24 Before 1984, a combination of ethyl ether (20%) and Tween 80 (1%) were found effective in inactivating HBV and NANBHV in factor VIII and IX concentrates with minimal loss in activity. 25 In 1986, TNBP and 0.2% sodium cholate were shown to be effective at inactivating HBV, NANBHV, and HIV. SD technology was first developed in 1987-1988. Use of SD treatment was shown to effect a 6 log 10 viral load reduction in spiked samples. The SD-treated plasma coagulation factor profile was similar to untreated FFP. Removal of additives occurred at a 99.97% efficiency. During the period from 1991 to 1995, approximately 2!10 6 units of solvent detergent fresh frozen plasma (SD-FFP) were transfused without significant adverse sequelae. SD-FFP has been used in Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Belgium, France, the Netherlands, and Norway since the early 1990s. Initial tests from 1990 to 1992 used TNBP (1% organic solvent) and Triton X-100 (1% non-ionic detergent) to treat blood products. These additives were incubated with plasma for 4 hours at 30 8C. The pathogen reduction achieved was a O6 log 10 reduction of HBV, O5 log 10 reduction of HCV, and O6 log 10 reduction of HIV. In France, 1% TNBP and 1% octoxynol 9 were evaluated as PR agents and were found to have similar coagulation factor activities compared to untreated FFP. In some countries in Europe, SD-FFP completely replaced conventional FFP. No systemic mutagenic or reproductive abnormalities have been noted. 24, 25 The uses of SD-treated products from 1985 to 1997 have been wide and varied. Product use of this technology includes commercial factor VIII concentrates, factor IX concentrates, prothrombin complex, commercial factor VII, fibrinogen, protein C, factor XI, antithrombin III, fibrin glue, IM-Ig, IV-Ig, anti-D IgG, HBV-Ig, CMV-Ig, RSV-Ig, anti-tetanus, monoclonal antibody used in the treatment of malignancies, prothrombin complex, and plasma. 24 'Double virus elimination' procedures have been developed to decrease the risk of transmission of HAV. These procedures involve the use of monoclonal antibody affinity, chromatography, nano-filtration, heat, or ultraviolet light in combination with solvent detergent. 24, 25 SD procedures, however, were discovered to be ineffective against non-enveloped viruses. In the US, development costs of SD plasma were never fully recovered because only 15% of the hospital market was using the product at peak usage. The reported occurrence of thrombosis and/or hemorrhage with use of SD-FFP in liver transplant patients markedly decreased usage in the US. 26 Cost, risks, and administrative problems caused further declines in use of SD-FFP in the US. Fewer risks were noted in Europe, and use there continues. Indeed, SD technologies are the most widely used virucidal methods in the world. Before 1998, 35!10 6 doses of SD-treated products had been given. Even though SD plasma continues to be a licensed product in the US, the last lot was made in 2001 and is available only in Europe.

Non-enveloped viruses are less easily inactivated and show much lower log reductions. HAV had only a y1.22 log 10 reduction in viral particles, leading to an outbreak in the 1990s with a factor VIII product. Seroconversions have also been noted to parvovirus B19 (PVB19). 29, 34, 35 A benefit of the broad-spectrum activity of SD treatment is that enveloped pathogens not picked up on routine screening assays will be inactivated by this technique. Examples of these include HIV type O and variants of HBV. 24, 29 Antibodies to non-enveloped viruses in the final products might protect recipients from these pathogens. Protection from acquiring HAV infection can occur as the result of the presence of antibody in the final SD product. Concentrations of anti-HAV antibodies in pooled SD-FFP are 30 times the prophylactic dose. These concentrations of antibody should protect recipients from HAV infection. SD-FFP has antibody concentrations of anti-PVB19 that are seen in IV-Ig used to treat chronic infections. These antibody concentrations should similarly protect recipients from acquiring parvovirus B19. Thus anti-HAV titers of 0.8 IU/mL and PVB19 titers of 8 IU/mL are thought to provide protection against their respective organisms. Screening with NAT is another way to decrease transfusion transmission because copy numbers as low as 10 copies/mL of pathogens can be detected. 24, 29 Purity of product",

            "text": "Vaccinia has been shown to be relatively resistant to SD treatment. 20 Even though this is an enveloped virus, intracellular non-envelope forms exist and are infectious. The active intracellular particles can potentially lead to infection. This study implies that normally enveloped viruses might still be infectious and resistant to SD treatment while in an intracellular environment. 20 SD techniques do not inactivate non-enveloped viruses. Each year between 1991 and 1998, outbreaks of HAV have occurred worldwide with factors VIII and IX concentrates. 25, 38, 41 PVB19 is more difficult to evaluate secondary to increased incidence in the general population. Antibodies in pools of processed plasma might protect recipients from transmission. Nanofiltration can be used to remove nonenveloped viruses but a reduction in factor VII and in von Willebrand factor (vWF) is also seen. If higher titers of antibodies to these viruses are present in the final blood product, passive immunity might be acquired. SD technology cannot be used on cellular products because the plasma membranes will disintegrate. 25, 31, 39, 41 Toxicity associated with SD technology When compounds interact with nucleic acids, mutagenicity becomes a concern. If present, mutagenic compounds can lead to genotoxicity, carcinogenicity, or toxicity to the reproductive system. Compounds interacting with membrane lipids or protein can adversely affect cellular function. If such reactions are occurring, the processing must ensure the compounds are not present in the final product administered to the patient. 2 The risk associated with SD treatment also includes the toxicity of the chemical additives per se. When evaluating the toxicity of Triton X-100, the lethal dose at which 50% of animals are killed (LD 50 ) was used. Triton X-100 in animal studies has an LD 50 of 1.2-1.8 g/kg via the oral route and LD 50 of 108-150 mg/kg for the intraperitoneal or intravenous route. The lowest toxicity was found to be 33.7 mg/kg in mice and 15.7 mg/kg in rats, with a LD 50 of 605-660 mg/kg in mice and 610-615 mg/kg in rats. No mutagenicity potential, embryo toxic, or teratogenic potential was demonstrated. A TTP patient could theoretically receive 63 L of PLAS/SD or Triton X-100 of 2.7 mg/kg. This is well below the toxicity levels. Because the chemical reaction is nonselective, the agents must be removed before the final product is transfused. 20, 21 With present processing techniques, there often is no detectable TNBP or Triton X-100 in the final blood product. 34, 42, 43 Benefits Many of the benefits of SD treatment lie in the fact that in addition to pathogen reduction the process is unlikely to degrade the plasma proteins. Coagulation factor loss is not clinically significant; a loss of 5-20% activity is seen in multiple studies. Thirty percent activity is required to maintain normal hemostasis. Enveloped viruses are inactivated by this process. No transmission of such viruses was seen after the transfusion of 17 000 000 units between 1980 and 1993. In a 1995 study in the US, 3% of patients had hives, abdominal pain, nausea, vomiting, chills, headache, wheezing, fever, and hypertension, with an average recovery of 90% of clotting factors in this study population. 25, 27, 28 ",

            "text": "Future studies are necessary to evaluate safety for use of these products in neonates, infants, and pregnant women. A study to evaluate the statistical/clinical relevance in the decrease of infection transmission risk would require hundreds of thousands in a cohort group. To be undertaken, this would require a multicenter trial over several years. 2 SD-FFP is still FDA licensed. However, at this time, SD-FFP is not used in the US. 25, 44 Costs Producing and evaluating SD-FFP involves filtering, tracking, extracting, and monitoring residual pathogen or chemical agents. The additional steps and additives increase the cost of production to three to four times that of untreated FFP. Previous cost-effective analyses have suggested that SD-FFP costs go up to US$9 743 000 per quality of life year (QALY) gained. Some have argued that, taking into account the decreased incidence of transfusion-related acute lung injury (TRALI) with SD-FFP, the cost would be decreased to US$40 855-139 465 per QALY saved. The incidence of TRALI with SD-FFP is negligent given the dilutional affect of pooled plasma. 45 In other aspects of medicine, an accepted procedure typically costs less than $30 000 per QALY gained, i.e. cholesterol reduction ($13 300) or coronary artery bypass ($ 26 117) . In other aspects of transfusion medicine, however, high-cost safety measures have been adopted to reduce the risk of transfusion-transmitted diseases. Costs for these programs range from $235,000 to $2.3 million per QALY. Such procedures include autologous donations, as well as p24 antigen assay for HIV. The costs should, therefore, not be the only determining factor considered in rejecting or accepting SD technology. 23, 30, 39, [45] [46] [47] Uniplas w Another product currently available is Uniplas w , a solvent detergent-treated universal plasma. Anti-A and anti-B iso-agglutinin antibodies have been removed from this product. Immune complexes of anti-A and anti-B antibodies with soluble A and B antigens are hydrophobic and removed by SD treatment. Total protein and coagulation factors in Uniplas w are similar to SD-FFP. In a published study, no patients seroconverted to HIV, HTLV, HBC, CMV, HAV, or parvovirus B19 seropositivity. 48 Two studies showed equivalent efficacy of Uniplas w with Octiplas w in open-heart surgeries 48, 49 , although Uniplas w has the additional benefit of being compatible with all blood groups. Further studies are recommended to determine if Uniplas w is otherwise equivalent to standard SD. 48, 49 Phenothiazinium dyes: methylene blue Methylene blue (MB) was first synthesized by Caro in 1876; in 1883 Bernsthen synthesized the parent ring system. Currently, this compound has been administered orally as an antiseptic, disinfectant, and an antidote for nitrate poisoning. MB has been used in the treatment of methemoglobinemia, in locating surgical sites, and for validation of properly following medication prescriptions. Long-term use in humans has not been associated with adverse effects in treating methemoglobin toxicities. In 1891, MB was instrumental in the cure of malaria in two patients. In 1928, it was demonstrated that MB could inactivate HSV vaccinia when exposed to light. Nucleic acids were found to be the target of MB in 1956, and oxygen was found to be necessary to this reaction in photodynamic activity reaction. Since 1962, MB has been known to photochemically degrade DNA. 50-54 The use of MB for viral inactivation of plasma was first described in 1991. 23 Ideally, a photochemical dye first needs to penetrate membranes (whether pathogen or plasma membrane) to inactivate intra-as well as extracellular pathogens. Second, by adhering to predominately or exclusively nucleic acid compounds, there should be little damage to red blood cells. Third, since hemoglobin absorbs light at wavelengths of less than 600 nm, the ideal photocompound should absorb light at other wavelengths. Last, the unbound dye should not cause excessive damage to RBC. The compound needs to be active only in the presence of light and to be inactive while blood components are in storage. 55 Phenothiazine dyes are more favorable because unwanted cell damage can be limited by ensuring that no light exposure occurs after the initial treatment is complete. By contrast, for SD techniques the reaction ceases only when the PR compounds are removed. In the last 100 years, both bacterial and tropical diseases (i.e. malaria) have been treated with MB. In the past 50 years, as specific antibiotics to these pathogens were developed, use of MB has decreased. A renaissance of interest in pathogen reduction has developed as Plasmodium falciparum has demonstrated an increasing incidence of chloroquine resistance, drug-resistant bacteria (e.g. MRSA, VRE, multidrug resistant tuberculosis) have become more common, and opportunistic organisms in HIV patients are more widespread. 50,55",

Its precise mode of action is guanine-specific cleavage. In solutions lacking an oxygen environment, a direct electron transfer is probably responsible for strand breakage via direct cleavage of phosphodiester bonds; in an oxygen-rich solution, reactive oxygen species (iO 2 , OH, superoxides) are generated. MB has a peak absorption at 620-670 nm. Exposure to light of this wavelength produces a type I (redox) reaction or a type II (photodynamic, photo-oxidative) interaction. MB also binds to viral core proteins and has been shown to cause damage to bacteria (Proteus mirabilis) and RBC membrane proteins. Bacteria and hemoglobin can reduce MB and convert it to a leukomethylene form, which is neither a photosensitive nor an intercalater (maximum absorbance 340 nm). MB technology has been shown to inactivate enveloped and some non-enveloped viruses. However, given its hydrophobic nature at concentrations of 5 mM, this compound cannot penetrate plasma membranes and/or inactivate intracellular viruses. 26,39,51-54,56-59",

Between 1991 and 2000, 2 million units were transfused with no untoward events. MB has been used both as a marker in surgery and to reduce methemoglobin. As much as 50 mg t.i.d., for ifosfamide-induced encephalopathy, and 2 mg/kg, in septic shock, has been given to patients. Although MB has been used in much higher concentrations, the Paul Ehrlich Institute has refused to license MB-treated plasma because of toxicity concerns. 64 Adverse reactions associated with MB include a burning sensation in the mouth, nausea, vomiting, diarrhea, and gastritis. Large doses can cause abdominal and chest pain, headache, profuse sweating, mental confusion, painful urination, and methemoglobinemia (see the Material Safety Data Sheets, refs. 60,61). In life-threatening clinical situations, however, these adverse events do not outweigh the life-saving benefit of MB. Two different proprietary methods for processing FFP with MB-Pathinact MB w (Baxter) and Macotronic w (Macopharma)are currently used in Europe. 50, [53] [54] [55] 57, 65 Procedure In general, the MB treatment of plasma utilizes a 1 mm concentration of MB followed by exposure to red light (600-700 nm) with a fluence rate of 10 mW/cm 2 for 600 s. Freezing and thawing of the unit can liberate intracellular organisms. One study processed three units at a time by passing the contents of each unit through a 0.65-mm membrane filtration system. 55 After filtration, a dry tab of MB (80 mg) was placed in the line; the MB dissolved during filtration. Approximately, 180 J/cm 2 in less than 20 minutes was applied with 590 nm peak l of light. The concentration of 1 mm MB in the unit was computer controlled. 55 Other procedures process MB with 5 mm concentration and a fluence of 11.3 J/cm 2 . The product is then stored at K30 8C. When needed, each unit is then thawed and transfused in the same manner as untreated FFP. 66, 67 Efficacy The efficacy of MB reduction is increased in the presence of oxygen. This process has demonstrated an ability to inactivate enveloped viruses with DNA and RNA genomes (HIV 6.32 log 10 , VSV 6 log 10 ). Some non-enveloped viruses with large capsid pores are inactivated (i.e. WNV 5.7 log 10 reduction). However, non-encapsulated viruses with tightly interdigitated capsid proteins (e.g. encephalomyocarditis virus) are not inactivated. Little bacterial inactivation is observed under virucidal phototherapeutic conditions. MB is more effective against Gram-positive than Gram-negative organisms; Candida albicans and Trypanosoma brucei are also inactivated.",

            "text": "MB has difficulty in penetrating plasma membranes and, as such, intracellular organisms are not inactivated. The viability of red cells when MB is used with an RBC product is decreased. After 42 days of storage in MB, 0.8% of the red blood cells lyse. In addition, MB-treated RBC membranes show dramatically increased ion leakage. MB binds to IgG and albumin (serum proteins); this might further alter RBC membranes by attaching to these membrane proteins. Despite concern over adverse events, MB has a long history of use with minimal toxicity. 11, 25, 52, 53, 56 Problems Secondary to binding to proteins, 10-30% of coagulation factors and 20-24% of fibrinogen are inactivated after MB treatment of plasma. This loss of activity is thought to be secondary to the oxidation of histidine residues and other amino acids. MB also binds to the alpha subunits of fibrinogen resulting in lower platelet-receptor binding results. 11, 25, [53] [54] [55] 57, 65, 66, 68, 69 MB does not inactivate intracellular pathogens or white blood cells. MB treatment of blood products cannot reduce the incidence TA-GVHD. In RBCs, up to one-half of the MB added is bound to membrane proteins or located within the RBCs. The compound within the RBCs is reduced to the leukobase form and can neither intercalate nor photosensitize. Binding of MB to RBC surface proteins also increases ion permeability of the membrane. MB also inactivates glutathione reductase and decreases red blood cells ability to handle oxidation toxicity. These effects decrease the life expectancy of red cells. 11, 55, 66 Toxicity in animal studies reveals the LD 50 oral route as being 1180 mg/kg and the intraperitoneal dose 180 mg/kg for rats. In mice studies, the oral LD 50 was shown to be 3500 mg/kg; this indicates a low toxicity for this compound. MB is not reported to be carcinogenic, however, its toxocologic properties have not been fully investigated. At the concentrations used in clinical practice, toxicity appears to be minimal. This may relate to the final concentration in the bag at the micromolar level and not on the molar level. More research on the toxological properties of MB is needed. 53, 60, 61 AMOTOSALEN Compounds known as photosensitizers were first used in around 1550bc in ancient Egypt and India to treat depigmented lesions. The chemicals were obtained from parsley, parsnip, and St John's wort, applied to the skin and exposed to sunlight, which caused skin damage, re-epithelialization, and re-pigmentation of the skin. In 1897, Oscar Raab observed that paramecia placed in acrydine dye died on exposure to light but were unaffected if no light exposure occurred. Subsequently, these compounds were identified as furocoumarins, a group that includes psoralens. In the modern era, furocoumarins have been applied to biologic systems to treat various skin tumors and conditions, and to deactivate microorganisms, as well as being employed as a research tool to increase our knowledge of nucleic acids. 70 Amotosalen is a synthetic psoralen specifically engineered to inactivate pathogens in blood products. Psoralens are naturally occurring heterocyclic compounds and are common in numerous plants, such as those mentioned above. With the addition of amine side chains, the compound becomes water soluble, which increases it's affinity for nucleic acids. Specific characteristics necessary for the psoralens to be useful in inactivating microorganisms in blood products include: the chemical purity, activation only upon light exposure, preferentially retained in the target organism(s), and rapidly excretion or elimation with minimal toxicity. In addition, the chemical has to have a high quantum yield for the photochemical event. 71, 72 Of the hundreds of psoralens evaluated, amotosalen was chosen because of its excellent activity against pathogens and minimal impact on the blood products, and because it essentially fulfilled the above criteria.",

It cannot be used in red cell concentrates because hemoglobin absorbs the UVA light. Amotosalen works via a three-step chemical reaction: The chemical initially intercalates between strands of DNA or RNA. On exposure to UVA light, the molecule binds the olefinic moieties of the pyrimidine bases thymidine, cytidine, and uridine and forms a monoadduct. The monoadduction causes the helix to unwind slightly and, with continued exposure to UVA light, allows a second adduction to form, which results in cross-linkage. The nucleic acid then becomes non-functional because the cross-linkage is permanent and replication can no longer occur. The same process occurs in single-stranded nucleic acid structures that form hairpin turns and loops that allow for close proximity of pyrimidine bases, thus making them available for cross-linkage. 72, 73 Thus, pathogens and white blood cells contained in the blood products are inactivated ( Figure 5 and Table 1 ).",

The device is located in the blood product storage bag where it can scavenge amotosalen and its photoproducts. An additional step is necessary for platelets, as the system works best when the plasma concentration in the platelet bag is lowered to 35% by adding platelet additive solution (PAS III). 73 Amotosalen is added to plasma or platelets at a concentration of 150 mM/mL (50 mg/mL) and, while agitating, the bag is illuminated with 3 J/cm 3 of UVA light.

            "text": "In vitro studies have found that after processing through the INTERCEPT Blood System, there is a not insignificant drop-in the range of 8-10%-in the number of platelets present in the bag. This was due both to the increased amount of platelet sampling necessary to meet the demands of the studies and to the requirements of processing the platelets through the photochemical treatment, which involves manipulation of platelets through three different bags, and agitation needed to mix the amotosalen with platelets and to expose amotosalen and photoproducts to the compound absorption device. In the Moog et al study, single-donor platelet concentrates contained mean platelet counts of 3.06G0.27!10 11 . 74 On completion of the photochemical treatment (PCT), the mean platelet count was 2.62G0.27! 10 11 , representing a loss of 9.7%. 74 Also in the Moog study, significant decreases in pH were identified after PCT, with a mean drop to 6.98G0.08. Compared to the control, however, this pH level was well above the required 6.8 limit required in Europe, and the pH remained above 6.8 until the end of the study, at 5 days of storage. 74 Glucose decreased from 354G34 to 119G32 mg/dL after separation from plasma and following the addition of Intersol (PAS III) and remained essentially the same post-PCT at 122G10 mg/dL. As expected during storage, glucose continued to decrease and lactate dehydrogenase (LDH) to rise. A significant increase in LDH was evident after PCT, indicative of platelet lysis and activation. Subsequently, however, the LDH level remained stable throughout storage. The HSR decreased both after preparation and after PCT; however, the platelets appeared to achieve normal hemostasis upon transfusion. 74 Parameters for apoptosis, function, and activation of platelets examined by Jansen et al 75 included P-selectin, aggregation studies, hypotonic shock response, annexin V, and caspase 3 activity. PCT did not cause elevation of P-selectin, although the levels did rise over time during storage similar to control. Changes in HSR were not significant in this study compared with controls and caspase 3 activity and annexin V expression were unchanged, suggesting that apoptosis was not stimulated. 75 Decreases in platelet aggregation were not significant after PCT. However, after storage, compared to controls, aggregation studies using collagen and thrombin were decreased, but not in those using ADP. 75 These changes vary in extent from study to study and, to some extent, by technique. The results of a French validation study are consistent with the findings above. 76 This study also investigated longer storage times, finding that the in vitro platelet parameters remained within satisfactory ranges for up to 8 days. The authors suggest that it might be possible to extend the expiration date of PCT platelets to 7 days. 76 The changes that are induced by the PCT process might not always be significantly different from controls. In vitro platelet parameters remain within the guidelines set by various regulatory agencies and appear to be adequate for clinical use.",

            "text": "One in vivo study looked at PCT platelet survival following indium-111 radiolabeling of the treated autologous platelets. The normal span of platelet survival is broad, ranging from 5 to 7.3 days with 33-66% recovery. Recovery in PCT-CAD platelets was 43%G8.7 and lifespan was 4.8G1.3 days. Although within the lower range of normal and significantly lower than controls, the findings are consistent with those of the other studies. In addition, the authors found that, in in vitro studies, the label dissociation was higher in PCT platelets than in control platelets. 77 Other in vivo studies have yielded similar data, with results showing small changes that might or might not be significant compared to controls, although the performance was still within regulatory guidelines and medically acceptable ranges. Endpoints in these studies included post-platelet counts at various time periods, number of transfusions required over a given time period, number of adverse reactions, platelet refractoriness, and bleeding episodes. Most studies also looked for possible antibodies to amotosalen neoantigens. Two large in vivo studies from the euroSPRITE (S-59 Platelet Recovery In Thrombocytopenia in Europe) and SPRINT (S-59 Platelet Recovery In Thrombocytopenia in the USA) trials have reported similar results. 78, 79 The SPRINT trial was a nationwide study that enrolled 645 thrombocytopenic patients who were randomized to PCT-CAD-treated platelets or standard platelets. The platelets were single donor units collected by apheresis. The euroSPRITE trial was designed similarly. Both studies found that CCIs (corrected count increments) were lower in patients treated with PCT platelets. This finding in both studies is explained by the lower platelet number in the PCT units. In the SPRINT trial, however, after correcting for the lower dose per unit infused, investigators found no significant difference between PCT-CAD platelet and standard platelet units. For the same reasons, patients treated with PCT platelet units required more transfusions over time. Bleeding and refractoriness were essentially the same for controls and patients treated with PCT units in both trials. In the SPRINT trial, transfusion reactions were fewer in patients treated with PCT-CAD platelets (3 versus 4.4%, pZ0.02). No antibodies to any amotosalen neoantigens were identified. Therefore, the PCT-CAD treated platelets were considered to be functionally as safe and effective as control platelets for patients. 79, 80 In summary, the platelet studies as a whole demonstrated that the PCT-CAD platelets appear to be an acceptable alternative to untreated platelets given the added safety measure from PR process. Due to the loss of a fraction of the platelets during processing, the number of platelet transfusions required for each patient may be slightly higher.",

            "text": "The function of FFP after PCT-CAD has also been validated in phase III trials in Norway and Germany. 80 To support large-scale processing, FFP was pooled to a maximum quantity of 650 mL, allowing up to three units of FFP to be produced per PCT-CAD process. Assays of factors II, V, VII, VIII, IX, X, XI, XIII, proteins C and S, anti-thrombin III, alpha2-antiplasmin, and fibrinogen were assayed in the manufacturers own laboratory. Fibrinogen and factor VIII levels were maintained at 78-79% of pre-PCT-CAD levels. Factors II, V, VII, IX, X, XI, XIII, proteins C and S, anti-thrombin III, and alpha2 antiplasmin were maintained at 85-95% of pre-PCT-CAD levels. Thus, the quantity of anticoagulant and procoagulant factors declined minimally. This recalls the decline seen in PCT platelet numbers. However, clinical trials have demonstrated that PCT-CAD-treated plasma factors function adequately in vivo in patients with acquired and congenital coagulopathies and TTP, as well as those requiring warfarin reversal. 81 Hambleton et al 82 studied healthy volunteers who donated apheresis plasma. Half of the group was treated with PCT-CAD and the other half was processed in the usual fashion. Subsequently, subjects took warfarin for 4 days until factor VII levels were lowered to a mean concentration of 0.33 IU/mL. They were then infused with 1 L of either PCT-treated or untreated plasma. Two weeks later, the process was repeated and the subject received the other type of FFP. Mean peak increments of 0.10-0.12 IU/mL of factor VII were identified for both PCT-CAD-treated and standard FFP. The results reveal that, despite the mild decreased level of factors in PCT-treated FFP, the factor VII level increased to the same level in patients with either PCT-treated or untreated plasma. In addition, the study measured the PT to determine coagulation factor function. The change in PT levels closely reflected the drop in factor VII levels in the first 8 hours and decreased similarly in both control and test patients. At 24 hours after FFP infusions, however, the PT rebounded to above pre-infusion levels, more so in the PCT-CAD-treated FFP patients than in the patients treated with standard FFP. 82 Another study reported in an abstract reviewed the effect of PCT-CAD-treated FFP on patients with an acquired coagulopathy due to liver disease requiring treatment with FFP. Several factor levels were evaluated but only the PT and PTT were reported. No adverse events were described and the PTand PTT decreased similarly both in controls and in treated patients. Active bleeding stopped in one patient given PCT-CAD-treated FFP. 83 Von Willebrand factor was studied separately in another study, which again was reported in an abstract. Similarly, there was no statistical difference between PCT-CAD-treated plasma and conventional FFP. 84 A more recent abstract reported by Mintz et al examined the efficacy of PCT-CAD plasma in TTP patients. 85 The mean time to remission, remission rates, mean number of exchanges, and relapse rates were not significantly different than controls, with p values ranging from 0.58 to 1.0. No patients developed new antibodies, although one patient had a serious adverse event after 12 days of therapeutic plasma exchanges, which was not further described in the abstract. The patient was removed from the study and recovered without sequelae. Despite this event, the authors concluded that the PCT-CAD-treated FFP performed similarly to the control plasma in terms of efficacy and safety. Therefore, it is likely that the adverse event could have occurred with untreated plasma as well. 85 Thus, numerous clinical trials have demonstrated that FFP treated with PCT-CAD appears to be as effective as standard FFP.",

Numerous studies have demonstrated a minimum of a greater than 5 log reduction in most viruses, bacteria, and protozoan tested, whether extra-or intracellular. Experiments reported by Lin et al 86 are typical. These researchers added high levels of pathogens to single-donor platelet units. In the case of HIV, they evaluated cell-free and cell-associated virus, as well as pro-viral HIV. Duck hepatitis B (DHBV) and bovine viral diarrhea virus (BVDV) were used as surrogates for human strains of hepatitis B and hepatitis C. A representative of Gram-positive Staphylococcus epidermidis and Gram-negative Klebsiella pnemoniae bacteria were studied by inoculating 10 4 colony-forming units (CFU)/mL into the platelet units. Before treatment, the bags were sampled in order to determine the viral or bacterial titer. Different levels of UVA light were used to determine the appropriate level of pathogen inactivation. Based on these studies, the UVA frequency is now set at 3 J/cm 2 . Starting with small doses allowed the authors to differentiate the speed and effectiveness of the process. HIV was readily eliminated and proviral HIV was even more sensitive to the process than the cell-free or cell-associated HIV. High levels of BVDV and DHBV were also readily inactivated at 3 J/cm 2 . Klebsiella bacteria, however, were more resistant, as two of four units were still infective after PCT with 3 J/cm 2 . When the experiment was repeated, all four units were negative. Gram-negative bacteria are known to be more resistant to PCT due to the lipopolysaccharide outer membrane, which serves to inhibit small organic molecules such as amotosalen. However, the authors concluded that the ability of the process to reduce the bacteria by a factor of greater than 10 5 was considered a success as clinically the presence of such high titers in blood products would be highly unlikely. S. epidermidis was readily inactivated by the process with as few as 0.5 J/cm 2 . Van Voorhis et al 87 conducted similar experiments with T. cruzi and demonstrated the effectiveness of PCT-CAD in inactivating this parasite, which is likely to become a more of a concern in the future. Lin et al 88 and Jordan et al 89 demonstrated effective pathogen reduction of latent and free CMV in mice. Another experiment by Lin et al 90 , looked at several types of bacteria, including Gram-negative, Gram-positive, anaerobic, aerobic, and spirochetes (specifically Treponema pallidum and Borellia burgdorferi). The spirochetes were very sensitive to the PCT-CAD process and, again, the various other bacteria examined were effectively inactivated by the process.",

However, further studies are needed to more fully explore the upper limit of the capacity of PCT-CAD (150 mg dose of amotosalen plus 3 J/cm 2 ) to reduce pathogen activity. This might be most important for those pathogens more resistant to the process, such as Klebsiella pneumoniae and parvovirus B19. The safety of the amotosalen-based PCT-CAD process has been well demonstrated in the short-term in several phase III clinical trials. Long-term studies will be necessary to determine the risk, particularly of carcinogenesis. The amotosalen-based process for platelets is currently under review in the US by the FDA. In Europe, the process for platelets has received the CE mark and has been validated and implemented in some countries, including France and Norway. Cost-benefit analyses have begun and initial findings have been reported by the Netherlands and Germany, which conclude that the cost of INTERCEPT Blood System for platelets is comparable to that of other blood safety interventions, such as nucleic acid testing. 91, 92 Currently, the INTERCEPT Blood System and its programs are in various stages of the development and regulatory approval process.",

These tripartite molecules are composed of a nucleic acid anchor, an effector moiety, and a frangible linker. The effector moiety binds nucleic acids covalently, and the frangible linker breaks down forming an inactive negatively charged species (S-300). This prevents further binding to the nucleic acid, thus rendering the DNA or RNA non-functional. 73 The completely light-independent reaction proceeds due to a shift in pH, which occurs as the S-303 is added to red blood cell concentrates. The process as developed requires the addition of S-303 to red cells at a concentration of 150 mg/mL, which is then incubated for 12 hours at room temperature. The red cells are incubated with a compound absorption device (CAD) for an additional 8 hours after transfer to a storage container to remove any residual S-303 and S-300. The CAD remains in the red cells throughout storage. 73",

            "text": "Most information published about S-303 pathogen reduction is in abstract form. The earliest abstract by Cook et al reported no biologically significant differences in S-303-treated red cells stored for 42 days, although the degree of hemolysis appeared to vary significantly among treated units. 94 The same study evaluated S-303-treated RBC recovery in dogs and mice using a biotin recovery technique. The results were comparable with controls. A year later, Cook et al reported the results of another S-303-treated red cell study where recovery in dogs was not significantly different than controls. In addition, they conducted two further experiments. One involved replacing 80% of a dog's blood volume with S-303treated cells and the other involved dogs receiving twelve 10-mL/kg transfusions over a month. The concentration of S-303 in each experiment reached 500 mg/mL, which was thought to be five times what a human would receive; no toxicity was identified. Flow cytometry was used to evaluate immunogenicity, which did not identify any antibodies specific to S-303. 95 In early human studies, the findings have been similar. In 1999, Hambleton et al found greater than 75% RBC recovery in humans transfused with S-303-treated autologous blood. The study performed one clinical trial then re-enrolled the same subjects in a second trial. The subjects thus received more than one consecutive transfusion and evaluated the DAT antibody screen and cross-match data, all of which remained the same, as did in vivo recovery. 96 Hambleton et al subsequently performed a cross-over study in 2002 and, again, found no statistical differences from controls in 24-hour red cell recovery after treatment with S-303. 97 Phase III clinical trials were initiated based on these preliminary data. Despite promising results regarding the efficacy of S-303-treated red cells in patients 98,99 , these trials have been halted due to antibody formation to S-303-treated cells. Patients requiring chronic transfusion for thalassemia or sickle-cell anemia were entered into a randomized, double-blinded, cross-over study. Each patient was to receive a total of six transfusions. The number of units per transfusion, as well as the frequency of transfusion, was determined by the treating physician. Two asymptomatic pediatric patients developed antibodies to S-303-treated red cells after transfusion; pretransfusion IAT cross-matches were negative. Despite the antibody, there was no evidence of reduced red cell survival and a monocyte monolayer RBC phagocytic assay was negative, suggesting the antibody was not likely to have been clinically significant. The DAT in both patients was negative. 99 In hapten inhibition assays, the S-303, but not glutathione, exhibited inhibition. The latter is used as the buffer during processing. 99 Alterations in the pathogen-reduction process were made in an attempt to eliminate the antibody problem. In the original protocol, 200 mM of S-303 was added to 2 mM unbuffered GSH. Stassinopoulos et al 100 altered the process by adding 20 mM GSH, which significantly reduced the presence of S-303 on the red cells. Sera from the patients who developed the antibodies was added to the modified treated S-303 red cells, and the IAT was negative. Pathogen reduction using the modified process remained effective. 101 The modification essentially dilutes, rather than eliminates, the neo-antigen presence on the S-303-treated red cells. Further research will be required to determine if dilution alone will be adequate to prevent alloimmunization in red cells processed with S-303-treated red cells.",

            "text": "PEN110 is another PR/PI compound that also disrupts nucleic acids. Like S-303, light is not required for the reaction and it can therefore be used to treat red cells. PEN110 is a compound chemically related to binary ethyleneimine and is known as an ethyleneimine oligomer. The altered molecule is a cation, selective for nucleic acids, and highly water soluble. As the molecule is very small, it readily diffuses through cell membranes, which, the manufacturer claims, makes it more effective against non-lipid enveloped viruses, such as parvoviruses, which are more resistant to heterocyclic compounds (see amotosalen, above). PEN110 forms ionic bonds with nucleic acids, activating the molecule by protonation of the aziridino nitrogen. The active form can then alkylate a proximal nucleophilic center such as the N7 position of guanine in DNA. This results in the opening of the imidazole ring structure of guanine, which creates a break in the strand and creates a stop message. The nucleic acid is thus inactivated and becomes useless as a template. Binary ethyleneimines, like psoralens, have been used in nucleic acid research since the 1980s. The development and use of PEN110 for pathogen reduction of blood products, however, has occurred only over the past 15 years. In the process known as INACTINE treatment, PEN110 is added to create a 0.1% (vol/vol) concentration and incubated at room temperature for 6 hours. PEN110 is then removed by washing with unbuffered saline to levels below the limit of detection when using HPLC (30 ng/mL). The units are then ready for storage. 101, 104 Toxicology Two main studies by Chapman, Butterwork, and Moore 101,102 describe the toxicology of PEN110. The PEN110 compound reacts with nucleic acids, and the Ames and mouse lymphoma assays are both positive, indicative of genotoxicity. 102 PEN110 also induced unscheduled DNA synthesis (UDS) in rat hepatocyte cultures. However, chromosomal assays and whole animal toxicity assays were negative. PEN110 given to rats intravenously at high blood concentrations did not induce UDS in their hepatocytes suggestive of an effective clearance pathway. 102 The compound appeared to be excreted quickly in the urine. 102 The second study 103 , focusing on reproductive effects, was conducted on rats and rabbits. Male and female rats were regularly dosed with various quantities of PEN110 before and after mating. The animals were then killed after gestational day 14 or 16 and examined. Before euthanasia of the males, sperm analysis was conducted. As rabbits are known to be a more sensitive model for reproductive toxicology than rats, a second study arm was initiated using mated female rabbits dosed with PEN110 and killed on gestational day 29. 102 The ability of PEN110treated rats to become pregnant was not impaired. Further, the number of implantation sites, number of fetuses, and number of fetal losses were not significantly different from those found in controls. Fetal abnormalities were not identified. Numerous sperm characteristics were evaluated in males, none of which was significantly different than controls. Only female rats and rabbits receiving the highest doses of PEN110 demonstrated toxicity characterized by significantly decreased food consumption and decreased weight gain. The fetuses of rabbit mothers receiving high-dose PEN110 had significantly increased skeletal variations; however, these variations were not clinically significant and did not affect the viability to the fetuses. These effects were identified at dosing regimens of 0.1, 0.3, and 1.0 mg of PEN110 per kilogram of weight in rabbits and 0.05, 0.25, and 0.5 mg/kg in the rats. After washing, PEN110-treated blood (350 mL) contained 0.0175 mg of PEN110, which is equivalent to 0.00025 mg/kg of body weight for a 70-kg person. This level is 2000 times lower than the 0.5 mg/kg dose given the rats and, based on cumulative mg per kg figures, the dose is 48 000 times less. Therefore, even given that an individual human might receive multiple units at once or over time, the dose is believed to be far less than that required to induce reproductive or genotoxicity. 102",

            "text": "The majority of research thus far has been on the use of PEN110 for the inactivation of pathogens in units of red blood cells. In a preclinical trial, Purmal et al studied the effect of PEN110 pathogen inactivation, using 6-and 24-hour incubations, on a number of red cell parameters including hemolysis, RBC ATP, intracellular potassium, and red cell surface antigens. 104 RBC ATP was significantly reduced in the PEN110-treated red cells compared to controls whether 6-or 24-hour incubations were used. However, the level of ATP was still within the clinically acceptable range. Hemolysis out to day 42 was not significantly increased compared to controls in the cells incubated for 24 hours with PEN110. The inactive PI/PR process had no effect on intracellular potassium. 104 Snyder et al 105 had similar results with lowered ATP in treated cells but no clinically significant difference in hemolysis for PEN110-treated versus control red cells. This group also studied 2,3-diphosphoglycerate (2,3-DPG), P50, sodium, methemoglobin, complete blood count (CBC), lactate, and glucose. Again, there was no significant difference between controls and PEN110-treated cells. 105 ATP levels were also lower in a study by AuBuchon et al. The authors also noted lower levels of lactate and decreased glucose consumption in the PEN110-treated cells. These changes were interpreted as a 'metabolic slowing', although no further explanation was provided. Again, the changes were within acceptable ranges and clinically were not significantly different when compared with the control results. 106 All three of these studies included in vivo study arms evaluated after 28 or 42 days of storage. Purmal et al 104 removed red blood cells from baboons, double labeled them with 51 Cr/ 125 I, and re-infused them into the autologous animals. Red cell survival after 28 days of storage ranged from 66 to 76% in controls and from 72 to 80% in PEN110-treated cells. After 42 days of storage, red cell survival ranged from 39 to 61% in controls and 16 to 77% in PEN110-treated cells. The differences in survival time were not statistically significant. The Snyder et al study 105 was a phase II clinical trial using healthy human volunteers who were re-infused with 51 Cr-radiolabeled blood following treatment with PEN110 and 42 or 35 days of storage. Control units were processed in a similar manner. In vivo 24-hour survival in PEN110-treated cells stored for 42 days was 82.9G5.7% and for 35 days of storage was 84.7G4.8%. The 24-hour survival in controls was statistically similar; after 42 days storage it was 86.3G8.7%, and after 35 days storage, 85.7G3.5%. The mean rise in hemoglobin at 24 hours and 7 days after infusion of the remaining unlabeled autologous units of red blood cells was also evaluated and the PEN110-treated results were not statistically different from control, with 24-hour values of 0.8 versus 0.5 g/dL and 7-day values of 0.8 versus 0.9 g/dL. The in vivo portion of the AuBuchon et al study 106 evaluated the survival of red cells in humans after 28 days of storage and determined T 50 values. Again, there was no statistical difference between PEN110-treated cells in 24-hour survival. The T 50 values also were similar to controls.",

Of the enveloped types, BVDV and pseudorabies virus (PRV) are recognized models for HCV and herpes virus.

In these studies, the inactivation process was altered by using 1 M sodium thiosulphate (STS) and 1 M 3morpholinopropanesulphonic acid (MOPS) to chemically stop the PEN110 reaction (rather than washing) to ensure that the decreased viral cytotoxic effect was due to PEN110 alone and not washing. In addition, red cell units were collected in three different additive solution storage media CPD/AS-1, CP2D/AS-3, and CPD/AS-5.

The reduction factors for these viruses were O6.2 log 10 TCID 50 per milliliter, O5.3 and O5.6 log 10 PFU per milliliter, respectively. For cellular HIV, the reduction to the level of detection took 6 hours.",

            "text": "The same group of researchers conducted a series of experiments investigating PEN110 inactivation of HIV. 108 They evaluated the effect of PEN110 on the structure of the virus by EM, the ability of the virus to enter cells after PEN110 treatment, and the reverse transcriptase activity after PEN110 treatment, in addition to the usual demonstration of the PEN110 treatment effect via the TCID 50 assay. The structure of the virus did not change and the ability of the virus to infect cells remained intact after PEN110 treatment. However, the viral reverse transcriptase did not function, consistent with the alteration of nucleic acid by PEN110. The HIV reduction took place primarily in the first 6 hours and decreased to the level of detection after 12 hours. Large-volume infection required 18 hours to decrease to the level of detection. The reduction factors varied from 5.35 to 5.96 log TCID 50 after 18 hours. Another study demonstrated that PEN110 was effective against HBV. 109 In a study of West Nile virus, Mather et al 110 explored the survival of the virus in PEN110-treated blood stored under the usual blood bank conditions and found that although the viral population decrease over time, the units remain 'infectious' throughout the 42 days of storage when spiked with high-titer viral concentrates; lowtiter spiked units were non-infectious by 42 days. The doses chosen for high and low titers were based on the limited data available from donors with natural WNV Pathogen inactivation techniques 231 infection. Infectivity was determined by PFU assays. Although, the study demonstrated viral survival, whether the dose present would be sufficient to cause infection in humans is not known. In addition, the same study demonstrated that the WNV was distributed in all blood components-red blood cells, plasma, and platelets-and that the virus can infect monocytes and may be harbored in these cells in vivo. PEN110 treatment reduced WNV to the level of detection of the assay within 3 hours and, after 24 hours, reduced the virus by a factor of 5.0 log TCID 50 per milliliter. In another study 111 , the group compared the effect of PEN110 to gamma radiation on CMVinfected THP-1 cells, which are used to model latently infected white cells. In addition to demonstrating the efficiency of PEN110 against CMV-infected cells, the experiments demonstrated that gamma irradiation, despite inactivating white cells, has the capacity to actually increase CMV replication. PEN110 inactivation of bacteria has been successful, although limitations are evident. Bacterial contamination of blood generally occurs due to organisms on the skin of donors at the time of collection. The most common organisms are therefore skin contaminants, such as Staphylococcus epidemidis and Propionibacterium acnes. Other organisms ubiquitous in the environment are also common, such as Clostridium perfringens, Pseudomonas fluorescens, Pseudomonas putida, and Acinetobacter species. Yersinia entercolitica is also associated with transfusion-related sepsis and is thought to come from bacteremia in a donor with Yersinia gastroenteritis. In studies using various titers of these organisms to infect red blood cell units, PEN110 successfully inactivated the majority of the organisms. 112-114 However, some studies revealed that high titers of organisms could not be inactivated. Acinetobacter iwoffii and A. johnsonii were inactivated when the titer was less than 10 4 CFU/mL, but the bacteria persisted when units were infected with higher titers. 112 Y. enterocolitica and P. fluorescens have demonstrated similar resistance to inactivation at higher titers in other studies. 112 However, in an earlier study by the same group 115 , the titers (10-100 CFU) were chosen to simulate a worse-case scenario based on reported clinical levels detected in donated blood for Yersinia of 1 CFU/mL or lower. 115 If this level of bacteremia is the norm clinically, the lack of pathogen reduction at levels above 10 4 CFU/mL is not relevant. However, the question of an upper limit of effectiveness for this pathogen-reduction technology remains a concern. Importantly, the concentration level of pathogens in the blood may be dependent on the organism involved. PEN110 was able to inactivate Mycoplasma pneumonia and M. arthritidis by more than 10 7 CFU/mL. 113 Even if all of the organisms appear to be removed, however, they are only 'removed' to the level at which they can be detected. In protozoa studies, B. microti was eliminated below the level of detection by PEN110 and hamsters given the blood did not develop identifiable infection even by PCR testing. However, the hamsters did mount an IgG antibody response. This is not too surprising given that the inactivation occurs only on the nucleic acid level, leaving organism antigens in place. Other protozoa tested included P. falciparum and T. cruzi, which were effectively reduced by PEN110. 114 Summary PEN110 demonstrates robust viral and bacterial inactivation capacity. Using more sensitive PCR methods and high-and low-titer infections, investigators have revealed the higher and lower limits of this pathogen-reduction process. Given the cost of implementing any pathogen-reduction process, the hope would be that the process would reduce all pathogens to a non-infectious level despite the initial titer. Additional studies are needed to evaluate the pathogen-reduction process in clinical settings and under conditions involving mixtures of pathogens at clinically relevant levels in combination with the white cells present at different concentrations to determine the true capacity of these pathogen-reduction processes. The two phase III PEN110 studies involving patients requiring acute transfusion therapy for surgical support and chronic transfusion involving sickle-cell and thalassemia patients has been halted due to development of an immune response to PEN110-treated RBC and associated clinical findings. 112 Immunogenicity is thus a problem for the pathogen-reduction chemicals. Even if the number of events is very small, because the risk of immunogenicity must be smaller than the risk of infection by untreated blood which is very small, it will take more research over time to determine how safe and effective PR/PI technologies really are.",

At that time, the photodynamic reaction of riboflavin and light was known to generate superoxide anion radicals O K 2 and HO 2 , which damaged nucleic acids. Joshi demonstrated that singlet oxygen is also generated by these reactions, leading to photo-oxidation of the nucleotide guanine thus damaging nucleic acids. 120 Two types of photoreactions can occur. Type I is a photoreaction between an electronically excited photosensitizer and a biological substrate. This reaction is oxygen independent and the substrate of concern is nucleic acids, although other biologic molecules can be affected, as well. Type II is a reaction of an activated photosensitizer molecule with oxygen resulting in the formation of oxygen radicals. 120 The singlet oxygen radical is responsible for the majority of the damage to nucleic acids and results in strand breaks and fragmentation.",

Lumichrome and lumiflavin are the most abundant of these products; the others are present in small amounts best detected by HPLC. 118 Lumichrome toxicity and genotoxicity were evaluated in in vitro and in vivo experiments by Piper et al, in 2002. 122 In vitro genotoxicity was evaluated using the Ames assay 72, 122 and was negative. Mouse fibroblasts were incubated with various concentrations of lumichrome, the highest of which was 90 mM (the limit of solubility). Cytotoxicity was not identified. The in vivo portion of the study involved injecting mice with 900 mg/kg of lumichrome IV. No acute toxicity was identified. 122 The other major photo-product of riboflavin-lumiflavin-was evaluated by the Ames Salmonella assay, umu test, and SOS chromotest. The Ames and umu tests are bacterial genotoxicity test systems 123, 124 and the SOS chromotest is a bacterial colorimetric assay for genotoxins. 124 In this study, both riboflavin and lumiflavin were negative for genotoxicity. However, when lumiflavin was exposed to metabolic enzymes of the colon and liver, significant mutagenicity was identified by all three assays. The study was performed in order to ascertain the danger posed by riboflavin in food products. 125 Investigation of mutagenicity of lumiflavin has not yet been investigated in blood products.

Platelet units subjected to the riboflavin light process have a decreased concentration due to dilution with the 500-mM riboflavin solution. The total platelet count is unchanged and is similar to controls, remaining stable throughout storage. In one study, some in vitro performance characteristics in treated units were significantly different after 5 days of storage. 126 This difference appears to be due to metabolic changes, as the only parameter that changed significantly after photochemical treatment was a marked reduction in pO 2 and a mild increase in P-selectin expression. The treatment also appears to increase glucose consumption. Despite these differences, the parameters were still within the clinically relevant limits for use. In vivo studies will be necessary to determine the significance of the in vitro findings. 126 A recent study looked solely at the effect of the riboflavin and light process on platelets produced by the buffy coat method used commonly in Europe and platelets acquired via apheresis. Numerous platelet parameters including platelet integrity, morphology, and biological activity were examined. The results were similar to those of previous studies. 127 Again, there was a marked decrease in pO 2 after photochemical treatment, as expected given the mechanism of action of riboflavin and light. Glucose was decreased and P-selectin expression and lactate were increased after storage. pH was decreased over the storage period but remained above 7.0. Overall, there were changes in parameters compared to controls, but the numbers were still within defined clinical limits and suggested the platelets would be functional. 127 ",

            "text": "Investigations of the capacity of riboflavin and light to reduce pathogens without harming the product are in the early stages and have primarily involved use of the technology in platelet concentrates. One of the initial studies placed 10 mM riboflavin into the storage media and exposed them to 419 nm of visible light at 40 and 80 J/cm 2 energy dose. Bovine viral diarrheal virus (BVDV), a model for HCV, was used to infect the platelets. A 3.1 log reduction to the limit of detection was accomplished when the infection dose was 4.4 log (using 40 J/cm 2 energy dose), and a 6.6 log reduction was identified when the initial infection dose was 6.8 log (using 180 J/cm 2 energy dose). The platelet parameters in this study were minimally affected compared to controls. 128 Goodrich et al looked at bacterial pathogen reduction in platelets in 2002. 129 Riboflavin (50 mM) was added, and the units were spiked to 5-6 log/mL titers with S. epidermidis, Escherichia coli, S. aureus, B. cereus, and K. pneumoniae. Illumination this time was with 6-7 J/cm 2 of UV light. A low-titer experiment paralleled the above, spiking the units to 2 log/mL titers and using 7 J/cm 2 of UV light. Significant reduction occurred ranging from 3.1 to 5.5 log/mL reduction. Even the low titers were 100-1000 times higher than levels expected in platelets at the time of donation. Thus, the photoactivation of riboflavin appears to be adequate for pathogen reduction in blood products. 129 At the same time, an experiment investigated riboflavin and light in red blood cell units. Using a 500-mM riboflavin solution and 447 nm of visible light for illumination, the red cells spiked with HIV, BVDV, and PSR were treated. Again, significant pathogen reduction occurred. The only red cell parameter examined, hemolysis, was not observed in this experiment. 130 More extensive studies have been performed with a riboflavin level of 500 mm, which reaches 50 mM on dilution in the platelet concentrate. The light parameters chosen were UV light at 6.2 J/cm 2 with an output ranging from 265 to 370 nm. Porcine parvovirus (PPV) was added to achieve a titer of 6.68G0.20 log TCID 50 . Cellassociated and cell-free HIV were added to a titer of 7.93G0.27 log TCID 50 per milliliter, and intracellular HIV was added to a titer of 6.64G0.27 TCID 50 per milliliter. WNV was added to achieve an initial titer of 7.06G0.26 TCID 50 per milliliter. Interference and cytotoxicity were determined and factored into the results. Gramnegative bacteria represented by E. coli and Gram-positive bacteria represented by S. epidermidis were used to spike units to an initial titer of 5-6 CFUs/mL for the hightiter arm and 0.5-2 CFUs/mL for the low-titer arm. In vitro platelet parameters were measured and included pH, lactate, pO 2 , pCO 2 , platelet count, HSR, swirl scores, and P-selectin expression. The viral reduction levels observed exceeded the levels required to close the window period for HIV and reduced the titers of intracellular and free-and cell-associated HIV to below the levels of detection. The reduction in WNV occurred to an extent believed to close the total viremic period for WNV, due to inactivation of 5.11G0.5 log TCID 50 per milliliter. Parvovirus was also reduced to the level of detection with a reduction factor of O5.03 log TCID 50 . This amount of reduction could close the chronic phase transmission window for some human parvovirus B19 infections. This last virus is difficult to eradicate, as titers in infected donors can exceed 10 13 genome equivalents per milliliter. However, levels of B19 below 3.5 log/mL are thought not to be infectious. Both bacterial strains were reduced to below the level of detection in the high titer arm of the study. In the low titer arm, the concentrates remained culture negative after 5 days of storage. 126 Summary Riboflavin is photochemically activated by light and produces marked and robust pathogen reduction in platelets and red blood cells. The compound riboflavin is generally considered safe. Questions remain, however, regarding the photoproducts produced by this process; studies of the photoproducts are limited. Lumichrome appears to be safe in studies thus far, but more research is required. Lumiflavin is questionable and additional research will also be necessary. The early studies indicate that the effect of the process on platelets and red blood cells are clinically acceptable. More research on pathogen-reduction technology using riboflavin is needed.",

            "text": "An unintended, but beneficial, result of nucleic-acid-altering pathogen-reduction technologies is that the processes also inactivate white blood cells, which can cause transfusion-associated graft-versus-host disease (TA-GVHD). Several studies using mice have demonstrated the efficiency of pathogen-reduction technologies in preventing GVHD. Grass et al 131 compared amotosalen PCT and gamma irradiation in an experiment using strain A and B6AF1 mice. Strain A mice are homozygous at the H-2 locus whereas B6AF1 mice are heterozygous. Spleens from the donor mice were collected, processed to produce a splenocyte suspension, and treated in one of three ways. One-third of the suspension was treated with gamma irradiation, one-third was treated with amotosalen PCT, and one-third was untreated. The recipient mice (B6AF1 strain) each received transfusions of one of three suspensions or a suspension of splenocytes from another B6AF1 mouse, which were the controls. Several features of GVHD were followed over several weeks. Those that received untreated cells developed GVHD characterized by splenomegaly, decreased body weight, decreased skin integrity, and pancytopenia. After the animals were killed, the organs were examined histologically for evidence of GVHD. In addition, donor T cell engraftment was demonstrated by flow cytometry. None of the mice that received products treated by gamma irradiation or amotosalen PCT developed GVHD. All six mice that received the untreated product developed GVHD. 131 Additional mouse-based studies [132] [133] [134] demonstrated the efficiency of PEN110 in preventing GVHD. Riboflavin was demonstrated to be effective using a cell culture of Jurkat cells. 135 Thus, based on existing data, pathogen-reduction technologies that disrupt nucleic acids also appear to prevent TA-GVHD.",
