The biological activity of metal complexes is determined by the metal itself, its oxidation state, the types and number of coordinated ligands and their strength of binding, the geometry of the complex, redox potential and ligand exchange rates. For organic drugs a variety of readily observed spin I = 1/2 nuclei can be used ( 1 H, 13 C, 15 N, 19 F, 31 P), but only a few metals fall into this category. Most are quadrupolar nuclei giving rise to broad lines with low detection sensitivity (for biological systems). However we show that, in some cases, heteronuclear NMR studies can provide new insights into the biological and medicinal chemistry of a range of elements and these data will stimulate further advances in this area.",

            "text": "Bioinorganic chemistry is an interdisciplinary field that draws on disciplines such as biochemistry, inorganic and theoretical chemistry, molecular biology, biophysics and spectroscopy to address the key questions of how metals complement and mediate key biological processes [1] . About 24 elements are currently thought to be essential for mammalian life: H, C, N, O, F, Na, Mg, Si, P, S, Cl, K, Ca, V, Mn, Fe, Co, Ni, Cu, Zn, Se, Mo, Sn, I [2] , and 14 of them are metals or metalloids. However, this list may not be complete. For example, boron [3] and chromium may turn out to be essential, and it has been suggested that silicon is essential only to prevent aluminum from being toxic [4] . The biological roles of Cr are surrounded by controversy [5] . Currently, Cr(VI) compounds are among 88 recognized (class I) human carcinogens. By contrast, many nutritionists regard Cr(III) as an essential micronutrient, acting as an insulin-mimetic, although this opinion has been disputed. No Cr(III)-dependent biomolecules, such as enzymes or cofactors, have yet been unambiguously described.",

            "text": "Inorganic elements play crucial roles in biological processes, and amongst them, metal ions are essential components in all aspects of the chemistry of living organisms. In biological systems, metal ions exist as electron-deficient cations and, hence, are attracted by electron-rich biomolecules, such as proteins and DNA, thus providing innumerable examples of \"natural ligands\" that bind metal ions to perform important biological functions. Metals play diverse roles in almost all biological processes: as catalytic groups at the active sites of enzymes, stabilizing the tertiary structures of proteins and polynucleotides, and as second messengers interacting with a variety of different small molecules and receptors [6] . Although our understanding of the functions and mechanisms of action of metals has increased in the last decades, the mammalian biochemistry of several essential elements is poorly understood. For example, chromium, nickel and tin seem to be essential for life, but we do not know whether there are human genomic codes for them, or how to use them effectively in medicine, yet. For some elements the genetic code involves proteins which recognize specific metal complexes. For example, only one specific cobalt compound, the coenzyme vitamin B 12 , appears to be essential [7] , and in Escherichia coli the molybdate-dependent transcriptional regulator ModE acts as a sensor of intracellular molybdate ([MoO 4 ] 2\u2212 ) concentration and as a regulator for the transcription of several operons that control the uptake and utilization of molybdenum [8] . Zinc is essential for life, and is the second most abundant d-block metal ion in living organisms after iron. It has essentially two possible roles: catalytic or structural. Zinc may also modulate signaling events, as it occurs in processes maintaining zinc homeostasis. An attempt to compile a catalogue of proteins encoded by the human genome, which may require zinc for their physiological functions has been recently reported [9] . Some 10% of the proteins coded by the human genome (the proteome) potentially have zinc-binding sequences. Selenium provides a good example of the importance of speciation: it is an essential element and, yet, some of its compounds are highly toxic (e.g. H 2 Se). Genes which code for selenium incorporation into amino acids have been characterized [10] . Another important aspect concerning metal ions is that both essential and non-essential metals can be used in therapy and diagnosis, and examples of compounds in current clinical use are listed in Table 1 . As indicated in Fig. 1 , key areas in the design of active compounds are the control of toxicity (sideeffects) and targeting of the metal to specific tissues, organs, or cells where activity is needed. Metal ions can be introduced into a biological system either for therapeutic effect or as diagnostic aids. Alternatively, metal ions can be removed from a biological system by judicious use of metal-binding molecules (ligands) [11] . Thus, biomedical inorganic chemistry offers the potential for the design of novel therapeutic and diagnostic agents and for the treatment and understanding of diseases which are currently intractable [12] .",

Therefore, the growing interest in understanding the coordination chemistry of biometals, and the development of structure-based drug design of inorganic pharmaceuticals, requires suitable and reliable analytical tools to study the speciation of metal ions in biological systems. In this context, NMR spectroscopy is a powerful and versatile technique that can provide site-specific information about chemical bonding, structure and dynamics in molecular systems. Moreover, NMR spectroscopy is one of the two techniques, the other being X-ray crystallography, that can provide atomic level descriptions of the intermolecular receptor-metal ion interactions responsible for molecular recognition [13] . NMR spectroscopy is being applied to the study of an ever-increasing diversity of biological macromolecules. Advances in the field are allowing detailed structural investigations of proteins, nucleic acids and carbohydrates, including investigations of cells and perfused organs under living conditions, which allows quantification of the dynamic properties of metabolites as well as kinetics of enzymatic reactions at steady state or through real time monitoring [14] .",

Unfortunately, for a large number of biologically relevant elements, the only NMR-active isotopes are those with nuclear spins greater than one half. As a result, NMR spectroscopy of quadrupolar nuclei, such as 6 Li, 14 N (I = 1), 7 Li, 11 B, 23 Na, 33 S, 35 Cl, 39 K, 71 Ga, 87 Rb (I = 3/2), 17 O, 25 Mg, 27 Al, 67 Zn (I = 5/2), 43 Ca, 45 Sc, 51 V, 59 Co, 133 Cs, 139 La (I = 7/2), and 93 Nb (I = 9/2), became viewed as the \"poor relation\" of spin I = 1/2 nuclei.

            "text": "The development of metal (in particular transition metal) NMR spectroscopy has been very uneven because of the very small number of nuclei with favorable nuclear properties for high-resolution NMR. But as the technology evolves, more nuclei and bond types, and also the solid state, are being brought into the spectroscopist's net. The NMR properties of the nuclei with biological and/or medicinal interest are collected in Table 2 . Favorable properties for high-resolution NMR spectroscopy are spin quantum number I = 1/2 or, for I > 1/2, a relatively small value of the nuclear electric quadrupole moment (eQ) and a large value of I, to minimize quadrupolar broadening. Also necessary are a sufficiently large natural abundance (A) and magnetogyric ratio (\u03b3, effectively the ratio of the magnetic moment to the spin quantum number), to which the NMR frequency is proportional. The intrinsic NMR receptivity, which is a measure of the intensity of signal, increases as |\u03b3 3 |AI(I + 1). Thus, larger values of I are more favorable, by a factor of 33 from I = 1/2 to 9/2. Transition metal nuclei with natural abundance below 5% that may be usefully studied with enrichment are 57 Fe, 61 Ni, 67 For the majority of metal nuclei, the spin quantum number I is greater than 1/2 and, therefore, they possess a nuclear electric quadrupole moment eQ (in addition to their magnetic moment), as the nuclear electric charge distribution is not spherically symmetric. The electric quadrupole is coupled to the spin (magnetic dipole), since transitions in the one change the magnetic environment of the other. Whereas the orientation of the spin dipole is quantized relative to the magnetic field, that of the electric quadrupole is quantized relative to the electric field gradient 13 C is defined as the ratio R(X)/R( 13 C), where R( 13 C) is the absolute receptivity of 13 C at natural abundance. b Radioactive.",

Therefore, the nuclear energy levels depend on both the EFG and the magnetic field. In the liquid phase, rapid and isotropic molecular tumbling averages the quadrupolar (as well as the dipolar) interactions; but the relaxation of the electric quadrupole with fluctuations of the EFG (e.g. in molecular collisions) relaxes the nuclear spin as well, and fast relaxation leads to uncertainty over the line position, i.e. quadrupolar broadening. The quadrupolar relaxation rate and the line-width are proportional to \u03c7 2 (1 + \u03b7 2 /3)(2I + 3)/I 2 (2I \u2212 1) (where \u03b7 is the asymmetry parameter of the EFG, maximally equal to 1, and 0 for axial symmetry) and also to the rotational correlation time for isotropic tumbling (\u03c4 c = 4\u03c0\u03b7 0 r 3 /3k B T, where \u03b7 0 is the viscosity of the medium and r is the molecular radius). Thus, the quadrupolar broadening increases sharply with increase in Q and in the EFG q. Again, higher values of I are advantageous because of the line-width dependence on (2I + 3)/I 2 (2I \u2212 l), which decreases by a factor of 67.5 from I = 1 to 9/2 [17] .",

This is particularly true in environments where ionic motion is restricted, such as in biological systems. In general, quadrupolar nuclei display broad resonances in NMR spectra, unless they are in highly symmetric electrical environments, which reduce the magnitude of the electric field gradients at the nuclei (extreme narrowing conditions). Biological macromolecules which introduce high electric field gradients, in conjunction with non-averaging motional characteristics, can make quadrupolar interaction effective. However, the binding of quadrupolar metal ions can be studied by NMR spectroscopy, potentially even in cells. This is possible because the binding of metal ions to a biomolecule can cause a substantial increase in the effective correlation time (\u03c4 c ), thus leading to a measurable change in relaxation behavior of the ions.",

As brain Li cannot be monitored readily at present, it is a common practice to measure the concentration of the ions in the serum where repeated measurements can be made inexpensively. Moreover, because of the sedative and possible neurotoxic sideeffects of lithium, it is important to monitor and maintain the lithium concentration within the safe therapeutic range by measuring Li + concentrations in serum or plasma. Although plasma lithium values are used to monitor the therapy, the lithium in red blood cells may be a better predictor of Li + concentrations in the brain than serum levels [28] . 7 Li NMR spectroscopy is a valuable analytical tool to quantify Li in whole blood, plasma, or RBCs. In a recent study [29] , male Sprague-Dawley rats were treated with different amounts of Li 2 CO 3 ; 24 h after drug administration, blood was drawn from the rats via cardiac puncture, and aliquots, mixed with a known amount of anticoagulant (citrate phosphate dextrose) and 20 mg of a shift reagent ([Tm(DOTP)] 5\u2212 , thulium(III)-1,4,7,10-tetraazacyclododecane-1,4,7,10-tetrakis(methylenephosphonate)), 7 Li NMR provided a clear discrimination between plasma and RBC lithium signals. The 7 Li spectrum (obtained in 30 min) in Fig. 2 shows two peaks \u223c13 ppm apart corresponding to plasma (extracellular) and RBC (intracellular) lithium. Quantification of lithium was achieved by comparing peak intensities with standards prepared using blood from untreated rats, and the results showed excellent agreement (less than 0.1% average difference) with other commonly employed techniques, confirming that 7 Li NMR spectroscopy has the potential to become routine for lithium analysis. Moreover, this technique has the advantage of reduced pre-analytical preparation time and small blood samples with lithium concentration in the neighborhood of 0.08 mequiv. L \u22121 can be measured with high accuracy and reproducibility needed for clinical purposes.",

In several diseases or pathological states (hypertension, cystic fibrosis, oncogenesis, infected cells) a change in this equilibrium occurs due to abnormalities in ion-binding sites or in transport processes across the membrane. Sodium relaxation studies can provide qualitative information on the interaction of Na + ions with molecules [32] . NMR relaxation techniques are able to discriminate between different adjacent sodium ion compartments, whether or not they are physically separated, as long as they display different molecular motions and, thus, induce different relaxation characteristics. The use of multiple echoes to provide relaxation information has greatly increased the usefulness of 23 Na NMR spectroscopy, and the use of paramagnetic shift reagents or contrast reagents allows the differentiation of intra-and extracellular sodium pools, but toxicity of the currently available shift reagents may be problematic. In instances where toxicity is not a severe problem, shift reagents have been used to monitor fluid dynamics as well as to distinguish different sodium pools, and this method has been mostly applied to cell suspensions, kidney tubules, glands and small organs [33] . For example, the shift reagent dysprosium(III)-tripolyphosphate ([Dy(PPP) 2 ] 7\u2212 ) was used in experiments with sequential frequency-selective radiofrequency pulses to excite selectively the well-resolved resonances of shifted and unshifted sodium and produce separate images of the different sodium pools. This technique depends on the complete resolution of the sodium resonances and requires separate experiments for each sodium species. The less toxic shift reagents dysprosium(III)-triethylenetetraminehexaacetate ([Dy(TTHA)] 3\u2212 ) and [Tm(DOTP)] 5\u2212 have also been employed, but they do not produce fully resolved intracellular and extracellular sodium resonances. Nonetheless, these experiments allowed the simultaneous generation of separate images of the intracellular and extracellular sodium pools, and, therefore, the direct monitoring of the movement of sodium on a regional basis.",

These methods yield estimates of the relaxation rate constants, the fraction of bound ions, the binding constants, the rotational correlation time (\u03c4 c ), and the quadrupolar coupling constant of the nucleus in its bound state. For example, Torres et al. have determined the apparent binding constants (K f ) for Na + and a protein, bovine serum albumin (BSA), a nucleic acid yeast RNA, and a self-associating macroassembly, the detergent sodium dodecyl sulfate (SDS) using the relaxation behavior of selected 23 Na + magnetization coherences [34] . These three macromolecular systems were chosen as representatives of different classes of biomolecules that are likely to have diverse Na + -binding environments. The relaxation analysis provided 23 Na NMR spectra of d(TG 4 T) obtained on a Bruker Avance-600 spectrometer (B 0 = 14.1 T). An inversion-recovery sequence was used to partially suppress the large signal from the free Na + ions. A recovery delay of 13 ms (close to the null point) was used. Typically, 250k scans were accumulated with a recycle time of 50 ms. The d(TG 4 T) DNA sample was prepared at 8 mM strand concentration in 10 mM sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.1) and 100 mM NaCl.

On the basis of these studies, two types of alkali metal-binding sites are generally found in G-quadruplex structures, one type being loosely coordinated to phosphate groups, and the other residing inside the G-quadruplex channel. The latter type of alkali metal cations is tightly bound to the G-quadruplex structure and has long been considered to be \"invisible\" to NMR spectroscopy in solution. In this context, Won et al. [36] have reported the first direct solution NMR detection of the Na + residing inside G-quadruplex channel structures formed by 5 -GMP and the DNA oligomer, d(TG 4 T). Fig. 3a shows 23 Na NMR spectra for 0.80 M Na 2 (5 -GMP) in an aqueous solution at pH 8. The signal centered at 0 ppm exhibits a bi-Lorentzian line-shape, which is due to a slow exchange of Na + cations between phosphate-bound and free states. The small peak at \u221217 ppm is due to the Na + cations residing inside the 5 -GMP channel. The signal intensity for the channel Na + cations decreases as the sample temperature is increased from 278 to 308 K, an indication of \"melting\" of the 5 -GMP aggregates. Analogously (b), 23 Na NMR spectra of d(TG 4 T) show the channel Na + signal at \u221217 ppm but, in this case, the total integrated area for this signal remains approximately unchanged between 278 and 293 K, indicating that the G-quadruplex structure of d(TG 4 T) does not melt at 293 K. These findings open up many new possibilities in the study of cation binding and transport dynamics in G-quadruplex DNA. For example, it might now be possible not only to monitor cation transport through a Gquadruplex channel, but also to measure cation-binding affinity for the channel site in a direct and site-specific manner.",

            "text": "Together with K + , Mg 2+ is one of the major intracellular ions (typically 30 mM), and is 90% bound to ribosomes (complexes of RNA and proteins that mediate protein synthesis). Magnesium is vital to the regulation of the structures of tRNA and rRNA [54] and is an essential cofactor for many RNA and DNA processing enzymes [55] and for those enzymes using ATP, ADP, or AMP as substrates [56] . As metallotherapeutic drugs, magnesium salts are frequently prescribed to treat diseases such as gestational hypertension, preeclampsia and eclampsia, asthma, strokes, acute myocardial infarction, and arrhythmias [57] . Magnesium readily forms complexes with biological substrates and may serve to either define a particular conformation or catalytically activate chemical functionality toward reaction. The role of the metal ion is critically dependent on the coordination environment that it adopts, and so it is useful to understand the binding chemistry of Mg 2+ in a biological context. 25 Mg is a spin I = 5/2 nucleus, and the interaction of its quadrupole moment with electric field gradients provides a very effective relaxation mechanism [58] . The observed line-shapes are sensitive to the motional and exchange dynamics of the Mg 2+ ions, and thus provide insights into the interaction between Mg 2+ and the various biomolecules. Given its low natural abundance (10.13%) and low receptivity (relative to 13 C), the use of iso- Table 3 Determination of kinetic and thermodynamic parameters for Mg 2+ binding to phosphate-containing ligands by 25 Mg NMR spectroscopy topically enriched 25 Mg 2+ allowed a total line-shape analysis of 25 Mg NMR spectra to determine the association constant (K a ), the free energy of activation ( G*), outer-sphere association constants (K os ), and off-rate (k off ) and on-rate (k on ) for magnesium binding to several biologically relevant macromolecules, as summarized in Table 3 [59] . This work has provided a detailed knowledge of the coordination chemistry of Mg 2+ with polyphosphate anions, supporting the outer-sphere coordination of [Mg(H 2 O) 6 ] 2+ to RNA, and suggesting that magnesium binding to a terminal phosphate leads to facile protonation of an inner phosphate that results in a reactive pyrophosphate-type center. 25 Mg NMR has also been used to investigate the interaction between Mg 2+ and calmodulin (a calcium-binding protein that can bind to and regulate a multitude of different protein targets, thereby affecting many different cellular functions) [60] . Tsai et al. demonstrated that Mg 2+ shows opposite site preference relative to Ca 2+ and binds to sites I and II of calmodulin with a binding constant of \u223c2000 M \u22121 , whereas it binds weakly to sites III and IV. Since the intracellular concentration of Mg 2+ is higher than that of Ca 2+ , they hypothesized that sites I and II are constantly occupied by Mg 2+ at the resting state. Analogously, the interactions between Mg 2+ and other biomolecules, such as adenylate kinase (a phosphotransferase enzyme requiring Mg 2+ to catalyze the production of ATP from ADP) [61] and several biological polyelectrolytes [62] , have been studied by 25 Mg NMR spectroscopy. In both cases, it was demonstrated that magnesium ions bind loosely to the investigated actin filaments, and thus show a behavior typical of counter-ions.",

A combination of rapid exchange kinetics and strong ligand binding allows Ca 2+ to be an effective trigger ion for the activation of biological reactions. Many processes of signal transduction involve the release of calcium ions as one part of an interconnected set of pathways. Increases in intracellular Ca 2+ are sensed by a family of calcium-binding proteins. A prototypical member of this family is calmodulin, which couples changes in the intracellular calcium concentration to the state of activation of a variety of enzymes, such as protein kinases, NAD kinase, and phosphodiesterases, as well as some Ca 2+ -ATPases [64] . 43 Ca is a spin I = 7/2 nucleus and is the only spectroscopically observable isotope of this biologically important element. The NMR properties of 43 Ca are unfavorable due to its low resonance frequency, low natural abundance (0.145%), and the fact that magnetic relaxation is dominated by the quadrupole relaxation, thus explaining the paucity of data available. Nevertheless, 43 Ca NMR has provided a few insights into the structural and motional characteristics of calcium-binding sites in a number of calcium-binding proteins [65] . In general it is extremely difficult to observe directly NMR signals from quadrupolar ions bound to proteins. If there is a reasonably fast chemical exchange of ions between the bulk solution and the protein-binding sites valuable information about the ion binding can be obtained. For example, the 43 Ca NMR signals from Ca 2+ ions bound to the Cabinding proteins parvalbumin, troponin-c and calmodulin have been observed [66] . The observation was made possible through the use of isotopically enriched 43 Ca 2+ . The chemical shift of 43 Ca 2+ ion bound to the three proteins is ca. +60 ppm (relative to free Ca 2+ ions in aqueous solution), and all have a similar magnitude of the quadrupole coupling constant. This observation supports the argument that the Ca 2+ -binding sites in these proteins have the same arrangements of oxygen ligands coordinated to the Ca 2+ ion. A similar study has been carried out to evaluate the exchange rates and the binding constants of Ca 2+ ions to the high-affinity and low-affinity binding sites on calmodulin [67] . The temperature dependence of the 43 Ca NMR signals showed that the two classes of sites have exchange rates differing by a factor of about 40 at room temperature. At temperatures \u226430 \u2022 C, only the two sites with fast exchange (i.e. the low-affinity sites) were probed by 43 Ca NMR.",

An example is given in Fig. 8 . Upon addition of the isotopically enriched 43 Ca to equine lysozyme, a broad peak ( \u03bd 1/2 = 253 Hz) appears at \u22125.3 ppm, and the signal increases linearly in intensity up to 1 equiv. of metal ion. This resonance corresponds to calcium bound to the single high-affinity calcium site in this protein. In the presence of excess metal ion, a sharp signal ( \u03bd 1/2 = 10 Hz) is also observed at l ppm, in the vicinity of free calcium. All proteins were found to contain one high-affinity calcium-binding site. The chemical shifts, line-widths, relaxation times, and quadrupolar coupling constants for the respective 43 Ca NMR signals were quite similar; this is indicative of a high degree of homology between the strong calcium-binding sites of these four proteins. The measured chemical shifts (\u03b4 = \u22123 to \u22127 ppm) and quadrupolar coupling constants (\u03c7 = 0.7-0.8 MHz) are quite distinct from those observed for typical EF-hand calcium-binding proteins, suggesting a different geometry for the calcium-binding loops. The correlation times for bound calcium ions in these proteins are in the range of 4-8 ns, indicating that the flexibilities of these binding sites are limited. Evidence for the existence of a second weak calcium-binding site was obtained for bovine \u2423-lactalbumin, but not for the other investigated proteins.",

            "text": "Boron is regarded as a non-essential element for mammalian life, even if it may turn out to be a necessary \"ultratrace\" element [3] . The main medicinal application of boron is the tumor-targeted delivery of boron derivatives for boron neutron capture therapy (BNCT) [69] . This therapy is based on the nuclear reaction that occurs when 10 B, a stable isotope, is irradiated with neutrons of the appropriate energy to produce 11 B in an unstable form, which then undergoes instantaneous nuclear fission to produce high-energy alpha particles and recoiling 7 Li nuclei ( 10 B + n th \u2192 [ 11 B] \u2192 \u2423 + 7 Li). These heavy charged particles have pathlengths of approximately one cell diameter (10-14 m) and deposit most of their energy within the boroncontaining cells. If enough low-energy thermal neutrons (n th ) reach the treatment volume, and 10 B is selectively delivered to tumor cells in amounts higher than in the surrounding normal tissues, then they can be destroyed as a result of the 10 B(n,\u2423) 7 Li capture reaction that causes local tumor cell necrosis. In theory, BNCT provides a means for the specific molecular and cellular targeting of high linear energy transfer radiation to tumor cells with the concomitant sparing of normal cells. BNCT has been used clinically to treat patients with brain cancers, such as glioblastoma multiforme, with high-grade gliomas, and a much smaller number with primary and metastatic melanoma. Delivery vehicles synthesized for this application include sodium borocaptate (BSH, Na 2 B 12 H 11 SH), boranophosphonates and boranobis(phosphonates), and boranophosphateoligodeoxynucleotides, in which BH 3 is linked to the phosphate backbone of antisense oligodeoxynucleotides [70] .",

Even though 10 B is the active nucleus for neutron capture in BNCT, the more sensitive 11 B is more appropriate in NMR studies, and the isotopic difference does not alter either the structure and binding or the pharmacokinetic effects of the agent. Both 10 B (I = 3) and 11 B (I = 3/2) are quadrupolar nuclei and their relaxation times in common BNCT agents in biological environments are rather short. NMR research efforts have primarily been applied in two directions: first, to investigate the metabolism and pharmacokinetics of BNCT agents in vivo, and, second, to use localized NMR spectroscopy and/or MRI for non-invasive mapping of the administered molecules in treated animals or patients. While the first goal can be pursued using 11 B NMR for natural abundance samples, molecules used in BNCT are >95% enriched in 10 B, and must be therefore detected by 10 B NMR.

The 12 boron nuclei of BSH can be classified into four groups, each showing a welldefined chemical shift (Fig. 9 ). Covalent binding of BSH to a large protein changes the chemical environment around the 11 B nuclei causing changes in both the chemical shifts (the formation of a disulfide bridge between BSH and serum albumin moves the 11 B chemical shift of the S-attached boron atom, labeled as B 1 in Fig. 9 , ca. 3 ppm downfield) and the relaxation rates of the quadrupolar nuclei. However, the observation of no chemical shift change under the employed experimental conditions, the measured values of relaxation rates, and the calculated binding parameters indicated a non-covalent binding between BSH and serum albumin (bovine, human or dog). The nature of this interaction may, in part, be electrostatic. Bound and free BSH are in fast exchange at temperatures between 295 and 310 K, and the number of BSH-binding sites on these proteins is about 3-5.",

Ionic interactions with the surface of the cytochrome are believed to play a significant role in the direction of the interaction between the cytochrome and the enzymatic aggregates, cytochrome reductase and oxidase, thus influencing the efficiency of electron transfer [74] . Cytochrome-c is known to bind small anions, including metabolites such as phosphate ions and ATP. This interaction affects the mobility of the electron carrier protein and has been interpreted as an extra role for the protein as an ion carrier. The binding of borate ion to cytochrome's surface has been studied by 11 B NMR [75] . Fig. 10a shows the 11 B spectrum at 11.4 T of a 100 mM borate solution with 4 mM ferricytochrome-c at pH 9.7 and 5 \u2022 C. The large peak at 7.1 ppm (peak z) has the same shift as that of the weighted average of 70% B(OH) 4 \u2212 exchanging with 30% of B(OH) 3 . The peaks at 2.1 (peak y) and 1.8 (peak x) ppm are assigned to B(OH) 4 \u2212 specifically bound to two conformations of ferricytochrome-c that are present at pH 9.7 [76] . The assignment is based on the chemical shift which is similar to that of free B(OH) 4 \u2212 (2.0 ppm), and the narrow line-width of 14 Hz which is consistent with the tetrahedral symmetry of this species [76] . The peak at around 6 ppm (peak w) in Fig. 10a is presently unassigned. A multiple quantum filtered (MQF) NMR experiment yields a spectrum with three peaks (b) , two at the specific binding site at around 2 ppm and one at the chemical shift of the borate/boric acid bulk peak at 7.1 ppm, suggesting two different types of binding sites designated as I (for slowly exchanging borate ion) and II (for fast exchanging borate ion and boric acid), respectively. Thus, detection of binding by MQF NMR experiments proved to be sensitive to fast exchanging ligands as well as to very weak binding that could not be detected using conventional single-quantum methods.",

It is a non-essential element that during the last three decades has been recognized as a potentially toxic element linked to neurological problems, especially dialysis encephalopathy, and possibly Alzheimer's disease, and also to some bone disorders and problems in the hematopoietic system, muscles and joints [77] . The normal blood plasma aluminum concentration is about 0.005 mg L \u22121 . Blood contains less than 1% of the aluminum body burden, of which about 80% is bound to proteins. It accumulates mainly in the liver, bones and spleen of humans and animals. Because of its low solubility in solution under neutral conditions, Al was regarded as a non-toxic element and its environmental and biological effects were not investigated until recently. But due to the increasing acidity of the environment and concomitant dissolution of aluminum minerals, the concentration of this element in fresh waters can increase considerably. On the other hand, aluminum-based drugs are sold as antacids ([Al(OH) 3 ], [Al 2 (CO 3 ) 3 ]) and in the treatment of malaria ([Al(OH) 3 ]). Three aluminum salts (alum, [Al(OH) 3 ], [Al(PO 4 )]) have been also added to many vaccines, including widely used formulations for diphtheria, hepatitis B and tetanus, as adjuvant (\"vaccine boosters\") [78] . Moreover, the magnetic resonance characteristics of this nuclide also make it suitable for medical applications ( 27 Al-based MRI is feasible) [79] . 27 Al is more amenable to NMR studies than its congeners due to a higher receptivity and the existence of only one isotope. Another attractive feature of this nucleus is the relatively small quadrupole moment associated with its high nuclear spin (I = 5/2). These two favorable factors result in a much higher relative peak height (by one order of magnitude or more compared to the other elements of Group 13) . This means that sufficient signal-to-noise ratios can be obtained even with dilute (\u223c0.01 M) solutions of aluminum compounds. 27 Al line-widths may vary from 3 Hz to several kHz, and the signal may even completely vanish into the baseline noise in some instances. This negative aspect of quadrupolar relaxation is counterbalanced by the additional information obtained concerning molecular symmetries from the magnitude of quadrupolar line-broadenings. The range of 27 Al NMR chemical shifts is about 450 ppm.",

Transferrin is too big for complete structural determination in solution by current multidimensional NMR techniques ( 1 H NMR signals are intrinsically broad due to slow molecular tumbling), but 27 Al NMR can be used to investigate directly the metals in their specific binding sites and to reveal subtle inter-site differences [80] . Human serum transferrin (Fig. 11) is the protein that transports Fe 3+ ions and it is a member of a small group of monomeric nonheme proteins (MW \u223c76-81 kDa), which includes lactoferrin, ovotransferrin and melanotransferrin. It has two binding sites for ferric ions (these are found in a six-coordinate, distorted octahedral coordination geometry) which are identified as Cterminal and N-terminal sites. Two tyrosines, one histidine and one aspartate constitute four protein ligands for the metal ion, which requires a synergistic anion for the formation of stable transferrin complexes. In vivo bidentate CO 3 2\u2212 serves this purpose by coordinating directly to the metal in the fifth and sixth coordination positions. Since serum transferrin is normally only about 30% saturated with iron, it retains a relatively high capacity for binding to other metal ions. Vogel and Aramini demonstrated the feasibility of using 27 Al NMR to probe the binding of Al 3+ to ovotransferrin and its halfmolecules in the presence of carbonate or oxalate as synergistic anions [81] . The ovotransferrin-bound 27 Al NMR signals have some rather unusual properties characteristic of quadrupolar nuclei bound in slow exchange to large macromolecules far from extreme narrowing conditions. First, the maximum intensity of the protein-bound 27 Al signal is substantially lower than that observed for equimolar solutions of the free metal ion. Second, the signals exhibit a unique pulse angle dependence where a maximum in peak intensity is attained at pulse lengths that are less than half the 90 \u2022 pulse for an aqueous Al 3+ solution. Third, 27 Al signals for Al 3+ bound to the half-molecules of ovotransferrin are much broader than those for the intact protein, reflecting the importance of molecular motion on the detectability of quadrupolar nuclei. Fourth, an increase in the external magnetic field strength causes line narrowing and a 2-4 ppm downfield dynamic frequency shift (Fig. 12) [82] . These data are all consistent with the idea that only the central (1/2 \u2192 \u22121/2) transition of the 27 Al nucleus is observed. The chemical shifts of the 27 Al signals from Al 2 -ovotransferrin were found to be within the range +40 to \u221246 ppm, which is in accordance with a sixcoordinate (octahedral) Al complex. From these assignments and titration experiments it was found that in the presence of carbonate the N-terminal site of ovotransferrin binds Al 3+ with a higher affinity than does the C-site. However, changing the synergistic anion to oxalate alters the specificity (Fig. 13) [81].",

In membrane systems, Al 3+ ion binds strongly to the phosphate head groups of the membrane lipids. The neuro- Fig. 11 . Backbone structure of human serum transferrin (coordinates supplied by Zuccola [245] ); only the C-lobe site is occupied by iron in this structure. toxicity of Al 3+ is also manifested by inhibiting certain enzymes, such as ATPase. It is possible that the Al 3+ ion, once bound to ATP, interferes with Mg 2+ so that any consequent reactions requiring Mg 2+ -ATP complex participation are inhibited. This has prompted the study of the binding of Al 3+ to ATP by 27 Al NMR. The line-widths of these complexes typically fall within the range 150-500 Hz. Detellier and co-workers [83] studied these interactions at pH 7.4 using multinuclear NMR spectroscopy. The 27 Al NMR study allowed them to identify two complexes coexisting in equilibrium: 2:1 [Al(ATP) 2 ] and 1:1 [Al(ATP)] complexes. 27 Al NMR spectroscopy has also been employed to study aluminum-containing complexes present in natural waters [77] . For example, Casey and co-workers studied the rates of solvent exchange in aqueous Al 3+ -maltolate complexes [84] . Maltolate is a natural product that can be isolated from larch trees but is now widely used as a food additive. It is soluble in water, and tris complexes of Al 3+ with this ligand are toxic and cause brain disease. With the help of a multi-temperature 27 Al NMR study, it was shown that the maltolate labilizes the inner-sphere water molecules of Al 3+ complexes to an extent similar to other bidentate ligands, such as methylmalonate, dicarboxylate and carboxylate plus phenolic ligands. Coordination of a single maltolate ligand into the inner-coordination sphere of [Al(H 2 O) 6 ] 3+ increases the exchange rate of the remaining bound water molecules with bulk solution by a factor of \u223c10 2 . Addition of a second ligand, to form the bis-bidentate complex, [Al(maltolate) 2 (H 2 O) 2 ] + , increases the rate by an additional factor of 6-7.",

Gallium is present in human tissues at a level of only 10 \u22124 to 10 \u22123 ppm [85] . It has two naturally occurring isotopes ( 69 Ga, 60.4%; 71 Ga, 39.6%) and 13 radioactive nuclides. 67 Ga (\u2425, t 1/2 = 3.25 days) and 68 Ga (\u2424 + , t 1/2 = 68 min) are two radioisotopes with appropriate energies and half-lives for \u2425-scintigraphy and positron emission tomography (PET), respectively. As well as imaging applications, the Auger electrons emitted by 67 Ga possess potent cytotoxicity pointing towards potential therapeutic applications of the radionuclide, while the positrons emitted by 68 Ga may also have therapeutic applications in the prevention of restenosis by intracoronary radiation therapy [86] . Although most reports of gallium pharmaceutical chemistry concern applications of its radioisotopes, the tumor-seeking and antineoplastic properties of Ga 3+ were recognized 30 years ago. The safety and activity of simple gallium salts, mainly intravenous gallium nitrate, have been extensively studied in clinical trials since 1975 [87] . Development of anticancer gallium complexes has been pursued as a strategy to circumvent the limitations faced with simple gallium salts. In particular, efforts to improve the bioavailability of gallium via the oral route have recently led to the selection of the complexes tris(8quinolinolato)gallium(III) (KP46) [88] and tris(3-hydroxy-2methyl-4H-pyran-4-onato)gallium(III) (gallium maltolate) [89] for clinical studies.",

Its radioisotopes are administered to the patients in the form of stable chelates [86] . 69/71 Ga (I = 3/2) and 113/115 In (I = 9/2) are NMR-active isotopes. They are characterized by a high sensitivity to detection by NMR and large chemical shift ranges, two factors that make their study relatively easy. 71 Ga has higher receptivity and narrower line-widths than 69 Ga, which means that 71 Ga is usually the more favorable isotope for direct NMR observations despite its lower natural abundance. The chemical shift range of the gallium nucleus is approximately 1400 ppm [90] . 113 In and 115 In have large quadrupole moments which make their line-widths very sensitive to the environmental symmetry of the indium nucleus. The low receptivity of 113 In accounts for the lack of NMR studies based on this nuclide. The chemical shift range of the indium nucleus is approximately 1100 ppm [91] . Gallium-and indium-based radiopharmaceuticals are generally chelated with suitable ligands that form kinetically and thermodynamically stable complexes in vivo. Triazamacrocyclic ligands with different types of pendant arms often prove to be suitable. The thermodynamic stability of gallium and indium complexes with potential applications in imaging and radioimmunotherapy has been widely investigated in vitro and in vivo by NMR.

            "text": "The redox chemistry of thallium is considerably different from that of the other elements of the group; under standard conditions the most stable oxidation state is Tl + , although Tl 3+ may also exist under biological conditions [77] . Thallium salts are poisonous due to the ability of the thallous ion to mimic alkali metal ions, especially K + [92] . 203 Tl and 205 Tl are the only non-quadrupolar NMR-active nuclei in the Group 13 family, and have high receptivities, 203 Tl being only slightly less receptive than 31 P, while 205 Tl, the third most receptive spin I = 1/2 nuclide, is twice as receptive as 31 P. Because of its similarity to the alkali metal ions, Tl + has potential as a probe for Na + and K + in biological systems. Like 27 Al, 205 Tl NMR can be used to investigate directly the specific binding sites of transferrins. Due to its high receptivity, 205 Tl NMR signals of protein-bound Tl ions can be observed even at mM concentrations. The first 205 Tl NMR study of human serum transferrin was reported over 20 years ago by Bertini et al. [93] . These authors showed that 205 Tl NMR is a convenient probe to monitor the occupancy of the two available transferrins and characterized the dithallium(III)-transferrin and the monothallium derivatives with bicarbonate as synergistic ion. The high affinity of the protein for trivalent metal ions was thought to be responsible for the stabilization of the 3+ oxidation state of the metal. Two distinct 205 Tl NMR signals (at +2075 and +2055 ppm downfield from an aqueous solution of Tl + at infinite dilution) of similar shape were found for the (Tl(III)) 2 -transferrin derivative at physiological pH. The two signals are relatively broad ( \u03bd 1/2 \u2248 100 Hz) and show a different pH dependence (the signal at +2055 ppm was shown to be more resistant to acidification). At physiological pH the Tl 3+ ion was shown to bind sequentially to the two sites; the signal at +2055 ppm appeared first and was assigned to Tl 3+ bound to the acid-resistant C-terminal site. The signal at +2075 ppm was assigned to Tl 3+ bound to the N-terminal site. Using 13 C NMR spectroscopy to study the 205 Tl-transferrin-13 CO 3 derivative, the same group showed that the 13 C nucleus of the synergistic anion is strongly magnetically coupled to the 205 Tl nucleus so that its 13 C signal is split into a doublet. So, the 13 C NMR spectrum of 205 Tl 2 -transferrin-( 13 CO 3 ) 2 would originate from the superposition of two doublets, the extent of the coupling constants (290 and 265 Hz) being typical of a 2 J( 205 Tl-13 C) coupling. This result constituted evidence of carbonate coordination to the metal [94] . Similar experiments were carried out by Aramini and Vogel to investigate the binding of 205 Tl to chicken ovotransferrin in the presence of carbonate as the synergistic anion [95] . Two 205 Tl NMR signals due to the bound metal ion in the two high-affinity iron-binding sites of the protein where detected, and, from titration studies, it was demonstrated that Tl 3+ shows no site preference in ovotransferrin. Again, when 13 C-labelled carbonate was used, two closely spaced doublets in the carbonyl region of the 13 C NMR spectrum of ovotransferrin were recorded due to spin-spin coupling between the bound metal ion and carbonate (ranging from 2 J( 205 Tl-13 C) = 270 to 290 Hz).",

Pyruvate kinase from almost all sources requires monovalent and divalent metal ions. Potassium is the physiologically important cation, but numerous 1+ cations, including Tl + , can activate this enzyme. TlNO 3 activates pyruvate kinase to 80-90% activity compared to KCl in the presence of Mn(NO 3 ) 2 as the activating 2+ cation. At higher concentrations of Tl + , enzyme inhibition is observed, and the extent of this inhibition is dependent on the nature and concentration of the divalent cation. The effect of Mn 2+ on the 1/T 1 and 1/T 2 values of 205 Tl + in the presence of yeast pyruvate kinase was determined by 205 Tl NMR spectroscopy. The temperature dependence of the relaxation rates indicates that fast exchange conditions prevail for 205 Tl + longitudinal relaxation rates. The distance between Tl + and Mn 2+ at the active site of yeast pyruvate kinase was calculated from the paramagnetic contribution of Mn 2+ to the longitudinal relaxation rates of Tl + bound to yeast pyruvate kinase. 205 Tl + NMR spectroscopy has been also used to monitor possible structural alterations introduced at the active site of yeast pyruvate kinase by mutation of Thr298 [97] . The Tl + -Mn 2+ distances at the active site of yeast pyruvate kinase have been calculated from the paramagnetic contribution of Mn 2+ to the longitudinal relax-ation rates of 205 Tl + bound to several complexes of the Thr298 mutants and to wild type yeast pyruvate kinase. The primary results of these studies demonstrated that mutations of Thr298 in yeast pyruvate kinase result in changes in the interactions between the monovalent cation and the divalent cation. These cations interact with the phosphoryl group of the substrate at the active site of the enzyme. : Group 14 (Si, Ge, Sn, Pb) ",

When either halogen or oxygen atoms are asymmetrically substituted, as in 1-bromo-1-methylgermacyclohexane, excessive broadening takes place to such an extent that observation of signals is impossible [101] . As far as we know, no 73 Ge NMR studies on biologically relevant systems have been reported to date.",

This is because of the reasonably favorable magnetic properties of tin nuclei. Tin has no less than 10 natural isotopes, among which three have non-zero spin, all I = 1/2. Among these, 115 Sn is the least NMR favorable isotope, because of its extremely low natural abundance (0.35%). As a result, it has only rarely been studied, e.g. to overcome difficulties in unraveling strongly coupled homonuclear n J( 119 Sn-119 Sn) scalar coupling satellites in ditin compounds [105] . The \"twins\" 117 Sn and 119 Sn nuclei have rather similar properties, but 119 Sn NMR spectroscopy is, nevertheless, by far the most widely used in tin chemistry because of both its slightly higher magnetic moment and natural abundance. Thus, not surprisingly, the use of NMR in tin chemistry has been abundantly reviewed (e.g. [106] ). The use of 117/119 Sn NMR spectroscopy to investigate the interaction between organotin complexes and biomolecules such as amino acids, peptides, carbohydrates, nucleic acids, and DNA, has been recently and extensively reviewed, including equilibrium, structural and biological studies [107] , and will not be further discussed in this paper.",

            "text": "The toxicological properties of lead have spurred a number of investigations into the interactions of this metal ion with various proteins [113] . For example, Pb 2+ can bind very tightly to, and even displace Ca 2+ from, calmodulin, calbindin and troponin-c. Moreover, Pb 2+ can substitute Ca 2+ in the activation of several enzymes, including protein kinase-c, phosphodiesterase, and myosin light chain kinase, the latter two in a calmodulindependent manner. Therefore, model systems are needed for lead bound to Ca-binding sites in proteins, as these interactions are thought to account for lead's toxicity. For example, the highaffinity Ca 2+ -binding sites of carp (pI 4.25) and pike (pI 5.0) parvalbumins, as well as those of mammalian calmodulin and its C-terminal tryptic half-molecule (TR 2 C), have been investigated by 207 Pb NMR spectroscopy [114] . For the parvalbumins, two 207 Pb signals are observed ranging in chemical shift from +750 to +1260 ppm downfield of aqueous [Pb(NO 3 ) 2 ], corresponding to 207 Pb 2+ bound to the two high-affinity helix-loop-helix Ca 2+ -binding sites in each of these proteins. Four 207 Pb signals, which fall in the same chemical shift window, can be discerned for calmodulin (Fig. 14) . Experiments on TR 2 C allowed the assignment of each signal as due to 207 Pb 2+ occupying a helix-loop-helix site in either the N-or the C-lobe of the intact protein (Fig. 14) . 207 Pb and 1 H NMR titration studies on calmodulin have provided evidence that Pb 2+ binding to all four sites occurs simultaneously, in contrast to the behavior of this protein in the presence of Ca 2+ . The large chemical shift dispersion observed for the 207 Pb signals of the three investigated proteins illustrates the remarkable sensitivity of this parameter to subtle differences in the chemical environment of the protein-bound 207 Pb nucleus.",

Despite the different spin quantum numbers, 121 Sb (I = 5/2) and 123 Sb (I = 7/2) nuclei have rather similar properties, but 121 Sb NMR is, nevertheless, by far the most widely used in antimony chemistry because of both its higher natural abundance and higher receptivity.

Although both the natural abundances and their receptivities are favorable, recording of NMR spectra of these nuclei is known to be very difficult as they give rise to rather broad signals (in particular for 209 Bi).

In light of the unique Te(IV)-thiol chemistry, it has been investigated as a selective cysteine protease inhibitor.

Most [TeX 4 ] compounds (X = different heteroatoms or strong electron-withdrawing groups such as CF 3 ) resonate at 1100-2000 ppm, whereas the corresponding Te(II) compounds resonate at \u03b4 < 1000 ppm. The data reported in this study demonstrated a clear distinction in reactivity toward thiol nucleophiles of Te(IV) and Te(VI) compounds. While the latter do not interact with the thiols, as it is evident from the lack of any shift in their 125 Te NMR spectra, all the investigated Te(IV) compounds exhibited a significant shifts upon interaction with cysteine. For example, AS101 exhibited a downfield shift from +1700 to +1807 ppm, respectively, attributable to the formation of [Te(cys) 4 ], showing that Te(IV) compounds are selective cysteine protease inhibitors, while exhibiting no inhibitory activity toward other families of proteases.",

Despite these desirable qualities, 45 Sc NMR spectroscopy has scarcely been employed in biological studies of scandium complexes to date. As already shown for 27 Al (see Section 3.3.2), 45 Sc NMR can be used to probe the metal-binding sites in large proteins. The solution chemistry of scandium is based entirely on Sc 3+ , which almost exclusively forms sixcoordinate complexes. This makes Sc 3+ , whose ionic radius is slightly larger than that of Fe 3+ (0.75\u00c5 vs. 0.65\u00c5), a suitable probe for the Fe 3+ -binding sites of transferrins in which the metal ion is coordinated by six donor atoms, four from the side-chains of four protein residues and two from the synergistic anion (i.e. carbonate), in a distorted octahedral geometry. For example, the binding of Sc 3+ to chicken ovotransferrin has been investigated by 45 Sc and 13 C NMR spectroscopy [82c]. In the presence of carbonate, two 45 Sc and 13 C signals were detected which were assigned using the proteolytic half-molecules of ovotransferrin to bound Sc 3+ and 13 CO 3 2\u2212 in both metal ion-binding sites of the protein (Fig. 16) . Several properties of the transferrin-bound 45 Sc signals, such as their dependence on pulse length, magnetic field, protein size, and temperature, are consistent with the detection of only the central (m = 1/2 \u2192 \u22121/2) transition of the quadrupolar nucleus under far from extreme narrowing conditions. From 45 Sc chemical shift and line-width data for the Sc 3+ /carbonate form of ovotransferrin at four magnetic fields, the values of the quadrupolar coupling constant (\u03c7) and rotational correlation time (\u03c4 c ) have been calculated for the bound metal ion in each site of the protein. This work represented the first 45 Sc NMR study of a metalloprotein and is another example of the feasibility of quadrupolar metal ion NMR spectroscopy to investigate metal ion-binding sites in large proteins.",

In medicine titanium is used to make hip and knee replacements, pace-makers, bone-plates and screws and cranial plates for skull fractures. It has also been used to attach false teeth. Two Ti(IV) derivatives (budotitane and titanocene dichloride) have been investigated as potential metallotherapeutic drugs [128] . In particular, titanocene dichloride, [TiCl 2 Cp 2 ], entered phase I clinical trials in 1993. In contrast to the pre-clinical studies, where hepatic or liver toxicity was the dose-limiting side-effect, nephrotoxicity was identified as the dose-limiting side-effect along with hypoglycemia, nausea, reversible metallic taste immediately after administration and pain during infusion. However, the absence of any effect on proliferative activity of the bone marrow, which is the usual dose-limiting side-effect of organic drugs, was a very promising result that suggested titanocene dichloride may have significant potential for possible use in combination therapy. Two phase II clinical trials involving patients with advanced renal cell carcinoma and breast metastatic carcinoma have been reported. However, the results using titanocene dichloride as a single agent in chemotherapy were not sufficiently promising against other treatment regimes to warrant further studies, and titanocene dichloride has been discontinued from further clinical trials [129] .",

In addition, it has received much attention in recent years due to the discovery of many therapeutic properties. Several vanadium salts and their complexes have shown insulinmimetic pharmacological properties, including stimulation of glucose transport into cells and its oxidation via glycolysis, glycogen synthesis and lipogenesis, as well as inhibition of gluconeogenesis and glycogenolysis. These antidiabetic properties of vanadium compounds, which have been demonstrated by in vitro, in vivo and clinical studies, have attracted much interest as potential therapeutic agents for diabetes mellitus. They can be administered orally and promote glucose uptake in animal models of type 1 and type 2 diabetes. However, toxicity, although lower in vanadium complexes than for their salts, is still a major drawback, in particular for V(IV) compounds [134] . Moreover, the anticancer potential of, for example, vanadocene derivatives and a vanadium(IV) aspirin complex are being investigated [86] . . 51 V NMR is a powerful and selective probe of vanadium in biological systems. Unlike many other biologically relevant isotopes, the NMR receptivity of the 51 V nucleus (I = 7/2) is exceptionally high due to a large magnetic moment, an unusually small quadrupole moment, relatively large gyromagnetic ratio, high natural abundance (99.76%), and rapid quadrupolar relaxation in solution. The 51 V NMR chemical shifts are very sensitive to changes in the nature of the ligands, thereby providing an excellent diagnostic tool for detailed investigations of vanadium bound to macromolecules [133] .",

Several vanadium complexes with organic ligands were found to be more potent and less toxic than vanadium salts, likely owing to an increase in selectivity. Peroxovanadium compounds were found to increase effectiveness, possibly because these compounds can inhibit PTPases irreversibly by oxidation. Additionally, the oxidative ability of peroxovanadate complexes strongly depends on the ligand. Most peroxovanadates are hydrolytically unstable; thus, an appropriate ligand should minimize hydrogen peroxide decomposition in aqueous solution while improving selectivity, such that potency is high and toxicity is low. Speciation studies of vanadium with hydrogen peroxide and a variety of ligands are required to gain information about the insulin-enhancing character of vanadium and to find the most suitable ligand for the treatment of diabetes [135] . Recent 51 V NMR under physiological conditions [135] . 51 V NMR spectroscopy has been successfully employed to probe the solution chemistry and stability under physiologically relevant conditions of several vanadium-based insulin-mimetic agents, such as the leading compound bis(maltolato)oxovanadium(IV) (which entered phase II clinical trials late in 2007) [136] , its kojato analogue [137] , and a pro-drug of peroxovanadate insulin-mimetic hexakis(benzylammonium)decavanadate(V)dehydrate [138] .

It has a spin I = 3/2 and a relatively large quadrupole moment which leads to short nuclear relaxation times T 1 and T 2 (particularly if the local symmetry of the complex is low), the latter resulting in large experimental line-widths. The low natural isotope abundance (9.55%) combined with the small overall receptivity results in extremely low sensitivity to detection by NMR spectroscopy. To date, only a few 53 Cr solution NMR measurements have been achieved, and none of them has any biological interest [146] .",

Manganese can exist in 11 oxidation states (from +7 to \u22123), more than any other element, but the aqueous chemistry of manganese is dominated by Mn(II) complexes. Both Mn(II) and Mn(III) are found in enzymes. The ionic radius of 0.9\u00c5 places Mn 2+ in between that of Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ , so it is not surprising that there is overlap in function with these two ions in providing structural charge stabilization of enzymes and, in some cases, substrates such as Mn-ATP. In this regard, manganese has been useful in substitutions of Mg 2+ and Ca 2+ as a handle for NMR and EPR spectroscopic probes of active site architecture and catalysis [148] . Manganese also acts as a superacid catalyst in several hydrolytic enzyme-catalyzed reactions [149] . The classes of enzymes that have manganese cofactors are very broad and include oxidoreductases, transferases, hydrolases, lyases, isomerases, ligases, lectins, and integrins. The Mn-superoxide dismutase enzyme is probably one of the most ancient, as nearly all organisms living in the presence of oxygen use it to deal with the toxic effects of superoxide, formed by the one-electron reduction of dioxygen [150] . In addition to its important biological role, manganese may have several therapeutic uses, including the treatment of arthritis, cancer, cardiovascular diseases, and HIV [151] .",

The 99 Tc nuclide is extremely convenient for NMR spectroscopy due to its high receptivity and natural abundance. Although 99 Tc has a significant quadrupole moment, the effect of line-broadening in solution is attenuated by a large spin I = 9/2; in fact, for 99 Tc the resonances are amongst the narrowest for quadrupolar nuclei. However, due to the presence of unpaired electrons, Tc(II), Tc(IV) and Tc(VI) compounds cannot be studied by 99 Tc NMR spectroscopy. A review on 99 Tc NMR spectroscopy has been published recently [154] , and even if this technique has not been used yet to investigate specifically the behavior of technetium in biological systems, the reported examples show that 99 Tc NMR can be successfully used in studying not only complex formation in solutions but also kinetics of reactions.",

            "text": "Iron is the fourth most abundant element in the Earth's crust, but only a trace element in biological systems, making up only 0.004% of the body's mass. Yet, it is an essential component or cofactor of numerous metabolic reactions. Every living cell in both plants and animals contains iron. Approximately two thirds of this iron (70%) in man is contained in hemoglobin; the other third is stored in the bone marrow, spleen, liver and muscles. Myoglobin and enzymes contain about 15% of the iron, and ferritin almost as much (14%). Only about 1% is in transit in serum. In animals, plants and fungi, iron is often incorporated into heme. Heme is an essential component of cytochrome proteins, which mediate redox reactions, and of oxygen carrier proteins such as hemoglobin (carries oxygen in the blood from the lungs to tissues throughout the body) and myoglobin (stores oxygen for the muscles to use when they contract). Iron also contributes to redox reactions in the iron-sulfur clusters of many enzymes, such as nitrogenase (involved in the synthesis of ammonia from nitrogen) and hydrogenase. Non-heme iron proteins include the enzymes methane monooxygenase (oxidizes methane to methanol), ribonucleotide reductase (reduces ribose to deoxyribose), hemerythrins (oxygen transport and fixation in marine invertebrates) and purple acid phosphatase (hydrolysis of phosphate esters). Iron distribution is heavily regulated in mammals, and in cells iron is generally stored in the centre of metalloproteins (ferritins), partly because iron has a high potential for biological toxicity; in fact, free Fe 2+ ions are efficient catalysts that can rapidly generate toxic oxygen free radicals within cells. Iron distribution is regulated, so restricting its availability to bacteria can help to prevent or limit infections. A major component of this regulation is the protein transferrin, which binds iron absorbed from the duodenum and carries it in the blood to cells. If an individual has an iron deficiency, the iron stores are depleted first, followed by a reduction in hemoglobin. As a result, red blood cells are small in size and diminished in number and the direct consequence is the occurrence of anemia. On the other hand, excessive iron can be toxic, because free fer-rous iron reacts with peroxides to produce free radicals, which are highly reactive and can damage DNA, proteins, lipids and other cellular components. Thus, iron toxicity occurs when iron levels exceed the capacity of transferrin to bind the iron [6b]. Biologically relevant iron typically exists in Fe(II) and Fe(III) oxidation states. Both exist in low-and high-spin configurations and the facile interconversion between the low-and high-spin forms has important biochemical implications, as discussed in detail by Brady et al. [155] . The energy difference between lowand high-spin configurations for given oxidation state can be very small. Thus the modulation of spin state by ligand charges and differences in geometry can be important in catalytic mechanisms. A variety of Fe(III) salts are marketed as iron supplements and prescribed to treat iron-deficiency anemia, and iron mediates the anticancer activity (attack on DNA) of bleomycin [156] .",

However, use of 57 Fe-enriched material and high fields combined with the very large chemical shift range (>11000 ppm) has yielded useful information especially about heme proteins. Ferrocenes and porphyrins have been used as model compounds to obtain chemical shift data and to gain insight on the relaxation mechanisms [157]. 57 Fe NMR spectra are available for myoglobins and cytochrome-c (Fig. 18 ) [158] , and it has been established that this technique is a powerful probe for iron-ligand interactions in these proteins, particularly for porphyrin geometry [157a,159] .",

            "text": "Both ruthenium and osmium have no known natural biological function. However, in the last 15 years ruthenium and osmium complexes have aroused great interest for their potential use as therapeutic anticancer agents [160] . Two Ru(III) complexes, namely trans-[RuCl 4 (Im)(DMSO)]ImH (NAMI-A) [161] and trans-[RuCl 4 (Ind) 2 ]IndH (KP1019) [162] are undergoing clinical trials. Whilst KP1019 is cytotoxic to cancer cells, NAMI-A is relatively non-toxic but has antimetastatic activity. It has been proposed that the activity of Ru(III) complexes, which are usually relatively inert towards ligand substitution, is dependent on in vivo reduction to more labile Ru(II) analogues. Thus, the activity of Ru(II) complexes is currently being explored. In particular, since arenes are known to stabilize ruthenium in its 2+ oxidation state, the potential of Ru(II)-( 6arene) complexes as anticancer agents is under investigation [163] . In addition, a variety of ruthenium derivatives have been reported with activity against bacteria, HIV, and parasitic infection. Radical scavenging properties have been identified for Ru(II) complexes that might offer therapeutic benefits in inflammatory diseases involving reactive oxygen species or NO [86] . Given the strict similarity with Ru(II), the possible design of Os(II)-( 6 -arene) anticancer complexes has been recently taken into account [164] . Both ruthenium NMR-active isotopes ( 99 Ru, I = 3/2; 101 Ru, I = 5/2) are quadrupolar nuclei, the latter having a larger quadrupole moment. Therefore, the 99 Ru nucleus is favored for NMR spectroscopy, despite the slightly lower natural abundance (12.72% vs. 17.07% for 101 Ru). Another problem encountered in 99 Ru NMR is the low resonance frequency, resulting in acoustic ringing that causes distorted baselines. Very little is known about the dependence of \u03b4( 99 Ru) on structure and temperature, thus it is not surprising that relatively few 99 Ru NMR spectroscopic studies have been performed [165] . In addition, due to the presence of unpaired electrons, Ru(III) compounds cannot be directly detected by 99 Ru NMR spectroscopy, so 99 Ru(II) is the only NMR-observable ruthenium isotope. To date, 99 Ru NMR spectroscopy has been successfully employed mainly for Ru(II) complexes with highly symmetrical environments around the metal nucleus [166] .",

Cobalt compounds contain the metal ion in the oxidation states 1+, 2+, and 3+. The importance of cobalt comes from its participation in the B 12 family of compounds, whose active forms are responsible for catalyzing a wide variety of processes related to nucleic acid, protein, and lipid syntheses, as well as for maintaining the normal function of epithelial and nervous cells [170] . Cobalamins also stand out as nature's most complex non-polymeric structures, and the first discovered biomolecule containing a metal-carbon bond. However, several different types of cobalt-containing enzymes have been identified other then vitamin B 12 (Fig. 19 ) and its derivatives [171] . Cobalt complexes are also being investigated for their potential use in medicine as enzyme inhibitors and drug delivery devices [172] . 59 Co is a nucleus whose NMR observation should be, at least in principle, easy. It is 100% naturally abundant, possesses a relatively high magnetogyric ratio, and by virtue of the magnetic mixing of its occupied and excited d orbitals it may experience substantial paramagnetic deshieldings (>15000 ppm) that can reveal even subtle changes in chemical environments. Complicating these measurements is the nuclear spin I = 7/2 of the isotope, associated with a quadrupole moment that provides an efficient relaxation mechanism and, consequently, leads to broadened resonances in solution [173] . 59 Co NMR spectroscopy has been used to study naturally occurring cobalamins. Targets of these investigations included vitamin B 12 , the B 12 coenzyme, methylcobalamin, and dicyanocobyrinic acid heptamethylester [174] . Illustrative 59 Co NMR spectra are shown in Fig. 20 . Similar studies have been carried out using solidstate 59 Co NMR spectroscopy, showing that powder spectra with good signal-to-noise ratios can be recorded even at low magnetic field strengths. In fact, a number of circumstances combine to endow these solid-state spectra with a much higher quality than their solution counter-parts [174] . Solid-state 59 Co NMR spectroscopy has been successfully employed also to study a single-crystal of vitamin B 12 [175] as well as in the analysis of vitamin B 12 in its different polymorphic forms [176] .",

            "text": "Platinum is a relatively inert metal and has no natural biological role. Nevertheless, platinum complexes are now amongst the most widely used drugs for the treatment of cancer. The first and second generation compounds cisplatin and carboplatin are in widespread use to treat a variety of cancers, either as single agents or in combination with other drugs. Oxaliplatin, introduced into the clinic in 2002 has become an important option for the treatment of colorectal cancer and its possible use in the treatment of other cancers is a focus of intense investigation. The search for improved platinum-based drugs continues with the goals of reducing toxic side-effects and broadening the spectrum of activity to tumors resistant to cisplatin. A major focus of current research is in the investigation of \"non-classical\" platinum antitumor compounds, including trans-and polynuclear Pt(II) derivatives as well as Pt(IV) complexes, that act by a different mechanism to that of cisplatin to achieve a different profile of activity [2] . 195 Pt (I = 1/2) is a reasonably sensitive nucleus for NMR detection having a natural abundance of 33.7% and receptivity relative to 13 C of 19.1. An attractive feature of 195 Pt NMR for studies of platinum anticancer drugs is the very large chemical shift range (>15000 ppm), which allows ready differentiation between Pt(II) and Pt(IV), which tend to have chemical shifts at the high-field and low-field ends of the range, respectively. The resonances for square-planar Pt(II) complexes span some 4000 ppm and ligand substitutions produce predictable chemical shift ranges. NMR methods have proved useful in the investigation of platinum drugs from the time that cisplatin was first introduced into the clinic more than 30 years ago. Both 1D 195 Pt and 2D [ 1 H, 15 N] NMR techniques were used and made a major contribution in the understanding of the molecular mechanism of action of platinum-based anticancer drugs. This topic has been recently reviewed by several authors [16g,182] , and will not be further discussed in this paper. : Group 11 (Cu, Ag, Au) ",

            "text": "Copper is the third most abundant transition metal element in biological systems after iron and zinc. The bioinorganic chemistry of copper is dominated by 1+ and 2+ oxidation states. Almost all of the copper in humans is bound to either transport proteins (ceruloplasmin and copper-albumin), storage proteins (metallothioneins), or copper-containing enzymes, whereas unbound, free copper is not found in large quantities in the human body. A substantial number of copper metalloenzymes are found in the human body. Copper is essential for the proper functioning of these copper-dependent enzymes, including cytochrome-c oxidase (energy production), superoxide dismutase (antioxidant protection), tyrosinase (pigmentation), dopamine hydroxylase (catecholamine production), lysyl oxidase (collagen and elastin formation), clotting factor V (blood clotting), and ceruloplasmin (antioxidant protection, iron metabolism and copper transport). In addition to its enzymatic roles, copper is used for biological electron transport. The \"blue copper\" proteins (named after their intense blue color arising from a ligand-to-metal charge-transfer absorption band at \u223c600 nm) that participate in electron transport include azurin and plastocyanin [6] . Most features of severe copper deficiency can be explained by a failure of one or more of these copper-dependent enzymes. For instance, depigmentation can be explained by a tyrosinase deficiency, and the defects of collagen and elastin causing abnormalities in the connective tissue and vascular system can be explained by a lysyl oxidase deficiency. Copper complexes are currently being investigated for their potential anticancer activity. Moreover, coordination with copper, either prior to administration or in vivo, often enhances the activity of various types of drugs such as antitumor and antiinflammatory agents [86] .",

Although 107 Ag has a slightly higher natural abundance (51.82% vs. 48.18% for 109 Ag), the preferred isotope for NMR spectroscopic observation is 109 Ag, due to its slightly higher receptivity. The two most serious difficulties encountered when performing silver NMR experiments are poor sensitivity and extremely long spin-lattice relaxation times. These properties stem from the very low gyromagnetic ratios for both 107 Ag and 109 Ag. NMR spectroscopy occupies a position of preeminence in probing metal-binding sites where the native metal ions, e.g. Zn(II), Ca(II), Fe(II), Mg(II), Cu(II) and Cu(I), can be substituted with spin I = 1/2 metal isotopes. In spite of the attractiveness of Ag(I) as a redox stable analogue for Cu(I), 109 Ag NMR has so far found limited applications in biological systems, owing mostly to the insensitivity of the investigated nucleus, making direct detection impractical for most biological systems [188] . Relatively few examples of Ag(I) complexes have been characterized by 109 Ag NMR [189] , and the only known metalloprotein studied by 2D [ 1 H, 109 Ag] HMQC spectroscopy to date is the 109 Ag-substituted yeast metallothionein (Fig. 21 ) [190] .",

            "text": "Zinc is an essential element in human and animal nutrition with a wide range of biological roles. Zinc plays catalytic, structural or regulatory roles in more than 200 zinc metalloenzymes that have been identified in biological systems. Among other things, these enzymes are involved in nucleic acid and protein metabolism and the production of energy. It is estimated that around 3000 proteins in the human body contain zinc prosthetic groups; in particular, zinc plays a structural role in the formation of the so-called zinc fingers. Zinc fingers are exploited by transcription factors for interacting with DNA and regulating the activity of genes. Another structural role of zinc is in the maintenance of the integrity of biological membranes resulting in their protection against oxidative injury. In addition, there are over a dozen types of cells in the human body that secrete zinc ions, and the roles of these secreted zinc signals in medicine and health are now being actively studied. Intriguingly, brain cells in the mammalian forebrain are one type of cell that secretes zinc, along with its other neuronal messenger substances [193] . Zinc exists under physiological conditions in the 2+ oxidation state. Over 95% of total body zinc is bound to proteins within cells and cell membranes. Plasma contains only 0.1% of total body zinc. Most of the zinc (75-88%) in blood is found in the red blood cell zinc metalloenzyme carbonic anhydrase. In the plasma, approximately 18% of zinc is bound to \u2423 2 -macroglobulin, 80% to albumin and 2% to such proteins as transferrin and ceruloplasmin. As a metallotherapeutic agent, zinc has putative antiviral, fertilityenhancing and retino-protective activities. It is also used in the treatment of Wilson's disease, and it may exhibit immunomodulatory as well as antioxidant activity [194] . 67 Zn, the only naturally occurring NMR-active isotope of zinc (4.11%), has nuclear spin I = 5/2 and a large quadrupole moment which is responsible for high relaxation rates. This quadrupolar nucleus is characterized by a low sensitivity to detection by NMR and low resonance frequency. Despite these unfavorable spectroscopic properties, 67 Zn NMR experiments in solution have been performed. The required concentration of Zn 2+ is typically high, >0.1 M, but lower concentrations can be utilized with isotopic enrichment. Also, due to the quadrupolar nature of the nuclide, even if solution NMR methods afforded observable zinc resonances in a metalloprotein, the resulting line-widths can obscure the determination of sitespecific isotropic chemical shifts. With these nuclear properties, it is no wonder that the literature of 67 Zn NMR is sparse, and of those reports only a few are relevant to biology. 67 Zn NMR has been successfully applied to Zn 2+ -enzyme or Zn 2+ -protein systems, such as concanavalin, calmodulin, thermolysin, for studying the environment or behavior of Zn 2+ interacting with the investigated biomolecule ( [195] and references therein).",

At natural abundance, the sensitivity of 113 Cd is 7.6 times that of 13 C, putting it on the fringe of accessibility for biological applications using modern high-field spectrometers. However, an approximate eightfold enhancement can be obtained by substitution with 96% isotopically enriched 113 Cd, allowing reasonable quality spectra to be acquired on as little as 0.5 mL of 0.5 mM of a 113 Cd-substituted protein sample in a few hours of data accumulation.",

The adaptable ligand coordination number and geometry of Cd(II), which is quite similar to Zn(II), and factors such as its similar ionic radius (0.97\u00c5) to that of Ca(II) (0.99\u00c5) are the most commonly cited reasons why cadmium substitutes for such an extensive range of metal ions. Of even greater importance is the fact that, in a variety of cases where Zn(II) has been replaced by Cd(II) in native Zn(II) metalloenzymes and DNA-binding proteins, the wild-type activity has, at least to some extent, been retained, albeit at an altered pH maximum [199] .",

The 20 cysteines bind seven Cd 2+ or Zn 2+ ions or combinations of them in two metal-thiolate clusters. Cu + forms substantially different complexes with MTs, the structures of which are not yet well characterized [200] . 113 Cd, has frequently been used to probe the ligand environment of metal-binding sites. 113 Cd chemical shifts are very sensitive to the nature, number, and geometric arrangement of the coordinating ligands. This is reflected by the almost 900 ppm range of chemical shifts observed in 113 Cd-substituted metalloproteins (Fig. 22 ) [201] . The broad chemical shift dispersion of 113 Cd resonances is useful not only in providing information about the ligand type(s) at a particular metal site, but also because systems containing multiple metal sites with identical ligand coordination environments have a high probability of yielding resolved 113 Cd resonances (Fig. 23) . The consistent correlation that exists between the 113 Cd chemical shift in solution and the identity of the coordinating metal ligands (Fig. 22) is derived solely from Cd-substituted, structurally-defined metalloproteins.",

Much of these data are a result of the recent efforts of O'Halloran and co-workers aimed at defining the metal coordination environments in proteins involved in bacterial mercury resistance, and have revealed 199 ]). In addition, 199 Hg exhibits scalar couplings to 1 H, 13 C and 15 N that are slightly larger than those observed with 113 Cd, permitting heteronuclear correlation experiments to be carried out, which are often able to confirm the ligand type(s) and stoichiometry. The 199 Hg nucleus exhibits T 1 values in 119 Hgsubstituted plastocyanin and 199 Hg-substituted azurin of 10 and 13 ms, respectively, which are approximately 10 times smaller than values obtained for 113 Cd in the identical 113 Cd-substituted proteins [208b] . Although the number of applications where the 199 Hg(II) ion can substitute isostructurally for the native metal ions in metalloproteins is limited owing to the 1.10\u00c5 ionic radius and preference for either digonal or trigonal coordination geometry of the Hg(II) ion, it is clear that 199 Hg NMR will continue to make important contributions in studies of selected metalloproteins.",

Further development of MRI contrast agents focuses mainly on gadolinium chelated by polydentate aminocarboxylate and related ligands. Gadolinium also has potential for use in neutron capture therapy with the advantage that its uptake can be monitored by MRI [210] . There are two main goals for future development. One is to control biological behavior (cellular uptake and retention, tissue targeting, in vivo stability) by incorporating Gd into bioconjugates, such as lipids with acid labile bonds (dota-palmitic acid micelles, hydroxymethyl dota derivatives, enhanced stability dtpa derivatives, and polymers/dendrimers). The other is to improve the efficiency with which the complexes induce spin relaxation in protons of water molecules, by designing chelators to control exchange rates of coordinated, or hydrogen-bonded water molecules, and by controlling the mobility and rotation (e.g. through molecular size) of complexes. These two goals can be combined by designing agents whose spin relaxation properties are dependent on the physiological environment, so that MRI scans can provide biochemical/physiological as well as structural information. \u2424-Emitting radionuclides of lanthanide elements, and bifunctional chelators for attaching them to carrier molecules have been also reviewed.

At the same time there has been an increasing interest in Ln(III) complexes for application as contrast agents [212] .

            "text": "One of the main reasons for studying oxygen is its ubiquity in biology. Indeed, oxygen controls or participates in nearly every biological process, especially those involving aerobic metabolism. Oxygen occupies a key position both at structural and physiological levels. In all macromolecules, including peptides, proteins, DNA and RNA (especially ribosomes) and carbohydrates, oxygen has a major role in the molecular conformation observed, such as the secondary, tertiary and quaternary structure. In proteins that are stabilized through multiple hydrogen bonds, changes which occur between ground and transition states can also induce an important effect on enzyme catalysis [214] . It is therefore not surprising that oxygen atoms are involved in triggering, signaling and activation mechanisms. 17 O is the only NMR-active oxygen isotope (I = 5/2) and its application in NMR has been hindered by several of its intrinsic nuclear properties resulting in low sensitivity and complex spectra. Amongst these are (i) the small gyromagnetic ratio, so that the resonance frequency is about one-seventh that of protons; (ii) a low natural abundance of 0.037% leading to an extremely low absolute sensitivity so that isotopic enrichment is usually necessary; (iii) a nuclear quadrupole moment; and (iv) in a number of cases a large electric field gradient is experienced. 17 O exhibits a large NMR chemical shift range depending on the chemical function and the local environment, with the shift being distributed on ca. 1000 ppm [215] . 17 O solution NMR spectroscopy is a useful technique to solve structural problems for small organic molecules. The fast reorientation of the molecules in solution results in narrow spec-tral lines due to the averaging of the quadrupolar interaction. Rapid quadrupolar relaxation of 17 O has, however, prevented successful applications of solution 17 O NMR spectroscopy to biological macromolecules [216] . The large quadrupolar interaction of oxygen-containing functional groups can cause highly effective relaxation, which leads to strong broadening of the NMR signals, which can be severe for large molecules. Amongst the few reported studies, 17 O NMR spectroscopy has been successfully used to study synthetic oxygen carriers related to biological systems, such as a synthetic single-face hindered iron porphyrin-dioxygen complex [217] , metal-nucleotide interactions [218] , and nucleic acid dynamics [219] .",

In vivo 17 O NMR has two major applications for studying brain function and cerebral bioenergetics [220]. The first application is to measure the cerebral blood flow (CBF) through monitoring the washout of inert H 2 17 O tracer in brain tissue following an intravascular bolus injection of the 17 O-labelled water. The second application, perhaps the most important one, is to determine the cerebral metabolic rate of oxygen utilization (CMRO2) through monitoring the dynamic changes of metabolically generated H 2 17 O from inhaled 17 O-labeled oxygen gas in the brain tissue. Unlike the CBF measurements, the amount of the metabolically generated H 2 17 O during an inhalation of 17 O 2 is small. This could affect the reliability of CMRO2 measurement using in vivo 17 O approaches. With the dramatic 17 O sensitivity gain realized at high fields, it was possible to obtain a three-dimensional 17 O chemical shift imaging from the natural abundance H 2 17 O in a rat brain with excellent signal-to-noise ratio as well as good temporal and spatial resolutions (11 s of data acquisition and \u223c0.1 ml chemical shift imaging voxel size) at 9.4 T [220a].

Sulfur may also serve as a chemical food source for some primitive organisms: some forms of bacteria use hydrogen sulfide (H 2 S) in place of water as the electron donor in a primitive photosynthesis-like process. Sulfide forms a part of iron-sulfur clusters and the bridging ligand in the Cu A site of cytochrome-c oxidase, involved in utilization of oxygen by all aerobic life. In plants and animals the amino acids cysteine and methionine contain sulfur, as do all polypeptides, proteins, and enzymes which contain these amino acids. Homocysteine and taurine are other sulfurcontaining acids which are similar in structure, but which are not coded for by DNA, and are not part of the primary structure of proteins. Glutathione (\u2425-Glu-Cys-Gly) is an important sulfur-containing tripeptide which plays a role in cells as a source of chemical reduction potential in the cell, through its sulfhydryl group. Many important cellular enzymes use prosthetic groups ending with sulfhydryl groups to handle reactions involving acyl-containing biochemicals: two common examples from basic metabolism are coenzyme A and alpha-lipoic acid. Disulfide bonds (S-S bonds) formed between cysteine residues in peptide chains are very important in protein assembly and structure. These strong covalent bonds between peptide chains give proteins a great deal of extra toughness and resilience [221] . 33 S is the only naturally occurring isotope of sulfur with a non-zero nuclear spin (I = 3/2). Since it has a moderate quadrupole moment, a low natural abundance and a low magnetogyric ratio, it is clearly an intrinsically insensitive nucleus. It was shown that the enormous diversity of chemical environments for sulfur is reflected in a chemical shift range of over 1000 ppm and line-widths varying between 0.03 and >5000 Hz. Since 33 S has a large quadrupole moment, nuclear relaxation is dominated by the quadrupolar mechanism and, consequently, 33 S NMR signals are very broad unless the electronic sur-rounding of sulfur is highly symmetric. However, despite these drawbacks, a number of studies using sulfur NMR spectroscopy have been reported [222] , but none of them are strictly related to biological studies.",

Taurine (2aminoethanesulfonic acid) is a naturally occurring \u2424-amino acid widely distributed in the biosphere. Despite the intensive studies, many mechanisms of the biochemical reactions involving taurine remain unknown or uncertain, probably because of the difficulty in detecting taurine in intact tissues. In this work, 33 S NMR spectra of biological tissues were reported for the first time, and this appears to be one of the few biologically relevant applications of this technique. As shown in Fig. 25 , in the chemical shift range \u2212240 to +300 ppm the 33 S spectrum of L. lithophaga homogenates exhibits a single signal that was assigned to the -33 SO 3 \u2212 group of taurine on the basis of its chemical shift value (\u22126.8 ppm). The assignment was confirmed by adding pure taurine to the sample. In the spectral range examined, no 33 S NMR signals were detected from other sulfurcontaining biological molecules, for instance, cystine, cysteine, methionine, and hypotaurine. Fig. 25 .

            "text": "Fluorine is an essential element, and as fluoride is an important trace element affecting bones and teeth [230] . 19 F has many favorable NMR characteristics, including a nuclear spin I = 1/2, 100% natural abundance, high sensitivity and large chemical shift range (\u223c500 ppm) [231] . While fluorine occurs in the body, it is present mostly in the form of solid fluorides in bones and teeth. Endogenous fluorine has a very short T 2 relaxation time [230] and the resulting signal is below the limits of NMR detection in most biological systems of interest. On the other hand, as a number of fluorinated drugs are currently in clinical use, such as 5-fluorouracil, flurbiprofen, isoflurane, fluoxetine, haloperidol [232] , 19 F NMR offers a powerful method of monitoring their pharmacokinetics and metabolism. 19 F NMR spectroscopy is a versatile non-invasive analytical technique to detect, identify and quantify metabolites of fluorinated drugs both in vitro and in vivo, in order to study their physiology and pharmacology. Several reviews have been recently published on this topic [16h, 232, 233 ]. An example is given in Fig. 26 , where 19 F NMR spectroscopy is used to follow the degradative pathway (depicted in Fig. 27 ) of capecitabine. Capecitabine is a pro-drug of the anticancer agent 5-fluorouracil, designed to be used as an oral formulation to overcome toxic side-effects of 5-fluorouracil without compromising its antitumor efficacy [234] .",

Their relaxation is normally dominated by the contributions from interaction of their quadrupole moments with time-dependent electric field gradients at the nucleus. Although both the natural abundance and receptivity are favorable, recording 35 Cl NMR spectra is often difficult as it gives rise to rather broad signals. Therefore, a very few papers report on the use of 35 Cl NMR techniques for specific biological purposes. Chlorine NMR studies of chloride binding to proteins have been used to investigate a number of interesting properties associated with the proteins [236] .

            "text": "Only a few 81 Br and 127 I NMR experiments of biological relevance have been reported. There has been considerable interest in the application of NMR probes to the study of the conforma-tion of proteins. The NMR halide probe method [241] detects changes in the halide nuclear transverse relaxation time (T 2 ) as a result of halide exchange between symmetrically solvated free halide ion (long T 2 ) and a probe site where the quadrupolar halide nucleus is bound tightly to a specific region within a protein (short T 2 ). The resulting relaxation time is dependent on the relative concentrations of free and bound sites, and the physical environment of the bound halide. In its most common application, a solution of protein is prepared in aqueous sodium halide, and specific binding sites on the protein may be titrated with a metal such as mercury which binds only to these sites and which subsequently complexes halide from the solution. The application of the bromide ion as an NMR probe has been investigated, as it has some advantages over the more commonly used chloride ion, the most important being its ability to yield values for the free-to-bound exchange rate constant of the probe itself, in addition to the correlation time for reorientation of the bound probe. The exchange rates are fast, near the diffusion limit, and are sensitive to protein conformational effects near the binding site [242] . 127 I NMR spectroscopy has only rarely been utilized for studies of fluid systems partly because, for covalent environments, the 127 I NMR signal is generally broadened beyond detection. The iodide ion, on the other hand, may be conveniently studied. For example, 127 I \u2212 has been used as a probe for the anion binding properties of human serum albumin [243] . Analogous studies have been performed to investigate the binding of iodide to some peroxidases [244] .",

            "text": "Although there is enormous potential for the application of inorganic chemistry for the design of novel therapeutic and diagnostic agents, progress is hampered by the lack of methods for their speciation in solution. The nature of the species will determine their biological activity. Our review has illustrated the challenges involved in making NMR studies of many elements of interest. Although a few have readily observable spin I = 1/2 nuclei available for study (e.g. Cd, Ag, Pt), their sensitivity is not sufficient for investigations at biologically relevant concentration (micromolar or below), and signal broadening via relaxation mechanisms such as chemical shift anisotropy can be a problem. Nevertheless, in favorable circumstances, NMR spectroscopy can provide valuable insight into the biological chemistry of these elements. The problem of line-broadening of resonances from quadrupolar nuclei in low-symmetry environments greatly hinders NMR studies of a range of biologically important elements, but again under favorable conditions, NMR can also provide insight into both the thermodynamics and kinetics of their bonding sites. There is a need for the continued development of new NMR methods to study a wide range of nuclei, especially to decrease the line-widths of peaks from quadrupolar nuclei and increase the effective sensitivity of detection. Such advances could potentially be of direct benefit to the design of new medicines.",

Vanadium Vanadium exists in a variety of oxidation states, from \u22123 to +5. In vivo, given the constraints of standard physiological conditions (pH 3-7, aerobic aqueous solution, room temperature) oxidation states 4+ and 5+ prevail, with thermodynamically plausible species including vanadate, a mixture of [HV V O 4 ] 2\u2212 and [H 2 V V O 4 ] \u2212 , and vanadyl, V IV O 2+ . Vanadium is normally present at very low concentrations (<10 \u22128 M) in virtually all cells in plants and animals. Vanadium in oxidation states 3+, 4+ and 5+ readily forms V-O bonds and binds N and S as well, forming chemically robust, coordination compounds. From a coordination chemistry point of view, vanadium is remarkably flexible. V(V) has particularly non-rigid stereochemical requirements and can form coordination complexes in geometries ranging from tetrahedral and octahedral to trigonaland pentagonal-bipyramidal. V(IV) is much less flexible, with square-pyramidal or, if a sixth position is occupied, distorted octahedral geometries. Vanadium complexes readily undergo redox reactions under physiological conditions, and forms both cationic and anionic complexes in the pH range likely to be encountered physiologically (pH 2-8).",

One great merit of in vivo 17 O NMR for the determination of CMRO2 is that only the metabolic H 2 17 O is detectable. This merit dramatically simplifies both CMRO2 measurement and quantification compared to other established methods. There are two major NMR approaches for monitoring H 2 17 O in vivo, namely a direct approach by using 17 O NMR detection and an indirect approach by using 1 H NMR detection for measuring the changes in T 2 -or T 1 -weighted proton NMR signals caused by the 17 O-1 H scalar coupling and proton chemical exchange. Both approaches are suitable for CBF measurements. However, recent studies indicate that the direct in vivo 17 O NMR approach at high/ultrahigh fields appears to offer significant advantages for quantifying and imaging CMRO2 [220b].",
