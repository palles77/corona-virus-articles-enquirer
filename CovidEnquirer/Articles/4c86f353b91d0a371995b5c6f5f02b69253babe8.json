In early 2009, many people were admitted to hospitals in Mexico with severe respiratory failure following an influenza-like illness, subtyped as H1N1. An increased mortality rate was observed. By June 2009, H1N1 was upgraded to pandemic status. In June-July, Australian ICUs were experiencing increased activity due to the influenza pandemic. While hospitals implemented plans for the pandemic, the particularly heavy demand to provide critical care facilities to accommodate an influx of people with severe respiratory failure became evident and placed a great burden on provision of these services. This paper describes the initial experience (June to mid September) of the pandemic from the nursing perspective in a single Australian ICU. Patients were noted to be younger with a higher proportion of women, two of whom were pregnant. Two patients had APACHE III comorbidity. Of the 31 patients admitted during this period, three patients died in ICU and one patient died in hospital. Aerosol precautions were initiated for all patients. The requirement for single room accommodation placed enormous demands for bed management in ICU. Specific infection control procedures were developed to deal with this new pandemic influenza.",

            "text": "Influenza is a common seasonal viral infection that affects large numbers of people annually, with the highest mortality seen in the elderly. In April 2009 health authorities in Mexico reported increased numbers of people admitted to their hospitals with severe respiratory failure following an influenza-like illness. Many of these people were young. Furthermore, an increased mortality rate was observed. A novel strain of influenza A was identified and subtyped as H1N1 2009 (H1N1). The virus spread rapidly around the world from Mexico, made possible by the large volume of air travel. In March-April approximately 2.35 million passengers departed from Mexico to travel to more than 1000 cities in 164 countries around the world (Khan et al., 2009) . By June 2009, the World Heath Organisation (World Health Organisation, 2009 ) upgraded the epidemic to pandemic status due to the rapid spread and lack of immunity in the global population. The 2009 H1N1 influenza A virus was genetically mapped as an avian strain that crossed from the host carrier pigs into humans (Gatherer, 2009) . The viral antigenicity and the high level of person-to-person transmission combined to create the optimal setting for the pandemic. Because influenza is triggered during winter months by cooler temperatures, increased cloud cover and rainfall, countries in the Southern Hemisphere entering their winter season had to rapidly prepare for an increased number of people with severe respiratory failure related to H1N1.",

The H1N1 virus was confirmed by means of a polymerase-chain reaction (PCR) assay. Initially testing was challenging as the standard test, PCR, used for throat and nose swabs, had a reduced sensitivity to detect the virus in patients with severe respiratory disease. Detection improved by testing sputum and bronchial lavage specimens using nucleic acid detection tests. Recent influenza A infection was also confirmed by the presence of high antibody titres in respiratory serology tests. Of the 39 patients entered into the ICU 'INFINITE' registry, 31 were confirmed H1N1 influenza cases, six had influenza A and two did not have a confirmed diagnosis. No patients were missed.",

One pregnant woman had refractory hypoxia and Box 1 Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) Extra Corporeal Membrane Oxygenation (ECMO) is an historical name for extracorporeal life support (ECLS) that uses cardiopulmonary bypass technology to provide gas exchange in patients with severe, potentially reversible acute respiratory failure. An external artificial circulation carries deoxygenated blood from the patient to a gas exchange device (oxygenator) and blood becomes enriched with oxygen and carbon dioxide is removed. The blood then re-enters the patient's circulation. Circuit flow may be achieved using a pump (centrifugal or roller) or by the patient's arterio-venous pressure gradient (pumpless). There are two forms of ECMO--veno-venous ECMO and veno-arterial ECMO. ECMO enables ventilator settings to be reduced to provide time for treatment and recovery to occur.",

            "text": "Box 2 Airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) Airway pressure release ventilation or APRV is a protective lung strategy that uses pressure-controlled mode of ventilation to maintain plateau pressures to no greater than 30 cm H 2 O. It has the advantage that the patient is able to spontaneously breathe during the time-high interval, which limits the adverse effects of ventilation (e.g. haemodynamic instability) and potentially redirects ventilation to the more perfused area of the lungs (primarily from diaphragmatic plate movement). This mode of ventilation also has the advantage of slow lung recruitment over 12 hours enabling the FiO 2 to be titrated down to a safer level. Time-low is kept at a relatively short period of time (0.6 seconds) to prevent de-recruitment of the lung at end exhalation and is manipulated to provide the required PEEP (positive end expiratory pressure) for the patient. a PaO 2 of 49 mm Hg (6.5 kPa). Initially she was managed on APRV with inspired oxygen concentration of 100%, Pressure High (Continuous Positive Airway pressure [CPAP] high) 28 cm H 2 O and Pressure Low (CPAP low) of zero. The patient was placed on a Pressure low of zero as this allowed the patient to expire without any impedance to expiratory flow (the patient's breathing) from the ventilator and therefore facilitated CO 2 excretion. Her inspiratory time was set at 4 seconds and her expiratory time 0.6 seconds which gave her a frequency of 12 breaths per minute, preventing complete alveolar collapse. The intrinsic positive end expiratory pressure (Auto PEEP) of 10 cm H 2 O was set at an alveolar level and therefore it did not impede expiration. When PEEP is set on the ventilator, it impedes the expiratory gas flow from the patient and consequently the CO 2 clearance. By removing the ventilator-set PEEP, there is no impedance to the gas flow from the patient and enables CO 2 clearance. In APRV, the setting for time low is short. This deliberately causes air trapping that results in intrinsic PEEP equivalent to the amount generated by the ventilator but this is at alveolar level (in the lungs) and not at ventilator level. The intrinsic PEEP does not cause impedance to gas flow from the patient. Provided acceptable pH, PaCO 2 and lactate levels were maintained by the patient, a PaO 2 of 50-60 mm Hg (6.7-8.0 kPa) was accepted. Utilising this mode of ventilation the patient avoided ECMO and made a full recovery with a viable pregnancy.",

This mode of ventilation also has the advantage of slow lung recruitment over several Box 3 Example of the ventilatory approach using airway pressure release ventilation (APRV) A teenager presented with a flu-like illness and was ventilated on APRV with an upper pressure limit of 26 cm H 2 O, PEEP of 7.5 cm H 2 O and FiO 2 of 0.8. Her PaO 2 was 70 mm Hg (9.3 kPa) with an oxygen saturation of 94%. She was positioned right side up and commenced on Tamiflu on arrival. Her haemodynamic instability required vasopressor support to maintain her mean arterial pressure greater than 65 mm Hg. Her urine output was 50 mL per hour. Oxygen saturation was maintained at 95% but her PaO 2 was only 68 mm Hg (9.1 kPa). When attempting to lower her FiO 2 and upper pressure limit, her PaO 2 decreased to 48 mm Hg (6.4 kPa) and her FiO 2 was increased to 0.8. She was ventilated on APRV for 3 days and weaned to pressure support ventilation (PSV) on day 4. However, after 8 hours on PSV she deteriorated, with PaCO 2 retention. She was put back onto APRV and her PaCO 2 was maintained at around 50 mm Hg (6.7 kPa). The next day she was put onto PSV, but failed to wean and her APRV was recommenced for a further two days. She was weaned to PSV on day 8 but again failed after 16 hours and went back to APRV at similar levels to prior to PSV. She received a tracheostomy at this time. On day 10 she was trialled on PSV and over the next 3 days she was weaned to be successfully decannulated on day 13. hours enabling the FiO 2 to be titrated down to safer values as arterial blood gases improved. 'Time-low' was kept short (0.6 seconds) to prevent de-recruitment of the lung at end-exhalation and manipulated to provide the required PEEP. Seven patients received APRV and three of these also received nitric oxide as rescue therapy, two of who died in ICU. A further example of this ventilatory approach is contained in Box 3 .",

Nevertheless there was significant confusion, inconsistency and concern about risks to staff and appropriate precautions in the early stages of the index admission.

Optimal management requires rapid mobilisation of infection control resources and practices, early administration of antivirals on a degree of suspicion basis, adequate support strategies for staff and contingency plans to extend ICU beyond traditional boundaries. These should be established and practised prior to an outbreak. Effective communication with all the key stakeholders is essential.",
