The 2013-2015 outbreak stemmed from transmission of the Ebola species Zaire ebolavirus, which has been described as having the highest case fatality rate and virulence among Ebola species [3, 4] . Ebola virus is presumed to be a zoonotic infection with reservoirs in bat and other wildlife populations that episodically infects humans, thus allowing person-to-person contact to further spread the virus and cause outbreaks [5] . Close contact with infected individuals, especially via contaminated body fluids, is the main route of person-to-person transmission of Ebola [6] .",

The most recent Ebola outbreak was the largest and longest on record, infecting nearly 30 000 individuals, with fatality rates approaching 70% in some areas [13, 14] . Many factors led to the magnitude and velocity of the outbreak in West Africa including poor health infrastructure, lack of awareness of symptoms and transmission, cultural barriers, population density, and travel [13] . These factors also led to additional significant events that had not previously occurred, including repatriation of patients with EVD from Africa to treatment centers in the United States and Europe, international travel of asymptomatic patients with EVD out of Africa, and infection of health care workers caring for patients with EVD in the United States and Europe. The reality and uncertainty of the 2013-2015 outbreak forced the heavily regulated health care systems in Europe and the United States to develop policies and procedures designed to protect patients and hospital staff in unprecedented circumstances. An important lesson learned was the invaluable role that the laboratory played in caring for patients with EVD by providing experimental therapy support in the form of convalescent blood products, as well as generation of laboratory results needed to replace fluid and electrolytes, the mainstay of supportive care treatment [9, 10] .",

The assumptions made when designing laboratory protocols to handle specimens with Ebola virus were that virus may persist for days in a specimen, body fluids may have a viral genome titer of 10E8 or higher, and as few as 1 to 10 virions may be infectious, meaning that a nanoliter of blood exposed to a mucous membrane could potentially cause disease [16] [17] [18] . As such, processes that involved open tubes, centrifugation steps, and/or aerosolization potential should be evaluated and risk mitigation steps taken when appropriate. A certified industrial hygienist can be helpful in determining risks in the laboratory, as well as potential safety engineering improvements [17] . For patients with known EVD, point-of-care testing located in a biosafety hood that minimizes specimen handling has been used with success [19] . Point-of-care testing must comply with all Clinical Laboratory Improvement Amendments (CLIA) regulations (42 CFR Part 493). In addition, testing in core hospital laboratories has been reported on specimens from patients with known EVD, as long as the instruments had closed tube sampling capability [17] . Although not available initially during the 2013-2015 outbreak, most major manufacturers now have decontamination protocols should any samples with Ebola virus be tested on an analyzer.",

ABO and Rh typing could instead be performed using commercially available reagents that are Food and Drug Administration (FDA) approved for slide agglutination, a process that poses a low risk of aerosolization when performed in a biosafety hood (Fig 1A) [17] . Knowledge of a patient's ABO type can be helpful for selection of both convalescent and nonconvalescent blood products. Because no red blood cell (RBC) allo-or auto-antibody testing was performed, and RBC units were not serologically crossmatched, both centers provided universally compatible blood products on an emergency release basis for patients with known EVD (group O RBCs, group AB, or ABO-compatible plasma containing products if type was known) [17, 19] .

No adverse events from receiving nonconvalescent blood products in the absence of antibody screening and serologic crossmatching were reported. However, given the small number of nonconvalescent blood transfusions, an adverse reaction may not have been statistically likely. To further improve blood transfusion safety, especially RBC transfusions, alternative technologies have been examined. For example, the CE-marked MDmulticard (Grifols, Barcelona, Spain) can rapidly serotype Rh and K subgroups by placing a drop of the patient's blood onto a card impregnated with antisera without any centrifugation, so that in the event of an emergency release RBC transfusion, antigen-compatible units could be selected to minimize the risk of immune-mediated hemolysis (Fig 1B) .",

The criterion standard to gauge the effectiveness of CP would be a randomized controlled trial that compared CP of similar dose, timing of administration, and antibody titers to non-CP plasma infusion. Although standardizing the dose and timing of administration of CP is straightforward, determining antibody titers is not because there is no standardized assay available. Even when considering the assays used in Ebola virus research studies, variability exists in methodology, substrates, and nomenclature, making comparisons difficult. Owing to CP as a biologic product, many additional variables may affect any potential efficacy including the donor's immune response, whether the donor was infected by a similar strain of Ebola, and the epitopes recognized by the anti-Ebola antibodies. Because only GP is accessible on the virus surface, anti-GP antibodies mechanistically are more likely to be neutralizing [39] . As such, CP collected from survivors of EVD may be different from donors who were vaccinated against Ebola. Possibly, a subset of donors with hightiter neutralizing antibodies as measured by a clinically validated assay would yield CP with measurable efficacy. Given these challenges, truly meaningful conclusions regarding the value of CP remain elusive. However, as new outbreaks of infections emerge, especially with a high case-fatality rate, CP will continue to be a useful frontline tool given its favorable safety profile and ability to be rapidly deployed, which is likely to only improve with more widespread pathogenreduction availability.",
