The peptides mixture formulated either with Freund's adjuvant or synthetic adjuvant Montanide ISA-51/oligodeoxy nucleotide CpG (ISA/CpG) could elicit antisera in immunized animals which were capable of inhibiting SARS/HIV pseudovirus entry into HepG2 cells. The neutralizing epitopes were identified using peptides to block the neutralizing effect of guinea pig antisera. The major neutralizing epitope was located on the D2 peptide, and the amino acid residue was fine mapped to 434-453. In BALB/c mice T-cell proliferation assay revealed that only D2 peptide contained T-cell epitope, the sequence of which corresponded to amino acid residue 434-448. The ISA/CpG formulation generated anti-D2 IgG titer comparable to those obtained from Freund's adjuvant formulation, but generated fewer antibodies against D1 or TM peptides. The highly immunogenic D2 peptide contains both neutralizing and Th cell epitopes. These results suggest that synthetic peptide D2 would be useful as a component of SARS vaccine candidates.",

            "text": "Emerging infectious disease caused by the severe acute respiratory syndrome-associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) had significant economic impacts in countries affected by the disease outbreak in 2002-2004 [1] . Since there is no licensed SARS vaccine, the risk posed by a worldwide outbreak of SARS in the future is still exist. There is an urgent need to find a safe and effective SARS vaccine for future use. SARS vaccine candidates could be developed using inactivated virus, attenuated virus, recombinant or synthetic viral components. The latter approach is particularly attractive because it reduces the risks involved when working with potentially hazardous live organisms. Moreover, the fully synthetic peptides derived from the immunogenic region of viral components could provide a well-defined immunogen that may more easily comply with regulatory requirements. Appropriate selection of major reactive epitopes and corresponding peptides for vaccine design is crucial for success. Increasing knowledge of the viral entry mechanism and antigenic structure of viral proteins has been of great help to peptide-based vaccine development. Spike proteins have been developed as vaccine candidates to induce humoral and cellular immunity in mouse models [2, 3] . The spike protein of SARS CoV comprised of 1255 amino acids plays an important role in recognition and binding to the host receptor, angiotensin converting enzyme 2 (ACE2). The receptor binding motif has been localized between amino acid residues 424-494 on the S protein [4] . It is believed that virus binding could induce conformational change of the spike protein to form the trimer-of-hairpins organization which 0006-291X/$ -see front matter \u00d3 2007 Elsevier Inc. All is characterized by a fusion core structure [5] . The fusion core contains two highly conserved heptad repeat (HR) regions (HR1 and HR2) that are believed to facilitate virus-cell fusion [6] . The predicted HR1 and HR2 regions have been localized at amino acid residues 915-949 and 1150-1184, respectively [7, 8] . We previously found an important neutralizing epitope (a.a. 1143-1157) located at the front of the HR2 region [9] . Zeng et al. [10] found that neither of the antibodies against Sl nor S2 alone could neutralize the virus, but antibodies generated against both regions of the spike protein could block host-cell viral entry. It is very important to include different functional domains to design an effective peptide-based vaccine.",

Three peptides were mixed with adjuvant to study the immunogenicity in different animals.

Each individual peptide was tested using a [ 3 H]thymidine incorporation assay. There were no significant responses in the D1 and TM stimulation groups. In contrast, D2 peptide could significantly stimulate T-cell proliferation in the CFA/IFA and the ISA/CpG formulation (Fig. 3A) . To identify T-cell epitopes located on the immunized peptides. Splenocytes from immunized mice were restimulated in vitro using the individual 15-mer peptides listed in Supplementary data 1. The significance of the pro-liferation was compared with the SI value of the respective peptide by t-test (p < 0.05). The results suggested the presence of one T-cell epitope (peptide 58) located at the amino acid residue 434-448 (Fig. 3B) . Analysis of the supernatant of stimulated cells by IFN-c ELISA yielded consistent results (Fig. 4A) . The IFN-c concentration in the ISA/ CpG group was comparable to that of the CFA/IFA group (176 \u00b1 32 vs. 192 \u00b1 61). Alternatively, the stimulation effect of the peptide could be due to the antigen processed to generate a CD8 + reactive epitope. In order to determine the CD8 + T-cell reactive epitopes, four 9-mer peptides on D2 were synthesized based on the website computer program SYFPEITHI (Supplementary data 2 ) [15] . These peptides were predicted to be recognized by the H-2K d MHC molecule. All four peptides were cultured with splenocytes, and the supernatants were then collected and analyzed by IFN-c ELISA. The results showed that only peptide D2-1 could induce IFN-c secretion (Fig. 4B) . There was no significant difference in IFN-c secretion between the CFA/IFA and ISA/ CpG group (147 \u00b1 25 vs. 105 \u00b1 43). To further confirm that D2-1 was a MHC class I-restricted peptide, we used purified CD4 + or CD8 + T-cells to identify the responding T-cell subsets. The CD4 + and CD8 + T-cells were separated using magnetic beads, which yielded a purity of the enriched T-cell subsets of greater than 90% (data not shown). Mitomycin C-treated na\u00efve splenocytes were added as antigen presenting cells. IFN-dd-secreting T-cells were analyzed by flowcytometry. The results showed that only peptide 58 (0.16%) or D2-1 peptide (0.1%) could stimulate CD4 + T-cells to secrete IFN-c (Fig. 4C) , indicating that 9-mer peptide D2-1 also stimulated proliferation of CD4 + T-cells but not CD8 + T-cells.

This strategy is more efficient than using a single neutralizing epitope, since a peptide cocktail could potentially provide Th epitopes which enhance immune response. We used the peptide cocktail to immunize mice, guinea pigs and rabbits. In the mouse model we also used adjuvant ISA/CpG, which could potentially be used in a human vaccine, to study the immunogenicity of peptide vaccine candidates.

The D1 peptide may therefore not be a good candidate for vaccine development. The ACE2 receptor-binding domain has been identified on the_SARS CoV spike protein (a.a. 318-510) [16] . Furthermore, based on the crystal structure the minimum ACE2 receptor-binding motif on the spike protein has been suggested to be located at amino acid residue 424-494 [4] . The D2 peptide (434-467) is within the binding motif, and we found it to be both highly antigenic and immunogenic in mice, guinea pigs and rabbits. A neutralizing epitope located at amino acid residue 434-453 was identified using a pseudovirus entry assay. Furthermore, our previous collaboration with Shih et al. also found a monoclonal antibody which could block pseudovirus entry has a binding epitope located in the same region (a.a. 434-448) [14] .

These results indicated that the ISA/CpG formulation could be used as an adjuvant in developing peptide-based vaccines. Our previous study found that the N protein from SARS CoV formulated with ISA and CpG could enhance immunogenicity, and the immune response was biased towards Th1 immunity [20] . In this study, we did not observe a similar immune response when peptides were formulated with ISA and CpG (data not shown). This may have been due to the need for a different CpG dose than for the N protein for the peptide to bias toward immune response. Further optimization of the CpG dose formulation in these peptide-based vaccines is needed.",

It also could be possible to use the peptides synthesized in this study as drugs that mimic the viral protein interaction with the cell membrane. Further animal immunization study by including more neutralizing epitopes in our peptide cocktail to form a basis for SARS vaccine development in humans is needed.",

SARS/HIV pseudovirus was pre-incubated with each antisera dilution(10, 20, and 40)  for 60 min at 37\u00b0C, then used to infect HepG2 (2 \u00b7 10 5 ) cells. Luciferase activity in cell lysates was measured 3 days after infection. The tested sera are from (A) mice; (B) guinea pigs; (C) rabbits. Results are presented relative to luciferase activity units (RLUs) in the control group (pre-immune serum). The data shown are from three separate experiments. Identification of neutralizing epitopes. Antisera from immunized guinea pigs were used to identify neutralizing epitopes. The 20-fold diluted serum was used as the standard neutralization. The 20-fold diluted serum was incubated with 8 lg of D1, D2, and TM peptide for 1 h at 37\u00b0C before adding to the HepG2 cells with pseudovirus in a 12-well plates (A). The 15-mer overlapping peptide 58-62 was incubated with 20-fold diluted antiserum before adding to the Hep G2 cells with pseudovirus (B). The neutralization inhibition was calculated as: neutralization inhibition (%) = (units of luminescence with antiserum and peptide \u00c0 units of luminescence with antiserum)/(units of luminescence without antiserum \u00c0 units of luminescence with antiserum) \u00b7 100.",
