            "text": "Colds are also costly. It is estimated that direct medical costs in the United States, including physician visits, secondary infections, and medications for colds, were an estimated $17 billion/year in 1997. Indirect costs from missed work for illness or to look after a sick child were an estimated $25 billion/year. 1 Because there are no effective antivirals to cure the common cold and few effective measures to prevent it, treatment should focus on symptom relief. The most commonly used treatments include over-the-counter antihistamines, decongestants, cough suppressants, and expectorants. These treatments can be used alone or in combination. 2 Treatment of the common cold in traditional Chinese medicine (\u4e2d\u91ab zh ong y \u0131; TCM) is based on pattern differentiation. According to the TCM theory, the common cold is considered as an exterior syndrome, which can be further divided into the wind-cold type (\u98a8 \u5bd2\u578b f eng h an x\u00edng), the wind-heat type (\u98a8\u71b1\u578b f eng r e x\u00edng) and the summer heat dampness type (\u6691\u71b1\u578b sh\u01d4 r e x\u00edng). 3 The most common type of common cold often caught in winter and spring is the wind-cold type. For thousands of years, Chinese people have treated the wind-cold type common cold with natural herbs, some of which were quite simple, effective, widely used by folk ordinary people, and were called folk prescriptions. However, physical conditions of patients with the wind-cold type are different, i.e., some are normal and others are weak. Therefore, treatment should be chosen inaccordance with the patient's individuality according to the TCM theory. This article introduces some Chinese folk prescriptions (\u4e2d\u570b\u6c11\u9593\u8655\u65b9 zh ong gu o m\u00edn ji an ch\u01d4 f ang) for the wind-cold type common cold with in patients with normal and weak physique.",

Similarly, CAM products such as Andrographis paniculata (Kalmcold; \u7a7f \u5fc3\u84ee chu an x \u0131n li an), Echinacea purpurea, and Pelargonium sidoides (geranium) extract (Umcka Coldcare) were reported effective for the common cold in adults. 14 They are also convenient, cheap, and most importantly, safe; some of them are even daily edible foods such as ginger, scallion stalk, and porridge, i.e., there are no obvious untoward reactions compared with the abovementioned treatments like over-the-counter drugs. Chinese folk prescriptions for the wind-cold type common cold are quite suitable for general practitioners or patients with the wind-cold type common cold to treat the disease. Of course, their pharmacological features and mechanisms of action need to be further studied.",
