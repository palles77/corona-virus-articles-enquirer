Determinative beliefs regarding the 1918 pandemic include that infections were expressed as primary viral pneumonias and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome, that pandemic-related deaths were the end states of the natural progression of disease caused by the pandemic strain, and that bacterial superinfections caused relatively fewer deaths in 1918 than in subsequent pandemics. In turn, response plans are focused on developing and/or increasing inventories of a strain-specifi c vaccine, antivirals, intensive care beds, mechanical ventilators, and so on. Yet, there is strong and consistent evidence of epidemiologically and clinically important interactions between infl uenza and secondary bacterial respiratory pathogens, including during the 1918 pandemic. Countermeasures (eg, vaccination against pneumococcal and meningococcal disease before a pandemic; mass uses of antibiotic(s) with broad spectrums of activity against common bacterial respiratory pathogens during local epidemics) designed to prevent or mitigate the eff ects of infl uenza-bacterial interactions should be major focuses of pandemic-related research, prevention, and response planning.",

            "text": "The infl uenza pandemic of 1918 accounted for an estimated 40-100 million deaths worldwide. 1, 2 The emergence and international spread of coronavirusassociated severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), 3 of H5N1 infl uenza among domestic and wild avian species, [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] and of avian infl uenza among human beings have alarmed public health and clinical professionals. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] Plans for responding to the next infl uenza pandemic are guided by beliefs regarding the 1918 pandemic including that the pandemic was caused by a highly virulent, effi ciently transmitted infl uenza virus that evolved from an avian strain; 2,6-10 that infections with the pandemic strain were expressed as primary viral pneumonias and/or acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS); [6] [7] [8] 11 that pandemic-related deaths were the end states of the natural progression of disease caused by the pandemic strain; [6] [7] [8] 11, 12 that bacterial superinfections caused relatively fewer deaths in 1918 than in subsequent infl uenza epidemics; [6] [7] [8] 13 and that the clinical and epidemiological characteristics of the next pandemic will closely mimic those of the 1918 pandemic. 6, 7 In turn, vaccines and antivirals (which are in short supply and/or may not be eff ective) are the mainstays of prevention planning, and the availability of intensive care beds and mechanical ventilators to treat rapidly progressing viral pneumonias and ARDS are central to clinical preparations. [6] [7] [8] 14 However, outside of highly controlled laboratory settings, the clinical and pathophysiological characteristics of most infectious diseases are much more complex than implied by a simple \"one germ, one disease\" model because the pathophysiological eff ects of many infectious agents-and particularly infl uenza viruses-modify the eff ects of coinfecting agents. [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] The mechanisms involved in such interactions include breakdowns of physical barriers to tissue invasion; decreased mucociliary clearance activity; destruction, depression, and/or dysregulation of immune system components; enhanced expressions of receptors by, and/or increased adherence to, epithelial cells; increased aerosolisation and dispersion of coinfecting agents; production of antibodies that block immune responses to other agents; up-regulation of expressions of genes that code for toxins; and so on [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] (fi gure 1). In turn, interactions among infl uenza and coinfecting bacterial respiratory pathogens, for example, often determine clinical attack rates, the nature and severity of clinical expressions, and the mode, direction, and velocity of spread of coinfecting agents in various populations, locations, and settings.",

The clinical presentation was \"so distinctive as to constitute a defi nite clinical entity\". 30 At the height of the epidemic, purulent bronchitis accounted for nearly half of all necropsies that were done in the aff ected area. Cultures of 20 sputum specimens from purulent bronchitis cases revealed Bacterium infl uenzae (now Haemophilus infl uenzae; 90%), pneumococcus (65%), streptococcus (25%), and staphylococcus (15%). Of note, specimens that yielded high numbers of B infl uenzae were nearly always coinfected with pneumococci. 30 About the same time, a similar illness was aff ecting soldiers in large numbers at the British army camp in Aldershot, England. The clinical course was characterised by profound respiratory distress, \"a peculiar dusky heliotrope type of cyanosis\" 31 (fi gure 2) and high case fatality (approximately 50%). In eight consecutive cases, seven had \"copious growths of B infl uenzae\" associated with pneumococci. 31 Medical offi cers at the camp concluded that \"these patients suff er from a primary invasion of their lung tissues by the B infl uenzae, and that pneumococci, present at the same time, are at fi rst of low virulence \u2026 Exaltation of the virulence of the pneumococci by symbiotic growth with B infl uenzae would appear to follow.\" 31 The emergence of a distinctive, highly virulent disease in military camps in France and England suggested to Abrahams and colleagues 31 that purulent bronchitis \"is more widespread than has hitherto been recognized\".",

Medical offi cers felt that \"considerable importance must be placed on the secondary invaders, the pneumococcus and in this hospital rarely the S hemolyticus, which are found in such a large percentage of cases examined, both during life and post mortem\". 40 At Camp Logan, TX, from September 13 to October 8, there were 2487 hospitalisations for infl uenza; of them, approximately 17% developed pneumonias, of which approximately 4% were fatal. 36, 41 Of 302 sputum cultures of infl uenza and pneumonia patients, the predominant organism by far was pneumococcus. In nine postmortem examinations, pneumococci were the most frequently recovered organisms from lungs (44%), pleural cavities (67%), and heart blood (33%). 41 At Fort Riley, KS, between September 15 and the end of October, approximately one-quarter of the camp's population were aff ected by infl uenza; of them, approximately 17% developed pneumonias, of which approximately 36% were fatal. 36, 42 Medical offi cers reported that there were \"no deaths during the epidemic except from pneumonia or its complications\". 42 They concluded that \"infl uenza bacillus or some unknown Historical Review virus merely served to predispose to pulmonary infection with organisms commonly known to produce pneumonia such as the pneumococcus and Streptococcus hemolyticus\". 42 At Camp Jackson, SC, from approximately September 15 through mid-October, about one-fi fth of the camp's population were hospitalised with infl uenza; of them, about 17% developed pneumonias, of which approximately 31% were fatal. 36, 43 The most frequent isolate from sputum of pneumonia cases was Streptococcus pneumoniae; remarkably, nearly half of 312 post-mortem lung cultures revealed S aureus.

Medical offi cers noted that \"a large variety of organisms has been encountered in cultures and smears from the lung substance, from the bronchial mucous membrane, and from the sputum. Streptococci and pneumococci have been most frequently found\". 39 At Camp Custer, MI, from late September through October, more than one-quarter of all troops were diagnosed with infl uenza; of them, approximately 21% developed pneumonias, of which approximately 28% were fatal. 36, 44 Of 740 cultures of sputum of pneumonia patients, 26% and 17% were positive for pneumococcus and haemolytic streptococcus, respectively. Post-mortem cultures of lung and heart blood specimens from 280 fatal pneumonia cases revealed that 28% of each were positive for pneumococcus, and 27% and 22%, respectively, were positive for haemolytic streptococcus. The authors noted that \"without exception the deaths from this respiratory epidemic have been due to secondary pneumonia. In no instance has a case come to necropsy in which death occurred from infl uenza infection alone\". 44 They concluded that bacteria recovered from pneumonic lungs were \"secondary invaders, the fi eld being prepared by the lowering of resistance incident to a preceding disease, which in this epidemic was in most instances infl uenza\". 44 At Camp Grant, IL, in approximately 1 month following September 21, about one-quarter of all troops were hospitalised for infl uenza; of them, approximately 22% developed pneumonias, of which approximately 46% were fatal (fi gure 4). 36, 45 Post-mortem cultures of exudates of consolidated lungs and heart's blood often revealed \"purely fi ne green colonies containing gram positive, lancet shaped diplococci\". 45 45 of 90 blood cultures of living patients revealed \"a gram-positive diplococcus in pure strain without exception \u2026 all the morphologic and cultural charac teristics of a pneumococcus\". 45 The authors concluded that \"the epidemic of bronchopneumonia at Camp Grant is due to infection by a virulent strain of pneumococcus. The virulence of this organism exceeds greatly that of strains usually identifi ed in pneumonia\". 45 At Camp Fremont, CA, in 6 weeks beginning October 8, there were 2418 hospitalisations for respiratory diseases; of them, approximately 17% developed pneumonias, of which approximately 36% were fatal. 36, 46 Cultures of nasopharynges or sputum of 158 pneumonia cases revealed B infl uenzae (38%), pneumococci (41%), and streptococci (29%). Post-mortem cultures of lungs in 20 lobar pneumonia cases revealed pneumococci (45%) and staphylococci (10%). Post-mortem examinations of bronchopneumonia cases revealed that \"pus streamed from their tracheas when the lungs were removed. Small areas \u2026 of consolidated tissue were scattered uniformly throughout the lungs \u2026 a drop of pus could be expressed from the center of each.\" 46 The authors concluded that the primary infection caused lower resistance to certain secondary organisms; secondary lobar pneumonias were due to pneumococci and streptococci-pneumococci predominating; and bronchopneumonias were due to B infl uenzae. 46 In his review of clinical reports from 72 US Army hospitals throughout the USA, Conner 47 noted \"the multiplicity of types of the infecting micro-organisms\" and emphasised the \"close relation which exists between the purely clinical aspects of the disease and the nature of the dominating organism in the lung. This relation seems to be especially important in the case of Streptococcus hemolyticus and of Staphylococcus aureus.\"",

A case series analysis revealed that the most frequently isolated bacteria from patients with post-infl uenzal pneumonias were S pneumoniae, H infl uenzae, and S aureus. 60 During the same period in the Netherlands, Hers and colleagues 61 studied 158 fatal cases of Asian infl uenza. S aureus and pneumococci were recovered from 59% and 15% of lung cultures, respectively. Approximately two-thirds (n=56) of the pneumonia-related deaths attributable to S aureus were in individuals between 6 and 40 years old. \"Pure\" infl uenza pneumonia was considered the cause of death in 20% of the fatal cases. 61 During the 1968 Hong Kong infl uenza pandemic in the USA, there was an estimated threefold increase in the incidence of staphylococcal pneumonias and a strong Historical Review correlation between staphylococcal pneumonia risk and prior infl uenza infection. Much of the excess mortality during the pandemic was attributed to the increased incidence of bacterial pneumonias. 62 In Rochester, MN, infl uenza A Hong Kong/68 virus was isolated from 127 patients; of these, 16% developed pneumonias, of which 40% were fatal. S aureus or Pseudomonas aeruginosa was recovered from six of eight fatal cases. 63 In 1996, Kim and colleagues 64 reported results of a community-wide surveillance of respiratory diseases in Houston. Among adults, they found signifi cant correlations between the occurrence of pneumococcal disease and the isolation of infl uenza, respiratory syncytial virus, and other viruses (p<0\u00b7001). Recently, in a controlled trial among South African children, Madhi and colleagues 65 found that pneumococcal vaccine prevented 31% of all pneumonias associated with a variety of respiratory viruses.

For example, during mobilisation for World War 1 (which included the infl uenza pandemic period), there were historically high numbers and rates of meningococcal disease in US civilian and military populations. In the US Army, recruits in initial training camps and soldiers who had recently disembarked from troop ships were at highest risk. 66 In October 1918, the weekly bulletin of the American Expeditionary Forces in Europe documented a sharp rise in reports of cerebrospinal meningitis approximately 1 week after sharp increases in reports of infl uenza and pneumonia. The bulletin noted that \"it has been a usual observation that when infections of the upper respiratory tract prevail, the incidence of meningitis in the community increases soon after and this rule prevails at present\". 67 Since 1918, there have been numerous reports of clusters of meningococcal disease that occurred during or shortly after outbreaks of infl uenza or infl uenza-like illnesses. For example, in 1972, Young and colleagues 68 described 11 cases (three fatal) of serogroup B meningococcal meningitis among 55 residents of a mental institution during a community outbreak of infl uenza A. Both nasopharyngeal carriage and systemic infections with N meningitidis were signifi cantly associated with serological evidence of recent infl uenza infections (p=0\u00b7054 and p=0\u00b7029, respectively). In 1976, Mackowiak and colleagues 69 reported four cases of meningococcaemia that occurred simultaneously in a family of six. The family members were aff ected by infl uenza-like illnesses before the outbreak of meningococcemia. 69 In 1986, Schubiger and colleagues 70 reported an outbreak of group B meningococcal disease among boarding school students. Each aff ected student had serological evidence of concomitant infl uenza infection. The authors concluded that \"the viral infection made way for the outbreak of the meningococcal disease and for the high rate of secondary meningococcal infection\". In February 1986, within 2 days, fi ve children who rode the same school bus developed group C meningococcal disease. All of the aff ected children had recent infl uenza-like illnesses, and cases had higher titres of antibodies to infl uenza B than non-aff ected students on the same bus. 71 In January 1996, ten cases of group C meningococcal disease occurred within 6 days among 1034 air force recruits in Greece. The peak of the outbreak was approximately 3 days after the peak of a large outbreak of infl uenza B among the recruits. 72 Relations between infl uenza and meningococcal disease incidence have also been documented at population levels. For example, in November-December 1989, during an infl uenza outbreak in the UK, Cartwright and colleagues 73 noted a striking increase in the number of meningococcal strains submitted to the national reference laboratory. Sera from 28% of 43 meningococcal disease cases (compared with 9% of 67 other cases) had antibodies to the epidemic strain of infl uenza A. During the same period, rates of meningococcal disease were increased and case fatality rates were exceptionally high throughout southwest England. 73 In 1957 and 1976, in England and Wales, approximately 2 weeks separated large outbreaks of infl uenza A from increases in reports of meningococcal meningitis. 74 From 1985 through 1990 in France, the incidence of meningococcal disease during a given week correlated with rates of infl uenzalike syndrome during the preceding (but not the following) 5 weeks. Also, there were signifi cant spatiotemporal associations between the spread of infl uenza-like syndrome throughout the country and subsequent increases in meningococcal disease rates (p<0\u00b705). Finally, meningococcal cases had more severe clinical outcomes during and up to 2 months following outbreaks of infl uenza-like syndrome compared with other times. 75 In summary, in many locations, populations, and settings over many decades, important relations have been documented between infl uenza incidence and subsequent rates and severities of meningococcal disease.",
