Objectives: To assess the travel health care needs of Chinese residents in Hong Kong by examining travel health problems of returning Hong Kong residents and by understanding their use of travel health services before or after travel. Methods: Review of available data followed by a cross-sectional telephone survey of 280 travellers and 15 service providers. A structured pre-tested questionnaire was used for data collection. Household members, who were ethnic Chinese, aged 15-64 years, able to communicate in Cantonese, and who had travelled at least once during the preceding 12 months were invited to participate. Results: There was a scarcity of travel medicine services in Hong Kong. The most common destinations for travellers were countries in the Asia-Pacific region, especially mainland China (33%). Twenty percent of the respondents developed health problems during or shortly after travel. Although only 9% of respondents had received pre-travel health advice, 61% used some form of precautions. Twelve percent had lost at least a day due to travel-related health problems. The service providers agreed that there are demands for travel health services. However, half of the service providers had not been trained in travel or tropical medicine.",

[1] [2] [3] [4] [5] [6] With the worldwide increase of both international and domestic travel, the need for specialized travel health care services within the health care system is quite evident. There has been a marked increase in travel among Hong Kong residents in the past decade. In 1996, Hong Kong's 6.8 million residents made over 37 million overseas visits (including mainland China), 56% more than in 1990, and 8% more than in 1995. 7 This trend reflects rapid movement of large population subgroups, which may pose increased risks of travel-related illnesses, particularly communicable diseases. To describe the magnitude of the problem we reviewed the existing situation of travel-related health and the availability of travel medicine services in Hong Kong.",

At present although information on travel-related health problems among Hong Kong public is still limited, it is, nevertheless, clear that international travel places much of this population at risk of health hazards. For example, in March 1998, a cholera outbreak occurred amongst Hong Kong travellers who travelled to Thailand with a travel agency. 8 Twenty eight percent (29/103) of the tour members were confirmed with cholera in this outbreak which was acquired from a restaurant in Thailand. In August 1998, an imported case of Escherichia coli 0157 was reported, 9 acquired from the ingestion of unpasteurized milk from a dairy farm in the United Kingdom. Malaria is often imported into Hong Kong by tourists after travel to malaria-endemic areas of Africa, Southeast Asia, and the Indian subcontinent. 10 Most of the reported cases of typhoid fever (106) and paratyphoid fever (13 cases) in 2000 were thought to be imported cases. 10 Furthermore, a substantial proportion of the reported tuberculosis and hepatitis cases in Hong Kong are thought to be related to travel to mainland China. 11 In 2003, a physician, who travelled from Guangdong to Hong Kong, was the point source for the subsequent outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) in early 2003. 12 In 1997, a survey conducted among 448 social hygiene clinic attendees in Hong Kong found that 20% of all participants and 62% of those with confirmed sexually transmitted diseases had had sex during travel within 3 months prior to the study, and only 51% had used condoms. 5 Another study conducted among 258 university staff 13 and 1197 university students 6 indicated that 56% and 41% of the respondents, respectively had developed one or more travel-related health problems during the previous year.",

Public hospitals do not provide any free immunizations to the public intending to travel to areas with vaccine-preventable diseases.
