Potent humoral immune responses were induced under the elicitation of three times of immunizations at 2-week intervals with this vaccine, combined with three types of adjuvants (Freund's adjuvant, Al(OH) 3 adjuvant and CpG adjuvant). Titers of specific IgG antibodies in three test groups all peaked in the sixth week after first vaccination, but significant differences existed in the kinetics of specific IgG antibody levels. The strong neutralizing capacity exhibited in micro-cytopathic effect neutralization tests indicated the specific antibodies are protective. Western blot assay further demonstrated the specificity of the induced serum antibodies.",

            "text": "Based on the potent antigenicity and immunogenicity, SARS-CoV S (spike, 139 kDa), N (nucleocapsid, 46 kDa) and M (membrane, 25 kDa) proteins may be selected as targets for SARS vaccine development [23] [24] [25] . In present study, the specificity of serum antibodies induced by F69 strain inactivated vaccine was identified by Western blot assay. Two dominant bands and several minor bands were exhibited in the gel after SDS-PAGE. In electrophoresis, the migration of virus proteins was somewhat blocked, the visual effect of which was the arched front (lane 1, Fig. 4 ). Considering the imbalance in migration rates between protein marker (lane M, Fig. 4 ) and virus proteins, the actual molecular weight of the two main protein bands should be a little smaller than the ap-parent values, which was estimated at about 50 and 25 kDa that was equivalent to N and M protein of SARS-CoV, respectively. S protein was not detected; it is likely due to the loss in long-term storage after inactivation and in the sample treatment, or together with the relatively low S protein content [11, 26] . Following the immunochemical reactions with the antiserum, two strong bands exhibited on the membrane (lane 2, Fig. 4 ) exactly at the corresponding position in the gel, whereas no color bands generated on the membrane with normal serum (lane 4, Fig. 4) . A convalescent serum of SARS patient was used, and the same positive result was obtained (lane 3, Fig. 4) , which further demonstrated the specificity of the antibodies induced with the inactivated vaccine produced from F69 strain.",

The results indicated that the specific IgG antibodies were produced after being immunized with inactivated SARS-CoV vaccine and the kinetics of the IgG-specific antibody was shown well regularity. The antiserum could specifically neutralize the SARS-CoV. The antibodies against SARS-CoV proteins (M and N) appeared in the antiserum by Western blot assay. Our results provided the evidence that the inactivated SARS vaccine can produce the specific antibodies and implicated the therapeutic application of the deactivated SARS vaccine.",
