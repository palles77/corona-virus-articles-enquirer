Also, a preliminary assessment was made of the diagnostic value of adding TFNA to conventional methods of clinical microbiology. We conducted TFNA under fluoroscopic guidance on 20 CAP patients (mean age 57 years, range 21-80 years). TFNA was performed under sterile conditions, using local anaesthesia. A 22-gauge needle, stylet removed, was attached to a 10-mL syringe containing 5 mL of isotonic saline; under fluoroscopic guidance, the needle was introduced into the pulmonary infiltrate. Four millilitres of the saline were injected into the inflamed area, leaving approximately 1 mL as carrier fluid in the syringe. Negative pressure was applied while the needle was slowly retracted. Chest X-ray images were taken during both inspiration and expiration 1-2 h after the TFNA procedure.",

The consensus sequences were compared with sequences in the GenBank database for identification using NCBI BLAST. Our diagnostic repertoire included real-time quantitative PCR targeting the fumarate reductase (frdB) gene of Haemophilus influenzae and the outer membrane protein (copB) gene of Moraxella catarrhalis, as described by Kais et al. [1] , and detection of Streptococcus pneumoniae using primers targeting spn9802 [2] . Pneumococcal genomic DNA was amplified in a QantiTect SYBR Green PCR assay (VWR International AB, Stockholm, Sweden), performed with a Rotor-Gene 3000 instrument (Corbett Research, Mortlake, Sydney, Australia). Dilutions of genomic DNA extracted from S. pneumoniae CCUG 28588, M. catarrhalis CCUG 18284 and H. influenzae CCUG 23969 (Culture Collection, University of Gothenburg, Sweden) were used as positive controls.
