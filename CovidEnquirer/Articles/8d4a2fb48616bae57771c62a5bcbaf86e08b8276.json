Specifically, they do not account for the spread due to transmission while in route, the evidence cited above notwithstanding. Recently, a model has been proposed that allows for transmission among passengers (15) . However, this model assumes that passengers mix randomly. Very little is known about how passengers and crew (flight attendants) mix on airplanes, enabling infection transmission. Given the restraints of time periods when passengers and crew must be seated and the physical restraints of seating in an airplane, it is difficult to believe that random mixing of passengers occurs.

This rate has been used in other transmission studies; see, for example, a simulation of influenza transmission in a high school in which contacts among students, faculty, and visitors were carefully quantified (17) . In (Fig. 3) we present heat maps illustrating the probability that each passenger will have close contact with the infectious index passenger and the probability that an infectious index passenger will infect each of the other passengers. The 11 nearest neighbors have a high probability of becoming infected. However, the probability of transmission to each of the remaining passengers is quite low, less than 0.03. On average, this manifests as 0.7 additional infected passengers per flight (IQR: 0.4-1.5). The results of simulations for other seats indicate, on average, at most two additional infected passengers per flight.",

We also present the results of qPCR panels assaying for 18 common respiratory viruses for 228 samples collected from the air and hard surfaces, and taken before, during, and after the 10 flights. Although eight flights were during influenza season in the northern hemisphere, all results were negative. We documented many movements on each flight, leading to many close contacts beyond those induced by close seatmates (tribes). Most nontribe contacts were very brief. Our simulations using these data, unique in explicitly examining the role of movement of passengers and crew, indicate that a dropletmediated respiratory infectious disease is unlikely to be directly transmitted beyond 1 m from the infectious passenger. Thus, transmission is limited to one row in front of or in back of an infectious passenger. This is more conservative than current public health guidance, calling for surveillance of passengers within two rows of an infectious passenger. Our simulations also indicate that an infectious flight attendant can generate several infections; thus, it is imperative that flight attendants not fly when they are ill.",

Some transmissions may have occurred while waiting in the airport, while boarding, or while deplaning. Alternatively, some passengers may have been infected by other sources before or after the flight. Three of the five flights in these case reports range from 9.5 to 14 h, providing many more opportunities for transmission. Other transmissions may have occurred via fomites. Flyers can protect themselves from fomite transmission by exercising careful hand hygiene. Finally, our model assumes that droplets are the main transmission route for influenza and SARS. This assumption is based on general public health agency guidance to health care providers, but it may not be true: significant transmission may also occur via smaller virus-laden particles (the smallest being aerosols), which have larger dispersion distances.",

Our model is not applicable to other aerosol-transmitted diseases, such as tuberculosis (18) , varicella, and measles (19) .

Such models require (square) and crew members (circle)], as calculated by our simulation program. Contact is defined as being within a 1-m radius at least once during a flight. For each target, the probability of contact is calculated as number of flights with a contact per 1,000 flights. Only crew and passengers within two seats laterally or one row fore to aft are likely to be in contact with this passenger, and all other passengers are much less likely to have contact. Although we use seat 14C to illustrate this finding, outcomes are similar for an infectious passenger seated in any aisle seat except in the first or last row, for which no passengers forward or aft, respectively, are in contact. (B) This seating heat map shows the probability of the passenger seated in 14C (triangle) infecting each of the other passengers (squares) and crew members (circle) when the probability of infection is set at 0.018 per 1 min of contact. In this example, passengers seated within a 1-m radius are at highest risk, followed by crew members. Nonseatmates in window seats have the least risk of infection from this passenger. Although we use seat 14C to illustrate this finding, outcomes are similar for an infectious passenger seated in any aisle seat, except in the first or last row, for which no passengers forward or aft, respectively, are infected. simulations using a 3D Navier-Stokes equation. According to Boeing engineers, airflow in an empty cabin lies on the \"boundary of turbulence,\" which is the hardest cabin airflow regime to simulate over long time periods. Previous transmission models have employed approximations to the 3D Navier-Stokes equation (20-23) (perhaps valid for short time intervals) or assumed that the \"droplets\" or aerosols are well-mixed in cabin air. In no case have previous investigators considered the effects of cabin occupancy or gasper use in Navier-Stokes models. One group conducted numerical simulations to study the effect of vortices generated by the continuous movement of a crew member on the local dispersal of aerosols in a cabin (24) . Assuming that the cabin airflow is at steady state, they found a decreased infection rate to the passengers but an increased infection rate to the crew member.",
