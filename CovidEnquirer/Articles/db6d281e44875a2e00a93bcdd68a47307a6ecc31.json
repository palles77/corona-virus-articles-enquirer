            "text": "Two species of membrane-associated glycoproteins have been identified in the coronavirus virion. They are readily distinguished on the basis of size, radiolabeling characteristics, and location in relation to the lipid bilayer. The larger glycoprotein is highly labeled by both radiolabeled fucose and glucosamine. This species is found in two forms, GP180 and GP90, with apparent molecular weights of 180,000 and 90,000. GP180 can be converted to GP90 in vitro by treatment of virions with trypsin. Analysis of tryptic digests of GP90 and GPl80 give identical peptide patterns. Based on pronase and bromelain sensitiyities, GP180/90 is the only protein which is located entirely external to the viral envelope. It appears to comprise the characteristic long, petal-shaped peplomers of the virion. The smaller glycoprotein, GP23, has an apparent molecular weight of 23,000 and is labeled by radiolabeled glucosamine but not by fucose. The level of glucosamine-labeling of GP23 is about l/10 that of GP180/90. GP23 appears to possess two distinct domains: a smaller, carbohydrate containing region which is found outside the viral envelope, and a larger portion, highly labeled by methionine, which is integrally associated with the viral membrane. A new nomenclature is proposed for the three major coronavirus structural proteins. The two envelope glycoproteins, GP23 and GP180/90 are designated El and E2, respectively; the inner core protein, ~~50, is designated N.",

The virus was then purified and analyzed by SDS-PAGE. No glucosamine label was de tected associated with any polypeptide in the gel (data not shown). In comparison, virus grown in the presence of [14Clamino acids and [3Hlglucosamine contained 3-4.5 x 103 cpm of 13Hlglucosamine in peak fractions of GP38 and GP23. This result is consistent with the conclusion that the glucosamine label found in these species represents covalently bound labeled carbohydrate. 1977) . SDS-PAGE of A59 virus dissociated in SDS at 100\" contained species with apparent molecular weights of 38,000 (GP38) and 60,000 (GP60).

However, only about 20% of the GP23 molecule is susceptible under these conditions. To account for this result it has been postulated that GP23 is composed of two domains, a smaller region extrinsic to the viral envelope and a larger portion which is intramembranous and perhaps spans the viral membrane (Sturman, 1977) . In order to determine which region of GP23 contains the glucosamine label, it was proposed to analyze the PAGE pattern of carbohydrate-labeled bromelain-treated virus. However, commercially available bromelain (Sigma, grade II) is a crude preparation which contains many glycosidase activities including /3-N-acetylglucosaminidase, (Y-and p-mannosidase, (Y-and pgalactosidase, and a-fucosidase (A. Tarentino, personal communication).",

Therefore, the labeled carbohydrate appears to be located on the segment of GP23 which lies outside the viral envelope. This carbohydrate-labeled portion of GP23 is not essential for the production of those species of lower mobility (such as GP38 and GP60) which arise after heating at 100\" and in the presence of /3-MSH or DTI', since p*18 also gives rise to similar anomalous forms (p*31 and p*48) under the same conditions (Sturman, 1977) .",

Thus the coronavirus virion contains two distinct glycoprotein species, GP23 and GP180/90. Conversion of GP180 to GP90 by Trypsin GP180 could be converted to GP90 by treatment of the virions with trypsin in vitro. As shown in Fig. 5 , incubation of A59 virions with 10 pg/ml or 1 mg/ml of trypsin for 50 and 150 min, respectively, at 37\" resulted in the loss of valine and glucosamine labels in GP180 and a comparable increase in both labels in GP90. The amounts of valine and glucosamine labels found in each of the virion polypeptides before and after trypsin treatment shown in Fig. 5 are given in Table 1 . The data are expressed as ratios in this table so that the proportion of each label in the same polypeptide species in different gels can be compared. VP50 was used as the internal standard for 13Hlvaline and GP23 for [14Clglucosamine. The sum of the 13Hlvaline in GP90 and GP180 before trypsin treatment equaled 35% of that in VP50. After trypsin treatment, which produced an approximately 90% reduction in label in GP180, the amount of 13Hlvaline in GP90 alone increased from 20% to 32-36% of that of VP50 (Table 1, Fig. 5) . Similarly the amount of [14C]glucosamine label found in GP90 &er trypsin treatment was equal to 88-96% of the sum of the glucosamine label found in GP90 plus GP180 before trypsin treatment (Table 1, Fig. 5) . Thus GP90 appears to be quantitatively derived from GP180 by treatment of viriens with trypsin in vitro. Virus infectivity was only slightly affected by trypsin treatment. Depending on the concentration of trypsin and condition employed, infectivity was changed by -co.3 log. None of the other structural polypeptides was affected by trypsin, and after isopycnic sedimentation of trypsin-treated virus in a sucrose gradient (unpublished data) less than 1% of the amino acid label had been released from the virion.",

The level of glucosamine labeling of GP23 is about l/10 that of the larger glycoprotein. Treatment of coronavirus virions with proteolytic enzymes such as pronase or bromelain causes complete removal of the surface projections from the virion and loss of GP90 and GP180. However, such treatment produces only a 20% reduction in the and treated as follows: one portion was kept at 4\" without trypsin, a second portion was incubated with 10 @g/ml of trypsin for 50 min at 37\", and the third portion was incubated with 1 mgl ml of trypsin for 150 min at 37\". The reaction with trypsin was terminated by addition of a threefold apparent size of the GP23 molecule. The segment which is degraded includes the region to which the glucosamine label is bound. Although the remainder of GP23, designated p*18, is inaccessible to proteolytic enzymes in the intact virion, it is sensitive to proteolysis upon disruption of the viral envelope in 0.1% SDS. Thus GP23 appears to possess two distinct domains: a smaller, carbohydrate-containing region which is found outside the viral envelope and a larger portion which is integrally associated with the viral membrane. Since only a small proportion of the GP23 molecule lies outside of the viral envelope, many of the potentially suitable amino acid residues of this species may be inaccessible for glycosylation.",
