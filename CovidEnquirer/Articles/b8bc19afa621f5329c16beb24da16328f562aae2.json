The American Academy of Pediatrics Clinical Practice Guideline defines bronchiolitis as \"a constellation of clinical symptoms and signs including a viral upper respiratory prodrome followed by increased respiratory effort and wheezing in children less than two years of age.\" 2 Infants with bronchiolitis often have abnormal vital signs. For children with bronchiolitis, respiratory rate is often higher than 50 to 60 breaths per minute, and often heart rate is increased as well. Elevated body temperature may or may not be present; when present, fever may reach as high as 41 \u00b0 C.

Increased work of breathing is manifested as nasal flaring, intercostal retractions, subcostal retractions, and use of accessory muscles. Upon auscultation, diffuse bilateral wheezes and crackles are often present; the expiratory phase of respiration also can be prolonged.

            "text": "Recently, there has been a notable increase in the number of other viruses recognized as etiologic agents for bronchiolitis. This is due, in great part, to the availability of highly sensitive, molecular amplification-based diagnostic testing. These other viruses include rhinovirus, adenovirus, coronavirus, enterovirus, parainfluenza virus type 3, influenza, and the recently identified human metapneumovirus (HMPV). 12 HMPV is a new paramyxovirus that was first isolated in 2001 from young children with respiratory tract disease. 15 It is now thought to be responsible for up to 19% of cases of bronchiolitis and is considered the second most common cause of bronchiolitis, after RSV. 16 As with most respiratory viruses, there is seasonal variation in occurrence. Peak occurrence is in the late winter/early spring in North America and Europe, which is slightly after RSV's peak activity. 17 PATHOLOGY Acute viral bronchiolitis is characterized by extensive inflammation of the airways, increased mucus production, airway cell necrosis, and some bronchoconstriction. 18 RSV, the most common infecting virus in bronchiolitis, binds to toll-like receptor-4 (TLR-4) on epithelial cells, fuses its membrane with the cell membrane, and causes both direct cellular and ciliary damage and an indirect inflammatory effect on the respiratory tract. 19 The infecting virus (usually RSV) then replicates, causing epithelial cell necrosis and ciliary destruction. 16 This cell destruction triggers an inflammatory response, and infiltration of the submucosa with both neutrophils and lymphocytes ( Fig. 27-1 ). Thick mucus plugs are created by increased mucus secretion from goblet cells combining with desquamated epithelial cells. These mucus plugs result in bronchiolar obstruction, leading to air-trapping and varying degrees of lobular collapse. These mechanisms cause ventilation-perfusion mismatch, and ultimately hypoxemia. 20 The immunopathogenesis of RSV bronchiolitis is still poorly understood. There is seemingly contradictory evidence regarding the role of T cells in the development of RSV bronchiolitis. Some studies show that specific T cells are required for pathology and actually enhance the severity of disease. 21, 22 In contrast, recent studies have demonstrated that CD8+ T cells can protect against RSVinduced disease. 23, 24 There is little doubt that T cells have an important role in RSV bronchiolitis. This is witnessed by the RSV vaccine trial in the 1960s in which the inactivated viral vaccine did not protect immunized children from natural infections. 25 In fact, it paradoxically led to more severe cases and two deaths in those who were immunized. Considering this historical issue and newer emerging evidence, it is likely that there are coexisting protective and disease-promoting adaptive immune mechanisms at play. 26 Future research should clarify this apparent conundrum.",

In a large survey of 30 children's hospitals in the Unites States, performing chest radiographs for infants with bronchiolitis was associated with increased likelihood to prescribe antimicrobials and increased length of stay. This is likely due to the fact that bronchiolitis-related atelectasis is difficult to distinguish from consolidation on a radiograph. 1 A study of the utility of chest radiographs in acute bronchiolitis included 265 children who underwent radiography after a clinical diagnosis of bronchiolitis. 31 Ninety-three percent of the patients had \"simple bronchiolitis\" evident on imaging. The authors also concluded that risk of airspace disease was particularly low in children with hemoglobin oxygen saturations greater than 92% with mild-moderate distress. 31 If performed, a typical radiograph for a child with bronchiolitis will demonstrate hyperinflation, flattening of the diaphragms, peribronchial infiltrates, airway wall thickening, and (occasionally) patchy atelectasis ( Fig. 27-2 ). 32 Currently, there is no evidence to support the routine use of radiographs in a child with typical bronchiolitis; further, there is no benefit evident, even if the child is to be admitted.",

If an infant can breastfeed, this should be highly encouraged, as it contributes to hydration and confers immunologic advantages. Breast milk has been shown to have neutralizing activity against RSV, 38 containing RSV immunoglobulins A and G as well as interferon-\u03b1. 39 It is estimated that approximately 30% of children admitted with bronchiolitis require fluid replacement therapy. 40 However, there is a lack of agreement on which method of fluid replacement should be used. Nasogastric feedings may be considered for a child who has decreased oral intake, with mild to moderate respiratory distress. When the respiratory rate exceeds 60 to 70 breaths per minute, there can be an increased risk of food aspiration into the lungs. 41 At this point, intravenous fluids should be considered for maintaining hydration. The evidence to determine the optimal route for fluid replacement in infants with bronchiolitis is currently inadequate. A large randomized multicenter trial is planned by an Australian pediatric emergency research collaborative, which may provide a definitive answer. 42",

However, patients receiving bronchodilators showed no improvement in hospitalization rates or duration of hospitalization. The authors of this review noted that the effectiveness of bronchodilators for bronchiolitis may have been overestimated, as many of the reviewed studies included patients with recurrent wheezing, a group thought to be clinically different from those with acute bronchiolitis. Overall, it would appear that short-acting \u03b2-2 agonists provide, at best, modest transient relief with no clear benefit to hospitalization rates or duration of hospitalization. As such, the AAP has recommended that bronchodilators should not be routinely used in the management of bronchiolitis.

Of seven trials comparing epinephrine to salbutamol in both the inpatient and outpatient setting, it appeared that epinephrine might be the preferred drug for outpatients. 49 However, there was insufficient evidence to recommend epinephrine use in the inpatient setting. A carefully monitored trial of epinephrine can be performed for an individual patient, and its use should be continued only if a documented positive clinical response is noted. If the decision is made to test an inhaled bronchodilator, the current state of the evidence would seem to support a trial with epinephrine, first, as it appears to have a slightly greater effect than \u03b2-2 agonists.

A recent elaborate Cochrane review of 27 studies involving 11,398 patients suggests that the use of clinical pathways in general is associated with reduced in-hospital complications and improved documentation, without negatively impacting length of stay or hospital-based costs. 82",

Hospitalization can be considered for infants who have a respiratory rate greater than 60 to 70 breaths per minute or a hemoglobin oxygen saturation less than 90%; those with a history of apnea; and those who are lethargic or dehydrated. Factors that may influence disposition determination include prematurity, very young age, pre-existing cardiopulmonary disease, immunodeficiency, or neuromuscular disorder. An infant's social situation and caregiver exhaustion also play a role in decision making. A recently published abstract has identified that gestational age, heart rate, respiratory rate, respiratory distress assessment instrument score, and oxygen saturation on room air were significantly associated with the development of severe bronchiolitis in a cohort of Canadian infants with bronchiolitis. 86 The utility of such variables for predicting need for admission have yet to be determined.",

            "text": "Frequent, thorough, and consistent hand hygiene has been shown to reduce the nosocomial spread of RSV. 87 This is a key infection-control principle both in the health care setting and in the home. RSV and other viruses can be spread through secretions, hand contact, and fomites. Viruses, including RSV, have been found on secretion-contaminated beds, toys, crib rails, and tabletops; such organisms can remain viable for many hours. 88, 89 The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention has published detailed evidence-based recommendations regarding hand hygiene and antisepsis in the health care setting. 90 Of note, they recommend that hands should be decontaminated prior to and after direct contact with a patient, after contact with inanimate objects in the direct vicinity of a patient, and after removing gloves. Hand hygiene with antimicrobial soap is recommended for visibly dirty hands; otherwise, an alcohol-based rub is preferred. 91 Currently, no vaccine exists for the prevention of RSV infection, which is the predominant etiologic agent for bronchiolitis. The development of a successful vaccine has been challenging, as immunity to multiple strains of the virus would be required. One would expect that a series of boosters would be necessary for the vaccine to be effective, as natural infection with the virus does not confer long-term immunity. 16 Passive immunization to RSV has been accomplished through the development of two different products. Their use is currently recommended for infants who are considered at high risk for developing severe RSV bronchiolitis. The American Academy of Pediatrics' Subcommittee of Management and Treatment of Bronchiolitis has outlined groups of infants whom they consider to be high risk for severe RSV and its complications, and for whom they recommend Palivizumab (Table 27 -1). 2 RSV immune globulin (RSV-IG) was the first form of immunoprophylaxis to become available. It was an expensive therapy that required administration of a large volume (15 mL/kg) of fluid over a long period of time (2 to 4 hours). In a moderate sized (n = 249 subjects) randomized, blinded, multicenter trial of RSV-IG, there was an increased incidence of adverse events in the subgroup of infants with congenital heart disease, thus RSV-IG is not recommended for this group. 92 Palivizumab is a humanized monoclonal antibody, and it has become the passive immunization agent of choice. It is administered as a monthly intramuscular injection over the 5 peak months of RSV season. In a large (n = 1502 subjects) randomized, double-blind, multicenter trial, palivizumab was associated with a 55% reduction in RSV-related hospitalizations, fewer overall days in the hospital, and a lower rate of ICU admissions. 93 These findings were further confirmed through similar results for a study of children with significant congenital heart disease. 94 Ease of administration and lack of interference with routine immunizations are the main considerations in choosing palivizumab over RSV-IG. Unfortunately, palivizumab is quite expensive, and it is estimated to cost $5000 to $6000 per season. Most of the economic analyses of RSV immunoprophylaxis have failed to demonstrate any overall savings in health care expenditure because of the large financial costs of immunizing all atrisk infants. 95-97 While the main advantage of palivizumab is related to its decrease in RSV-related hospitalizations, to date none of the five clinical randomized controlled trials have demonstrated a significant decrease in the rate of mortality attributable to receiving RSV immune prophylaxis.",

            "text": "The majority of infants infected with RSV and other bronchiolitis-causing viruses develop a mild URTI during the first few days of illness. While some will only have URTI manifestations, up to 40% will then progress to lower respiratory tract involvement (or bronchiolitis), with wheezing, crackles, and varying degrees of respiratory distress. 98 The mean duration of illness is 15 days, and the majority of these infections resolve uneventfully within 3 to 4 weeks. 30, 99 Of note, up to 25% of infants with bronchiolitis remained symptomatic after 21 days of illness, in a recent prospective cohort study highlighting the prolonged disease course of this acute illness. 99 Epidemiologic studies indicate that, while there is a very high degree of morbidity with bronchiolitis, there is low mortality. Over the last decades, it appears that mortality has remained stable for bronchiolitis. Of all children who are hospitalized with bronchiolitis, mortality rate estimates around 1%, 16,100,101 but rates are as high as 3.5% for children with underlying cardiac or chronic lung conditions. 102 Overall, rates of hospitalization have increased up to 2.4-fold. 7, 9 With bronchiolitis, apnea, or risk of apnea, is a cause for concern for caregivers and health care professionals alike and can often lead to hospitalization. Rates of apnea with RSV bronchiolitis range from 1.2% to 23.8%. 103, 104 In a recent systematic review, it would appear that the rates of apnea in previously healthy term infants is less than 1%, while infants with risk factors (e.g., prematurity and congenital heart disease) carry a greater risk of occurrence. 105 Occurrence of prolonged or recurrent apnea is a consideration with regard to intubation of a patient; the risk of requiring intubation for hospitalized children with bronchiolitis is estimated at approximately 5%. 100 Some studies have identified that up to 50% to 60% of children with bronchiolitis may have concomitant acute otitis media. 106, 107 Unfortunately, there is no clinical feature that can reliably distinguish viral from bacterial ear infections. While tympanocentesis can reliably accomplish this differentiation, it is considered impractical for the average clinician to engage in this practice. When identified, acute otitis media is best treated as per the well-recognized AAP/ American Academy of Family Physicians' guidelines. 108 Serious bacterial infections, including bacteremia, urinary tract infection, and meningitis are a concern when evaluating febrile infants, including those with bronchiolitis. A number of studies have shown that febrile infants diagnosed with RSV infections are at significantly lower risk of serious bacterial infection when compared to children without RSV infection. 1,109-111 If a child has a bacterial infection, it is likely to be a urinary tract infection. 109 Vey young febrile infants (younger than 3 months of age) with bronchiolitis require careful assessment for the source of their fever. For any febrile infant younger than 4 to 6 weeks of age, most clinicians would perform a full septic workup (including blood culture, blood count, catheter urine sample, chest radiograph, and lumbar puncture), and many would consider at least a partial if not full septic workup for infants between 6 weeks and 3 months of age. 112 There have been reports of children with inappropriate secretion of antidiuretic hormone associated with bronchiolitis. 113, 114 This should be kept in mind, and monitoring of fluid status and measurement of serum sodium levels should be performed, when appropriate, for infants receiving intravenous fluids.",

Local necrosis leads to intraluminal accumulation of fibrinopurulent exudate, inducing an overgrowth of the exposed myofibroblasts of the denuded submucosa. 124 The myofibroblast hyperproliferation leads to collagen and acid mucopolysaccharide deposition, with resultant narrowing of the bronchioles. Occasionally, a large intraluminal polyp known as a Masson body may develop secondary to histiocyte and capillary proliferation.",

            "text": "The clinical presentation of bronchiolitis obliterans may mimic acute viral bronchiolitis, but often without fever and rhinorrhea. Older patients may complain of dyspnea, cough, or decreased exercise tolerance. Physical findings are quite nonspecific, but expiratory wheezes or crackles may be heard on occasion. In the postinfectious setting, the infant may appear to partially recover from the acute illness, only to have persistent respiratory symptoms. Typically, the respiratory findings persist for more than 60 days. 129 Chest radiographs demonstrate dramatic hyperinflation and bilateral increase in interstitial markings. Bronchiolitis obliterans is most accurately diagnosed by microscopic examination of adequate biopsy material. Transthoracic biopsy with two tissue site sampling is currently recommended for definitive diagnosis. 124 Because of the invasive nature of this type of diagnostic testing, criteria were created in the 1990s to reflect bronchiolitis oblit-erans syndrome, and they take into account pulmonary function testing as a surrogate for graft dysfunction in lung transplant recipients. 130 High-resolution CT has become an important test in the diagnosis of bronchiolitis obliterans, with mosaic perfusion, vascular attenuation, and central bronchiectasis as key features. 131 The morbidity and mortality for bronchiolitis obliterans remains uncertain. Post-adenovirus bronchiolitis obliterans seems to have low mortality, but high chronicity. 132,133 On occasion, gradual resorption of the fibrovascular connective tissue occurs, with a restoration of normal airway caliber and epithelium. The treatment for bronchiolitis obliterans in children is often difficult and unsuccessful. Azithromycin, a macrolide antimicrobial, appears to have been effective in the treatment of bronchiolitis obliterans, presumably acting via its postulated anti-inflammatory effects. Corticosteroids have not been shown to improve outcome, and experimental therapies include immunomodulators, monoclonal antibodies directed at the interleukin-2 receptor, and aerosolized cyclosporine. 124 The ultimate option for children with severe bronchiolitis obliterans is lung transplantation.",

It is a long-term complication of postinfectious constrictive bronchiolitis of childhood. It also is associated with adenovirus pneumonia or bronchiolitis. 134 This syndrome describes the development of a unilateral hyperlucent lung with decreased vascularity and increased air trapping evident on plain radiographs. It develops due to postinfectious fibrotic healing of the immature lung, which leads to a decrease in the number of alveoli and pulmonary vessels. Imaging of Swyer-James syndrome demonstrates diffuse, asymmetric, patchy lobar or lobular air trapping that is almost often bilateral ( Fig. 27-4) . 135 Before the routine use of CT scan, it was believed that this syndrome was a unilateral phenomenon; this has since been disproved. 136 ",
