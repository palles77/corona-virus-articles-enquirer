            "text": "Calf diarrhea is one of the most important problems in calf rearing on dairy farms worldwide. Besides pathogens, several noninfectious management factors, especially management around birth, colostrum management, calf housing, feeding, and hygiene are important in the pathogenesis of diarrhea. To date, few data are available concerning calf rearing management on small and medium-sized dairy farms that are typical for Austria and the alpine region. Consequently, the objectives of this case-control study were to evaluate routine calf management practices on Austrian dairy farms and to examine differences in management between farms with and without the presence of calf diarrhea to identify risk factors. Overall, 100 dairy farms were visited. Of these farms, 50 were chosen based on the history and presence of calf diarrhea (case farms). Another 50 farms with no presence of calf diarrhea were chosen to serve as a standard of comparison (control farms). On farms, management was evaluated by face-to-face interview, and health status and hygiene were surveyed. Several calf rearing management procedures were similar on all of the visited farms, especially in areas regulated by national and European law. These factors include colostrum management and feeding. Consequently, no influence of these factors on the appearance of calf diarrhea could be detected. In contrast, other areas such as hygiene measures differed between farms and showed a partial association with the presence of calf diarrhea on farm. Variables related to diarrhea on farm were farm size; that is, the number of cows on farm. Farms with diarrhea cases were larger (median 40 cows, interquartile range 24.5 to 64.0) compared with farms with no presence of diarrhea (median 28 cows, interquartile range 18.8 to 44.0). Other risk factors that influenced the presence of diarrhea were the presence of other farm animal species on the farm [odds ratio (OR) 26.89, 95% confidence interval (CI): 2.64 to 273.5], frequency of cleaning of the calving area (OR 0.12, 95% CI: 0.02 to 0.79), the placement of individual calf housings (barn vs. outdoors; OR 0.02, 95% CI: 0.00 to 0.47), and the presence of respiratory tract disease (OR 52.49, 95% CI: 1.26 to 2,181.83). The possible influence of these factors on the appearance of calf diarrhea should be considered when farmers are advised.",

Similar results were obtained in a prospective cohort study by Frank and Kaneene (1993) . Pithua et al. (2009) compared the prevalence of diarrhea and other diseases in calves in regard to cleaning the calving area. In that study, the risk for diarrhea or any other calf disease was not different between groups, indicating that management factors other than the calving pen had a greater influence on calf health. Regarding colostrum supply, few authors could determine statistically significant effects. The origin of colostrum and route of colostrum feeding (nipple or bucket versus suckling) have been associated with the occurrence of diarrhea (Svensson et al., 2003; Lundborg et al., 2005) . Furthermore, the concentration of IgG was related to diarrhea (Berge et al., 2009) .",

On almost all farms (99), the owner or manager stated that each calf received colostrum within 6 h after birth; on 7 farms, calves were allowed to suckle their dam. Esophageal feeders were not routinely used on any of the farms, but this option was left for exceptional cases. Only on one of the farms colostrum quality was determined by use of a hydrometer.

The average number of cows per farm (34 cows in our study) was larger than the overall average in the 2 visited regions, with 18 and 21 cows per farm, respectively, as reported by the Austrian Association of Cattle Breeders (ZAR, 2010) . This might be influenced by selection of the farms being based exclusively on the presence of diarrhea. It is likely that very small farms might have been recognized as diarrhea problem farms less often because only a few calves were present during the selection period. This might have biased the outcome and has to be taken into account when interpreting the results. In this study, the presence of diarrhea was significantly associated with herd size. One possible explanation for the association between farm size and diarrhea could be that although farms in Austria have become larger in recent years, additional personnel were not employed on the surveyed farms. Even on farms with up to 115 cows, no employees were present, which could lead to a decrease in the time that the farmer can spend on calf care. Similar results concerning the association between the appearance of diarrhea and the herd size were obtained by Vaarst and S\u00f8rensen (2009) in Denmark. Furthermore, Frank and Kaneene (1993) identified an increased incidence of calf diarrhea for larger herds, explained by greater housing density that could lead to larger disease outbreaks. Kehoe et al. (2007) reported better colostrum management in smaller farms, which could also reduce the prevalence of disease in young calves.",

A calving pen was present more often on case farms in the current study than on control farms (P = 0.02). Cleaning of such an area after each calving significantly reduced the odds of calf diarrhea on farm, as shown by the multiple analyses. A consequent cleaning was performed on only 19% of the farms with a calving area. The increased appearance of diarrhea on farms with a calving pen could therefore be explained by a lack of hygiene and the use of this area for diseased animals. This might lead to a high degree of contamination with pathogens and consequently to high infection pressure on the newborn calf. We can conclude that regular hygienic measures in the calving area should be implemented to reduce the risk of calf morbidity, as shown in other studies (Frank and Kaneene, 1993; Bendali et al., 1999) .",

Time of first colostrum feeding, as well as colostrum quantity and quality, plays an important role (Weaver et al., 2000; Barrington et al., 2002; Svensson and Liberg, 2006) . According to the statements of the farmers on the visited farms, calves received colostrum within 6 h after birth (as required by legislation; European Community, 2008) on 99% of the farms. On 7 of these farms, calves were allowed to suckle their dam, representing a risk factor associated with failure of passive transfer (Trotz-Williams et al., 2008) . None of the factors associated with colostrum supply had a significant effect on the appearance of diarrhea in our study. This is in accordance with other studies (Bendali et al., 1999; Gulliksen et al., 2009 ) and can be explained by the high similarity between farms and by the fact that the time of feeding first colostrum is regulated by law. Another interesting finding in this context was that colostrum quality was not controlled on any of the farms except for one. Another factor examined was the use of a prepartum dam vaccination against rotavirus and coronavirus as well as against different E. coli, which was performed on only 17 farms. This prophylactic measure was performed on farms with and without diarrhea and had no influence on the presence of diarrhea on the surveyed farms. Possible reasons could be that not all cows and heifers on the farm have been vaccinated and the presence of other pathogens such as cryptosporidia.",

Individual calf housing is commonly advised because it may lead to a decreased pathogen load (Barrington et al., 2002) ; in epidemiologic studies, group size rather than grouping itself was associated with an increased risk for morbidity and mortality (Svensson et al., 2003; Maunsell and Donovan, 2008) . Nevertheless, in individual calf housing, it is possible to feed calves individually according to their special needs and it is easier to control animals and recognize certain abnormalities. Housing of calves outside the barn is thought to reduce the risk of disease (Marc\u00e9 et al., 2010) , as indoor housing has disadvantages such as an increased pathogen load and risk for disease transmission. This, however, was not the case on farms in the present study, in which greater odds for diarrhea were found for calves housed in igloos outside the barn compared with individual housing in a barn. This is in accordance with a study performed in the United Kingdom by Johnson et al. (2013) . Possible explanations could be the cold environment and exposure of the calves to considerably greater climate changes (Vasseur et al., 2010) . This could be true for the 2 areas of Austria visited in the current study because minimum temperatures were \u221214 to \u221219\u00b0C during December and January 2009 and 2010.

This procedure, however, does not take into account that these effects are of minor importance within the first 3 wk of life and that calves cannot meet their energy requirements by an additional intake of concentrates during this time of life (Jasper and Weary, 2002; Sweeney et al., 2010) . In contrast, several studies (reviewed by Khan et al., 2011; Silper et al., 2014) showed that milk fed at amounts greater than 10 to 12% of calf BW had a positive influence on the calf performance, whereas deficiencies in nutrition may lead to depressed immunity in calves and increase morbidity (Nonnecke et al., 2003) .",

Whole milk may have advantages over milk replacer in terms of greater energy content and a better balance of nutrients (Davis and Drackley, 1998; Godden et al., 2005) . This might therefore improve calf immunity and lead to a decreased disease rate (Godden , 2005) . Additional advantages of feeding whole milk are that it is easier and less error-prone than feeding milk replacer (e.g., errors related to products with inadequate protein or incorrect mixing ratios) and that both milk produced over the available quota and waste milk can be used (Vasseur et al., 2010) . Nevertheless, using whole milk and especially waste milk poses some risks, such as the transmission of pathogens and the transfer of drug residues to calves (Selim and Cullor, 1997) . In the present study, no effect of milk feeding management on the appearance of diarrhea was found. This might be due to the high similarity in feeding management between farms.",

Nevertheless, associations between respiratory tract disease and diarrhea in calves have been observed by other authors (Johnson et al., 2013; Woolums et al., 2013) . The association can be explained by a lack of hygiene and impairment of the calf immunity, which predisposes calves to different multifactorial diseases. Furthermore, one disease may negatively affect calf performance and consequently predispose to other diseases.

In contrast, other areas, such as hygiene measures, differed between farms and showed, in part, a significant association with the presence of calf diarrhea on the farm. Variables significantly related to diarrhea on farm were farm size, presence of other farm animals on the farm, cleaning of the calving area after each calving, placement of individual calf housing, and the presence of respiratory tract disease.
