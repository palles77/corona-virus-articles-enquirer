The infection can be community acquired or nosocomial. Bacteria, viruses, atypical organisms, and fungi are all known to cause pneumonia. In prospective research studies, a causative organism can be identified in nearly three quarters of cases of pneumonia. Respiratory viruses seem to be responsible for approximately 40% of cases of community-acquired pneumonia in children who are hospitalized, particularly in those under 2 years of age, whereas Streptococcus pneumoniae is responsible for 27% to 44% of the cases of community-acquired pneumonia. 8, 9, 10, 11 Although infection with Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae usually are considered to cause pneumonia in children of school age and in older patients, one study, in which preschool-aged children had as many episodes of atypical bacterial pneumonia episodes as older children, challenges this view. 9 In this study a bacterial cause was identified in 60% of cases of pneumonia, with S. pneumoniae causing 73% of the cases in which a bacterial cause was identified. Other bacterial causes such as Staphylococcus aureus, Moraxhella catarrhalis, group A Streptococci, Streptococcus milleri, and Haemophilus species (non-type b) were identified infrequently. Mycoplasma pneumoniae and Chlamydia pneumoniae were responsible for 14% and 9% of cases of pneumonia, respectively. The most severe disease occurred in patients who had infection with a typical bacterial organism or in the 23% in whom mixed bacterial (usually S. pneumoniae) and viral coinfection were identified. 9 ",

Having a chest radiograph significantly increased the likelihood of being prescribed antibiotics, however.

When pulmonary tuberculosis (TB) is suspected, consecutive early morning, preprandial, preambulatory gastric washings are indicated and are more sensitive than bronchoalveolar lavage. Induction of sputum using hypertonic saline may also be useful when TB is suspected, but this technique increases the chances of a typically noninfectious patient being rendered temporarily infectious during the procedure. 22 In hospitalized infants under 18 months of age a nasopharyngeal aspirate should be sent for viral antigen detection (such as immunofluorescence) with or without viral culture. 12 When significant pleural fluid is present, it should be aspirated and sent for microscopic aspiration and culture as early as possible during the course of disease, and a specimen should be saved for bacterial antigen detection. 12 If pleural fluid is associated with a complicated parapneumonic effusion, a sample of pleural fluid is likely to be obtained during the management of this complication, so in this circumstance an additional diagnostic pleural tap may not be in the best interest of the child. Lung aspirates are rarely performed, but the technique is safer than widely perceived and can provide a bacterial diagnosis in more than 50% of cases. 23 Lung aspirates therefore are more sensitive than blood cultures, but the organisms identified by this technique frequently are different from those identified by blood cultures taken in the same children. 24 The limitations of lung aspirates is that they are painful and result in a small (but usually clinically insignificant) pneumothorax, and the technique usually is limited to pneumonias associated with dense peripheral consolidations close to the chest wall. Lung aspiration in conjunction with use of nucleic amplification tests can potentially increase the yield further, 25 and therefore lung aspiration should be considered if the benefits of identifying the causative agent outweigh the modest risk of the procedure and equipment for and expertise in the management of the potential complication of a pneumothorax are available.",

Hib vaccine was introduced in 1990. The first report from a bacterial pneumonia vaccine trial in the developing world was from The Gambia in 1997, 39 where Hib vaccination reduced clinical pneumonia by 4% and radiologic pneumonia by 20%. No lung aspirates were identified as culture positive for Hib in children who received the vaccine in this study. A further study in Chile also confirmed the clinical efficacy of Hib vaccine. 40 An Indonesian study, however, in which coverage with chest radiographs was much greater than in the other two studies, found no evidence for reduction of radiologic pneumonia as a result of the vaccine, even though a reduction in clinically diagnosed lower respiratory illness was confirmed. 41 The first pneumococcal conjugate vaccine was introduced in 1990. Studies in the United States, 42 South Africa, 43 and The Gambia 44 have demonstrated its efficacy against development of clinically diagnosed pneumonia, severe pneumonia, radiologically defined pneumonia, and vaccine serotype-specific bacteremia or lung aspirate culture. 45 Newer vaccines that incorporate more serotypes than the nine included in the Gambian and South African studies are likely to offer improved efficacy when they are introduced. Because there are at least 90 pneumococcal serotypes, however, the risk is that serotype replacement eventually will result in diminished benefit from vaccination. The optimal schedule for administration of the seven-valent pneumococcal vaccine has not yet been determined. 46 As antibiotics become less effective against common bacterial causes of childhood pneumonia, the role of primary vaccination will become increasingly important. Vaccination decreases the circulation of resistant organisms and, in the case of S pneumoniae, the current seven-valent vaccine is effective against the serotypes most commonly associated with antibiotic resistance. 47 ",

The potential choice of antibiotics is wide but should be applicable for large-scale use in low-resource settings. Co-trimoxazole is a cheap and effective drug, and all the studies show that it compares favorably with other antibiotics for nonsevere pneumonia. A study comparing the efficacy of co-trimoxazole and that of amoxicillin for nonsevere pneumonia and examining the association with in vitro co-trimoxazole susceptibility found no difference in efficacy between co-trimoxazole and amoxicillin, despite high in vitro resistance to co-trimoxazole. 28 Another study comparing the clinical efficacy of twice-daily oral co-trimoxazole and twice-daily oral amoxicillin found that both were equally effective for the treatment of nonsevere pneumonia. 63 Three other studies comparing co-trimoxazole with chloramphenicol; 64 with procaine penicillin on day 1 followed by 5 days of oral ampicillin; 65 and with intramuscular procaine penicillin G or benzathine penicillin G in combination with procaine penicillin G 66 did not indicate any difference in efficacy with alternative antibiotic regimens. Another double-blind, randomized, controlled trial comparing a course of the standard dose (45 mg/kg/d) of oral amoxicillin for the treatment of nonsevere pneumonia versus a course of a double dose (80-90 mg/kg/d) found no difference between the two doses. 69 The only study assessing oral treatment for severe pneumonia concluded that home treatment with high-dose oral amoxicillin is equivalent to currently recommended hospitalization and parenteral ampicillin for treatment of severe pneumonia without underlying complications, 67 but a recent Cochrane review suggested that amoxicillin is better than co-trimoxazole for severe pneumonia. 29 Another study showed that the combination of parenteral ampicillin and gentamicin was more efficacious than parenteral chloramphenicol alone. 68 Based on these findings, the WHO has revised the guidelines for the management of severe pneumonia to include home treatment with high-dose oral amoxicillin or a combination of parenteral ampicillin and gentamicin for hospitalized patients.",

In addition to S pneumoniae and S aureus, P jiroveci, gram-negative bacteria, and cytomegalovirus are important opportunistic infections in this group of children. 80 The WHO developed revised guidelines for presumptive treatment of pneumonia in young children in regions where the prevalence of HIV is high. It is recommended that children admitted with severe pneumonia in HIV-endemic areas receive benzyl penicillin or ampicillin in combination with gentamicin, irrespective of age, and that all infants receive high-dose co-trimoxazole because of the high prevalence of P jiroveci. 81 There are no reported studies assessing the efficacy of these treatment guidelines since publication. A study conducted before the publication of the guidelines used the same recommendations and concluded that in children older than 1 year the WHO guidelines were effective, irrespective of HIV status. For those aged younger than 1 year, however, the guidelines were found to be inadequate, because nearly half of the infants did not respond to therapy. This failure was attributed to polymicrobial disease. 82 ",

All these treatment options are safe and effective. Chest drain with intrapleural fibrinolytics, particularly urokinase, 93, 94 and VATS 94, 95 have been shown to be effective primary approaches in the treatment of empyema, with a shorter duration of hospital stay, which is used consistently as an outcome measure. The failure rates are similar with both modalities of treatment. The cost of treatment with intrapleural urokinase is around 25% cheaper than VATS, and, because the expertise to perform VATS may not be universally available, intrapleural urokinase is advocated as first-line management. 94 A meta-analysis comparing the results of nonoperative and primary operative therapy for the treatment of pediatric empyema reviewed 67 studies. 96 Data were aggregated from reports of children treated nonoperatively (3418 cases from 54 studies) and from children treated with a primary operative approach (363 cases from 25 studies). Data analysis showed that primary operative therapy was associated with a lower mortality rate, lower re-intervention rate, shorter length of hospitalization, decreased time with a thoracostomy tube, and shorter course of antibiotic therapy, compared with nonoperative therapy. The limitations of this analysis are that most of the studies included were observational or retrospective case note reviews. The observational data from the analysis show that the length of stay is similar for primary fibrinolytic therapy (10.7 days), thoracotomy (10.6 days), and VATS (11.2 days). The analysis also suggests that current surgical options for childhood empyema seem safe, with no reported mortality and little morbidity, and that there is complete resolution of the disease, whatever the treatment.",
