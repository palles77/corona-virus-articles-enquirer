We aimed to evaluate the effects of the infection in Afghanistan, which is an endemic place for malaria and had severe socio-economical lost after the war. We also compared these data with the ones that were recorded before the war. Methods: Blood samples were taken from 376 malaria suspected patients who come to the health centre, established by the medical group of Istanbul Medical Faculty in 2002, Afghanistan. Blood samples were screened using the OPTIMAL Rapid Malaria Test and Giemsa staining method. Results: In 95 (25.3%) patients diagnosis was malaria. In 65 patients (17.3%) the agent of the infection was P. falciparum and in 30 patients (8%) agents were other Plasmodium species. Conclusions: Reported data of malaria in Afghanistan are limited by the only studies carried on Afghan refugees in bordering countries. In this study given data were collected from the present Afghan people living in their home country even after the war. We emphasized the increasing importance of the infection in Afghanistan where malaria is endemic and there is severe socio-economic damage after the war.",

Some infected individuals recovering from this infection become temporary or permanent carriers, harbouring the organisms in the gallbladder, biliary tract, or rarely in their intestine. The objective of this study was prevalence of S. typhi and S. para-typhi carriers among food handlers. Method: In this study, 210 persons who were working in supplying and distribution of the food-stuffs were investigated. The fecal samples from food handlers were collected and cultured on a suitable media. The organisms were identified by relevant antisera. The data was gathered through questionnaire and analysed using EPI6 statistical software. Results: Of 210 stool cultures, 5 cases (2.38%) were positive for Salmonella species. Two (0.94%) were S. typhi, two (0.94%) S. para-typhi B, and one (0.47%) Salmonella non-typhi. Positive cases were tested again after one month and one of them (non-typhi) was negative in culture. So, the rate of infection was 0.19%. Conclusion: Our results showed that prevalence of S. typhi and S. para-typhi carriers among food handlers in Hamadan was approximately similar to those in the third world countries. Since food handler carriers are at high risk for transition of organisms, which involved in foodborne diseases, they must be checked regularly for health.",

Methods: Presented study was performed in healthy children aged 13-60 months living in the region of Primary Health Care Unit Number 17, Antalya. A total of 378 children were selected for sampling. No child had been vaccinated before against Hib. Probable factors were asked to parents of the children affecting Hib natural immunity. Questionnaire forms were filled by us. Blood samples were taken from those children. Capsular polysaccharide specific IgG antibody (anti-PRP) levels were determined in the sera by EIA methods. 0.15 microgram/ml is accepted as positive limit level of anti-PRP IgG antibody. Dependent and independent variables were evaluated by statistical methods. Results: Antibody levels were below 0.15 l/ml in 10 (2.6%) and antibody levels were above 0.15 l/ml in 368 (97.4%) of children in the study group. No significant relationships were found geometric mean titres of antibodies with year's intervals (p > 0.05). Relationships were established between the Hib natural immunity and frequency of upper respiratory tract infection and bronchopneumonia (p < 0.05). No significant relationships were found between the natural immunity and age, gender, breastfeeding, socioeconomic level, attendance day care center, number of siblings, exposure to otitis media and sinusitis (p > 0.05). Conclusion: In our study we determined the natural immunity rate was high even in very early ages in Antalya. This fact should be evaluated by nation wide surveillance programme of invasive Hib diseases and nasopharyngeal colonisation rate before making a decision for Hib routine vaccination in Turkey.",

Rashidi (Shiraz, IR) Objectives: Aflatoxins are toxic mold metabolites produced by toxigenic strains of Aspergillus species. They have an important role in the occurrence of some human diseases such as liver cancer, chronic hepatitis and cirrhosis. When animals eat foodstuffs containing aflatoxin B1, these toxins will be metabolized and excreted as aflatoxin M1 in their milk. A aflatoxin M1 is resistant to thermal inactivation and is not destroyed completely by pasteurization, autoclaving or the other food processing procedures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the quantity of aflatoxin M1 contamination in UF and traditional cheeses in comparison with the primary milk contamination in Shiraz city (Iran). Methods: Forty-eight UF cheese, 48 traditional cheese and 48 milk samples which were used to produce those cheeses were collected from one of the cheese factories in Shiraz. The amount of aflatoxin M1 in these samples was determined by ELISA test Using Ridascreen Aflatoxin M1 kit (r-biopharm, Germany). Aflatoxins are Soluble in polar compounds so water phase of centrifuged milk samples and methanol phase of cheese samples, which were prepared with solvents such as methanol, PBS buffer and heptan were used to determine the quantity of aflatoxin M1. Results: Thirty per cent of milk samples had contamination more than maximum tolerated level (50 ng/kg). The range of aflatoxin M1 contamination in UF cheese samples was 27-137 ng/kg and that of traditional cheese samples was 25-88 ng/kg. So none of the UF and traditional cheese samples have contamination more than maximum tolerated level, which has been accepted by European countries (250 ng/kg). This study showed that in transforming the milk to UF and traditional Cheeses 61.9% and 77.1% of aflotoxins were eradicated in whey, respectively while 38.1% and 22.9% of aflatoxins remained respectively, which shows no statistical differences between UF and traditional cheeses in contamination with aflatoxins. Conclusion: Although 30% of pasteurized milk had contamination more than maximum tolerated level with aflatoxin M1, none of the cheeses, which produced from those pasteurized milk have contamination more than maximum tolerated level. We concluded that as aflatoxins are soluble in polar compounds, most of them will be gone out with whey and little of them will remained in cheeses.",

Methods: This descriptive study is done on 191 health care workers, working in teaching hospitals of Hormozgan university of medical sciences in southern Iran. Data is collected by giving a question are including questions about knowledge of healthcare workers (HCW) about standard preventing health precaution and demographic data. The results from questionnaires is analysed by EPI INFO2000 program. For finding association we used Fisher test and chi-square. We classified HCW according to scores that they take into four groups; a (good), b (moderate), c (weak), d (very weak). Results: One hundred and ninety-one health care workers participate in this program. 85.5% was female with average age of 31.8 \u00b1 5.6 .average work experience was 8.4 \u00b1 6 years. 4.2% of health care workers was in group a, 57.6% in group b, 35.1%in group c and 3.1% in group d. There was no statistically significant correlation between scores and age, sex or work experience but there was significant correlation between different hospitals and different wards. High scores was seen in paediatric hospital and in ICU, CCU and emergency ward. Conclusion: Results of this study showed that awareness of healthcare workers about preventing precaution is not enough in this university and educational program in this field is necessary. Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever is an Arboviral Zoonotic infection which several cases of that have been reported in Iran. Measurement of antibody level of Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever among local and imported sheep's in Isfahan province and presence of tick on their body are the main purposes of this study. This cross sectional study has been performed among 372 local and the same amount of imported sheep's, regarding to the presence of IgG antibody of Crimean-Congo Haemorrhagic Fever and tick on their body. The study was made with the special helps of Arbovirus laboratory of Iranian Pasteur Institute on 2002. 286 (76.9%) of local and 223 (57.8%) of imported sheep's have had seropositive results but these data were statistically meaningless (P = 0.094). Ticks have been found on the body surface of 115 (31%) of local sheep's but among imported one's were totally absent. The results of this study revealed the endemic spreading of CCHF in the sheep's in Isfahan province and it needs special attention to prevent the infection in the communities and occupational exposure. Objectives: Role of Helicobacter pylori (HP) in many gastrointestinal disorders such as peptic ulcer , gastritis, intestinal metaplasia and stomach cancer is established. In order to determine risk factors of its infection this study was done. Methods: Two hundred and thirty-two patients with gastrointestinal signs were studied. Endoscopy was done by internist and 2-3 biopsies from antrum was taken. Specimens were processed by Shandon tissue Processor (Citadel). Prepared slides were stained by Hematoxycillin and Eosin & also giemsa. Two pathologists and one microbiologist studied the slides. Patients, blood groups were determined. Patients, data including age, sex, smoking, residential status, clinical signs, pathologic diagnosis, blood group were recorded and then analysed. Results: Of 232 patients 130 (56%) were females and 102 (44%) were males. 222 patients (124 women and 96 men) showed HP infection . Frequency of infection in females was 95.4% and in males 94%. 88 patients (38%) were in age group \u00a330 and 144 (62%) in age group 31-80 years. HP was detected in 84 (95.4%) in first group and 136 (94.4% ) in second, group. 95.7% rural and 41.8% urban showed HP infection. The most frequent blood group was B (78%). All smoked patients and patients with history of smoking showed infection. HP infection in active gastritis was 98.3% and inactive gastritis with intestinal metaplasia was 64.2%. The most common symptom was epigastric pain and the least common was hiccup and vomiting. Conclusions: Frequency of HP infection is high (95.7%). No relation is between age , sex, clinical signs and HP infection. Persons with blood group B are more predipose to HP and smokers are high risk for HP infection. No difference is between urban and rural.",

Case: A Korean male who was 23 year old had traveled India and Thailand for two weeks on January, 2004. He had a first febrile sense on 10 days later after traveling and started watery diarrhoea over 10 times in a day for a week. Just after he returned to Republic of Korea, he visited outpatient clinic of Division of Infectious Diseases in our hospital. He had been drinking water in bottles which were not completely corked and foods which were sold on the side of the streets in India and Thailand. He was acute ill looking and patient's body temperature was 40\u00b0C, pulse rate 78/min, respiration rate 24/min, and blood pressure 120/ 70 mmHg. Physical examinations were shown that very dehydrated tongue and decreased skin turgor but no other remarkable findings. Laboratory findings were; in CBC, WBC 3,450/lL (neutrophil 67.8%, lymphocyte 18.2%, monocyte 13.8%), hemoglobin 10.9 g/dl, platelet 143,400/lL; in chemistry, AST 106 IU/L, ALT 71 IU/L, albumin 3.0 g/dl, total cholesterol 66 mg/dl; peripheral blood smear for malaria was negative; stool occult blood positive. We examined stool wet smear by microcopy and discover the trophozoites of Giardia lamblis. We prescribed metronidazole 500 mg tid po but patient's fever was not decreased after three days later. At forth hospital day, Salmonella typhi was isolated from blood culture. So, we added ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid po and then patient's body temperature normalized after four days later. Each antibiotic administered for 10 days and then he discharged hospital after results of follow-up stool culture were negative. But, three days later, he had high fever and was hospitalized again. Salmonella paratyphi were isolated from his blood cultures. It was a question why Salmonella paratyphi had not been isolated from previous blood and stool cultures and had not eradicated despite administer of ciprofloxacin. There were no outbreaks of Salmonella paratyphi in our hospital and his community. He had not eaten out during admission and after discharge. We prescribed ciprofloxacin 500 mg bid po again. After 10 days later, he was cured and had no recurred. Conclusion: Although we do not know the correct cause for late onset of Salmonella paratyphi bacteraemia, we suggest strongly that the co-infection of three pathogens was caused by foodborne infection during his traveling. Objectives: Ceftobiprole (BPR), formerly BAL9141, is the first of a new class of cephalosporins and has broad-spectrum activity towards a wide range of Gram-negative and Gram-positive hospital-acquired pathogens including MRSA. Pseudomonas aeruginosa (PA) is a common nosocomial pathogen, which has developed high resistance rates to various antibiotics. In this study we investigated the in vitro activity of BPR and other commonly used anti-pseudomonal antibiotics against a collection of clinical P. aeruginosa isolates. Methods: A total of 407 organisms originating from hospitals in Europe (Belgium, France, Germany, Italy, and Spain) (n = 204) and throughout the USA (n = 203), were studied. All isolates were non-repeat isolates from hospitalized patients during 2001-4. MICs of BPR, ceftazidime, ciprofloxacin, imipenem, piperacillin/tazobactam, and tobramycin were determined by broth microdilution according to NCCLS guidelines. BPR breakpoints used were 4 mg/L susceptible, 8 mg/L intermediate, and 16 mg/L resistant. Results: Similar other recent reports, 14.2 and 9.4% of isolates were imipenem resistant in EU and USA, respectively. At 8 mg/ L, 71.6/78.3% EU and US, respectively PA isolates were inhibited by BPR, compared to 76.5/79.8% for ceftazidime. The two drugs exhibited a high degree of cross-resistance.",

Kees (Regensburg, D) Objectives: The ketolide telithromycin has a focused spectrum of activity against respiratory tract pathogens, including penicillin-and erythromycin-resistant pneumococci, as well as intracellular and atypical bacteria. The aim of the present study was to investigate the penetration of telithromycin into nasal mucosa and ethmoid bone of patients to provide kinetic data. Methods: The study was designed as an exploratory population kinetics trial. A total of 29 patients undergoing rhinosurgery for chronic sinusitis were evaluated. The patients received a single oral dose of telithromycin 800 mg. Samples of blood, nasal mucus, nasal mucosa and ethmoid bone were collected during surgery 3, 6, 9, 15 and 24 h post-drug administration. Drug concentrations were determined by HPLC with fluorimetric detection. Results: The telithromycin mean (SD) concentrations 3-24 h after administration are listed in the Table. The achieved concentrations were generally above the MIC90 of common pathogens in upper respiratory tract infections (S. pneumoniae 0.12 mg/L, S. aureus [MSSA] 0.06 mg/L, M. catarrhalis 0.12 mg/ L; data from the PROTEKT surveillance study). The relative Clinical Microbiology and Infection, Volume 11, Supplement 2, 2005 systemic exposure, expressed by the ratio of the area under the concentration-time curve in tissue vs plasma, was 1.0 for nasal mucus, 5.9 for nasal mucosa and 1.6 for ethmoid bone, respectively.",

A better outcome was observed with the continuous intravenous administration of antibiotics; the pooled odds ratio for clinical failure (10 comparisons from 7 RCTs) was 0.73 (95% CI, 0.53-1.01) for the continuous compared to the intermittent intravenous administration. Regarding mortality (5 comparisons from 5 RCTs) and nephrotoxicity (5 comparisons from 4 RCTs), no differences were found; the pooled odds ratio and 95% CI for mortality and nephrotoxicity was 0.89 (95% CI, 0.48-1.64) and 0.91 (95% CI, 0.56-1.47), respectively, comparing the continuous with the intermittent intravenous administration of antibiotics. Conclusion: Compared with the intermittent, the continuous intravenous administration of antibiotics is more efficient regarding clinical effectiveness.

Based on in vitro activity, the new 8-methoxyquinolone antibiotic moxifloxacin (MXF) seems to be suited for the antibiotic therapy of these odontogenic infections. The aim of this experimental study was to determine the levels of MXF in plasma, soft tissue (M. masseter) and the mandible. Methods: Forty-nine male fasted albino Wistar rats (aged 6 weeks) weighing 190-300 g were used throughout the study. A dose of 10 mg/kg MFX dissolved in water was administered orally per gavage. Blood samples of 7 animals (6 MFX, 1 control) were obtained 0.5 h, 1 h, 1.5 h, 2 h, 4 h, 8 h and 24 h, respectively, after administration.

Conclusion: These preliminary findings suggest that single 500 mg oral dose of levofloxacin may ensure therapeutically effective concentrations in the sinusal mucosa of patients with chronic sinusitis. Of note, considering that fluoroquinolones exhibit concentration-dependent bactericidal activity and that optimal exposure may be achieved when peak-to-MIC ratio > 8-10 has been achieved, these data enable to conclude that a single 500 mg oral dose of levofloxacin may ensure effective exposure in sinusal mucosa against bacterial pathogens with an MIC < 0.8-1 mcg/ml, that is a value lower than the MIC90 of most pathogens usually responsible for bacterial sinusitis. Accordingly, these pharmacokinetic data are consistent with levofloxacin 500 mg once daily to be an effective antibiotic in the treatment of bacterial sinusitis.",

A consequence of these developments is an increased vulnerability to serious infection due to traditional pathogens (or commensals and relatively avirulent organisms) that may be resistant to multiple antimicrobial agents. There are few new antibacterial agents on the horizon. One strategy for dealing with this threat is to maximize the utility of each of our antibacterial drugs by dosing them more rationally. The purpose of this paper is to summarize the rationale for utilizing higher doses of levofloxacin in the management of serious infections. Methods: We have reviewed and will report on all available data from subjects exposed to daily levofloxacin doses of 750 mg or more. Results: After more than seven years of use in the US, levofloxacin has maintained its excellent susceptibility profile. Drug levels seen in infected patients are significantly higher than those achieved in healthy volunteers and enable coverage of organisms with higher MICs. Because of its concentrationdependent bactericidal activity, higher doses of levofloxacin increase the speed and thoroughness of bacterial eradication in vitro and can inhibit the emergence of fluoroquinolone resistance in studied organisms. Clinical trials with the 750 mg dose have been undertaken in complicated skin and skin structure infections, nosocomial pneumonia, and febrile neutropenia; results were at least equivalent to comparator agents. Use of this dose in community-acquired pneumonia and acute bacterial exacerbations of chronic bronchitis has allowed for more rapid resolution of symptoms and a shortening of the course of therapy. Dosing in healthy volunteers at does up to 1500 mg per day resulted in no significant alteration of the adverse event profile. Clinical trial data show that the safety of 750 mg daily is similar to the 250 and 500 mg forms.",

Conclusion: Isolated Pseudomonas strains demonstrate a high resistance to imipenem. In the investigation period, Pseudomonas strains resistant to meropenem were isolated for the first time ever. Considering that karbapenems are drugs of choice for the treatment of multiresistant strains, appearance of high resistance points to the necessity of their rational use.",

Abstracts discontinued. Routine susceptibility testing is performed in few and specialized laboratories only. Therefore data on activity of both substances are limited. The potency of resistance development against vancomycin and metronidazole is not known. Linezolid is a new antimicrobal agent active against grampositive bacteria. Methods: Selection of resistant mutants of the ATCC strain 43255 (MIC in mg/l for metronidazole, vancomycin, linezolid: 0.064, 0.5, 0.75) was performed on supplemented agar plates containing increasing amounts of the antimicrobials. Bacteria collected from five agar plates (after 48 h growth) were collected and centrifuged. The pellet was re-suspended and exposed to the next higher antimicrobial concentration on agar plates. Results: Repeating this procedure several times 7, 2 and 3 generations of bacteria for metronidazole, vancomycin and linezolid were generated, respectively. The bacteria were finally exposed to 5 mg/l metronidazole 2.0 mg/l vancomycin and 5 mg/l linezolid. Using Etest MHC values of 1.5 (23 \u00b7 MHC), 2 (4 \u00b7 MHC) and 2 (2.7 \u00b7 MHC) mg/l could be confirmed. Conclusions: TIG is a potent compound with a wide spectrum of activity against Gram-positive and Gram-negative problematic bacteria, with the exception of P. aeruginosa.

Cells attached to surfaces in biofilms can be more tolerant to various anti-microbial agents than their planktonic counterparts. In biofilm environments the cells have the ability to differentiate and change phenotype leading to severe treatment problems in many cases of persistent or chronic infections. An approach addressing this issue identified specific resistant subpopulations in Pseudomonas aeruginosa biofilms and indicated that differentiation plays an important role in this context. Biofilms were established in flow-chambers, and their development and responses to addition of colistin (a polymyxin) were monitored by confocal scanning laser microscopy and time-lapse recording together with use of live/dead staining. Initial results indicate that modification of LPS is an important factor in relation to colistin tolerance development and may be the initiator of cell differentiation as pmr mutant biofilms of PAO1 result in sensitivity to colistin.Results indicated furthermore a regulatory connection between the composition of the cell envelope and cell motility (twitching, swarming) and in that way a correlation between motility and tolerance to anti-microbial agents. Tube biofilm experiments were set up for isolation of colistin treated and non treated biofilm material and further analysis of changes happening in the differentiating population by use of micro Array and LPS analysis.",

The adequate antibiotics prophylactic is necessary part of the management of these patients. However, the disorders of microcirculation, which are typical for necrotizing pancreatitis, do not permit achieve the therapeutical concentration of antibiotics in inflamed pancreas. Due to that the continuous regional arterial infusion may have benefits in the management of patients with necrotizing pancreatitis. Methods: Ninety-four patients with SAP were treated. In 25 patients the antibiotics (ceftriaxone, gatifloxacin and imipinem) administrated arterially. These patients compiled the first group and the rest patients -the control group.",

Conclusions: In more than 50% of women under GP care the UTI etiological factor was E. coli. Fluoroquinolones and amoxicilin/clavulonic acid should be preferable drugs to use in GP, considering their wide-spectum activity. Considering costs, drug-sensitivity examination should be limited to antibiotics most frequently used in GP.",

The aim of this study was to genetically characterise the phenotypically ceftazidime susceptible and cefotaxime resistant ESBL-producing Klebsiella pneumoniae isolates. Methods: Species identification was performed with BBL Crystal E/NF, and ESBL expression was confirmed with E test ESBL. CTX-M genes were amplified with PCR using consensus CTX-M primers. The conjugation experiments were performed using Escherichia coli J53-2 (rifampin resistant). The CTX-M genes in the transconjugants was detected with PCR. The amplifield products were analysed with RFLP, assigned to distinct groups on the basis of RFLP profiles and further analysed using specific primers. The amplified products were sequenced. The isolates were also investigated by phagetyping, genomic fingerprinting by ERIC-PCR and PFGE and plasmid profile analysis. ",

Methods: The study area was \u00d4Blocks\u00d5 in a 10 Km. radius of Sir Ganga Ram Hospital, New Delhi, India. Microbiology Surveillance: MSU's were collected from all cases not taking antimicrobials and without suspected complicated UTI attending the OPD from designated region. Once E. coli (pathogenic as well as contaminants) were isolated and identified using conventional biochemical reactions its susceptibility was determined using Kirby Baur disc diffusion method on Muller Hinton agar. Antimicrobial use surveillance: Monthly purchase of all antimicrobial drugs from 30 private retail pharmacies was collected and converted to DDD. The denominator for the drug use was the population of the administrative areas in which these pharmacies are based. In addition, exit interviews (prescription auditing) were done at each pharmacy to have information on 15-25 consecutive prescriptions per month having any antimicrobial agent. Data on use is presented as DDD's per total number of patients/prescriptions. Results: During the study period (11/03-9/04) 3590 MSU samples were collected and 377 E. coli were isolated. 85% of the strains were resistant to ampicillin, and more than 50% were resistant to quinolones (60%), tetracycline, third generation cephalosporins, cotrimoxazole and ampicillin + sulbactam. Purchase data and exit interview data was analysed for 9 months and the results showed that fluoroquinolones are the most frequently sold antimicrobials. Exit interview data revealed that DDD/1000 prescriptions/patients/month for fluoroquinolones; penicillins, cephalosporins and macrolides are 2972,1296, 1034,884 respectively. Conclusions: The extensive usage of quinolones and penicillins are reflected in the antimicrobial resistance. A decrease in resistance to cephalexin from 85% to 41% could be noticed during the study period. The data collected on antimicrobial drug use and antimicrobial resistance in E. coli isolated from antenatal cases seems suitable for collection of information on the resistance and use in the community, valuable for planning targeted interventions.

The objectives of this study were to determine the global rates of bacterial resistance to telithromycin, the first ketolide antibiotic, and to evaluate the fitness of two telithromycin-resistant Streptococcus pneumoniae isolates relative to their putative isogenic telithromycin-susceptible counterparts. Methods: Minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) for telithromycin were determined by the NCCLS broth microdilution method and interpreted using NCCLS breakpoints. The isogenic relationships between telithromycin-susceptible and -resistant isolates (two independent sets) were determined by serotyping and multi-locus sequence typing.

This low rate of telithromycin resistance is observed across the globe, ranging from 0% in Australasia, the Middle East and North America to 0.22% in Central Europe. The development of resistance to telithromycin was accompanied by moderate reductions in W -32% in one strain and 25% in the other. Conclusions: Clinical resistance to telithromycin among S. pneumoniae is rare and low level, with a global prevalence of around 0.1%. In the two sets of isogenic strains examined, resistance to telithromycin was associated with moderate fitness cost (25-32%). These data suggest that the potential for S. pneumoniae to develop clinically relevant resistance to telithromycin may be limited. However, further studies are needed to examine the mechanisms of telithromycin resistance and the potential for genetic adaptation, which might reinstate bacterial fitness in telithromycin-resistant strains.

Klebsiella spp and Proteus spp. isolates were not significantly resistant to the antibiotics used. E. coli isolates were resistant as followed: 64% to ampicilline, 36 % to trimethoprime /sulfamethoxazole, 28% to amoxicillin/clavulanic acid (A/CA), 7% to cefuroxime, 19% to nitrofurantoin and 6% to ciprofloxacin (CIP). There was no resistance to ceftazidime (CFZ) and imipenem (IMI). Among Pseudomonas aeruginosa isolates 26% were resistant to CFZ, 28% to CIP, 22 % to IMI, 24% to tobramucin (TO) and there was no resistance to piperacillin/tazobactam (P/T).

Results: We report our experience with the management of a 44-year-old man with manifestations of Kyrle's disease. The patient presented with skin lesions of two different types on his face and upper and lower extremities. The old lesions were large hyperkeratotic plaques with burrows without signs of inflammation. The newer lesions were also hyperkeratotic plaques but they clearly had signs of inflammation. The patient was successfully managed with combined surgical and medical management. The hyperkeratotic old and large skin lesions, which did not have manifestations of ongoing inflammation, were surgically removed. In addition, antimicrobial therapy with oral clindamycin was administered for one month, which led to disappearance of the small newer lesions, which had findings of ongoing inflammation and were clearly part of Kyrle's disease. No recurrence was observed during 8 months of follow up. Conclusion: Although clindamycin may have some anti-inflammatory effects unrelated to its antimicrobial action, the observed control of the inflammation and the gradual regression of the newer lesions with clindamycin, suggest that microorganisms (probably anaerobic bacteria) play a role in the pathogenesis of the progression of Kyrle's disease at least in the initial stages of the skin lesions.",

Susceptibility testing was carried out by disc diffusion method. Case report: A male patient aged 71 years was admitted to the hospital because of acute gastroenteritis with watery, bloody stools associated with abdominal pain and myalgias. He was suffering from coronary artery disease and diabetes. The patient was pyrexial (380\u00b0C), dehydrated, hypotensive (blood pressure: 90/70 mmHg) and had generalized weakness. Abundant leukocytes and erythrocytes were seen on direct smears of stools. Admission laboratory data included WBC count 18.250/ll (neutrophils 84.6%), Ht 45.1%, Hb 15.9 g/dl, urea 64 mg/dl, creatinine 1.5 mg/dl, glucose 192 mg/dl, \u00ca 3.6 mEq/l, Na 134 mEq/l, CPK 11840 IU/L (normal value < 170 IU/L), CK-MB 124 IU/L (normal value < 6%), LDH 543 IU/L, SGOT 265 IU/L, SGPT 81 IU/L, \u00e3-GT 21 IU/L, albumin 3.2 g/dl and myoglobinuria. From the clinical and laboratory findings rabdomyolysis was diagnosed. The patient was treated with parenteral hydration and ciprofloxacin 400 mg tid iv. From the stool culture S. flexneri isolated. The strain was resistant to trimethoprime/sulphamethoxazole, ampicillin, amoxycillin/ clavulanic acid, tetracycline, chloramphenicol and susceptible to ciprofloxacin, cefotaxime, piperacillin. His condition showed gradual improvement. At the next days he was presented gradual improvement. CPK on the 2nd and 3rd hospital day was 4700 IU/L 900 IU/L respectively and had returned to within normal by the sixth hospital day. The patient was discharged on day 7. Conclusions: Rabdomyolysis complicating S. flexneri gastroenteritis is very rare. The present case is only the second found in the English literature. The possibility of rabdomyolysis must be considered in all cases of severe gastroenteritis so that prevention and timely treatment of complications are made possible.",

It tends to appear complicating an underlying cystopathy. EC consists of a vesical mucosal inflammation with encrustation of amonium magnesium phosphates in the urothelium. Their genesis requires pre-existing mucosal damage, urinary infection by urolithic microorganisms and alkaline urine. A 50-years-old man was victim of a traffic accident with multiple injuries. He was admitted in our ICU hospital and urinary catheterisation was perfomed for 20 days. Because of hematuriae and abdominal pain urine samples were collected. Corynebacterium urealyticum grown in the urine, and some foci of malakoplakia were found in the area of encrustation and endoscopically excised. Antibiotic treatment with teicoplanin and ciprofloxacin was fulfilled during 60 days. After 30 days of treatment, endoscopical resection of bladder wall was achieved for bacteriological data. Few cases of encrusted cystitis were reported this past years. We propose literature review and therapeutic options in this communication.

GBS arthritis has been rarely described in immunocompetent adults, usually associated with other risk factors as neoplasms, cirrhosis, diabetes. We present a GBS arthritis in an immunocompetent male patient. Susceptibility test was performed by disc diffusion method (according to NCCLS).The strain was resistant to aminoglycosides.

Finally, it was only after a detailed diagnostic work up that a patient who presented with recurrent fever and arthritis while on treatment for Brucellosis for 8 weeks was diagnosed with endocarditis of an artificial aortic valve. Successful management required prolonged treatment with a combination of antibiotics. Conclusion: The diagnosis and treatment of Brucellosis are usually simple. However, the successful management of its complications that can be severe, may require detailed diagnostic work up and prolonged treatment. Methods and materials: We analysed records of patients clinical materials from recent 2 years. We present 4 posttraumatic patients with severe GAS infections of soft tissues with cellulitis and STSS. All patients developed infectious complications following injuries. All cases required quick and aggressive surgical procedures-large incisions and removal of necrotic tissues; one of the patients needed multiple surgical interventions. Three patients improved in spite of severe course of infection; one patient died. Two patients suffered from head injury, two patients had injuries to the extremities complicated by extended tissue necrosis. Amputations of the limbs were not necessary. The course of infections was rapidly progressive with fever, extensive soft tissue necrosis and marked systemic toxicity. All cases required broad spectrum antimicrobial therapy-patients were treated with lincosamids, mainly with clindamycin given intravenously in large doses from 1800 to 3600 mg/day. In all patients microbiological procedures were performed: cultures of the wound and blood were obtained and sent for routine and anareobic cultures and for direct microscopic examination. Suitable diagnostic materials were: exsudate from the wound and fragments of necrotic tissues.",

In 72.5% of cases AM were administered orally (vs. 71.6% in 1998), in 24.7%intramuscularly (vs. 28% in 1998), 0.5% -intravenously, 2.3% -route was not indicated. Conclusion: Numerous AM were used for CAP treatment in 2003 as well as in 1998, but prescribing habits have improved.

Clinical Microbiology and Infection, Volume 11, Supplement 2, 2005 events of clinical significance occurred. On day 84 of his hospitalization, the patient developed pneumonia due to Staphylococcus aureus and Pseudomonas aeruginosa strains. He was managed with intravenous antimicrobial agents including vancomycin, gentamicin, and piperacillin/tazobactam, which led to clinical improvement. However, on day 96, the abovementioned isolates grew again from cultures of bronchial secretions specimens. Gentamicin was discontinued, and intravenous ciprofloxacin and rifampin were started. On day 117, the patient developed an extensive maculopapular rash on the trunk and the extremities. In addition, ocular and perioral swelling was observed. All antimicrobial agents were discontinued. On day 119, he developed bacteraemia due to Klebsiella pneumoniae strain. Intravenous gentamicin was started but it was discontinued one day later due to the flare up of the rash. Finally, on day 127, a blood specimen culture grew a MDR Acinetobacter baumannii strain, sensitive only to colistin. A continuous intravenous infusion regimen with colistin 2,000,000 units per 24 hours was initiated. The clinical condition of the patient gradually improved, and the rash gradually diminished. Conclusion: Continuous intravenous administration of colistin may be associated with fewer hypersensitivity (adverse) reactions and may be as effective as the traditional intermittent way of infusion.",

From the total number of isolates the members of enterobacteriaceae Serratia, Klesiella and Enterobacter spp were the most common cause of bacteraemia. The coagulase negative and positive Staphylococci were also frequently isolated. A changing pattern of causative pathogen was observed during this study between members of the three leading genera of Enterobacteriaceae. Antibiotic susceptibility testing showed a high level of resistance among the most common pathogens. Resistace to Aztreonam, Imipenem, Ciprofloxacin and piperacillin/tazobactam was less frequently encountered. Staphylococcus resistance to anti-staphylococcal antibiotic and due to hyperproduction of penicillinase enzyme was also high and all isolates were remained sensitive to vancomycin. Conclusion: Gram-negative bacteria especially members of the enterobacteriaceae are important causes of bacteraemia in neonatal intensive care units. Although most isolates remain sensitive to the new antibiotics, emergence of resistant strains can not be excluded in the future. For that reason new strategies and continuous surveillance are required to monitor the changing epidemiology of pathogens, antibiotic susceptibilities and antibiotic use needed to overcome the increasing incidence of resistance to conventional drugs.",

The patient had no neurologic deficits, and with the presumptive diagnosis of degenerative spondylosis, he has been treated with non-steroidal anti-inflammatory agents and physiotherapy for 3 months. Three months later, the patient had worsening of his back pain. Plain radiographs, computed tomography (CT) and magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) of the lumbar spine showed osteoarthritis of the lower lumbar facet joints. Facet joints injection was done using methyl-prednisolone acetate and bupivacaine hydrochloride 0.5%. The patient had temporary relief of his symptoms for 2 days followed by deterioration of his low back pain and acute onset of low-grade fever. Laboratory investigation revealed increased white blood cell count (16.010/\u00ecl), erythrocyte sedimentation rate (83 mm/1st hour), and C-reactive protein (185 mg/l). Spine infection was suspected and ciprofloxacin was administered (500 mg p.o. q12h) for four weeks. However, this treatment led to minimal improvement of the clinical symptoms. At the time of his admission to our institution, his main signs and symptoms included low back pain and tenderness, and increased body temperature. MRI, fine needle aspiration and cultures of the affected area confirmed the diagnosis of Pseudomonas aeruginosa spondylodiscitis at the L2-L3 and L3-L4 levels. The patient was treated with intravenous administration of amikacin (500 mg q12h) and imipenem plus cilastatin (500 + 500 mg q8h), for four weeks, followed by oral administration of ciprofloxacin for 24 weeks. At the latest follow-up, 6 months after the completion of the antimicrobial therapy, MRI of the lumbar spine showed significant narrowing of the L2-L3 and L3-L4 intervertebral spaces with no signs of active infection.",

All but one had pyuria (>50 leucocytes p. f), fever (>38\u00b0C) and were receiving extended spectrum antibiotics. Indwelling catheters were present in all four patients. Methods: The resistance phenotype was performed by Kirby Bauer and microdilution methods according to NCCLS guidelines. ESBLS production was confirmed by Double Disk Test (DDT) and E-test : cefepime/cefepime-clavulanic (AB BIODISK, Solna, Sweden). Biotyping was based on Wider II (Francisco SORIA Melguizo, SA) automated system results. The ERIC II PCR was used for the molecular typing of the isolates. Results: Although epidemiological data (time and space clustering) as well as phenotypic data (all strains showed the same resistant phenotype and the same biotype) were consistent with possible clonal spread of the same isolate in all patients, molecular typing revealed that only two out of the four E. coli ESBLS producing strains (isolated from patients who shared the same room) were similar and thus could be associated as part of the same outbreak.

The infections were 36 in 33 patients (1.71% of the total cases): 20 Urinary tract infections (UTI), 18 of which were catheter-related, 10 pneumonia, 5 blood stream infections (BSI), 1 of which Central Line Catheter-associated, 1 case of Pseudomembranous colitis. The device-utilization ratios were: 1.2% for CVC with an average catheterization of 7 days (103 central line-days); 19.9% for urinary catheter with an average catheterization of 5 days (1702 urinary catheter-days). A Central Line Catheter-associated BSI developed in 8% of patients exposed to CVC with a central lineassociated BSI rate of 9.7 &. An UTI developed in 6.1% of patients exposed to a urinary catheter with an urinary catheterassociated UTI rate of 10.5 &. One patient died because of nosocomial pneumonia (0.9% attributable mortality), 7 patients died having been diagnosed a nosocomial infection. The microbial etiologies of UTIs were: Gram negative in 11 cases, Gram positive in 10 cases, Candida albicans in 3 cases (4 patients showed two contemporary pathogens isolated); BSIs Staphilococci in 3 cases, Gram negative in 1 case, 1 case of Clinical Sepsis. Conclusions: Our study, comparing NNIS data, shows that nosocomial infections may be a problem also in Hospital Units not usually considered at high risk, probably due to advanced age and multiple comorbidities of the patients admitted. Despite a urinary catheter-utilization ratio within the norm, we observed a high incidence of UTI, which however showed an approximate 10% decrease during the period of our research.",

Material and methods: We identified the first 35 patients (20 male, 15 female), who were admitted in a newly established ICU during 3 month period. Tracheobronchial aspirates and urine cultures, were obtained every day during the first three days, and then, every second day after their admission to the ICU. Identification was performed with the PASCO system used according to the manufacturer's instructions. MICs of antipseudomonal drugs, except carbapenems, were determined with the PASCO microdilutionsystem and applying the criteria prescribed by the NCCLS. Susceptibility to imipenem and meropenem was determined by agar disk diffusion in accordance with NCCLS recommendations. A blaIMP, blaVIM specific product was amplified by PCR with crude DNA extracts using published primers and conditions. Qualitative data were expressed as percentages and compared by chi-square test. We considered p < 0.05 to be statistical significant. The p values are based on 2-tailed test results. Statistic analyses were performed using logistic regression (SPSS). Results: We isolated totally 43 multiresistant strains. 33 of those was P. aeruginosa strains,5 was K. pneumoniae and 5 A. Baumannii. All the P. aeruginosa strains were imipenem resistant, and among those only nine (27%), were blaVIM-2 positive. All the strains of K. pneumoniae and A. Baumannii, were blaVIM-2 negative by PCR. Among the total of 9 blaVIM-2 positive P. aeruginosa isolates collected, 22% were from urines and 78% were from bronchial secretions. Discussion: Risk factors for VIM appearance include: (A) Carbapenems administration (n = 0.002), fact that may be due to the augmentation in selections of the above genes under the press of the specific drug. (B) Administration of several b-lactam derivatives (n = 0.005), aminoglycosides (n = 0.039), and combinations between carbapenems-aminoglycosides (n = 0.026).",

Such findings may explain anemia of brucellosis, involving other cytokine production and modulating bone marrow hematopoetic progenitor cells. Further study is required in order to elucidate this enigmatic complication.",

Objectives: Clostridium difficile is a Gram positive anaerobic spore-forming rod. It is present in intestinal flora, in soil and it circulates in hospitals. C. difficile produces different potential virulence factors: a 308 kDa enterotoxin (toxin A) and a 270 kDa cytotoxin (toxin B). Toxin A is the major cause of enteric disease. Colitis can be determined by endogenous or exogenous causes and antibiotic treatment is the most important endogenous cause. The exogenous origin of the infection is referred to orofaecal contamination due to colonised patients. In 1997 an epidemic took place in a surgery division and this fact led to the formulation of an operative protocol for C. difficile associated infection. The operative protocol starts from CDC guidelines and is based on the enteric isolation of C. difficile. The protocol defines the hygienic procedures to be adopted in case of C. difficile associated infection. The target of the protocol is the prompt identification of the symptomatic patient and the subsequent application of procedures to avoid the pathogen's transmission.",

Purpose: The purpose of this study was to determine and associate PCT and CRP levels in serum of septic patients that were hospitalized in the intensive care unit for the last 10 months in Hippocration General Hospital. Methods: During a 10-month interval, 450 serum specimens were examined which corresponded to 92 I.C.U. patients. The PCT value in serum was determined using the immunoluminometric assay method (LIAISON-BRAHMS PCT) taking as normal values 0.10-0.50 ng/ml. The CRP value in serum was determined using the nephelometric method with high sensitivity reagents (Dade-Behring) taking as normal values 0-5 mg/l. Results: From the 450 samples of 92 patients, 143 (32%) had pathological PCT levels that ranged from 1 to 131 ng/ml and 87% of these septic patients had positive blood cultures. In all 450 serum samples (100%) were found high CRP levels that ranged from 3.0 to over 20.0 mg/l 35 (38%) out of 92 patients with sepsis died. Conclusions: Our study shows that: (1) The CRP levels remained high in serum measurements of the patients. (2) The PCT values showed some fluctuation (low and high). (3) The patients with high PCT serum levels also had positive blood cultures. (4) There was no connection between PCT and CRP serum levels. (5) High PCT levels remaining in the serum for a long time consist a bad prognostic factor for disease outcome. Objectives: To determine the usefulness of procalcitonin (PCT) and neopterin measurement as inflammatory markers in patients diagnosed of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD). To establish if differences are observed in PCT and neopterin levels during a clinically stable period, during an acute exacerbation, and during the process until resolution, as well as in COPD patients with pneumonia.

Background: Imatinib mesylate (STI571 -Glivec) is a selective inhibitor of the Bcr-abl tyrosine kinase, which deregulated expression is involved in the pathogenesis of chronic myeloid leukaemia (CML). We report a case of peritoneal tuberculosis in a patient with global lymphopenia following a four-month treatment with imatinib for a newly diagnosed CML.",

Abdominal CT-scan revealed homogenous hepato-splenomegalia, diffuse infiltration of mesenteric fat and ascitis. Ascitis was inflammatory with predominance of lymphocytes and remained sterile on culture. The symptomatology was attributed to an adverse effect of imatinib and the treatment was then interrupted. One month later, he was admitted because of worsening symptoms. An explorative laparoscopy displayed extensive chronic granulomatous peritonitis, and peritoneal tuberculosis was diagnosed by positive Mycobacterium tuberculosis PCR of peritoneal biopsies. Chest X-ray was strictly normal. At admission, he presented global lymphopenia (CD4 155 cell/mm 3 and CD8 39 cell/mm 3 ).",

To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of an infection suggestive of immune compromise after imatinib treatment. Imatinib is known to induce cytopenia. Moreover, two recent studies have shown that imatinib inhibits the activation and proliferation of T-cells in vitro and delayed-type hypersensitivity in vivo (Cwynarski et al. 2004 , Dietz et al. 2004 ) suggesting that imatinib might affect immunity and could lead to a higher than expected incidence of opportunistic infections. No epidemiological data are yet available to support this hypothesis. Of note, tuberculosis itself induces transient lymphopenia in HIV-seronegative patients and patients with CML are at risk for infection due to a possible dysfunction of the immune response.",

Design and methods: Sixty-five patients were studied during 290 VAD cycles. VAD was given by continuous intravenous infusion (CII) to hospitalized patients. The characteristics of patients and VAD schedules were retrospectively analysed to detect correlations with the incidence of BI. Results: By analyzing each VAD cycle, we found that profound hypogammaglobulinemia (p = 0.05) and post-treatment neutropenia (p = 0.09) were associated with a higher risk of infection, while renal function impairment was significantly correlated with BI risk at multivariate (p < 0.001) analysis. We evaluated only the first 3 months of therapy, characterized by a significantly higher incidence of BI than the later period (p < 0.0001).Continuous schedule (p = 0.07), and profound hypogammaglobulinemia (p = 0.01) were associated with a tendency to a higher risk of infection. The high probability of CII-related infection was demonstrated to depend on the frequent development of nosocomial infections. Conclusion: Patients with profound hypogammaglobulinemia who receive VAD as first line treatment are at a major risk of BI up to the completion of the third month of therapy. These patients require antibacterial prophylaxis with intravenous immunoglobulins which could be appropriate and effective. Objectives: M.

In this case report, we describe a patient with RA who developed massive pericardial effusion due to Salmonella. Methods: The patient, a 48-year old man who suffered RA for two years, was on low-dose corticosteroid and methotrexate treatment for the last four months. He presented with palpitations and retrosternal pain. On physical examination he was not in cardiopulmonary distress. Erythrocyte sedimentation rate was 80 mm/h and the leukocyte count was 11300/mm 3 . An echocardigraphic examination revealed minimal pericardial fluid collection which was considered to be due to RA and the dose of corticosteroid was increased. However, the amount of fluid increased and periods of fever (38\u00b0C) were observed. A pericardiocentesis was performed and 600 mls of purulent fluid was drained. The pericardial fluid cultivated to BACTEC system were passaged to Endo and Blood agar plates.

The aim of study to determine their role in immune response in patients infected with Echinococcus granulosus. Methods: Thirty-two patients with cystic echinocosis (CE) were studied and all underwent surgery. Serum levels of tumor necrosis factor-alpha (TNF-alpha), interleukin IL-1beta, receptor of soluble IL-2 (sIL-2R), IL-6, IL-8, nitrate/nitrate, and C-reactive protein (CRP) were evaluated before surgery, on first day, and three months post operation. Data were compared with those obtained from 30 healthy volunteers. Results: IL-6 was elevated in vast majority of CE patients (96.9%). IL-8 was increased in 12/32 (37.5%). Slight increases of sIL-2R, and TNF-alpha levels were found in limited number of them particularly those showing cysts in the central area of the liver (5/32, 6/32). IL-1 beta level was not elevated in any patient. CRP and nitrate /nitrate levels were also increased. A positive correlation between CRP and IL-6 (r = 0.78, p < 0.001) was found confirming the link between inflammation due to CE and activation of monocytes. All patients were completely recovered and studied parameters levels were declined to normal levels except one patient in whom recurrent disease occurred at interval of 2 years from the first operation. Conclusion: These results suggest that there are different immunoregulatory events and cytokines response during CE and may be in part related to slight monocytosis in CE patients. IL-6, NO and CRP were involved in the host immune response against E. granulosus and may be useful markers in diagnosis, monitoring CE management and evaluation surgical stress.",

Animals were sacrificed after 4, 15, 25 days upon induction. The ulcer area was measured with planimetry, the gastric blood flow/GBF/was determined H 2 gas clearance. Gastric biopsy was taken for quantitative and qualitative mycological investigation and for the histopathology. Plasma levels of IL-1b, TNF-a, gastrin were measured. RT-PCR expression of IL-b, TNF-a was evaluated in gastric tissue. Results: In rats inoculated with fungi, given ASA, gastric output was reduced in over 40% and GBF was decreased ,in comparison with rats given vehicle/group III/. The rats from group III showed progressive decrease in the area of GU by 13%, 45% and 95% at 4, 15 and 25 day, respectively. In contrast , the ulcers were present till 25 day in all rats inoculated with Candida . In rats given probiotic, decrease of GU area was observed more rapidly, in comparison with group I. In Candida colonized rats, upregulation of TNF-a, IL-b mRNA and the rise of plasmagastrin, TNF-a, IL-b, IF-c levels was recorded. Conclusions: 1. Fungal colonization could be achieved in rats by antisecretory or ASA treatment. 2. Fungal infection markedly reduces gastric secretion, delays gastric ulcer healing, probably due to fail of GBF at ulcer area and maintaining the mucosal inflammation, involving expression and release of IL-b, TNF-a. 3. Administration of probiotic reduces the delay of GU healing caused by Candida inoculation. Introduction: Helicobacter pylori are commonly associated with gastritis but only sometimes it causes clinically significant infectious diseases such as gastric and peptic ulcer diseases. The development of disease depends on the virulence of the infecting H. pylori strain, the susceptibility of the host, and environmental co-factor. The cytotoxin associated protein encoded by cagA gene is an important virulence factor that is produced by some H. pylori strains, and has been used as virulence marker in some populations. The aim of study was to determine the prevalence of cagA gene as a virulence factor on H. pylori strain types in Iranian GUD and PUD patients. Shigella sonnei is a major cause for diarrheal disease in developed as well as in developing countries. Epidemiologic studies of this organism have been limited by the lack of a simple and effective method for comparing strains. The study of epidemiologic markers is important in an attempt to trace the sources of infection. We used PFGE, ERIC-PCR to study the genetic relatedness of 78 isolates of S. sonnei collected in Seoul. For quantitative illustration of the relationships within a large body of isolates, computer generated dendrogram were used to determine the number of isolates in pulsotypes at Dice coefficients of similarity of 80%. From 2000 to 2003, 78 isolates of Shigella sonnei were isolated from patients in Seoul. By the PFGE experiment, Over 80% band similarity has divided 6 Group(A~F) band patterns. XbaI digestion produced about 40 fragments and their sizes ranged from 32.4 to 582 kb. Isolated from the same outbreak showed identical PFGE patterns, Most of the different outbreak strains and sporadic strains showed identical or different PFGE patterns. The ERIC-PCR technique successfully typed all isolates examined and produced bands in the 300 to 2,000 bp size range. The susceptible strains to Chloramphenicol, Amikacin and Cefoxitin was the most prevalent 100%, respectively. In case of the multiple antibiotic resistant pattern, the most prevalent pattern was NA-SM-SXT-TE, followed by AM-NA-SM-SXT-TIC-TE. During an outbreak of infection, the aim of bacterial typing is to provide laboratory evidence that epidemiologically related isolates are also genetically related. Isolated from the same outbreak showed identical PFGE patterns, Most of the different outbreak strains and sporadic strains showed identical or different PFGE patterns. We found that PFGE and ERIC-PCR have the highest discriminatory power for differentiation of strains of S. sonnei. ERIC-PCR fingerprinting is particularly useful because of its simplicity and represents a less time consuming procedure. We conclude that it is possible for a typical clinical laboratory to analyze a large amount of PFGE information on Shigella isolates obtained under controlled conditions. Such data analysis should enhance surveillance capabilities and give indications of further work to various aspects of bacterial pathogenicity of the species.",

Our working group is trying to discover a new antibacterial target highly specificic, selective and essential for survival of our pathogenic bacterial study model: Salmonella enterica serovar Typhimuruium SL1344 (STM). It presents as an important virulence factor its capacity to replicate intracellularly in epithelial cells, been necessary to develop a very complex molecular mechanism to improve penetration, intracellular survival and replication in the host cell. Focusing bacterial division process and specifically the mraZ and mraW genes, located at the beginning of the division cell wall cluster, we are trying to determine the potential character of this genes like a useful target in design of therapeutic strategies that will allow to limit infection and avoid the acquisition of antimicrobial resistance mechanisms. Since the pathogenicity of STM is given by its capacity to penetrate to non-phagocitic host cells, we have designed a deletion mutant of STM for the mraZ and mraW genes implied in the process of cellular division. This mraZWmutant was obtained by using a very simple PCR and homologous recombination technique. We first used a set of 60 nt-primers to amplify the chloramphenicol resistant gene flanked by FRT regions (FLP Recognition Target) followed by homologous regions of genes adjacent to mraZ and mraW genes. We then used the PCR product to transform competent STM cells containing the low number copies and temperature sensitive pKD46 vector, which express the red recombinase of phage lambda under the control of arabinose inducible promoter. Afterwards, we selected the chloramphenicol resistant mutant. Finally, this antibiotic resistance gene was eliminated using the pCP20 plasmid that shows ampicillin and chloramphenicol resistance, temperature-sensitive replication and thermal induction of a recombinase FLP synthesis. We have subjected this mutant to several tests like the in vitro intracellular infection test using non-phagocitics cell-lines: HeLa, NIH/ 3T3 and NRK. In parallel, an \u00d4in vivo\u00d5 test using a mouse model in order to determine the kinetic value of intracellular proliferation has been carried out.",

Recently moleculargenetic science has been applied in the field of diagnostics of sexually transmitted diseases (STD) in addition to the conventional culture-based and serological methods: the technology of in vitro specific DNA-amplification or Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR). The molecular methods have many advantages: high sensitivity, high specificity, option for standardization and Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is a member of the Retroviridae family. The HIV genome resembles that of other retroviruses with the typical gag, pol, and env gene organization. HIV establishes a permanent infection once the proviral DNA integrates into the host cell genome. HIV has been shown to infect a variety of cells, including peripheral lymphocytes, macrophages and other CD4+ cells. HIV is associated with immune system dysfunctions and, is responsible for opportunistic infections involved in AIDS. Transmission of HIV through blood transfusion and diagnosis of infection in hospitals and public health settings continues to be a worldwide concern. Polyclonal, mono-specific antibody against HIV recombinant p24 antigen, the capsid protein region, has been developed in rabbit and purified with gel filteration and affinity chromatography techniques. The purified antibody has been conjugated with the horseradish peroxidase enzyme and a capture enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) has been developed for detection of p24 Antigenemia. HIV-negative human sera failed to react with the developed assay, thereby showing the specificity of the HIV antigenaemia assay. Seventy-five human positive serum samples as well as human negative serum samples were tested for the presence of p24 antigen by the developed and a reference assay (Abbot Lab., USA). There was a 100% concordance when the samples tested with both assays. The results of this study showed that the developed p24 antigenaemia assay could be used for detection of HIV infection in human early before appearance of any detectable antibodies against the virus. This assay appears to be highly sensitive and specific to HIV. The test also has several advantages, including a relatively short test time and, most importantly, an adequate and reproducible supply of antibody to be used. Further research is needed to better evaluate the developed assay reactivity in a larger number of HIV positive sera.",

Bacteria L. pneumophila sg 1 are more frequent cause of severe pneumonia, less frequent are L. pneumophila other serogroups or other Legionella species. Examination of serum sample using ELISA IgA, IgM and IgG assays is the method of choice in our laboratory for detection L. pneumophila sg 1. For L. pneumophila non-1 or other Legionella species infection the microagglutination test has been used.In our study we determined the significant titre of serum antibody to some L. pneumophila non-1 serogroups and other Legionella species on the base of results of examinations of serum samples collected from blood donors. The titre of antibody was determined using 14 antigens prepared in-house from the reference strains L. pneumophila and others Legionella. Statistical analysis of obtained results allowed to determine cut-off titre for all used antigens. The value of cut-off was 64 for L. pneumophila sg 1, 2, 4, 5, L. longbachae, cut-off = 128 for L. pneumophila sg 3, 7, 8, L. micdadei, L. jordanis, and cut-off = 256 for L. pneumophila sg 6, 12, L. bozemanii, L. anisa. Using those cut-off points we are able to eliminate not significant titre due to some cross-reactivity of L. pneumophila serogroups.Determination of specific serum IgA, IgM and IgG antibody levels to L. pneumophila sg 1 by commercial ELISA is more sensitive, standarised, informative and faster than microagglutination test. However, from our point of view the microagglutination test should be used as complement test to ELISA, especially for diagnosis of infection due to L. pneumophila non-1 serogroups or other Legionella species. In 16% of all serum samples tested this year the significant titre of antibody specific to one of serogroup of L. pneumophila non-1 was found using MAT. In those sera increased but not significant level of IgM antibodies to L. pneumophila sg 1 (in range 0.32-0.75) or IgA antibodies (0.38-0.53) was determined by ELISA. It is probably connected with crossreactivity of some antigenic structures of L. pneumophila strains. Moreover, two cases of legionellosis due to L. micdadei were diagnosed. In those cases the antibiotic had been changed and the patients recovered. Because of unspecific symptoms and rather high mortality rate in legionnaires\u00d5 disease the microbiological diagnosis of Legionella infection should be done using as many supplementary techniques as possible.

Methods: The levels of CDT expressed by 30 clinical C. jejuni isolates, from patients with campylobacteriosis, were determined using a HeLa cell assay. The presence of the three CDT coding genes, cdtA, cdtB and cdtC was tested in these isolates by PCR. The presence and titres of serum neutralizing antibodies to CDT in the corresponding patient serum was also measured. Clinical data were obtained from these patients using a standardised questionnaire.",

During growth, U.u and M.h metabolise urea and arginine respectively resulting in a colour change of the medium, which contains phenol red indicator, from yellow-orange to red. This colour change is due to liberation of ammonia resulting in an alkaline pH of the medium. Mixed cell granuloma was the most common histologic feature, but suppurative granuloma was the most common histological feature (47.12%) in which AFB could be found, which was statistically significantly different from other types of granuloma. Tuberculoid granuloma was more common in the AFB negative group (10.53%) compared to the AFB positive group (9.37%) but the difference was not statistically significant. In cases that AFB could not be found, the inflammation tended to be located in the upper half of the dermis.

In mycological examinations in 5 patients the presence of septate mycelium was proved in direct preparations and in one case the presence of Aspergillus conidiophores was also stated. In 3 persons positive result from preparation was proved by culture. Moulds from genus Aspergillus was identified. In 2 patients isolates were recognized as Aspergillus niveus and A. candidus. In histological examination in 9 patients the presence of foreign body was also stated in lumen of sinus and numerous septate mycelium was also identified in preparations. All patients were treated with combined surgical and antifungal therapy using itraconazole and in one patient ambisone. Conclusions: Applied therapeutical procedure caused significant improvement of local and general condition of patients, which was confirmed by the results of mycological investigations and by the interview which took place along time after surgical operation. In one patient invasive form of aspergillosis was observed together with the expanding inflammation process to eye-socket and to lower part of front skull.

Objectives were to describe AmBd therapy, AmBd related AEs, and clinical outcomes. Methods: Retrospective chart review was undertaken in an academic centre in Geneva, Switzerland, on patients with IFI receiving AmBd as initial therapy. Data abstracted included: AmBd mean daily doses (MDD), AEs, clinical/microbiologic response to antifungal treatment (AFT), and mortality. NT: 50% increase in baseline serum creatinine (SCr) or if baseline SCr > upper normal limit, an absolute increase of 1 mg/dL. Success was defined as complete or partial clinical response to the At that time he was admitted to a hospital outside Croatia and treated for mixed bacterial (Streptococcus sanguis) and fungal (Candida albicans) sepsis with tricuspid valve endocarditis. His hospitalization was complicated by pulmonary embolism, femoral thrombosis and bilateral pneumonia that required bilateral thoracic drainage. His Candida albicans infection was treated with liposomal amphotericin B for 3 weeks followed by oral fluconazole. He was discharged in December 2003 in a stable condition and given fluconazole (400 mg/day) and methadone maintenance therapy. Case presentation: The patient was admitted to our hospital in March 2004 because two blood cultures taken in the outpatient setting grew Candida albicans despite continuous fluconazole therapy. Echocardiography was performed and a vegetation 2 cm in diameter was found on the tricuspid valve, and there was also a thrombotic mass 0.5 cm in diameter in the right ventricle. A 2-week course of liposomal amphotericin B with intravenous fluconazole (400 mg/day) was given, followed by oral fluconazole (400 mg/day). The patient became afebrile, however, a blood culture taken in May 2004 grew Candida albicans again. On June 2nd surgery was performed with excision of the vegetations on the tricuspid valve and in the right ventricle. One the day prior to surgery treatment with intravenous caspofungin (70 mg on day 1 followed by 50 mg/ day) was started. Candida albicans grew from the cultured vegetations, it was susceptible to fluconazole and amphotericin B. Intravenous caspofungin was given for 4 weeks followed by oral fluconazole (400 mg/day). In the following 4 months no recrudescence of endocarditis was observed. Antiretroviral treatment was started in April 2004 with a combination of stavudine, lamivudine and lopinavir/ritonavir. It was given throughout the course of illness and was well tolerated. Conclusion: Initial caspofungin treatment followed by fluconazole maintenance therapy, in addition to vegetectomy, was successful in the treatment of Candida albicans right-sided endocarditis in our HIV infected patient.",

It is widely distributed in nature and rarely causes disease in immunocompetent patients. A 69 year-old immunocompetent female patient was admitted to our hospital one and a half month after implantation of bilateral knee prothesis. She had no other underlying disease. Her complaints were fever, cough, hemoptysis, pleuritic chest pain and dyspnea on the 5th week after operation. She was hospitalized with the suspicion of pulmoner thromboembolism and anticoagulant therapy was started. The purulan drainage from both knees was noticed during the follow up. Polymorphonuclear leukocytes and Grampositive cocci were seen in the microscopic examination of the joint fluid. Teicoplanin treatment was begun. She improved, fever resolved but necrotic areas appeared during teicoplanin treatment. The pathological examination of the necrotic material demonstrated fungal hyphae and the culture grew Aspergillus niger. Amphotericin B was started along with debridman and the patient improved dramatically. After 42 days of amphotericin B therapy, both knees and the patient were well without prothesis replacement. She was still in good health three months after discharge. Conclusion: Prosthetic joint infections are troublesome complications of orthopedic surgery. Usually Gram-positive microorganisms cause such infections but in descending order Gram-negative bacilli or Candida spp. may be the causative agents. Aspergillus arthritis is a rare clinical entity especially in immunocompetent patients. Other interesting side of this case is the rescument of the prothesis with medical therapy and debridman only.",

Results: During 2002-2004 we studied 502 patients with different forms of pulmonary TB. Inoculation of clinical samples revealed strains of Candida spp. in 163 patients (32.5%). In 89.2% from this group culture results were confirmed by positive microscopy of clinical samples. We detected 8 species of Candida. Detection rate of C. albicans strains was 64%, C. glabrata -11%, C. krusei -9%, C. tropicalis -8%, C. parapsilosis -4%, C. kefyr -2%, C. guilliermondii -1%, C. lusitaniae -1%. Susceptibility to antimycotics (fluconazole, itraconazole, amphotericin B, ketoconazole, miconazole, 5-fluorocytosine) was tested in 328 Candida strains (211 strains of C. albicans, 41 -C. glabrata, 27 -C. tropicalis, 24 -C. krusei, 16 -C. parapsilosis, 5 -C. kefyr, 3 -C. guilliermondii, 1 -C. lusitaniae). Resistance to fluconazole was detected in 5% of all studied strains (in 2% strains of C. albicans, 15% -C. glabrata, 21 % -C. krusei and 4% -C. tropicalis). Resistance to itraconazole was in 7% strains (in 6% strains of C. albicans, 17% -C. glabrata and 15% -C. tropicalis).",

The identification is based on the species specific color and colony morphology, namely: pink-purple for C. albicans, dark turquoise and smooth for C. tropicalis, dark turquoise and rough for C. krusei and pale turquoise for C. glabrata. In this study we evaluated the performance of Candiselect \u00d2 4 for the identification of clinical yeasts isolates. Methods: A total number of 204 strains included 57 C. albicans, 43 C. glabrata, 18 C. krusei, 13 C. tropicalis, 23 C. parapsilosis, 7 C. inconspicua, 6 C. kefyr, 6 C. guilliermondi, 4 C. dubliniensis, 2 C. rugosa, 1 C. norvegensis, 1 C. lusitaniae, 1 C. lipolytica, 19 S. cerevisiae, 2 C. neoformans, and 1 P. anomala. 13 strains were obtained from BCCM IHEM Collection and 191 were a clinical isolates collected in Department of Microbiology Medical University of Wroclaw and identified previously using standard methods (e.g. ID-32C tests, BioM\u00e9rieux) and on the base of rDNA restriction fragment length polymorphism. As a quality control six typical Candida strains from ATCC and 34 bacterial isolates were used. The yeasts cultures on Candiselect \u00d2 4 medium were incubated at 37 (C for 4 days. The colony morphology and pigmentation were read visually after every 24 h. Results: A pink-purple colonies were found in C. albicans and C. dubliniensis only. After 48 h a color of C. dubliniensis colonies became purple-bluish and differ from C. albicans, which were purple-violet with a pink halo around. The color and colony morphology of all strains of C. tropicalis, C. krusei and C. glabrata were in agreement with manufacturer description. Among the remain investigated Candida and non-Candida species the colorless or white colonies were very seldom and different shades of blue and green were observed. There was a problem with discrimination between C. glabrata and some C. inconspicua, C. parapsilosis, C. kefyr, and C. norvegensis. The sensitivity and specificity values for C. albicans were 98% and 87%, for C. tropicalis 100% and 98.4%, for C. krusei 100% and 100%, and for C. glabrata 100% and 90%.

Mayr (Innsbruck, A) Aspergillus terreus is an uncommon but emerging fungal pathogen, which causes lethal infections often refractory to amphotericin B (AMB). It has been suggested that aleuriconidia might be the source of AMB resistance. This study used aleuriconidia as inoculum and compared the minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of AMB and voriconazole (VRZ) to those obtained for conidia of 31 A. terreus strains using a broth microdilution method. In addition, we examined the in vitro susceptibility of hyphae derived from aleuriconidia and conidia of A. terreus. The MIC ranges of AMB for conidia and aleuriconidia were 1.25-5 lg/ml and MIC90 was 2.5 and 5 lg/ ml, respectively. The MIC ranges of VRZ for conidia and aleuriconidia were 0.25-1 and 1-2 lg/ml, and MIC90 was 1 and 2 lg/ml, respectively. The MIC ranges of AMB for hyphae of conidia and aleuriconidia were 1.25-5 lg/ml, and MIC90 was 2.5 lg/ml; the MIC ranges of VRZ were 1-2 lg/ml, and MIC90 was 2 lg/ml. In conclusion, our data confirm that AMB MICs from A. terreus aleuriconidia do not differ dramatically in comparison to MICs obtained from conidia.

Observed discrepancies might in part be explained but not yet resolved taxonomy and may indicate the existence of not yet described species or the need for reclassification of strains. The technique can be seen as a fast identification technique for most of the routinely encountered dermatophytes. It worked especially well for the genera Arthroderma, Epidermophyton, Microsporon while Trichophyton species were more difficult to identify. Objectives: Victims of severe trauma are susceptible to opportunistic fungal infections such as zygomycosis, a rare but lifethreatening infection commonly caused by Rhizopus species. We describe the case of a child with necrotizing fasciitis caused by Rhizopus who was successfully treated with posaconazole (POS), an investigational triazole antifungal agent with in vitro activity against Zygomycetes. Case Report: A 12-year-old girl sustained bilateral haemorrhagic contusions of the temporal brain lobes, fractures of the skull and left tibia, and deglovement of the left leg after being hit by a truck. Drug-induced coma was initiated to control resistant intracranial hypertension. Initial treatment of the leg injury included almost daily removal of necrotic skin and muscle tissue and hyperbaric oxygen therapy. Thirteen days after the accident, Rhizopus spp and Trichosporon oviodes were cultured from multiple wound swabs. Subsequently, therapy with liposomal amphotericin B (LAMB) at 200 mg/d was initiated. Three days later, several areas of necrotic black ulcerations suggestive of invasive zygomycosis were observed, and the patient showed signs of sepsis. To avoid leg amputation, all suspected sources of infection were excised, daily hyperbaric oxygen treatment was given, and POS oral suspension (800 mg/d in divided doses) was added to the LAMB therapy. POS was given via nasogastric tube for the first 28 days and orally thereafter. After 2 days, most signs of sepsis disappeared, though the patient continued to experience fevers for the next 2 weeks. LAMB was discontinued after 9 days because drug-associated toxicity was anticipated. Necrotizing fasciitis responded gradually to antifungal treatment. Two weeks after initiation of POS, Rhizopus was no longer detected histologically or by culture of superficial tissue or muscle specimens. Objectives: Cryptococcus neoformans is an important pathogen in patients with impaired cell-mediated immunity and is the most common cause of fungal meningoencephalitis. C. neoformans is a facultative intracellular pathogen with several well-defined virulence factors that include the production of a polysaccharide capsule, melanin and growth at 37\u00b0C. Identification and characterization of enzymes produced by C. neoformans are important because of their potential role in virulence, induction of host immune response and for epidemiological typing.",

The enzymatic profiles of C. neoformans isolates were obtained by using the API-ZYM system (bioM\u00e9rieux, France) as a whole-cell assay with an inoculum of 106 cells/ml. The phospholipase activity was tested using the egg-yolk plate method. The ratio of colony diameter to the diameter of the colony plus the pericolonial precipitation zone on agar (Pz) correlated with phospolipase activity. Results: All tested strains were identified as grubii or neoformans variety by standard methods. The API-ZYM system is a screening test for the activity of 19 enzymes. Eleven of the 19 enzymes were found to be positive and no significant difference between two groups of isolates was observed. The activity of butyrate esterase was detected in 38 strains and activities of caprylate esterase lipase, leucine arilamidase and acid phosphatase were registered in 37 isolates. The activities of following enzymes were negative: lipase, cystine arilamidase, trypsin, chymotrypsin, alpha-galactosidase, N-acetyl-beta-glucosaminidase, alpha-mannosidase and alpha-fucosidase. Seventeen enzymatic patterns were identified according to the profiles obtained by API-ZYM system. Only one strain, isolated from an AIDS patient, was detected as phospholipase negative. There was no significant difference in phospholipase production between isolates obtained from patients with AIDS and lymphoprolipherative diseases (mean Pz, 0.52 vs. 0.55; p>0.05). Conclusion: We found no difference in the enzymatic activity between strains infecting two different groups of immunocompromised patients. Each enzymatic activity has its own pathway, which could be separately related to C. neoformans virulence, and it was recently demonstrated that extracellular phospholipase activity is a virulence factor for this fungus.",

In blood samples collected during day-time, 300 lm long microfilariae were observed in direct wet smear. Hematoxylin stain showed the external sheath and Giemsa stain the nuclei extended to the end of the tail. Microfilariae discharged by the female worm were preserved in destilled water in the laboratory at room temperature. On day seven both free forms and eggs were present. Haemonchosis, a disease caused by Haemonchus contortus is of considerable economic importance in sheep cattle and goats throughout the world. Severe infections in sheep may cause considerable morbidity and mortality rates; even more, moderate infections in lambs, may give rise to body weight reduction and in adults cause various degrees of anaemia and decrease the animal products. Control depends on repeated application of anthelmintics and therefore there have been many attempts to develop a vaccine against this disease.In a trial, in Ahwaz area, the ability of an experimental vaccine made from the whole gut homogenate of Haemonchus contortus was evaluated. A group of 5 Arabian female lambs were immunized twice with 100 lm whole gut homogenate (WGH) of Haemonchus contortus diluted in 1 ml PBS and emulsified in 1 ml Freund's adjuvant. The other group (5 Arabian female lambs) received 1 ml PBS emulsified in 1 ml of the same adjuvant. The first immunization was performed intra muscularly in the semi-membranous muscles of each hind leg. Booster immunization administered subcutaneously on day 21. On day 33 each lamb was challenged with approximately 10,000 Haemonchus contortus third-stage larvae. From the first immunization until challenge the animal were bled with an interval of 10 day and then weekly from challenge until the end of study. Sera were tested by ELISA and western-blotting. Lambs were necropsied 6 week post-challenge for recovery of nemetodes.Vaccinated lambs showed a 77% reduction in mean EPG, 75% reduction in mean male worm numbers, 80% reduction in mean female worm numbers and 78% reduction in mean total worm numbers. A significant difference in means optical density of sera in ELISA was noticed (p = 0.001). Proteins of Hemonchus contortus gut were seperated by SDS-PAGE. Then sera of vaccinated group indicated a high reactivity in western-blotting.",

However, 5% of the patients showed eosinopenia (down to 2%) within the first days, which correlated with the severity of the disease. The clinical features of these latter patients also included myocarditis, neurologic disorders and respiratory failure.Treatment of trichinosis is known to be not satisfactory. In prescribing the antiparasitic therapy, attention should be paid to the phase of the disease, its severity and the eosinophyl blood count. Our approach was highly individualised and consisted of both etiologic and pathogenetic (or symptomatic) therapy. The etiologic therapy aimed at destructing intestinal worms, preventing the development of cyst walls around the larvae, and destructing the Trichinella larvae in the muscle fibers. We used mebendazol 0.3 g every 8 h for 10 days. This etiologic therapy was most effective in the incubation phase or in the first days of disease, when localisation of Trichinella still remained intestinal. Vice-versa, therapy with mebendazol during the muscular period of disease not only was less effective but could also lead to a further exacerbation of the symptoms. The symptomatic therapy included antihistaminic and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs. In the most severe invasive forms, we used glucocorticosteroids (prednisolon 20-80 mg/day for 5-7 days).",

The evidence presented shows that the cellular mechanisms of immunity the of great significance in the pathogenesis of amoebiasis. Results: The inflammatory diseases of genitals were preceded and accompanied in half of the patients of leiomyoma. In 60% various combinations of pelvic inflammatory disease. The method ''the case-control'' has revealed a high risk of development of a myoma of an uterus (the relative risk of occurrence by a parameter of the attitude of chances is 1.75) in patients with inflammatory diseases of genitals. The bacteriological research of 80 myomatous units, has revealed the associated microbic flora in them, in comparison with non changed fabrics of a uterus. Identification of flora by carrying out 400 PCR testifies to presence Chlamydia trachomatis (mainly in submucous) and Ureaplasma urealyticum (in intermuscularsubserous) myomatous units, even at their absence before operation in underlying departments of sexual ways. Pathohistological research of non struck with a myoma uteruses, removed concerning endometritis in a combination with purulent tubo-ovarian formations in three women of 24-25 years old, has shown formation of the reclaiming rudiments consisting from proliferated, concentrically located smoothly-muscular cells (SMC) around the inflammatory infiltrates in myometrium-leiomyomatoz. Immunohistochemical researches with PCNA have established its accumulation in nucleus SMC in inflammatory mononuclear infiltrates zones in myometrium at endometritis, that is considered by us as the trigger of a myoma of an uterus. The conclusion: In our opinion, uterin fibroid embolization (UFE) is a prime method of a choice in treatment of a myoma of a uterus. In some cases there is a risk of secondary infection in degradation of unit or allocated myomatous detritus, that can demand hysterectomy. Taking into account all set forth above, before carrying out UFE, in our practice, we used: Fromilid 500 mg twice a day during 10 days + Tiberal 500 mg twice a day during 10 days.

A 2-month-old female infant was admitted to the paediatric clinic because of progressive and unexplained jaundice and light coloured stools. Symptoms began 20 days before admission. On examination, pediatricians found distened abdomen, hepatomegaly and enlargement of the spleen. The ultrasound test detected a tiny gall bladder, while during the HIDA scan test the radioactive dye could not flew through the billiary system. Blood tests showed the following: PT and PTT times were prolonged, repeatedly blood cultures were negative and serologic tests ruled out an acute infection with A, B, C and E hepatitis viruses, HIV, HSV, VZV, EBV, Rubella viruses, Toxoplasma gondi and Coxiella burnetii. CMV serologic study was based on the perfomance of ELISA ( DiaSorin s.r.l.) and IFA ( PANBIO, inc ) methods. Sera samples were collected on the 1st, 5th, 8th day after admission. CMV IgG antibodies were found positive by ELISA test (54 Au/ml, 60 Au/ml, 66 Au/ml, respectively ).

Methods: Normal skin, genital and cutaneous lesion specimens were collected from 6, 9 and 14 patients, respectively. Telomerase activity was detected by classical immunohistochemstry by using telomerase catalytic unit (hTERT) antibody. Specimens were stained with monoclonal antibody (Novocastra). Results: Staining pattern was located in basal and suprabasal location in normal skin specimens. However, telomerase activity in basal, supra basal and spinose layers was detected in all anogenital wart specimens but this staining pattern was detected only 7of 14 cutaneous specimens. Mean telomerase activity of the specimens was 66.9%, 61.7%, 27.6% in anogenital wart, cutaneus wart and normal skin specimens, respectively. No association in telomerase activity was determined between anogenital and cutaneus warts. The telomerase activity was significantly higher in HPV infection groups (cutaneus and anogenital) than in normal skin.

Thirtyone of the patients died, of those 26 died at their first admission. The most common professions were, drivers and workers. Eighty per cent of the women were housewives. Only one of the patients was university graduated. Heterosexual intercourse was the most common (86%) route of transmission. Blood transfusion, and IV drug use was the other routes. One male patient declared men with men sexual relation at the first interview, and 5 did after more detailed interview. Median CD4 count at the diagnosis was 198 (min 5, max 1051), and the mean viral load at the diagnosis was 122, 000 (min 400, max 107), 36% of the patients were grouped in C3 category at their first admission. The most commonly detected opportunistic infections were Candidal infections ( Results: Sustained virologic response (defined as an undetectable serum HCV RNA level 24 weeks after treatment was completed) was not achieved in any of 12 patients treated with interferon-alfa alone. Combination therapy with interferon-alfa and ribavirin was associated with better results: 4/10 (40%) patients still untreated with interferon-alfa, 2/4 (50%) relapsers, and 2/7 (29%) non-responders to previous interferon-alfa monotherapy achieved sustained virologic responses. Combination therapy with pegylated interferon and ribavirin has been used in 3 patients. Sustained response was achieved in one patient who had relapsed after treatment with interferon-alfa and ribavirin and in 1 of 2 non-responders to this combination therapy. There were no serious adverse events and it was not necessary to reduce dosages or even cease therapy prematurely. Conclusions: The efficacy and tolerability of antiviral treatment in haemophiliacs did not differ from other patients with chronic hepatitis C.",

Fourteen of them were co-infected with human immunodeficiency virus (HIV). Sera were tested for HBV genotyping by reverse hybridization line probe assay INNO-LiPA HBV Genotyping (Innogenetics) after a PCR sensitive amplification protocol. Quantitative HBV-DNA levels were determined using Cobas Amplicor Monitor kits (Roche). Detection of Hepatitis B e antigen (HbeAg) in patient serum samples also was performed using the ETI-EBK enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (DiaSorin). Results: All HBV genotypes (A-G) were found. The genotypes A, D, E and F were common and constituted 22%, 36%, 8% and 12% of the total patient population. Genotypes B, C and G were uncommon and represented less than 2% each one. Fifteen patients were infected with two HBV genotypes. On the HIV coinfected patients genotypes A, D and mixed (A + G) were prevalent. Only in 14 of the 87 patients was detected the presence of serum HbeAg, ten of them were HIV-infected, and it was associated with HBV genotypes A (30%), D (20%) and mixed genotype A + G (30%). Among the patients HbeAg negative genotypes D, A and F were more frequent 37%, 20% and 12% respectively. Analysis of baseline serum HBV-DNA levels in HBeAg positive patients revealed that were higher than 106 excepted in two of the three mixed genotypes. Genotypes B, C and G were associated with high levels of serum HBV-DNA. The lower level of serum HBV-DNA was detected in a patient with genotype D and negative HbeAg. Conclusion: Our data indicate that HBV genotypes A, D and mixed A + G were associated with a higher prevalence of HbeAg, and HIV-infected patients. Genotypes B and C presented higher serum HBV-DNA levels in HbeAg negative patients. Clinical Microbiology and Infection, Volume 11, Supplement 2, 2005 Methods: RNA extraction was done on serum sample from an IVDU who was chronic HBsAg carrier and anti-HD ELISA positive. Twelve pairs of primers were used to amplify six partially overlapping fragments, covering the entire HDV genome by RT-nested PCR. PCR products were purified and subjected to automatic cycle-sequencing procedure. Editing of raw data was accomplished by the Generunner and Chromas softwares. Alignment analysis of complete genome and HDAg amino acid sequences were carried out on IR-1 and eleven reference sequences. These analyses were done by ClustalW method, ClustalX software and subjected for phylogenetic analysis by applying neighbour-joining model for tree construction. Results: The majority of patients (90%) showed infection with genotype D, genotype A was the second most common (9%) and only 1 patient had mixed type (D and G). Polymerase mutants were identified in 49 patients (78%).The M204V/I mutant was observed in all (100%) YMDD variants of both genotypes D and A. The L180M mutant was detected in 4/43 (8%) patients with genotype D and in 3/5 (60%) patients with genotype A. There were no patients in whom mutation V/L/M207/I occurred. HBV-DNA was detectable in 64% of patients (baseline > 35 copies/ml). The prevalences of variants and viral loads were respectively the following: low viral load (10 2 -10 3 copies/ml) 25% mutants 75%, medium viral load (10 4 -10 5 copies/ml) 30% mutants 60%, high viral load (>10 5 copies/ml) 45% mutants 90%.",

The test was conducted to find infection of Hepatitis A virus (HAV) and the genotypes against twenty-six of the patients with fatigue and nausea. Fifteen isolates (57.7%) were amplified by RT-PCR using HAV specific primer, and then compared to 168 bp nucleic acid sequences in VP1/2A junction region for the genotypes. Based on 79% similarity, 13 out of 14 isolates were clustered with genotype IA and 1 out of 14 isolate was separated to IIIA. Above 13 isolates found in genotype IA were sporadic to Japan, China, and Korean strains which are grouped determined by it's geographic region with over 95% similarity.

The cytolysis syndrome was presented with a slight elevation of ALT (2-5 N) in majority of cases (except one case with infection with a severe form of hepatitis), such as billiary retention syndrome. The hepatoprive syndrome was light and medium in all cases except the patient already mentioned with varicella zoster infection in an immunodepressed person. There were no colestatic forms and no chronically cases or deceases. Conclusions: The secondary acute viral hepatitis presented a favorable evolution in almost all our cases.

We investigated whether the presence of precore mutant affects the response to interferon-alpha in patients with chronic hepatitis B. Study: Chronic hepatitis B patients who were admitted to the Infectious Diseases and Clinical Microbiology polyclinic in the last eight months were included in this study. Thirteen with hepatitis B e antigen-positive, hepatitis B e antibody-negative and ten with hepatitis B e antigen-negative, hepatitis B e antibody-positive (precore mutants) chronic hepatitis patients were treated with natural interferon-alpha 24 months. Before treatment, all patients had liver biopsy to grade and stage liver disease. Liver biopsy showed chronic hepatitis (necroinflammatory score 4), there was no cirrhosis and nobody had interferon therapy before. Serum HBV DNA level criteria to begin the therapy was 104 copies/ml for precore mutant strains and 105 copies/ml for non-mutant strains. Results: Serum HBV DNA level before treatment was not different between the two groups (p = 0.053). At the end of treatment, serum HBV-DNA was decreased to undetectable levels in 30% of mutant group and 23% of the non-mutant group. The decrease of serum HBV-DNA level was found significant (z = )2.66; p = 0.008) in mutant group and not significant (z = )1083; p = 0.279) in non-mutant group. Six months after treatment, the percentage of cases with a decrease in the transaminase level to Clinical Microbiology and Infection, Volume 11, Supplement 2, 2005 within the normal range was significantly higher in mutant group (p = 0.028) than in non-mutant group (p = 0.108).",

Objective: Human herpesvirus 8 (HHV-8) is the etiologic agent of Kaposi sarcoma. HHV-8 has been associated to other diseases such as primary effusion lymphoma, Castleman disease, bone marrow failure and oral cavity plasmablastic lymphomas (PBL) in HIV+. Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) is known as a cofactor in AIDS-related lymphomas. We report the case of an HIV+ male which presented with two HHV-8 related neoplasms: a colonic PBL and a sigmoid Kaposi sarcoma. To our knowledge this is the first case of colonic PBL in the literature, as well as the first case where these two malignancies are associated. Case: A 41-year-old male had a 3-month history of liquid diarrhoea, fever and malaise. He was known HIV+ for 11 years and had not previously received HAART. Physical examination was normal except for a facial lipoatrophy and small cervical lymphoadenopathies (<1 cm). Hemoglobin 9.9 g/dl, WBC 5030/mm 3 , platelets 227000/mm 3 , ESR 29 mm/h, creatinine 0.89 mg/dl, GOT 61 U/l, GPT 55 U/l, LDH 545 U/l, beta-2microglobuline 3.58 mcg/ml, CRP 4.82 mg/dl; CD4 135/mcl, HIV-1 viral load 302,000 copies/ml. PCR for EBV in the cerebrospinal fluid was positive. A colonoscopy showed a purplish lesion in the sigmoid colon and an ulcerated mass in the caecum; both were biopsied. The first one was informed as a Kaposi sarcoma and the second one as a PBL. A bone marrow biopsy showed lymphomatous infiltration. D4T, 3TC and lopinavir/ritonavir was started, as well as CHOP chemotherapy. The latter was stopped after the third course due to progressive deterioration. The patient developed a palsy of the III and VII cranial nerves. Opportunistic infections were ruled out and a spinal tap revealed lymphomatous meningeal involvement.

Repeated detection of HHV-8 has been described to increase the risk of active Kaposi sarcoma. We hypothesize that extra-oral PBL might also be related to HHV-8 as a cofactor, similar to EBV.

In the set of 18 newborns with confirmed congenital CMV infection, 11 of them have permanent neurological consequences involving motor of psychomotor problems. Five of them suffer from sensoric affection (4\u00b7 disturbance up to loss of hearing, 1\u00b7 strabism). Conclusion: The early diagnosis and management of congenital and perinatal infectious in neonate is important and this will depend on the clinical recognition of the condition. Unfortunately, early diagnosis is problematic. Many of these conditions have non-specific manifestations. As most maternal infections are asymptomatic, repeated serological screening of all susceptibile seronegative women would be required throughout pregnancy. This difficulty exemplified by neonatal herpes infection when early diagnoses and treatment is essential to prevent possible adverse consequences. Early initiation of therapy is of outmost importance every case of herpesviruses infection should be treated as soon as possible. Antiviral therapies have dramatically improved survival rates. Objective: Experimental herpes simplex virus type 1 infection in mice parallels that which occurs in humans. During primary infections, viral replication at the surfaces mucosal is detectable for a 10-to 12-day period. Within 24 h post infection (p.i) HSV infections are common and produce not only a primary infection, but also latent and recurrent infections. Following primary infection of herpes simplex virus type-1, the virus gain access to the termini of sensory neurons, transported in retrograde direction to the neuron cell bodies in sensory ganglia, replicates, spreads to other neurons, and establishes a lifelong latent infection in a portion of the neurons. Method: In this study we used PCR analysis for detection of HSV-1 latency in inoculated BALB/c mice. Thirty five to forty days after intraocular (IO) and intraperitoneal (IP) challenges in different groups, the surviving mice were euthanized, trigeminal ganglia (TG) were harvested, mouse TG was individually homogenized and cell pellet was used to detect viral DNA by PCR analysis .The TG pellet after washing with PBS, were suspended in Tris-EDTA containing .1%SDS and protienase K. After incubation in 55 for 5 h, viral DNA was extracted and PCR performed using two primers of thimidine kinase gene of HSV-1 that generated a 398 bp product. Results: We show that the rate of virus latency in IO infected mice is significantly higher than IP infected mice. Conclusion: Primary HSV infection of any of the 3 branches (ophthalmic, maxillary, mandibular) of cranial nerve V can lead to latent infection of nerve cells in the trigeminal ganglion then, after IO challenge we have more per cent of latency in comparison to IP challenge. Clinical Microbiology and Infection, Volume 11, Supplement 2, 2005 Methods: We examined 36 hospitalized patients with suspect HCMV infections (8 children and 28 adults) and 25 blood donors as control group. HCMV pp65 antigen in blood leukocytes were detected and specific IgM and IgG antibodies in sera wera determined by DF and EIA, respectively. The number of blood leukocytes was >2000/ml. Results: Active HCMV infection was diagnosed in22 adults and 6 children (77.7%) by pp65 antigen detection ,while in control group antigenaemia not found. In all cases IgM antibodies were positive in 31 patients (86.1%), IgG antibodies were positive . In 5 children (13.8%) was found seroconversion of IgG .In control group, Igm antibodies were negative, while in 18 of them (72%) igG antibodies were found positive. From the 6 children with active HCMV infection 2 had mononucleosis-like syndrome and 4 acute febrile infection. Adults in respectively from the 22 patients, 6 had mononucleosis-like syndrome, 4 acute febrile infection and 12 undergoing immunosuppressive therapy. The specificity and the sensitivity of antigenaemia assay for diagnosis active infection were 100% and 87.5%, respectively. Conclusions: In this study the pp65 antigen assay seems to be simple, rapid, inexpensive test for early diagnosis of active HCMV infection.",

To determine the predominant CMV genotype(s) in Taiwan, an island located in the southeastern Asia, we performed this study. Methods: We used restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) analysis to determine the subtypes of the HCMV gB gene, which encodes a viral membrane glycoprotein. A total of 101 clinical HCMV isolates collected island-wide were tested to determine their genotypes. Results: We found two major CMV gB genotypes, gB1 (52%) and gB3 (33%), in the paediatric patients. There were 9% of mixed gB types 1 and 3 and 6% of unknown types. None of them belonged to gB types 2 and 4. The reason that results in the significant difference of gB genotypic preference is unclear. Conclusions: Two major HCMV gB genotypes, gB thpe 1 and 3, are found. RFLP may serve as a convenient method for genotypic analysis of CMV clinical isolates.",

Serologic screening between cases and controls were significant, as well. These comparisons and demographic characteristics, such as age and gender were shown in Table 1 . Discussion: This study demonstrated that tick bite was the single significant risk factor responsible for this outbreak. Animal keeping, buying and selling is widespread in the region (83.3%). Domestic animals could be a source for tick exposure. However, some cases described certain areas out of villages for thick exposure, as well. One important point was that, cases were mostly scattered. Except few examples, they were mostly from different houses. If the live stocks are the source of infected ticks we would found clusters from same houses. The significant difference in the serologic survey between cases and controls supported this view as well. This study, in other words, indicated that rural areas with a heavy tick infestation must be the most likely source of this outbreak. However, more studies in the region are warranted to explore the source of this outbreak and eventually to control it.",

Until now, the epidemiology is not known too much and lately described species still appear. According to our experience the identification of clinical isolates of mesophilic aeromonads only as A. hydrophila, A. caviae, or A. sobria complex is no longer accurate. With proper identification system even so-called rare species can occur in clinical samples. Methods: 160 isolates of aeromonads originated mostly in stool samples. Biochemical identification was done by ENTEROtest24 (Pliva-Lachema), results were assumed by software TNW for oxidase positive fermenting rods. Cellular fatty acid analysis was performed by MIS Sherlock (MIDI, Inc., USA). Results: Genus specific tests such as resistance to vibriostatic agent O/129 (150 lg) and growth in broth culture with addition of NaCl (0%,1%,6%) confirmed, that ENTEROtest24 ensured good distinction of genera Vibrio and Aeromonas. In combination with TNW software ENTEROtest24 was useful for identification of common aeromonads. Nevertheless, due to permanent changes in taxonomy the supplementary conventional biochemical tests are recommended. Routine species identification of Aeromonas isolates by biochemical testing and fatty acid analysis proved the presence of species from complexes A. hydrophila (A. hydrophila, A. bestiarum), A. caviae (A. caviae, A. eucrenophila, A. media) and A. sobria (A. veronii, A. sobria).

A need for effective vaccine remains the preferred strategy for control of HSV-2 infection. Glycoprotein D (gD) of HSV has been focused on as subunit vaccine due to its primary role in inducing cellular and humoral immune responses to a herpes infection. In this study, HSV-2 gD was expressed in insect cells using the Bac-to-Bac Baculovirus Expression System in order to apply as a subunit vaccine in animal models. Methods: The HSV-2 gD of an Iranian isolate was amplified by PCR and cloned into pFastBac plasmid. The recombinant plasmid was transformed into E. coli DH10Bac cells containing bacmid, a baculovirus shuttle vector, for the site-specific transposition of the gD2 gene. The recombinant bacmid was confirmed by PCR, transfected into Sf9 cells, cultured in serumfree Grace's medium at 27\u00b0C and monitored daily for observation of cytopathic effects. After 72 h, the baculovirus was harvested from the cell culture medium. The viral stock was amplified by reinfecting insect cells and titrated as pfu. The Sf9 cells were infected with gD2-baculovirus and incubated at 27 ordm;C for various times to express the recombinant protein of interest. The cells were pelleted by centrifugation, lysed and subjected to SDS-PAGE before and after purification. The gels were analysed by western blotting using a monoclonal anti-gD2 antibody.",

Results: The data revealed that 95% of target population becomes seropositive after vaccination, while 94.25% of them had rubella antibodies before MR vaccination. Conclusion: Rubella is an infectious viral disease, which is endemic in Iran. The more detailed epidemiological studies are still needed to perform a national immunization programme. Based on the results, rubella virus is circulating among population in Iran, so it is recommended to selective vaccination of girls near the age of marriage. Objectives: One of the method of approach for chronic hepatitis B treatment is activation of T-cell immunity. For this purpose therapeutic vaccine containing HBc-ag can be used. Liveattenuated Salmonella are able to deliver both HBc-ag, encoded in prokaryotically expressed plasmid, and HBc-ag, encoded in eukaryotically expressed plasmid. Therefore such mentioned above two types of recombinant Salmonella strains were examined in experiments in mice and cell culture of human monocytes in vitro. Methods: Attenuated cya (lack adenylatecyclase) suppressor (CRP) mutant of Salmonella Enteritidis was used as a vechicle for both HBc-ag encoded in prokaryotically expressed plasmid pKHBc (vector's vaccine), and HBc-ag encoded in eukaryotically expressed plasmid pcDNA3.1pKHBc (DNA-vaccine carried in Salmonella). Mice were inoculated per rectum with suppositories containing 1,000,000 cells of examined Salmonella strains.",

Protein profiles for individual S. aureus strains and immunobloting results were analysed using GelD-OK software (Syngen Biotech). Results: Using Western-immunoblotting, the IgG lass antibodies were fund to react to S. aureus surface proteins of 14-140 kDa molecular weight while IgM class antibodies reacted with proteins of molecular weight of 25-94 kDa. In studies on the autovaccines IgM antibodies were detected directed toward individual polypeptides in 12 patients while no IgM class antibodies could be detected in the remaining 3 patients. In the subsequent time point of the study (after administration of autovaccine), in 12 patients IgM class immune response was found to resemble that documented before while the remaining, previously negative 3 patients this time carried IgM antibodies specific toward individual polypeptides.

Reasons for starting on ATV/RTV were 47.4% hyperlipidemia, 26.3% virological failure and 26.3% toxicities. 10.5% were coinfected (1 HBV, 1 HCV). 4/19 initially received ATV 400 mg daily according to the protocol, changing 6 months later to ATV / RTV. Median time on ATV was 6.5 months. Results: 5/19 patients had mild to moderate bilirubin elevations (2/5 were on IDV) before enrollment. After the initiation of ATV/RTV 15/19 patients (78.9%) experienced grade 3 or 4 hyperbilirubinemia (due to elevation of indirect bilirubin)",

The clinical onset of these cases is unexpectedly wide while the origin of complications is often concealed and detection of Ch. trachomatis plays important role to work out the problem-based treatment. The bone marrow and blood leucocytes culture system was adjusted to the investigation of Ch. trachomatis in vitro. This method helps to reveal concealed infection in chronic cases and observe behavior and kinetic of bacteria in cells and estimate the activity of infection according to the cell damage and dissemination of bacteria in cells. We investigated Ch. trachomatis infection in 25 active sportsmen with different unclear symptoms and revealed this infection in 20 of them. Besides in 15 sportsmen immune reactivity of organism according to the macrophage-lymphocyte rosette formation in vitro was significantly decreased while in the rest this index fell in the low range of the normal values. The sportsmen were treated by the combination of modern chemotherapeutical drugs (Josamycin, Asitromycin, Doxacyclin etc.) and immunomodulators. After clinically effective treatment immune reactivity of organism was improved and Ch. trachomatis bacteria was detectable in culture in 8 cases (though in some cells) pointing to the existence of bacteria in organism pointing to the necessity of further antichlamydial treatment.Our studies show that blood leucocyte culture is useful for the detection of chlamydial infection and for the estimation of immune reactivity of organism as well especially in clinically unclear cases.",

Cisterna (Bilbao, E)Background: The human T-cell leukaemia virus type I (HTLV-I), is the etiological agent of adult T-cell leukaemia-lymphoma (ATLL) and HTLV-I associated mielopathy/tropical spastic paraparsis (HAM/TSP). In HIV coinfected patients only rare cases of cutaneous T-cell lymphoma. HTLV-I infect T cells and reverse transcribe its RNA into DNA, witch integrates into the host cell genoma. The aim of our study was to evaluate a PCR technique for the diagnosis of HTLV-I infection in clinical samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs). Materials and Methods: A PCR approach was adopted to detect HTLV-1 infection in clinical samples of peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from subjects with leukaemia and/ or lymphoma from Basurto Hospital. The PCR was designed using primers from the pol and tax genes of human T cell leukaemia virus type I. The assay reliably detected a single copy of HTLV-I proviral genome in DNA from 1 x 105 PBMCs. We also included in each sample the HLA DQ alpha gene to check the presence of PCR inhibitors and the quality of DNA extraction. As positive control we used HTLV-I infected MT-2 cell line maintained in RPMI, supplemented with FBS, glutamine, penicillin and streptomycin. Results: After analyzing 30 patients, all of then presented the band of the HLA DQ alpha gene (242 bp), indicating that the PCR had been carried out under good conditions. Our results showed that the PCR quickly solved the diagnostic query, detecting the presence of proviral HTLV-I DNA in two of 30 patients in both genes (188 bp for pol gene, and 156 bp for tax gene). Conclusion: The main advantage of this method is the rapidity (5-6 hours) of the performance of the assay and its sensitivity is comparable with other HTLV-I PCR formats. Both genes, pol and tax, could be used to evaluate HTLV-I viral infection in PBMCs clinical samples.R2181 Quantitation of CMV, EBV and HBV using new sensitive real-time PCR assays N. Finnstrom, A-M.

(Pozna\u00f1 , PL) Objective: The studies aimed at evaluation of serological markers of Epstein-Barr virus (EBV) infection and presence of EBV DNA in the gastric carcinoma (GC) material. Methods: The studies were performed on 21 patients, aged 42-68 years, in whom advanced GC was diagnosed by histological methods. Sera of the patients were tested for EBV DNA (Sharp Signal System; Digene), IgG-anti-EA antibodies (ETI-EA-G; DiaSorin), antibodies directed to VCA (ETI-VCA-M, ETI-VCA-G; DiaSorin) and IgG-anti-EBNA antibodies (ETI-EBNA-G; DiaSorin). In parallel, in the GC material EBV-encoded small RNA (EBER) particles were detected using in situ hybridization (ISH) and ISH Detection Kit (DakoCytomation). Results: Basing on serological markers (serum IgG-anti-VCA and IgG-anti-EBNA antibodies), past EBV infection was documented in 20 patients. In one patient no anti-EBV antibodies were detected. In 12 of the patients positive reaction for EBER was documented in the nuclei of carcinoma cells, while 11 of them demonstrated presence of EBV DNA in the serum. The 9 remaining patients manifested neither positive signals in EBER-ISH nor presence of EBV DNA in the serum.

The incidence of inadequate empirical antibiotic treatment was 42.1%, and the related mortality rate for CNSB was 15.7% (not significantly different from the mean of mortality by other significant microorganisms, 23.4%). By multivariate analysis the factors related to mortality were septic shock, inadequate empirical antimicrobial treatment, Staphylococcus aureus bacteraemia and Apache II, but not CNSB. Conclusions: CNSB is a significant cause of mortality in critically ill patients with nosocomial bacteraemia. Almost all cases were considered primary bacteraemias, probably related to intravascular invasive procedures.

Kresken, D. Hafner, F.-J. Schmitz, T.A. Wichelhaus on behalf of the Working Group for Antimicrobial Resistance of the Paul-Ehrlich-Society for ChemotherapyObjectives: Enterobacter cloacae and Citrobacter freundii frequently cause nosocomial infections. Both species produce chromosomal AmpC beta-lactamases. In addition, strains may become resistant to other antimicrobial drug classes. The objective of this study was to evaluate the in vitro susceptibilities of clinical isolates of E. cloacae and C. freundii to various frequently used broad-spectrum antibacterial agents. Methods: In November 2001, a total of 234 isolates of E. cloacae and 73 isolates of C. freundii were prospectively collected from 26 microbiology laboratories distributed throughout three Central European countries (Austria, Germany, and Switzerland). Minimal inhibitory concentrations of ceftazidime, cefepime, imipenem, meropenem, piperacillin-tazobactam, ciprofloxacin, and tobramycin were determined by the broth microdilution method according to the standard of the German DIN.",

Revillo (Zaragoza, E)Objectives: Urinary tract infections in patients with sp\u00ecnal cord injury (SCI) is the most frequent complication due to vesical neurogenic alteration. It is enhanced by the use of permanent urethral catheters with deficient vesical voiding and frequent hospitalization. The objective of this study is the update of ethiology and antimicrobial susceptibility in urinary tract infections in this group of patients. Methods: Over a sixyear-period (1998-2003)  a total of 176 866 urine specimens were cultured. About 8013 corresponded to patients of the SCI unit. Antimicrobial susceptibility was performed by authomatized microdilution and in special strains by disk diffusion method. Results: In the SCI patients 56.5% urine specimens were positive and 43.5% negative or contaminated. Bacterial species most frequent were E. coli (35.0%), P. aeruginosa (12.6%), EEBL) in SCI patients has increased considerably (47 patients in the last three years), being the hospital unit with the highest number. Conclusions: 1. Positive results were considerably higher in SCI patients (56.5%) compared with the rest of patients (21.3%). 2. Percentage of E. coli isolates is lower than in other patients (35.0% vs. 57.2%), due to the increment of urinary infections by nosocomial species. 3. The elevated percentage of P. aeruginosa can be due to the use of urethral catheters. 4. P. stuartii is an important urinary pathogen in SCI patiens, with a degree of isolation 20 fold higher than in the rest of patients and with antimicrobial multiresistence. It is the second species with EEBL, after E. coli. 5. Persistence of EEBL strains in these patients is a reservoir difficult to erradicate. 6. SCI patients present a high degree of colonization by A. baumanii and S. aureus meticillin resistant. 7. Risky sport activities and traffic accidents are increasing the number of SCI patients, affecting mostly young people. Patients cooperation is essential in the prevention of urinary tract infections.

Diagnostic procedure and laboratory evaluation is a challenge. Inflammation markers can be used to evaluate the clinical state and the outcome of the disease.Methods:The study included patients admitted with suspected infection in the Emergency Department. Serological evaluation was performed using Brucella agglutination test (Wright test). A titre of 1:160 or higher was considered significant and titres of 1:40 to 1:80 suspicious despite the endemic characteristics of our area. Blood cultures were obtained independently of STA titres. Clinical manifestations were recorded and evaluated. Any organ involvement was referred as localized disease. Serum Amyloid A (SAA) measurements were performed using nephelometric assays (Dade-Behring) and values higher than 6.0 mg/L were considered indicative of high inflammatory state.Results: SAA was measured in 26 patients with culture-proven brucellosis. 23 patients (88%) had values >6.0 mg/L. Average positive value 232.59 mg/L (SD 299.51 mg/L Confidence interval 95%). Patients with anemia presented with values >294.59 mg/L and patients with osteoarticular involvement >258 mg/L.

Sukiennik (Porto Alegre, BR)Objectives: To evaluate adequacy in activities executed by health care professionals in a 1,200-bed teaching Brazilian hospital. Methods: Study performed during the period of June 2003 to October 2003 designed to evaluate the level of adequacy related to four main procedures: urinary catheter care, intravenous catheter care, and dressings and health care facilities care. Adherence to barrier precautions was also evaluated. This study was composed of two parts. The first part was an observational study. In this phase, performed by the infection control nurses, the observations were registered in a standardized case report form. The second component of the study was an intervention: the results were presented to assistant professionals, who were also trained. After that, new observations were taken. Results: The proportion of non-conformity was 59.0%, 75.6%, 68.4%, and 71.4% for procedures involving urinary catheters, intravenous catheters, catheter dressings and material cleaning, respectively. After training, the global level of adequacy increased to 66.6%. At this moment, trained health care professionals are evaluating the quality of assistance and making new observations, and their work is being audited by infection control nurses. Conclusions: As infection control professionals do not provide direct care to patients, the value of their practice must be demonstrated in other ways, such as stressing quality and economy. These professionals can not be seen as a merely \u00d4data-gatherers\u00d5. Demonstrating value in infection control programmes has become a very important issue; according to this statement, the acquisition of new skills should be one of the priorities.

Tulek (Ankara, TR) Objective: To assess the rate of nosocomial infections, frequency of nosocomial pathogens and antimicrobial susceptibility changes in our hospital in a 5-year period. Methods: Laboratory based nosocomial infection surveillance was performed in 530-bed hospital between 1999 and 2003. Results of the cultures taken from hospitalized patients evaluated daily by bed-side visits. Nosocomial infections were defined according to the CDC definitions for nosocomial infections and nosocomial surgical site infections. Nosocomial infection rate was calculated by number of nosocomial infections per number of hospitalized patients for every year. Antimicrobial susceptibility tests were performed according to NCCLS.Results: Nosocomial infection rates were between 1.4 and 2.4%. High nosocomial infection rates were observed in neurology, neurosurgery, pediatry and dermathology clinics in changing orders. The most common infections were urinary tract infections, surgical site infections and primary bacteraemia in every year of surveillance.The most frequent pathogens were Escherichia coli, Klebsiella pneumoniae, Enterococcus spp, and Staphylococcus aureus. Carbapenems were the most effective antimicrobials against Enterobacteriaceae isolates and more than 609% of E. coli and K. pneumoniae isolates were susceptible to aminoglycosides, quinolones and cephalosporins with some slight decline in years. Methicillin resistance of S. aureus isolates were less than 50% and all S. aureus and Enterococcus spp. isolates were susceptible to glycopeptides except one glycopeptide resistant E. faecium isolate identified in 2003. Chloramphenicol was the second most effective agent after glycopeptides against S. aureus isolates. Conclusion: Nosocomial infection surveillance provides tracing the hospital specific health care for hospitalized patients and supplies data regarding which precautions should be taken. Our low percentage of nosocomial infection rates was due to our method of surveillance. However, following the data by the same method provided both comparisons between years and the changes occurred recently. Nosocomial pathogen isolation and antimicrobial susceptibility tests provided guidance to empirical antimicrobial therapy of nosocomial infections and determining outbreaks.H. Laurichesse, J.-P.

Giedrys-Kalemba (Szczecin, PL)Objectives: To determine the occurrence of ESBL+ Klebsiella pneumoniae and Klebsiella oxytoca isolated from newborns and the genetic relatedness between strains. Material and methods: A total of 28 Klebsiella pneumoniae (K.pn.) and 28 Klebsiella oxytoca (K.ox.) was isolated from various material (blood, urine, swabs from nose, throat, anus) from newborns hospitalized in Intensive Care Unit and Neonatology Unit between April 2003 and March 2004 were tested for detection of ESBL -double disc test. Strains of Klebsiella sp. were submitted to a molecular characterisation by pulsed-field gel electophoresis (PFGE) with using the enzyme Xba I. Results: 50% of K.pn. and 60% of K.ox. strains produced ESBL. For K.pn. three clonal epidemic strains were found: type A included 9 strains (recovered from 7 newborns), type B -6 strains (5 newborns), type C -4 strains (3 newborns), type D -2 strains (2 newborns) and 8 unique unrelated strains. For K.ox. described three types: type A included 21 strains (15 newborns), type B -2 strains (2 newborns), type C -2 strains (2 newborns) and 3 strains unrelated.Type A of K.pn. was isolated between July 2003 and March 2004, type B was isolated between June 2003 and February 2004, type C was recovered from newborns between November 2003 and January 2004, type D was isolated once in August and once in September 2003. Type A of K.ox. was isolated between July 2003 and March 2004, type B was isolated in September 2003 and type C was isolated in July 2003 and in November 2003. All clonal epidemic strains of K.pn. and K.ox. produced ESBL opposite to unrelated strains. Clonal strains were isolated from both Intensive Care Unit and Neonatology Unit. Some of them were responsible for infection and colonization also. Conclusion: Isolation of the same genetic types from different newborns and units during 1 year proves spreading and remaining of the Klebsiella clones in Neonatology Unit. This epidemiological situation should be under full control of hospital infection committee. Tsipoura, G. Nanou, T. Daskalou, M. Pagalou, N. Karampatakis, T. Karampatakis, A.

A novel method for monitoring contamination rates of blood cultures S. Lunding, T. Slotsbjerg, H. Westh (Hvidovre, DK)Objectives: Blood culture (BC) is the criterion standard for identifying patients with bacteraemia. However, elevated falsepositive rates are common and are associated with substantial health care costs. We had monitored numbers of BC without Coagulase-negative Staphylococci (CNS) between blood cultures with CNS in a g-type control chart. Periods with deviation from the protocols for skin disinfection and for specimen's collection were compared with periods without deviations. Methods: Results of blood cultures from tree hospitals had been exported from the laboratory system. The protocols for skin disinfections and for specimen's collection and inoculation are standardized for all hospitals. Periods with deviation from the protocols: Amager Hospital (AH): From June 2000 to November 2001 alcohol swabs in separate packing were replaced with alcohol swabs in an open container, from witch alcohol evaporated. Hvidovre Hospital (HH): From February to September 2004 alcohol swabs were replaced with iodine and gloves were recommended at blood culture sampling. Bispebjerg Hospital (BBH): Needle holders were thermal disinfected between every blood sampling. g-Control chart: The centre line CL illustrate the central tendency of number of BC without CNS between BC with CNS. The upper control limit (UCL) is CL + 3 x standard deviation (the lower control limit is zero). The most important criteria for lack of statistical control are control values outside the UCL, eight consecutive values on the same side of CL and any 12 of 14 consecutive control values on the same side of CL. Results: When alcohol swaps from an open container were used for skin disinfection at AH, CNS were isolated from 9% of BC versus 2.8% of BC when separate packing alcohol swabs were used.

R2063 Microbial flora of the peritoneal catheter exit site in patients on continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis C. Papaefstathiou, A. Karaitianou, P. Metaxaki, M. Zoumberi, D. Vlasopoulos, G. Kouppari (Athens, GR)Objectives: The study of the microbial flora of the peritoneal catheters exit site in continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD) patients and its relation to exit site infection and peritonitis episodes. Patients and methods: During 24 months(2002)(2003) peritoneal catheter exit site cultures were examined independently of the presence exit site infection in 18/28 (64.3%) CAPD patients. The specimens were cultured on the appropriate media. The identification of the microorganisms was performed by standard methods and API systems (bioMerieux). Susceptibility testing was carried out by disc diffusion method. Results: During these 2 years exit site infection was noticed in 11/18 patients (61.1%). No peritoneal catheter tunnel infection was noticed. From the exit site infection episodes Gram (+) microbes were isolated in 57.9% of the strains (CNS in 42.1% and Staphylococcus aureus 15.8%), Gram ()) bacteria in 36.8%, and Candida crusei 5.3%. Resistant colonization by the same strain, was noticed in 45.5% of the patients with exit site infection (colonization time 3-14 months). Production of extended spectrum (-lactamase (ESBL) was observed in 14.3% of isolated Gram ()) bacteria. CNS strains were 100% resistant to oxacillin. 54.5% of the patients were treated by systemic antimicrobials, 18.2% by local antimicrobials and 18.2% by local antiseptic (povidone iodine). In 26 specimens from 11 patients without exit site infection, CNS were isolated in 75% of the strains, Gram ()) bacteria in 17.6% and Candida spp. in 7.1%. CNS strains were 90.4% resistant to oxacillin, 57.1% to erythromycin, 66.7% to gentamicin, 52.4% to ciprofloxacin, 66.7% to trimethoprime/ sulphamethoxazole and 61.1% to fucidic acid. Production of ESBL was observed in 40% of isolated Gram ()) bacteria. Peritonitis episodes from microbes which have been isolated from the exit site (colonization or inflammation) were noticed in 4/18 (22.2%) patients. Conclusions: Multiresistant CNS were isolated from the exit site in the majority of CAPD patients. 50% of the Gram (-) bacteria were unfermented, and 25% were producing ESBL. Cultures from normal exit site are useful for prevention in CAPD patients. Clinical evaluation of exit site appearance is essential for the administration of treatment dependent of isolated microorganisms.R2064Infections in patients with malignancies E. Kouskouni, S.

Extraction and amplification were done using the QIAamp DSP Virus Kit and the LightCycler Instrument, respectively. For the determination of the viral load the HBV LC PCR Kit quantitation standards were calibrated against the 1st International Standard preparation (WHO 97/746). Therefore, the quantification results are defined as international units (IU). Genotype detection studies were done with the HBV Genotype Panel (15 Member, Teragenix). Each genotype was tested in a 0.5 log dilution series 4 times. The correlation of quantification results was determined by analysing 117 clinical samples with the Cobas Amplicor HBV Monitor System (Roche) and the HBV LC PCR Kit in parallel. Results: The detection limit was determined to be 5.8 IU/ml at a detection rate of >95%. The linear range of the assay was determined to cover concentrations from 20 IU/ml to at least 4 x 10 E9 IU/ml. In contrast to other HBV detection systems (e.g. Cobas TaqMan, Roche) the HBV LC PCR Kit was able to detect all members of the HBV Genotype Panel with a sensitivity below 100 IU/ml. The diagnostic sensitivity and specificity were determined to be >99%. The quantitative correlation (1.0 log range) with the Cobas Amplicor HBV Monitor system was determined to be 95.91%.Conclusion: It has been shown, that the HBV LC PCR Kit developed and established by artus GmbH performs in respect of sensitivity, specificity, quantification, reliability and turnaround time (about 3 hours) at least as good or better than all other currently available HBV detection and quantification assay.In addition the HBV LC PCR Kit is the first HBV detection and quantitation assay designed to work on open systems, demonstrating the usability of research grade sample preparation systems and real-time PCR instruments for clinical in vitro diagnostics.

The causative agent cannot be shown by routine methods of staining and culturing of cerebrospinal fluid in viral meningitis, lymphositic pleocytosis with increase in protein levels and decrease in glucose levels may be seen. Mumps virus, enteroviruses, HSV are frequent causes of viral meningitis, while parainfluenzae virus is a rare cause. Methods and results: In this study, a 26 year-old male patient who applied with fever, headache, and disuri, and had lymphositic pleocytosis, increase in protein, and decrease in glucose levels of his cerebrospinal fluid, and who was diagnosed by determining specific antibodies against parainfluenzae virus type B as viral meningitis, is reported. He had symptoms like globe vesicale, hypertension resistant to therapy, tachycardia, hyperthermy, and dry skin which showed involvement of the autonomic nerve system. Autonomic nerve system pathologies like acute pandisautonomic neuropathy can be seen following infections like rubella, infectious mononucleosis. In order to show autonom neuropathy MUAP (Motor Unit Analysing Potential) test was performed. Cardiac autonom nerve involvement was shown by determination of loss of changeability in P-R interval by breathing. Conclusion: The patient recovered spontaneously and was discharged from the hospital after 40 days.C. Larcher, H.P. Huemer (Innsbruck, A)Human Metapneumovirus (HMPV) is a newly discovered Paramyxovirus which causes respiratory infections. In this study we tested 266 respiratory samples from the local paediatrics department and from adult transplant patients for active replication of HMPV by a combined cell culture/PCR method. Most of the HMPV cases clustered within 2 major outbreaks in October/November and March, whereas only few isolations were obtained from December to the end of February, in most cases from immunosuppressed patients. Sequencing analysis of the isolated viruses revealed that a single strain predominated the 2 outbreaks whereas a clearly different genotype was detected in the \u00d4interepidemic\u00d5 period. As the same strains were detected in small children (< 2a) and immunosuppressed adults, active transmission within the population can be assumed. Prolonged HMPV shedding was observed in some patients after lung transplantation, although also these patients despite immunosuppression seemed to be able to clear the virus after some months.R2185 Cytomegalovirus infection and biliary atresia in a newborn infantK.

Methods: 547 stool specimens of patients with acute gastroenteritis were examined for viruses by direct electron microscopy using negative staining method and by qualitative direct EIA for the detection of rotaviruses group A, adenoviruses and astroviruses.Results: Data were analysed monthly from July 2002 till June 2003 (included). During the Summer-Autumn time (July-September 2002) the major viral causative agent of gastroenteritis was the diverse group of caliciviruses. The peak of calicivirus infection we observed in August (68.4%). In October, the rotavirus infection reached the same percentage as infection caused by calicivirus (40%). In the next months, especially in the Winter-Spring time, the rotavirus infection was the most common and the peak of infection was in March (82.6%). In this study the rotavirus infection was observed in a 52.3%, calicivirus in 28.1%, adenovirus in 14%, astrovirus in 13% and coronavirus infection in 10% of positive samples. Conclusion: In Bosnia and Herzegovina, analysis of seasonal distribution of gastroenteritis viruses for 2002/03 has shown to be important for rotavirus and calicivirus infections. In Summer-Autumn period the calicivirus infection was the major causative agent of virus gastroenteritis while in Winter-Spring time it was rotavirus infection.

Domingo  (Barcelona, E)    Background: The incidence and prevalence of different microorganisms and infection sites in HIV-infected patients remains controversial. The aim of this study was to evaluate the global presence of infectious diseases during the HAART era. Methods: We retrospectively studied all HIV-AIDS records from 1996 to 2003 at a teaching-urban hospital in Barcelona (Spain). All microbiological positive cultures and infection sites were reviewed from 1996 to 2003. Contamination was ruled out based on clinical grounds. Statistical analysis was performed with standardized methods. Results: We analysed 1502 HIV infected patients. A total of 623 (41%) patients showed one or more infections, with 1681 positive microbiological cultures (371 patients had more than one infection). 429 (68.8%) were men. Mean age was 40 + 9 (range: 18-79). 89% of patients were on highly active antiretroviral therapy. The most frequent isolates were: E. coli 159 (9.5%), M. tuberculosis 132 (7.9%), S. aureus 106 (6.1%), Herpes simplex 84 (5.0%), S. pneumoniae 74 (4.4%), Campylobacter sp 72 (4.3%), Pneumocystis carinii 68 (4.0%), Pseudomonas aeruginosa 59 (3.5%), S. epidermidis 56 (3.3%), Salmonella sp 50 (3.0%). The most frequent clinical syndromes were: Bacteremia 262 (15.5%) cases (S. epidermidis 16%, E.

Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis during highly active anti-retroviral therapy in an HIV-infected patient. Case reportE. Boumis, P. Chinello, C. Della Rocca, M.G. Paglia, M.F. Proietti, N. Petrosillo (Rome, I)Introduction: Post-kala-azar dermal leishmaniasis (PKDL) is a complication of visceral leishmaniasis (VL) and manifests as multiple hypocromic macules, erythematous papules or nodules arising in the skin during or most often after treatment of VL. PKDL is very uncommon in HIV-positive patients and just few cases have so far been documented. We describe the occurrence of PKDL in an HIV-infected patient unresponsive to liposomal amphotericin B and successfully treated with N-metilglucamine antimoniate (Glucantim \u00d2 ). report: An HIV infected patient in HAART with ddI-d4T-Lop/Rit in June 2003 started complaining of asthenia and failure to gain weight. The blood tests showed: CD4 50/mm3, undetectable HIV-RNA, PMN 680/mm 3 , Hb 9.4 g/dL and PLT 161,000/mm 3 . The search for opportunistic infection was negative, but a serologic test (IFI) for Leishmania spp. was positive at a titre of 1:2560 and a PCR on peripheral blood was positive for Leishmania infantum. The patient refused bone marrow aspiration. A presumptive diagnosis of VL was made. Liposomal amphotericin B at a 3 mg/kg dose was administered daily for 12 days and weekly later on, with initial benefit.One month later, a maculopapular, nonpruritic, pink rash on the trunk appeared. The rash gradually worsened over time and in October 2003 a skin biopsy was performed. A granulomatous infiltrate was seen, with histiocytosis, PMNs, plasmacells, and amastygotes. The PCR performed on the skin sections was positive for Leishmania infantum. A diagnosis of PKDL was made. The patient continued to receive liposomal amphotericin B 3 mg/kg once a week. Because of the rash worsening, in January 2004 a new course of liposomal amphotericin B at a 5 mg/kg qd dose for 10 days was tried, unsuccessfully. In April a course of Glucantim \u00d2 was started, at the dose of 100 mg/kg i.m. qd. After a transient increase in amylase and lipase plasma levels, the dose was adjusted to 75 mg/kg daily and was administered for4 weeks. The treatment was well tolerated. At stop therapy the skin lesions were flattened and began to turn pale. The patient is still in good conditions after a 6 months follow-up. Conclusions: Although very uncommon, PKDL must be considered in HIV-positive patients treated for VL and presenting a skin rash, especially during HAART. Even liposomal amphotericin B, which is considered the most effective anti-Leishmania drug, can sometimes need to be substituted by antimonials for PKDL treatment.",

Viard (Paris, Besan\u00e7on, Toulon, F)Objective: Increased survival among patients with AIDS has led to a recent increase of neoplasms. Cholangiocarcinoma (CC) is a rare form of malignancy arising from the bile duct epithelium, that may be associated with history of chronic inflammation of the biliary tract. We describe here the first series of five patients with AIDS-associated CC. Methods: Retrospective multicentric study among all 54 Departments of Infectious Diseases of French University Hospitals. Results: All patients were men of Caucasian origin. At CC diagnosis, median age was 48 yrs (range 38-61 yrs), median known duration of HIV infection was 13 years (range 0-17). Four patients were at CDC stage C of infection, with a median time between AIDS and CC diagnoses of 13 years (0-17). Three patients were treated by HAART with a median duration of 1 year (range 0-8 years). Median CD4+ lymphocyte count was 170/mm 3 (range 1-600/mm 3 ) and median viral load was 32,000 copies RNA/ml (range <50-47, 700). All five patients were lacking the most important risk factors for CC (sclerosing cholangitis and liver fluke infection), but three had an history of AIDS-related cholangitis (including one related to cytomegalovirus). Median survival was 7.5 months (range 2 month-9 yrs). Only one patient could have complete tumour resection with prolonged survival (9 years). Conclusions: 1. Patients with AIDS may develop CC, especially those with long lasting infection and previous AIDS-related cholangitis; 2. Patients with history of AIDS-related cholangitis should therefore be closely monitored, since early diagnosis is key for surgical excision which is associated with increased survival.R. Iubu, C. Jianu, D. Tatulescu (Cluj-Napoca, RO)Background: Invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) is the most common manifestation of aspergillus infection in HIV patients, associated with an extremely high mortality rate. Aim: To present IPA in a HIV infected patient recovered by immune reconstitution under antiretroviral therapy, without appropriate antifungal drugs. Case report: A 15-years teen-ager, male, was admitted in our hospital for a 2 months history of weight loss, weakness, anorexia, fever, persistent cough and thoracic pains and related more previous episodes of pneumonia, diarrhoea and allergy. He had fever, height and weight deficit, labial herpes, white plaque tongue, tachycardia, normal pulmonary sounds, inflammatory syndrome (ESR = 85-110/h, fibrinogen = 560 mg%, CRP = 6.5 mg/dL), high values of Ig G (2200 mg/dL), leuco-cytes and lymphocytes count decreased (3800/mm 3 , respectively 570/mm 3 ). Chest radiograph showed an inhomogeneous opacity with a poorly defined nodular appearance, about 4-5 cm diameter in left upper pulmonary lobe, extended to hila by multiple micro nodules, 5-10 mm, and high-resolution chest computed topography indicated a 4.5/5.2 cm parenchyma nodule with a surrounding halo of ground glass, suggesting an IPA. High levels of the Aspergillus antigen galactomannan detected by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) in two consecutive serum samples confirmed the diagnosis. ELISA and Western Blot tests for HIV were positive, CD4 count 140 cells/mm 3 , HIV-RNA levels 68,000 copies/mL and he was diagnosed as nosocomial-transmitted HIV infection, CDC stage C3. HAART was started with lamivudine + efavirenz + indinavir with a very good adherence to the treatment. He did not receive any antifungal therapy because he presented intolerance to Amphotericin B and no another antimycotic drugs were available at that moment. After 3 months of HAART, reevaluation showed weight growth, inflammatory syndrome absented, WBC count 6500/mm 3 , lymphocytes count 1855/mm 3 (27%), CD4 count increased 612/mm 3 , viral load <400 copies/ mL, radiographic and CT abnormalities resolution; 2 months later radiological manifestations absolutely disappeared and Aspergillus antigen galactomannan levels was undetectable. The patient remained stable for 5 years with the same HAART regimen. Conclusions: We obtained IPA recovery by immune reconstitution after 5 months of HAART, even in absence of any antifungal treatment. HAART starting may improve the clinical outcome in HIV-infected patients with IPA.R2197 Prediction of potential antigenic domains of HIV-1 Pol protein and evaluation their immunoreactivity V. Puzyrev, N. Savel'eva, E. Baranova, O. Van'kova, V. Pimenov, A. Obriadina, A. Burkov, T. Ulanova (Nizhniy Novgorod, RUS)Objectives: The aim of this study is prediction and evaluation diagnostic relevance of potential antigenic epitopes of HIV-1 polymerase protein (protease; reverse transcriptase; integrase). Methods: Five potential antigenic epitopes of HIV-1 pol protein have been predicted by bioinformatics analysis. Recombinant genes encoded selected amino acids sequences have been assembled by PCR from synthetic oligonucleotides and expressed in E. coli as hybrid proteins with Glutathione S-transferase. Proteins were tested by enzyme immunoassay against a panel of human serum specimens positive for anti HIV (n = 228) and specimens from normal blood donors (n = 200). Status of samples has been confirmed by \u00d4New Lav Blot\u00d5 (Bio-Rad, USA). Results: Potential antigenic determinants were predicted at position 1-51 aa, 198-347 aa, 242-347aa, 352-411 aa and 922-1002 aa pol protein. Only protein comprising 922-1002 aa of pol protein (integrase) was immunoreactive and detected IgG antibody in 87% anti-HIV positive serum samples. Average of signal to cutoff ratio is 8.5. None of specimens from normal blood donors were tested as positive with this recombinant protein. Other theoretically selected amino acids sequences demonstrated no immunoreactivity. This may be connected with the conformational nature of other predicted epitopes. Conclusion: The results indicated that recombinant protein comprising one of the theoretically predicted antigenic epitope(s) of HIV-1 pol protein demonstrated a significant diagnostic potential and can be used for the development EIA for the detection of anti-HIV activity in serum specimens.",

R2202 AIDS, a risk disaster for the African Great Lakes region J.L. Mangala Miherule (Nairobi, KEN)Africa bears the heaviest burden of HIV/AIDS. According to the UNAIDS (2003), more than 28 millions are contaminated. The prevailing remains stable.African states already faced with many developmental difficulties must by all means avoid the total explosion of this bomb ( HIV/ AIDS).Southern African still has this disaster. The African Great lakes region constitutes countries such UGANDA, Tanzania, Kenya, Burundi, Rwanda, Zambia and DRC. These Countries are noticing new infections following a massive displacement of (refugees) population due to ethnic conflicts, political, economic and social crisis (lands, poverty, identity and other problems).According to research conducted by UMHE/GREAT LAKES, ANDA-ONLUS for Central And Eastern Africa, out or 12,000 young students (boys/girls) of the sub-regions, +20% of girls agreed to have succumbed to sexual violence from soldiers from one or another regime.+80% have no idea on voluntaring testing and antiretroviral , +70% are engaged in unprotected sexual relations +75% fear being pregnant than HIV/AIDS . +2% accepted tocontribute towards funds for solidarity for students and young HIV/AIDS victims.No one ignores that the Great Lakes region is led by Armies, Warlords, troops that 40% are infected by HIV/ AIDS.+50% Of other young girls did not want to testify in sexual violence from the men in uniform fearing stigmatization and reject.+60% of young would like to know their status but there is lack of appropriate structures.A study conducted in the East of DRC ( North-South Kivu and Maniema), for about 10,000,000 habitants, there exist six structures of voluntary testing but with a weak capacity of less than 500 volunteers per year.In south -Kivu for example, there is only one existing structure taking care of patients of HIV/AIDS with a capacity of 20 Patients per year out of a population of +4,500,000 habitants.Rape is part of principal causes of HIV/ AIDS expansion in the sub-region.

Karabassi, M. Pouyiouka, C. Milonas, C. Petrochilou, N. Alexandropoulos, C. Kontou-Castellanou (Athens, GR)Objectives: Our study was conducted to control hospitalized patients for chronic hepatitis infection B and C and to estimate the clinical significance of C-reactive protein (CRP) serum levels, the relationship between CRP and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) concentrations in serum and the correlation of CRP with the hepatic inflammation and damage in these patients. Methods: During a ten month interval 100 hospitalized patients were found with chronic viral hepatitis. There were two groups of patients, Group A: 70 patients with chronic hepatitis B and Group B: 30 patients with chronic hepatitis C. Serum samples from them were examined for the determination of CRP and ALT levels. The detection of surface antigen HBsAg and HCVantibodies was performed by MEIA methodology (AXSYM-ABBOTT) and the diagnosis proved by liver's biopsy. The CRP values were determined using the nephelometric method (Dade-Behring) taking as normal values 0-5 mg/lt and ALT values were determined by IFCC method (Technicon RA 1000 Medicon) taking as normal values 5-40 U/L. Results: In Group A of the 70 patients, 24 (34.3%) had pathological CRP levels that ranged from 15 to 174 mg/lt, 23(32.8%) had high ALT levels that ranged from 58 to 6110 U/L and in 18 of them (79.7%) were found high CRP concentrations fluctuated simultaneously with ALT serum levels and ranged from 35 to 174 mg/lt.In Group B of the 30 patients, 6 (20%) had high CRP levels that ranged from 13 to 83 mg/lt, 7 (23.3%) had high ALT levels that ranged from 56 to 89 U/L and in all of them (7/7) the CRP concentrations were normal. Conclusion: This study showed a significant association between elevated CRP and ALT serum levels in chronic hepatitis B. In contrast no correlation was observed in chronic hepatitis C. In conclusion the combination of CRP and ALT values could be a useful marker for the progression of the disease in chronic hepatitis B but not in chronic hepatits C.

Bambacioni, S. Meschi, F. Bellomi, R. Burioni, M. Clementi, E. Spada, E. Piccolella, F. Dianzani, G. Antonelli (Rome, Pisa, Milan, I)Hepatitis C virus infection is widespread and considered the main cause of chronic hepatitis in Western countries. Many studies conducted in the last decade have shown that the outcome of HCV infection is determined by the interaction between the virus and the host immune system. Recent acquisitions suggest that in persistent HCV infection the immune response may contribute to hepatocellular injury. To this regard HCV-directed antibodies (Ab) might be involved in the development of immunocomplexes (IC), that may favour the infection of usually not susceptible cells, and of immunocorrelated diseases. The present study is aimed at evaluating the development of IC and, eventually, their relevance in HCVinfection clinical outcome. Methods: The presence of IC was evaluated in 44 chronic and in 6 acute na\u00efve HCV-infected patients with different genotypes. To verify the presence of IC, patient's plasma samples were sequentially absorbed on protein A coated beads and then analysed to quantify the number of HCV-RNA copies absorbed (or not) to the beads. HCV-RNA was monitored using the Amplicor HCV Monitor kit, while HCV genotype was obtained by INNO-LIPA HCV II assay. The study of the Ab was carried out by INNO-LIA HCV Ab III and the reactivity for E2 protein was also monitored by in house-made ELISA. Results and conclusions: The results suggest that in chronic HCV patients most of the HCV-RNA (ranging from 80 to 99.9%) is bound to Ab in IC with a higher percentage in patients infected with 1b genotype. No correlation between \u00d4baseline\u00d5 plasma viral load and IC development was observed suggesting that the frequency of IC does not depend on plasma viraemia levels. The analysis of antibodies revealed that the IC do not contain anti-E2 Ab, even if these antibodies can be detected in the plasma of all subjects. In contrast newly HCV-infected patients developed no or low amount of IC that, interestingly, increases within time (0, 1, 3 and 5 months of follow-up) only in patients who developed chronic infection. Again this phenomenon does not seem to be related to the presence on anti-E2 antibody. These data suggest that the presence of IC is a peculiarity of HCV chronic infection; the pathogenetic relevance of such a phenomenon is now under study.K.Mandraveli-Hatzikosta, M. Pape-Chrisafi, D. Papadopoulou,  M. Giannousis, S.

Methods: A group of 100 patients from Northern Greece (70 men, 30 women, mean age 45.5 \u00b1 10.0 year) with chronic hepatitis B was tested. All patients were treated with lamivudine for more than six months. The mean duration of the antiretroviral therapy was 15 (\u00b12.3) months. Serum HBV-DNA levels (viral load) were measured with quantitive PCR (COBAS TaqMan HBV Test), genotypes and polymerase gene mutations were determined using the reverse hybridization in a line probe assay (INNO-LiPA HBV genotyping, INNO-LiPA HBV DR kits, respectively).

Vranckx (Brussels, B)Objectives: Several studies have demonstrated that pathogenic and therapeutic differences exist among hepatitis B virus (HBV) genotypes. It appeared sensible, therefore, to establish the prevalence of the different HBV genotypes in Belgian patients with chronic hepatitis B. Methods: The study population consisted of two groups of patients: Flemish blood donors and patients whose sera were collected at the gastro-enterology units of three university hospitals in Antwerp, Brussels and Ghent. HBV genotyping was carried out with the Inno-Lipa HBV Genotyping assay (Innogenetics NV, Belgium) on 128 samples where chronic hepatitis B infection and HBV DNA were detected.Results: Of the 93 serum samples from blood donors 49 (53%) samples were infected with genotype A and 34 (37%) samples were infected with genotype D. Mixed genotypes A and D were found in 7 (8%) samples. In the group of patients from the gastroenterology units, 19 (54%) of the 35 were infected with genotype A and 11 (31%) patients had genotype D. Here also, mixed genotypes A and D were found, specifically in 3 (9%) samples. In total, only 2 samples could not be genotyped by the Inno-Lipa assay, despite the detection of HBV-DNA. No significant difference was observed with respect to the distribution of the genotypes A, D and A/D between the 2 groups of patients.Conclusion:The results indicate that genotypes A and D are the predominant genotypes in Belgian patients with chronic hepatitis B infection.",

            "text": "Background: The aim of this study was to determine and evaluate pattern changes over the last 9 years regarding the presence of infectious diseases in HIV infected patients during the HAART era. Methods: We retrospectively analysed all infectious episodes in all HIV infected patients from 1996 to 2003. Infectious disease was defined as isolation of a pathogenic bacteria together with consistent clinical findings. No serological data were assessed. We analysed the temporal trend of the most prevalent infections, in search of significant differences to compare their annual prevalence using contingency tables mediating Chi-square analysis Results: 1677 infectious samples in 628 patients were analysed during this period. Significant results are shown in the following Results: 920 patients (p) were evaluated for pancreatic abnormalities in a case-control study including the entire follow-up period of each considered p;128 p with high and prolonged laboratory anomalies were assessed to outline the profile of pancreatic disease before and during the HAART era. Compared with controls, the 334 p (36.3%) who experienced >1 episode of confirmed pancreatic laboratory abnormality had a longer duration of seropositivity, exposure to protease inhibitors, a more frequent immunodeficiency, AIDS diagnosis, liverbiliary disease, and hypertriglyceridemia, while no relation was found with antiretroviral use, and the duration of nucleoside analogue use. Among these 334 p, high and prolonged laboratory alterations eventually associated with signs of organ involvement occurred in 128 p, and were related to the administration of ddI, d4T, 3TC, pentamidine, cotrimoxazole, or antitubercular therapy, substance or alcohol abuse, opportunistic infections, liver-biliary disease, a protease inhibitor-based HAART, and hypertriglyceridemia. However, no difference was noticed between the 32 p with clinical and/or imaging evidence of pancreatic involvement and the remaining 96 asymptomatic p, as to the same risk factors. Although recurrences of enzyme alterations involved >70% of p, in only 33.8% of cases a change of antiretroviral or antimicrobial therapy became needed. An acute but uncomplicated pancreatitis occurred in 7 p of 26 overall symptomatic ones. A 2-4-week gabexate and/or octreotide administration (performed in 59 p of 128), achieved a significant laboratory, clinical, and imaging cure or improvement in 71.2% of p, with a better success rate of combined vs single therapy; a reduced tendency to disease recurrences, and an ameliorated tolerability of antiretrovirals, were also noticed. Conclusion: Epidemiological and pathogenetic studies are needed to assess pancreatic abnormalities especially in the HAART In the case of BDLD transplantation a statistically significative (p = 0.012) increase in the colonization after transplantation was found due to BDLDs (from 25.8% to 61.2%) in contrast with NHBLD transplantation in which NHBLD did not increase the proportion of significant cultures (62.5% in both cases).Conclusions: According to our series NHBLD are statistically less colonized than BDLD. A difference in the proportion of colonization in out hospital NHBLD in the era of prophylactic antibiotherapy could be adventageous in terms of decreasing infections after transplantation, using less prophylactic antibiotics, and avoiding the appearance of antibiotic resistant microorganisms. Objectives: Post-transplant lymphoproliferative diseases (PTLD) is a well recognized complication after HSCT. However, it has been difficult to characterize because the incidence is <1% and clinical presentation is diverse. Incidence and characterisitcs of PTLD after HSCT have not been reported in Korea. This study is aimed to evlauate and characterize PTLD after HSCT in a single institution.",

Results: There were 7 patients who had PTLD for 10 years. The mean age was 33 \u00b1 11.6 years, male to female ratio was 6-1. The underlying hematologic diseases were 3 chronic myeloid leukaemia, 2 acute myelocytic leukaemia, 1 myelodysplasic syndrome, 1 severe aplastic anemia. The types of HSCT were 4 of matched sibling donor (MSD) HSCT, 2 of matched unrelated donor (MUD) HSCT, and 1 of haploidenticl HSCT. Five of these patients (71.4%) experienced episodes of acute GVHD and received steroid therapy. PTLD developed at mean 145.3 days (range, 83 244) after HSCT. Clinical symptoms were diverse depending on the involved sites, but cervical lymphadenopathy was frequently observed (5 out of 7). Theincidence of PTLD has been increasing: no proven cases before 1996, 1 case in 1996, 3 in 2001, 1 in 2002, 2 in 2003 . The pathology review showed that 6 cases had B-cell origin PTLD and one patient had T-cell origin, who had haploidentical HSCT and rapidly progressed to death. In situ hybridization for EBER was positve in 4 cases. Treatments of PTLD were 1 acyclovir therapy, 2 reduction of immunosuppressants plus acyclovir therapy, 2 reduction of immunosuppressants plus donor lymphocyte infusion (DLI), 2 reduction of immunosuppressants plus acyclovir therapy plus DLI. Five of seven patients (71.4%) reponded to the treatment. Three patients died, and 2 of them died patially or directly due to PTLD, which developed in 2003 in these cases. Conclusion: The incidence of PTLD is low in allogeneic HSCT patients, but has been increasing recently probably because the rate of HLA mismatched HSCT or MUD HSCT, which needs more profound immunosuppression, has increased. Therefore, we should be careful of development of PTLD in patients after HSCT, who have risks of PTLD.",
