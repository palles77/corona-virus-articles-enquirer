In this communication, we report that a single intracerebral administration of the naturally occurring neuropeptide, fl-endorphin, reduced the incidence of JHMV-induced paralytic-demyelinating disease 40-50% in C57B1/6 mice. Protection from disease was accompanied by significantly reduced virus replication in the brain as early as 3 days post-infection and did not occur in irradiated, or immunoincompetent mice. The data suggest that fl-endorphin engages immune mechanisms of host resistance to JHMV infection to protect the mice from disease.",

One of the JHMV mutant viruses that has been studied in detail is the neutralization-resistant strain, 2.2-V-1, which was selected using a monoclonal antibody specific for the spike (S) glycoprotein of JHMV (Fleming et al., 1986 (Fleming et al., , 1987 . The clinical and histopathological course of 2.2-V-1 infection during the first 2 weeks following i.c. inoculation has been extensively characterized in our laboratory (Wang et al., 1992) . Briefly, virus grows rapidly and is first detected on day 2 or 3 p.i., reaching a peak between clays 3 and 5. A significant drop in infectious virus titers occurs on day 7, continuing to decline to undetectable levels by day 10-12 p.i. The clinical signs of 2.2-V-1 infection are first apparent between days 6-8 and consist of mild hindlimb paralysis which usually becomes more severe until days 12-14, when the disease either stabilizes or recovery begins. Demyelinating lesions are detected in the brain and spinal cord no earlier than day 6, while a characteristic infiltration of mononuclear cells first occurs on days 3 or 4 and peaks between days 6-9. The timing of the mononuclear cell infiltration with the drop in virus titers on day 7 p.i. suggests that virus is cleared from the CNS by an immune-mediated mechanism. In fact, a critical role for the immune response in virus clearance and protection from death has been demonstrated in previous studies using several additional JHMV strains Sussman et al., 1989; Williamson and Stohlman, 1990) . However, in 2.2-V-1 infection, there is evidence that subsequent demyelination is due to immune or T cell activity in the CNS Wang et al., 1990) . A similar dual role for the immune response has been reported for CNS disease induced by JHMV in the rat (Wege et al., 1990; Zimprich et al., 1991) and Theiler's murine encephalomyelitis virus (TMEV) in mice (Lipton, 1975) . In all of these models the immune response appears to play an initially protective role in the acute stage of infection, but becomes destructive in the later or chronic stages.",

The original rationale for these studies was based on the findings that/3-endorphin enhances mitogen-and antigen-stimulated murine T cell activities in vitro (Gilman et al., 1982; Weiner, 1988, 1989) and by reports that /3-endorphin dramatically increases the severity of CNS disease in Swiss outbred and BALB/c mice infected with a temperature-sensitive mutant of vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV; Doll and Johnson, 1985) in a manner dependent on an intact immune response (Doll and Johnson, 1989; Hummer et al., 1990; Coons et al., 1991) . The dual role that the immune response plays in 2.2-V-l-induced CNS disease suggested that /3-endorphin administration would either protect mice from or exacerbate the disease. In fact, our studies show that a single i.c. injection of/3-endorphin at the time of infection protects C57B1/6 mice from both clinical and histopathological disease, accompanied by significantly reduced titers of infectious virus in the brains of treated mice as early as day 3 p.i. Additional data suggest that the protection is due to /3-endorphin-facilitated control of early virus replication that requires an intact host immune response.",

The large plaque morphology variant of JHMV known as JHMV-DL (Stohlman et al., 1982) was also grown on DBT monolayers, but in the absence of antibody. Virus activity was measured by plaque assay on DBT cells as previously described (Stohlman and Weiner, 1981) . Isolation of virus from the CNS of infected mice was accomplished as reported (Fleming et al., 1986) . Briefly, brains were removed from mice killed by anesthetic overdose, homogenized using Tenbroeck homogenizers and subjected to low-speed centrifugation to remove cell debris and nuclei. Supernatants were immediately applied to DBT monolayers for plaque assay.",

Virus infection was confirmed in all mice, including those treated with fl-endorphin, by the presence of JHMV-specific antibodies in serum prepared from blood obtained at sacrifice and measured by ELISA (data not shown). The protective effect of fl-endorphin and its relatively protease-resistant analog, D-AlaZ-fl-endorphin, is more dramatically reflected in the clinical scores assigned in blinded fashion to infected mice and illustrated in Table 2 . For example, the paralysis score given to untreated, infected mice was 3.0 on day 13 p.i. (Table 2 , Group 1-1), compared with a score of 0.7 in the/3-endorphin treatment groups (Groups 1-2, 1-3; P < 0.05).

Thus, 9/12 mice had no disease, or a clinical score of 0, indicating that the remaining symptomatic mice were partially protected. In addition, the data suggest that the course of disease is shortened in the/3-endorphin-treated mice, reaching an early peak on day 8 or 9 p.i., followed by almost complete recovery by day 13 p.i. Untreated mice show an increase in paralysis severity until days 12-14 p.i., with variable recovery over the next 2 or 3 months (Fleming et al., 1986) .

As illustrated in Fig. 2 , virus growth was significantly reduced in the brains of /3-endorphin-treated mice as early as day 3 p.i., and remained reduced throughout the period tested. The differences between treated and untreated mice were statistically significant on days 3 and 5 p.i. (P < 0.05).

The variability in individual values obtained at day 9 p.i., when virus growth is declining in untreated mice ( Fig. 2 ; Fleming et al., 1986) resulted in a lack of statistically significant differences between the two groups.

This was tested in vitro by plaque assay in which various dilutions of virus were added to DBT cells in 24-well plates in the presence or absence of a high concentration of /3-endorphin (10 /~g/well). In addition to 2.2-V-1, the large plaque morphology variant, JHMV-DL, was also tested for neutralization by peptide. Plaques were counted at 24 h p.i. and the results are presented in Table 4 . The data show that a concentration of fl-endorphin 10-fold higher than that capable of protecting mice from disease does not prevent infection in vitro. In addition, /3-endorphin had no effect on the growth of either the encephalitogenic strain JHMV-DL or the less virulent, paralysis-inducing 2.2-V-1. These data suggest that it is unlikely that fl-endorphin directly affects the ability of JHMV to infect or grow in cells derived from the CNS, and suggests that it facilitates protection indirectly by an effect on host resistance to virus infection.",

To test this possi- bility, mice were rendered immuno-incompetent by whole-body gamma irradiation 24 h prior to JHMV infection and/3-endorphin treatment. Table 5 presents data which show that /3-endorphin was not able to protect mice from CNS disease if the immune system was impaired. It is again evident that /3-endorphin does not directly interfere with virus infection or replication, since irradiated mice succumbed to encephalitis in spite of/3-endorphin treatment. These data provide evidence that the immune system may be required for the protective effect of/3-endorphin.",

The protection was observed as reduced overall disease incidence or markedly reduced disease severity (partial protection), reflected in clinical and histological evaluations. Preliminary data suggest that an opioid receptor is involved, since substitution of opioid-inactive, N-acetylated /3-endorphin did not protect mice from disease ( Table 3 ). The administration of fl-endorphin was associated with significantly diminished virus growth in the brains of infected mice as early as day 3 p.i. Brain virus titers remained at the lower limits of detection until day 9 p.i., when virus growth is decreasing in untreated mice.

Such a discrepancy may be explained by obvious differences in the types of CNS disease the two viruses cause in different strains of mice, the timing of the pathogenic events initiated by each virus or by differences in the role that the host response plays in their pathogenicity. Thus, the temperature-sensitive strain of VSV, designated ts G31-KS5 VSV, produces either no clinical symptoms in normal BALB/c mice, or a slowly progressive CNS disease characterized by wasting, loss of appetite, hindlimb paralysis and death in BALB/c nude mice within 30 days of inoculation. In addition, the temperature sensitivity of ts G31-KS5 VSV renders it more capable of replication following decreases in core body temperature, which occur following i.c. injection of /3-endorphin (Nemeroff et al., 1979) . By contrast, the JHMV variant 2.2-V-1 causes paralytic-demyelinating disease in 70-80% of infected BALB/c and C57BL/6 mice by day 8 p.i., and has not shown temperature sensitivity when tested for growth at 33 and 39\u00b0C (unpublished observations).",

The immune response also appears to be critical for survival following ts G31-KS5 VSV infection, since BALB/c nude mice eventually succumb to progressive CNS disease. Although it is not clear whether the immune response contributes to VSV pathogenesis, its requirement for the /3-endorphin exacerbation effect suggests that it it may. If so, differences in the fl-endorphin influences in the two models may reflect the timing of specific pathogenic events. Interestingly, it was necessary for /3-endorphin to be administered 24 h prior VSV infection for the more aggressive disease to appear.",

The preliminary testing of the opioid specificity of the protection in this communication suggests the involvement of an opioid receptor, since N-acetylated fl-endorphin was not effective. However, additional experiments using opioid antagonists such as naloxone or naltrexone will be necessary to confirm this result. It was also observed that protection was essentially equally afforded by /3-endorphin and its more protease resistant analog, D-Ala2-fl-endorphin. This suggests that/3-endorphin is relatively efficient in initiating events ultimately lead to reduced virus growth in the CNS and protection from paralytic-demyelinating disease. An additional pharmacological parameter that is currently in an early stage of investigation is the dose requirement for the protective effect. It is clear that protection is accomplished at concentrations of /3-endorphin in the nanomolar, or high physiological range, though we have not consistently observed protection at doses of 0.001/zg/mouse or lower, nor have 87 we observed increased disease severity at high or low doses. The exacerbation of VSV-induced CNS disease has been reported to occur at /3-endorphin concentrations as low as 14 pM (Hummer et al., 1990) .",

There are at least three possible mechanisms by which virus replication may be reduced in the CNS by day 3 p.i.: (i) neutralization of virus by a nonspecific peptide-virus interaction; (ii) activation of intrinsic cellular mechanisms of resistance; and (iii) initiation of a nonspecific immune response capable of clearing virus from the CNS. Since /3-endorphin is a basic peptide, it is possible that it binds nonspecifically to virus, effectively neutralizing it and preventing infection. It seems unlikely that this occurs, since /3-endorphin had no effect on in vitro virus yield even when added at concentrations ten times higher than the highest dose tested in vivo (Table  4 ). In addition, fl-endorphin was not able to protect mice from death due to infection with the encephalitogenic virus strain, JHMV-DL (unpublished data). If /3-endorphin engages intrinsic cellular mechanisms of resistance to protect mice from JHMV-induced disease, one might also predict that JHMV growth would be diminished in vitro. The fact that this did not occur argues against the involvement of intrinsic resistance as a mechanism of /3-endorphin-induced protection. However, further study is needed to characterize JHMV growth in the presence of/3-endorphin both in vitro and in vivo to identify a possible effect on the number of virus particles yielded per cell, the number of cells infected and/or the regional and cellular distribution of virus in the infected tissue. Experiments of this nature are currently planned.",

Since the CNS was not shielded during irradiation in these experiments, it is possible that the abrogation of protection involves a radiosensitive cell in the CNS, or perhaps a disturbance in the blood-brain barrier. However, Wang et al. (1990) applied shielding differentially to the CNS and the periphery in order to establish the involvement of the immune response in lesion formation following 2.2-V-1 infection. Their data indicate that shielding either CNS or systemic compartments prior to day 3 p.i. had no effect on disease outcome. Although it thus seems unlikely that the irradiated CNS is involved in eliminating fl-endorphin protection, it will be necessary to repeat the experiments with the CNS shielded during irradiation.",

Thus, /3-endorphin enhances and inhibits T cell activities, inhibits antibody production by B cells, enhances the cytolytic activity of natural killer (NK) cells and modulates several functions of macrophages and neutrophils in humans, rodents and invertebrates both in vitro and in vivo (for review, see Sibinga and Goldstein, 1988; Gilmore et al., 1990; Carr, 1991; Heijnen et al., 1991) . All of these cell types have been shown to infiltrate the CNS following i.c. infection with various strains of JHMV (Dorries et al., 1991; Williamson et al., 1991; Williamson, 1992) , and it has been well documented that immunocompetence is essential in the first few p.i. days to control virus replication and prevent death due to encephalitis (Weiner, 1973; Sussman et al., 1989; Zimmer and Dales, 1989; Williamson and Stohlman, 1990) . The kinetics of the appearance of immune cells suggest that the early immune response in the brain is nonspecific, involving asialo-GM-1 and/ or NKl.l-bearing NK cells and Mac-1 + macrophages (Williamson et al., 1991; Williamson, 1992) , which can be isolated as early as day 3 p.i. Interestingly, in vivo infusion of/3-endorphin into the lateral cerebral ventricles of the rat brain induces macrophage or monocyte chemotaxis into the ventricle (Saland et al., 1983 . In vitro,/3-endorphin and other opioid peptides stimulate human lymphocyte and monocyte motility and chemotaxis (Van Epps and Saland, 1984; Ye et al., 1989; Sacerdote and Panerai, 1989; Heagy et al., 1990) , increase human neutrophil adherence to serum-coated glass (Van Epps and Kutvirt, 1987) , enhance the secretion of interleukin-1 in mouse bone marrow-derived ceils (Apte et al., 1990) and stimulate gamma interferon (IFN-y) secretion in human mononuclear cells (Brown and Van Epps, 1986) . Since intracerebral injection of IFN-y results in the migration of inflammatory cells into the rat brain within 48 h (Sethna and Lampson, 1991) , /3-endorphin may also act indirectly to recruit an early immune response to clear JHMV from the brain.",

Maximal IgM titers (> 200 /zg m1-1) occur on days 10-12 p.i., while IgG is detected first on days 10-11 p.i. Thus, it is unlikely that antibody can account for the reduction in virus growth on days 3 and 5 p.i. following /3-endorphin administration. In addition, we did not detect differences in antibody titers between /3-endorphin-treated and untreated mice at days 12-13 p.i., when serum was tested to confirm virus infection (data not shown). Finally,/3-endorphin has been clearly shown to have an inhibitory effect on antibody production in rodents (reviewed in Sibinga and Goldstein, 1988; Gilmore et al., 1990; Carr, 1991; Heijnen et al., 1991) .",

            "text": "Since virus growth is also restricted at least until day 9 p.i. (Fig. 2) , the possibility that /3-endorphin may influence the function of antigen-specific (or nonspecific) immune cells entering the CNS during later stages of infection must be considered. This possibility gains credibility in view of the fact that by day 5 p.i., T cells capable of proliferating and secreting interleukin-2 (IL-2) and IFN-y in response to JHMV begin a second, antigen-specific wave of defense against the virus (Williamson et al., 1991; Williamson, 1992) . In addition, preliminary data in our laboratory indicate that JHMV-specific T cell proliferation is enhanced 70-200% in lymphocytes isolated from the cervical lymph nodes of/3-endorphin-treated, infected mice compared with the response of cells isolated from untreated, control mice (data not shown). Thus, a single i.c. administration of fl-endorphin is capable of significant influence on 'later' immune activities. In view of this finding, and since paralytic-demyelinating disease induced by JHMV variant 2.2-V-1 is dependent on the presence of T cells , it will be of special interest to determine whether a delay in /3-endorphin administration at least 5 days following JHMV infection will result in exacerbation of disease. Ultimately, it may be possible not only to manipulate specific stages of the disease in a predictable fashion, but also to design successful strategies for the treatment of immune-mediated CNS disease.",
