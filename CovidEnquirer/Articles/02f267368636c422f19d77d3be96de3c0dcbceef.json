            "text": "One of the main problems in nucleic acid-based techniques for detection of infectious agents, such as influenza viruses, is that of nucleic acid sequence variation. DNA probes, 70-nt long, some including the nucleotide analog deoxyribose-Inosine (dInosine), were analyzed for hybridization tolerance to different amounts and distributions of mismatching bases, e.g. synonymous mutations, in target DNA. Microsphere-linked 70-mer probes were hybridized in 3M TMAC buffer to biotinylated single-stranded (ss) DNA for subsequent analysis in a Luminex \u00d5 system. When mismatches interrupted contiguous matching stretches of 6 nt or longer, it had a strong impact on hybridization. Contiguous matching stretches are more important than the same number of matching nucleotides separated by mismatches into several regions. dInosine, but not 5-nitroindole, substitutions at mismatching positions stabilized hybridization remarkably well, comparable to N (4-fold) wobbles in the same positions. In contrast to shorter probes, 70-nt probes with judiciously placed dInosine substitutions and/or wobble positions were remarkably mismatch tolerant, with preserved specificity. An algorithm, NucZip, was constructed to model the nucleation and zipping phases of hybridization, integrating both local and distant binding contributions. It predicted hybridization more exactly than previous algorithms, and has the potential to guide the design of variation-tolerant yet specific probes.",

Because of this extreme variability, it is often difficult to identify regions within a specific virus genome that are sufficiently evolutionarily conserved to serve as targets for specific detection primers and probes. RNA viruses are especially variable. The influenza virus, a negative sense, single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) virus with a highly variable RNA genome, for example, has been known to cause the diagnostic problem that is at the basis of this article, because of a high rate of mutation and genetic drift. In such situations, optimal detection primers and probes would be broadly targeted yet specific, and remain functional even if the genome sequence changed because of genetic drift.",

The new algorithm includes aspects of NN theory (8, (20) (21) (22) but extends this to longer hybridizing segments and includes the effects of dInosine in the long oligonucleotides. Visual Omp TM 7.0 predicted that some 70-mer combinations would not hybridize, yet they did hybridize. In order to better predict hybridization, we investigated predictive strategies that took into account the matching nt, its neighbors, the length of the matching region, and the cooperativity of neighboring matching regions. We finally settled for an algorithm which attempts to model the nucleation and zipping stages during the hybridization process. The new model was termed NucZip ( Figure 5B ). The results obtained using this model was then correlated with those obtained using Visual OMP TM 7.0 and both were compared with experimental data.",

Thus, ZipScore modex = AE k = 1 k = kmax (AE n = 3 n = 15 S n ), where kmax is the number of uninterrupted matching segments, including the chosen nucleation site, and S n is the number of successive segments of length n (varying from 3-15), i.e. the number of full length trimers, full length tetramers etc. up to full length pentadecamers, which fit into the matching segment. The same Zip scoring system was performed in two modes, counting dInosines either as matching (mode 1) or as mismatching (mode 2). In the second mode, dInosines will shorten the length of matching segments, decreasing the score. The final ZipScore was calculated as a weighted mean of ZipScore mode1 and ZipScore mode2 , where the weighting factor was based on the empirical data presented in the current report (Figures 2-4) . Since dInosine hybridizes more strongly to C than to the other nts, the algorithm adds a contribution based on the number of dI:C pairs weighted by an InoCfactor. The upstream and downstream ZipScores were obtained as: ZipScore downstream =ZipScore mode1 -dInosinefactor (ZipScore mode1 -ZipScore mode2 )+(dInoCnr * dInoCfactor) and ZipScore upstream = ZipScore mode1 -dInosinefactor (ZipScore mode1 -ZipScore mode2 )+(dInoCnr * dInoCfactor).",

Hybridization can be improved by utilizing a less stringent (lower) hybridization temperature. Furthermore, grouped mismatches tend to strengthen the hybridization compared to evenly distributed mismatches. Consequently, for hybridization between 70-mer strands with 10-20 mismatches, the distribution of the mismatching nt affects the hybridization more than the number of mismatches, indicating that the length and number of perfectly matching stretches are of greatest importance.",

The 33%9nt, 33%12nt and 33%15nt targets have a region of 20, 19 or 18 sm in combination with one region of 9, 12 and 15 perfectly matching nt at the 5 0 end ( Figure 3D , nt sequences in Supplementary  Table 2A and B) . As demonstrated in Figure 3A and B (and confirmed in Figure 3C ), the targets 33%9nt and 33%9F failed to hybridize with the InflA probe, while the 33%15F target hybridized at both hybridization temperatures (60% of the total MFI, 3517 MFI, at 45 C; 39% of the total MFI, 1934 MFI, at 55 C).

Thus, for a 70-mer probe to hybridize with a target containing a relatively long stretch of sm, it must have (i) one uninterrupted perfectly matching region of at least 15 nt at 45 C, and longer than 15 nt at 55 C, or (ii) two uninterrupted matching regions of at least 12 nt at 45 C or 15 nt at 55 C.",

When utilizing the 21Ino_9nt5 0 probe with the 33%xnt targets, the MFI decreased because of the mismatches created by the two sm at the 3 0 end of the target (4-10% of the total MFI, 232-415 MFI at 45 C). In comparison, the 21Ino_9nt5 0 probe and the 33%xF targets, with no mismatch, hybridized at 26-43% of the total MFI (1692-2898 MFI at 45 C). Furthermore, the 21Ino_9nt3 0 , which did cover the two sm at the 3 0 end of 33%xnt, hybridized more strongly (10-21% of total the MFI, 450-695 MFI at 45 C) than the 21Ino_9nt5 0 probe (4-10% of the total MFI, 232-415 MFI at 45 C). Both these results demonstrate that using the less stringent temperature (45 C) permits hybridization even when a large number of Inosines is present (21 dInosines in a 70-mer probe), as long as a matching region of at least 9 nt is formed in the hybrid.",

The presence of a dInosine in a specific position instead of a wobble would theoretically decrease the degeneration of the probe and subsequently increase the concentration of the particular probe variant. A probe with 21 N wobbles, wobbN_21, at the same positions as the dInosines in the Ino21 probe, was tested. The surprising result was that the probe containing N wobbles hybridized very well with the InflA target (29% of the total MFI, 2220 MFI, Figure 2C ) and the 21-pm target (29% of the total MFI, 2190 MFI, Figure 2C ). This is in the same range as hybridization of the Ino21 probe with the InflA (26% of the total MFI, 1976 MFI, Figure 2C ) and 21-pm (11% of the total MFI, 794 MFI, Figure 2C ) targets (39 and 37% of the total MFI versus the InflA and the 21-pm targets, see Figure 2A ). These results also demonstrate that the wobb_N21 probe is not affected to the same extent as the Ino21 probe by increasing the hybridization temperature from 45 to 55 C ( Figure 2C ). The test was repeated by comparing an Ino18 with a wobbN_18 probe ( Figure 3C and D) . At 45 C, the Ino18 probe hybridized at least as well as the wobbN_18 probe while, at 55 C, the wobbN_18 probe hybridized better than the Ino18 probe. Interestingly, a probe containing 24 wobbles still hybridized better with all 33%xnt and 33%xF targets (30-45% of the total MFI at 45 C; 13-22% of total MFI at 55 C; Figure 3C ) compared with Ino24 (6-16% of the total MFI at 45 C; 1% of the total MFI at 55 C; Figure 3A and B). Obviously, the 70-mer probes can accommodate multiple degenerate positions and still hybridize because the majority of probe molecules will contain several long perfectly matching stretches created by chance. This is further deliberated under Discussion section.",

According to Loakes and Brown (1994) , 5-nitroindole is less destabilizing than its 4-and 6-isomers (27) and than 3-nitropyrrole (9). A probe with 18 5-nitroindole residues (5-NitroInd_18) was designed; the nt analogs were distributed to match the pattern of the dInosines in the Ino18 probe ( Figure 3D ). The probes were allowed to hybridize with the InflA target and the set of targets with sm, 33%_xF and 33%_xnt ( Figure 3C ). At 45 C, hybridization of 5-NitroInd_18 with the InflA (44% of the total MFI), 33%_xF (23-37% of the total MFI), and 33%_xnt (4-7% of the total MFI) targets resulted in hybridization signals that were much lower than those seen with the Ino18/InflA (73% of the total MFI), Ino18/33%_xF (54-78% of the total MFI), and Ino18/33%_xnt (47-59% of the total MFI) probes ( Figure 3C, 45 C) . Increasing the temperature to 55 C destabilized the 5-NitroInd_18 probe even more, resulting in hybridization of only 1-8% of the total MFI. In conclusion, dInosine functions much better than 5-nitroindole as a universal nt analog, under 3 M TMAC buffer conditions.",

We analyzed how many mismatches outside the rescuing position of dInosine (mismatch outside dInosine; mmoi) a probe can tolerate. Norovirus, Ino18 and InflA probes were tested against a set of targets whose sequences were designed to range successively from a Norovirus sequence to the InflA sequence, allowing different amounts of mismatch and mmoi to be analyzed. Norovirus is a highly variable, positive-sense RNA virus belonging to the Caliciviridae, which causes 'winter vomiting disease'. The Norovirus sequence chosen (the capsid gene of the Norwalk-like virus, accession nr AY274264), after Blastn with the InflA probe sequence, has a short region of 8 nt that perfectly matches the end region of the InflA probe and has 10 dispersed matching nt ( Figure 4A ). The Norovirus target (70) 0_36_52 (0.8) (this code is explained below, and in the legend to Figure 4 ) was gradually changed to resemble the InflA target (0.8) 51_0_0 (70) by altering the central nt sequence. A set of targets was also created where the nine nt at the 5 0 end were changed into an InflA sequence and the central region was gradually changed from the Norovirus to the Influenza sequence, starting with (0.61) 9_27_42 (9.8). The targets were named according to the number of matching and mismatching nt in comparison with the three probes: (nt matching those of the Norovirus probe at 5 0 and 3 0 ) mismatching nt versus the Norovirus probe_Ino18 probe_InflA probe (nt matching those of the InflA probe at 5 0 and 3 0 ) (see Figure 4A ; nt sequences in Supplementary Table S3A and B) .",

The InflA probe did not hybridize with either of them, while the Noro probe hybridized weakly with both: 13% of the total MFI for the (0.11) 26_10_26 (9.8) target and 20% of the total MFI for the (10.10) 26_10_26 (0.8) target. The% MFI for the Noro probe was calculated by comparing the MFI with that of the Noro probe/Noro target hybridization. The stronger hybridization to the Noro probe than to the InflA probe can be explained by the distribution and length of the matching sequences between the 26 mismatches; the perfectly matching regions of 8 and 9 nt were not long enough to induce hybridization to the InflA probe, while one region of 11 nt (together with a 5-nt and a 6-nt region) or two longer flanking regions of 10 nt in the two targets was enough to induce hybridization with the Noro probe.",

            "text": "When the Ino18 probe (middle panel of Figure 4A ) was used with a target with 1 mmoi [i.e. (0.10) 35_1_17 (9.8)] or even 10 mmoi [(10.10) 26_10_26 (0.8)] located at the 5 0 and 3 0 ends of the target, outside the central region containing dInosines, there was no or little inhibition of hybridization at 45 C (71% of the total MFI, 4741 MFI, and 41% of the total MFI, 2773 MFI, respectively). Interestingly, when the 10 mmoi were evenly distributed within the region of 18 dInosines, as in the (0.11) 26_10_26 (9.8) target, hybridization was lost (0.9% of the total MFI, 59 MFI). The sensitivity to mmoi adjacent to dInosine was therefore investigated further. Targets with increasing numbers (2, 4 or 5) of mmoi neighboring the positions of dInosines successively reduced the hybridization signals: 2319 MFI (35% of the total) for the (10.10)_24_12_28_(0.8) target, 927 MFI (13%) for the (10.10)_22_14_30_(0.8) target, and 375 MFI (5.4%) for the (10.10)_21_15_31_(0.8) target, all at 45 C. Thus, dInosine is sensitive to neighboring mismatches. A comparison of the sensitivity of a dInosine-free probe (InflA) and a probe containing dInosine (Ino18) to neighboring mismatches showed that the dInosine-free InflA probe can hybridize to a target with 17 evenly distributed mismatches between two perfectly matching flanking sections of 9 and 8 nt, respectively [the (0.10) 35_1_17 (9.8) target, 24% of the total MFI, 1614 MFI at 45 C]. However, 7 mmoi adjacent to the dInosines completely destroyed hybridization between the Ino18 probe and the (10.10) 19_17_33 (0.8) target: 0.5% of the total MFI, 34 MFI, at 45 C. Results for 55 C are shown in Supplementary Figure S4B and Table 3 . The Ino18 probe failed to hybridize when 2 mmoi were placed next to the dInosines PAGE 11 OF . Thus, the hybridization capacity of a dInosine-containing sequence is severely reduced when the mismatch is adjacent to the dInosine. Figure 4A also shows how introduction of many dInosines affects the specificity. There was no hybridization between the influenza probe Ino18 with its 18 dInosines and the Norovirus target (70) 0_36_52 (0.8). Furthermore, although the dInosines mask 16 mismatches in the (0.11) 26_10_26 (9.8) target, the 10 mmoi that are in close proximity to the dInosines abolish hybridization (0.9% of total MFI, 59 MFI). In contrast, the other target containing 26 mismatching nt and 10 distant mmoi, (10.10) 26_10_26 (0.8), did hybridize to the Ino18 probe (41% of total MFI, 2773 MFI). Thus, the cross hybridization of a foreign (unrelated) dInosine-containing probe is dependent to a certain extent on the amount of mismatch, but is even more dependent on the distribution of mmoi. Figure 4B and Supplementary Table S6 show the origin of the nt that are not covered by the dInosines when using the Ino18 probe (MFI values from Figure 4A ). They demonstrate the number of InflA-matching nt outside the dInosine position (moi) needed for hybridization and the number of Norovirus moi causing cross hybridization. At least 37-38 InflA moi were needed to induce hybridization with the Ino18 probe but, as mentioned above, the distribution is at least as important as the actual number of matching and mismatching nt. Of the fewer than 30-31 nt that were of Norovirus origin in a target that hybridized with the Ino18 probe, 16 nt were common to both Norovirus and Influenza virus. If more than 31 nt were of Norovirus origin, hybridization to the Influenza Ino18 probe failed.",

All four microsphere-bound probes detected the consensus synthetic rotavirus target as well as the amplified rotavirus nucleic acid from all five clinical samples. Interestingly, the four probes hybridized almost equally well within each sample. It was found that an asymmetric PCR of the clinical samples was necessary in order to obtain an MFI of reasonable strength from the probes (data not shown). This was probably because the complementary strand of the PCR product outcompeted the probe due to an affinity between the two strands that was higher than that between a dInosine-containing degenerated probe and the target strand. The data in Figure 5B are from one of the experiments using samples run in duplicate. The PCR products were sequenced (Supplementary Table S4 ), revealing that the Ino14_w4 and Ino11_w7 probes, which belonged to the same haplotype, covered the variations in all positions in all samples. However, the other pair of probes (Ino8_w4 and Ino5_w7) had one mismatch against clinical samples 1 and 2 and two mismatches against clinical samples 3, 4 and 5, as well as the consensus synthetic rotavirus target (magenta colored boxes in targets in Figure 5C , Supplementary Table S4 ). In conclusion, the long dInosine-containing degenerated probes worked well as variation-tolerant probes, covering variations, accepting a few mismatches, and still remaining specific (neither of the Rotavirus probes hybridized with the InflA target).",

To investigate these differences, each outlier in Figure 6B was connected to its plot position in Figure 6A ; see Figure 7A and B. Figure 7 shows that probe-target combinations containing many mismatches and dInosines were the main causes of the lower correlation between predicted and observed hybridization in Figure 6B . However, hybridizations between a long probe and a short target were not included in Figures 6  and 7 . Nor were data from probes containing 5-nitroindole or N-wobbles, because a full investigation such as this would require many more observations and would be out of the scope of this article. The NucZip results are further discussed in the Discussion section.",

The hybridization of combinations involving many mismatches and many dInosines was poorly predicted. However, when the NucZip algorithm was used, a higher degree of correlation was observed. The adjusted determination coefficient (R a 2 ) was 0.8636, indicating that 87% of the variation was explained by the NucZip algorithm, while the best fit of MFI% to the Visual Omp TM 7.0 predictions gave a determination coefficient of 0.7505, indicating that 75% of the variation was explained by NN theory (as embodied in Visual Omp TM 7.0). NN theory was thus insufficient for predicting hybridization under the hybridization conditions of our study. A high number of mismatches and dInosines gave hybridization predictions in Visual Omp TM 7.0 that were too low ( Figure 6B ). The NucZip algorithm, which takes into account the length of matching segments and cooperativity effects within and between matching oligonucleotide segments, increased the accuracy of hybridization prediction. dInosines were scored intermediate between matches and mismatches.",

            "text": "In pursuit of this level of understanding, and in order to obtain reliable hybridization data, we chose to use the Luminex suspension array system in our studies. The inherent ability of the system to report the median of a high number of measurements (i.e. measuring hybridizations signals from 100 different beads) provides highly reliable data. Moreover, hybridization equilibrium is reached more rapidly using the suspension array system (taking around 15 min) than by solid phase hybridizations such as micro arrays (often overnight). A probe length of 70 nt was selected for our studies because of the elevated mismatch tolerance of this length compared with shorter probes (29) . However, the advantage of the extended length of the probe could possibly be countered by a loss of specificity. Hybridization studies using long (50 or more nt) probes in a 3 M TMAC buffer system have not been reported previously; in reports using other hybridization systems, however, it has been suggested that 50-mer or 70-mer probes should contain no more than 15-20 contiguous nt complementary to non-targets (29, 30) . Previously, the hybridization properties of long probes have been analyzed using microarrays, with overnight (16) and ConSort\u00df, to find suitable regions for primers to be used in reverse-transcription PCR and a conserved region for a detection probe. The length of the black bars represents the frequency of variation as an average percentage conservation at each nt position (y-axis). The figure shows the alignment and variation of 214 Rotavirus A sequences in the nt position of the probes displayed in Figure 5C . ConSort\u00df was used to group the variations of the probe region into two haplotypes, which were then used to construct the probes shown in Figure 5C and Supplementary Table S4A Letowski et al. found that, under microarray conditions, mismatches grouped at the 5 0 or 3 0 end of a 50-mer probe affected the binding to a target less than if the mismatches were distributed throughout or centered in the probe. Furthermore, the 50-mer probes with mismatches distributed along the whole probe were more destabilized than the probes that had mismatches centered in the duplex (34) . When Deng et al. studied mismatches in 50-mer microarray probes with 1-7 pm in different distribution patterns, they concluded that the signal intensity was decreased more by evenly distributed than by randomly distributed pm (32) . When 60-mer Figure 2A , 3A and 4A were plotted against the predicted \u00c1G calculated in Visual OMP TM 7.0 (DNA Software). The predicted \u00c1G was obtained for the interaction between probes and targets in 3M TMAC buffer at a hybridization temperature of 45 C. The percentage MFI is the MFI signal of a probe hybridized with a study target divided by the MFI signal of the same probe hybridized with its perfectly matching target (e.g. InflA probe against InflA target) at the same temperature. Regression lines were calculated using the SigmaPlot dynamic curve fitting system. A five parameter sigmoidal function gave the highest correlation [f = y 0 +a/ (1+exp (-(xx 0 ) oligonucleotides were hybridized in a microarray, mismatches located near the middle of the probe resulted in a greater reduction of signal intensity than those located at the ends (33) . Additionally, microarray experiments with short oligonucleotides (16-40 nt) and one mismatch or a nt insertion in all positions show that the hybridization signal decreases when the mismatching portion is centered (35, 36) . The matching segments are shorter when mismatches are centered than when they are located peripherally. Our results, using microsphere-bound 70-mer probes and Luminex technology in a buffer containing 3 M TMAC, confirm that the distribution of the mismatches is of great importance and that hybridization is stronger when there are a few longer uninterrupted sequences than when there are many short sequences. These effects are formulated in the NucZip algorithm.",

For instance, a sequence with two wobbling bases present in nine positions of variation would give a degeneracy of 512 unique sequence combinations, while a target with 14 variations including A, T, C or G would demand a set of 268 \u00c2 10 6 unique probes (degeneracy 268 \u00c2 10 6 ). Honore\u00e9 t al. successfully used 18-23 nt probes with a degeneracy of up to 512 in 3 M TMAC buffer (40) . In the more stringent PCR buffers, the usage of probes with a degeneracy greater than 10 is not often reported (41) . Degenerated primers have the property of being 'forgiving' (41) (42) (43) . This is because the amplimer from a previously successful primer is a target for the same pool of primers in the next round of amplification, leading to an accumulation of amplifiable targets. However, the situation for a probe is different. A degenerate probe will always face the same target variation. Therefore, universal bases like dInosine may be more useful than degenerated sites for probes, as long as the hybridization strength (represented by T m or -\u00c1G) is good enough. The introduction into a probe of a universal base like dInosine instead of a wobbling base reduces the complexity of the oligonucleotide mixture and increases the actual number of hybridizing oligonucleotides.",

The aim was to reduce the degeneracy in probes used for screening cDNA libraries. They found that dInosines had a slightly destabilizing effect on hybridization, especially when hybridizing against A, G and T, but that this could be minimized by reducing the hybridization temperature. However, the behavior of dInosine in long probes in 3 M TMAC has, to our knowledge, not previously been systematically explored. The 3 M TMAC is known to increase the binding contribution of the A:T base pairs, resulting in a similar contribution to T m to that from the G:C base pairs. The high ionic strength makes this an environment of relatively low hybridization stringency. The general trend shown in our study (e.g. Figure 2A and B), that dInosine in the probe decreases hybridization in 3 M TMAC, indicates that TMAC did not enhance the binding strength of dInosine base pairs as much as that of A:T base pairs; cf (8) . In a segment with dInosines at every third base, such as in the Ino18 probe, every matching nt neighbors a dInosine, i.e. it will not bind as strongly as a probe containing neighboring matches. Clearly, dInosine matches cause less destabilization than mismatches, and allow hybridization of probe/ target combinations with many short matching segments, like the InflA probe / 21-pm target combination. It is reasonable to assume that when a probe fails to hybridize due to a high number of mismatches in the target, dInosines at these positions will restore hybridization, since dInosine appears to bridge adjacent matching stretches, increasing their ability to nucleate.",

To understand how the highly degenerated probes, wobbN_21, wobbN_18 and wobb_N24, hybridized so well, we calculated the probability of randomly achieving an extension of the matching regions at the 5 0 and 3 0 ends of the wobbN_18 probe (Table 4 ). The probability that the closest N wobble to either the 5 0 or 3 0 end would be a perfect match is 0.5. Thus, 50% of the pool of degenerated probes have a 3 nt longer perfect match (12+9 or 9+12 matching nt at the 5 0 and 3 0 flanking regions) which, according to our results with non-degenerated probe/target combinations, should lead to rather good hybridization of the wobbN_18. In fact, wobbN_18 hybridization was similar in strength to that of the InflA probe to the 33%12F or 33%15nt targets. Furthermore, the probability of having several additional 5-nt matching regions in the central region is also high, probably giving rise to many more combinations in the same pool that matched There is a high probability of several additional matching regions of 5 nt in the central region, which will contribute to hybridization.",

By restricting the wobbles to 3 (e.g. a D or a B) or 2 (e.g. a Y or a T) nt, the probability of a match becomes even greater. Thus, in a highly degenerated probe with at least one continuous region of perfectly matching nt, a large part of the pool will extend this region and contribute to nucleation, zipping and hybridization. The behavior of the highly degenerated probes is encouraging and in accordance with the NucZip model, which predicts that the high likelihood of several matching stretches of 5 nt or longer will result in significant hybridization. One of the aims of this study was to investigate the binding capacity of dInosine in 3M TMAC. 5-NitroIndole was chosen as a comparative universal base. The results shown in Figure 3C demonstrate that 5-NitroIndole in the 5-NitroInd_18 probe had a much greater destabilizing effect than dInosine in the Ino_18 probe, without the same capacity to rescue hybridization with a target containing many sm. Furthermore, the 5-NitroInd_18 probe was more affected than the Ino_18 probe when the hybridization temperature was raised from 45 to 55 C. It is concluded that, under 3 M TMAC buffer conditions, dInosine is a better choice than 5-NitroIndole when designing a variation-tolerant probe with as little degeneration as possible.",

            "text": "Recently, Majlessi et al. (15) studied the nucleation process during double helix formation of short probes, 18-28 nt, with RNA or DNA targets of varying lengths and number of mismatches, in a buffer containing lithium succinate and lithium lauryl sulfate at pH 5.1. Hybridization is initiated by random collisions, but occasionally the complex is stable enough to nucleate the hybridization process. After investigating their model, they suggested that one nucleation region of 9 nt is not enough for further zipping and formation of a double helix. Instead, the first nucleation site needs a second nucleation site so that they can then cooperatively induce the zipping mechanism. They reported that inactivation of one of the 9-nt sites reduced hybridization >2-fold. Interestingly, one complete turn of a dsDNA molecule consists of 10.4 nt (44) . It is conceivable that the first (often temporary) contact between two single nucleic acid strands (nucleation) should not exceed one turn of the dsDNA helix in length, to avoid torsional disturbance and faulty interlocking of the strands. From this point of view, the nucleation site should be long enough to minimize false contacts, and short enough to have minimal steric effects on the strands. Nucleation sites of 6-9 nt fulfil these criteria. The chance of two random single strands matching at a hexanucleotide is 1/16 394, and at a nonanucleotide is 1/ 1 048 576. A matching nonanucleotide will thus reduce the ratio of random successful to unsuccessful nucleations, i.e. those which do not lead to further hybridization in the subsequent zipping phase, a million-fold. The subject is far beyond the scope of this article; however, our data, using 70-mer probes in 3 M TMAC buffer, reveal that a target with two separate regions of 9 nt was enough for efficient hybridization when several shorter regions of 5-6 nt were available between mismatches during the hybridization process (InflA probe/26%9F, 2583 MFI). Increasing the number of mismatches, i.e. shortening the matching regions between the 9 nt flanking regions, caused failure of hybridization (InflA probe/33%9F, 133 MFI and InflA probe/74%9F target, 86 MFI). In contrast, the Ino18 probe, with dInosines covering the mismatches and nine matching nt at the 5 0 and 3 0 ends, hybridized strongly (Ino18/33%9F, 3894 MFI). Furthermore, the InflA probe/74%15nt or InflA probe/74%18nt combinations showed that one region of 15-18 nt was enough to induce and sustain hybridization reproducibly, even if the rest of the 70-mer probe contained 74% mismatches. Having two perfectly matching regions of 15 nt (15F) compared to one region of 15 nt (15 nt) gave 2.6-fold higher MFI for 33%15F compared to 33%15 nt and 4.5-fold higher MFI for 74%15F compared to 74%15 nt, at 45 C. The Ino24 probe, with no dInosine-free matching trimers, hybridized inefficiently with all targets (361-920 MFI at 45 C), showing that dInosine is relatively inefficient in creating nucleating regions. Thus, two nucleation sites of 9 nt are enough to cause hybridization in 3 M TMAC when they are placed next to each other to form a longer region or when there are enough shorter matching regions of 5-6 nt between them. Alternatively, dInosines could bridge the mismatches between the 9-nt regions.",

A 70-mer probe is able to hybridize with a region of 15 nt in an otherwise highly mismatching target in 3 M TMAC (74%15 nt, Figure 3A ). To summarize, the current study shows that a dInosine-free probe of 70 nt needs (i) at least three regions of at least six perfectly matching nt, (ii) two stretches of 12-15 perfectly matching nt, or (iii) one stretch of 15-18 perfectly matching nt to result in measurable hybridization. Probes with a high number of dInosines positioned at sites of variation need shorter matching regions than dInosine-free probes. It is suggested that this is probably because dInosine participates in nucleation and zipping during the hybridization process. Thus, a probe with 18 dInosines which match mismatches in the target needs either (i) two regions of 9 nt if the hybridization temperature is 55 C, or (ii) one region of nine perfectly matching nt at 45 C.",

Furthermore, the assumption that sm all differ at the third codon base is an oversimplification. Some synonymous codons also differ at the first and second bases. Thus, even if the Ino18 probe could hybridize when 11 of 17 trimers were intact, with perfect matches at bases 1 and 2, the tolerance to mmoi of a highly dInosine-substituted probe like Ino18 is limited. Around half of its six surplus trimers must be reserved for sm occurring at codon positions 1 and 2. This leaves three trimers available for non-synonymous mismatches.

The NucZip algorithm is now under revision to include probes containing 1, 2, 3 or 4 nt wobbles, as well as taking into account the results with the universal base 5-nitroindole. The algorithms, schematically described in Figure 8 , (i) were based on our experimental data (described above) and (ii) included highly matching nucleation sites extending beyond the neighboring nt. Thus, unlike the NN theory, NucZip takes the effects of matches at longer distances into account. The unique property of 3 M TMAC to provide a roughly equal contribution to hybridization by A:T and G:C pairs justifies simple computational approaches. The well known additivity of binding contributions per nt inherent in \u00c1G calculations according to the NN theory (22, 45) indicates that hybridization can be treated in a relatively simplistic way. Our concepts were based on the finding that the longer the sequence of uninterrupted matching nt, the more stable is the hybridization. Our calculations were thus focused more on binding than on destabilization, i.e. the use of positive rather than negative contributions. One of the weaknesses of the NN theory is that it adds all contributions, positive or negative, to a grand sum. The negative contributions are subtracted for the whole molecule, instead of in the local context where they belong. In our approach, the binding is first assessed locally, mimicking nucleation, and then extended cooperatively to the whole molecule, mimicking the zipping process. It is binding that keeps the hybrid together, and it is thus logical to focus on binding.",

            "text": "Three matching trimers account for approximately one turn [10.4 nt (44) ] of the helix of a dsDNA molecule. It is thus likely that two long DNA strands become entangled or conformationally committed when at least one turn of the helix has been completed. Nucleation has to proceed rapidly, without too much torsion and entanglement, to allow many encounters in a short time. We envision that contact between two strands extending to 9 nt allows rapid comparison between strands with only local torsional disturbance. If the brief contact does not achieve binding strength over a certain threshold (the nucleation threshold), the strands separate and new comparisons are made. If the nucleation threshold is exceeded at initial contact, Total ZipScore mode1 : 25+12+12=49 Total ZipScore mode2 : 25+12+5+1=43 ZipScore downstream : 49-dInosinefactor*(49-43)+(dInoCnr*dInoCfactor) contiguous tri-to pentadecamers Figure 8 . The zipping component of NucZip. When a 6-9-bp sequence fulfilling the nucleation criteria has been detected, hybridization up and downstream of the nucleating site is attempted (zipping). The figure shows the downstream zipping process, with successive accumulation of score within a matching segment arising from the trimers, tetramers, etc. up to pentadecamers (each scoring equally) which fit into it. In this way, a longer matching segment gets more than a linear increase in score relative to a shorter one. Zipping extends from the potential nucleation site, terminating with a mismatch or the end of one of the strands. dInosines are counted as intermediate between a match and a mismatch, as described in the 'Materials and Methods' section. If several consecutive matching segments are encountered, their scores are added. binding extends further up and downstream, i.e. zipping occurs. This proceeds as long as the binding strength remains sufficient. The strands are held together chemically by base-base interactions and topologically by the multiple turns of intertwinement. It was a challenge to model this process. In the NucZip model, the program first tests for possible nucleation sites and selects the two highest scoring sites for further evaluation. Zipping is then performed up and downstream from each suggested nucleation site. The zipping algorithm symbolizes the successive cooperativity of binding by adding the number of successive tri-to pentadecamers for each matching segment, each of which ends either in a mismatch or at the end of one or two of the oligonucleotides. The contribution of added dInosine molecules is counted less than those of proper matches. The highest scoring nucleation point is chosen as the result. The results using degenerated probes were in line with this NucZip theory. A long matching segment created by a wobble position increased hybridization strength beyond the contribution of the additional single match.",

            "text": "At present, the NucZip model is intended for equally long nt segments. Exceptions to the model found in the experimental section of this work can be illustrated by the remarkable difference in hybridization between the short perfectly matching targets of 15-22 nt (15 nt_free, 18 nt_free and 22 nt_free) and the longer 70-mer targets (74%_15 nt, 74%_18 nt and 74%_22 nt) ( Figure 3A , B and D). Several groups have analyzed the effect of short so-called dangling ends of 1-5 nt (23) (24) (25) (26) , and report that they appear to stabilize hybridization of the duplex. Doctycz et al. observed that the dangling nt closest to the duplex contributed most to the stabilizing effect (47) . The lengths of our long mismatching ends ranged from 55 to 48 nt with a 74%-nt mismatch and no matching trimers. We speculate that the destabilization seen in a duplex with two long mismatching ends, one from the probe and one from the target, compared with a duplex between a long and a short oligonucleotide, with only one long protruding oligonucleotide, is due to shearing stress on the matching nt, or to competition from intra-strand secondary structures at the separate ends.",

The NN model, which was developed with great precision by SantaLucia et al. (8, (20) (21) (22) and is used in the Visual OMP TM 7.0 computer program, is much more sophisticated than our procedure. It was considered out of the scope of this article to evaluate the Visual OMP TM 7.0 program in detail; however, importantly, its hybridization conditions can be adjusted. When Visual OMP TM 7.0 was used to calculate \u00c1G (Figure 6 ), the buffer and temperature conditions were set at 3 M TMAC and 45 C. Comparison of the NucZip and Visual OMP TM 7.0 models showed that the distribution of the targets with the long dangling ends (74%_Xnt) was corrected to a certain extent by NucZip; however, neither NucZip nor Visual OMP 7.0 accurately predicted the hybridization behavior of the short perfectly matching probe-target combinations of the InflA probe with the 15nt_free, 18nt_free and 22nt_free targets.",

            "text": "In conclusion, we have demonstrated that the distribution of mismatches greatly affects probe hybridization. A minimum number of continuous, perfectly matching stretches (nucleation sites) is needed to initiate hybridization. Thus, if the target contains many variations and no long uninterrupted matching segments, use of a dInosine-containing probe, which partially overcomes the obstacles caused by mismatches, will be beneficial. With respect to hybridization prediction algorithms, a simple statement of percentage mismatch, as used in many such algorithms, does not adequately reflect the hybridization properties of a long duplex. The insertion of dInosines in the positions of variation could detect target nucleic acid that a consensus probe would fail to catch. Hence, while high dInosine content in a probe decreases the probe's binding capacity, it also covers mismatches, as required when creating mismatch-tolerant, broaddetection probes against highly variable target nucleic acid sequences such as those seen in RNA viruses. The dInosine probes can be made even more forgiving by using a lower hybridization temperature. Furthermore, the probability of cross hybridization is low because the mmoi neighboring the dInosines have a destabilizing effect on hybridization. While the aim of this study was to improve our understanding of variability and the effects of dInosines, other universal bases and wobbles in the design of probes to be used in a 3 M TMAC buffer system, with more exploratory work the results may also be relevant to other hybridization systems and could aid the development of hybridization-based diagnostic tools, including nanotechnological applications such as the volume-amplified magnetic nanobead detection assay (48, 49) .",
