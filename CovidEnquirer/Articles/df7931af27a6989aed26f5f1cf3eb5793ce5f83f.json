The purpose of this study is to apply the adaptive network-based fuzzy inference system (ANFIS) model to forecast the tourist arrivals to Taiwan and demonstrate the forecasting performance of this model. Based on the mean absolute percentage errors and statistical results, we can see that the ANFIS model has better forecasting performance than the fuzzy time series model, grey forecasting model and Markov residual modified model. Thus, the ANFIS model is a promising alternative for forecasting the tourist arrivals. We also use the ANFIS model to forecast the monthly tourist arrivals to Taiwan from Japan, Hong Kong and Macao, and the United States.",

            "text": "The tourism industry has grown rapidly over the past few decades. Due to the perishable nature of the tourism industry, the need for accurate forecasts is crucial. Both the public non-profit government sectors and the private profit companies are interested in finding an accurate forecasting technique to make operational, tactical and strategic decisions. Companies can, using the results from this forecasting technique, plan for potential tourism demand successfully and invest in tourism related facilities and equipments sufficiently, and government sectors can play a significant role in maintaining and improving tourism infrastructure. Therefore, various forecasting methods have been developed. They include exponential smoothing (Cho, 2003) , ARIMA (Cho, 2003; Chu, 1998; Goh & Law, 2002; Lim & McAleer, 2002) , vector autoregressive (Song & Witt, 2006; Wong, Song, & Chon, 2006) , neural networks (Chen & Wang, 2007; Cho, 2003; Law, 2000; Law & Au, 1999) , fuzzy time series (Wang, 2004; Wang & Hsu, 2008) , grey model (Hsu & Wen, 1998; Wang, 2004) , econometric (Hiemstra & Wong, 2002; Smeral, Witt, & Witt, 1992; Song & Witt, 2000; Witt & Martin, 1987) , regression-based model (Chan, 1993; Crouch, Schultz, & Valerio, 1992; Kulendran & Witt, 2001) and genetic algorithm (Chen & Wang, 2007; Hern\u00e1ndez-L\u00f3pez & C\u00e1ceres-Hern\u00e1ndez, 2007; Hern\u00e1ndez-L\u00f3pez, 2004; Hurley, Moutinho, & Witt, 1998) . But we can not find any paper adopting an adaptive net-work-based fuzzy inference system, referred to as ANFIS (Jang, 1993) , to forecast tourist arrivals. So, the purpose of this paper is to fill this gap, and we also try to compare the results with those of other models and use the ANFIS model to forecast the monthly tourist arrivals to Taiwan from the top three markets.",

It means that the ANFIS model is suitable for the tourist arrivals forecasting. Therefore, we use the ANFIS model to forecast tourist arrivals to Taiwan from the three markets: Hong Kong, the United States and Germany from 2001 to 2003, and compute the APE values of the three markets to present the forecasting accuracy of the ANFIS model. Table 4 shows that all the APE values of Hong Kong, the United States and Germany by the ANFIS model are below 2% in 2001, less than those by the GM (1, 1), Markov and fuzzy models, forecasted by Wang (2004) . The reason why the APE values of the ANFIS model do not become so small in 2003, is probably due to the outlier data that happened during the Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).",

Figs. 5 and 6 showed the initial and final membership functions of the input data respectively. After the training process, the trained ANFIS system could be used for forecasting. The forecasting results and corresponding MAPE values of the various forecasting models for the top three markets are listed in Table 5 . From Table 5 and Fig. 7 , we can find that seasonal fluctuations occurred in the six time series, and the actual values and the ANFIS forecasting values for tourist arrivals to Taiwan from the top three markets are very close.",

The empirical results, obtained in Section 3, by the ANFIS model yield more accurate tourist arrivals forecasting than that of the other models. Therefore, we conclude that the ANFIS model is a valid and promising alternative for forecasting tourist arrivals. From the results of Section 4, we can see that, owing to seasonal variation, the monthly tourist arrivals forecasting has larger MAPE values than the annual data and the root mean square errors become steady until a great amount of epochs.",
