We assessed the relative filtering efficacy of two currently used surgical face masks (one a molded mask, the other a tie-on mask) and a certified personal particulate respirator, all made by a single manufacturer. Methods. The authors sprayed bicarbonate particulate against a porcelain surface (representing the patient's mouth) and collected it via a mannequin head (representing the dentist's head) placed 40 centimeters away and a tube with two airflow rates (0.5 cubic meters per hour and 9 m 3 /hour). They calculated the dry residue weight. They performed three separate runs for each mask and three runs with no mask at the two airflow rates with and without aerosol. Results. With no mask (control), the authors recorded significant weight gains at both airflow rates with and without vaporization. With vaporization, the three masks were associated with different dry residue weights (P < .03 with the Kruskal-Wallis test at both flow rates), the respirator providing the lowest amount. The respirator provided an efficiency of 94 to 96 percent, compared with 90 to 92 percent and 85 to 86 percent for the molded and tie-on surgical masks, respectively. Conclusions. These data provide independent evidence that a certified personal respirator can be more effective than highquality surgical masks in dental settings. Clinical Implications. Dentists should be aware that a certified particulate respirator can provide them with superior filtering protection.",

Various studies have been performed on the filtering efficacy of different general-purpose surgical face masks. 10, 11, [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] In 1971, Micik and colleagues 11 exposed 15 general-purpose surgical face masks to aerosols comparable to those generated during dental procedures and found that only those made of glass or synthetic fiber displayed relatively high filtering efficiency. In 1987, Pippin and colleagues 18 showed that even when masks were worn correctly, the airflow during inhalation could bypass the mask material, resulting in reduced filtering efficacy and an increased health risk for dental operators. Moreover, general-purpose surgical face masks are designed mainly to capture microorganisms in exhaled breath rather than to protect operators from airborne infections. Although specifically designed personal respirators now exist, to our knowledge, no study of efficacy has yet been reported in the scientific literature.",

Aerosols were formed using the Mini-Clean device (Castellini SpA, Bologna, Italy) with air pressure set to 6 to 7 atmospheres and water flow to 1 atm. We placed the aerosol distributor at a distance of 1 centimeter from a smooth porcelain surface that simulated the patient's mouth. We used a mannequin head to simulate the dentist's face and placed it at a distance of 40 cm from the porcelain surface. The mannequin's oral cavity was covered with latex and had one entry (mouth) and one exit (throat), connected to a 250-milliliter collection flask containing 50 mL of distilled water by a polytetrafluoroethylene tube 30 cm long and 1 cm in diameter that terminated well below the surface of the water. A vacuum pump (Cattani SpA, Parma, Italy) attached to the flask provided two possible airflow rates through the tube of 0.5 cubic meters per hour and 9 m 3 /hour to simulate human breathing at rest and during exercise, respectively. We adjusted the airflow rates using the lock nut attached to the pump and calibrated by a flow meter. Using scanning electron microscopy, we found that the bicarbonate dust (Airflow Prophylaxis Powder, Electro Medical Systems, Nyon, Switzerland) was composed of particles of monosodium hydrogen carbonate (5-300 \u00b5m in diameter), silica particles (< 1 \u00b5m in diameter) and other (probably organic) particles of variable dimensions (10-20 \u00b5m in diameter).",

Under our experimental conditions, the personal device provided 94 to 96 percent filtering efficiency (slightly higher than the 92 percent efficiency level advertised by the manufacturer, probably owing to different testing procedures and conditions). By comparison, the levels of efficiency of the surgical masks were 90 to 92 percent and 85 to 86 percent, broadly in line with the manufacturer's claims.",

We thus provide independent confirmation that a certified personal device really is more effective in this setting. Our comparison, restricted to three masks made by a single manufacturer, indicates that a superior design can translate into significantly better filtering performance. To our knowledge, this is the first reported study on this topic for some years. In light of current concerns about transmission of airborne pathogens, we think that further studies are required to produce microbiological and other data on a wider variety of currently available masks.
