            "text": "Analysis of human monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) developed from influenza infected donors have enormously contributed to the identification of neutralization sensitive epitopes of influenza virus. The HA protein is a crucial target of neutralizing antibodies and at monoclonal level only Abs binding to HA have been able to neutralize the virus. In this study, eight A (H1N1)pdm 2009 seropositive patients within the age range of 20-50 years (median = 36 years) were recruited. Two anti-HA mAbs secreting stable clones, 2D8 and 2F12 were established under optimized conditions from the peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of the volunteers. These antibodies efficiently neutralized the homologous laboratory isolated strain of the pandemic virus as well as the reference strain. Our study suggests that the anti-HA antibodies derived from infected Indian patients display neutralization potential against the A(H1N1)pdm 2009 virus. This is the first ever study of generation of mAbs against the pandemic influenza virus involving the immune repertoire if Indian patients. Molecular characterization of the target regions will help in identifying potential immunogens in the Indian pandemic isolates and confer protective immunity against this virus.",

The susceptibility to influenza illness is most common in immunologically naive infants, immunocompromised individuals and elderly 1 . The virulence of influenza A virus is because of its easy spread by aerosol; the frequent changes in the viral antigens by antigenic drift and antigenic shift that enables it to escape from protective immunity. Influenza infection in humans is self-limiting, but the virus is known to cause substantial mortality and morbidity worldwide 2 . During the most devastating influenza pandemic of 1918 the global mortality reached to 50 million individuals in one year. In a stark reminder to the 1918 pandemic, the population that is considered fittest was the most vulnerable during the recent 2009 H1N1 pandemic 3 .",

Above all the vaccines have to be formulated annually as the existing year's vaccine may not provide protection to the newly emerging strains. Currently four antiviral drugs are approved for use against influenza virus but, their use is restricted due to possible side effects and rapid emergence of resistant strains in the recent years.

The antibodies were evaluated for their prophylactic or therapeutic efficacy by the assessment of morbidity (loss of weight), mortality, viral load and histopathologic examination of the lungs. The survival and weight loss experiments suggested that the mAb 2D8 achieved considerable protection at the doses 20 \u03bcg and 200 \u03bcg when administered prophylactically and therapeutically (table IV) . The 2F12 mAb was more effective at the dose of 200 \u03bcg. Viral load analysis was performed in the subgroups 2h pre and 24 h post challenge with 20 \u03bcg mAb.

            "text": "The production of human monoclonal antibodies is a much more complex procedure than the production of murine monoclonal antibodies. Scarcity of antibody producing cells in the peripheral blood and the difficulty to obtain the blood from naturally infected patients at the right time is one of the major concerns. Moreover, EBV transformed B cells are hard to grow and secrete very low amount of antibodies 13 . The instability of antibody production by Epstein-Barr virus transformed cells or fused cells is another concern. These factors result in the decreased fusion efficiency and the chances of obtaining a human hybridoma against an antigen of interest is only of the order of 10 -9 to10 -10. The human hybridoma technology is based on two main methods: fusion of Ab producing B cells to myeloma cells 14 and transformation of B lymphocytes with EBV 15 . Combination of both the methods has proved to be more beneficial than either of them alone 16 . In this study, we report the generation of two stable fusion clones, secreting monoclonal antibodies against A(H1N1)pdm09 influenza viruses. The conditions of EBV transformation and fusion with the heteromyeloma cell line were optimised by overcoming the limitations of the current technologies. The convalescent phase plasma of the eight influenza positive patients was screened for influenza virus specific antibodies, as the serum/plasma antibody titre is a critical factor for the generation of monoclonal antibodies from PBMCs. The PBMCs were EBV transformed in the presence of CpG oligonucleotides as it has been reported to increase the rate of EBV transformation 17 . An overall 7.8% transformation efficiency was achieved and the cells that were positive for antibodies against the pandemic H1N1 virus were fused with HMMA2.5 cells. The best antibody secreting hybrids were cloned at one cell /well to ensure monoclonal antibody generation and 2 stable fusion clones were obtained-2D8 and 2F12 that secreted mAbs against A(H1N1)pdm09 and showed neutralization in the in vitro as well as in vivo conditions. Monoclonal antibody 2D8 showed the maximum binding in the in vitro assays and neutralized the human isolate of the pandemic strain as well as the reference strain at lowest concentrations when compared to the 2F12 antibody. MAb 2F12 showed the lesser binding in ELISA and immunofluorescence assay and although it showed HAI and neutralizing activity, but at a higher concentration compared to the 2D8 antibody. The western blot analysis of the monoclonal antibodies revealed that 2D8 bound to the HA1 region in the denatured HA protein. 2F12 did not show binding to any of the region in the denatured HA protein. Hence, it is hypothesised that 2F12 may be binding a conformational epitope in the HA1 region. However, the binding properties of 2F12 need to be investigated further to confirm the hypothesis. The monoclonal antibodies did not show binding to the seasonal H3N2 or any other H1N1 or H3N2 virus against which its HAI activity was determined. The reference strains available in the laboratory were picked randomly for the HAI studies. Further studies regarding the mapping of the epitope of these antibodies can reveal more information on whether or not they exhibit cross reactivity to other influenza virus strains. The antibodies however, showed comparative neutralization and HAI activity between the laboratory isolates of the pandemic virus and the reference strain A/Cal/07/2009(H1N1). This data reflects the fact that these Indian pandemic isolates have not shown much deviation from the prototype pandemic strain in terms of antibody binding sites. The prophylactic and therapeutic efficacy of these antibodies was determined in mice. The antibody treatment was given 2 h before, 24 h after and 48 h after challenge with the pandemic strain. The in vivo results were consistent with the in vitro study and all the antibodies were able to considerably protect mice from lethal influenza challenge. Both the antibodies were protective prophylactically but, 2F12 could achieve only 60% protection in terms of survival assay at 20 \u03bcg, but achieved 100% survival rate at 200\u03bcg. The antibodies were less protective 48 h post infection as compared to 24 h, the fact that is supported by the survival assays and weight loss percentage. The histopathologic examination of the lungs was done in the group of mice that were treated therapeutically at 24h The hisptopathology data further supported the survival and morbidity results, as the lungs from the mice that were given therapeutic doses of the antibodies, showed considerably less signs of alveolar damage and neutrophilic infiltrates resulting from virus infection. The antibodies 2D8 and 2F12 may be employed as therapeutic agents for at least 48 h after influenza infection as is indicated by the studies in mice. To, the best of our knowledge, these antibodies are the first fully human monoclonal antibodies generated from the immune repertoire of Indian patients infected with A(H1N1)pdm09 virus. Molecular characterization of their epitopes with Indian pandemic isolates will reveal more information of their cross-protectivity and binding characteristics. The strength of our approach for antibody generation lies in the fact that it has used human immune repertoire rather than animals and the antibodies have been generated in response to a natural infection of influenza virus. Since, the antibodies have originated from humans, self -reactivity against self-antigens is minimised in comparison to antibodies that have been generated in mice or through the technique of phage display.",
