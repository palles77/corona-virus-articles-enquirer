The risk of contracting HCV from unprocessed tissue that is NAT HCV negative is estimated to be 1 in 421,000. 21 McAllister and colleagues 9 noted that the current risk of an allograft-transmitted infection appears to be much less than the overall risk of perioperative nosocomial infection.",

In 2005, the FDA set up 3 new regulations for entities involved in human tissue products: ''registration'' rules for tissue banking institutions, ''donor eligibility'' rules that provide criteria for donor screening and selection, and ''current good tissue practices'' rules that concern tissue procurement, processing, and distribution. 25 Currently, there is more federal oversight of tissue banks and improved donor screening and testing techniques, including the use of NAT. In the United States, all establishments that collect, process, or handle human cells, tissues, and cellular or tissue-based products must now register with the FDA.",

Heat and high doses of radiation (>3.0 Mrad) can produce an SAL of 10 \u00c06 , but such high doses substantially affect the biomechanical properties of allografts. 29, 30, 42, 43 The effects of lower levels of irradiation on allografts remain an area of controversy. 44 , 45 Schwartz and colleagues 45 confirmed in a goat model that 4.0 Mrad caused 30% and 21% reductions in stiffness and maximal force, respectively, at 6 months after implantation. Even low-dose irradiation (2 Mrad, 20 kGy) has been shown to diminish the strength and increase the cyclic elongation of BPTB allografts. 46 Balsly and colleagues, 47 however, tested bone grafts (dowel and iliac crest wedge grafts) and soft-tissue grafts (patellar, anterior tibial, and semitendinosus tendons and fascia lata) exposed to low-dose (18.3-21.8 kGy) or moderate-dose (24.0-28.5 kGy) gamma irradiation and found no statistically significant differences in mechanical strength or modulus of elasticity for any graft irradiated at low-dose compared with controls. Bone allografts and 2 of the soft-tissue allografts (anterior tibial and semitendinosus tendons) demonstrated strength and modulus of elasticity values similar to those of controls.",

Grieb and colleagues 53 reported that a radioprotective ''cocktail'' solution, which included propylene glycol, dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO), mannitol, and trehalose, was successful in protecting mechanical properties of human semitendinosus tendon at 50 kGy under regulated conditions. Akkus and colleagues 51 reported that the use of another free radical scavenger, thiourea, resulted in increased toughness at 36 kGy in bone allografts. Seto and colleagues 49 used crosslinkers, including 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl) carbodiimide (EDC) and glucose to add exogenous crosslinks to collagen and compared their effects to those of free radical scavengers (mannitol, ascorbate, and riboflavin) in rabbit tendons. Both treatments protected mechanical properties at 25 kGy, but at 50 kGy crosslinkers were superior. The strength, modulus of elasticity, toughness, and strain of glucose-treated tendon, either gamma or electron-beam irradiated at 25 kGy, were close to those of native tendon. Kattaya and colleagues 54 noted that along with the beneficial effects of radioprotectants there is also the potential of radioprotection of pathogenic organisms and that the ideal radioprotectant should protect graft integrity without compromising sterility.",

This method is not often used for sports medicine procedures in the United States because the process can degrade the mechanical properties of soft-tissue allografts. 3 A disadvantage is the need for a minimum of 30 minutes of rehydration of the graft before use, especially if a bone block is attached to the soft tissue. Freeze-drying alters the material properties of collagen but has not been shown to have a clinical effect. 20 One study 58 noted a significant association between the failure of freeze-dried allografts used for ACL reconstruction and the time from procurement to implantation, suggesting that the shelf life of freeze-dried tissues is limited. Another study 59 found that the ultimate strength of cancellous bone was reduced by 19% and stiffness by 20% in rehydrated lypophilized grafts, suggesting that the mechanical properties of lypophilized BPTB grafts may be inferior to those of fresh-frozen allografts.",

            "text": "Cryopreservation is a process by which the tissue undergoes controlled-rate freezing to \u00c0135 C while cellular water is extracted by glycerol and DMSO. Packed in a cryoprotectant solution, the graft has a shelf life of 10 years, and up to 80% of cells can remain viable. 4, 9, 20 SUMMARY No sterilization techniques have been definitively proven to be more effective than others, and their biomechanical and biological effects on allograft tissue remain largely unknown. Despite recent highly publicized occurrences of infection from allografts, however, the current risk of an allograft infection appears to be much less than the risk of infection surrounding the surgical procedure itself. 5, 9 Most of these incidents involved questionable practices, violations of FDA regulations, and even alleged illegal activities by recovery agents. 13, 15, 24 According to a report from the AATB covering data from 2003 and 2004, of 192 reports of suspected allograft-related infections, 42% involved soft-tissue grafts and 37% involved bone grafts, with an overall incidence of 0.014%; 59% involved orthopedic sports medicine procedures. 9 The American Academy of Orthopaedic Surgeons (AAOS) recommends that surgeons choose tissue provided by an AATB-member tissue bank and that they be familiar with the different sterilization processes used for allografts. 60, 61 With appropriate donor screening, improved donor testing, including NAT, and adherence to AATB standards, the risk of disease transmission or infections can be eliminated or substantially decreased.",
