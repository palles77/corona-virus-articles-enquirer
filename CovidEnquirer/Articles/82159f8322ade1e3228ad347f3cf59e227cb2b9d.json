The remained concern is whether the present system is enough to effectively combat and contain the Ebola outbreak [12] . New technology should be considered and \"combined disease monitoring systems and good policy\" are the important process. Using simulation technique is a new approach that is important for preparedness to the coming of Ebola [13] . The good example is the case of simulation exercise in London [14] . Dynamics and reliability of the simulation model is required and it is the important thing that can determine the success. Since the Ebola infection is still problematic, having a good simulation exercise and practice towards the Ebola infection is very important. A general idea of how the new technology plays role and a consensus on its possible limitation in applicability should be focused. A good research and study of this question could be instructive to practitioner in the simulation community and perhaps to other ones in public health.",

In fact, it is necessary to set a biosecurity system towards the present Ebola outbreak. In fact, the management of present outbreak requires international collaboration and control of cross-border disease transmission is the big challenge[7]. Iwasaki et al. noted that \"countermeasure against viral hemorrhagic fever at the border\" is required and effective \"Quarantine Station\" is the key point for success in disease control[8]. However, there are many facts that should be realized. First, the asymptomatic Ebola infection is possible and this might not be detected[9]. The asymptomatic traveler can be the source of disease transmission. Finally, the focus should not only on the Ebola virus infection immigrated from West Africa but also the disease that might be emigrated from Saudi Arabia. The presently problematic coronavirus infection in Saudi Arabia can also the problem for the traveler from West Africa and the traveler might also carry the disease back to Africa and further cause the problem[5,10,11].",
