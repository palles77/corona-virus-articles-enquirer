It was defined as a rare type of the idiopathic interstitial pneumonia in 2013 [2] . A few studies have reported the characteristics of AFOP in recent years, but the etiology is still not fully understood. AFOP may occur at any age, but usually presents in the elderly people. The clinical presentation of AFOP is nonspecific and often similar to common pneumonia, so it is easily misdiagnosed. The confirmation of AFOP diagnosis depends on pathological biopsy.",

Because the clinical manifestations are nonspecific, the pathogenesis of AFOP is not fully understood. It can be idiopathic or associated with a wide spectrum of clinical conditions, such as connective tissue diseases [4, 6, 7] , bacterial infec tions or viral infections [3, 8] , specific etiologic agent like Chlamydophila pneumoniae [9] , chronic renal insu fficiency [10] , drug reaction or druginduced toxicity [11] , hematologic disease [12, 13] , hematopoietic stem cell transplantation [14] , and occupational or environmental exposures [1] . There is still no standard treatment for AFOP. Therapy with steroids alone or combined with immu nosuppressants was attempted, but the dosage and duration of steroid treatment are still unclear. Usually 0.51 mg/kg daily of prednisone (or equivalent) are prescribed initially. A maximal dose of methy lprednisolone was reported to be up to 1000 mg/d [4] . A pulse therapy of steroids was also administered in some fulminant patients [7, 10, 15, 16] . Besides steroids, immunosuppressive agents such as cyclophosphamide, mycophenolate mofetil, cyclosporine and azathioprine have been tried in AFOP patients complicated with connective tissue diseases [4, 6, 7, 17] . In addition, Zhou et al [18] reported that lowdose indomethacin combined with methylprednisolone was a new choice of treatment. ",

Although AFOP is a rare entity, it should be considered in the differential diagnosis of pulmonary infection unresponsive to optimum antibiotic therapy. On the other hand, AFOP might be under diagnosed and under reported especially in the developing countries due to the complicated means of obtaining a tissue diagnosis which are not routinely performed in the community and secondary hospitals. Our case is distinct. The patient was an 81yearold woman and she had a good response to shortterm steroid treatment. The last followup showed that no relapse occurred during tapering steroids. This case will contribute to a better understanding of the treatment of AFOP in geriatric patients, and provide a new choice of dosage and duration of it. Further more studies are needed to describe various clinical aspects of this rare disease.",
