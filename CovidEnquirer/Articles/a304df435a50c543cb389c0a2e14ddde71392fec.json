Group A rotavirus was detected in 24 (25%) of diarrhoeic lambs using sandwich enzyme linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA) and ribonucleic acid-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis (RNA-PAGE). Statistically no significant relation was found between rotavirus infection and age of the lambs. The prevalence of group A rotavirus was more related to meterological changes than age of the lambs as the number of diarrhoeic lambs with rotavirus infection was found to increase in spring months during which temperature and humidity ranged between 7.34 and 28.9 \u2022 C and 34.28 and 82.58%, respectively. The migration pattern of ovine rotavirus RNA in PAGE was typical of mammalian group A rotaviruses. O25, O26, O30, O43, O75, O76, O102, O113, O132, O153 and O157 E. coli serogroups were isolated from diarrhoeic lambs positive for rotavirus infection while as O157 serogroups of E. coli were isolated from diarrhoeic lambs without rotavirus infection. O8, O21, O43, O82, O104, O113, O120, O127, O132 and O139 serogroups, recovered from diarrhoeic faecal samples with or without rotavirus, were positive for congo red dye binding activity. O88, O113, O157 and O168 serogroups were isolated from non-diarrhoeic faecal samples out of which O88 and O168 were congo red positive. None of the lambs without diarrhoea carried rotavirus infection. Group B rotavirus infection commonly reported in diarrhoeic lambs outside India was not detected in any of the faecal samples screened.",

            "text": "The aetiology of diarrhoeal syndrome is quite complex involving many infectious agents of bacterial, viral and protozoan nature. Among the bacterial and viral agents Escherichia coli and rotavirus are notable one. In general E. coli plays predominant role during first week and rotavirus is more important between 7 and 30 days of age (Lucchelli et al., 1992) However, the precise role of each pathogen in different geographical conditions is not known. Rotavirus was first discovered to be an animal pathogen in 1969 by Mebus et al. (1969) . Since then it has been accepted as an important aetiological agent of diarrhoea in neonates of almost all animal species, humans and even in birds. These viruses are subdivided into seven antigenically distinct groups designated A through G (Estes, 2001) . Most of rotaviruses detected in clinical specimens of domestic animals belong to group A (Theil et al., 1995) . Ovine rotaviruses, in contrast to the globally distributed rotaviruses infecting other livestock, have been reported from few countries like UK, Japan, Morocco, Australia, USA (Chasey and Banks, 1984; Makabe et al., 1985; Fassi-Fehri et al., 1988; Ellis and Daniels, 1988; Theil et al., 1995) . Both groups A and B rotaviruses infect lambs (Snodgrass et al., 1976) but group B rotaviruses have been shown to be more common cause of rotavirus diarrhoea in neonatal lambs (Chasey and Banks, 1984; Snodgrass et al., 1984) . In India, the work on ovine rotavirus infection was initiated in 2000 only (Anon, 2001) . Wani et al. (in press) are first to report the presence of rotavirus in diarrhoeic lambs in India.",

There are meagre reports of isolation of E. coli from diarrhoeic lambs. Cid et al. (2001) isolated attaching and effacing E. coli belonging to serogroups O2, O4, O26, O80 and O91 from diarrhoeic lambs. However, O4, O5, O8, O75, O84, O85, O91, O123, O128, O136, O157 and O166 are the most commonly reported ovine STEC serogroups in healthy sheep all over the world out of which O5, O91, O128 and O157 are implicated in serious diseases of human beings (Djordjevic et al., 2001) . Serogroup O78 was isolated from haemorrhagic gastrointestinal outbreak in sheep in India (Sharma et al., 2003) . The isolation and distribution of various E. coli serogroups has been studied in India in diarrhoeic calves and goats by several workers (Patil et al., 1999; Dubey et al., 2000a,b; Hussain and Saikia, 2000) . But there seems to be no report except from this lab (Wani et al., 2003) available on isolation of E. coli from lambs with diarrhoea in India.",

The ability to bind congo red (CR) dye in agar medium has been proposed as a marker for the invasive ability of several enteropathogens including E. coli (Payne and Finkelstein, 1977; Berkhoff and Vinal, 1986) . Yoder et al. (1989) provided evidence that CR binding might be directly related to virulence. Similarly, Singh and Gupta (1996) reported a good correlation between CR binding and pathogenic potential. Since precise role of each pathogen in diarrhoea in different geographical conditions is not known, the present study was carried out to reveal the first ever epidemiology of rotavirus and E. coli infection in diarrhoeic lambs in Kashmir valley in India.",

The present work was undertaken to investigate some of the epidemiological features of diarrhoea caused by rotavirus and E. coli in lambs in Kashmir, India. Association of rotavirus with lamb diarrhoea was known in India after 2000, only (Anon, 2001; Wani et al., in press ). This is the second report on ovine rotavirus from India. During the investigation 96 diarrhoeic and 33 non-diarrhoeic faecal samples were screened by sandwich ELISA and PAGE. Twenty-four diarrhoeic faecal samples found positive for rotavirus revealed presence of only group A antigen/electropherotype. This is contrary to the findings of other workers (Chasey and Banks, 1984; Snodgrass et al., 1984; Theil et al., 1995) who reported the predominant involvement of group B rotaviruses in lamb diarrhoea in United Kingdom and USA. However, these findings are in agreement with those of Snodgrass et al. (1976) and Munoz et al. (1996) who have also reported group A rotavirus infection in diarrhoeic lambs. Eleven bands of genomic RNA revealed a migration pattern of 4-2-3-2, which is typical of mammalian group A rotaviruses (Saif et al., 1994) . Among the different strains of ovine rotaviruses no difference was observed in migration pattern by PAGE, which indicated their close genetic relatedness. Over all incidence of rotavirus in diarrhoeic lambs was 25%. This corroborated with the observations of Fassi-Fehri et al. (1988) who reported a rotavirus incidence of 30% in lambs in Morocco. Similarly, in a survey of rotavirus in lambs in Scotland, ovine rotavirus was isolated from 22 of the 87 diarrhoeic lambs (25%) and on 13 of 28 farms (46%). Though the agewise distribution revealed more number of cases in 3-month-old lambs but statistically no significant relationship was found between age of lambs and rotavirus infection. To our wisdom rotavirus infection in diarrhoeic lambs was related to meteorological changes as the number of diarrhoeic lambs was found to increase in spring months. These findings are in agreement with those of Theil et al. (1995 Theil et al. ( , 1996 who observed the repeated occurrence of severe outbreaks of neonatal lamb diarrhoea in early spring with high morbidity and mortality in Ohio, USA.",

The pathogenic significance of these serogroups in lamb diarrhoea is to be established as serogrouping of E. coli isolates though useful is not definitive (Barlow et al., 1999) . The information about the isolation of E. coli in sheep is scanty. However, Cid et al. (2001) reported the association of O2, O4, O26, O80 and O91 STEC serogroups with lamb diarrhoea. None of the serogroups, except O26, isolated in the present study belonged to these STEC serogroups. Similarly, O26 serogroup has been detected more frequently in calves with diarrhoea than in healthy cattle suggesting a pathogenic role in neonatal calf diarrhoea (Orden et al., 1998) . Very recently, we have also detected association of E. coli O4:NM serotype with calf diarrhoea (unpublished data). In the present study two strains belonging to O157 serogroup were isolated from lambs with diarrhoea. There seems no report available on isolation of O157 serogroup from lambs with diarrhoea to compare the results. However, Dean-Nystrom et al. (1999) reported O157 serogroup as cause of severe diarrhoea and attaching and effacing mucosal lesions in neonatal calves. Similarly strains belonging to O8, O9, O20 and O101 ETEC serogroups have been found commonly associated with diarrhoea in calves less than 1 week of age and could be a problem in calves as old as 2-3 weeks (Acres, 1985; Holland, 1990 ). In the present study O8 and O20 serogroups were isolated from diarrhoeic lambs. During the present investigation O88, O113, O157 and O168 serogroups were isolated from healthy lambs. Except O157 serogroup none of the serogroups isolated belonged to the most commonly reported ovine STEC serogroups in healthy sheep all over the world (Djordjevic et al., 2001) . Similarly, Chapman et al. (2001) reported isolation of E. coli O157 from 7.4% of healthy sheep and 0.7% of lamb carcasses in UK and most of the strains were verocytotoxigenic. Diarrhoeic faecal samples negative for rotavirus and E. coli suggested that diarrhoea in these lambs might be due to other enteropathogens (salmonella, campylobacter, protozoa, coronavirus, etc.) .",

These findings are contrary to those of Berkhoff and Vinal (1986) who reported a strong correlation between the expression of CR phenotype and virulence of E. coli. However, our findings correlate with those of Gowda et al. (1999) who also did not find association between the expression of CR phenotype and virulence of E. coli.
