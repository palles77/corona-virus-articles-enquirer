            "text": "We investigated the nucleotide composition of the RNA genome of the six human coronaviruses. Some general coronavirus characteristics were apparent (e.g. high U, low C count), but we also detected speciesspecific signatures. Most strikingly, the high U and low C proportions are quite variable and act like communicating vessels, C goes down when U goes up and vice versa. U ranges among virus isolates from 30.7% to 40.3%, and C makes the opposite movement from 20.0% to 12.9%, respectively. The nucleotide biases are more pronounced in the unpaired regions of the structured RNA genome, which may suggest a certain biological function for these distinctive sequence signatures. Coronaviruses have an atypical codon usage that has been linked to mutational events operating on the viral RNA genome on an evolutionary time scale. We suggest that the atypical nucleotide bias may serve a distinct biological function and that it is the direct cause of the characteristic codon usage in these viruses. The relevance for evolution of the novel human pathogens MERS and SARS is discussed.",

            "text": "Coronaviruses are positive sense, single-stranded RNA viruses that infect a wide range of animals. The coronaviridae can cause a spectrum of diseases, ranging from respiratory, enteric, hepatic and neurological diseases of varying severity. Two human coronaviruses that cause relatively mild respiratory symptoms are known since the 1960s: HCoV-229E and HCoV-OC43. SARS-CoV was identified in 2003 and causes a more severe respiratory syndrome (Fouchier et al., 2003) . The fourth member of the coronaviridae family that was identified in 2004 to cause respiratory symptoms in humans is HCoV-NL63 (van der Hoek et al., 2004) . The fifth member HCoV-HKU was described the next year (Woo et al., 2005) . More recently, the pathogenic MERS coronavirus was identified in the Middle East as the sixth human coronavirus (Zaki et al., 2012) . Both SARS and MERS represent recent zoonotic transfers into the human population. The full-length sequences of the RNA genomes of all these human coronaviruses have been analyzed to some extent (van Boheemen et al., 2012; Woo et al., 2007; Pyrc et al., 2004 Pyrc et al., , 2007 Marra et al., 2003) . The coronavirus RNA genome is around 30 kb and thereby the largest among the profoundly diverse group of RNA viruses. In global terms, a similar genome organization is apparent for all coronaviruses and a similar set of proteins is encoded. Besides encoding for viral proteins, the viral RNA genome usually contains multiple molecular signals, either RNA sequence elements or secondary and higher order RNA structures that interact with viral or cellular components -proteins or RNAs -to facilitate certain steps of the viral replication cycle. This is also true for the coronaviridae, which for instance encode the Transcription Regulation Sequence (TRS) that is involved in the induction of a discontinuous transcription mechanism to generate subgenomic mRNAs that encode the different viral proteins. In this study, we want to focus on a more basic property of the coronavirus RNA genomes: their biased nucleotide composition.",

Grigoriev performed a cumulative skew analysis to analyze mutational patterns and reported an excess of G compared with C, suggestive of excessive C-to-U deamination among the coronaviruses, but significantly less for SARS (Grigoriev, 2004) . A subsequent analysis based on the NL63 genome indicated a very low C count and a high U count . Both studies reported a clear difference in the magnitude of the nucleotide bias between the first two-third and last one-third of the coronavirus genome, which likely relates to the mechanism of subgenomic mRNA synthesis and exposure of single-stranded http://dx.doi.org/10.1016/j.virusres.2014.11.031 0168-1702/\u00a9 2015 Elsevier B.V.

First, the MERS coronavirus as novel human pathogen follows some general coronavirus trends, but is also characterized by some unique and rather extreme features of nucleotide usage. Second, we can present a simple, but striking classification of the human coronaviruses based on their nucleotide composition. Coronaviral RNA genomes have a rather stable G and A count, but vary significantly in the U and C distribution, with as two extremes MERS (32.5% U, 20.3% C) and HKU (40.3% U, 12.9% C). Third, we performed for the first time a nucleotide usage analysis in the context of the structured coronavirus RNA genomes. All this information provides new mechanistic insight. Specifically, some of the previously proposed mutational scenario's (e.g. CpG discrimination) become less likely and we propose alternatives for the C deamination scenario that involves a cellular cytosine deaminase enzyme. Specifically, the differential U versus C bias among the human coronaviridae may suggest a mutational property of the diverse viral polymerases. Alternatively, the specific nucleotide composition of the viral RNA genomes may have been selected to execute a certain biological function. Finally, this new insight also strongly influences the way we should look at the atypical codons used by these viruses.",

MFold (Zuker and Turner, 1999) was used with default settings for RNA secondary structure prediction. The single-stranded or ss-count file of an MFold output supplied the number of folded structures (50 maximally), including a frequency value for each individual nucleotide of being unpaired in this collection of structures. We scored a nucleotide as unpaired (single-stranded, \"ss\") if half or more than half of the structure models reported its position as \"ss\". Nucleotides with a ss-count value below this criterion were scored as being paired (double-stranded, \"ds\"). Discrimination between ss and ds nucleotides was performed in Excel and fasta files were created in order to determine the composition of ss and ds nucleotides, separately, by means of MEGAv5 (Tamura et al., 2011) .",

The first relates to the pyrimidines: the U-count is above average and the C-count is below average. The second rule applies to the purines and is less prominent, but A is preferred over G. There are also species-specific trends. In particular, the C/U ratio differs profoundly per coronavirus type, and these nucleotides seem to behave as communicating vessels. To illustrate that C and U seem to be competing for sequence space, we plotted the nucleotide composition per coronavirus (color coded) in Fig. 1 . This picture also nicely illustrates that most variation occurs in the C/U and not the A/G section. The A/G ratio is rather stable among different coronaviruses, with minor fluctuations in the Acount (ranging from 26.2% for MERS to 28.5% for SARS) and the G-count (ranging from 19.0% for HKU-1A to 21.7% for OC43).

We performed an analysis of the effective number of codons (ENC) used by the two extreme genomes of MERS and HKU. We compared the G and C content of the synonymous third codon positions (GC3) in the coronavirus gene 1 (ORF1, occupying the first two-third of the viral genome) vs the S and N genes in the last one-third, thus downstream of the observed shift/switch in the skew analysis (Fig. 4) . The 3 -located S and N genes do not behave significantly different from the 5 -located gene 1. The three genes cluster together for each coronavirus species, but HKU is more extreme than MERS toward low GC3 values, as expected. The codons do not deviate much from the bell-shaped line that represents ENC values of random codon usage expected for a given GC3 composition. The characteristic distinction between MERS and HKU is the difference of GC content at the 3rd synonymous codon position.

There is variation among coronaviruses due to the magnitude of the U/C-bias: MERS is least extreme and HKU most extreme. All other human coronaviruses occupy in between spots in the CG3 plot (not shown), consistent with their intermediate nucleotide count. These relationships hold perfectly for the longest ORF1. A few exceptions were apparent for the much smaller and thus less reliable ORFs encoding the S protein (229E a bit more extreme than MERS) and the N protein (SARS and OC43 more extreme than MERS). Most importantly, all coronavirus genes are positioned rather close to the bell-shaped curve, which indicates the absence of selection of certain \"preferred\" codons, and relatively far away from the GC3 values of any of the candidate host species.

We generated a detailed survey of the codons used in the largest ORF1 in HKU vs MERS (Supplementary  Table S1 ) and calculated the nt-count per codon position (Supplementary Table S2 ). Indeed, the first general coronavirus rule about pyrimidines (U up, C down) dictates codon usage in all codon groups and at the three codon positions without any exceptions. This rule holds for the broad collection of human and animal coronaviruses that were analyzed by Woo et al. (2007) , and among the human coronaviruses the effect ranges from MERS (most modest) to HKU (most extreme). This rule is perhaps most dramatically visualized for the 2-codon groups where the choice is C or U. Phenylalanine is encoded by UUU or UUC, but a 0.94/0.06 = 15.7-fold bias for U is present in HKU, contrasting with a modest 1.7-fold bias in MERS. All other coronaviruses take an intermediate position. Another example is provided by the 4-codon groups. Valine is encoded by the four codons GUN, which are used with profound different frequencies in HKU: 0.68 GUU, 0.05 GUC, 0.20 GUA and 0.06 GUG, thus yielding a 13.6-fold bias for U over C, but a much more modest 2.2-fold bias in MERS. Also, the coronaviral rule (U up, C down) is more prominent in HKU than in MERS and hence, different proportions of ORF1 encoded amino acids with the C-nucleotide at the 2nd codon position can be expected (Supplementary Table S2 The second general coronavirus rule about purines (A over G) is also well supported, but with less dramatic numbers. For A/G choices, A always wins in the coronaviruses. For instance, lysine is encoded by AAA or AAG that are used in quite different fraction of codons (0.68 vs 0.32) in HKU, yielding a 2.1-fold bias of A over G. More neutral values are apparent for MERS (1.1-fold bias of G over A). Very similar values are observed for A/G choices.

Two general coronavirus rules are apparent that relate to the usage of pyrimidines (C over U) and purines (A over G). The A/G bias is a relatively stable property among the coronaviruses. In contrast, the C/U bias differs significantly per virus type and we scored U-counts from 30.7% (SARS) to 40.3% (HKU) and C-counts from 20.3% (MERS) to 12.9% (HKU). The C-and U-counts behave as communicating vessels. Although this study was restricted to the human coronaviruses, these basic properties apply to all known animal and human coronas (results not shown). A quick survey revealed a new record number for the Bat-SARS-CoV with 30.5% U (Woo et al., 2007) . Perhaps surprisingly, we think that these basic nucleotide trends have not been reported previously. Although they may seem useless numbers for some, we think that these basic properties can encode important biological functions and one may start wondering about the evolutionary history of these sometimes striking nucleotide features. The biased nucleotide composition can also have a major influence on derived parameters. For instance, our analysis clearly suggests that the nucleotide composition largely dictates the codons that are used by these viruses for the translation of the RNA genome and sub-genomic mRNAs.",

            "text": "Previous studies on codon usage in different viruses have highlighted mutational pressure as the major factor in shaping codon usage patterns compared with natural selection (Gu et al., 2004; Jenkins and Holmes, 2003a; Wang et al., 2011; Wong et al., 2010; Woo et al., 2007; Gu et al., 2004) . For coronaviruses, cytosine deamination and the selection against CpG motifs have been proposed as the mutational forces that shaped the viral genome and its codons (Grigoriev, 2004; Woo et al., 2007; Pyrc et al., 2004) . However, as our understanding of codon usage increases, it appears that although mutational pressure is still a major driving force, it is certainly not the only force when considering different types of RNA and DNA viruses (Berkhout and van Hemert, 1994; van Hemert and Berkhout, 1995; Chen, 2013; Shi et al., 2013; Zhang et al., 2013) . For HIV-1 with its A-rich RNA genome, we initially proposed two evolutionary scenarios. Mutations could be introduced on an evolutionary time scale by the error-prone reverse transcriptase or cellular enzymes like Apobec, but we also stressed that these atypical RNA molecules may have been selected to exert a certain biological function. For instance, the distinctive nucleotide composition influences the overall folding of the RNA molecule and may thus affect specific replication steps like packaging of the RNA genome in virion particles. The genome composition may also relate to the intensive virus-host interaction, e.g. by avoiding recognition by the innate immune system. For HIV-1 with its extremely A-rich genome it was recently proposed that this property helps to avoid recognition by the innate immune system (Vabret et al., 2012) , which could provide strong selective pressure on retroviruses and many RNA viruses including coronaviruses (van der Kuyl and Berkhout, 2012; Van Hemert et al., 2014; Kindler and Thiel, 2014) . There could also be a more passive function for the biased genome composition. For HIV-1, A-rich sequences may restrict the number of sites that can be mutated and inactivated by the cellular Apobec restriction factor. For coronaviruses, the C-rich genome may highlight some important replication signals such as the A-rich TRS element (e.g. AACUAAA in NL63 ) that is positioned at several locations within the coronaviral genome.",

The nucleotide trends are certainly not restricted to the coding regions of these genomes as they are also apparent in the non-coding 5 UTR, indicating that these signatures are not invented to create a certain codon bias and that the effect is executed at the level of translation, but rather that it serves another biological purpose. In fact, this nucleotide bias also directly influences many other parameters such as the dinucleotide composition and possibly even the amino acid composition of the encoded viral proteins (Berkhout and van Hemert, 1994) . We previously indicated that serious nucleotide skews may even trigger phylogenetic artifacts: viruses with a similar nucleotide preference tend to cluster, but are not necessarily related by descent (van Hemert and Berkhout, 1995) . We also cannot formally exclude that the bias operates at the level of the genomic minus-strand RNA, which obviously has the opposite characteristics (C over U becomes G over A).",

Although the two serious pathogens SARS and MERS are present on one side of the C/U spectrum with a relatively low U-count and high C-count, it seems dangerous to propose a correlation between the nucleotide signature and pathogenicity as this may just be a coincidence. Most viral nucleotide/codon characteristics appear not to depend on the host organism as we observed similar properties for murine, avian, bat and human coronaviruses (results not shown). The codon analysis presented in Fig. 4 also clearly indicates that there is no virus adaptation to the host, at least in this respect. One evolutionary scenario that links nucleotide usage to pathogenicity remains possible. The new coronaviruses that arrived in humans via zoonotic transfer are pathogenic (MERS, SARS). The ones that are circulating in humans for a much longer period may have adapted to become less pathogenic. This idea is similar to a natural attenuation scenario that has been proposed for other viruses like myxoma virus in a new Australian epidemic among the introduced European rabbits ( Kerr et al., 2012) . It is beneficial for the virus not to kill the host too quickly as this increases the chance of viral spread. We may see this adaptation as a gradual increase of U and decrease of C, which may attenuate viral gene expression (e.g. sub-optimal codon usage, visible as gradual deviation from the ENC curve, or by another mechanism: e.g. reduced RNA packaging capacity or increased recognition by the innate immune system). This hypothesis predicts that MERS and SARS will evolve to become more U-rich and C-poor in humans, but that obviously requires the viral presence in the human population over evolutionary times.",
