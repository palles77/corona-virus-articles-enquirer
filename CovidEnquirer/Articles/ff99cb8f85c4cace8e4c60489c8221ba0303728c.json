Cytokines play a critical role in the modulation of immune and inflammatory events, important in both anti-viral immunity, and the virus induced pathology observed in the CNS. Endothelial cells and astrocytes in the CNS are potential sources of cytokines and have been demonstrated to synthesize interleukin-6 (IL-6) in response to treatment with tumor necrosis factor (TNF), interleukin-1 (IL-1) and lipopolysaccharide (Frei et al., 1989; Jirik et al., 1989; Lieberman et al., 1989; Shalaby et al., 1989; Sironi et al., 1989; Beneveniste et al., 1990) . Endothelial ceils and astrocytes in the CNS are also readily infected by MHV-4 and the products released by these cells may be important in regulating immune mediated events in the CNS (Joseph et al., 1989 (Joseph et al., , 1990 (Joseph et al., , 1991 .",

            "text": "The results obtained with UV-MHV-4 suggest that infection is not required and that the binding of the viral particles to its receptor on the cell surface may be sufficient to trigger the release of IL-6. This ability of UV-MHV-4 to exert a biological effect is not unique to the induction of II-6. Previous studies in our laboratory have demonstrated that UV-MHV-4 can block y-interferon induced MHC class II antigen expression on endothelial cells to the same degree as infectious virus (Joseph et al., 1991) .",

Since the MHV-4 replication in BALB/c mouse brain is two to three logs greater than in SJL mice (Knobler et al., 1982) , and there is a correspondingly greater inflammatory response to MHV-4 infection in BALB/c than SJL mice, this observation deserves further investigation. Current studies are directed at elucidating these mechanisms.",
