The IFITM3 alanine scan (AS) mutants, 109AS, 115AS, and 121AS, spanning IM2 each contain six sequential residues changed to alanine and were expressed using the pQCXIP vector as previously described (John et al., 2013) ; however, we note that 115AS was previously reported by us to be unable to be expressed (John et al., 2013) , however a more concerted effort in this current work was able to produce a cell line stably expressing the 115AS protein. Human RAB7 was cloned in frame with RFP and expressed from the lentiviral vector pLVX-puromycin Pseudoparticles were produced using the noted envelopes as previously described (Brass et al., 2009; Feeley et al., 2011; Huang et al., 2011) Small ",

IFITM3 chimeras were constructed as follows: IFITM3's N-terminal domain (NTD, amino acids 1-50) was fused in frame with IFITM1's amino acids 29-245 to generate M3M1. The NTD of IFITM1, amino acids 1-28, was fused to IFITM3, amino acids 51-119, to produce M1M3(John et al., 2013). Human CAV1 was subcloned into the XbaI and BamHI sites of the pLVXpuromycin vector in frame with a C-terminal teal fluorescence protein (TFP), and the coding sequence was confirmed as correct. For construction of pQCXIP-VAPA the transcript variant two of human VAPA (NM_194434.2) cDNA (kind gift of Dr. Jae Jung, UCLA Medical School) was amplified by PCR and cloned into the retroviral expression vector pQCXIP (Clontech) and the coding sequence was confirmed as correct. pQCXIP-VAPA and all other listed retroviral constructs were packaged into viruses using standard techniques and used to stably transduce the indicated cells(Brass et al., 2009).Cell lines: A549, MDCK, COS-7 and H1 HeLa cells (ATCC) were stably transduced with the indicated plasmids then selected for puromycin resistance (Clontech). All cells were cultured in DMEM (Invitrogen) with 10% FBS (Invitrogen). MEFs were derived, genotyped and cultured as described previously(Everitt et al., 2012). Human WT fibroblasts (GM05659, passage 10) and Neiman-Pick Type c1 fibroblasts (GM03123, passage 11) were from Coriell Institute.Virus propagation and infection: IAVA/WSN/33 (WSN/33, H1N1 a kind gift of Dr. Peter Palese, Mount Sinai School of Medicine, NY), A/California/7/2009 (H1N1, pH1N1, a kind gift of J.

IAV-infected cells were fixed 12h post infection using 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA, Sigma) in Dulbecco's PBS (D-PBS, Invitrogen). IAV-infected cells were immunostained for HA expression using either an anti-HA monoclonal (WSN/3 and PR8, Wistar Institute, (Feeley et al., 2011)) or anti-NP antibodies (Millipore clone H16-L10-4R5 anti-influenza A virus antibody). IAVinfected cells were then immunostained with a secondary antibody, goat anti-mouse conjugated with Alexaflour-488 at 1:1000 (Invitrogen) in D-PBS with 1% BSA. Host cell DNA was stained with Hoescht 33342 (Sigma) in D-PBS (1:10,000).

The AmphoB derivative, DS-AmpB-020 (David Sarlah and Erick Carreira), was dissolved in 70% ethanol and then serially diluted to achieve the concentrations indicated in the figures. Lovastatin (Mevilonin, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in DMSO and diluted to 8 M using complete growth media. Methyl-beta-cyclodextrin (M CD, Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in sterile water and diluted to 1mM with complete growth media. Cholesterol (Sigma-Aldrich) was dissolved in 70% ethanol. Water-soluble cholesterol was generated by vortexing 40 C M CD and 40 C cholesterol to form a M CD and cholesterol solution. For AmphoB,AmBisome and oleic acid experiments, cells were incubated in either buffer (containing DMSO as needed to match), 1 mM AmphoB, 2 M AmphoB, or 3mM oleic acid (Sigma-Aldrich) at a 37\u00b0C for 1hr; then the cells were washed with fresh cold complete media before performing fusion assay as described below.Immunoblotting: Whole-cell lysates were prepared using Laemmeli buffer and resolved by SDS/PAGE.

This license was reviewed by The Wellcome Trust Sanger Institute Ethical Review Committee. Groups of >5 isofluoraneanaesthetized mice of both genotype were intranasally inoculated with 10 4 plaque forming units of A/X-31 influenza in 50 \u03bcl of sterile PBS (Everitt et al., 2012). On days 0, 2 and 4 the AmBisome treated mice (wild-type or matched Ifitm3 -/-) were administered 3 mg/kg of AmBisome (Gilead) intravenously. Their weight was recorded daily and they were monitored for signs of illness. Mice exceeding 25% total weight loss were killed in accordance with UK Home Office guidelines. Littermate controls were used in all experiments. Immunofluorescence staining, antibodies, and confocal microscopy: Cells on glass coverslips were fixed in 4% PFA for 10 min at room temperature, followed by incubation with 0.25% Tween 20 (Sigma) in PBS for 20 min, and then 1% BSA with 0.3M glycine (Sigma) in PBS for 30 min. After blocking with BSA, cells were probed with primary antibodies for 60 min, washed with PBS three times, and incubated with secondary antibodies for 60 min.
