Randomization compliance, safety, follow-up rates, primary outcome, and sample size requirements were assessed. Results: Of 383 patients with unstable bradycardia, 151 (39%) failed to respond to atropine or fluid and were eligible for enrolment and 82 (55%) were correctly enrolled. Fifty-five (36%) of eligible patients could not be enrolled for practical reasons; 3 had advance directives, 32 met inclusion criteria on arrival at hospital and in 20 cases, paramedics chose not to enroll based on the circumstances of the case. The remaining 13 were missed cases; 8 were missing randomization envelopes and in 5, the paramedic forgot. Randomization compliance was 95% (78/82). Forty-two (51%) patients were randomized to TCP and seven of these crossed over to dopamine. Two cases were randomized but did not receive the intervention; either due to lack of time or loss of IV access. Three adverse events occurred in each group. Survival to discharge or 30 days in hospital was 70% (28/40) and 69% (29/42) in the dopamine and TCP groups, respectively with 100% follow up. To detect a 10% relative difference in 30 days survival between treatment arms, a sample size of 690 per group would be required. Conclusions: It is feasible to conduct a prehospital randomized controlled trial of TCP for unstable bradycardia and a definitive trial would require a multi-centre study.",

[1] [2] [3] Dopamine is the conventional treatment for hemodynamically unstable bradycardia in advanced life support EMS systems. Inhospital options for treatment include transcutaneous cardiac pacing (TCP); a non-invasive means of temporarily pacing the heart. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] A systematic review of the prehospital literature suggested there was inadequate evidence to determine the efficacy of TCP in this setting. 4 Despite the lack of evidence in the prehospital and emergency setting, the 2005 International Liaison Council of Resuscitation consensus document 12 recommends the use of TCP for hemodynamically unstable bradycardia. Moreover, TCP capable defibrillators are currently approved for use in Canada and the United States and some EMS systems have adopted TCP as a standard of care.",

A meta analysis was not possible given the differences in study design. 4 A randomized controlled trial (RCT) designed to ascertain TCP effectiveness for hemodynamically unstable bradycardia in comparison to dopamine in the prehospital setting is probably justified; however, operational constraints in the prehospital setting can be challenging and often there are unanticipated logistical issues which may compromise the rigour of a randomized controlled trial.

In practice it might not be possible to supply or keep ambulances stocked according to a predefined randomization schedule. Paramedics might find the study intervention too time-consuming to administer, or may lack confidence in it. Given the chaotic nature of the prehospital setting, even if paramedics are willing and able to randomize patients, allocation may not be distributed equally across the control and treatment groups. While TCP appears to be safe in the hospital environment, 9, 13, 14 it might be less safe or less dependable in the field. Moreover, collecting reliable and valid data in this situation may be difficult. And finally, conducting the study with a waiver of consent is challenging in the US setting. A feasibility trial plays an important role before a main trial in revealing barriers and evaluating protocol design and providing justification for a larger study. 15 The goal of this investigation was to evaluate the feasibility of an RCT of TCP in comparison with dopamine for hemodynamically unstable bradycardic patients in the prehospital setting in Toronto. The specific objectives were (1) to identify the logistical issues related to implementation of the protocol, (2) to evaluate the randomization implementation strategy, (3) to measure TCP safety and dependability, (4) to evaluate follow up strategies, (5) to evaluate the definition and ease of collection of the primary outcome, and (6) to define the sample size required for the definitive trial.",

We were also able to estimate a sample size for the main trial. In our large urban system serving 2.5 million people there were 383 unstable bradycardic patients treated over 2 years. Of these, 61% responded to fluid and atropine either alone or in combination. Only 39% met the inclusion criteria and of these only 98 or (65%) were able to receive TCP for practical reasons in the field for a variety of reasons not captured in the inclusion criteria. Hence a large multi-centre randomized controlled trial will be required to ascertain TCP effectiveness compared with dopamine in the prehospital setting and the inclusion criteria will need to be adjusted accordingly to reflect the target population most likely to receive the treatment. Randomization was executed successfully with 86% of eligible cases enrolled and the follow-up rate was 100%. TCP was found to be relatively safe and adverse events were limited to chest discomfort, which is similar to what has been seen in other clinical studies. 3, [9] [10] [11] 13, 14, 22 The observed TCP mechanical capture rates of 88% are higher than previously reported rates of 19% in a controlled trial 3 and 86% in a case series. 10 The field logistics coordinator played an important role in stocking randomization envelopes and checking vehicles for research-related supplies once a month. Even so, eight eligible cases were missed because a randomization envelope was not available. More diligent monitoring at the vehicle level (i.e., daily and random checks by the field logistics coordinator) would require 4 coordinators in a system this large. Daily tracking by the paramedics employing the same system used to track narcotics at the start of each shift may improve envelope availability in a subsequent study. Although we did not track the sequence of randomization throughout the trial, treatment assignment was approximately 50-50, suggesting that the block randomization strategy was successful. Tracking envelope use would provide timely feedback on logistical issues as well as paramedic deviation from the randomization schedule.",

The greatest practical impediment to enrollment of eligible patients was time; by the time the patient failed to respond to atropine and met the inclusion criteria, they had arrived at the receiving hospital and there was insufficient time to enroll them into the trial. Eligible patients who were not enrolled were more likely than enrolled patients to present with a SBP between 80 mmHg and 100 mmHg with other signs and symptoms (change in GCS, chest pain, or crackles). As a result, there was insufficient time to enroll most of these patients as they required additional treatment by more than one medical directive. We did not consider these patients missed patients as the natural course of the illness precluded their receiving TCP or dopamine prior to arrival at hospital. It was within a paramedic's scope of practice to choose to treat with a medical directive prior to the research protocol if the treatment was felt to be more urgent than the treatment of the bradyarrhythmia. More importantly it is likely the paramedics would not apply TCP to any of these eligible patients practically in the field for the same reasons that they did not enroll them in the trial. The inclusion criteria should be adjusted to include only patients who meet eligibility prior to transporting the patient to the ambulance as there would be sufficient time to address other medical concerns and offer treatment for the bradyarrhythmia.",

The emergence of SARS in Toronto from February to July 2003 is the likely explanation. The overall number of emergency calls declined during SARS for reasons that are poorly understood (personal communication, Alan Craig, Director, Toronto EMS, January 2005). Since the initial SARS case was treated and transported by paramedics, which resulted in the subsequent exposure of patients, receiving hospitals and other paramedics to the SARS virus, Toronto residents may have been reluctant to call 911 during this period of the study. Despite this decline, it appears that enrollment continued, suggesting that paramedic commitment to the study endured through challenging conditions. A significant number (15/21, or 71%) of conscious TCP patients experienced chest discomfort during pacing. It may be worthwhile increasing the initial and incremental dosage of midazolam, or adding an analgesic to address this side effect in the TCP arm.",

However, patients with a short length of stay before discharge were grouped with those with much longer stays; moreover, we were unable to determine whether they were subsequently readmitted to another institution. For the main trial, we recommend that survival to 30 days be used as the primary outcome, regardless of discharge status. This could be collected by direct telephone contact with the patient or the patient's next of kin and this planned contact could be outlined in the information letter with an option to withdraw from follow up. Where consent is required based on ethical guidelines and ethics board approval, consent for follow up could be obtained during the hospital stay. The cost of the trial would increase with in-hospital consent, particularly in sites with a large number of receiving hospitals, and it may be more challenging to acquire in patients who are discharged rapidly.",

In particular, the pre/post study intervention vital signs were difficult to collect, not so much because of case report form (CRF) design, but rather a lack of accompanying date/time stamp information on the source documents. Understandably, conditions in the field are not conducive to meticulous record keeping. There is often a delay between the time when paramedics attend to their patients and when they have a chance to complete the paperwork. On occasion paramedics are required to respond to another call before paperwork has been completed, thereby adding further to the delay. Nonetheless, rigorous abstraction rules can be used to at least make the abstraction process reliable and valid. 23 The attending paramedics can be contacted for clarification and, based on our experience, are keen to help. The accuracy of data collection was augmented by a study-specific data checklist that captured the important variables and all source documents were subject to review by a central validation committee. It is recommended that future feasibility trials include reliability and validity coefficients as standard feasibility trial outcomes.",

Though the study period covered 2002 and 2003, we used 2002 data alone to estimate sample size based on the primary outcome because emergency transports and study enrolment in 2003 were affected by a drop in EMS utilization during the SARS crisis. Approximately 161,000 emergency transports occurred during the calendar year 2002 21 and of these there were 224 possible incidences of out-of-hospital hemodynamically unstable bradycardia. Up to 95 (42%) failed to respond to atropine with or without fluids or fluids alone and of these 51 (54%) were enrolled. Based on the 2002 subset, 17 out of 26 (65%) patients randomly assigned to the dopamine arm, survived to hospital discharge or to 30 days in hospital. Employing a relative difference of 10% between the treatment groups (a survival rate in the TCP group of 65% \u00d7 1.10 = 72%), a sample size of approximately 1380 cases (690 patients per treatment arm) would be required (two-sample proportion,\u2423 = 0.05,\u02c7= 0.20, Ha: dopamine proportion \u223c TCP proportion, NCSS Trial and Pass 2002).",
