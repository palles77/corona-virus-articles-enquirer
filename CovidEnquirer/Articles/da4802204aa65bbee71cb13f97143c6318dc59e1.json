            "text": "Distinct from these examples of primed transcription are intermolecular ligations in which the 5' intron donor site in one RNA interacts with the 3' intron acceptor site in a separate RNA. The term trans splicing has been used to describe those intermolecular events. Trans-splicing reactions can readily occur in vitro. The efficiency of in vitro trans splicing increases if the two interacting RNAs share complementary regions within their respective intervening sequences (Solnick, 1985; Konarska et al., 1985) . There is now substantial evidence that Vans splicing also occurs in vivo. Trypanosome mRNAs have a 35 nucleotide 5' leader sequence encoded by a tandemly repeated mini-exon ( Van der Ploeg et al., 1982; De Lange et al., 1983 Nelson et al., 1983; Guyaux et al., 1985) . A 137 nucleotide mini-exon RNA is transcribed that contains, at its 5' end, the 35 nucleotide common leader sequence flanked by a 5' intron donor site sequence (Campbell et al., 1984; Kooter et al., 1984; Milhausen et al., 1984) . Trypanosome message maturation involves the acquisition of the leader by a trans-splicing reaction analogous to typical eukaryotic intron excision in which donor and acceptor consensus sequences are utilized (Murphy et al., 1986; Sutton and Boothroyd, 1986 ). In addition, it has recently been observed that the chloroplast ribosomal protein S12 is synthesized from message that apparently forms by trans splicing (Koller et al., 1987) .",

The nematode has four actin genes; genes 1, 2, and 3 are tightly clustered on chromosome V, and gene 4 is on the X chromosome (Files et al., 1983; Landel et al., 1984; Albertson, 1985;  for review, see Krause and Hirsh, 1986) (Figure 1 ). The DNA sequences of the four nematode actin genes are highly conserved within the coding regions. Actin genes 1 and 3 are identical, and the worst homology by pairwise nucleotide sequence comparisons of genes is 92%. The transcriptional start sites for these genes have been studied; the start site for the X-linked actin gene transcript was clear (at approximately position -43 relative to the first AUG), but the data for the clustered genes led to ambiguous start sites (Wild, Krause, Rosenzweig, and Hirsh, submitted) . Part of the reason for the ambiguity was a 19 nucleotide discrepancy in the length of the 5' untranslated regions of genes 1 and 3, depending on the method of determination.",

These positions are consistent with the transcriptional start sites for gene 4 as determined by Sl mapping (Wild, Krause, Rosenzweig, and Hirsh, submitted) . However, within the 5' untranslated region of gene 4, in a region covered by the Act 4.1 primer, is a potential 3' intron acceptor sequence (TTTCAG; Figure 3 ). If this site is functional, the Act 4.1 primer could conceivably generate an intron sequence terminating at position -43 by using a gene 4 mRNA-processing intermediate as template. The other two primers for actin gene 4, Act 4.2 and 4.3, are downstream of the potential intron acceptor site and can be used to address the question of the possible presence of an intron. However, Act 4.2 cross-anneals to actin gene l/3 mRNA, resulting in superimposed sequences. By subtracting the gene 113 mRNA sequence, we are left with a vague sequence apparently complementary to the gene 4 genomic sequence back to positions -42 and -45. In addition, there is a novel sequence from position -46 to about -100 that does not correlate with genomic sequences upstream of either gene 4 or gene 113. An actin mRNA transcriptional start site of -100 is not seen when an actin coding region primer is extended (Wild, Krause, Rosenzweig, and Hirsh, submitted) . Our interpretation of the Act 4.2 reactions is that the novel sequence results from cross-annealing of the primer to another abundant RNA, resulting in a triple sequence from positions -1 to -45 and a single sequence from -46 to -60. The triple sequence therefore results from actin gene 113 RNA, actin gene 4 RNA, and an unidentified RNA. The result using the Act 4.3 primer is, again, contiguous genomic sequence to positions -42 to -45. These results demonstrate that the potential 3' intron acceptor site does not mark an intron and that the majority of gene 4 mRNA does not acquire the 22 nucleotide leader sequence.",

The 22 nucleotide leader sequence and 5s rRNA gene can be separated on BamHI-Pvul restriction fragments of 285 bp and 695 bp, respectively (Figure 4) .

In addition to a band comigrating with the actin mRNAs, the poly(A)+ RNA lane has five to seven prominent, nonactin bands of hybridization along with a background smear. The smear of hybridization may result from additional, less abundant RNAs containing the leader, degradation of the abundant messages, or nonspecific hybridization. The actin leader could be acquired by one of three mechanisms: primed transcription, cis splicing, or frans splicing. The 5' end of the 100 nucleotide leader RNA comprises the 22 nucleotide actin leader sequence adjacent to a consensus 5' intron donor site ( Figure 5 ). Although no 3' intron acceptor site is present within the leader transcript, an acceptor site is present upstream of the three actin genes encoding messages that acquire the 5' leader. The presence of unpaired intron splice sites within the leader RNA and actin genes suggests leader acquisition by a splicing mechanism rather than priming by the leader sequence alone.",

However, the two gene clusters map to different positions on the chromosome. It is known that a small number of 5S ribosomal repeats (and presumably leader RNA repeats) are not associated with the mapped cluster (Nelson and Honda, 1985) . By Southern blot analysis we have found no copies of the leader RNA in the 15 kb region of the genome containing the actin gene cluster. Thus, given the enormous distances that would be involved, we do not think that conventional transcription followed by cis splicing could account for our results.",

The absence of the leader sequence on the uric-54 myosin mRNA also indicates that the leader does not mark all muscle-specific messages. Regardless of the function or origin of the actin mRNA leader sequence, the apparent utilization of Pans splicing in the nematode raises the possibility that the machinery for trans splicing is widespread in eukaryotes. Transspliced leader sequences could provide a means to affect the stability, location, transport, and translational efficiency of a heterogeneous population of mRNAs and might therefore be a regulatory mechanism in gene expression.",

Small RNAs were separated on 5% polyacrylamide-urea (7.8 M) gels and transferred to GeneScreen by electroblotting for 2.5 hr at 30 volts in 0.25x TBE (lx TBE: 100 mM Tris, pH 6.5: 89 mM Boric acid; 89 mM EDTA). Oligonucleotide probes were kinased with T4 kinase (New England Biolabs) by standard procedures and hybridized to filters in 50 mM Tris, pH 6.5; 1 M NaCI; 1 mM EDTA; 10 mM PO1, 6.5; 0.1% SDS; 10x Denhardfs; and 200 &ml sheared salmon sperm DNA. Hybridizations were done at 22% or 37% overnight, Hybridized filters were washed in 6x SSC, 10 mM POn, 0.1% SDS at 37%-55%. Doublestranded DNA probes were hybridized as previously described (Landel et al., 1984) .",
