            "text": "Ebola virus (EBOV) makes extensive and intricate use of host factors in the cellular endosomal/lysosomal pathway to release its genome into the cytoplasm and initiate infection. Following viral internalization into endosomes, host cysteine proteases cleave the EBOV fusion glycoprotein (GP) to unmask the binding site for its intracellular receptor, the cholesterol transporter Niemann-Pick C1 (NPC1). GP-NPC1 interaction is required for viral entry. Despite these and other recent discoveries, late events in EBOV entry following GP-NPC1 binding and culminating in GP-catalyzed fusion between viral and cellular lipid bilayers remain enigmatic. A mechanistic understanding of EBOV membrane fusion has been hampered by the failure of previous efforts to reconstitute fusion in vitro or at the cell surface. This report describes an assay to monitor initial steps directly in EBOV membrane fusion-triggering of GP and virus-cell lipid mixing-by single virions in live cells. Fusogenic triggering of GP occurs predominantly in Rab7-positive (Rab7 \u0609 ) endosomes, absolutely requires interaction between proteolytically primed GP and NPC1, and is blocked by key GP-specific neutralizing antibodies with therapeutic potential. Unexpectedly, cysteine protease inhibitors do not inhibit lipid mixing by virions bearing precleaved GP, even though they completely block cytoplasmic entry by these viruses, as shown previously. These results point to distinct cellular requirements for different steps in EBOV membrane fusion and suggest a model in which host cysteine proteases are dispensable for GP fusion triggering after NPC1 binding but are required for the formation of fusion pores that permit genome delivery.",

To facilitate viral tracking in most experiments, virions were engineered to contain a fluorescent protein, monomeric NeonGreen (mNG), fused to the viral phosphoprotein (P) (27, 28) . The heavily glycosylated mucin domain (Muc) of EBOV GP is dispensable for entry, and its deletion enhances viral attachment (29, 30) . Accordingly, we primarily used VSV pseudotypes bearing mucin domain-deleted GP (GP\u232cMuc). To validate our viral preparations, 1,1=-dioctadecyl-3,3,3=,3=-tetramethylindodicarbocyanine (DiD)-labeled VSV bearing mNG-P and EBOV GP\u232cMuc was bound to a coverslip and incubated with Alexa Fluor 555-labeled KZ52, a neutralizing antibody that recognizes a conformational epitope at the GP1-GP2 interface (7) .

Lipid mixing between viral and host bilayers, as in hemifusion or fusion, enables lateral diffusion of the dye accompanied by dequenching or increased fluorescence intensity (31, 32) . Virions were labeled so that the fluorescence signal of self-quenched DiD was detectable prior to dequenching. DiD dequenching resulted in a sharp increase in signal, which we define here as at least a doubling of DiD intensity within 20 s, and a net increase in intensity of 2-to 5-fold within 1 min was typically observed ( Fig. 1B and C; see also Movie S1 in the supplemental material). In our experiments, increases in DiD signal sorted strictly into one of two groups: very fast or very slow. Fast dequenching, as indicated by a representative trace (Fig. 1D , solid line), occurred irrespective of nucleocapsid release (data not shown) and appears to indicate specifically triggered lipid mixing events. We attribute the significantly lower rate of DiD dequenching (Fig. 1D , dotted line) to nonspecific transfer of the dye to host membranes, possibly through particle degradation. Only fast events constituted \"dequenching\" in this study. We found that the extent of dequenching varied somewhat among DiD-labeled particles. This may reflect differences in the volumes of endocytic compartments, as well as in the concentration of dye within the viral membrane, as some heterogeneity in self-quenching was noted. Dequenching events occurring at later postinfection time points generally exhibited greater amplitude between the quenched and dequenched states (data not shown).",

The time span needed for 50% of particles bearing EBOV GP\u232cMuc to dequench (t 1/2 ) was 42 min, considerably greater than the t 1/2 of 17 min for similar particles bearing VSV G, which is believed to undergo fusion triggering in early endosomes ( Fig. 2A ) (33, 34) . We found that the dequenching kinetics for VSV-EBOV GP\u232cMuc particles were very similar in U2OS cells (t 1/2 \u03ed 44 min, Fig. 2B) , and, because autofluorescence is much lower than in Vero cells, we used U2OS cells in the bulk of our experiments. Regardless of cell type, virtually all dequenching events occurred within 2 h of the synchronized onset of infection. We also examined the dequenching kinetics of VSV particles bearing full-length EBOV GP. Although the onset and conclusion of dequenching events showed similar timings, the overall rate of dequenching by VSV-EBOV GP (t 1/2 \u03ed 64 min) was slower than that of VSV-EBOV GP\u232cMuc, which may reflect differences in internalization or the need for additional proteolytic processing (Fig. 2C) . Precleavage of EBOV GP\u232cMuc by thermolysin, which structurally and functionally mimics the required cleavage of EBOV GP by endosomal/lysosomal cysteine protease cathepsin B (19, 35) , did not accelerate dequenching kinetics compared to uncleaved EBOV GP\u232cMuc.",

Of the total number of cellassociated VSV-EBOV GP\u232cMuc particles, approximately 16% dequenched in Vero cells and 10% in U2OS cells within 2 h. Additionally, 9.1% of particles bearing full-length EBOV GP dequenched in U2OS cells in the same time span. VSV G particles showed similarly low probabilities for lipid mixing in the two cell types. Although we are unable to distinguish definitively between bound and internalized virions, nearly all cell-associated particles had trafficked to perinuclear regions by the end of experiments (data not shown), leading us to believe that uptake levels are high with both EBOV GP and VSV G. The low percentage of particles with actual relevance to infection validates our single-particle approach to elucidating aspects of EBOV entry. Viral lipid mixing is strictly GP mediated. In order to confirm that the observed dequenching events indeed represented GPmediated lipid mixing, we first assessed dequenching in the presence of NH 4 Cl. Failure to acidify endosomes precludes GP activation and infection (36, 37) , as low pH is required for cysteine cathepsin activity (38) and possibly for fusogenic conformational changes in GP (39, 40) . We found nearly a complete reduction of VSV-EBOV GP\u232cMuc dequenching by NH 4 Cl treatment, which lends support to the observed lipid mixing being specifically GP mediated (Fig. 3A) .",

Our results confirm that KZ52 and ZMapp treatments specifically render EBOV GP less able to engage in lipid mixing while leaving viral internalization and trafficking unaltered (see Fig. S1A in the supplemental material). Preincubation of VSV-EBOV GP\u232cMuc with KZ52 resulted in inhibition of dequenching by 60% at 50 g/ml and 85% at 100 g/ml. ZMapp also had a concentration-dependent, if slightly more potent, effect on dequenching, with lipid mixing inhibited by 83% at 50 g/ml and 91% at 100 g/ml. Neither antibody treatment was able to abolish dequenching, even though the concentrations used were approximately 30-fold to 40-fold higher than the reported IC 90 values for viral neutralization by KZ52, c2G4, and c4G7 individually (42, 45) . This supports the idea of the existence of a significant barrier to fusion, with the number of unencumbered GP molecules needed for simple lipid mixing being much lower than the number needed to bring about membrane fusion and genome release. Collectively, our results signify that lipid mixing is the express product of GP triggering, which entails some degree of conformational change by proteolytically primed EBOV GP and which may lead to or encompass full fusion. NPC1 is required for fusogenic triggering of EBOV GP. The endosomal/lysosomal membrane protein NPC1, involved in cholesterol homeostasis, serves as an essential intracellular receptor for filovirus infection, with a cysteine cathepsin-cleaved form of GP directly recognizing the lumenal domain C of NPC1 (20) (21) (22) 46) . Because the precise role of NPC1 in filovirus entry has not been fully defined, we evaluated lipid mixing in the absence of NPC1 (see Fig. S2 in the supplemental material). Dequenching of VSV-EBOV GP\u232cMuc particles was inhibited almost entirely in NPC1-deficient U2OS cells, whereas VSV G dequenching was unaffected, indicating that NPC1 expression is vital for EBOV fusion triggering (Fig. 4A) .",

Recent work has shown that proteolytic cleavage of GP1 exposes the NPC1-binding site, com-prising a basic/polar crest overhanging a deep hydrophobic trough (65) . We investigated entry by VSV-EBOV GP\u232cMuc particles bearing three mutations in the NPC1-binding site (T83M in the trough, K114E/K115E in the crest) that abolish GP1-NPC1 interaction and viral infectivity (65) . Lipid mixing was reduced by 97% with this triple mutant (Fig. 4B ). The inhibition of lipid mixing by VSV-EBOV GP in NPC1-deficient U2OS cells and by VSV-EBOV GP (T83M/K114E/K115E) in wild-type (wt) U2OS cells was not explained by altered delivery to endosomal/lysosomal compartments, since postinfection colocalization of viral particles and endocytic markers was not significantly reduced (see Fig. S1B in the supplemental material). NPC1's functionality as a cholesterol transporter may also have some bearing on EBOV entry, as GP-mediated lipid mixing is selectively inhibited by the cationic amphiphile U18666A (Fig. 4C) , which induces an NPC1 disease phenotype marked by cholesterol accumulation within late endosomes and lysosomes (20, 49) . GP1-NPC1 binding is not affected by U18666A (20, 24), but short-term U18666A treatments that do not cause substantial cholesterol accumulation (see Fig. S3 in the supplemental material) nevertheless prevent EBOV entry (20) , suggesting that this block is due to the drug's specific effect on NPC1 rather than to the resulting increase in endosomal/lysosomal cholesterol levels. Taken together, our results provide direct evidence that NPC1 facilitates one or more early steps in EBOV membrane fusion.",

Colocalization of dequenching virions with fluorescently labeled endosomal markers was performed in order to elucidate the compartment in which EBOV GPdependent membrane fusion is triggered ( Fig. 5 ; see also Movies S2 to S5 in the supplemental material). Although a recent report suggested that EBOV fuses exclusively in compartments devoid of NPC1 (50), we found that all dequenching particles in NPC1-mNG-expressing cells colocalized with this marker at the time of dequenching ( Fig. 5J ; see also Movie S5). Additionally, the high percentage of dequenching particles colocalized with green fluorescent protein (GFP)-Rab7 (98%) indicates the ubiquity of this protein in endosomes supporting GP triggering. Further evidence that EBOV must traffic to a suitably mature compartment for fusion was provided by inhibition of dequenching by the twopore calcium channel (TPC)-blocking small molecule tetrandrine (Fig. 6) . Tetrandrine, which may impair the activity of TPC in endocytic trafficking and heterotypic fusion of vesicles (51) , was recently shown to inhibit EBOV infection in vitro and in vivo (50) and decreased GP-mediated lipid mixing in our assay by 95% at 10 M.",

Despite their slower rate of lipid mixing events (Fig. 2C) , 10% of particles bearing full-length EBOV GP also dequenched in Rab5 \u03e9 compartments (data not shown). Because Rab7 appears to be a nearly essential component of the EBOV fusion compartment, these Rab5 \u03e9 vesicles are likely intermediate endosomes, suggesting that GP triggering can occur earlier in the endocytic pathway than commonly believed (20, 50, 52, 53) . Our results also imply that some population of endosomes must display Rab5 and NPC1 concurrently, at least in the U2OS cell line used. We detected an average lag of 6 min (ranging from 40 s to more than 20 min) between colocalization of viral and NPC1 signals and dequenching, indicating that the occurrence of GP triggering is not immediate upon delivery to NPC1 \u03e9 compartments (Fig. 5K) .",

Internalization and late endosomal delivery of VSV particles bearing these mutants did not differ significantly from VSV-EBOV GP\u232cMuc (see Fig. S1C in the supplemental material), indicating that their defects are specific to aspects of fusion. The GP (F535R) mutant, characterized as having impaired membrane binding and insertion capability (54) , exhibited no defect in lipid mixing while being unable to support infection. Another fusion loop mutant, GP (L529A/I544A) (54), showed substantially de- creased lipid mixing. The L529A/I544A mutation is believed to prevent formation of the hydrophobic fusion loop tip at low pH, with L529 and I544 creating a scaffold along with F535 (54, 55) . While nonviable, the double mutant did effect low-level lipid mixing (Fig. 7) , suggesting that even severely disrupted GP fusion loops retain some capacity for membrane insertion in cells.",

In order to separate possible requirements for cysteine cathepsins pre-and post-NPC1 binding, we evaluated lipid mixing by GP in various cleavage states in the presence and absence of E-64d. Thermolysin was used to generate particles either fully or partially lacking C-terminal GP1 sequences corresponding to the glycan cap and mucin domains (Fig. 8A) . While increased infectivity of particles bearing cleaved GP has been reported (19, 30, 35) , we did not observe this phenomenon or enhanced lipid mixing. When particles were bound to cells to the same extent, cleaved and uncleaved GP produced similar levels of lipid mixing and infection ( Fig. 8B and C) . Unexpectedly, we found that dequenching by particles with cleaved EBOV GP was much less susceptible to E-64d blockage and that the degree of lipid mixing correlated with the extent of GP cleavage (Fig. 8C) . Fully cleaved GP exhibited slight hyperfusogenicity that was unaffected in the absence of cathepsin activity. The in-ability of precleavage to rescue infectivity in E-64d-treated cells (Fig. 8B) , however, indicates that a specific requirement for cathepsins in fusion pore formation lies post-NPC1 binding.",

We found that the appearance of NPC1 in virus-bearing endosomes always preceded GP triggering, though the time span between the two events varied (Fig. 5K) , as also reported by Simmons and colleagues through a live-cell imaging assay with GP-pseudotyped retroviruses while the current article was in preparation (53). Mingo et al. proposed that delivery to NPC1 \u03e9 vesicles represented a key rate-limiting step for EBOV fusion (52), but we found a lag ranging from 40 s to more than 20 min between virus-NPC1 colocalization and dequenching. It is unknown at present whether NPC1 binding directly promotes fusogenic conformational changes in GP or primes it for interaction with additional host factors. Therefore, while the lag may represent the span of time needed for the virus to bind NPC1 as its lumenal domains appear in the compartment, it may also signify a need for one or more host factors to act on GP prior to or following GP1-NPC1 interaction.",

Previously thought to undergo triggering only quite late in the endocytic pathway (50, 53) , EBOV GP could mediate lipid mixing in intermediate endosomes, as indicated by their Rab5 signal, in our live assays. Because the presence of NPC1 is an absolute requirement for dequenching in our assay, we infer that some population of Rab5 \u03e9 vesicles must contain NPC1 in U2OS cells. Such colocalization is not impossible, as immunofluorescence and fractionation studies have shown that NPC1 localizes primarily, but not entirely, to late endosomes, lysosomes, and the trans-Golgi network (49) ; therefore, NPC1 levels in some intermediate endosomes may be sufficient to support GP triggering. However, it is unclear whether viral genome release from relatively immature endosomes can occur following GP fusion triggering. Indeed, Simmons et al. found no evidence for GP-mediated retroviral content release from Rab5 \u03e9 compartments (53) , raising the possibility that virions must traffic further in the endocytic pathway to encounter host factors at levels necessary for complete fusion and genome release.",

It was proposed on structural grounds that these base-binding antibodies potently neutralize by blocking fusogenic rearrangement and membrane insertion by GP2. Here, we provide the first direct evidence that neutralizing antibodies targeting the EBOV GP base inhibit viral fusion triggering (Fig. 3C) . Interestingly, higher concentrations of neutralizing antibody were required to inhibit lipid mixing to the same extent as infection, but this may typify fusion by enveloped viruses. A recent study by Otterstrom et al. (57) examined the levels of antibody binding needed to inhibit influenza virus hemifusion. Using a pair of potent, broadly effective neutralizing antibodies, whose inhibitory profiles against influenza virus strains are very similar to those of KZ52 and ZMapp against filoviruses (58, 59) , the authors showed that only high concentrations of these stem-binding antibodies were able to block the majority of hemifusion events. Although their assay (viral particles bound to a supported bilayer) differed from ours, their data strongly corroborate our results, with approximately 50 to 150 g/ml of either anti-influenza virus antibody needed to reduce in vitro hemifusion by~90%. The requirement for antibody concentrations beyond relevance to infection indicates a far lower threshold for lipid mixing than for full fusion and content release.",

We advance two mechanistic scenarios to account for our observations. First, the fusion trigger (comprising NPC1 and possibly an additional signal, e.g., acid pH, but not cysteine cathepsins) releases GP from its prefusion conformation, allowing formation of a membrane-bound prehairpin intermediate and driving hemifusion of viral and cellular membranes. A final cysteine cathepsin cleavage event then enables GP refolding to a 6HB, which mediates fusion pore formation and genome release. A similar two-step mechanism, with sequential roles for receptor binding and low pH, has been proposed for fusion by the avian sarcoma/leukosis retrovirus (61) . Alternatively, it is conceivable that proteolytic cleavage of NPC1-bound GP is indeed the fusion trigger but that GP fusion triggering and 6HB formation can nevertheless occur inefficiently in the absence of cysteine cathepsin activity. Rearrangement of a few GP trimers may permit lipid mixing but not energetically costly fusion pore formation and expansion.",

The eluate was concentrated and buffer exchanged with PBS by use of an Amicon centrifugal filter concentrator (Millipore) with a molecular weight cutoff of 30,000 Da. Purified antibody was stored at \u03ea20\u00b0C. Protein concentration and yield were determined by UV absorbance, and purity was determined by SDS-PAGE. For labeling coverslip-bound virus, KZ52 was conjugated with Zenon Alexa Fluor 555 (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's instructions.",

Samples were mounted on the microscope and quickly focused, and then 1.5 ml warm imaging buffer was added to start the experiment (t \u03ed 0). Images were acquired every 4 s over the duration of the experiments using a single Z-section, as the cells were very flat. Excluding the initial kinetics studies, all experiments were limited to 2 h. Data analysis. Image analysis and single-particle tracking were performed using Volocity software (PerkinElmer). Excluding minor adjustments in brightness and contrast, image files were not manipulated. For single-particle dequenching measurements, puncta were thresholded by initial intensity and size. Puncta falling outside the range of 0.125 to 1.0 m 2 expected of discrete VSV particles were excluded from analysis.",
