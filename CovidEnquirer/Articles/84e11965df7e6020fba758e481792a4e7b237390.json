Methods: RT-PCR methods were used to detect HRVs in throat and nasal swabs collected from 6104 adult patients with ARTIs from December 2005 to April 2008 in Beijing, China. Results: HRV strains were detected in 271 ARTIs cases, 65% of which tested positive for HRV-A, 25% for HRV-B, and 10% for HRV-C. Aside from fever, pharyngeal congestion and headache were the most common clinical symptoms observed in the HRVs infected patients. HRV-A infected patients had a higher percentage of upper respiratory symptoms than patients infected by the two other HRV species. Systemic symptoms such as chilliness and myalgia were more frequent in people infected by HRV-B. The three HRV species exhibited unique infection timing when analyzed monthly. Conclusion: HRV-C can be detected in adult patients with acute upper respiratory tract infections, but is not the predominant species in this population.",

            "text": "Human rhinoviruses (HRVs) are well recognized as the causal agents for acute respiratory tract infections (ARTIs) in individuals of all ages. They were first isolated in 1956 and are members of the Picornaviridae family. 1 HRV infections occur year round with seasonal peaks of incidence in the early fall and spring. 2e5 They can cause a broad range of symptoms and impact the economy yearly through loss of productivity and medical costs. 6 Around 100 HRV serotypes have been documented so far. 7 The originally identified 99 serotypes are classified into two species, HRV-A (containing 74 serotypes) and HRV-B (containing 25 serotypes) 8 according to the partial sequences of viral capsid-coding regions, noncoding regions, and a limited number of complete genomes. For the last 50 years, HRV has been thought to cause only mild respiratory infections. However, several recent findings are altering our understanding of HRVs. In 2007, a novel HRV was identified in infants with bronchiolitis. 9 Other new strains were subsequently detected. 10e12 These novel HRV strains are now designated as HRV-C, as recommended by the International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV). Research teams from different countries have detected such HRV strains and have characterized their role in ARTIs around the globe. 13e17 Recent studies of HRV-C have been based on clinical samples taken from pediatric patients with ARTIs. HRV-C strains have been shown to play an important role in pediatric lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs), including bronchitis, bronchiolitis, and pneumonia. 14, 18, 19 There is also an association of HRV-A and C with asthma exacerbations. 17 In addition, Lau and colleagues 20 found that HRV-C infection caused more pneumonia than HRV-A infection in adults, and that wheezing episodes were also more common among individuals with HRV-C and HRV-A infection than among those with HRV-B infection. Furthermore, our previous study indicated that HRVs have been responsible for the second most frequent ARTIs in China. 21 However, the role and clinical characteristics of HRV-C infections in adult patients with ARTIs has yet to be delineated.",

Using reverse transcription-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and sequence analysis, we found that HRV-C infections do not constitute a significant portion of HRV infections in adult patients suffering from ARTIs. 21 In brief, to include potential viral ARTIs and to exclude typical bacterial infections, patients enrolled in the study were randomly selected by physicians according to the following criteria: !14 years of age, with respiratory symptoms such as cough or wheezing, acute fever (body temperature !38 C), and normal or low leukocyte count, with or without radiological pulmonary abnormalities. Nasal and throat swabs were collected from each patient, and the two swabs were pooled in one tube containing virus transport medium (VTM; Copan, Brescia, Italy). The samples were stored at \u00c080 C until use. Note that asthma patients who may potentially be infected by rhinovirus were not included in our study because asthma patients who do not exhibit fever are excluded from the Fever Clinic Department. The infections of multiple viruses, including human parainfluenza viruses (HPIV) 1e4, influenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), enteroviruses, human coronaviruses (229E, NL63, HKU1, and OC43), metapneumovirus, adenoviruses, and bocavirus were also screened by multiplex RT-PCR or single RT-PCR or PCR assays. 21",

HRV-C was detected in only 10% of the cases, indicating that this novel HRV specie is not currently responsible for a majority of the HRV infections of adults with ARTIs that were sampled. These findings suggest a differential role of HRV species in adults with ARTIs. The detection rates for the three species of HRVs in our study are similar to those described in asthmatic adults in the USA. 10 However, our data differ from that observed in hospitalized adults with ARTIs in Hong Kong, where the detection rate of HRV-C (40%) was higher than that for HRV-B (17%) and lower than HRV-A (52%). 20 A variable detection rate of HRV-C in children has also been observed in different areas in Asia. HRV-C was the most predominant species responsible for HRV infection in children with LRTIs in Shanghai, China (52%) 12 and Thailand (58%). 29 This is in contrast to three other studies where HRV-C infection rates fell between that of HRV-A and B: 1) children with ARTIs in Lanzhou, China (36%), 30 2) hospitalized children in Hong Kong, China (44%), 20 and 3) hospitalized children in South Korea (31%). 31 Moreover, in hospitalized children in Singapore, the detection rate of HRV-C was only 3%. 32 These data indicate a variation in HRV-C prevalence in different geographic locations. In addition, as there may be a large number of HRV-C infections that are sub-clinical or do not require hospitalization, further investigations are needed to comprehensively assess the impact of HRV-C infections in adults. There are no significant differences in clinical manifestations between the HRV-positive and HRV-negative cases in our sampled population. In addition to fever (positive vs negative: 100% vs 100%), the major clinical manifestations were pharyngeal congestion (positive vs negative: 96% vs 93%), headache (positive vs negative: 79% vs 79%), myalgia (positive vs negative: 76% vs 75%), chilliness (positive vs negative: 74% vs 76%) and sore throat (positive vs negative: 59% vs 61%).",

As such, single detection with VP4/VP2 primers may lead to false negative results. To overcome this barrier, we also assayed for the 5 0 -UTR, not as a surrogate of capsid-coding sequence based typing, but as a supplemental tool for VP4/VP2 negative samples. 13 The primers targeting 5 0 -UTR can detect HRV in VP4/VP2 negative samples. 19 Using this additional methodology, we identified more than half (146/271) of the HRVs in samples that were initially negative for VP4/VP2. Published studies have demonstrated the relative reliability of using 5 0 -UTR in HRV detection despite some uncertainty. 39 The 5 0 -UTR contains both highly conserved sequences and variable sequences that exhibit 45% 13 e63% identity, 25 making this assay an ideal candidate for typing strains that have eluded capsid gene amplification. 37 Lee et al. 13 and Kiang et al. 25 found that all HRV prototype strains had unique genomic sequences in the 5 0 -UTR, which allows the distinction of HRV from other picornavirus, i.e. enteroviruses, by using ECHO11 as an outgroup. Though differ from those of VP4/VP2, the phylogenetic tree constructed by 5 0 -UTR can cluster HRV-C into several clades. Some HRV-C strains (HRV-QPM, C026, NAT001 are clustered as HRV-A2; C025 and NAT045 are clustered as GAC-1) are clustered within the HRV-A clade based on 5 0 -UTR sequence. Piralla et al. have demonstrated that these strains are actually HRV-C strains by analysis of the VP4/ VP2 region and the cre element. 19 Hence, in this case, although some HRV-C strains are being clustered into the HRV-A clade based on their 5 0 -UTR sequence, they still can be correctly typed by using the designated HRV-C strains as indicators in the phylogenetic tree. In our study, we used 5 0 -UTR primers according to Lee et al. 13 to improve the detection of HRV. In addition, we analyzed all the PCR products by phylogenetic analysis, including all available rhinovirus prototypes and some enterovirus strains to ensure that the positive result was true. Therefore, our results of HRV detection based on the 5 0 -UTR approach appears sound. Given the complexity of HRV types and our limited detection, future detailed investigations on HRV typing could verify this matter. ND: Not done. We could not do c2 test between groups in these cases.",

HRV is an important cause of asthma exacerbations in children 43 and HRV-positive adults have more asthma symptoms than non-infected adults. 44 As patients were recruited from the Fever Clinic Department and asthmatic patients without fever were not admitted to this department, asthma patients potentially infected by rhinovirus were not included in our study. Nicholson et al. 41 reported that chronic ill health and smoking increases the likelihood of lower respiratory complications among HRV-infected elderly people (aged 60e90). In our investigation, the majority of patients aged 18e59 years and most of HRV-positive people were healthy before the respiratory tract infection event. Only five patients admitted to smoking in this study. In addition, most of our patients suffered from URTIs (96%), and hospitalized patients with LRTIs were not included in this study. These disparities may also lead to the difference in detection rates for HRV species compared to those of patients with LRTIs (e.g. pneumonia). 20 Because we could not follow the outpatients to collect subsequent samples, we were not able to monitor the HRV infections to explore the relevance of different HRV genotypes. Such investigations can be carried out in future studies by employing hospitalized patients.",

Since the sampling was performed every day, this phenomenon may reflect a stochastic sampling with HRV-A being the largest serotype. Although HRV-B infection constituted a smaller fraction of the overall HRV infection, we did note a modest increase in HRV-B detection rate from July to October, in both 2006 and 2007. Also of note, HRV-C could not be detected from July to September in both 2006 and 2007. Aside from the increased detection rate in May 2007, HRV-B shared respiratory tract infections with HRV-A during July and September 2006.",
