However, the function of circRNAs during viral infection remains largely unknown. In this study, the circRNA expression profile during porcine endemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) infection in IPEC-J2 cell line was investigated using the next-generation sequencing technology. A total of 26670 circRNA candidates were identified. The functional annotation analysis revealed that the parent genes of differentially expressed circRNAs might be associated with host response to PEDV infection. Further analysis verified the existence of eight selected circRNAs and confirmed that PEDV infection alerted the expression patterns of circRNAs and their linear parent genes in IPEC-J2 cell line. The circRNA-miRNA interaction network was also constructed to elucidate their potential targets. Our results provided not only the first large-scale profile analysis of circRNAs associated with PEDV infection but also a novel direction to elucidate host-PEDV interactions.",

In contrast to linear RNAs, the circRNA is characterized by back-splicing events that a downstream 5\u2032 splice site joins with an upstream 3\u2032 splice site (Jeck et al., 2013) . Thus, the terminated 5\u2032 caps and 3\u2032 tails modifying the mature mRNAs are not found within circRNAs. With these characteristics, circRNAs were once thought to be the by-product of splicing errors when they were first detected in genomes of viriod plant pathogens and Hepatitis delta virus in 1976 (Halbreich et al., 1980; Sanger et al., 1976) . Later, with the development and improvement of RNA-sequencing technologies and bioinformatics tools, circRNAs were discovered in nearly all the species (Gao et al., 2015) . The circRNAs were even found to play vital roles in regulating gene expression.",

Since its re-emergence in 2010, this disease has caused huge economic loss to the swine industry in North America and East Asia (Davies, 2015; Lee and Lee, 2014; Temeeyasen et al., 2014; Vlasova et al., 2014; Wang et al., 2016) . Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), the causative agent of PED, is a single stranded, positive-sense enveloped RNA virus, belonging to the Alphacoronavirus genus within the Coronaviridae family. Although the pathogenesis and immune mechanisms of other coronavirus such as SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV have been understood quite well (Channappanavar et al., 2014; de Wit et al., 2016; Qian et al., 2013; van den Brand et al., 2015) , they remain largely unknown in PEDV infection, especially for the host-pathogen interactions. RNAs, a bridge between DNA and protein, have the potential to regulate the host response to the viral infection earlier and faster than the proteins. However, the detailed functions of RNAs, especially cir-cRNAs, remain largely undefined during viral infection.",

Therefore, it is of great importance to select proper time points for profiling circRNAs expression during PEDV infection. To do so, IPEC-J2 cells were inoculated with PEDV at an MOI = 0.01 or mock-treated and harvested at 12, 24, 36, 48, 60 and 72 h post infection (hpi). The total RNA was extracted and subjected to the real-time RT-PCR analysis to evaluate the host immune responses induced by PEDV on IPEC-J2 cells. The type III interferon has been reported to play a vital role in maintaining the antiviral state of the mucosal epithelial cell surface in the gut and resist PEDV infection Shen et al., 2016; Zhang et al., 2018) . Therefore, the IFN-\u03bb1 and IFN-\u03bb3 were selected to monitor antiviral responses and results showed that their expression levels were significantly upregulated and reached their peaks at 36 hpi and dropped to the normal level thereafter (Fig. 1A, B ). Foxp3 and granulocyte-macrophage are the major helper IPEC-J2 cells plated in six-well plates were infected with PEDV LJX01/GS/2014 strain at an MOI = 0.01 or mock infected. Cell pellets were used for RNA extraction. The cDNA were prepared with hexamer random primers and subjected to real-time PCR analysis for the expressions of A) IFN-\u03bb1, B) IFN-\u03bb3, C) GM-CSF and D) FOXP3 at indicated time points. The relative expression levels were calculated by 2 -\u0394\u0394Ct method. E) The copy numbers of PEDV genome were measured by real-time RT-qPCR analysis at each time point. All experiments were carried out triplicates. cells for IgA responses to gut microbiota (Cong et al., 2009; Gommerman et al., 2014; Nei et al., 2012; Russler-Germain et al., 2017) . We next checked the expression of GM-CSF and Foxp3 to reflect the immune responses induced by PEDV infection. The results illustrated that they were both activated upon PEDV infection, with the highest expression levels appeared at 60 hpi then dropped down at 72 hpi (Fig. 1C, D) . The growth curve of PEDV infection on IPEC-J2 demonstrated the number of viral RNA copies peaked at 24 hpi and slowly decreased thereafter (Fig. 1E ). All these data indicated that the host cells responded to PEDV infection with a time depended manner. Therefore, the samples from 36 hpi, 60 hpi and 72 hpi were selected for library construction and circRNA sequencing.",

The genomic distance between two splice sites was less than 100 kb, and each circRNA was supported by at least 2 reads in each sample. Based on the mapping results, CIRI (v2.0) was used to detect circRNA candidates from transcriptome data by employing multiple filtration strategies (Gao et al., 2015) . We identified 26670 novel circRNA candidates in all six samples. In each sample, the spliced reads per billion mapping (SRPBM) of all circRNA candidates was displayed by the box plot ( Fig. 2A ).

The number of circRNA candidate transcribed from SSC varied according to the length of chromosomes. Meanwhile, the average distance between splice sites for each circRNA transcription was nearly the same in all chromosomes except X and Y (Fig. 2C ). Previous researches claimed that the length of most circRNAs were shorter than 2 kb Lasda and Parker, 2014; Liang et al., 2017) . However, our results showed that the distance between the two splice sites varied from 2 kb to 20 kb, even with 29% of circRNAs larger than 20 kb (Fig. 2D ). It is also worth to mention that the distance between the splice sites does not represent the actual length of circRNAs. Nearly three quarters of circRNA candidates were transcribed from exons while only one quarter of them were transcribed from both intron and intergenic regions (Fig. 2E ). Among all genes that circRNAs were transcribed from, there were 56 genes that could generate more than 10 circRNA candidates (Fig. 2F) , indicating that some genes were more active for circRNA generation. These genes were mainly involved in ubiquitin signaling pathway, modification and transport of proteins, binding and transport of DNA and RNA. Some of these genes were reported to have the functional role in regulating viral infection (Park et al., 2013; Sorensen et al., 2005; Su et al., 2013; Wang et al., 2012) . A detailed list of these genes was presented in Supplementary Table 1.",

In this study, there were a total of 83 parent genes changed their expression levels during viral infection, accounting for 56.5% of all 147 analyzed parent genes. Therefore, functional analysis of the parent linear genes to DE circRNA candidates was firstly performed to predict the effect of the production of circRNAs. Both Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG databases were used in this process. GO annotation analysis revealed that the parent genes to DE circRNAs were mainly involved in catalytic and be part of macromolecular complex at all selected time points (Fig. 3A , B, C). There were also several reports demonstrated that circRNAs were actively participated in the metabolism process (Granados-Riveron and Aquino-Jarquin, 2016; Ye et al., 2015; Zou et al., 2017) . For functional analysis, the DE genes at all the time points were searched in KEGG pathway database. The ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, relevant to induction of IFNs and ISGs (Haas et al., 1987; Heaton et al., 2016; Hermant and Michiels, 2014; Kim et al., 2004) , was found to be highly related to the DE genes at 36 hpi (Fig. 3D ). Previous results in this study already showed the expression levels of IFN-\u03bb1 and IFN-\u03bb3 were significantly upregulated at 36 hpi ( Fig. 1A, B) , suggesting that the production of circRNAs potentially affect this biological process. At 60 hpi, KEGG analysis showed that some DE genes were involved in the T cell receptor signaling pathway (Fig. 3E ). This was proved by our previous results, showing the FoxP3 and GM-CSF, two of key regulators of T cell maturation and division, were highly upregulated at this time point (Fig. 1C, D) . Most PEDV-infected cells showed the sign of apoptosis at 72 hpi, resulting in many genes closely related to the degradation process (Fig. 3F ). All these data above indicated that the parent genes of circRNA candidates involve in host responses to viral infection, implying that this process may be affected by circRNAs.",

The selection of all candidate circRNAs was based on the following three rules. 1). The expression levels of all candidates and their parent genes should be significantly changed (fold > 2, p < 0.05); 2). The parent genes of all candidates should be related to immune response, antiviral effect, or facilitate viral infection; 3). All candidate cricRNAs should be identified or published by other researchers. (Liang et al., 2017) . The validation assay was carried out in three independent infection experiments. The divergent and convergent PCR primer sets (Table 1) were designed to amplify the selected circRNA candidates from the total RNA and genomic DNA. As expected, the expression and backsplicing junctions of the selected circRNAs, including circRNA2: 29213178-29216402, 59040088-59041075, 146476770-146479009, circRNA3: 76474842-76491398, circRNA6: 48351537-48356123, cir-cRNA7: 62801435-62806164, circRNA 9: 132682311-132683940 and circRNA11: 19712163-19718631 were confirmed by RT-PCR in the cDNA but not the genomic DNA samples (Fig. 4) .

Our real-time RT-PCR results targeted to these selected circRNA candidates showed a coincident expression pattern with the RNA-seq results showed in the heat-map (Fig. 5A, B) . Next, the expression levels of their parent linear genes were then detected using real-time RT-PCR assay. Some parent genes showed the same expression pattern with their cir-cRNA transcripts but some other parent genes showed an opposite expression pattern with their circRNAs (Fig. 5C ). These data suggested that all circRNAs and their parent genes were active during PEDV infection and might be potentially involved in host response against viral infection.",

Apart from the main function in regulating transcription and splicing of their parent genes, circRNAs can also indirectly regulate gene expression by competitively binding miRNAs with genes (Hansen et al., 2013a; Kulcheski et al., 2016) . As most miRNAs have not been studied, an integrated analysis of interaction between the selected circRNAs and their target miRNAs was performed to gain insights into their functional connections. The binding site analysis of miRNAs in circRNAs showed that a total of 102 miRNAs (see Supplementary Table 2 for details) had potential interactions with selected circRNAs (Fig. 7A) . Then the connection nodes among different circRNAs were extracted for a detailed ceRNA network analysis. As showed in Fig. 7B , 18 miRNAs interact with these 8 selected circRNAs. Among the 18 miRNAs, the expression levels of ssc-miR-127and ssc-miR-7 elevated > 1.5 folds at several time points (Fig. 7C) . The analysis of circRNA-miRNA interaction network revealed that circRNA11: 19712163-19718631 may act as a miRNA sponge for ssc-miR-127 and ssc-miR-7. To investigate this hypothesis, a set of siRNAs against the back-splicing site of circRNA11: 19712163-19718631 were then synthesized and transfected into IPED-J2 cells. The results demonstrated that sicirRNA-2 targeting circRNA11: 19712163-19718631 exhibited the best inhibition efficacy (Fig. 7D) .",

In order to investigate the relationship between circRNAs and PEDV-induced immune responses in the IPEC-J2 cells, we collected samples at different time points post PEDV infection based on the expression of IFN-\u03bb, Foxp3, and GM-CSF, for circRNAs sequencing and identified 26670 circRNA candidates. With GO and KEGG analysis, we demonstrated that the parent genes of DE circRNAs were closely related to the metabolism process, the ubiquitin mediated proteolysis, and the T cell receptor signaling pathway at the early stage of PEDV infection, and the degradation process at late stage, suggesting some circRNAs might be involved in these processes. Fig. 6 . The functional associated analysis of the parent genes for selected circRNAs A) The STRING analysis shows these parent genes of selected circRNAs are functional associated. These genes with their associated partners are mainly involved in the process of posttranslational modification of proteins by sumoylation, transport of proteins between the endoplasmic reticulum and Golgi compartments, and the regulation of cell cycle. CAD and CTNNB1 served as the key nodes in the interaction network. B) The expression levels of CAD and CTNNB1 at different time points post PEDV infection were measured real-time PCR analysis. C) The siRNA candidates were transfected into IPEC-J2 cells to knockdown the expressions of CAD2 and CTNNB1-2. D) The CAD and CTNNB1 in IPEC-J2 cells were knocked-down by specific siRNAs. The kinetics of PEDV replication in these cells was measured by TCID 50 assay. Scramble siRNA was served as negative control. E) The ratios of PEDV genome copies in siCAD and siCTNNB1 cells were normalized by that in NC cells.",

            "text": "The major question in the field of circRNAs research is to precisely figure out their biological functions. The circRNAs regulate gene expression through several different ways. The generation of circRNAs derived from exonic regions may potentially affect the protein expression from the parent genes. The exon-intron circRNAs localized to the promoter of their parental genes and associated with RNA polymerase II enhance the transcription efficiency through the interactions between U1 snRNA/U1A/U1C complex and the 50-splice site remained in the intron (Li et al., 2015b) . Another most important way is called \"ceRNA hypothesis\" (Taulli et al., 2013) , in which circRNAs can sequestrate miRNA and impair its activity, thereby up-regulating or down-regulating miRNA target gene expression (Thomson and Dinger, 2016) . CiRS-7 is the first circRNA identified as miRNA sponge (Hansen et al., 2013b) . It has more than 70 conserved binding sites of miRNA-7 and is densely bound by Argonaute (AGO) proteins (Hansen et al., 2013a) . In addition to parent gene regulation and miRNA sponges, circRNAs can interact with RNA binding proteins, such as circ-Foxo3 , circ-MBL (muscleblind) (Memczak et al., 2013) or coding proteins (Legnini et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2017; Yang et al., 2018) . But the study of the detailed regulation mechanism is still in its preliminary phase. Most circRNAs have been proved to play important roles via the former two mechanisms. Therefore, we performed the functional analysis to predict the roles of identified circRNAs candidates according to their parent genes and their target miRNAs.",
