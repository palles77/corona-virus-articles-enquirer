            "text": "Background: A 45-year old woman of Cambodian ethnic background presented with fatal respiratory failure due to a severe diaphragmatic dysfunction. Two years before, she had developed early onset of urinary symptoms. Methods and results: Neuroimaging showed atrophy of the spine and medulla as well as a leukodystrophy affecting both supra-and infra-tentorial regions. At autopsy, polyglucosan bodies (PB) were seen in several peripheral tissues, including the diaphragm, and nervous tissues such as peripheral nerves, cerebral white matter, basal ganglia, hippocampus, brainstem and cerebellum. Immunohistochemistry and electron microscopy of the brain revealed an exclusive astrocytic localization of the PB. The diagnosis of adult polyglucosan body disease (APBD) was confirmed by enzymatic and molecular studies. Conclusion: Storage of abnormal glycogen in astrocytes is sufficient to cause the leukodystrophy of APBD. Since brain glycogen is almost exclusively metabolized in astrocytes, this observation sheds light on the pathophysiology of APBD. In addition, this is the first report of an APBD patient presenting with a subacute diaphragmatic failure.",

Over the preceding 5 years, the patient had been treated for breast cancer. On admission, the patient required an emergency tracheal intubation because of hypercapnic coma. The first line of investigations did not reveal any sign of infection or inflammation, neither pulmonary embolism. Proximal four-limb weakness was noticed with hyperreflexia, suggesting a motor neuron disease. Nevertheless, the electromyography performed at bedside was normal, as well as standard biochemical analyses in blood and cerebrospinal fluid.

Of note, PB were relatively more abundant in the diaphragm than in limb muscles. In the sural nerve, PB appeared surrounded by LFB, compatible with their localization in Schwann cells rather than in axons ( Supplementary  Fig. 2 ), but were not found in serial semi-thin sections. Externally, the cerebrum and brainstem were normal. By contrast, the spinal cord was severely and globally atrophic ( Supplementary Fig. 3) . Examination of the brain sections showed atrophy of the corpus callosum associated with grayish discoloration of the white matter with sparing of the U fibers, particularly in the frontal lobes. PB were present in all examined cerebral regions, within both the white and gray matters, central gray nuclei, cerebellum and brainstem. They were particularly abundant in the hippocampus (Supplementary Fig. 4) . PB were localized within the astrocytes, particularly in the astrocytic endings, as shown with anti-GFAP and anti-AQP4 immunostaining ( Figs. 2A and B) . By contrast, no PB were found in other cell types of the CNS, such as neurons (Fig. 2C) , oligodendrocytes (Fig. 2D ) or microglia (data not shown). PAS stain performed on NF immunolabeled sections confirmed the absence of PB in neurons (data not shown). Electron microscopy confirmed the exclusive astrocytic localization of PB (Fig. 3) . PB were associated with white matter pallor, diffuse microglial activation and astrogliosis. Axonal loss and swelling suggested degeneration rather than demyelination (Figs. 2C and D) . Likewise, the diffuse white matter disease hyperintensity on T2-weighted MRI images seen in the patient reflected this concurrent myelin and axonal loss. Examination of the spinal cord showed many PB in the gray and white matter, but sparing of motor neurons ( Supplementary Fig. 5) .",

A concurrent normal control was also sampled and analyzed on that same day confirming a reduced GBE activity in the patient's leukocytes -1.01 U/g protein for the control vs 0.22 U/g for the patient. Molecular studies identified 2 compound heterozygote mutations in the GBE1 gene: (i) p.H319Y mutation (c.955C>T) in exon 7, a mutation already identified in an antenatal GSD IV presentation (R. Froissart, unpublished data) and (ii) p.G353A mutation (c.1058G>C) in exon 8, a missense mutation not previously reported. These 2 mutations were likely pathogenic since they affect conserved residues of the GBE protein, are predicted to alter protein function (http://genetics.bwh.harvard.edu/pph/) and are absent from control sequences (http://browser.1000genomes.org/index.html and http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/projects/SNP).",

Brain MRI showing a specific pattern of white matter abnormalities as recently described (Mochel et al., 2012) , together with early onset of urinary symptoms and severe spinal cord atrophy was suggestive of APBD, which was confirmed by neuropathology, enzymatic and molecular testing. To our knowledge, this is the first APBD patient of Cambodian origin. As expected, this patient did not harbor the most common Ashkenazi Jewish mutation (Y329S). This confirms that APBD should be considered in patients with non-Jewish ethnic background. Although this is the first case report of GSD IV affecting the diaphragm, this observation is reminiscent of the involvement of the diaphragm, heart and skeletal muscle in GSD II (Pompe disease) caused by the 1,4 alpha glucosidase. Moreover, one of the 2 mutations identified in our patient has previously been associated with an antenatal presentation of GSD IV characterized by severe muscular involvement.",

            "text": "This neuropathological study addresses the controversial cellular localization of PB in the brain, which is likely to have an impact on therapeutic strategies in APBD. Unlike previous observations where PB were also reported in neurons (Gray et al., 1988; Robitaille et al., 1980) , our patient is the first confirmed GBE deficient patient in whom PB were consistently seen in astrocytes only. The observation that the exclusive astrocytic localization of the PB is sufficient to cause APBD due to GBE deficiency is in agreement with what is known about brain glycogen metabolism (Benarroch, 2010) . Glycogen is almost exclusively localized in astrocytes even though neurons have the capacity to synthesize it. Neurons that recover their capacity to synthesize glycogen are indeed driven to apoptosis (Vilchez et al., 2007) . The glycogen present in astrocytes is converted into lactate and then transmitted to neurons where it is used as a main substrate (Magistretti and Allaman, 2007) . The accumulation of glycogen in astrocytes due to GBE deficiency is likely to result in a lack of energy substrates, first for astrocytes and then for neurons. Accordingly, the relative young age of our patient at autopsy is a likely explanation for the exclusive presence of PB in astrocytes at this early stage of the disease. Considering that this patient already manifested neurological symptomsi.e. urinary symptoms and pyramidal signsand typical neuroimaging finding of APBD, our report therefore emphasizes that the presence of PB in astrocytes is sufficient to cause APBD.",
