Among the Desiderata was a call for terminologies to be ''concept oriented.'' Since then, research has trended toward the extension of terminologies into ontologies. A paper by Smith, entitled ''From Concepts to Clinical Reality: An Essay on the Benchmarking of Biomedical Terminologies'' urges a realist approach that seeks terminologies composed of universals, rather than concepts. The current paper addresses issues raised by Smith and attempts to extend the Desiderata, not away from concepts, but towards recognition that concepts and universals must both be embraced and can coexist peaceably in controlled terminologies. To that end, additional Desiderata are defined that deal with the purpose, rather than the structure, of controlled medical terminologies.",

The uses can be quite varied but they all require some capability for symbolic manipulation. Otherwise, why bother with controlled representation when one could just store raw signals? At the simplest level, symbolic manipulation at least requires a set of symbols (often referred to as identifiers) that distinguish the various elements of data and knowledge. Human-understandable labels (often referred to as terms) for these elements are not always required, 1 but they are usually deemed convenient, if for no other reason than the need to map human-collected data into symbols and to map symbols into human-usable results. Sets of these symbols and labels (or terms and identifiers) are usually referred to as controlled terminologies.",

The term ''meaning'' has several definitions (or meanings!), including ''the thing one intends to convey especially by language'' [2] . How one conveys these ''things'' may be accomplished by various methods, depending on what that thing is. For example, if the thing is a particular object in reality (say, a particular person or automobile), its meaning might be conveyed by a proper noun or some unique identifier (e.g., the person\u00d5s name or the automobile\u00d5s registration number). If the thing is a generalization of some particular set of things in reality (that is, a universal that has some extension, or set of instances in reality), its meaning might be conveyed by a general term for the things or by some set of characteristics that all these things have in common (e.g., ''person'' or ''passenger vehicle, self-propelled, four wheels . . .''-of course, this raises the need to define these additional terms). Finally, if the thing is an idea, we might refer to it with some description of the idea or by describing the particular instances on which the idea is based.",

Depending on how the thing to which the term corresponds is viewed, it might have multiple aspects that could be conveyed in multiple ways. For example, a controlled terminology for speaking about celestial bodies might contain a term with the name ''solar planet,'' the meaning of which might be expressed by referring to a list of known planets (''any of Mercury, Venus, Earth . . .'') or by a intentional definition (''a large body that orbits around the Sun''). 2 The names (terms) used for these things usually serve the purpose of conveying the meanings, when the reader has appropriate background knowledge. The Desiderata attempted to stress the fact that something more formal than the language-specific linguistic shorthand with which humans are comfortable was required to convey meanings in useful ways. Specifically, some formal representation to convey the intended meanings of the data and knowledge elements was requested. Formal representations could, themselves, be represented symbolically (that is, using a controlled terminology) and would be independent of the fashions of language. In the ''solar planet'' example above, this might be accomplished by including in the terminology elements corresponding to each of the planets, by including elements that correspond to the Sun and the notion of orbit, or by both.",

Instead, the Desiderata attempted to describe this focus on meanings to be ''concept oriented.'' The use of ''concept'' was chosen as a way to refer to the meanings of the symbols, as understood by humans. But, the notion of ''concept''-an abstract idea generalized from specific instances [2] -is only one aspect of the data and knowledge items that we might wish to represent. As a result, while the Desiderata may be interpreted narrowly, in fact, the work from which they were synthesized related to broader aspects of symbolic representation.",

While a clinical record may appear to capture that, as Smith charges, a physician fits together a patient and a concept (e.g., a disease), the clinical record is usually capturing (with some unique identifier composed of time, patient, physician, and concept) that at some point in time, the physician is observing attributes of the patient that leads the physician to believe that the signs the patient is manifesting are evidence that the patient has some disease. Thus, while the concept may appear to be separate from the patient, there is a deeper connection that is implied by the design of the patient record [9] .",

When an actual specimen is collected from an actual patient, it is assigned a unique identifier (at New York Presbyterian Hospital, these are called ''accession numbers''). Using such identifiers, it is possible to perform multiple measurements on the same specimen (to check for consistency), to perform different measurements on the same specimen (to correlate findings), and to report multiple results on the same specimen (such as preliminary and final results).

The alternative, to add a new specimen term to the laboratory system\u00d5s terminology when the first instance of specimen is created, is simply not practical: laboratory systems dictate to the clinicians which specimens are allowed, not the other way around.",

For example, the clinical collection of patient temperature is a routine procedure that will continue regardless of how we represent the resulting data. Recording a number of degrees in the patient record, along with a unique identifier for that recording, is not sufficient for the information to be used in care of the patient; somehow, the notion that it is a body temperature must be conveyed. To really know the patient\u00d5s body temperature, we would need to know the kinetic energy of every one of the patient\u00d5s molecules. Any measurement process that attempted to detect this would (according to Heisenberg) render the result moot by destroying the patient. Instead, we use a device that detects, imperfectly, the average kinetic energy of a small subset of the patient\u00d5s molecules. From this, we make a guess at the patient\u00d5s actual temperature, taking into account that the reliability of our estimate is further influenced by the orifice containing the aforementioned molecules. I submit, then, that when we record a patient\u00d5s temperature, we can only do so through reference to concepts; we do not have the luxury of ''real'' universals. We might allow that since this is the best approximation we can make, that patient body temperature is, for all intents and purposes, a universal, or we can acknowledge that we use the instances of measurements to help us create a conceptual representation from which we can reason. The result-what we think we are dealing with and what we do about it-is the same. The advantages of an imperfect universal over an imperfect concept are not self-evident.",

Most of the time, however, the temperature is used as a proxy for detecting and monitoring underlying conditions. We speak of the term of ''fever'' and its more specific, yet less-well-defined term ''low-grade fever.'' If these terms correspond to the ways we think about various states of patient temperature, then they are concepts. Can we at least do away with these concepts and reason from first principles about our patients? This approach is appealing, until we consider that we don\u00d5t have much of a clue about the first principles that relate disease processes to particular values of body temperature. Is a patient with a temperature of 39\u00b0C twice as sick as a patient with a temperature of 38\u00b0C, or only 2.6% sicker? Of course, neither is the case, but we have no algorithm nor body of experience with which to characterize patient states based on temperature. Instead, we mentally convert temperature measurements into conceptual representations of the patient\u00d5s true body temperature (as above) and then further use concepts like ''low-grade fever'' to help us match patients tacitly to conceptual patterns that correspond to various disease states (such as mild upper respiratory tract infection-a cold).",

While such characteristics were certainly true for each individual patient, we must also consider how clinicians dealt with this condition. Did they hold in their minds the unique identifiers of the individual cases or did they use some abstract representation, based on their understanding of the disease at the time? It is certainly the latter, for without the conceptual representation, they would have no way to consider cases that fit some of the pattern of the disease without having all of the characteristics of the initial cases-for example, they would have to treat cases arising in Canada as a different set of instances of a different universal, since they do not match the previously identified geographic characteristics.

Canadian SARS cases can be classified as such according to the conceptual representation, allowing us to relax the geographic constraints retroactively. It is fitting, then, that a controlled terminology contain terms corresponding to such concepts, to record, in the patient\u00d5s record, what diagnosis the clinician is considering at some point in time.

I believe that Smith would argue that this is precisely his point: attempting conceptual orientation inevitably leads to such muddiness. This may be as true of concept orientation as any other orientation, but in this case the error was a systematic one that conceptorientation itself actually helped to resolve. It seems that, at the time that terms for drug products were added to the UMLS, they were simply treated as instances of chemicals and were therefore indistinguishable from the chemicals from which they were composed (Nelson, personal communication). 3 Eventually, the NLM determined that two meanings were present-one that referred to an organic acid (a chemical) and one that referred to a drug (a manufactured object). The NLM determined that the chemicals and manufactured objects were mutually exclusive semantic types; therefore, the assignment of these two meanings to the same identifier could automatically be determined to represent ambiguity.

For example, although ''aspirin'' is often a shorthand form of the term ''aspirin preparation,'' the terminology should make the distinction between the two terms clear to the person recording a patient\u00d5s medications, such that someone later encountering the information in the patient\u00d5s record will be able to determine the meaning intended by the recorder.",

            "text": "(3) Terminologies should allow storage, retrieval, and transfer of information with as little information loss as possible. This has implications for how terminologies evolve over time, while the data they are used to record remain as frozen artifacts. Changes in terminologies should not hamper our understanding of what was stored on the side of the patient. For example, many medical products that contained phenylpropanolamine-a drug that has been prohibited by the US Food and Drug Administration-have continued to be manufactured with a substitute ingredient (pseudoephedrine). While the names of these medications have not changed, the identifiers used to refer to them must change, so that we can know, from a patient\u00d5s medical record, which form of the medication the patient received. (4) Terminologies should support aggregation of data. While we want our terminologies to support those who record data, we must recognize the legitimate needs for abstraction of data, perhaps from multiple perspectives. For example, if we want to know which patients are taking aspirin preparations, we will want to be able to identify those patients whose records contain ''Aspergum'' (or any of a large number of other specific products), as well as those whose records merely show that they are taking an ''aspirin preparation.'' (5) Terminologies should support reuse of data. Users of data may wish to consider transformations other than simple aggregation, using what is known about the terms by which the data are recorded. For example, if we wish to know whether a patient is taking an antiplatelet agent, an antipyretic, an analgesic, or a nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory agent, we would want to be able to identify our Aspergum-taking patient as such. (6) Terminologies should support inferencing. The knowledge underlying the terms used to record data should be compatible with knowledge used for conceptual representations for reasoning (by humans and computers), such that the transformation from the former to the latter can be accomplished. We need to be able to reach across from what is on the side of the patient to use it on the side of the clinician; terminologies can help. For example, we would like to be able to use the knowledge that the (conceptual) condition ''aspirin allergy'' is related to the chemical ''aspirin'' and, from that, infer that we should be concerned about aspirin-allergic patients (instances of a universal) who are given aspirin-containing products (instances of another universal).",

As long as we consider that the purpose of terminologies is to support the recording and use of actual data, rather than primarily as a pure knowledge base of what is known in biomedicine, I believe that concepts and universals can coexist and commingle in controlled terminologies, to the advantage of those who seek to improve patient care through symbolic representation of patient information.",
