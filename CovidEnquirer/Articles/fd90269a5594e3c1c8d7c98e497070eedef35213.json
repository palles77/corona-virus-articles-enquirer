In 2011, the Taiwan CDC initiated a stockpile replacement model in order to optimize the PPE stockpiling efficiency, ensure a minimum stockpile, use the government's limited funds more effectively, and achieve the goal of sustainable management. This stockpile replacement model employs a first-in-first-out principle in which the oldest stock in the central government stockpile is regularly replaced and replenished with the same amount of new and qualified products, ensuring the availability and maintenance of the minimum stockpiles. In addition, a joint electronic procurement platform has been established for merchandising the replaced PPE to local health authorities and medical and other institutions for their routine or epidemic use. In this article, we describe the PPE stockpile model in Taiwan, including the 3-tier stockpiling framework, the operational model, the components of the replacement system, implementation outcomes, epidemic supports, and the challenges and prospects of this model.",

At the time, medical masks (including surgical masks and N95 respirators) and coveralls were in short supply, resulting in fear, decreased confi-dence, and decreased willingness to work among frontline healthcare workers. 1, 2 In addition, the insufficient supply of medical masks in the retail markets triggered panic buying by the public. Consequently, the Communicable Disease Control Act in Taiwan was amended, and a 3-tier stockpiling framework of personal protective equipment (PPE) was established in 2003. Based on the act, the central government, local health authorities, and medical institutions are required to maintain a minimum stockpile of PPE (including surgical masks, N95 respirators, and coveralls) to ensure a sufficient supply for epidemic prevention and frontline healthcare personnel during the early phase of an epidemic. However, during nonepidemic periods, the use of PPE from the central government inventory was relatively limited; thus, most of the PPE remained unused and expired and needed to be destroyed. To solve this issue, the Taiwan CDC, which is responsible for the management of the national stockpile system, developed a concept of stockpile replacement incorporated with a public-private partnership, including public sectors and private contractors, and employing the principles of logistics, supply chain management, commercial marketing, and relevant laws and regulations. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] In this article, the national stockpile systems in the US, Canada, Australia, and Singapore are briefly introduced, and the stockpile model with a replacement mechanism in Taiwan is described and evaluated. The experience described may serve as a reference for improving the national stockpile system of other countries.",

However, at present, a significant proportion of the supplies and equipment in the stockpile is nearly out-of-date and not in accordance with current medical standards or practices. Therefore, the Canadian government is working on new strategies to solve the issue of the high maintenance cost.

This pre-positioning of ''mini-clinics'' aims to supplement existing medical care facilities that might be overwhelmed in a disaster.",

Two key strategies are: (1) the development of a fully costed model for shelf-life extension, and (2) the examination of options for stock cycling or rotation. The advantages of stock cycling or rotation are to minimize waste and storage and disposal costs and to reduce the need for regular replenishment. Currently, the Australian Department of Health is implementing the policy of stock rotation through suppliers for some antibiotics and P2 respirators, and a 10% to 15% rotation rate of P2 respirators was made possible. However, it is estimated that the savings for P2 respirators and antibiotic rotation over 10 years would be less than 1%. 15 ",

However, manufacturers and suppliers often cannot meet the surge demand because of difficulties in material preparation, insufficient production capacity, and global panic buying. The discrepancy between the supply and demand directly affects protection measures for the frontline healthcare and epidemic prevention workers, causing fear and reduced workplace efficiency. After the SARS epidemic, the Taiwan CDC proposed ''A Strategy Plan for PPE Minimum Stockpile'' and established the 3-tier stockpiling framework-a central health authority (managed by the Taiwan CDC), local health authorities, and medical institutions-to effectively respond to emergent demands and spread the risk of stockpiling. We have also formulated a minimum stockpile for each tier, taking into consideration: (1) the protective properties of PPE; (2) the consumption of PPE during nonepidemic and epidemic periods; (3) the production capacity of the manufacturers; (4) potential alternatives; and (5) the lead time. In addition, the amount of PPE required for nationwide medical care, border quarantine, and epidemic prevention during the early phase of an outbreak was estimated. In 2003, the nationwide minimum stockpile of PPE included 3 million N95 respirators, 1.5 million coveralls, and 25 million surgical masks. In 2006, the nationwide minimum stockpile was adjusted to 2 million N95 respirators, 800,000 coveralls, and 7 million surgical masks, with half of them stockpiled in medical institutions and a quarter of them in the central and local health authorities, respectively.",

Usage during nonepidemic periods was quite low compared to the inventory level. To solve the issue of low consumption and having a mostly out-of-date PPE stockpile in the central health authority during nonepidemic periods, while maintaining the minimum stockpile, the Taiwan CDC reviewed and evaluated different stockpile models in other countries and developed a replacement model for PPE stockpile management. The operational principles and outcomes of the PPE stock replacement model in Taiwan are described below.",

In this model, the central health authority is regarded as a large reservoir of stocks, and the local health authority and medical institutions are regarded as small reservoirs. The concept is to combine the replacement of the large reservoir with the consumption of small reservoirs. The oldest stockpile of the large reservoir is regularly replaced and immediately replenished with the same amount of PPE by private contractors. Meanwhile, the removed stock is circulated into small reservoirs for routine and emergency demand through the joint electronic procurement platform run by the contractors. Through this replacement model, the stockpile continuously flows through the large reservoir to small reservoirs, and we ensure the PPE stockpile in the central health authority is available in appropriate quantities and within the expiry date.",

In addition, to ensure the surge capacity during epidemic periods, the contractors must guarantee to provide 5 million surgical masks, 100,000 N95 respirators, and 15,000 coveralls within 14 days in response to an emergency request from the Taiwan CDC.",

The service fee includes the manual and computational process the contractors need to refresh the stockpile, which is less than the original purchasing cost because the contractors could further sell the replaced stockpile to domestic institutions through the joint e-purchasing platform or to other countries through their own channels of distribution. For example, the service fee for surgical mask replacement is only 27% of the original purchasing cost, and the total savings for surgical masks amounts to NT$53.7 million during the 5-year contract. The service fee for N95 respirators is only 46% of the original price; therefore, it is estimated that a total of NT$3.55 million is saved over a 4-year contract. For coveralls, the service fee is about 34% of the original price, and a total of NT$13.46 million is saved over a 4-year contract.

In addition, the Taiwan CDC actively participated in international cooperation and humanitarian aid by donating 100,000 coveralls and 100,000 surgical masks from the stockpiling system to West African countries during the Ebola epidemic in 2014. In response to the avian flu epidemic in 2015 in Taiwan, the Taiwan CDC also immediately provided 128,500 coveralls, 147,040 N95 respirators, and 152,000 surgical masks to support the Taiwan Bureau of Animal and Plant Health Inspection and Quarantine (BAPHIQ) as emergency supplies.
