Patients and methods: The retrospective study was performed including a total of 37 post-SARS ONFH patients (66 hip joints) in the Department of Orthopedics of the General Hospital of Tianjin Medical University between November 2003 and November 2015, consisting of 6 males (11 hip joints) and 31 females (55 hip joints), with age between 19 and 47 years (average 29.9 years). Visual analog scale (VAS) score, Harris score and Association Research Circulation Osseous (ARCO) stage of imaging examination were compared among those before treatment, and at 1, 3, 6, 9 and 12 years after treatment. Paired t-test was used for statistical analysis of VAS and Harris score before and after treatment. Difference of effective rate on all stages was analyzed with Chi-square test. Results: With 12-year follow-up, significant improvements on VAS (6.81 of pre-treatment vs 3.94 of 12-year post-treatment) and Harris score (74.54 of pre-treatment vs 80.14 of 12-year post-treatment) were observed (all p,0.05). Effective rate showed statistical significance among three stages of ARCO (p,0.05). The combined treatment showed different efficacies on different ARCO stages; the best was on ARCO Phase I. Conclusion: The combined treatment may delay or discontinue the development of ONFH in post-SARS patients.",

            "text": "Osteonecrosis of the femoral head (ONFH) is a refractory disease in orthopedics practice and can be divided into traumatic and non-traumatic types. Major reasons causing non-traumatic ONFH include hormone abuse, ethanol overdosage, congenital and other unknown factors. In the spring of 2003, the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) broke out in most cities of China, and the patients who recovered from SARS suffered mostly from the refractory disease -ONFH. The incidence of ONFH is \u223c60%-70% after SARS treatment, and ONFH mostly occurred in bilateral sides. 1 It is thought that post-SARS ONFH is mainly caused by the application of high dosage of glucocorticoid hormones during SARS treatment, though some studies indicated that other reasons might be applicable in those cases. 2,3 SARS could be one independent risk factor causing ONFH, 4, 5 perhaps via mediation by S proteins. 6 Due to unclear pathogenesis and mechanism of SARS, there has been no definitive treatment strategy for ONFH. Major treatment approaches include non-surgery (drugs, hyperbaric oxygen, extracorporeal shock wave, pulsed electromagnetic treatment, decreased loading, and proper breaking and retraction) and surgery (medullary decompression of femur, bone transplant without vessels, osteotomy, autograft bone transplantation with vessels, and artificial joint replacement). [8] [9] [10] Here, we retrospectively studied the long-term efficacies of the combined treatment (non-surgery) for 37 post-SARS patients suffering from ONFH between the end of 2003 and the end of 2015.",

Alendronate drugs can inhibit bone absorption ability of osteoclasts, accelerate osteoclast apoptosis, improve bone volume and bone strength, and facilitate bone healing, thus impeding and retarding ONFH progression, decreasing bone absorption and femoral head collapse, as well as decreasing the frequency of surgery for collapse. Hong et al showed that alendronate is one effective 13 However, due to potential side effects including jaw bone necrosis or bone fracture after long-term application of alendronate, some surgeons still prefer surgery approaches. 13 Bone et al observed 10-year study on menopausal women and found no significant correlation between alendronate drugs and bone fracture. 14 This study performed 12-year alendronate sodium treatment (70 mg weekly) on all post-SARS ONFH patients and found no jaw bone absorption or fracture among all patients. Extracorporeal shock wave therapy (ESWT) can alleviate or treat ONFH via enhancing expression of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) in subchondral bones of the femoral head and induction of de novo angiogenesis to improve femoral head blood supply. Vulpiani et al found that ESWT could benefit bone reconstruction and regeneration via stimulating vascular growth factor expression. 15 , 16 Wang et al compared ESWT and surgery approach and found that ESWT had significant clinical efficacy and less probability of surgery. 17 Lin et al also showed efficacy of ESWT on prednisone treatmentinduced ONFH after systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE) treatment. 18 20 Hyperbaric oxygen environment can enhance oxygen concentration in blood, thus alleviating oxygen perfusion into bone tissues for reducing ",

Moreover, hyperbaric oxygen can also stimulate vessel angiogenesis and the function of osteoblast and osteoclast cells, thus providing necessary pre-conditions for treating ONFH. Koren et al performed an 11.1\u00b15.1-year follow-up study and indicated that hyperbaric oxygen was 1 effective method for treating Phase I and Phase II ONFH. 21 It is still debatable about the effects of single usage of hyperbaric oxygen to treat post-SARS ONFH. Wu et al 22 performed a follow-up on Phase I ONFH of SARS patients and reported that hyperbaric oxygen cannot effectively impede or reverse progression of Phase I ONFH after SARS, while Qiu and Zhang 3 attributed hyperbaric oxygen to be a satisfactory method for treating post-SARS ONFH. This study performed regular combined treatment consisting of alendronate drug, extracorporeal shock wave and hyperbaric oxygen. By 12-year long-term follow-up, some patients showed clinical improvement of ONFH, while most patients showed retardation of disease progression or even reversion. By statistical analysis of VAS and Harris score before and after treatment, we found significant differences (p,0.05). Therefore, we believe that long-term treatment of combined therapy including alendronate drug, extracorporeal shock wave and hyperbaric oxygen could effectively retard ONFH progression, alleviate patient's clinical symptoms and improve hip joint function, thus decreasing the risk of surgery on post-SARS ONFH patients.",

Averaged VAS score was further lowered with elongated treatment time, reaching 6.35\u00b11.51 at the 3rd year (3rd year Student's t-test [t2a] =2.750, p,0.05) and 6.00\u00b11.68 at the 6th year (6th year Student's t-test [t3a] =3.274, p,0.05), 4.92\u00b11.82 at the 9th year (9th year Student's t-test [t4a] =5.845, p,0.05) and eventually 3.97\u00b12.23 at the 12th year at the end of observation window (12th year Student's t-test [t5a] =6.844, p,0.05). Harris score showed gradual improvement with continuous drug treatment. Before recruitment, averaged Harris score of all patients was 74.54\u00b19.92, which was elevated to 76.49\u00b18.75 (first year Student's t-test [t1b] =2.499, p,0.05) 1 year after, and further increased to 77.11\u00b18.33 at the 3rd year (3rd year Student's t-test [t2b] =2.779, p,0.05), 77.92\u00b18.01 at the 6th year (6th year Student's t-test [t3b] =2.857, p,0.05), 78.78\u00b18.79 at the 9th year (9th year Student's t-test [t4b] =3.138, p,0.05) and 80.14\u00b19.47 at the 12th year (12th year Student's t-test [t5b] =3.590, p,0.05).In summary, patient VAS and Harris score were all significantly improved after 12-year treatment (Table 1).",
