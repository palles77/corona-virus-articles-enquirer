To deeply reveal the interaction of host and SARS-CoV, based on the basic structural feature of pathogen-associated molecular pattern, we created a new bioinformatics method for searching potential pathogenic molecules and identified a set of SARS-CoV specific GU-rich ssRNA fragments with a high-density distribution in the genome. In vitro experiments, the result showed the representative SARS-CoV ssRNAs had powerful immunostimulatory activities to induce considerable level of pro-inflammatory cytokine TNF-a, IL-6 and IL-12 release via the TLR7 and TLR8, almost 2-fold higher than the strong stimulatory ssRNA40 that was found previously from other virus. Moreover, SARS-CoV ssRNA was able to cause acute lung injury in mice with a high mortality rate in vivo experiment. It suggests that SARS-CoV specific GU-rich ssRNA plays a very important role in the cytokine storm associated with a dysregulation of the innate immunity. This study not only presents new evidence about the immunopathologic damage caused by overactive inflammation during the SARS-CoV infection, but also provides a useful clue for a new therapeutic strategy.",

Because cytokine storm has been observed in the rapid course of SARS [8] , and the pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as IL-6, TNF-a, etc, are up-regulated in clinical serum or cultured supernatants [9e13], it is inferred that an overactive innate immune response should contribute to virus-induced immune pathology resulting in acute lung injury in SARS patients.

However, little is known about the role of single-strand RNA (ssRNA) in the SARS-CoV as a kind of potential PAMP. Since a GU (guanosine and uridine) rich ssRNA40 from the U5 region of HIV-1 was identified as a natural agonist of TLR7 and TLR8 [19] , it is attractive if there are immune stimulatory ssRNAs existed in about 30 kb length of single-stranded SARS-CoV RNA genome, and the relevant immune effect is still unrevealed.",

Except for that, the host immune cell uptaking viral particle is an essential condition for the intracellular TLR7 and 8 to recognize the GU-rich ssRNA fragments. Although the pulmonary alveolar epithelium is the chief target of SARS-CoV [20] , SARS-CoV is able to infect both immature and mature human monocyte-derived DCs and the incomplete viral replication has been observed followed with low expression of antiviral cytokines (IFN-a, IFN-b, etc) and up-regulation of pro-inflammatory cytokines (TNF-a and IL-6) [13] . More interestingly, TLR7 is predominantly expressed in lung, placenta, and spleen, while TLR8 is predominantly expressed in lung and peripheral blood leukocytes [28] . These factors may provide SARS-CoV a shortcut to trigger innate immune response through the TLR7/8 and ultimately contribute to development of immune pathology within the lungs. On the other hand, although TLR7 and TLR8 are phylogenetically and structurally related, TLR7 and TLR8 specific agonists trigger a different cytokine induction profile. TLR7specific agonists generally induce IFN-regulated cytokines, but TLR8-specific agonists primarily lead to the production of pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as TNF-a and IL-12 [29] . In this study, the cytokine profiles show similar pro-inflammatory responses between TLR7 and TLR8 pathway, but the IFN-a is not detected after either TLR7 or TLR8 recognition, so the activation process induced by SARS-CoV GU-rich ssRNAs is mainly depended on the MyD88-NF-kb signal pathway but not the MyD88-IRF pathway. It implies the over-inflammation occurs together with a dysfunction of anti-virus immune response related to type I IFN in the acute severe period. All together, with the accumulation of new evidence, we are closer to the clinical truth of the dramatic cytokine storm and inflammatory response in SARS patients.",

These findings testify that GU-rich ssRNAs of SARS-CoV play a key role in the overactive innate immune response. This study not only presents new evidence to comprehensively interpret the occurrence of cytokine storm and the immune pathogenetic mechanism behind the SARS-CoV infection, but also provides an important clue for a new therapeutic strategy.",
