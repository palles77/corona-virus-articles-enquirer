            "text": "Presentation and lesion localisation Seven adult domestic shorthair cats were presented with a 1-to 6-day history of progressive neurological signs. A focal skin puncture and subcutaneous swelling over the dorsal part of the head were detected on physical examination. Neurological examination indicated lesion(s) in the right forebrain in four cats, multifocal forebrain in one cat, left forebrain in one cat, and multifocal forebrain and brainstem in the remaining cat. In all cats, magnetic resonance imaging revealed a space-occupying forebrain lesion causing a severe mass effect on adjacent brain parenchyma. Clinical approach and outcome All cats were managed with a combination of medical and surgical treatment. At surgery a small penetrating calvarial fracture was detected in all cats, and a tooth fragment was found within the content of the abscess in two cats. The combination of surgical intervention, intensive care and intravenous antimicrobials led to a return to normal neurological function in five cats. Practical relevance As this series of cases indicates, successful resolution of a brain abscess due to a bite injury depends on early recognition and combined used of antimicrobials and surgical intervention. A particular aim of surgery is to remove any skull and foreign body (tooth) fragments that may represent a continuing focus of infection. given a single dose of amoxicillin clavulanate (Augmentin; GlaxoSmithKline) 17 mg/kg IV, metronidazole (Metronidazole; Baxter Healthcare) 10 mg/kg IV, meloxicam (Metacam; Pfizer) 0.3 mg/kg SC, dexamethasone (Dexadreson; Intervet) 1 mg/kg IV and intravenous isotonic sodium chloride infusion at maintenance rate.",

In the late phase, ring enhancement may be present, and it is sometimes possible to observe a thin-walled rim of high signal (isointense to slightly hyperintense) on T1WI and hypointense on T2WI/FLAIR pre-contrast images; this is most likely due to paramagnetic free radicals secondary to the oxidative effect of the respiratory burst of the bacteria and produced within macrophages during active phagocytosis at the abscess rim. Typically, a mature abscess appears on T1WI as a round and well-demarcated hypointense region with mass effect and peripheral low intensity oedema beyond the margins of the lesion. In T2WI and FLAIR images the necrotic material is hyperintense relative to the CSF and to the surrounding parenchyma of the brain. After gadolinium administration, the abscess always shows ring enhancement and, less commonly, a multiloculated enhancement.",

            "text": "Brain abscesses may sometimes mimic necrotic tumours and cystic metastases, but recent studies have shown that cerebral abscesses show restricted diffusion on diffusion-weighted imaging (DWI). 22 Neuroimaging studies have been the most useful diagnostic tools in detecting and localising early brain abscesses. 17 A non-surgical approach is only possible when the aetiological agent is known based on positive cultures from CSF or fluid drained from the abscess. In the present cases, CSF collection was not performed due to the risk of brain herniation associated with raised ICP. Furthermore, CSF evaluation may be of little value in excluding an abscess from the differential diagnosis list as cultures are often negative in the face of bacterial infection of the CNS, and CSF analysis is rarely specific for bacterial abscesses. 23, 24 Antibiotics All patients were started on broad-spectrum antibiotics while awaiting the results of culture of swab material and fluid collected from the abscess during surgery. Positive cultures were obtained in three out of four cats for P multocida, E coli and Corynebacterium species, reflecting the most common bacteria found in a cat's mouth. In a study from Sweden where oral swabs were collected from 38 cats that had bitten humans, microbial culture yielded Pasturella species in 30 (79.9%) cats; 27 of the 30 (90%) samples yielded P multocida (one sample yielded P haemolytica, and two microbial growths were not speciated). Additional isolates included Prevotella oris-buccae and Enterobacter cloacae (from one sample each). Cultures of samples collected via gingival scraping from a group of 25 control cats all yielded P multocida; a member of the Enterobacteriaceae family and viridians group streptococci were detected in samples from two and one control cat(s), respectively. 25 Rational antimicrobial therapy in patients with brain abscessation depends on selecting antibiotics that are able to penetrate the blood-brain barrier and into the abscess cavity and that have good activity against the suspected pathogens. Ideally, intravenous therapy is recommended for at least the first 3-5 days of therapy; moreover in humans at least a 6-to 8-week treatment course is warranted. 17 The blood-brain barrier prevents the diffusion of many antibiotics in the CNS and this represents a major limitation with regard to reaching therapeutic drug concentrations in the CSF. High intravenous doses of ampicillin and third generation cephalosporins cross both healthy and inflamed meninges extremely well, 26, 27 enrofloxacin and metronidazole are excellent antibiotics and trimethoprimsulfonamide is bactericidal and readily penetrates the blood-brain barrier, even when it is not inflamed. 27 Glucocorticoids Five of seven cats received glucocorticoids for a period ranging from 1-58 days. Although glucocorticoid use in the face of infection is usually contraindicated, in human medicine there is abundant evidence that a transient anti-inflammatory dose of dexamethasone (0.15 mg/kg) q6h for 4 days can lead to lower ICP, lower inflammatory mediator concentrations, less CNS inflammation and generally a significant improvement in outcome in people with bacterial meningitis. [28] [29] [30] Inflammatory mediators, such as tumour necrosis factor, prostaglandins, interferons and interleukin-1, are produced in response to bacteria and bacterial cell wall lysis by the white blood cells attracted to the infection focus as a result of chemotaxis, and promote meningeal and ependymal inflammation resulting in oedema, infarction and vasculitis.",

In human medicine surgical management of brain abscesses has evolved recently with the development of mini-invasive surgical techniques such as stereotactic aspiration of the abscess. Surgical intervention is considered the gold standard treatment for brain abscess 34 and, at the same time, it allows collection of material from within the abscess itself for definitive diagnosis and culture/sensitivity testing.
