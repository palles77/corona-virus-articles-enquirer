To remain one step ahead of our pathogenic microbial foes, we must understand in detail how pathogens interact with their hosts, and how biological, environmental, and social factors combine to allow pathogens to infect new organisms. Deciphering each step in the different processes by which microbes adapt to new hosts is critical to developing effective countermeasures to detect, prevent, and treat infectious diseases. Our current efforts to prepare for the unpredictable event of a possible global influenza pandemic and to minimize the burden of highly predictable, seasonal influenza epidemics exemplify the challenges of trying to keep up with and hopefully stay ahead of the influenza virus, a constantly evolving pathogen.",

Most microbes have evolved to reach an equilibrium with their natural hosts without causing disease. However, factors such as economic development and land use leading to perturbations in the natural microbial environment, human demographics and behavior, and international travel and commerce can create an imbalance in the established microbe-host equilibrium and trigger the emergence of new infectious diseases. Human intrusion into settings such as rainforests has led to exposure of humans to viruses and other microbes that otherwise would not have occurred. For example, the practice of butchering nonhuman primates for \"bushmeat\" may be in part responsible for the \"jumping\" of HIV from its natural animal hosts to human hosts, as well as for the recent Ebola virus outbreaks in Central Africa. The flow of rural populations into cities, urban poverty, and weakening of traditional family and social structures have led to increased sexual promiscuity, prostitution, and other practices that undoubtedly fueled the spread of HIV/ AIDS in Africa. An outbreak of Nipah virus in Malaysia occurred when pigs penned near fruit orchards contracted the virus from the droppings of bats, whose habitat had shifted as a result of deforestation. The infected pigs readily transmitted the virus to their handlers. The spread of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE), or mad cow disease in cattle, and variant Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease in humans, primarily in the United Kingdom, resulted from the practice of feeding cows grain containing the remains of scrapie-infected sheep (Morens et al., 2004) .",

Influenza A subtypes are defined by the expression of two key surface proteins: hemagglutinin (H) and neuraminidase (N). Sixteen hemagglutinins are known to exist, each of which can be \"paired\" with one of nine neuraminidase proteins. These influenza A subtypes are all maintained in aquatic birds, which serve as a continual source of new viruses. A key factor in the possible emergence of an avian influenza virus as a human pandemic strain is the evolution and adaptation of the virus to the human species.

If a low pathogenic avian influenza A virus is transmitted to domestic poultry through direct or indirect contact or by exposure to fecal droppings, the virus can progressively mutate following passage from one susceptible bird to the next. This is illustrated in the figure by the increase in the number of infectious virions (green) following each passage of the virus from bird to bird until a mutant virus emerges that replicates to high levels and can kill the infected bird. Poultry harboring low pathogenic virus can make a full recovery, but those with highly pathogenic mutant forms of the virus almost always succumb to the virus and die. A highly pathogenic strain of H5N1 avian influenza virus replicates more efficiently and can be transmitted among poultry and from poultry to pigs and other mammals, including humans, through direct or indirect contact and via transport of infected poultry to other farms and markets. Susceptible migratory birds can become infected with the highly pathogenic mutant forms of the virus. Recently, migratory birds have started to show signs of disease from infection with the highly pathogenic H5N1 strain and may be able to transmit the more virulent virus to other birds, both wild and domestic, along their flight path, leading to rapid spread of the virulent virus. yet another strain to which humans had no prior exposure; this pandemic resulted in the deaths of approximately 700,000 individuals.

At an unknown point in time, the H5N1 avian influenza virus began to appear in poultry flocks in Southeast Asia, causing only mild symptoms of disease in birds before the mid 1990s. In late 1996, it became evident that the virus had mutated to a highly pathogenic form that could kill chickens within 48 hr, with a nearly 100 percent mortality rate. In 1997, the first human cases of highly lethal H5N1 influenza occurred in Hong Kong; 18 people were infected, and 6 died. Public health authorities in Hong Kong ordered a massive culling of poultry, which apparently prevented further spread of the virus at that time. However, in early 2003, the virus reappeared in a Hong Kong family who had recently visited mainland China. In late 2003, H5N1 surfaced again, first in Vietnam and then Thailand (http://www.who.int/ csr/disease/avian_influenza).",

Whether the virus develops into a strain capable of spreading from human to human in an efficient and sustained manner, thereby triggering a human pandemic, will depend on how the virus evolves and adapts to new hosts. Since its re-emergence in Southeast Asia in 2003, the virus has appeared in poultry in at least 18 countries and in multiple species of migratory birds. The virus also has been found in other animals, including pigs, tigers, and leopards. The virus has infected at least 93 people and killed 42 people in Vietnam. As of February 9, 2006, there have been at least 22 human cases and 14 deaths in Thailand, 4 cases (all fatal) in Cambodia, 25 cases and 18 deaths in Indonesia, 12 cases and 8 deaths in China, 12 cases and 4 deaths in Turkey, and 1 fatal case in Iraq, with the toll continuing to rise every week (see Figure 1 ). H5N1 influenza viruses had originally circulated in wild birds without causing disease and without mutating into highly virulent forms. Ominously, however, the currently circulating H5N1 viruses appear to have the ability to mutate in domestic poultry to highly pathogenic forms. As the virus has infected chickens and other domestic poultry, it has become increasingly virulent and has achieved the capability of jumping species to humans and to other animals with lethal consequences. Most alarmingly, the virus now seems to be transmitted from poultry back to migratory birds and, for the first time, is causing disease in the migrating bird population. This unprecedented pattern of transmission is an important reason why public health officials are watching the H5N1 virus carefully because it is a strain with the potential to cause the next influenza pandemic (see Figure 2 ) (http://www.fao. org/ag/againfo/subjects/en/health/ diseases-cards/special_avian.html).",

Rather, the virus accumulated a series of mutations that enabled it to more efficiently infect and replicate in human cells, explaining its rapid prop-agation among humans. By comparing sequences of the 1918 virus with known avian and human influenza viruses, it was possible to identify a set of 10 amino acid residues among the three viral polymerase proteins that are associated with the ability of the virus to infect and replicate efficiently in human cells. Thus far, the H5N1 virus has accumulated five of the ten changes in the encoded polymerase protein sequences that were found in the 1918 virus and are commonly found in human influenza viruses. This suggests that the H5N1 virus may be accumulating changes associated with an increased likelihood of human-to-human transmission (Taubenberger et al., 2005) .",

            "text": "Scientists also are investigating ways to increase the immunogenicity of H5N1 vaccines, including the use of adjuvants, employing intradermal rather than intramuscular administration, and developing live-attenuated vaccines. In this regard, a library of live-attenuated vaccines against all 16 major avian influenza subtypes is being developed through a Cooperative Research and Development Agreement (CRADA) between Med-Immune, Inc. and researchers at the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases. Once generated, production of these pre-existing stock vaccines could be scaled up and used to \"pre-prime\" individuals in an emergency situation while more specific vaccine formulations are being developed. Recent collaborative studies by researchers in the United States and China, involving genetic analysis of samples from 13,000 migratory birds and 50,000 domestic poultry, reveal that H5N1 viruses have been circulating among both wild and domestic birds in China for the past 10 years. These viruses have evolved into distinct genetic clusters associated with particular geographic regions. The studies suggest that the virus originated in China and has spread to neighboring and distant regions over the past decade (Chen et al., 2006) .",

Activities include increased surveillance of viral evolution and transmission among wild birds, domestic poultry, and humans, confirmation of etiologic agents in symptomatic patients and contacts, vaccine development and distribution, and stockpiling of antiviral treatments. WHO oversees a network of laboratories that monitor evolution of the H5N1 virus and prepare prototype vaccine strains for vaccine manufacturers. Currently ten countries have domestic vaccine manufacturers and several of these companies are developing pandemic vaccines. Although several countries have reported that efforts to vaccinate poultry are planned or underway, no companies are currently prepared to produce pandemic vaccines commercially for use in humans.",

In the 1970s, more than two dozen pharmaceutical companies were licensed to sell vaccines in the United States. Today, only four are licensed to manufacture influenza vaccine for distribution within the United States. It is important to develop partnerships among government, academia, and industry to increase the capability of developing new vaccine manufacturing technologies, such as cell-based culture techniques that will allow for greater flexibility and surge capacity in the production of vaccines. Indeed, it is essential for the U.S. Federal government to partner with pharmaceutical companies to develop and sustain the manufacturing capacity for vaccines and therapies that can be made available in an expeditious manner in the eventuality of a pandemic. Equally important is the institution of policies that will provide incentives to vaccine manufacturers to enter and remain in business.",

Although available technology offers sophisticated tools with which to monitor the evolution and characteristics of the virus, it will also be essential to use our knowledge and resources wisely. Increased cooperation among governments and public health agencies will be critical. The sharing of epidemiological data and deployment of countermeasures in the geographic areas where they are most likely to result in disease containment are equally important. Ongoing efforts in basic biomedical research also are critical to the comprehensive pandemic preparedness effort, including studies to understand viral pathogenesis; the ongoing search for new antivirals; new platforms and targets for vaccines, such as recombinant DNA and vector approaches; as well as improved vaccine manufacturing methods.",
