When it comes to living conditions it is quite hard, here I am living with my son and my grandchildren. There is no freedom at all. God did not create a human to live like the way we are living here'' (Never-married woman, 63 years old, Korogocho) [1] . experience poor health outcomes. But children who grow up under these conditions suffer a dual burden, as they have yet to fully develop physically and mentally. What are the primary factors that drive poor health outcomes of children residing in slum conditions and what can be done to reduce these disparities? Fairly recently, global attention has turned toward the conditions in slum areas with the inclusion of Millennium Development Goal (MDG) 7 Target 7D: ''By 2020, to have achieved a significant improvement in the lives of at least 100 million slum dwellers'' [2] . That seemingly lofty goal is followed by ''slum improvements, though considerable, are failing to keep pace with the growing ranks of the urban poor.'' That is a gross understatement. Even the MDG target falls far short of the need. The number of slum dwellers is growing at an alarming rate: a tripling of slum dwellers in less than 3 decades [3] . In 1976, 1.5 billion people lived in urban areas, and one-third were slum dwellers. In 2002, 3 billion or 47% of the world's population lived in cities and 1 billion or 16% lived in slums. It is expected that this number will double by 2030 [4] . Most of the urbanization is occurring in the least developed countries and many municipalities do not have the infrastructure to deal with the rapid expansion and lack the financial and human resources to provide basic utilities. In all regions of the developing world, the growth of slums, also known as informal settlements, is appallingly apparent. In Africa alone, close to 70 million live in slums; 6 of every 10 urban dwellers [5] . This will likely continue to expand, as currently, 38% of the 297 million Africans live in urban areas [6] , with an additional 60 million migrating into urban areas every year [5] . In India, as of 2007, approximately 170 million people lived in slums and one-third of them were children.",

Families and individuals move from rural to urban areas for several key perceptions, many are misperceptions: (1) employment opportunities and higher incomes, (2) availability of more and better social services and health care, (3) improved water supply and infrastructure, (4) a greater variety of educational opportunities, and (5) the reality of increasingly fractionated family lands yet more mouths to feed, declining crop production, and/or decreasing income from sale of crops. Many ruralurban migrants are poorer and less educated than their nonmigrant neighbors. As an example, in Nigeria, 62% of rural to urban migrants met the poor index compared with 13% of rural nonmigrants, and with 19% of those living in the city [7] . Sixty-five percent of the mothers leaving the rural areas had no education, as compared with 28% of those who did not migrate and 44% of those living in the city. Seeking a new and better life in the urban areas, these poorest of the poor and less educated from rural communities immigrate to the city. Yet on arrival, work is often scarce and individuals and families find themselves joining the urban poor. Residing in slum areas, they may find less access to the resources and services they were seeking when they left the rural areas ( Table 1) .",

Confounding factors included gross domestic product (GDP) per capita, proportion of population earning less than $1.25 per day, access to clean water and sanitation, and the unemployment rate. Childhood health outcomes included coverage with measles-containing vaccine (MCV), child malnutrition, low birth weight babies, total birth rate, neonatal mortality, infant mortality, under-5 mortality, and maternal mortality ratio. Of the immunizations available, MCV was chosen because of the relevance of MCV vaccine in slum settings with the very crowded conditions and the range in coverage that was seen across countries (Table 2) .",

            "text": "Overview of slum regions Factors detrimental to child health and development cluster in slum areas despite their sometimes startlingly close geographic proximity to where some of the best resources in a nation are located (Fig. 2) . Settlements are generally informal, springing up around areas of higher economic growth without approval or planning and often on land deemed undesirable (hillsides subject to flood and erosion, toxic landfills, or waste dumps). As a result, water and sanitation facilities are not planned and dwellings are often temporary and unstable. In these areas, there is little government investment in the construction of roads, schools, and health facilities. In the most extreme cases, the governments may demolish slum areas as a way of forcing these large populations to move elsewhere. This cycle leads to less investment of the slum dwellers in improving their own conditions, as all could be eliminated by someone else at any time without notice. All of these factors work synergistically to affect multiple facets of child health and development. This is described in detail from both short-term and long-term perspectives. Slum development and land tenure Typically etched into outskirts or inner parts of cities, slums usually begin unplanned and often are located in areas with a high risk for landslides, floods, and other natural disasters [12] . Hazardous and toxic waste and fumes are commonplace in these informal settlements. Land ownership is the exception rather than the rule [12] [13] [14] [15] . WB evidence suggests that in developing countries, as many as half of urban residents do not possess any type of legal document demonstrating that they have tenure security or own the land or property [16] . The socio-political context of slum areas limits the residents' ability to secure tenure or land ownership [13] [14] [15] . In Nigeria, for example, an urban land-seeker waits an average of 274 days and pays more than 27% of the property value in ''official fees'' before securing a land registration title [17] . To obtain governmental services, documentation, such as utility bills, identification cards, voter registration forms, and municipal tax receipts, is often required and whereas private services often do not require such documentation, these feebased services are unaffordable for most slum residents [12] . Most developing countries do not formally count slum dwellers in their census; therefore effectively concealing the existence of slums and increasing slum residents' vulnerability to unlawful evictions. Indeed, available data indicate that forcible evictions are increasing. Between 2000 and 2002, 6.7 million residents were evicted; 2.5 million more than the 4.2 million evicted during the preceding 2 years, 1998 to 2000 [18] . Evictions and demolition of slum areas are commonplace and have been reported in every region [13, [19] [20] [21] . Evictions and demolitions may precede redevelopment efforts and can greatly disturb the livelihoods of both communities and individual residents, place huge psychological and economic stress on individuals and families, and expose these groups to increased risk of violence and exploitation [22, 23] .",

Without any planning for the informal settlements, laying of pipes for water and sewage are rarely put in place. Our analysis demonstrates that in countries with higher urban-slum populations, water and sanitation access is lower (see Table 4 ). Regionally, sub-Saharan Africa has the least number of household connections to water, with rates as high as 99% in Liberia, followed by Asia, with a high of 85% in Afghanistan, and Latin America, with a high of 19% in El Salvador [24] . Rates of access are highly variable, even within country. In Kenya, for example, although 52% of urban households have access to residential water [24] , a survey in a Nairobi slum indicated only 19% of the population has household connections [25] . Water access in these slum communities may be from a combination of public standpipes, unprotected wells, and water from vendors. Although boreholes and protected wells may be developed in the informal settlements, it does not guarantee the availability of safe water, because of a lack of sanitation and the resulting groundwater contamination [24] .",

Not only is waste generated within the slum itself, but often slums are located adjacent to larger community dumpsites. Human waste disposal is of particular concern. Community-shared toilets are the norm. However, community toilets may not be maintained, may be far too few in number, or may not exist at all. In Kibera, a large slum in Nairobi, 40,000 people shared 10 latrines (1998) and in a slum in India 120,000 people shared 19 latrines [26] . The result is open defecation or ''flying toilet'' (disposal of excrement in a plastic bag that is thrown into the environment) [27] . National-level statistics do not distinguish between urban areas and urban-slum areas, and conditions in slum areas are often far worse than that reported on a country level. Improved sanitation, as defined by MDG, includes household-owned flush toilets, piped sewer systems, ventilated improved pit latrines, pit latrines with slab, or composting toilets. In Uganda, improved sanitation in urban areas is 34% overall with 50% of the population using shared toilets [28] . However, in a focused survey undertaken in a large Ugandan slum, only 20% of individuals had access to their own toilet facility, but many do not qualify as improved facilities; 79% of residents used shared or public toilet facilities [29] .",

Many slum residents and communities are either unable to afford the service fees or lack the necessary documents (such as legality of tenure) to set up electrification. Therefore, many private electricity companies have historically avoided servicing these areas. This situation does not mean, however, that slum households do not have electricity. Rather, many slum dwellers obtain electricity for their homes through illegal channels, as these service providers are easier to find and engage than are the legal services [33] . Evidence from the World Research Institute (WRI) suggests that as much as 7% of slum household expenditures go toward energy; this percentage grows as incomes lessen. Specifically, for slum households in Asia, energy expenditures are second only to food costs, whereas energy ranks third after housing and food for households with a low socioeconomic status in Latin American, Africa, and Eastern Europe [32] . Many of the slum dwellers with electricity use outdated appliances and/or the illegal service providers connect them in ways that make their consumption of electricity unnecessarily high, resulting in their payment to the illegal electricians very high [34] . This electrification context also exposes occupants to increased risk of electrical injuries and multiple-house fires [35] . Given the inability or difficulty to access electricity, many urban-slum dwellers rely on cook stoves and open fires to prepare food. In 8 major cities in India, the use of solid fuels that require ventilation are twofold to fivefold higher in slum areas than in nonslum areas [36] .",

Commonly understood as ''permanent and adequate structure in a nonhazardous location, protecting its inhabitants from the extremes of climatic conditions, such as rain, heat, cold, or humidity,'' durability is sorely lacking in most slum dwellings the world over [12] . In a slum, it is rare that the home the occupants first erect has wall, roof, and floor that are made of permanent materials. A house might begin as a shelter of cardboard and other scraps that slowly are replaced by less temporary materials, such as a corrugated iron roof or a cement floor. Although the permanency and durability of the structure varies generally, housing in slums is marked by their hazardous, temporary materials located on the outskirts of cities. In Addis Ababa, Ethiopia, nearly threequarters of slum dwellers used temporary materials to erect their walls, as opposed to 58% of nonslum residents [38] . Regional variations suggest the housing durability, as measured by floor material, is most flimsy in Asia and relatively strong in Latin America. More than 73% of urban dwellers reside in nonpermanent dwellings in Asia and more than half of these are in Southern Asia [39] . In Bangladesh, Nepal, and Pakistan almost a third of urban residents lack durable housing [12] . One in 10 urban residents in sub-Saharan Africa lives in nonpermanent structures versus fewer than 1 in 100 of urban North Africans.",

The standardized indicator for overcrowding developed by UN-HABITAT is more than 3 people sharing the same room [12] . Millions of the individuals who live in slums inhabit 1 room that is shared with 5, 6, or 7 others, all occupying a small space that may serve as kitchen, bedroom, and sitting room. Living in congested spaces not only limits privacy and safety, but it also exposes occupants to increased disease transmission and infection via the poor ventilation of small, overcrowded dwellings. The risk of eviction is heightened, as the overcrowding often violates rental agreements and/or damages property. Overcrowding varies by region. In Nairobi, Kenya, an example from sub-Saharan Africa, more than half of urban residents reside in slum communities that occupy only 5% of the land area of the city. Density in the slum area is 75,758 people per square mile versus 3.987 people per square mile in the nonslum areas, an almost 19-fold difference [10] .

Global and national-level policies have highly influenced access to health care and education in many developing nations. Following independence, many newly emerging nations began to accumulate a large amount of debt and experienced a growing financial imbalance. Loans were sought from the WB and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). Large loans were given with the stipulation that the country would restructure its economy by improving the management of payments, increase economic efficiency, and encourage private sector investments: Structured Adjustment Programs (SAP). The emphasis was on economic development, not social services. Education and health services were viewed as nonproductive, and to ''save the country's economy'' many service programs were sold to private firms where unfortunately, profits took priority over services. Governmental social safety nets were lost as user fees for health care and education were another stipulation for WB and IMF loans. Local governments received an immediate cash flow and shed the responsibilities and expense of providing services to the citizens. Local officials were happy but the people suffered. Relegating social services to the private sector meant limiting access to health care and education. User fees for these services, including the purchase of clean water, deepened the level of poverty and of health as the poor could not afford even modest fees and did without. Some SAPs demanded an increase in exports of goods and food, which limited domestic consumption. To their credit, members of the WB saw the deterioration of health care and educational opportunities, and recently have tried to reverse these trends. But it is too little too late, certainly too late to meet the MDGs. Skosireva and Holaday state that: ''SAPs have either created or worsened poverty levels or, at the very least, have ignored the adverse effects of the program on the poor [40] .''",

Matthews and colleagues [41] analyzed Demographic and Health Survey (DHS) data from 30 developing countries in Africa, Asia, and Latin America to determine indicators of maternal health care among the urban poor, as compared with the rural population. Their purpose was to see if there was an ''urban advantage'' or ''urban penalty'' for women. The investigators recognized a gap between different urban populations and speculated that the urban poor in many countries were at a disadvantage from their previous rural neighbors who did not migrate to the city. They found massive inequality in both urban and rural areas but greater inequality between slum urbanites or nonslum urbanites. The inequalities arose from exclusion; the urban poor did not have access to health care services and in some cities the slum dwellers were treated as if they did not even exist. However, there was a vast difference in the service gap among different countries. In some, the exclusion was not limited to the poor; services were insufficient for all strata of wealth. In others, it was primarily the poor who were excluded. And in some countries the urban population was well served without wealth or class distinction; a goal to strive for! Even when governmental programs to provide public clinics are established in a country, few of these are constructed in slum areas because of their tenuous nature [42] . Health care access is minimal at best in urban slums and is often predominated by private for-profit clinics [43] . Government investment in health care infrastructure in slums is limited. A study in Nairobi slums indicated that of 503 clinics serving what is reportedly the largest slum community in all of sub-Saharan Africa, only 6 (1%) were public and 79 (16%) were private not-forprofit clinics. Nearly all of the private for-profit clinics 418 (83%) in Nairobi slums are of dubious quality [44, 45] . The more qualified practices are expensive, forcing the use of cheaper private facilities that are often not licensed and operate out of small shacks and maternity homes without complying with any standards of care. Despite the poor quality, it is the less expensive private facilities that are the ones most often used by the residents. Women residing in slum areas, as elsewhere, prefer to deliver their babies in health care facilities where access is easy and quality is perceived to be high [46] . Given the difficulties already illustrated in transportation, access to public and nonprofit clinics of higher quality outside the slum areas is problematic; however, a lack of health care facilities is not apparent in all slum areas. In Chennai, India, slum residents were satisfied with their access to health care facilities with a mix of both government and private clinics within close proximity to residents; however, government clinics here were also somewhat limited, and individuals preferred the private clinics, considering them to provide better services [47] .",

            "text": "Being an unrecognized population affects not only the health sector but the education sector as well. National-level standards for school access are not being met in urban-slum areas. For example, in an Indian slum in Mumbai, the distance to elementary schools exceeds 2 km, despite a 1993 mandate that all children reside within 1 km of elementary schools. Investment in this infrastructure in these ''hidden'' populations is scanty. Again this acts synergistically with the inaccessibility of public transportation. Schools are not within walking distance but cannot be accessed by public transportation in a timely and economically feasible manner [48] . This has resulted in great disparities in access to education for the children living in urban slums. For example, in Guatemala (1999) only 54% of children living in slums were enrolled in primary education, as compared with 61% in rural areas and 73% in nonslum urban areas [12] . In Nairobi slums, educational achievement was far below that of their nonslum urban counterparts. Maternal education is strongly correlated with the educational achievement of a child. Women with no education in the slums constituted 5.1% of the population compared with 1.2% in the rest of the city. And in the nonslum areas, 54% of women had achieved at least some secondary school as compared with only 32% in slum areas [10] . This slum/nonslum education gap is persistent across generations and world region. In Delhi, India, 10% of the slum children never attended school compared with 31% of nonslum children [49] . In Bangladesh, evidence suggests that children in urban slums have less achievement in education than do their rural counterparts. Literacy rates are 52% in children from urban slums as compared with 70% in rural areas [49] . Even if children do begin school in a slum region, their education may be summarily disrupted. Many parents face the pragmatic pull between needs for basic sustenance and education for their children. Parents living in informal settlements have little if any savings and loss of livelihood, whether from natural disaster, illnesses, or loss of their or their children's employment directly affects their ability to buy food and pay bills, including fees for their children's education [50] . And those children who are able to remain in school face issues of school quality. Classrooms are often overcrowded and lack instructional materials and enough desks and/or chairs. Many students do not even have shoes, pens, or paper.",

Maternal surroundings and care received during the prenatal period can greatly influence both immediate and longer-term outcomes. In urban-slum areas, a large problem is inaccessible health care. Antenatal monitoring, delivery care, and newborn care are all extremely important to maternal and neonatal and infant survival. Maternal mortality is often overlooked as a pediatric health issue; yet, if a mother dies, the chances of survival of her newborn child are dramatically reduced and the impact on older surviving children can be devastating [53] [54] [55] . The primary causes of maternal death are hemorrhage, sepsis, hypertensive disorders, prolonged or obstructed labor, and unsafe abortion; conditions generally addressable through the availability of quality care before, during, and after delivery. In Bangladesh, only 15% of women in urban slums had a skilled attendant at birth compared with 19% in rural areas and 45% in urban-nonslum areas [11] . In neighboring India, only 41% of births of the urban very poor were attended by a medical doctor or nurse midwife compared with 87.2% of the nonpoor. Maternal mortality is disproportionately higher in slum areas than nationally [56] . In the slums of Nairobi, neonatal mortality was 50% higher (30.4 per 1000 live births) as compared with the rest of the city (20.8 per 1000 live births) and postneonatal mortality in the slums was 60.9 per 1000 live births as compared with 16.9 per 1000 live births in the rest of the city. The high rate of neonatal deaths in the first few days of life is largely the result of asphyxia or sepsis. To address those 2 problems, it is essential that the attending person is trained in the skills needed to recognize and address them and has the resources necessary to respond quickly to asphyxia and to take the appropriate action to manage sepsis.",

Uncertainty is an everyday reality in slums, where many residents are unsure of their employment, their next meal, or shelter tenure. This insecurity is a constant purveyor of anxiety and stress [60] .

Rural to urban migration and peri-urban slums are cited as one of the leading social factors related to emerging and reemerging infectious disease [64] . The chances of infectious disease introduction are higher with poor sanitation and a constant influx of in-migrating individuals. Once introduced, the extremely crowded conditions in the slums ensures close contact with infected individuals and creates a haven for the rapid spread of contagion from the infected to the unexpecting. Outbreaks spread quickly. The severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARs) epidemic in Hong Kong in 2002 and 2003 exemplifies how a disease originating in a somewhat isolated rural area can explode in an urban setting [64] . But it is not just new infections, but age-old infections that disproportionately burden slum dwellers. Tuberculosis transmission dramatically increases with overcrowding and is a magnitude higher in slum regions, exposing the young and the very young [65] [66] [67] [68] [69] [70] [71] . Lack of access to clean water in the slums has led to multiple cholera outbreaks [72] [73] [74] [75] . Poor infrastructure to keep out flood waters has led to outbreaks of leptospirosis [76, 77] . High levels of infection in the slums set up a vicious cycle of poverty. Some infections, such as HIV/AIDS, meningitis, and malaria, have a direct impact on mental development. Other common illnesses, such as diarrhea and respiratory infections, reduce school enrollment and attendance [78] [79] [80] [81] [82] [83] . Even if preventive measures, such as vaccinations, are available for a disease, children residing in slums are less likely to be vaccinated [84] [85] [86] , and lack of access to screening and treatment for all infectious diseases perpetuates the disease transmission cycle, as carriers of infectious agents pass them to others over longer periods of time. The very nature of slums has an indirect influence on disease transmission. Sexual debut in urban-slum areas is earlier and abject poverty and homelessness in the slums can force adolescents into the commercial sex trade at a very young age [87] [88] [89] [90] [91] [92] ; factors highly correlated with sexually transmitted infections.",

In urban slums, food is almost exclusively obtained from the market [93] . Household food security and thus nutritional status is determined by the in-hand cash the family has to purchase food. With ever-increasing housing prices and the need to pay exorbitant fees for utilities, purchasing of food is often sacrificed and the food that is purchased may be of low nutritional value; particularly detrimental for the urban poor who, if working, are most often engaged in hard manual labor [94, 95] . These factors paired with high levels of diarrheal disease and frequent respiratory infections lead to poor childhood nutrition [96] . Overall, malnutrition has been shown to be lower in urban areas in developing countries; however, this masks the great disparity between urban-nonslum areas and urban slums. A regional analysis indicated that when stratified by socioeconomic status, intraurban inequities were more pronounced that urban-rural inequities [97] . This greater disparity in urban areas was also supported by our findings in Kenya and Bangladesh (see Table 2 ).",

Across multiple regions, analyses have demonstrated that stunting in children residing in urban slums is high and higher than in nonslum urban areas and even higher than in rural areas [98] [99] [100] [101] . In Niger, stunted development affects twice as many children in rural and poor urban areas as in children from nonslum areas of the cities: 4 to 5 of 10 as compared with 1 of 4. Children living in rural areas and in city slums were 4 times more likely to be malnourished than children from nonslum urban areas. In the Democratic Republic of Congo, malnutrition affected 41% of children from poor urban areas and only 16% from nonslum urban areas. Likewise in Bolivia, India, and Bangladesh, malnutrition is twice as prevalent in the city slums and rural areas as in the nonslum areas of the cities. In children older than 15 months, the prevalence of stunting in Nairobi is close to 27%, whereas in the slums of Nairobi, stunting was more than twice that at 57% [102] . The impact of climate change and flooding has also been associated with food insecurity and malnutrition [95] , and the threats of environmental disaster are a constant presence in many urban slum communities. The situation is dire in urban slums and some argue that there is a need to rethink Food Program strategies that in the past have focused primarily on rural areas and refugee resettlements [98] .",

Fire is a major hazard in slum areas. Crowded and highly flammable tinderbox dwellings with often illegal and unsafe electrification and open fires for cooking that use solid fuel or kerosene invite fires that are often uncontrollable. In such an environment, fires spread quickly. Once one shack is ignited, adjacent structures quickly incinerate. Because many cities do not recognize these informal settlements, fire departments are not responsible for responding and even if they do, there is no infrastructure for piped water to extinguish the flames. As a result, whole communities are lost and families are forced to fend for themselves once again [103] . Less dramatic but extremely common are household burns from scalding. Research has consistently shown that pediatric burns are much greater in slum areas and are the result of disorganized homes, lower maternal education, and/or lack of parental supervision [104] [105] [106] .",

In families in which the mother had no formal education, the odds of an unintentional poisoning were 4.2. Socioeconomic status is a strong risk factor for poisonings because of limited or no storage space at all to guard dangerous substances and keep them out of reach of children, and the risk is even greater as many parents in slums are less aware of the dangers these items present.",

In other words, slums and the conditions that lead to their existence perpetuate and encourage violence. Based on surveys conducted among children and adolescents in urban areas of Colombia, the Democratic Republic of Congo, C\u00f4 te d'Ivoire, Gaza, Mali, Sierra Leone, and the West Bank, the WB finds that ''the main motivations young people cited for becoming rebels or gang members are very similar-unemployment, idleness, [seeking] self-respect, and self-protection, all well ahead of revenge, injustice, or belief in the cause'' [109] . Even if children do not join gangs or militias, or are victims of violence, the chronic experience of living in an insecure, violent atmosphere can have a severe adverse effect on the development of children. Child exposure to crime and violence, both in developing and developed countries, has been associated with poor academic performance and higher school dropout rates, aggression, anxiety, depression, and other behavior problems [110] .",

Approaches can be arranged into 2 major strategies: top-down or bottom-up. Top-down approaches usually involve governmental or nongovernmental agencies undertaking broad-scale programs. Bottom-up approaches generally are community-based initiatives that use community resources internal to the slums to bring about change from within. Both of these strategies may involve more fundamental infrastructure changes and include improving housing structure, developing roadways, and access to water and sanitation that have a distal impact on health. Interventions that work to effect more immediate change in health outcomes include improved access to quality health care and respectable local schools and the training of community health workers. There are success stories in both of these strategies. This section highlights several examples of programs that have reduced health disparities in the urban poor.",

The focus is to fund city development projects and slum upgrading projects that address issues from a physical, social, economic, organizational, and environmental perspective. It seeks to integrate a top-down approach but also enlists community involvement from local citizens, community groups, and business partners. All aspects of slum upgrading were allowed to be addressed by proposals including development of infrastructure, removal of environmental hazards, construction of community facilities, improved access to social development, and development of a land tenure system. To date, nearly 400 projects in developing nations have been funded through Cities Alliance addressing multiple aspects of slum improvement [117] .",

A recent analysis was made of the effects of upgrading in Ahmedabad, India, a city with more than 3.9 million people, 40% of whom reside in slums. The strategy was solely infrastructure improvement and included connections to a water supply for individual households, toilets and underground sewage for individual households, storm water drainage, stone paving of internal and approach roads, solid waste management, and street lighting. Participating individuals paid the equivalent of $40 USD to participate. An assessment of insurance claims data from the local micro-insurance cooperative demonstrated a highly significant reduction in diarrheal disease from 32.0% to 13.5%. To get at the core of slum rejuvenation, one must address urban poverty. This requires a long-lasting commitment to make improvements that take a long and sustained concerted effort. Communities in Bahia (Salvador), Brazil, and their partners have demonstrated this commitment through a near decadelong endeavor to improve the lives of people living in the Alagados district of Salvador. Alagados long stood as one of the worst areas in Brazil. Despite multiple governmental interventions from the 1960s to 1990s, permanent change was never achieved. In the 1990s,the existing Novos Alagados scheme joined with the Ribiera Azul initiative, a cooperative of Cities Alliance that provided technical support from the Bahia state government and the Italian government. The area was divided into 2 regions: one slated for infrastructure and social improvements and one restricted to only social improvements. The infrastructure improvements included access to main roads, storm water drainage, water supply, basic sanitation, and solid waste collection, whereas the social improvements in both sectors included health, education, provision of day care centers, food and nutritional aid, support for young people and children at risk, professional skills training, and income generation through providing support to local cooperatives. Although no health outcome changes were assessed, there were significant improvements in factors associated with improved health outcomes. From 2000 to 2006, garbage collection improved from 50% to 80%, water network connection increased from 37% to 71%, electricity 72% to 88%, sewage 21% to 84%, and homes without sanitary facilities decreased from 31% to 3%. In addition, social programs trained 1339 social agents, 306 individuals trained in job skills, and 68 young people found jobs [119] .",

Increased infrastructure spending can also encourage families to make self-improvements to their housing [121, 122] . Furthermore, investment in shared infrastructure, including access to clean water, sanitation, and power supply, can serve as a means for preventing the formation of new slums, reducing the health burden faced by slum dwellers and delivering major benefits in economic growth, poverty alleviation, and environmental sustainability.",

They are designed to develop the capacity of individuals and communities negotiating and coordinating with existing institutions and government to improve their own health. Several models of successful empowerment programs are illustrated [123] . BRAC (Bangladesh Rural Action Committee) started as a relief organization in 1972 in a remote rural village in Bangladesh. It has expanded to 11 countries in Asia, Africa, the Caribbean, and, most recently, the Philippines. BRAC is reportedly the largest development organization in the world, touching the lives of 126 million people. The basis of its operation is organizing poor communities using their own human and material resources ''creating an ecosystem in which the poor have the chance to seize control of their own lives.'' BRAC works with the marginalized and the disadvantaged who have been excluded from the mainstream. The focus is on women (women make up 95% of the membership) and on organizing the poor through Village Organizations (VOs). Each VO has 30 to 40 women with access to a variety of services, such as microfinance, education, health care, agriculture, handicrafts, environmental sustainability, and disaster preparedness, as well as social and legal issues. A central goal is to empower women who in their homes have had little decision making, but as a group can come together to voice their concerns and offer advice and solutions for community problems. They influence change. BRAC works under the premise that people are not poor because they have no potential but because they lack opportunities. The goal of BRAC is to provide individuals with opportunities and unleash the potential.",

Diarrheal morbidity in the intervention group was 41% less than the control group [123] . Low-cost interventions to improve behavior have also improved exclusive breastfeeding rates in Kenyan slums.

Individuals residing in slums rank low on the social gradient and political agendas. The lower the socioeconomic position a person occupies, the worse the health and the lower the life expectancy. Some of the specific social determinates that affect health include the wealth index of the household, the employment of the head of the household, the presence of the mother to care for the children, the level of social support, the degree of crowding within the home, the educational attainment of the mother, food security, access to clean potable water, sufficient sanitary facilities, and available close-by quality health services and schools. Slum dwellers score low on these determinates. These social determinates of health are largely responsible for the great differences in the types of morbidities, the severity of illnesses, and the level of access to treatment for them. Although country-level disparities are readily apparent, many statistics internal to a nation merely dichotomize by urban versus rural. This hides the slum outcomes in the urban figures, thereby worsening the urban figures and making rural dwellers a bit better off than all those who live in the city. Yet in reality, rural dwellers fair better than those who live in slums, but far worse than those urbanites that do not live in slums [81] . Household-level factors, combined with an overarching lack of recognition from local and national governments, manifested through lack of land rights, exclusion from census, and lack of investment in schools and health care centers delivers the message of ''no worth''; the ultimate in exclusion. Many slum communities border on the edge of the wealthy urbanite communities, accentuating the divide between the populations. This added stress enhances morbidities and shortens lives.",

In addition, pediatricians can facilitate those from marginalized populations accessing health care by removing the barriers of misperceptions of families and judgmental attitudes of providers. Many marginalized groups are hesitant to access even existing health care facilities when the staff and clinicians are seen as nonresponsive to their needs or lack understanding of their cultural beliefs [126] . Learning more about the communities and getting involved can go a long way in making in-roads in the receptivity of parents to simple behavior modifications that will improve child health.

To allow children to grow up in slums even violates the convention's preamble: ''Recalling that, in the Universal Declaration of Human Rights, the United Nations has proclaimed that childhood is entitled to special care and assistance, Convinced that the family, as the fundamental group of society and the natural environment for the growth and well-being of all its members and particularly children, should be afforded the necessary protection and assistance so that it can fully assume its responsibilities within the community, Recognizing that the child, for the full and harmonious development of his or her personality, should grow up in a family environment, in an atmosphere of happiness, love and understanding.'' And Article 27: ''1. States Parties recognize the right of every child to a standard of living adequate for the child's physical, mental, spiritual, moral and social development. 2. The parent(s) or others responsible for the child have the primary responsibility to secure, within their abilities and financial capacities, the conditions of living necessary for the child's development. 3 . States Parties, in accordance with national conditions and within their means, shall take appropriate measures to assist parents and others responsible for the child to implement this right and shall in case of need provide material assistance and support programs, particularly with regard to nutrition, clothing and housing.''",

            "text": "The cycle of family poverty reaching its zenith in slum dwellers predetermines that the children will be malnourished, have repeated bouts of illness, and lack even basic education, all of which ensnares the young adult in lowpaying jobs or no job at all, perpetuating the cycle of poverty. Families stuck in the morass of slum living cannot emerge without some assistance. A just and fair society demands that governments recognize this growing population and accept the responsibility of providing the basic services and the opportunities to extract families from this vicious cycle; some governments have done so and more are attempting to do so. NGOs usually accept 1 or 2 pieces of the puzzle and often do a good job. Pediatricians are in a unique position to assist families at a household level to break the cycle. These providers are thrown into the arena in caring for children who are affected by this dynamic. They may act as a bridge for mother and child to see opportunities outside of the slums. It is our challenge to take a holistic view and see the children as the pivotal point and do everything possible to intercept the cycle and prevent its recurrence. Apply the strategies of ''positive deviants'' and learn from the families who are doing well and invite them to teach those who are not. Educate local community health workers Discuss with these influential women and encourage them to empower the mothers in slum areas. It is they who will make a difference and your interest and encouragement will help. (Pediatricians know how to educate mothers and spend their lives empowering mothers to take charge of their lives and the lives of their children.) [125] Study the pertinent international conventions (Convention on the Rights of the Child) and the policies of the government Add the appropriate articles of the conventions to your discussions with your colleagues and those in power. Advocate while there Encourage your local colleagues to discuss the inequalities with those in political position to improve the lives of children and their families. Advocate while at home Bring the plight of these children to the attention of your representatives and your friends: expose the injustices. Investigate and learn the problems Go beyond the direct medical problem at hand and inquire about health behaviors at home to address underlying issues if possible.",
