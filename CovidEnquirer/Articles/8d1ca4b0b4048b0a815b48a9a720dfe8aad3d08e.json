            "text": "Despite enormous advances in medical sciences and their applications in public health, infectious diseases remain a central challenge for public health in the twenty-first century. Of particular concern are human immunodeficiency virus/ acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (HIV/AIDS), tuberculosis (TB), malaria, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), avian flu, and antibiotic-resistant infections (superbugs), among others. Globalization has facilitated the spread of many infectious agents to all corners of the globe. Mass travel, economic globalization, and climate change, along with accelerating urbanization of human populations, are causing environmental disruption, including global warming. There are and will be more consequences in international transmission of infectious diseases than are now known, in humans and wildlife, as well as domestic animals in the food chain.",

Eradication refers to the total elimination of the organism from nature; elimination designates a stop in the circulation of the organism locally; and control means reducing the disease as a public health problem. All of these require a systems approach using available resources, conducting research, and effectively mobilizing environmental measures. This must be carried out in conjunction with strengthening primary care and the overarching health care framework. Rapid transportation and communication make a virus outbreak in any part of the world an international concern, both for health professionals and for the general public. With rapid changes in our understanding of basic sciences, and in vaccine research, production, and associated measures, it is incumbent upon all medical and allied professionals, educators, policy makers, and students entering the field to have a working understanding of the exciting and dynamic advances. Here, the interesting overlap between communicable diseases and non-communicable diseases (NCDs) becomes evident and imperative. Furthermore, it is crucial to be aware of the social environment in which the risk and exposure of vulnerable groups and individuals cause greatly varying degrees of morbidity and mortality in populations.",

The emergence of the germ theory in the late nineteenth century led to the sciences of bacteriology and immunology, growing out of the work of Jenner, Pasteur, Koch, Lister, and many others (see Chapter 1). The control of vaccine-preventable diseases (VPDs) has been a boon to humankind, saving countless lives and providing a cornerstone for public health. Despite this, millions of children still die annually from preventable or readily treatable diseases, such as respiratory infections, diarrheal diseases, and measles. Infectious diseases of childhood are still tragically undercontrolled internationally. Infectious diseases also undermine the health of other vulnerable groups in the population, such as the elderly, the socially and economically most disadvantaged, and the chronically ill, thereby playing a major role in the economics of health care.",

Virulence describes the severity of clinical disease and may vary among serotypes or strains of the same agent. The environment provides a reservoir for the organism and the mode of transmission by which the organism reaches a new host. The reservoir is the natural habitat where an infectious agent lives and multiplies, from which it can be transmitted directly or indirectly to a new host. Reservoirs may be in people, animals, arthropods, avians, reptiles, plants, soil, or substances in which an organism normally lives and multiplies, and on which it depends for survival or in which it survives in a dormant form.

Bacteria may produce a toxin or poison that can affect a body site distant from where the bacterial replication occurs, such as in tetanus. Bacteria may also initiate an excessive immune response, producing damage to other body tissues away from the site of infection (e.g., acute rheumatic fever and glomerulonephritis).",

Direct transmission from one host to another occurs during touching, biting, kissing, sexual intercourse, projection via droplets, as in sneezing, coughing, or spitting, or by entry through the skin. Indirect transmission includes aerosols of long-lasting suspended particles in air; this can be central among passengers on an aircraft being exposed to a TB patient or a measles carrier. Fecal-oral transmission such as foodborne and waterborne can occur easily, as well as by poor hygienic conditions with fomites, such as soiled clothes, handkerchiefs, toys, or other objects. Waterborne and foodborne diseases are still among the most common causes of death, particularly of children in low-income countries with poor infrastructure for water and sewage management. This situation is exacerbated by crowded and unhygienic housing and by the effects of poverty on sanitation, nutrition, and access to health care. Transmission in medical settings is common, yet preventable by hand washing and consistent use of sterile techniques and cleaning procedures. The use of face masks, hand washing, gloves, gowns, and tissues when sneezing are all vital in implementing practices to reduce the spread of hospital-acquired infections and influenza. Promoting these simple measures is of utmost importance as hospital-acquired infections represent a major cause of morbidity and result in extended hospital stay, thus significantly elevating economic costs. Sterile practices among health care and hospital workers should certainly be made a priority. The use of bed nets and vector control for malaria are among the most effective ways of reducing the burden of this highly dangerous disease.",

Carrier status with persistent viremia is estimated by CDC to be 1.25 million in the USA, with 4.9 percent of the population ever infected. Carrier rates are 5-8 percent in sub-Saharan Africa but between 8 and 15 percent of babies become infected in some parts of the world, thus routine immunization is recommended. Carriers have detectable levels of HBsAg, the surface antigen (i.e., Australian antigen), in their blood. In 2006, an estimated 27 percent of newborns worldwide received a dose of hepatitis B vaccine and 69 percent of the 2008 birth cohort had three doses of hepatitis B vaccine. By 2011, the hepatitis B vaccine was an integral part of national immunization programs in 179 countries (WHO, 2013). Transmission from mother to child and between children by unsafe injections is common, as is infection via sexual contact. It is crucial for the following high-risk groups in developed countries to be immunized: health care workers, intravenous drug users, men who have sex with men, people with high numbers of sexual partners, those receiving tattoos, body piercing, or acupuncture treatments, and residents or staff of institutions such as group homes and prisons. Immunocompromised and hemodialysis patients are commonly carriers of HBV. HBV may also be spread in a health system by use of inadequately sterilized reusable syringes, as has occurred in China and the former Soviet Union. Transmission is reduced by screening blood and blood products for HBsAg. Strict technique for handling blood and body fluids in health care settings is absolutely essential and greatly reduces the risk of transmission.",

The effort was stopped after millions of people were immunized with an urgently produced vaccine when serious reactions occurred (Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, a type of paralysis) and when no further cases of swine flu were seen.

Influenza can cause severe illness among pregnant women, placing them at high risk owing to changes to the immune system, lungs, and heart during pregnancy. Pregnant women suffered excess mortality in previous influenza pandemics, such as in 1918, 1957, and 2009. To protect her health, as well as that of her unborn baby, a pregnant woman is strongly advised to receive an influenza vaccine, regardless of the trimester. The CDC Advisory Committee on Immunization Practices as well as the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists support this recommendation. The inactivated influenza vaccine has proven to be safe, with no adverse effects in pregnant women or their infants. The vaccine is not designed for infants aged < 6 months, so maternal immunity is key to protecting newborns.",

Vaccine manufacturers, who spend enormous sums of money and years of research on new products, are more inclined to work on vaccines that will bring great financial rewards for the company and are critical to the local health care community. This has led to less effort being expended on developing vaccines for diseases such as malaria, which affect primarily the developing world. Industry plays a crucial role in continued progress in the field. Therefore, principles and guidelines must be created to establish incentives for research, development, and application of vaccine technology from a global perspective.",

Acute rheumatic fever (ARF) is a complication of Streptococcus A infection that has virtually disappeared from industrialized countries as a result of improved standards of living and antibiotic therapy. Mortality rates from rheumatic fever and rheumatic heart disease have declined steadily over the past three decades, largely due to the increased availability and use of antibiotics. In developing nations and lower socioeconomic areas where rheumatic fever is more prevalent, ARF is a major cause of death and disability in children and adolescents. Moreover, outbreaks were recorded in the USA in 1985, and an increasing number of cases has been seen since 1990. In developing countries, rheumatic fever remains a serious public health problem affecting school-age children, particularly those in crowded living arrangements.

It is a hybrid construct of the hepatitis B surface antigen fused with a recombinant antigen derived from part of the malaria circum-sporozoite protein. This is the protein coat of the sporozoite, the parasite stage inoculated by the feeding anopheline mosquito; it then invades liver cells and multiplies there before entering the bloodstream. Many other potential malaria vaccines are in various stages of development, but the RTS,S/AS01 vaccine is closer to registration and potential deployment than the others (White, 2011).",

RVF is very active and sensitive to climate and other environmental as well as socioeconomic changes, such as occurred with the Nasser Dam in the 1970s. Ecological changes and growing human populations with increased demand for meat promote greater movements of livestock, controlled and uncontrolled. This increases the risk of spread of RVF in the Mediterranean basin, Central Europe, and the Middle East (Chevalier et al., 2010) , as has occurred with other arboviruses. This provides an incentive for intensive research into the vaccinology of RVF virus (Dar et al., 2013) . RVF was in the past considered a potentially seriously disruptive biological warfare agent. The potential methods and effects of deliberate or inadvertent introduction of RVF into the USA via international movement of livestock or as a terrorist act come under the watchful eye of the CDC and security agencies (Hartley et al., 2011) .",

When compared to the estimate for 2006, this figure signifies a 7 percent increase. Another important trend discovered by researchers is that the majority of those infected with HIV did not transmit the virus to others in recent years. Experts estimate that in the USA in 2006, of every 100 people living with HIV, there were five transmissions. Thus, at least 95 percent of HIV-positive people did not transmit the virus to otherwise healthy individuals that year. This represents a significant (89 percent) decline in the approximate rate of HIV transmission since the mid-1980s. The reduction in transmission is likely to be attributable to successful preventive measures, improved testing, and highly effective treatment.",

It was primarily seen among men who have sex with men and recipients of blood products. After initial errors, testing of blood and blood products became standard and subsequently closed off this method of transmission. Transmission has changed markedly since the initial onslaught of the disease, with needle-sharing among intravenous drug users, heterosexual activity, and maternal-fetal transmission becoming major sources of infection. Comorbidity with other STIs apparently increases HIV infectivity and, furthermore, may have helped to convert the epidemiology to a greater degree of heterosexual transmission. The disease grew exponentially in the USA but the incidence of new cases has declined since 1993. AIDS represents a major public health problem in most developed and developing countries, reaching catastrophic proportions in some sub-Saharan African countries, affecting up to 30 percent or more of some populations.",

With increases in longevity and the increased importance of chronic disease in the health status of the industrial and mid-level developing nations, the effects of infectious disease on the care of elderly and chronically ill people are of great importance in the New Public Health. Long-term management of chronic disease needs to address the care of vulnerable groups, promoting the use of existing vaccines and antibiotics. Most important is the development of health systems that provide close monitoring of groups at special risk for infectious disease, especially patients with chronic diseases, the immunocompromised, and the elderly. The combination of traditional public health with direct medical care needed for effective control and eradication of communicable diseases is an essential element of the New Public Health. The challenges include applying a comprehensive approach and managing resources to define and reach achievable targets in communicable disease control.",

The new capacities of vaccines and other methods of control develop slowly, and the advent of effective vaccines for HIV, malaria, and TB will bring untold benefit to the global community. The challenges of natural dispersion of communicable disease can be made more threatening because of the advent of bioterrorism and the emergence of new diseases or the spread of those previously localized in a less mobile, less globalized world. The challenges, the potential for harm, and the benefits that can be achieved in this aspect of public health are enormous.",

Surveillance monitoring of school attendance, Internet reporting and reporting from sentinel pediatric and family physician offices. 3. Identify index cases, possible causes, and contacts. 4. \"Syndromic surveillance\". 5. Confirm the existence of an epidemic, numbers of cases, common factors and exposures, and geographic spread. 6. Orient to person, place, and time of events. 7. Consult with relevant clinicians, and local, state, or national authorities. 8. Use medical data sources routinely collected for other purposes (e.g., emergency room logs). 9. Use non-clinical data (e.g., pharmacy sales, school absenteeism) to trigger alert. 10. Verify the diagnosis: clinical and laboratory. 11. Develop a case definition. 12. Thoroughly review relevant literature. 13. Develop a case report form. 14. Estimate the numbers from count of index cases and approximation analysis. 15. Orient data: time, place, person, common exposures. 16. Analyze the data: agent, transmission, vector, and host. 17. Use CDC's free Epi Info program. Available at: http://wwwn.cdc.gov/epiinfo/html/downloads.htm (last updated 13 February 2013). 18. Develop a hypothesis. 19. Test the hypothesis, e.g. with case controlled studies matching sick people with similar non-sick people. 20. Plan and institute control and prevent further cases. 21. Take legal action to withdraw drugs, food, water, or other causative factors. 22. Ensure compliance and evaluate the implemented measures. 23. Establish or improve the public health surveillance. 24. Write reports to home office and local authorities. 25. Keep local, state and federal officials, health providers and the public informed. 26. Plan and conduct additional studies. 27. Use the experience for teaching purposes. 28. Publish in peer-reviewed journals. 29. Follow-up on the outbreak and the literature. 30. Go home to your family and tell them all about it. : Adapted from: Brachmen PS, Thacker SB. Evolution of epidemic investigations and field epidemiology during the MMWR era at CDC -1961-2011.

In the case of blinding tra choma, the use of the recommended strategy (SAFE) of an effec tive antibiotic is leading to its local eradication where applied vigorously. A second group of NTDs are diseases for which the main option currently available is systematic case-finding and early case man agement. These include Buruli ulcer, Chagas disease, and other diarrheal diseases, human Afri can trypanosomiasis, and leishmaniasis. Simple diagnostic tools and safe and effective treatment regimens need to be developed urgently for some of these diseases. However, even for these infec tions, systematic use of the present, albeit imperfect tools at an early stage can dramatically reduce mortality and morbidity. For others, vector control tools are available and present the main method of transmission control, as in the case of Chagas disease. Worldwide, 149 countries and territories are affected by at least one neglected tropical disease (NTD). This includes setting six targets for the elimination of five neglected tropical diseases by 2015; a further 10 elimination targets are set for 2020 either globally or in selected geographical areas for nine neglected tropical diseases. Targets are also set for intensified control of dengue, Buruli ulcer, cutaneous leishmaniasis, selected zoonoses and helminthiases. This will require close cooperation between international agencies, national governments and international donors. With adequate support great progress can be made in the coming decade on these debilitating and often lethal conditions. : World Health Organization. Neglected tropical diseases.

            "text": "Acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS) was first reported as a clinical entity in 1981 by Dr Michael Gottlieb at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) Hospital. He reported in Morbidity and Mortality Weekly Report and later the New England Journal of Medicine on five cases of Pneumocystis carinii (now P. jiroveci) pneumonia with cytomegaloviremia (CMV) among young male homosexuals with evidence of immune deficiency. A few weeks later, Dr Alvin Friedman-Kien reported 26 cases of Kaposi's sarcoma in gay men from New York and California.In 1983, heterosexual infection and maternal-fetal transmission were identified, and the human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) was isolated from an AIDS patient. By the mid-1980s HIV/ AIDS had become a global pandemic. In 1985, the first HIV test was approved and used for testing blood donations, and public recognition of the pandemic was growing. Zidovudine (AZT) treatment became available in 1987. In 1992, the FDA licensed the first rapid HIV test. During 1996-1999, a treatment cocktail of antiretroviral therapy was approved to reduce viral loads, and death rates dropped by 40 percent in the USA.A safer and more effective combination of drugs was used in 1998-2000. The Global Fund was established in 2001-2002 to fight HIV/AIDS, but treatment remained unavailable to the over 4 million HIV carriers in sub-Saharan Africa and AIDS was the leading cause of death among people in the age group 15-59 years. In 2003-2005, President George W. Bush provided US$15 billion in aid to HIV/AIDS treatment in 15 heavily affected countries. In 2006-2007, UNAIDS recommended adult male circumcision after evidence of its effectiveness in reducing HIV transmission in high-prevalence areas; HIV vaccine trials failed, but new candidate vaccines were beingdeveloped. In 2008, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention indicated that there were more cases than previously thought, with 1.1 million Americans being affected, while the number of new cases again increased rapidly.",

This is partially because the director of the research conducted in Guatemala, John Cutler, a US Public Health Service medical officer, also served as an investigator in the Tuskegee experiments. Moreover, further evidence indicates that the Surgeon General at that time, General Thomas Parran Jr, knew of the nature of the experiments Cutler and his colleagues were conducting.An official apology was subsequently rendered to the government of Guatemala. The US Presidential Commission on Bioethics has highlighted this case as an awakener to ensure that something of this magnitude, grossly violating the rights of study participants, is never repeated. Current regulations dictate rules for medical research on human participants. These regulations are indispensable requirements for researchers and funding agencies, and limitations for publication. Implementation of and appropriate compliance with the regulations are equally important. Ignoring this protection for study participants in research in another country does not absolve anyone from responsibility and compliance towards ethical standards.Deception was a major factor in this study of participants recruited from vulnerable populations. This notorious experiment undermined human rights, medicine, ethics, and the principle of protecting patients. Effort to determine new treatments and advances in medicine with the intention of helping patients must be conducted according to internationally accepted rules of procedure, such as those of the Helsinki Declaration of 1964 and its subsequent formulations (see Chapter 15). 1946 -1948 : another tragic history lesson.
