However, the ecologic and evolutionary factors that constrain or facilitate such emergences are poorly understood. We propose a conceptual framework based on the pathogen's between-and within-species transmission rates to describe possible configurations of a multihost-pathogen community that may lead to disease emergence. We establish 3 dynamic thresholds separating 4 classes of disease outcomes, spillover, apparent multihost, true multihost, and potential emerging infectious disease; describe possible disease emergence scenarios; outline the population dynamics of each case; and clarify existing terminology. We highlight the utility of this framework with examples of disease threats in human and wildlife populations, showing how it allows us to understand which ecologic factors affect disease emergence and predict the impact of host shifts in a range of disease systems.",

However, most pathogens can infect several host species; >60% of human pathogens, >68% of wild primate parasites, and >90% of domesticated animal pathogens infect multiple host species (1) (2) (3) . An interest in multihost pathogens is particularly timely, given that many of the most threatening current pathogens (e.g., HIV, West Nile virus, influenza virus, Ebola virus) are believed to have crossed species barriers to infect humans, domesticated animals, or wildlife populations (1, (3) (4) (5) (6) (7) (8) . However, we do not know the host and pathogen characteristics that determine such host shifts and the likely characteristics of future emerging infectious diseases. To address this issue, 2 theoretical approaches have been adopted. The first, using dynamic models, focuses on the host's perspective and ascertains how a shared pathogen affects the dynamics of 2 host populations (9) (10) (11) (12) . The second approach takes the pathogen's point of view and considers how combined host densities affect pathogen persistence within the community (13) (14) (15) . However, as the number of studies grows, so does the terminology. Terms such as multihost pathogens, dead-end hosts, reservoir hosts, host shifts, and spillovers are frequently used, but often different phrases are used to describe the same phenomenon, and possibly more concerning, the same terminology may be used to describe strictly different phenomena.",

            "text": "This lack of consolidation makes it unclear how these different approaches relate in terms of understanding the mechanisms driving disease emergence. A need exists for a single, comprehensive framework that characterizes disease outcomes based on biologically meaningful processes. Recently, attempts have been made to reconcile these concepts, mainly by highlighting the role of reservoir hosts (13, 16) . Haydon et al. (13) proposed a conceptual model that assumed a target host species was exposed to a pathogen endemic in a second host species (or species complex). The outcome of infection then depended on the sizes of the populations and whether they were able to maintain the pathogen alone. This approach expanded the naive view that reservoirs are nonpathogenic, singlespecies populations and encompassed the complexity of pathogen-host communities observed in nature. However, focusing just on host density ignores many key features of emerging diseases. The likelihood of disease emergence will depend on highly dynamic processes determined by both between-and within-species transmission rates. Therefore, ecologic forces acting on both hosts and pathogens will influence the contact structure of the community and affect the likelihood and persistence of an emerging infectious disease in a new host.",

We then assume a second target host population (H 2 ) enters the community and can become infected by the pathogen ( Figure 1A ). Since the pathogen is well established in H 1 , we assume S 1 and I 1 are unchanged by H 2 ; thus, our model most closely resembles the asymmetric model of Dobson (15) .

Therefore, we must investigate population dynamic properties of different regions of the continuum and regions that pose the greatest risk for a target host. In a deterministic model, the invasion and persistence thresholds are the same and are determined by the pathogen's basic reproductive ratio (R 0 ); if R 0 >1, an initial infection can both become established and persist. As shown by Dobson (15) , R 0 for a pathogen in an asymmetric host community (with no back-transmission from the target host to the reservoir) is dominated by the largest within-species transmission term, which implies that infection dynamics in the 2 host populations are largely independent; once between-species transmission has occurred, infection in H 2 is driven solely by within-H 2 transmission. However, in the stochastic reality of the natural world, an established infection may fade out, and reinfection from H 1 could occur in the future (19) . Therefore, we developed a stochastic analog of the above deterministic model to explore dynamics of the community-epidemiology continuum. The model was a discrete-time Monte Carlo simulation model, in which each event in model 1 (births, deaths, between-and within-species transmission) occurred probabilistically, and the next event was chosen at random based on those probabilities. The model was run 100 times for different combinations of within-and between-species transmission rates, and the infection status of the target host (H 2 ) was measured as the mean prevalence over time, the proportion of time the pathogen was absent from H 2 (the proportion of time the pathogen faded out), and the proportion of runs in which the pathogen drove the host to extinction. This stochastic model is appropriate for exploring the dynamics of emerging infectious diseases not captured by continuoustime deterministic models, in particular when exposure of a target host to a pathogen from a reservoir is likely to occur at discrete intervals (27) .",

Increasing the exposure of H 2 to the pathogen (i.e., increasing \u03b2 12 ) leads to a gradual increase in both the prevalence of infection and the proportion of time the pathogen is present in H 2 . This increase applies even if within-H 2 transmission is negligible (\u03b2 22 \u2192 0). Therefore, regular, high exposure to the pathogen from the reservoir can give the appearance of endemic infection, even if the pathogen cannot be sustained within the population (case 2: apparent multihost dynamics). Increasing the within-H 2 transmission rate (\u03b2 22 ) from very low levels has little impact on the prevalence of infection or the proportion of time H 2 is infected. Eventually, however, a point is reached at which increasing \u03b2 22 suddenly allows the long-term persistence of the pathogen in H 2 . At this point, the persistence threshold is reached and the pathogen becomes endemic in H 2 , regardless of input from H 1 . This threshold can be approximated from the deterministic model by setting \u03b2 12 = 0 and solving for R 0 = 1, which shows that \u03b2 22 must be > (d + r)/K for the pathogen to persist in the absence of input from H 1 (the horizontal line in Figure 3 ).",

Analysis of the equivalent deterministic model (model 1) suggests that this threshold should be in the between-species transmission rate (\u03b2 12 ) only (host extinction is not affected by \u03b2 22 ) and is given by \u03b2 12 > dr/(d -r) for H 2 extinction to occur (shown by the vertical line in Figure 3 ). Thus, even if the probability that H 2 will contract the pathogen is very low (\u03b2 12 \u2192 0), a single transmission event may spark an epidemic that completely decimates the population (region 3).",

Haydon et al. (13) proposed 3 means of controlling infection in a targetreservoir system: 1) target control, which is aimed at controlling infection within the target population; 2) blocking tactics, to prevent transmission between the reservoir and target host population; and 3) reservoir control, which suppresses infection within the reservoir. These 3 control strategies correspond to reducing the within-and betweenspecies transmission rates (\u03b2 22 , \u03b2 12 , and \u03b2 11 , respectively). The benefits of each approach will vary according to the relative contributions different transmission processes where black represents zero prevalence and white represents 100% prevalence, and B) Proportion of time in which the pathogen is absent (i.e., has faded out) from H 2 , where white represents zero fade-outs (i.e., the pathogen is always present in H 2 ) and black represents 100% fade-outs (i.e., the pathogen never infects H 2 ). C) Probability of pathogen-driven host extinction, where black represents the case in which all runs resulted in host extinction and white the case in which none of the runs resulted in host extinction. The horizontal dashed lines are the deterministic approximation threshold. The points marked A and B in panel A and the associated arrows represent different control scenarios for 2-host pathogen systems located at different points within the continuum (see text for details). make to the overall prevalence in the new host (H 2 ). Our stochastic model showed that high exposure to the pathogen from the reservoir host can give the appearance of endemic infection in the target host, even if it cannot sustain the pathogen alone. In this case, the optimal control strategy is completely different from that used against a true multihost pathogen endemic in the target host. For a host-pathogen system in region 2 of the continuum (apparent multihost dynamics), where between-species transmission rates are high but within-H 2 transmission rates are low (point A in Figure 3A ), the prevalence of infection in H 2 may be very high, but mounting a target control program aimed at reducing within-H 2 transmission is unlikely to be effective (the vertical arrow from point A in Figure 3A ). However, blocking control, which would reduce transmission from the reservoir to the target host, may drastically reduce prevalence (the horizontal arrow from point A in Figure 3A ). Conversely, similar levels of prevalence in H 2 may be observed for a host-pathogen system located in region 4 of the continuum (point B in Figure 3A ) but because of fundamentally different processes. In this case, blocking tactics aimed at preventing transmission from the reservoir to the target host will be ineffectual (horizontal arrow from point B in Figure 3A ), but target control may prove highly effective (vertical arrow from point B in Figure 3A ). Therefore, establishing the initial location of a novel host-pathogen system within the community-epidemiology continuum and understanding the within-and between-species transmission rates are essential for optimizing vaccination and culling strategies to lessen the impact of disease.",

Using this framework, we outlined 4 possible cases of long-term disease dynamics in the target host and showed that these outcomes occupy different regions of a 2-dimensional continuum described by the net between-and within-species transmission rates. Furthermore, the development of the community-epidemiology framework allows us to clarify the wealth of terminology currently used to describe disease occurrence in host communities, based on an understanding of the underlying ecologic and epidemiologic processes. In particular, the much-overused terms reservoir and spillover can be seen to have explicit definitions, depending on whether the pathogen can be sustained within the target host population.",
