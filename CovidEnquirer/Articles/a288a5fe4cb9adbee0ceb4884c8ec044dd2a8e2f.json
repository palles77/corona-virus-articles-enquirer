All domestic species are immunocompetent at birth although additional maturation of the immune response will occur during the neonatal period. The main obstacle to successful vaccination in young animals is the presence of blocking levels of maternally-derived antibodies. The positive influence of maternal immunity with regard to protection against infection becomes negative facing vaccine inoculation. Ideally, the vaccine should allow immunisation of the animal at the age when it first becomes susceptible to infection, prior to decline of maternally-derived antibodies below protective levels. This is rarely achieved and is a major problem with canine parvovirus in an infected kennel. As maternally-derived antibodies decline, there is a critical period of time during which neonates have too much antibody to respond to a vaccine but not enough to resist a field infection. This window of susceptibility makes it difficult to raise healthy animals in heavily contaminated environment despite well-designed vaccination schedules.",
