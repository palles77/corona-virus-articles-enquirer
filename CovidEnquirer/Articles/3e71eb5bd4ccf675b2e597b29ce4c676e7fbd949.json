            "text": "The acute respiratory illnesses are the most common type of acute illness in the United States today. The respiratory viruses-which include influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), rhinoviruses, coronaviruses, and adenoviruses-cause the majority of these illnesses. Some of these viruses cause illness throughout the year, whereas others are most common in winter. All population groups experience these infections and illnesses. As the number of elderly persons and those with underlying disease increases, awareness is growing that these common infections can have serious consequences. This has recently been emphasized for immunocompromised persons. At the M.D. Anderson Cancer Center (MDACC), infection surveillance of mostly hospitalized adults with leukemia or a recent bone marrow transplant yielded a respiratory virus from 181 of 668 (27.1%) respiratory illness episodes. In descending order of frequency, infections with RSV, rhinoviruses, influenza viruses, parainfluenza viruses, and adenoviruses were detected in each of three surveillance years. High frequencies of nosocomial acquisition occurred, as has been noted in prior reports. Similarly, persistence of infection and high frequencies of pneumonia and death among infected patients occurred, which have also been noted earlier. At MDACC, pneumonia occurred in 58-78% of infected patients, and 22-44% died. The role of the virus infection in many cases of pneumonia is uncertain, but death from pure viral pneumonia is well documented. A number of immune deficiencies in this patient population and options for control of these infections have been described that can, respectively, account for the medical problem and provide ways to approach prevention and treatment.

Infection with a respiratory virus is the most common cause of an acute respiratory condition.

This includes persons of all ages, the healthy and the unhealthy, and the immunocompetent and the immunocompromised. The unusual severity of illnesses occurring among immunocompromised persons infected with a respiratory virus has been emphasized recently.

Respiratory viral infections occur throughout the year, although they are more common in winter than in summer. They affect persons of all ages, but their incidence is higher among children than among adults. Infection may be asymptomatic or induce a severe and lethal infection. A variety of complications of viral respiratory infection have been described; most notable are secondary bacterial infections causing otitis media, sinusitis, or pneumonia. In these cases, a respiratory virus infection impairs the defense mechanisms that keep these anatomic sites free from infection with bacteria. Among the other described complications are post-infectious encephalitis, the Guillain-Barr\u00e9 syndrome, Reyes syndrome after influenza in children, and disseminated intravascular coagulation with influenza.",

Sampling was limited to hospitalized patients with leukemia and hospitalized or clinic patients who had recently received a bone marrow transplant. A combined nasal wash and throat swab specimen was tested for virus as described previously. 2 A total of 668 illness episodes were sampled for virus: 235 isolates were obtained from sampling of 223 illness episodes; \u00fa1 virus was isolated for 12 episodes. Thus, 33.4% of respiratory illness episodes in these mostly hospitalized patients yielded a virus. When herpes simplex virus and cytomegalovirus isolations were excluded, 181 (27.1%) episodes were virus positive; two episodes yielded two respiratory viruses. It should be emphasized that 27.1% represents a minimal estimate of the frequency of infection with a respiratory virus among these patients with an ARI, since serology was not done and repeat sampling was minimal. The distribution of isolates according to type of respiratory virus is shown in Table IV . As noted, each of the major respiratory viruses was detected in each year of sampling. The most commonly detected virus was RSV, followed closely by the picornaviruses. Of picornaviruses that were further categorized, 90% were rhinoviruses and 10% were enteroviruses. Influenza A or B virus was present each year, as were parainfluenza viruses; 92% of the parainfluenza viruses were type 3. 3 The adenovirus isolates have not been typed.",

Although overall frequencies of pneumonia and death appear similar for each virus, analysis of patterns of occurrences suggested a greater severity for RSV infection after bone marrow transplantation or chemotherapy than for the other viruses. Moreover, the apparent value of early aerosol ribavirin and intravenous immunoglobulin (IV Ig) therapy for RSV reduced the overall frequencies for that virus. 8 The role of the virus infection in causing the pneumonia and death is uncertain in many of these patients, who frequently have multiple infections.

A variety of nonspecific defenses contribute to resistance to infection and recovery from infection. These defenses include the mucous layer covering the respiratory mucosa, fever, the inflammatory response, a and b interferon, and nonspecifically activated phagocytes. The primary defense against acquisition of a specific virus is antibody to that virus, whereas the primary mechanisms for recovery are both humoral (antibody) and cell-mediated immune responses. Current information indicates that the primary immunoglobulin and antibody in the upper respiratory passage is polymeric IgA that is formed locally in submucosal tissues in response to antigen and transported across epithelial cells into upper respiratory secretions. 23 With descent into the lower respiratory passage, the proportion of 7s IgG in secretions increases, as does the proportion of 7s IgG antibody. 24 This antibody is derived primarily from serum. Thus, following infection, the major antibody protecting the nasopharynx is considered to be IgA, whereas that protecting the lower respiratory passages is IgG. Both types of antibody can, however, be present at both sites, and both antibody types are desirable for optimal protection against a specific virus.",

            "text": "Once infection occurs, immune defenses are activated to eliminate the infection and thereby bring about recovery from illness. Both a and b interferon act early in infection and are important nonspecific mechanisms for promoting elimination of infection. Specific antibodies that are induced may contribute to virus elimination in a variety of ways, including aggregation for clearance, opsonization, and early lysis of infected cells; lysis may be complement mediated or represent antibody-dependent cell-mediated cytotoxicity (ADCC). The major specific cell-mediated immune response promoting recovery is CD8 T lymphocyte-mediated cytotoxicity. This mechanism has been shown to be of major importance in myxovirus and paramyxovirus infections in animal models. 25, 26 A number of immune deficiencies have been described in immunocompromised persons that would be reflected in one or more deficiencies of the immune mediators summarized above. Lum 27 has described deficiencies after bone marrow transplantation, a circumstance representing an extreme degree of immune deficiency. These patients exhibit B lymphocyte impairment manifested by a reduced ability of B cells to respond to stimulatory cytokines, such as IL-4, reduced serum immunoglobulin levels, and depressed primary and secondary responses to antigens. Deficiencies in T cell function are indicated by reduced CD4 lymphocyte and CD4/CD8 cell ratios, reduced T helper cell and increased suppressor cell activity, reduced proliferative responses, reduced delayed-type hypersensitivity responses, and reduced CD8 lymphocyte cytotoxic function. Reduced neutrophil numbers and function are of major importance for the occurrence and control of bacterial infection; but, except for an ability to mediate ADCC, no role for neutrophils in defense against these virus infections has been suggested.",

            "text": "Also accompanying the chemotherapy used in many transplant cases is the occurrence of mucositis with the loss of mucosal integrity and possibly IgA antibody occurrence in the upper respiratory passages. 27 Reduced mucosal integrity and local IgA antibody would lead to increased susceptibility to upper respiratory infection, while reduced serum antibody levels would increase susceptibility to lower respiratory infection. Although increased susceptibility to infection in immunocompromised patients has not been proven, Kempe et al 28 reported an increased rate of influenza virus infection among immunocompromised children compared with an immunocompetent population. Of interest is the finding that the increase was accounted for primarily by infection among those with preexisting serum antibody. A deficiency in new antibody synthesis induced by infection would lead to increased susceptibility to reinfection. Reduced T lymphocyte numbers and function with reductions in T cell cytotoxic function would lead to reduced ability to clear virus, with a resulting increase in both magnitude and duration of infection. An increased magnitude of infection would lead to an increased likelihood of viral pneumonia as well as secondary bacterial or fungal pneumonias that occur because of impairment of antimicrobial defenses by both the immune deficiency and the viral infection. Thus, the immune deficiencies described for immunocompromised persons can account for a high frequency of viral respiratory infections as well as an increased severity of illness and a significant risk of death. The described variability in frequency and severity of the infections among the various populations of immunocompromised persons should reflect the degree of immune deficiency. This appears to be the case, as persons who are less immunocompromised than others seem to have less of a problem with viral respiratory infections. [29] [30] [31] ",

Treatment should be short term, as resistance develops rapidly. 39 Ribavirin by aerosol is approved for treatment of severe RSV disease in infants but may be effective in adults as well. 6,8,15,40 -43 Controlled and uncontrolled studies have indicated value for ribavirin in treatment of influenza A and B and parainfluenza virus infections. 16,44 -47 COMMENT It is becoming increasingly clear that the respiratory viruses commonly infect immunocompromised persons and that these infected persons may exhibit severe respiratory illnesses with high frequencies of pneumonia and death. Although not well documented, there is surely a gradient of infection and illness severity that relates to the degree and type of impairment of immune function. It is not clear at present that impairment of immune function can lead to increased susceptibility to infection, although early data suggest this is true and described immune impairments would make this likely. On the other hand, there is little doubt that severe pure viral pneumonias and the characteristic prolonged infections that occur in immunocompromised patients are attributable to deficiencies in mechanisms of recovery. The severity of RSV infections in patients with extreme degrees of immunodeficiency is notable; an understanding of the immune basis for this severity could aid in designing immune approaches for prevention and treatment of these infections. Similarly, such an understanding of the other respiratory viral infections could be of value in the care not only of immunocompromised persons but also of immunocompetent persons.",

The last of these -their role as predisposing pathogens -is considered to be the major role for these infections among immunocompetent patients who develop pneumonia. Options are available for control of some of the respiratory viral infections, and efforts to recognize and apply these options are needed while other options are being identified and developed.
