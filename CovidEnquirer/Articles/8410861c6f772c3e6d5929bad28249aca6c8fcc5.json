Understanding the molecular basis in relation to the virulence of HP-PRRSV is essential for effectively controlling clinical infection and disease. In the current study, we constructed and rescued a serial of mutant viruses in nsp9 and nsp10 based on the differential amino acid sites between HP-PRRSV JXwn06 and LP-PRRSV HB-1/3.9. The replication efficiency in pulmonary alveolar macrophages (PAMs) and the pathogenicity of the mutant viruses for piglets were analyzed. Our results showed that the mutation of Thr to Ala in 586 and Ser to Thr in 592 of nsp9 decreased the replication efficiency of HP-PRRSV in PAMs, and could attenuate its virulence for piglets, suggesting that the residues 586 and 592 of nsp9 are critical sites natively in determining the fatal virulence of the Chinese HP-PRRSV for piglets.",

The virus remains a threat to pig production since it was first recognized in the early 1990s (Benfield et al., 1992; Wensvoort et al., 1991) . PRRSV is an enveloped virus with a single positive-stranded genomic RNA, which is newly proposed to be classified into the genus Porartevirus of the family Arteriviridae in the order Nidovirales, together with lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus (LDV) and rat arterivirus 1 (Kuhn et al., 2016 ; https://talk.ictvonline. org/ictv-reports/ictv_online_report/). PRRSV has two species (PRRSV1 and PRRSV2) (Kuhn et al., 2016) , namely the European type (type 1) and North American type (type 2), based on genetic and antigenic differences (Allende et al., 1999; Mardassi et al., 1994; Meng et al., 1995; Murtaugh et al., 1995; Nelsen et al., 1999) . The PRRSV genome is approximately 15 kb in size, and contains 12 known open reading frames (ORFs). The ORF1a and ORF1b situated in the 5'-proximal three quarters of the genome encode two large polyproteins, pp1a and pp1ab, which can be processed into 16 nonstructural proteins (nsp), including nsp1\u03b1/\u03b2, nsp2-6, nsp7\u03b1/\u03b2, nsp8-12, as well as nsp2TF and nsp2N (Fang et al., 2012; Fang and Snijder, 2010; Li et al., 2015; Mardassi et al., 1995; Meulenberg et al., 1995) . The ORF2a, ORF2b, ORFs3-7, and ORF5a encode viral structural proteins (Johnson et al., 2011; Mardassi et al., 1995; Meulenberg et al., 1995; van Nieuwstadt et al., 1996; Wu et al., 2001) . The majority of PRRSV nsps have been shown to play important roles in viral replication, genomic transcription and the modulation of innate immune responses (Fang and Snijder, 2010; Yoo et al., 2010) .",

            "text": "Tremendous molecular epidemiological data have shown that either type 1 or type 2 PRRSV exhibits broad genetic variation and diversified strains (Shi et al., 2010) . The persistent evolution nature of PRRSV has led to the emergence of novel and variant strains with higher pathogenicity or virulence (Han et al., 2006; Karniychuk et al., 2010; Tian et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2015; Zhou et al., 2015) . The Chinese highly pathogenic PRRSV (HP-PRRSV) with a unique hallmark of 30-amino acid deletion in the viral nsp2 emerged and prevailed in 2006 (Tian et al., 2007) , causing colossal economic losses to the swine production (Zhou and Yang, 2010) . A number of studies have provided essential evidence for understanding the pathogenesis of the Chinese HP-PRRSV (Han et al., 2017) . HP-PRRSV infection is shown to display expanded tissue tropism and increased virus loads in a variety of organs (Hu et al., 2013; Li et al., 2012) , and cause more severe lung injuries and histopathological changes (Han et al., 2014; Hu et al., 2013) , and thymus atrophy, depletion of thymocytes, and apoptotic cell death of thymic epithelial cells (Guo et al., 2013; He et al., 2012; Li et al., 2014b) . Importantly, much attention has been paid to the molecular basis in relation to its virulence. Our previous study indicated that the 30-amino acid deletion in its nsp2 is not related to the fatal virulence for piglets (Zhou et al., 2009) . Subsequent works clearly revealed that the nsp9 and nsp10 together are closely related to the replication efficiency both in vitro and in vivo, and contribute to the fatal virulence of the Chinese HP-PRRSV (Li et al., 2014c) . However, it remains unclear whether the Chinese HP-PRRSV shares the amino acid sites in nsp9 or/and nsp10 determining its fatal virulence.",

            "text": "In arterivirus, the nsp9 possesses RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) activity, and the nsp10 contains metal binding region with RNA helicase activity, which are considered to be assembled into the replication and transcription complex (RTC), and to play a crucial role in virus replication (Beerens et al., 2007; van Dinten et al., 2000) . In terms of the structural model of coronavirus nsp12 (Gorbalenya et al., 1989; Xu et al., 2003) , the nsp9 of PRRSV is predicated to consist of at least two domains, an N-terminal domain with RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN) activity and a canonical RdRp occupying its Cterminal domain (Lehmann et al., 2015a) . A conserved SDD motif and Asp residue within the RdRp domain of nsp9 are recognized to be critical for RNA polymerase activity and RNA synthesis (Lehmann et al., 2016; Snijder et al., 1990; Subissi et al., 2014) . The nsp10 of arterivirus belongs to superfamily 1 helicase (HEL1), and its helicase activity domain has similar structure to a cellular helicase Upf1 that participates in nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway, implying that the nsp10 might also play a role in post-transcriptional quality control of viral RNA (Deng et al., 2014; Lehmann et al., 2015b) . In the present study, we constructed a serial of mutant viruses with the mutated amino acid residues in the nsp9 and nsp10 of PRRSV by using reverse genetic approach, based on the differential amino acid sites in nsp9 and nsp10 between HP-PRRSV and low pathogenic PRRSV (LP-PRRSV), and analyzed the replication efficiency and pathogenicity of mutant viruses for piglets, in an attempt to identify the critical amino acids in relation to the fatal virulence in nsp9 or/and nsp10 of HP-PRRSV.",

The scores of lung microscopic lesions were blindly evaluated from 0 to 4, which accounted for the distribution and severity of interstitial pneumonia. The IHC scores of PRRSV antigen were conducted through a range score of 0-4 for evaluating the numbers of PRRSVpositive cells.",

Totally, 18 viruses with a single residue mutation were rescued ( Table 2 ). The replication efficiencies of these mutated viruses in PAMs were examined and compared by drawing growth curves, together with the parental viruses (RvJXwn, RvHB-1/3.9, RvJHn9n10 and RvHJn9n10). As shown in Fig. 1A , compared with the parental virus RvHB-1/3.9, the RvHJn9n10 with swapping nsp9-and nsp10-coding regions of JXwn06 had an increased replication efficiency in PAMs. While the HJn9n10-T586A with the mutation of Thr to Ala in 586 of nsp9 had lower titers than RvHJn9n10, with significant differences at 36 h and 48 h pi (p\uff1c0.01); the HJn9n10-S592T with the mutation of Ser to Thr in 592 of nsp9 also showed the decreased titers, with a similar level to RvHB-1/3.9, and its titers were significantly lower than RvHJn9n10 at 36 h (p\uff1c0.01) and 48 h pi (p\uff1c0.05). The viruses with other mutations in nsp9 and nsp10 showed similar growth kinetics to the RvHJn9n10 (Fig. 1B) .

The results showed that RvJHn9n10 had a decreased replication efficiency than RvJXwn, but the viruses with mutated differential amino acid sites did not exhibit an increased growth efficiency than RvJHn9n10, even the viruses with the mutation of Ala to Thr in 586 and Thr to Ser in 592 of nsp9 (JHn9n10-A586T and JHn9n10-T592S) had slightly decreased titers ( Fig. 1C and D) .

The data showed that the virus titers in sera of piglets infected with JXwn-T586A, JXwn-T586A/S592T were lower than those of RvJXwn-infected group with significant differences at 3, 5, 10 dpi (p\uff1c0.01, p\uff1c0.001, p\uff1c0.05), and the virus titers in JXwn-S592T-infected group were also slightly lower than those of RvJXwn-infected group, while JXwn-A427T/D609G-infected group had L. Xu et al. Virology 517 (2018) 135-147 no statistically significant differences in virus loads with RvJXwn-infected group (Fig. 5A) . The virus titers in sera of the piglets infected with JHn10-T586A, JHn10-S592T, and JHn10-T586A/S592T were lower than those of RvJHn10-infected group with significant differences at some time points, and JHn10-T586A/S592T-infected piglets had the lowest virus loads, with significant differences at 3, 5, 7, 10, 14 dpi, while JHn10-A427T/D609G-infected piglets had no differences in virus loads with RvJHn10-infected group (Fig. 5B) . The results indicated that the mutation of the residue 586 or 592 and the both in nsp9 of RvJXwn06 or RvJHn10 led to the declined virus load in the sera of the inoculated pigs. Moreover, PRRSV antigen in lungs of the inoculated piglets was examined by immunohistochemistry. The PRRSV-positive signals were distributed in all the lung section in dead piglets, and the scores of PRRSV antigen in lungs of the piglets inoculated with mutant viruses were lower than their respective parental viruses (Fig. 6A) . For euthanized piglets, the PRRSV-positive signals in lungs of JHn10-T586A-, JHn10-S592T-and JHn10-T586A/S592T-inoculated piglets were less than those of RvJHn10-inoculated piglets, whereas JHn10-A427T/ D609G-inoculated piglets showed no differences with RvJHn10-inoculated piglets (Fig. 6B) . No PRRSV-positive signals were observed in lungs of control piglets. Collectively, the above data revealed that the mutation of Thr to Ala in 586 and Ser to Thr in 592 of HP-PRRSV nsp9 alleviated the temperature reaction and lung lesions of the infected piglets, and declined the replication efficiency of HP-PRRSV in vivo, and delayed the death time of the infected piglets, and resulted in the decreased mortality of piglets, suggesting that the mutation of these two residues in nsp9 of HP-PRRSV attenuates its virulence for piglets.",

Despite numerous efforts on HP-PRRSV pathogenesis and antiviral immunity investigation for several years, to effectively control the clinical diseases caused by this virus remains a great challenge for the Chinese pig production. As a consequence, it is essential to find out the pathogenesis of HP-PRRSV. In our previous work, we utilized a HP-PRRSV strain JXwn06 and a LP-PRRSV strain HB-1/3.9 with genetic similarity to HP-PRRSV and swapped different viral coding regions by infectious cDNA clones, and clearly demonstrated that the nsp9 and nsp10 together were related to viral replication efficiency of HP-PRRSV in vivo and in vitro, contributing its fatal virulence for piglets (Li et al., 2014c) . To further dissect the molecular basis of HP-PRRSV virulence, we screened for the critical amino acids in relation to the fatal virulence of HP-PRRSV in nsp9 and nsp10 in the current study.",

Similar findings have been documented on PRRSV. In comparison to LP-PRRSV HB-1/3.9, HP-PRRSV JXwn06 exhibits stronger replication efficiency in vivo and in vitro (Zhou et al., 2009) . The PRRSV Lena, a strain belonging to the subtype 3 of genotype 1, shares an increased virulence and higher replication efficiency (Karniychuk et al., 2010) . Li et al. analyzed the replication efficiency differences of the chimeric viruses (RvJHn9n10 and RvHJn9n10) generated by swapping nsp9-and nsp10-coding region of LP-PRRSV HB-1/ 3.9 and HP-PRRSV JXwn06 and determined that the nsp9-and nsp10coding regions together are closely related to the replication efficiency of the Chinese HP-PRRSV in vitro and in vivo (Li et al., 2014c) . Moreover, the changes of replication efficiency were more significant in PAMs than in MARC-145 cells. Thus, we performed the mutation in nsp9 and nsp10 using the chimeric full-length infectious clones of RvJHn9n10 and RvHJn9n10 based on the differential amino acid sites between HP-PRRSV JXwn06 and LP-PRRSV HB-1/3.9. Considering that PAMs are the target cells of PRRSV, we evaluated the growth kinetics of all the rescued mutant viruses in PAMs instead of MARC-145 cells in the L. Xu et al. Virology 517 (2018) 135-147 present study. Our analyses showed that the mutation of Thr to Ala in 586 and Ser to Thr in 592 of RvHJn9n10 nsp9 led to the decreased replication efficiency of the virus, while the mutation of respective amino acid sites of RvJHn9n10 could not result in the increased replication efficiency of the virus. Then we continued to conduct the mutation of these two sites using the infectious cDNA clones of RvJXwn06 or RvJHn10, and confirmed the influences of these two residues mutation for replication efficiency. The data indicated that the respective mutations decreased the replication efficiency and viral RNA synthesis efficiency of the viruses based on RvJXwn and RvJHn10.",

            "text": "Our present study further proved that the replication efficiency of PRRSV is closely related to its pathogenicity or virulence, and the nsp9 can be considered the key replicase directing the replication of PRRSV in host cells and in vivo. To date, the crystal structure of PRRSV nsp9 remains unknown. By using sequence alignments and homology modeling prediction with equine arterivirus (EAV) and coronavirus, the RdRp domain of PRRSV contains at least six canonical conserved motifs (A to F) (Beerens et al., 2007; Poch et al., 1989; te Velthuis, 2014) . By amino acid alignment analysis of nsp9 between HP-PRRSV JXwn06 and LP-PRRSV HB-1/3.9, it is found that the differential amino acid in 427 is located between motif F and A, while other three differential amino acids is situated in motif E. Our results revealed that the Thr in 586 and Ser in 592 of HP-PRRSV nsp9 are selected to affect its replication efficiency and pathogenicity, but it is difficult to explain how these amino acids impact the feature of nsp9 due to unknown function of these motifs. What makes us more frustrated is that it is difficult to assess the RdRp activity of nsp9 because of its weak and controversial activity in vitro (Lehmann et al., 2016) . Comparative analysis of nsp9 amino acid sequence showed that the amino acid in 586 is a conserved residue in all strains of HP-PRRSV, namely the amino acid in 586 of nsp9 is Thr in HP-PRRSV, whereas Ala in LP-PRRSV. However, the amino acid in 592 is Thr only in HB-1/3.9 and its wild-type HB-1(sh)/2002 (Gao et al., 2004) , whereas Ser in other strains. In addition, our animal trails indicated that the amino acid in 586 impacted more obviously the virus pathogenicity than the amino acid in 592. Thus, it is proposed that the amino acid in 586 of nsp9 shares common feature affecting the replication efficiency and pathogenicity of PRRSV, while the effect of the amino acid in 592 on viral replication efficiency and pathogenicity might be strain-specific. Another concern is that, by mutating these two amino acid sites, the virulence of HP-PRRSV JXwn06 could be attenuated, whereas the replication efficiency and pathogenicity of LP-PRRSV HB-1/3.9 could not be enhanced reversely. These findings imply that other unknown factors may participate in this influence for the pathogenicity of PRRSV although the two amino acids in 586 and 592 of nsp9 are recognized as critical sites conferring the fatal virulence of HP-PRRSV in the current study. One example is that HP-PRRSV can be attenuated by de-optimization of codon pair bias in nsp9-coding region without any amino acid changes (Gao et al., 2015) .",

In another aspect, our results also suggested that the virulence of mutant viruses could be more remarkable decreased by the nsp10 of HB-1/3.9, although the replication efficiency changes were not observed. Previous studies have demonstrated that some nonstructural proteins of nidovirus can interact with each other, and indicated that the polymerase and helicase can interact with each other in vitro (von Brunn et al., 2007) . We propose that there are two possible mechanisms of affecting virus replication efficiency and pathogenicity by mutating these two amino acids: they might directly affect the normal function of viral RNA amplification, or impact the interaction between nsp9 and host factors or other viral proteins. These are required to be further investigated in the future work.",
