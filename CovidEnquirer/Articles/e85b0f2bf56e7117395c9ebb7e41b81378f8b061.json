The dimeric enzyme dissociated at guanidinium chloride concentration of ,0.4 M, at which the enzymatic activity loss showed close correlation with the subunit dissociation. Further increase in guanidinium chloride induced a reversible biphasic unfolding of the enzyme. The unfolding of the C-terminal domain-truncated enzyme, on the other hand, followed a monophasic unfolding curve. Different mutants of the full-length protease (W31 and W207/W218), with tryptophanyl residue(s) mutated to phenylalanine at the C-terminal or N-terminal domain, respectively, were constructed. Unfolding curves of these mutants were monophasic but corresponded to the first and second phases of the protease, respectively. The unfolding intermediate of the protease thus represented a folded C-terminal domain but an unfolded N-terminal domain, which is enzymatically inactive due to loss of regulatory properties. The various enzyme forms were characterized in terms of hydrophobicity and size-and-shape distributions. We provide direct evidence for the functional role of C-terminal domain in stabilization of the catalytic N-terminal domain of SARS coronavirus main protease.",

A specific SARS coronavirus (CoV) was identified to be the contagious agent. Maturation of the SARS-CoV involves proteolytic processing of the virus polyproteins by the chymotrypsin-like main protease (3CLpro) and a papain-like protease (PLpro). SARS-CoV might invade cells by a protease-mediated endosomal pathway (2) .

As had previously been shown for the 3CLpro of transmissible gastroenteritis (corona)virus (9) , the SARS-CoV enzyme also exists as a dimer in solution and in crystals, with each subunit containing three structural domains (Fig. 1) . The catalytic dyad His 41 -Cys 145 is located between the interfaces of domains I (residues 8-99) and domain II (residues 100-183), which constitute the chymotrypsin-like folding scaffold. This catalytic N-terminal domain is connected by a long loop (residues 184-199) to the helical domain III (residues 200-306). The functional role of the extra C-terminal domain III is less clear. Numerous experimental evidence shows the importance of N-and C-terminal residues in the dimerization (4, (10) (11) (12) . Structural studies indicate the close proximity of C-terminus and N-finger (N-terminal residues 1-7) (9) from subunit A to the active site of subunit B that led to the development of a novel autocleavage mechanism that can explain the dimeric nature of the mature enzyme (13) .",

            "text": "The original crystal structure of SARS-CoV main protease revealed that the dimeric enzyme is half-sited at pH 6.0, in which one of the protomer appears to be active and the other inactive (7). In a recent article, Chen et al. (21) confirmed that the dimeric SARS-CoV main protease is asymmetric and only one protomer is active at a time. They proposed a novel association-activation-catalysis-dissociation mechanism for the enzyme activity control. We checked whether dissociation is the major reason for enzyme inactivation. The following residues were selected for analysis: His 41 and Cys 145 , the catalytic dyad; His 163 , the substrate-binding residue; Tyr 161 , residue for holding His 163 in place. Some surface residues at domain I, Ser 65 and Asn 84 , were also selected as control. In the Ramachandran plot (22) , Asn 84 is in the disallowed region of the unbound 3CLpro but in a generously allowed region of a 3CLpro-azapeptide inhibitor complex (23) . Table 1 summarizes the kinetic parameters of these mutants. Mutation at catalytic dyad residues (H41A and C145A) abolishes almost the complete biological function while the enzyme exists exclusively as dimer. Assuming that the rate-limiting step of the hydrolytic activity of 3CLpro, like chymotrypsin, is at the covalent acylation-deacylation step, then the K m value for the substrate reflects an apparent binding affinity for the enzyme-substrate complex. However, mutation at S1 site (H163A) of the substrate-binding pocket did not change the substrate binding appreciably as anticipated. The major effect was on the k cat value. H163A possessed ;0.1% of enzyme activity compared with WT. In contrast, the catalytic dyad mutants, H41A and C145A, had only 10 \u00c06 relative activity left. An interesting finding was the Y161A mutant, which has only 7 3 10 \u00c05 relative enzymatic activity left. Y161A dissociated to an unstable monomer that is prone to polymerize (Supplementary Material, Fig. 3S ).",

This helps us to differentiate domain stability of 3CLpro and assign the functional role of domain III. However, it is still difficult to assign the corresponding domain to the biphasic unfolding. To provide a structural basis for the biphasic unfolding curves shown in Fig. 3, A and B , we constructed two mutants of 3CLpro, each with tryptophanyl residue(s) mutated at different domain and the fluorescence of these mutants now reports the structural changes of individual domain.",

Thus Cys 145 and His 163 have been mutated in 3CLpro of transmissible gastroenteritis (corona) virus (9) ; His 41 , Cys 145 , Tyr 161 in feline infectious peritonitis virus (28) ; and Cys 145 in SARS-CoV (10, 13, 29) . Table 1 summarizes the results obtained in this study. As expected, the almost complete loss of enzymatic activity of H41A and C145A confirmed the catalytic roles of the catalytic dyad (29, 30) . Similar observations were made for His 163 and Tyr 161 . Both of these residues are involved in substrate binding. The main function of Tyr 161 is to hold His 163 in place. Mutation of His 163 led to a relatively small increase in K m but a large drop in k cat ( Table 1 ). This could result from the enzyme activity assays being performed at pH 7.6, where one protomer of the dimeric enzyme adopts a different conformation from that in acidic environment (7) . It has been postulated by Tan et al. (30) and also by Yang et al. (7) that at low pH, protonation of His 163 induces a series of conformational changes that lead to the collapse of the oxyanion hole and blocks the S1 pocket entry. This would be in full agreement with the observation of a very large decrease in k cat as shown in Table 1 . An intriguing question will then be testing the pH-activity profile of H163A mutant to confirm that His 163 is responsible for the lower activity of 3CLpro at pH 6.0 as predicted by molecular dynamic simulation (30) .",

            "text": "The contribution of this study includes our presentation of a clear-cut dissociation-denaturation profile as well as a differential domain unfolding process. Protein folding constitutes one of the most challenging problems in the life science area (31) (32) (33) (34) (35) . The SARS-CoV main protease has a unique structure with distinct structural domains. Each subunit of the protein has 13 strands and 11 helices, distributed in different structural domains (7) . A multiphasic unfolding process may be anticipated. From the present analyses, the differential stability of different structural domains of the enzyme was deduced in terms of their free energy changes during transformation from the folded state to the unfolded state with an intermediate state involvement of folded domain III but unfolded domain (I1II) by the following reasoning. Bacha et al. (24) had demonstrated the intrinsic instability of the C-terminal domain III by differential scanning calorimetry albeit this technique seemingly does not provide enough resolution to detect the unfolding intermediate. We observed a clear biphasic unfolding curve for the 3CLpro by the protein intrinsic fluorescence. The intermediate form was assigned to a folded C-terminal domain but an unfolded N-terminal domain on the basis of the following observations: a), Our unfolding data of 3CLpro clearly demonstrate the biphasic-unfolding process and our data of 3CL I1II (N-terminal domain) suggest attributing the first and second phases of the 3CLpro to the N-and C-terminal domains, respectively ( Table 2) . b), Unequivocal assignment of the biphasic unfolding curve to differential domain stability came from results shown in Fig. 7 . The W31 and W207/ W218 are full-length 3CLpro. The unfolding curves shown in Fig. 7 should be biphasic. However, because the protein was excited with 295 nm UV light, one of the domain unfoldings is invisible and the unfolding curve only registered the structural changes of the tryptophan-containing domain. W31 and W207/W218 thus report conformational changes of the N-terminal and C-terminal domains, respectively. It is then clear that the N-terminal domain is labile than the C-terminal domain. The stabilization of the catalytic N-terminal domain by the C-terminal domain III is thus confirmed. The intrinsic conformational stability of domain (I1II) without domain III has a much higher free energy (7.27 kcal mol \u00c01 ) than full-length 3CLpro (1.22 kcal mol \u00c01 ) ( Table 2 ). The significant larger m GdnCl value of 3CL I1II (4.94 kcal mol \u00c01 M \u00c01 ) than full-length 3CLpro (1.15 kcal mol \u00c01 M \u00c01 ) clearly indicates the pronounced increase of surface area exposure on denaturation of 3CL I1II (26) . This actually defines the functional role of domain III in SARS-CoV main protease.",

            "text": "After dissociation, the distribution of three structural forms of 3CLpro in various GdnCl concentrations is very clear. It includes a folded monomer, an intermediate with folded domain III but unfolded domain (I1II), and a completely unfolded form. The enzyme starts to dissociate at very early stage, at GdnCl concentration of ,0.1 M. The dissociated monomer then starts to unfold at ,0.4 M and reaches the first plateau at 2-3 M. The second unfolding then starts, which reaches another plateau at 4.5 M GdnCl. The complete dissociation and differential unfolding of the structural domains are summarized in Fig. 8 . This schematic presentation only lists the major enzyme species of the complex folding process. The sharp unfolding curves for 3CL I1II (Fig. 6 ) and the completely reversible of the unfolding process (Fig. 2 B) consistent with that 3CL I1II without domain III can fold independently into an intact chymotrypsin-like fold. Domain III thus must have extra functional role. Shi and Song (36) have observed a nanochannel between domain III and the active center and proposed a regulatory effect of the extra domain III in relaying the catalytic machinery. Chen et al. (21) suggest that the enzyme follows an association-activation-catalysis-dissociation catalytic cycle. This will provide further insight into the functional role of domain III in the dimerization and involvement in the enzyme activity regulation beyond simple stabilization of the catalytic N-terminal domain.",
