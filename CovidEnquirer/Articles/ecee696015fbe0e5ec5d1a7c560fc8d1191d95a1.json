These Korean IBV isolates were classified into three groups according to their RFLP patterns obtained using the restriction enzyme HaeIII. Half of the twelve isolates were similar to the KM91 RFLP pattern, which is a common pattern in Korea. Three more isolates were related to the Arkansas strain pattern, but with some unique variations. The other three viruses showed variant RFLP patterns. For a comparison with the published sequences for non-Korean IBV strains, amplified PCR products from the twelve isolates were cloned and sequenced. The Korean IBV field isolates had 71.2-99.7% nucleotide sequence homology with each other and 45.9-80.7% nucleotide sequence homology with non-Korean IBV strains. With respect to the deduced amino acid sequence, the Korean IBV isolates had 71.5-99.3% similarity with each other and 44.9-80.3% similarity with non-Korean IBV strains. Phylogenetic tree analysis revealed that some of the IBV isolates appear to belong to a new group, different from the non-Korean IBV strains or from previously isolated Korean IBV strains. Specifically, the new Korean IBV isolates K10217-03, K3-3 and K1255-03 represented a separate group. These findings suggest that the Korean IBVs appear to be continuously evolving.",

IBV, the causative agent of infectious bronchitis (IB), belongs to the family Coronaviridae and is found worldwide [5, 15] . The genome of IBV consists of a single-stranded sense RNA genome encoding four structural proteins, which are envelope glycoprotein, integral membrane glycoprotein, phosphorylated nucleocapsid protein, and spike (S) glycoprotein [15, 22] . The S glycoprotein is cleaved post-translationally by cellular proteases into the S1 and S2 subunits [4] . The globular S1 subunit forms the tip of a spike, extending outward, whereas the S2 subunit anchors the S1 moiety to the viral membrane [1] . The S1 subunit is involved in viral infectivity, virus-neutralizing epitopes, serotype-specific sequences, and hemagglutinin activity [1] [2] [3] 11, 12] .",

Various serotypes are thought to develop by nucleotide insertions, deletions, point mutations, and by RNA recombination in the S1 subunit [10, 13, 23, 24] . Since IBV was first reported in Korea in 1986 and nephropathogenic IBV was recognized in 1990, a variety of serotypes of IBV have been reported in Korea [17] . Some of these IBV isolates exhibit variant patterns that distinguish them from each other and from non-Korean IBV isolates in analysis by reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction-restriction fragment length polymorphism (RT-PCR-RFLP) [17] . The objective of this study was genetic characterization of recent IBV isolates in Korea. The S1 glycoprotein genes of the Korean IBVs were amplified by RT-PCR. Amplified S1 genes were classified by RFLP analysis and cloned, sequenced and compared to other non-Korean published IBV sequences. By RT-PCR-RFLP and phylogenetic tree anal- ysis, recent Korean IBV isolates were classified at the genetic level into three distinct groups, two of which included only indigenous Korean IBV isolates and one of which represented a new phylogenetic group.",

Twelve Korean IBVs were analyzed in this study, first by RT-PCR-RFLP and then by nucleotide sequencing of the S1 glycoprotein gene. The Korean IBV field isolates were studied between 1986 and 1997 and were characterized using RT-PCR-RFLP analysis and pathogenicity testing, but the sequences of those viruses were not reported [21] . According to those prior analyses, the KM91 type is the most common or representative genotype III among the five genotypes. KM91 yielded distinct RFLP patterns in the PCR-RFLP analysis using the restriction enzymes Hae III, Eco RI and Bam HI. For the pathogenicity testing, the isolate KM91 was associated with 50% mortality, severe nephritis and renal urate deposits in the kidneys of infected chicks, whereas the other strains merely caused respiratory distress one to two days after inoculation [21] . The H120 vaccine could not protect the chicks against the challenge with the KM91 iso-late [21] . In the RT-PCR-RFLP analysis of the recent IBV isolates, 10 of 15 IBVs produced RFLP patterns corresponding to the IBV KM91 strain [17] . Therefore, IBV KM91 seems to be the major IBV in Korea.",

Half of the 12 Korean IBVs (K748-01, K044-02, K058-02, K117-02, K234-02, and K514-03) were classified into the IBV KM91 type, consistent with the result obtained by RT-PCR-RFLP analysis [21] . The three IBVs K10217-03, K3-3 and K1255-03 recently isolated in Korea formed a distinct cluster, which was related to the KM91 type. They shared between 83.3% to 85.2% amino acid sequence similarity with the KM91 type IBVs, a higher similarity with KM91 than non-Korean and some other Korean IBVs. These three IBVs shared a unique RFLP pattern, however, which had not been previously reported. Therefore, the Korean IBV K10217-03, K3-3 and K1255-03 isolates seem to represent a new Korean IBV variant. Further characterization of these IBV isolates by virus-neutralization testing is warranted. The remaining isolates K434-01, K545-02, and K2-6 were clustered into the Ark99 group, although K545-02 and K2-6 isolates were not classified into the Arkansas type by PCR-RFLP analysis. They showed various RFLP patterns. Either these strains generate two or more RFLP patterns in spite of belonging to the same group in phylogenetic tree analysis, or they may in fact consist of a mixture of two different kinds of viruses. Distinguishing between these possibilities will require further characterization using cloned viruses. The evolution of IBV appears to be influenced by many factors, such as the use of multiple strains for vaccination, the population density and the host immune status [6] . In addition, transcription of IBV's RNA genome has a high error rate [15, 20] . Widespread uses of various vaccines made from heterologous IBVs in the field may also exert pressure resulting in the increase of new genetic variants in Korea.",
