To some degree, yes. The dead included a pair of South Korean missionaries, a young Indonesian entrepreneur making his first trip to Singapore, the managing director of an electronics firm, an Indonesia maid who worked in Singapore but had traveled home for a wedding, several teachers and a couple of university students, and 41 people from an evangelical church in Surabaya who had made a block booking to save money on their shared New Year's holiday in Singapore (BBC, 2015; Patience, 2015) . All 155 traveled in the same economy class seats. Aviation in this region has come some way from its traditional emphasis on luxury and class distinctions (Bowen, 2010) .",

In 2013, LCCs accounted for a larger share of capacity in this region than in any other, but by 2018 the budget airline sector had reached a kind of plateau (at least relative to the full-service network carrier [FSNC] sector 2 ), and South Asia (Chapter 9) had overtaken Southeast Asia as the region with the greatest LCC capacity share (see Table 1 .1). Still, a couple of the region's carriers rank among the largest no-frills airlines in the world (see Table 1 .2), and low-cost aviation continues to reach into new markets (e.g., Myanmar). Perhaps nowhere else in the world has the surge in LCCs been as stunning as in this region. In this chapter, the emergence and massive expansion of Air-Asia, Lion Air, Cebu Pacific, and other LCCs are explored. Why has this region proven so particularly hospitable to the LCC phenomenon and can it continue? And how has their rise affected everyday life in the region? Accidents like QZ8501 are tragic, but very rare; and the predictability and safety of LCCs have helped to streamline their ascent among the options enjoyed by an increasingly mobile Southeast Asian population. What have the consequences been?",

The carrier had just two 737s and planned on cautious growth, with the goal of being profitable by the third year. It was a modest beginning for a company intended to become Malaysia's second national airline after flag carrier Malaysia Airlines, but it had no choice but to be circumspect given the severe constraints placed on AirAsia's growth. Malaysia's transport minister, who was aboard the first flight, made clear that there would be no direct competition between AirAsia-which initially flew under the brand Pacific Eagle-and Malaysia Airlines. Indeed, more than a year before AirAsia's first flight, Malaysia Airlines' chairman was quoted in the country's main newspaper saying, \"We go out and search for the routes, and the ones we have identified, we operate them. Of course we are reluctant to give them up.\" (quoted in Azmi, 1995) . And thus the opening to Pattaya, a secondary Thai gateway to which the larger airline did not operate.",

And then a week after its purchase by Tune Air, the attacks of September 11, 2001 sent a shockwave through the global economy and especially the global airline industry. Yet these successive crises helped spur the government of Malaysia and other Asian economies to loosen their control over aviation, and AirAsia rapidly expanded into the spaces created by deregulation. By early 2002, the airline was dealing with a \"deluge of inquiries\" about its services between Kuala Lumpur and other major Malaysian cities including Penang-routes already served by national carrier Malaysian Airlines (Singh & Maria, 2002) .",

More specifically, like LCCs elsewhere, AirAsia slashed its turnaround time, took advantage of the nascent Internet to lower marketing and distribution costs, encouraged multitasking personnel, adopted a single aircraft type (the 737), and did some ancillary services (e.g., ground handling) in-house (Khanna, 2003) . By 2003, the airline's costs were among the lowest in the world: USD 0.025 per available seat-kilometer versus USD 0.042 for Ryanair (Khanna, 2003) and less than half the level of Malaysia Airlines (O'Connell & Williams, 2005) .",

A nonstop shuttle flight on Singapore Airlines (SIA) between the city-state's Changi Airport and Kuala Lumpur International was fastest at just 4 hours and 10 minutes including ground transportation time, but cost the most-SGD 417.60 (USD 240). Conversely, taking the AirAsia flight out of Senai slashed the cost to SGD 27.70 (USD 16) but took nearly 7 hours. The AirAsia option was made more attractive by introductory promotional fares but even at the LCC's regular fare on the route, the circuitous route through Senai was competitive with the cost of driving one's own car, taking the train, or traveling by bus between Singapore and Kuala Lumpur.",

Shin Corp., a telecommunications conglomerate owned by the family of then-Thai Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, was a powerful partner for the Malaysian LCC (Ghosh, 2003) . The partnership worried homegrown players in Thailand's infant budget airline industry, but in drawing close to the country's top leadership, AirAsia was repeating its Malaysian experience: Tony Fernandes' decision to purchase AirAsia in the first place could be traced back to a suggestion made at a face-to-face meeting between the music industry executive and Malaysia's Prime Minister at the time, Mahathir Mohamad (Maria, 2002) .",

SIA and MAS had an 85% combined market share on the route in advance of its liberalization, and roundtrip fares for the 300-km route were about USD 290.

Altogether, these carriers provided slightly fewer than 500 seats per day between the nation's capital and Pontianak, the capital of West Kalimantan Province on the island of Borneo. A decade later, after the arrival of the new players, there were 9 nonstop flights and 1200 seats per day in each direction, and Lion Air and another LCC called Adam Air were tied for first rank on the route (OAG, 2008).

Adam Air, too, was an upstart launched after the country's rapid airline deregulation in 1998 (Asmarani, 2007) . It was created by an entrepreneurial family with interests in a variety of industries (from chopsticks to jewelry) and with strong political connections (a co-founder later becomes parliament speaker). And like Lion Air, Adam Air enjoyed meteoric growth in Indonesia's buoyant aviation sector. But Adam Air was beset by safety concerns that undermined and eventually terminated its growth. In 2006, one of its jets got lost en route over Java and then meandered for hours before making an emergency landing 4 hours later on the wrong island. In January 2007, another jet crashed into the sea off Sulawesi with 102 people on board (Osman, 2008a) . The following month, the fuselage of an Adam Air jet cracked after a hard landing, and then in 2008, another plane ran off the runway. These numerous incidents led Indonesian authorities to ground part of Adam Air's fleet, and finally in March 2008, the troubled airline collapsed when it could not renew its insurance (Osman, 2008b) . In fact, among the flurry of new budget airlines that jumped into the deregulated Indonesian market, only Lion Air long survived as a significant, independent player. In 2008, Adam Air exited the market, as did another somewhat similar carrier called Batavia Air in 2013. AWAIR teamed up with AirAsia to form Indonesia AirAsia. Another player in the industry, Citilink, was never independent but rather was set up as an LCC subsidiary of Garuda in 2001.",

Routes linking Jakarta to Denpasar on the island of Bali and Medan on Sumatra also ranked in the top 25.",

The mainstay of the fleet is the Boeing 737, especially the -900ER. Indeed, Lion Air was the launch customer for the largest version of the venerable \"Baby Boeing.\" The airline initially ordered 60 of the jets, which in a standard all-economy Lion Air configuration, seats 214 people 5 (Mecham, 2005) . And then in 2011, with President Obama watching, Rusdi and Boeing agreed to the purchase of 230 additional Boeing 737s (a mix of -900ER and the even newer Max versions) (Leithen, 2012) . The order was the largest ever in Boeing's history in terms of the number of aircraft and their total value (approximately USD 22 billion at list prices, though large customers like Lion Air rarely pay full price). Then in 2013, Lion Air stunned the aviation community again with an even larger order: USD 24 billion for 234 Airbus A320 and A321 jets (Clark, 2013) . Together the Boeing and Airbus orders turned Lion Air, an airline that at the time was just over a decade old, into one of the aircraft industry's biggest customers.",

            "text": "Will safety problems eventually stem the growth of the Indonesian airline industry? Perhaps, but one Indonesian airline expert noted that Indonesians have a history of continuing to ply buses and ferries after catastrophic accidents. Danang Parikesit, president of the Indonesia Transportation Society, commented about his fellow citizens, \"They are very insensitive to accidents. It's more on their perceptions of the value of life and the perception that the accident happened because it was meant to happen, like it's fate.\" (quoted in Cochrane, 2013) . In any case, that insensitivity is likely not just an Indonesian characteristic. After all, Indonesia's high airline accident rate in recent years was approximately the same as in the United States in the mid-1970s, a time when safety was hardly an impediment to the growth of the American airline travel. 7 A more intractable obstacle to further airline growth in Indonesia may be the inadequacy of airport infrastructure, especially at Soekarno Hatta International (Teo, 2015) . In 2016, a new Terminal 3 was opened, raising capacity to 63 million passengers per year (Karmini, 2016) , which by coincidence is the same as the number of passengers who used the airport in 2017 ( Jakarta Post, 2018) . The state-owned airport operator, Angkasa Pura II, plans to build a third runway by 2020 and fourth terminal by 2022 and refurbish the two older terminals at the airport, which together will increase capacity to 100 million (Susanty, 2017 ). Yet the experience of Terminal 3 suggests that the expansion will take longer. Ground was broken on the new terminal in 2012, but then the project became mired in red tape and difficulties in acquiring land for the expanded airport. Progress resumed with the election of Joko Widodo to the presidency. Jokowi, as the president was more commonly known, had been governor of Jakarta before becoming president and made the airport a top priority (Koyanagi & Suzuki, 2016) .",

Economic growth, buoyed by commodity exports to China, propelled millions of Indonesians into the middle class during the same period in which air travel soared. But GDP growth has slowed since 2010 (The Economist, 2016a). One of the chief impediments to stronger performance is weak infrastructure. Jokowi's commitment to breaking down that barrier through massive investment has mixed implications for aviation and LCCs in particular. Although the president's focus is on the sea (he said in his inaugural address, \"We have to work as hard as possible to turn Indonesia into maritime nation again.\"), Jokowi's government also aims to build 15 new airports and to lengthen the runways of existing airports across the archipelago (The Economist, 2016b). The longer runways will ease the expansion of LCCs since they are intended to accommodate aircraft as large as the Boeing 737 (i.e., the size class instrumental to most budget airline fleets) in communities across mainly peripheral areas of the country (Natahadibrata, 2014) . For instance, several of the longer runways will be in the relatively impoverished Maluku Islands in eastern Indonesia.",

Improvements in the highway networks (and perhaps even in ferry services) could divert some of the short-haul traffic upon which the LCCs have relied. For instance, one priority project is the Trans-Sumatra Highway which will link the largest cities on Indonesia's large western island (Antara News, 2018). Another longer-term challenge to the primacy of low-cost aviation is the development of high speed rail. A Chinese-Indonesian joint venture has been contracted to build a link between Jakarta-Bandung with services to commence in 2019 (Chew, 2016) . The 142-km intercity distance is too short to be suitable for air travel and so the new HSR connection does not threaten the country's airlines, but the further elaboration of the rail network could. And yet, rail and highway projects are beset by some of the same problems that have confounded airport development in the country. The Jakarta-Bandung link, for instance, has been hobbled by resistance in the country's legislature, where lawmakers contend the project is a betrayal of Jokowi's promise to focus on developing infrastructure in provinces outside of Java (Chew, 2016) . For now, then, the outlook is for slower growth of budget airlines in Indonesia and for that growth to remain concentrated in the lucrative, dense markets of the center. Growth is likely to be slower, however, as the economy moderates, as the new restrictions on airline size stymie the formation of new entrants, and as the established players-especially Lion Airconsolidate their position after a decade of furious growth. A Maasai proverb says, \"A lion can run faster than we can, but we can run farther.\" To go the distance, Lion Air's explosive sprint-and that of Indonesian aviation more generally-must now give way to a more measured pace.",

Earlier than most other places in the world, Singapore adopted a liberal \"open skies\" aviation policy and that very openness further strengthened SIA's position (Bowen, 2000) . The competition exposed the carrier to foes from across the world while simultaneously giving the airline from tiny Singapore reciprocal traffic rights in dozens of markets. At home, however, SIA faced no Singapore-based rival and none seemed in the offing. While SIA had been partially privatized in the mid-1980s, the carrier remained mostly state-owned and was an important instrument of government policy (Raguraman, 1997) . Under these circumstances, SIA seemed relatively invulnerable to the depredations of LCCs even as budget carriers rapidly captured market share from FSNCs elsewhere-including SIA's partners in the Star Alliance-in the 1990s.",

Jones (2002) highlighted several impediments in the region including a lack of the secondary airports often favored by LCCs, a protectionist regulatory environment, and a relatively small market. Even those authors who saw potential in the region, such as Kua and Baum (2004) , argued that the liberalization of the region would be very slow and that the incumbent flag carriers-especially SIA-were much better positioned to fend off the LCCs than their counterparts in other markets. SIA leaders were quoted in local media saying that LCCs could come to the Singapore \"if they are foolish enough\" (Walker, 2003 -quoted in Kua & Baum, 2004 and that if it was threatened by such 9 During the period 1994-2004, the most profitable airlines (based on cumulative net income) were: (1) SIA (USD 6.9 billion); (2) FedEx (USD 4.7 billion); (3) British Airways (USD 4.6 billion); (4) Southwest Airlines (USD 3.9 billion); and (5) Lufthansa (USD 3.7 billion) (Bowen, 2007) . 10 For instance, SIA won Cond e Nast's Best Airline in the World award in 28 of 29 years to 2016 (Singapore . new entrants, SIA was advised by its former chief executive officer, Cheong Choon Kong, to \"Go for the knock out.\" (Straits Times, 2003) . Cheong also expressed skepticism about the whole idea of LCCs, asserting that there were only two such airlines in the world that had been successful: Southwest Airlines and Ryanair. In 2003, however, the market and SIA's view of the proliferation of no-frills airline segment changed quickly. In June, a former SIA executive and other well-connected investors applied for an air operator's certificate to form a new carrier called Valuair (Lee, 2003) . The leaders of the new enterprise cast their venture as complementing rather than threatening SIA. Nevertheless, the emergence of Valuair and movements by Qantas to form a Singapore-based LCC compelled SIA to shift gears and begin exploring the development of its own budget subsidiary.",

At the beginning of 2003, Silkair flew to 25 destinations in 10 nearby countries with a fleet comprising Airbus A319 and A320 aircraft (SIA, 2003) . But the little airline was no LCC. Its average flight frequency was just under five flights per week per destination; it offered both economy and business class service; and it only began allowing customers to book tickets at its online site in late 2003. 11 The disparities between Silkair and the LCC model were cast into sharp relief by the early successes of AirAsia, Lion Air, and other new entrants; but Singapore, the region's most important air transport hub, had no budget airline contender of its own. Given the centrality of aviation in the citystate's economic development (Bowen, 2000) , it seemed imperative that an opening be created to allow this component of the industry to gain a foothold. Yet Singapore still approached the matter cautiously, taking nearly a year to approve Valuair's application for an Air Operator's Certificate. Having raised more than USD 17 million in capital from shareholders, the carrier finally launched its first flight, to Bangkok, in early May 2004 (Sreenivasan, 2004) . By the end of the month, with an initial fleet of just two A320s, it also had flights to Hong Kong and Jakarta.",

In particular, with low-cost aviation on the rise, Singapore's airport administrator, the Civil Aviation Authority of Singapore (CAAS), announced the construction of a new budget terminal at Changi (Quek, 2004) . With Tiger Airways as its first tenant, the new terminal was intended to reduce per passenger costs by 20% over the adjacent and much larger Terminals 1 and 2. The stripped down facility would have few frills (e.g., no travelators) and 12 SARS originated in southern China in late 2002 and spread slowly before reaching Hong Kong in February 2003. Upon reaching one of the world's foremost hubs, the disease spread within days to Australia, the United States, Canada, and the United Kingdom (though the number of cases was small). By the time the outbreak ended in mid-2003, the disease had spread to 26 countries and Taiwan, infected more than 8000 people, and killed nearly 800.

It was to be the first such budget terminal in Asia and was aimed both at Singapore-based LCCs and those serving the city-state from other countries. Yet even before the new terminal opened, the consolidation of Singapore's LCC sector began with Qantas acquiring a controlling share in Valuair. As a carrier with substantial foreign investment, Jetstar Asia was denied traffic rights to operate from Singapore to Indonesia and China (Rochfort, 2005) . Qantas's chief financial officer lamented, \"We've done absolutely everything by the book up there. Yet the countries Singapore has negotiated rights with have denied rights to a legitimate Singaporeanbased carrier and there appears to be nothing they are prepared to do about it.\" (quoted in Rochfort, 2005) .

In the region, Kuala Lumpur International and Soekarno Hatta remained far ahead in this respect but that was partly attributable to their role as hubs for significant domestic markets (especially in the case of Jakarta) while Singapore lacked a domestic hinterland. Further, Singapore is among the world's most important world-cities, the command-and-control centers of the global economy, and in that role it is a magnet for business traffic (especially on long-haul flights) in a way that Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta are not. The Globalization and World Cities Network ranks world cities every few years based on the distribution of advanced producer services firms (e.g., advertising agencies, consultancies, accountancies, law firms, etc.) (GaWC, 2017) . In its 2016 assessment, London and New York ranked first and second and were the only \"Alpha ++\" cities, but Singapore was next-ranked 3rd overall and the first \"Alpha+\" city. Kuala Lumpur and Jakarta were in the \"Alpha\" class and ranked 24th and 25th overall. Singapore's stature is directly related to the high proportion of business class seats in the city's airline services and the long average stage length compared to its Southeast Asian rivals (Table 8 .4).",

Jetstar Asia's ownership is split 51/49 between Westbrook Investments, a Singaporebased firm, and Qantas Group ( Jetstar, 2018) . Scoot is a wholly owned subsidiary of SIA Group. Scoot was established in 2012 as a long-haul LCC complementing SIA's older budget airline subsidiary Tigerair. In Singapore's fiercely competitive environment, however, neither LCC was consistently profitable. Partly because of that, they were merged under the Scoot brand in 2017 with the goal of achieving greater economies of scale and having the flexibility to adjust the all-Boeing 787 fleet that Scoot had operated and the all-Airbus A320 fleet of Tigerair among the two carrier's combined networks (Van der Beek, 2017) . In early 2018, SIA was the largest carrier at Changi Airport with 29% of capacity, Scoot was second with 13%, SIA's full-service regional subsidiary Silkair was third with 8%, and Jetstar Asia was fourth with 6% (OAG, 2018); the remainder was on foreign airlines, including almost all of the LCCs based in Southeast Asia (e.g., 6.5% of capacity was on AirAsia and its affiliates).",

In 1979, for instance, almost all international flights to, from, and within Southeast Asia involved one of the region's five key hubs (Singapore, Bangkok, Kuala Lumpur, Jakarta, and Manila); Hanoi's only international connection within the region was to Bangkok and Rangoon's only link was to Singapore (Bowen, 2000) .

Two important milestones along the road from Phnom Penh were the 2009 Multilateral Agreement on Air Services (MAAS) and the 2010 Multilateral Agreement for Full Liberalization of Passenger Air Services (MAFLPAS), which together sought to supplant the narrowly restrictive bilateral air services agreements of the past. The MAAS aimed at deregulating market access at two kinds of cities-the region's capital cities on the one hand and marginal places in the region's periphery (e.g., the weakly developed area comprised of Mindanao, Borneo, and other smaller islands near them) on the other hand. The MAFLPAS then sought to \"mop up\" the remaining cities (e.g., key secondary cities such as Surabaya in Indonesia) to bring them under the umbrella of liberalizing reform. Not every ASEAN member signed on to both agreements, and even some of those who did limited their impact by restricting the cities to which their various protocols applied. By 2015, the target date for a Single Aviation Market, the Philippines had not agreed to the MAAS and neither Indonesia nor Laos had yet signed on to the MAFLPAS (Bowen, 2016) .",
