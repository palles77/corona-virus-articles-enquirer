At one extreme are calves born in closed-beef cow-calf operations under low-density conditions on open range, such as in the low-rainfall areas of the Intermountain United States. This environment closely resembles the conditions in which the infectious agents and their hosts co-evolved before domestication. In this setting, the risk of introducing new strains of infectious agents is low, direct contact among calves is minimized, the opportunity for transmission by people and equipment is minimal, and fecal material is dispersed and exposed to environmental factors (i.e., insects, desiccation, and ultraviolet radiation) that inactivate most microorganisms. At the other exposure extreme, calves are raised in enclosed housing on continuous-flow, custom calf-raising operations. In this environment, calves are assembled from multiple herds and from sales channels in which the risk of heavy exposure to a variety of infectious agents is high. Calves are often in direct contact with one another, the physical space per calf is limited, and the risk of transmission by people and equipment is high. If housed, ventilation is often inadequate, resulting in a high relative humidity; fecal material is concentrated, with a high moisture content and without full exposure to direct sunlight. Vermin such as flies and rodents are often present in high numbers, and nutrition is provided by assembled feedstuffs of varying quality and nutritional value rather than from dam's milk. Between these two extremes are calves raised in individual hutches on dairies of their origin or beef calves raised in intensively managed rotational grazing systems in high-rainfall areas.",

            "text": "Diarrhea is the most important disease of neonatal calves and results in the greatest economic loss due to disease in this age group in both dairy and beef calves [25] . Earlier studies conducted by the US Department of Agriculture found that enteric pathogens are associated with the death of up to 25% of the US calf crop annually [43] . More recently, a retrospective survey of dairy producers found that 52% (standard error [SE] \u00b1 2.6%) of total death losses in preweaned heifers were caused by diarrhea [65] . In beef calves, the percentage of calves from birth to 21 days of age dying from diarrhea was 5.5% (SE \u00b1 1.3%) [10] . Neonatal calf diarrhea is a complex, multifactorial condition with numerous factors, including pathogen exposure, strain variation, environmental conditions, management conditions, nutritional state, and immune status all interacting to cause loss in preweaned beef and dairy calves. Most, if not all, of these factors are related to biosecurity in beef and dairy calf-raising practices. Many are under management control, and most are not specific to a single infectious agent. Biosecurity is not a new concept in animal agriculture; rather, it is largely a redefinition of earlier ideas and practices historically considered to be good animal husbandry. This observation is evident when one notices in early veterinary textbooks the calls for cleanliness, disinfection, and isolation of herd replacements and sick animals [4] .",

When approaching the control and prevention of neonatal enteric infections, knowledge of several general infectious disease epidemiology principles is useful. Essential information for designing a herd-specific control program for any infectious disease includes (1) the reservoir, (2) the modes of transmission and the agent characteristics related to each, (3) the incubation period, and (4) the period of communicability. The minimum incubation period (along with the infectious dose and the age of the calf) is critical because, for example, it establishes the maximum length of time a susceptible calf can be present in a critical calving facility before it could begin to contaminate the area if it were infected at birth. The most important reservoir for these enteric agents is previously or currently infected cattle, which is critical for producers to recognize when they are considering purchasing animals and when they are managing contact between different age groups within a herd.",

Most agents of neonatal calf diarrhea survive well in nearly all environmental conditions, remaining in the environment where they can be transmitted indirectly by contact with contaminated feces, fomites such as equipment, or mechanical vectors such as flies. For enteric agents transmitted by indirect contact, key factors include the number of organisms shed in the feces and their survival characteristics in the environment compared with the infectious dose required to initiate infection in susceptible hosts. Information on the environmental survival characteristics of an indirectly transmitted agent is needed to determine how long that agent is likely to remain at an infectious dose once the area is contaminated with it. All of this is critical information for determining how to manage livestock flow through an existing set of facilities and to otherwise minimize disease transmission through management practices. The relationship between infecting agents and the environment is complex, involving factors such as the physical characteristics of the substrate material (e.g., feces, water, milk, manure slurry, dust), temperature, pH, water activity, and competing microorganisms. As a consequence, these relationships are not well defined for many combinations encountered in the farm environment.",

If an agent was able to survive under the free-range conditions of the wild bovine, it is likely that transmission occurs relatively easily in the environment of the intensively managed domesticated bovine of today. Indeed, these agents are shed by infected animals in numbers several logarithms higher per gram of feces than the total number required to infect the typical susceptible calf. Additionally, these agents have been shown to be extraordinarily flexible with regard to their genetic make-up and through survival of the fittest can rapidly take advantage of new environments and management systems. Consequently, intervention strategies devoted to a single control point may be successful in the short run but are likely to prove unsuccessful over the long run.",

This concept is in effect both within and between herds. Between herds, clinical disease is normally seen in only a minority of herds, in which its occurrence implies significant, suboptimal management conditions. Within herds, generally only a small proportion of affected animals are clinically affected, with most being subclinically infected. For most diseases, both infectious and noninfectious, the ratio between clinical cases and subclinical cases is typically 1 : 5 to 1 : 20. In some circumstances, a herd can be widely infected with an agent, yet few if any clinical cases occur. Consideration of the iceberg principle helps prioritize efforts because in most outbreaks, attention is typically but erroneously focused only on individual animals displaying clinical signs. To wit, if isolation and sanitation practices are to be an important component of a disease control strategy, the iceberg principle suggests that to be effective, such measures must be applied to all exposed animals and not just those that exhibit clinical signs.",

            "text": "Appropriate cleaning and disinfection procedures are critical to breaking fecal-oral transmission cycles of enteric agents that contaminate housing, feeding, or treatment equipment or other vectors and fomites. Because personal hygiene is crucial to stopping the transmission of these agents in the human hospital environment, it is also a critical component in the intense livestock production environment as well. This personal hygiene includes frequent, effective hand washing of sufficient duration with soap followed by an alcohol-based hand disinfectant [50] , cleaning and disinfecting boots, and washing work clothes with bleach followed by hot air drying. Cleaning and disinfection procedures are not without pitfalls, however, and adherence to a sound protocol covering all of the infectious agents of concern is critical for long-term success. Procedures that do not affect a resistant agent such as Cryptosporidia oocysts or rotavirus may spread it from areas of high concentration across previously uncontaminated surfaces, where it can then contaminate materials such as water and feed at sufficient levels to provide an infectious dose. The most important first step is thorough cleaning to remove organic material (e.g., feces, milk film) before applying disinfectant [46] . Vigorous cleaning (scraping, scrubbing, flushing) cannot be replaced by applying disinfectants in larger quantities or with higher pressure. For any protocol or in nature, destruction of microorganisms initially follows a first-order logarithmic decay process and then slows [74] . In relation to the amount of time required to destroy one half of the initial population, approximately three time periods are required for a one-logarithmic (90%) reduction, six for a two-logarithmic (99%) reduction, nine for a three-logarithmic (99.9%) reduction, and so on. In addition to contact time, the concentration, temperature, pH, water content, water hardness, and amount of organic material present are critical variables determining the success of chemical disinfection. Importantly, the relationships between these factors are not straightforward [54] . For example, halving the concentration of formaldehyde requires a 2-fold increase in contact time to obtain similar microbial destruction, whereas halving the concentration of phenolics requires a 64fold increase in contact time. A 10\u00b0C rise in temperature increases the activity of alcohols 30-fold, yet increases the activity of formaldehyde only 1.5fold. Iodophors are highly active at low pH but are inactive at an alkaline pH. In general, effectively applied live steam inactivates the broadest range of microorganisms.",

It is readily available as 5.25% (household bleach) and 12.75% solutions, and it is cost effective and environmentally safe. Because it begins dissipating on dilution, however, the Centers for Disease Control recommends that diluted solutions should be used within 24 hours and that they should be stored in opaque containers. Sodium hypochlorite is rapidly inactivated by the presence of any appreciable organic material; for example, 1% albumin reduces its effectiveness by six logs, and increasing concentration or contact time does not recover this loss. Bacteria in biofilms are 150 to 3000 times more resistant. In solution, hypochlorus acid is the active form of the free chlorine. It is most available at a pH level of 6, dropping to 80% of the free chlorine at pH 7 and to 25% at pH 8, suggesting that the pH of disinfectant solutions should be monitored regularly as part of disinfection protocols. Below pH 6, it is more corrosive to metals, and more chlorine gas is released. Testing kits can be used to monitor free chlorine as part of disinfection protocols; however, because these kits measure both hypochlorus acid and hypochlorite ion (nonactive form), pH must also be considered. Recommended concentrations for use in human environments range from 500 ppm (1:100 dilution of 5.25% household bleach) and 10-minute contact time at room temperature to 5000 ppm (1:10 dilution of 5.25% bleach) and 1-minute contact time at room temperature, the higher concentrations being used in more critical areas. For viruses in veterinary hospitals and kennels, a recommended dilution of household bleach is 1:32, which results in a 0.175% sodium hypochlorite solution and a 10-minute contact time at room temperature [93] at pH 6 to 7.",

On smooth, ideal surfaces physical removal of visible contamination by thorough washing with soap and water removes 99% of the microbial load (two logs). On typical housing surfaces, however, washing only removes 90% (one log). Proper disinfection removes an additional 6% to 7%, and terminal fumigation removes 1% to 2%. Disinfection after washing is an important step, particularly if the surface remains damp, because remaining bacteria can proliferate in the minimal nutrients leaching from wet wood and because washing can disperse an infectious agent from limited areas of high concentration broadly across other surfaces. The application of high-pressure sprays can aerosolize organisms, allowing dissemination to distant sites and posing a risk to operators if zoonotic organisms are present.",

Undoubtedly, most animals develop active immunity to these organisms after infection by natural exposure to low infective doses shed by subclinically infected herd mates.

Management practices that minimize the risk of clinical disease by one organism generally reduce the risk of clinical disease by others. In a study of 59 calves younger than 3 weeks old from 12 beef and dairy herds with calf-scour problems, Moon and coworkers [61] found that ''most infections were mixed and diarrheal calves from the same herd frequently had different infections.'' In a survey of 490 preweaned calves from 45 calf-scour outbreaks, Reynolds et al [85] found that 29% of the clinical infections were mixed. Similarly, Snodgrass and coworkers [96] found that 21% of diarrheic calves less than 1 month old on 32 beef and dairy farms had mixed infections. Finally, in a study of 218 diarrheic calves less than 1 month old from 65 dairy herds, 25% of calves had mixed infections consisting primarily of rotavirus and Cryptosporidium parvum [33] . In most of these surveys, the most prevalent agent in diarrheic calves is rotavirus, the second being C. parvum at approximately half the prevalence of rotavirus. In surveys that included clinically normal herd mates, similar profiles of infectious agents were also found in the feces of these animals but at lower prevalences. These findings suggest that enteric pathogens of calves function more as secondary opportunists than as highly virulent primary pathogens. The occurrence of clinical disease therefore suggests that weaknesses are present in calf management and husbandry on those premises. Because nearly all of these pathogens are already present on most operations, control of enteric disease must therefore be focused on the interfaces between individual animals and groups of animals rather than on preventing their arrival on the operation, the traditional focus of most biosecurity efforts.",

Dublin, are important causes of diarrhea in dairy and veal calves, whereas infections in single-suckle beef calves are infrequent. The pathophysiology of enteric salmonella infections is complex, involving inflammation and necrosis, increased fluid secretion and decreased absorption and digestion. In addition to enteric manifestations of disease, infected calves are frequently septicemic, which results in more severe clinical signs. Bacteremia is common in calves less than 1 month of age and is often manifested systemically as polyarthritis, meningitis, or uveitis. In addition to shedding the agent in their feces, calves developing septicemia often shed the agent in their urine and oronasal secretions even before the onset of clinical signs. The lack of awareness about the potential for shedding from the oronasal area is particularly dangerous because this source leads to spread through contamination of feeding and treatment utensils and hands, severely compromising internal biosecurity programs. Hardman and coworkers [38] found that in natural outbreaks of individually penned calves, approximately 60% of transmission was by direct contact, whereas 40% was by indirect routes, including aerosols, fomites, and vectors. This finding suggests that emphasis should be placed more broadly on controlling all means of transmission, including aerosols [105] .",

In the absence of direct sunlight or predation by other microorganisms, Salmonella spp. can survive in wet or dry substrates or on surfaces for years, particularly if they are protected by biological films such as dried saliva, milk, or fat. Biological films also protect organisms from the action of chemical disinfectants. In an experiment that simulated a barn floor under defecating cows, Salmonella spp. were shown to survive for 5.5 years [72] . These researchers also found S. Typhimurium in an empty slurry pit that had not been used for 4 years. Because Salmonella spp. that infect cattle can infect and proliferate in the intestinal tracts of most other animals in a farm environment (including other livestock, humans, domestic pets, rodents, and birds), these other species may also be involved in disease transmission. For example, allowing cats access to stored feeds has been identified as a risk factor for salmonella outbreaks [26] . Serotypes that frequently infect cattle are typically introduced into a herd by subclinical or incubating carrier animals and only occasionally in feedstuffs. Many of the other serotypes imported onto farms in purchased feedstuffs appear unable to establish viable transmission cycles between cattle, instead causing only sporadic infections.",

All E. coli types can cause colisepticemia, but relatively few can cause enteric disease. Enteric E. coli infections are classified into several forms, including enterotoxigenic, enteropathogenic, enteroinvasive, enterohemorrhagic, and enteroadherent [53] . Enterotoxigenic E. coli are the most common form associated with disease in calves. The ability of enterotoxigenic E. coli to cause severe herd outbreaks of diarrhea in calves results from the expression of virulence factors, including adhesins (pili, fimbria) and enterotoxins. Adhesins (e.g., K99, F41, K88) are surface molecules that enable the bacteria to attach to specific receptors located on the intestinal epithelium of calves less than 3 days old. Once attached to intestinal cells via adhesins, bacterial expression of enterotoxins triggers intestinal fluid secretion in excess of absorptive capacity. In addition to enteric diseases caused by E. coli, systemic invasion by certain strains can result in septic shock and low-grade diarrhea. Diarrhea observed in these calves is generally thought to be due to endotoxemia secondary to bacteremia rather than production of enterotoxins.",

Rotaviruses are the most common cause of bovine neonatal diarrhea, the incidence of infection often approaching 100% in herds, and up to one half of infections resulting in clinical disease. Infection usually occurs between 4 and 14 days of age, although younger and older calves can be affected [66] . Because the median infectious dose for rotaviral infections in other species is 10 infectious particles or less [36, 103] , the infectious dose for neonatal calves is likely similar. Viral invasion of small intestinal villus epithelium occurs through the luminal surface, resulting in cell destruction and shedding of damaged cells into the intestinal lumen. As a consequence of this infection route, the incubation period is short, and large numbers of virus particles are produced rapidly. Within 48 hours of initial infection, the virus can reach 1 \u00b7 10 10 (ten billion) virus particles per gram of feces. Villous atrophy and cellular damage result in maldigestion and malabsorption. Maldigestion results from the loss of hydrolytic enzymes produced by mature villous cells. Failure to hydrolyze milk lactose results in lactose transit into the large intestine, where it acts osmotically, pulling water into the intestinal lumen. In addition to decreased enzyme activity, sodium and water transport processes are impaired, resulting in malabsorption. Some rotavirus strains are pneumotropic, replicating in the respiratory tract and transmitting via inhalation and by the fecal-oral route. Rotavirus is carried in adult cattle through nonclinical infection with intermittent fecal shedding [47] . Shedding increases coincident with later stages of gestation and for up to 4 weeks postpartum. In some management situations, this maternal shedding may account for most virus exposures to neonatal calves [28] .",

Although they may not be the same virus strains, evidence is mounting that a respiratory form as well as the enteric form occurs [97] . Similar to rotavirus, infection results in damage to intestinal villous epithelium; however, infection by coronavirus often results in more severe disease manifestations because the degree of villous atrophy is greater and both the large and small intestines are affected. As described for rotavirus, coronavirus is carried in adult cattle through nonclinical infection and is shed in fecal matter. Because of their envelope, these viruses retain infectiousness better at lower rather than higher relative humidity [24] and are considerably more sensitive to soaps and common disinfectants than are nonenveloped viruses. This virus is more active in the colder climates and has been reported to cause winter dysentery in adult cattle [16, 27] . Control of coronavirus (and rotavirus) infections in calves relies on continual presence of a protective antibody within the gut lumen, which can be achieved by allowing neonates to ingest colostrum or milk containing these specific antibodies from their dams (lactogenic immunity) [19] .",

            "text": "Cryptosporidium parvum is a common cause of neonatal calf diarrhea between 7 and 21 days of age, rarely causing diarrhea at less than 7 or more than 28 days of age [22] . Similar to rotavirus and coronavirus infection, the incidence of infection with cryptosporidia often approaches 100% in the first month of life, infection often occurs concurrently with rotavirus and coronavirus infections, and a respiratory form may occur. Unlike most other enteric protozoa, Cryptosporidium are immediately infectious when passed and can infect other susceptible hosts through direct contact. Because Cryptosporidium can autoinfect the original host, the infectious dose can be exceedingly small. For example, the median infectious dose for humans is only 87 oocysts [29] , and some researchers suggest it is even lower for neonatal calves. Cryptosporidia infect and invade enterocytes in the distal small intestine, causing villous atrophy and fusion that result in malabsorption and maldigestion. Infected calves may shed 10 5 to 10 7 oocysts per gram of feces beginning with the onset of clinical signs. Importantly, fecal shedding can continue days after clinical signs subside. In California beef cow-calf herds, Atwill et al [7] found that higher stocking densities, longer calving periods, and wetter seasons were associated with higher fecal shedding prevalences in calves. Research findings on the adult carrier state are conflicting, because some have found that adult carrier animals are common [92] , whereas others have found that few if any asymptomatic adult cattle apparently shed Cryptosporidium parvum in appreciable numbers [6, 55] . Undoubtedly, infected calves are likely the most important reservoir for continuing the fecal-oral cycle on most farms because of the large numbers of oocysts that they excrete in close proximity to susceptible calves [22] .",

Because the oocysts adhere in large numbers to the plastic and rubber surfaces of common calf-feeding and treatment equipment such as nipples, bottles, and buckets (E.R. Atwill, DVM, PhD, 2001, personal communication), common sanitation procedures are not likely to prevent fomite transmission by these items.

On the other hand, complete drying in thin, naturally infected fecal smears on wood kills the oocysts within 1 to 4 days [2] .

            "text": "Failure of passive transfer of maternal immunity through colostrum ingestion is a major risk factor for development of neonatal diarrhea [21, 56] . In the 1992 US Department of Agriculture National Dairy Heifer Evaluation Project, Wells et al [108] found that feeding a sufficient amount of colostrum soon enough after birth prevented 31% of the dairy heifer mortality that occurred in the first 21 days of life. Colostrum provides the necessary components of immunity during the time when a calf is immunonaive yet exposed to pathogens in its environment. Consumption of colostral immunoglobulin from resident cows in a herd is likely to provide immunologic protection specific to the strains of pathogens found within that herd. Importantly, even if colostral immunoglobulin specificity is appropriate for specific pathogens, maximum protection is ultimately dependent on the ingestion and absorption of an adequate mass of immunoglobulin by the calf. Immunoglobulin concentration varies from breed to breed, however, as well as from cow to cow within a breed. Such differences are well illustrated by the fact that the average concentration of immunoglobulin in beef cow colostrum is 2 to 3 times greater than that of dairy cow colostrum [73, 106] . As expected, the most important factor involved in failure of passive transfer in dairy calves is low immunoglobulin-concentration colostrum, whereas in beef calves delayed suckling is a leading cause [12] . For dairy cows, colostrum that is not from first milking, from cows that leaked milk, or from cows that weighed more than 20 lb should not be used for passive transfer [73] . In certain situations, beef calves may be provided alternate sources of colostrum, including colostrum obtained from nearby dairies. Again, it is imperative to appreciate that because the average immunoglobulin concentration of dairy cow colostrum is low compared with beef cow colostrum, an adequate volume (4 L) of appropriately selected dairy cow colostrum must be fed. In addition, one must also consider the risk of introducing novel pathogens when supplementing calves with an off-farm source of nonpasteurized colostrum. Unless properly pasteurized, dairy colostrum purchased for administration to beef calves in place of their dam's colostrum may be contaminated with infectious doses of undesirable infectious agents such as Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis as well as the enteric agents of concern described in this article.",

The composition and quality of milk replacers varies considerably, however, much to the detriment of very young calves with limited digestive capabilities. Some milk replacers contain heat-denatured, milk-origin proteins, poorly digestible vegetable-origin proteins, or nonlactose carbohydrate sources that the intestinal enzymes of neonatal calves cannot digest. Consumption of such products frequently results in inadequate nutrition, poor growth rates, and high morbidity and mortality due to enteric diseases [83] . Often the feeding recommendations for even high-quality milk replacers are designed for 60lb calves, rather than the average 90-lb Holstein calf, placing the larger calves into a negative energy and protein balance until their starter consumption increases sufficiently. Nutrition of the neonatal calf is an active area of research, much of which has been summarized by Davis and Drackley [21] , and changes in nutritional guidelines often reduce the risk of neonatal disease. In addition, excellent reviews on the relationship between neonatal digestive physiology and the different ingredients contained in milk replacers are available [37, 82] .",

Certainly, calves purchased from sale yards are more likely to have been exposed to higher concentrations and to a wider variety of pathogens compared with single-source calves or calves on pasture. Frequently, calves are purchased from market sources to graft onto cows that have lost their own offspring. Such purchased calves often introduce new strains of infectious agents that then spread through the herd in an outbreak fashion, making the situation considerably worse. In addition to increased exposure to pathogens, calves transiting through sale yards are likely to be under more severe physiologic stress and more likely to have had failure of passive transfer [106] .

Because of the difficulty of executing rigorously designed large-scale studies with sufficient herd numbers to evaluate all potential risk factors, reasoning from biological plausibility is often the only basis for developing interventions when sufficient evidence is not available. Although some findings are conflicting, a limited number of field studies of different size and rigor do provide guidance for some of these risk factors. For example, Bendali et al [11] found that cleaning of the calving area immediately before calving was associated with an increased risk of neonatal diarrhea in beef calves compared with not cleaning it, whereas cleaning it after calving was associated with a decreased risk. They also found that greater cow cleanliness was associated with decreased risk. Based on data from the 1997 US Department of Agriculture National Beef Cow-Calf Study, Sanderson and Dargatz [88] reported that although 41% of birth-to-weaning mortality was attributable to dystocia, 11% was due to confined calving. In the 1992 US Department of Agriculture National Dairy Heifer Evaluation Project, Wells et al [108] found that separating heifers from their dams within the first 24 hours after birth prevented 16% of the dairy heifer mortality that occurred during the first 21 days of life. Quigely et al [76] found that calves administered sufficient amounts of colostrum and housed in individual calf hutches shed fewer enteric pathogens in their feces than calves left to nurse their dam and housed in an enclosed space with mechanical ventilation. Schumann et al [91] found that increased risk of neonatal diarrhea in beef calves was associated with wintering cows and primigravida heifers together, providing limited shelter to nursing pairs, and an increased percentage of poorly drained ground in the nursing area. Although the occurrence of diarrhea was not affected, Sivula et al [95] found that increased gain was associated with all-in, all-out group management of weaned dairy calves.",

Although more important for respiratory disease, these factors in turn have an effect on the risk of enteric disease. Because salmonellosis, cryptosporidiosis, rotavirus, and coronavirus agents can be transmitted by aerosols, procedures that produce aerosols (pressure washing, housing flush systems) considerably increase the risk of transmission [9] .

During summer months before severe frosts, fly populations typically increase to high numbers around concentrated livestock operations such as dairies and calf-raising operations. Liquids such as diarrhea and milk or materials containing soluble components such as dried molasses and solid feces are attractive to nuisance flies. Because the larvae require greater than 90% humidity to develop, dampened organic calf bedding materials such as straw and sawdust provide an ideal substrate [89, 90] . The ability of these insects to transmit enteric pathogens from feces is well documented [18, 49] . Specific physical characteristics of flies, including mouth parts, body hairs and spines, and sticky foot pads can carry infectious agents in large numbers. Some pathogens pass through the fly digestive tract and remain viable in its feces. When feeding, the fly frequently moistens surfaces by regurgitating a ''vomit drop'' from its crop that contains residue, including infectious agents, from its previous meal. ''Fly spots'' are either such vomit drops or feces, both of which contain high numbers of infectious agents. Studies have determined that flies are attracted to diarrheic feces, that they can transmit Cryptosporidia in numbers higher than the minimal infectious dose for healthy humans, and that they can harbor this agent for 3 weeks after exposure [34] . Methods for controlling fly populations at different points in their life cycle have been reviewed [99] ; however, it is important to point out that control methods based on chemical means alone are usually inadequate because flies readily develop resistance to such chemicals.",

Once infected, particularly if infected clinically, such calves essentially act as biological amplifiers, amplifying a small but sufficient infectious dose into a much higher level of environmental contamination in their immediate surroundings and providing a high risk for transmission through direct contact. Because this increased environmental load likely exceeds the infectious dose threshold of individuals that were resistant to the prior environmental level, more individuals become infected, the infections are more severe because of the markedly higher dose, the environmental level increases even more, and an outbreak is underway. Evidence of such a cascade is provided in one study of herds in which calves that were born after the median calving date were twice as likely to develop diarrhea than those born before it [17] . Once started, such a cascade is much more difficult to stop as compared with preventing its initiation in the first place. Evidence that members of larger groups are at increased risk of diarrhea is contained in a study of Michigan dairies, which found that the incidence of calf diarrhea was approximately proportional to herd size [32] . This finding suggests that group sizes should be minimized as much as feasible, some researchers suggesting that the ideal group size is 50 [70] .",

Treatments should be instituted based on physical signs and, if possible, laboratory data. Diagnostic procedures such as fecal cultures, fecal flotation, and viral identification strategies can be performed. These tests are especially important when infection with Salmonella spp. is a major rule out for diarrhea. Identification of rotavirus and coronavirus infection and cryptosporidiosis are arguably less essential for diagnostic purposes because in most outbreaks of acute undifferentiated diarrhea, calves frequently shed one, two, or all three of the agents simultaneously. Detection of an infectious agent in a herd known through laboratory testing to be previously free of it, however, indicates that there has been a breach of herd biosecurity. Recovering calves should be quarantined away from other animals until after the shedding of pathogens has decreased to minimal levels or for at least 3 weeks. Aside from Salmonella spp., the neonatal enteric pathogens with the longest shedding time are rotavirus and coronavirus, which some individuals may shed intermittently for life.",

Explosive outbreaks of calf scours in beef herds are often associated with the prior purchase of a dairy calf from a sale yard to replace a calf lost because of dystocia or some other reason. A quarantine period of 21 days should be adequate to allow clinical identification of animals that are incubating any infection due to these enteric agents at the time of purchase. Quarantine of older animals for a similar period is justified because of the likelihood of increased shedding of enteric pathogens during periods of stress. Diagnostic procedures such as bacterial culture, viral detection by electron microscopy, and fecal flotation for parasite eggs can also be considered. Although it is unlikely that these tests will give a significant advantage compared with clinical observation and isolation, they can determine the etiologic agents involved. Use of such tests in older animals is less beneficial, because with the exception of Salmonella spp., many infected older animals shed low levels of enteric viruses. Because of the potential for false-negative results, testing may lead to a false sense of security, and management practices that are more important for establishing biosecurity may not be established and maintained.",

Because some aspects of these protocols involve significant additional effort, an understanding of why the additional effort is necessary will likely result in better adherence. Personnel and equipment flow as well as livestock flow and its effluent flow should be one-way, away from the youngest, most susceptible calves toward older, more resistant animals. On farms with sufficient personnel and equipment, tasks should be divided up between those personnel who remain ''clean'' for such tasks as mixing and delivering liquid feed and those who are potentially contaminated by performing tasks such as picking up empty milk bottles, treating sick calves, and so on. Personnel who are potentially contaminated through working with older or sick calves and their equipment should not return to areas with susceptible calves until they have changed their outer clothes and used appropriate procedures to thoroughly disinfect their hands, boots, and equipment.

Beef calves should be provided with adequate shelter during and after calving to avoid environmental stresses that lessen the calves' drive to rise and nurse. Ideally, calving should be monitored to ensure adequate mothering, which is especially important with first-calf heifers. Calves that do not rise and successfully nurse their dam within 1 to 2 hours should be assisted with nursing, or alternatively, force-fed either their dam's colostrum or frozen dairy cow colostrum. If dairy cow colostrum is used, its low average immunoglobulin concentration must be mitigated by feeding 4 liters within the first 12 hours of life. The producer must be aware that such colostrum may also be contaminated with enteric and other infectious agents (e.g., Mycobacterium avium subsp. paratuberculosis).",

Although there are likely numerous biological consequences of stress, a well-documented response involves the rapid and immediate increase in corticotropin secretion by the anterior pituitary gland, followed by greatly increased secretion of cortisol by the adrenal gland. Some of the beneficial effects of increased cortisol secretion include mobilization of labile proteins and fats from cellular stores for cellular energy needs, as well as numerous anti-inflammatory effects that aid in the resolution of inflammation. One of the more notable consequences of increased cortisol secretion, however, involves its extensive effects leading to immune suppression. In general, cortisol-induced atrophy of lymphoid tissues throughout the body leads to a significant decrease in both cellular and humoral immunity. It is this broad-ranging immune suppression that can lead to an increased incidence and severity of disease.",

Even the process of a normal parturition is a stressful condition as the fetal animal undergoes transition from intrauterine to extrauterine life. Fetal plasma cortisol levels double within minutes after uncomplicated parturition but typically decrease within the first days of life. The natural increase in plasma cortisol is necessary for normal pulmonary, intestinal, and brain development; pulmonary surfactant production; and preparation of liver glycogen stores for energy needs. Calves with dystocia are likely to have temporarily increased plasma cortisol levels and other significant laboratory abnormalities, including metabolic and respiratory acidosis and hypoglycemia [13] . Current studies indicate that the increased incidence of failure of passive transfer in calves with dystocia is not caused by a failure to absorb colostral immunoglobulins, but rather is due to the severe metabolic derangements that make these calves less likely to nurse in a timely fashion [106] . Alleviation of the stress of dystocia, therefore, should be directed toward correcting metabolic derangements and ensuring appropriate colostral intake.",

Although numerous risk factors related to the occurrence of neonatal diarrhea have been identified, they can all be categorized into those that are related to the calf, the pathogens involved, or the environment of the calf. The immune status of calves, specifically the level of passively acquired immunity through colostrum, is the major risk factor related to the calf and the occurrence of diarrhea. Although numerous pathogens have been implicated in the occurrence of neonatal diarrhea, only a relatively limited number are commonly involved. Most should be viewed as secondary opportunists rather than primary pathogens, because none are extraordinarily virulent, and with the exception of Salmonella spp., most are present within the gastrointestinal tract of many healthy, mature cattle. Important risk factors related to pathogens involved in neonatal calf diarrhea involve the size of the inoculum and the occurrence of multiple infections. Finally, when considering the environment and housing conditions in which beef and dairy calves may reside, it is clear that tremendous variations exist. Despite these variations, the risk factors associated with the environment of the calf are also those that are the most amenable to the implementation of general environmental control and monitoring strategies as well as specific biosecurity measures.",
