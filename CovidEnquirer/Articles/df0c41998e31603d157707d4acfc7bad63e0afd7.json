In this study the development of a real-time TaqMan \u00ae RT-PCR targeting the highly conserved nucleocapsid (N) gene of IBV and including an internal PCR control is described. The assay was specific for IBV and did not detect other avian pathogens, including turkey coronaviruses. A comparative limit of detection was determined for M41, an embryo-adapted strain, and IS/885/00, a poorly embryo-adapted variant. For M41 real-time RT-PCR and virus isolation were one or two times more sensitive than RT-PCR targeting the N or spike glycoprotein (S1) genes, respectively. For IS/885/00, real-time RT-PCR was more sensitive by tenfold than virus isolation and 30-or 40-fold than by N gene or S1 gene RT-PCR, respectively. Real-time RT-PCR and virus isolation were 17-75% more sensitive than RT-PCR targeting the S1 gene for testing tracheal swabs directly from experimentally infected chicks. When tracheal and cloacal swabs from clinical specimens were tested directly, 50% more samples were positive by real-time RT-PCR than by the S1 gene RT-PCR. Real-time RT-PCR targeting the N gene is more sensitive than common diagnostic assays, allowing rapid and accurate IBV detection directly from clinical specimens, facilitating differential diagnosis.",

            "text": "Infectious bronchitis (IB) is a highly contagious viral disease of the upper-respiratory tract in chickens (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008) . It is prevalent in all countries with an intensive poultry industry, affecting the performance of both meat-type and egglaying birds, thereby causing considerable economic loss within the poultry industry. Although a respiratory disease is the most frequently observed syndrome (Cavanagh and Gelb, 2008; McMartin, 1993) this same virus has also been implicated in nephritis, as reported from many countries (Ignjatovic et al., 2002; Meir et al., 2004; Winterfield and Albassam, 1984; Ziegler et al., 2002) . The etiologic agent is infectious bronchitis virus (IBV), a coronavirus that belongs to the family Coronaviridae, genus Coronavirus, group 3, which includes only avian coronaviruses. It is an enveloped, positive-sense, single-stranded RNA virus (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997) , containing three major structural proteins: the nucleocap- sid (N), surrounding the viral RNA; the membrane glycoprotein (M); and the spike glycoprotein (S), located on the surface of the viral envelope. The S protein contains two post-translational sub-units, S1, and S2. Control of the disease is mostly through the use of live attenuated vaccines, but vaccination is only partially successful due to the frequent emergence of antigenic variants (Ignjatovic and Sapats, 2000; Meir et al., 2003; Moore et al., 1998) . Detection of IBV infection in poultry flocks, as well as differentiation from other upper-respiratory diseases, is a major challenge and necessitates the use of appropriate diagnostic methods.",

            "text": "Virus isolation in specific pathogen-free (SPF) eggs, the reference standard, is time-consuming and may require more than one passage before obtaining a result (Gelb and Jackwood, 1998) . Reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) assays are rapid, specific, and accurate, and when targeting the viral S1 gene, the amplification products can be used for further classification of the virus (Cavanagh et al., 1990; Gelb et al., 2005; Jackwood et al., 1997; Lee et al., 2000) . Nevertheless, compared to virus isolation, these assays may lack sensitivity when used directly from clinical specimens. To overcome this drawback, viral RNA extraction is preceded by propagation of the virus in embryonated eggs for 36-48 h (Kwon et al., 1993; Meir et al., 2004) . Real-time RT-PCR assays that make use of a labeled TaqMan \u00ae probe are designed to amplify a small fragment of up to 200 bp. These features render the assay very specific and sensitive, as was demonstrated with viruses (Emery et al., 2004) and type A influenza virus (Cattoli et al., 2004) . A real-time RT-PCR assay amplifying a fragment of the 5 untranslated region (UTR) of the IBV genome was highly sensitive but not specific, detecting turkey coronaviruses (TCoV) as well as IBV (Callison et al., 2006) . The frequent occurrence of TCoV in the poultry industry, as well as its relatedness to IBV (Breslin et al., 1999) , necessitates an assay that can differentiate between these two viruses. In this study a real-time TaqMan \u00ae RT-PCR targeting the N gene for IBV detection was developed. The N gene was chosen since it is highly conserved among IBV strains and is abundant in infected cells. The assay was tested with tracheal or cloacal swabs directly from chickens infected experimentally and clinical submissions, without amplification in embryonated eggs, and validated with known positive and negative samples. The sensitivity was compared to virus isolation and RT-PCR targeting the N and S1 genes.",

In addition to the relatively short run time, at the end of which results are obtained directly, real-time RT-PCR is a quantitative assay and can be used for absolute or relative viral RNA quantitation. The small target size combined with the use of a labeled probe increases the specificity and sensitivity of the assay. The TaqMan \u00ae -probe-based real-time RT-PCR assay described in this study targets the N gene of IBV, which is less variable than the S1 gene, with homologies greater than 90% among IBV strains (Williams et al., 1992) . The primers and probe are designed to amplify a conserved fragment of the gene, and identify isolates representing all Israeli variants, the reference strain M41, and the vaccine strains H120 and 4/91 as well as a wide spectrum of IBV variants analyzed in silico. The addition of an internal positive control for the detection of PCR-inhibitors allows the distinction between true and false negatives. As a result, 3% of putative negative clinical samples or, clinical samples that did not amplify in the PCR assays were found to be false negatives. The assay did not detect TCoV, a frequent pathogen in the turkey industry. TCoV can infect chickens without causing a disease (Cavavagh, 2005) , and its detection in clinical samples from chickens can be misleading for diagnosis.",
