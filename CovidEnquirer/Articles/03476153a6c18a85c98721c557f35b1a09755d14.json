However, these large repositories of genomic, and other, sequence information have a relatively simple flat-file structure. When submitting a viral genome sequence to one these databases, the sequence data must be annotated with various information including the positions of coding DNA sequences (CDS). Flat-file databases can only be queried for information that is explicitly stated within the file. For example, queries can be made by keywords in the protein name, but not derivative characteristics such as gene length. In contrast, a relational database stores additional information (calculated or predicted), which is derived from data within the flat-file and organized into tables with defined relationships. In this way, relational databases permit queries related to these derivative characteristics. For example, the calculation and storage of protein size permits queries for 200 aa < proteins < 300 aa in length. When building such a relational database, the designer must define the structure of all of the data records to be stored and their association to each other. The database schema illustrates these relationships and acts as a map to the organization of the data storage locations, that is specific containers (dataset tables) for storing each type of dataset. Fig. 1 illustrates a sample of the schema for the VOCs RDMS. Schema are not literal representations of data organization, but they are useful for helping the database designers and users understand the basic structure, and allowing them to collaborate on the specifics of database design and structure.",

GenBank is a flat-file format, which offers the significant advantage of a file format that is human-readable. Similarly, these files can be worked with using standard text editors or word-processing programs. A downside is that minor changes to the format of GenBank files can cause software tools that read these files (parsers) to fail if they have not been programmed to handle these differences. In attempts to more strictly manage the formatting of information while giving the flexibility of using various data types, some tools use an extensible markup language (XML). XML formatting explicitly defines relationships among data; data fields are embedded within each other to define their relationships. Although XML files are excellent for representing relationships in a form that can be read by a computer, they are more difficult for users to understand.",

They consist of the relational database and the software required to manage the database. Some of the most popular are Oracle, MySQL, Microsoft SQL Server and PostgreSQL. However, if a database is to be useful to the virology research community, then there must be at least one additional component in this system -an easy to use interface to enable a virologist to interact with the database, i.e. send queries to the database and retrieve information in a variety of formats. Furthermore, the database itself may form part of an analysis pipeline. In this case, the information that is retrieved from the database is sent directly to an analysis tool, which subsequently returns the processed information to the user. Rather than the database returning a file of the sequences to be formatted before submission to a program such as ClustalO or MUSCLE for alignment, it might be desirable to have the database send the sequences directly to the alignment tool. The tool can then run the desired function before returning the processed data within a visualization tool that simplifies editing of the final MSA. Although simplification of this process with default parameters is clearly valuable to the user, over-simplification can lead to restricted function, i.e. a lack of ability to alter analysis parameters. Therefore, it is valuable to provide a variety of export options allowing users to obtain formats that can be used directly with multiple analysis tools and permit full range of parameter access, as discussed in later sections. Design of the user interface with potential queries and flexibility of data retrieval in mind is key to the utility of the database.",

The database schema depicts the various data storage tables, which are based on data types such as: genome/gene/protein sequence, taxonomy or gene properties (position in genome, nucleotide/amino acid composition); the VOCs database also places all genes within an ortholog table (Fig. 1) . The relationships between these tables are explicitly defined and are not limited to one-to-one relationships. For example, genome-to-gene relationships show a one-to-many relationship, whereas gene-to-ortholog relationships have a many-toone relationship.",

One aspect of maintenance is the process of maintaining the software and hardware over the life of the database -often the most difficult part is justifying and obtaining funding in a research environment. Over time, bugs need fixing, hardware fails and systems are upgradedall are part of an ongoing process associated with many bioinformatics projects. A second view of maintenance, which is more integral to database design, concerns the data: 1) how will data be imported into the database? 2) will data need to be edited (updated/corrected)? Again, these questions have a natural division along the lines of virus genome type. For example, some form of automated process is essential to import the thousands of genomes required for an influenza or HCV (small genomes, fixed gene complement) resource, but these small sequences are unlikely to need subsequent modification. In contrast, a resource such as Virology.ca, which deals with large poxviruses, needs to contend with far less genomes, but must handle changes to genome annotation both before and after import into the database due to large, less well characterized, dsDNA genomes. Therefore, while a software script to automatically collect new genome GenBank files and insert them into a database might be feasible for an influenza virus database, this process cannot be used for poxvirus genomes in Virology.ca. The complexity of the latter frequently leads to variations (sometimes errors) in annotation protocols. Furthermore, new discoveries surrounding gene function mean that old genomes must sometimes be re-annotated. Therefore, key to the design of database systems like Virology.ca is the inclusion of a manual, user-friendly database-editing tool that will allow virologists to enter and maintain the data.",

For example, use of the highlight orthologs option in the Viral Genome Organizer (VGO) visualization tool (Fig. 2) assists in the comparison and understanding of genome synteny. Although orthology is simply the prediction of a common ancestor between genes of different species, the extreme diversity among viruses in a single taxonomic family creates difficulties in the accurate assignment of genes to ortholog groups. This and the existence of paralogs (related genes within a single genome) lead to a need for the ability to easily edit these ortholog assignments.",

As a result, it would be hard to find a virologist who hasn't performed a BLAST search of these databases. Similarly, any virologist who has partially or completely sequenced a viral genome is familiar with the process of annotating the sequence for submission to GenBank (or local equivalent) before their paper can be published. Three levels of annotated information exist: basic information within a GenBank file that can be directly transferred into databases; values calculated or predicted from the basic data; and curated information, beyond that provided when first developing the GenBank file, added manually by users. The GenBank sequence file usually contains basic virus identification information, affiliations of the annotator, CDS locations within the genome, metadata, gene and product type/names, as well as mRNA splicing information, if appropriate. Many virus databases simply import annotations from GenBank sequence files and do not provide any further information. However, the sequence data itself can be used to calculate various values that might be required by the end-user such as A + T content, protein pI, molecular mass of proteins and amino acid content. Additionally, the data may be used as input for predictive tools, such as those that look for functional motifs that are associated with enzymatic function or protein localization. Manual curation can also provide additional information. For example, there is generally no information describing the likely reliability of the annotations or the source of the information (experimental data, software prediction or scientific literature) within a GenBank file. Therefore, inclusion of this data requires manual curation by users. Unfortunately, it is rare that this kind of supplementary information is incorporated into databases in a manner that can be searched in a meaningful way.",

Functional assignment of the associated proteins relies heavily on the transfer of function from orthologous proteins. Orthologous proteins, which may only be 20-30% identical, often do not match the same set of functional motifs, and vary in their ability to match distantly-related proteins that might give important clues as to function. In such investigations, it is useful to work with a set of diverse orthologs rather than the gene from a favourite virus.",

However, this must be built upon a foundation of accurate, and preferably complete, genome sequencing. The complexity of the annotation problem increases exponentially with genome size and novelty. Small viruses have only a few genes and usually do not vary in gene content within a species, whereas poxviruses range in size from 134 to 360 kb and encode between 129 and 335 genes. Large viruses, such as these, bring two additional complications to the annotation problem: 1) only a subset of the viral genes are essential, so some orthologs may be functional in one species but fragmented in another and, 2) some of the more diverse viruses have > 100 genes currently annotated as \"hypothetical\", and even the DNA polymerase protein may share only 32% aa identity with its closest relative. These problems are even greater in the Megaviruses that have genomes greater than 1000 kb, illustrating the increase of annotation issues with genome size. Without the use of either a closely related genome, or multiple more distant relatives with similar gene sets, for reference genomes in annotation, it is very difficult to predict which ORFs are: true genes, gene fragments, or random small ORFs. Similar problems are encountered when virologists try to annotate the extremely diverse genomes of bacteriophages. Although some groups share common physical virion structures, often only a few genes are found in common between related groups of phage. This is due to their non-linear evolutionary pathway; bacteriophages commonly undergo recombination events generating mosaic gene distributions among genomes. Thus, the complexity of annotation relates directly to viral genome size and diversity.",

The function of GATU is to remove easy, but tedious, genome annotation steps from the workflow of the annotators allowing them to focus on the more difficult decisions. GATU uses BLAST to search the target genome for each of the genes present in the reference genome. If they are matched over sufficient length and with sufficient identity, the gene is automatically scored for the target genome. Both partial matches and potential novel genes are flagged in the GATU interface for the annotator to investigate further and make a final decision; tools are included in GATU to make this process easier.",

Fig. 3 , panel A shows the organization of a normal poxvirus gene, and panels B, C and D illustrate 3 classes of mutations that often complicate the annotation of poxvirus genes and require annotator input. In panel B, a mutation has introduced a premature STOP codon that leads to a C-terminal truncation (25%) of the protein product. Although this change might alter a protein's function, most annotators would probably annotate this altered gene. In panel C, a mutation has introduced a premature STOP codon that leads to a C-terminal truncation (80%) of the protein product (labeled Ci). In this example the greatly shortened protein is very unlikely to be functional, however, because the second part of the gene is still present and represents 70% of the original gene this is sometimes annotated (Cii) even though it is very unlikely to be translated from the mRNA. In panel D, a mutation has not changed the gene or promoter, but instead extended the ORF to a position upstream of the promoter. Although the protein product is not changed, the larger ORF is sometimes erroneously annotated.

For example, a nucleotide substitution that introduces a STOP codon into the middle of the poliovirus single large ORF will certainly not be missed because it is not consistent with a functional genome.

Another limitation of most databases is the absence of evidence for particular annotations.

However, even when evidence notes are present, there may be problems since experiments may eventually be discredited and/or require updates. Curating such a system, essentially with the annotations as a living document, would also be incredibly labor intensive. The lack of an unambiguous and controlled naming standard that is carried across all viruses and databases results in variable descriptions and data that are difficult to query for specific characteristics. For example, software may not be programmed to recognise synonymous terms such as \"ssDNA,\" \"single strand DNA,\" \"single-stranded DNA,\" and \"single stranded DNA\" as the same. Where possible, import systems should have locks on permitted words, based on a universal, controlled vocabulary, in order to reduce this ambiguity. For example, to only permit \"ssDNA\". Presently, the Gene Ontology Consortium (GO; www. geneontology.org/) offers a controlled vocabulary that is unique and informative. Since 2006, GO has expanded and standardised viral terms and, where appropriate, has cross-referenced and aligned these with the ViralZone (viralzone.expasy.org) and UniProtKB-keywords (among other resources). In addition, although some terms will still be applicable to only particular viruses (eg, the phages, see viral head-tail joining; GO:0098005), GO viral terms are designed to be species-neutral where possible. However, complete implementation of a consistent and accurate vocabulary, such as that presented by GO, will only work if scientists choose to sustain it through their own participation. But the reward is an overarching, standardized vocabulary for all species and databases that simplifies comparisons and reduces misspelling and ambiguity.",

Therefore, it is important for database designs to accommodate the needs of the researcher and the characteristics of the virus type. For example, in a study examining the genomic variation of H1N1 influenza viruses obtained from humans between the years of 2000-2010, the researchers would have specific search parameters regarding influenza A subtype, host species, and year of isolation. If the search interface did not permit all of these search parameters, then the researcher would be left with an arduous task of manually sorting the results that, depending upon the volume of information and computer skills of the user, may be far too time consuming. Another aspect of the searching, which is virus-specific, is that for viruses with high sequencing volumes at similar times and locations, such as influenza, there may be many identical genomes in the database. Therefore, databases dealing with this type of virus need to have an exclude identical genomes filter. Examples illustrating typical database queries for small and large genomes are discussed below and displayed in Table 2 .",

FASTA formatting of nucleotide and protein sequences is a standard because multiple sequences can be incorporated into one file, and they can be read by many bioinformatics programs. However, most annotations are stripped out of these files. In contrast, GenBank files contain gene annotations, but these files can be tricky for software to read due to non-standard formatting errors. The most basic output format is comma-separated values (csv), a tabular output that can often be read by other software, or even spreadsheet programs such as Microsoft Excel. Yet, for many researchers data in these formats is very tedious to use. Therefore, databases are frequently paired with visualization and analysis tools, or permit the export of data in a format that can be accepted by external programs. For example, the Virology.ca database, VOCs, is linked to the Base-By-Base (BBB) visualization tool, which displays and allows editing of MSAs. Additionally, the VOCs database provides users with a series of standard export options to permit use in other applications: 1) write selected sequences to a FASTA file, 2) write selected sequences to GenBank files, and 3) send selected sequences to a window in FASTA format, allowing easy copy/paste functions.",

Collectively, the databases form The International Nucleotide Sequence Database Collaborative (INSDC). All nucleotide sequence data submitted to the INSDC is shared among the databases. This provides up-to-date public access to nucleotide sequence data that can be accessed through any of the three interfaces. In an attempt to keep the databases up-to-date, most scientific journals require that genome sequences are submitted to one of the INSDC databases prior to publication. INSDC also hosts databases for raw sequencing data and alignment information used to create the final genome sequences, including the Trace Archive for capillary reads, and Sequence Read Archive for Next Generation Sequence reads. This information helps in the reproducibility of genome assemblies in cases requiring review, and allows the user to analyse whether unexpected results are characteristic of the virus or a systematic artifact. However, advances in sequencing technology raise the question of the value of saving raw sequencing data; re-sequencing of samples (given their availability) is fast, easy, cheap and increasingly accurate.",

The International Committee on Taxonomy of Viruses (ICTV; http://www.ictvonline.org/virustaxonomy.asp) is recognized as the official group for assigning viral taxonomy and nomenclature to the species level and higher. Divisions within species, such as clades, subgroups, strains and isolates are outside the scope of ICTV. This information, defining relationships among viruses, aids in the classification and understanding of newly discovered viruses. The classification scheme of the ICTV is assigned based upon viral morphology, structural characteristics and sequence-based comparisons, which have largely replaced serotyping. Assignments are supported by verifiable data, and the consensus of experts who are organized into a series of subcommittees and associated study groups for each viral species. The committees assign new isolates to existing taxonomic groups, or establish new taxonomic groups to support unique viruses. The current release, the 2014 ICTV taxonomy, comprises 7 orders, 104 families, 23 subfamilies, 505 genera, and 3186 species. However, there are 78 families of viruses that not assigned to an order, including one called Unassigned, which contains 14 genera.",

More than ever, there is an overwhelming need to organize this giant hairball of nucleotide strings. Sequences need to be organized to facilitate the process of similarity searching, for example with BLAST, for related sequences and also organized by functional or source (human, rodent, virus) relationships. However, it's neither feasible nor affordable to create independent database resources for every organism, therefore resources like ViPRbrc that can function with a variety of viruses may become more commonplace.",

            "text": "With respect to genome sequencing, one of the greatest problems lies with the huge volume of raw data (sequencing reads) that is associated with any final genome sequence. The authors recently received 3 GB of compressed sequencing data, a mix of host and virus sequences, to assemble a 150 kb poxvirus genome; it is estimated that genomic data will soon become the world's largest consumer of disk storage. Therefore, one question that is frequently asked is, when will it be cheaper to recollect the data than store the data? Although storage of raw sequencing data is a somewhat different problem than the organization of genomes to allow maximum use by researchers, it provides a valuable illustration as to where our capacity for genome sequencing is heading. Perhaps, in the not too distant future, it will not be unusual to have our own genome sequenced, as well as our various organ microbiomes and the genomes of any pathogens we are infected by. To deal with the benefits of the new sequencing technology's ability to generate massive sequence coverage, which helps to reduce errors in the initial sequencing process and reveals the natural variation among the genomes of a virus population, we must also develop new annotation strategies such as how to annotate SNPs in virus genomes and gene fragments in the non-essential gene sets of large viruses. The goal of this type of annotation is to provide the virologist with more information in comparative studies. Often large viruses with different virulence phenotypes are compared through asking, what genes are in virus A and absent in virus B? The questioner is really asking about the presence of functional genes, but would likely be interested in knowing the mechanism of the deletion. For example, whether the gene was inactivated by a series of deletions or a single nucleotide change that could be the result of a sequencing error.",

Since many organisms fail to grow in the laboratory, we cannot grow viruses that are unique to them; thus, metagenomics provides a valuable window into the previously unknown diversity of viruses in the environment. Even with large-scale environmental sequencing under way, most metagenomic sequences appear to be unrelated to currently known sequences. These unique sequences represent a vast new pool of genes and functions for the research community.",

            "text": "However, metagenomics also comes with its own list of special problems and limitations. Most issues arise in assembly, gene prediction or the integration of metadata to sequence data. Genomic assembly can be difficult because the metagenomic short reads often provide less coverage than traditional sequencing. As well, misassembly of sequences due to repetitive DNA sequences is increased by the large number of different genomes in an environmental sample and the varying relative abundance of individual genomes. Although assembly against a reference genome is helpful, this approach can't be used with environmental samples full of unknown microbial species. These issues of genome misassembly and lack of reference genomes also complicate gene prediction, which impedes accurate genome annotation. Furthermore, metadata is often left out of annotations, yet it is required for the data to be put into a useful, comparable, biological context. For example, in phylogeographical studies of epidemics and new outbreaks, a growing area of bioinformatic analysis, dates and location of collection are critical values. Thus, it is crucial that annotation of metadata be included as a mandatory and standardized component of genome submission.",

Even when matches between orthologs may be at the limit of detection, the greater the number of sequences in a cluster, the greater the chance of making new matches by virtue of transitive sequence comparisons, that is SeqA matches SeqB, but not SeqC; if SeqB also matches SeqC then a transitive relationship between SeqA and SeqC is established. NCBI offers protMap, an application that provides visualization of all genomes containing genes within a COG or VOG of interest, highlighting and centering the genomes to display the orthologs. In a 2016 publication, EMBL released eggNOG 4.5 (eggnogdb.embl.de/), essentially COGs remade with improved algorithms, with support for more than 2000 organisms, and the addition of a branch containing 352 viral proteomes. Several features of this updated version may help increase the knowledge and use of ortholog groups by the virology community: the new web interface is simplified for less experienced users and offers new browsing and visualization capabilities; the new version has improved consistency and impact through incorporation and linking of Gene Ontology terms, KEGG pathways and UniProt and SMART/Pfam domains to ortholog group assignments; and the algorithms and pipelines for assignment are made freely available on the website, encouraging individuals to apply the techniques to their own datasets.",
