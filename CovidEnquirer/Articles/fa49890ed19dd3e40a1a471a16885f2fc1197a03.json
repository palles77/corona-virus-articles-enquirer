They contain membrane and cytosolic proteins and molecules essential for exosome biogenesis. Exosomes also have cell-specific components including proteins, messenger RNA, and microRNA (miRNA; Figure 2 ). 12 Exosome-specific proteins include CD9, CD63, CD81, and CD82; proteins involved in exosome biogenesis include actin, annexins, tumor susceptibility gene 101, fibronectin-1, and vesicle-associated membrane protein 8. 13 Exosomes derived from cancer cells harbor dicer AGO2 and TRBP proteins, which can convert pre-miRNA into mature miRNA, leading to silencing of messenger RNA of target cells and initiate tumors. Hence, it has been proposed that differentially expressed protein and miRNA in cancer-derived exosomes may serve as potential biomarkers. 14 Few reports describe the characteristics of exosomes found in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) and serum samples after LTx. 15 , 16 Gregson and colleagues 15 analyzed exosomal RNA collected from BALF following LTx and demonstrated that exosomes isolated from patients with acute cellular rejection are distinct, with their molecular signatures primarily involving immune activation in VIDEO 1 . Exosomes in lung trasplant outcomes: Circulatory exosomes with lung-associated antigens are present in primary graft dysfunction, before development of donor-specific antibodies, acute rejection, and chronic rejection. Therefore, circulatory exosomes with lung-associated antigens are a novel mechanism of inducing immune responses leading to rejection of graft after lung transplantation.

These results suggest that exosomes induced during rejection of the transplanted lungs can induce immune responses, thereby increasing the risk of development of BOS. 16 Heart and skin transplant models in mice have shown that donor-derived exosomes containing donor MHC can cross-dress recipient antigenpresenting cells, leading to activation and proliferation of alloreactive T cells via the semi-direct pathway of allorecognition. 20, 21 Previous studies from our laboratory have shown that Abs to HLA and/or tissue-restricted SAgs develop months before lung allograft rejection, suggesting a pathogenic role for Abs in the development of BOS following LTx. 20 Furthermore, in most patients who develop either Abs to HLA or Abs to lung SAgs have a greater chance of developing Abs to each other, suggesting spreading of immune ",

The results presented here and studies in murine models strongly support an important role for exosomes in inducing and spreading of immune responses leading to CLAD. 22, 23 In this study, we demonstrated that increased expression of Col-V and Ka1T in circulating exosomes isolated from LTxRs developed PGD, RVI, AR, DSA, and BOS. The exosomes also contained MHC class II molecules, its transcription factor CIITA, and proinflammatory transcription factors such as NF-kb and HIFa and 20S proteosome. Furthermore, exosomes from LTxRs with PGD3, AR, and BOS contained co-stimulatory molecules (CD80, 86), supporting the theory that the exosomes can be highly immunogenic. An important role for 20S proteasome in augmenting immune responses by exosomes was recently presented by Dieude and colleagues. 24 They showed that humoral immune responses in mice to the kidney SAg perlecan are induced by the presence of 20s proteasomes within the exosomes, and removal of the activity of proteasome abrogated the immune responses to perlecan. 24 We demonstrated that mice immunized with exosomes isolated from LTxRs diagnosed with BOS induced development of both humoral and cellular immune responses to Col-V and Ka1T, but not in stable patients. 16 In addition, distinct differences were noted in exosomes between BOS and stable LTxRs with respect to their immunogenicity. 22 Using a syngeneic cardiac transplant model, Sharma and colleagues 23 demonstrated that Abs to cardiac myosin administered immediately following syngeneic murine heterotopic cardiac transplant results in graft failure, and the released exosomes contain cardiac myosin and vimentin. Further, this study demonstrated an important role for exosomes in graft failure, as immunization with exosomes isolated from sera following graft failure also developed Abs to cardiac myosin and vimentin and resulted in graft loss 8 days after syngeneic cardiac transplant. 23 Following human renal transplantation, there is evidence for release of increased levels of circulating C4d \u00fe plasma endothelial microvesicles that correlated with antibody-mediated AR. 25 This indicates that Abs developed de novo can induce exosomes and may participate in antibody-mediated rejection. 25 One of the major limitations of this study is relatively small number of patients analyzed for each clinical condition and not analyzing various sub categories. Future studies are needed to with exosomes isolated from different grades of PGD, AR, as well as BOS.",

These circulating exosomes are distinct in their properties compared with stable LTxRs with respect to the presence of tissue-associated lung SAgs Col-V and Ka1T, costimulatory molecules, MHC class II, its transcription factor CIITA, proinflammatory transcription factors including NF-kB, HIFa, and 20S proteasome. We propose that the induction of circulating exosomes is an important unifying mechanistic link between PGD, RVI, and alloimmune responses that increase the risk for the development of CLAD following LTx.",
