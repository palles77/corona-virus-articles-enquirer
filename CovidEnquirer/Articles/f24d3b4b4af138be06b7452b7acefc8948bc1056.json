It can be found that the implementation of population mobility control at two points in time, and the difference in the degree of population mobility control, the proportion of I-status users has changed significantly. A conclusion similar to that of the E-status is obtained, that is, in order to reduce the proportion of the I-status users, measures to reduce population mobility should be implemented as soon as possible. .

When t = 50, compared with the lowmeasure group (the percentage of D-status in almost all communities exceeds 50%), the range of the D-status ratio in the high-measure group is [0.5-1]. Areas above 100% (gray) appear at t = 50, which is because the random flow of people makes the number of people in some communities higher than the initial stage. This result further validates that \"the sooner, the higher the degree of implementation of the measures to reduce the movement of people, the better the effect of controlling the spread of the epidemic.\" This study further validates the concerns of international and domestic experts regarding asymptomatic transmission (ie, E-status in this article). This article suggests that as long as medical resources are available, E-status individuals or potential E-status individuals should be included in the scope of isolation and treatment. The government should promptly release information on the epidemic situation, as well as information on the areas and vehicles used by the infected people, to further encourage those who have been in contact with individuals in the I or E-status to go to nearby hospitals for timely inspection.",

In contrast, if this measure is implemented late (MT = 20), the influence of different levels of flow control measures on the proportion of E-status users is not obvious (such as MU = 0.01, 0.1, the peaks are close to 50 %).

This may be because although the I-status individuals have been isolated and treated, there are still a large number of E-status individuals in the population. These individuals also have the ability to infect, that is, the ability to make other S-status individuals into Estate individuals. From the perspective of the proportion of individuals in the I state, the peak of the proportion of individuals in the E-status changed significantly in the four groups. Among them, the group with a high level of treatment (PI = 0.7) and the early start of treatment (PT = 10) had a lower proportion of I-status individuals, and the peak appeared earlier. Therefore, starting early isolation and treatment of I-status individuals and continuously improving the level of treatment (more I-status individuals can be treated) will help reduce the proportion of I-status individuals in the population. Such findings explain why it is necessary to coordinate national medical science and technology resources to support Wuhan, and why it is necessary to build Leishenshan Hospital and Huoshenshan Hospital, because improving treatment levels as soon as possible is an important way to reduce the spread of the epidemic. builds a SEIRD model that considers the movement of people across regions, revealing the effects of three measures (quarantine of infected people, reduction of movement of people, and improvement of treatment) on controlling the spread of the epidemic. The research results show that current prevention and control measures in China are very necessary. The results of this study are applicable to explore the impact of the implementation of relevant measures on the prevention and control of epidemic spread, and to identify key individuals that may exist during the spread of the epidemic.",
