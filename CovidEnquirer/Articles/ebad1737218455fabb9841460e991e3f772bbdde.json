            "text": "Multiple sclerosis (MS) is a chronic disorder of the central nervous system characterized pathologically by multifocal regions of perivascular inflammation, demyelination, and gliosis and clinically by a relapsing or chronic disease course (or both). This inflammatory pathologic picture has prompted the postulate that immune mechanisms induced by autoantigens or viral infection mediate the tissue injury. This postulate is supported by epidemiologic data that indicate a 30 to 50% disease concordance rate among identical twins, an overrepresentation of disease in various racial groups correlated with particular major histocompatibility complex gene products, a linkage of susceptibility with certain T-cell receptor genes, and the suggestion that migration beyond a critical age results in retaining the risk rate ofthe country of origin. Animal models of chronic demyelination induced by autoantigen sensitization (experimental allergic encephalomyelitis), by lytic infection of oligodendrocytes (neurotropic mouse hepatitis [JHM] virus, canine distemper), and by viral-induced immune mechanisms (Theiler murine encephalomyelitis virus, JHM virus in rats) provide evidence that such viral or immune mechanisms (or both) can induce chronic demyelinating disease of the central nervous system.",

Recent examples of technologic advances relevant to MS include neuroimaging techniques that allow following the evolution of lesions in patients with MS, the isolation and maintenance of myelin-reactive T-cell lines from patients with MS and control subjects, novel tissue culture and cell biologic approaches to myelinating cells (oligodendrocytes), and the molecular biologic analyses of gene products critical for viral persistence. The search for unique viruses in MS has included indirect (serologic) and direct (immunofluorescence, electron microscopy, tissue culture, in situ hybridization, molecular cloning) techniques. Candidate viruses have included double-stranded DNA viruses (for example, herpes simplex) and singlestranded RNA viruses (paramyxovirusesparainfluenza, measles, coronavirus). None has met the requirements of Koch's postulates with regard to MS, although some are able to induce the presumed ' immunopathogenic uniphasic post-infectious encephalomyelitis syndrome in humans.or demyelination ofthe central nervous system in animals.",

The term \"retrovirus\" is derived from the replication cycle of these enveloped singlestranded RNA viruses, which occurs through a double-stranded DNA intermediate synthesized by an RNA-dependent DNA polymerase (reverse transcriptase). A sheep retrovirus, visna, has long been known to persist within the nervous system and to induce an inflammatory chronic demyelinating disease, although the precise basis for the tissue injury-direct cytopathic or indirect immunopathogenic-remains to be determined. In 1985, the initial reports indicated that, based on serologic evidence, a progressive myelopathic syndrome endemic to tropical regions of Central America-that is, tropical spastic paraparesis (TSP)-and to specific regions of Japan-that is, human T-celllymphotropic virus type I (H'I'Lv-Il-associated myelopathy (HAM)-was associated with HTLV-I retrovirus infection. Subsequently, HTLV-I was directly identified in and isolated from lymphoid cells of the cerebrospinal fluid of such patients.",

The inflammation seems to be the primary lesion. Prominent neuropathologic changes also include fibrous thickening of the adventitia of blood vessels and prominent microglial accumulation. The extent of the degeneration of the white matter is distinct from the pathologic findings in MS. To date, direct viral persistence within primary cells of the central nervous system has not been substantiated although HTLV-I infection of adult glial cells in vitro has been reported.\" The neurologic syndrome develops in less than 1% of HTLV-Iinfected persons, consistent with the concept of an autoimmune process associated with a persistent infection ofT lymphocytes rather than a direct infection of tissue in the central nervous system. Jacobson and colleagues\" demonstrated that only the affected persons have class I major histocompatibility complex-restricted cytotoxic T cells directed against the HTLV-I tax protein encoded in the regulatory region pX. These T cells could represent a unique response to the virus by neurologically affected persons or could reflect the response in patients with high viral loads.",

The major controversy about HTLV-I in MS relates to \"false-positive\" results because \"false-negative\" findings could not be otherwise confirmed. Patients have been selected for study on the basis of clinical criteria, many having progressive disease. Clinical descriptions ofHAM-TSP indicate that this entity can mimic progressive MS, and occasional patients have brain-stem or optic nerve lesions.l\" Magnetic resonance imaging is also not invariably able to distinguish MS and HAM-TSP; lesions of the cerebral white matter have been detected in both conditions. The HTLV-I serology in the cerebrospinal fluid should distinguish the two entities, although claims have been made for serologically negative, polymerase chain reaction-positive cases in endemic areas.\" The issue of case selection, including clinical course, geographic and other epidemiologic considerations (transfusions, sexual contacts), neuroimaging, and blood and cerebrospinal fluid serologic analyses, should receive as much attention a~the laboratory technical details and indeed likely account for some of the previous controversies.",

            "text": "With regard to the laboratory technical details, \"false-positive\" results are again central to the question, \"Does HTLV-I cause MS?\" The HTLV-I transcriptional unit contains at least three functional genes-gag, pol, and. env-as well as genes that encode regulatory proteins. The genome is flanked by a long terminal repeat in the provirus, which is usually thought to act as a promoter-enhancer region. Several studies have concluded that, under high stringency conditions, with use of the polymerase chain reaction gene-amplification technique applied to lymphocyte-or central nervous system-derived DNA, one does not obtain hybridization signals that correspond to each of the functional HTLV-I genes or long terminal repeat regions, in contrast to data from HAM-TSP cases; thus, prototype HTLV-I is excluded as a consistent feature of MS. Technical laboratory causes of \"false-positive\" results derive in large measure from the highly sensitive nature of the polymerase chain reaction technique. Causes include contaniination of samples directly during extraction, plasmid contamination, or aerosol contamination. Among HTLV-I isolates from different HTLV-I-infected persons, .sequence differences are evident; concern about laboratory contamination is thus raised when identical gene sequences are amplified from blood samples from different patients, such as in the original six patients analyzed by Reddy and associates,\" all of whom had identical env-gene sequences. When other investigators studied these same donors that had been analyzed by Reddy and colleagues, negative results were reported.\" In several studies, including the current one that used nested primers, hybridization signals on a given sample are obtained with some but not all ofthe primers designed to amplify HTLV-I genes. These sporadic signals from control and disease donors suggest that the signals are not derived from HTLV-I and most likely represent endogenous retroviral sequences present in the human genome (see subsequent discussion). The studies of HTLV-I and MS illustrate, to the credit of those who have participated, how collective efforts and interchange can rapidly lead to important results, whether positive or negative.",

The human genome is host to thousands of copies of retroviral proviruses-some originating before the divergence of primates and some reflecting relatively recent integration. Most of the proviral-like sequences in the human genome are defective, lacking large regions necessary for viral replication. Many relatively complete genomes have undergone mutation by the acquisition of stop codons in open reading frames, precluding any expression of intact viral proteins. Putative retroviruses and reverse transcriptase activity, however, have been detected in serum samples from patients with breast cancer, in non-HTLV-I-or HTLV-II-related leukemias and lymphomas, and in normal human breast milk, placenta, and serum. These observations suggest that at least some endogenous retroviruses are still capable of coding full viral particles.",

Superantigens are molecules that, in conjunction with cell surface class II major histocompatibility complex molecules, are able by interaction with a variable domain of the~subunit of the T-cell receptor to activate an entire class of T cells that bear a specific allele (for example, V~14), independent of the antigen binding site. The functional consequences of such interactions depend on the location (periphery versus thymus) of the interaction and the developmental stage of the animal. Interaction in the thymus during development would result in depletion of T cells that bear specific T-cell receptor V-region encoded domains and thus shape the subsequent T-cell repertoire of the patient. Interaction outside the thymus (systemic or intrathecal compartments) could result in T-cell activation. In humans, various microbial superantigens (staphylococcal enterotoxin, Mycoplasma) can induce such responses.",

            "text": "Could endogenous retroviruses contribute to development of apparent autoimmune disease, including MS? It seems unlikely that intact retroviruses could be causing lysis or direct dysfunction of oligodendrocytes because such viral particles are not reproducibly found in the lesions of the central nervous system. Several possible models could be considered whereby endogenous viral proteins, particularly env glycoproteins, could underlie immune-mediated injury to the myelin of the central nervous system in the absence of complete viral particles. Because antigens expressed during development cause ablation or tolerance of T-cell clones directed against them, one might postulate that immunoreactive viral proteins would be expressed late, possibly because of alterations in cis elements (for example, aging-related loss of DNA methylation'\") or transacting factors (for example, up-regulation with steroid hormones in puberty). Env protein, or other viral proteins, could be expressed by oligodendrocytes and thereby trigger destruction by sensitized T cells. Common antigenicity between viral proteins, or posttranslational modifications ofthese proteins, and oligodendrocytes or their myelin membranes could produce immunologic cross-reactivitythat is, molecular mimicry. We have also proposed that antibodies directed against viral antigens that share immunoglobulin superfamily domains with human T cells could activate cells in the central nervous system by acting as a mitogen. 13 Low complement and ineffective reticuloendothelial function in the brain would favor a \"mitogenic\" over a lytic T-cell response, with demyelination occurring as a bystander effect. The presence of endogenous superantigens coded by endogenous retroviruses, as discussed in the foregoing material, suggests a further means whereby non-antigen receptormediated triggering of the T-cell receptor could activate cells in a \"mitogenic\" manner, with subsequent bystander demyelination.",
