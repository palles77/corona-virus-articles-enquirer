This approach is wrong-minded for several reasons. First, the microbiology laboratory may fail to identify a causative organism. 5 Second, the organism isolated by the laboratory may not represent the actual infective agent in vivo. The analogy is the role for Gram staining of secretions in chronically intubated patients to determine whether there is a neutrophilic exudate consistent with infection and whether there is a predominating organism-steps that can promote the choice of appropriate antibiotic therapy. 6 In this setting, undue emphasis on culture results can lead to a seemingly endless process of adding or eliminating antibiotics in patients who are merely colonized by bacteria and not actually infected. Treatment decisions that do not take into account the host response and dominating organisms will tend to favor the production of increasingly antibioticresistant isolates and may potentially compromise public health. This is only one of several compelling reasons to consider diagnostic biopsies in patients with infections in situations that do not readily yield to noninvasive approaches.",

There is some controversy among experts as to whether these stains are equally efficacious in the identification of certain organisms, such as Bartonella spp., but in general they yield comparable results. In theory, all eubacteria, including mycobacteria, will stain positively with silver impregnation. However, in our experience, they do not do so reliably, and this approach cannot be recommended as a screening tool. In general, bacteria are enhanced both colorimetrically and in size by the deposition of silver salts on their cell walls, making them easier to identify but at times causing confusion in interpretation. Background staining presents a problem in interpretation, but the morphologic regularity of eubacteria usually allows for accurate identification, once experience has been established with the technique.",

Because certain fungi demonstrated by GMS do not consistently stain well with periodic acid-Schiff (PAS), the latter should be reserved as a secondary approach, but it can at times enhance morphologic detail. Although the GMS is often counterstained with methyl green for contrast, other counterstains can be applied. It is possible, for example, to counterstain with H&E; this allows for a detailed assessment of the cellular immune response and promotes accurate identification of intravascular and perineural invasion by organisms. All gram-positive bacteria, including the actinomycetes, stain with GMS ( Fig. 2-14) , as do some encapsulated gramnegative bacteria, such as Klebsiella spp. Bacteria that have been treated before tissue sampling (e.g., infective endocarditis), may not be well decorated by the Gram stain, but they often retain their GMS positivity. For this reason, both stains should be examined before excluding a gram-positive bacterial infection. The actinomycetes, including mycobacteria, are gram-positive eubacteria and consequently also stain with GMS. The GMS is the stain of choice for demonstrating Pneumocystis jiroveci (Fig. 2-15) , and it highlights the trophozoites of Entamoeba A B modified stain for acid-fast bacteria (Fite-Faraco or Putt's) detects mycobacterial antigens that are sensitive to strong acid, a step in the decolorization of the ZN stain. For this reason, it can be used to screen for all mycobacteria and may be required to detect certain atypical mycobacteria, such as Mycobacterium leprae, as well as Nocardia, Rhodococcus, and Legionella micdadei. The cortical spines of Schistosoma spp. (Fig. 2-18) , the hooklets of Echinococcus, and the spores of Cryptosporidium also stain well, but variably, with modified acid-fast bacillus stains.",

Others are available reliably only at highly specialized centers such as the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. Development of new immunohistochemical techniques can be a worthwhile but labor-intensive task. Because there is wide cross-reactivity among fungal species and among bacteria, it is critical to establish the potential crossreactivity of any new antibody and its relative specificity. 14 Nevertheless, it may at times be possible to limit the use of a reagent to a narrow range of differential diagnostic possibilities Recently, a novel chemical variant of DNA called peptide nucleic acids (PNA), consisting of nucleoside bases joined by a peptide backbone rather than a sugar backbone, has been used to detect microbial genetic material. PNA probes offer the advantage of chemical stability and higher sensitivity and specificity. These properties offer the opportunity of developing probes that can differentiate species in situ. Such probes have proved successful in differentiating tuberculous from nontuberculous mycobacterial infections by targeting the 16S ribosomal RNA; others have detected Staphylococcus aureus, Enterococcus faecalis, and Candida species. [16] [17] [18] [19] Polymerase Chain Reaction PCR amplification to detect infectious agents in surgical pathology specimens is now so common that a basic description of the technique is unnecessary. 20,21 PCR is without a doubt the most sensitive detection method available, and because if can be performed on archived formalin-fixed, paraffin-embedded samples, important diagnoses can be rendered even if cultures were not obtained from tissue biopsies at the time of processing (e.g., lung wedge resections for tumor that later reveal necrotizing granulomas). Common applications of PCR to surgical samples are listed in Table 2-8. Central to PCR, however, is the requirement the exact RNA or DNA sequences to be amplified must be known. Abundant DNA sequences complementary to the target genetic elements and allow for specific localization of microbes in tissue or within cells. Depending on the sequence, some ISH probes can also bind specifically to nucleic acids from individual species, allowing for differentiation of organisms with variable virulence. Although there is great specificity with many ISH probes, immunohistochemistry is preferred, if possible, because of ease of incorporation into the modern automated pathology laboratory.",
