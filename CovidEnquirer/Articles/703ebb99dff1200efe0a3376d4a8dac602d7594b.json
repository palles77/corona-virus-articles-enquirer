Complex 1 is a discrete dinuclear complex while complexes 2-4 are polymeric of which 2 and 3 have paddle wheel repeating units. Magnetic susceptibility measurements from polycrystalline samples of 1-4 revealed strong antiferromagnetic interactions within the {Cu 2 } 4+ paddle wheel units and no discernible interactions between the units.

A number of N-oxide derivatives are known to show herbicidal activity [2] , inhibitory activity [3] such as against feline coronavirus and human SARS-CoV, as well as antibiotic properties, as for example 2n-heptyl-4-hydroxyquinoline N-oxide [4, 5] . This latter N-oxide is also known for mediating proton transfer across the mitochondrial membrane as well as for inhibiting electron transport across cell membranes in complex form [4, 6] . Moreover, researchers have reported several aromatic N-oxide derivatives capable of forming biologically active metal complexes [7, 8] . Apart from these, coordination complexes of aromatic N-oxides are known to have extensive applications as magnetic materials [7, [9] [10] [11] [12] , in catalysis [13] [14] [15] [16] [17] [18] [19] as well as in supramolecular systems [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] [29] [30] [31] .",

Thus, by use of bidentate spacer ligands to connect these paddle wheel units the distance of separation between the paddle wheel cores may be controlled. As shown in Scheme 2 such distance will be different for different ligands used (d1 > d2), which in turn may have significant effects on their magnetic exchange properties. However, in the case of 2,2 0 -bipyridyl-N,N 0 -dioxide there is other possibilities such as chelation, which need to be overcome so that polymeric structures are preferred. With the intention of studying magnetostructural correlations with some copper(II) complexes of such polymeric complexes we have synthesized a number of coordination complexes/polymers of copper(II) aromatic N-oxides having carboxylate as the anionic ligand and studied their magnetic properties as a function of temperature. We have studied complexes of N-oxide ligands such as pyridine N-oxide, 2,2 0 -bipyridyl-N,N 0 -dioxide, 4,4 0 -bipyridyl-N,N 0dioxide and nicotinic acid N-oxide to compare the structural as well as magnetic features of the different complexes formed.

The oxygen O7 from 4,4 0 -bipyridyl-N,N 0dioxide occupies the apical position with a Cu-O bond distance of 2.527 \u00c5.

These water molecules are strongly hydrogen bonded to each other form-ing net-like structures of hexameric aqua-units as shown in Fig. 5a .

Therefore, we conclude that such interactions, if indeed operative, must be very weak. This is in agreement with the fact that such interactions would have to be transmitted through a superexchange pathway involving the apical coordination position of the square-pyramidal copper(II) ions; since this position occupies a non-magnetic orbital (of d z 2 character), this interaction is expected to be very weak. Moreover, the size and shape of the bridging ligands is probably not favourable for the transmission of significant magnetic exchange.",

Depending on the aromatic N-oxide ligands different architectures of the coordination polymers with repeated mononuclear or dinuclear copper(II) units are observed. The paddle wheel structures of copper(II) separated by different N-oxide spacers controls their structural features. The nicotinic acid Noxide leads to dinuclear repeated units of copper(II) to form the 1D chains with relatively larger copper(II) inter-metal separations. Interactions within the paddlewheel moieties of 1-3 were found to be strongly antiferromagnetic, with values typical of copper(II) carboxylates. However, inter-dinuclear interactions between these moieties were too weak to be detected, or non-existent. In the case of 5, in which the coordination of the bridging ligand to the adjacent copper(II) ions is both axial and equatorial, the transmitted interaction is very weakly antiferromagnetic.",
