For this purpose, primer pairs were selected in the 5 0 untranslated region (5 0 UTR). The primers B E and B 2 were located in highly conserved regions and were pestivirus-specific. Two primer pairs named B 3 B 4 and B 5 B 6 were specific of BVDV genotypes I and II, respectively. With this technique, an amplification product of the expected size was obtained with either the B 3 B 4 or the B 5 B 6 primer pairs for the 107 BVDV isolates tested but not for BDV or CSFV. For some isolates that were grouped in the genotype II, sequence analysis of the PCR fragments confirmed their classification into this genotype. #",

Transplacental infection of the fetus with a noncytopathic BVDV strain during the first trimester of gestation may lead to persistently infected (p.i.), immunotolerant calves. When these animals are superinfected with an antigenically similar cytopathic strain they may suffer of the fatal mucosal disease (Brownlie, 1991) . Another fatal outcome of BVDV infection is associated with severe thrombocytopenia and hemorrhagic lesions. Several outbreaks of this syndrome have been reported, essentially in North America but Veterinary Microbiology 64 (1999) 155\u00b1167 cases have also been reported in Europe (Corapi et al., 1989; Broes et al., 1992; Pellerin et al., 1994) .",

BVDV can cross-infect cattle, sheep, goats and pigs (Carlsson, 1991; Paton et al., 1992) . BDV is an ovine pathogen that occasionally infects pigs (Roehe et al., 1992; Edwards et al., 1995; Vilcek and Belak, 1996) . Differentiation between CSFV and other pestiviruses can be accomplished by the use of CSFV-specific monoclonal antibodies (Mabs) but the search for ruminant pestivirus-specific Mabs has failed due to a great antigenic diversity (Edwards et al., 1991) .",

Primary infection of the CNS most likely occurs across the blood\u00b1brain barrier (Fernandez et al., 1989; Hewicker et al., 1990; Hewicker-Trautwein et al., 1992) .
