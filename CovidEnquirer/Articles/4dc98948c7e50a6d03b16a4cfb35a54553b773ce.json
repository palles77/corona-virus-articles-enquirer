The presence of the adamantane moiety played an important role in the eventual antiviral activity of the compound. This compound behaved as a typical non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase (RT) inhibitor (NNRTI) with non-competitive inhibition of RT with respect to the nucleotide substrate (K i \u00bc 12 mM; K i /K m \u00bc 5.5). Separation of the enantiomers via diastereoisomeric salts was performed for this thiazolidinone. X-ray studies enabled us to ascribe the R configuration to (\u00fe)-2-adamantan-1-yl-3-(4,6-dimethyl-pyridin-2-yl)-thiazolidin-4-one. Furthermore, it was found that the (\u00fe)-isomer shown in Fig. 1 , was predominantly responsible for the potent anti-HIV-1 activity (EC 50 value of 0.178 mM), while the levo isomer was more than 60-fold less active. These findings confirm the general rule, that only one defined NNRTI enantiomer inhibits RT while the other one is usually markedly less potent or even inactive [2, 3] .",

The structural difference between compounds 8e11 and compound 7 consists only in the replacement of a pyridin-2-yl by a pyrimidin-2-yl or pyrimidin-4-yl nucleus in 11, as the N-substituent. The thiazolidinone 8 (EC 50 \u00bc 0.67 mM), bearing a 4,6-dimethylpyrimidinyl group, is only wtwo times less potent than the parent reference compound 7. Its antiviral potency and selectivity was close to that of the clinically-used compound nevirapine. The replacement of the 4,6-dimethylpyrimidinyl by the 4-methylpyrimidynyl in 10 (EC 50 \u00bc 4.50 mM) results in a 6-fold reduction in antiviral potency. A similar tendency was observed in our previous work on thiazolidinones containing 4,6-dimethylpyridinyland 4-methylpyridinyl-rings. Thus, 4,6-dimethyl-substituents connected to a heterocycle seem to be crucial for the activity. It was also striking to notice that minor modifications such as the inclusion of a methyl and/or chloro group at the pyrimidine ring may have a dramatic effect on the eventual antiviral activity of compounds ( Table 2) .",

In contrast to 8e11, these compounds contain an adamantylmethylene instead of an adamantyl substituent connected to the heterocyclic ring at the 2-position. This little modification of structure invariably causes reduction of antiviral activity (EC 50 \u00bc 8.6e53 mM). For example, when a methylene bridge was inserted between the 1-adamantyl and the heterocyclic ring in 8 giving compound 12 (EC 50 \u00bc 8.60 mM), a 13-fold reduction of potency was observed. This tendency is also evident when comparing, for instance, 10 (EC 50 \u00bc 4.50 mM) and 17 or 18 (completely inactive), with their respective anti-HIV-1 agents reported previously [1] . These data point to crucial and rather fixed interaction points of adamantane and other parts of the inhibitory molecule with the HIV-1 RT enzyme, a property which is often observed for many other non-nucleoside reverse transcriptase inhibitors. It is interesting that compounds 8 and 12 having a pyrimidin-2-yl ring at the N-3 position showed activity against HIV-1 whereas 11 and 21 with a pyrimidin-4-yl substituent lost their antiviral properties. The third series of compounds (22e29) is structurally entirely new. These compounds showed good to modest anti-HIV-1 activity (EC 50 \u00bc 1.0e11 mM) but also pronounced cytostatic activity. For example 24, 26 and 29 showed EC 50 's of 1.0e2.0 mM, while the 50%-effective concentration for 23 and 28 were 7.8 and 11.0 mM, respectively. In this series the effect of the alkylene bridge length is not unambiguous, since the ethyl results in a more pronounced anti-HIV-1 activity than methyl in compounds 23 and 29 (compare with 22 and 28), whereas the presence of a methyl resulted in more active agents than ethyl in compounds 25 and 27 (compare with 24 and 26). It should also be noticed that these thiazolidinones exhibit a certain antiviral activity against HIV-2 (EC 50 \u00bc 6.5e 46 mM), but it is currently unclear whether this activity reflects a specific antiviral effect rather than (and most likely) a toxic effect of the compounds. It is indeed evident from the data in Table 2 that the antiviral activities against HIV-2 were at compound concentrations that are close to the cytostatic concentrations (CC 50 ) obtained in mock-infected cell cultures.",

From Fig. 5 one can see that the four molecules have distinct electro-negative regions (shown in red to yellow) and electro-positive ones (shown in blue to green). The molecules in the upper row of have on these sites nitrogen atoms and hence a more negative potential. One can also see that the thiazolidinone fragment of both molecules is more co-planar with the aromatic ring than it is for the upper-row molecules.

However, because of the similar activity to the previously studied molecule 7 [1] , it was essential to compare values such as the dipole moment and the electrostatic potential distribution for this molecule.

Compounds with the adamantyl group at the 3-position of the heterocyclic ring belong to the second subclass of NNRTIs. Compounds 7 and 8 bearing a 4,6-dimethylpyridinyl and 4,6-dimethylpyrimidinyl nucleus showed the highest anti-HIV activities (EC 50 \u00bc 0.35 and 0.67 mM, respectively). The X-ray measurements revealed that these agents exist in a ''butterfly conformation'' common for many NNRTIs. Quantum chemical calculations revealed also that the anti-HIV activity of the compounds strongly depends on their dipole moments.",
