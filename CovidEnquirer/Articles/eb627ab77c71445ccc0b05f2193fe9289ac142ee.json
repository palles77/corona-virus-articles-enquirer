            "text": "One of the important fields to apply computational tools for domain boundaries prediction is structural biology. They can be used to design protein constructs that must be expressed in a stable and functional form and must produce diffraction-quality crystals. However, prediction of protein domain boundaries on the basis of amino acid sequences is still very problematical. In present study the performance of several computational approaches are compared. It is observed that the statistical significance of most of the predictions is rather poor. Nevertheless, when the right number of domains is correctly predicted, domain boundaries are predicted within very few residues from their real location. It can be concluded that prediction methods cannot be used yet as routine tools in structural biology, though some of them are rather promising.",

While this is particularly important in structural genomics (SG), where the targets have, in general, not been deeply characterized with appropriate biochemical and biophysical tools, this can be important also for traditional hypothesis-driven structural biology projects, where a fine tuning of the construct that is inserted into the experimental pipeline -cloning, expression, purification, etc. -is often necessary in order to get suitable samples [44] .",

This is a periodical exercise, performed every two years since 1994. During CASP experiment a series of protein sequences, the 3D structure of which was determined experimentally though it was not yet published, are distributed to research groups that develop computational methods for predicting protein structural features. It is thus a blinded test, where several methods of \"in silico\" structural biology techniques can be compared to the reality and to each other. Nevertheless, in each CASP run, the number of targets is obviously quite limited and a prediction method that performs very well in CASP is not necessarily better than other techniques in the reality. It is necessary to make additional investigations focusing on the possibility to use these prediction methods for practical application in structural biology.",

For example, the reciprocal orientation of the domains can vary and depend on the presence of other molecules. Multi-domain proteins may also be little prone to refold if, by chance, they had been overexpressed in cells lacking proper chaperones. This does not mean that multi-domain proteins cannot be studied but it implies that some care must be paid in structural biology experiments and that longer time and larger funding can be expected to be necessary to solve multi-domain proteins. It is thus extremely important to be able to predict, on the basis of its amino acid sequence, if a protein contains one or more structural domains.",

Protein domain boundary predictions began to be included in the CASP initiative in 2004. The dissection of a protein into separate structural domains is in fact not trivial at all [46, 47] . It is related to the ill-definition of what a protein domain is. An amino acid segment can be in fact consid-ered to be a structural domain if i) it is a compact ensemble of atoms/residues; ii) it is an ensemble of atoms/residues that behaves as a rigid body, in the sense that it can move relative to other protein moieties without changing its shape; iii) it is a self-folding subunit; iv) it is a polypeptide segment well conserved during molecular evolution. Given the ambiguity in any quantitative definition, the real domain boundaries were defined according to the CASP7 organizers and assessors [47] . They found a reasonable consensus definition for each investigated protein, which seems to be well suitable for a structural biology analysis.",

In this manuscript, several tools, designed for predicting domain boundaries on the basis of the amino acid sequence, will be compared to the real domain architecture. The analysis of these data allows one to answer the following basic questions: i) Is it possible to predict, with the presently available bioinformatics tools, if a protein is made by a single domain or if it contains more than one domain? ii) What is the statistical significance of the available predictions? iii) How accurately can the domain boundaries be predicted in the cases where the presently available bioinformatics predictions work well?",

Table  1 shows the bioinformatics tools that are freely available and that were used in CASP7. Protein domain prediction methods can be classified into three main categories [42] : i) homology prediction; ii) domain recognition; iii) new domain prediction methods. The 14 prediction methods regarded in present study include all types of approaches. The homology prediction is presented by the chop [48, 49] methods that assign the query sequence to known PDB chains. Dsp [42] uses in addition more general properties of sequence conservation throughout the protein and it can be considered as lying between domain homology and new domain predictions. Domssea [42] belongs to the domain recognition approaches. It is based on the assumption that secondary structure is a more conserved feature of proteins with similar folds than sequence. Domssea aligns the secondary structure predicted for a query protein against a database of 3D domain structures and derives the domain boundaries from the known domain with the most similar secondary structure. Robetta [50] applies BLAST/PSI-BLAST for domain homology prediction and it uses FFAS03 and 3D-Jury to find remote homologues of known domain structure. Hhpred [51] is a server for remote homology detection and for structure prediction using pairwise comparison of profile hidden Markov models (HMMs). In the foldpro [52] method the structural relevance of the query-template pairs is extracted from global profile-profile alignments in combination with predicted secondary structure, relative solvent accessibility, contact map and beta-strand pairing using support vector machines. Distill [53] provides prediction of Contact Density defined as the Principal Eigenvector (PE) of a residue contact map. This information is an important intermediate step towards ab initio prediction of protein structure and is used to identify domains. Baker generates 3D protein models using the de novo prediction algorithm Rosetta and then assigns domain boundaries using Taylor's structure-based do- maopus http://sigler.bioch.bcm.tmc.edu/CASP7-DOM/ * metadp http://meta-dp.cse.buffalo.edu [54] main identification technique. Maopus performs a template screening with PSI-BLAST and FFAS03. The SKELEFOLD approach implemented in Maopus is a de novo folding algorithm that uses vector representations of secondary structural elements; domain boundaries are defined with three sequence-based filters. In the domfold method, the output from DomSSEA, DISOPRED and HHsearch is parsed to form a consensus. Metadp [54] and NNput are meta servers that comprise a number of domain prediction methods.",

In other words, a residue can be predicted to belong to a certain domain, to another domain, or to a linker segment.

For example, it is difficult to estimate the probability that a certain value of the index J was obtained by chance. From another point of view, if J CK > J DL , where J CK monitors the similarity between the classifications C and K and J DL difference between the classifications D and L, it is clear that C and K are more similar to each other than D and L. However, it is more difficult to estimate the statistical significance of the inequality J CK > J DL . In other words, it is more difficult to estimate the probability that C and K are really more similar to each other than D and L. This depends on the fact that the probability density functions of the indices J, R, and FM are unknown and must therefore be estimated numerically on the basis of adequate simulations. Therefore, we generated a series of simulated partitions, using a Metropolis-Monte Carlo approach, by mean of the following procedure. Each partition is characterized by a series of boundaries that separate a domain and a loop and that can be located also at the N-or at the C-terminus. Given a protein containing N residues, a boundary can be any integer k with 1 k N. A series of boundaries were generated iteratively. The first (k 0 ) was randomly selected in the range (1, N); the second (k 1 ) was randomly selected in the range (1, m 0 ), where m 0 = N -k 0 ; the third (k 2 ) was randomly selected in the range (1, m 1 ) where m 1 = m 0 -k 1 ; and so on, the i th boundary (k i ) was randomly selected in the range (1,m i-1 ), where m i-1 = m i-2 -k i-1 . Two constrains were imposed during the generation of random domain boundaries within a protein. We considered that a domain must contain more than 30 residues and a loop size must be smaller than 30 residues. 10,000 random partitions into domains were generated for proteins containing 75, 100, 125, ..., 550, 575, 600 residues. It was then possible to make 49,995,000 pairwise comparisons between two partitions and the 49,995,000 values of the coefficients J, R, and FM were retained in order to determine their distributions.",

On the contrary they are rather large (>0.6) for intermediate threshold values and the highest mcc (0.628) is observed with a threshold of 200 residues.

Table 3 shows the mcc values computed on the basis of the predictions deposited by the participants to the CASP7 experiment. The same classification in tp, fp, fn, and tn, which is described in the Methods section, was used. This means that if protein P contains more than a single domain and it was predicted to contain more than a single domain by using the prediction method M, this was considered a true positive (tp). On the contrary, if it was predicted to contain only one domain by the method M, the prediction was considered a false negative (fn), etc. The data of Table 3 clearly show that most of the prediction methods are less reliable than the predictions based on the very simple assumption that a small protein has a high probability to contain a single domain and that a large protein is likely to contain two or more domains. Actually, only four methods (baker, foldpro, maopus and robetta) can predict a multidomain protein better than the simple predictor (Matthews correlation coefficient larger than 0.628). What does this mean? Are these bioinformatics tools useless in structural biology? The answer is no. First, some of them seem to be rather accurate. Second, these computational techniques were not specifically trained to identify multi-domain proteins and it is thus not surprising that some of them are not suitable to discriminate mono-and multidomain proteins. However, it is reasonable to suppose that these bioinformatics tools are still immature and progress should be expected in the future. Table 4 shows the average values of the J, R, and FM indices computed by comparing predicted and real partitions [see equations (2)-(4)]. All the values tend to be large, quite close to their maximal value of 1. However, the probabilities (pJ, pR, and pFM) to observe by chance values higher than these are quite large, ranging from about 30% to about 70%. Baker, foldpro, maopus and robetta are better in predicting a partition that is closer to the real one, with J, R, and FM values that are larger and have a minor probability to be observed by chance. Not surprisingly, they are the same methods that work better to identify multi-domain proteins (see the mcc values of Table 3 ).",

It was found that most of the bioinformatics tools are able to determine if a protein is made by a single domain or if it contains more than one domain, despite a similar reliability is reached by considering only the sequence length, a much simpler strategy. Using a standard and well known statistical test, we showed that most of the predictions that can be done are not impressively better than pseudo-random predictions. It was also observed that although the reliability of the prediction methods seems to be insufficient to make them routine tools in experimental structural biology, their performance can be extremely good. When the domain is correctly identified, its boundaries are very close, within one or two residues, to the experimental ones. In conclusion, these bioinformatics applications are not yet sufficiently accurate to be used as routine tools in experimental structural biology. It is rather probable that the use of more than a single prediction method by a sort of consensus approach might improve the reliability of the predictions. Although these bioinformatics tools are still immature, progress can be expected in the future. This work was supported by the Austrian GEN-AU project BIN-II.
