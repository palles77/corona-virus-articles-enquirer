For example, Xiaochaihu Decoction, Dachaihu Decoction, Xiaoyao Pill, Chaihushugan Powder, Chaihuguizhi Decocton, and Buzhongyiqi Decoction are all famous prescriptions with certain therapeutic effects (Pan, 2006) . Recent studies have indicated that Bupleuri Radix has the bioactivities of antivirus, anti-ulcer, antitumor, immunoregulation, proliferation, antidepressive, and hepatoprotective effects (Cheng et al, 2006; Matsumoto et al, 2002; Su et al, 2002; Wang et al, 2009; Cho et al, 2010; Zhao et al, 2010; Guo et al, 2012; Liu et al, 2006) . In addition, the extract of Bupleuri Radix has a significant bioactivity of anti-influenza A H1N1 in vitro (Su et al, 2011) . However, there are also some potent toxicities in it, as a result, a great attention has been paid for the quality control in the good practice in traditional Chinese medicine (GP-TCM) research (Uzuner et al, 2012) . In this paper, the species of Bupleurum L. in phytochemical, pharmacological, and toxicological studies, and the quality control studies are reviewed.",

It was reported that saikosaponin-D potently suppressed the expression of T cells in mice and inhibited the propylene glycol monomethyl acetate and ionomycin-stimulated IL-2 production in T cells of mice (Leung et al, 2005) . The saikosaponin-D could inhibit the activation of T cell similar to saikosaponin-A, however, they were different in the inhibitory mechanisms. Hsu, Kuo, and Liu (2004) reported that the proapoptotic effect of saikosaponin-D had been discovered in two liver cancer cell lines, Hep G2 and 3B. It has been proved that saikosaponin-D could prevent the progression of the cell cycle at G 1 phase, and inhibit the cell survival signaling. Therefore saikosaponin-D decreased the cell proliferation and induced apoptosis. It could also inhibit the cell growth of human lung cancer cell line A549 by inducing apoptosis and blocking cell cycle progression in G 1 phase (Hsu et al, 2004) . These results may verify the antitumor activity of saikosaponin-D.",

For instance, the anti-oxidation of SPB 0 , a crude polysaccharide extracted by ultrasound-assisted method, is stronger than that of the crude polysaccharide extracted by hot water. SPB 0 may attribute to ultrasonic degradation which diminished the linear scale of the polysaccharide molecular and the polysaccharides of smaller molecular have a stronger free radical scavenging activity (Li et al, 2009a) .

In view of their efficient pharmacological activities, volatile oils have been the main ingredient in the injection and dripping pills with the species of Bupleuri L., which are commonly used in modern medicine. To make a better use of volatile oils, the extraction method for volatile oils has been optimized (Li et al, 2004) , and the fingerprint profile of volatile oil has been established Ni et al, 2009) .",

Rats could be decreased in weight after saikosaponins treatment in which abnormal liver function and hepatic damage occurred. These lesions gradually aggravated with dose increasing (Liu et al, 2012; Huang, Liu, and Sun, 2011) . It was also reported that the administration of saikosaponins for a long time or at a high dose may cause serious liver injury or even death in rats, and there are certain timeand dose-toxicity relationships in cumulative toxicity of saiko saponins to rats. Further-more, total saponins extract in the species of Bupleurum L. exhibited a potent acute toxicity on rats with a LD 50 value of 2255.6 mg/(kg\u00b7d). Saikosaponins could lead to some acute toxicity symptoms, such as negligent action, abdominal lying sleeping, rapid heart rate, shortness of breath, and so on (Huang and Sun, 2010) . It has been widely recognized that the hemolytic activity of saikosaponin-D is caused by its complex with cholesterol on erythrocyte membrane, leading to membrane disruption and cell lysis, which could be decreased by liposomes (Ding et al, 2005) .",

            "text": "A recent study (Sun and Yang, 2011a) showed that the volatile oils from B. chinense could induce the chronic hepatotoxicity and hepatotoxical injury in rats along with some abnormal changes in the activity of serum ALT, AST, and some other hepatic indexes. The dosage-time-toxicity relationship has been clarified. The volatile oils from B. chinense also possessed an acute toxicity to rats and mice, inducing restlessness, accelerated heart rate, abnormal walking, breathlessness, and consecutive convulsion, and the LD 50 values of the volatile oils were 2.081 and 3.118 mL/kg, respectively . The mechanism of the volatile oil for hepatotoxic injury was revealed that the volatile oils could suppress the respiratory control rate, phosphorus/ oxygen rate, respiratory oxygen uptake, contents of ATP, and activities of ATPases, while increase the activity of iNOS and the contents of TNF-\u03b1, IL-6, IL-10, and NO both in serum and liver could increase. As a result, they caused the hepatotoxicity in rats by inhibiting function of hepatic mitochondrion and influence the energy metabolism of the liver (Sun and Yang, 2011b; Yang and Sun, 2011) .",

Recently, many polyacetylenes have been isolated, and an HPLC-DAD-MS method has been developed for the qualitative and quantitative analysis of polyacetylenes in the species of Bupleurum L. It was revealed that polyacetylenes were only accumulated in the species above, so they were considered to be poisonous species (Huang et al, 2009; . The bioassay tests showed that (2Z,8E,10E)-14S-hydroxy-heptadecatriene-4,6-diyn-1-yl acetate and mTPA esters of bupleurotoxin were cytotoxic compounds with IC 50 values of 9.4 and 4.9 \u00b5mol/L, respectively, and they also possessed a cytotoxic activity against cancer cell lines (Huang et al, 2009 ).

HPLC was a commonly used analysis technique, by which Li et al (2005) analyzed 17 samples of different species of Bupleuri Radix from various habitats. With an optimized condition, saikosaponin-A and -D are converted into saikosaponin-B1 and -B2 completely and quantitatively before being analyzed by HPLC. This method could be used as a routine analytical one for the quantitative analysis of saikosaponin-A and -D in Bupleuri Radix, which are the detecting indexes in Pharmacopoeia of People's Republic of China 2010. High performance capillary zone electrophoresis (HPCE) is also a powerful technique to study the compounds in the complex extracts, and a fast HPCE method has been developed for the determination and separation of saikosaponin-A, -C, and -D in the extracts of B. chinense from different areas (Lin et al, 2005) . A rapid resolution liquid chromatography coupled with evaporative light scattering detection method (RRLC-ELSD), demonstrated to be highly effective for the quality evaluation of the species in Bupleurum L., has been developed for the simultaneous determination of six major saikosaponins (Huang et al, 2009 ). LC-MS allows a comprehensive analysis of the saikosaponins in the species of Bupleurum L. and will be helpful for the quality control of the crude materials and their related formulations (Huang et al, 2008) . Combined with accelerated solvent extraction, a rapid-resolution LC-MS method for the efficient extraction, rapid separation, online identification, and accurate determination of the saikosaponins has been developed because it was rapid, efficient, accurate, and suitable for the quality control of Bupleuri Radix . Saikosaponins were also regarded as the target markers of some traditional medicinal formulations containing Bupleuri Radix, the analysis of saikosaponin-A and -C could be obtained readily by the use of LC/ESI/ion trap tandem mass spectrometry (Liau et al, 2007) . Immunoassay has been used in the semiquantitative analysis of saikosaponins. The Eastern blotting technique for the analysis of saikosaponins has been reported to be a simple method for the quality control of Bupleuri Radix and some formulas with it (Zhu et al, 2007) .",
