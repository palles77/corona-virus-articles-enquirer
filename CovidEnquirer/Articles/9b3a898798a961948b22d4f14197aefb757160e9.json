Intracerebral infection of C57BL/1 OSNJ mice with Theiler's virus results in acute encephalitis with subsequent virus clearance and absence of spinal cord demyelination . In contrast, infection of SJL/J mice results in acute encephalitis, virus persistence, and immune-mediated demyelination . These experiments examined the role of T-cell subsets in the in vivo immune response to Theiler's virus in resistant C57BL/10SNJ mice . Depletion of T-cell subsets with monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed at CD3 (pan-T-cell marker), CD4' (class 11-restricted) or CD8' (class I-restricted) T cells resulted in increased frequency of paralysis and death as a result of acute encephalitis . Neuropathologic studies 10 days after infection demonstrated prominent necrosis, primarily in the pyramidal layer of hippocampus and in the thalamus of mice depleted of T-cell subsets . In immunosuppressed and infected C57BL/10SNJ mice, analysis of spinal cord sections 35 days after infection demonstrated small demyelinated lesions relatively devoid of inflammatory cells even though virus antigen could be detected by immunocytochemistry . Both CD4' and CD8' T cells are important in the resistance to infection with Theiler's virus in C57BL/1 OSNJ mice . However, subsequent spinal cord demyelination, to the extent observed in susceptible mice, depends on the presence of virus antigen persistence and a competent cellular immune response .",

In C57BL/1 OSNJ mice, lack of pathologic abnormalities strongly correlates with efficient virus clearance . 14 To determine if depletion of T-cell subsets would predispose to virus antigen persistence on day 35 after infection, serial spinal cord sections from mice previously perfused with Trump's fixative were stained for virus antigen . Spinal cord sections from virusinfected mice treated with control NrIgG did not have virus-antigen-positive cells . In contrast, all mice studied that were treated with anti-CD3, anti-CD8, or anti-CD4 mAbs showed virus-antigen-positive cells in the spinal cord white matter (Fig .  4) . Many of the virus-antigen-positive cells were associated with small areas of demyelination and with a modest cellular infiltrate consisting primarily of macrophages . Our results are also consistent with the observation made by others\" -\" after infection of BALB/c mice homozygous with respect to the nude gene (nu/nu) . BALB/c mice are similar to C57BL/10SNJ mice in that they are resistant to TMEV-induced demyelination . However, when BALB/c (nu/nu) mice, which have a T-lymphocyte immunodeficiency, were injected with TMEV, they developed paralysis, and death was associated with small focal areas of demyelination in the spinal cord, indicating that TMEV is lytic to oligodendrocytes without the contribution of the T-lymphocyte immune system . In contrast, none of the normal BALB/c mice became clinically ill or died . Immunoperoxidase studies demonstrated that infected BALB/c (nu/nu) mice exhibited heavy virus-antigen load in the anterior horn cells of the spinal cord and occasional oligodendrocytes expressed virus antigen in the spinal cord white matter .\" Our results using T-cell depleted mice and those of others using BALB/c (nu/nu) mice support the hypothesis that the inability to clear virus infection from brain and spinal cord gray matter is a result of a deficit in T-cell function . However, more recent data suggested that antibody may also play a role in decreasing the level of infectious virus from the CNS because treatment of infected BALB/c (nu/nu) mice with a mAb to viral protein VP-1 resulted in a decrease in the number of demyelinated lesions and in the augmentation of CNS remyelination . 25 The observation that T cells play a role in resistance to TMEV infection provides an interesting paradox because T cells have also been considered to be important in the production of immune-mediated demyelination in immunocompetent SJL/J mice . Experiments using a series of therapeutic strategies including cyclophosphamide, 26 anti-lymphocyte serum, 27 cyclosporine ' 28 mAbs to immune response gene prod ucts, 2s,3o or mAbs to CD4 +1931 or CD8' T cells19 indicated that immunosuppression decreases the number and extent of demyelinating lesions in SJL/J mice . In contrast, depletion of immunoglobulin or complement results in augmentation of disease, indicating that in this case antibodies may be protective . 32 More recent experiments from our laboratory indicate that in vivo treatment with tumour necrosis factor alpha results in a marked reduction of demyelinated lesions in susceptible SJL/J mice .\"",

Because of a deficit in NK function 16 or antigen presentation, susceptible SJL/J mice are unable to clear virus . This allows for subsequent infection of oligodendrocytes, astrocytes, and macrophages in the spinal cord white matter that may be lysed during chronic infection by previously primed cytotoxic T lymphocytes directed against virus antigens or virus-induced host antigens . The persistence of TM EV in the presence of antiviral cytotoxic T lymphocytes may be the result of virus mutants that arise during infection that can evade antiviral cytotoxic lymphocytes .",

Numerous virus antigen-positive glial cells (arrows) were detected in spinal cord white matter in mice depleted of T cells (B, C and D) but none were detected in non-immunosuppressed C57BL/10SNJ TMEV-infected mice . (Immunoperoxidase staining using rabbit anti -TMEV polyclonal antisera on frozen sections counterstained with haematoxylin to detect demyelination and inflammation ; x870 .demonstrated that both CD4' and CD8' T cells play a role in the resistance to Theiler's virus-induced infection . Depletion of CD4 + or CD8 + T cells in infected C57BL/10SNJ mice resulted in increased frequency of paralysis and early death secondary to neuropathologic injury to the pyramidal neurons of the hippocampus, thalamus, and anterior horn cells of the spinal cord gray matter . CD4 + and CD8 + T cells appear to work in a synergistic fashion because depletion or inhibition of both the subsets by treatment with anti-CD3 mAb or by combined treatment with anti-CD4 and anti-CD8 mAbs resulted in augmented neurovirulence of the virus with subsequent paralysis of mice and death . Depletion of either T-cell subset resulted in virus antigen persistence in the spinal cord, indicating that both CD4 + and CD8 + T cells are required for the clearance of virus from the CNS . These results are similar to those reported by Williamson and Stohlman 21 for the mouse hepatitis virus model system . Infection with this coronavirus also induces demyelination in the spinal cord . These authors concluded that clearance of mouse hepatitis virus is mediated by virusspecific CD8+ T cells with the help of CD4' T cells . In vitro experiments from our laboratory indicate the presence of TMEV-specific CD8' cytotoxic T cells within the inflammatory cells infiltrating the CNS .22 This supports the hypothesis that these cells along with CD4' T cells play a role in limiting virus infection in vivo .",
