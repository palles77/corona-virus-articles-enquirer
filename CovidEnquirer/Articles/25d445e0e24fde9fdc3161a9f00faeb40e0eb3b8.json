Silver nanoparticle (Ag nano ) coatings on filtration membranes can prevent bacterial adhesion and the initiation of biofilm formation. In this study, Ag nano are immobilized via direct reduction on porous zirconia capillary membranes to generate a nanocomposite material combining the advantages of ceramics being chemically, thermally and mechanically stable with nanosilver, an efficient broadband bactericide for water decontamination. The filtration of bacterial suspensions of the fecal contaminant Escherichia coli reveals highly efficient bacterial retention capacities of the capillaries of 8 log reduction values, fulfilling the requirements on safe drinking water according to the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency. Maximum bacterial loading capacities of the capillary membranes are determined to be 3 \u00d7 10 9 bacterial cells/750 mm 2 capillary surface until back flushing is recommendable. The immobilized Ag nano remain accessible and exhibit strong bactericidal properties by killing retained bacteria up to maximum bacterial loads of 6 \u00d7 10 8 bacterial cells/750 mm 2 capillary surface and the regenerated membranes regain filtration efficiencies of 95-100%. Silver release is moderate as only 0.8% of the initial silver loading is leached during a three-day filtration experiment leading to average silver contaminant levels of 100 \u03bcg/L.",

Today, more than 250 serotypes of E. coli are known ranging from harmless gut commensals to severe pathogens [1] , such as the virulent enterotoxigenic (ETEC), enteropathogenic (EPEC), and enterohemorrhagic (EHEC) E. coli. Furthermore, viral infections can be spread via drinking water contaminations and highly infectious diseases are for example hepatitis A, poliomyelitis caused by the poliovirus or the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) which is caused by the coronavirus.",

In contrast to polymeric filter materials, ceramics feature outstanding positive properties because they are usually bio-inert, do not undergo swelling, are chemically and thermally stable, and withstand high mechanical stress enabling the cleaning and reuse of the filter after heat or acid/base treatment for decontamination [10, 11] . These excellent properties result in an increased membrane service life compensating the higher costs of ceramics in comparison to polymeric materials.",

These clustered bacterial communities are attached to the membrane surface and protect themselves against environmental influences. Bacteria produce extracellular polymeric substances (EPS) to form complex macroscopic structures that increase their resistance against e.g. toxic chemicals and antimicrobial agents. The removal of biofilms from the membrane surface is challenging and results in both cost-and time-intensive membrane regeneration procedures. Therefore, the reduction of the initial physical attraction of bacteria to the membrane surface, which can be attributed to a reversible attachment [1] , plays a key role in inhibiting the formation of biofilms and several antibacterial surfaces have already been proposed [12, 13] . Especially, immobilized nanosilver can act as an efficient antibacterial agent by killing retained bacteria directly on the membrane surface.",

The possible penetration of Ag nano into the pores of the membrane material was therefore not considered. With regard to this, we additionally determined the total silver loadings of capillaries treated with 5 mM AgNO 3 by AAS. Using this method, an acidic digestion ensured the total release of silver from the capillaries. With regard to the surface of the pores, the measured amounts of total silver loadings were correlated to the specific surface area of Ag nano -capillaries of 7.05 m 2 /g (Supplemental information, Table S2 ). The obtained AAS results were comparable to the results derived from counting: total Ag nano loadings increased with the number of immersions featuring 0.048 \u00b1 0.001 ng silver/mm 2 specific surface area for 1 immersion, 0.123 \u00b1 0.004 ng silver/mm 2 of capillary specific surface area for 3 immersions and 0.176 \u00b1 0.040 ng silver/mm 2 of capillary specific surface area for 5 immersions (Fig. 4A) . It is noticeable that the calculated amount of bioactive silver based on pixel-generated data of 20 ng per 1 mm 2 geometric surface area was significantly higher than the total amount of silver of 0.18 ng per 1 mm 2 specific surface area that was measured via AAS. The discrepancy of the results can be explained by the different reference membrane areas that were applied. Results from the counting method must be referred to the geometric surface area, since only Ag nano on the outer membrane of the capillaries were considered for the counting. Fig. 4B and C clearly display that Ag nano penetrated to a large extent into the pores of the capillary membrane. For that reason, for the determination of total silver loadings via AAS, the specific surface area determined via nitrogen-adsorption was considered as a reference leading to significantly lower values. Simultaneously, the deep penetration of Ag nano into the pores displays an advantage by enhancing the accessible interaction surface of bactericidal Ag nano and filtrated bacteria.",

Therefore, samples from the filtrated permeates of three individual capillaries were removed after 30 min, 60 min and 120 min of filtration on three consecutive days and analyzed by AAS. AAS measurements revealed that the silver release was highest at the beginning of the filtration on each individual day. After the first burst release after 30 min of filtration on the first day where 400 \u00b1 3 \u03bcg/L of silver was released, silver leaching progressively decreased reaching values of 34 \u00b1 0 \u03bcg/L already after 60 min of filtration and only 21 \u00b1 17 \u03bcg/L at the last measurement after 420 min of filtration (Fig. 7) . Among the filtration cycles, capillaries were stored under humid conditions at 4\u00b0C overnight until filtration was started again. The storage induced a continuous release of silver from the capillary, which was then released at the following filtration cycles, which explains the recurring increases of silver release in the beginning of each filtration cycle. High standard deviations result from the phenomenon that small pieces of the capillaries got lost and were measured in the permeate samples. The maximum contaminant level for silver in drinking water is 50 \u03bcg/L as set by the World Health Organization (WHO), whereas \"under special situations where silver salts are used to maintain the bacteriological quality of drinking-water higher levels of up to 100 \u03bcg/L can be tolerated without risk to health\" [44] . Although silver was continuously released during filtration, WHO requirements were fulfilled already after 1 h of filtration when silver contaminant levels of 34 \u00b1 0 \u03bcg/L were reached.",

In contrast, after permeating with water for 5 days, a significant higher and faster loss of silver was determined and no antibacterial effect was measurable anymore. Other studies also reported rapid depletions of silver from membrane surfaces after relatively short filtration periods (0.4 L/cm 2 ) and the soon loss of antibacterial and antiviral activities [6] .
