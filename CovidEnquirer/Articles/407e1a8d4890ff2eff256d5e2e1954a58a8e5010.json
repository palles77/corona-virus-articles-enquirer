The two sites considered most likely are tissue intcrspaces (extracellular space) and the axoplasm. Centripetal flow of certain components within the axoplasm has been described and can be of the same order of speed as movement of virus (Lubinska, 1964) . The active contractions of myelin recently described (Singer and Bryant, 1969) suggest oiie possible mechanism for such movement. The clearcut replication of virus within the perikaryon of sensory ganglion cells without demonstrable involvement of supporting elements (Johnson, 1965a; Yamamoto et al., 1965; ElDadah and Nathanson, 1967) is also consistent with axoplasmic spread. On the other hand, Baer et al. (1965) , in a series of carefully executed experiments, concluded that the sciatic nerve could conduct rabies virus centripetally, following footpad inoculation, even though the axons had degenerated due to a prior nerve crush a t the level of the sciatic notch (however, see Nathanson and Bodian, 1961a) . Final resolution awaits further experimental evidence.",

Spread of T'i~rtrs Within the CAYS The initial distribution of virus within the CNS following extraneural infection differs markedly from the distribution of virus which follows intracerebral inoculation. Minis (1960a) has shown that, in mice, an intracerebral inoculum is forcibly dispersed through the ventricular system and the subarachnoid space (as well as into the blood, Cairns, 1950) at the time of inoculation. Virus inoculated in this manner may invade the parenchyma both from the site of inoculation and through the ependymal and meningeal surfaces, particularly if it is capable of replicating in these superficial tissues (Mims, 1960b) . In contrast, following extraneural infection, virus usually invades the CNS through (or across) the vascular wall, probably simultaneously at many sites. For viruses which can be identified replicating in endothelium, this widespread vascular distribution within the CNS can be observed directly .",

Virus-cell interactions of this type may be relevant to the pathogenesis of certain infections of the CNS in which demyelination is prominent (see discussion beb. Central Nervous System.

A classical example is Bodian's studies of the sequence of changes which poliovirus produces in the anterior horn cell of the spinal cord (Bodian, 1948 (Bodian, ,1959 (Bodian, ,1964 ; principal stages are central chromatolysis followed by diffuse chromatolysis, nuclear changes culminating in pyknosis, and cytolysis followed by neuronophagia.",

The disease is characterized by an acute loss of neurons and other cells, producing severe atrophy with ventricular dilatation and large subcortical cysts; the architecture of the residual grey and white matter is loose and spongy, and diffuse round cell infiltrates and endothelial changes are present (Young and Cordy, 1964) . The reports of Richards and Cordy (1967) and Svehag (1962) suggest that the overwhelming panencephalitis produced by blue tongue virus in fetal lamb or suckling mouse is similar to the lethal panencephalitis produced in suckling mice by many other viruses (for example, arboviruses, ElDadah and Nathanson, 1967; vesicular stomatitis virus, Bruno-Lob0 et al., 1968 ; herpes virus, Johnson, 1964a) .

Most of the remaining animals underwent a mild or subclinical immunizing infection, with a detectable antibody response by 3 weeks; in these animals there was little or no infection of the CNS. A small number of dogs (2 of 55) also experienced an apparently silent immunizing infection; however, 40 to 60 days after infection they developed convulsions, with a panencephalitis, including demyelination as well as neuronal destruction and inflammation; a t this time viral antigen was present in Purkinje cells and other neurons (but absent from most extraneural tissues) ; antibody titers were high in CSF as well as serum. The pathogenesis of distemper demyelination poses a number of challenging questions, including the hypothesized role of an immunopathological process (Choppin, 1968) ; the persistence of virus in spite of an active immune response; and the possible direct attack of virus on either oligodendroglia (Moulton, 1956) or on the myelin sheath itself (Gorham, 1960) .",

Polymorphonuclear cells are usually most common in the first few days of the inflammatory response, and even then may be infrequent, while mononuclear cells may persist for months, particularly around blood vessels. Inflammatory cells typically assume several characteristic configurations : as perivascular cuffs, particularly around small vessels; as focal accumulations often at sites of neuronophagia; and as scattered cells distributed diffusely throughout the affected tissue.

The inflammatory response to neuronal destruction due to toxins or anoxia is consistent with this view (Innes and Saunders, 1962) . However, in local areas of the infected CNS there may be a marked discrepancy between cellular infection or cellular destruction and inflammation (Bodian, 1959; ; likewise, inflammation may be seen in white matter distant from any apparent neuronal outfall (Nathanson et al., 1965) .",

Experience has shown that attenuation for a given animal host is best achieved by passage in a different animal host or in tissue culture. Furthermore, passage leading to reduced virulence is often an irregular phenomenon, occurring in only a few of several parallel passage lines originating from a single virus stock (Thind and Price, 1966) .",

In contrast, the parent M3 strain produced a marked viremia, invaded the CNS early, and regularly replicated to high titer, with consequent fatal encephalitis. Cole and Wisseman (1969a) compared several passage levels of dengue-1 virus, following intracerebral inoculation of adult mice. The MP-3 strain (3 mouse passages) replicated slowly and then disappeared, often without producing clinical symptoms. The MP-125 strain replicated rapidly, to high titer, and regularly killed adult mice. Thus virulence may be associated both with greater neuro-invasiveness and with enhanced replication in the CNS. At present, little is known of the mechanisms which underlie such variations.",

However, spider monkeys (genus Ateles) show a nonimmune resistance to types 2 and 3 (but not type 1) human polioviruses, even following intracerebral inoculation of highly virulent strains (Jungeblut and Bautista, 1956; Nathanson et al., unpublished, 1969) . In contrast, rabies virus, if inoculated intracerebrally, has high virulence for most mammalian species regardless of age (Johnson, 1959) . Human enteroviruses show marked differences in their ability to infect mice: polioviruses usually fail to infect, group A coxsackie viruses produce a fatal poliomyelitis and severe myositis, and group B coxsackie viruses attack brain and brown fat.

Such carrier animals can transmit infection vertically, initiating persistent infections in their offspring (Pollard et al., 1968a) . In addition, they continually excrete virus in urine, resulting in occasional infection of other animals, including man (Farmer and Janeway, 1942) . By conventional techinques it is difficult to demonstrate antibody in the scrum; this type of infection was therefore termed persistent tolerant infection or PTI (Hotchin, 1962; Volkert and Larsen, 1965a) . More recently, it has been shown that antibody is formed in this condition (Oldstone and Dixon, 1969; Benson and Hotchin, 1969) .

Different strains of virus vary in their virulence ; virulence is influenced by passage history (intracerebral-brain or intraperitoneal-visceral) . An \"aggressive\" brain-passaged virus is more apt to kill acutely, while a \"docile\" visceral-passaged virus is more likely to produce persistent infection (Hotchin et al., 1962; Hotchin, 1965) . Host species is of importance, since persistent infections with antigen excess have not been reported in animals other than mice (Volkert and Larsen, 1965b) , although choriomeningitis is readily produced in a variety of species (Findlay and Stern, 1936; Armstrong, 1942) . More recently, it has been shown that there are marked differences between strains of mice, with respect to the titers which the virus reaches following neonatal infection. This, in turn, may play a critical role in the outcome of infection (Oldstone and Dixon, 1968, 1969 ). As noted above, age of host and route of virus injection are also critical determinants. Following intraperitoneal inoculation of adult mice, there is a variable mortality, depending upon strain of virus. Virus replicates in the brains of both fatally affected and surviving animals; however in survivors the titers are relatively lower and choriomeningitis, if present, is mild (Rowe, 1954; Lehmann-Grube, 1964) .",

Infected cells in culture can remain viable while supporting virus replication over an extended period (Benson and Hotchin, 1960; Benda and Cinatl, 1962; Seamer, 1965; Lehmann-Grube, 1967) . The plasma membrane of such infected cells contains virus-specific antigenic determinants (Dalton et al., 1968 ) which can bind antiviral antibody, thereby activating complement with subsequent cellular injury (Oldstone and Dixon, 1970) . Cytopathology has also been observed in infected cultures to which have been added LCM immune lymphoid cells (Volkert and Lundstedt, 1968; Oldstone and Dixon, 1970) but, a t present, evidence for the viral immunospecificity of this event is lacking.",

Probably the most dramatic evidence that acute lymphocytic choriomeningitis is mediated by an immunopathological process comes from use of immunosuppression to manipulate the outcome of infection in adult mice. Originally Rowe (1954 Rowe ( , 1956 ) and subsequently Hotchin and Weigand (1961) showed that X-irradiation converted a potentially fatal intracerebral virus inoculation into a benign infection. Similar results have since been reported for immunosuppressive drugs (Haas and Stewart, 1956; Hotchin, 1962; Gilden et al., 1971) ; antilymphocyte serum (ALS, Lundstedt and Volkert, 1967; Gledhill, 1967; ; and thymectomy Levey et al., 1963; East et al., 1964) .",

Additional evidence that choriomeningitis may in part he antibody-mediated is the observation that a proportion of adult mice, when fully depeleted of the third component of complement with cobra venom, are protected against intracerebral inoculation of LCM virus (Oldstone, 1970) .

Johnson (1965a) studied the pathogenesis of the fixed CVS strain of rabies virus in mice. After subcutaneous inoculation, high titers of virus were present in the CNS on the third day and immunofluorescent antigen was seen on the fourth day; however, little or no evidence of neuronal cytopathology or inflammation was seen up to death of mice 8 to 12 days after infection. The lack of necrotic changes in neurons infected for 4 days or more suggested that, in this experimental model, the virus may not be cytopathic.",

A number of these viruses (including herpes simplex virus, varicella virus, B virus, and pseudorabies virus) are capable of producing severe encephalitis and have an unusual affinity for first-order sensory neurons. Infection may be localized to one or a few sensory ganglia together with the corresponding innervation area of skin or mucous membrane. Herpes viruses often can produce persistent latent infections and it is postulated that the cell bodies of first-order sensory neurons may serve as the site of persistence of herpes simplex virus (Paine, 1964; Kibrick and Gooding, 1965; Fenner, 1968 ) and of varicella virus (Weller, 1965 ; Hope-Simpson, 1965) . The limited data available suggest that a continued low level of infectious virus may be found during latency (Schmidt and Rasmussen, 1960; Kaufman et al., 1968 ). However, virus has not been isolated from trigeminal ganglia of patients with facial herl'es (Richter, 1944) .",

Hope-Simpson (1965 1 has postulated that a naturally occurring decline in antibody level may precede zoster, and it is possible that a diminished immune responsiveness due to disease (e.g., Hodgkin's disease, Sokal and Firat, 1965) or immunosuppressive therapy could be one of the precipitating causes. The activation of cytomegalovirus (Schneck, 1965; Craighead, 1969) and of herpes simplex virus (Montgomerie et al., 1969) which has been reported in immunosuppressed patients is consistent with this possibility.

More recently, it has become clear that, in some instances, the potentially lethal virus actually invades the CNS, where it undergoes a transient cycle of replication, reaches only low titer, and then disappears (Gleiser et al., 1962; Huang and Wong, 1963; Webb et al., 1968b; Thind and Price, 1969d; Doherty, 1969; Weiner et al., 1970) .

However, the same treatment failed to protect against the \"fixed\" MV strain, which spread to the CNS by the neural route. Conversely, sciatic nerve frceze protected against gastrocnemius inoculation of thc MV strain but not against the Mahoney strain (Nathanson and Bodian, 1961a) .

Exogenous factors (such as antibody, interferon, or immunologically competent cells), introduced into experimental animals, may produce unambiguous effects but do not necessarily prove that the factor under examination is singularly important in the outcome of unmanipulated infection.

Descriptive Sequential Observations. Classical descriptive studies of viral pathogenesis fall into this category. For instance, Bodian (1959) summarized the sequential evolution of poliovirus infection of primates, based upon data accumulated by many laboratories. Antibody appears between 5 and 10 days after infection, often coincident with the clearing of viremia, and about the time that spinal cord virus titers are increasing, that is, a few days prior to paralysis. Such observations may be misleading for several reasons. First, more sensitive methods of detection indicate that serum antibody can appear considerably earlier after exposure to poliovirus antigen (Svehag and Mandel, 1964) and the earliest antibody may be complexed by excess virus in the blood (Nathanson and Bodian, 1962; Melnick et al., 1966) . Furthermore, antibody in CNS or CSF may be more relevant than serum antibody (Morgan, 1949a,b) . I n any event, data of this type permit only weak inferences as to causal relationships.",

The M-1 strain killed newborn hamsters, while 8-day-old animals survived. Survival was associated with an earlier H I antibody response. The M-2 btrain, which had a much shorter incubation period, killed 8-day-old hamsters, and Overman and Kilham suggested that the M-2 strain was able to outrace the immune response. In additional studies with mice, Overman (1954a,b) showed that an inactivated niurnps vaccine elicited a more rapid HI antibody response in older mice ; furthermore the greatest change in responsiveness occurrcd between 7 and 10 days of age, which corrclatcd with the age of devclopment of host resistance. Morgan (1941) found that the response of mice to inactivated Eastern equine encephalomyelitis (EEE) virus vaccine, as measured by neutralizing antibody, increased considerably during the first 10 days of life; this was correlated with a marked reduction, during the first month of life, in the intraperitoneal LDSo of the virus. A similar explanation for agespecific resistance of mice to cowpox virus was advanced by Subrahmanyan (1968) . Schell (1960) studied the marked differences in susceptibility of mice of different strains to mousepox virus, and concluded that the relative resistance ofC57BL mice was correlated with their more effective immune response to this agent.",

Furthermore, doses of antibody, so low that no neutralizing activity can he measured in the serum of recipients, can protect (Bodian, 1952) . However, if administration is delayed until after infection, the effect is rapidly lost, depending upon the host-virus combination, and upon route of administration and dose of antibody (Murphy and Glasgow, 1968) .

However, large doses of immunosuppressive drugs do not always reduce the interferon response (Ho et al., 1967 ). e. Comment. The dramatic potentiation of many experimental virus infections by a variety of immunosuppressive techniques strongly suggests that the immune response, in some virus-host interactions, plays a key role in the outcome. I n our view, concomitant reduced interferon responsiveness, when it occurs, is not sufficient to account for this potentiation, in light of the elevated interferon levels which regularly accompany enhanced virus titers. At present it is impossible to determine whether the effects of immunosuppressants are due, in part, to damping of host defenses other than the immune response and interferon.",

The marked influence of age on susceptibility of rodents to infection with a wide variety of viruses capable of producing encephalitis has been described above. These observations provide an opportunity for assessment of the possible role of interferon in these age-specific changes in susceptibility. An early report by Heineberg et al. (19641, utilizing coxsackie virus B1, suggested that interferon production might be reduced in susceptible infant mice compared to resistant adults. However, subsequent studies with other models (Sindbis virus, Vilvek, 1964 ; lYc>t Nile virus, Subrahmanyan, 1968; dengue virus, Cole and Wisseman, 1969a) fail to suggest that interferon plays an important role in age-specific variation in host susceptibility. I n a preceding section the genetically determined difference in susceptibility of different strains to mice to intracerebral inoculation of group B arboviruses was described (Goodman and Koprowski, 1962) . Virus replicates in brains of resistant animals, but growth is slower from the outset, indicating some quantitative difference in virus-cell interaction. In vitro studies (Vainio, 1963) suggest that cell cultures reflect the susceptibility of the animals from which they are derived, since susceptible cultures yielded at least 100-fold as much virus as did resistant cultures. Cultures from resistant and susceptible animals show equal ability to produce interferon (Vainio et al., 1961) . More recently Hanson and associates (1969) have suggested that resistant cells arc more sensitive to interferon than are susceptible cells. Further exploration of this provocative finding is needed.",

Administration of pre-formed interferon to a passive recipient has repeatedly been shown t o protect against a subsequent virus challenge. Finter (1966) explored the effect of interferon against intraperitoneal challenge with a strain of Semliki Forest virus which produced a lethal infection in adult inice aftcr intraperitoneal inoculation. When a large dose of interferon was inoculatcd intrainuscularly 3.5 hours prior to challenge with 110 mouse intraperitoneal LD,,,, about 90% of animals survived. Interferon protection dropped rapidly with increasing virus dose; pretreatment with 2 large doses gave 80, 40, and 0% protection, respectively, against 80, 320, and 1280 LD,,, of virus. When givcn after virus, interferon was much less effective. Since interferon is rapidly removed from the circulation, the doses used by Finter produced negligible serum titers in recipients. Baron and co-workers (1966b) gave juvenile mice passive interferon intravenously, and then challenged with minimal doses (about 1-10 LDEO) of encephalomyocarditis (EMC) virus or vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) , by the intracerebral route. Pretreatment with large doses over the 24 hours prior to challenge protected mice completely against an EMC challenge which killed 40% of controls. A similar interferon regime reduced VSV mortality from 95 to 65%. I n evaluating these results, several comparisons should be borne in mind. The amounts of interferon used in passive experiments are undoubtedly less than those produced actively in response to viruses which are optimal interferon inducers (Baron et al., 1966a) . Passive protection with interferon given prior to virus challenge, when compared to that afforded by passively administered antibody, is impressive for intracerebral injection (Morgan, 1949133 , but not for extraneural routes of infection. In any event, studies of this type only indicate the potential role which interferon might play in the outcome of certain virus infections.",

Active induction of interferon with Newcastle disease virus (NDV) injected intravenously at various times from 24 to 4 hours prior to intraperitoneal challenge with 110 intraperitoneal LD50 of Semliki Forest virus, protected 30 to 100% of mice. Baron and associates (1966b) found that the protection afforded against intracerebral challenge with about 10 LDSo (95% lethal dose) of EMC virus depended on the time of induction, survival being greatest (60%) when NDV was administered 24 hours before virus challenge, On the other hand, interferon induction has had a variable effect on the outcome of certain experimental rabies infections. Thus, while high levels of circulating interferon did not protect against intramuscular challenge of adult mice with approximately 1 LD5,, of rabies virus (Soave, 1968; Finter, 1967b) , complete protection of rabbits was achieved by a single intravenous injection of the synthetic inducer polyinosinic-polycytidylic acid (Fenje and Postic, 1970) .",

This effect is associated with variations in viremia, which in turn reflect differences in the replication of virus in tissues that release virus into the circulation. Little attempt has been made to elucidate the underlying cellular mechanisms, with the exception of a study by Johnson (1964b) of herpes simplex virus. I n vitro, peritoneal macrophages from suckling and adult mice were equally susceptible to herpes infection, but infected macrophages from young animals were much more efficient as a source of infection for other cells in the culture. Age may also have a decisive effect in experimental models where neural spread, rather than viremia, is operative (e.g., Sabin and Olitsky, 1937a,b) .

Since the pioneering work of Holland (1961) and his associates on the mechanism of the resistance of nonprimate cells or animals to human polioviruses, a great deal of information on cellular receptor sites has accumulated. I n a series of studies Holland showed that while mouse cells cannot be infected with intact poliovirus, viral RNA alone, or viral RNA enclosed within the capsid of coxsackie virus B1, can enter and infect mouse cells (Holland, 1961; Cords and Holland, 1964) . Kunin (1962) found that loss of susceptibility of older mice to group B coxsackie viruses was correlated with age-specific reduction of receptor activity of brain homogenates. Originally it was thought that quantitative differences in attachment might account for more subtle effects, such as the virulence of different poliovirus strains; more recent work (Harter and Choppin, 1965) has failed to confirm earlier impressions.",

The effect of temperature on virus replication is an exception. Temperature can be studied both as a virus variable, by comparing mutants with different growth temperature optima (Fenner, 1968) , and as a host variable, by comparing replication of a single strain a t optimal and nonoptimal temperatures (Lwoff, 1969) . Furthermore, temperature characteristics tend to exert a strong influence on the outcome of infection; that is, thermoresistant mutants tend to be virulent; and elevation of body temperature tends to slow virus growth and favor host survival. Thus, Carmichael and associates (1969 ; have correlated the high susceptibility of young puppies to canine herpesvirus with their body temperature (about 36\u00b0C) which is lower than that of adult dogs (37\"-38\u00b0C) ; in tissue culture the virus grows optimally at 35\"-36\u00b0C. Lwoff (1959 Lwoff ( ,1961 Lwoff ( ,1969 has made an extensive study of the mechanism of temperature sensitivity, based on in vitro studies of the replication of poliovirus variants. At supraoptimal temperatures several events were defined (Lwoff, 1969) which contribute to the reduced accumulation of viral RNA: a ribonuclease is activated (perhaps released from lysosomes) which degrades viral RNA; and the activity of viral RNA replicase is markedly decreased.",

Thus, Ruiz-Gomez and Sosa-Martinez (1965) found that holding mice at 4\u00b0C enhanced their susceptibility to coxsackie virus B1, with concomitant increase in virus titers and decrease in interferon levels. On the other hand, the protection of hyperthermic mice from Sindbis or from dengue-1 virus infection (Kim et Cole and Wisseman, 1969b) was associated with decreased levels of both virus and interferon in the brain.",

Outcome is always determined by multiple virus and host variables, although single variables can be independently studied under experimentally controlled conditions in the laboratory. A body of evidence has evolved to indicate that, in many virus-host combinations, the immune response plays an important role in recovery from primary infections. Likewise, it is clear that an irnmunopathological process mediates the disease which follows certain CNS virus infections. Further refinement to produce virus-specific immunosuppression is required to strengthen the experimental evidence. Finally, in vitro correlates of delayed hypersensitivity are needed to delineate the relative roles of humoral and cellular aspects of the immune response in the outcome of virus infections of the central nervous system.",
