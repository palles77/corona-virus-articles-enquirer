Mutation from low pathogenic (LPAI) viruses, whose natural reservoir is wild waterbirds, to HPAI forms occurs in poultry, but only viruses of the H5 and H7 haemagglutinin types cause highly pathogenic disease. The increase in size of HPAI outbreaks in the past decade is due to the growth of the poultry industry, with over 16 billion chickens and 1 billion duck being reared worldwide in 2004. Kuiken identifi ed the unusual aspects of the current H5N1 outbreak as: direct transmission from birds to human beings and other mammals resulting in severe disease, systemic disease in human beings and other mammals, and free-living birds as a mode of virus spread, but without an evident link to to poultry.",

Thus migratory ducks maintain apathogenic infl uenza viruses that cannot infect chickens, but passage through geese, turkey, or quail leads to LPAI that can infect chickens and hence mutate to HPAI. Kida noted that the 1957 H2N2 and 1968 H3N2 pandemic viruses were reassortants between avian viruses and the preceding human strains. Thus, because avian viruses of any subtype can contribute genes for reassortants, none of the 15 haemagglutinin and nine neuraminidase subtypes-all of which occur in ducks-can be ruled out as potential candidates for future pandemics.",

Vaccine virus is grown in eggs, formaldehyde killed, and given by intramuscular injection. The process for producing seasonal infl uenza vaccines was used because of extensive experience with these vaccines and the likelihood of more rapid licensure. Among healthy volunteers given two doses of vaccine, there was an order of magnitude lower H5 antibody titre compared with seasonal fl u vaccine. Only those volunteers given the highest vaccine doses (45 \u03bcg and 90 \u03bcg-ie, three to six times seasonal vaccine doses) had substantial antibody titres. 1 Also describing the results of safety and immunogenicity trials with the Sanofi Pasteur H5N1 vaccine was Melanie Saville (Sanofi Pasteur, Lyon, France). The vaccine was given at one of three diff erent doses, and with or without alum adjuvant, to healthy adult volunteers in France. Vaccination produced no serious adverse event, but two doses of 30 \u00b5g plus alum adjuvant given 21 days apart were required to produce an antibody response in more than 60% of participants. 2 According to Martine Denis (GlaxoSmithKline [GSK] Biologicals, Rixensart, Belgium), the worldwide manufacturing capacity for infl uenza vaccine is only 300 million doses per year. However, reducing the amount of antigen in each dose would allow for more doses. GSK has been working on an adjuvant that boosts the immune response in combination with lower amounts of antigen. Clinical trials are ongoing with an inactivated subunit H5N1 vaccine that uses the GSK adjuvant. In animal studies, the adjuvant gives cross protection between vaccination with one viral strain and challenge with another, which implies that stockpiling of vaccine may be feasible even if we do not know in advance the pandemic strain of virus.",

However, targeted geographic prophylaxis with a neuraminidase inhibitor (eg, oseltamivir) might succeed in containing or delaying emergence of a pandemic. Hayden also concluded that concerns over development of resistance to neuraminidase inhibitors should not be a deterrent to stockpiling of these drugs. A multicentre randomised trial in southeast Asia will compare standard and higher dose oseltamivir in hospitalised patients with H5N1 disease or severe infl uenza. An injectable antiviral is needed to help control a future infl uenza outbreak, and Hayden noted that trials are in progress with injectable forms of zanamivir and the investigational neuraminidase inhibitor peramivir.",

Production capacity for oseltamivir will increase from 190 million courses in 2006 to 400 million courses in 2007. Roche will donate more than 5 million courses of oseltamivir to WHO as a global or regional stockpile. The company has received orders or letters of intent for national stockpiles from more than 65 countries. A national stockpile suffi cient to treat 20-25% of the population could prevent 67% of hospital admissions and reduce deaths by 53% in the event of a pandemic, 3 but Reddy noted that in past pandemics attack rates have reached 30-35%.",

Modelling has allowed the eff ectiveness of various pandemic control measures to be tested. For example, closing schools would slow the spread of disease, but must be done in the fi rst week or two of a national epidemic. Vaccinating 30-50% of the population-assuming an eff ective vaccine were available-could stop the spread of a national epidemic. However, closing borders would have to be 99% eff ective to have an impact on controlling a country epidemic. David Bell (Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, Atlanta, GA, USA) noted that during the severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) outbreak of 2003, among 35 million international travellers who were thermally scanned no SARS cases were detected; however, during an infl uenza pandemic, non-essential domestic travel to aff ected areas should be discouraged. Bell stated that forced isolation and quarantine are likely to be ineff ective, but ill patients should be encouraged to stay at home. Whereas there is not suffi cient evidence for recommendations on the use of masks by the public, hand hygiene lowers the rate of upper-respiratory-tract infections.",
