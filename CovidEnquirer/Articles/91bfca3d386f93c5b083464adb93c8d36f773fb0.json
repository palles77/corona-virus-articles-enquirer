Of all commonly circulating respiratory viruses, influenza leads in causing disability and death in hospitalized adults, whereas RSV, followed by HRV, leads in hospitalized infants and children (Gaunt et al., 2011) . Influenza, RSV, and HRV are the three leading causes of disease burden in the elderly, further underscoring the pathogenic importance of these viruses (Gaunt et al., 2011) .",

            "text": "Host immunity to many viruses, including those targeting the respiratory tract, can be initiated in mice by the RIG-I-like helicase receptors (RLR) melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5 (MDA5) and retinoic acid-inducible gene I (RIG-I). MDA5 and RIG-I, which are encoded by the IFIH1 and DDX58 genes, function as intracellular cytosolic sensors of double-stranded (ds)RNA viral replicative intermediates or byproducts. Both sensors send signals through the adaptor mitochondrial antiviral-signaling protein (MAVS, also known as IPS-1, Cardif, and VISA) to activate IFN production and IFN-regulated gene transcription. This can inhibit virus replication and modulate cellular immune responses. MDA5 has a major role in recognizing and limiting picornavirus replication in mice and in vitro in human cells (Gitlin et al., 2006; Kato et al., 2006; Wang et al., 2009 Wang et al., , 2010 Wang et al., , 2011 Slater et al., 2010; McCartney et al., 2011; Triantafilou et al., 2011; Jin et al., 2012) . Together with RIG-I, MDA5 can also recognize and limit replication of other positive sense single-stranded RNA viruses of the coronavirus, calicivirus, and flavivirus families (Loo et al., 2008; McCartney et al., 2008; Roth-Cross et al., 2008; Li et al., 2010; Z\u00fcst et al., 2011; Errett et al., 2013) , (ds)RNA viruses of the orthoreovirus family (Loo et al., 2008) , negative sense single-stranded (ss)RNA viruses of the paramyxovirus and orthomyxovirus families (Kato et al., 2006; Shingai et al., 2007; Gitlin et al., 2010; Ba\u00f1os-Lara et al., 2013; Grandvaux et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2014) , and even a DNA virus of the poxvirus family (Delaloye et al., 2009; Pichlmair et al., 2009) . However, those studies were conducted in vivo in MDA5-deficient mice and in vitro using mouse and human cells. In contrast, the role of MDA5 deficiency in the course of natural infections in humans is not yet known.",

At birth, she had a suspected congenital infection, although prenatal infectious screening was normal. At 40 d of age, she had respiratory failure from concurrent HRV/ enterovirus and influenza B virus infections, which required mechanical ventilation, including extracorporeal membrane oxygenation. Since then, she has been repeatedly infected with HRV/enteroviruses detected in nasopharyngeal secre-tions and respiratory distress. She had two more episodes of influenza A (H3 subtype) and adenovirus, infections with three different coronaviruses (OC43, NL63, and HKU1), and one episode each of RSV and parainfluenza virus type 4. Tests for human metapneumovirus were negative. She continues to require supplemental oxygen and had ground glass opacities, but no bronchiectasis on chest-computed tomography. She has had bacterial superinfections of the respiratory tract, but no opportunistic or chronic systemic virus infection, including EBV or CMV. Although she initially had low serum immunoglobulin levels and lymphopenia (effecting T, NK, and B cell subsets) , these all normalized between 3 and 4 yr of age. Replacement immunoglobulin therapy, which started at 70 d of age when she was severely ill, was discontinued, and she has since responded with functional antibodies to tetanus, diphtheria, and Haemophilus influenzae vaccines. An older brother died of an unknown infectious cause at age one month in a refugee camp. The patient's parents and two other older siblings were healthy.",

Analysis of PCR-amplified products from seven nasopharyngeal samples collected sequentially from the patient over a 2-yr window demonstrated shedding of HRV-A, but not -B or -C (Fig. 1 , B and C). Each sample contained only one HRV-A serotype from 96 clones sequenced, and no two samples (excepting \"b\" and \"c\" which were collected within five d of each other) contained the same serotype. Phylogenetic analysis did not reveal any clustering of the identified serotypes ( Fig. 1 C) . Thus, the frequent detection of HRV/enterovirus was not caused by defective clearance of individual serotypes, but rather resulted from frequent infection with unrelated HRV serotypes.",

Whole exome sequencing (WES) was performed on the patient and her healthy immediate relatives, which revealed 1.8% homozygosity in the patient, 2.7% in the mother, and 2.0% in the father. These values were within the upper range of eight previously sequenced exomes from nonconsanguineous individuals (unpublished data) and were consistent with the lack of known consanguinity in this family. When suitable filtering on the variants was performed, a single homozygous missense mutation in IFIH1 NM_022168.3: c.1093A>G, p.K365E was identified in the patient and confirmed by Sanger dideoxy sequencing (Fig. 2 B; and Tables S1 and S2). This variant (rs117608083) was extremely rare, with an average minor allele frequency (MAF) in the Exome Aggregation Consor-tium (ExAC) database of 0.06%, where it was found mainly in East and South Asian populations, although no homozygotes were observed. The patient's missense mutation occurred at a location that was conserved across species (PhastCons, 1) and under evolutionary constraint (GERP, 3.96). Substitution of glutamate for lysine resulted in loss of physicochemical conservation (Grantham score, 56) and was predicted to have deleterious effects on protein structure and function (Poly-Phen2, 0.998). The patient also carried 14 other homozygous missense mutations, 2 compound heterozygous missense mutations, and 3 de-novo missense mutations, but of these, the IFIH1 mutation was computationally predicted to be most deleterious (CADD score of 25, surpassing mutation significance cutoff threshold for IFIH1 of 19.3; Itan et al., 2016) , with its normal gene product being highly expressed in immune cells and lung (Table S2) . For these reasons, we focused our attention on this variant. Both parents and a brother were carriers of this mutation (Fig. 2 A) .",

We therefore overexpressed wild-type or mutant MDA5 to test whether they could drive expression of luciferase from several promoters. Cells transfected with wild-type MDA5 increased baseline IFNB1 promoter activity and further augmented IFNB1 promoter activity after stimulation with intracellular poly(I:C) (Fig. 3, A and B ). In con-trast, those cells transfected with the K365E mutant showed minimal activity above nontransfected cells, which did not increase upon stimulation. K365E also failed to drive luciferase activity from IFN-stimulated response element (ISRE)and NF-\u03baB-driven promoters (Fig. 3, C and D) . Notably, the fold induction of luciferase activity of the K365E mutation after poly(I:C) stimulation, relative to that at baseline, was larger than that of wild-type, suggesting that the defect of this mutant lies in MDA5 dimerization or oligomerization upon binding or detecting RNA, although we did not test this further. Co-transfections of the mutant with wild-type MDA5 showed no dominant-negative effect (Fig. 3 , E and F). Although biallelic loss-of-function mutations in IFIH1 have not been previously identified in humans, monoallelic gain-of-function mutations have been reported in humans with Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome (Oda et al., 2014; Rice et al., 2014; Rodero and Crow, 2016) , Singleton-Merton syndrome (Rutsch et al., 2015) , and systemic lupus erythemato- sus with IgA deficiency (Van Eyck et al., 2015) . Our patient had neurodevelopmental delay, but lacked the cerebral calcifications or white matter abnormalities characteristic of Aicardi-Gouti\u00e8res syndrome or congenital infection (unpublished data). Moreover, her K365E mutation did not increase luciferase activity, either at baseline or after stimulation, in contrast to the known gain-of-function MDA5 mutants R337G or R779H (Fig. 2 , A, C, and D; Rice et al., 2014) . Additionally, the patient's cells did not express a type I IFN transcriptional signature characteristic of gain-of-function IFIH1 mutations (unpublished data; Rice et al., 2013) . Thus, we conclude that the K365E missense mutation was loss-of-function.",

Alternatively, HRV, as a member of the picornavirus family characterized by a single positive sense strand RNA genome, would be more likely to have extended stretches of RNA double helices during the generation of viral replicative intermediates that might bind effectively to MDA5 (Palmenberg et al., 2009) . To test innate immune responses in respiratory epithelium, we infected a transformed respiratory epithelial cell line A549, in which genes of the RLR pathway were silenced by transient transfection of siRNA. Silencing of MDA5, RIG-I, or MAVS expression increased both HRV transcripts and production of infectious virus (Fig. 4, and Fig. S1, A and B) . The requirement for MDA5 or MAVS in optimal virus control occurred not only for HRV-B (Fig. 4 , A-F; and Fig. S1, A and B), but also for HRV-A in human primary fibroblasts (Fig. 4, G and H; and Fig. S1 C) . In A549 cells, HRV minimally induced low levels of IFN-regulated transcripts, which were decreased upon MDA5 silencing, consistent with further impairment in virus recognition and antiviral responses (Fig. 5, A and B ). Both IFN-\u03b2 (IFNB1) Equivalent lysates from \u223c30,000 cells were run across lanes. **, P < 0.01; ***, P < 0.001; ****, P < 0.0001, by one-way ANO VA. and IFN-\u03bb (IFNL3, IL-28) transcripts were decreased upon MDA5 or MAVS silencing in primary human fibroblasts infected with HRV ( Fig. 5 , C-E). Increased HRV replication was also observed in primary respiratory nasal epithelial cells from the patient as compared with healthy controls or her parents ( Fig. 6 A and Fig. S1 D) . Furthermore, increased HRV replication was observed in SV40-transformed fibroblasts in which CRI SPR/Cas9 genome editing had been used to generate single-cell clones either hemizygous for the patient's mutant IFIH1 allele or completely lacking both IFIH1 alleles (Fig. 6 B and Fig. S1 E) . Importantly, transduction with wild-type but not mutant K365E MDA5 in A549 cells improved control of HRV replication (Fig. 6 , C and D). Thus, these data supported a role for MDA5 in the control of HRV infection in humans and for the patient's recurrent HRV infections.",

            "text": "Although RIG-I is thought to function as the major sensor for the orthomyxoviruses and paramyxoviruses especially in mice, a few studies have suggested a role also for MDA5 in responding to influenza A/B viruses and RSV (Sir\u00e9n et al., 2006; Loo et al., 2008; Grandvaux et al., 2014; Kim et al., 2014; Benitez et al., 2015) . We investigated these possibilities, as the patient had been hospitalized for severe influenza (influenza B in 2011 and influenza A H3N2 in 2011 and 2014) virus was also unaltered in SV40-transformed fibroblasts in which CRI SPR/Cas9 genome editing had been used to generate single-cell clones either hemizygous for the patient's mutant IFIH1 allele or completely lacking both IFIH1 alleles, in contrast to the increased virus production in cells lacking STAT1 (Fig. 8 B and not depicted). The infected cells that were either hemizygous for the patient's mutant IFIH1 allele or completely lacking both IFIH1 alleles did not exhibit increased cytotoxicity or decreased IFN-\u03b2 production (Fig. 8, C and D) . Finally, using a recombinant RSV that expresses enhanced GFP as a marker of virus replication, we observed that silencing MDA5 did not increase RSV transcripts, although it did decrease IFN-regulated transcripts, especially at 6 h, which were more rapidly induced to higher levels than during HRV infection (Fig. 9 , A-D). Unlike HRV, RSV transcripts or infectivity and spread were not increased in primary respiratory nasal epithelial cells from the patient (Fig. 9 , E and F; and Fig. S1 H) . RSV replication was also unaltered in gene-edited fibroblasts either hemizygous for the patient's mutant IFIH1 allele or completely lacking both IFIH1 alleles (unpublished data). Together, these results show that under the same conditions where MDA5 deficiency results in increased HRV replication, influenza virus and RSV replication remain unaffected. Hence, MDA5 has a nonredundant role in innate and/or cell-intrinsic immunity against respiratory infections caused by HRV.",

            "text": "To explore further whether the IFIH1 variant found in our patient was disease-causing, we analyzed the mutation burden at this locus in the general population. The ExAC database contains 63 loss-of-function (nonsense, splice acceptor/donor, frameshift) and 392 nonsynonymous missense IFIH1 variants. Of the loss-of-function variants, five had MAF of 0.065% or higher, with homozygotes reported for most of these variants. Homozygotes for the three most frequent loss-of-function variants (rs35732034, rs35337543, and rs35744605) were observed at slightly higher than expected, frequencies in the Icelandic population (Sulem et al., 2015) . However, the earliest death of these homozygotes was recorded at 81 yr of age, and there were no childhood deaths from the offspring of heterozygous couples, which are predicted to be 25% homozygotes. No data were available regarding the early medical history of these homozygous individuals, including incidence of childhood HRV or other respiratory virus infections. Given these preexisting data, we determined whether nonsynonymous missense IFIH1 mutations that compromised function had similar population-level representations. Missense variants having MAF of 0.01% and higher were overexpressed and tested for ability to drive luciferase expression from an IFNB1 promoter after stimulation with intracellular poly(I:C), with loss-of-function (nonsense, splice acceptor/donor, frameshift) and two known gain-of-function variants included for comparison ( Fig. 10 and Table S3 ). Among the 38 missense variants we tested, all showed equivalent protein expression (unpublished data), whereas 11 exhibited >40% decreases in luciferase activity compared with wild-type MDA5, when stimulated by transfected poly(I:C). Although variants demonstrating more severely impaired luciferase activity tended to occur above the mutation significance cutoff, activity levels were generally not well correlated with CADD scores (Fig. 10 A; Itan et al., 2016) . The experimentally validated variants having decreased luciferase activity had MAF ranging from 0.01 to 1.1%, and were found in homozygote form in as many as 22 people ( Fig. 10 B and Table S3 ). Furthermore, the presence of complete loss-of-function homozygotes in the population was consistent with little purifying selection. This conclusion was also supported by the computed f-value, which estimates the proportion of nondeleterious nonsynonymous mutations remaining in the population and is inversely proportional to the level of purifying selection (Eilertson et al., 2012) . Specifically, the f-values for IFIH1 and the related RLR sensor DDX58 were higher than that for STAT1 (0.5968 and 0.4434, respectively vs. 0.1949), sug-gesting that the RLR sensors are individually nonessential for the control of most pathogenic viruses (Deschamps et al., 2016) . Thus, these data indicate that deleterious IFIH1 variants exist at rare frequency in the normal population. This implies that there are even rarer homozygous or compound heterozygous individuals, further supporting the role of MDA5 deficiency in our patient's HRV disease, which is a rare infectious phenotype. These data further suggest that other patients with severe HRV disease may carry bi-allelic deleterious variants in IFIH1.",

            "text": "Studies in single patients can establish causality between genotype and phenotype in humans, provided that the mutant genotype is only found in the affected patient, the specific variant impairs corresponding protein function, and cellular phenotype can be recapitulated or rescued at the molecular level (Casanova et al., 2014; Ciancanelli et al., 2015) . By these criteria, we have shown that human MDA5 protects against respiratory infections caused by HRV. HRV accounts for a substantial disease burden of acute lower respiratory infections requiring hospitalization, especially in infants and children where it surpasses that of influenza (Gaunt et al., 2011) . Additionally, HRV is primarily responsible for half of upper respiratory infections, but has not been adequately studied as it is often dismissed as innocuous (Heikkinen and J\u00e4rvinen, 2003; Global Burden of Disease Study 2013 Collaborators, 2015 . This has impeded clinical recognition of additional patients with genetic susceptibility to severe respiratory disease associated with the common cold. Whether MDA5 provides physiological protection against other respiratory viruses that we did not test such as human coronaviruses and adenovirus, or against systemic RNA viruses that our patient has not been exposed to such as poliovirus and Hepatitis A virus, is not yet known. Interestingly, our patient has not had hand-foot-mouth disease, nor has she had detectable nonrespiratory enteroviruses associated with acute viral gastroenteritis, possibly due to a differential dependence of MDA5 virus-sensing on the virus or cell type, as well as protective effects of intravenous immunoglobulin treatment that variably contains neutralizing antibodies to enteroviruses (Galama et al., 2000; Arora et al., 2011) . The type 1 diabetes mellitus that she developed at two yr of age might have been precipitated by persistent infection with pancreatropic enteroviruses which have been detected in pancreatic autopsy specimens from recent-onset disease (Ja\u00efdane et al., 2010; Rodriguez-Calvo and von Herrath, 2015) . Moreover, her intrauterine growth retardation was compatible with congenital infection by untested viruses that might be poorly controlled in multiple organ systems when MDA5 is lacking. Nonetheless, respiratory infections are the most frequent type of infection among the general population, and thus, exposure history most likely accounts for what seems at first glance to be a \"site-specific\" susceptibility.",

Importantly, by carrying out in vitro infection experiments in MDA5-silenced respiratory epithelial cells-and also in the patient's own MDA5-deficient nasal epithelial cells and gene-edited fibroblasts-we have established that the MDA5 genotype is responsible for the increased HRV replication and HRV clinical phenotype in our patient. In contrast, the lack of in vitro susceptibility to influenza virus or RSV in the same cell types suggests that the MDA5 genotype is not responsible for these infections in our patient. These results also indicate that, surprisingly, other viruses such as influenza virus and RSV, which have (ds)RNA intermediates or byproducts that can be recognized by MDA5, are recognized and controlled by other means when MDA5 is deficient. Although it is possible that defective responses to these other viruses might occur in other MDA5-deficient cell types, our results show that this does not occur at the initial site of infection in the lung within respiratory epithelial cells. Additionally, in our patient, the decreased incidence of infections with age coincided with the maturation of antibody responses. This ability of antibodies to compensate for defective innate immunity is similarly observed in other deficiencies of innate immunity. For example, in IRF7 deficiency associated with isolated influenza susceptibility, the absence of repeated influenza infection was associated with initiation of annual seasonal influenza vaccination . Moreover, in TIR AP deficiency associated with isolated staphylococcal susceptibility, staphylococcal lipoteichoic acid (LTA)-specific antibodies were able to prevent disease by rescuing defective TLR2-dependent recognition of LTA (Israel et al., 2017) .",

Thus, unlike other primary immunodeficiencies characterized by susceptibility to highly pathogenic microbes, the lack of strong purifying selection is not unexpected for MDA5. It is still possible that heterozygous variants that impair activity also exert protective advantage as has been suggested by genome-wide association studies of type 1 diabetes mellitus (Smyth et al., 2006; Nejentsev et al., 2009) . As shown by our knockdown experiments, MDA5 function appears to be partially redundant with RIG-I function for controlling HRV replication, where other sensors can contribute to protection when MDA5 function is lacking. Although other genetic variants in the patient might have contributed to her susceptibility to influenza virus or RSV, this seems less likely since replication of influenza virus or RSV in her nasal epithelial cells was comparable to that in cells from healthy controls. Alternatively, it instead seems possible that in the setting of chronic lung disease-which is probably multifactorial from ventilator-induced lung injury, recurrent HRV infections in infancy, or other cofactors-secondary complications including susceptibility to other viruses such as influenza and RSV and bacterial superinfections ensued. Thus, in some individuals, a selective genetic susceptibility to HRV could under certain circumstances contribute more broadly to the pathogenesis of severe respiratory disease during childhood. Furthermore, in light of the known association of HRV infections as a trigger of asthma exacerbations, it will be interesting to explore whether loss-of-function mutations in IFIH1 are associated with worsened asthma outcome in susceptible individuals.",

Buffy coat cells, which were byproducts of volunteer donor blood units, were distributed in an anonymized manner, and thus were exempted from need for informed consent and Institutional Review Board review. rhinovirus molecular typing TRIzol LS reagent (Ambion) was used to extract total RNA from 350 \u00b5l of nasopharyngeal washes/aspirates obtained from patients or anonymized controls, or from laboratory virus preparations. 20 \u00b5l RNA was reverse-transcribed using a high-capacity cDNA reverse transcription kit with RNase inhibitor (Applied Biosystems). PCR was performed as described previously (Bochkov et al., 2014) , except that 32 cycles of a single round of PCR amplification were performed in a 25 \u00b5l volume using 2 \u00b5l cDNA template and 0.5 \u00b5M of forward and reverse primers.

The PCR-amplified products were resolved by electrophoresis on 2% agarose gel. PCR-amplified products were also purified by QIAquick Gel Extraction kit (QIA GEN) and cloned using TOPO TA Cloning kit for Sequencing (Invitrogen). Plasmid DNA were isolated from transformed TOP10 E. coli colonies using the R.E.A.L. Prep 96 Plasmid kit (QIA GEN). For each PCR product, 96 cloned inserts were Sanger dideoxy sequenced using plasmid-specific M13 Forward and Reverse primers. Sequences were analyzed using Sequencher 5.1 software, and BLA ST searches of GenBank sequences were performed to identify the virus serotype. The phylogenetic analysis was performed using the UPG MA method of MEGA 7 software, and all positions containing gaps and missing data were eliminated. The phylogenetic trees were drawn to scale, with branch lengths in the same units as those of the evolutionary distances used to infer the phylogenetic tree. The evolutionary distances were computed using the Maximum Composite Likelihood method and are in the units of the number of base substitutions per site. The NCBI HRV reference sequences included in the tree are HRV-A89 (NC_001617.1), HRV-B14 (NC_001490.1), and HRV-C (NC_009996,1).",

The firefly luciferase plasmids driven by the IFN-stimulated response element (pGL4.33-luc2P/ISRE/ Hygro; Promega) and the NF-\u03baB response element luciferase (pGL4.32-luc2P/NF-\u03baB-RE/Hygro; Promega) were modified to express GFP instead of the hygromycin resistance cassette. In brief, pGL4.33-luc2P/ISRE/Hygro and pGL4.32-luc2P/NF-\u03baB-RE/Hygro plasmids were digested with BamHI and NotI (New England Biolabs) and gelpurified (QIAquick Gel Extraction kit; QIA GEN) to remove the hygromycin resistance cDNA. The coding sequence of EGFP was PCR-amplified from pcDNA3-EGFP (Addgene #13031) using AccuPrime Pfx SuperMix (Invitrogen) and subcloned into the linearized vector backbones using the In-Fusion HD Cloning kit (Clontech), to generate pGL4.33-luc2P/ISRE/EGFP and pGL4.32-luc2P/NF-\u03baB-RE/EGFP. pCL20c MSCV-GFP-T2A is a modified version of the lentiviral transfer vector pCL20c MSCV-GFP (Hanawa et al., 2004) . In brief, a self-cleavage T2A peptide sequence plus additional restriction sites were added in-frame to the 3\u2032 end of the GFP cDNA from pCL20c MSCV-GFP. This was accomplished by PCR amplification of pCL20c MSCV-GFP using AccuPrime Pfx SuperMix (Invitrogen) with forward primer 5\u2032-CTA GGC GCC GGA ATT ACC GGT GGC CGG CCG CGG GCC ACC ATG GTG AGC AAG GGC GAG GAG-3\u2032 and reverse primer 5\u2032-GGC ATC GAT GCG GCC GCA TGC TCA CCT GCA GGG GCC GGG GTT CTC CTC CAC GTC GCC GCA GGT CAG CAG GCT GCC CCG GCC CTC CTT GTA CAG CTC GTC CAT GCC GAG AGT GAT CC-3\u2032.

Infection screening during routine prenatal care had indicated past maternal infection with HSV-1, Toxoplasma, and CMV. At 40 d of age, she had an upper respiratory infection that was PCR-positive for both HRV/ enterovirus and influenza B virus. She developed respiratory failure, which required mechanical ventilation including extra-corporeal membrane oxygenation. Tracheal aspirates grew out Haemophilus influenzae, Streptococcus viridans, Acinetobacter spp., enterococcus, Escherichia coli, and other coliform bacteria. Subsequently, she had more than 15 hospital admissions for respiratory distress precipitated by viral respiratory infections. Multiplex PCR revealed two episodes of influenza A; three prolonged intervals of repeated HRV/ enterovirus recovery; four episodes of coronaviruses (OC43, NL63, HKU1); two episodes of adenovirus; and one each of RSV and human parainfluenza virus type 4. Wedge lung biopsy histology, performed when she was 6 mo of age, revealed adequate alveolar architecture with evidence of chronic small airways disease (mucous stasis and collection of foamy alveolar macrophages), but without evidence of active bronchiolitis, pneumonitis, or other inflammatory processes. She continues to require supplemental oxygen, and had ground glass opacities but no bronchiectasis on chest computed tomography. She has been hospitalized on multiple occasions for coliform urinary tract infection and acute gastroenteritis with dehydration, but without detectable viral pathogens. She had an abscess near her G-tube insertion site that grew out Klebsiella pneumoniae and Enterobacter cloacae. Although she initially had low serum immunoglobulin levels and decreased lymphocyte counts (affecting T, NK, and B cell subsets), these all normalized between 3 to 4 yr old. Replacement immunoglobulins were discontinued and she has since responded with functional antibodies to tetanus, diphtheria, and Haemophilus influenzae vaccines. She has no history of opportunistic or chronic systemic virus infection including EBV or CMV despite serological evidence of past exposure. Additionally, when 2 yr of age, she developed new-onset type 1 diabetes mellitus with detectable GAD65 autoantibodies. She has short stature, low weight, hypotonia, weakness, and delays in motor and language development. Brain MRI has shown low periventricular white matter volume with ventriculomegaly, and structural abnormalities of hippocampus, olfactory bulbs, septum pellucidum, and corpus callosum. High-resolution chromosomal microarray analysis identified a 4-kb deletion on chromosome 2 that included the TM4SF20 gene. This copy number variant has been associated with language delay, white matter hyperintensities, and varied developmental abnormalities in South Asian populations (Wiszniewski et al., 2013) . Several regions of absence of heterozygosity totaling 45 MB on five separate chromosomes were also identified. She also had de novo or rare autosomal recessive variants that were identified in genes highly expressed in the brain (Table S2 ). The convergence of these multiple genetic problems in our patient illustrate how two or more distinct monogenic diseases can occur in a significant proportion of the population examined by WES (Yang et al., 2013 (Yang et al., , 2014 Retterer et al., 2016) .",

Consistent with the literature using other influenza virus strains, silencing of either RIG-I or MAVS expression increased influenza transcripts(Fig. 7, A and B; andFig. S1 F). However, silencing of MDA5 did not increase influenza virus replication, nor did it produce the notable increase in proinflammatory cytokines observed with silencing of RIG-I(Fig. 7, C-F). Infection of primary nasal epithelial cells from the patient also did not show any increased influenza virus replication as compared with her parents(Fig. 8 A and Fig. S1 G).
