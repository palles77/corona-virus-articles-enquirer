Calves were fed pasteurized whole milk (CD) or fractionated colostrum replacer (CR) at birth (d 0) and injected with vitamins according to treatment group. From d 1 through d 14 of the study, all calves were fed pasteurized whole milk (PWM) supplemented with vitamins as assigned. All calves were inoculated with Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis on d 1 and 3 of age. Calves fed CR acquired IgG 1 and haptoglobin in serum within 24 h of birth, whereas CD calves did not. The CR-fed calves were 2.5 times less likely to develop scours, and CR calves supplemented with vitamins D 3 and E also demonstrated a decreased incidence of scours. Serum vitamin levels of A, D, and E increased within treatment group by d 7 and 14 of the study. Interestingly, synergistic effects of supplemental vitamins A, D 3 , and E on serum 25-(OH)-vitamin D were observed at d 7, resulting in higher levels than in calves administered vitamin D only. Further, vitamin D 3 deficiency was observed in CD and CR calves fed a basal diet of pasteurized whole milk and no supplemental vitamins. Colonization of tissues with Mycobacterium avium ssp. paratuberculosis was negligible and was not affected by colostrum feeding or vitamin supplementation. Results demonstrated passive transfer of haptoglobin to neonatal calves, and potential health benefits of supplemental vitamins D 3 and E to calves fed pasteurized whole milk.",

            "text": "Pasteurized whole milk (PWM) is a common component in calf diets on commercial dairy farms in the United States, as producers seek to capture losses from waste milk. Recent literature, however, has suggested that PWM alone does not meet the vitamin A, D 3 , and E nutritional requirements of young calves and that these requirements are increased by increased growth rates and immune challenge (Krueger et al., 2014; Nonnecke et al., 2014) . Suggested mechanisms by which vitamin A and D 3 metabolites affect growth and immunity include the targeting of nuclear receptors to affect cell differentiation, tissue development, and immune cell signaling (Hall et al., 2011; Nelson et al., 2012; Rhinn and Doll\u00e9, 2012) , whereas vitamin E is an antioxidant that protects cell membrane unsaturated fatty acids from oxidative processes such as respiration and inflammation (Traber and Atkinson, 2007) . Pasteurized whole milk contains approximately 38.4 and 1.8 IU/L of vitamins D 3 and E, respectively, falling short of recommended daily allowances (582 and 26.5 IU, respectively) for neonatal calves (NRC, 2001; Krueger et al., 2014) . Pasteurized whole milk may satisfy the nutritional requirement for vitamin A in healthy, milkfed calves, but animals experiencing inflammation have exhibited decreased serum retinol and retinol binding protein (Rosales et al., 1996; Krueger et al., 2014) . Thus, supplemental vitamins A, D 3 , and E may benefit the neonatal calf. Commercial milk replacers often include vitamins in concentrations above those recommended by NRC (2001) as a recent technical bulletin recommended daily fortification of PWM with 20,000, 7,500, and 100 IU of vitamins A, D 3, and E, respectively, for neonatal calf diets (Wood, 2013) .",

            "text": "Although the health of neonatal calves may be affected by vitamin deficiencies, it is clear that colostrum intake plays a significant role in immune maturation and decreased morbidity. At birth, newborn calves possess cells and other components that compose the innate and adaptive arms of immunity, but lack endog-enous antibody and are highly susceptible to infection at epithelial barriers within the lungs and intestine. Feeding colostrum to calves within the first 24 h of life is accepted widely as an effective means of delivering passive protection in a dose-dependent manner (Robison et al., 1988) . Maternal colostrum contains IgG 1 antibodies, leukocytes, complement, and cytokines that confer passive immunity (Chase et al., 2008) . Because colostral leukocytes are degraded during the pasteurization and freezing processes that are recommended for commercial handling of colostrum, immune stimulatory benefits are primarily attributed to compounds in the whey fraction. Fractionated colostrum replacer, used in this study, is concentrated colostral whey that contains IgG 1 and many other nonnutritive, bioactive compounds such as IGF, lactoferrin, lysozyme, and lactoperoxidase (Tripathi and Vashishtha, 2006) . As passively transferred immunity wanes during early life, acquired immunity is essential for survival, but is potentially impaired by fat-soluble vitamin deficiencies in calves fed only PWM.",

Additionally, transmission to the neonate can occur via colostrum and milk of infected dams (Stabel et al., 2014) .

A neonatal MAP infection model was overlaid in the study design to ascertain specific effects of colostrum feeding and vitamin supplementation on uptake of MAP in the first 2 wk of life, a critical period of pathogen susceptibility for the neonatal calf.

(Montgomery, TX), and colorimetric reagents (#52-00-00, #50-85-04) were purchased from Kirkegaard and Perry Laboratories Inc. (Gaithersburg, MD). Sera were diluted 1:60,000 to achieve absorbance values within range of the standard curve. Haptoglobin was quantified by using a bovine-specific Hp ELISA (Immunology Consultants Laboratory Inc., Newberg, OR) according to manufacturer's instructions. Serum samples were diluted 1:50 in 1\u00d7 diluent according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples that resulted in absorbance values (450 nm for 0.1 s on a Victor X3 2030 multilabel reader, Perkin Elmer, Waltham, MA) that fell outside of the standard curve were diluted 1:5,000 or 1:10,000 to achieve absorbance values within range. Serum amyloid A was quantified by using the Phase Range Multispecies SAA ELISA kit (Tridelta Development Ltd., Maynooth, Co. Kildare, Ireland) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Sera were diluted 1:5,000 to achieve absorbance values within range of the standard curve. Absorbance was determined for each sample as described for serum Hp. Haptoglobin, SAA, and IgG 1 were quantified in colostrum replacer by using ELISA procedures as already described. For IgG 1 quantification, colostrum replacer was reconstituted as fed, and then dilutions were prepared at 1:25,000, 1:100,000, 1:200,000, 1:400,000, 1:800,000, and 1:1,600,000. For Hp and SAA quantification, dilutions were prepared at 1:500, 1:1,000, 1:2,000, and 1:4,000.",

            "text": "Fractionated colostrum replacer fed in this study is a derivative of maternal colostrum; specifically, the colostral fraction that comprises the majority of the dry replacer powder is colostral whey. Thus, this study reveals a previously unrecognized consequence of feeding colostral whey to dairy calves as colostrum replacer. Our principal finding was that calves consuming acellular colostral whey exhibit increased concentrations of Hp in serum within 24 h of feeding. The observed increase occurred before inoculation with MAP and, therefore, is not a result of pathogen challenge. Hiss-Pesch et al. (2011) demonstrated that both jejunal absorption of Hp and endogenous hepatic synthesis of the molecule occur within 24 h postpartum in colostrumfed piglets. Although the present study does not fully demonstrate either mechanism in calves, our finding suggests redundancy across species. Haptoglobin synthesis is induced by IL-6 type cytokines and is thought to attenuate the inflammatory response in a negative feedback loop. Therefore, greater concentrations of Hp in serum indicate more severe inflammation (Wang et al., 2001; Huntoon et al., 2008) . Huntoon et al. (2008) demonstrated aberrant adaptive immune responses in Hp knockout mice, including stunted lymphocyte maturation, disruption of antigen presentation, and failure to mount effective antibody-mediated recall responses.",

            "text": "The role of Hp in the development of immunity in adult animals suggests that its presence in colostrum also contributes to neonatal immune development that may result in decreased susceptibility to infectious pathogens. The neonatal calf is born without immunoglobulin in a hormonally induced, immunosuppressed state, and innate components of the immune system are complete albeit immature (Chase et al., 2008) . Cytokines including TNF-\u03b1, IL-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-1\u03b1, and IFN-\u03b3 in colostrum, and likely in the whey fraction, promote immune system activity, especially monocyte and neutrophil migration to tissues and T helper 2 (T H 2) biased adaptive responses (Hagiwara et al., 2000; Chase et al., 2008) , thus potentiating a requirement for Hp. Because mature B lymphocytes are scarce and respond weakly to T H 2 signaling (Chase et al., 2008) , the T H 2 bias (and potentially Hp) may contribute to establishment of microorganisms throughout the epithelial barrier tissues until a quorum for commensalism is reached. Thus, Hp in colostrum may have an integral role in immune education by supporting the T H 2 bias.",

Thus, we hypothesized that an altered inflammatory status of young calves could correlate with severity of early infection. Three tissues (distal jejunum, ileum, and ileo-cecal valve) were identified as primary sites of neonatal infection, but detection of MAP in CR-E was the default group with which comparisons were made according to alphabetical order. Colostrum-deprived calves also exhibited a lower concentration of SAA at d 1 than did CR calves, but SAA concentration at d 1 was appreciably greater than at d 0. Serum amyloid A was not conclusively quantified in colostrum replacer, but results suggest that the molecule was both transferred passively and synthesized endogenously. Krueger et al. (2014) previously identified increased SAA in calves through the first 3 wk of life that was independent of clinical health, but likely related to early recognition of microbial antigens, as the molecule is associated with high-density lipoprotein mediated clearance of bacterial LPS (Chiba et al., 2011) . Quantifiable SAA at d 1 of age in CD calves supports the hypothesis of endogenous SAA synthesis within the first 24 of life. Perhaps SAA was not a critical component of the inflammatory response in the present study because MAP does not have a LPS component.",

Calves received fractionated colostrum replacer that excluded colostral fat, and thus was assumed void of vitamins A, D 3 , and E per the manufacturer. Calves consuming maternal colostrum have additional basal exposure to fat soluble vitamins, but vitamin status of calves fed maternal colostrum (Krueger et al., 2014) are in agreement with calves of CD and CR control groups in our study, which indicates that colostral vitamins have minimal long-term effect on concentration of vitamins in serum. Injection with d-\u03b1-tocopherol caused an obvious and immediate increase in serum \u03b1-tocopherol that was only partially sustained by the oral supplement after 7 d. In contrast, metabolites of injected vitamins A and D 3 were increased only after sustained supplementation. d-\u03b1-Tocopherol is the most bioactive and bioavailable tocopherol (Jensen and Lauridsen, 2007) . In contrast, retinyl palmitate requires cleavage of the ester to yield retinol, and vitamin D 3 is hydroxylated by hepatic 25-hydroxylase to yield 25-(OH)-D 3 (Horst et al., 2005) . Therefore, the time required for metabolism of the injected vitamins A and D 3 may have exceeded the 12 to 24 h allotted before our first measurement of their metabolites in serum, whereas the d-\u03b1-tocopherol measured was the same compound that was supplemented.",
