Demographic and clinical details, epidemiological exposures, laboratory investigations, and outcomes were collated. A consultant radiologist reviewed and summarized all radiological investigations. Patients were followed until discharge from the hospital or death. MERS-CoV infection was diagnosed by reverse transcriptase PCR (RT-PCR) testing of respiratory tract samples for the MERS-CoV upE, ORF 1b, and N genes. 15 All RT-PCR tests for MERS-CoV were performed at the Saudi Ministry of Health National Laboratories in Jeddah and Riyadh, Saudi Arabia.

Most patients had pneumonia (63, 90%). The most common radiological abnormality on chest X-rays was bilateral pulmonary infiltrates, which were reported in 53 (75.7%) patients. For patients with community-acquired MERS-CoV infection, the median time from onset of symptoms to hospital admission was 5.0 (IQR 3.0-8.5) days (Table 2) . Overall, the median time from illness onset to diagnosis was 7 (IQR 3.0-13.8) days. Acute lung injury (28, 40%), acute kidney injury (30, 40.9%), and hepatic dysfunction (22, 31 .4%) were the most common complications. Cardiac arrhythmias, including variable tachyarrhythmias and severe bradycardia requiring temporary pacemaker insertion, occurred in 11 (15.7%) cases (Table 2) .",

This is consistent with previous reports that have suggested the potential for self-sustained MERS-CoV transmission to be low, especially once appropriate infection control is implemented. 18, 19 Several studies have focused on the possible role of camels in the transmission of MERS-CoV infection to humans. [20] [21] [22] In this study, animal exposure was rare and only one patient had had recent exposure to camels.

This underscores the importance of age, not only as a risk factor for acquiring MERS-CoV infection, but also as an important predictor of MERS-CoV-related mortality. Our finding is similar to that reported by Breban et al., 18 but different from the report of Assiri et al., 3 who found no association between older age and the risk of mortality. Our study has several limitations inherent to its design. First, this was a retrospective study with the potential of incomplete and possible variation of data recording according to the primary care providers. We minimized this limitation by collecting the data from the patients' medical files in addition to the infection control and preventive medicine records.

Types of infection included bacteremia (16 episodes), bacterial pneumonia (18 episodes), urinary tract infection (nine episodes), skin and soft tissue infection (12 episodes), candidemia (two episodes), and Clostridium difficile infection (one episode). Multidrug-resistant bacteria were isolated in 22 (31.4%) patients, including carbapenemresistant Acinetobacter baumannii (17 episodes), vancomycinresistant enterococci (three episodes), and methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (one episode). Infection with respiratory viruses other than MERS-CoV was not documented in any of the patients.",

However, all of their patients presented with pneumonia.3 In a case-control study, Al-Tawfiq et al. found only a few differences in the clinical presentation of MERS-CoVinfected patients compared to controls.6 Combined with our results, these observations highlight the limitations of the clinical presentation in differentiating MERS-CoV infection from other causes of pneumonia.MERS-CoV-related complications were frequently observed in our cohort of patients. The lungs, liver, and kidneys were the most commonly affected organs. Serious cardiac complications were not uncommon and were mainly in the form of arrhythmias. These observations may reflect the systemic nature of the MERS-CoV infection with its tendency to cause multi-organ involvement.Concomitant infections were commonly observed in our patients. Unlike the study byAssiri et al.  in which only admission cultures were reported,3 we included all infections within 14 days of the diagnosis of MERS-CoV infection. The majority of concomitant infections were healthcare-associated and reported in patients who required ICU care. Indeed, we found concomitant infections to be an independent risk factor for severe MERS-CoV infection requiring ICU care. The reason behind this observation is not clear, but it underscores the vulnerability of patients with severe MERS-CoV infection and emphasizes the importance of infection prevention measures. However, an immunosuppressive effect of MERS-CoV infection cannot be entirely excluded.",
