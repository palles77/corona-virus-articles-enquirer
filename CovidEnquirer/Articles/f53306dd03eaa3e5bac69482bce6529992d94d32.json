SARS-CoV 3CLpro is functionally analogous to the main picornaviral protease 3Cpro and there have been significant drug-design efforts against human rhinoviral 3C protease which is also a cysteine protease. 10 We recently described structure-based design of a number of potent SARS-CoV 3CLpro inhibitors. 11 These inhibitors were designed based upon modification of AG7088, a potent inhibitor of the human rhinoviral 3C protease. 12 While AG7088 does not exhibit inhibitory activity against SARS-CoV 3CLpro, the modified inhibitors are active in enzymatic assays as well as in cell culture assays. 13 The X-ray structure of inhibitor-bound SARS-3CLpro revealed important molecular insight into the ligand-binding sites of enzyme. 11 The inhibitors bind to SARS-CoV 3CLpro through covalent bonding with the active site cysteine 145 residue. Based upon this molecular insight, we have now modified our initial inhibitors to accommodate specific ligand-binding site interactions in the S 4 -subsite of the SARS-CoV 3CLpro active site. Herein we describe the synthesis, biological evaluation, and X-ray structures of inhibitor-bound SARS-CoV 3CLpro for two potent peptide and peptidomimetic inhibitors (Fig. 1) .",

His-172 makes hydrogen bond with the P 1 -lactam-NH, and the Glu-166 nitrogen makes a hydrogen bond with the ketone of the inhibitor. 11 The P 4 -oxazole group appears to fill in the S 4 -hydrophobic pocket. Based upon this X-ray structure, we subsequently speculated that the replacement of P 4 -oxazole with a Boc-Serine P 4 -ligand would promote additional hydrogen-bonding interactions in the S 4 -site.

The enzyme inhibitory activity of the compounds against SARS-CoV 3CLpro was determined in a FRET-based, microplate assay described by Grum-Tokars et al. 11, 16 This protocol has previously been used for the determination of IC 50 values for a,b-unsaturated esters. 17 The assays were performed in 96-well microplates using a reaction volume of 100 lL which contained 50 mM Hepes, (pH 7.5), 500 nM SARS-CoV 3CLpro enzyme, and varying concentrations of synthetic inhibitors. The reaction components, with the exception of substrate, were incubated for 20 min and the reaction was initiated by the addition of FRET-substrate [AlexaFluor \u00d2 488-cys]-Glu-Ser-Ala-Thr-Leu-Gln-Ser-Gly-Leu-Ala-[Lys-QSY \u00d2 -7]-Ser, giving a final substrate concentration of 1 lM. 11, 16 The IC 50 values for inhibitors were determined by measuring the rates of reaction with increasing inhibitor concentrations. As shown in Table 1 , our structure-based incorporation of P 4 -Boc-Ser in place of P 4 -oxazole in inhibitor 2 resulted in (inhibitor 3) significant enhancement of enzymatic inhibitory potency, while its antiviral activity was not improved. It exhibited antiviral activity similar to inhibitors 1 and 2. This difference of activity may be due to the presence of peptide-like features in the inhibitors. Peptide-like molecules often exhibit poor passive transcellular diffusion across cell membranes. Antiviral assays followed our previously published protocol. 11, 18 We have compared the binding affinity of the corresponding peptide-based inhibitors incorporating both P 4 -oxazole and P 4 -Boc Ser. Peptide-based inhibitors (4 and 5) with P 2 -Leu and P 2 -Phe have displayed 20-fold enzymatic potency enhancement over the respective inhibitors (16 and 17) containing P 4 -oxazole.",

A stereoview of the inhibitor-bound structure is shown in Figure 2 . The X-ray structure reveals that the inhibitor is covalently bonded to the enzyme via a C-S bond (1.77 \u00c5 ) to the active site cysteine (Cys-145). The P 0 1 -ethyl ester carbonyl is within proximity to Thr-26 oxygen (3.38\u00c5 ). The Leu-27 side chain makes hydrophobic contacts with the P 0 1 -ligand. Furthermore, the P 1 -lactam NH forms a hydrogen bond with the imidazole ring of His-163. The P 3 -carbonyl group of 3 forms a hydrogen bond with the NH of Glu-166.

            "title": "SARS-CoV 3CLpro was purified using a combination of ion-exchange, ammonium sulfate fractionation, and separation by hydrophobic interaction chromatography according to our published procedures. 16 The refinement statistics and data collection are summarized in Table 2. Purifed SARS-CoV 3CLpro was exchanged into buffer (20 mM Tris, pH 7.5, 10% glycerol, and 10 mM 2-mercaptoethanol) and concentrated to 35 mg/mL using an Amicon Centrifugal Filter, molecular weight cutoff 10,000 Da. The enzyme, at a concentration of 35 mg/mL, was incubated with 1 mM inhibitor on ice for 1 h prior to crystallization which was conducted by mixing 5 lL enzyme and 1 lL of mother liquor solution and allowing the mixture to undergo vapor diffusion against 11% PEG 20,000, 50 mM NaCl, 50 mM Nacacodylate, pH 6.5. Single crystals grew within 3 h and were cryoprotected and flash-frozen in liquid nitrogen. X-ray data was collected using a MAR-CCD detector at SER-CAT beamline 22-BM at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory. Data was indexed with HKL2000 and scaled and merged with SCALE-PACK (Otwinowski and Minor). 20 The structure was determined via molecular replacement using the coordinates 2ALV from the PDB (Ghosh et al.) 11 and refined with REFMAC from the CCP4 suite (Collaborative, 1994). R-Factors were minimized by an additional 4-5% by using 10 cycles of TLS refinement on 19 segments. The 3CLpro-compound 4 complex crystallized in space group C121 with one molecule in the asymmetric unit with unit cell parameters of a = 108.32 \u00c5 , b = 82.22 \u00c5 , c = 53.68 \u00c5 and b = 104.7\u00b0. The structure was determined by molecular replacement using as a search model",
