The most common adverse events were headache (n=6 [21%] in participants who received SAB-301 and n=2 [20%] in those receiving placebo), albuminuria (n=5 [18%] vs n=2 [20%]), myalgia (n=3 [11%] vs n=1 [10%]), increased creatine kinase (n=3 [11%] vs 1 [10%]), and common cold (n=3 [11%] vs n=2 [20%]). There was one serious adverse event (hospital admission for suicide attempt) in one participant who received 50 mg/kg of SAB-301. The area under the concentration-time curve (AUC) in the 50 mg/kg dose (27 498 \u00b5g \u00d7 days per mL) is comparable to the AUC that was associated with efficacy in a preclinical model. Interpretation Single infusions of SAB-301 up to 50 mg/kg appear to be safe and well tolerated in healthy participants. Human immunoglobulin derived from transchromosomic cattle could offer a new platform technology to produce fully human polyclonal IgG antibodies for other medical conditions.",

The spectrum of clinical illness ranges from asymptomatic illness to a severe acute respiratory disease requiring intensive care and mechanical ventilation. MERS has an overall mortality of 35% and there is no licensed or proven treatment. 1 The use of immune anti-MERS coronavirus (MERS-CoV) plasma has been suggested as one potential therapeutic approach. 2 However, it is difficult to collect sufficient anti-MERS-CoV plasma from infected patients to implement this strategy. 3 The use of passive immune therapy, either in the form of direct plasma infusion or intravenous immunoglobulin, is often invoked both for emerging infectious diseases, such as Ebola virus disease, 4 as well as more common diseases with high morbidity (despite the availability of antiviral therapeutics), such as severe influenza. 5 However, the use of immune plasma in all of these conditions has similar constraints. Consistent production of large quantities of anti-pathogen-neutralising human plasma or immunoglobulin requires collection of plasma from convalescent or vaccinated human volunteers. The limited plasma supply restricts wide implementation of these therapeutics. One novel alternative method of manufacturing neutralising intravenous antibodies of consistently high affinity and avidity is to use the hyperimmune plasma of transchromosomic cattle, which produce highly potent and antigen-specific, fully human polyclonal IgG de novo, and which mount a robust antibody immune response after vaccination.",

To avoid possible human-bovine interspecies incompatibility between the human immunoglobulin-\u03bc-chain protein (hIgM) and bovine transmembrane \u03b1 and \u03b2 immunoglobulins (bIg\u03b1 and bIg\u03b2) in the pre-B-cell-receptor complex, the hIgM constant domain was partly replaced with the counterpart of bovine IgM (bIgM). Furthermore, the DNA regulatory elements I\u03b31 and S\u03b31 were bovinised on the human artificial chromosome to facilitate DNA-protein interactions in the bovine B cell. This human artificial chromosome is designated as isKcHAC\u2206, and is transferred to bovine fibroblasts that are homozygous triple knockouts of the two bovine immunoglobulin-\u03bc heavy-chain loci (bIGHM and bIGHML1) and the bovine \u03bb light-chain locus (bIGL). The triple-knockout bovine fibroblasts carrying the human artificial chromosome were used as nuclear donors to clone transchromosomic cattle.",

Blood pressure at the time was 96/58 (about 20 mm Hg lower than pre-infusion), and there was no increase in heart rate. The infusion was stopped for 15 min with no other intervention, and the hypotension resolved. The infusion was restarted with no further episodes of hypotension. Low serum bicarbonate was seen only in participants receiving SAB-301 (three [11%] of 28), and were only noted in cohorts 5 (20 mg/kg of SAB-301) and 6 (50 mg/kg of SAB-301). Two vasovagal reactions occurred in participants assigned to receive SAB-301, dose-proportional increases in the parameters of C max and AUC 0-\u221e over the 20-fold range of doses from 2\u00b75 mg/kg to 50 mg/kg (table 3) . We did not use pharmacokinetic data from the 1 mg/kg cohort because a terminal phase could not be identified because of multiple concentrations that were below the limit of assay detection (15\u00b763 \u00b5g/mL). Mean concentration versus time profiles of the SAB-301 cohorts at each dose are shown in figure 2A . SAB-301 concentrations after infusion appeared to follow a bi-exponential decline and best fit a two-compartmental pharmacokinetic model. Results for key pharmacokinetic parameters from non-compartmental analysis are shown in table 4 and parameters obtained from the two-compartmental model are presented in the appendix. The average terminal elimination half-life (T 1/2 ) was within the range of a typical antibody in human beings (approximately 28 days) across all dose cohorts, excluding the 1 mg/kg cohort. Both uncorrected and baselineadjusted serum immunoglobulin concentrations over time did not appear to correlate with dose of SAB-301 administered or SAB-301 pharmacokinetic concentrations (data not shown). We determined anti-MERS neutralising antibody titres using the Jordan-N3/2012 strain of MERS-CoV (a clade A strain). Microneutralisation titres correlated with SAB-301 concentrations in serum ( figure 2B) . The functional neutralisation of the MERS virus seems to follow the pharmacokinetic exposure of SAB-301 described previously (R\u00b2=0\u00b7845, p<0\u00b70001).

The use of passive immunotherapy, either as immune plasma or intravenous immunoglobulin, has been recommended for multiple severe and emerging infectious diseases such as severe seasonal influenza, 5 pandemic influenza, 12 severe acute respiratory syndrome, 13 MERS, 2 and Ebola. 4 There are often limitations in collecting sufficient human plasma for production. 3, 5 Albeit novel, the transchromosomic bovine production system is, more importantly, rapid and scalable. In transchromosomic cattle, new antigen-specific and high-titre human intravenous immunoglobulin can be generated within 3 months of a vaccine being available. Therefore, our study is noteworthy not only by advancing a potential therapeutic for MERS, but also by showing the potential safety of a novel production platform that can quickly generate a new putative drug candidate to an emerging infectious disease. The results of this first-in-human phase 1 study suggest that SAB-301 appears to be safe and well tolerated at single doses up to 50 mg/kg. The adverse events seen in participants given SAB-301 were largely comparable to those given placebo. In events occurring in more than one participant given SAB-301, low bicarbonate, fatigue, loose stools, sore throat, vasovagal reaction, and aspartate aminotransferase increase did not have any corresponding events in the placebo group. Both vasovagal reactions occurred before study drug administration. Only low blood bicarbonate and sore throat seemed to occur more commonly in the higher dose cohort. With a small number of participants (as is typical in a phase 1 study), it is difficult to discern with certainty the attribution of adverse events to the study drug. These potential events will need to be investigated closely in any future studies.",

For mice given 500 \u03bcg (25 mg/kg, assuming 20 g body weight for mice) of SAB-301 at 24 h post infection, MERS-CoV titres were below the level of detection at day 5 (p<0\u00b70001). When SAB-301 was administered 48 h after infection, viral titres were detectable but reduced by about 1000-fold by day 5 compared with the untreated control (p<0\u00b70001). Given that animal models of MERS-CoV challenge do not replicate human disease effectively, the relevance of this model to extrapolate human efficacy is not known. The mouse dose of 500 \u03bcg (equivalent to 25 mg/kg) equates to a human dose of approximately 2 mg/kg based on body surface area conversion. In view of the high mortality rate in people with MERS-CoV infection and the difficulties extrapolating preclinical models to human disease, we suggest the highest tolerated dose in this phase 1 trial (50 mg/kg) should be used initially in human efficacy trials. The vaccine used for immunising transchromosomic cattle to generate SAB-301 is the spike protein nanoparticle vaccine of the Al-Hasa strain, which belongs to a clade B of MERS-CoV, and the pharmacokinetic data show high antibody titres towards this clade B strain. SAB-301 was previously shown to neutralise the Jordan (Jordan-N3/2012) and Erasmus Medical Center 2012 (EMC/2012) strains of MERS-CoV, both of which are clade A. 11 Therefore SAB-301 is anticipated to have naturalising capacity to current clade A and B strains of MER-CoV.",
