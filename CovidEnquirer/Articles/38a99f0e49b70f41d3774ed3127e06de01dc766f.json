Materials and methods: 4 cases of metapneumovirus pneumonia (mean age of 52.3 years) in an institutional outbreak (Castle Peak Hospital) in 2008 and 38 cases of SARS-coronovirus (mean age of 39.6 years) admitted to Tuen Mun hospital during an epidemic outbreak in 2003 were included. HRCT findings of the lungs for all patients were retrospectively reviewed by two independent radiologists. Results: In the metapneumovirus group, common HRCT features were ground glass opacities (100%), consolidation (100%), parenchymal band (100%), bronchiectasis (75%). Crazy paving pattern was absent. They were predominantly subpleural and basal in location and bilateral involvement was observed in 50% of patients. In the SARS group, common HRCT features were ground glass opacities (92.1%), interlobular septal thickening (86.8%), crazy paving pattern (73.7%) and consolidation (68%). Bronchiectasis was not seen. Majority of patient demonstrated segmental or lobar in distribution and bilateral involvement was observed in 44.7% of patients. Pleural effusion and lymphadenopathy were of consistent rare features in both groups. Conclusion: Ground glass opacities, interlobular septal thickening and consolidations were consistent HRCT manifestations in both metapneumovirus infection and SARS. The presence of bronchiectasis (0% in SARS) may point towards metapneumovirus while crazy paving pattern is more suggestive of SARS.",

The presence of centrilobular nodules, parenchymal band and consolidation are significantly more frequently present in metapneumovirus infections. Pleural effusion, lymphadenopathy and cavitation, in the contrary, were of consistent rare features in both groups. Bronchiectasis however occurred much more often in the metapneumovirus group while crazy paving pattern and septal lines occurred significant more frequently in the SARSs group. These two features, therefore, can be used as markers in differentiation between the two groups of patients during initial phase of the disease. Despite this seemingly positive finding, one should remember that these are nevertheless nonspecific and can be found in other types of viral pneumonia. In particular, bronchiectasis, although not a feature in initial stage of SARS, can occur during the healing phase in relation to fibrosis formation [15, 22, 23] . Correlation with clinical history and other parameters is therefore important in search for a diagnosis.",

Predictive values are also likely to be low. Nevertheless, these findings, when present, should alert clinician to the possibility of respiratory viral infection and prompt the referring physician to search for the diagnosis and treatment plan. Clinical information is indispensable and microbiological test remains the gold standard in making diagnosis.",
