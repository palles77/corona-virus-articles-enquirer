            "text": "The constitutional isomers and tautomers of oxadiazolones, as well as their mono-and disulfur analogues, were calculated at the B3LYP/aug-cc-pVDZ level. Four groups of 30 molecules each were considered: oxadiazolone, oxadiazolthione, thiadiazolone, and thiadiazolthione isomers. The compounds were categorized into six groups according to permutations of three heteroatoms in the five-membered ring. Additionally, each of the constitutional isomer was considered to have five tautomers conserving stable five-membered ring: two NH tautomers, two rotameric OH (or SH) forms and one CH 2 tautomer. It appeared that the largest difference between oxadiazolone O and S analogues is produced by the kind of chalcogen atom in the ring, which is strained when the O atom is in the ring while much less strained when the S-atom, of much larger van der Waals radius, is built into the ring. The external chalcogen is only modifying the general energetic factors. The comparison of energetics of analogous groups of molecules with thiadiazole and oxadiazole rings is done in details as well as differences resulting from different external chalcogen atoms are discussed as well. The presence of water surrounding was mimicked with the IEF-PCM implicit water model which did not change general isomer relative stability picture, but for some special cases indicated an extra stability of the forms with external OH or SH groups. The aromaticity monitored by the structural HOMA aromaticity index shows that the systems are not additionally stabilized by pi-electron delocalization. The fair linear correlation between the aromaticity indices of oxadiazolones and oxadiazolthiones shows that the pi-electron system in the studied systems is not sensitive to change of the external chalcogen group.",

This class of heterocycles is important for medicinal chemistry and organic synthesis. Indeed, the oxadiazole derivatives exhibit a wide range of biological activity: they are partial agonists of 5-HT 4 [1] , 5-HT 1B serotonin receptors [2] , inhibitors of severe acute respiratory syndrome [3] , and exhibit antibacterial activity [4] . Moreover, they are building blocks for anti-inflammatory [5] , antifungal [6] [7] [8] , antiparasitic [9] , and antimicrobial [10] [11] [12] [13] drugs. In addition, they show anticonvulsant [14] , anti-HIV [15] , and antituberculostatic activity [16] . They have also been used in pesticide chemistry [17] , polymer [18] , and material science [19] [20] [21] . Owing to their manifold activity, still new oxadiazole derivatives are synthesized and examined for their biological activity to search for and develop desired properties such as, for example, analgesic, antiviral, or anticancer activity [5, 22] .",

The hyperpolarizability and molecular frontier orbital energy of some donor-acceptor oxadiazoles were investigated in the context of possible non-linear optical properties by ab initio and DFT methods [28] .

Indeed, it is known that for set of molecules belonging to different structural classes the absolute error in energy (heats of formation) may exceed 10 kcal/ mol [38] . However, for selected type of reactions and small variation of functional groups, the error can be reduced to ca. 1 kcal/ mol [39, 40] . Nevertheless, a careful verification of the error of energy differences was beyond this study. Here, we deal with relative Gibbs free energies of series of constitutional isomers and tautomers. In such a case, several terms, that would introduce additional errors, are canceled. Therefore, we roughly estimate the error to ca. 2 kcal/mol. It is clear, that the differences placed within 2 kcal/mol interval must be treated with caution, yet, we believe that large differences estimated in this study cannot be reversed by an increased level of theoretical approximation.",

There are three different constitutional isomers with two adjacent N-atoms, derivatives of oxapyrazolone, and analogously there are three derivatives of oxaimidazolone, where the two N-atoms are separated either by C or O-atom (Scheme 1). All these types are labeled by the letters from A to F (Scheme 1). Each of the above compounds may undergo tautomeric changes related to the attachment of the ''acidic'' Hatom either to one of the N-atoms in the ring, the external heteroatom, or possibly to the C-atom in the ring to form CH 2 group (Scheme 2). These tautomers are labeled by numbers from 1 to 5. Attachment of the H-atom to the ring O or S atom results in ring opening and such non-heterocyclic structures are not considered further. Thus, in this study we considered 30 of C 2 H 2 N 2 O 2 and 30 of C 2 H 2 N 2 S 2 structures as well as 30 of C 2 H 2 N 2 OS and 30 of C 2 H 2-N 2 SO structures differing by external or internal position of the S-atom.

The following conclusions can be drawn from the inspection of Table 1 : Out of all oxadiazolone isomers, 3H- [1, 3, 4] oxapyrazol-2-one (A1) is the most stable. The next most stable is 4H- [1, 2, 4] oxaimidazol-5-one (B1), however, it is higher in Gibbs free energy than A1 by as much as 10 kcal/mol. 2H- [1] [2] [3] oxapyrazol-5-one (C1) and its tautomers (C2AC5) are less stable than A1 by at least 34 kcal/ mol. Surprisingly, in the group of C1 tautomers, the CH 2 tautomer is the most stable. The tautomers of 2H- [1, 2, 4] oxaimidazol-3-one (D1) are even less stable: the stablest of them, D4, is less stable than A1 by ca 48 kcal/mol. Also the tautomers of 2H- [1] [2] [3] oxapyrazol-4-one (E1) are quite unstable: the most stable one (E3) is less stable than A1 by ca. 40 kcal/mol. Finally, the tautomers of 2H- [1, 2, 5] oxaimidazol-3-one (F1) form a group which is not very unstable since the stablest tautomer (F4) is less stable than A1 by ca. 20 kcal/mol.",

However, some of the tautomers cannot be easily represented by a classical structural formula, because, it is not possible to draw one of the double bonds in the manner satisfying classical valency rules. In other words, there is no unequivocal match of the double bonds in the ring. These structures are called non-Kekul\u00e9an, while those for which the unequivocal match exists, are called Kekul\u00e9an. Observe that the entire column 2 contains only non-Kekul\u00e9an structures. There are another four non-Kekul\u00e9an structures in positions B5, D5, F5, and E1 in Table 1 .

Since in oxadiazolthione isomers the heterocyclic ring strain remains very similar to that in oxadiazolone isomers we expected that energetic differences between isomers and tautomers remain similar. This is indeed the truth which is reflected by good linear correlation between relative Gibbs free energies of oxadiazolones and corresponding oxadiazolthiones (Fig. 1a ). There are however some differences related to the fact that the substituent effect produced by the OH and SH groups, as well as by the C@O and C@S moieties, are different. Indeed, in monosubstituted benzenes, the OH group withdraws ca. 0.56 e from the sigma orbitals while donate ca. 0.12 e to the pi electron system of benzene, whereas the SH group withdraws ca. 0.15 e from sigma orbitals and donates ca. 0.09 e to the pi electron system [41] . The differences in action of the external O and S atoms in the C@O and C@S groups on heterocyclic system are connected to so called ''natural'' pi electronegativity of the two atoms which is equal to ca. 3.43 and 2.86, respectively [42] , and which can be also reflected by recently constructed pEDA(=) descriptor [43] .",

However, in contrast to data collected in Table 1 , the oxapyrazol-2-thione tautomers, A3 and A4, are the next most stable forms. For oxadiazolthione isomers, the energy difference between A1 and B1 molecules is almost equal to that for oxadiazolone isomers. Yet now, the B1 molecule is less stable than A3 and A4 forms. The B1 form is the most stable in the Btype tautomers. However, the B3 and B4 rotamers are first, degenerated energetically and second, they are only 1.5 kcal/mol less stable than the B1 form. In oxadiazolone isomers the B3 and B4 rotamers themselves are separated by ca. 1.5 kcal/mol. This is a consequence of the difference between stabilizing and destabilizing factors coexisting when the intramolecular XH\u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1Y hydrogen bonds is formed (where X= O for oxadiazolone isomers and X= S for oxadiazolthiones isomers and Y= O and N in the two cases) The XH\u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1Y intramolecular hydrogen bond is always stabilizing but much stronger for the OH\u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1Y than the SH\u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1Y moiety, because the O atom is more electronegative than the S atom.

The values in square brackets show difference to the most stable thiadiazolthione isomer while the values in parentheses show difference to the most stable tautomer of given type. ca. 8.4 kcal/mol is the next most stable one. The A1 molecule (3H-1-thiapyrazol-2-one), which has been the most stable for oxadiazolone isomers, is now only the third most stable structure. Also, the crude rules can be formulated a bit differently. The (Kekul\u00e9an) B and F structures, in which the N-atoms are separated by the C-atoms, exhibit relative free Gibbs energy not higher than ca. 12 kcal/mole. The case in which the three heteroatoms are adjacent have to be divided into subcases: the case in which the Natoms are separated by the S-atom and the case when the S-atom is adjacent to the NN-moiety. In the former case, D isomers, the energy of (Kekul\u00e9an) structures are ca. 15-20 kcal/mol energetically higher then the B1 structure, whereas in the later case, C and E forms, they are less stable by at least 28 kcal/mol. Unlike for oxadiazolone isomers, the cyclic urea derivatives, F, are quite stable (Table 3 ). For each type of constitutional isomers, the non-Kekul\u00e9an forms are the least stable. On the other hand, as for oxadiazolone isomers, the most stable tautomers in the D, E, and F groups are the OH-tautomers stabilized by an intramolecular hydrogen bond (D4, E3, and F3, respectively), however, their rotamers (D3, E4, and F4) are almost equally stable. The stability of the OH tautomers of oxadiazolone isomers depends on kind of the adjacent heteroatom being the proton acceptor in the intramolecular H-bond. This is also the case for thiadiazolone isomers, however, now the S-atom is much less electronegative than N-atom, and the OH\u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1S hydrogen bond is much weaker than the OH\u00c1 \u00c1 \u00c1N one formed in the second rotamer of the A and B type molecules. The difference is insignificant when S is at one side and the CH group on the other side of the CAOH moiety, as in the C isomers, whereas it is quite large when the CH group and the N-atom are adjacent to the CAOH group as in D and E isomers.

This is indeed reflected by good linear correlation between relative Gibbs free energies of thiadiazolthione and corresponding thiadiazolone (Fig. 1c) . Again, the linear correlation Table 3 The relative Gibbs free energies (kcal/mol) of thiadiazolone constitutional isomers and tautomers calculated based on on B3LYP/ aug-cc-pVDZ (gas, G) and B3LYP/IEF-PCM/aug-cc-pVDZ (water, W) levels. K between relative Gibbs free energies of thiadiazolthiones and corresponding oxadiazolthiones with different heteroatom in the ring is much weaker (Fig. 1d) . Indeed, as for thiadiazolones, for thiadiazolthione isomers the most stable is the B1 form, the next most stable is the F4 molecule, and the A1 isomer is only the third most stable structure ( Table 4 ). The fact that for thiadiazolone isomers the F3 molecule was more stable than F4 is not significant because the energetic gap between these rotamers is smaller than 0.4 kcal/mol. However, it is significant that for thiadiazolthione isomers the F4 isomer is higher in energy than B1 form by ca. 4. kcal/mol while for thiadiazolone isomers it is higher by over 8 kcal/mol. The (Kekul\u00e9an) B and F structures in which the N-atoms are separated by the C-atoms exhibit relative free Gibbs energy not higher than ca. 4.5 kcal/mol, while for thiadiazolone isomers it was ca. 12 kcal/mol. Thus the thiadiazolthione isomers seem to be even more stable than the thiadiazolone isomers. The D type isomers, in which the N-atoms are separated by the S-atom, are ca. 10-16 kcal/mol energetically higher than the most stable B1 structure. In the case when the Satom is adjacent to the NN-moiety, C and E forms, they are less stable than the B1 molecule by at least 23 kcal/mol. Also, the cyclic urea derivatives, F, are quite stable (Table 4 ). For each type of constitutional isomers the non-Kekul\u00e9an forms are the least stable. Finally, the SH rotamers differ in energy by at most 1.1 kcal/mol and the largest difference occurs for situation when N-atom is on the one side of the CASH group and the CH group is at the other side (E, Table 4 ).",

            "text": "Although the studied systems cannot exhibit significant aromatic character, the question about a contribution of aromatic factor into stability of the studied compounds was somehow intriguing. Therefore, we calculated the simplest but reliable structural HOMA aromaticity index [44] [45] [46] [47] to check whether there are some correlations between the index and the relative stability of the compounds, or not. Unfortunately, we found no a regular dependence between these two variables. However, there is a linear correlation between HOMA indices of oxadiazolones and oxadiazolthiones (Fig. 3) . This means that change of the external substituent @O to @S or from OH to SH does not significantly change the overall character of the pi-electronic system in the studied compounds. We did not perform the analogous analysis for the thiadiazolones and thiadiazolthiones because of lack of parameterization of the HOMA index for the S-atom incorporated into the ring. Remark first that the upper limit of the indices is ca. 0.5 while HOMA = 1.0 denotes the perfect aromaticity of benzene molecule. This means that the studied compounds are not aromatic and cannot profit from this stabilization factor. Remark next that the lower limit is somehow below \u00c01.0 (the outlying C5 point is neglected). This means, that some structures are indeed antiaromatic. The antiaromaticity means that the system exhibits alternating single and double bonds. This is not surprising that the systems denoted by number 5 have such alternations. The C@O and C@S groups enforce localization of the double bonds on these very moieties, and the presence of the CH 2 group incorporated into the ring enforces the localization of the single bonds around this group. As a result the double bond is also well localized at the N@N moiety and the systems exhibit antiaromaticity.",

It appeared that the largest difference between oxadiazolone O and S analogs is produced by the kind of chalcogen atom in the ring, which is strained when the O atom is in the ring while much less strained when the S-atom is incorporated. This is because of much larger van der Waals radius of S-atom than of O-atom. The external chalcogen is only modifying the general energetic factors.
