Uninfected calves served as controls. To determine the intestinal and systemic cellular immune status, we performed MHC-restricted cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) assay on mesenteric lymphocytes, enumerated T cell subsets in peripheral blood lymphocytes, and examined histopathological alterations in mesenteric lymph nodes and gut-associated lymphoid tissue. Target cells for the CTL assay were autologous testicular cells and effector cells were mesenteric lymphocytes from calves infected with BCV. No appreciable specific lysis was observed in any group of calves indicating the absence of demonstrable CTL responses. The T c/T s population was severely depressed in the calf inoculated with the virulent virus but not in those inoculated with either the attenuated virus or placebo. The mesenteric lymph nodes and Peyer's patches of calves inoculated with the virulent virus showed severe depletion of lymphocytes. These calves developed intestinal antibody responses in the acute phase of infection (1 week after infection) but were immunosuppressed in the later stage of infection.",

The mortality rate in BCV-infected calves is approx. 5-10% in uncomplicated cases [2] . Secondary infections in calves infected with BCV have not been commonly documented in the literature but coronavirus enteritis is often associated with rotavirus and other diarrheal agents and, in many cases, calf scours is accompanied by pneumonia. No suitable vaccine is available for the control of scours caused by BCV although one or more have been marketed. A few reports on mucosal humoral immunity in BCVinfected calves are available [3, 4] but the role of cell mediated immune (CMI) responses in BCV infection is not known. This study was undertaken to evaluate the cellular immune status of calves infected with either virulent or attenuated BCV by examining the cytotoxic lymphocyte (CTL) activity in mesenteric lymphocytes and by assessing the T cell subset alterations in the peripheral blood leukocytes of these calves. Histopathological alterations in gut-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT) of these calves were also examined.",

The administration of cephalosporins, as was done in this study, has been shown to suppress the generation of virus-specific CTLs in mice [10] .

However, no attempt was made to demonstrate the lack of this MHC. In a previous study, bovine testicular cells have been reported to be less sensitive as target cells [11] . It is possible that intraepithelial lymphocytes (IEL) may develop CTL activity because they are directly exposed to BCV in the intestinal lumen.
