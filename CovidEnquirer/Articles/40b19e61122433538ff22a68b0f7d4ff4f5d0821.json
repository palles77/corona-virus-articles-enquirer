Antigenic peptides selected by pathogen-specific cytotoxic T lymphocytes (CTLs) are presented by major histocompatibility complex (MHC; or human leukocyte antigen [HLA] in humans) molecules, and HLA-A restricted responses may be of interest for vaccine development and the understanding of cellular immunity. A series of peptides derived from the 10-KDa culture filtrate protein (CFP10) and the 6 kDa early secretory antigenic target (ESAT-6) in the Mycobacterium tuberculosis (Mtb) have been screened and a CTL epitope restricted by the human leukocyte antigen HLA-A24, a common HLA allele in Asian people, has been identified. In this study, we studied a panel of CFP10 and ESAT-6-derived peptides to identify those with binding motifs for HLA-A24 molecules. The antigenicity of candidate peptides was assessed with in vitro refolding tests and an enzyme-linked immunospot (ELISPOT) assay, and by tetramer staining to determine the capacity to stimulate CTLs from peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) of HLA-A24-positive TB Patients. We report that one novel candidate peptide at positions 5e14 of ESAT-6 of Mtb could induce peptide-specific CTLs from PBMCs of HLA-A24-positive patients, but not from HLA-A24-negative patients and HLA-A24-positive healthy controls. Identified epitope is a weak binder for HLA-A24 molecule in a mini MHC refolding assay. Since the peptide is presented by a common HLA class I molecule, it may be useful for immunotherapy against Mtb infection and vaccine development in the large population of Mtb-infected patients.",

To control mycobacterial growth, MHC class I-restricted CD8\u00fe CTLs are expected to recognize and react to target epitopes presented by antigen presenting cells during the course of infection. Moreover, the cytokine interferon gamma (IFN-g) produced by T cells has a critical role in the protective immunological response against primary infection. However, because the antigen specificity of the human T cell response is known to be strongly disciplined by HLA polymorphism [2] , the immunogenic potential of candidate vaccines needs to be elucidated in the context of major HLA polymorphisms.",

It has been previously demonstrated that ESAT-6 and CFP10 are able to stimulate T cells to produce IFN-g and display cytolytic CTL activity in humans infected with Mtb, suggesting them as potential candidates for application in an anti-tuberculosis subunit vaccine [3, 4] . A series of epitopes for CD8\u00fe T cells, restricted by certain MHC molecules, have been identified [4e7] . According to the report of the frequency of HLA alleles in humans, HLA-A24 is one of the most common HLA-A alleles worldwide, especially in Asian populations [8] . Nevertheless, relatively few epitopes presented by this molecule have been defined for human CD8 T cells in Mtb infection. In the present study, we adapted an approach utilizing a panel of synthetic peptides containing the HLA-A24-binding motifs for identification of CTL epitopes in ESAT-6 and CFP10 proteins.",

Vaccination with Mycobacterium bovis BCG (bacillus Calmette-Gu\u00e9rin) reduces the severity of tuberculosis in children; however, there is limited evidence of the efficacy of BCG vaccination when applied to adults [12] . Furthermore, vaccination may cause severe disease in immunocompromised patients, such as those infected with HIV or suffering from tumors [13] . T cells play a vital role in fighting against tuberculosis. It has been proven that CD4\u00fe T cells are essential for immunity and that CD8 T cells are indispensable parts of the antibacterial immunity [5] . Considering that BCG is a powerful stimulator of CD4 T cells and a poor stimulator of CD8 T cells, further work should focus on eliciting both potent CD8 T cell and CD4 T cell responses to achieve better immunity [14] . In this study, we used an approach starting with a computer motif prediction. The predicted binding affinity in the computer algorithm is reported as the IC50 value. A panel of 9-and 10-mer peptides derived from TB ESAT-6 and CFP10 proteins were selected for screening based on computer algorithms [15] .

We observed that the affinities of these peptides were not entirely consistent when measured by the two assays. Peptides P4, P6 and P9 could refold with the HLA-A24 heavy chain and light chain; however, no binding affinity was observed with the three peptides in the cell surface stabilization assay [15] . It has been suggested that factors such as temperature or the conformation of the heavy chain of MHC class I may affect the formation of MHC-I molecular complexes, which may account for this discrepancy [16] . To verify the results, we assayed PBMCs from TB donors to determine the CD8 \u00fe T cellspecific response to the candidate peptides. Only peptide P5specific CTLs from HLA-A24 \u00fe TB donors were significantly detected by stimulated ELISPOT assays and tetramer staining. Our study demonstrates that, although in vitro refolding is an effective approach to identify HLA class I-restricted T cell epitopes, the peptides which have refolding capacity with the corresponding HLA allele, for example P4, may not react well with T cells in further assays, such as the ELISPOT assay and tetramer staining. While the peptides which present lower binding capacity with the target HLA allele, for example P5, may distinctly induced peptide-specific CTLs. We assume that some potential T cell epitopes may be missed if we use the refolding test solely to identify peptides because there may be some peptides that bind HLA with relatively low affinity but still bind TCR with high affinity. Therefore, establishing that an immunodominant HLA-A24-restricted, TB-specific CD8\u00fe T cell epitope exists would require screening by an IFN-g ELISPOT assay and tetramer staining. This study demonstrates the presence of HLA-A24-restricted CD8 CTL specific for an M. tuberculosis protein antigen in infected individuals. Different levels of epitope-specific CD8 T cells may be found between subjects with active Mtb infection and those who contain infection (LTBI individuals). During active disease, in which antigen load is high, large numbers of CD8 T cells are indeed sequestered in the lung, and not only in peripheral blood [17] . The results obtained with PBMC in humans may not necessarily reflect the local immune response to the infection. The CTL epitope discovered could be further investigated for the subjects with latent TB where either elevated T cell frequencies could be the major force for the containment of infection, or the consequence of the persistence of pathogens inside macrophages for a long time [18] .",

Peptide P5 was a weak binder for HLA-A24 molecule and light chain in the refolding assay, and showed medium affinity in the MHC stabilization assay [15] . This sequence, encompassing residues QWNFAGIEAA, is located in the N-terminal side of the ESAT-6 protein, whose corresponding gene (esat-6) is located in RD1, which is a 10-kb DNA region deleted in the attenuated tuberculosis vaccine BCG [19] . It is well known that ESAT-6 is a dominant target for cell-mediated immunity and is frequently recognized during early TB infection [20] . In this regard, the HLA-A24-restricted CTL epitope identified in this study may be useful to enhance the CTL activity specific for Mtb protein to prevent the spread of mycobacteria in a large population of Mtb-infected patients.",
