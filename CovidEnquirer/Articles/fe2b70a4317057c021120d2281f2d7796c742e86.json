Damage-and pathogen-associated molecular patterns contribute to a self-perpetuating proinflammatory state in ALD. Triggering receptor expressed on myeloid cells 1 (TREM-1) is a surface receptor that amplifies inflammation induced by toll-like receptors (TLRs) and is expressed on neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages. We hypothesized that TREM-1 signaling contributes to proinflammatory pathway activation in ALD. Using an in vivo ALD model in mice, we tested the effects of ligand-independent TREM-1 inhibitory peptides that were formulated into human high-density lipoprotein (HDL)-mimicking complexes GF9-HDL and GA/E31-HDL. As revealed in vitro, macrophages endocytosed these rationally designed complexes through scavenger receptors. A 5-week alcohol feeding with the Lieber-DeCarli diet in mice resulted in increased serum alanine aminotransferase (ALT), liver steatosis, and increased proinflammatory cytokines in the liver. TREM-1 messenger RNA (mRNA) expression was significantly increased in alcohol-fed mice, and TREM-1 inhibitors significantly reduced this increase. TREM-1 inhibition significantly attenuated alcohol-induced spleen tyrosine kinase (SYK) activation, an early event in both TLR4 and TREM-1 signaling. The TREM-1",

In addition, excessive and/or chronic alcohol consumption disrupts the gut barrier function and changes the gut microbiome, leading to increased levels of microbial pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) in the circulation. PAMPs from portal circulation and locally released DAMPs provide proinflammatory signals in the liver for activation of resident Kupffer cells and recruitment of activated macrophages and neutrophil leukocytes from the bone marrow. (1, 2) Increased lipopolysaccharide (LPS) levels in animal models of ALD and in patients with alcoholic hepatitis contribute to macrophage and neutrophil activation and proinflammatory cascade activation by theTLR4 receptor complex. Cytokines induced by PAMPs and DAMPs contribute to a self-perpetuating proinflammatory state that characterizes alcoholic hepatitis. (3) TREM-1 is an activating receptor complex that is expressed on neutrophils and monocytes/macrophages and amplifies TLR signaling. (4) It has been shown that TREM-1 can amplify TLR4-mediated as well as TLR2-mediated proinflammatory signals. (5, 6) The expression and function of TREM-1 has been indicated in various inflammatory diseases, including sepsis, cancer, retinopathy of prematurity (ROP), atherosclerosis, and experimental colitis. (7) (8) (9) Expression of TREM-1 in hepatic stellate cells was proposed as a prognostic factor in hepatitis B-related hepatocellular carcinoma (HCC), and TREM-1-mediated Kupffer cell activation was found in HCC. (10, 11) Little is known about the role of TREM-1 in ALD. Here, we hypothesized that inhibition of TREM-1 will ameliorate inflammation and liver damage in ALD, given the known role of TREM-1 in myeloid cell activation and amplification of proinflammatory signaling.",

(18) (19) (20) Briefly, BALB/c murine macrophage J774A.1 cells (ATCC) were cultured at 37\u00b0C with 5% CO 2 in Dulbecco's modified Eagle's medium (Cellgro Mediatech, Manassas, VA) with 2 mM glutamine, 100 U/mL penicillin, 0.1 mg/mL streptomycin, and 10% heat-inactivated fetal bovine serum (Cellgro Mediatech) and grown to approximately 90% confluency in 12-well tissue culture plates (Corning Costar, Corning, NY). After reaching target confluency, cells were incubated for 1 hour in medium with or without fucoidan (400 \u03bcg/mL), BLT-1 (10 \u03bcM), or cytochalasin D (40 \u03bcM). Cells were subsequently incubated for 4 hours and 22 hours at 37\u00b0C in medium containing 2 \u03bcM of rho B-labeled GF9-HDL or GA/E31-HDL (as calculated for rho B). Cells were washed twice using phosphate-buffered saline and lysed using Passive Lysis Buffer (Promega, Madison, WI). Rho B fluorescence was measured in the lysates with 544-nm excitation and 590-nm emission filters, using a Fluoroscan Ascent CF fluorescence microplate reader (Thermo Labsystems, Vantaa, Finland). Protein concentrations in the lysates were measured using Bradford reagent (Sigma-Aldrich) and an MRX microplate reader (Dynex Technologies, Chantilly, VA) according to the manufacturer's recommended protocol. animals C57BL/6 female mice (10-to 12-week-old) were purchased from the Jackson Laboratory (Bar Harbor, ME) and housed at the University of Massachusetts Medical School (UMMS) animal facility. All animals received humane care in accordance with protocols approved by the UMMS Institutional Animal Use and Care Committee. Mice (n = 6-9/group) were acclimated to a Lieber-DeCarli liquid diet of 5% ethanol (EtOH) (volume [vol]/vol) over a period of 1 week, then maintained on the 5% diet for 4 weeks. Pair-fed (PF) control mice were fed a calorie-matched dextran-maltose diet. All animals had unrestricted access to water throughout the entire experimental period. In treated groups, mice were intraperitoneally treated 5 days/week with vehicle (empty HDL) or the TREM-1 inhibitory formulations GF9-HDL (2.5 mg of GF9/kg) or GA/E31-HDL (4 mg equivalent of GF9/kg) (SignaBlok, Shrewsbury, MA) from the first day on a 5% EtOH diet. At the end of all animal experiments, cheek blood samples were collected in serum collection tubes (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) and processed within an hour. After blood collections, mice were euthanized and liver samples were harvested and stored at \u221280\u00b0C until further analysis.",

(4) Proinflammatory cytokine expression is increased in ALD (1) (2) (3) 23, 24) ; therefore, we hypothesized that TREM-1 signaling contributes to the amplification of proinflammatory pathways in ALD. To evaluate this hypothesis, first we tested whole-liver mRNAs of EtOH-fed and PF mice with or without treatment with two different TREM-1 inhibitory formulations and a vehicle control in a 5-week alcohol administration model of ALD in mice. (25) We found that mRNA levels of TREM-1 and MCP-1 were significantly increased in livers of alcohol-fed mice compared to PF controls (Fig. 1A,B) . In contrast, in mice treated with the TREM-1 inhibitors, both GF9-HDL and GA/E31-HDL inhibited alcohol-related changes in TREM-1; in addition, MCP-1 mRNA levels corresponded to those of the PF controls (Fig. 1A,B) . Although induction of TNF-\u03b1 and IL-1\u00df in alcohol-fed mice did not reach statistical significance compared to PF controls, TREM-1 blockade by GF9-HDL resulted in a significant inhibition of TNF-\u03b1 mRNA in the alcohol-fed mice compared to vehicle treatment (Fig. 1C) , while IL-1\u00df mRNA expression was also significantly attenuated by both the GF9-HDL and GA/E31-HDL formulations in the alcohol-fed as well as in the PF groups (Fig. 1D ). MIP-1\u03b1 mRNA levels were increased in alcohol-fed mice, but TREM-1 blockade with GF9-HDL or GA/E31-HDL significantly attenuated this increase compared to the vehicle control (Fig. 1E) . Regulated on activation, normal T cell expressed, and secreted (RANTES) mRNA levels did not change regardless of alcohol feeding or TREM-1 treatment (Fig. 1F ). Next, we used specific ELISA kits to assess the protein levels of cytokines in the serum and in wholeliver lysates (Fig. 2) . We found a significant increase in MCP-1 level in the serum and liver and TNF-\u03b1 in the liver of alcohol-fed mice compared to PF controls ( Fig. 2A-D) . All these alcohol-induced increases were prevented both in the serum and liver by administration of either TREM-1 inhibitor. Interestingly, we found attenuation of alcohol-induced liver MCP-1 and TNF-\u03b1 induction even in the vehicle-treated (HDL only) groups ( Fig. 2A-C) . The increase in total IL-1\u00df levels after alcohol feeding and its attenuation by TREM-1 inhibition did not reach statistical significance (Fig. 2D) .",

Treatment with novel ligand-independent TREM-1 inhibitors reduced the expression of the TREM-1 molecule itself, attenuated or fully prevented alcohol-induced increases in proinflammatory cytokines at the mRNA level, and inhibited SYK activation. We demonstrated that TREM-1 blockade results in reduced macrophage and neutrophil infiltration and activation indicated by reduced F4/80, CD68, Ly6G, and MPO expression in the liver. These findings complement our previous data demonstrating that TREM-1 blockade using GF9-HDL and GA/ E31-HDL suppresses macrophage infiltration of the tumor in cancer mice. (17) The TREM-1 inhibitors attenuated alcohol-induced liver steatosis. HDL and the TREM-1 inhibitors also attenuated liver injury and markers of early fibrosis in alcohol-fed mice. Interestingly, the HDL vehicle control showed similar efficiency as the inhibitory formulations at the protein level of the proinflammatory cytokines. We discovered that HDL has some protective effects on ALD at the level of ALT and lipid oxidation.",

            "text": "While the ligand of TREM-1 is still unknown, it has been shown that TREM-1 activation amplifies inflammation and synergizes with TLR signaling pathways. (34) It was also observed that bacterial infection and challenge with LPS or lipoteichoic acid increase TREM-1 expression, (7) indicating a positive feedback loop among PAMP exposure, TREM-1 expression, and inflammatory cytokine induction. Different DAMPs, such as high-mobility group box protein 1 [Correction made 31 October, 2018. The correct protein was noted.] and heat shock protein 70, have been suggested to stimulate TREM-1, (35) while other studies found cell (granulocyte and platelet)-surfaceassociated activators as well. (35, 36) Both PAMPs and DAMPs are present in ALD, providing potential mechanisms for TREM-1 up-regulation in this disease. Alcohol induces changes in the gut microbiome and disrupts the gut barrier function, resulting in increased levels of endotoxin and microbial PAMPs in circulation. (1, 37) Alcohol also causes hepatocyte damage that leads to the release of DAMPs, (23) and all these processes contribute to TREM-1 activation. TREM-1 signaling leads to phosphorylation and activation of SYK, which has been indicated as a major regulator in inflammatory processes in ALD. (38) TREM-1 also amplifies TLR4 signaling that involves downstream SYK activation and phosphorylation. (38) Indeed, we found increased total and phosphorylated SYK levels in the livers of alcohol-fed mice that was attenuated by TREM-1 inhibitor administration. A previous study showed that inhibition of SYK activation attenuates alcohol-induced liver inflammation, cell death, and steatosis, suggesting that the SYK pathway could be a feasible therapeutic target in ALD. (24) SYK is expressed in a wild spectrum of cells, while TREM-1 inhibition may specifically modulate macrophages, neutrophils, and stellate cells that each play a role in ALD. Another advantage of TREM-1 inhibition is that it likely attenuates signaling from a broader spectrum of TLRs, not only TLR4.",

(40) Furthermore, TREM-1 expression was highly up-regulated on the surface of infiltrating monocytes and neutrophils in human tissues infected by bacteria, highlighting the importance of this receptor in these processes. (7) In alcoholic hepatitis, neutrophils infiltrate the liver, inducing oxidative stress and cytotoxicity that contributes to the high mortality of the disease. (2) We showed that these processes can be attenuated by TREM-1 inhibitors. Mechanistically, the GF9-HDL and GA/E31-HDL formulations target the liver more efficiently than only the peptides alone and release the TREM-1 inhibitory sequences inside the target cells where these peptides likely inhibit TREM-1 signaling by disrupting the intramembrane interactions of the TREM-1 receptor and its signaling adaptor molecule DNAX activation protein of 12kDa [Correction made 31 October, 2018. The correct protein was noted.] (Fig. 7) . (15) (16) (17) We previously hypothesized that the observed preferential endocytosis of GF9-HDL and GA/E31-HDL by macrophages and hepatic clearance of these complexes are mediated by SR recognition of putative epitopes in the modified apo A-I peptide constituents of GF9-HDL and GA/E31-HDL. (16, 17, 19) Our current findings indicate that GF9-HDL and GA/E31-HDL are largely recognized by SR-A on macrophages (Fig. 7) . We also observed SR-BI-mediated uptake, which likely explains the previously observed hepatic clearance for these complexes in another animal model. (19) While these data confirm our hypothesis, future studies are needed to determine the clearance properties for GF9-HDL and GA/E31-HDL in ALD.",

(16, 17) We suggest that SR-A epitopes are similarly exposed on GA31 and GE31 in GA/ E31-HDL and on PA22 and PE22 in GF9-HDL, providing similar uptake of these complexes and as a result delivery of TREM-1 inhibitory GF9 peptide sequences in vivo. The use of GA/E31-HDL in the further development of effective and low-toxicity therapy for ALD is advantageous because it makes the entire manufacturing process easier and less expensive. We also suggest that the in vitro macrophage uptake assay can be potentially used to predict the outcomes for macrophage-targeted TREM-1 therapy in vivo.",

            "text": "Our study shows that TREM-1 inhibitors with HDL formulation exerted significant inhibition on early signaling events of proinflammatory processes at the level of cytokine mRNA and the activated p-SYK protein levels compared to the HDL vehicle alone in a mouse model of ALD. This effect presumably would be even more obvious at the protein level of cytokines in a more severe liver injury. However, in mice, the most commonly used 5-week alcohol feeding that we used resulted in moderate liver damage and minimal inflammation, (25) which is a limitation of our study. Importantly, as shown on the stained liver sections, the GF9-HDL and GA/ E31-HDL formulations significantly inhibited immune cell infiltration and steatosis compared to the HDL vehicle only group [Correction made 31 October, 2018. The word group was added.] in mice with ALD. Thus, exploration of TREM-1 inhibitors in decreasing inflammation deserves further investigation in ALD.",

(A) Schematic representation for the proposed role of TREM-1 signaling in ALD and the SCHOOL mechanism of TREM-1 blockade. (A, left panel) Activation of the TREM-1/DAP12 receptor complex expressed on Kupffer cells leads to phosphorylation of the DAP12 cytoplasmic signaling domain, subsequent SYK recruitment, and the downstream inflammatory cytokine response. (A, right panel) SR-mediated endocytosis of HDL-bound GF9 peptide inhibitors by Kupffer cells results in the release of GF9 (GA31 or GE31) into the cytoplasm; GF9 self-penetrates the cell membrane and blocks intramembrane interactions between TREM-1 and DAP12, thereby preventing DAP12 phosphorylation and the downstream signaling cascade. (B,C) Macrophage uptake of GF9-HDL and GA/E31-HDL in vitro is SR mediated in a time-dependent manner and is largely driven by SR-A. As described in the Materials and Methods, J774 macrophages were cultured at 37\u00b0C overnight with medium. Prior to uptake of GF9-HDL and GA/E31-HDL, cells were treated for 1 hour at 37\u00b0C with 40 \u00b5M cytochalasin D and either (B) 400 \u00b5g/mL fucoidan or (C) 10 \u00b5M BLT-1, as indicated. Cells were then incubated for either 4 hours or 22 hours with medium containing 2 \u00b5M rho B-labeled GF9-HDL (gray bars) or GA/E31-HDL (black bars), respectively. Cells were lysed, and rho B fluorescence intensities of lysates were measured and normalized to the protein content. Results are expressed as mean \u00b1 SEM (n = 3); *P \u2264 0.05; **P \u2264 0.01; ****P \u2264 0.0001 versus uptake of GF9-HDL and GA/E31-HDL in the absence of inhibitor.
