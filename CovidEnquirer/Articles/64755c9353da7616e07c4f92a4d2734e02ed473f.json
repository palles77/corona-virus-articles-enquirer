Establishment of a HCT emergency team. A HCT emergency preparedness team should be developed ( Figure 2 ). This team will develop the specifics of the plan, organize the entire staff, be charged with conducting drills, overseeing training, monitoring performance during an emergency response, and ensuring that recovery efforts take place. placed include inpatient and outpatient nursing stations, stem cell laboratories, homes of key individuals, etc. Because this information will become outdated, a schedule for routine replacement, e.g., monthly or bi-monthly, should be implemented. 4. Inpatient and outpatient capacity. An assessment of one's program's capacity, how it might be affected by an emergency, and planning for \"surge\" capacity or provisions for reduced capacity is advisable. One's center may face a shortage of inpatient or critical care beds due to either an influx of patients hospitalized from injuries or illness from the emergency event or an inability to discharge patients because of a lack of community services, housing or transportation. Similarly, outpatient and home care services may be severely affected resulting in a need to hospitalize outpatients. One consideration to weigh is whether there are any possibilities to temporarily increase capacity and what steps would be needed to make it happen. One should consider delay of new transplant procedures wherever possible to free up beds. Strong consideration should be given to relocation of patients whenever possible to communities not affected (see below). For patients needing intensive outpatient care that is disrupted by the emergency, one may consider admitting them early to ensure an inpatient bed. 5. Reciprocal arrangements with other centers. Development of a relationship with one or more neighboring \"buddy\" centers that may assist in assuming care of patients if one's center cannot accommodate needed patient care may be useful; joint practices and communications testing between the two centers periodically is advisable. One should consider a relationship of one center in the same FEMA district and one in a different FEMA district. Consider establishing videoconfenercing facilities to maintain educational programs in the event that some centers will be quarantined. 6. Public Information tools and media relationship skills building. Learning some basic media relations skills is important. Knowing in advance the contact numbers of local radio and television stations that are good conduits of public information is important and may be used to communicate with staff (see below under Response). This is best done in conjunction with the public relations department of the hospital which is well placed to coordinate announcements from the hospital, especially its command center, as well as municipal, state and federal authorities so that a consistent message is conveyed. 7. Backup of patient and stem cell database. All hospital patient information systems have extensive backup precautions to prevent loss of patient data. The BMT program's customized database of patient and stem cell information may be part of the hospital system or maintained separately. If the latter, it is important to have backup systems in place, preferably with a copy of the database off site. 8. Checklist of specific HCT needs. A checklist of specific HCT concerns should be created and maintained ( Figure 3 ). For each concern, the center should develop specific local plans. Below are suggestions based on various committee members' experiences of specific emergencies faced by their program.",

Pregnant women may need special provisions for either infectious or radiation events. Provision for staff support (child care, transportation, etc) may be necessary since some emergencies may result in school or childcare closures, affecting dependent children of staff members. Some centers have set up on-site temporary childcare for staff needed to provide essential services. Relief of on-duty staff should also be planned.

If the center finds that it cannot provide key services, has a reduced capacity, or the public services outside of the center are compromised, then return of some (or most) patients to health providers in communities not affected may be the most prudent course of action. Whenever possible, this should be anticipated if there is advance warning, and, if not, done as early as possible once the need becomes apparent. This can alleviate pressure on overburdened staff and facilities and optimizes delivery of needed services to patients who cannot be relocated. If relocation is done, one should remember that arrangements for blood transfusion support is key, with appropriate communication as to provisions for irradiation and CMV appropriate products (or filtration alternatively).",

            "text": "Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS): The SARS epidemic, starting in March 2003, caught Toronto, and indeed, Canada unprepared. By the time it was contained in Toronto it had involved more than 250 probable cases, resulted in 43 deaths and cost an estimated one billion dollars. A striking aspect to the ASBMT COMMITTEE REPORT healthcare workers directly involved at the onset of the epidemic was the uncertainty surrounding the mode of transmission of the disease, its surveillance, containment and management. While initially this led to some confusion, healthcare workers experienced a rather steep learning curve as the epidemic progressed and more information about the nature of the infective organism became known and available. In retrospect, several issues emerge as important to the management of a HCT Program during this period. One was surveillance at the hospital entrance of patients with clinic appointments. Requirements of surveillance included obtaining a history of contact with possible or probable cases, a history of symptoms, including fever, and a tympanic temperature measurement. The challenge was to distinguish possible symptoms of SARS from the expected symptoms and signs in the many patients with febrile neutropenia visiting the clinic. Some of these patients required further evaluation, and because they were initially to be regarded as possible cases of SARS, physical examination needed to be conducted in a negative pressure room. This was a particular challenge for those medical facilities that lacked adequate numbers of (or indeed, any) negative pressure rooms. Moreover, patient (and staff-separate entrance) surveillance invariably resulted in queuing at hospital entrances at peak times which was uncomfortable to those waiting outside in the cold. The lessons here include the need for an adequate number of negative pressure rooms in the out-patient clinic setting and the importance of regular information sessions to medical staff regarding the outbreak so that they can interact effectively with patients (and their co-workers).",

These individuals were monitored regularly by public health personnel. Either way they were no longer available as healthcare workers resulting in reduced staffing in medical units, including HCT programs. The lesson here is that transplant volume needs to be adjusted nimbly to accommodate the considerable reductions in healthcare staff that can occur quickly.",

It was particularly important to protect staff in regular contact with immunocompromised patients not only for their own sake but to ensure the safety of the transplant unit.",

In some cases, they were postponed because of the lack of availability of acute care services or were transferred to other institutions if this was permitted by government directives. The lesson from this experience is that input from transplant directors is important when planning is done and should be integrated at all levels of decision-making.",
