The challenge faced by clinicians in accurately diagnosing infections extends not only to outbreaks in the field but also to routine patient care in community hospitals and clinics. Individual molecular testing for the vast majority of pathogens is typically not available except as sendout assays to highly specialized reference laboratories.

The CRISPR-Cas system in bacteria has evolved as a mechanism to fight off viruses by cleaving DNA or RNA sequences from the invading phage (Hille et al., 2018) . This technology, now widely repurposed for gene-editing applications, involves families of enzymes that are able to precisely cleave doublestranded DNA (dsDNA) or single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) at sequences complementary to a guide RNA. For purposes of detection, the groups here leverage the ''collateral activity'' of either the Cas13 enzyme in indiscriminately cleaving ssRNA Myhrvold et al., 2018) or the Cas12a enzyme in cleaving single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) (Chen et al., 2018) . Once the guide RNA is activated by a complementary sequence, cleavage of a labeled ssRNA or ssDNA probe generates a signal that can provide a fluorescent readout in a number of portable formats, including the use of disposable paper strips ( Figure 1 ).",

Nucleic acid amplification tests such as PCR are generally considered to be the most sensitive and specific tests available. However, these tests typically incorporate multiple steps to run the assay, including an upfront nucleic acid extraction step, and require dedicated instrumentation. In contrast, both groups demonstrate here that CRISPR-Cas-based assays can be run directly on primary clinical samples as a single reaction and performed using minimal or no equipment. The assays are also amenable to the use of lyophilized reagents, foregoing the need for maintenance of a cold chain, and thus are attractive for use in the field. However, the CRISPR-Cas assays are also shown to exhibit high sensitivity and specificity of detection, achieving a performance comparable to that of PCR. Interestingly, this may be due to the fact that an isothermal amplification is still required as part of the CRISPR-Casbased assay protocol to generate detectable fluorescent signal. At the same time, these assays are similar to antigen-based tests with respect to ease of use and speed, with a sample-to-answer turnaround time of 1-2 hr.",

The last two examples are of particular relevance to public health epidemiology. However, the clinical utility of the assay can also be potentially extrapolated to individual patients, such as the determination of a particular hepatitis C virus (HCV) genotype to guide the choice of antiviral therapy (AASLD/IDSA HCV Guidance Panel, 2015).",

This successful demonstration extends the potential application of CRISPR-Cas technologies from infectious diseases to other fields. Rapid detection of single-nucleotide polymorphisms from circulating tumor cells in blood, for instance, may usher in a new era of point-of-care diagnostics for early cancer. A CRISPR-Cas-based assay can also be leveraged for use as both a companion diagnostic and treatment. For example, the Broad Institute group describes the repair of a mutation in the APC gene that has been linked to familial adenomatous polyposis, an inherited condition greatly increasing the risk of colonic and rectal cancers in affected individuals. Using SHERLOCK, they simultaneously genotyped and edited out the APC gene from a human embryonic kidney (HEK293) cell line containing the insert.",

Fundamentally, the assay is still a targeted detection test using specific primers and probes and is thus subject to the same limitations. Deploying the test for emerging outbreak investigation may not be useful if the cause of an outbreak is not known. For example, cryptic transmission and circulation of ZIKV had been ongoing in Brazil for more than a year prior to its initial identification in May of 2015 (Faria et al., 2017) , in part because ZIKV had never been seen in the Americas and so had not been considered as a candidate outbreak pathogen a priori. In addition, the high specificity of CRISPR/Cas cleavage, although of value for a targeted diagnostic, can be challenging with RNA viruses such as ZIKV and EBOV that rapidly mutate. Indeed, mutations in the EBOV genome likely resulted in decreased sensitivity and performance of existing PCR assays in detection of the Makona strain that caused the 2014 EBOV outbreak in West Africa (Sozhamannan et al., 2015) .",
