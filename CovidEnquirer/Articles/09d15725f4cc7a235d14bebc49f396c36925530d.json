This has been driven by several recent worldwide developments including: (i) the rising incidence of diseases such as Acquired Immune Defi ciency Syndrome (AIDS) and antibiotic-resistant tuberculosis; (ii) antibiotic-resistant bacterial strains presenting a severe health threat in hospitals; (iii) the rapid spread of new pathogens such as Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS); and (iv) the threat of bioterrorism. Indeed, nearly 25% of annual deaths worldwide are due to infectious disease ( Morens et al., 2004 ) . Thus, the need to develop new diagnostic methods, more effective vaccines and better therapeutic strategies is urgent.",

            "text": "In order to effectively deal with infectious disease threats, it is important to understand both the pathogen and the response of the host, since the outcome of infection is determined by complex host-pathogen interactions. Pathogens are initially detected by the surveillance cells of the innate immune system using cell surface receptors known as Toll-like receptors (TLRs) (reviewed in ). These TLRs recognize specifi c components of the pathogen, for example, bacterial lipopolysaccharide (LPS) or double-stranded (ds) RNA from viruses. While many cell types express TLRs, cells of the innate immune system such as dendritic cells (DCs) and macrophages play particularly important roles in detecting and responding to pathogens. The response of these cells to a pathogen is determined by the specifi c pathogen component that interacts with the TLR and the specifi c TLR family member that is activated. Widespread changes in gene expression are detected following TLR activation and the activated cells produce a plethora of cytokines and chemokines that then activate the adaptive arm of the immune system. The specifi c cytokines and chemokines produced by the TLR-activated cells tailor the response of the adaptive immune system to deal with the specifi c pathogen . Thus, the initial host response to a pathogen through the TLRs determines the outcome of the infection. Host response to infection can be a double-edged sword in that sometimes the response itself can create an adverse outcome for the host. In addition, the aberrant response of the host to self instead of foreign pathogens can create severe pathologies involving chronic infl ammatory and autoimmune diseases.",

In addition, different individuals in a population can have very different responses to a genetically identical pathogen. While there are many complex reasons for this, it is clear that part of the differential response is governed by underlying genetic differences between individuals ( Clementi and Di Gianantonio, 2006 ; Zhang and Zhang, 2006 ) . Studies in mouse models of infection have clearly demonstrated that these genetic differences are complex and may involve more than one genetic locus for a given susceptibility or resistance trait (e.g., [Delahaye et al., 2006 ] ). While there are some classic examples of genetic mutations affecting the response of the host to a pathogen (e.g., malaria and sickle cell mutations) there is much to be learned before the genetics of host susceptibility is fully understood. The advent of genome-wide genotyping using single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) or microsatellite markers, leading to major advances in molecular epidemiology, will revolutionize our ability to determine the complexities of the genetic component of pathogen-host interactions ( Weiss and Terwilliger, 2000 ) .",

This activation process includes widespread changes in the gene expression profi le of the cells with hundreds of genes being either switched on or off in response to signals generated from the pathogen-detecting TLRs. The response of individual genes has been studied in minute detail for a handful of genes and while this has produced an understanding of some aspects of host response to infection it by no means gives us the total picture. Understanding the molecular response of the host to infection has been greatly improved by using microarray-based technologies and these technologies are opening up new diagnostic possibilities as well as presenting new therapeutic options ( Aderem and Smith, 2004 ; Bryant et al., 2004 ; Feezor et al., 2005 ; Hedeler et al., 2006 ; Korth and Katze, 2002 ; Ng et al., 2006 ; Ricciardi-Castagnoli, 2005 ; Ricciardi-Castagnoli and Granucci, 2002 ; Smith and Bolouri, 2005 ) . This chapter will focus on two aspects of the host response to pathogens where major advances are being made using genomics approaches and will describe the future impact of these approaches on the development of diagnostics and therapeutics for infectious disease. These are (i) defi ning the basis of genetic susceptibility to infection and (ii) the defi nition of the system-wide molecular response to a pathogen.",

However, these diseases account for only a very small proportion of the human disease burden and many of the more common and fatal diseases have a complex etiology with many genetic and environmental contributions. While it is clear that most complex disease has a genetic component, defi ning that genetic component has been diffi cult to date since many complex diseases such as coronary heart disease, diabetes and others are polygenic with different genetic loci contributing in major or minor ways to disease susceptibility. In addition, in different populations or under different environmental conditions, distinct but overlapping sets of genetic loci are likely to contribute.

Mapping the genetic components of susceptibility to infection in human populations has been much more difficult due to the large natural variation in humans, the polygenic nature of this trait and the low penetrance of many of the susceptibility alleles. For infectious disease, this is complicated even more by the complex nature of the environmental infl uences particularly the fact that these diseases, unlike other complex diseases, are transmissible in populations.

In recent years genetic manipulation of specifi c loci by deletion or mutation has provided many mouse models for screening ( Mak et al., 2001 ) . The use of ethylnitrosourea (ENU) mutagenesis to randomly create point mutations in the mouse genome has opened up a new forward genetics approach to identifying susceptibility loci (Papathanasiou and Goodnow, 2005 ) . This chemical mutagen, when used at appropriate doses and at the correct stage of development, can introduce single point mutations into the mouse genome. By screening libraries of mutant mice for susceptibility to specifi c pathogens, it should be possible to identify genetic loci that dictate susceptibility or resistance to a range of pathogens on a large scale. It is relatively straightforward to identify a chromosomal region involved in susceptibility in these mouse strains by genotyping with microsatellite markers, but identifying the specifi c gene that is mutated is still very time-consuming. The speed with which this can be achieved depends on the presence of candidate genes within the chromosomal interval or the ability to resequence large amounts of DNA. The latter is becoming achievable with the advent of new rapid sequencing technologies and is set to revolutionize forward genetic approaches to disease understanding ( Bennett et al., 2005 ; Serre and Hudson, 2006 ) .",

Family studies, especially twin studies, and population studies have clearly shown a genetic component to susceptibility to infectious disease ( Frodsham and Hill, 2004 ; Lipoldova and Demant, 2006; Strunk and Burgner, 2006 ) . Susceptibility generally follows a complex pattern of inheritance and there are two main methods of mapping and identifying genetic loci involved in such complex heredity. These are either association studies or linkage studies. Association studies involve screening populations for specifi c mutations in a candidate gene(s) in case-control studies or in family studies. This type of approach identifi ed the link between Human Immunodefi ciency Virus (HIV) resistance and the chemokine receptor, CCR5 described below ( Dean et al., 1996; Samson et al., 1996 ) . Genome-wide association studies although still quite expensive are now becoming feasible and being used to defi ne linkage between specifi c markers and susceptibility. These linkage studies depend on the availability of markers and the density of these markers is rapidly increasing T A B L E 1 0 7 . 1 List of well-described susceptibility loci for resistance or susceptibility to infectious disease.",

The selection of which SNPs to use and the large numbers of samples needed to generate statistically significant associations for low penetrance alleles are still challenges. The Haplotype MAP (HapMap) project is starting to identify haplotypes within different population groups and together with improvements in large scale genotyping technology and bioinformatics should be useful in studies of complex disease inheritance. Table 107 .1 summarizes the best studied genetic susceptibility loci for response to different infectious agents in both mouse models and human studies. One of the classical examples of genetic susceptibility to infection is the role of the hemaglobinopathies in the outcome of malaria infection ( Patrinos et al., 2005 ) . There are also certain chromosomal regions and families of genes that have attracted attention in terms of searching for susceptibility alleles or polymorphisms. Because the TLR family of receptors plays a major role in recognizing pathogens, it was speculated that genetic variation in these receptors or their signaling pathways might be responsible for some susceptibility phenotypes (reviewed in [Schroder and Schumann, 2005 ] ). One of the best examples to date is the occurrence of a single polymorphism in the region of the human TLR4 gene encoding the extracellular domain of the receptor which confers reduced sensitivity to inhaled Escherichia coli ( E. coli) LPS ( Arbour et al., 2000 ) . Interestingly, when septic shock patients were compared with a control group, these lower-responding alleles were found only in the septic shock group and these individuals had a higher incidence of Gramnegative bacterial infection ( Feterowski et al., 2003 ) . Such studies need further confi rmation since there are also a number of studies that failed to fi nd any linkage between TLR4 mutations and response to various infections ( Schroder and Schumann, 2005) . There is also enormous variation in the response of individuals to LPS even in the absence of TLR4 mutations implying that variation may occur in other components of the TLR4 signaling system. An example of this is the link between IRAK4 mutations and increased susceptibility to infection with pyogenic bacteria ( Picard et al., 2003 ) . Variation in other TLR genes has also been associated with disease susceptibility. For example, a mutation in the extracellular domain of TLR2 is linked to susceptibility to leprosy ( Alcais et al., 2005 ) and a mutation in TLR5 increases susceptibility to Legionella . Taken together these data support the idea that variation in the innate immune recognition of pathogens play an important part in governing susceptibility to an array of infectious diseases. However, caution needs to be exercised until larger population groups have been studied.",

Candidate genes have emerged from many sources including mouse genetic studies as well as biochemical and function dissection of the immune system. Once a candidate gene is identifi ed, the chromosomal region spanning this gene in the human genome is then scanned for the occurrence of specifi c mutations or for functional polymorphisms in casecontrol studies across populations or in linkage studies in family groups. Such studies have identifi ed a number of well described susceptibility loci for infection with various pathogens. One of the most heralded example was the identifi cation of a deletion in the chemokine receptor, CCR5, which was shown to confer resistance to HIV infection ( Dean et al., 1996 ; Samson et al., 1996 ) . Biochemically, this can be explained by the fact that CCR5 is a co-receptor for HIV on the surface of T cells (Dragic et al., 1996 ) . A mutation in another chemokine receptor, CCR2, has also been shown to confer HIV resistance in certain Caucasian populations ( O'Brien and Moore, 2000 ) .",

For example, variation in the NRAMP1/Slc11a1 gene is associated with susceptibility to Leishmania and to specifi c intracellular bacteria such as tuberculosis ( Barton et al., 1999 ; Govoni et al., 1996 ; Lipoldova and Demant, 2006 ; Sebastiani et al., 1998 ) . Mutations in the tumor necrosis factor (TNF) locus, mainly gene promoter mutations, have been linked with malaria and leprosy susceptibility ( Lipoldova and Demant, 2006 ) . Gene promoter or control region mutations have an impact on the level of protein produced from the gene rather than the function of the protein. This is an area of great interest but more diffi cult to study for several reasons, including the inability to identify control regions simply from sequence information and the complexity and fl exibility of transcriptional control. A recent review detailing the genes associated with Leishmania susceptibility describes a number of genes that can affect disease outcome including the interferon-gamma receptor type 1 ( IFNGR1), the interleukin-4 (IL-4 ) gene and the NRAMP-1/Slc11a1 gene ( Lipoldova and Demant, 2006) . These genes and others such as interleukin-12 ( IL-12) and its receptor are also linked with Salmonella and certain mycobacterial infections ( Lipoldova and Demant, 2006 ) . Thus, it is likely that variation in many genes can contribute to disturbing the fi nely balanced tuning of the immune system and lead to an altered response to a pathogen. It is clear from such studies that the same genes may be involved in susceptibility to an array of pathogens indicating a core immune response critical for any pathogen.",

These studies paved the way for the analysis of the host response to a wide variety of infectious agents. The most signifi cant of these studies compared the response of macrophages or DCs to a variety of infectious agents in a single study. In these studies a strong shared response to all infections, be they bacterial, viral or parasitic in nature, was identifi ed. Not only was there commonality from one infectious agent to another but there was also some commonality across cell types. This expression signature has been interpreted as a general \"alarm signal \" for infection (reviewed in [ Jenner and Young, 2005 ] ). Studies of infection with Gram-positive and Gram-negative bacteria also revealed a common expression signature in peripheral blood mononuclear cells. Recently, the Young lab has interrogated all of the publicly available expression profi ling data related to the host response to infection ( Jenner and Young, 2005 ) . The dataset includes 785 experiments in cells ranging from macrophages and DCs to cells of the adaptive immune response, endothelial and epithelial cells and spanning a wide range of infecting agents. This meta-analysis revealed that a \"common host response \" can be detected across all of these cell types and infectious agents and show that although cells such as macrophages and DCs specialize in detecting infection, other cells of the body can mount the same \" alarm response \" as described above ( Figure 107.1 ) .",

It has been long known that interferon-stimulated genes (ISGs) are regulated by virus infection, but it has only recently been recognized that bacteria and other infecting agents can also illicit the interferon response.

            "text": "Not only do these cells change the expression of secreted factors and their receptors during infection but the intracellular milieu is also modifi ed. Once again, there is a common pattern of change observed in all of these studies. The upregulation of signaling and transcription pathways that both augment and attenuate the immune response are observed leading to the interpretation that both positive and negative feedback loops operate within the cell to heighten or dampen the immune response. Temporal profi ling can reveal extra layers of complexity and in one study a pro-infl ammatory profi le followed by an anti-infl ammatory profi le was identifi ed in macrophages activated with LPS ( Wells et al., 2005 ) . Meta-analysis of temporal studies of activation through different TLRs also revealed that the infl ammatory chemokines/cytokine signature was an early response while the ISG response was later, presumably refl ecting the need for an indirect activation of the ISGs through interferon production ( Jenner and Young, 2005 ) . Changes in the expression level of genes involved in both activation and repression of apoptosis also fall under the \"common signature \" banner and this is interpreted as sending the cells into a state of high alert where apoptosis can be either initiated to eliminate infected cells or terminated if the infection resolves ( Jenner and Young, 2005 ) . Although these in vitro studies have provided an overview of the response of isolated cell types to pathogenic infection, in vivo studies are needed to validate any of these results before application to clinical medicine. A number of animal models have been used to profi le the host response to infection with a variety of agents. These studies are complicated especially if whole tissue samples are used in that changes in gene expression can result not only from genuine changes within the cells of the tissue but also from the recruitment especially of immune cells into the infected or infl amed tissue. Nevertheless, in vivo studies have, in some cases, shown good correlation with the expression profi les found from in vitro studies. For example, profi ling the brains of mice infected with virulent Sindbis virus revealed that ISGs as well as infl ammatory chemokines were upregulated ( Johnston et al., 2001 ) and in terms of diagnosis or treatment the exact reason behind these changes in expression signature may be irrelevant. In vivo studies also have some advantages in that the gene expression profi les detected in infected tissues will often make more sense when combined with other physiological or cell biology data from studies of the infected host. Thus an \"infection signature \" would not only describe the altered gene expression of the immune cells that are recruited to the sites of infection but also would include changes in the gene expression of the resident cells of the tissue and may provide a more robust profi le of the infection process for use in diagnostic applications.",

For example, TLR2 is responsible for activation in response to Gram-positive bacteria while TLR4 responds to LPS, a component of Gram-negative bacteria (Beutler and Rietschel, 2003 ; . TLR3 responds to dsRNA and thus dictates the viral immune response for many dsRNA viruses ( Beutler and Rietschel, 2003 ; . Studies using bacterial components such as LPS and fl agellin as well as dsRNA have revealed that each TLR induces a specifi c as well as general transcriptional response. The transcriptional response of macrophages and peripheral blood mononuclear cells is more robust in response to Gram-negative (TLR4) compared with Gram-positive (TLR2) bacteria and the ISG response is considerably reduced for the Gram-positive expression signature ( Boldrick et al., 2002 ; Nau et al., 2002 ) . These differences are further observed when bacterial components are used to activate cells. For example, LPS from Gram-negative bacteria, a specifi c ligand for TLR4, can activate the ISG profi le but TLR2 ligands such as LTA and MDP cannot ( Jenner and Young, 2005) . Not only the activation of specifi c gene sets but also the strength of the specifi c response signature may be important for the immune detection of the type of pathogen involved. E. coli infection of DCs strongly upregulates the chemokines/cytokine infl ammatory cluster whereas infection with infl uenza or other single stranded (ss) RNA viruses (through TLR7) has a weaker ability to regulate this cluster but a stronger ability to regulate the ISG signature ( Huang et al., 2001 ; Lund et al., 2004 ) .",

The rationale behind this combination is twofold: fi rst, expression profi ling data can be used to identify those genes in a chromosomal region previously identifi ed from genetic approaches, whose expression is altered between two different genotypes. These genes then immediately become strong candidates for a susceptibility gene at that genetic locus. In this way, mutations that affect the expression but not the function of a protein can also be identifi ed. Second, expression profi ling combined with genotyping can identify functional pathways that can be affected by a single mutation. For example, if a mutation affects a transcription factor that controls expression of a group of functionally related genes then not only the transcription factor but the entire pathway will be identifi ed opening up better opportunities to design new therapeutics.",

These studies showed that while there was a common core response to TLR4 activation, each strain of mice showed a unique gene expression program implicating many different genetic loci in this variable response. Mapping the genetic loci responsible for these different transcriptional responses will help to shed light on genetic loci that may play a role in human susceptibility to infection.",

In fact there are already some examples of the application of these approaches. A number of studies have been described using oligonucleotide-based arrays for the detection of multiple pathogens in a single experiment (Campbell and Ghazal, 2004 ; Dietel and Sers, 2006 ; Hervas, 2004; Kostrzynska and Bachand, 2006 ; Pompe et al., 2005 ) . Recent studies have investigated the use of expression profi ling of whole blood to determine human subjects at risk of recurrent tuberculosis ( Mistry et al., 2007 ) and to identify high and low responders to lipopolysaccharide ( Wurfel et al., 2005 ) . A study in macaques has used whole blood expression profi ling to examine molecular signatures of infl uenza infection ( Baas et al., 2006 ) . There are many efforts currently to optimize expression profi ling for biomarker discovery and for clinical trials ( Debey et al., 2006; Shou et al., 2005 ; Zheng et al., 2006 ) . There are still many hurdles to be over come in terms of application to the clinical setting including standardization of sample preparation, robustness of the microarray platform and data analysis, cost quality assurance and so on ( Abdullah-Sayani et al., 2006 ) . The introduction of genetic or genomic screening into the clinical setting for infectious disease will no doubt occur in the near future.",
