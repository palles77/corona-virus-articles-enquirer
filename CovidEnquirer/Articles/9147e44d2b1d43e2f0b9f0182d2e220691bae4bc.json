There is growing evidence that L-type lectins are also involved in viral replication. In this study, a novel L-type lectin (named as PcL-lectin) was identified from red swamp crayfish (Procambarus clakii). Gene sequencing and phylogenetic tree analysis results showed that the PcL-lectin was a kind of endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment-53 (ERGIC-53). The expression level of PcLlectin was significantly down regulated in crayfish after challenged with white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). Recombinant PcL-lectin protein facilitated the replication of WSSV in crayfish. In addition, WSSV replication was decreased when endogenous PcL-lectin was knocked down by RNA interference in crayfish. Furthermore, PcL-lectin may interact with VP24, an envelope protein of WSSV. Our results suggest that PcL-lectin may be required for the multiplication of WSSV, and will pave a new way for the developing of strategies against WSSV infection.",

It was earliest discovered in leguminous plants, therefore it was named legume lectin (or L-type lectin). Thereafter, many other members of lectins have been identified in most kinds of organisms, such as fungi, animals and plants. L-type lectins (LTLs) possess a luminal carbohydrate recognition domain which can bind to saccharides. In vertebrates, four kinds of LTLs have been reported, namely endoplasmic reticulum Golgi intermediate compartment-53 (ERGIC-53), ERGIC-53 like protein (ERGL), 36 kDa vesicular integral membrane protein (VIP36), and VIP36 like protein (VIPL) [1] .

WSSV has caused great economic loss in shrimp aquaculture industry worldwide. Up to date, there is lack of effective strategies against WSSV infection. The studies of WSSV replication and host-interactions would help to explore effective strategies for WSSV prevention and control. There is growing evidence that ERGIC-53 is closely related with virus infection. ERGIC-53 is required for the production of infectious arenavirus, coronavirus, and filovirus particles [11] . In the present study, a LTL (named PcL-lectin) was identified from red swamp crayfish, Procambarus clarkii. Gene sequencing and phylogenetic tree analysis results showed that the PcL-lectin was a member of ERGIC-53. The expression level of PcL-lectin was significantly down regulated in crayfish after challenged with white spot syndrome virus (WSSV). The anti-viral properties of the PcL-lectin were further investigated by using recombinant PcL-lectin protein as well as RNA interference (RNAi). Viral proteins which might interact with the PcL-lectin were also studied. The results suggest that PcL-lectin may play an important role in response to WSSV infection in red swamp crayfish.",

One possibility was that PcL-lectin might directly interact with the viral protein, so as to regulate the multiplication of WSSV. Therefore, the interaction of PcL-lectin with WSSV proteins was measured. Six His-tag fused proteins of WSSV (VP15, VP19, VP24, VP26 and VP28) were used in pull-down experiment with GST-tag fused PcL-lectin in vitro. The results showed that only the VP24 could bind to rPcL- Fig. 6 . PcL-lectin knockdown inhibited WSSV in crayfish. The crayfish were subjected to RNA interference with dsGFP as the control. (A and B) Effect of PcL-lectin RNAi on gills determined using qPCR and Western blot analysis. (C)The crayfish were infected with WSSV after PcL-lectin knockdown, and the amount of WSSV was detected via western blot using VP28 as a marker. (D)The rescue experiment was also performed through the injection of rPcL-lectin into the PcL-lectin-silenced and GFP-silenced crayfish; GST-tag was injected into the PcL-lectin-silenced and GFP-silenced crayfish as controls. Different letters represented significant changes between groups, p < 0.05. lectin (Fig. 7A) . A Co-IP assay was also performed using the lysate of the gills from WSSV-challenged crayfish. The results showed that native PcL-lectin was able bind to VP24 (Fig. 7B) . These results suggest that PcL-lectin might physically interact with VP24.",

            "text": "There is growing evidence that the members of lectin family have been involved in virus infection. LdlrLec1 and LdlrLec1 interacted with VP28, and inhibited the infection and replication of WSSV in M. japonicus [24] . MjsvCL, DC-SIGN and L-SIGN were served as receptor candidates in the infection of WSSV or influenza A virus [25, 26] . Lavvy, a kind of CTLs, was response to WSSV infection in Litopenaeus vannamei. MjsvCL together with calreticulin, was identified as a receptor in the infection of WSSV in M. japonicus [25] . However, all these lectins identified from shrimps are all C-type lectins. It has been reported that ERGIC-53 was related with the replication of some RNA viruses, such as arenavirus, coronavirus, and filovirus [11] . To better understand the function of PcL-lectin in crayfish during WSSV infection, recombinant PcL-lectin was further used for the studies. The results showed that recombinant PcL-lectin was able to enhance the multiplication of WSSV in crayfish (Fig. 5) and it could rescues the multiplication of WSSV in the crayfish which their endogenous PcL-lectin was knocked down by RNAi (Fig. 6) , suggesting that PcL-lectin may play a role in the multiplication of WSSV. The PcL-lectin was down regulated in crayfish infected with WSSV at the early stage (Fig. 3) , and recombinant PcL-lectin protein could facilitate WSSV replication (Fig. 5) . The mortality of the crayfish was enhanced 2 d post of the challenge with WSSV [13] . It suggested that WSSV may utilize the PcL-lectin which stored in cell at the early stage of infection. On the other hand, crayfish may also resist WSSV infection by down regulated the expression of PcL-lectin. The reduction of PcL-lectin could not completely suppress the replication of WSSV.",
