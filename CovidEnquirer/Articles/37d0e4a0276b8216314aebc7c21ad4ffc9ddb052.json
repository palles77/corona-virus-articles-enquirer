USP2, a cysteine protease and a member of the ubiquitin specific protease family, is overexpressed in prostate cancer and stabilizes fatty acid synthase, which has been associated with the malignancy of some aggressive prostate cancers. Here, we report the structure of the human USP2 catalytic domain in complex with ubiquitin. Ubiquitin uses two major sites for the interaction with the protease. Both sites are required simultaneously, as shown by USP2 inhibition assays with peptides and ubiquitin mutants. In addition, a layer of ordered water molecules mediates key interactions between ubiquitin and USP2. As several of those molecules are found at identical positions in the previously solved USP7/ ubiquitin-aldehyde complex structure, we suggest a general mechanism of water-mediated ubiquitin recognition by USPs.

            "text": "Posttranslational modification with ubiquitin regulates protein stability and localization and is crucial for homeostasis of eukaryotic cells. In a multistep process involving three classes of enzymes called E1 (ubiquitin activating), E2 (ubiquitin conjugating), and E3 (ubiquitin ligating), an isopeptide bond is formed between the C-terminal group of ubiquitin and a lysine 3-amino group of the targeted protein. Ubiquitination is reversed by a number of proteases that specifically recognize ubiquitinated proteins and remove the ubiquitin tag by hydrolyzing the isopeptide bond. Currently almost 100 putative deubiquitinating proteases (DUBs; or ubiquitin-specific processing proteases UBP) belonging to 5 distinct families are known (Amerik and Hochstrasser, 2004; Nijman et al., 2005) , the majority of which are cysteine proteases, including 4 human ubiquitin C-terminal hydrolyases (UCHs) and 54 human ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs). USPs are multidomain proteases that vary in size and complexity but share a certain degree of homology within their catalytic units, namely within three regions termed the Cys-, His-, and QQD-Box (Quesada et al., 2004) . In most USPs, the catalytic unit is preceded and followed by additional domains that are believed to determine subcellular localization and substrate recognition. Little is known about the physiological function of most human USPs, and specific substrates often remain elusive. A well-studied example is USP7 (HAUSP), which stabilizes both p53 and mdm2, thereby playing an important role in the p53 pathway (Li et al., , 2004 . Several publications describe the structural basis for substrate recognition by USP7 (Hu et al., 2002 (Hu et al., , 2006 Sheng et al., 2006) .",

We suggest a general mode of substrate recognition by USPs, where conserved water molecules mediate interactions between the ubiquitin core (residues 1-71) and the protease. The five C-terminal residues of ubiquitin (Arg72-Leu73-Arg74-Gly75-Gly76) bind into the active site cleft without making covalent interactions with the active site cysteine.

            "text": "Overall Structure of the USP2/Ubiquitin Complex USP2 is reported to exist in several isoforms (http:// merops.sanger.ac.uk/), and it is unclear how these differ in function. The isoforms consist of an N-terminal region of variable length and a 347 amino acid large C-terminal domain. The C-terminal domain possesses the sequence signatures of an USP catalytic domain (Figure 1 ). In the largest isoform, USP2a, the catalytic domain is preceded by 258 amino acids, in the shortest by only 6. We focused our studies on the conserved catalytic domain. For clarity, the construct comprising residues 259-605 will hereon be referred to as USP2. USP2 was produced with high yields as recombinant protein in E. coli, and it cleaved the synthetic substrate ubiquitin-AMC with a catalytic efficiency k cat /K M of 2.6 3 10 5 M 21 s 21 (Table 1) . To facilitate the comparison of key residues, we refer the numbering of USP2 to that of USP7 (Figure 1 ), for which the first USP structure was published (Hu et al., 2002) . *Correspondence: martin.renatus@novartis.com Despite repeated trials with numerous USP2 preparations, we failed to crystallize ligand-free USP2. This might be due to the strong tendency of USP2 to aggre-gate, which is highly accelerated at temperatures below 10 C. Interestingly, complexation of USP2 with ubiquitin-aldehyde (resulting in a covalent complex) or unmodified ubiquitin (resulting in a noncovalent complex) prevented aggregation and yielded crystals that grew overnight. Analysis by SDS-PAGE showed that the crystals contain both protein components, USP2 and ubiquitin (data not shown). Diffraction properties improved significantly upon dehydration of the crystals (Abergel, 2004) , and a data set with 1.85 \u00c5 resolution was obtained. The structure could be solved by molecular replacement with USP7 as search molecule.",

Its overall shape resembles a cupped hand with the approximate dimensions of 35 \u00c5 3 40 \u00c5 3 65 \u00c5 and comprises three domains termed thumb, palm, and fingers ( Figure 2B ), an analogy first used for USP7 (Hu et al., 2002) . The finger domain is formed by a four-stranded b sheet (s1, s2, s4, s7), which is flanked by helix h5 0 . This helix is absent in USP7, while two short strands at the tip of the fingers, present in USP7 (s5 and s6), are missing in USP2 ( Figure 2C ). The thumb is formed by seven helices (h1-h6, including h5 0 ). Compared to USP7, it lacks two additional C-terminal helices (h9 and h10). The palm connects fingers and the thumb and is formed by several b strands and a helices (s3, s8-s14, h7, and h8). Residues 214-229 (Cysbox) and 292-305 (QDE-box) of the thumb, as well as residues 446-486, 477-486, and 512-520 of the palm (His-box), form the active site (Quesada et al., 2004) . The conserved residues Cys223, His464, and Asn481 form the catalytic triad, and Asn218 the oxyanion hole (http://merops.sanger.ac.uk/).

In the complex, 3850 \u00c5 2 of the solventaccessible surface is buried, which corresponds to roughly 40% of the ubiquitin surface. USP2 and ubiquitin have complementary shapes, providing a first structural explanation for the high selectivity of USPs for ubiquitin substrates.",

The corresponding Sg-metal ion distances are 2.46 \u00c5 , 2.38 \u00c5 , 2.40 \u00c5 , and 2.47 \u00c5 , close to the reported ideal distance (2.35 6 0.09 \u00c5 ) for structural zinc binding sites in proteins Ca positions that are in a structural alignment within 1.7 \u00c5 are highlighted by gray boxes. USP2 residues are numbered according to the corresponding USP7 residues; insertion loops in USP2 relative to USP7 are numbered alphabetically. Active-site residues (catalytic triad: Cys223, His464, Asp/Asn481; and oxyanion hole: Asn218) and the four cysteine residues (Cys334, Cys337, Cys381, Cys384) coordinating a metal ion are shown in bold. USP2 residues poorly defined by electron density are underlined. Secondary structure elements are colored as in Figure 2B (thumb, gray; fingers, lime; palm, blue). Forty-seven USP2 residues that are within 4 \u00c5 of ubiquitin are denoted by triangles. Open triangles, interactions with the ubiquitin core (ubiquitin residues 1-71); solid black triangles, interactions with the ubiquitin C terminus (ubiquitin 72-76); solid gray triangles, interactions with both ubiquitin core and C terminus. A consensus sequence, based on the alignment of 54 human USPs (Quesada et al., 2004) and denoted as ''all USP,'' is included in the alignment (bold capital letters, identical in more than 90% of the sequences; capital letters, identical in more than 80% of the sequences; small letters, identical in more than 60% of the sequences). Regions of high sequence conservation within the human USPs are highlighted with boxes: Cys-box (215-229), , and [477] [478] [479] [480] [481] [482] [483] [484] [485] [486] [512] [513] [514] [515] [516] [517] [518] [519] [520] The catalytic domain consists of residues 259-605 of full-length USP2. Secondary structure elements are named according to the USP7 structure (Hu et al., 2002) . The loops connecting h5 and h5 0 as well as s3 and h7 are poorly defined by electron density (see also Figure 1 ) and are therefore omitted from the final model. Dotted lines highlight these gaps. (A) Overall structure of the USP2/ubiquitin complex (blue/orange ribbon). The active-site residues Asn218, Cys223, His464, and Asn481 as well as the metal binding site Cys334, Cys337, Cys381, and Cys384 are shown as sticks, and the zinc ion is shown as a pink sphere. (B) Overall structure of USP2. Secondary elements forming the palm, the fingers, and the thumb are painted in blue, lime, and gray, respectively. Ubiquitin has been omitted for clarity. absent only in USP5, USP7, USP10, USP13, USP14, USP25, USP28, USP34, and USP39. Also the viral protease SARS-CoV PLpro, which has deubiquitinating activity and is structurally similar to human USPs (Ratia et al., 2006) , contains an intact zinc binding site at the homologous position. The two CXXC sequence patterns are mostly separated by approximately 50 residues, although in some cases (e.g., USP4 and USP6), an additional domain of up to 350 amino acids is inserted at this position. Based on the structure of human USP7, it has been predicted that the finger domain of USPs is a zinc ribbon (Krishna and Grishin, 2005) , a structure module that is known to serve as an interaction domain in many proteins. Krishna and Grishin hypothesized that the zinc ribbon domain has been inserted into a papain-like protease domain, the ancestor of USPs, to serve as a scaffold for ubiquitin recognition. In some USPs, including USP7, several of the four cysteine residues have been mutated during evolution, and the zinc binding ability was lost while the fold was maintained. This indicates that a metal binding site is not required for deubiquitinating activity. Therefore, the precise function of the zinc binding site in USP2 and other USPs remains elusive.",

            "text": "The structure shows USP2 in a noncovalent complex with ubiquitin. Ubiquitin uses two sites for the interaction with USP2. Its core (residues 1-71; throughout the paper ubiquitin residues are given in italics, USP2 residues in normal font) binds into the cupped hand contacting residues of all three structural elements, fingers, thumb, and palm, while its five C-terminal residues (72-76) bind into a narrow channel and reach for the active site cysteine ( Figure 2D ). As many as 30 USP2 residues are within 4 \u00c5 of the ubiquitin core. Among those, 12 are engaged in H bond and salt bridge interactions: 5 are found at the tip of the fingers (Ser341, Asp345, Asp371, Asp376, Glu377), involving ubiquitin residues from strands s1 and s2 and from the loop preceding strand s4. The others are located on the thumb (Asp295, Glu298, Arg301, Glu316, Lys407, Thr418) and palm (Leu366), interacting with the ubiquitin residues following strands s1 and s4 and the ones preceding s3. However, for a significant fraction of the total contact area the interactions are indirect, as numerous solvent molecules mediate H bond interactions between ubiquitin backbone and USP2 side chain/backbone atoms ( Figures 2D and 2E ). In total, 25 solvent molecules are located in the region between the tip of the fingers and the thumb, and most of them are lined up along strands s1, s2, and s3 ( Figure 2F ). The C terminus of ubiquitin Arg72-Leu73-Arg74-Gly-75-Gly76 binds with its Gly-Gly motif into a narrow channel reaching for the active site cysteine ( Figure 2D ). The backbone atoms of Leu73, Arg74, and Gly75 form a network of six H bonds with USP2 ( Figure 3A ). The side chain of Arg74 is solvent accessible, while Leu73 binds into a hydrophobic pocket and the guanidinium group of Arg72 interacts with Glu298. No nearby countercharge neutralizes the negative charge of the ubiquitin carboxyl terminus. Instead, three H bond interactions with Cys223N, Asn221Nd2, and Gln293N32 stabilize the C terminus in its conformation. The negative charge of the Gly76 carboxy group does not seem to be well balanced in the complex, especially as the Cys223 Sg atom is most likely deprotonated (see Discussion), leading to electrostatic repulsion between the two negatively charged moieties. Indeed, the side chain of Cys223 seems to exist in two rotamers: a small population adopts the catalytically active conformation, which was observed in the USP7/ubiquitin-aldehyde complex ( Figure 3B ), as suggested by a very weak difference electron density peak. Mostly, Cys223 is rotated by 120 with Sg pointing away from ubiquitin Gly76 and in the direction of Asp482 ( Figure 3B ). The electron density of Asp482 is rather poor, although all neighboring side chains are well defined, indicating increased mobility.",

            "text": "Despite a limited sequence identity of w24%, the overall fold of the USP2 and USP7 catalytic domains is conserved. The two structures superimpose with an rmsd of 1.25 \u00c5 for 262 Ca positions, which corresponds to 75% of the USP2 residues (Figures 1 and 2C) . A similar (A) USP2/ubiquitin complex: the five C-terminal residues of ubiquitin, Leu-Arg-Leu-Gly-Gly, are shown as orange sticks. USP2 side chains that are within 4.0 \u00c5 of the ligand as well as residues Asn218, His464, and Asn481 of the active site are shown as sticks. Putative hydrogen bonds are indicated by yellow dotted lines. (B) Superimposition of the binding region of USP2 (blue) and USP7 (salmon): residues forming the substrate recognition pocket for the ubiquitin C terminus as well as the catalytic Cys223 are shown as sticks. Only USP7 residues that differ from USP2 are labeled. structural identity exists between USP2 and USP14, where 256 Ca positions can be aligned with an rmsd of 1.43 \u00c5 . However, as the USP14/ubiquitin-aldehyde complex (Hu et al., 2005) has been solved at significantly lower resolution than the corresponding complex with USP7 (3.5 \u00c5 versus 2.3 \u00c5 ), we focus in our structural comparison on USP7. Structural elements that directly interact with ubiquitin, namely the base of the fingers and the surroundings of the active site, superimpose especially well, ensuring conservation of ubiquitin binding. Indeed, the 76 ubiquitin Ca positions of the USP2 and USP7 complexes differ with an rmsd of only 0.74 \u00c5 . This high structural similarity shows that the different protocols for the preparation of USP/ubiquitin complexes have no influence on the overall ubiquitin binding mode. Ubiquitin was used for the USP2/ubiquitin complex, while ubiquitin-aldehyde was used for the formation of corresponding USP7 complex. Ubiquitin-aldehyde is a chemically modified form of ubiquitin and highly potent USP inhibitor, where the terminal carboxy group has been reduced to an aldehyde for increased electrophilicity and affinity. In the resulting USP/ubiquitin-aldehyde complex, a covalent bond between inhibitor and protease is formed, representing a classical transition state mimetic for cysteine protease substrate complexes (Westerik and Wolfenden, 1972) . Therefore, the USP7/ubiquitin-aldehyde and the USP14/ubiquitinaldehyde complex structures reveal how USPs stabilize the tetrahedral intermediate (''oxyanion'') that is formed during catalysis. Instead, no covalent bond is formed in the USP2/ubiquitin complex. The structure represents the noncovalent protease/product complex, the last step of peptide cleavage catalyzed by proteases. As such, it can help explain the structural reasons for substrate inhibition, a phenomenon that is observed in this class of enzymes (see below).",

The binding clefts in USP2 and USP7 for the ubiquitin C terminus are almost identical. Only the loop around position 287 adopts different conformations. Of the 20 USP residues that are within 4 \u00c5 of the ubiquitin C-terminal penta-peptide, 14 are conserved, while residues at position 221, 224, 287, 294, 460, and 461 differ in sequence ( Figure 3B ). All of these six amino acid exchanges except for the one at position 221 (Asn in USP2, Ala in USP7) most likely have no influence on the ubiquitin binding. The significance of the exchange at position 221 is difficult to rationalize, especially as this residue is highly conserved in the USP family of proteases. In 42 USPs, including USP2, USP5, and USP14, an asparagine is found at this position, and in only six USPs, including USP7, an alanine is found. In the USP2/ubiquitin complex, Asn221 Nd is in close contact to one oxygen of the Gly76 carboxylate, while Asn218 Nd (''oxyanion hole'') interacts with the second C-terminal oxygen, an interaction similar to the one observed in the USP7/ubiquitinaldehyde complex. Therefore, Asn221 together with Asn218 contributes to the stabilization of the negative charge on the ubiquitin C terminus ( Figure 3A ). In the USP14/ubiquitin-aldehyde complex, where the ubiquitin C terminus is covalently bound to the site cysteine and only one C-terminal oxygen is present, Asn108 (Asn218 in USP2) interacts with the hydroxyl of the thiohemiacetal, while Asn111 (Asn221 in USP2) makes no specific interactions and is rotated away from the active site. This comparison indicates that Asn221 plays a role, not in the stabilization of the transition state during catalysis, but rather in the stabilization of the enzyme product. This way, Asn221 might contribute to product inhibition (see below), and the high conservation of this residue suggests this characteristic is shared by most USPs. Unfortunately, so far, the catalytic properties of only one other member of the USP family, USP5 or isopeptidase T, has been characterized extensively (Stein et al., 1995) . Also, USP5 has an asparagine at the corresponding position and is inhibited by ubiquitin. The question whether USPs, such as USP7, that don't have an asparagine at this position bind ubiquitin with lower affinity and show less substrate inhibition remains open until a detailed enzymatic characterization of these enzymes becomes available.",

To this end, we first generated ubiquitin and three C-terminally truncated mutants (ubiquitin 1-74, ubiquitin 1-73, and ubiquitin 1-72) in E. coli as reagents for enzymatic inhibition assays. The heterologously expressed proteins were characterized by 1 H-NMR spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry, by using endogenous ubiquitin purified from bovine thymus as a reference. The reference sample as well as all recombinant-expressed protein samples unfolded in a cooperative manner with the transition temperatures, Tm, in a similar range. The measured Tm's were 98.3 C (reference sample, endogenous ubiquitin), 91.9 C (ubiquitin), 91.9 C (ubiquitin 1-74), 90.7 C (ubiquitin 1-73), and 98.2 C (ubiquitin 1-72), indicating that the C-terminal truncations have no major influence on protein stability. The 1 H NMR spectra of the endogenous and recombinant ubiquitin are largely identical. In addition, truncated mutants show only minor differences compared to the reference (data not shown). Taken together, these results indicate that heterologous expression of ubiquitin in E. coli yields a properly folded protein and that C-terminal truncations do not disturb the structure of the ubiquitin core. As an additional control experiment, we measured a K i of 0.27 mM for the inhibition of UCH-L3 by ubiquitin with the substrate ubiquitin-AMC. This K i is close to the published value of 0.3 mM (Wilkinson et al., 1999) , which further validates the experimental setup. Next, by using the same assay format, the influence of ubiquitin on the proteolytic activity of USP2 was analyzed. USP2 is inhibited by ubiquitin with a K i of 2.8 mM, which is in the same range as the K i of 3 mM for the related enzyme USP5, also known as isopeptidase T (Dang et al., 1998) . This shows that USP2 binds ubiquitin with significant affinity, and it suggests that product inhibition by ubiquitin is a general feature of the USP family of proteases. The biological significance of product inhibition is unknown. It might play a role in the regulation of USP activity, as with increasing intracellular ubiquitin concentration the deubiquitinating activity might be reduced. Yet, such an inhibition will only be observed if the concentration of free ubiquitin is in the same range as the K d for the interaction between ubiquitin and the protease.",

To determine the contribution of each binding site to the total affinity, we analyzed the two binding events independently. The contribution of the C-terminal peptide was assessed by measuring the Michealis-Menten parameters for two peptidic AMC substrates, consisting of the last five and nine ubiquitin C-terminal residues, respectively. Neither of the substrates is cleaved by USP2 under the assay conditions (Table 1) . This observation does not result from an unfavorable substrate conformation, as UCH-L3 is able to cleave both Ac-RLRGG-AMC and Ac-HLVLRLRGG-AMC, although with significantly lower catalytic efficiency compared to ubiquitin-AMC, but rather indicates that substrates do not bind to USP2. This interpretation is further supported by an additional inhibition experiment showing that the C-terminal peptide Ac-HLVLRLRGG has no effect on the proteolytic activity of USP2 (Table 2 ). Next, the contribution of the ubiquitin core to the total binding affinity was analyzed. The truncation mutants ubiquitin 1-72 and 1-73 affect the proteolytic activity of USP2 only marginally even at the highest inhibitor concentration used (Figure 4) , indicating that the K i for these mutants is significantly higher then 100 mM. In summary, our data show that the ubiquitin core and the ubiquitin C terminus alone bind USP2 very weakly with affinities at best in the high micromolar range, while full-length ubiquitin inhibits USP2 with a K i of 2.8 mM.",

            "text": "USP2 is one of 54 human members of the family of ubiquitin-specific proteases (USPs). USPs belong to the clan CA of papain-like proteases (http://merops.sanger.ac. uk/), which are characterized by catalytic residues in the order Cys, His, Asp/Asn in sequence, with the active site cysteine located at the beginning of a central a helix. Despite large sequence and structural divergence among the different representatives of this clan, the residues of the catalytic triad superimpose well (Johnston et al., 1997; Hu et al., 2002) . Therefore, it has been suggested that members of clan CA share the catalytic mechanism with the active site cysteine and histidine residues forming a thiolate-imidazolium ion pair (Storer and Menard, 1994) . Mutagenesis studies on USP7 (Hu et al., 2002) corroborate the importance of these residues for the catalytic activity of USPs. Yet, USPs differ fundamentally from other papain-like proteases as they require ubiquitin to reach full catalytic activity. While USP5 cleaves ubiquitin-derivatized substrates at rates close to diffusion control, short peptidic substrates containing the C-terminal residues of ubiquitin are turned over at significantly lower rates (Stein et al., 1995) . In addition, ubiquitin binds to and inhibits USP5. The structures of USP7 in the absence and presence of ubiquitin-aldehyde gave a first structural explanation for the high substrate selectivity of USPs (Hu et al., 2002) . Only when ubiquitin is bound does the enzyme adopt a catalytic-competent conformation. In the absence of ubiquitin, active-site residues and residues delineating the substrate binding sites are misaligned. Yet, as the structural rearrangements are restricted to the vicinity of the active site, where the C-terminal residues Residual enzymatic activity was determined at 22 C with ubiquitin-AMC as substrate. The relative activity (v i /v o ) is plotted against the inhibitor concentration. From these data, the corresponding K i s were deduced as described in the Experimental Procedures section.",

At first sight, these results suggest that the core of ubiquitin and not its C terminus are required for the binding to USP2. Consequently, the main contribution for the binding affinity results from interactions between the ubiquitin core (residues 1-71) and the USP2 fingers and palm domains. To test this hypothesis, several C-terminal-truncated ubiquitin mutants were analyzed in USP2 inhibition assays. While ubiquitin inhibits USP2 with a K i of 2.8 mM, mutants lacking residues Arg74-Gly75-Gly76 or Leu73-Arg74-Gly75-Gly76 affect the proteolytic activity of USP2 only marginally even at the highest inhibitor concentration. In summary, the interactions between the ubiquitin core and the fingers/palm as well as the one between the ubiquitin C terminus and the active site cleft are very weak, and both interactions are required simultaneously for ubiquitin binding. The weak affinities of the C-terminal ubiquitin peptides together with the methods available in the kinetic analysis do not allow the determination of the exact K i values for the inhibition of USP2. Therefore, it remains unknown whether the binding to the two low-affinity sites is cooperative or purely additive. Yet, cooperative binding seems likely: based on the analogy to USP7, we assume that prior to ligand binding, the active site of USP2 is in a catalytically incompetent conformation. In this conformation, the two active-site residues cysteine and histidine are too far apart to form a catalytic diad, and the substrate binding site at the catalytic center is absent. When ubiquitin binds to USP2, its core is recognized by the cupped hand. This interaction aligns the ubiquitin C terminus into the right orientation and register, so that it can bind to the active site cleft and induce the active conformation of the enzyme. Isolated C-terminal fragments cannot be prealigned. Therefore they bind with very low affinity and are unable to induce an active conformation. For the design of low molecular weight active-sitedirected inhibitors of USP2, these findings suggest that, in order to gain potency, the ligand has to bind in such an induced-fit binding mode. This might only be achievable if the inhibitor spans both interaction sites.",

This suggests that the two C-terminal ubiquitin residues make no significant net contribution to the USP2/ubiquitin interaction. This is surprising, as, in the USP2/ubiquitin complex structure, the Gly75-Gly76 dipeptide binds into a narrow channel formed by the highly conserved residue Gln293 and is engaged in five potential H bond interactions. A possible explanation is the chargecharge repulsion between the negatively charged Gly76 carboxylate and the Cys223 Sg, which we assume to be negatively charged based on the analogy to papain (see above). This repulsion leads to the observed reorientation of Cys223 and the destabilization of the protease/ligand complex. By contrast, in a putative USP2/ubiquitin 1-74 complex, the distance between the two negative charges is increased by at least 7 \u00c5 . At this distance, the repulsion between the ubiquitin C terminus and the USP2 active-site cysteine is reduced.

            "text": "The principles of protein-protein interactions and the role of water molecules in molecular recognition have been studied by various groups (Janin, 1997; Jones and Thornton, 1996; Larsen et al., 1998) . ''Wet'' protein-protein interfaces where a large fraction of interactions are water mediated are not uncommon but are less abundant then complexes where the contact interface is largely dehydrated (Janin, 1997) . For example, water-mediated interactions have been reported for the L-arabinose binding protein (Quiocho et al., 1989) , the barnase-barstar complex (Buckle et al., 1994) , and the Streptomyces griseus protease B-ovomucid complex (Huang et al., 1995) . The contribution of water-mediated interactions to the binding affinity is difficult to assess both experimentally and theoretically (Rodier et al., 2005) . In general, hydrophobic interactions are tighter than polar interactions (Tsai et al., 1997) , while watermediated and direct polar interactions are believed to be of similar strength (Rodier et al., 2005) . The USP2ubiquitin interface in the area of the ubiquitin core (1-71) appears to be less hydrophobic than protease-inhibitor interfaces in general. This is no surprise, as ubiquitin has to dissociate from USP2 once it is cleaved off its target protein and should not act as a tight inhibitor. In the USP-ubiquitin complexes, the solvent molecules fill parts of the cavity formed at the protein-protein interface and act as a coating that prevents the two molecules from interacting directly. They provide specific, conserved interaction sites. We hypothesize that this mode of substrate recognition is common to all USPs and that mediating water molecules will also be found in other USP/ubiquitin complexes.",
