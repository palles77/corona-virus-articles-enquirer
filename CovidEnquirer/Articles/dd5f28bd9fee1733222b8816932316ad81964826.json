In both groups of animals, disease started 3 to 4 days after T cell transfer with inflammation, which was most pronounced in the lumbar spinal cord. The peak of disease and inflammation was reached on day 6 and declined during the following days. CNS inflammation was characterised by T cell infiltration associated with pronounced microglial activation and peripheral blood monocyte/macrophage recruitment, as shown before in bone marrow chimeric animals [12] . Clinical disease was mainly associated with axonal injury, whereas demyelination was sparse [1] . Animals recovered completely between day 12 and 15 and pathology at this time point revealed only few perivascular inflammatory infiltrates. In the present study, lumbar spinal cord tissue was analysed 6 and 12 days after T cell transfer.",

To test its potential pathogenic role for demyelination and neurodegeneration in the respective animal models, we concentrated on lesions with inflammation, mediated by different components of the immune system and on lesions with active demyelination or axonal and neuronal injury. Since in individual animals such lesions are present in variable incidence in the chronic stage of the disease, we selected from a much larger pool of animals and tissue blocks those, which still showed signs of active demyelination (for definition see below) or axonal injury, determined by the presence of axons with accumulation of amyloid precursor protein as a sign of acutely impaired fast axonal transport. As active lesions in these animals occur side by side with inactive lesions this sampling strategy also allowed to compare different lesion stages, such as initial lesions, classical active lesions and inactive lesions. Thus, our selection strategy for further detailed analysis was based on the presence of the entire pathological spectrum of different lesion stages rather than on the time points after disease induction.",

Furthermore, early active lesions were surrounded by a rim of microglia activation, only few of them containing sparse myelin protein-reactive intra-cytoplasmic granules (initial lesions, [15] ). These lesions showed initial stages of demyelination and oligodendrocyte apoptosis (prephagocytic lesions; [3] ). Late active lesions contained macrophage inclusions reactive for major myelin proteins, such as myelin basic protein or proteolipid protein. In later stages of lesion development, myelin proteins were degraded in macrophages, which were still abundantly present in the lesions but only contained lipid remnants of myelin. Completely inactive lesions were sharply demarcated from the surrounding normal appearing white matter and showed complete demyelination and astrocytic scaring in the absence of macrophages with myelin degradation products.

Thus, each lesion was classified by at least 4 to 5 investigators. Active inflammatory demyelinating lesions in experimental rodent models showed a lesion architecture, which was comparable to that in human MS lesions, and thus allowed to apply the same criteria for lesional staging.
