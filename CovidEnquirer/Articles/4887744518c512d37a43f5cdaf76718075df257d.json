Meeting sessions covered aspects of the epidemiology, diagnosis, molecular and structural biology, vaccine development, and antiviral drug discovery for emerging RNA viruses that are current threats in Africa and included flaviviruses (dengue and Zika), alphaviruses (chikungunya), coronaviruses, filoviruses (Ebola), influenza viruses, Crimean Congo hemorrhagic fever virus, Rift Valley fever Virus, Lassa virus, and others. Data were presented on recent flavivirus and/or chikungunyavirus outbreaks in Angola, Burkina Faso, and Mozambique. In addition, these viruses are endemic in many sub-Saharan countries. The TASW series on emerging viruses is unique in Africa and successful in promoting collaborations between researchers in Africa and other parts of the world, as well as among African scientists. This report summarizes the lectures held at the meeting and highlights advances in the field.",

This is all the more of a problem as African virologists only rarely have the opportunity to attend conferences on emerging viruses in Europe, Asia, or North America. As a result, knowledge about the occurrence of new viruses in Africa is limited, unless there is a major outbreak. For example, the prevalence of dengue virus (DENV) infections in African countries has been barely studied, and it is not known with certainty whether Zika virus (ZIKV) infection of pregnant women in Africa is connected with the risk of microcephaly of the child (as was the case in the 2015-2016 ZIKV epidemic in Central and South America). Furthermore, while African virologists are generally well experienced in diagnostics and epidemiology, knowledge of the molecular biology of emerging RNA viruses is often lacking.",

In the absence of an efficient and safe vaccine against important flaviruses such as DENV1-4 and ZIKV, the investigation of antiviral compounds is crucial for public health. The NS5, a large multifunctional enzyme with two active sites, i.e. the methyltransferase and the RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) sites, is considered a major drug target for antiviral compounds (Lim et al., 2016) . The active sites of the NS5 protein are located in the N-terminal and the C-terminal domains, respectively, with allosteric regulation between these two sites. Julien also presented unpublished results on the structure of the full-length NS5 from DENV2 and inhibitor design targeting the Npocket of the RdRp from ZIKV.",

They first determined a crystal structure for E from ZIKV (Dai et al., 2016) that shows a typical class-II viral fusion protein [as originally defined by (Lescar et al., 2001) ]. They selected mAb 2A10G6 that targets the evolutionary-conserved fusion loop (fl) of E for further structural and functional characterization. mAb 2A10G6 can partially protect against a lethal challenge of ZIKV infection and its crystal structure was analyzed . Following humanization, 2A10G6 could be a candidate for immunotherapy. In the second part of his talk, Lianpan presented a chimpanzee adenovirus-based candidate vaccine against ZIKV (Xu et al., 2018) . The rationale for using the chimpanzee adenovirus was to take advantage of the low pre-existing immunity against the carrier in the human population (in contrast to human adenovirus). Adenovirus type 7 was engineered to express the ZIKV M and E proteins. A single vaccination elicited potent neutralizing mAbs and achieved sterilizing immunity in mice (Xu et al., 2018) . Further assays using a non-human primate model of the disease are planned using this candidate vaccine.",

Interestingly, three antibodies isolated from a single patient also demonstrated potent neutralizing activities against DENV1-4, which is in line with results reported on other antibodies (Barba-Spaeth et al., 2016; Tharakaraman et al., 2018) . In time-of-addition experiments, these investigators found that the three antibodies provided protection to mice when administered after infection by ZIKV. The epitopes recognized by these mAbs were analyzed by structural studies and found to correspond to tertiary epitopes (contributed by non-contiguous segments in the sequence of the polypeptide chain) . While the use of a single mAb could not prevent the appearance of virus escape mutants, growing the ZIKV in cell culture in the presence of the three antibodies overcame this issue. In addition, a tri-specific mAb was constructed to present all three antibody binding sites within a single protein construct. Questions were raised by the audience as to the cost and applicability of the approach in a clinical setting, although it was agreed that this strategy was promising. This information will be useful to help the design of vaccines because it provides a mapping at the molecular level of epitopes bound by broadly neutralizing antibodies. Antibodies elicited by vaccine candidates can be compared to these pools of antibodies for their ability to confer protection against challenges by the virus.",

            "text": "Susan Weiss (University of Pennsylvania, Philadelphia, PA, USA) gave an account of the unique mechanism by which ZIKV resists the antiviral effects of the oligoadenylate synthetase/ribonuclease (OAS/ RNase L) pathway (Banerjee et al., 2014) . Her group demonstrated that ZIKV activated the antiviral OAS/RNase L pathway, which dramatically reduced ZIKV genomic RNA expression. While increased viral genome expression in RNase L knock-out (KO) cells compared to wild-type (WT) suggests RNase L-mediated cleavage of the ZIKV genome, knockout of OAS or RNase L genes surprisingly failed to enhance ZIKV replication compared to that in WT cells. Moreover, they observed a modest but significant decrease in ZIKV replication in RNase-L KO cells compared to WT. In contrast to these findings with ZIKV, both the flavivirus DENV, as well as the alphavirus Sindbis replicated to significantly higher titers in RNase-L KO cells compared to WT cells, demonstrating a strong antiviral function carried out by activated RNase L during infection with other viruses. In addition, poly(IC)-mediated activation of RNase L prior to ZIKV infection reduced replication in WT but not RNase-L KO cells, suggesting a mechanism of ZIKV evasion of RNase L during early infection, in which a viral genome reservoir is likely established and protected from RNase L cleavage, allowing for sufficient viral replication. They further found that ZIKV replication factories (RFs) containing viral transcription/replication complexes and dsRNA were more concentrated in their characteristic perinuclear localization in WT cells or in OAS3 KO cells [expressing RNase L but unable to activate RNase L ] as compared to RNase-L KO cells, implying a non-catalytic role for RNase L in supporting ZIKV replication. These data are consistent with a previous report that RNase L interacts with cytoskeleton components and may perform a nonenzymatic role during infection (Malathi et al., 2014) . In summary, Susan proposed that RNase L plays a dual role in ZIKV infectionits canonical antiviral role in degrading viral genomes, as observed with other viruses, and a proviral role currently unique to ZIKV in maintaining optimal virus replication factories.",

            "text": "The availability of reliable and reproducible assays for both diagnosis and surveillance plays a significant role in emerging diseases. Consequently, there is a task for commercial suppliers of providing validated assays and for individual laboratories of developing in-house assays. In this session, Claudia Ohst from EUROIMMUN South Africa gave a presentation on serological arbovirus diagnostics that are available from the company. For many arboviruses, the duration of viremia is relatively short, and serological assays that can detect specific IgG and IgM responses are therefore especially important for the laboratory confirmation of infections. EUROIMMUN provides a broad range of serological assays, either based on ELISA or on immunofluorescence platforms using the BIOCHIP technology. The presentation focused on the development of assays to support diagnostics in the recent outbreak of ZIKV in South and Central America. ELISAs for arboviruses are most frequently based on recombinant antigens. This may in some instances implicate serological crossreactivity. In the case of ZIKV reagents, a recombinant NS1 antigen was produced for the EUR-OIMMUN ELISA. Based on results obtained from five different groups that screened clinical serum samples from patients with various flavivirus infections, the specificity of the anti-ZIKV IgG and IgM ELISA ranged from 98.7% to 100% (Borena et a., 2017; Granger et al., 2017; Huzly et al., 2016; Kadkhoda et al., 2017; Steinhagen et al., 2016) . In patients with suspected ZIKV infection with the so-called \"original antigenic sin phenomenon, due to a pre-existing antibody response from a previous exposure to another flavivirus, IgM responses to a second and different flavivirus infection may not be detected (Steinhagen et al., 2016) . There is some evidence that using combined anti-IgA and IgM tests may resolve this problem and can be applied to identify a recent infection (Steinhagen et al., 2016) .",

RT-RPA does not require specialized equipment and can be performed at one temperature using a basic water bath or heating block, hence these assays may have important applications in low-resource settings or in field work. Briefly, a conserved region of the NS5 gene of flaviviruses was targeted and, to determine the application of the assay, primers and probes were initially designed for West Nile virus (WNV). As culturing WNV requires higher biocontainment than available at the facility, RNA was transcribed from a synthetic gene. The transcribed RNA was used to optimize the reaction conditions. Products of the assay were then detected using a lateral flow system. A biotin molecule conjugated to the 5\u2032 end of the probe was used in the reaction specifically to facilitate detection of the products using lateral flow strips that encompassed anti-biotin molecules. The sensitivity of the assay was investigated using ten-fold dilutions of transcribed RNA of known copy number. The minimum detection level was between 5.4 and 54 copies of RNA, in concordance with the results from a conventional RT-PCR reaction. In addition, the specificity of the assay was determined by testing RNA from other flaviviruses or other arboviruses known to circulate in South Africa or imported by travellers. The assay was unable to detect RNA from Sindbis virus, Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus (CCHFV), yellow fever virus or Wesselsbron virus. The assay did detect RNA from Usutu virus; however, this was expected due to the sequence similarity. As the aim is to finally develop a multiplex assay for all flaviviruses in southern Africa, this cross-reactivity will be an advantage. Hence, the results confirmed that an RT-RPA can be simply performed at one temperature with rapid detection of products using a lateral flow system.",

Coinciding with the outbreak, potential breeding and adult resting sites were sampled indoors and outdoors, in peri-urban and urban districts. The most abundant mosquito was Aedes aegypti with individuals exhibiting a wide range of variation in the morphological characters associated with the aegypti and formosus forms of this species. Sub-samples were analyzed to identify blood meal sources and mutations affecting insecticide susceptibility. The results showed that Aedes aegypti was highly anthropophilic, with both endo-and exophilic tendencies. Adult mosquitoes were resistant to pyrethroid insecticides, but adults and larvae were susceptible to organophosphates. The results provide a much-needed initial evidence base, essential for the development of vector control strategies prior to future outbreaks of Aedes aegypti-borne arboviruses in Burkina Faso. giving an overview of the epidemiology and pathogenesis of the reemergent CHIKV. She then discussed the molecular mechanisms of alphavirus entry and exit. Alphaviruses including CHIKV and encephalitic viruses are important human and animal pathogens. They are highly organized, enveloped viruses with an internal nucleocapsid containing the plus-sense RNA surrounded by the viral membrane containing an external lattice of the E2 and E1 transmembrane proteins. Virus replication occurs in the cytoplasm and the envelope is derived during budding via a process mediated by the E2 protein and capsid protein interactions and excluding host membrane proteins. Many questions remain, such as how the capsid protein selectively assembles with the viral RNA and the mechanism of viral budding (Brown et al., 2018) . Alphaviruses can infect cells as free virus particles or they can be transmitted from infected cells via intercellular \"extensions\" (Martinez and Kielian, 2016) . The extensions are induced by virus infection of the host cell or by expression of the viral structural proteins in the absence of infection. The process of cell-to-cell transmission requires budding of fusion-active viral particles that are transferred to neighboring noninfected cells. These extensions involve the reorganization of the actin and microtubule systems, and can protect the virus from neutralization by host antibodies.",

An example of repurposing was favipiravir, developed as an antiviral against influenza, and acting broadly on viral RNA-dependent RNA polymerases (RdRp). Favipiravir produced strong inhibition of acute CHIKV replication in both cell culture and a mouse model, and acted on nsP4, the viral RdRp. In contrast, no effect in a mouse model of chronic infection was observed, with the results suggesting that in these chronic conditions, either replication and/or the viral RNA was defective (Delang et al., 2016) .

In spite of the strong conservation among the nsP1 proteins, the compound showed surprising specificity against CHIKV nsP1 vs. nsP1 of other alphaviruses.

A myxobacterial metabolite, soraphen A (SorA), was found to be a broadspectrum antiviral that inhibits acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase and thus affects host-cell lipid metabolism. SorA inhibits formation of the \"membranous web\", a cellular structure that is generated during and serves as a platform for replication of RNA viruses. Studies showed that SorA inhibits replication of hepatitis C virus (HCV), human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), and DENV (Koutsoudakis et al., 2015; Fleta-Soriano et al., 2017) . A second natural product shown to have broad antiviral activity was the lantibiotic peptide labyrinthopeptin A1 (LabyA1; F\u00e9rir et al., 2013) . This molecule displays broad antiviral activity against enveloped viruses including flaviviruses and CHIKV. LabyA1 interacts with phosphatidyl ethanolamine in the viral membrane, leading to perforation and virucidal effects. In contrast, cells are relatively resistant to LabyA1, presumably due to decreased accessibility of PE in the cell vs. viral membrane, as well as the ability of cells to carry out membrane repair. It will be interesting to further define the mechanisms of these two antiviral compounds and to explore their ability to act as antivirals in vivo.",

Her laboratory focuses on the antiviral 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligoadenylate synthetase -ribonuclease L (OAS-RNase L) pathway. RNase L is activated by double-stranded (ds) RNA and cleaves host and viral single-stranded RNA and thus downregulates protein synthesis and viral replication. The group demonstrated that accessory protein NS2 of mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), as well as that of other lineage A betacoronaviruses, is a cytoplasmic protein that displays a 2\u2032,5\u2032-oligo(A) phosphodiesterase (PDE) activity that prevents RNase L activation (Zhao et al., 2012; Goldstein et al., 2017) .

In contrast to NS2, NS4b is mainly localized to the nucleus, suggesting a further enzymatic role in that compartment. This is supported by the finding that MERS-CoV mutant viruses expressing either a catalytically inactive NS4b or NS4b expressed in the cytoplasm display similar phenotypes with regard to replication and upregulation of interferon-lambda and interferon-stimulated gene expression. In addition, these data point to a catalytic role for NS4b in the nucleus.

Current knowledge relates conformational changes of the spike protein and exposure of the fusion peptide to low endosomal pH allowing both viruses to enter the cytosol. However, it has become clear that increasing the calcium concentration within endosomes also correlates with infection with both viruses. Susan described how calcium stabilizes the structure of the fusion peptide during conformational changes of the spike and promotes its insertion into the host-cell membrane. Furthermore, her data showed that, as the calcium concentration is increased, lipid ordering increases as well as membrane fusion activity. Higher fusogenic activity linked to higher infection rates are observed in the presence of higher calcium levels.",

The rationale for this approach is that virulent human CoVs have infected relatively small numbers of people and drugs that will inhibit enteroviruses as well as CoVs, will be commercially more viable because of the large numbers of enterovirus infections. This approach is possible due to similarities between the substrate-binding sites of enterovirus 3C and CoV main proteases (Hilgenfeld, 2014) . Rolf and his colleagues are employing structure-based design of peptidomimetic alpha-ketoamides to be tested as inhibitors for the 3C proteases of Coxsackievirus B3 (CVB3) and enterovirus A71, as well as the main proteases of SARS-CoV and HCoV-NL63. Differences in the S2 pocket among these four enzymes present a challenge to the design of a common inhibitor. Thus far, the best inhibitors have a P2 = cyclopentylmethyl or cyclohexylmethyl moiety, and display low-or submicromolar EC 50 values against all three types of viruses in cell culture.

This was probably due to patients moving to Freetown from all parts of the country, in hope of receiving better treatment. As a result, Freetown played a substantial role in maintaining and perpetuating the outbreak in Sierra Leone.",

The former targets may offer a larger potential for yielding broad-spectrum antivirals, may reduce the problem of resistance development by the virus, and the compounds may already be available and only need repurposing. Potential disadvantages of antivirals targeting host proteins include toxicity and collateral effects due to differences between the distribution of the target and the location of the infection, lack of a complete understanding of the target biology, difficulty to develop an assay or to establish a pharmacokinetics/pharmacodynamics (PK/PD) relationship, and often an unclear and risky regulatory pathway. The opposite is true for direct-acting antivirals: they are less prone to exhibit toxicity based on target, and it is generally easier to build assays and establish PK/PD, the regulatory pathway is usually clearer, but they may lead to development of viral resistance, and depending on structure, may have a limited scope in terms of addressable virus families.",

Her group collected a total of 2132 sera from backyard poultry between 2009 and 2010 and found 8.0% of sera positive for avian influenza type A viruses. The positive sera were further tested for the H5 and H7 subtype viruses, and all of them were negative. As a highlypathogenic H5N8 outbreak was confirmed in birds in some Southern African Development Community (SADC) countries including the DRC, Zimbabwe, and South Africa, the Veterinary Authority of Mozambique decided to suspend the importation and movement of poultry and poultry products from these affected regions. They also introduced intensive clinical examination and surveillance in larger poultry industries and targeted farms which had imported day-old bird and hatching eggs from infected countries prior to the outbreak. No clinical symptoms were reported. A total of 249 swab samples were tested by qRT-PCR for H5N8 virus and all of them were negative.

They confirmed that the Q226L and G228S amino-acid substitutions are pivotal for the shift in receptor binding, resulting in human receptorbinding features similar to the pandemic H2 and H3 .

The budding activity of the Togo strain Z protein could be enhanced by co-expression of the nucleoprotein NP, whereas NP had no effect on Josiah virus budding.
