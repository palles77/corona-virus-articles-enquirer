            "text": "This paper critically examines the ways that tuberculosis (TB) has been represented in the print media in New Zealand over recent years (2002)(2003)(2004). Our broad contention is that, notwithstanding its biomedical reality, TB is socially constructed by, and through, human experience. Further, public health practitioners depend, to a large extent, on the media to alert the public to threats of disease and opportunities for protection. However, the messages conveyed are sometimes neither helpful nor accurate. In our analysis of TB coverage in three major daily newspapers in New Zealand, we enumerate and classify references to the disease, as well as undertake a discursive analysis of the revealed themes. Of the 366 texts we retrieved in the database search, we selected 120 for in-depth analysis. Our examination indicated the importance of bovine TB within the national consciousness, the stigmatised character of TB and the association between TB and immigrants. We observe that newspaper 'stories' in general, and commentaries by public health officials in particular, are invariably offered on a 'case by case' basis. We conclude that this specificity in time and place avoids more challenging discourses linking TB with deeply embedded determinants of health such as the strong link between TB and poverty. r",

Both forms of dissemination can result in the print media granting a prominence to medical matters that is seldom matched by the attention afforded to wider determinants of health (Friedman, 2004) . In this regard, media focus on biomedical issues reflects societal preoccupations with allocation of the 'vast majority' of funding for health research to biomedical work, 'despite the fact that a complex interplay of factors influences vulnerability and resistance to disease' (Institute of Medicine, 2006, p. 18) . In this paper, we focus on media representations of tuberculosis (TB) which continues to be one of the world's most formidable public health problems, despite the availability of effective treatment since the 1950s. Approximately one-third of the world's population is infected with the TB bacillus and an estimated 2,000,000 people die from the disease each year (WHO, 2005) .",

As part of a larger research project examining TB in New Zealand (Farmer, Herring, Littleton, & Park, 2007) , this paper analyses representations and discourses of TB within the major daily newspapers in New Zealand's three largest cities. Given the highly politicised environment of infectious disease, we ask 'how is the New Zealand print media shaping discourse about TB, especially in terms of privileging biomedical domains and individualizing and racialising the disease? ' Like HIV and many other infectious diseases before it, TB is replete with meaning. The changing ways in which TB and people living with it have been portrayed in literature and news media have shaped the cultural meanings associated with this disease. These meanings, in turn, have the capacity to affect how TB is experienced (e.g. as a disease of the literati, or of the impoverished poor) (Bryder, 1988) . As Lichtenstein (1996) commented in her review of AIDS iconography in the New Zealand media, stories about disease draw on pre-existing stereotypes, but can in turn reshape or challenge them. This view that disease shapes and is shaped by human experience draws from a constructionist premise that knowledge is socially constructed and shaped by wider cultural, temporal and political factors. Additionally, this view contends that language is not merely a neutral means of communication but performs ideological work.",

Indeed many settlers suffering from TB had come from Britain to the colony specifically in the hope that the latter's climate would cure them (Bryder, 1996) . Once it was established that TB was an infectious disease (1882), attempts were made by the government to restrict the entry of those suffering from it, although this was implemented in a relatively haphazard way. Early 20th century measures to combat TB followed overseas models, particularly Britain. These measures were based on the belief that fresh air, good food, exercise and rest were effective preventive and curative agents against the disease. BCG vaccination was developed in France in 1921, but, like Britain, New Zealand did not adopt it until after the Second World War (Bryder, 1999) .",

These methods included mass miniature radiography for early detection, BCG vaccination, and effective drugs, starting with streptomycin, developed in 1943. The Department of Health set up a Division of Tuberculosis in 1943, indicating a more proactive approach. From the 1950s to 1960s, TB was declining and it was believed that the problem would soon be 'conquered'. In 1969, 44% of all TB notifications were among Pacific Island peoples (Bryder, 1991) and in the 1970s, the Director-General of Health identified a new problem-the excessive proportion of cases occurring in immigrant populations. Much debate followed as to whether migrants brought the disease with them, or contracted it here because of their poor living conditions. TB has long been known as a disease of poverty, and with the downturn in the New Zealand economy in the latter part of the 20th century, the incidence increased, particularly among lower socioeconomic groups, notably Maori and Pacific Island peoples, though rates remained far below the 1950s levels (Bryder, 1991) .",

Thomas and Ellis-Pegler (1997) reviewed all the cases of HIV co-infection seen at Auckland Hospital in the 11 years preceding their study and demonstrated that co-infection remains a minor feature of the epidemiology of TB. However, in a more recent publication Thomas and Ellis-Pegler (2006) confirm these continuing low rates of both HIV co-infection and MDR TB in New Zealand, but point out that with increased rates of HIV in Asia and some parts of the Pacific which have a high prevalence of TB infection, co-infected population groups as well as those with MDR TB may well become more numerous in New Zealand in the future.",

Klovdahl et al., 2001) . The attitudes and beliefs of those infected as well as their families and their communities influence treatment-seeking. In addition, socio-economic aspects of their daily lives (e.g. mobility, unemployment) affect the ease of their treatment-seeking and their accessibility to control measures.

This is especially so when attention is turned to diseases such as TB which are experienced by relatively few people but which are potent signifiers (e.g. through the deployment of tropes such as 'third world diseases'). Potentially, at least, the media constitutes an important vehicle through which to convey the messages embedded in health policy documents (Hayes et al., 2007) . We build on earlier studies of the portrayal of health and health care issues in the media (Joseph & Kearns, 1999; Seale, 2004) and use newspaper reports to focus on coverage of TB. We acknowledge that these discourses may contrast with those obtained from, for example, interviews with clinicians, nurses, patients and family members working with TB and reviews of the academic literature (e.g. Farmer et al., 2007) .",

            "text": "In using the term 'discourse', we acknowledge the diversity of meanings attached to it (Hay, 2005) . Nonetheless, we follow Lupton (1992) in regarding discourse as a set of ideas or a patterned way of thinking which can be discerned within texts and identified within wider social structures. A discourse analytic approach regards language and meaning as social constructs. Using this approach to interpret media reports builds on the idea that readers are 'active agents' co-creating meaning with the writer. By considering the context and intended audience of news texts researchers are concerned about the effects of the media on what people may do or think. Thus, there is an acknowledgment that there is power within texts that have their sources beyond the texts themselves. The discourses that are constituted and circulated by newspapers can be regarded as functioning to produce what Foucault (1980) calls particular understandings about the world that are accepted as 'truth' (Waitt, 2005) . In the course of promulgating such 'truths' the media as a collective and commercial institution is implicated in 'governing populations'. In other words, the power of the media can (directly or indirectly) influence the conduct of its audiences (Rose, 1990 ). Lupton's (1992) challenge that discourse analysis was under-utilized in public health has been partially addressed by a number of more recent studies. Four themes have been raised by this work. First, coverage tends to be predominantly conservative, giving greater voice to elite rather than less powerful groups, and to men rather than women (Lupton, 1995) . Second, the media tends to individualise illness rather than place it in its broader socio-economic and political contexts (Lupton, 1995) . Third, the need for medical management and a related theme of fear is common (e.g. Shoebridge & Steed, 1999) . Fourth, efforts to counterbalance claims contesting medical power (e.g. anti-immunisation) frequently involve reframing the underlying ideological appeals (Leask & Chapman, 1998) . Our research asks whether Lupton's findings are born out in newspaper treatment of TB in New Zealand during our study period.",

The New Zealand Herald is Auckland-based (circulation approx. 200,000; weekly readership: 1 million) (APN, 2006) . The Dominion Post emerged from the merger of the capital Wellington's two daily newspapers, The Dominion and The Evening Post in 2002 (circulation: approx. 98,000; weekly readership: 255,000) (Fairfax New Zealand Ltd., 2006a). The Press is the most widely read newspaper in the South Island (circulation approx. 91,000; readership: 234,000 (weekly) (Fairfax New Zealand Ltd., 2006b). Unlike the print media in larger countries (e.g. see Seale, Boden, Wiliams, Lowe, & Steinberg, 2007) the New Zealand newspaper market is relatively unsegmented and so our focus on the major daily newspaper in each city guaranteed we were accessing the major source of print information.",

The initial classification was made by the first author, with the third author independently reading the articles and confirming the classification. Articles predominantly concerned single subjects. It was unusual, for example, for bovine TB articles to mention human health risks. The few that did so devoted only a single sentence or clause to ARTICLE IN PRESS the subject. The area where there was more overlap was in TB rates, cases and immigration. For example, a report on a case often provided information about TB rates as part of the context. However, there was no doubt expressed by the two readers about the main subject of the article which was usually reinforced by titles and other sub-editorial attention such as paragraphing and sub-headings.",

Occupations included dental therapist, student, meat worker, nurse and mill worker. The greatest coverage was afforded to cases in which the individual was working within a health care setting. Within this category the voice of public health officials tended to dominate, either reassuring readers about the nature of the TB cases or urging greater action. The third most frequent type of article discussing TB was related to immigration. This category is highly influenced by political discourses operating at the time of publication and tended to focus on changes in health screening/testing requirements for immigrants entering New Zealand. Other issues included concern over the comprehensiveness of health screening for asylum seekers, concern over Asian students and the general prevalence of TB among 'migrants'. These 'stories' were generally assembled by political reporters and Members of Parliament tended to be the most frequent contributors of commentary.",

            "text": "In order to understand the media coverage of bovine TB, it is necessary to provide some background information on this form of the disease. Following the discovery of the tubercle bacillus (or Mycobacterium tuberculosis) in 1882 it was recognised that there were two major forms of the disease-human and bovine. In the early 20th century only about 2% of pulmonary TB was caused by bovine infection, but 30% of nonpulmonary infection was caused by consuming infected meat or milk. The latter assumed greater importance as it was primarily associated with infection of children and infants. Affecting the bones and joints, it was the major form of crippling of children, and in 1930s in New Zealand up to 400 children were hospitalised each year with bovine TB (Bryder, 2003) . Like other Western countries, New Zealand sought to eradicate bovine TB. In 1951 compulsory tuberculin-testing of all dairy herds was instituted, together with the eradication of positive reactors and pasteurisation of milk supplies to urban areas. Despite these efforts, the problem never entirely disappeared, at least partly because of the cost involved to the producers, and the issue continued to exercise minds within the dairy and meat industries. New Zealand was not alone. In 2004, the British Department of the Environment, Food and Rural declared bovine TB to be 'the largest threat facing us at the moment'; Britain was in danger, they believed, of losing its bovine TB free status (Waddington, 2006) . As a major public health issue, it remained a potential rather than actual threat.",

Bovine TB issues received the greatest exposure within The Press, which is unsurprising given the largely rural nature of the South Island of New Zealand.

Over the study period, considerable debate emerged over the use of aerially spread 1080 poison as a mechanism for curbing the possum population and hence, incidence of TB in cattle and dairy stock. One-third of all articles on bovine TB addressed this issue and covered the viewpoints of various stakeholders (e.g. Department of Conservation, the Animal Health Board), concerned farmers, and, to a lesser degree, the views of environmentalists concerned at the ecological impacts of the poison. Rather than TB being depicted as a serious threat to the health of humans, the target of concern is the use of 1080 and its effects on the ecosystem.",

By the early 20th century, it was generally believed that the TB germ was harboured in environments of dirt and squalor, in the homes of the poor from which it could spread to their more respectable (middle-class) neighbours. In Britain, the National Association of the Prevention of Tuberculosis declared that 'the beautiful and rich receive it from the unbeautiful poor' (Bryder, 1988, p. 20) . By the 21st century the concern had shifted from the 'poor' (although marginalised groups such as the homeless and those with AIDS were still implicated) to the role played by Third World populations in harbouring the disease which threatens to 'explode' into the developed world (Dormandy, 1999) . Articles in New Zealand papers stressed the potential for TB to similarly have an impact beyond otherwise marginalised populations, with words such as 'alert' or 'scare' commonly used, reflecting such latent fears.",

The disease itself was invariably and aptly described as being an infectious or communicable disease. However, it was often labelled a 'third-world disease' and as being potentially fatal, deadly or lethal (e.g. 'deadly infectious disease' was used to describe MDR TB, even when only one of the commonly used drugs was not effective on the strain (DP 21/6/04)). This reporting emphasises the degree to which TB continues to be associated with fear and alarm. On the other hand, some press releases from District Health Boards are calming in tone. For example, the Hutt DHB stressed that a sudden jump in TB cases in a particular month was nothing to worry about as most cases were neither pulmonary nor infectious (DP 20/12/04).",

This was, in fact, very unlikely; it was commonly recognised that doctors who rarely saw TB were not good at identifying its symptoms. Nevertheless, one health official stated reassuringly that it was most unlikely that any children were exposed to the illness. The article then outlined the number of contacts the dental worker had within the two schools and the process public health officials were following in terms of offering information to parents, skin tests and X-rays or medicine if necessary. The school principal stated that there was no panic in the school and praised health officials' handling of the issue. Yet an article the following day entitled 'TB fear spurs dad to bar dental care for son' (DP 7/8/ 03) described the action of one parent as removing his son from dental services after discovering that the therapist concerned had not worn a mask on several occasions while treating children. Subsequent articles mentioned the occurrence of skin tests, while 3 weeks later an article entitled 'TB tests on school children allay fears' (DP 21/10/03) reported that it was unlikely that any children had developed the illness through their contact with the dental worker. The article concluded by simply stating 'The worker is no longer on Hutt Hospital staff'.",

In nearly all instances of individual TB cases, the views of public health officials are extensively reported. At times, comments by health officials essentially minimised the 'infectiousness' of the disease, suggesting that it was unlikely to have been transmitted. In the case of the dental worker, medical officer of health (MoH) Annette Nesdale said that 'In the very unlikely event that any child has been directly exposed to the TB bacteria, they will not be infectious at this stage and therefore could not pass the TB bacteria on to other people' (DP 5/8/03) while in the case of a Dunedin nurse who contracted the disease, the district health board chief executive Dr. Bill Adams stated 'Early y TB, which I gather this is, is not very infectious at all. It's only in the later stages it is, so in the early stages it's not an issue for other people' (NZH 4/7/ 02). In another case, a primary school child was reported as being diagnosed with the disease, with the MoH for Wellington saying 'though the disease was airborne, the risk of children being infected was 'pretty small' (DP 21/10/02). The reasons for trying to reassure readers and minimise the infectiousness of the disease are understandable. However, these responses serve to send mixed messages about the disease and contrast with comments made by the Ministry of Health exhorting people to be vigilant regarding the symptoms of the disease (e.g. NZH 23/2/02) and a number of articles warning people not to be complacent in light of TBs resurgence in New Zealand (e.g. 'Dreaded TB on rise again'-DP 28/6/04, and 'Rise in TB cases alarms health officials-NZH 23/3/04). Exhorting people to be vigilant regarding the symptoms of the disease in the face of a possible rising incidence suggests that the emphasis rested on individual responsibility for checking the disease; its infectiousness was downplayed by the health officials though not by the press generally.",

Keeping disease outside national borders is an issue which has exercised the minds of public health and immigration officials since the late 19th century, in New Zealand as in other countries such as Australia and the United States (Bashford, 2004; Bryder, 1996) . A number of articles described efforts by New Zealand immigration officials to 'harden the borders' and increase medical testing and policing of migrants entering the country. This includes screening migrants from 'highrisk' countries for TB (DP 29/1/04). The basis for tightening the medical screening procedures tended to be framed in terms of economic costs of treating such cases (e.g. 'The government is expected to announce tougher medical screening of migrant groups at risk of TB, AIDS and other expensive-totreat diseases' (DP 21/1/04)). The then Immigration Minister, Lianne Dalziel justified this move by stating 'A country is entitled in determining whether people are eligible for residence or not to undertake-and I know it might sound harsh-a costsbenefit analysis y if there are going to be significant costs' (DP 29/1/04). The proposed shift, enacted in 2005, from compulsory TB screening only for people intending to stay for 2 years or more, to all those coming for 6 months or more was repeatedly endorsed and supported by public health officials (NZH 29/1/04). This focus on economic assessment of costs ignores data which reveals that defensive border screening only picks up a small proportion of all TB cases in overseas born individuals who develop TB in New Zealand (Das et al., 2006) , yet border screening is seen as the primary mechanism to deal with TB in immigrants. The main reason why border screening is only a small part of the answer is because few migrants enter the country with active TB.",

Another article, 'Health alert on asylum seekers' (NZH 23/8/02), describes the high burden of disease, including TB, amongst asylum seekers. Elsewhere, in an article titled 'Immigrants a strain' (DP 30/8/02), the Hon. Winston Peters accused the Immigration Minister of endangering New Zealanders' health by exposing them to 'third world' disease brought to New Zealand by refugees and asylum seekers. He claimed that refugees and asylum seekers were 'bringing HIV, TB, rubella and infectious skin diseases to New Zealand with them' (DP 30/8/02).

(Hansard, Week 35-2003) . This time, however, his statements in Parliament were not broadcast widely in the print media. These texts reveal the extent to which different migrants are seen as being more 'diseased' than others. Asylum seekers are possibly imagined as the least desirable of all migrants and are thus repeatedly identified and targeted for increased policing and surveillance, and, at worst, refused entry. In these stories, it is not the economic costs but the danger to health of New Zealanders that is stressed. This contrast in the media attention given to Mr Peters' statements in 2002 and 2003 also shows the variable degree to which statements and allegations made by public figures are translated into print media items, pointing to the active role of the media in creating news.",

Yet within this category, some students, most notably Asian students, are targeted more than others (e.g. 'TB fears over Asian students'-TP 31/10/02). In one situation it is reported, 'Canterbury health authorities have renewed calls for tougher TB screening of foreign students after yet another student has been found with the disease' (Press 13/12/03) (emphasis added). This is interesting given that it is reported that in the Canterbury area only 10% of TB notifications are for foreign students (TP 10/10/03). While this case occurred before compulsory screening was introduced, it highlights the extent to which foreign students are associated with TB in New Zealand. In another article reporting on the same case, the MoH Dr. Brieseman stated that 'Health screening of students before they entered the country would help health authorities pick up and treat cases of TB before they were found in the community and save a lot of work. I don't think it's a risk of spreading it around. It's about how much work it takes for us to deal with it-contact tracking, that kind of thing' (TP 13/12/03). This quote justifies screening not in terms of preventing the spread of disease but reducing the workload of stretched health workers. A quote from the president of the local University Students Association concurs with Dr. Brieseman saying that 'It's a time bomb waiting to happen-what other illnesses and diseases are they bringing in?' and 'we have to protect our own domestic students' (TP 10/ 12/03).",

Since the bacteriological revolution of the 19th century, germs had been described as the enemy which attacked the body which must summon its defenses against the invasion. Scientific medicine was responsible for the 'conquest' of the disease (see for example, Waksman, 1965) .

First, each of the newspapers included roughly the same number of TB-related articles over the study period. Thus, although it is evident of late that most cases of TB arise in Auckland, the disease appears to be of national concern. To a large extent, this nation-wide trend is skewed by the high level of interest in bovine TB which, in turn, is reflective of pastoral agriculture's enduring place within the nation's economy and culture. We identified 43% of coverage devoted to this animal variant which has little actual, though much potential, health consequence to humans. These stories speak to New Zealand's economic vulnerability as a nation dependent on trade and the way that loss of TB-free status would impact upon the economy. The finger is justifiably pointed at the possum, an introduced marsupial which is not only a reservoir of TB (and therefore a constant threat to domestic herds of cattle and deer), but also is a threat to native forests and orchards. Like the 'domestic students' of concern to the student president quoted earlier, domestic animals and other resources also have to be protected from 'diseased' migrants, whether they are possums (which make herds vulnerable to infection) or recent migrants (whose active pulmonary TB potentially infects fellow students and might contribute to the downturn of the multi-million dollar market in international education).",

As in their study, we see TB in New Zealand as having become emblematic of the 'otherness' associated with less welcome aspects of transnationalism, given that for some politicians (and journalists), the very presence of members of diasporic communities challenges, if not destabilises, a sense of nation and identity. Indeed, as Curtis (2004, p. 241) states, the populations most at risk of tuberculosis are those which are frequently disadvantaged and socially excluded. Responses by society to the disease often reflect the social relations between, on the one hand, these groups at risk and, on the other hand, the more affluent and powerful social groups with greater control over the collective resources of society that might be used to combat the disease.",

For it is through a reporting that lends disproportionate focus on the economic threat of animal TB and the social threat of the migrant 'other' that TB becomes recast as a disease of 'Other' places and peoples, rather than one replete with potential to reappear within close and familiar contexts. By way of example, one noteworthy story (DP 31/03/03) in our dataset concerned a New Zealand born European who was surprised to find that he had TB and who was illustrated by a photograph of doctor and patient in Hanoi. Another factual piece contributed by a GP about TB in New Zealand was illustrated by a different Vietnamese man recovering from a lung operation for TB, apparently (DP 28/6/04). In these instances, although the reporter and contributor were writing about domestic TB, somewhere within the editorial process TB became associated with 'foreigners' who were, in this instance, neither migrants nor intending migrants, but presumably chosen because they represented 'the other'. In such conflations with Otherness in the media, a further layer of irony exists with most TB among so-called 'others' developing after (and sometimes decades after) their arrival (Das et al., 2006) . Were this insight to be shared with the public, then it would be more possible for people to understand the way in which latent TB combined with poverty and overcrowding might lead to active TB. Instead, the impression is created of active TB disease striding over the nation's borders or being 'brought in' by migrants.",

Indeed, a noticeable exclusion in our study findings was coverage of the strong link between poverty and TB. This finding concurs with recent Canadian research that reveals a stark difference in focus between the determinants of health status identified in policy statements and the stories in newspapers, which overwhelmingly focus on issues of health care (Hayes et al., 2007) . While the link with migrants was made, the fact that many such people experience considerable difficulties securing housing and employment was absent from accounts. With the exception of one short article on housing, there was no reporting on the links between socio-economic determinants of health and TB. Indeed, the experience of the disease in general was missing, even in the more discursive 'Weekend Review' sections of these newspapers. This situation arguably reflects the stigma of TB. Unless some celebrity were to contract it (as has been the case in the past with, for example, author Katherine Mansfield), we can presume it would not be worthy of a 'feature' article. However, we need to add a qualification. While the surveyed articles which addressed TB directly did not dwell on poverty, many articles on the issue of poverty per se (and particularly child poverty), referred to TB in passing along with other diseases of the poor (Bryder, 2003) .",

The quest for biomedical 'breakthroughs' is emphasised over efforts to redress the socio-economic conditions.
