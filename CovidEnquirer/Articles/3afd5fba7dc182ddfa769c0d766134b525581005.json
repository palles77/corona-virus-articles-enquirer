We surveyed eight infected couples, a total of 3 infants were closely lived with their parents, but none of them was infected. Just 3 children were infected from their parents or relatives.

With the Spring Festival coming, young or middle-aged people are more likely to attend social activity, which results in person-to-person transmission.

Since the outbreak in Wuhan, it is unclear how many people truly infected and how many infected people of Wuhan has imported to the other cities. Screening the potential infectors related to Wuhan was implemented quickly by the local governments after the announced of Wuhan shutdown. Dynamic analysis of 104 cases from two centers in Hunan province showed that the imported cases mainly appeared during Jan 22, 2019 to Feb 5, 2020, then the indigenous cases became the major body, suggesting the initial cases have been founded over nearly 20 days of screening. Our observation showed a smoothly increase in the cumulative number of confirmations, newly confirmed cases per day also remained relatively stable. Compared with the contemporary growth trend in Wuhan, explosive increase in the confirmed cases was not observed in the two centers from Jan 22, 2019 to Feb 12, 2020, indicating that the timely control measures in the two cities worked well.
