            "text": "The endoplasmic reticulum (ER) is where the major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules are loaded with epitopes to cause an immune cellular response. Most of the protein antigens are degraded in the cytoplasm to amino acids and few epitopes reach the ER. Antigen targeting of this organelle by Calreticulin (CRT) fusion avoids this degradation and enhances the immune response. We constructed a recombinant adenovirus to express the E7 antigen with an ER-targeting signal peptide (SP) plus an ER retention signal (KDEL sequence). In cell-culture experiments we demonstrated that this new E7 antigen, SP-E7-KDEL, targeted the ER. Infection of mice with this recombinant adenovirus that expresses SP-E7-KDEL showed interferon induction and tumour-protection response, similar to that provided by an adenovirus expressing the E7 antigen fused to CRT. This work demonstrated that just by adding a SP and the KDEL sequence, antigens can be targeted and retained in the ER with a consequent enhancement of immune response and tumour protection. These results will have significant clinical applications. Mice. Female C57BL6 mice (6-8 weeks old) were purchased from Harlan (M\u00e9xico City, M\u00e9xico), housed in the animal facilities of the Histology Department of the School of Medicine, UANL, and cared for in conformity with good laboratory practice guidelines. Cell lines. HEK293 cells were maintained in advanced DMEM supplemented with 4% heat-inactivated foetal bovine serum (FBS). TC-1 cells derived from primary epithelial cells of C57BL/6 mice co-transformed with HPV-16 E6 and E7 and the c-Ha-ras oncogenes, were maintained in RPMI 1640 medium supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated FBS. All of the cell lines were purchased from American Type Culture Collection (Manassas, VA, USA).",

Recognition of any intracellular or viral protein by CD8 \u03e9 cytotoxic T lymphocytes requires an initial cytosolic proteolytic processing by proteasomes to peptide products, which are then translocated by transporters associated with antigen processing (TAP) into the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they assemble with major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules to be presented to the cell surface [1] . Most peptides released from the proteasome into the cytosol are promptly degraded by cytosolic endopetidases and aminopep-tidases to single amino acids before they can 'escape' by binding to the TAP and enter the ER. It has been calculated that only one peptide binds to an MHC class I molecule from 10 4 degraded proteins [2] . This explains the relatively subtle efficiency of antigen presentation by class I molecules. Coupled with this, cervical cancer cells (as well as a number of other malignant tumours) often show down regulation or, in a subset of cases, complete loss of MHC class I expression, most likely as a mechanism of immune escape [3] .",

For this purpose, groups of female adult C57BL6 mice were challenged with HPV-16 E7expressing murine tumour cells, designated TC-1, 1 week after immunization with adenovirus expressing CRT-E7, SP-E7-KDEL, E7 or LacZ. As seen in Fig. 4 , rapid tumour growth was observed in the group of mice immunized with the control adenovirus expressing LacZ, all of whom had to be killed. As expected, immunization with an Adenovirus expressing E7 did no protect the mice against tumour development, which is because of its poor immunogenicity [4] [5] [6] . All the mice had to be killed as well. In contrast, all the mice vaccinated with the adenovirus expressing SP-E7-KDEL or CRT-E7 eliminated the tumour. This similar protective effect demonstrates that the SP and KDEL signals are enough to enhance the antitumour immune response.",

            "text": "Taken together, our results indicate that the adjuvant antitumour effect attributed to CRT [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] is mainly conferred by its SP and KDEL sequences, which allow antigens to enter and be maintained in the ER. The KDEL sequence is emerging as a significant antitumour immunity sequence. Recently, it was shown that dendritic cells loaded with exogenous peptides bearing the KDEL motif showed a more efficient antitumour activity than dendritic cells pulsed with peptides without KDEL [13] . Even though the mechanism of epitope generation in the ER is poorly understood, the KDEL sequence might result in a longer trafficking time through the ER, increasing the possibility of degradation and consequently, peptide generation and loading by the MHC-1 molecule. It will be worth determining the contribution of the SP itself to the adjuvant effect compared to the addition of both SP and KDEL sequences [14, 15] . Another advantage of this strategy is to prevent any putative adverse effect caused by overexpression of CRT, because of, for example its role in Ca 2\u03e9 storage and transport into the ER [16] . It has been demonstrated that fusion of CRT also enhances the humoral response of antigens such as the receptor-binding domain (domain IV) of the protective antigen (PA[dIV] ) of Bacillus anthracis [17] and a SARS coronavirus antigen [18] . Even though the pathway is unknown, it is expected that our strategy might potentiate this response as well. In conclusion targeting of antigens to the ER confers a striking immunogenic potential in gene cancer therapy. This work represents an important contribution for basic research and future clinical translation. ",

To evaluate if the SP and KDEL signals have the same adjuvant effect as CRT did with E7, groups of female adult C57BL6 mice treated with adenovirus expressing either the SP-E7-KDEL or CRT-E7 were analysed for levels of interferon (IFN)-\u2425, a signature cytokine for Th1 responses and the effector function of CD8 \u03e9 T cells, critical for tumour eradication",
