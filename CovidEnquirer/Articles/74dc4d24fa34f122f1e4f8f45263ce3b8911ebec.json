In the pathogenesis of FIP the immune status of the animal is very important: cats with preexisting antibodies to FIPV may experience an accelerated infection upon challenge, resulting in survival times shorter than those of seronegative animals (Pedersen and Boyle, 1980; Weiss and Scott, 1981) . This phenomenon is referred to as \"early death.\" The underlying mechanism is thought to be an antibody-dependent enhancement of infection of macrophages (Pot-terfield, 1986) . Although antibodies against the spike protein (S) neutralized viral infectivity in vitro (de Groot et al., 1989; Vennema et a/., 1990a) , immunization of kittens with a recombinant vaccinia virus expressing the S protein caused early death after challenge (Vennema et a/., 1990a) .",

Additional cDNA clones were isolated from the library using fragments of pB 12 as probes and analyzed to confirm the nucleotide sequence. By comparison with the published sequence of TGEV regions of both the M and N protein genes were identified. The nucleotide and derived amino acid sequences are shown in Fig. 2 . The nucleotide sequence was 79% identical to the corresponding sequence of TGEV . Optimal alignments of the predicted amino acid sequences are represented graphically in Fig. 3 . Among the M protein sequences most differences were found in the N-terminal region which is thought to protrude from the viral membrane. Between the N protein sequences domains with insertions/deletions and multiple differences were found around residues 200 and 350. Other differences were predominantly conservative changes. Overall identity was slightly lower for the N proteins (77%) than for the M (84.7%) and S proteins (82.29/o; Jacobs et al., 1987) .",

The amount of pooled antiserum used was such that each individual serum was diluted lOO-fold in the final immunoprecipitation mixture. Pooled sera of the days of primary and secondary immunization gave a background level of precipitation (Fig. 6) . Particularly, the nucleocapsid protein was precipitated nonspecifically, probably by binding to Pansorbin. Pooled sera from 3 days before challenge of the kittens immunized with vFM and vFN precipitated the M and N proteins, respectively. The same serum pool of the control group gave only background signal. After challenge, the amount of N and M protein precipitated increased, starting from PCD 5 and 7, respectively, as a result of secondary immune responses. The primary response against the S protein could be detected at low levels on PCD 9. The pooled sera of vFN-immunized kittens from before and shortly after challenge appeared to precipitate small amounts of M protein.",

Interestingly, a short stretch of highly divergent amino acid sequence was observed. A stretch of 23 amino acids (residues 23 to 45) between the signal sequence and the first hydrophobic domain had only 47.8% identity in an optimal alignment. The N-glycosylation site and three cysteine residues located in this region were conserved. In analogy to MHV, this part of the M protein is predicted to be exposed on the outside of virus particles (Rottier et a/., 1986) .

Panels vSC, vFM, and vFN: pooled sera of eight kittens immunized with vSC, vFM, or vFN, respectively. The lanes marked 1 st, 2nd. and -3 represent reactions at the day of the first and second immunization, and at 3 days before challenge. Subsequent numbers indicate the postchallenge day on which sera quence coding region was expressed in HeLa cells (data not shown), using the hybrid vaccinia virus T7 expression system (Fuerst et al,, 1986 ). The mutant M protein was fully glycosylated (data not shown), which illustrates that the N-terminal signal sequence of the FIPV M protein is not required for glycosylation. After alignment of the N proteins of FIPV and TGEV two divergent regions, which may represent immunologically important domains in the N protein, were found. Since the N protein is not exposed on the outside of virus particles, these domains may represent T-cell epitopes rather than B-cell epitopes.",

We now show that neither the N protein nor the M protein expressed by recombinant vaccinia viruses induced early death after challenge. Immunization with vFN induced N-protein specific antibodies in kittens but appeared to have no effect on the outcome of challenge. In contrast, immunization with vFM markedly affected the survival time after challenge in a number of kittens. However, all animals seroconverted after challenge (Fig. 7D ) and showed clinical signs (pyrexia and anorexia) and only three of eight animals recovered from infection. Clearly, the significance of these results needs to be substantiated with additional immunization experiments. The serological assays performed with individual sera from the animals of the vFM-immunized group showed no correlation between antibody levels and survival times. It has been implied that immunity against FIPV is largely ceil-mediated (Pedersen, 1989 ). Measurements of cell-mediated immunity in experimentally infected cats have been reported but were difficult to perform and showed considerable variation (Pedersen, 1987) .",

Kittens immunized with vFM were numbered from shortest to longest survival time after challenge; these were 2 1 days for 1 (89s). 23 days for 2 (89R) and 3 (M93), 36 days for 4 (M94), 41 days for 5 (M88), or more than 90 days for 6 (M87), 7 (721), and 8 (M79). Sera were from the day of the second immunizatlon (A). from 3 days before challenge (B), and from 9 (C) and 17 (D) days after challenge; panels A through C represent only the lower portions of the gels containing the M protein bands. D Illustrates the primary immune response against the S and N proteins. The structural oroteins have been indicated. virus early transcription termination signals (mNT; Rohrmann et a/., 1986) enhanced the immunogenicity considerably. The M protein gene contains 1 transcription termination signal. Expression of the M protein in vitro could be measured only after 6 hr p.i. (data not shown) although transcription is driven by the 7.5-kDa gene early-late promoter. Besides increasing immunogenicity, early expression is essential for the induction of cytotoxic T-lymphocytes (CTLs) by recombinant vaccinia viruses (Wachsman et al., 1989) . Specific CTLs are probably of major importance in recovery from FIPV infection but the viral antigens involved are not known. Enhancement of the induction of CTLs by removal of early transcription termination signals remains to be shown.",
