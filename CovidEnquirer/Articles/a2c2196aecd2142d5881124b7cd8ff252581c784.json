However, the condition can be clinically difficult to diagnose and to distinguish from rejection. The aim of this prospective study was to evaluate heparin-binding protein (HBP), lysozyme, and the cytokines interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8, IL-10 and tumor necrosis factor (TNF) in bronchoalveolar lavage fluid (BALF) as potential biomarkers for pulmonary infection in lung-transplanted patients. One hundred thirteen BALF samples from 29 lung transplant recipients were collected at routine scheduled bronchoscopies at 3 and 6 months, or on clinical indication. Samples were classified into no, possible, probable, or definite infection at the time of sampling. Rejection was defined by biopsy results. HBP, lysozyme, and cytokines were analyzed in BALF and correlated to likelihood of infection and rejection. All biomarkers were significantly increased in BALF during infection, whereas patients with rejection presented low levels that were comparable to noninfection samples. HBP, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-8 were the best diagnostic markers of infection with area under the receiver-operating characteristic curve values of 0.88, 0.91, and 0.90, respectively. In conclusion, HBP, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-8 could be useful diagnostic markers of pulmonary infection in lung-transplanted patients.

However, Lntx patients may lack classical signs of infection due to heavy immunosuppression, and rejection may be asymptomatic. In addition, there are possible links between infection and the development of rejection. 4 For example, viral pneumonia has been associated with chronic lung allograft dysfunction and graft loss. 5 Antimicrobial peptides in respiratory secretions play an important role as a first line of defence against infections. 7 Lysozyme is the most abundant airway antimicrobial peptide, and is secreted primarily by neutrophils and sub-mucosal glands. 8 Heparin-binding protein (HBP) was initially recognized for its broad antimicrobial activity, but is now known to be a multifunctional inflammatory mediator that induces vascular leakage and acts as a chemoattractant and activator of monocytes. 9, 10 The protein is stored in secretory and azurophilic granules of neutrophils, and is rapidly released upon cell activation. 11 Plasma HBP has been described as a promising biomarker for severe sepsis and septic shock, 12 and elevated HBP levels have also been shown in cerebrospinal fluid during bacterial meningitis 13 and in urine during urinary tract infections. 14 Neither HBP nor lysozyme has previously been evaluated in BALF of Lntx patients. In this study, we quantified the two proteins together with the pro-inflammatory cytokines interleukin (IL)-1\u03b2, IL-6, IL-8 and TNF, and anti-inflammatory IL-10 in BALF collected during the first year after transplantation. The primary aim was to evaluate HBP and lysozyme as potential biomarkers for infection, and to determine their ability to discriminate infection from rejection in lung transplant recipients.",

IL-10 is believed to play an important role in balancing the inflammatory response in order to limit host tissue damage. 19 For example, compared to wild-type mice, IL-10-deficient mice demonstrate more efficient bacterial clearance but higher mortality and increased neutrophil recruitment to the lung in response to Streptococcus pneumoniae infection, 20 which underscores the regulatory role of IL-10 during infection.

We chose to define infection as samples graded probable and definite infection in our calculations. We believe this is appropriate in this clinical setting with immunocompromised patients where treatment of a probable infection would be justified.This was a single-center study with a limited number of patients, which is a shortcoming to our study. Second, even if efforts were made to have a standardized protocol for BAL procedure and study sampling, we cannot fully estimate the dilution factor. However, with the described urea method we have tried to address this problem.Another difficulty was the definition of infection in these patients. Wehave made efforts to ensure that the groups definite and no infection are correct. However, there is a risk of misclassification in the groups possible and probable infection, as infection is difficult to diagnose in these patients and some may be colonized with bacteria rather than infected. Moreover, a large proportion of patients with clinically suspected infection had received prior antibiotic or antifungal treatment at the time of bronchoscopy, which may have affected the grading of infection. If present, this misclassification would likely bias the estimates towards the null, as prior treatment may result in false negative cultures and possibly decreasing levels of the biomarkers. Despite a potential for misclassification, we could demonstrate that all tested biomarkers, and especially HBP, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-8, increase with infection. Infection and rejection are common complications in lung transplant recipients, and early diagnosis and treatment is important for outcome. In this study, we show that HBP, IL-1\u03b2, and IL-8 could be useful biomarkers for the detection of pulmonary infection in Lntx patients. HBP has not previously been evaluated in Lntx patients and could be a simple and rapid tool for diagnosis of infection. Of interest, the biomarkers also seemed to discriminate between infection and rejection. However, the relevance and further characterization of the actual markers need to be validated in further larger prospective studies.
