A colony of gray collies had been maintained at the University of Washington (Seattle) for the study of cyclic hematopoiesis. This condition is manifested by periodic fluctuations of the cellular components of the blood, most notably the neutrophil population. These dogs can be used to study the basic regulatory mechanisms involved with hematopoiesis, as well as possible treatments for both the human and the canine conditions (Brabb et al., 1995) . Golden retrievers affected with muscular dystrophy have been used as models of Duchenne muscular dystrophy in human children. Duchenne muscular dystrophy is caused by an absence of the muscle protein dystrophin, inherited in an X-linked recessive manner. The dystrophy in golden retrievers is caused by the absence of the same protein and is inherited in the same way. The clinical signs (such as debilitating limb contracture) are also similar between the canine and human conditions (Kornegay et al., 1994) . Other genetic disorders studied in dog colonies include hereditary canine spinal muscle atrophy (Cork, 1991) and narcoplepsy in Doberman pinschers (Ripley et al., 2001) . Bedlington terriers have been used to study copper storage diseases (such as Wilson's disease) and the development of spontaneous diabetes mellitus and hypothyroidism has been studied in several breeds of dogs for comparisons with the human conditions.",

Usually these dogs are either beagles or mongrel foxhounds, although other breeds may be available. Purpose-bred dogs typically receive veterinary care throughout their stay at the breeding facility. They are usually vaccinated against rabies virus, canine distemper virus, parvovirus, adenovirus type 2, parainfluenza virus, Leptospira serovars Canicola, Icterohaemorrhagiae, Grippotyphosa, and Pomona, and Bordetella bronchiseptica (Jasmin, personal communication).

Random-source dogs that have been treated and vaccinated in preparation for use in research are termed conditioned dogs. These dogs are then suitable for long-term studies or terminal preparations that require unperturbed physiologic parameters. Conditioned dogs are often tested for heartworm antigen because of the implications that infestations can have on cardiovascular status and surgical risk.

Briefly, Class A licensees are breeders who raise all animals on their premises from a closed colony. Class B licensees purchase the dogs from other individuals (including unadopted animals from municipal pounds) and resell them to research facilities. There are additional regulations that apply to Class B dealers (such as holding periods and record-keeping documentation) because of the public concern that stolen pets could enter biomedical research facilities in this manner. In December 2013, the National Institutes of Health (NIH) issued notice NOT-OD-14-034 entitled Notice regarding NIH plan to transition from use of USDA Class B dogs to other legal sources (National Institutes of Health, 2013) . This NIH policy begins in the fiscal year 2015 and prohibits the procurement of dogs from Class B dealers using NIH grant funds. From that point forward, dogs on NIHfunded studies will have to be obtained from Class A vendors, privately owned colonies (such as institutional breeding colonies), or client-owned animals (e.g., animals participating in veterinary clinical trials).",

At this time, the testicular growth is rapid, the seminiferous tubules begin to differentiate, and Sertoli cells form the blood-testis barrier. Secretion of follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH) by the anterior pituitary stimulates the production of other key hormones by the Sertoli cells, including, inhibin, androgen binding protein, and estrogen. FSH stimulates spermatogenesis in the presence of testosterone, whereas inhibin and estrogen provide negative feedback to the pituitary gland to decrease FSH production. Spermatogenesis in the dog is completed in 45 days, with subsequent maturation of sperm occurring in the epididymis for approximately 15 days.

Cornification occurs approximately 2 days prior to the estrogen peak and 4 days prior to standing heat. As cornification of vaginal epithelial cells proceeds, the cells become larger, with more angular borders. The nuclear/ cytoplasmic ratio decreases until the nuclei reach a point where they no longer take up stain (coincident with the onset of estrus). The cells appear 'anuclear' and are classified as 'cornified' or 'anuclear squames.' The vaginal cytology smear of the bitch changes from predominantly cornified to noncornified 6 days after ovulation. The day of this change is the first day of diestrus. Other epithelial cell types noted on vaginal cytology include superficial cells (large, angular cells with small nuclei); intermediate cells (round or oval cells with abundant cytoplasm and large, vesicular nuclei); and parabasal cells (small round or elongated cells with large, well-stained nuclei, and a high nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio). Based on vaginal cytology, the estrous cycle is classified as follows: Although vaginal cytology is a useful tool, observation of behavioral estrus is the best criterion to use in breeding management. During proestrus, the male is attracted to the bitch and will investigate her hindquarters, but she LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE will not accept breeding. Estrus is characterized by proactive receptivity to mounting by males and increased male-seeking behavior (Concannon, 2011) . During this stage, the bitch will exhibit 'flagging,' or elevation of her tail with muscular elevation of the vulva to facilitate penetration by the male. In order to maximize the conception rate and litter size, it is recommended to breed the bitch on days 1, 3, and 5 of the standing heat. Due to the long life span of canine sperm, fertilization occurs in the oviduct up to 8 days after coitus. The ovulated oocyte is a primary oocyte that must undergo two meiotic divisions before fertilization can occur. This overall maturation process takes approximately 2 days. After maturation, the oocyte remains viable for 4-5 days. Optimal conception rates tend to occur when the bitch is bred from 4 days before to 3 days after ovulation; best litter size is achieved when the bitch is bred 2 days after ovulation.",

Due to the similarities with the clinical signs seen in human cases of TSS, superantigens are thought to contribute to the virulence of S. zooepidemicus in cases of acute hemorrhagic pneumonia. These superantigens work by bypassing the conventional mechanisms of antigen presentation and binding to major histocompatibilitity complex class II receptors. As a result, there is a hyperactive proinflammatory response and an 'avalanche' of cytokines including interleukin 1\u03b2 (IL-1\u03b2), interleukin 6 (IL-6), and tumor necrosis factor alpha (TNF-\u03b1). Three novel superantigen-encoding genes have been identified from a case of acute fatal hemorrhagic pneumonia, szeF, szeN, and szeP. However, it is currently unclear what effect these superantigens have in vivo Priestnall et al., 2010) . While superantigens have been detected in some isolates, there is not enough data to determine if superantigens play a role in the pathogenesis (Byun et al., 2009; Kim et al., 2007) .",

Clinical disease is usually seen in young dogs and the characteristic sign is voluminous, light-colored, foul-smelling, soft to watery diarrhea, which is the result of malabsorption and hypersecretion. Giardia has a direct life cycle with infection resulting after consuming cyst-contaminated food or water. The change in pH between the stomach and duodenum activates excystation and trophozoites then attach to the enterocytes. For diagnosis, direct fecal smears are considered best for observing trophozoites and zinc sulfate centrifugation is preferred for detection of cysts. A commercial ELISA kit is licensed for use in dogs, but the positive predictive value is poor and zinc sulfate centrifugation techniques should be used in conjunction with ELISA (Rishniw et al., 2010) . PCR assays are also available for diagnosing giardiasis. Differential diagnoses for giardiasis include bacterial and protozoal enteritis, coccidiosis, and whipworm infestation.

Coccidian oocysts can be found in feces of clinically healthy dogs, as well as animals with diarrhea. Clinically affected animals are young or immunosuppressed and develop diarrhea, which can vary from soft to watery and may contain blood or mucus. Vomiting, dehydration, lethargy, and weight loss can also be seen. Coccidia oocysts are typically spread by fecal-oral transmission, but dogs can ingest monozoic cysts in intermediate host tissues. The coccidian life cycle is both sexual and asexual, and results in the release of unsporulated eggs, which sporulate under appropriate environmental conditions. Other causes for diarrhea should be excluded before a coccidial etiology is implicated. Treatment may not be necessary, as infections are typically self-limiting and clinically insignificant. Treatment may help to limit the number of oocysts shed in a kennel-housing situation and may be necessary in cases of protracted clinical illness. Possible choices for treatment include daily administration of sulfadimethoxine (50-60 mg/kg PO q24 h for 10-20 days) or trimethoprim sulfa (30 mg/kg PO q8 h for 10 days).",

Clinical illness is usually only seen in young animals with large worm burdens. Diarrhea, vomiting, dehydration, and abdominal discomfort with vocalization can be seen. Puppies may have a classical 'potbellied' appearance. Heavy infestations can cause intussusception and/or intestinal obstruction. Puppies that experience lung migrations of larval worms can develop fatal pneumonia. Toxascaris canis can infect dogs by transplacental migration, transmammary migration, or ingestion of infective eggs. The infective stage of T. canis is the third-stage larva (L3). In transplacental infections, puppies may be born with L3 larvae in their lungs (Sherding, 1989) . For diagnosis, large (70-85 \u03bcm in diameter) and relatively round ascarid eggs can be seen by standard fecal flotation methods. Monthly administration of milbemycin or ivermectin plus pyrantel pamoate is recommended for prevention (Hall and Simpson, 2000) . Most anthelmintics are effective for treatment. Puppies should be treated early and often (every other week until 16 weeks of age) because of the possibility of prenatal or neonatal infection. Pregnant bitches can be treated with extended fenbendazole therapy (50 mg/kg PO once a day from day 40 of gestation through day 14 of lactation).",

Most infections are subclinical, but in symptomatic cases, the typical clinical sign is diarrhea with blood and/or mucus. Abdominal pain, anorexia, and weight loss may also be seen. Dogs may have eosinophilia, anemia, and/or hypoproteinemia on clinical hematology. Trichuris vulpis has a direct life cycle with eggs passed in the feces. The penetration of the adult worm into the enteric mucosa, and the associated inflammation, can lead to diarrhea. Factors that influence development of clinical symptoms are the number and location of adult whipworms; the severity of inflammation, anemia, or hypoproteinemia in the host; and the overall condition of the host. Whipworm infestation is diagnosed by the presence of barrel-shaped, thickwalled eggs with bipolar plugs on fecal flotation. Adult worms intermittently release eggs; therefore, negative results do not exclude infection. Differential diagnoses for whipworm infestation include giardiasis, coccidiosis, and bacterial enteritis. Fenbendazole, oxibendazole, and milbemycin have all been recommended for treatment of whipworms. Treatment for whipworm infestation should be at monthly intervals for 3 months (Jergens and Willard, 2000) .",

Definitive diagnosis is usually made by the identification of egg capsules or proglottids (tapeworm segments) on the surface of the feces or around the anus. The most significant means to limit cestode infestation is to control flea and/or louse exposure. Praziquantel at 5-12.5 mg/kg orally or subcutaneously is the standard treatment for cestodiasis, especially Taenia or Echinococcus species.

It can occur anywhere on the body but is often seen on the feet and face, and around the ears (DeManuelle, 2000a). Generalized demodicosis can develop in juvenile or adult populations and is indicative of an underlying immunosuppressive disorder. Demodex has a characteristic 'cigar shape' and can be identified from deep skin scrapings mounted on mineral oil (Campbell, 2000; Noli, 2000) . Differential diagnoses include dermatophytosis, allergic contact dermatitis, and seborrheic dermatitis. The primary differential diagnosis for generalized demodicosis is primary bacterial pyoderma, which is also a common secondary complication of generalized demodicosis.

The most common clinical sign is an intense pruritus, usually beginning at sparsely furred areas of the ear pinnae, elbows, ventral thorax, and abdomen. Lesions are characterized by alopecia and yellowish dry crusts with a macular papular eruption. These lesions may be exacerbated by excoriation due to the pruritic nature of the condition. Adult mites, mite eggs, or mite feces may be observed on superficial skin scrapings, but diagnosis may be difficult because multiple skin scrapings may yield negative results. Even if scrapings are negative, a therapeutic trial should be initiated if the clinical signs and history suggest a Sarcoptes etiology. Demonstration of anti-mite IgE either in the serum or via an intradermal antigen test can be used as a diagnostic aid (Campbell, 2000) . Histologic examination is nondiagnostic; however, suggestive lesions include small foci of edema, exocytosis, degeneration, and necrosis . An important differential diagnosis is flea allergy dermatitis (FAD). Unless antiparasitic therapy would interfere with research objectives, all dogs with sarcoptic mange should be treated. In addition, their kennel mates should also be treated due to the contagious nature of the disease and its zoonotic potential. The usual means of treatment is either ivermectin at 200-400 \u03bcg/kg q14 days or milbemycin at 2 mg/kg q7 days for three oral doses .",

Genera that more commonly infest dogs in the United States include species of Rhipicephalus, Dermacentor, Amblyomma, and Ixodes. The primary significance of tick infestation is vector-borne infectious diseases, including Rocky Mountain spotted fever (Rickettsia rickettsii), Lyme disease (Borrelia burgdorferi sensu stricto), thrombocytic anaplasmosis (Anaplasma platys), and canine monocytic ehrlichiosis (Ehrlichia canis). Ticks alone cause minimal signs unless the dog develops a hypersensitivity reaction leading to a more granulomatous response at the bite location (Merchant and Taboada, 1991) . Some species (primarily Dermacentor andersoni and D. variabilis) produce a salivary neurotoxin that causes an ascending flaccid paralysis (Malik and Farrow, 1991) . Uncomplicated tick bites and tick-bite paralysis are diagnosed by identification of the tick and clinical signs of paralysis. Dogs with tick-bite paralysis usually show improvement within 24 h of tick removal, with complete recovery within 72 h (Malik and Farrow, 1991) . Formamidines (amitraz), pyrethroids, and phenylpyrazoles (fipronil) are available as spot-ons, collars, sprays, and foggers to treat tick infestations in both the animal and the environment (Halos et al., 2014; Beugnet and Franc, 2012) .

Dogs that are hypersensitive to antigenic proteins in flea saliva develop severe FAD, which features papules, crusting, and excoriations over the lumbosacral region, flanks, thighs and abdomen. These animals may require oral corticosteroids to relieve clinical signs (Muller et al., 1983) . Secondary bacterial and fungal infections can also develop. Fleas can also transmit other parasitic diseases, such as Dipylidium tapeworms. Flea infestations and FAD are definitively diagnosed by observing the fleas on the host's skin; however, the presence of flea excrement can support a presumptive diagnosis (DeManuelle, 2000b) . Treatment of flea infestations should use an integrated pest management (IPM) approach that targets adult fleas, immature stages, and environmental contamination in order to limit the risk of chemoresistance. Combining ovicidal treatments, such as lufenuron and selamectin, with adulticidal treatments, such as fipronil, spinosad, selamectin, and imidacloprid, is recommended (Halos et al., 2014; Beugnet and Franc, 2012; Dryden et al., 2012) . Certain chemicals (i.e., imidacloprid and selamectin) have both adulticidal and larvacidal abilities, but the principles of IPM preclude the use of one product solely for both adulticidal and larvacidal properties (Schwassman and Logas, 2009 ).

Uncomplicated infections are characterized by circular areas of alopecia and crusting with or without follicular papules, usually around the face, neck, and forelimbs. Dermatophytes infect the hair shaft and follicle, as well as the surrounding skin. Infected hairs become brittle and broken shafts remain infective in the environment for months. Dermatophytoses are zoonotic and easily transmitted to other animals through the environment or by direct contact. Definitive diagnosis is made using dermatophyte test medium for culture. Hair and crust material from infected sites can be plucked and placed on culture; however, the 'toothbrush' method is more effective for sampling multiple sites. The brush is used to comb hairs and scales from several infected sites and then pressed into the culture media. Media plates should be visually inspected daily for 14 days. Positive cultures will become red at the same time as growth of a fluffy white colony. Microscopic examination of hairs and scales to visualize fungal elements can be done using skin scrapings in 20% KOH or mineral oil; however, this method is not very sensitive. Topical and systemic therapy should be initiated together after all suspected areas are clipped to reduce spreading of contaminated fragile hairs. Wholebody topical therapies with antifungal shampoos, rinses, and creams are recommended rather than spot treatment. Systemic therapy can be achieved with griseofulvin, ketoconazole, itraconazole, or fluconazole. Due to the highly infective nature of this disease, animals should be isolated and the environment thoroughly disinfected. Chlorhexidine and Virkon \u00ae S are ineffective at clearing environmental spores, but lime sulfur (1:33), enilconazole (0.2%), and bleach (1:10) are effective across many strains of Microsporum canis (Moriello and DeBoer, 2002) .",

The majority of cases of canine hypothyroidism are due to lymphocytic thyroiditis, an autoimmune disorder, or idiopathic atrophy of the thyroid gland. Lymphocytic thyroiditis is the major cause of hypothyroidism in laboratory beagles and appears to be familial in that breed (Tucker, 1962; Beierwaltes and Nishiyama, 1968; Manning 1979) .

            "text": "Clinical Signs Because it affects metabolism in general, hypothyroidism can produce a large number of clinical signs referable to many organ systems. An individual dog with hypothyroidism may have one or any combination of clinical signs. Hypothyroidism reduces the dog's metabolic rate, which then produces such signs as obesity, lethargy, cold intolerance, and constipation. Additionally, hypothyroidism can produce several dermatologic abnormalities, including nonpruritic, bilaterally symmetrical alopecia, hyperpigmentation, seborrhea, and pyoderma (Avgeris et al., 1990; Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Panciera, 1994) . Several clinicopathologic abnormalities have also been reported in a large percentage of hypothyroid dogs. These aberrations include increased serum cholesterol and triglycerides due to a decrease in lipolysis and decreased numbers of low-density lipopolysaccharide receptors (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Panciera, 1994) . Normocytic, normochromic, nonregenerative anemia may be seen in approximately one-half of the cases (Avgeris et al., 1990) . Increased serum alkaline phosphatase and creatine kinase have also been reported in a significant number of hypothyroid dogs (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Panciera 1994) . Neurologic signs of hypothyroidism, which include lameness, foot dragging, and paresis, may be caused by several mechanisms such as segmental nerve demyelination or nerve entrapment secondary to myxedema (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989) . Mental impairment and dullness have also been reported in hypothyroid dogs, secondary to atherosclerosis and cerebral myxedema (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989) . Hypothyroidism has been implicated in other neurological abnormalities such as Horner's syndrome, facial nerve paralysis, megaesophagus, and laryngeal paralysis; however, these conditions do not always resolve with treatment (Bichsel et al., 1988; Panciera, 1994) , and a true causal relationship with hypothyroidism has not been completely defined (Panciera, 1994) . Myopathies associated with hypothyroidism are caused by metabolic dysfunction and atrophy of type II muscle fibers and can present with signs similar to neurological disease (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989) . Hypothyroidism can also cause abnormalities of the cardiovascular system including bradycardia, hypocontractility, increased vascular volume, and atherosclerosis (Seguin and Brownlee 2012) . Abnormalities that may be detected by ECG include a decrease in P-and R-wave amplitude (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989 ) and inverted T waves (Panciera, 1994) . These ECG abnormalities are caused by lowered activity of ATPases and calcium channel function.",

T 4 serves primarily as a precursor for T 3 and is heavily protein bound. Free T 4 represents the LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE unbound fraction that is available to the tissues (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989) . The measurement of total T 4 carries a sensitivity of around 95% and can be used as a good screening tool. With the measurement of both serum total T 4 and free T 4 , hypothyroidism can usually be ruled out if the values are within the normal range or higher. If both hormone concentrations are low, it is highly likely that the patient has hypothyroidism, and a therapeutic trial may be in order (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989) . However, nonthyroidal illnesses and some drugs (e.g., glucocorticoids, anticonvulsants, phenylbutazone, salicylates) can falsely lower these values (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Ferguson, 1994) . Therefore, low values do not always indicate that hypothyroidism is present and animals should not be treated solely on the basis of serum hormone levels if clinical signs are not present. If the clinical signs are equivocal or only total T 4 or free T 4 is decreased, further diagnostic testing is warranted (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989) . Although T 3 is the most biologically active form of thyroid hormone, the measurement of serum T 3 levels is an unreliable indicator of hypothyroidism (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Ferguson, 1994) . Serum T 3 can be falsely lowered by many nonthyroidal illnesses and many drugs (see above). In addition, T 3 may be preferentially released and conversion of T 4 to T 3 may be enhanced by the failing thyroid (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Ferguson, 1994) , particularly early in the disease. In one study, T 3 was within normal limits in 15% of the hypothyroid dogs (Panciera, 1994) . Autoantibodies can be responsible for false elevations in the concentrations of T 3 and T 4 found in these respective assays. It has been recommended that free T 4 , measured by equilibrium dialysis, be assayed in dogs that are suspected of hypothyroidism and have autoantibodies with normal or high T 3 and T 4 . Autoantibodies have been found in less than 1% of the samples submitted to one laboratory (Kemppainen and Behrend, 2000) .",

In humans, endogenous thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH) levels provide reliable information on thyroid status, and an assay is available for dogs. However, endogenous TSH levels can be normal in some dogs with hypothyroidism and high TSH levels have been noted in normal dogs and sick animals that are actually euthyroid. It is therefore recommended that TSH levels be considered along with other information (clinical signs, T 4 ) prior to diagnosis and treatment (Kemppainen and Behrend, 2000) . TSH stimulation testing using exogenous bovine TSH provides a good and reliable method for establishing a diagnosis. Unfortunately, the availability and expense of TSH limit the use of this diagnostic tool (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Ferguson, 1994) . Another drawback of TSH testing is that the test must be postponed for 4 weeks if thyroid supplementation has been given (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989) . When TSH is available for testing, there are several recommendations for dosage, routes of administration, and sampling times. One recommendation is 0.045 U of TSH per pound of body weight (up to a maximum of 5 U) to be administered IV. For this protocol, blood samples are taken prior to administration of TSH and 6 h after. A normal response to the administration of TSH should create an increase of T 4 levels at least 2 \u03bcg/dl above the baseline levels or an absolute level that exceeds 3 \u03bcg/dl (Peterson and Ferguson, 1989; Wheeler et al., 1985) .",

If drugs that decrease thyroxine levels are being administered concurrently, it may be necessary to divide the thyroxine dose for twice daily administration. After the supplementation has begun, the thyroid hormone level should be rechecked in 6-8 weeks, and blood samples should be drawn 4-8 h after the morning pill. A clinical response is usually seen in 6-8 weeks and would include weight loss, hair regrowth, and resolution of other signs (Panciera, 1994) .

In general, obesity occurs when the intake of calories exceeds the expenditure of energy, the result of overeating or eating an unbalanced diet. Overeating is a common cause of obesity in pet dogs and may be triggered by boredom, nervousness, or conditioning (MacEwen, 1992) . In addition, pet animals are often subjected to unbalanced diets supplemented with high-fat treats. In the laboratory animal setting, overeating is less likely than in a household because access to food is more restricted, and diets are usually a commercially prepared balanced ration. However, obesity can still be a problem if specific guidelines for energy requirements are not followed. In addition, the necessary caging of dogs in the research environment and limitation to exercise reduces energy expenditure. It is also important to realize that other factors may predispose dogs to obesity, even when guidelines for caloric intake and energy LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE expenditure are followed (Butterwick and Hawthorne, 1998) . As in humans, genetics plays an important role in the development of obesity in dogs, and certain breeds are more predisposed toward obesity. In a study of dogs visiting veterinary clinics in the United Kingdom, Labrador retrievers were most likely to be obese. Other breeds affected included Cairn terriers, dachshunds, basset hounds, golden retrievers, and cocker spaniels. The beagle was also listed as a breed predisposed to obesity in the household environment (Edney and Smith, 1986) .",

The ideal body condition for dogs is considered to be achieved when the ribs are barely visible but easily palpated beneath the skin surface. When the ribs are not easily palpated and/or the dog's normal function is impaired by its weight, the animal is considered obese. There are few objective, quantifiable methods for establishing this diagnosis. Ultrasound has been evaluated for measurement of subcutaneous fat in dogs, and measurements taken from the lumbar area can be used to reliably predict the total body fat (Wilkinson and McEwan, 1991) . After a diagnosis of obesity has been made, additional diagnostic tests should be performed to determine if there is an underlying cause for the problem. A complete physical exam should be performed to look for signs of concurrent disease and to establish if obesity has adversely affected the individual. Serum thyroid hormones should be evaluated (see above), and serum chemistry may reveal an increased alkaline phosphatase associated with hyperadrenocorticism.",

Ideally, weight loss will occur at a rate of 1-2% of body weight per week (Laflamme et al., 1997) .

Alternatively, several diet dog foods are available, and there is some evidence that these diets are superior to simple volume restriction (MacEwen, 1992) . There has been much concern about the addition of fiber to the diet as a method for reducing caloric intake while maintaining the volume fed. Studies in dogs have examined the addition of both soluble and insoluble fibers to calorie-restricted diets. These studies have shown that the addition of fiber does not have an effect on satiety in dogs and therefore does not have a beneficial effect in weight loss protocols (Butterwick et al., 1994; Butterwick and Markwell, 1997) .",

When first recognized, the wound should be covered with a sterile dressing until definitive treatment can be rendered. Bleeding should be controlled with direct pressure; tourniquets are discouraged because of the complications that may arise with inappropriate placement (Swaim, 1980) . It is best to avoid using topical disinfectants in the wound until further wound treatment (culture, debridement, lavage) has been performed (Swaim, 1980) . Anesthesia or analgesia may be necessary and the choice of agent will depend on the size and location of the wound as well as the preference of the clinician. If the wound is contaminated or dirty, bacterial cultures, both aerobic and anaerobic, should be performed. Then a water-soluble lubricant gel may be applied directly to the wound to prevent it from further contamination during the hair removal process. A wide margin of hair should be clipped and a surgical scrub performed around the edges of the wound. Povidone-iodine alternating with alcohol or chlorhexidine gluconate scrub alternating with water is most often recommended for surgical preparation of the skin surface (Osuna et al., 1990a, b) . Simple abrasions that involve only a partial thickness of the skin do not generally require further treatment. Full-thickness wounds require further attention, including irrigation with large quantities of a solution delivered under pressure. Several irrigation solutions have been recommended (Lozier et al., 1992; Waldron and Trevor, 1993; Sanchez et al., 1988) , but type may not be as important as the volume and pressure of delivery.

Skin that is obviously necrotic should be removed. Although it is often recommended to remove skin back to the point at which it bleeds, this may not be feasible with large wounds on the limbs. In addition, other factors such as edema or hypovolemia may reduce bleeding in otherwise viable skin (Waldron and Trevor, 1993) . If one is unsure about tissue viability in areas that are devoid of Waldron and Trevor (1993) . extra skin, the tissue may be left (Swaim, 1980; Waldron and Trevor, 1993) , and nonviable areas will demarcate within 2-3 days (Waldron and Trevor, 1993) . Necrotic fat should be resected liberally, because it does not have a large blood supply and will provide an environment for infection. Often, resection of subcutaneous fat is necessary to remove debris and hair that could not be removed during wound irrigation. Damaged muscle should also be liberally resected (Swaim, 1980) . The wound should be irrigated several times during debridement and again after completion. After initial wound treatment, the options concerning wound closure must be weighed. The principles of basic surgery are discussed in several good texts, and readers are encouraged to pursue additional information. Primary wound closure is defined as closure at the time of initial wound therapy and is the treatment of choice for clean and clean-contaminated wounds. Closure is performed in two or more layers, carefully apposing tissues and obliterating dead space. If dead space will remain in the wound, a drain should be placed. Subcutaneous closure should be performed with absorbable suture such as polydioxanone, polyglactin 910, or polyglycolic acid. It is best to use interrupted sutures and avoid leaving excess suture material in the wound. It may be necessary to choose tension-relieving suture patterns, such as horizontal mattress. Skin closure is generally performed with nylon (3-0 or 4-0).",

After debridement and irrigation, the wound should be bandaged. The wound may be covered by a nonadherent dressing such as vaseline-impregnated gauze (Swaim, 1980) . The contact layer is covered by cotton padding, and the entire bandage is covered by a supportive and protective layer. The bandages should be changed once or twice daily, depending upon the amount of discharge coming from the wound. Wound closure within 3-5 days of wounding (prior to the formation of granulation tissue) is considered delayed primary closure. When the wound is closed after 5 days, this is considered secondary closure (Waldron and Trevor, 1993) . Second-intention healing involves allowing the wound to heal without surgical intervention. This type of healing is often used on limbs when there is an insufficient amount of skin to allow complete closure (Swaim, 1980) . It is important to note that second-intention healing will take longer than with surgical repair, and, in the case of large wounds, it will be more expensive because of the cost of bandaging materials.",

When wounds are clean or clean-contaminated, antibiotics are seldom necessary unless the individual is at high risk for infection. When wounds have been severely contaminated or are dirty, antibiotics are indicated and the type of antibiotic will ultimately depend on culture and sensitivity results. Until such results are available, the choice of antibiotic is based on the most likely organism to be encountered. Topical application of bacitracin, neomycin sulfate, and polymixin B combinations may be used in wounds with minor contamination. In skin wounds with more extensive contamination, Staphylococcus spp. are generally of concern, whereas Pasteurella multocida should be considered in bite wounds. When systemic antibiotics are necessary, cephalosporins, amoxicillinclavulanate, and trimethoprim sulfas are often recommended for initial antibiotic therapy (Waldron and Trevor, 1993) .",

When wounds involve deeper tissues, including fat, fascia, or bone, more aggressive diagnostics and therapy must be performed.

All of the damaged tissue should be debrided and basic wound management guidelines should be followed (see above).

One of the most important aspects of treatment is to break the cycle of self-trauma. Mechanical restraint with an Elizabethan collar is one of the easiest methods to accomplish this goal. Several direct treatments have been examined, including intralesional and topical steroids, perilesional cobra venom, acupuncture, radiation, and surgery (Swaim and Angarano, 1990; Walton, 1986) . Opioid antagonists have been applied as treatments for acral lick granulomas and self-injurious behaviors with the theory that this will block the effects of endogenous opioids. Naltrexone and nalmefene have been used successfully to reduce excessive licking behaviors and resolve associated lesions. However, lesions did recur after the drugs were discontinued (Dodman et al., 1988; White, 1990) . The topical administration of a mixture of flunixin meglumine, steroid, and dimethyl sulfoxide has also been shown to be effective (Walton, 1986) . In addition, psychoactive drugs have been suggested to relief of LABORATORY ANIMAL MEDICINE boredom or anxiety. These have included phenobarbital, megestrol acetate, and progestins. However, side effects have been reported (Swaim and Angarano, 1990) . Other behavior-modifying medications such as clomipramine may be effective in the treatment of compulsive anxiety disorder. The potential for effects that could interfere with experimental results must be determined prior to initiation of treatment. It is important to note that none of the above-mentioned treatments have been successful in all cases. The overall prognosis for acral lick granuloma should be considered guarded since the lesions often recur when treatment is discontinued.",

Conservative management of the elbow hygroma is aimed at relieving the source of pressure at the point of the elbow. In early and mild cases, simply providing padding to cover hard surfaces will result in resolution of the hygroma. A soft padded bandage or doughnut bandage around the affected site may also be of benefit. Neoprene/polyester sleeves that cover the elbows and fit over the shoulders are also available as an option for either prevention or treatment of hygromas (Cannap et al., 2012) . More aggressive therapies, including needle drainage and injection of corticosteroids into the hygroma, have been described but are not recommended due to the risk of infection (Johnston, 1975) . Surgical options should be reserved for complicated or refractory cases. Even simple excision can be associated with complications such as wound dehiscence and ulceration (Johnston, 1975) due to the location of the bony prominence at the surgical site. This issue may be avoided by using a skin advancement flap (White, 2003) that allows intact, healthy skin to cover the boney prominence. A muscle advancement flap has also been described (Green et al., 2008) . Regardless of the method used to treat an elbow hygroma, recurrence of the problem is likely unless the predisposing factors are identified and relieved.",

Localized abscesses or sinus tracts may be managed by establishing drainage and copious flushing. Aerobic and anaerobic cultures of blood and locally infected sites should be performed prior to initial treatment (Ringler and Peter, 1984) . Systemic antibiotic therapy should be initiated for a 10-day period. The choice of drug will ultimately be based on previous experience and culture results. If retention of a catheter is important, the catheter lumen may be safely disinfected with chlorine dioxide solution (Dennis et al., 1989) . The solution is removed after 15 min and replaced with heparinized saline. All of the extension lines and fluids used with an infected catheter should be discarded. The blood cultures should be repeated 3 days after the antibiotic therapy has ceased. If bacteria are still cultured, the catheter must be removed.",

Catheters and other implants should be made of nonthrombogenic material and be as simple as possible. A catheter with extra ports or multiple lumens requires additional management and supplies more routes for infection. The initial placement of an indwelling catheter must be done under aseptic conditions by individuals who are familiar with the procedure. Intravenous catheters that are used for delivery of drugs or blood sampling should be positioned in the vena cava and not in the right atrium, thereby minimizing trauma to the tricuspid valve. Ideally, catheters are secured to reduce movement and irritation of the skin, which may predispose to infection around external ports. The use of vascular access ports that lie entirely under the skin eliminates many problems with infection. It has also been found that long extension tubing connected to the port may actually reduce the potential for infection of the catheter (Ringler and Peter, 1984) . For intestinal access ports, catheter security may be improved with a synthetic cuff added to the end of the catheter allowing better attachment to the intestine (Meunier et al., 1993) . After any catheter placement, animals should be observed daily for signs of either local or systemic infection. The catheter entry site should be disinfected, coated with antibiotic ointment, and rebandaged every other day. Once a month, the catheter line may be disinfected with chlorine dioxide. In addition, a solution of the antibiotic ceftazidime used on alternate days with the heparin locking solution has been shown to effectively reduce infections in indwelling vascular catheters (Bach et al., 1998) .",

Systemic blood pressure and cardiac output will be increased or within the normal range. The animals will often be febrile. Later in the course of the syndrome, the animals may show classic signs of septic shock including decreased temperature, pale mucous membranes, and a prolonged capillary refill time.

However, extreme inflammation without infection (e.g., pancreatitis, trauma) may create similar signs. One study examined the diagnosis of sepsis in canine patients at a veterinary hospital based on easily obtainable physical and laboratory findings. That study found that septic individuals had higher temperatures, WBC counts, and percentage of band neutrophils than nonseptic individuals, whereas platelet counts were lower in the septic dogs. There were no differences in respiratory rate or glucose levels between the groups. Using these criteria, the results had a high sensitivity and a tendency to overdiagnose sepsis (Hauptman et al., 1997) . Ultimately, the presence of a septic focus simplifies diagnosis greatly; however, the focus may not be obvious. If the signs of sepsis are evident but the focus is not, several areas should be evaluated for infection, including the urinary, reproductive, respiratory, alimentary, and cardiovascular systems, as well as the abdominal cavity (Kirby, 1995) .",

In cases of doxorubicin extravasation, signs may develop up to a week after the injection, and the affected area may progressively enlarge over a 1-to 4-month period.

The material safety data sheet for the substance should be consulted for any possible neutralization protocol. Additional treatment will depend upon the severity of the tissue damage and will follow the same guidelines as for the thermal injury described earlier. For the treatment of perivascular injections, dilution of the drug with subcutaneous injections of saline is recommended. In addition, steroids may be infiltrated locally to reduce inflammation. Topical application of dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) may also be helpful in reducing the immediate inflammation and avoiding the development of chronic lesions. The addition of lidocaine to subcutaneous injections of saline has been used in cases of thiacetarsemide injection (Hoskins, 1989) . The local infiltration of hyaluronidase accompanied by warm compresses has been suggested for perivascular vinblastine (Waldron and Trevor, 1993) and for doxirubicin. The use of DMSO or another free radical scavenger, dexrazoxane, infused at the site has also been suggested for doxorubicin toxicities. Despite these treatments, necrosis of skin may be observed and would require serial debridement of tissues with secondary wound closure or skin grafting. In cases of doxorubicin extravasation, early excision of affected tissues is advocated to prevent the progressive sloughing caused by sustained release of the drug from dying tissues (Swaim and Angarano, 1990) . In all cases, the condition can be painful and analgesia should be addressed.",

The material safety data sheets should be available for all compounds and storage recommendations followed closely. For intravenous administration of toxic compounds, insertion of an indwelling catheter is extremely important. Prior to the injection, the catheter should be checked repeatedly for patency by withdrawal of blood and injection of saline. Any swelling at the catheter site or discomfort by the subject indicates that the catheter should not be used. Access to a central vessel such as the cranial or caudal vena cava is preferred over the use of peripheral vessels. When peripheral catheters are used, the injection should be followed by a vigorous amount of flushing with saline or other physiological solution and removal of the catheter. Additional injections are best given through newly placed catheters in previously unused vessels.

Depending upon grade, immunophenotype, and location involved, dogs with MHGL usually present with painless, enlarged lymph nodes and nonspecific signs such as anorexia, weight loss, polyuria, polydypsia, fever, and lethargy. When the liver and spleen are involved, generalized organomegaly may be felt on abdominal palpation.",

(1986) has become widely accepted. In this system, grade I has the best prognosis and are well differentiated, with round to ovoid, uniform cells with distinct cell borders. The nuclei are round and regular, the cytoplasm is packed with large granules that stain deeply, and mitotic figures are rare to absent. Grade II (intermediately differentiated) mast cell tumors have indistinct cytoplasmic boundaries with higher nuclear-cytoplasmic ratios, fewer granules, and occasional mitotic figures. Grade III (anaplastic or undifferentiated) mast cell tumors have the worst prognosis. The cells contain large, irregular nuclei with multiple prominent nucleoli and few cytoplasmic granules. Mitotic figures are much more frequent. Cells are pleomorphic with indistinct borders. In addition to associated skin lesions (e.g., ulceration, collagenolysis, necrosis, and infection), mast cell tumors have been associated with gastric ulcers in the fundus, pylorus, and/or proximal duodenum, most likely secondary to tumor production of histamine. Histamine stimulates the H 2 receptors of the gastric parietal cells, causing increased acid secretion. Gastric ulcers have been observed in large numbers (>75%) of dogs with mast cell tumors (Howard et al., 1969) .",

Aspiration or surgical removal of regional lymph nodes is recommended if lymphatic tumor drainage is suspected. If the tumor is not completely resectable or is grade II or III (moderately to undifferentiated), then debulking surgery and adjunct therapy may be used. Treatment algorithms are outlined elsewhere (Withrow et al., 2013) Research Complications Because of the potential for systemic release of substances such as histamine, vasoactive substances, heparin, eosiniphilic chemotactic factor, and proteolytic enzymes, along with the possibility of delayed wound healing and tumor recurrence, dogs with mast cell tumors are not good candidates for research studies. Grade I mast cell tumors may be excised, allowing dogs to continue on study; however, monitoring for local recurrence should be performed monthly. Grade II tumors are variable; animals that undergo treatment should be monitored for recurrence monthly, and evaluation of the buffy coat should be performed every 3-6 months for detection of systemic mastocytosis. Because of the poor prognosis for grade III tumors, treatment is unwarranted in the research setting.",

In pure cases of BPH, castration results in involution of the prostate gland detectable by rectal palpation within 7-10 days. For most dogs in research studies, this is a viable option to rapidly improve the animal's condition. The alternative to castration is hormonal therapy, primarily with estrogens. This may be applicable in cases where semen collection is necessary from a valuable breeding male (e.g., genetic diseases). If the research study concerns steroidal hormone functions, then neither the condition nor the treatment is compatible. Finasteride, a synthetic 5\u03b1-reductase inhibitor, has been used in dogs to limit the metabolism of testosterone to 5\u03b1-dihydrotestosterone. Treatment at daily doses of 0.1-0.5 mg/kg orally for 16 weeks was shown to reduce prostatic diameter and volume without affecting testicular spermatogenesis (Sirinarumitr et al., 2001) . Upon discontinuation of finasteride, the prostate generally returns to its pretreatment size within several months (Smith, 2008) . Gonadotropin-releasing hormone analogs such as desorelin inhibit production of testosterone and estrogen via negative feedback on the hypothalamus-pituitary axis. This is available in a sustained release subcutaneous implant, which has demonstrated efficacy in reducing prostatic size in dogs (Junaidi et al., 2009) . However, medical therapy has not shown to be as advantageous as castration.",

The cellular composition of these nodules is predominantly neutrophils, but it can also consist of lymphocytes, plasma cells, or macrophages (Snyder et al., 1995) . Fibrinous thrombosis of the affected arteries is also seen.

However, surgical reduction or excision of the affected gland is typically required to resolve the condition. In the reduction procedure, the prolapsed gland is sutured to fibrous tissue deep to the fornix of the conjunctiva (Helper, 1989 ). If reduction is not possible (as with deformed nictitating cartilage) or is unsuccessful, removal of the gland can be performed. Such excision is fairly straightforward and can be done without removal of the nictitating membrane itself. The gland of the third eyelid is important in tear production; although the rest of the lacrimal glands should be sufficient for adequate tear production, keratoconjunctivitis sicca is a possible consequence after removal of the gland of the nictitating membrane.",
