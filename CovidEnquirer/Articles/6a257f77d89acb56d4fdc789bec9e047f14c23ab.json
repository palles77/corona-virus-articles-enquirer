In this study, the Large Eddy Simulation was utilized to predict the effects of thermal plume of different intensities on particle diffusion. Three postures of the human body model and three room temperatures were considered. The results show that the convective heat transfer coefficient on the surface of the human body varies greatly with different postures. The coefficient is the largest when the model is in sitting posture, leading to the greatest heat transfer rate. Meanwhile, the thermal plume generated by bending the thigh increases the size of the facial thermal plume in horizon direction. The increase of the difference between indoor temperature and skin temperature causes an increase of the convective heat transfer of the manikin, leading to stronger airflow in front of the face. The thicker and faster the human thermal plume is, the more difficult it is penetrated by aerosols produced by nasal breathing, finally resulting in most particles distributed within 0.2 m thick under the roof.",

            "text": "Indoor Air Quality (IAQ) is closely related to the health of building occupants, since on average, people spend more than 70 % of their time in homes, offices and other indoor environments (Zhong, Lee, & Haghighat, 2017) . Nevertheless, the spread of infectious diseases in the indoor has seriously affected the IAQ and human health. Airborne transmission is the primary mode of transmission of many diseases such as tuberculosis, severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS) and influenza (Milton, 2012; Roy & Milton, 2004) . The main feature of airborne transmission is that microbes can move along the air flow and consequently infect other people in a long distance. Infectious microbes can be released through a variety of mechanisms, such as physical contact and human respiratory behaviors (Xu & Liu, 2018; Tellier, 2006; Xu, Nielsen, Liu, Jensen, & Gong, 2017) . The particle sizes of these released microbes are different, resulting in atypical movement patterns (Jurelionis et al., 2015; Xie, Li, Chwang, Ho, & Seto, 2007) . Microbial droplets larger than 10 \u03bcm in diameter deposit rapidly due to gravity (Jiang, Yao, Feng, Sun, & Liu, 2017) , while microbial aerosols smaller than 10 \u03bcm in diameter evaporate and shrink to droplets nuclei, with their particle size further reduced. These fine microbial aerosols could follow the indoor air currents and survive for long time (Lai, Cheng, & Lim, 2005; Morawska, 2006) . They diffuse around people in the air and enter people's upper respiratory tract along with their respiratory airflow, which will eventually settle in the trachea or bronchus of mortal body (Koullapis, Kassinos, Bivolarova, & Melikov, 2016; Thomas, 2013) . Some microorganism aerosols with extremely small diameter can be directly deposited in the alveoli of human body (Hinds, 1999) . Accordingly, the accumulation rather than effective removal of contaminants indoors can bring harm to occupants' well-being (Hesaraki, Myhren, & Holmberg, 2015) .",

            "text": "Respiratory behavior is the most common behavior of human to release microbial aerosol, which mostly releases aerosols with particle size range of 0.3-1.3 \u03bcm (Morawska et al., 2009; Papineni & Rosenthal, 1997; Wan, Wu, Chen, Huang, Wang, & Chen, 2014) . These particles can be easily absorbed into the lower respiratory tract and therefore increases the risk of infection. When patients with communicable diseases release harmful aerosols through respiration in offices, wards, operating rooms and other places, the risk of infection of surrounding people will be increased. Therefore, it is of vital importance to better understand the diffusion behavior of aerosols generated by human respiration in order to reduce the risk of infection of susceptible population sharing the indoor environment. of an airborne infectious disease. Human thermal plume (TP), as an important part of human microenvironment, has been widely studied by researchers (Licina, Pantelic, Melikov, Sekhar, & Tham, 2014; Melikov, 2015; Zukowska, Melikov, & Popiolek, 2012) . Human TP refers to the airflow rising along the boundary of the human due to the temperature difference between the surface of the human and the surrounding air and the thermal buoyancy of the air. The maximum speed of TP is usually about 0.45 m above the head, with a value of about 0.24 m/s (Craven & Settles, 2006; Li, Liu, Wang, Jiang, & Cao, 2017; S\u00f8rensen & Voigt, 2003) . TP carries particles from the lower part of the body into the respiratory area (Brohus & Nielsen, 1996) , and also prevent particles generated by human respiration from penetrating out (Nielsen, Buus, Winther, & Thilageswaran, 2008) . Human TP may have a positive impact on the diffusion of aerosols in a ventilated room, as it may make the dispersion of particulate matter more intense (Salmanzadeh, Zahedi, Ahmadi, Marr, & Glauser, 2012) . Many previous studies have shown that the TP has a significant impact on the diffusion of particles. However, the quantitative relationship between the intensity of the TP and the degree of influence on particles has seldom been studied. The TP at higher room temperature has different characteristics from that at lower room temperature (Ge, Li, Inthavong, & Tu, 2013; Voelker, Maempel, & Kornadt, 2014) , so it may have distinct effects on the diffusion law of particles. Therefore, the study of different intensities of TP is of huge significance to the study of the diffusion of aerosol produced by respiration. Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) simulation is an economical and effective method to solve fluid flow problems. With the improvement of computer power, Large Eddy Simulation (LES) turbulence model has attracted the attention of computational fluid mechanists and related areas researchers in recent years. And good application results have been obtained in various fields (Hu, Ohba, & Yoshie, 2008; Riber, Moureau, Garc\u00eda, Poinsot, & Simonin, 2009; Tian, Tu, Yeoh, 2006) . In this study, the LES turbulence model was used to predict the motion of particulate matter produced by human sine breathing by considering three common postures which are standing, sitting and lying, as well as three room temperatures which are 24 \u2103, 27 \u2103 and 30 \u2103. This study provides theoretical insights and data support for ventilation design.",

Larger-scale vortices have a profound influence on the average flow, such as the diffusion of turbulence, the exchange of heat, mass, and momentum. While small-scale vortices mainly play a role in dissipating function and affect various variables through dissipation pulsations. The shape and boundary conditions of the flow field influence the large-scale vortex. So, it has obvious anisotropy, while the small-scale vortex is almost not subject to the boundary conditions and flow field size, having approximate isotropy. Therefore, it is easier to establish a general model to simulate. LES distinguishes the large eddy from the small eddy, simulating large eddies by the direct solution to the Navier-Stokes (N-S) equation, and small eddies in the universal subgrid model.",

The underlying assumption is the local equilibrium between the transferred energy through the grid-filter scale and the dissipation of kinetic energy at small subgrid scales. The subgrid-scale turbulence can be better modeled by accounting for the transport of the subgrid-scale turbulence kinetic energy.

Respiratory boundary conditions of this study are determined according to the previous experimental results, and the exhalation angle is shown in Fig. 3(a) . The function of respiratory velocity against time is a sine function, expressed as V = \u22122.8 sin (1.04t), where V is respiratory velocity, m/s; t is time, s. The above equation is obtained by simplifying the experimental results, and the simplification process is shown in Fig. 3(b) and (c). We added the above equation to the nostril boundary condition using the User-defined function, so that the nasal breathing speed changes following the sinusoidal curve. The air density is approximated by Boussinesq, and the settings of other boundary conditions are shown in Table 3 . The time step is defined as 0.02 s, and the solution method adopted the Pressure Implicit with Split Operator algorithm, and the maximum number of iterative steps is set at 20.

            "text": "It is necessary to verify the accuracy of the LES turbulence model before the study. Voelker et al. (2014) used four measurement and statistical methods to conduct experimental studies on human TP, providing effective data for our comparison. In addition, the RNG kepsilon model is also compared. All the settings for the RNG k-epsilon model were the same as those for the LES, and the near wall treatment was set as the standard wall equation, taking full buoyancy effect into account. The velocity and temperature results on the line 2 in Fig. 4 in the case of sitting manikin at room temperature for 24 \u2103 and 27 \u2103 are used to compare with the experimental results. The continuous results of 60 s-65 s in the simulation are averaged, and the comparison results are shown in Fig. 5 . The velocity and temperature results of both LES and RNG models fits well to the experimental results. The minor mismatches may be caused by the difference between the simulation and the human model used in the experiment. When looked in detail, LES model seems to be better than the RNG model. Table 4 shows the area and heat flux of different areas of manikin in 9 cases. There are many ways of heat dissipation, such as radiation heat dissipation and convection heat transfer. The TP is mainly caused by convective heat transfer. The heat flow generated by convective heat transfer is shown in the table. Room temperature and posture affect the heat transfer rate to some extent. The greater the difference between human surface temperature and indoor temperature is, the greater the total heat transfer rate will be. When the room temperature is 24 \u2103, the heat transfer rate of manikin in case 1, case 4 and case 7 are 15.82 W, 26.46 W and 19.48 W, respectively. When the room temperature is 30 \u2103, the heat transfer rate of manikin in case 3, case 6 and case 9 are 4.98 W, 7.19 W and 6.29 W, respectively. The different postures mainly lead to the different convective heat transfer coefficients between the manikin surface and the air, which leads to the difference in the total heat transfer rate. Among the three postures, the convective heat transfer coefficient of the body surface is the largest in the sitting posture and the smallest in the standing posture. Fig. 6 shows the TP velocity contours and vector diagram of case 1, case 2 and case 3. The TP velocity is getting lower by increasing the room temperature. The maximum TP velocity is at a height of 0.45 m above the head, which is the same as previous experimental and simulation studies (Craven & Settles, 2006; Li et al., 2017; S\u00f8rensen & Voigt, 2003) . The maximum velocity value is 0.293 m/s when room temperature is 24 \u2103, and the smaller velocity value is 0.22 m/s and 0.19 m/s when room temperature is 27 \u2103 and 30 \u2103, respectively. Fig. 7 shows the results of the interaction between respiratory airflow and TP produced by the standing manikin. The velocity vector diagram of airflow generated in the exhalation process of breathing under the influence of TP is shown in Fig. 7(a) . The influence of TP on respiratory airflow is very great. When the airflow jets from the nostril at a distance of 5 cm, it moves upward and form a small vortex in front of the face. Three kinds of airflow at room temperature, namely exhalation airflow as pure breathing, pure TP and mixed airflow of two kinds of airflow, are projected on the X-axis along the velocity value of breathing direction and compared, the results are shown in Fig. 7(b) . The TP velocity near the body surface also decreases with the increasing of room temperature. The values of case 1, case 2 and case 3 are 0.15 m/s, 0.09 m/s and 0.05 m/s, respectively. The thickness of the TP at three cases is similar, which attenuates from about 0.28 m to less than 0.025 m/s. When the room temperature is 24 \u2103 and 27 \u2103, the respiratory airflow is greatly affected by TP. When the room temperature is 30 \u2103, whether there is TP or not, the respiratory airflow has a similar attenuation trend. Fig. 8(a) shows the distribution of particles generated by standing manikin at 60 s at different room temperature. The lateral diffusion of the particles is not violent. Most of the particles mainly follow the direction of TP upward diffusion. The lower the room temperature is, the more particles are concentrated near the roof. The higher the room temperature is, the more particles are concentrated in front of chest with the manikin. To describe the distribution of this motion, the distribution of the number proportion and concentration of particles along the vertical direction is shown in Fig. 8(b) . Due to the high concentration of particles around the nostrils in 30 s, the particle diffusion results in 60 s is adopted. The results show that at room temperature of 24 \u2103, the number of particles in the range of 2.3-2.5 m accounts for 45 G. Feng, et al. Sustainable Cities and Society 54 (2020) 101935 % of the total. While at room temperature of 30 \u2103, 11.5 % of the particles are distributed near the roof, and 70 % of the particles are distributed in the height range of 0.9-1.9 m. The diffusion distribution of particles at room temperature of 27 \u2103 is similar to that at room temperature of 24 \u2103. For the maximum concentration of particulate matter, the condition of 24 \u2103 at room temperature and 27 \u2103 at room temperature appeared near the roof. However, the maximum concentration of particulate matter at room temperature of 30 \u2103 is in the range of 1.1-1.3 m. The maximum concentrations in case 1, case 2 and case 3 are 2.74e-9 kg/m 3 , 2.28 e-9 kg/m 3 and 9.85 e-9 kg/m 3 , respectively. Fig. 9 shows the TP velocity contour and vector diagram of case 4-6 at 60 s. Similar to standing case, TP velocity decreases as room temperature increases. The difference is that the maximum TP velocity in all three kinds of room temperatures is at a height of 0.65 m above the head. Maximum value at 24 \u2103 is 0.314 m/s. It should be noted that the TP in front of the face and chest produced by the sitting manikin is G. Feng, et al. Sustainable Cities and Society 54 (2020) 101935 thicker than it is in the standing posture, due to the interference caused by leg flexing. Fig. 10 shows the interaction between respiratory airflow and TP in the sitting manikin. Similar to the results of the standing manikin, respiratory airflow generates a vortex in front of face, and the loss of kinetic energy leads to a rapid decline in the exhalation velocity. The velocity value in the direction of exhalation is compared with TP and exhalation airflow of three kinds of room temperature in Fig. 10(b) . The velocity of TP in front of the face is similar to that of standing case. However, after a short decline, the velocity of TP at room temperature of 24 \u2103 and 27 \u2103 rises to 0.17 m/s and 0.13 m/s respectively at 0.15 m from the human surface, which is due to the positive effect of leg bending on the chest TP. As a result, the TP increased in thickness to about 0.36 m in the sitting posture, 28 % thicker than 0.28 m in the standing posture. At room temperature of 30 \u2103, like standing posture, the influence of TP is still small. Fig. 11(a) shows the indoor distribution of particles generated by sitting human respiration for 30 s. The colder the room temperature is, the more particles are clustered around the roof, while others spread diagonally in front of the body. TP from bending thigh are responsible for the lateral diffusion of these particles. Fig. 11(b) shows the distribution of the number proportion and concentration of particles in the vertical direction. Similar to the distribution results of particles generated by standing manikin, when the room temperature is 24 \u2103 and 27 \u2103, the majority of particles gather near the ceiling, which is a range of 2.3-2.5 m high. However, this ratio is much higher than standing, reaching 72 % and 56 %, respectively. When the room temperature is 30 \u2103, the particles tend to gather in the height range of 1.1-1.3 m, and the number of particles on the roof counts for only 9 %. The concentration distribution of particulate matter is similar to that of standing posture. Fig. 12 shows the velocity contour and vector diagram of the TP generated by the lying manikin. The velocity of the plume increases with the difference between the manikin's surface temperature and room temperature. The maximum value of TP appears at the height of about 1.3-1.5 m above the manikin, and the maximum values of three kinds of room temperature are 0.256 m/s, 0.205 m/s and 0.159 m/s, respectively. The maximum speed and range of the TP produced by the lying body are much smaller than those of the previous two positions. Because the lying position does not provide the process of TP accumulation. Fig. 13(a) shows the results of the velocity direction of TP and respiratory airflow in the lying manikin. It can be seen from the figure that the respiratory airflow only slightly changes the flow direction angle under the influence of the TP. Three kinds of air flows at room temperature, namely exhalation flow in pure breathing, TP flow and mixed air flows of two kinds of air flows, are projected on the Z-axis along the breathing direction for comparison, and the results are shown in Fig. 13(b) . At three kinds of room temperatures, the velocity of TP near the skin was 0.75 m/s, 0.4 m/s and 0.5 m/s, respectively, which was much smaller than the other two postures. The TP produced by the Feng, et al. Sustainable Cities and Society 54 (2020) 101935 manikin in the lying position is similar to the flow direction of the respiratory airflow. The exhaled air flows for some distance and then mixes with the TP to move upward. Fig. 14(a) shows the diffusion results of the particulate matter generated by lying flat human breathing at 30 s. The particle is released from the nostril, travels in the direction of the airflow to the chest, and then diffuses upwards. The diffusion velocity of the particle is directly related to the airflow velocity of TP. The higher the velocity is, the farther the diffusion distance is, and the larger the diffusion velocity is. The particles produced by lying on your back spread more widely than the other two positions because of the larger range of TP. Similar to the distribution of the particles in the first two positions, the lower the room temperature is, the more the particles diffuse upward. However, despite the fact that at room temperature of 30 \u2103, the proportion of particles near the roof is still very high, at 32 %. The particulate matter near the roof counts for 61 % and 58 % in case 7 and case 8, respectively. The distribution of particle concentration has the same rule as the distribution of particle number. Maximum concentrations in case 7-9 are all found near the roof 3.4e-10 kg/m 3 , 1.9e-10 kg/m 3 and 1.5e-10 kg/m 3 , respectively.",

According to Newton's law of cooling, convection heat transfer is determined by the difference between solid surface temperature and fluid temperature and the convection heat transfer coefficient. According to the heat flow results in this study, the thermal conductivity per unit area of different postures is different at the same room temperature. For example, when the room temperature is 24 \u2103, the heat flux of the manikin in three postures is 10.63 W/m 2 , 16.55 W/ m 2 and 13.09 W/m 2 , respectively.

At the same room temperature, the thermal conductivity of a sitting body is 1.6 times than that of a standing body. But the TP velocity near the surface of the body in the two positions is not significantly different. When the room temperature is 24 \u2103, the TP velocity near the surface of the sitting body is 0.15 m/s, with the same value which is 0.15 m/s for the standing posture. The influence range of the three poses is very different. Here, the influence range is defined as the cross-sectional area of the plane XOY. The influence range of the TP generated by the lying manikin is the largest, followed by the sitting posture and finally the standing posture. Another factor that affects thermal conductivity is the room temperature. The difference in thermal conductivity at room temperature is very large. However, the difference of thermal conductivity caused by the difference of room temperature mainly affects the TP velocity near the manikin surface, but has little effect on the influence range of the TP.

Therefore, according to the diffusion law of particulate matter, the selection of appropriate ventilation can reduce its indoor stay time. When the room temperature is 24 \u2103 and 27 \u2103, the distribution of particulate matter generated by standing and sitting for human respiration is characterized by a higher concentration and more quantity near the roof. In order to eliminate these particles, the primary task of ventilation is to prevent the particles from returning to the breathing area, and the second is to effectively organize the airflow distribution around the roof to remove the vast majority of pollutants. Therefore, it is possible to produce positive effects by applying the displacement ventilation in the above situation. At room temperature of 30 \u2103, the TP of manikin has very little influence on respiratory airflow, and the particle hardly changes with the movement track of respiratory airflow. Sitting and standing manikin at this room temperature particle tends to gather in the chest, producing a higher concentration. In this case, it is more efficient and energy saving to deal with the distributed particles by local exhaust. The particles produced by people lying flat on their backs are usually more evenly distributed, with no particularly high concentration areas. In this case, mixed ventilation can reduce the overall concentration of particulate matter in the room and achieve the effect of energy-saving.",
