We previously reported that clinical isolates of HCoV-229E preferred cell-surface TMPRSS2 to endosomal cathepsin for cell entry, and that they acquired the ability to use cathepsin L by repeated passage in cultured cells and were then able to enter cells via the endosomal pathway. Here, we show that clinical isolates of HCoV-OC43 and -HKU1 preferred the cell-surface TMRRSS2 to endosomal cathepsins for cell entry, similar to HCoV-229E. In addition, the cell-culture-adapted HCoV-OC43 lost the ability to infect and replicate in air-liquid interface cultures of human bronchial tracheal epithelial cells. These results suggest that circulating HCoVs in the field generally use cell-surface TMPRSS2 for cell entry, not endosomal cathepsins, in human airway epithelial cells.",

HCoV-229E enters cells via two distinct pathways: the endosomal pathway using cysteine protease to activate spike (S) protein and the cell-surface or early endosome pathway using extracellular proteases for activation. Studies using the ATCC isolate suggest that HCoV-229E enters cells via the late endosome using cathepsin L to cleave S protein, although it can enter cells via the cell surface or early endosome in the presence of transmembrane protease serine 2 (TMPRSS2) or trypsin (Bertram et al., 2013; Kawase et al., 2009) . It has been thought that this is a general feature of HCoV-229E entry. However, we recently reported that clinical isolates of HCoV-229E preferred the cell-surface or early endosome pathway to the late endosome pathway for cell entry (Shirato et al., 2017) . The ability of a clinical isolate of HCoV-229E to use cathepsin L was originally low, but it became able to use cathepsin after repeated passage in HeLa cells (Shirato et al., 2017) . This suggests that in natural situations HCoV-229E enters respiratory epithelial cells via the cellsurface or early endosome route and that the character of ATCC VR-740 has been changed by repeated passage in cultured cells.",

Using this system, HCoV-HKU1, which had previously been reported from sequence data, was first isolated (Pyrc et al., 2010) , and it was later shown that all four HCoVs could be isolated upon HBTE-ALI cell culture . In the present study, we found that field isolates of HCoV-OC43 and HCoV-HKU1 could be isolated using HBTE-ALI cell culture, and we then used these clinical isolates to assess whether the mode of virus entry found in HCoV-229E was also in play in other HCoVs.",

Recently, the circulating HCoV strain in Japan has been biased toward HCoV-OC43 (Hara and Takao, 2015; Matoba et al., 2015; Yano et al., 2014) . Therefore, we did not obtain specimens positive for HCoV-229E or HCoV-NL63; however, four HCoV-OC43 and two HCoV-HKU1 isolates were finally isolated successfully (Table 1 ). The sequences of S protein were analyzed and deposited in GenBank (accession nos. LC315646 to LC315651). The number of cycles of real-time RT-PCR to which virusisolated specimens were subjected ranged from 18.25 to 26.71, and isolation was considered failed when more than 30 cycles were used (data not shown). This suggests that at least 10 4 copies of viral RNA are required for successful isolation by HBTE-ALI culture.",

The isolate at that time had been passed in suckling mouse brain and cell culture, and finally became widely used as a laboratory strain (ATCC VR-1558). As previously described, the entry mechanism of the clinical isolate of HCoV-229E differed from that of the cell-cultureadapted laboratory isolate, ATCC-VR740; the clinical isolate preferred the cell-surface TMPRSS2 route to the endosomal cathepsin route preferred by the ATCC isolate (Shirato et al., 2017) . Therefore, we evaluated differences in infectivity and replication in culture cells or HBTE-ALI culture using VR-1558 and the clinical isolate (SGH-36/ 2014) (Fig. 1) . In HCT-8 cells, VR-1558 infected and replicated well, as expected. On the other hand, the amounts of SGH-36/2014 virus entering HCT-8 cells were much lower than the amounts of VR-1558, and replication of SGH-36/2014 was about 10 5 lower than that of VR-1558 (Fig. 1a) . In HBTE-ALI culture, the result was completely reversed; SGH-36/2014 infected the cells and replicated well as expected. In contrast, VR-1558 could infect the HBTE-ALI culture. Though the amount of entered virus was much lower compared to SGH-36/2014, no viral RNA was detected in the cell wash 3 days after infection (Fig. 1b) . This indicates that VR-1558 infected the HBTE-ALI culture with low efficiency, but it failed to produce progeny virus. In the previous report, a 20-times-passaged clinical isolate of HCoV-229E exhibited changes that allowed it to replicate well in HeLa cells, but its ability to replicate in HBTE-ALI culture decreased relative to that of the original isolate (Shirato et al., 2017) . The present study indicates that the phenomenon seen in HCoV-229E is also present for HCoV-OC43; namely, cell-culture-adapted virus cannot replicate in HBTE-ALI culture, which mimics human airway epithelial cells.",

The former route can be inhibited by the serine protease inhibitor camostat, and the latter by the cysteine protease inhibitor EST (E64D) Shirato et al., 2017 Shirato et al., , 2013 . To evaluate the entry routes of clinical isolates of HCoVs, viruses were inoculated onto HBTE-ALI in the presence of EST or camostat (10 \u03bcM) and the amounts virus that entered were estimated by detecting subgenomic mRNAs using real-time RT-PCR (Fig. 2) . First, the effect of inhibitor treatment on cell viability was determined in all cells. The treatments did not affect survival of the cell cultures at this concentration (Fig. 2a) . Infection of HCoV-OC43, VR-1558, was inhibited only by EST and not by camostat (Fig. 2b ). This indicates that VR-1558 enters cells via the late endosome pathway using cysteine proteases and it does not use TMRPSS2 for cell entry in HBTE-ALI culture. In contrast, clinical isolates of HCoV-OC43 were inhibited by camostat but were either not inhibited or were only partially inhibited by EST ( Fig. 2c-f ). In the case of SGH-36/2014, EST increased entry (Fig. 2c) . For clinical isolates of HCoV-HKU1 (similar to HCoV-OC43), entry was inhibited only by camostat and EST tended to increase entry ( Fig. 2g and h) . As shown in Fig. 2a , treatment with inhibitors did not affect cell viability. This suggests that the reduced infection of VR-1558 by EST and clinical isolates by camostat were induced by the inhibition of proteases, not K. Shirato et al. Virology 517 (2018) 9-15 inhibitor treatment. These data are identical to those derived using HCoV-229E (Shirato et al., 2017) and suggest that the clinical isolates of HCoVs that cause human infections enter cells via the cell-surface or early endosome pathway using cell-surface proteases such as TMRSS2.",

The expression of TMRSS2 in HBTE-ALI and HCT-8 cultures was confirmed by mRNA quantitation (Fig. 3a) . The expression of TMRPSS2 mRNA was found in Calu-3 and LoVo cells, which are known to be susceptible to Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS) coronavirus (Shirato et al., 2013; Tao et al., 2013) . TMRPSS2 expression was highly up-regulated and was prominent among cells tested in differentiated HBTE-ALI cultures. In HCT-8 cells, TMRPSS2 mRNA was detected, but the expression level was lower than in immature HBTE cells. Almost no TMRPSS2 was detected in HeLa cells. This suggests that the reduced infection and replication of HCoV-OC43 clinical isolates in HCT-8 cells were caused by the low level of TMPRSS2 expression relative to HBTE-ALI cultures.",

It is difficult for the viruses to grow in commonly used cultured cells, which have only the late endosomal pathway. To date, some HCoVs have been isolated using cell culture as described above, but it may be that these results were rather accidental. Sometimes, particular features of the cultured cells may have affected the results, and, at other times, quasispecies may have been selected because of their ability to use cathepsins for cell entry. Such forced selection does indeed produce HCoVs, but the character of the viruses is changed from their natural state.",

            "text": "In this study, inhibition of the late endosomal pathway by EST increased the entry of some clinical virus isolates. This suggests that cell entry via the late endosomal pathway induces some anti-viral host immunity. Indeed, Bertram et al. (2013) reported that expression of interferon-induced transmembrane proteins (IFITMs) that inhibit diverse enveloped viruses also inhibited the entry of pseudotyped virus bearing HCoV-229E S protein, and that the reduced entry was rescued by co-expression of TMRPSS2. It is thought that IFITMs exert antiviral effects at the late stage of entry (Desai et al., 2014; Li et al., 2013; Munoz-Moreno et al., 2016) . Thus, entering cells via endosomal cathepsins seems not to afford advantages for virus survival. Therefore, HCoVs circulating in the field may have evolved to not use the late endosomal route with cathepsins to avoid such unfavorable reactions by host cells. In addition, HCoV-OC43 used cathepsins for entry into the cultured cell line HCT-8. However, in this study EST treatment could not inhibit viral entry completely, even at a high concentration (100 \u03bcM). Previously, we reported that the siRNA-mediated gene knockdown of cathepsin L could not inhibit the entry of HCoV-229E completely, suggesting that other proteases are also used by HCoV-229E in the process of infection (Kawase et al., 2009) . Moreover, treatment with EST, camostat, and leupeptin in WI-38 and MRC-5 cells (human fetal pulmonary fibroblasts without TMPRSS2 expression), did not inhibit infection by MERS-CoV and HCoV-229E. This suggested that proteases other than cysteine, serine, and threonine might be used for entry into these immature cells (Shirato et al., 2013) . Therefore, although cathepsins are used during the entry process of HCoV-OC43 in HCT-8 cells, proteases other than cathepsins and TMRPSS2 are also used for the activation of S protein (like other human coronaviruses). Development of the HBTE-ALI cell culture method allowed successful isolation of HCoVs, probably in their natural state Pyrc et al., 2010) . For the development of antiviral drugs, it is necessary to understand virus characteristics, and isolation of the virus is the first step. Therefore, it is important to isolate a virus that has natural characteristics. Madu et al. (2009) reported that a common motif (very highly conserved region, VHCR) is found in the S protein of coronavirus and may be a possible fusion peptide. It was thought that recognition sites for cleavable proteases might exist around the fusion peptide. In a previous study, we showed that the two amino acids that differ between laboratory and clinical isolates of HCoV-229E (R642M and N714K) were the determinants of the difference in cell entry route. These sandwich the VHCR, and were therefore not thought to be protease recognition sites. However, substitution of these two amino acids between the laboratory and clinical isolates completely changes (inverts) their cathepsin L use during cell entry (Shirato et al., 2017) . This implies that some structural modification of S protein caused by the two amino acid mutations affects the accessibility of cathepsin L to its true recognition site. As shown in Fig. 4 , only two remarkable amino acid differences were seen between the laboratory and clinical isolates of HCoV-OC43 (G766R and L981P). The G766R mutation is in the furin recognition site, and it may affect sensitivity to furin. Park et al. (2016) reported that MERS coronavirus had different entry processes dependent on whether S protein was cleaved by furin. If S protein was cleaved by furin before cell entry, entry was sensitive to cell-surface proteases and MERS entered the cell by the early endosome. Yet the virus that had un-cleaved S protein was trafficked through cellsurface proteases and into the late endosome. They also reported that these un-cleaved viruses were less infectious to human airway epithelial and Calu-3 cell cultures (Park et al., 2016) . Indeed, all clinical isolates of HCoV-OC43 retain the furin cleavage site (Fig. 4) , and the data from this study show that their infectivity was dependent on the expression of TMPRSS2. This idea supports the findings in this study because the clinical isolates of HCoV-OC43 with cleaved S protein selected the cellsurface TMRPSS2 route for entry and were sensitive to cleavage by cell surface proteases.",

In addition, the cell-culture-adapted HCoV-OC43 lost the ability to infect and replicate in HBTE-ALI cell culture, which mimics the natural situation of HAE. These results indicate that clinical isolates of HCoVs from the field generally enter cells not via late endosomes with cathepsins but via the cell surface or early endosomes with TMPRSS2. In addition, this study suggests that virus adaptation in cultured cells after isolation alters the route of cell entry and that such modified isolates might not reflect the HCoVs of the natural world. The strain HCoV-OC43 (VR1558) was obtained from the ATCC and propagated and titrated using RD cells (ATCC CCL-136). Clinical isolates of HCoV-OC43 and HKU1 were isolated using HBTE-ALI culture. Nasal swabs were obtained from outpatients in a hospital in Tokyo, Japan between 2014 and 2016, after approval of the National Institute of Infectious Diseases Ethics Review Board for Human Subjects. The specimens were subjected to respiratory virus testing by real-time RT-PCR (Kaida et al., 2014) . HCoV-positive specimens were inoculated onto HBTE-ALI cultures, and after 4 h incubation were washed with DMEM twice and incubated at 34\u00b0C. After incubation for 3 days, cells were washed four times with DMEM containing 1% (v/v) fetal calf serum, which was then used as virus stocks. Virus replication was confirmed by calculating RNA copy numbers using real-time RT-PCR as described earlier (Dare et al., 2007; van Elden et al., 2004) and comparing them to those in the washings after virus adsorption. Isolated viruses and the relevant RT-PCR results are listed in Table 1 . The sequences of the S proteins were obtained using Sanger's method and alignment analysis was performed using GeneDoc software (https:// www.nrbsc.org/gfx/genedoc/ebinet.htm).",
