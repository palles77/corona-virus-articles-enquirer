We compared the results between All16 and Anyplex II RV16 (Any16) in 426 clinical samples. Samples showing discrepancies between the two tests were further tested using monoplex PCR. FluA subtyping based on the hemagglutinin type results of All16, which yielded H1, H3, and non-H1/H3, was compared with the results of the BioFire FilmArray respiratory panel. The positive and negative percent agreements and kappa value for each virus between All16 and Any16 ranged from 54.5-100.0%, 84.7-100.0%, and 0.57-1.00, respectively. FluA subtype results from All16 for 26 samples were consistent with those from FilmArray. Good agreement was observed between the two methods, except when analyzing human enterovirus (kappa value 0.70), and the All16 showed reliable FluA subtyping results. For parainfluenza virus 3, the All16 was more sensitive than Any16. When testing 28 samples simultaneously, the mean test time and hands-on time were 4.3 and 0.5 hours, respectively in All16. In conclusion, All16 showed reliable performance, but further studies are needed regarding human enterovirus analysis.

However, the goldstandard methods for detecting viral infections, non-molecular methods, have critical limitations such as the requirement of labor-intensive and complex procedures and time-consuming steps [1, 2] . Therefore, in many instances, cell culture is no longer considered the gold-standard method, and molecular assays have become the standard of care for diagnosis [1, 3] . Multiplex real-time PCR is useful for diagnosing respiratory viral infections because the process time is faster than that of viral culture, it detects multiple pathogenic viruses simultaneously, and it is reli-able [3] .",

It covers adenovirus (AdV); coronavirus 229E (229E), coronavirus NL63 (NL63), and coronavirus OC43 (OC43); FluA and influenza B virus (FluB); human bocavirus 1/2/3/4 (HBoV); human enterovirus (HEV); human metapneumovirus (MPV); human rhinovirus A/B/C (HRV); parainfluenza virus 1 (PIV1), parainfluenza virus 2 (PIV2), parainfluenza virus 3 (PIV3), and parainfluenza virus 4 (PIV4); and respiratory syncytial virus A (RSVA) and respiratory syncytial virus B (RSVB). Additionally, it is a one-step PCR assay and is therefore much simpler than other commercial multiplex PCR assays for respiratory viruses. Thus, we evaluated the performance of All16 compared with Anyplex II RV16 (Any16, Seegene), which also detects 16 viruses without FluA subtyping.

The mean times required for DNA extraction and PCR preparation using MICROLAB Nimbus IVD and PCR itself were 2.4 and 1.9 hours, respectively, and both analyses required less time than Any16. Both multiplex RT-PCR assays, All16 and Any16, are based on tagging oligonucleotide cleavage and extension technology, but All16 utilizes MuDT technology. Multiplex real-time PCR typically requires either multiple fluorescence channels or a melting curve analysis step after amplification [5, 6] . The MuDT technology saves time because the melting curve analysis step is unnecessary. A 2.2-hour reduction in the test time for All16 is achieved, regardless of the sample number, compared with Any-16; this finding reflects the application of MuDT and a one-step process, including PCR and cDNA synthesis, in All16 compared with the two-step analysis, including PCR amplification after cDNA synthesis, used in Any16. Reduction of the hands-on time, workload, and test time because of the simple one-step analysis with MuDT used in All16 is helpful in clinical laboratories.",

Any16 detected more positive results for HEV than that by All16. The analytical sensitivity of All16 is reported as 50 copies/\u03bcL, except for when PIV1 is analyzed, yielding a sensitivity of 10 copies/reaction, and when PIV4 and MPV are analyzed, with a sensitivity of 10 3 copies/reaction [7] . In contrast, the sensitivity of Any16 under the same conditions is approximately 6 copies/ \u03bcL [8] . Based on the manufacturer's package inserts, the analytical sensitivities of Any16 and All16 are 50 copies/reaction and 100 copies/reaction, respectively. Therefore, HEV results were consistent with the package inserts. Additionally, Any16 involves a two-step analysis with PCR following cDNA synthesis. Separation of the cDNA synthesis step from PCR might have influenced HEV RNA purity or extraction, but other RNA virus results were inconsistent with this. Therefore, we speculate that the results were likely due to primer competition.",

For comparison with Any16, 250 samples showing negative results and 150 samples showing positive results in Any16, totaling 400 consecutive clinical samples from January to June 2016, were tested except samples with insufficient volume. For further evaluation of FluA subtyping, 26 more samples with FluA positivity by Any16 from January to February 2017 were tested. All samples (including 226 pediatric samples and 174 adult samples, median patient age: 7 years; range: 0.1-94 years), were nasopharyngeal swabs (eNAT, Copan, Brescia, Italy). Nucleic acids were extracted and prepared for PCR using the STARMag 48 \u00d7 8 Virus Cartridge Kit (Seegene) and MICRO-LAB Nimbus IVD(Hamilton, Reno, NV, USA). All samples were first tested with Any16 followed by All16, according to the manufacturer's instructions. Samples showing discrepancies between the two tests were further analyzed using monoplex real-time reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR), with the same primer pairs as for All16 and Any16, and the FluA genotyping results of All16 were compared with hemagglutinin gene sequencing results. FluA subtyping results of the 26 samples with FluA positivity in All16 were compared with the results of the BioFire FilmArray respiratory panel (FilmArray, BioFire Diagnostics, Salt Lake City, UT, USA).",
