When an outbreak has started and the approximation that the population is fully susceptible no longer holds, one generally refers to the effective reproduction number R. The value of R 0 is, as a rule, different for different infectious agents and depends among other things on the characteristics of the population that the agent invades. Given this, it is not immediate that one can adopt previously determined values or size ranges for a new outbreak, unless many of the complicated characteristics of, for example, population composition and contact structure are comparable. For various reasons one can be interested in the value of R 0 or R early in an outbreak and during the outbreak. Notably, under a homogeneous mixing assumption, the values give insight into the extent of the control problem and a means of calculating how much control effort is needed.",

Some, like Wallinga and Teunis [24] do not need much data, but require knowledge of the generation time distribution. Most of these methods, however, are data-hungry: they either need contact information, use the whole outbreak time series (so are effectively retrospective measures), or increase in accuracy as the time series becomes longer. While several methods are promising many problems remain, and for various reasons. For example, we do not observe infections we observe detections, i.e. individuals (people, animals, farms, plants) exhibiting symptoms. There is then a possibly unknown incubation period distribution that convolutes the infection process into the observed process. Detections are not necessarily in the order of infection. Moreover, R 0 is a generation-based concept [12] , but generations are not observeda daily number of new detections is observed from possibly mixed generations. Early in the outbreak stochastic influences play a large role. Also, heterogeneity between individual infectivity and susceptibility and in contact pattern may cause the distribution of which R 0 is the mean to be highly skewed (e.g. [16] ). To make matters worse, we almost never have data from an uncontrolled situation -some control measures, effective or not, often operate from the moment of detection of the index case.",

As a rule, the cumulative incidence in outbreaks of an infectious disease is observed to initially grow approximately exponentially with time (and hence the incidence grows exponentially too). A frequently used approach is to fit an exponential function to the (cumulative) incidence and to use the approximate relationship R 0 \u2248 e r T G to estimate R 0 , where r is the exponential growth rate and T G is the observed mean generation interval of the epidemic. For r T G small the further approximation R 0 \u2248 1 + r T G is sometimes used. Many of the problems mentioned above apply to these estimates. For example, the 'real' value of r is not observed, not only because of control measures in operation but also due to the stochasticity in the early phase. In addition, the definition of the generation interval is not always consistently used and the method presupposes that the population is homogeneously mixing. Still, the method is easy and intuitive and one can wonder in which circumstances it would be a 'good' approximation, and how large discrepancies can be when these circumstances are not met. In this paper we investigate these questions.",

These may be used as estimates to construct a rectangular kernel for an integral equation model, or to derive rate parameters for a differential equation model. Examples of infectivity kernels with the same latent and infectious periods are shown in Fig. 1 . These kernels appear to be quite different, with the exponential kernel allowing some transmission of infection from time zero, and exhibiting a long infection tail. These features can lead to disparities in the results from modelling exercises. The transmission at early times mitigates against the success of control methods based on contact tracing, or any other method with inherent delays. The tail can lead to transmission appearing to continue in the model long after control measures should have eliminated the infection. The trapezoidal kernels also shown in Fig. 1 allow for some variability in the fixed and latent periods to be incorporated in the model. For example, the kernel shown as suitable for modelling influenza (Fig. 1a) is consistent with a latent period uniformly distributed between 1.2 and 2.0 days, and an infectious period of 4.0 days. The kernel shown as suitable for modelling SARS (Fig. 1b) is consistent with nobody being infectious before 4 days, everybody infectious by 7 days, everybody still infectious at 11 days and nobody infectious after 14 days; with the proportion infectious at intermediate times determined by linear interpolation. As well as allowing for some variability, the trapezoidal kernel has the advantage over the rectangular one that it is a continuous function, and this avoids problems with numerical schemes that do not allow discontinuities. Of course, if further information is available, then other distributions may be more appropriate. Figure 2 compares estimates of the basic reproduction number based on fixed (Fig. 2a, b) and exponentially distributed (Fig. 2c, d) infectious periods, R fix 0 and R exp 0 , respectively, with the estimates based only on mean generation interval, R \u2212 0 = 1+r T G and R + 0 = e r T G . The estimate R \u2212 0 is inaccurate whenever r T G is not small. Using the fixed infectious period model, R + 0 approximates R fix 0 when T E /T G is near to one, that is when the infection has a long latent period and a short infectious period. The estimate R \u2212 0 is an approximation to R exp 0 if either the latent period or infectious period are very short, but R + 0 is never a good estimator for R exp 0 and it's use is therefore inconsistent with an SEIR model.",

Note that for the model with a fixed infectious period, T G = T E + T I /2, but for the model with an exponentially distributed infectious period, T G = T E + T I . The inequality, and the results presented in Fig. 2 are derived on the assumption that T E and T G are the same in both models; T I is defined consistently with the model, and hence differs between models. This is in contrast to the distributions presented in Fig. 1 , which have the same latent and infectious periods, T E and T I , and hence different mean generation intervals T G . Table 1 shows results that could be obtained when estimating R 0 for emerging infections, with parameters suitable for these infections. The parameter values indicated for each infection should be regarded as sensible values rather than exact estimates, and the results are presented to indicate the relevance of Fig. 2 . For all four examples there is close agreement between R fix 0 and R trap 0 . This is not surprising for the influenza example where the trapezium kernel has steep sides (Fig. 1a) , but also applies for examples such as SARS (Fig. 1b) . The results in Table 1 confirm that if r T G is small, hence R \u2212 0 is close to one, then R \u2212 0 may be used as an estimator for R exp 0 when an exponential model is appropriate. If a model with a fixed infectious period is more appropriate then R + 0 is a better estimate for R fix 0 , especially when T E /T G is closer to one: compare for example the relative values of R + 0 and R fix 0 for smallpox where T E /T G = 0.73 and FMD where T E /T G = 0.33.",

When estimating kernels from data, one should be careful. Estimates made early in an epidemic are likely to be based on household studies, and may be truncated due to local saturation of contacts. In addition, it is unclear how valid such estimates are when extrapolated to the wider community with multiple levels of mixing.",

As a new infection emerges the appropriate model is speculative, and in any situation there is no such thing as the correct model. For example, in the context of pandemic influenza, Ferguson et al. [8] had T G = 2.6 and T E = 1.48 days, and estimated R 0 \u2248 R \u2212 0 , obtaining values in the range 1 \u2212 2. Their model was more complex than those discussed here, but we have seen that for low values of r T G , R \u2212 0 provides a reasonable estimate. Mills et al. [18] used an SEIR model, and estimated R from R exp 0 which is consistent with their model. Our approach is to advocate using an estimate of R 0 that is consistent with the model used to evaluate control strategies.",

Hence, given values of r , T E and T G , R (m,n) 0 is an increasing function of both m and n. In the limit as m and n tend to infinity, R (m,n) 0 tends to R fix 0 . Hence for all positive finite integers m and n, R exp 0 R (m,n) 0 < R fix 0 , completing the proof of inequality (8) .",
