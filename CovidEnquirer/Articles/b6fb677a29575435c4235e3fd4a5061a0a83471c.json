            "text": "Human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) is often acquired in individuals already infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) as a result of shared routes of transmission. Since current options for the treatment of HIV and HBV infections are limited, there is an essential need for the development of effective therapies against HIV/HBV co-infections. RNA interference (RNAi) has been used as a powerful tool to silence genes in cells and animals. In this study, we developed a small interfering RNA generation system that expressed two different siRNAs to target the HBs gene of HBV and the gp120 gene of HIV in Bel-7402 and HEK293T cells, respectively. Our results demonstrated that the two siRNA molecules could simultaneously inhibit the expression of HBs and gp120 by 81% and 89%, respectively. In addition, dual siRNA molecules significantly decreased the production of HBs, and simultaneously inhibited the replication of HBV and HIV. This dual siRNA generation system not only proved to be a novel approach for studying functions of multiple genes simultaneously, but also provides a potential approach for the treatment and prevention of HIV and HBV co-infection.",

Coinfection with HIV and hepatotropic viruses causes complex interactions (Hadler et al., 1991; McNair et al., 1992) . HIVinduced impairment of the cell-mediated immunity causes higher replication of hepatotropic viruses . Additionally, HBV leads to enhanced transcription of HIV through an NF-B element in the long terminal repeat of HIV (G\u00f3mez-Gonzalo et al., 2001) . More than 95% of adults spontaneously recover from an acute HBV infection (Beasley, 1988) , an outcome that is defined by clearance of the hepatitis B surface antigen (HBsAg) from blood. Those persistently infected with HBV are at increased risk of development of cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Hsu et al., 2002) . HIV-1 causes multidimensional immunosuppression, associated with reduced frequency of spontaneous recovery from HBV infection (Colin et al., 1999) . The impact of co-infections on the clinical outcome of HIV-infected patients is unclear and the available treatment options against these viruses are also limited (Shlomai and Shaul, 2003) .",

Specific inhibition of cellular mRNA by RNAi can be triggered in mammalian cells by the introduction of synthetic 21-23-nucleotide double-stranded small interfering RNA (siRNA) (Elbashir et al., 2001; Paul et al., 2002) or, alternatively, by the transcription of siRNA from a DNA construct driven by the RNA polymerase cassette (Brummelkamp et al., 2002) . RNAi is initiated by degradation of single-stranded RNA of identical sequences. Therefore, RNAi approach can be used to silence gene expression by directly targeting its specific sequence of mRNA. In addition to the widely used strategies for inhibiting gene expression in research work, RNAi approach has been used in therapeutic studies of human diseases including cancer and viral infectious diseases (Cioca et al., 2003; Zhang et al., 2003;  Verma et al., 2003) . The RNAi approach has been reported as an ideal tool to inhibit infectious virus replication in host cells because siRNA can target and silence important genes of the virus.",

            "text": "It has been shown that siRNA could specifically inhibit human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) replication and virus propagation through targeting major genes in the HIV life cycle, including p24, nef, rev, tat, and vif (Coburn and Cullen, 2002; Jacque et al., 2002; Lee et al., 2002; Capodici et al., 2002) . RNAi has also been used in the inhibition of replication of hepatitis B virus (HBV) or hepatitis C virus (HCV), which causes chronic liver disease including cirrhosis and hepatocellular carcinoma (Hamasaki et al., 2003; McCaffrey et al., 2003; Shlomai and Shaul, 2003; Kapadia et al., 2003) . It has been demonstrated that siRNA effectively protects human cells against poliovirus infection (Gitlin et al., 2002) and that siRNA could block retroviral infection in chick embryos and inhibit the growth of the Rous sarcoma virus and HIV in cell culture (Hu et al., 2002) . siRNA primarily prevented accumulation of the viral RNAs synthesized in the late stage of the infection, but did not degrade the RNA genome of the virus in the early stage of the infection. siRNA molecules generated against the HCV replicon inhibited the HCV mRNA transcripts and protein expression (Kapadia et al., 2003) . It has been found that siRNA inhibited severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus (SARS-CoV) gene expression and replication in cultured cells (He et al., 2003) .",

In this study, we extended our study by using this system to produce simultaneously two siRNA duplexes that targeted the S gene of HBV and the gp120 gene of HIV-1, respectively. To study the effects of dual RNAi on HBV gene expression and replication in a cell culture model, we used a derivative of the human HepG2 hepatoma cell line, HepG2.2.1.5, which has been stably transformed with several copies of the HBV genome and is used as an in vitro model for HBV replication. To study the effects of dual RNAi on HIV-1 gene expression and replication in mammalian cells, we used two HIV-1 expression vector pNL4-3 and pNL4-3.luc.R-E-. pNL4-3 is an HIV-based infectious vector and upon transfection this clone directed the production of infectious virus particles in a wide variety of cells. pNL4-3.luc.R-E-is a non-infectious HIV-1 recombinant clone, in which firefly luciferase gene was inserted into the pNL4-3 nef and two frameshifts (5 Env and Vpr aa 26) rendered this clone Env \u2212 and Vpr \u2212 and allowed only a single cycle of replication to transfect HEK 293T.

To efficiently screen siRNA molecules that target HIVgp120, selected targeting DNA sequences were fused in frame with the luciferase gene to generated plasmid pLucF-gp120 (Fig. 1A, Table 2 ), in which luciferase activity represented the level of HIVgp120 mRNA expression.

            "text": "The aim of this study is to design a siRNA expression system that expresses dual siRNAs to inhibit both HBV and HIV replication. In order to construct a useful tool in the selection of effective siRNA molecules, we created a quick screening system by fusing the targeted DNA and the luciferase reporter gene together to produce recombinant pLucF plasmid that could express HBs-luciferase or HIVgp120-luciferase fusion mRNAs. Therefore, we can initially select the suitable siRNA duplexes rapidly by simply analyzing the activities of luciferase. By using this approach, we have demonstrated that one of the siRNA molecules (HIVsiRNA3) had significant impact on the expression of HIV-luciferase fusion gene. This provides a quick approach to select effective siRNA in the study of gene expression and function analysis.",

The effects of dual siRNAs on HIV and HBV gene expression and viral replication were studied thoroughly by the analyzing the levels of viral protein production through enzyme-linked immunosorbent assays and the levels of viral RNA expression by semi-quantitated RT-PCR analysis. All results indicated that dual siRNAs had significant inhibitory effects on viral mRNA expression, viral protein production, or the replication of HIV and HBV.",

Our dual siRNA approach would provide a possible therapeutic strategy against co-infection of these viruses, although further studies are necessary to determine the antiviral mechanism of dual siRNAs in different stage of viral replication. Our approach could also be used to generate more than two siR-NAs duplexes that could silent more genes in order to study the interactions of genes and their functions. Such strategies of constructing multiple-siRNA vectors could confront multiple virus infections. Obviously, this \"cocktail\" siRNA approach could be applied, especially for those viruses that show a high mutation rate, such as HIV.",
