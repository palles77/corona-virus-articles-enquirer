            "text": "Most of human history is based on the movement of people from one place of residence to another, since it has been through this continued movement of populations that every part of the planet has been settled. Termed 'the great adventure of human life', 1 migration is the 60 million Europeans leaving their homes from the sixteenth to twentieth centuries and the 15 million Hindus, Sikhs, and Muslims swept up in the tumultuous shuffle of citizens between India and Pakistan after the partition of the subcontinent in 1947. The lure of land, a 'better life', and a safer habitat is perpetual -the so-called push and pull factors are enduring facts of human history. Migration has shaped our societies, and with all its entwined economic and political aspects has been called 'one of the greatest challenges of the coming century' (see Fig. 100 .1). 1, 2 Through improved transportation and communications, a growing world economy, and increasing social inequality, human migration has reached unprecedented levels. 3 The ease of movement and the rapid dissemination of information concerning opportunities to improve personal well-being mean that increasing numbers of countries are now points of origin, destination, or transit for migrants. Migration involves increasingly diverse populations moving rapidly between the sending and receiving locations, often with unequal social and physical environments that affect the health and well-being of those migrating. 4 Migration is not a minor influence on societies. In 1990 some 120 million people, two in every 100 people lived outside of the country of their birth. 5, 6 In 2006, there were 191 million international migrants in the world, representing 3% of the world population. In the USA, Hispanics comprise the vast majority of migrating workers, and in 2003 became the largest minority group in the country. 7 Figure 100 . 2 illustrates the increase over the past 40 years in the number of foreignborn people residing outside their country of birth. 8 Migration continues to be the result of social, political, and economic factors, as well as discrete environmental and political events such as natural disasters and humanitarian crises. The process of population mobility is regularly termed 'human migration' with a focus on the legal and administrative aspects of individual and group movement. Human migration is often perceived to be a slow and unidirectional process resulting in permanent resettlement. 4 However, human migration is a dynamic process and efforts to describe the phenomena and its impact often falter by focusing on discrete episodes. 9 Migration is a long-term process dotted with vital events and changing health status.",

            "text": "Remittances for example play an increasingly important role in the world economy. It is presumed that a large percentage of migrant remittances are delivered through unofficial channels, with total remittances believed to amount to more than US$100 billion. In 2004, India received some US$21 billion, the greatest amount of migrant remittances, followed by Mexico with US$18 billion (Fig. 100. 3). 10 Even as health issues are being raised more often in foreign policy discussions, focus continues to be on the legal or regulatory aspects of migration for those persons crossing international borders. 11 Considerable attention is given to migration from lowincome countries into high-income countries, with a notable emphasis on the overburdening of healthcare systems. Until recently there has been little concern about the health of persons emigrating from countries like the USA despite their capacity to spread disease. The impact of migrants returning to low-income countries with a communicable disease is starting to receive greater attention as sending countries study the epidemiology of disease within their own countries. For example, Mexico reports that the greatest risk factor for HIV infection among rural Mexicans is migration to the USA. Return visits to the country of origin are also an important consideration. A study in the United Kingdom demonstrated that children who were second-generation migrants of South Asian ethnic origin had a higher risk of TB than their Caucasian counterparts. One risk factor explaining this was frequent visits to their countries of out-migration, i.e. Bangladesh, India, and Pakistan. 12 Box 100.1 lists what travels with humans as they travel into new regions. 13 While human migration is fuelled by the desire to improve one's circumstances, it does not always mean that the movement is voluntary nor across international boundaries. Large groups of migrants move regularly between intracountry regions for a variety of reasons and varying periods of time. Some are looking for seasonal work; others migrate temporarily because of the nature of their work, e.g. truck drivers, transport workers, and fishermen. Others migrate for educational purposes, for health care, to escape environmental degradation, or to seek a safe habitat, e.g. internally displaced persons (IDPs). We should not underestimate the size of this seasonal 'migration' in volume (millions in the USA and Europe; Fig. 100.4) , or the problems related to poor access to health services of this population. 14, 15 While it is important to understand the motivations for and effects of migration, it can be more useful to consider that migration is 'a social process that links networks of people in a set of intimate relationships'. 9 These relationships allow for both the transfer of disease and the provision of services to interrupt disease transmission.",

However, in many refugee situations, outside agencies, such as the United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) or international non-governmental organizations (INGOs), come in to assist in the care of refugees, and services may be set up outside of the host nation's health services to provide healthcare for the refugees. Paradoxically in some 'stable' refugee situations, due to an influx of healthcare services from UNHCR and INGOs, services and indicators may actually be better inside the refugee community than in the host country's population. For example, in the Bhutanese refugee camps situated in eastern Nepal served by the INGO Save the Children (UK), antenatal care coverage was almost 100% (compared with Nepal figure of 44%), with 85% of deliveries attended by a trained health worker (cf. 33%), infant mortality rate (IMR) 62 per 1000 live births (cf. 98), and expanded programme on immunization (EPI) coverage of 95% (cf. 78%). 17, 18 In the more acute stages of refugee situations or where the situation remains ever unstable such as in recent times in the Darfur region of Sudan, morbidity and mortality rates are and may remain phenomenally high. 19 International migration is the category of human migration most often considered when the topic is discussed.

Additionally there are those individuals whose movement is regulated by international convention that recognizes refugees or asylum seekers. Along with unofficial international migrants, these individuals generate the largest amount of political controversy because of their documentation status and questions concerning their legal rights to services in the receiving location. In evidence are increasingly restrictive immigration policies and public hostility towards immigrants arriving in new locations as a result of resettlement programs. International social inequality and health disparity are significant policy challenges. 4 While all the population mobility described previously constitutes some form of human migration, the term migrant is most often connected to a labourer who moves in pursuit of employment ( Fig. 100.5 ). The working definition for 'migrant' used here is drawn from several sources and includes elements from the UN Convention on the Rights of Migrants, 20 and from the American Heritage Dictionary: 21 'A migrant is a person who crosses a prescribed geographic boundary by chance, instinct, or plan and stays away from their normal residences to engage in remunerated activity.'",

Because migrant workers are a mobile population with a shifting composition, the actual numbers are not reliably known. There is a common understanding that most migrants participate in multiple industries, particularly low-wage unskilled labour such as agriculture. They usually work in the sectors known as the '3D' jobs -dirty, dangerous, and demanding, 22 or as SALEPs -jobs that are shunned by all except the very poor. 23 Migrants in different industries are affected by similar health access factors, such as unfamiliarity with local health resources, inability to communicate in the local language, and ineligibility for publicly or privately funded health services. Their health status is also affected by environmental and occupational exposure to hazardous chemicals, dangerous and repetitive work activities, and unsanitary housing and working conditions. Migrant workers are a mobile, working, poor population that struggles with problems of healthcare access similar to those of other underserved populations, with the additional burden of having to search for new care options as they move. In addition, the desire by some to avoid contact with governmental agencies makes the access to healthcare even more complicated. Their mobility results in poor continuity of care, as they are often unable to complete medical treatments, keep track of their medical records, and obtain routine or preventive care. Mobility is both the reason for and one of the larger barriers to continuity of care.",

It has been shown that if migrants fear that going to a physician might lead to trouble with immigration authorities, then they are significantly more likely to delay seeking care for over 2 months, leading to disease progression in the individual migrant and an increased risk of continued transmission of TB infection to others. 33 An additional assumption is that migrants will not complete their treatment because of their 'migrating' status. Again blame for lack of services and/or adherence to treatment is placed on the migrants themselves and not the authorities.",

Compared to the difference in TB prevalence and incidence rates between low-and high-income countries, the difference between low-income countries is often less dramatic. For example, the estimated new smear-positive pulmonary TB incidence rates for Bangladesh, India, and Nepal at 102, 75, and 81 per 100,000, respectively, show little difference. 45 However, in the urban areas of lowincome countries, where most migrants live, the risk of TB transmission and infection is higher than the estimated national averages. A recently conducted survey of risk of TB infection in India found that infection rates in urban areas were consistently 1.5-2 times higher than in rural areas in all four zones of the country. 46 Therefore, the issues relating to migration between and within low-income, high-TB-burden countries are significantly different than those related to migration from low-to high-income countries.",

For example, across large parts of India, millions of its poorest citizens have on average only 130 days of work available locally. Eighty-five per cent of the Indian poor are either landless agricultural workers or marginal farmers. 47 They must migrate for survival, with the vast majority moving internally within India. According to official Government of India figures, over 98 million people migrated from one place to another within the country in the 1990s, the vast majority for employment. 48 Possibly the true migrant population in India is almost double this figure at around 180 million. 49 A similar pattern may be true for China where the migrant population in the country was estimated to be 140 million in 2000. 50 Within Nepal, from the 1991 Census data, almost 10% of the native population was estimated to migrate between districts. 51 It is also a little acknowledged reality that the majority (approximately 70%) of the world's refugees and IDPs are hosted in lowincome countries. 52 Unfortunately, apart from a number of studies in refugee situations, there is little research around the problem of TB in migrant populations in low-income country settings. [53] [54] [55] Liberalization of population movement and the economy in China have resulted in large numbers of people leaving the rural areas for the urban municipalities and rapid urbanization. The number of migrants in Beijing, China, increased rapidly from 2.8 million in 1994 to about 4 million in 2005. The majority of migrants are young and engage in unskilled manual labour. From 1993 to 2005, the proportion of TB cases who were migrants steadily rose from around one in 10 to just over one in three. 56 Two-thirds of the migrant patients were under 30 years of age compared to less than 30% of permanent residents. Cure rates were significantly worse amongst the migrants at only 37% compared to over 90% in permanent residents. Thus, migrants with TB pose a major challenge to the TB services, and to TB control, in Beijing.",

            "text": "A similar picture is seen in Vietnam with rapid urbanization and population movement, especially of men of working age, since the economic liberalization of the late 1980s. 57, 58 In a number of studies in the country, it has been observed that TB notification rates among the young, especially males, in urban settings increased, most notably in industrialized districts during the period 1990-2003. 59, 60 It is hypothesized by the authors that this is mainly due to poor living and working conditions and internal migration, although increasing HIV coinfection rates play a role. This limited impact of directly observed treatment, short course (DOTS), control measures is seen despite the National Tuberculosis Programme in Viet Nam having achieved the WHO targets of 70% of case detection and 85% cure from 1997 onwards -achievements predicted to reduce TB incidence rates by 11% per year in the absence of high HIV prevalence. 60, 61 A little considered form of migration in low-income, high-TB country settings is migration in order to seek healthcare, mainly in urban areas. Towns and cities in low-income countries, where the number of healthcare facilities is greatest and also where referral centres may exist, have a large 'pull' factor on people seeking healthcare. In a study in Kathmandu, Nepal, amongst a group of migrants who had TB, almost 40% had specifically moved there, seeking a diagnosis of their disease and medical care. They tended to delay longer in seeking healthcare than locals. 62 This pull factor is strongly seen at those medical colleges involved in the Government of India's Revised National TB Control Programme (RNTCP). A large number of patients are diagnosed at these medical colleges, but few actually receive their DOTS treatment from the medical college itself (Fig. 100.6 ). 63 Rather they are formally 'referred back' to receive their treatment at a health facility closer to their residence. Referral can be within the same district where the medical college is located, an adjacent district, a further district within the same state, or even a district in another state. Patients will migrate large distances to places where they perceive they will receive high-quality care, e.g. at medical colleges. The process of 'referral for treatment' across large distances presents major challenges to TB control programmes in order for them to provide seamless care for such patients. The risk of such patients defaulting post-diagnosis and prior to treatment is high unless a mechanism for referring them for treatment is being implemented by the TB control programme. In 2005, the RNTCP piloted such a referral for treatment in two states of India and demonstrated that it was possible to implement such a mechanism under programme field conditions in a low-income setting and provide seamless care to patients. The programme is now in the process of scaling the mechanism across the country and piloting an electronic referral for treatment information system. A similar system for referral of migrant patients undergoing treatment for active TB disease (TBNet) while migrating throughout the United States or from the USA to another country has been functioning since 1996. 64 ",

While it is important that high-income low-TBburden countries try to protect their own citizens against the importation of TB, their respective national control and regulatory systems alone will be unable to extend their immediate mandate or authority to the source of the problem. In addition, the usefulness of screening for TB among immigrants and the rationale for investing large amounts of money in a low-prevalence country have been questioned. 69 To be effective, the management of health issues resulting from population mobility will require a much closer integration of national and global health initiatives for both infectious and non-infectious disease conditions. 70 Certainly the advent of a TB vaccine, new medications with a shorter treatment period, and better diagnostic tools will find immediate application for use with international and intranational migrants.",

This would address the problem of TB amongst migrants at the source. In their 2005 paper, Schwartzman et al. concluded: the U.S. government's underwriting of the expansion of the DOTS strategy in Mexico, the Dominican Republic, and Haiti is the most effective long-term approach to reducing tuberculosis morbidity and mortality among migrants from those countries and would produce net savings in the United States. These projected domestic benefits should encourage the governments of developed countries to provide substantial and sustained funding for the control of tuberculosis abroad. 71 In a subsequent paper, the same group show that a modest investment of $4.2 million for DOTS expansion in Haiti would result in 63,080 fewer TB cases, 53,120 fewer TB deaths, and net societal savings of $131 million over 20 years. 72 The Haitian government is unlikely to be able to make even this modest investment into TB control activities, leading the authors to state 'Given this, and the substantial potential humanitarian, economic, and public health benefits, we conclude that foreign donors should strongly consider investing in DOTS expansion in Haiti.' 72 This would seem to be an example par excellence where all partners would win and a prime case of 'prevention being the cure'.",
