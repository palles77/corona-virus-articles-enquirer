For the existence of node's death would change the topology of global network, the characteristic of network with death rate is discussed. Then we study the epidemiology behavior based on the mean-field theory and derive the relationships between epidemic threshold and other parameters, such as modularity coefficient, birth rate and death rates (caused by disease or other reasons). In addition, the stability of endemic equilibrium is analyzed. Theoretical analysis and simulations show that the epidemic threshold increases with the increase of two kinds of death rates, while it decreases with the increase of the modularity coefficient and network size.",

            "text": "Based on the mean-field theory, many epidemic models, such as susceptible-infected (SI), SIS and susceptibleinfected-recovered/ removed (SIR), have been proposed to describe the epidemic spreading process and investigate the epidemiology. It has been demonstrated that a threshold value exists in the homogeneous networks, while it is absent in the heterogeneous networks with sufficiently large size [3] . Compared to the lifetime of individuals, the infectious period of the majority of infectious diseases is short. Therefore, in most of the epidemic models, researchers generally choose to ignore the impact of individuals' birth and death on epidemic spreading. However, in real life, some infectious diseases have high death rate and may result in people's death in just a few days or even a few hours, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS), Hemagglutinin 7 Neuraminidase 9 (H7N9) and the recent Ebola. And some infectious diseases may have longer spreading time, like HBV, Tuberculosis. Besides, on the Internet, nodes' adding and removing every time can also be treated as nodes' birth and death. In Ref. [4] , Liu et al. analyzed the spread of diseases with individuals' birth and death on regular and scale-free networks. They find that on a regular network the epidemic threshold increases with the increase of the treatment rate and death rate, while for a power law degree distribution network the epidemic threshold is absent in the thermodynamic limit. Sanz et al. have investigated a Tuberculosis-like infection epidemiological model with constant birth and death rates [5] . It is found that the constant change of the network topology which caused by the individuals' birth and death enhances the epidemic incidence and reduces the epidemic threshold. Zhang et al. considered the epidemic thresholds for a staged progression model with birth and death on homogeneous and heterogeneous networks respectively [6] . In Ref. [7] , an SIS model with nonlinear infection rate, as well as birth and death of nodes, is investigated on heterogeneous networks. In Ref. [8] , Zhu et al. proposed a modified SIS model with a birth-death process and nonlinear infection rate on an adaptive and weighted contact network. It is indicated that the fixed weights setting can raise the disease risk, and that the variation of the weight cannot change the epidemic threshold but it can affect the epidemic size.",

Chu et al. investigated the epidemic spreading in weighted scale-free networks with community structure [16] . In Ref.

The following simulation results are averaged over 100 configurations with different set of random numbers i n (i=1, 2,\u2026, m). And for each configuration, 200 simulations are taken with one randomly chosen seed node initially. Fig. 3 shows the time evolution curves of epidemic size, where \u03b2 equals to 0, 0.001 and 0.005 respectively. Some related parameters are N=1 000, m=10, K=10 000, Q=0.3, \u03bb=0.1, b=0.01, \u03b1=0.01 . It is shown that when \u03b2\u22600, the epidemic size increases to a peak value then decays to tend a stable value, otherwise the epidemic size keeps increase and finally reach a steady state. The existence of disease death rate can prevent the spread of the disease by decreasing the infected fraction directly. The maximum prevalence of epidemic spreading without considering nodes' disease deaths is the largest. In addition, larger \u03b2 corresponds to smaller stable epidemic size, which agrees well with the reality. Fig. 4 shows the critical epidemic value decreases with the increase of birth rate, while the epidemic prevalence increases with the increase of birth rate. The arrows in Fig. 4 indicate the theoretic epidemic threshold calculated through Eq. (17) . Eq. (17) clearly shows that the birth rate is inversely proportional to the critical value, which is consistent with the simulation results in Fig. 4 . In real life, with the increase of birth rate, the density of whole population and healthy proportion increases, which makes it easier for infectious disease to diffuse.",

The arrows in Fig. 5 and 6 indicate the theoretic epidemic threshold. Fig. 5 , \u03b2 constantly equal to 0.05. For some infectious diseases, such as acquired immune deficiency syndrome (AIDS), it is necessary to consider the situation of individuals' natural deaths. From Fig. 5 , we find that the existence of natural death rate \u03b1 is conducive to prevent the spread of the disease, and the increase of threshold and decrease of epidemic size are expected with the increase of \u03b1. Individuals' natural death decreases the density of total population, thus restrains the propagation of epidemic. The arrows in Fig. 5 indicate the theoretic epidemic threshold. Fig. 6 shows the effect of the existence of individuals' death caused by disease on epidemic threshold. The related parameters are b=0.005, Q=0.3, K=5 000, and \u03b1=0.005. By comparisons, it is found that the epidemic threshold increases with the growing of \u03b2, while the epidemic size decreases with the growing of \u03b2. The existing of disease deaths can rapidly reduce the number of infected individual in populations, thus the existence of disease death rate can inhibits the epidemic spreading.",

Fig. 7 The relationship between I\u221e and \u03bb with different modularity coefficient Q and edge number K This is because the infectious disease is mainly transmitted within the community, and when the propagation rate is sufficiently, the infectious disease spreads throughout the network through the edges between communities. The edge density of network with higher modularity coefficient is small, this is not conducive to the spread between communities, thereby reducing the spreading size of the entire network. In addition, the epidemic threshold has inverse correlation with the total edge number K. This is consistent with the real network circumstances.",

An approximate formula for the epidemic threshold is obtained by mathematical analysis to find the relative relationships between different parameters.

The simulations in this study illustrate that the epidemic threshold \u03bb increases with the increase of the death rate (natural death or disease death), while it decreases with the increase of the birth rate, modularity coefficient and edge number. Through this study, it is helpful to predict the spreading trend of some infectious diseases that may cause the deaths of individuals (such as Ebola and H7N9) more accurately than ever before.",
