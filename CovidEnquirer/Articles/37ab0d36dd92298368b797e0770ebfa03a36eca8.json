Notably, even direct intra-cardiac injections of naked AOs resulted in very low exon skipping. 7 And although clinical trials with 2\u2032OMe 8, 9 and PMO 10,11 chemistries have shown great promise, there is still a need for further optimization to improve AO delivery to all skeletal muscles and to the heart. This is critical as respiratory complications 12 and cardiac dysfunction 13 are the major causes of premature death in DMD patients. In particular the cardiomyopathy becomes clinically apparent at ~10 years of age, and is exhibited in all DMD patients by the age of 18. 13, 14 While some studies have shown that the restoration of dystrophin in respiratory muscles can improve cardiac function in the absence of restored dystrophin protein in the heart, 15, 16 there is concern that any improvement in skeletal muscle function in the absence of cardiac correction may worsen the cardiac disease progression due to increases in cardiac work load. [17] [18] [19] It is therefore highly desirable that future therapies endeavor to restore dystrophin in cardiac as well as in skeletal muscles.",

AOs modulate dystrophin pre-mRNA splicing, thereby specifically restoring the dystrophin reading frame and generating a truncated but semifunctional dystrophin protein. Challenges in the development of this approach are the relatively poor systemic AO delivery and inefficient dystrophin correction in affected non-skeletal muscle tissues, including the heart. We have previously reported impressive heart activity including high-splicing efficiency and dystrophin restoration following a single administration of an arginine-rich cell-penetrating peptide (CPPs) conjugated to a phosphorodiamidate morpholino oligonucleotide (PMO): Pip5e-PMO. However, the mechanisms underlying this activity are poorly understood. Here, we report studies involving single dose administration (12.5 mg/kg) of derivatives of Pip5e-PMO, consecutively assigned as Pip6-PMOs. These peptide-PMOs comprise alterations to the central hydrophobic core of the Pip5e peptide and illustrate that certain changes to the peptide sequence improves its activity; however, partial deletions within the hydrophobic core abolish its efficiency. Our data indicate that the hydrophobic core of the Pip sequences is critical for PMO delivery to the heart and that specific modifications to this region can enhance activity further. 26 has also been investigated, namely R6-Penetratin which contains six additional arginines. 27 Employing R6-Penetratin as the lead peptide, a series of peptide nucleic acids/PMO internalization peptides (Pips) were derived that were found to be much more stable to serum proteolysis. 28 Two such Pip peptides, Pip2a and Pip2b, conjugated to a dystrophin exon 23-specific (peptide nucleic acids) AO, were shown to be capable of inducing strong exon skipping and dystrophin positive fibres following intramuscular injection into the tibialis anterior (TA) muscle of the mdx mouse. Further optimization of this peptide series was carried out as conjugates to PMO, and Pip5e-PMO was identified as the most efficient peptide-PMO conjugate capable of inducing high levels of exon skipping and dystrophin restoration body wide, including in the heart, following a single dose intravenous administration. 29 The Pip5e structure comprises a hydrophobic core region flanked on each side by arginine-rich domains containing aminohexanoyl (X) and \u03b2-alanine (B) spacers. By analogy with the previous arginine-rich B peptide, 22 it was thought that the high arginine content of Pip5e contributed to overall delivery efficiency into all muscle tissues, whereas the hydrophobic region might be important for heart muscle delivery.",

The results show that a core length of 5 amino acids (5-aa) appears to be essential for heart dystrophin production, since reductions in core length reduced cardiac activity.

To further probe the composition requirements of the hydrophobic core for maintenance of good heart dystrophin production, we synthesized a range of Pip5e derivative peptides (Pip6 a-f) (Figure 1a) where mutations were made only to the hydrophobic core region, for example scrambled and partially deleted core region peptides. All peptides contained the same number of arginine residues (10) in the flanking sequences as in Pip5e, with the exception of Pip6e. These peptides were conjugated to a 25-mer PMO complementary to dystrophin exon 23, 30,31 previously validated for exon skipping in mdx mice. In contrast to the method of conjugation to the 5\u2032 end of PMO that we utilised previously, 29 Pip6-PMO conjugates were prepared by conjugation of the 3\u2032 end of the PMO to the C-terminal carboxylic acid moiety of the Pip peptide (Figure 1b) . We reported that there was no significant difference between the in vivo dystrophin production or exon skipping activity for Pip5e-PMO conjugated to the 3\u2032 end of the PMO or to the 5\u2032 end and therefore chose to utilise 3\u2032 end conjugation for these experiments. 32",

This showed that exon skipping activity in cultured muscle cells was very similar for all these constructs, including Pip5e-PMO. These results differ from the previous Pip5 series, 29 where the flanking argininerich sequences mostly contained a fixed number of arginine residues (10) but where spacings were varied through alternative placement of aminohexanoyl and \u03b2-alanine units. This resulted in small variations in exon skipping activity that correlated well with in vivo activity. In the case of Pip6 sequences, the flanking arginine-rich sequences are identical (with the exception of Pip6e, which is identical except for one arginine immediately preceding the core which is displaced into the second position of the core). The results demonstrate that cellular exon skipping activity does not depend on the sequence or length of the hydrophobic core. Note that we have previously shown that major changes in in vitro exon skipping activities are correlated instead with the total numbers of arginine residues. 33 Alterations to the Pip5e hydrophobic sequence improve splicing activity in vivo Given the potency of Pip5e-PMO in heart tissue, the aim of altering the sequence of the hydrophobic core (whilst maintaining the 5-aa length) was to identify peptides that might be more efficient at lower doses. These modifications included inversion of the hydrophobic region (Pip6a), substitution of tyrosine by isoleucine (Pip6b), substitution of glutamine in the Pip6a sequence by displacement of the arginine immediately flanking the core in the first arginine-rich flanking region (Pip6e), and a scrambled hydrophobic core sequence (Pip6f). All Pip6 peptide-PMO conjugates were administered to mdx mice as single 12.5 mg/kg intravenous injections via the tail vein and tissues were harvested 2 weeks later and assessed for activity at both RNA and protein levels.",

Immunohistochemical staining quantification (Figure 4a , b) was performed as previously described 16, 34 and was achieved by taking four representative frames of the dystrophin staining and correlating this with laminin staining for each section (n = 3) of the quadriceps, diaphragm and heart for each peptide-PMO treatment. Untreated mdx and treated mdx mice were normalized to C57BL10 mice. This method allows comparison of the staining intensity of dystrophin at the sarcolemma relative to laminin for each treatment group. Intensity ratios are normalized to C57BL10 samples and each region of interest at the sarcolemma (120 regions for each treatment group) is plotted on a scatter graph. The relative intensity values obtained for all four of the 5-aa core Pip6-PMO conjugates were significantly different to those of untreated mdx mice for the quadriceps and diaphragm ( Figure 4b and Table 1 ). There were very similar dystrophin restoration levels in the quadriceps (percent recovery score-%RS-range between 21.10 and 33.44%; Figure 4b ) and in the diaphragm for all treatments, with the exception of Pip6b which had a higher recovery score in the diaphragm (%RS range between 38.87 and 48.43%, Pip6b 56.72%; Figure 4b ).",

The delta 23 transcript is normalized against \"total dystrophin\" for each muscle group (n = 3). Quantification of this data revealed similar levels of \u220623 skipping in the quadriceps of all 5-aa Pip6-PMO-treated mice. The data trends suggest that Pip6f-and Pip5e-PMO show the highest exon skipping in the diaphragm, and Pip6f-PMO the highest in heart (for splicing mean values, see Supplementary Figure S2a ). Western blots (Figure 4e) were performed on the tissues of each mouse and were quantified against a 50 and 10% C57BL10 control. These results were averaged and are presented in Supplementary Figure S2b. Pip6a-, Pip6b-, Pip6e-, and Pip6f-PMO conjugates exhibited the highest dystrophin protein restoration in the TA and quadriceps muscles.

These differences may be attributed to the differing \"housing proteins\" used i.e., dystrophin restoration quantified by immunohistochemical staining is normalized against laminin, whereas western blot analysis uses \u03b1-actinin for normalisation. Quantification of western blots has only recently been reported for dystrophin and currently uses chemiluminescence methods. It may therefore be judicious to give greater weight to the trends in dystrophin protein levels revealed by western blot rather than to the absolute values. Therefore, considering the results overall, mdx mice treated with each of the four 5-aa core Pip6-PMOs (Pip6a-, Pip6b-, Pip6e-, and Pip6f-PMO) appear to demonstrate improved dystrophin production and exon skipping in TA, quadriceps, and heart muscles compared with the previous lead candidate, Pip5e-PMO. In addition, these 5-aa core Pip6-PMOs do not exhibit evidence of toxicity, as assessed by plasma levels of relevant toxicity biomarkers, alanine aminotransferase, aspartate aminotransferase, and creatine kinase (see Supplementary Figure S5a ). Blood urea nitrogen and creatinine levels were similar to untreated mdx levels (see Supplementary Figure S5b ). All Pip6-PMO treatment groups exhibit similar biomarker levels to untreated C57BL10 controls.",

Both Pip6e-PMO derivatives were not significantly different to untreated mdx in heart muscles, illustrating the general inefficiency of these two peptides. Similarly, these Pip6e-PMO derivatives showed reduced efficiency in exon skipping, as illustrated in representative RT-PCR images (Figure 7e ) and in qRT-PCR analyses (Figure 7d and Supplementary Figure S3c ) in all tissues. Western blots revealed negligible dystrophin protein restoration (Figure 7f and Supplementary Figure S3d ) in all tissues with the exception of the TA muscle. These data show that an increase in the number of arginines or alteration in the location of the single arginine in the hydrophobic region of Pip6e are detrimental to both heart as well as skeletal muscle dystrophin production.",

However, studies involving the administration of very high doses of naked PMO into mdx mice have shown only partial restoration of dystrophin in body-wide skeletal muscles and negligible correction in heart. 16, 35 The necessity to correct dystrophin in the heart is ever more apparent following studies whereby the correction of the skeletal phenotype resulted in an increase in the cardiac workload and thus further progression of the cardiomyopathy. 17, 18 The discovery that CPP-conjugated PMOs can achieve much more effective dystrophin correction in mdx mice than naked PMOs has brought renewed promise for enhanced AO efficacy by improving cellular and in vivo delivery. We previously reported a promising peptide-PMO candidate, Pip5e-PMO, capable of restoring dystrophin protein to high levels in all muscle types, including heart, following a single 25 mg/kg administration. 29 In addition to arginine-rich sequences, Pip peptides contain a 5-aa hydrophobic section not present in the previous B-peptide lead, 26 which seemed likely to be responsible for the improved heart activity. The Pip6 series was developed as derivatives of Pip5e-PMO in an attempt to cast light on aspects of the hydrophobic core required for heart dystrophin production and also to identify even more active Pip-PMO conjugates. Our study using a moderate, single dose administration regimen has produced some interesting and sometimes surprising results.",

One might imagine that diminished efficiency of dystrophin restoration in the heart for Pip6c-PMO and Pip6d-PMO, with sequential amino acid deletions in the core, might be correlated with the resultant lower hydrophobicity and hence a reduced capacity to enter the cell. 36 However, the in vitro results would suggest that all of these constructs are capable of entering the cells as they are all fully capable of exon skipping in muscle cells (Figure 2) . Thus, the length of the 5-aa hydrophobic core must affect a different parameter essential for in vivo heart delivery. Enhanced uptake into whole heart slices of fluorescently labeled Pip5e-PMO, compared to B-PMO, suggested instead that crossing of another barrier (for example, the endothelial lining to the heart) is improved. 30 Further heart studies are continuing with a Pip6-PMO that may help to address this issue. More surprising perhaps is that for Pip6c-PMO and Pip6d-PMO there was also some loss of dystrophin production in other muscle types. This suggests that the hydrophobic/cationic balance and/or the precise spacings of hydrophobic and cationic residues in the CPP impose more subtle effects on in vivo delivery parameters.",

In the Pip-6e peptide, one arginine residue is moved into the hydrophobic core, which also results in alignment of a hydrophobic X residue adjacent to the core (X-YRFLI). One might have expected heart dystrophin production to have been completely lost in this conjugate, since a cationic amino acid (arginine) is now included in the core. By contrast, such heart activity was lost for Pip6h-PMO (X-ILFRY core) and the double arginine core conjugate Pip6g-PMO (X-YRFRLI-X core). Unexpectedly, dystrophin production was also lost in quadriceps and diaphragm for both Pip6g-and Pip6h-PMO. The unanticipated inconsistencies within the activity results for Pip6e, Pip6g, and Pip6h, and the losses of activities for Pip6c-and Pip6d-PMO, are perhaps best explained by the realization that precise spacings of the arginine residue within the Pip peptides with respect to both the outer hydrophobic amino acid spacers (X and B) and the inner hydrophobic core residues may drastically alter the pharmacological properties of each conjugate. This might occur not only through alteration in cationic/hydrophobic balance but alternatively due to secondary or tertiary structure changes of the Pip-PMOs, which could in turn affect serum protein binding or another parameter that alters the circulatory half-life, or which could affect the ability to traverse barriers required to penetrate muscle tissues. Such more subtle effects will require a more wide-ranging pharmacological and biophysical study, upon which we are currently embarking.",

Images were captured using a Leica DM IRB microscope and Axiovision software (Carl Zeiss, Cambridge, UK). Quantitative immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described. 16, 34 A representative image for each treatment was taken. For quantification, four representative frames of the dystrophin and correlating laminin were taken for each section (n = 3) of the quadriceps, diaphragm and heart for each treatment. Using ImagePro software, 10 regions of interest were randomly placed on the laminin image which was overlaid on the corresponding dystrophin image. The minimum and maximum fluorescence intensity for 120 regions were recorded for each treatment. The intensity difference was calculated for each region to correct for background fluorescence and untreated mdx and treated mdx were normalized to C57BL10. These values were plotted on a scatter graph. The \"relative intensity means\" were calculated using a multilevel statistics model. Using these values, the percentage recovery score was calculated by implementing the following equation, as described on the TREAT-NMD website (http://www.treat-nmd.eu/downloads/file/sops/dmd/MDX/ DMD_M.1.1_001.pdf): (dystrophin recovery of treated mdx mice-dystrophin recovery of untreated mdx mice)/(dystrophin recovery of C57BL10 mice-dystrophin recovery of untreated mdx mice). Staining of dystrophin associated proteins was performed as previously described 29 using a MOM blocking kit (Vector Labs, Burlingame, CA) and \u03b1-sarcoglycan and \u03b1-dystroglycan (Novocastra, Newcastle-Upon-Tyne, UK) antibodies (1:100 dilution). Neuronal nitric oxide synthase staining was performed using a goat anti-rabbit antibody (Abcam).",
