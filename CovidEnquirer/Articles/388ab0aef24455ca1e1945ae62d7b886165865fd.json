The resolution of the modern electron microscope is 0.2 nm; in contrast, that of a good light microscope is 200 nm (these figures are based on Abbe's and de Brogli's fundamental equations). 1 It is important for pathologists to realize that the electron microscope is a morphologic instrument similar to the light microscope.",

            "text": "All kinds of cell preparations and tissues can be proffered for electron microscopic evaluation. The most commonly submitted specimens are obtained from surgical and biopsy procedures, including percutaneous fine-needle aspiration biopsies (primarily solid tissue). 11 For best results, freshly extirpated specimens are preferred to formaldehyde-fixed or paraffin-embedded tissues. Specimens are initially placed in a buffered glutaraldehyde-based fixative, post-fixed in osmium tetroxide, dehydrated in graded alcohols, and embedded in an epoxy resin. Thick (1 \u00b5m) epoxy sections are stained with a buffered 1% toluidine blue solution to localize appropriate material for ultrastructural evaluation. Thin sections (90 to 120 nm) are cut with a diamond knife, sequentially stained with uranyl acetate and lead citrate, and then placed on copper grids and studied in the electron microscope. 1 Although there are many different types of electron microscopes (e.g., high-voltage, scanning, analytic), the transmission electron microscope is most commonly used for diagnostic pathology (and is the type of electron microscope referred to throughout this chapter, unless otherwise noted). Modern electron microscopes are partially computerized and easier to operate than older models. A high vacuum can be achieved in approximately 5 to 10 minutes by use of a turbomolecular pump in place of the much slower and contaminating oil diffusion pump. Many of the latest instruments have zoom magnification, axis image rotation, and data imprinting and storage on hard drives or CD-ROMs. Future electron microscopes will be substantially smaller and will be capable of being operated in a lighted room. A high-refresh-rate charge-coupled device (CCD) that can transfer the image to a high-resolution flatpanel computer screen will replace the current fluorescent screen and the mechanically complex sheet film camera. The microscope should have one accelerating voltage (80 keV) and a realistic maximum magnification of 100,000. Captured digital images can be manipulated by using one of the many available photo-editing programs and printed on a high-resolution inkjet printer. With the availability of rapid ultrasonic and microwave tissue processing techniques and instant photography, there is no reason why a diagnostic transmission electron microscopic study cannot be completed within 24 hours or less. When properly maintained, a transmission electron microscope should last upward of 30 years. The only major expense of current scopes is, ironically, the service contract.",

            "text": "Pathologists can contribute to the reduction of health care costs by ordering expensive ancillary diagnostic tests (e.g., electron microscopy, immunohistochemistry, cytogenetic, and molecular genetic procedures) only when they are absolutely necessary for an accurate diagnosis and will have an impact on the patient's care. 12 The large majority of human diseases, including common neoplasms such as breast and colon carcinoma, can be evaluated with hematoxylin-eosin (H&E)-stained slides and an occasional histochemical stain, such as mucicarmine. When an ancillary procedure is necessary to solve a diagnostic problem, most pathologists order a specific panel of immunohistochemical stains. However, the extensive use of immunostaining procedures has revealed a number of serious pitfalls and limitations, including a paucity of absolute organ-or tumor-specific antibodies; antigen diffusion problems (e.g., thyroglobulin, myoglobulin); anomalous or unexpected immunostaining results (e.g., keratin expression in astrocytomas 13 and in malignant bone and soft tissue neoplasms 14 ); and the selection of an inappropriate and often expensive immunophenotyping panel based on a false diagnostic presumption and an inability to detect small amounts of antigen (e.g., in poorly differentiated neuroendocrine carcinomas). Perhaps the most important problem with immunohistochemical procedures is a lack of standardized methodology and quality control. For example, different antigen retrieval methods, such as enzymatic and citrate treatments, microwave and ultrasonic procedures, and especially the newer heat-induced epitope retrieval (HIER) method, can alter antigen epitopes and staining patterns. 15 Cytogenetic identification of specific reciprocal chromosome translocations and gene rearrangement studies, once used primarily to determine the lineage and clonality of leukemias and lymphomas, are now applicable to the diag-nosis of a growing number of soft tissue tumors, notably adipose neoplasms, 16 alveolar soft part sarcomas, 17 and synovial sarcomas. 18 Promising new methods for the detection of specific chimeric transcripts resulting from gene fusions are currently being developed and perfected in wellequipped and well-staffed molecular pathology laboratories. Some of these procedures are fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH), reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction, DNA-based polymerase chain reaction, laser capture microdissection, confocal scanning laser microscopy, and atomic force microscopy (see Chapter 7) . As with electron microscopy and immunodiagnostic methods, problems and shortcomings in cytogenetic and molecular procedures limit their diagnostic usefulness. These methodologies are constantly evolving, require sophisticated equipment and highly trained personnel, and are not available in many pathology laboratories.",

The differential diagnosis of the three rare types depends on the ultrastructural identification of disease-specific glomerular deposits. The pertinent diagnostic features (primarily ultrastructural) of these diseases can be summarized as follows. Amyloidosis (proteinuria-nephrotic syndrome) often occurs in myeloma (plasma cell dyscrasia) patients; the usual type found is AL amyloidosis (abnormal light chains are present). Ultrastructurally, numerous 8-to 12-nm nonbranching fibrils are randomly distributed in the glomerulus. Fibrillary glomerulopathy is characterized by a ribbon-like pattern of IgA and C3 and a primarily subepithelial deposition of 20to 30-nm fibrils with an amyloid P component. In immunotactoid glomerulopathy, IgG, C3, and characteristic clusters of spherical microtubular structures with a 30-to 40-nm diameter are also found in the mesangium. The cryoglobulinemic glomerulopathies are divided into types I, II, and III and are associated with B-cell lymphoplasmacytoid malignancies. Type I is identified by IgG and 80-nmwide bundles of rigid fibrils or \"fingerprint\" arrays of tubular structures, all of which are distributed throughout the glomerulus. In types II and III, mixed cryoglobulins and 25-nm microtubules are found in thrombi and in the subepithelial and mesangial regions of the glomerulus. For more detailed information on all the glomerulopathies, see Chapter 29 and the cited references. [20] [21] [22] [23] ",

Some examples include a new variant of the cold-causing coronavirus that appeared in China in 2002 and is the cause of the deadly and highly infectious pneumonia known as severe acute respiratory syndrome (SARS; see later); Marburg and Ebola viruses (Filoviridae family), which replicate in the cytoplasm of white blood cells and cause hemorrhagic fever; another African virus, West Nile virus (Flaviviridae family), which can cause a fatal encephalitis [25] [26] [27] ; and human immunodeficiency virus (HIV), a retrovirus that causes acquired immunodeficiency syndrome (AIDS). 28 Because of the potential for deadly epidemics, it is imperative that the disease-causing agent (usually a virus) be quickly identified so that a vaccine can be produced. Many DNA-or RNA-containing virus families can be identified by mixing body fluids (e.g., sputum), blister contents, feces, or lesion scrapings with a 2% phosphotungstic acid, 0.5% uranyl acetate, or ammonium molybdate solution; placing the specimen on a coated nickel or copper grid; drying by touching the edge of the drop with filter paper; and then examining the grid in the electron microscope. These electron-dense stains permeate the interstices of the surface viral capsomeres, thus allowing for the quick recognition of many viral families. 29, 30 This procedure is called \"negative staining\" and should be performed only in a biohazard or biocontainment facility such as those at the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) in Atlanta, Georgia. Recently, this rapid technique was used concurrently at the CDC and in Hong Kong to identify a new variant of coronavirus, recognized by the presence of club-shaped Other microbial agents such as intestinal spirochetes, rickettsia, protozoa, and bacteria can be identified using traditional thin-section electron microscopy (viruses can also be studied this way). Some examples include the protozoan microsporidia Encephalitozoon intestinalis 33 and Encephalitozoon hellem, which is the cause of ocular infections in immunocompromised individuals receiving chemotherapy and in HIV/AIDS patients. 34",

In the diverse group of vacuolar myopathies, electron microscopy is helpful in identifying the contents of the vacuoles common to these diseases. For example, tubules and filaments ranging in diameter from 15 to 18 nm are found in inclusion body myopathies. Abnormal lipid and glycogen metabolism, ion channel disorders, and so-called mitochondrial myopathies (pleomorphic mitochondria and paracrystalline cristae or matrical inclusions) constitute the metabolic myopathies. The congenital myopathies include nemaline \"rod body\" myopathy (elongate electron-dense aggregates of filaments that resemble streaming Z-discs); those exhibiting abnormal cytoplasmic structures (e.g., myofilaments, organelles, sarcoplasmic reticulum, Ttubules) and inclusions such as fingerprint and zebra bodies; and those with centrally located abnormal aggregates of sarcomere constituents (\"target fibers\") such as central core disease, neurogenic atrophy, and inflammatory myopathies accompanying recent denervation (Fig. 6-9) .

Following are some examples of soft tissue tumors in which ultrastructural evaluation is important for the correct diagnosis. However, combined immunohistochemical and electron microscopic studies are often required to reach an accurate diagnosis. 1, 53, 54 Two variants of fibroblastic neoplasms-myofibroblastic fibrosarcoma (myofibroblastoma and myofibrosarcoma) and pleomorphic fibrosarcoma-require ultrastructural examination for diagnostic confirmation. The fibroblast is a remarkable cell with a large differentiation repertoire and no distinct immunoprofile or karyotype. 9 The myofibroblast is the prototypical and best-known example of fibroblastic cell plasticity (see later). Myofibroblasts are primarily fibroblasts with the additional presence of peripheral arrays of actin microfilaments with dispersed fusiform densities, a fibronexus, and small desmosome-like and gap junctions. The immunohistochemical identification of a myofibroblast (especially neoplastic) is doubtful because five immunophenotyes have been identified: (1) vimentin and \u03b1-smooth muscle actin (\u03b1-SMA); (2) vimentin, \u03b1-SMA, and desmin; (3) vimentin and desmin; (4) vimentin; and (5) vimentin, \u03b1-SMA, and smooth muscle myosin heavy chain with or without desmin. 55 It is thus obvious that myofibroblastic tumors-myofibroblastoma and myofibrosarcoma 56 -can be accurately diagnosed only by electron microscopy. Ultrastructural studies are often necessary to distinguish between myofibrosarcoma (peripheral actin filaments and a prominent rough endoplasmic reticulum) and poorly differentiated leiomyosarcoma (more randomly distributed actin filaments, numerous mitochondria, and a poorly developed rough endoplasmic reticulum). 57 \"Epithelioid myofibroblasts\" are rare compared with smooth muscle neoplasms.",

On the basis of these findings, I propose a new pleomorphic fibrosarcoma classification (Table 6 -1). Pleomorphic fibrosarcoma (originally designated by Arthur Purdy Stout) is a patternless neoplasm analogous to other pleomorphic sarcomas (e.g., pleomorphic liposarcoma). 59 Pleomorphic myxoid fibrosarcoma replaces the inappropriate appellation myxofibrosarcoma. Current pathology nomenclature uses an adjective preceding the variant of a particular nosologic entity (e.g., sclerosing hemangioma, myxoid liposarcoma, plexiform schwannoma). Most myxoid fibrosarcomas are low-grade, poorly cellular neoplasms containing relatively few pleomorphic tumor cells. However, if these tumors are not completely excised, they may progress to high-grade neoplasms. I have not seen a storiform-pleomorphic myxoid fibrosarcoma in my practice. The term malignant giant cell tumor of soft parts is an appropriate general designation, because not all these neoplasms are fibroblastic.",

No tonofilaments, desmosomes, Birbeck granules, dense-core granules, melanosomes, or basement membranes have been identified in any cases. 72 More recently, my colleagues and I reported a cytokeratin-positive malignant tumor that may be a subtype of fibroblastic reticulum neoplasia arising from the interfollicuar fibroblastic reticular cells of mesenchymal origin. 74 It is possible that they function to direct cell migration within the lymph node. These cells have a moderately welldeveloped rough endoplasmic reticulum in addition to interdigitating cytoplasmic processes. Following our report, Jones and colleagues 75 published a case report of a clinically aggressive reticulum cell sarcoma with intermediate differentiation between follicular dendritic cells and fibroblastic reticular cells. Histologically, a multifocal proliferation of epithelioid and spindle cells, with prominent admixed lymphocytes and a high mitotic index, was found. Although ultrastructural examination revealed elongated cells with large nucleoli and interdigitating cytoplasmic processes joined by desmosomes, the immunohistochemical studies showed no expression of follicular dendritic cell antigens.

Many of these neoplasms are poorly differentiated (even undifferentiated) and are found in the lymph nodes, bones, skin, liver, lungs, and brain. Clinicians prefer an exact diagnosis, which enables them to choose the most effective therapy protocol and establish a prognosis.",

However, intestinal-type microvilli that are usually devoid of glycocalyceal bodies are also found in mucin-producing adenocarcinomas originating in other gastrointestinal sites, including associated organs and their ducts; pulmonary adenocarcinoma; rare enteric-type adenocarcinoma of the nasal cavity; and urachal-type mucinous carcinoma of the urinary bladder. Similarly, staghorn-like branching microvilli are see primarily in ovarian carcinomas, myelinosomes in bronchioalveolar carcinomas (notably the uncommon alveolar tumors), and abundant cytoplasmic glycogen particles and lipid droplets in renal clear cell carcinomas.",

For example, cytokeratin 20 positivity suggests colorectal or transitional epithelial origin, whereas cytokeratin 7 expression signifies a probable pulmonary (bronchial) primary. A marked elevation of CA125 levels in the blood of a patient with extensive abdominal adenocarcinoma suggests an ovarian primary.",

The first patient, an adult woman, presented with an enlarged cervical lymph node. A neoplasm that resembled a carcinoid tumor with an organoid growth pattern was identified by routine light microscopy, including special stains. The electron microscopic identification of round, oblong, and angulated endosecretory granules suggested a midgut primary tumor. At laparotomy, a small, asymptomatic carcinoid tumor was found in the midileum. The second patient, an adult man with extensive abdominal disease, had a biopsy of a thigh mass that revealed an undifferentiated round cell tumor devoid of significant immunoreactivity. Ultrastructural examination showed that the tumor cells had a moderately well-developed smooth endoplasmic reticulum, indicative of adrenocortical origin. A large tumor (most likely the primary) was found in the left adrenal gland (the testes contained no tumor).",
