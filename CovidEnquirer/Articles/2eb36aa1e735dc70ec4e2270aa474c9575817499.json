Risk factors for PVT include left atrial dilation, atrial fibrillation, hypercoagulability, and low cardiac output. 4 Obstruction of a mechanical prosthesis requires aggressive treatment (surgery or fibrinolysis) because anticoagulant treatment usually will be insufficient. 5 Because of the lack of randomized studies, there are few recommendations in the literature concerning PVT management (level 2 recommendations when available). According to the 2014 American College of Cardiology/American Heart Association guidelines, 3 surgery is the preferred treatment for left-sided PVT. VA-ECMO has been indicated in refractory cardiogenic shock as a bridge to recovery from a potentially reversible underlying insult and as a bridge to cardiac transplantation or ventricular assist device placement. 6 Rarely has VA-ECMO been used as a bridge to surgical replacement of a thrombosed prosthetic valve. 7, 8 In the case presented here, the patient arrived in cardiogenic shock and multiorgan failure in the middle of the night, and after several multidisciplinary discussions among cardiac surgery, heart failure cardiology, and critical care providers, emergency valve replacement was deemed too high risk in the setting of multiorgan failure. The decision was made to medically optimize the patient with VA-ECMO for a short period before definitive surgery. Management of the patient using ECMO preoperatively presented a safer option than did emergency surgery and potential postoperative ECMO, which would submit the patient to possible further complications, including rethrombosis of the new prosthesis. Thrombolytic therapy was not considered due to coagulopathy in the setting of liver dysfunction. In the only previously reported case in which VA-ECMO was used in a postpartum patient with PVT, surgery was performed after a 3-day period of stabilization. 8 This unique case of a patient with an unstable condition in multiorgan failure who needed an urgent fourth redo sternotomy, cardiotomy, and valve replacement suggests a potential subset of patients who may benefit from ECMO therapy as a temporary measure. Early transfer to an ECMO center is recommended to avoid worsening multiorgan failure, which would render any further surgical options as futile. In the case presented here, despite delays, the patient did not require renal replacement therapy and experienced resolution of hepatic dysfunction and coagulopathy once she was medically optimized using VA-ECMO. In the setting of multisystem dysfunction and high perioperative risk, extracorporeal life support may present a viable option for providing temporary hemodynamic optimization before definitive treatment.",
