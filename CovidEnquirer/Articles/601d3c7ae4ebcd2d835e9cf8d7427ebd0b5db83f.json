The evolutionary relationship between 2019-nCoV and the other human respiratory illness-causing coronavirus is not closely related. We sought to characterize the relationship of the translated proteins of 2019-nCoV with other species of Orthocoronavirinae. A phylogenetic tree was constructed from the genome sequences. A cluster tree was developed from the profiles retrieved from the presence and absence of homologs of ten 2019-nCoV proteins. The combined data were used to characterize the relationship of the translated proteins of 2019-nCoV to other species of Orthocoronavirinae. Our analysis reliably suggests that 2019-nCoV is most closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 and belongs to subgenus Sarbecovirus of Betacoronavirus, together with SARS coronavirus and Bat-SARS-like coronavirus. The phylogenetic profiling cluster of homolog proteins of one annotated 2019-nCoV protein against other genome sequences revealed two clades of ten 2019-nCoV proteins. Clade 1 consisted of a group of conserved proteins in Orthocoronavirinae comprising Orf1ab polyprotein, Nucleocapsid protein, Spike glycoprotein, and Membrane protein. Clade 2 comprised six proteins exclusive to Sarbecovirus and Hibecovirus. Two of six Clade 2 nonstructural proteins, NS7b and NS8, were exclusively conserved among 2019-nCoV, BetaCoV_RaTG, and BatSARS-like Cov. NS7b and NS8 have previously been shown to affect immune response signaling in the SARS-CoV experimental model. Thus, we speculated that knowledge of the functional changes in the NS7b and NS8 proteins during evolution may provide important information to explore the human infective property of 2019-nCoV.",

It causes acute respiratory disease in respiratory infections. Immediately after its discovery, the complete genome sequence of 2019-nCoV was determined. The sequence (MN908947) was released by GenBank on 05 January 2020 (Lu et al., 2020) .

At the first onset, homology modeling investigated the potential receptor-binding properties of the virus.

One species of the Okanivirinae subfamily, the yellow head virus, was also collected as an outgroup (Supplementary Table 1 ). The genome sequences were aligned using MAFFT multiple sequence alignment program provided at the XSEDE portal in the CIPRES Science Gateway with an automatic selection strategy (Miller et al., 2012; Katoh and Standley, 2013) . A phylogenetic tree was constructed using the maximum likelihood method with RAxML-HPC BlackBox in the CIPRES Science Gateway (Stamatakis, 2006) . The analysis used an automatic bootstrapping option using a general timereversible substitution model with a gamma-shape parameter (GTR+ G). The model was selected as the best-fit model under the Akaike information criterion using ModelTest-NG (Darriba et al., 2020) . Phylogenetic trees were viewed using FigTree v1.4 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/ software/figtree/).",

            "text": "The phylogenetic analysis using complete genome sequences showed that 2019-nCoV was the most closely related to BatCoV RaTG13 and belonged to the Sarbecovirus subgenus of Betacoronavirus, together with SARS coronavirus and Bat-SARS-like coronavirus (BAT-SL-CoVZXC21 and BAT-SL-CoVZC45) with the full support of reliability (Fig. 1) . Additionally, Hibecovirus with Bat Hp-betacoronavirus/Zhe-jiang2013, as the representative species, was the most closely related subgenus of Betacoronavirus to Sarbecovirus as compared to other subgenera, including Merbecovirus (under which MERS-CoV has been classified), Nobecovirus, and Embecovirus. These findings agree with previous phylogenetic tree and similarity plot data (Paraskevis et al., 2020) . 2019-nCoV was found to be more closely related to the batinfecting Sarbecovirus species, Bat SARS-like coronavirus, and BetaCoV RaTG13 than to the SARS coronavirus that infects humans. This indicated that 2019-nCoV more likely originated from bats. However, the Wuhan outbreak was first detected in December, which is a time of year when most bat species hibernate. Moreover, the Huanan seafood market, which is considered as ground zero of the outbreak, does not sell bats. Instead, it has been suggested that there is an animal mediator for virus transmission from bats to humans, similar to the previous cases of SARS-CoV and MERS-CoV, wherein the masked palm civet (Paguma larvata) and dromedary camel (Camelus dromedarius) act as intermediate hosts, respectively (Lu et al., 2020) . Although coronaviruses can exchange genetic material during coinfection, a recent report described the lack of a mosaic relationship of 2019-nCoV to the closely related Sarbecovirus, indicating the lack of a recombination event in the emergence of 2019-nCoV (Paraskevis et al., 2020) . Hence, 2019-nCoV likely emerged from the accumulation of mutations responding to altered selective pressures or from the infidelity of RNA polymerase perpetuated as replication-neutral mutations. These speculations need to be studied further.",

The present findings provide a different perspective of the similarity among Orthocoronavirinae species, using a cluster tree developed from the profiles retrieved from the presence and absence of homologs of ten 2019-nCoV proteins. This cluster was combined with the cladogram of a previously constructed phylogenetic tree (Fig. 2) . Both the trees were consistent in their heatmap distributions. The tree of 2019-nCoV proteins comprised two clades. The first, indicated with a blue bar in Fig. 2 , contained a group of conserved proteins in most Orthocoronavirinae species. These comprised Orf1ab polyprotein, Nucleocapsid protein, Spike glycoprotein, and Membrane protein. Spike and Orf1a regions of 2019-nCoV were previously shown to have the lowest sequence identity as compared to the closely related coronavirus species (Lu et al., 2020; Paraskevis et al., 2020) . However, since the translated Spike glycoprotein and Orf1ab polyprotein from these regions are very long, the sequence similarity is still sufficient to classify them as homologs. In contrast, another clade, indicated by the green bar in Fig. 2 , comprised proteins specific to Sarbecovirus for all proteins in this clade and Hibecovirus for envelope protein only. This clade included proteins that were not completely conserved by all Orthocoronavirus. Two (NS7b and NS8) of five nonstructural proteins were specific for 2019-nCoV and its closely related species, BatCoV RaTG13 and Bat-SARS-like coronavirus (BAT-SL-CoVZXC21 and BAT-SL-CoVZC45). The other three nonstructural proteins (NS3, NS6, and NS7a) were also detected in the SARS coronavirus. Based on these results, we propose that the comprehensive analysis of nonstructural proteins, especially NS7b and NS8, may provide new insight into the properties of 2019-nCoV.",

            "text": "As shown in Fig. 2 , NS7b and NS8 of 2019-nCoV, BatCoV RaTG13, and Bat-SARS-like coronavirus were distinct from other species of Orthocoronavirus. In SARS-CoV, NS7b is an integral protein localized in the Golgi compartment. The protein is packaged into SARS-CoV particles (Schaecher et al., 2007) . Interestingly, open reading frame (ORF) 7b, but not ORF 7b deletion, induces interferon (IFN)-dependent reporter gene expression as well as apoptosis and the type I IFN response (Pfefferle et al., 2009 ). Moreover, the deletion of ORF 7b enhance virus growth (Pfefferle et al., 2009 ). Thus, we speculate that the property of the non-conserved NS7b in 2019-nCoV may affect the human infective property of the virus. Similarly, the existence of 29 nucleotide deletions in ORF 8b has been described in SARS-CoV (Oostra et al., 2007) . A study involving MERS-CoV described that ORF 8b strongly antagonizes the INF-beta (\u03b2) promoter and ORF4b and 8b significantly suppress IFN induction (Lee et al., 2019b) . Accessory proteins 8b and 8ab of SARS-CoV can suppress the INF-\u03b2 signaling pathway (and thus interferon production) by their participation in the ubiquitin-mediated rapid degradation of INF regulatory factor 3 (IRF3) (Wong et al., 2018) . In contrast, when we focused on MERS-CoV from bats and camels, ORF 8b antagonized melanoma differentiation-associated protein 5-mediated nuclear factor kappa B (NF-\u03baB) activation. ORF 8b strongly inhibited TANK-binding kinase 1-mediated induction of NF-\u03baB signaling, but not I\u03baB kinase epsilon and IRF3-mediated activations (Lee et al., 2019a) . Thus, we speculate that the properties of the accessory proteins, NS7b and NS8, in 2019-nCoV may affect its ability to infect humans. Further studies are required to confirm this speculation.",
