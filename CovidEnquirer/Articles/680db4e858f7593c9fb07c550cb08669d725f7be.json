The number of countries participating in this programme remained stable from 2014 to 2017. However, by 2017, there was a significant increase in the number of countries correctly identifying all influenza viruses in the EQAP panel from 9 countries scoring 100% in 2014 to 15 countries in 2017. During the same period, 13 countries were visited to assess the laboratory capacities and to provide technical support and hands-on PCR training workshops. The provision of technical expertise through training, mentoring and exchange visits to WHO collaborating centres, as well as the provision and maintenance of essential equipment and reagents, has contributed to this achievement. Improved laboratory diagnostic capacities enable detection of influenza viruses with pandemic potential, and can bolster virus sharing with GISRS for further characterization and risk assessment.

By the end of 2017, nearly one-third of countries (seven out of 22) in the Region had estimated their disease burden including three L&S PIP priority countries. Five countries have already published their findings (Egypt, Iran (Islamic Republic of), Lebanon, Oman and Tunis) [16] [17] [18] [19] [20] , while the manuscripts from Jordan and Morocco are under peer-review. National disease burden estimates can now be used by countries to inform pandemic influenza policy such as for risk-group identification and response measures required. The national estimates have also been used to develop updated global burden estimates. These are important achievements given the comparatively recent expansion of influenza surveillance systems in the Region to generate the necessary data for burden estimation.",

Timely information and virus sharing are critical to rapidly detect changes in the virological, clinical or epidemiological patterns associated with influenza and to quickly implement seasonal or pandemic risk management measures. WHO continues to work with countries to address these gaps through meetings, technical support and by encouraging countries without NICs to designate a national laboratory so that there is dedicated participation in GISRS and global information-and virus-sharing. In 2017, WHO also published practical guidance for countries on sharing influenza viruses [24, 25] .
