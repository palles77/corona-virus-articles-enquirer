Rinderpest virus, belonging to morbillivirus family of Paramyxoviridae, is antigenically closely related to Measles virus. H protein is a protective antigen of the virus and is one of the envelope glycoproteins. We have previously produced and characterized an anti-idiotypic monoclonal antibody (Ab 2 ) D9D8 (Vani et al., 2007a ) generated using a monoclonal antibody A12A9 (Ab 1 ) specific for H protein . D9D8 behaves as an 'internal image' of H protein as shown by its ability to induce antianti-idiotypic antibodies (Ab 3 ) in mice and rats (Vani et al., 2007a) . It has also been shown to mimic H protein in terms of both B and T cell responses (Vani et al., 2007a) suggesting that besides the functional homology, a structural homology may be underlying the Ab 1 defined H-epitope mimicry by the Ab 2 D9D8. In the variable regions of D9D8, regions with primary sequence similarity with the epitope on H were detected. The epitope is also a region on the H protein that is conserved among other morbilliviruses. In the present study, we have investigated the structural basis of mimicry of the hemagglutinin protein by its anti-idiotypic antibody by homology modeling of the structure of H as well as that of variable regions of Ab 2 .",

Structural analysis of different templates suggested that the differences between them are primarily in terms of the relative orientation between the H and the L chains as shown in Fig. 2A . The angles varied from 1 \u2022 to 5 \u2022 between the templates. The role of flexibility in antigen binding has been well recognized (Huber and Bennett, 1987) , hence the need to explicitly consider this aspect in model building of the antibody molecule. For modeling the Fv fragment of Ab 2 , relative orientation of the chains in other crystal structures of antibodies was analyzed among the list of templates identified through sequence similarities. Conservation of interactions at the surface was analyzed in particular. Based on this analysis, 32C2 (structure of an activity suppressing Fab fragment to cytochrome p450 aromatase) was chosen as the final template (Fig. 2B ).",

Previously it has been shown that peptides synthesized from these region (from H as well as Ab 2 ) have the ability to function as both B and T cell epitopes (Vani et al., 2007c) . Structural superposition of Ab 2 V H with that of epitopic loop on H in Fig. 3B shows significant similarity in these segments, matching with the sequence alignments. Of the experimentally mapped 30 residue epitope of H, residues 539-556 aa aligns with 49-65 aa residues of CDR2 in the H chain. A weaker but still comprehensible similarity of a portion of H with V L is also observed. This is no surprise, as the light and heavy chains of the antibody having the same structural fold. The observed similarities are despite the fact that H and Ab 2 molecules on the whole adopt different structural folds belonging to different SCOP classes and are also of different sizes serving as a beautiful example for generating functional mimicry through sub-structural similarity.

(A) Schematic representation of immunoglobulin template structures chosen to build the model of variable regions of heavy and light chains of the Ab2 D9D8; the three templates (32C2: activity suppressing Fab fragment to cytochrome p450 aromatase; 1IFH: anti-peptide Fab 17/9 and three different Fab-peptide complexes specific to influenza hemagglutinin; 1BLN: anti-p-glycoprotein Fab mrk-16) used were chosen based the structural alignment as mentioned in Section 2.

(B) Interface residues in 32C2 and the corresponding residues in D9D8: 32C2 was chosen as a template to construct the D9D8-Fv fragment comprising VH and VL, since the VH-VL interface residues were more conserved between D9D8 and 32C2. The conserved residues between both have been displayed. The number in subscript denotes the position of the amino acid residues. (Vani et al., 2007a) .

We have recently shown that peptidomimics in the CDRs of anti-idiotypic B cells, which may not be completely homologous to the original antigen peptide but which carry the structural complementarities, are able to trigger idiotypic antigenspecific T cells (Vani et al., 2007c) . Further, we have shown that antigen-specific T and B cell responses are elicited on immunization with anti-idiotypic antibody in the absence of antigen and also that boosting with antigen-specific anti-idiotypic B cells generates memory response in antigen-primed mice (Vani et al., 2007a) .",

The molecular modeling results suggest that there is indeed structural mimicry which may complement the functional activity of anti-idiotypic antibody, especially in its membrane bound form. We have demonstrated the presence of structural homology between the monoclonal murine antiidiotypic antibody and antigen by identifying the cross-reactive residues responsible for mimicry. Identification of threshold level at which B cells provide lasting memory as well as the synergy between T cell and B cell responses would assist our understanding of the development of long-lasting immune memory. The sequences on the epitopic sites of H and regions on V H of Ab 2 are shown in Fig. 4 to depict functional as well as structurally equivalent parts of the molecules taking part in elicitation of immune memory. The Fv fragment of Ab 2 exhibits similar antigenicity values as that of the region on H protein carrying Ab 1 epitope.",

The anti-id for H protein is an Ab 2\u2424 signifying that it carries the internal image of the antigen and the present work has shown that structural mimicry between the H protein and Fv may be the key element in induction of anti-H response in vivo, mediated by Ab 2 .",

The anti-idiotypic Fabs generated can act as true internal images of the antigen, in that they can mimic the antigen in terms of both B and T cell immune responses. Secondly their presence can maintain B cell memory during the absence of antigen in the system and provide specific help through presentation of peptidomimics. Our structural analysis provide additional support to our earlier proposed mechanism for the maintenance of immunological memory by both idiotypic and anti-idiotypic B cells, which are generated in a cyclic fashion.",
