The etiology of febrile seizures remains unclear, although fever, age, and genetic predisposition have been identified as major factors. In addition, multifactorial models based on genetic and environmental causes have been proposed recently [4] . Pediatric infectious diseases are the most frequent environmental causes, of which viral infections are the most frequent entities in children. Recent studies have explored the connections between febrile seizures and respiratory and enteric viral infections [5, 6] .",

Patients older than 2 years exhibited a gradually decreasing trend beginning at 3 years of age, and the lowest frequency was observed at 5 years (25,754, 4.6%) ( Table 1) .",

Many studies have investigated the seasonal distribution of febrile seizure. Most studies reported frequent febrile seizures in winter, but differed with respect to events in summer. According to a study conducted in Japan, febrile seizure was predominant during both the winter (from November to January) and summer (from June to August). This result was attributed to the prevalence of respiratory virus infection in winter and gastrointestinal virus infection in summer [7] . Similar results were reported in Italy and Iran [9, 20] . However, a study conducted in Finland reported that febrile seizure occurred most frequently in winter but was uncommon in summer [16] . The authors reported that this result was associated with febrile episodes, which were also frequent in winter and uncommon in summer [10] . In a study of febrile seizure distribution and associated viral infection in in Bosnia and Herzegovina, the distributions of febrile seizure from spring to winter were similar, and no statistically significant association with virus infection was observed [11] . Our study showed that febrile seizures occurred most frequently from late spring to summer. We believe that this result can be attributed to enterovirus infection, which occurs predominantly in the summer.",

Previous studies internationally and in South Korea have reported the high prevalence of enterovirus infection in the summer [21] [22] [23] [24] . As enterovirus infection frequently causes a high fever, this high summer prevalence might be the cause of febrile seizures shown in this study. Enterovirus has an affinity for neuronal cells and is a major cause of central nervous system infections, such as viral meningitis. These central nervous system infections may present with mild symptoms, or with severe infection and consequent encephalitis associated with disability and death [25, 26] . In a study conducted in Japan, 13 of 21 children with febrile seizures in the summer yielded positive results in an enterovirus polymerase chain reaction examination of cerebrospinal fluid [27] . In our study, febrile seizures that occurred during summer might have been mild neurologic manifestations of enterovirus infections.",

The rate of recurrent febrile seizure was also associated with influenza A infection [30] . In accordance with previous studies, we identified influenza virus infection as the most common viral infection associated with febrile seizures in winter. This finding suggests that influenza virus infection is the major cause of febrile seizures in the winter season. After influenza virus and enterovirus, the next most frequent viruses in our study were rotavirus, RSV, and adenovirus. Rotavirus causes gastrointestinal infection and is prevalent in winter [31] . RSV, a respiratory virus, is prevalent in winter and is the most common cause of acute bronchiolitis in children younger than 2 years [32] . The incidence of adenovirus infection remains fairly consistent throughout the year [33] . In our study, the seasonal distribution patterns of rotavirus, RSV, and adenovirus infection were similar to those reported in previous studies.

Therefore, we could not assess these events using detailed criteria (e.g., simple febrile seizure, complex febrile seizure and febrile status epilepticus). Second, the diagnoses of febrile seizure and viral infection were based on the codes in medical records, due to a limitation of the HIRA database. In reality, however, discrepancies between diagnostic codes and actual disease might occur in patients with febrile seizure. Third, in Korea, physicians commonly apply viral diagnostic methods such as PCR of stool samples and nasal swabs to hospitalized patients. In Korea, however, influenza virus is prevalent in winter, and a rapid enzyme immunoassay-based influenza diagnostic test was used frequently in local clinics and emergency rooms. Therefore, the high number of influenza virus infections may be due to diagnostic bias. However, our study provides a reliable assessment of the seasonal distribution of febrile seizures and the relationship of febrile seizure with viral infection at the national level, as the analysis was based on a database that covered almost the entire South Korean population.
