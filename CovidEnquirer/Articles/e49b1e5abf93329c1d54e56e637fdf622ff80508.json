            "text": "The disease has since spread rapidly around the world, with cases currently reported from 25 countries on five continents. 2 The disease has features that give rise to great concern, including poorly understood epidemiology and pathogenesis, absence of definitive diagnostic tests and specific treatments, an incubation period that allows rapid spread along international air-travel routes, an incompletely understood pattern of nosocomial transmission, mounting evidence that certain source cases make a special contribution to rapid spread of infection, a disturbing concentration of cases in previously healthy hospital staff, an initial case fatality of 3-4%, and an initially unclear causal agent. [3] [4] [5] [6] [7] In developing emergency plans to contain the outbreak and prevent further international spread, WHO worked on the principle that the unidentified causal agent could lead to an exceptionally dangerous outbreak. Rapid development of scientific knowledge would be needed to reduce opportunities for SARS to establish endemicity. Identification of the causal agent and the development of a diagnostic test were given paramount importance in the overall containment strategy. 8, 9 In the view of WHO epidemiologists and virologists, as long as the causal agent remained unknown, and no specific interventions against the agent were available, specialists in infectious disease control would be forced to resort to the control tools of isolation and quarantine.",

SARS looked increasingly like a new disease. Epidemiological evidence suggested person-toperson transmission as the major route. 13 If the causative agent maintained its pathogenicity and transmissibility, SARS could become the first severe new disease of the 21st century, with global epidemic potential.",

The severity of the disease, combined with its rapid spread along international air-travel routes, prompted WHO to set up a network of scientists from 11 laboratories around the world to try to identify the causal agent and develop a diagnostic test. The network unites laboratories with different methods and capacities to rapidly fulfil all postulates for establishing a virus as the cause of a disease. Results are shared in real time via a secure website, on which microscopy pictures, protocols for testing, and PCR primer sequences are also posted. Findings are discussed in daily teleconferences. Progress is further facilitated through sharing between laboratories of samples and test materials. The network has identified a new coronavirus, consistently detected in samples of SARS patients from several countries, and conclusively named it as the causative agent of SARS; the strain is unlike any other known member of the genus Coronavirus. Three diagnostic tests are now available, but all have limitations.",

The network was modelled partly on the global influenza network. However, the urgency of what was increasingly being seen as a public-health emergency called for rapid adaptation to meet unique needs and ensure virtual collaboration. Laboratories were approached by telephone throughout the weekend of March 15-16, 2003 . The objective was to secure the participation of laboratories with outstanding experience in the detection of a wide range of viruses and other micro-organisms, a history of collaboration in international investigations coordinated by WHO, access to SARS samples, and capacity to fulfil the six criteria of Koch's postulates required to establish a virus as the cause of a disease. 28 All laboratories asked to join agreed to do so and to work according to a set of rules on confidentiality of data. These rules specified that data and information shared among the members of the research project would be used only to advance the project in a collaborative way. Specific scientific data could be shared outside the network with the approval of the laboratory from which the data or other information originated. To avoid discrepancies between official national case notification and laboratory information, data on cases and samples were treated separately from epidemiological information. Such open sharing among academic competitors required trust and willingness to work together.",

The Government Virus Unit in Hong Kong reported consistently positive PCR for the new coronavirus in faeces from SARS patients between days 6 and 16 after onset of clinical signs. A laboratory in Germany found RNA of the new coronavirus in conjunctival liquid of one patient on the day of onset of clinical symptoms.

            "text": "On April 16, 1 month after the network began to function, participating laboratories collectively announced conclusive identification of the new coronavirus as the causative agent of SARS. The announcement was made based on the results from the monkey studies done in the Netherlands laboratory. This virus was found in many SARS patients from several countries. The virus causes a cytopathogenic effect in two cell lines (Vero cells and fetal rhesus kidney cells). Electron microscopy of cell culture and respiratory samples from SARS patients show coronavirus-like particles. Immunofluorescent assays with serum from convalescent patients detect cells infected with the virus in cell culture. Reactivity with this new coronavirus could not be detected in serum from several hundreds of non-SARS individuals in the USA, Canada and Hong Kong. Generic coronavirus primers can detect the new coronavirus RNA in cell culture and in samples from SARS patients. Specific primers have been developed in several laboratories and are currently being compared for sensitivity. Hyperimmune sera against transmissible gastroenteritis virus, feline infectious peritonitis virus, and 229E human coronavirus react with the virus antigen in cell culture. Partial sequencing of the new coronavirus in several laboratories has confirmed its affiliation to the genus Coronavirus but shown dissimilarities with known members belonging to each of the three existing groups of this genus.",

            "text": "Three diagnostic tests are now available, but all have limitations. Since the ELISA detects antibodies reliably only from about day 20 after the onset of clinical symptoms, it cannot be used to detect cases before they potentially spread the infection to others. The second test, an immunofluorescence assay, detects antibodies reliably after day 10 of infection. Various versions of real-time and block-based PCR tests are currently being developed to improve their low sensitivity and reduce the number of false-negative test results. All existing tests, used individually or in combination, can only confirm the disease in suspected or probable SARS cases. More work is needed before reliable, easy-to-use and sensitive tests become available in all countries. Work towards this objective is continuing and is proceeding at a rapid pace. Each laboratory has contributed substantially to the rapid identification and characterisation of the new coronavirus associated with SARS. [31] [32] [33] ",

Laboratories in Japan, France, and Rotterdam, and the Government Virus Unit in Hong Kong have extended studies on the comparative performance of PCR primers. The laboratory from Canada has shared, via the website, a comprehensive report on coronavirus and human metapneumovirus findings in Canadian SARS patients. Up-dated phylogenetic trees and more sequencing information on the new coronavirus from the laboratories in the USA and Rotterdam have been posted. First inactivation experiments in Germany have revealed that the infectivity of the virus in serum is destroyed by incubation at 56\u00baC for 30 min.",
