            "text": "The burden of influenza has been estimated by statistical models using population-based administrative databases or those from surveillance systems coupled with laboratory surveillance data [1] [2] [3] [4] . Laboratory surveillance systems collect data on influenza testing but provide less detail related to noninfluenza viruses. These other respiratory viruses (ORVs) such as respiratory syncytial virus (RSV), human metapneumovirus (hMPV), human parainfluenza viruses (hPIVs), and coronaviruses (CoVs) co-circulate with influenza viruses during winter, and have been increasingly recognized as significant pathogens not only in pediatric [5] [6] [7] but also in adult populations, particularly the elderly [8] [9] [10] [11] [12] . When different statistical methods are compared, they may produce consistent age and temporal patterns [13, 14] . However, depending on what endpoints are extracted from administrative databases and introduced in the model (eg, pneumonia and influenza, respiratory and/or circulatory hospitalizations or mortality, or all-cause mortality), up to 3-fold variation in the absolute magnitude of influenza-associated hospitalization and up to 6-fold variation for influenzaassociated mortality is found [1, 2] . Validation studies that have attempted to directly compare model-based estimates to values measured through epidemiologic study have shown substantial variation in their correlation by model, by virus, and by outcome [15, 16] . Furthermore, estimates of burden attributable to influenza may also vary when additional covariates (such as climate/weather effects or ORVs) are included in the model [17] . The paucity of data on ORVs and their limited use in statistical models may have resulted in an overestimation of the disease burden of influenza. In addition, in the absence of systematic testing for ORVs in hospitalized adults, it is difficult to disentangle their contribution from that of influenza.",

Because influenza cannot be distinguished clinically from ORVs [20] , only laboratory diagnosis can accurately identify the etiologic pathogen. Some surveillance programs have recently broadened the definition of respiratory disease and laboratory testing for ORVs by using molecular diagnostic methods [21, 22] . However, most surveillance programs and prospective studies focus only on a single or a limited number of viruses, are limited to outpatients, or are restricted to specific populations, a single season, or a single center [5, 9, 11, [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] .",

            "text": "If we had tested patients during the entire winter season or year round, the overall proportion of ORV compared to influenza would likely have been even higher. It should be underscored that none of the studies mentioned above performed systematic prospective testing for a broad panel of ORV in all adults hospitalized with respiratory symptoms during at least 2 seasons. For example, studies excluded patients with prior antibiotic use and immunosuppression [25, 31] , included only patients with various pulmonary conditions [24, 25, 30] or tested for only 3 ORVs (influenza, RSV, and hMPV) [11, 23] . One study was retrospective with testing at physician discretion in 1 center during 1 year [26] . In addition, more virus-positive patients may have been detected in our study as we used a broad ILI definition. If the US CDC definition were applied, 16%-40% influenza-positive and 21%-46% ORV-positive patients would have been missed in 2011-2012 and in 2012-2013, respectively. As elsewhere in the United States and Canada, the 2011-2012 influenza season in Qu\u00e9bec was characterized by a mixed influenza A (subtypes A/H3N2 and A/H1N1) and influenza B circulation and a late start. It was qualified by the CDC as one of the mildest seasons on record [18] . The 10 peak weeks of that season included in the study contributed to 81% of all influenza viruses detected by Qu\u00e9bec provincial sentinel laboratories from November to May (CDC week 40 through CDC week 20). In contrast, the 2012-2013 influenza season was one of the most severe seasons in the last decade and had an early onset of the predominating influenza A/H3N2 followed by influenza B [18, 32, 33] . The 8 peak weeks of the 2012-2013 influenza season included in the study corresponded essentially to the influenza A peak (Figure 1 ) and represented 73% of the influenza viruses detected by provincial sentinel laboratories from November to May of that year. Our findings are consistent with other assessments of the relative severity of the included influenza seasons (fewer influenza patients in 2011-2012 than in 2012-2013) and with circulating influenza subtypes. Influenza seasonal epidemics overlapped differently with epidemic curves of ORVs during 2011-2012 and 2012-2013. For instance, sentinel surveillance data show that RSV activity was declining through the 2011-2012 influenza season's peak but was instead increasing through the 2012-2013 epidemic peak (Figure 1 ). While both adults and children contribute to sentinel surveillance data for influenza, it is likely that children disproportionately drive RSV findings in the community. Even if RSV circulation in adults may not coincide exactly with that of children, the overall timing of RSV circulation and risk relative to that of influenza is likely to be reflected in the sentinel surveillance curves we have presented. These surveillance data further indicated that hMPV circulated concomitantly with influenza during the 2011-2012 season and was detected in our study more frequently (9%) than in 2012-2013 (1%). Because hMPV generally shows a pattern of late winter/spring circulation [11, 27] , this particular seasonality may account for its greater contribution to illness during the late 2011-2012 influenza peak than during the much earlier 2012-2013 influenza peak period. While in participating hospitals more patients were admitted with confirmed influenza in 2012-2013 than in 2011-2012, influenza was not associated with more severe disease compared to ORVs or virus-negative patients as judged by LOS, ICU admission, and mortality. Other studies reported similar death rates (0%-7.6%) in patients hospitalized with influenza [4, 11, 34] . Similar to our own findings, influenza was not associated with more severe disease when compared to ORVs such as RSV and hMPV in other prospective studies [11, 26] , and was even lower when compared to RSV and hPIV in the elderly in 1 study with indirect ecological estimation [4] . Influenza-positive specimens were collected earlier and were associated with greater antiviral use and lower antibiotic use than ORV-positive or influenza-negative specimens, both seasons. Although influenza tests were conducted at the local site and results were available to the clinician rapidly, the added delay in transferring specimens to the central laboratory for ORV testing and subsequently communicating ORV test results may have reduced the potential for their diagnosis to similarly influence antibiotic use. Ultimately, we do not have systematically collected data on the detection of secondary bacterial infections to comment on the appropriateness of antibiotic use.",

            "text": "This study has some limitations. First, the proportion of viral detection may have been underestimated because 22% of patients consulted late (8 days or more after symptoms onset). However, a substantial ORV detection rate was also reported in patients with late specimen collection (30% at 7-14 days, compared to 51% at 1-6 days after symptoms onset [38] ). In our study, at \u22658 days after symptom onset, at least 1 respiratory virus was detected in 13% of participants in 2011-2012 and in 22% in 2012-2013. Also, the Luminex test used in our study may have a slightly lower sensitivity compared to other PCR tests [39] . In addition, we did not systematically test for atypical bacteria, which may play a role in the etiology of respiratory illness. Second, 56%-77% of patients hospitalized with respiratory symptoms were enrolled in the study. However, we think the studied population is representative of patients requiring hospitalization for respiratory symptoms given that the age distribution and influenza and ORV detection by age group were similar in systematically swabbed nonparticipants and those included in the study. By way of further framing the interpretation and relevance of our findings, we report results for a substantial proportion (ie, nearly half in 2011-2012 and three-quarters in 2012-2013) of all patients in the study hospitals and periods who had received an administrative diagnostic code commonly used in statistical models for disease burden estimation. Third, the criteria we used for testing were broadened during the 2012-2013 season; however, this is unlikely to have affected our results as ORV contribution relative to influenza by season was similar with application of the CDC case definition. Fourth, our study recruited only during peak weeks of the influenza season and may not be representative of the entire winter season. Because second-wave influenza activity due to type B viruses was not included in the 2012-2013 analysis, the second year describes only influenza A (almost exclusively H3N2 subtype) characteristics for the 2012-2013 season. Finally, our divergent findings across even just 2 successive seasons illustrate the variability in relative and absolute disease burden to be expected, reinforcing the need for longer-term evaluation across multiple seasons.",

Important variations in morbidity attributable to influenza vs ORVs during the 2 seasons of the current study illustrate the hazards associated with attributing the burden of influenza based on clinical or administrative data alone. This conclusion is consistent with a recent review of 43 studies by Thomas [40] showing that <25% of patients with ILI have influenza. Accurate estimation of the burden of influenza and ORV disease burden necessary to inform public policy and resource allocation will require surveillance data on patients hospitalized for respiratory infections who were systematically tested with sensitive and specific assays capable of detecting the various potentially contributing respiratory viruses. Prospective studies and surveillance with laboratory-confirmed outcomes conducted over multiple seasons and settings will improve our understanding, prevention, and control of viral respiratory illness and its consequences generally, beyond that due to influenza alone.",
