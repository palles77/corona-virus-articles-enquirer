The attack rate of confi rmed infection in close contacts was 2.4% overall, ranging from 0.9% among aircraft passengers to >5% among household members. Risk factors for infection among close contacts were younger age, being a household member of an index case-patient, exposure during the index casepatient's symptomatic phase, and longer exposure. Among close contacts with positive test results at the start of quarantine, 17.2% had subclinical infection. Having contact with a household member and younger age were the major risk factors for acquiring pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infl uenza virus infection. One person in 6 with confi rmed pandemic (H1N1) 2009 was asymptomatic.",

Some studies have reported attack rates of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 among household members and aircraft passengers (5) (6) (7) . These studies suggested that the transmissibility of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus was low. These studies were conducted in outbreak settings, and attack rates were calculated on the basis of clinical diseases that included infl uenza-like illness (ILI) or acute respiratory illness (ARI) of close contacts rather than confi rmed infection with pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus. In addition, in these studies only symptomatic index and secondary cases were included. Although most infections of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 infl uenza virus produce ILI or ARI symptoms (8) (9) (10) (11) (12) , subclinical infection can occur and can change the estimate of attack rate.

Beijing, the capital of the People's Republic of China, took strict containment and control measures through October 2009. The Beijing municipal government implemented border entry screening, ILI screening in hospitals, health follow-up of travelers from overseas, and quarantine and testing of close contacts to identify new introduction of cases and local transmission. Public health workers conducted epidemiologic investigation of all index case-patients (including those with subclinical infections) and traced and quarantined close contacts whose residence was within the jurisdiction of Beijing.

Patients with confi rmed cases were interviewed about demographic characteristics, course of illness, travel and contact history, and information about close contacts. Patients with confi rmed cases were categorized as having imported cases (travelers) and locally acquired cases (no travel history) on the basis of where the infection was acquired.",

Although locating and quarantining these close contacts was done quickly, and stringent quarantine measures were used, which hindered implementation of control measures, the real number of close contacts was unknown and probably exceeded this number. Many close contacts were persons met in public places, including public transportation, theaters or cinemas, and shopping malls, and it is nearly impossible to trace all of the contacts. In addition, some persons who had worn PPE during contact with index casepatients were excluded from close contacts management (i.e., they were not quarantined), but because wearing PPE might not protect (or fully protect) against infection, some persons excluded might have become infected. In addition, many persons with mild and asymptomatic cases cannot be detected, but they may transmit the virus. Furthermore, the short generation time of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 shown in this study and in a previous study (13) could lead to the rapid accumulation of infection sources and close contacts. This rapid compounding could overwhelm response capacity and would have resulted in compromised effectiveness of containment measures. It should also be mentioned that we did not include persons with cluster or outbreak cases for whom close contacts could not be determined clearly by epidemiologic investigation to examine the basic feature of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (e.g., generation time), and the reproduction number obtained from our data is an underestimate.",

Another possible reason is that household members may have some certain linkage with index cases in genetic susceptibility or living habits that would cause higher predisposition in household members than in other close contacts.

This fi nding indicated that the possibility of transmission of pandemic (H1N1) 2009 virus on fl ights was low, and the yield of tracing and quarantining of close contacts on fl ights was limited. Tracing contacts of service persons at public places was more diffi cult than tracing other categories of contacts, and the lowest attack rate (0.2%) was recorded in this category. Despite extensive measures, on average, only 0.01 infected close contacts per index case-patient were identifi ed among service persons. Tracing the contacts of service persons at public places seems far less cost-effective. Criteria for close contacts on fl ights and those of service persons should be refi ned with respect to exposure duration and age of those exposed. Exposure to index case-patients for >12 hours was a signifi cant independent risk factor for infection in fl ight passenger contacts. This fi nding suggests that limiting the time of contact with persons with ILI on aircraft can reduce risk for transmission, and a long duration of exposure may be necessary for transmission to occur on aircraft.",
