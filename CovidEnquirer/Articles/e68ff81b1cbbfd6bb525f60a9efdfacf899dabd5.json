The fertility problem inventory (FPI: Newton et al., 1999) is the most frequently used distress measure. However, the items were developed without consultation with people experiencing fertility problems and the validation sample comprised primarily Caucasian patients from a homogeneous socioeconomic category using assisted reproductive techniques. Further, the FPI assesses level of strain rather than the broader construct of QoL and does not separate effects due to infertility treatment from those due to childlessness, which is important given the emotional challenges of each. These issues apply to most measures listed in Supplementary data, Table S1 . The most frequently used QoL measure was developed for women suffering from polycystic ovarian syndrome (Cronin et al., 1998) . Several studies have examined its psychometric properties (Jones et al., 2008) and used it to investigate moderators of QoL (e.g. obesity) and cross-cultural effects. Results confirm its reliability and the importance of cultural background as a moderator of QoL (Schmid et al., 2004; Adamson, 2009 ). However, this and other quality of life measures for infertility were designed for specific sub-populations (e.g. endometriosis, male factor) and therefore cannot be used as generic measure for all people with fertility problems.",

Given the importance of addressing this need, the European Society of Human Reproduction and Embryology (ESHRE) and the American Society of Reproductive Medicine (ASRM) joined forces with Merck-Serono S.A. Geneva-Switzerland (an affiliate of Merck KGaA Darmstadt, Germany) to create the fertility quality of life (FertiQoL) measure (2002) (2003) (2004) (2005) (2006) (2007) (2008) (2009) . The overall aim of the FertiQoL project was to develop an international instrument to measure QoL in men and women experiencing fertility problems. Secondary aims were to evaluate the psychometric properties of the tool and to translate FertiQoL in multiple languages. The development phase was carried out according to the protocol used for the development of the WHOQOL measure (WHO, 1998) and is briefly described in the present article. However, the main focus of this report is on the psychometric evaluation.",

As shown in Table I , item-generation involved four stages: generating potential items; eliminating redundant, irrelevant and outlier items; validation among people with fertility problems, and cross-cultural survey of acceptability and feasibility. A comprehensive literature review and consultation with psychosocial infertility experts generated an initial pool of 302 items on consequences of fertility problems on QoL in the following 14 areas (e.g. marriage/partnership, social network, emotions, cognitions, coping, treatment, physical health etc.). The authors classified the 302 items into three levels of increasing concept specificity: dimensions (e.g. interpersonal), domains (e.g. partner relationship) and facets (e.g. intimacy) to form groups of items tapping into related aspects of QoL. Classification and subsequent focus groups reduced this pool to 102 items, which were submitted to the acceptability and feasibility study (see Table I ). The prototype evaluated in the present study included these 102 Core items and 27 optional treatment items identified through the feasibility and acceptability phase.",

Descriptive statistics and correlations were used to identify the best items for each a priori domain of QoL (e.g. emotional, mind/body, relational and social). This a priori work was done to ensure that conceptually similar groups of items were entered into the factor analysis. Factor analyses (orthogonal rotation) were computed (clinic, online) to ascertain relations among these items. Items with factor loadings less than 0.30 and eigenvalues less than one were eliminated. The FertiQoL total and subscale scores were computed and transformed to scaled scores and summary statistics (e.g. reliability coefficient, mean and standard deviation) produced. Scaled scores were computed to achieve a range of 0 -100, making comparisons between scales easier. For scaling, items were reverse-scored (where necessary); all items then summed and multiplied by 25/k, where k was the number of items in the desired subscale or total scale. Higher scores mean better QoL. For the sake of brevity, only final analyses are shown here. These analyses generated the final FertiQoL, which composed 24 core items, plus 10 optional treatment items). See www.fertiqol.org for final FertiQoL in all languages and for scoring instructions. Table II shows background characteristics and these show that the Clinic group were older, and included more men, single women, same-sex couples and people with a university-education, but fewer American and UK residents and people living in rural/ suburban areas compared with the Online sample. The Clinic sample was more likely to have at least one child, a shorter duration of infertility but less likely to have other health problems.",

FertiQol is a reliable and sensitive measurement tool for QoL in individuals with fertility problems. More than 2000 people with fertility problems contributed to the creation of FertiQoL, and it was developed using an integrated mixed-method approach that included literature reviews, international expert consultations, patient focus groups, a cross-cultural feasibility and acceptability survey, and a psychometric survey evaluation. FertiQoL comprises of a Core module evaluating the impact of fertility problems on emotional, mind-body, relational and social domains and an optional Treatment module evaluating treatment environment and tolerability. Subscales and total scales show mainly high reliability and sensitivity of contribute to future research and clinical endeavors aimed at investigating and ultimately improving QoL in people with fertility problems. Certain methodological limitations need to be taken into account. First, despite the multi-disciplinary contributions from experts worldwide, focus groups and a feasibility and acceptability study in 10 countries, the final psychometric evaluation only occurred in five English-speaking countries. Second, targeted efforts to recruit a diverse group of people were not entirely successful in recruiting particular subgroups (i.e. secondary infertile, men). Indeed, more psychometric research on men is required to fully establish reliability and validity. Third, the major proportion of the final sample was recruited online, and differences between the Online and Clinic sample were observed. Although, data generated online have been shown to be as valid as data collected through traditional methods (Bunting and Boivin, 2007; Lieberman, 2008) , one would need to determine whether the differences observed warrant a more in-depth analysis-for example, a different set of norms for clinic samples. We eliminated records coming from the same IP address but it may be possible that the same person replied more than once to the survey. Finally, the subscales of the Core FertiQoL were not entirely orthogonal with cross-loadings on the social and mind/body domains. While these associations are expected, we have now modified the final wording of four FertiQoL items to reduce these crossloadings. Further evaluation of these changes and FertiQoL as a whole on a new sample is required for final validation. These main limitations should be addressed in future psychometric research evaluating FertiQoL. However, the strengths of our mixed-method approach, and consultation and evaluation from infertile people ensure that FertiQoL captures the key life domains affected by fertility problems. It is hoped that FertiQoL will become a gold standard for the measurement of QoL for individuals experiencing fertility problems (whether in treatment or not).",
