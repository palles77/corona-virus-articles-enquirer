            "text": "The strong antigenic relationship between CAV-1 and CAV-2 is clinically important, because vaccines that contain CAV-2 protect against infection with CAV-1 and vice versa. After the introduction of CAV-1 vaccines, ICH largely disappeared, but over the past decade it has reemerged, with published reports of disease from Italy, Switzerland, and the United States. [5] [6] [7] [8] Disease in Europe has been associated with puppy trading from kennels in eastern European countries and possibly spillover of virus circulating in wildlife. 9 In Italy, three outbreaks occurred in shelters in southern Italy, and the others involved purebred puppies imported from Hungary a few days before the onset of clinical signs. Several of the dogs were co-infected with other viruses, such as canine distemper virus (CDV), CPV, or canine enteric coronavirus. Encephalopathy due to CAV-1 infection was described in nine 5-week-old Labrador retriever puppies from Arkansas in the United States, all of which belonged to the same litter. 8 The litter was from an unvaccinated bitch. These case descriptions confirm that CAV-1 continues to circulate in the dog population and can result in severe disease in young dogs when vaccination does not occur, is improperly timed, and stress, co-infections, and overcrowded conditions prevail.",

Ectoparasites such as fleas and ticks are also potential mechanical vectors. 4 Airborne transmission does not appear to be important. Initial infection occurs through the nasopharyngeal, conjunctival, or oropharyngeal route, and the virus replicates within the tonsils, after which it spreads to regional lymph nodes and the bloodstream via lymphatics. Subsequently, infection of hepatocytes and endothelial cells within a variety of tissues occurs, such as the lungs, liver, kidneys, spleen, and eye with resultant hemorrhage, necrosis, and inflammation. The virus replicates in the nucleus of host cells, where crystalline arrays of virions form. There is severe condensation and margination of nuclear chromatin, with inclusion body formation ( Figure 18 -2). The virions are released by cell lysis, which leads to tissue injury and disseminated intravascular coagulation (DIC). Within the liver, the virus initially infects Kupffer's cells and subsequently spreads to hepatocytes.",

            "text": "Clinical signs generally occur after an incubation period of 4 to 9 days, although many dogs probably show no signs of illness. 4 Three overlapping disease syndromes have been described. The first is peracute disease with circulatory collapse, coma, and death after a brief illness that lasts less than 24 to 48 hours. The second, most commonly described syndrome is acute disease, which is associated with high morbidity and reported mortality rates of around 10% to 30%. 4 either recover or die within a 2-week period. The third is a more chronic form that occurs in dogs with partial immunity, with death due to hepatic failure weeks (subacute disease) or months (chronic infection) after initial infection. 10 Acute disease is variably characterized by the presence of fever, tonsillitis, conjunctivitis, inappetence, lethargy, weakness, polydipsia, vomiting, hematemesis, diarrhea, cough, tachypnea, and icterus. Diarrhea may contain frank blood or melena. Widespread petechial and ecchymotic hemorrhages and hematuria can be seen. Corneal edema (\"blue eye\") occurs in the first week of illness and results from replication of virus within corneal endothelial cells (Figure 18-3) . Rarely, neurologic signs such as seizures, ataxia, circling, apparent blindness, head pressing, and nystagmus have been reported in association with CAV-1 encephalitis. 7, 8 The development of neurologic signs may also represent hepatic encephalopathy, intracranial thrombosis or hemorrhage, or, as occurred in one outbreak, concurrent infection with CDV. 7 The antibody response appears 7 days after infection and limits tissue damage. Viral persistence within the renal glomeruli, uveal structures of the eye (the iris and ciliary body), and the cornea can trigger immune complex formation in dogs that recover from acute illness. This leads to glomerulonephritis with proteinuria, severe uveitis, and persistent corneal edema in some surviving dogs. Glomerulonephritis usually occurs about 1 to 2 weeks after the acute signs resolve. Glomerular lesions contain deposits of viral antigen, IgG, IgM, and C3. 11, 12 Infection of the glomerular endothelium is followed by a persistent tubular infection, development of interstitial nephritis, and viruria, but chronic renal failure has not been described. Viral shedding in the urine can occur for up to 6 to 9 months after infection. Anterior uveitis is associated with massive influx of inflammatory cells into the anterior chamber. Occasionally persistent corneal edema fails to resolve for months and may be associated with complications such as glaucoma. 13 The Afghan hound is reportedly susceptible to this complication. 14 In experimental infections with CAV-1, chronic hepatitis with extensive fibrosis was observed in some dogs that recovered from acute illness, with survival for up to 8 months. 10 The virus could not be found in hepatic lesions from these dogs. Attempts to detect CAV-1 in the liver of other dogs with chronic active hepatitis using PCR assays have to date been unrewarding. [15] [16] [17] ",

In some reports, serous to mucopurulent ocular and nasal discharge have been observed, but these may have resulted from co-infections with other respiratory viruses. 4 Abdominal palpation may reveal hepatomegaly, splenomegaly, or abdominal pain. Icterus is uncommon but can occur in dogs with a more prolonged course of disease. Peripheral edema that involves the head, neck, and ventral abdomen has been described. 18 Puppies with CAV-1 encephalitis may show signs of circling, vocalization, head pressing, ataxia, and blindness. 8 Coagulopathies may be manifested as cutaneous or mucosal petechial hemorrhages; gingival hemorrhages; epistaxis; or prolonged bleeding from venipuncture sites. Ocular complications occur in at least 20% of affected dogs. Unilateral or, less commonly, bilateral corneal edema may be observed, which initially develops at the limbus and is occasionally associated with blepharospasm, photophobia, and a serous ocular discharge. 13 Unilateral involvement may progress to bilateral involvement over several days. Using a slit lamp, the cornea is markedly thickened, and there is episcleral and ciliary injection. Uveitis may also be apparent. Corneal ulceration and increased intraocular pressure has also been described in dogs with corneal edema, the latter of which may result in blindness. 13 Diagnosis ICH should be suspected in any dog less than 1 year of age that has a questionable vaccination history and signs of fever, respiratory, gastrointestinal, and hepatic disease, and certainly in any young dog that develops corneal edema. Diagnosis is easily achieved at necropsy when characteristic intranuclear inclusion bodies are seen in tissues, but the sensitivity and specificity of this finding is unknown. Inclusion bodies may be seen on impression smears of liver biopsies or tissue obtained at necropsy. At the time of writing, antemortem diagnosis is challenging owing to the lack of commercially available assays that specifically detect the virus or viral DNA, and the disease may be underdiagnosed (Table 18-1) . Serologic assays are available, but they provide only retrospective diagnosis, and interpretation of these assays may be a challenge when there is a history of vaccination.",

The results of PCR assays on urine may be more difficult to interpret than those for other specimens, because of the potential for chronic shedding from this site in the absence of clinical signs.

Fluid therapy should be aggressive with careful monitoring and avoidance of overhydration, because of increased vascular permeability and hypoalbuminemia. Fluids should be supplemented with electrolytes and dextrose as required. Other medications that may be indicated include antiemetics, antacids, sucralfate, whole blood or plasma transfusions, and colloids such as hetastarch. Partial or total parenteral nutrition may be indicated for severely affected dogs that do not tolerate enteral feeding. Dogs with DIC may require treatment with heparin in addition to plasma. Management of hepatic encephalopathy with lactulose enemas, oral lactulose (in the absence of vomiting), and poorly absorbed oral antimicrobial drugs such as ampicillin may also be indicated. The use of parenteral broad-spectrum antimicrobial drugs should be considered for dogs with hemorrhagic gastroenteritis that may develop bacteremia as a result of bacterial translocation. After fluorescein staining has shown no evidence of corneal ulceration, dogs with severe corneal edema and uveitis should be treated with topical ophthalmic preparations that contain glucocorticoids and atropine to prevent development of glaucoma. Prognosis depends on the severity of disease, which reflects the immune status of the affected dog and possibly the virus strain.

Immunity after immunization with attenuated live vaccines lasts at least 3 years and probably longer. Early vaccines, which contained CAV-1, were associated with the development of corneal edema and glomerulonephritis in a small percentage (<1%) of immunized dogs. Replacement of attenuated live CAV-1 with CAV-2 occurred after 1980 and eliminated this complication. 23 These vaccines have the potential to cause transient respiratory signs and tonsillitis in dogs if accidental inhalation occurs, so care should be taken not to aerosolize the vaccine during administration. Maternal antibody persists until puppies are 12 weeks of age and interferes with immunization when virus neutralization titers exceed 1:100. Vaccines should be administered every 3 to 4 weeks from 6 weeks of age, with the last vaccine given no earlier than 16 weeks of age (see Appendix). Vaccine virus may be shed from the respiratory tract by dogs after vaccination, which has the potential to immunize other dogs as well. It has been suggested that this phenomenon may have been responsible for the virtual disappearance of the disease in the dog population in regions where vaccination is widely performed. 24",
