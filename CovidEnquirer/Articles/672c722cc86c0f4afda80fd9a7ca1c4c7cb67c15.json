It is the major etiological agent of the recent outbreaks of piglet diarrhea and death in the US. Limited knowledge is currently available regarding the role of dendritic cells in PEDV infection. Here, we observed that PEDV did not replicate in monocyte-derived dendritic cells as evidenced by the decrease of viral gene transcript copies in infected cells by qRT-PCR and the absence of viral proteins by immunofluorescence staining as well as the absence of virus particles in infected cells by transmission electron microscopy. In addition, PEDV did not compromise cell viability at 48, 72, and 96 h after infection at either a MOI of 2.5 or 5. Interestingly, an increased transcription of type I interferon including interferon-\u03b1 and \u03b2 was observed in infected cells compared to mock infected cells. Surprisingly, we did not detect any interferon-\u03b2 in the supernatants of infected cells. A slight increase in interferon-\u03b1 protein production in the supernatants of PEDV-infected cells was observed compared to mock infected cells. We also observed a markedly increased transcription of interferon inducible protein \u221210 (IP-10). Overall, PEDV does not replicate in porcine Mo-DC, but activates the transcription of type I interferon and chemokine IP-10.",

            "text": "Porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV) is a member of the Coronaviridae and has a positive sense, single-stranded RNA genome of approximately 27 kb (Brian and Baric, 2005; Kocherhans et al., 2001) . PEDV is genetically related to porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), also a member of the Coronavirdae. Both PEDV and TGEV cause diarrhea and death in young piglets, which results in significant economic losses worldwide. The recent emergence of PEDV in the US swine industry poses a great concern on the control and prevention of the devastating disease in young piglets. The intentional exposure of pregnant sows to PEDV has been shown to induce durable lactogenic immunity, which can provide some protection of neonatal piglets against PEDV (Goede et al., 2015) . Although two vaccines have been conditionally approved for use in diseased farms in the US, the duration of immunity induced by these vaccines in pregnant sows has not been studied in detail. Furthermore, the innate and adaptive immunity against PEDV infections are largely unknown and remain to be explored. Dendritic cells (DC) are professional antigen-presenting cells that bridge innate and adaptive immunity. Given the essential role of dendritic cells (DC) in antigen presentation and immune cell activation, a better understanding on the interaction between PEDV and DC will facilitate the design of vaccine candidates that are capable of inducing potent and long-lasting immunity.",

            "text": "PEDV is mainly detected in the intestinal epithelial cells in infected animals. One recent study shows that PEDV undergoes an early replication in porcine monocyte-derived dendritic cells (Mo-DC) and activates the antigen-presenting ability of Mo-DC (Gao et al., 2015) . Although viral antigen was detected in the dendritic-like cells in the laminar propria of small intestine of TGEV-infected animals, it remains controversial whether TGEV actually replicate in dendritic cells in vivo and in vitro (Riffault et al., 2001) . PEDV infection of neonatal piglets triggered a strong and rapid induction of type I interferon . However, the source and function of type I interferon in PEDV pathogenesis and immunity remains to be determined. DC are known to secret cytokines such as type I interferon, IL-12, IL-10, and chemokine to regulate the subsequent development of antibody based humoral response and cell-mediated immune responses (Cervantes-Barragan et al., 2007; Fitzgerald-Bocarsly and Feng, 2007) . Human SARS coronavirus failed to replicate in Mo-DC, but induced type I interferon and chemokine such as monocyte chemoattractant protein 1 (MCP-1) and interferon inducible protein \u221210 (IP-10) (Law et al., 2005) . Here, we further studied the interaction between PEDV and Mo-DC. We observed that PEDV failed to undergo a productive replication in Mo-DC. PEDV did not compromise the viability of DC and activated the transcription of type I interferon and chemokine IP-10, which may suggest the possible role of PEDV-infected DC in promoting the development of immune responses against PEDV invasion.",

As shown in Fig. 3 Next, we used ELISA to assess the secretion of IFN-\u03b1 and IFN-\u03b2 into the culture supernatants of infected cells. Only a slight increase in IFN-\u03b1 was detected in PEDV-infected group (data not shown) compared to mock infected cells.

            "text": "PEDV is known to infect the epithelial cells of the intestine to cause diarrhea and even death in young piglets Madson et al., 2014) . Although macrophages infiltrated in the lamina propria also contained viral antigen as revealed by immunohistochemistry staining (Lee et al., 2000) , it remains to be determined whether PEDV actually productively infected the intestinal macrophages. Porcine alveolar macrophages have been shown to support PEDV replication (Park and Shin, 2014) . One recent study suggests that PEDV only replicates in Mo-DC prior to 24 h after infection, but not at later time points, as determined by virus titration of culture supernatants (Gao et al., 2015) . However, our data suggest that PEDV fails to replicate in Mo-DC as evidenced by the decrease of viral gene transcript over time and the absence of virus proteins and virus particles in the infected cells as examined by immunofluorescence staining and TEM respectively. Although we did not examine the gene transcript level prior to 24 h post infection, the absence of virus particles in infected cells strongly indicate that the virus did not undergo productive replication in Mo-DC. Additionally, we did not detect an increase in virus titer in the X. Wang et al. Veterinary Microbiology 208 (2017) 77-81 supernatants of infected cells (data not shown). Our observation is further supported by the absence of cell death after PEDV exposure. Similarly, conflicting results have been published regarding the susceptibility of Mo-DC to TGEV, a close relative of PEDV (Guzylack-Piriou et al., 2006; Zhao et al., 2014) . Further research is needed to determine the underlying reasons for the discrepancy results. We observed that PEDV exposure to Mo-DC greatly activated the transcription of IP-10. IP-10 plays a role in effector T cell generation and trafficking (Dufour et al., 2002) . IP-10 has also been shown to exhibit antimicrobial activity in vitro and in vivo (Schutte et al., 2016) . SARS coronavirus also induces the induction of IP-10 from monocytederived dendritic cells in the absence of a productive virus replication (Law et al., 2005) . The molecular mechanisms by which SARS and PEDV trigger the activation of chemokine IP-10 in the absence of an active virus replication remain to be determined. Viral protein such as human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) tat protein has been shown to activate IP-10 induction (Kukkonen et al., 2014) . It is likely that viral proteins such as the spike (S) protein of PEDV may mediate this effect. Furthermore, whether IP-10 is induced in vivo is not clear. The implication of IP-10 in PEDV pathogenesis and immunity remains to be elucidated. Future studies should focus on the implications of IP-10 in PEDV pathogenesis and immunity and uncover the mechanism by which Mo-DC is resistant to PEDV replication.",

However, PEDV did not induce the activation of IFN-\u03b2 mRNA in Marc-145 cells, a known susceptible cell line for PEDV (Zhang et al., 2016) . Nsp1 and other viral proteins of PEDV have been shown to antagonize the type I interferon induction and signaling in vitro (Ding et al., 2014; Zhang et al., 2016) . Neonatal piglets that exhibit severe diseases after PEDV infection showed an early and strong induction of type I interferon compared to post-weaned piglets . These conflicting data suggest that PEDV behaves very differently in vivo and in vitro in terms of type I interferon induction and action. Similar phenomenon has been observed for other viruses such as porcine reproductive and respiratory syndrome virus and murine hepatitis virus (Roth-Cross et al., 2007; Wang et al., 2012; Wang and Christopher-Hennings, 2012) . A previous study shows that the interferon producing cells are exclusively located in gut-mucosal related lymphoid tissues with dendritic cell-like properties in TGEV-infected animals (Riffault et al., 2001) . More in vivo studies are needed to determine the role of type I interferon in PEDV pathogenesis and immunity.",
