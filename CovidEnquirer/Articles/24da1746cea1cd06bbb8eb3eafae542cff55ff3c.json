There is now considerable data on the cells and factors involved in fetal resorption but little is known about the events which activate this process. While the activation of the maternal response to the fetal implant could have endogenous or genetic origins, a role for exogenous factors including microbial pathogens could also be involved. In order to investigate these possibilities, the reproductive success of CBA/j q? \u00d7 DBA/2jEr matings in a conventional animal care facility were compared with matings in a specific pathogen free (SPF) animal facility. All animals housed under these conditions were routinely screened by immunoassay and culture, for the presence of a number of viral and bacterial pathogens of mice. The incidence of spontaneous embryo loss in specific pathogen free CBA female mice mated by DBA and other male strains was found to be virtually identical to that of CBA female mice infected with multiple viral pathogens and housed under otherwise identical conditions (non-SPF). However, the numbers of implantation per pregnancy was significantly greater in an SPF facility. Therefore, exposure of mating mice to exogenous viral and bacterial pathogens did not appear to alter the overall incidence of spontaneous embryo resorption. It was concluded that the immunomodulatory effects of infection by common murine pathogens neither augmented nor reduced post-implantation embryo losses.",

            "text": "The data on early embryo losses in domestic and experimental animals is generally consistent with that for human losses (reviewed in Gendron, 1990, 1993) . Many domestic species show early embryo loss rates in the range of 25-40% which is also seen in early human pregnancy. Whereas human embryo loss usually results in the expulsion of the products of conception, in animal species which bear litters, the early embryos may be partly or completely resorbed during the gestational period. Only later fetal deaths result in stillbirths or actual abortion. The question remains as to the actual causes of early embryo loss. Several murine laboratory models exist for the study of the biology of spontaneous embryo loss. The mating of CBA/j 9 (H2 k) by DBA/2jo' (H2 d) provides an ideal model in which 20-30\u00b0/,, of embryonic implants are lost before mid-gestation (Chaouat et al., 1983; Kiger et al., 1985; De Fougerolles and Baines, 1987; Clark et al., 1987) . Conversely, syngeneic CBA/j 9 x CBAcr matings and matings of CBA/j 9 by BALB/ccr (H2 d) show loss rates below 10%, as do many other inbred and outbred strains of mice housed under specific pathogen free (SPF) conditions. However, recent studies by Krackow (1992) have confirmed the early observations of Hollander and Strong (1950) , that in most outbred and inbred strains of mice housed in conventional facilities, about 15% of the embryos resorb. The reason for this difference in normal resorption frequencies is not clear but could be due to either genetic factors related to the strains studied or exposure to the environmental pathogens commonly present in conventional animal care facilities. These data question our assumptions of what constitutes the incidence and causes of 'normal' embryo loss in laboratory mice. One might explain the normally low embryo loss rates in inbred and pedigreed strains of mice on the basis of either their genetic nature or their reduced exposure to environmental pathogens. Inbred mice are genetically selected for defect free genetic purity, high fertility, large litter size and low loss rates. In addition, these mice are line bred under scrupulous pathogen free conditions so that even subtle pathogens are not passed from one individual or strain to another. It is not clear what role genetic (endogenous) factors or environmental pathogens (exogenous factors) play in determining the low embryo loss rates currently observed in laboratory animal breeding programs.",

            "text": "Current estimates of the involvement of exogenous pathogens as causes of later spontaneous pregnancy losses in humans fall in the range of 3-10% of all conceptions (Benirschke and Robb, 1987) . No comprehensive data exist for early human embryo losses prior to 6 weeks. In studies of the CBA/j 9 x DBA/2jcr model, the losses occur around day 10-12 of pregnancy, starting barely 5 days after implantation. The effector cells are not antigen specific thymus derived cytolytic lymphocytes as one may expect, but non-specific natural killer lymphocytes and macrophages (Gendron and Baines, 1988; Kinsky et al, 1990) . Failing feto-placental implants lack an essential immunosuppressive activity that normally regulates decidual natural killer cell activation (Gendron et al., 1990) . Furthermore, it is clear from animal studies that the early exposure of gravid females to bacterial products such as lipopolysaccharides (LPS) during the early post-implantation period can induce precipitous total pregnancy loss (Zahl and Bjerknes, 1943; Chedid et al., 1962; Lanning et al., 1983; Parant, 1990; Gendron et al., 1990b) . Viral agents which can cross the placenta and infect the embryo, may also cause intrauterine death of the embryo though the actual expulsion of the placental sac may occur some time later. Viral infections and graft versus host responses may also reduce the effectiveness of gastrointestinal defenses, permitting increased gut permeability which would allow the penetration of bacterial LPS into the bloodstream (Lapp, personal communication). Significant increases in serum LPS during pregnancy would result in total embryo loss. It appears that total early embryo loss may be due to an acute failure of placental development even though the embryo may be normal (Surani et al., 1984 (Surani et al., , 1988 . LPS and cytokine induced pregnancy losses appear to involve a similar acute damage to placental development and embryo loss (Croy and Summerlee, 1990; Gendron et al., 1990; Lanning and Hilbelink, 1984) . While certain bacterial pathogens may cause the total loss of all implanted embryos, the CBA/j 9 x DBA/2j cy model involves partial litter loss implying that the inducing agents and cellular mechanism may be different.",

Possible mechanisms for viral modulation of embryo survival could include the following: (1) the 'immunotrophism' hypothesis postulated by Wegmann, which states that the development of the fetal trophoblast is dependent on the presence of maternal cytokines, infers that the impairment of maternal T-cell function by MHV infection should dramatically diminish fetal trophoblast growth and prevent normal placental development leading to increased early fetal loss (Wegmann, 1987) , (2) the local induction of high levels of cytokines by MHV could have a direct embryotoxic effect (Hill et al., 1987) , (3) MHV infection may increase fetal resorptions due to the activation of cell mediated cytolytic activity by local cytokine (e.g. interferons) production, or (4) the virus could directly infect the fetal tissues causing embryo death, but conversely (5) MHV infection could also increase fetal acceptance by suppressing the maternal rejection response.

A previous study to identify the involvement of environmental pathogens (viruses) in embryo loss, failed to identify a specific agent (Hamilton and Hamilton, 1987) . However, the animals in that study were also stated to be infected with multiple pathogens and, even though a distinction was made between a room containing mice which were infected with only MHV and a room infected with Sendai and MHV, one must consider that a rigorous SPF regimen was not used and that the effects seen could have been due to the actual active disease status of the mice under study. In fact, the authors postulate that the low incidence of embryo loss in the SPF room was due to a non-pathogenic immunostimulatory factor which could simulate the protective effect of vaccination with BALB/c spleen cells, and not due to the absence of an abortogenic pathogen. Immunosuppression following a recent infection by MHV could have this effect on embryo survival. Therefore, our data and the data of Hamilton and Hamilton (1987) appear to exclude a role for exogenous viral pathogens in initiating embryo loss. Rather, the underlying defect in early pregnancy appears to be endogenous since it is unaltered by exposure to most exogenous viral pathogens.",

Furthermore, this trait segregates in back-cross experiments in a Mendelian fashion confirming an endogenous genetic basis (Bobe and Kiger, 1989) . Abortion may not be due to classical immune recognition since paternal alloantigenic differences in the MHC have been shown in humans and experimental animals to be a positive factor for reproductive success. Therefore one is inevitably led to the more intriguing question of how MHC identical parents and inbred animals successfully gestate viable offspring if MHC identity is a negative factor. The elucidation of these and other questions will have to await further investigations. Thus, chance and the availability of the CBA/j 9 by DBA/2j (y mating model provided a unique opportunity to study some of the exogenous factors potentially causing early embryo losses.
