Compared to other developing countries like India, it has special positive features of career incentives promoting growth at the local level, the ability to take long-term decisions relatively quickly, and a unique blend of political centralization and decentralization of economic power and responsibility, that is conducive to central guidance and local business development. On the other hand, with a lack of sufficient downward (as opposed to upward) accountability and absence of institutionalized systems of scrutiny and challenge from below, mistakes or abuse of power are more difficult to check and correct quickly, political loyalty may often get a premium over performance at the upper levels, and there are insufficient checks on collusion between business and officials. The over-all organizational system is prone to over-reaction in times of crisis and thus only weakly resilient compared to systems where information flows from below are less controlled or choked.",

Democratic performance emphasizes the process as much as outcome.

The latter are financially strapped, as they do not have much taxation power and are perpetually dependent on the state government for funds. In general, even after the centralizing reforms since 1994, the fiscal system is much more decentralized in China, where sub-provincial levels of government tend to spend more than half of total government budgetary expenditure, compared to about 3% in India (this is not including the large off-budget revenue-raising and expenditure of local governments in China). The much worse performance of sub-provincial local bodies in India in the last-mile delivery of public services and facilities is partly attributable to this (even though Chinese local governments have also much larger responsibility for infrastructure-building and public services). In India the emphasis has been more on fiscal transfers to local governments than on local tax autonomy. 4 In both China and India decentralization tends to accentuate regional inequality, though in India the constitutional body of the Finance Commission tends to partially compensate for this by allocating redistributive transfers to poorer regions.",
