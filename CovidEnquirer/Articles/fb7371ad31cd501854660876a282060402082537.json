The epidemiology of the virus remains poorly understood, and while casebased and seroepidemiological studies have been employed extensively throughout the epidemic, viral sequence data have not been utilised to their full potential. Here we use existing MERS-CoV sequence data to explore its phylodynamics in two of its known major hosts, humans and camels. We employ structured coalescent models to show that long-term MERS-CoV evolution occurs exclusively in camels, whereas humans act as a transient, and ultimately terminal host. By analysing the distribution of human outbreak cluster sizes and zoonotic introduction times we show that human outbreaks in the Arabian peninsula are driven by seasonally varying zoonotic transfer of viruses from camels. Without heretofore unseen evolution of host tropism, MERS-CoV is unlikely to become endemic in humans.",

            "text": "Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV), endemic in camels in the Arabian Peninsula, is the causative agent of zoonotic infections and limited outbreaks in humans. The virus, first discovered in 2012 (Zaki et al., 2012; Boheemen et al., 2012) , has caused more than 2000 infections and over 700 deaths, according to the World Health Organization (WHO) (World Health Organization, 2017) . Its epidemiology remains obscure, largely because infections are observed among the most severely affected individuals, such as older males with comorbidities (Assiri et al., 2013a; The WHO MERS-CoV Research Group, 2013) . While contact with camels is often reported, other patients do not recall contact with any livestock, suggesting an unobserved community contribution to the outbreak (The WHO MERS-CoV Research Group, 2013) . Previous studies on MERS-CoV epidemiology have used serology to identify factors associated with MERS-CoV exposure in potential risk groups (Reusken et al., 2015 (Reusken et al., , 2013 . Such data have shown high seroprevalence in camels (M\u00fcller et al., 2014; Corman et al., 2014; Chu et al., 2014; Reusken et al., 2013 Reusken et al., , 2014 and evidence of contact with MERS-CoV in workers with occupational exposure to camels (Reusken et al., 2015; M\u00fcller et al., 2015) . Separately, epidemiological modelling approaches have been used to look at incidence reports through time, space and across hosts (Cauchemez et al., 2016) .",

            "text": "Although such epidemiological approaches yield important clues about exposure patterns and potential for larger outbreaks, much inevitably remains opaque to such approaches due to difficulties in linking cases into transmission clusters in the absence of detailed information. Where sequence data are relatively cheap to produce, genomic epidemiological approaches can fill this critical gap in outbreak scenarios (Liu et al., 2013; Gire et al., 2014; Grubaugh et al., 2017) . These data often yield a highly detailed picture of an epidemic when complete genome sequencing is performed consistently and appropriate metadata collected (Dudas et al., 2017) . Sequence data can help discriminate between multiple and single source scenarios (Gire et al., 2014; Quick et al., 2015) , which are fundamental to quantifying risk (Grubaugh et al., 2017) . Sequencing MERS-CoV has been performed as part of initial attempts to link human infections with the camel reservoir (Memish et al., 2014) , nosocomial outbreak investigations (Assiri et al., 2013b) and routine surveillance (Park et al., 2015) . A large portion of MERS-CoV sequences come from outbreaks within hospitals, where sequence data have been used to determine whether infections were isolated introductions or were part of a larger hospital-associated outbreak (Fagbo et al., 2015) . Similar studies on MERS-CoV have taken place at broader geographic scales, such as cities (Cotten et al., 2013) .",

Unlike approaches that model host species as a discrete phylogenetic trait of the virus using continuous-time Markov processes (or simpler, parsimony based, approaches) Lycett et al., 2016) , population structure models explicitly incorporate contrasts in deme effective population sizes and migration between demes. By estimating independent coalescence rates for MERS-CoV in humans and camels, as well as migration patterns between the two demes, we show that long-term viral evolution of MERS-CoV occurs exclusively in camels. Our results suggest that spillover events into humans are seasonal and might be associated with the calving season in camels. However, we find that MERS-CoV, once introduced into humans, follows transient transmission chains that soon abate. Using Monte Carlo simulations we show that R 0 for MERS-CoV circulating in humans is much lower than the epidemic threshold of 1.0 and that correspondingly the virus has been introduced into humans hundreds of times.",

Across 174 MERS-CoV genomes collected from humans, we estimate a median of 56 separate camel-to-human cross-species transmissions (95% highest posterior density (HPD): 48-63). While we estimate a median of 3 (95% HPD: 0-12) humanto-camel migrations, the 95% HPD interval includes zero and we find that no such migrations are found in the maximum clade credibility tree ( Figure 1 ). Correspondingly, we observe substantially higher camel-to-human migration rate estimates than human-tocamel migration rate estimates ( Figure S2 ). This inference derives from the tree structure wherein human viruses appear as clusters of highly related sequences nested within the diversity seen in camel viruses, which themselves show significantly higher diversity and less clustering. This manifests as different rates of coalescence with camel viruses showing a scaled effective population size N e \u03c4 of 3.49 years (95% HPD: 2.71-4.38) and human viruses showing a scaled effective population of 0.24 years (95% HPD: 0.14-0.34).",

This is most apparent in lineages in early-mid 2013 that lead up to sequences comprising the MERS-CoV clade dominant in 2015, where owing to poor sampling of MERS-CoV genetic diversity from camels the model cannot completely dismiss humans as a potential alternative host. The first sequences of MERS-CoV from camels do not appear in our data until November 2013. Our finding of negligible human-to-camel transmission is robust to choice of prior ( Figure S2 ). The vast majority of MERS-CoV evolution is inferred to occur in camels (orange) with human outbreaks (blue) representing evolutionary dead-ends for the virus. Confidence in host assignment is depicted as a colour gradient, with increased uncertainty in host assignment (posterior probabilities close to 0.5) shown as grey. While large clusters of human cases are apparent in the tree, significant contributions to human outbreaks are made by singleton sequences, likely representing recent cross-species transmissions that were caught early.",

We observe dense terminal clusters of MERS-CoV circulating in humans that are of no subsequent relevance to the evolution of the virus. These clusters of presumed human-to-human transmission are then embedded within extensive diversity of MERS-CoV lineages inferred to be circulating in camels, a classic pattern of source-sink dynamics. Our findings suggest that instances of human infection with MERS-CoV are more common than currently thought, with exceedingly short transmission chains mostly limited to primary cases that might be mild and ultimately not detected by surveillance or sequencing. Structured coalescent analyses recover the camel-centered picture of MERS-CoV evolution despite sequence data heavily skewed towards non-uniformly sampled human cases and are robust to choice of prior. Comparing these results with a currently standard discrete trait analysis (Lemey et al., 2009) approach for ancestral state reconstruction shows dramatic differences in host reconstruction at internal nodes ( Figure S3 ). Discrete trait analysis reconstruction identifies both camels and humans as important hosts for MERS-CoV persistence, but with humans as the ultimate source of camel infections. A similar approach has been attempted previously (Zhang et al., 2016) , but this interpretation of MERS-CoV evolution disagrees with lack of continuing human transmission chains outside of Arabian peninsula, low seroprevalence in humans and very high seroprevalence in camels across Saudi Arabia. We suspect that this particular discrete trait analysis reconstruction is false due to biased data, i.e. having nearly twice as many MERS-CoV sequences from humans (n = 174) than from camels (n = 100) and the inability of the model to account for and quantify vastly different rates of coalescence in the phylogenetic vicinity of both types of sequences. We can replicate these results by either applying the same model to current data ( Figure S3 ) or by enforcing equal coalescence rates within each deme in the structured coalescent model ( Figure S4 ).",

Camel calving is reported to occur from October to February (Almutairi et al., 2010) , with rapidly declining maternal antibody levels in calves within the first weeks after birth (Wernery, 2001) .

This is entirely expected, since little seasonality in human behaviour that could facilitate MERS-CoV transmission is expected following an introduction. Similarly, we do not observe any trend in human sequence cluster sizes over time ( Figure 2B , Spearman \u03c1 = 0.06, p = 0.68), suggesting that MERS-CoV outbreaks in humans are neither growing nor shrinking in size. This is not surprising either, since MERS-CoV is a camel virus that has to date, experienced little-to-no selective pressure to improve transmissibility between humans. behaviour metric that does not require expertise in reading phylogenies. The parameter R 0 determines expected number of secondary cases in a single infections as well as the distribution of total cases that result from a single introduction event into the human population (Equation 1, Methods). We estimate R 0 along with other relevant parameters via Monte Carlo simulation in two steps. First, we simulate case counts across multiple outbreaks totaling 2000 cases using Equation 1 and then we subsample from each case cluster to simulate sequencing of a fraction of cases. Sequencing simulations are performed via a multivariate hypergeometric distribution, where the probability of sequencing from a particular cluster depends on available sequencing capacity (number of trials), numbers of cases in the cluster (number of successes) and number of cases outside the cluster (number of failures). In addition, each hypergeometric distribution used to simulate sequencing is concentrated via a bias parameter, that enriches for large sequence clusters at the expense of smaller ones (for its effects see Figure S5 ). This is a particularly pressing issue, since a priori we expect large hospital outbreaks of MERS to be overrepresented in sequence data, whereas sequences from primary cases will be sampled exceedingly rarely. We record the number, mean, standard deviation and skewness (third standardised moment) of sequence cluster sizes in each simulation (left-hand panel in Figure 3 ) and extract the subset of Monte Carlo simulations in which these summary statistics fall within the 95% highest posterior density observed in the empirical MERS-CoV data from structured coalescent analyses. We record R 0 values, as well as the number of case clusters (equivalent to number of zoonotic introductions), for these empirically matched simulations. A schematic of this Monte Carlo procedure is shown in Figure S6 . Since the total number of cases is fixed at 2000, higher R 0 results in fewer larger transmission clusters, while lower R 0 results in many smaller transmission clusters. shows the distribution of individual Monte Carlo simulation sequence cluster size statistics (mean and skewness) coloured by the R 0 value used for the simulation. The dotted rectangle identifies the 95% highest posterior density bounds for sequence cluster size mean and skewness observed for empirical MERS-CoV data.

Bins falling inside the 95% percentiles are coloured by R 0 , as in the leftmost scatter plot. The distribution of total number of introductions associated with simulations matching MERS-CoV sequence clusters is shown on the right. Darker shade of grey indicates bins falling within the 95% percentiles. Monte Carlo simulations indicate R 0 for MERS-CoV in humans is likely to be below 1.0, with numbers of zoonotic transmissions numbering in the hundreds.",

In order to quantify the degree to recombination has shaped MERS-CoV genetic diversity we used two recombination detection approaches across partitions of taxa corresponding to inferred MERS-CoV clades. Both methods rely on sampling parental and recombinant alleles within the alignment, although each quantifies different signals of recombination. One hallmark of recombination is the ability to carry alleles derived via mutation from one lineage to another, which appear as repeated mutations taking place in the recipient lineage, somewhere else in the tree. The PHI (pairwise homoplasy index) test quantifies the appearance of these excessive repeat mutations (homoplasies) within an alignment (Bruen et al., 2006) . Another hallmark of recombination is clustering of alleles along the genome, due to how template switching, the primary mechanism of recombination in RNA viruses, occurs. 3Seq relies on the clustering of nucleotide similarities along the genome between sequence triplets -two potential parent-donors and one candidate offspring-recipient sequences (Boni et al., 2007) .",

Neither method can identify where in the tree recombination occurred, but each full asterisk in Figure S10 should be interpreted as the minimum partition of data that still captures both donor and recipient alleles involved in a recombination event. This suggests a non-negligible contribution of recombination in shaping existing MERS-CoV diversity. As done previously (Dudas and Rambaut, 2016) , we show large numbers of homoplasies in MERS-CoV data ( Figure S11 ) with some evidence of genomic clustering of such alleles.

For the reverse comparison there are five 'human' clades (out of 53) in fragment 2 that are expanded. All such clades have low divergence (figure 4B) and thus incongruences in human clades are more likely to be caused by differences in deme assignment rather than actual recombination. And while we observe evidence of distinct phylogenetic trees from different parts of the MERS-CoV genome ( Figure 4B ), human clades are minimally affected and large portions of the posterior probability density in both parts of the genome are concentrated in shared clades ( Figure S12 ). Additionally, we observe the same source-sink dynamics between camel and human populations in trees constructed from separate genomic fragments as were observed in the original full genome tree (Figures 1, 4B ).",

MERS-CoV evolution on the reservoir side is complicated by recombination, though is nonetheless still largely amenable to phylogenetic methods. Amongst other parameters of interest, recombination is expected to interfere with molecular clocks, where transferred genomic regions can give the impression of branches undergoing rapid evolution, or branches where recombination results in reversions appearing to evolve slow. In addition to its potential to influence tree topology, recombination in molecular sequence data is an erratic force with unpredictable effects. We suspect that the effects of recombination in MERS-CoV data are reigned in by a relatively small effective population size of the virus in Saudi Arabia (see next section) where haplotypes are fixed or nearly fixed, thus preventing an accumulation of genetic diversity that would then be reshuffled via recombination. Nevertheless, we choose not to report on any particular estimates for times of common ancestors (tMRCAs), even though these are expected to be somewhat robust for dating human clusters, and we do not report on the evolutionary rate of the virus, even though it appears to fall firmly within the expected range for RNA viruses: regression of nucleotide differences to Jordan-N3/2012 genome against sequence collection dates yields a rate of 4.59 \u00d7 10 \u22124 subs/site/year, Bayesian structured coalescent estimate from primary analysis 9.57 \u00d7 10 \u22124 (95% HPDs: 8.28 \u2212 10.9 \u00d7 10 \u22124 ) subs/site/year.",

However, we do note that coalescence rate estimates are high relative to the sampling time period, with a mean estimate of N e \u03c4 at 3.49 years (95% HPD: 2.71-4.38), and consequently MERS-CoV phylogeny resembles a ladder, as often seen in human influenza A virus phylogenies (Bedford et al., 2011) .",

We assume that \u03b2 is constant and is equal to the rate of recovery. Given a 20 day duration of infection in camels (Adney et al., 2014) , we arrive at \u03b2 = 365/20 = 18.25 infections per year.

Therefore we can estimate the rough number of camel infections per year as the number of calves produced each year. We find there are 830 000 camels in Saudi Arabia (Abdallah and Faye, 2013) and that female camels in Saudi Arabia have an average fecundity of 45% (Abdallah and Faye, 2013).

We showed that currently existing models of population structure (Vaughan et al., 2014) can identify distinct demographic modes in MERS-CoV genomic data, where viruses continuously circulating in camels repeatedly jump into humans and cause small outbreaks doomed to extinction (Figures 1, S1 ). This inference succeeds under different choices of priors for unknown demographic parameters ( Figure S2 ) and in the presence of strong biases in sequence sampling schemes (Figure 3 ). When rapid coalescence in the human deme is not allowed ( Figure S4 ) structured coalescent inference loses power and ancestral state reconstruction is nearly identical to that of discrete trait analysis ( Figure  S3 ). When allowed different deme-specific population sizes, the structured coalescent model succeeds because a large proportion of human sequences fall into tightly connected clusters, which informs a low estimate for the population size of the human deme. This in turn informs the inferred state of long ancestral branches in the phylogeny, i.e. because these long branches are not immediately coalescing, they are most likely in camels.",

Although we recover migration rates from our model ( Figure S2 ), these only pertain to sequences and in no way reflect the epidemiologically relevant per capita rates of zoonotic spillover events. We also looked at potential seasonality in MERS-CoV spillover into humans. Our analyses indicated a period of three months where the odds of a sequenced spillover event are increased, with timing consistent with an enzootic amongst camel calves (Figure 2) . As a result of our identification of large and asymmetric flow of viral lineages into humans we also find that the basic reproduction number for MERS-CoV in humans is well below the epidemic threshold ( Figure 3 ). Having said that, there are highly customisable coalescent methods available that extend the methods used here to accommodate time varying migration rates and population sizes, integrate alternative sources of information and fit to stochastic nonlinear models (Rasmussen et al., 2014) , which would be more appropriate for MERS-CoV. Some distinct aspects of MERS-CoV epidemiology could not be captured in our methodology, such as hospital outbreaks where R 0 is expected to be consistently closer to 1.0 compared to community transmission of MERS-CoV. Outside of coalescent-based models there are population structure models that explicitly relate epidemiological parameters to the branching process observed in sequence data (K\u00fchnert et al., 2016) , but often rely on specifying numerous informative priors and can suffer from MCMC convergence issues.",

Since MERS-CoV was also able to cause significant pathogenicity in the human host it was inevitable that parallels would be drawn between MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV at the time of MERS discovery in 2012. Although we describe the epidemiology of MERS-CoV from sequence data, indications that MERS-CoV has poor capacity to spread human-to-human existed prior to any sequence data. SARS-CoV swept through the world in a short period of time, but MERS cases trickled slowly and were restricted to the Arabian Peninsula or resulted in self-limiting outbreaks outside of the region, a pattern strongly indicative of repeat zoonotic spillover. Infectious disease surveillance and control measures remain limited, so much like the SARS epidemic in 2003 or the H1N1 pandemic in 2009, zoonotic pathogens with R 0 > 1.0 are probably going to be discovered after spreading beyond the original location of spillover. Even though our results show that MERS-CoV does not appear to present an imminent global threat, we would like to highlight that its epidemiology is nonetheless concerning. et al., 2004) and influenza A are able to jump species barriers but only influenza A viruses have historically resulted in pandemics (Lipsitch et al., 2016) . MERS-CoV may join the list of pathogens able to jump species barriers but not spread efficiently in the new host. Since its emergence in 2012, MERS-CoV has caused self-limiting outbreaks in humans with no evidence of worsening outbreaks over time. However, sustained evolution of the virus in the reservoir and continued flow of viral lineages into humans provides the substrate for a more transmissible variant of MERS-CoV to possibly emerge. Previous modeling studies (Antia et al., 2003; Park et al., 2013) suggest a positive relationship between initial R 0 in the human host and probability of evolutionary emergence of a novel strain which passes the supercritical threshold of R 0 > 1.0. This leaves MERS-CoV in a precarious position; on one hand its current R 0 of \u223c0.7 is certainly less than 1, but its proximity to the supercritical threshold raises alarm. With very little known about the fitness landscape or adaptive potential of MERS-CoV, it is incredibly challenging to predict the likelihood of the emergence more transmissible variants. In light of these difficulties, we encourage continued genomic surveillance of MERS-CoV in the camel reservoir and from sporadic human cases to rapidly identify a supercritical variant, if one does emerge.",

Default priors were used for all parameters except for migration rates between demes for which an exponential prior with mean 1.0 was used. All analyses were run for 200 million steps across ten independent Markov chains (MCMC runs) and states were sampled every 20 000 steps. Due to the complexity of multitype tree parameter space 50% of states from every analysis were discarded as burn-in, convergence assessed in Tracer v1.6 and states combined using LogCombiner distributed with BEAST v2.4.3 (Bouckaert et al., 2014) . Three chains out of ten did not converge and were discarded altogether. This left 70 000 states on which to base posterior inference. Posterior sets of typed (where migrating branches from structured coalescent are collapsed, and migration information is left as a switch in state between parent and descendant nodes) trees were summarised using TreeAnnotator v2.4.3 with the common ancestor heights option (Heled and Bouckaert, 2013) . A maximum likelihood phylogeny showing just the genetic relationships between MERS-CoV genomes from camels and humans was recovered using PhyML (Guindon et al., 2003) under a HKY+\u0393 4 (Hasegawa et al., 1985; Yang, 1994) nucleotide substitution model and is shown in Figure S14 .",

Unlike structured coalescent methods, such discrete trait approaches are independent from the tree (i.e. demographic) prior and thus unable to influence coalescence rates under different trait states. Such models have been used in the past to infer the number of MERS-CoV host jumps (Zhang et al., 2016) with results contradicting other sources of information. In order to test how a discrete trait approach compares to the structured coalescent we used our 274 MERS-CoV genome data set in BEAST v2.4.3 (Bouckaert et al., 2014) and specified identical codon-partitioned nucleotide substitution and molecular clock models to our structured coalescent analysis. To give the most comparable results we used a constant population size coalescent model, as this is the demographic function for each deme in the structured coalescent model. Five replicate MCMC analyses were run for 200 million states, three of which converged onto the same posterior distribution. The converging chains were combined after removing 20 million states as burn-in to give a total of 27 000 trees drawn from the posterior distribution.

Following the underlying transmission process generating case clusters c we simulate a secondary process of sampling some fraction of cases and sequencing them to generate data analogous to what we empirically observe. We sample from the case cluster size vector c without replacement according to a multivariate hypergeometric distribution (Algorithm 1). The resulting sequence cluster size vector s contains K entries, some of which are zero (i.e. case clusters not sequenced), but K i=1 s i = 174 which reflects the number of human MERS-CoV sequences used in this study. Note that this \"sequencing capacity\" parameter does not vary over time, even though MERS-CoV sequencing efforts have varied in intensity, starting out slow due to lack of awareness, methods and materials and increasing in response to hospital outbreaks later. As the default sampling scheme operates under equiprobable sequencing, we also simulated biased sequencing by using concentrated hypergeometric distributions where the probability mass function is squared (bias = 2) or cubed (bias = 3) and then normalized. Here, bias enriches the hypergeometric distribution so that sequences are sampled with weights proportional to (c bias 1 , c bias 2 , . . . , c bias k ). Thus, bias makes larger clusters more likely to be 'sequenced'.",

These subsampled MERS-CoV sequences from humans were combined with existing sequence data from camels to give us a dataset with minimal demographic signal coming from epidemiological processes in humans. Sequences belonging to the outgroup clade where most of MERS-CoV sequences from Egypt fall were removed out of concern that MERS epidemics in Saudi Arabia and Egypt are distinct epidemics with relatively poor sampling in the latter. Were more sequences of MERS-CoV available from other parts of Africa we speculate they would fall outside of the diversity that has been sampled in Saudi Arabia and cluster with early MERS-CoV sequences from Jordan and sequences from Egyptian camels. However, currently there are no indications of what MERS-CoV diversity looks like in camels east of Saudi Arabia. A flexible skygrid tree prior (Gill et al., 2013) was used to recover estimates of relative genetic diversity (N e \u03c4 ) at 50 evenly spaced grid points across six years, ending at the most recent tip in the tree (2015 August) in BEAST v1.8.4 (Drummond et al., 2012) , under a relaxed molecular clock with rates drawn from a lognormal distribution (Drummond et al., 2006) and codon position partitioned (positions 1 + 2 and 3) HKY+\u0393 4 (Hasegawa et al., 1985; Yang, 1994) nucleotide substitution models. At time of writing advanced flexible coalescent tree priors from the skyline family, such as skygrid (Gill et al., 2013) are available in BEAST v1 (Drummond et al., 2012) but not in BEAST v2 (Bouckaert et al., 2014) . We set up five independent MCMC chains to run for 500 million states, sampling every 50 000 states. This analysis suffered from poor convergence, where two chains converged onto one stationary distribution, two to another and the last chain onto a third stationary distribution, with high effective sample sizes. Demographic trajectories recovered by the two main stationary distributions are very similar and differences between the two appear to be caused by convergence onto subtly different tree topologies. This non-convergence effect may have been masked previously by the use of all available MERS-CoV sequences from humans which may have lead MCMC towards one of the multiple stationary distributions.",

From top to bottom each row corresponds to departures from completely random sequencing efforts with respect to case cluster size (bias parameter=1.0) to sequencing increasingly biased towards capturing large case clusters (bias=2.0, bias=3.0). Leftmost scatter plots show the distribution of individual Monte Carlo simulation sequence cluster size statistics (mean and skewness) coloured by the R 0 value used for the simulation. The dotted rectangle identifies the 95% highest posterior density bounds for sequence cluster size mean and skewness observed for empirical MERS-CoV data. The distribution of R 0 values matching empirical data are shown in the middle, on the same y-axis across all levels of the bias parameter. Under unbiased sequencing (bias=1.0) only 0.45% of simulations fit our phylogenetic observations, while 1.79% and 1.67% of simulations fit for bias levels of 2.0 and 3.0, respectively. Correspondingly, we estimate 11.6% support for a model with bias level 1.0, 45.7% support for a model with bias level 2.0, and 42.7% support for a model with bias level 3.0. Bins falling inside the 95% percentiles are coloured by R 0 , as in the leftmost scatter plot. While the 95% percentiles for R 0 values are close to 1.0 (0.71-0.98) for the unbiased sequencing simulation (i.e. uniform sequencing efforts, in which every case is equally likely to be sequenced), we also note that increasing levels of bias are considerably more to likely to generate MERS-CoV-like sequence clusters. The distribution of total number of introductions associated with simulations matching MERS-CoV sequence clusters is shown in the plots on the right, on the same y-axis across all levels of bias. Darker shade of grey indicates bins falling within the 95% percentiles. The median number of cross-species introductions observed in simulations matching empirical data without bias are 346 (95% percentiles 262-439). These numbers jump up to 568 (95% percentiles 430-727) for bias = 2.0 and 656 (95% percentiles 488-853) for bias = 3.0 simulations.

Sequencing simulations take place at three levels of bias: 1.0, where every case is equally likely to be sequenced, and 2.0 and 3.0, where cases from larger clusters are increasingly more likely to be sequenced. The distribution of simulated sequence clusters is summarised by its mean, median and standard deviation.

Boxplots indicate frequency of case (blue, top) and sequence (red, bottom) cluster sizes across simulations at different bias levels, marginalised across R 0 values. Outliers are shown with transparency, medians are indicated with thick black lines. Case clusters exhibit a strong skew with large numbers of singleton introductions and a substantial tail at higher levels of bias. Figure S9 . Quantile-quantile (Q-Q) plot of empirical and simulated sequence cluster sizes. Density of sequence cluster size percentiles (1st-99th, calculated across a grid of 50 values) calculated for random states from the posterior distribution (x-axis) and matching simulations (y-axis). Most values fall on the one-to-one line, with a heavier tail in mid-sized sequence clusters in empirical data, manifesting as a greater density of points below the one-to-one line in the middle.",

Maximum clade credibility tree of MERS-CoV genomes annotated with results of two recombination detection tests (PHI and 3Seq) applied to descendent sequences of each clade. Both tests identify large portions of existing sequence data as containing signals of recombination. Note that markings do not indicate where recombinations have occurred on the tree, merely the minimum distance in sequence/time space between recombining lineages. Figure S11 . MERS-CoV genomes exhibit high numbers of non-clonal loci. Ancestral state reconstruction (right) identifies a large number of sites in which mutations have occurred more than once in the tree (homoplasies, orange) or are reversions (red) from a state arising in an ancestor. Mutations that apparently only occur once in the tree (synapomorphies) are shown in grey. The maximum likelihood phylogeny on the left is coloured by whether sequences were sampled in humans (blue) or camels (orange). Figure S12 . Human clade sharing between genomic fragments 1 and 2. Central scatter plot shows the posterior probability of human clades shared between genomic fragments 1 and 2, in their respective trees. Left and bottom scatter plots track the posterior probability of human clades only observed in fragment 2 (left) or fragment 1 (bottom). The cumulative probability of human clades present in either tree are tracked by plots on the right (fragment 2) and top (fragment 1). Most of the probability mass is concentrated within human clades that are present in trees of both genomic fragment 1 and 2 (0.9701 and 0.9474 of all human clades across posteriors, respectively).",

Given these findings, and the fact that large outbreaks of MERS occurred in hospitals, the combination of frequent spillover of MERS-CoV into humans and occasional outbreak amplification via poor hygiene practices(Assiri et al., 2013b; Chen et al., 2017)  appear sufficient to explain observed epidemiological patterns of MERS-CoV.",
