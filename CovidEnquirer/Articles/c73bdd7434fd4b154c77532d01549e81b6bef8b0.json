In each patch, media coverage about the cases present in the local population leads individuals to limit the number of contacts they have with others, inducing a reduction in the rate of transmission of the infection. A global qualitative analysis is carried out, showing that the typical threshold behavior holds, with solutions either tending to an equilibrium without disease, or the system being persistent and solutions converging to an endemic equilibrium. Numerical analysis is employed to gain insight in both the analytically tractable and intractable cases; these simulations indicate that media coverage can reduce the burden of the epidemic and shorten the duration of the disease outbreak.",

It was not, as far as the magnitude of the event, a major epidemic: 8096 and 774 people are known to have been infected and killed by SARS, respectively. However, the amount of media coverage garnered by this event was colossal. For example, in Britain, a study found that 3 tabloids and 2 broadsheets ran a total of 1153 news stories mentioning SARS from March to July 2003 [27] ; the New Zealand Herald ran 261 articles from March 13 to June 11, 2003 [28] . In fact, media coverage of health related events has become so important that several surveillance systems now rely on active trolling of Internet news media and blogs to detect emerging disease threats [8, 19] .",

Media coverage of an infectious outbreak can be seen as following two major routes. The first route is when the media report directly to the public on facts that they (the media) observe; the second has public health authorities using mass media or the Internet to communicate about the outbreak [1] . Because information is widely available and that it is difficult for public health authorities to ar-range a permanent flow of information, it is frequent that during a crisis, the media try to create 'value' from very sparse information, thus following the first route rather than the second. This can be detrimental. For example, a study conducted after the SARS outbreak shows that students from Ontario, Canada were aware that the risk of becoming infected by the SARS coronavirus was low, but they also predominantly had misconceptions about the virus [5] . It is therefore important for public health authorities to communicate accurate and timely information to the public about infectious disease outbreaks. Communication is also extremely important in determining vaccine uptake [13, 21, 22] .",

In the Reducing the spread of disease category, many actions to be taken at the national level require the use of media. More significantly, the Communications category discusses actions to circulate information between national public health authorities but also with the public. The WHO must 'Update national authorities, other partners and stakeholders, and the public on global situation, trends, epidemiological characteristics, and recommended measures', while member nations must 'Regularly update the public on what is known and unknown about the pandemic disease, including transmission patterns, clinical severity, treatment, and prophylaxis options', 'Provide regular communications to address societal concerns, such as the disruption to travel, border closures, schools, or the economy or society in general' and 'Regularly update the public on sources of emergency medical care, resources for dealing with urgent non-pandemic health care needs, and resources for self-care of medical conditions'.",

They concluded that media coverage was critical in disease eradication. All the mathematical models referenced above assume that space is homogeneous and investigations are confined to a population. However, infectious diseases spread geographically over time. [16] . Therefore, incorporating spatial heterogeneity in epidemic models is important (see, e.g. [2] [3] [4] and the references therein). The question we ask here is the following: does the addition of space perturb the results previously obtained? In the case of classical epidemic models, it is generally true that the addition of space by means of linearly interconnected patches does not lead to a change of behavior. However, restricting contacts when the incidence rises introduces effects that could lead to differences with the classical cases. We show here that such is not the case and that, at least in the model considered, which is a modification of [11] , the addition of space is inconsequential as far as the dynamics is concerned.",

Demographic and disease parameters are chosen to illustrate the situation that would prevail if the two patches had very different health systems: patch 1 is a wealthy nation or city, with higher mean life expectancy and better care for infectious individuals than patch 2. Here, we assume a non-fatal disease and therefore that 'better care' implies a shorter recovery time. In the case of diseases that cause mortality, it could be necessary to nuance this hypothesis for individuals with severe infections; for instance, influenza patients put under respirators can spend a long time before recovering, whereas patients in poorer settings with no access to respirators who would be subject to an influenza infection of similar severity, generally die.

            "text": "The first limitation of the system is that it uses a very simple SIS model, whereas a lot of the diseases that would be relevant are expected to follow an SEIRS-type progression. However, this distinction is not as important here as it would be should we have considered problems related to the control of the spread of the infection. In the latter case, the presence of a class of incubating individuals makes controlling the infection hard (since E individuals might travel undetected). In the case of media-induced social distancing, the presence of an E class simply delays the 'birth' of new infectives, so we expect similar results to the ones obtained here. The system should be studied with an arbitrary number of patches. It can be expected, though, that the global results we were able to establish here, in particular about the endemic equilibrium, will be hard to carry through to higher dimensionality. Also, while media coverage can help curtail an epidemic, it can also have negative consequences. The WHO guidance document [23] states, among the Communications actions to be taken in the event of a pandemic, that the WHO should 'Continue to work with partners to promote consistent messages'. We have assumed in our model that communication is always beneficial in mitigating the spread of disease. However it is possible that some forms of messaging could be counterproductive from a public health standpoint (e.g. messages inciting fears over vaccine safety). Therefore, more elaborate forms of the 'media coverage effect function' should be considered. This would be a very interesting problem on many different levels: the interaction of patches with different media coverage effect functions, some decreasing, some increasing, would most likely pose difficult and interesting mathematical problems. There are additional temporal effects in social distancing that are important but not taken into consideration here. For example, [7] found that social distancing was generally well accepted, but only insofar as it did not have major economic consequences for the individuals involved. During the 2009 pandemic influenza outbreak, [14] found that after initially experiencing high anxiety about getting infected by the virus, individuals were becoming less and less concerned. There is, therefore, a waning of the effect at the individual level that could be taken into account. Finally, knowledge of the presence of a disease could also lead to modification of the rate of travel between locations. During the 2009 H1N1 pandemic, it was for instance observed [15] that air traffic to Mexico was affected in the early stages of the epidemic, although the effect on the overall global air transportation network was less evident. Work is in progress to incorporate such effects to our model. Table 1 such that R > 1. Table 1 such that R > 1. ",
