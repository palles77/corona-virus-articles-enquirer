A large number of medical staff were dispersed for Wuhan city and Hubei province to aid COVID-19 control. Psychological stress, especially vicarious traumatization (VT) caused by the COVID-19 pandemic, should not be ignored. To address this concern, the study employed a total of 214 general public (GP) and 526 nurses to evaluate VT scores via a mobile app-based questionnaire. Results showed that the VT scores slightly increased across periods of aiding COVID-19 control, although no statistical difference was noted (P = 0.083).",

In addition, the VT scores for front-line nurses (FLNs; median = 64; IQR = 52-75), including scores for physiological and psychological responses, were significantly lower than those of non-front-line nurses (nFLNs; median = 75.5; IQR = 63-92) (P < 0.001). Interestingly, the VT scores of the GP were significantly higher than those of the FLNs (P < 0.001). However, no statistical difference was observed compared with those of nFLNs (P > 0.05). Importantly, nFLNs are more likely to suffer from VT, which might be related to two factors, namely, gender [odds ratio (OR) = 3.1717; 95% confidence interval (CI) = 4.247-18.808; P = 0.002] and fertility [OR = 2.072; 95%CI = 0.626-24.533; P = 0.039].

China has taken active and effective actions to provide medical support for aiding in the control of the rapid spread of COVID-19. From January 24, 2020 (Chinese New Year's Eve), China has sent more than 30,000 medical staff to Wuhan city and Hubei province to provide medical support. Researchers have validated that these efficient and feasible strategies and measures are timely and effective. Medical staffs often have a variety of psychological problems under a high-pressure and risk anti-pandemic situation. 1 Therefore, psychological assessment and intervention in victims and rescuers, such as medical staff and volunteers, are of great importance for the control of large-scale disasters and pandemics. This notion is not only beneficial for early actions and measures for psychological intervention, but also for tremendously improving disaster and pandemic control and rapid social recovery. 2 In 1996, Saakvitne and Pearlman first proposed vicarious traumatization (VT). 3 The term initially referred to the phenomenon where professional psychotherapists are involuntarily affected by the bidirectional interactions of the relationship between consultation and interview due to long-term contact with patients with mental diseases.",

Frequently, these symptoms are accompanied by trauma responses and interpersonal conflicts that even compel others to commit suicide. 7 In this regard, the study proposes that medical staff, volunteers, and the GP will more or less experience VT during the spread and control of the COVID-19 pandemic.

Close contact with patients with COVID-19 and direct exposure to the patients' physical and psychological sufferings have been well recognized to render FLNs prone to suffer from VT; therefore, the society and psychotherapists should actively pay more attention to the psychological problems of FLNs. 18,19 However, the results of the study imply that the VT severity of nFLNs, regardless of physical or psychological responses, is more serious than that of FLNs. This finding suggests that nFLNs are more likely to suffer from psychological problems, whereas the psychological endurance of FLNs is stronger. This notion may be due to the fact that FLNs are voluntarily selected and provided with sufficient psychological preparation. Second, the selected FLNs are mainly middle-level backbone staff with working experience and psychological capacity. In addition, the VT of FLNs is typically derived from .
