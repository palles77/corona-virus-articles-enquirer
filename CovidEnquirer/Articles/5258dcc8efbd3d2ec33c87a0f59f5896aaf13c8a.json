Methods: Patients were recruited from two acute hospital sites in Leicester (UK) over 3 successive winters. Samples were taken for viral and bacterial testing. Results: Of the 780 patients hospitalised with acute respiratory illness 345 (44%) had a respiratory virus detected. Picornaviruses were the most commonly isolated viruses (detected in 23% of all patients). Virus detection rates exceeded 50% in patients with exacerbation of asthma (58%), acute bronchitis and Influenza-like-illness (64%), and ranged from 30 to 50% in patients with an exacerbation of COPD (38%), community acquired pneumonia (36%) and congestive cardiac failure (31%). Bacterial detection was relatively frequent in patients with exacerbation of COPD and pneumonia (25% and 33% respectively) but was uncommon in all other groups. Antibiotic use was high across all clinical groups (76% overall) and only 21% of all antibiotic use occurred in patients with detectable bacteria.",

            "text": "Adults hospitalised with acute respiratory illness rarely have detectable bacteria in the absence of COPD or pneumonia; viral infection predominates in a large prospective UK sample Introduction Acute respiratory illness is responsible for a large proportion of acute hospital admissions in adults. 1 It is accepted that respiratory viruses are responsible for the majority of acute respiratory illness in infants and children, including those admitted to secondary care. 2, 3 Whilst respiratory viral infection has been increasingly recognised in the aetiology of acute respiratory illness in adults, its overall importance compared to bacteria is unclear. Respiratory viruses are detected in the majority of exacerbation of asthma in adults (41e78%) and in a smaller proportion of patients with exacerbation of COPD (22e44%) and community acquired pneumonia (15e54%). 4e10 Picornaviruses (rhinoviruses and enteroviruses) are the most frequent cause of the common cold and are also consistently the most commonly detected viruses in adults with exacerbations of asthma, 4 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD) 5, 7 and in most studies of aetiology in community acquired pneumonia. 8, 9 In addition, recent evidence suggests that respiratory viruses are associated with a significant proportion of acute respiratory disease amongst hospitalised adults and the elderly. 8e13 Antibiotic use is common in hospitals. A recent US study demonstrated that over 50% of hospital inpatients received antibiotics at some stage during their stay, with acute respiratory illness being the commonest reason for antibiotic use. 14 In addition to the frequent isolation of viruses, there is also a lack of evidence of clinical benefit from antibiotic use in many acute respiratory conditions presenting to secondary care including; acute bronchitis, 15 exacerbations of asthma 16 and mild-moderate cases of exacerbation of chronic obstructive airways disease. 17, 18 Widespread use of antibiotics in hospitals and the community has led to the emergence and proliferation of antibiotic resistant bacteria 19, 20 and to increasing rates of health care associated infections (HCAIs) such as Clostridium difficile. Effective antibiotic stewardship and reduction in excess antibiotic use in hospitals has been shown to be effective in reducing antimicrobial resistance and HCAIs and has therefore become a global priority. 21 In this study we sought to define the microbial aetiology in hospitalised adults with a variety of common acute respiratory syndromes and to describe their clinical characteristics and antimicrobial use.",

Whilst PCT levels in patients with acute respiratory illness tend to be higher in patients with bacteria detected compared to those with viruses detected, 25 viral infection has been frequently associated with PCT levels of >0.25 ng/ml independently of bacteria. 26 Strategies to reduce excess antibiotic use are urgently needed but must be balanced against the risks of undertreating genuine and severe bacterial infection. In patients with pneumonia where complications and mortality rates are high 27 and evidence exists for the benefit of timely antibiotic treatment 28 such a high rate of antibiotic use seems justifiable and appropriate. Although viruses are frequently detected in patients with pneumonia, co-detection with bacteria is also common 6e9 and secondary bacterial pneumonia following respiratory viral infection is known to occur. 29, 30 Primary viral pneumonia occurs in nonimmunocompromised adults with influenza virus infection and may also occur with other respiratory viruses. 30 However, definitely excluding a concurrent bacterial infection in these patients who are often severely unwell is difficult to achieve in practice and so strategies to reduce antibiotic use in hospitalised patients with pneumonia are unlikely to be appropriate or successful.",

Although bacteria are frequently detected from patients with exacerbation of COPD their exact role and importance compared to viruses is the subject of ongoing debate. Antibiotics are currently recommended in COPD exacerbation according to clinical criteria 18 however the evidence for clinical benefit in mild to moderate exacerbations is limited 17, 18 and must be balanced against the risks of adverse events. Studies using the serum biomarker Procalcitonin(PCT) have demonstrated that antibiotics can be safely withheld in patients with exacerbation of COPD and low levels of PCT.

Influenza is the only respiratory virus for which specific antiviral agents exist, however no patients in our study were prescribed neuraminidase inhibitors (NIs) either before or during their hospital admission. In contrast to the US CDC guidelines, UK NICE guidance advocates the use of NIs only when started within 48 h of symptom onset 39 irrespective of hospitalisation status or severity. Using even these restrictive criteria, nineteen of the 82 (23%) patients with laboratory confirmed influenza in our study presented within 48 h of the onset of symptoms and should therefore have been considered for treatment. In addition evidence from recent large observational studies suggests that NIs may reduce mortality from pandemic H1N1 influenza among hospitalised adults even when started after 48 h of symptom duration. 40 There are several limitations to our study. Our results are only applicable to hospitalised adults and cannot be extrapolated to children or to patients presenting to primary care. The seasonal nature of our recruitment means that the results are only applicable to patients admitted outside of the summer months and may overestimate the overall annual incidence of respiratory viral detection in these patient groups. In addition, because the exact dates of patient recruitment were different year by year there is a potential for underestimating the prevalence of respiratory viruses with seasonal periodicity such as RSV and influenza. This may explain our relatively low rate of RSV detection compared to some other studies. Our definition of bacterial detection includes the isolation of potentially pathogenic bacteria in sputum which may overestimate the true numbers of bacterial infections as the presence of bacteria in sputum may represent colonisation rather than infection. As we did not test for M. pneumoniae or C. pneumoniae in our study we may have underestimated the overall proportion of bacterial detection. However the role of these organisms in clinical groups other than pneumonia and bronchitis is not established and similar studies in hospitalised adults have shown low rates of detection even when using molecular methods. 13 In our cohort a large number of patients were unable to provide adequate sputum samples for analysis and culture which could have underestimated the overall rate of bacterial detection. However in our subgroup analysis of patients with complete sampling the overall rate of bacterial detection was higher in patients with COPD and pneumonia but for other groups was not significantly different. Finally, around a quarter of our patients were already taking antibiotics at the time of hospitalisation which could have led to a reduction in the detection of bacteria and so an underestimation of bacterial detection rate. However it is notable that the detection rates of bacteria in our study are consistent with other similar studies including those where patients already on antibiotics were excluded. 13 In summary this study demonstrates the predominance of respiratory viruses in adults hospitalised with acute respiratory illness and shows that excess antibiotic use occurs in clinical groups where viral detection is common, bacterial detection is rare and there is a lack of evidence for clinical benefit from antibiotics. Efforts at reducing excess antibiotic use in hospitals should focus in these groups as a priority.",
