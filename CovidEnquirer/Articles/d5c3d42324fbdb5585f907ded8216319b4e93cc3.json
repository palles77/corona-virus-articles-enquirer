Coronavirus infections are highly species specific with virus exhibiting a strong tissue and cell specificity. In this report we evaluated the cellular basis of JHM virus retinal tropism. Retinal cultures and retinal pigment epithelial (RPE)~retinal mixed cell cultures were prepared from eyes obtained from Balb/c mice. The ability of JHM virus to infect and replicate in these retinal cultures was evaluated by light microscopy, immunofluorescent staining, electron microscopy, and virus isolation. Cytopathology was not observed and virus could not be detected in supernatant fluid in retinal cultures. However, low levels of infectious virus could be detected within the cells for the first 4 days. This observation suggested that cell \"to-cell interactions may be critical since virus particles and virus antigens can be seen in vivowithin the neural retina and the RPE. In contrast to the retinal cultures, retinal-RPE mixed cultures were supportive to JHM virus replication. Syncytial cytopathology was observed for the first 4 days and virus was isolated from supernatant fluids. By electron microscopy, virus was found intracellularly within vacuoles and extracellularly at the plasma rnembrane. After Day 4, a persistent virus infection was established in which cells produced virus for 5 weeks without cytopathic effects or cell death. Double-labetinq immunofluorescent studies of retinal-RvE mixed cultures showed that the virus antigen was co \"expressed with a Muller cell marker, glutamine synthetase. This cell is the most prominent glial element in the retina. These studies demonstrate that JHM virus is capable of establishing a persistent virus infection in mixed retinal (Muller)-RPE cell cultures. Moreover, these data suggest that cell-to-cell interactions influence the establishment of coronavirus infections in the retina. ii:l1993 Academic Press, Inc.",

The disease consists of an acute phase lasting 2 to 8 days in which virus is detected within the retina and initial pathology is noted in retinal pigment epithelial (RPE) and photoreceptor layers. This is followed by a late phase lasting from 1 to 14 weeks where virus is not detected but retinal degenerative changes continue with reduction of photoreceptor layer, loss of interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (IRBP), and retinal detachments. This model provides evidence that viruses can indeed trigger retinal degenerative processes and may provide insight into pathogenic mechanisms in retinal degenerative diseases of man.",

Central nervous system involvement following JHM virus infections can consist of acute infections or chronic demyelinating disease. The acute infection is associated with viral replication in selected cells while chronic disease is associated with both virus replication and immune reactivity (Kyuwa and Stohlman, 1990) . Many of the steps involved in pathogenic processes in these infections have been elucidated by in vitro studies (Lucas et al., 1977; Massa et et.. 1986; Pasick and Dales, 1991) . Some of the studies have shown that virus pathogenesis has been associated with infection of specific cell types, such as glial cells, neurons, and oligodendrocytes. However, viral pathogenesis has also been associated with cell-to-cell interactions, release of cytokines, and state of differentiation of the cells (Pasick and Dales, 1991) .",

In this study we found that JHM virus does not induce a highly productive infection in retinal cell cultures. However, mixed retinal-RPE cell cultures were capable of propagating virus associated with transient cytopathology.

Electron microscopic evaluation of these persistently infected cultures revealed some differences when compared to the acutely infected retinal-RPE mixed cultures (48 hr pi) or to the L2-infected cultures (24 hr pi). In the acute infection, virus was readily seen within numerous cytoplasmic vacuoles. In contrast, in the persistent infection virus-filled vacuoles were infrequently observed.

The cells transverse the layers of the retina in a radial direction. Not only do these cells provide structural support to the retina but also they also contribute nutritive. ionic, and metabolic functi ons. The data presented here indicate that JHM virus can infect and replicate in Muller cells. The ability of the coro navirus to replicate in this cell may provide insight into some of the pathogenic processes occurring in the infected retina. In fact , we have recently shown that there is a redistribution and reduction of interphotorecept or retinoid-binding protein (IRBP) during ocular coro navirus infection (Hooks et el., 1991; Robbins et et., 1992) . This molecule serves the important function 01 transporting retinoids between the photoreceptor cells and the RPE cells. In the infected eye, IRBP actually leaks through the retina leaving a track which mimics the transversing distributio n of a Muller cell. We spec ulate that this effect could result from virus-induced disruption of the adhering junctions betw een photoreceptors and Muller cells. This alteration in Muller-ph otoreceptor cell jun ction s could result in abnormalities in a variety of interphotorecep tor matrix components that could lead to secondary pathologic effects . For example, diminished concentration and displacement of IRBP protein may disrupt retinal transport. The resultant retinoid excess in the photoreceptor can be toxic to this cell.",

However, the virus does replicate in mixed retinal-RPE cultures. This virus replication may also reflect a need for cell-to-cell interactions and/or a requirement for more differentiated cell types. Recent studies by Pasick and Dales (1991) indicate that two cell types, neurons and early oligodendrocyte type 2 astrocyte lineage cells, and specific stages of differentiation may be necessary for productive JHM virus replication. They discovered that the presence of soluble mediators which synergistically block 0-2A cells from differentiating into oligodendrocytes was correlated with specific and reversible resistance to JHM virus infections. They suggest that permissiveness of the cells for JHM virus is restricted to discrete developmental stages. Similar conditions may exist in our culture system. The virus may replicate in RPE cells and then be able to infect Muller cells in the retinal-RPE mixed cultures. Alternatively, the RPE cells, by cell-to-cell contact or by the production of soluble factors, may drive the retinal cells to a more differentiated state which is more susceptible to virus replication. In fact, we have shown that a cytokine, interferon-v can help to drive retinoblastoma cells to a more differentiated state Detrick et al., 1992) Finally, cell-to-cell interactions in our system may result in proteolytic activation of viral glycoproteins (Holmes, 1990) . In order for bovine coronavirus (BCV) to infect bovine brain or thyroid cells, the E2 glycoprotein must be enzymatically cleaved (Storz and Kaluza, 1981) . /n vivo, BCV replicates in the intestine, where enzymes are readily available. RPE cells phagocytosis could possibly result in cleavage of an inactive viral glycoprotein to a biologically active form. In this way, the RPE cell may be arming the virus for retinal infections.",

Following an initial 2-to 4-day period of viral replication associated with cytopathology, the virus continues to replicate in the absence of syncytial formation. This persistent infection in retinal-RPE cultures is strikingly similar to a report describing JHM virus persistence in a rat glial cell line (Lucas et al., 1977) . The virus-induced syncytia was present early in the infection of glial cells and disappeared within 7 days. After this time, virus was continually shed into the medium. Moreover, it was noted that replication within the rat glial cells in vitro mimics in vivo pathogenesis, i.e., JHM virus replicates in and kills oligodendroglia I cells inducing demyelination. In contrast, the MHV-3 strain of the same virus fails to replicate in the rat glial cells in vitro and in vivo.",

Nevertheless, the ability of JHM virus to induce an in vitro persistent infection in retinal cultures suggests that a similar mechanism may be operative in vivo. We are presently evaluating different conditions and various M HV strains for the production of a persistent infection in vivo. JHM virus is capable of inducing a retinopathy in the mouse and the studies reported here clearly show that this virus is capable of replicating in Muller cells in vitro. However, one must be careful extrapolating these in vitro studies to the situation in vivo.

Anti-virus antibody staining patterns in the retina mimic the distribu tion of retinal Muller cells. Up to 40% of retinal cultures (30 days in culture) expressed tile Muller cell marker, glutam Ine synthetase . Surprisingly, JHM virus did not replicate in these cultures, Since the sequence of events in vivo co nsists of initial RPE cell staining for viral antigen at Day 3 followed by retinal Muller-like staining for viral antigen at Days 4-6, we decided to see if mixed cultures would be permissive to JHM virus replication. These rnixed cultures were permissive for JHM replication. Double immunofluorescent studies showed that cells positive for Muller cell staining expressed viral antigen.",
