TaqMan\u00b1PCR was optimized to quantify BVD virus using the ABI PRISM 7700 sequence detection system and dual-labeled\u00afuorogenic probes. Two different gene speci\u00aec labeled\u00afuorogenic probes for the 5 H untranslated region (5 H UTR) were used to differentiate between BVD types I and II. Sensitivity of the single tube TaqMan assay was compared with two-tube TaqMan assay and standard RT\u00b1PCR using 10-fold dilutions of RNA. Single tube TaqMan assay was 10\u00b1100-fold more sensitive than the two-tube TaqMan assay and the standardized single tube RT\u00b1PCR. Speci\u00aecity of the assay was evaluated by testing different BVD virus strains and other bovine viruses. A total of 106 BVD positive and negative pooled or single serum samples, \u00aeeld isolates and reference strains were tested. Quantitation of cRNA from types I and II BVD virus was accomplished by a standard curve plotting cycle threshold values (C T ) versus copy number. Single tube TaqMan\u00b1PCR assay was sensitive, speci\u00aec and rapid for detection, quantitation and classi\u00aecation of BVD virus. #",

The virus is a member of the Pestivirus genus in the family Flaviviridae (Wengler et al., 1995) . BVDV isolates were segregated into two genotypes based on comparison of sequences from the 5 H untranslated region (5 H UTR) of the viral genome (Ridpath et al., 1994; Ridpath and Bolin, 1998) . Infection with BVD Veterinary Microbiology 83 (2001) 1\u00b110 virus causes gastrointestinal disease, reproductive failure, respiratory disorders, fetal malformation and persistent infections (PI). The PI animals act as reservoirs of virus and shed the virus for life exposing other animals in the herd. In addition to a good vaccination program, identi\u00aecation and removal of PI animals from the herd is an essential component of control measures for eradication of BVD virus (Fulton and Burge, 2000; Cortese and Victor, 1999) .",

The system uses oligonucleotide probes labeled with\u00afuorescent dyes, a reporter at the 5 H end and a quencher at the 3 H end (Livak et al., 1995) . The quencher suppresses the reporter dye emission when both are attached to the probe. During each PCR cycle, the Taq DNA polymerase cleaves the reporter dye from the annealed probe by its 5 H \u00b13 H nucleolytic activity (Gibson et al., 1996) . The free reporter dye emits its characteristic signal that can be detected by the ABI Prism 7700 sequence detection system. The increase in\u00afuorescence emission is proportional to the accumulated PCR products. In this study a TaqMan\u00b1 PCR assay was developed for detection, classi\u00aecation and quantitation of BVD virus in single tube.

The ampli\u00aecation plots were generated with DR n mean value on the y-axis and cycle number on the x-axis (Gibson et al., 1996) . The threshold cycle (C T ) is the cycle number at which the reporter\u00afuorescence generated by cleavage of the probe passed a \u00aexed threshold above baseline. Standard deviation 10 above base line was used to determine the \u00aexed threshold. For analysis of C T values, less than 15 cycles threshold need to be adjusted manually.",

These features make it an excellent large-scale screening tool for individual or pooled serum samples. Rapid turnaround time, reproducibility and ease of use make this technique a valuable diagnostic tool for detection of BVD virus.",
