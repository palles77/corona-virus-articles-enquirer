Feces or nasal swab fluids were incubated sequentially with hyperimmune bovine anti-bovine coronavirus serum and protein A-gold, negatively stained, applied to formvar-coated copper grids and viewed using an electron microscope. The PAG-IEM method specifically identified BCV particles and possible subviral particles in feces and nasal-swab fluids from infected calves. The PAG-IEM method did not label other enveloped enteric viruses or morphologically similar fringed particles commonly found in feces. Detection of BCV using PAG-IEM was compared with ELISA and direct immunofluorescence (IF) of nasal epithelial cells by monitoring fecal and respiratory tract shedding of BCV from two experimentally infected and two naturally infected calves from birth to 3 weeks of age. PAG-IEM and ELISA detected shedding of BCV in fecal (4/4 animals) and nasal (3/4 animals) samples for an average of 5.25 days each. The observed agreement of BCV detection by PAG-IEM and ELISA was 85%. PAG-IEM may be a more sensitive immunoassay for the detection of BCV in diagnostic specimens from infected neonatal calves than ELISA. BCV infection of nasal epithelial cells was detected by immunofluorescence in 4/4 calves, persisted for the duration of the study in 2/4 calves and was sporadic in the other two animals.",

Diarrheic material often contains particles which resemble BCV in morphology, making the positive identification of the virus difficult. In one study, a number of laboratories were sent known human coronavirus specimens for examination by negative-staining EM. Only 51% made a correct diagnosis; 33% found no virus and 16% reported a wrong virus in the specimen (Almeida, 1983 ) . The majority of these so-called coronaviruses are membrane fragments with a fringed surface. Unfortunately, endoplasmic reticulum, bacteria and mycoplasma, when broken down, yield fragments that assume spherical form and frequently display a fringe of surface projections. Similarly, the disrupted cristae of broken mitochondria have distinctive surface projections and can also appear in the viral size range (Almeida, 1983) .",

Briefly, samples were diluted 1:5, sonicated, clarified at 4 \u00b0C and the supernatants passed through 0.45 pm filters (Uniflo, Schleicher and Schuell, Keene, NH). Nasal swab supernatants were filtered (0.45 pm), concentrated 10-fold by ultracentrifugation (99 000 \u00d7g, 2 h, 4\u00b0C) and resuspended in 200 pl PBS. Fecal or nasal samples (200 #1) were incubated overnight at 4\u00b0C with appropriately diluted hyperimmune bovine anti-bovine coronavirus serum (800 pl) as described by Saif et al. (1986) . The immune complexes were pelleted twice (69 000 \u00d7 g, 35 min, 4 \u00b0 C ), resuspended in 50 Bl sterile distilled H20 (EM water ) and incubated for 45 min at 37\u00b0C with 25/ll of 10 nm protein A-gold (PAG) (AuroProbe, EM protein-A G10, Janssen Life Sciences, Piscataway, NJ) diluted 1:20 in gold buffer (0.1% BSA in Tris-buffered saline, pH 8.2). In select specimens, the PAG binding was blocked by the addition of 25/A (5 mg ml-1 ) of unlabeled protein A in gold buffer, as a control. Further incubations were carried out in microtiter plate wells as described by Hopley and Doane (1985) . The virus-antibody-PAG suspension (50/ll ) was transferred to a formvar carbon-coated copper EM grid (300 mesh) on top of 1% agar in a microtiter well and allowed to diffuse into the agar for 30 min at room temperature. Grids were washed by sequential immersion into two drops of gold buffer and one drop of EM water followed by negative staining with 1.5% phosphotungstic acid containing 0.2% sucrose (pH 7.2) for 30 s. Grids were blotted dry and examined at 80 kV in an electron microscope (Model 201, Philips Norelco, The Netherlands). The viral particles in a specimen were estimated on the basis of the following scale measured in number per grid square: < 1; >~ 1 ~< 10; >t 11 ~< 50; >~51~<100; >~101.",

Plates were rinsed twice in PBS-Tween (Dynawasher II, Dynatech Laboratories, Alexandria, VA) and 100/A of feces [diluted 1:25 and processed as described previously {Saif et al., 1983) ] or undiluted nasal swab supernatants were added, each to four wells of positive capture serum and duplicate wells of negative control serum. Each set of duplicate samples (on positive capture antibody) received a further 100 #l of a 1:100 dilution of hyperimmune or preimmune ammonium sulfate precipitated bovine anti-bovine coronavirus serum, as a blocking test, followed by incubation overnight at 4 \u00b0 C. Plates were rinsed and 100/ll hyperimmune guinea pig anti-bovine coronavirus serum (1: 3000) in 2% BSA-PBS-Tween was added and incubated for 1 h at 37\u00b0C.

Plates were rinsed twice, first with PBS-Tween, then with distilled H20, and 200/zl of the substrate, p-nitrophenyl phosphate disodium, (Sigma Chemical Company, St. Louis, MO ) in 10% diethanolamine was added. Color development was read at 405 nm (Titerteck Multiskan, Flow Laboratories, McLean, VA) when positive control wells reached an absorbence value of approximately 1.0. Fecal and nasal swab supernatants, previously determined as positive or negative for BCV by IEM, were included on all plates as controls. A cutoff absorbence value for each sample was determined by adding three standard deviations (of all the negative control samples and all samples on negative control serum) to the background absorbence value of the sample on negative control serum. Mean values were determined for each set of duplicate samples tested. A sample was considered positive if it was above the cut-off value for that sample and if its absorbence value was reduced (in the blocking test) by > 50% of the difference between the unblocked absorbence value and the cut-off absorbence value.",

            "text": "In the present study, protein A-gold immunoelectron microscopy was successfully used to detect bovine coronavirus in the feces and nasal secretions of infected calves. This technique did not specifically label an antigenically unrelated porcine coronavirus (TGE), a morphologically similar, but antigenically unrelated enveloped bovine enteric virus (Bredavirus) or morphologically similar fringed particles commonly found in feces. PAG-IEM clearly labeled only intact BCV or free BCV antigens of undefined morphology in calves infected with BCV but not coronavirus-like particles found in negative control or pre-challenge fecal samples. This ability of PAG-IEM to detect small subviral antigens has also been shown by others (Stannard et al., 1982; Louro and Lesemann, 1984; Hopley and Doane, 1985) . This is a distinct advantage over IEM since coronaviruses are fragile and peplomers easily break off making the identification of the virus difficult. The PAG-IEM method for detecting BCV in feces or nasal secretions compared well to ELISA with a Kappa value of 0.7. This study did not compare the sensitivities of the two assays, although others have shown that PAG-IEM is 1000 times more sensitive than direct electron microscopy and consistently more sensitive than standard IEM methods (Doane et al., 1987) . The increased sensitivity of the PAG-IEM method is probably related to the ability of PAG particles to bridge small antigen-antibody complexes (Hopley and Doane, 1985) . In the light of the re-ports that IEM is at least as efficient as ELISA, PAG-IEM appears to be one of the most sensitive of the immunoassays currently available (Nicolaieff et al., 1980; Obert et al., 1981; Kjeldsberg and Mortensson-Egnund, 1982; Rubenstein and Miller, 1982; Svensson et al., 1983; Hughes et al., 1984; Hopley and Doane, 1985 ) .",

All animals developed a fever and profuse watery diarrhea, but only mild or no symptoms of upper respiratory tract infection. However, the virus did replicate in the upper respiratory tract as indicated by IF positive nasal cells and virus detection from nasal swab supernatants by PAG-IEM and ELISA. It was not clear from this study whether the respiratory tract infection preceded the enteric infection or vice versa. There appeared to be a persistence of viral infection in the upper respiratory tract, as IF positive nasal epithelial cells were detected (at a very low percentage) in three of the animals for at least 2 weeks after viral shedding was first detected. This was a considerably longer period of shedding than reported by Reynolds et al. (1985) , from challenged gnotobiotic calves, but similar to that reported by Sail et al. (1986) .",
