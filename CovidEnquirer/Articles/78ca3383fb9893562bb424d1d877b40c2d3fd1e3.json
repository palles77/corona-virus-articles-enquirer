Over time, the virus and the host coevolve and adapt to each other and the 'most convenient' strategy is to coexist in the long term. Historically this view was backed up by a classical in-nature experiment made on rabbit myxoma virus. When introduced in 1950 into Australia to limit European rabbit population, highly-virulent myxoma virus killed >99% of infected hosts.

            "text": "a. A major group of factors are biochemical and physiological limitations of virus replication within its host. Although understanding of these factors is far from being complete, it is clear that some viruses persist for life while the others are incapable of establishing longterm persistence. In addition some viruses kill rapidly, while the others can hardly cause an apparent disease. These observations imply that different areas on the trade-off chart (Figure 1b-f ) are differently accessible to various virus species (at least within the visible evolutionary timeframes), affecting their final choice of the replication strategy. b. Another group of factors are parameters of host's population, such as its density. It is very important that the 'tempo' of pathogen expansion into a host population depends on the average number of susceptible hosts that come in contact with an infected host (denoted S in the equation above). A virus strategy that involves fast and severe pathogenesis should be more efficient in very dense populations where the hosts are contacting each other more frequently. Highly pathogenic viruses should also benefit from the high rate of host's reproduction, as this masks the declines in host's numbers caused by infection-related death. However, such viruses indirectly limit their own progression by decimating the host population (i.e., by decreasing S), making lethal diseases a poor long-term strategy. In contrast to this common-sense notion, some pathogens, such as smallpox virus or foot-and-mouth disease virus, in real life cause harsh symptoms in their native hosts. The trade-off models help to understand the evolutionary basis of these observations. c. In some cases, more complex trade-offs are taking place. Sometimes, severe pathogenesis itself helps virus to disseminate. One example is the behavioral change occurring in carnivorous mammals upon rabies virus infection [9] . Rabies virus shortens host's lifespan by increasing the transmission efficiency of excreted particles, since the aversion to swallowing liquids leads to spread of infectious saliva. Also, the changed behavior of active search and biting increases the number of contacts with susceptible hosts. Another well-known example is prion disease Kuru, which was infecting the Fore people in Papua New Guinea. Since its transmission was coupled with funerary cannibalism, the premature death of the host augmented pathogen spread [10] . The multi-biolevel approach, including intra-cell, inter-cell, host, and population levels, is required to integrate all these diverse groups of factors within a single modeling framework.",

            "text": "The issue that so far received little theoretical attention is that some pathogens are known to show extremely different pathogenic forms ranging from benign to lethal in the same host population. In the chart 'transmissionpathogenesis', this observation implies multiple equilibrium points or even whole continuous equilibrium regions on the tradeoff curve of the chart (Figure 1e,f) . One of such examples is bluetongue virus infecting ruminants (cows, sheeps, deers, etc.). Infection of the susceptible hosts of the same breed results in a broad range of pathological consequences [11] . Some viral diseases are known to exist as several discrete forms (Figure 1f ) rather than with a continuous gradient of symptoms' harshness. The best understood examples are lysogenic bacteriophages, which are 'benign' while host bacteria are growing on rich medium and 'acute' when hosts are starving. Interestingly, a recent report showed intercommunication between bacteriophages allow them to choose the most effective infection strategy, lytic or lysogenic [12 ] . Dual pathogenesis is also known for animal pathogens, for example, Drosophila C virus displays two drastically different pathogenic patterns, lethal and persistent, in genetically identical hosts depending on the route of infection (intra-haemocoelic versus oral) and input virus load. Persistently infected flies display minor pathogenesis, little if any lifespan shortening and sometimes increased fecundity [13] . Acutely infected animals succumb rapidly, producing enormous amounts of virus (more than in 3 orders of magnitude exceeding those in benign infections) [14 ] . Out of human pathogens the extensively studied example of the 'dual behavior' is poliomyelitis, a disease caused by a benign gut virus that sporadically penetrates into central nervous system and induces acute encephalitis, which leads to flaccid paralysis and sometimes death, in less than 1% of infected human hosts [15] . Curiously, dual behavior of poliovirus seems to be evolutionary conserved. Experiments suggest that neurotropism of poliovirus can be compromised by mutations [16] or even by reducing diversity in virus' quasispecies populations [17] . Currently used live poliovirus vaccines are replication-competent and can be transmitted from human to human, but are not capable to induce flaccid paralysis. However, these attenuated viruses rapidly revert to strains again capable to induce severe disease [18] . These observations, taken together with polio-like flaccid paralysis symptoms documented already by Ancient Egyptians, argue the polio-derived pathology is an evolutionary stable adaptation rather than a coincidence. However the exact evolutional benefit of acute poliovirus infection is unclear. One is tempted to speculate that It might relate to specific behavioral reactions of prehistoric humans to paralysis in their infants. Many researchers consider poliovirus neurovirulence an 'accidental' event [19] . They argue that neuroinvasion is not needed for successful polio replication and occurs largely independent on host's parameters (age, gender, etc.) while its retention in evolution is a coincidence as it is believed to happen for neutral adaptations [20] , for example, by occasional genetic linkage with the function that is vital for reproduction. Existence of a minority of patients with severe symptoms (polio, influenza A H1N1 and B, etc.) is clearly a major concern for public health that requires to be studied and explained. Even more importantly, acute viruses (such as Ebola [21] , West Nile [22] , tick-born encephalitis [23] , Crimean-Congo hemmoragic fever [24] , MERS-CoV [25] and many others) can infect humans without any symtoms as judged by seroconversion analysis. Humans asymptomatically infected with dengue [26] and Zika [27] viruses were directly shown to spread the pathogens. Thus variability in pathogenesis is an almost universal feature, but in most cases virusdriven variability is difficult to differentiate from genetic or epigenetic variations in the hosts. This problem is also poorly addressed in animal models since often invariable experimental systems are used. The focus of this article is to discuss the possible theoretical tools that might address this type of phenomena from an evolutional perspective.",

Real-life tradeoff curve shown in Figure 1d is a superposition of plethora multidimensional transient tradeoffs, change over the time therefore changing the position of maximal accessible R 0 (Figure 1f ). If these transformations are occurring regularly over time and space (due to seasons, oscillations of population density, etc.) virus might occupy a wider region of expected equilibria on the tradeoff chart, rather than to continuously evolve toward the sliding short-term punctiform equilibrium. We propose that variation in virulence, usually considered by most researchers as an outcome of biological noise affecting pathogenesis, could in some part come from an implementation of intrinsic virus strategy. Moreover these two possibilities are not mutually exclusive: viruses can intentionally exploit variability and biological noise by making their replication machinery specifically sensitive to variable factors, as in case of bacteriophages, or even employ the stochasticity, as it is believed for poliovirus. Taking in account that virus pathogenesis on the organism level in some cases might depend on infection outcome in a small groups of susceptible cells (e.g., endothelial cells, organizing blood-brain barrier in mammals), it is possible that the pathogenesis on the host level could have a stochastic component, as it has been recently demonstrated on the single-cell level [28 ] . In this case virus might adapt a dual strategy composed of majorly conservative choices (low risk-low reward) and a small proportion of highly risky behavior (high risk-high reward), alternating stochastically.",

All viruses are evolving to lower their virulence (here virus-related mortality rate per time unit, a) and increase transmission (rate per susceptible host per time unit, b). This assumes independent evolution of these two parameters. Dots show different virus strains or species.(b) Hypothesis of tradeoff (interdependence) of virulence and transmission due to host-scale factors. Paths show direction of dynamics of host population toward local equilibrium. Curve with dots: different possible local equilibria (depending on initial values a and b). Thus, virulence and transmissibility, although defined on the epidemiological scale, are mutually restricted due to underlying host-scale factors. (c) A single tradeoff point. The arrows along the curve show direction of long-term genetic evolution toward stable end-point equilibrium. (d) Long-term equilibrium. m and g are natural mortality and recovery rates correspondingly. The straight line is the tangent of the curve. Fitness (R 0 ) could be found as a tangent of this curve. (e-d) Hypothesis: variability in ecological factors leads to a fluctuating of tradeoff curve resulting in viruses with variable pathogenesis (d). Existence of two sparse conditions results in two tradeoff curves and viruses with dual pathogenesis (e).",
