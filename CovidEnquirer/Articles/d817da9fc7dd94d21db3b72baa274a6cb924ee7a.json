A total number of 28 eleven-day-old conventional pigs were orally inoculated with the \u00aeeld isolate of the PEDV strain CV-777. Diarrhea was observed in 32% of the pigs and virus shedding was demonstrated in 100% between postinoculation day (PID) 1 and 8. Serum IgG and IgA antibodies to PEDV were detected by isotype ELISA from PID 12 and 15, respectively, reaching maximum values at PID 32 (IgG) and 21 (IgA). PEDV speci\u00aec IgM ASC occurred in all the tissues between PID 4 and 7, with the strongest response in the intestinal lamina propria. IgA and IgG ASC responses were evident in the intestinal lymphoid tissues from PID 21, the highest number of speci\u00aec ASC corresponded to the duodenum lamina propria. In the systemic lymphoid tissues the number of IgG and IgA ASC detected were lower than in the mucosal tissues, however, in the blood, presence of IgA ASC was constantly detected from PID 14 until the end of the experiment. Memory antibody response to the PEDV was also studied by secondary in vitro stimulation of the mononuclear cells (MNC) isolated from mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen and blood. The memory B cell response was prominent at PID 21 and 25 and consisted in IgG and IgA ASC. To our knowledge, this is the \u00aerst report to research into the presence and distribution of Veterinary Immunology and Immunopathology 84 (2002) 1\u00b116 : S 0 1 6 5 -2 4 2 7 ( 0 1 ) 0 0 3 8 6 -5 speci\u00aec ASC in different locations of the systemic and the gut associated lymphoid tissues after a PEDV infection as well as the presence of memory B cells. #",

Moreover, over the last 4 years the virus has been found in a high percentage of the clinical cases of diarrhoea analysed at our laboratory. These data indicate that PEDV is currently one of the most important causes of gastroenterical disorders in pigs in Spain, which seems to be the same case in other countries (Van Reeth and Pensaert, 1994) .",

Even though there is no clear explanation for this fact, the possibility of extraintestinal stimulation of the immune system has been proposed. However, PEDV has only been located in mesenteric lymph nodes apart from the intestinal mucosa (Debouck et al., 1981; Pensaert, 1999) and the possibility of systemic stimulation is very low. Further investigation is necessary to elucidate this question.",

No speci\u00aec-ASC was evidenced after the secondary in vitro stimulation of MNC obtained from control animals with no previous contact with PEDV. This result con\u00aerms, as it has been described for other virus (Berthon et al., 1990; Van Cott et al., 1993; Yuan et al., 1996) , that only previously in vivo stimulated cells are capable of developing a speci\u00aec response when stimulated in vitro with PEDV antigen. Moreover, a limited number of IgM ASC were detected at PID 4, memory B cells appeared consistently at PID 21 in mesenteric lymph nodes, spleen and blood from PEDV infected pigs. Similar results have been found after oral inoculation of pigs with porcine rotavirus while in TGEV infected animals speci\u00aec B memory cells were detected from PID 12 (Van Cott et al., 1993) . Again, the number of PEDV\u00b1ASC per 5 \u00c2 10 5 MNC after secondary in vitro stimulation were lower than reported by Van Cott et al. (1993) in similar studies for TGEV. As we have suggested for the in vivo response, this difference could be attributed either to a lower sensitivity of the ELISPOT performed with PEDV or to differences in the immune response against each virus. In agreement with other authors (Berthon et al., 1990; Van Cott et al., 1993 and as described for the in vivo stimulated ASC, clear predominance of PEDV-speci\u00aec IgG ASC was observed in systemic lymphoid tissues, blood and spleen, but not in the mesenteric lymph nodes where, at PID 21, IgA ASC outnumbered IgG ASC although reverse circumstances occurred at PID 25.",
