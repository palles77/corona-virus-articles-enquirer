We examine the issue of disclosure of medical errors in the context of emergency medicine. We review the concept of medical error; propose the professional duty of truthfulness as a justification for error disclosure; examine barriers to error disclosure posed by health care systems, patients, physicians, and the law; suggest system changes to address the issue of medical error; offer practical guidelines to promote the practice of error disclosure; and discuss the issue of disclosure of errors made by another clinician.",

The goal of the ACES curriculum is 2-fold: (1) to discuss areas of clinical consequence typically outside the scope of the regular academic curriculum, such as ethical dilemmas and the challenges of professionalism; and (2) to encourage reflection on our roles as caregivers on a personal, public health, and political level. We discuss the aim of the program, the curriculum, and how the ACES program enriches the residency's educational goals. ",

            "text": "What is already known on this topic: Development of new clinical decision rules depends on analysis of large sets of clinical data. Use of free-text data, such as radiology reports, for this purpose is particularly difficult and labor intensive. Natural-language-processing systems, if sufficiently accurate, can identify discrete findings in free-text reports. What question this study addressed: The authors sought to determine whether a natural-language-processing system could accurately detect whether or not a head computed tomography report from a head trauma case declared the presence of a clinically important subdural or epidural hematoma. What this study adds to our knowledge: The study adds head trauma to the growing list of clinical domains in which natural-language-processing systems can effectively interpret free-text reports for screening or research purposes. The system was able to make a confident determination only on about four fifths of the test reports but had a sensitivity of roughly 96% and very high specificity when it did so. How this might change clinical practice: Natural language processing of radiology reports has no immediate clinical application but could reduce the manual review work needed to screen large numbers of reports for analysis, such as in developing new clinical decision rules. The emergency department (ED) is an essential component of the public health response plan for control of acute respiratory infectious threats. Effective respiratory hygiene in the ED is imperative to limit the spread of dangerous respiratory pathogens, including influenza, severe acute respiratory syndrome, avian influenza, and bioterrorism agents, particularly given that these agents may not be immediately identifiable. Sustaining effective respiratory control measures is especially challenging in the ED because of patient crowding, inadequate staffing and resources, and ever-increasing numbers of immunocompromised patients. We present a summary of the most current information available in the literature about respiratory hygiene in the ED, including administrative, patient, and legal issues. This brief synopsis should help clinicians and administrators understand, develop, and implement appropriate policies and procedures to address respiratory hygiene in the ED.",

            "text": "What question this study addressed: What are the prognostic implications of this classification scheme for inhospital and 1-year survival among ED patients suspected of having infection as evidenced by blood cultures being taken? What this study adds to our knowledge: Among this 3,000-person high-risk ED population with suspected infection, SIRS did not portend a worse prognosis, whereas severe sepsis, septic shock, and a higher number of dysfunctional organs were associated with increased mortality. How this might change clinical practice: This study demonstrates that ED patients with severe sepsis, septic shock, or dysfunctional organs in the setting of infection are at greater risk of death. Such patients might be targeted for specific interventions to treat these conditions. What is already known on this topic: Nonprescription analgesics, such as acetaminophen and ibuprofen, have been shown to decrease musculoskeletal pain resulting from trauma. They have infrequently been compared in randomized trials, and their relative efficacy is not known. What question this study addressed: This randomized controlled trial of 260 patients with grade I or II lateral ankle sprains compared nonprescription-strength acetaminophen and ibuprofen therapy to determine whether acetaminophen was less effective than ibuprofen. What this study adds to our knowledge: Over-thecounter acetaminophen and ibuprofen treatments seem to result in similar relief from pain on walking and resumption of normal activities after ankle sprain injury. How this might change clinical practice: This study supports the use of acetaminophen for ankle sprain injury, particularly if the patient is at risk for nonsteroidal antiinflammatory drug-related adverse effects.",

No previous studies have explored this application of procedural ultrasonography.What this study adds to our knowledge: Four emergency physicians performed 22 blocks on 11 patients after receiving 1 hour of training. All blocks were successful; none required rescue anesthesia or analgesia. How this might change clinical practice: This pilot study suggests another useful application for emergency department ultrasonography, but randomized trials are needed to establish the benefit of ultrasonographic guidance.

What question this study addressed: How do adverse events, efficacy, and length of sedation differ between the IV and IM routes for ketamine-assisted emergency department orthopedic procedures in children? What this study adds to our knowledge: This randomized controlled trial of 208 children with orthopedic injuries found that 4 mg/kg IM was more effective than 1 mg/kg IV; however, this may reflect the doses chosen for the study rather than the route. Children receiving ketamine IM required almost 50 minutes longer to recover and experienced approximately twice the rate of recovery vomiting. How this might change clinical practice: This study confirms shorter recoveries with IV ketamine compared to IM and suggests less vomiting as well.613 Should I Give Ketamine IV or IM?
