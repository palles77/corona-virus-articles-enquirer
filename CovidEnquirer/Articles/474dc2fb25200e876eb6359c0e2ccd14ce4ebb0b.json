On physical examination, the child is alert and interactive. Vital signs are significant for tachypnea but with a normal oxygen saturation as measured by pulse oximetry. The respiratory examination reveals a child that is in moderate respiratory distress; there are subcostal and intercostal retractions, coarse breath sounds, and expiratory wheezing audible in all lung fields. A nasal wash is sent off for a rapid viral screen and comes back positive for respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). A bronchodilator trial is ineffective, as is a trial of racemic epinephrine. Although the child is in respiratory distress, she is able to maintain hydration and can possibly be managed at home. However, the ED physician is uncomfortable in discharging her home. Therefore, the physician decides to obtain a blood sample from the infant to analyze peripheral blood leukocyte global gene expression by means of an RNA microarray Abstract:",

There is a growing need for novel, disease-specific biomarkers that can improve the outcome of pediatric infectious diseases commonly encountered in the emergency department (ED). Viral respiratory infections, central nervous system infections, sepsis, and septic shock are acute disease states frequently encountered in the ED. In this review, we describe a host of novel biomarkers, including a diverse set of cytokines, chemokines, and nitric oxide-based metabolites. Based on disease pathophysiology, a rationale is provided for a molecular-or biomarker-based approach in the ED. Throughout this review, emphasis is placed on diagnostic rapidity because this relates directly to timeliness and quality of care in a busy ED. Once the biomarkers become more clinically available, in a rapid ED setting as bedside point-of-care assays, quality of care will be enhanced, not only by means of diagnostics but also in prognosticating severity of illness. (\"RNA chip\"). Based on the RNA expression profile, that is, the set of genes overexpressed vs those underexpressed, the prediction is that the patient will get sicker from the RSV bronchiolitis. Hence, the physician decides that the safest course would be to observe the infant for 23 hours.",

            "text": "Acute bronchiolitis and ILI are 2 major respiratory infections commonly encountered in the pediatric ED. Respiratory syncytial virus is the most common cause of lower respiratory tract infections, particularly in children, including bron-chiolitis and pneumonia. 3, 4 There is a broad spectrum of disease severity for bronchiolitis, the leading cause of hospitalization for infants in the United States with associated hospitalization costs in excess of $500 million per year, and is also responsible for frequent ED visits. 5, 6 Pandemics like the 2009 novel swine-origin influenza A (H1N1) virus pose significant challenges: increased transmission relative to seasonal influenza, severe disease in patients with medical comorbidities, and difficulty in predicting which children with viral respiratory symptoms are at risk for influenza complications. 7 Given the immense disease burden of the above respiratory infections, development of rapid diagnostic and prognostic tools is a pressing need. In the evaluation of acutely ill children with respiratory infections in the ED, risk stratification by using biomarkers might augment clinical decision making and thus improve clinical outcomes. 8 One of the proposed mechanisms for RSV pathophysiology relies on toll-like receptor functionality. Toll-like receptor 4 (TLR4), along with its coreceptor CD14, is activated by bacterial lipopolysaccharide. The RSV-specific F-protein elicits a similar TLR4 response, but the response is significantly weaker than the lipopolysaccharide response. 9 Another cofactor, the MD-2 polypeptide, is believed to play an important role in the TLR4 pathway described above, but this relationship is still under investigation. Lipopolysaccharide antagonist analogs that lower LPS mandated TLR4 activation also lower RSV F-protein-mandated TLR4 activation. 9 The measurement of RSV F-protein levels, TLR4 activation, and MD-2 levels offers a potentially novel biomarker system in the pediatric domain for prognostic purposes. 9 Serum vitamin D levels are another biomarker under research for acute bronchiolitis. Serum vitamin D levels have been shown to vary directly with immunoglobulin G and A levels and inversely with immunoglobulin E levels in the acute stages of bronchiolitis. 10 Data from a recent clinical trial showed that serum vitamin D levels were significantly lower in children with acute-phase bronchiolitis compared with healthy controls. 10 Microarray-based whole-genome expression arrays have also been used in the ED to determine correlations with severity of RSV bronchiolitis. 11 We recently showed that there was systemic activation of interferon signaling networks during acute RSV infection in children presenting to the ED. 11 We also showed that this \"biosignature\" was effective in discriminating patients with acute RSV bronchiolitis from healthy age-matched controls. 11 These gene transcripts or their protein products could be promising biomarkers for acute RSV bronchiolitis in future prospective studies. The case vignette at the beginning of this article describes one hypothetical situation in which microarray-based biomarkers might benefit clinical decision making. Before that, DNA-or RNA-based diagnostic and prognostic tests have to be cost-effective and rapid enough to be clinically effective in a busy ED setting. Irrespective of study, the invasive nature of blood collection for determining serum levels of any putative biomarker for acute bronchiolitis is a potential deterrent from use in an ED setting.",

            "text": "Serum interlukin-6 (IL-6) concentration has shown potential as a biomarker of disease severity in pandemic H1N1 influenza type A. 12 Interlukin-6 is a prominent cytokine in the immune response and plays a critical role in acute-phase response and fever. Interlukin-6 is also relevant to several pathogenic inflammatory states, with serum concentrations varying directly with sepsis severity, onset of H1N1 type A, and severe acute respiratory syndrome. 12 Serum IL-6 in pandemic H1N1 was significantly higher in patients who required critical care support compared with those who did not; however, this did not affect disease outcome. 12 This suggests that IL-6 shows potential as a biomarker of disease severity, but not as a therapeutic agent. As mentioned above for bronchiolitis biomarkers, serum levels of IL-6 would require a blood sample and thus are nonideal in the pediatric ED. During influenza virus infection, epithelial cells, macrophages, lymphocytes, and other cells release a complex series of cytokines and chemokines in an attempt to overcome viral replication and disease progression. [13] [14] [15] Nitric oxide (NO), a key mediator of airway inflammation, is also released. It is unclear if increased NO activity is a marker of clinical disease, a marker of the innate antiviral response, or associated significantly with a unique respiratory virus infection. 16 In the murine model of RSV for instance, NO production in the lungs appears to be associated with viral clearance and lung disease. 17 Induced NO synthase activity and production of NO were associated with enhanced clearance of RSV, yet they were also associated with airway inflammatory changes and airway dysfunction. 17 In murine studies of experimental influenza A-triggered pneumonia, excessive NO biosynthesis, as measured by its metabolites nitrate and nitrite (collectively referred to NOx), was demonstrated in the lungs. 18, 19 This suggested that the metabolites may be markers of influenza-mediated disease in the respiratory tract.",

It can be detected in exhaled air of healthy individuals and at increased levels in subjects with pulmonary disease including asthma, bronchiectasis, and upper respiratory infections. [20] [21] [22] [23] [24] In aqueous solutions, NO is rapidly converted to distinct oxides of nitrogen, which may thus be potential biomarkers of disease severity in acutely ill patients presenting with ILI to the ED. 21, 25 During the 2009 novel H1N1 pandemic, we collected nasal wash specimens from children with ILI in the ED and then measured NOx concentration by high-performance liquid chromatography. Overall, our data suggested that concentration of NO-derived nitrate in nasal secretions in children in the ED may be related to type of viral pathogen causative for ILI: RSV subtype B-associated ILI had higher nasal wash nitrate compared with all other viruses combined (P = .002). 8 Ongoing studies will determine the predictive potential of this putative biomarker for important disease outcomes in sicker patients. Exhaled NO has also been studied as a putative biomarker for respiratory infections caused by influenza, rhinovirus, and other viral pathogens, but the data have been equivocal. 26, 27 The conflicting data above may simply reflect technical issues in measuring exhaled NO. This methodology is cumbersome to achieve in the pediatric population, either for inpatients or in the ED. The newer NIOX-MINO (Aerocrine, Morrisville, NC) handheld NO detector has proven to be as reliable as the older, stationary chemiluminescence analyzer, the Ecomedics (ECO MEDICS, Duernten, Switzerland). 28 Its portability may make it easier to handle in the ED setting. Focusing on stable NO metabolites in nasal secretions from patients with ILI in the ED may still be the better approach because of ready accessibility. Future studies are needed that can establish correlations between nasal secretion NOx and exhaled NO for ILI-type disease processes in the ED. A major benefit of working with respiratory tract-based biomarkers, either in exhaled breath or via biochemical analyses of nasal secretions, is the independence from a blood collection in the ED.",

Several studies have implicated the overproduction of NO as the cause for the decompensated state. 34 Sepsis, septic shock, and systemic inflammatory response syndrome in intensive care settings are associated with increased plasma levels of NOx. [36] [37] [38] Measuring both plasma and urinary NOx has revealed elevations in patients with sepsis and septic shock. 34 This may be caused by an elevated innate immune response to infection and inflammation, particularly in sepsis and shock. Such a response is associated with increased activity of induced NO synthase and thus more NO being released. 39, 40 Urinary NOx, primarily nitrate, reflects both the production and use of NO. [41] [42] [43] Sepsis and shock can expose the kidney to ischemic injury, which can be reflected in low levels of urinary NOx excretion likely caused by low endogenous NO generation. 44, 45 Conversely, because most (96%) of filtered nitrate and nitrite is reabsorbed by the renal tubules, high levels in urine secondary to reduced renal reabsorption may reflect acute renal failure concomitant with sepsis/septic shock. 44, 46 Although NO directly and indirectly, by conversion to peroxynitrite, can be bactericidal, excessive levels are counterproductive as evidenced by the refractory vasodilation, hypotension, and decreased tissue perfusion. 34 Irrespective of mechanism and level of metabolite, NO as a downstream effector of innate immune activation lends itself as a potential biomarker for sepsis. This may be particularly useful in the ED because the concentration of NOx in plasma or urine may predict important inpatient clinical outcomes, such as need for hospitalization, level of support (intensive care vs regular floor), and mortality.",

This will require the development, validation, and then clinical usage of relatively simple, rapid, and cost-effective techniques that may sample multiple body fluids (plasma, urine, nasal secretion, CSF). 51 This has been summarized in Figure 1 . Regarding the hypothetical clinical vignette at the outset, instead of an invasive blood specimen, the nasal wash that was initially obtained for a rapid viral diagnosis can also be used for obtaining host cellular material. RNA expression profiling can be done on that cellular material. Assuming a relatively rapid turnaround, the gene expression signature might correlate with severity of respiratory illness, and the information thus obtained might be used for making a patient disposition.",
