            "text": "Catechol derivatives show different biological properties, including inhibition of hypoxia inducible factor-prolyl hydroxylase-2 (HPH) in the treatment of colitis, 1 antiepileptogenic, 2 pulmonary fibrosis, 3 anticancer, 4-6 antimicrobial, 7 and anti-Parkinson activities. 8 Moreover, they are active against viruses, as in the case of rhinovirus, 9 HIV-1 integrase, 10, 11 HIV-1 reverse transcriptase, 12 and coronavirus. 13 The biological activity of catechols is associated to their antioxidant property, that is the capacity of transferring single-electron and/or hydrogen-atom to reactive free radicals, [14] [15] [16] as well as, to binding pro-oxidant metal ions. 17 The antioxidant activity can be oriented toward specific cellular compartments by controlling the chemical and physical properties of the substituents on the aromatic ring. 18 For example, the limited accessibility of highly hydrophilic catechols to specific intracellular targets has been improved by the synthesis of lipophilic derivatives possessing long carbon alkyl side chains. [19] [20] [21] In the case of bioactive hydroxytyrosol and dihydrocaffeic acid derivatives, 22, 23 which are characterized by the concomitant presence of alcoholic and ortho-diphenol groups, 24, 25 the side-chain functionalization requires expensive and tedious protection/deprotection sequences. As an alternative, we described the synthesis of lipophilic catechols by selective oxidation of side-chain functionalized phenol derivatives, using tyrosinase supported on Eupergit C250L resin (Tyr/ECM), by sequential deposition of alternatively charged poly(allylamine hydrochloride) (PAH) and polystyrene sulfonate (PSS). 26 Tyrosinase is a copper enzyme which catalyzes the hydroxylation of monophenols to ortho-diphenols and ortho-quinones using dioxygen (O 2 ) as primary oxidant. 27 In this latter case, dihydrocaffeoyl catechols showed antiviral activity against Influenza A virus, an infection that continue to represent a severe threat wordwide. 28 Derivatives characterized by antioxidant activity and longer carbon alkyl side-chains were more effective, suggesting the possibility of novel inhibition mechanisms based on both redox and lipophilic properties. 26 These data were in accordance with previous findings about the activity of lipophilic glutathione (GSH) derivatives, which were able to enter into the cell more easily than GSH, thus inhibiting the replication of DNA and RNA viruses. 29 The efficacy of tyrosinase in the synthesis of simple catechol derivatives was successively increased by immobilization of the enzyme on multi-walled carbonanotubes (MWCNTs), using the Layer-by-Layer (LbL) procedure. 30 The LbL procedure is based on the consecutive deposition of alternatively charged polyelectrolytes onto the active species, able to protect proteins from high-molecular-weight denaturing agents. 31 MWCNTs are characterized by high surface area for enzyme loading, as well as biocompatibility, and favorable electrochemical and mechanical properties. 32, 33 The best catalyst (indicated in the follow as MWCNT/Tyr) was obtained by co-immobilization of Tyr and Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA) on oxidized MWCNTs, in the presence of polydiallyldimethyl ammonium chloride (PDDA). 30 Here we report the use of MWCNT/Tyr for the improved synthesis of lipophilic hydroxytyrosol and dihydrocaffeoyl catechols, and their antiviral activity against a large panel of DNA and RNA viruses, including Poliovirus type 1, Echovirus type 9, Herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) and type 2 (HSV-2), Coxsackie virus type B3 (Cox B3), Adenovirus type 2 and type 5, and Cytomegalovirus (CMV). Some of these compounds were endowed with antiviral activity at sub-toxic concentrations. The mechanism of action of the most active dihydrocaffeoyl derivative was investigated in detail against a model of HSV-1 infection.",

            "text": "The MWCNT/Tyr was prepared as previously reported. 30 Briefly, mushroom Tyr from Agaricus bisporus and BSA (BSA/Tyr ratio 3:1) were immobilized on oxidized MWCNTs, 34 by deposition of a layer of PDDA (MWCNTs-PDDA/Tyr ratio of 5:1) in sodium phosphate buffer (PBS; 0.1 M, pH 7) at room temperature ( Fig. 1, step A) . The excess PDDA was removed by centrifugation/re-dispersion cycles since residual PDDA in the solution can precipitate upon mixing with enzyme. The concentration of adsorbed PDDA was evaluated by UV-vis analysis (at 595 nm) of the supernatant after treatment with Comassie Brillant Blue (CBB) (experimental details and the calibration curve for PDDA are in Supplementary information, SI # 1, Table A , Fig. 1 ). 35 The amount of PDDA adsorbed per mg of starting material was found to be 0.58 \u00b1 0.01 mg. This amount is similar to the 'just enough' amount of PDDA (0.48 mg) required to cover all the surface of MWCNTs (100% covering efficacy), as previously reported. 36 The presence of cationic PDDA facilitates the loading of Tyr, that is negatively charged at the operative pH 7.0 (isoelectric point of Tyr 4.7-5.0). 37 Bovine Serum Albumin (BSA), an inert enzyme characterized by an isoelectric point close to Tyr, was used during the co-immobilization procedure to reduce the surface area available to the enzyme, avoiding undesired conformational changes due to enzyme strives for the greatest surface coverage. 38 Glutaraldehyde (GA) was then added to increase the reticulation grade and stability of the catalyst (Fig. 1, step B ). 39 Crosslinking with glutaraldehyde is a widely applied procedure for the immobilization/reticulation of enzymes on different kind of support. 40 In accordance with data reported in the literature, 41 the effectiveness of the crosslinking procedure was confirmed by FT-IR analysis, observing the appearance of a new absorption band in the range of 1700-2100 cm \u00c01 attributable to the formation of Schiff bases (representative FT-IR spectra of MWCNT/Tyr with or without GA are in Supplementary information, SI # 2, Figs. 2 and 3). The activity of native Tyr (81.2 U/mg) was determined by the dopachrome assay following the oxidation of L-tyrosine at 475 nm (the enzyme unit is defined as the increase in absorbance of 10 \u00c03 unit/min at 25\u00b0C in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.0). 42 The activity of MWCNT/Tyr (80.5 U/mg), and the value of activity parameters, namely immobilization yield (68%), and activity yield (48.5%), were in accordance with our previous data (for the definition of these parameters see in the experimental part). 30 The Scanning Electron Microscopy (SEM) and Atomic Force Microscopy (AFM) of MWCNT/Tyr were in accordance with data previously reported, and confirmed the polyelectrolyte deposition and enzyme immobilization. 30 In particular, the AFM analysis clearly showed functionalized nanotubes characterized by a smooth surface probably due to the presence of BSA in the interstitial sites between Tyr molecules. The maximum height and width were higher than that observed for MWCNTs alone (experimental procedures, SEM analysis, and magnified details of the bi-dimensional high resolution AFM images of MWCNT/Ty and MWCNTs with the corresponding profiles, are in Supplementary information SI #3, Figs. 4 and 5). 30 Kinetic parameters for native Tyr and MWCNT/Tyr were evaluated in CH 2 Cl 2 and PBS, using tyrosol acetate 2a as a selected substrate to be oxidized (see next). The initial reaction rates were measured at substrate concentrations ranging from 1.0 to 20 mM at 25\u00b0C. Kinetic constants were evaluated by using different linear regression equations (Lineweaver-Burk, Hanes and Eadie-Hofstee). The kinetic parameters (K m , V max , and K cat ) for the native enzyme and MWCNT/Tyr are reported in Table 1 . MWCNT/Tyr shows a performance about two times lower than the native enzyme, in agreement with the expected decrease of catalytic efficiency after immobilization. The catalytic efficacy of MWCNT/Tyr (defined as V max /K m ) was found to be 81.7 10 -4 (as the average value of the three tests). The ester derivatives of commercially available 3(4-hydroxyphenyl)propanoic acid 1 and tyrosol 2 (4-hydroxyphenylethyl alcohol) were used as substrates. In particular, the ester derivatives 1a-d (Scheme 1) were prepared by reaction of 1 with an excess of the appropriate alcohol in the presence of trimethylchlorosilane (TMCS) at 25\u00b0C (experimental details are in Supporting SI #4). 43 The esterification of 2 to yield compounds 2a-d (Scheme 2) was carried-out using lipase from Candida antarctica to avoid the possible formation of mixture of esters, due to competition between alcoholic and phenol groups (Supporting SI #5). 44 The oxidation of compounds 1 and 1a-d (0.05 mmol) was performed with MWCNT/Tyr (240 U) in CH 2 Cl 2 /buffer (Na phosphate 0.1 M pH 7, CH 2 Cl 2 /buffer ratio 1.0:0.1) at 25\u00b0C under O 2 atmosphere for 24 h (Scheme 1, Table 2 ). The use of CH 2 Cl 2 as reaction solvent was necessary to increase the solubility of hydrophobic substrates, in accordance with improved stability and selectivity (with limited formation of ortho-benzoquinones and polymeric side-products) reported for Tyr in organic solvents. 45 The oxidation of 1 and 1a (as selected samples) was also performed using previously reported Tyr/ECM as reference, in which Tyr is covalently immobilized on micro-spheres of the synthetic resin Eupergit C250L (methacrylamide, N,N 0 -methylenbis-acrylamide polymer). 26 MWCNT/Tyr selectively afforded catechol derivatives 3 and 3a-d in quantitative conversion of substrate and yield of product (Table 2 ). In these reactions, MWCNT/Tyr showed a reactivity similar to Tyr, and higher than Tyr/ECM ( Table 2 , entry 3 versus entries 1 and 2, and entry 6 versus entries 4 and 5). In this latter case 600 U were required to obtain the quantitative yield of products (Table 1 , entries 2, 5 and 10).",

            "text": "The development of antiviral agents has progressed rapidly over the last decades. The drugs approved for use generally inhibit specific steps of viral replication usually by targeting viral proteins with an enzymatic function. Unfortunately, a large majority of the available antiviral drugs are limited in their efficacy by systemic toxicity and drug resistance. 46 Many different circumstances favor the selection of drug resistant strains, for example, high viral loads, intrinsic mutation rates, and prolonged exposure to the drug. For this reason, natural or de-novo designed molecules able to inhibit the replication of DNA or RNA viruses with different mechanisms have been synthesized. 47 Derivatives 3b, 3d, 4a and 4b were characterized by selective antiviral activity. In particular, compounds 3b and 4a demonstrated the highest level of activity against HSV-1 (DNA virus), with ID 50 values of 15 and 20 lg/mL, respectively. Moreover, the same compounds showed slight activity against HSV-2 (60 and 40 lg/mL, respectively) and Cox B3 (RNA virus; 20 and 50 lg/mL, respectively). With regard to 4b, a modest activity against HSV-1 was observed, probably due to toxic effect on cell monolayer, as suggested by the low value of CD 50 (40 lg/mL). Finally, 3b and 3d were effective against CMV (DNA virus), 3d being the most active compound with an ID 50 value of 25 lg/mL. Since 3b was effective against several RNA or DNA viruses, especially in the case of herpetic viruses (HSV-1, HSV-2 and CMV), its mechanism of action was investigated in more detail using a model of HSV-1 infection. In particular, compound 3b was added at different times on VERO cells infected with 0.1 MOI of HSV-1, to determine the inhibition of the virus yield during specific periods in the virus life-cycle. The results clearly demonstrate that 3b interferes with an early step of the viral replicative cycle. Indeed, the viral replication was blocked during the first hour of infection. Otherwise, no reduction was observed when 3b was added after 2 h. Moreover, a slight reduction of virus yield was observed during the adsorption period (Fig. 2) .",

First, the effect of the compound was studied during the viral adsorption period by means of the infective center assay. Results obtained from this experiment demonstrated that 3b did not significantly inhibit adsorption of HSV-1 at concentrations higher than 5 times the ID 50 (Fig. 3) . Furthermore, it was important to establish if any virucidal effect or protective actions for Vero cells was produced. Our results demonstrated that 3b was not virucidal for HSV-1 and did not exerted any protective action for the cells, thus suggesting that the reduction in the virus yield, immediately after the adsorption period, could be related to the interference of the compound with penetration, un-coating and/or another early step of HSV-1 replication.",

MWCNT/Tyr was a stable catalyst for at least six recycle experiments. Among lipophilic catechols, compounds 3b, 3d, 4a and 4b were active against HSV-1, HSV-2, Cox B3 and CMV. In a previous study, compounds 4a and 4b were also active against influenza A/PR8/H1N1 virus, showing the highest antioxidant activity as measured by the 2,2-diphenyilpicrylhydrazyl (DPPH) radical scavenging assay. 26 In the case of the inhibition of HSV-1 and HSV-2 viruses, the highest antiviral activity prevailed in derivatives characterized by a low/medium long alkyl side-chain.
