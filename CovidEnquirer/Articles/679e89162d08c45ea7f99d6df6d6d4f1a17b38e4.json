Two membrane modules were compared in continuous operation for about 75 days. During stable operation, SMBR achieved almost complete phage removal for both membrane modules. For the 0.22 mm module, the cake layer, the gel layer and the membrane contributed 6.3 log, 3.1 log and 1.7 log, respectively to phage removal, confirming the importance of the cake/gel layer formed on the surface of membrane. The damage of the cake/gel layer resulted in the decrease of phage removal. As for the 0.1 mm one, the membrane alone played a major role in phage removal. Inactivation by activated sludge and adsorption by cake/gel layer contributed about 3.6 log to phage removal everyday so that there was no phage accumulation in bulk solution. The results demonstrated that SMBR was an efficient system and recommended for treatment of virus-bearing wastewater. #",

Some of above characteristics make SMBR have a potential ability to remove virus more effectively and safely. In last decades, several researches on viral removal by MBR had been carried out and gained some achievements, at the same time, present a few deficiencies. Chiemchaisri et al. [10] put forth that gel layer formed on the membrane surface could reject 4-6 log coliphage Qb but did not gain the complete phage removal. Then Urase et al. [11] demonstrated that the cake/gel layer of membrane surface made a major contribution to reject virus in activated sludge by batch experiments. However, there was still 3-4 log of phages remained in effluent. Afterwards, Kawamura et al. [12] fulfilled the complete removal of phage Qb and T1 by using ultramembrane unit but little phage removal mechanism was considered. Otaki et al. [13] also employed microfiltration and ultrafiltration process to the virus removal of the water supply. Recently, Wen et al. [8] investigated the performance of a SMBR for treatment of hospital wastewater but no considerations was given to rival removal. To date, however, more detailed and systematic reports on viral removal efficiency and mechanism of SMBR are still scarce [14] .",

For 0.22 mm membrane module, 2 log concentration of T4 was detected in the effluent at the beginning (see Fig. 3B , Stage a). The results indicated that the cake/gel layer formed on the 0.22 mm membrane surface was not adequate to remove all unexpected phages surged into feed wastewater. But, as time past, this value decreased gradually and stabilized at 0.2-0.3 log till day 50. It was inferred that cake layer formed on the membrane surface further reduced the effective pore size. The SEM images of the membrane surface show the significant difference between a new membrane and a longterm used one ( Fig. 4A and B) .

It was clear that there was no accumulation of phage in bulk solution under the experimental conditions in spite of continuous injection of T4 into the reactor. According to statistic calculation, about 11.0 log phages were fed into the system during this period without excess sludge discharge, which would at least allow C b value to reach 9.9 log. So it can be speculated that about 3.6 log of phages were possibly removed inside SMBR compartment everyday. Two main factors, inactivation by activated sludge (r AS ) and adsorption by cake/gel layer might account for it. Inactivation by extra cellular enzyme, phagocytosis by bacteria and protozoans, and lysis in activated sludge might lead to loss of phages in bulk solution. During the aeration, phages collided with the cake/gel layer and some were adsorbed by it. However, the contribution of each mechanism to phage removal is required further study.",

Five days later, chemical cleansing was carried out for the removal of the gel layer on the membrane surface (Fig. 3, Stage d) .As shown in Fig. 3B and C, when the cake layer was present, almost all phages (about 6.3 log) in bulk solution were intercepted by both membrane modules. When the cake layer was removed but the gel one were present, the phage removal efficiency of the 0.22 mm and 0.1 mm membranes were 3.1 log (r c 0.22) and 5.8 log (r c 0.1), respectively under an influent phage concentration of 5.8 log. When the gel layer was removed by chemical cleansing, the phage removal rates for the two modules were 1.7 log (r m 0.22) and 5.8 log (r m 0.1) for corresponding membrane modules. It can be concluded that the cake layer and gel layer play a significant role on the phage removal for the 0.22 mm membrane module. If cake/ gel layer was decomposed by any factors, 2.7-4.1 log of phage would permeate to effluent. For the 0.1 mm module, on the other hand, membrane alone could block most phages from leaking by direct membrane interception. 1-2 PFU ml \u00c01 of phage leakage is likely because that the pore size is not absolutely uniform. Consequently, the formation of cake layer and gel layer on 0.1 mm membrane would permit a safer disinfection effect. Fig. 3D and E shows the variations of the filtration resistance of the two modules. The filtration resistance decreased with the removal of cake and gel layers through hydraulic and chemical cleansing on the membrane. For each membrane module, there was a positive correlation between the filtration resistance and the phage removal, which was more evident for the 0.22 mm membrane.",

Results showed that there was still 3-4 log of phages in the effluent which was likely due to the loose cake/ gel layer formed on membrane since the experimental period was quite short. Chiemchaisri et al. [10] referred to phage removal during organic stabilization and nitrogen removal in an MBR system, but little information on mechanism was discussed. In this paper, viral removal in an MBR equipped with two different membranes (pore size: 0.22 mm and 0.1 mm, respectively), one larger and the other smaller than phage T4 size, was evaluated under different operational stages. Although both of the two membranes demonstrated almost complete removal of phage T4 during stable operation, phage removal mechanisms for the two membranes were quite different. For the 0.1 mm membrane, direct interception by membrane played a key role for T4 removal. For the 0.22 mm membrane, on the other hand, the cake/gel layer formed on the membrane played an important role.",
