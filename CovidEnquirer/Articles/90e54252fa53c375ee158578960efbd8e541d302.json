Children who later had acute severe bronchiolitis irrespective of viral species had a 2.5-fold increased responsiveness to methacholine (provocative dose of methacholine producing a 15% decrease in transcutaneous oxygen pressure [PD 15 ]) at age 1 month compared with control subjects (median PD 15 in cases vs control subjects, 0.13 vs 0.33 mmol; P 5 .01), whereas differences in baseline airflow were not significant for forced expiratory volume at 0.5 seconds (mean z score for cases vs control subjects, 20.18 vs 20.01; P 5 .36) and forced expiratory flow at 50% of forced vital capacity (mean z score for cases vs control subjects, 20.37 vs 20.09; P 5 .13).

All these secondary analyses show similar patterns of pre-existing increased reactivity to methacholine in cases versus control subjects. Some of these subgroup analyses (eg, the RSV group) did not reach statistical significance, probably because of the lack of power from dividing the main study group into smaller subgroups. The similarities of increased bronchial responsiveness in all groups of infants presenting with symptoms of acute severe airway obstruction independently of trigger or age at onset suggest a common deficiency rather than particular trigger attributes.
