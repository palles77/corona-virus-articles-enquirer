The antigenicity, pathogenicity and epidemiology of this virus have been unclear. Here we first used a recombinant baculovirus expression system to express the 13 and 111 N-terminus amino-acid-truncated DcHEV ORF2 protein in insect Tn5 cells, and we obtained two types of virus-like particles (VLPs) with densities of 1.300 g/cm 3 and 1.285 g/cm 3 , respectively. The small VLPs (Dc4sVLPs) were estimated to be 24 nm in diameter, and were assembled by a protein with the molecular mass 53 kDa. The large VLPs (Dc3nVLPs and Dc4nVLPs) were 35 nm in diameter, and were assembled by a 64-kDa protein. An antigenic analysis demonstrated that DcHEV was cross-reactive with G1, G3-G6, ferret and rat HEVs, and DcHEV showed a stronger cross-reactivity to G1 G3-G6 HEV than it did to rat and ferret HEV. In addition, the antibody against DcHEV-LPs neutralized G1 and G3 HEV in a cell culture system, suggesting that the serotypes of these HEVs are identical. We also found that the amino acid residue Met-358 affects the small DcHEV-LPs assembly.",

ORF1 encodes nonstructural proteins involved in replication and viral protein processing. ORF2 both encodes a capsid protein that contains immunogenic epitopes and induces neutralizing antibodies, and ORF2 is the target for vaccine development (Li et al., 2004; Zhu et al., 2010) . ORF3, which partially overlaps with ORF2, encodes a cytoskeleton-associated phosphoprotein with multiple functions (Graff et al., 2005; Tyagi et al., 2001 Tyagi et al., , 2004 Zafrullah et al., 1997) .",

This change may make Met-358 apt to bury itself to avoid solvent and thereby drive its neighboring residues toward three-fold protrusions. Thus, one possibility is that the short \u2423-helix-containing loop may entangle the proline-rich hinge and prevent it from sustaining the spikes, thus resulting in the disruption of extending dimers (spikes) in T = 1 VLPs. Given our finding that expressed ORF2 with the mutation from Met-358 back to Thr-358 can assemble into T = 1 VLPs again, we confidently propose that the substitution of Thr-358 by Met-358 in the M domain is responsible for the failure of the T = 1 VLPs assembly. In the case of the T = 3 VLPs, the residue 358, unlike in the T = 1 VLPs is not completely exposed to solvent. These residues are positioned to the side and below of the P-domain in the A-B dimer and right under the P-domain in the C-C dimer. Thus, the increase of hydrophobicity of the residues is not able to change their positions significantly in the dimers to affect the regular assembly of T = 3 VLPs.",

Although the DcHEV RNA positive rate was 1.5% in the adult dromedary camel fecal samples, the sero-prevalence is not clear.

The native size virus-like particles Dc3nVLPs and Dc4nVLPs were obtained by expressing the 13 N-terminal aa-truncated Dc3 and Dc4 ORF2. The deletion of 13 N-terminal aa and approximately 50C-terminal aa does not affect the formation of VLPs. As the nativesize VLPs of G3 HEV, nucleic acids were also detected from both Dc3nVLPs and Dc4nVLPs, suggesting that RNA binding might be the extrinsic factor essential for the assembly of HEV native capsid (Xing et al., 2010) . Further studies including three-dimensional structural analyses are needed. . We observed the time course of the expression of the mutant, and protein bands were visualized by CB staining and a Western blot assay with anti-G1 HEV-LP rabbit serum (WB) (A). M, molecular weight marker; C, mock-infected Tn5 cells; W, wild-type baculovirus-infected Tn5 cells; lanes 1-10, Ac[Dc3n111ORF2mt] -infected Tn5 cells harvested on days 1-10 p.i. Proteins in cell culture supernatants were purified by CsCl equilibrium density gradient centrifugation. Aliquots from each fraction were analyzed by electrophoresis on a 5-20% polyacrylamide gel, and CB-stained (B). The VLPs were observed by EM (C). Bar, 100 nm. Magenta indicates the Thr-358 by sphere for highlighting. Left: Thr-358 localization in the HEV monomer. Right: A trimmer of the capsid protein of HEV-LP viewed from outside of HEV-LP. Three Thr-358s are round the icosahedral 3-fold axes at periphery and exposed to solvent. The Dc4sVLP was obtained by expressing the N-terminal 111-aa deleted Dc4ORF2, which is similar to G1, G3, and G4 HEV. An interesting finding is that a naturally occurring substitution from Thr to Met at aa358 of ORF2 caused the abortion of the small VLPs' assembly. The naturally occurring single point mutation hampers the T = 1 particle assembly by the expressed N-111 truncated proteins. This phenomenon (i.e., that only one mutation is capable of disrupting the normal assembly of the entire virus particle) was observed with other viruses such as Sesbania Mosaic virus (Pappachan et al., 2009) , encephalitis virus (Yoshii et al., 2004) , nudaurelia capensis virus (Taylor and Johnson, 2005) , and coronavirus (de Haan et al., 1998) .",
