            "text": "With nearly 33 million global citizens living with HIVor AIDS, the need for a highly qualified, competent nursing workforce is critical. With the recent increase in global funding to expand access to antiretroviral therapy, there have been considerable efforts to improve the capacity of nurses to initiate and maintain antiretroviral therapy while evaluating its effectiveness, monitoring for side effects, reducing the incidence of drug-drug interactions (including drug interactions related to therapies provided by traditional healers), promoting adherence to therapies, and providing management of symptoms. Therefore, using a participatory action approach, nursing leaders from six sub-Saharan African countries collaborated to develop the essential nursing competencies related to HIV and AIDS. These competencies can help to guide preservice education related to HIV and AIDS, to strengthen in-service or capacity-building programs designed for already qualified nurses, and to guide policy and regulatory reform in the context of taskshifting, task-sharing, and scope of nursing practices.

Furthermore, according to UNAIDS, ''some 15 million children under age 18 have lost one or both parents to AIDS and countless children become responsible for the care of their siblings and other family members when parents are debilitated by poor health'' (UNAIDS, 2009 ). Children who have lost one or both parents are frequently subjected to discrimination and are less likely to receive health care, education and other critical services. Additionally, child-headed households, or children living on the streets, are at an even higher risk for exploitation, abuse, exposure to HIV, and poverty (UNAIDS & UNICEF, 2004) .",

To be comprehensive, the participating nursing leaders firmly articulated that the identified competencies must address the cognitive, affective, and psychomotor domains specific to HIV and AIDS as well as the professional expectations of nurses related to HIV and AIDS. Finally, to address the complex issues associated with HIV and AIDS, the nurse leaders participating in the development process supported a holistic approach examining the contribution of nursing across the care continuum (prevention, care, and treatment) while also addressing the psychosocial, spiritual, ethical perspective, individual, and community level stigma associated with the disease as well as the essential leadership, mentoring, and professional development required of nurses and nursing.

The core competencies flow directly from the defined tasks of the care cadres, and once they are spelled out they will form the backbone of training curricula development. A comparison of required core competencies with pre-existing competencies of staff to be recruit(ed) leads directly to the identify of training curricula'' (p. 11). ''Certifying training for successful acquisition of competence through the training activity is in itself seen as an element of quality control for training providers, as they have to demonstrate that the training adheres to certain national standards'' (p. 14). ''Countries that decide to build in a certification component for trainees do so on the basis of nationally defined standards and procedure[s] that regulate (a) on what basis trainees will be awarded certification (including training content, training process, and outcome verification procedures), (b) what processes can be put in place to enable training issues such as certificates (e.g., accreditation of training providers'' (p. 14).",

''This list of core competencies does not cover all competencies within all aspects of HIV and AIDS care. It is assumed that health workers will build on their preexisting experience in such fields as prevention, counselling, home-based care and end-of-life care. This list is meant to highlight the main tasks that are added to the portfolio of competencies with the introduction of antiretroviral therapy'' (p. 9). ''An emergency response to scaling up training for health workers focuses primarily on building the core antiretroviral therapy-specific competencies upon already existing knowledge, skills and attitudes in an in-service setting. This emergency phase requires the immediate expansion of training programmes to ensure that as many workers are trained as possible within the shortest period of time. At the same time, mechanisms to support the sustainability of competency development must be examined. Pre-service training, for example, must include training on antiretroviral therapy as a component of an integrated approach to HIV and AIDS care and prevention. Universities and vocational programmes must begin immediately to train their students in these competencies so that, when they graduate in two to four years, they can join those already providing antiretroviral therapy'' (p. 9).

Other omissions are competencies related to the following issues: management and communication; activities related to mentorship and preceptorship; drug supply and management; laboratory skills; nutrition; mental health; palliative care; specific target groups, such as children, adolescents, couples, families, elderly people, and intravenous drug users; traditional medicine and traditional healers; managing long-term metabolic side-effects; ethics, equity, and human rights; and links to the larger community (family, faith-based organizations, and other groups)'' (p. 10).
