            "text": "Bovine herpesvirus-1 (BHV-1) is a major cause of respiratory tract diseases in cattle. Vaccination of cattle against BHV-1 is a high priority. A major concern of currently modified live BHV-1 vaccines is their ability to cause latent infection and subsequent reactivation resulting in many outbreaks. Thus, there is a need for alternative strategies. We generated two recombinant Newcastle disease viruses (NDVs) expressing the glycoprotein D (gD) of BHV-1 from an added gene. One recombinant, rLaSota/gDFL, expressed gD without any modification. The other recombinant, rLaSota/gDF, expressed a chimeric gD in which the ectodomain of gD was fused with the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of the NDV fusion F glycoprotein. Remarkably, the native gD expressed by rLaSota/gDFL virus was incorporated into the NDV virion 2.5-fold more efficiently than the native NDV proteins, whereas the chimeric gD was not detectably incorporated even though it was abundantly expressed on the infected cell surface. The expression of gD did not increase the virulence of the rNDV vectors in chickens. A single intranasal and intratracheal inoculation of calves with either recombinant NDV elicited mucosal and systemic antibodies specific to BHV-1, with the responses to rLaSota/gDFL being higher than those to rLaSota/gDF. Following challenge with BHV-1, calves immunized with the recombinant NDVs had lower titers and earlier clearance of challenge virus compared to the empty vector control, and reduced disease was observed with rLaSota/gDFL. Following challenge, the titers of serum antibodies specific to BHV-1 were higher in the animals immunized with the rNDV vaccines compared to the rNDV parent virus, indicating that the vaccines primed for secondary responses. Our data suggest that NDV can be used as a vaccine vector in bovines and that BHV-1 gD may be useful in mucosal vaccine against BHV-1 infection, but might require augmentation by a second dose or the inclusion of additional BHV-1 antigens.",

BHV-1 is the causative agent of respiratory infection (infectious bovine rhinotracheitis), genital infection (infectious pustular vulvovaginitis), conjunctivitis, and systemic infection leading to abortion and fetal deaths [1] . Furthermore, BHV-1 has been associated with meningo-encephalitic diseases, infectious balanoposthitis, and may predispose cattle to secondary opportunistic bacterial infections [2, 3] . Currently used vaccines against BHV-1, formulated with either inactivated or modified live virus, have a number of disadvantages. The inactivated vaccines are usually poor immunogens and may cause clinical dis-that BHV-1 gD subunit vaccines prepared using recombinant baculovirus [12] or tobacco mosaic virus [13] , or gD expressed by adenovirus vectors [14] [15] [16] [17] , provided partial protection and reduced virus shedding. However, these efforts have not been translated for practical use, due to limitations of effective delivery of vaccine antigen to the mucosal surface and incomplete protection. Therefore, there is a need to evaluate additional viral vectors to deliver BHV-1 antigens to cattle.",

Among them, Newcastle disease virus (NDV) is of particular interest as a candidate vaccine vector for delivery of foreign antigens. NDV is a member of the genus Avulavirus in the family Paramyxoviridae. The genome of NDV is a single-stranded, negative-sense RNA that contains six genes in the order 3 -NP-P-M-F-HN-L-5 and encodes eight proteins [18, 19] . NDV causes an economically important disease affecting all species of birds. The severity of disease in avian species depends on the pathotype of NDV strain and host species: lentogenic strains cause mild or asymptomatic infections that are restricted to respiratory tract; mesogenic strains are of intermediate virulence; and velogenic strains cause systemic infections with high mortality [20, 21] . Currently, lentogenic strains are widely used as live NDV vaccines for poultry throughout the world.",

NDV is antigenically distinct from common animal and human pathogens, and thus would not be affected by preexisting immunity in humans and animals. NDV can infect efficiently via the intranasal (IN) route and has been shown to induce humoral and cellular immune responses both at the mucosal and systemic levels in murine and nonhuman primate models. NDV was used to express protective antigens of simian immunodeficiency virus, respiratory syncytial virus, H5N1 avian influenza virus and human immunodeficiency virus in mice; human parainfluenza virus type 3, severe acute respiratory syndrome associated coronavirus and H5N1 avian influenza virus in monkeys [22] [23] [24] [25] [26] [27] [28] .

In the present study, we examined the widely used avirulent NDV vaccine strain LaSota as a topical respiratory vaccine vector to deliver the gD of BHV-1 as a test foreign antigen. Two different recombinant NDVs, one expressing the native gD and the other expressing a chimeric version of the gD, were constructed. These NDV vectored vaccines were evaluated for replication, pathogenicity for birds, immunogenicity and protection against BHV-1 following IN and intratracheal (IT) immunization of calves. Our results indicated that a single IN administration of recombinant NDVs expressing BHV-1 gD resulted in the induction of mucosal and systemic antibody responses against BHV-1 and provided partial protection against IN challenge with a virulent BHV-1. The NDV vectored vaccines were safe and attenuated in cattle, suggesting that NDV can be used to elicit antigen specific immune responses against other pathogens of cattle. Further our data indicated that the gD alone may not be sufficient to confer complete protection against BHV-1 challenge. Inclusion of other BHV-1 glycoproteins, namely gC and gB, along with gD may be necessary for generation of complete protection against BHV-1.",

The plasmids containing the native gD ORF and the gD ectodomain fused with NDV transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail were designated as pLaSota/gDFL and pLa-Sota/gDF, respectively. The recombinant viruses were recovered from pLaSota/gDFL and pLaSota/gDF antigenomic cDNAs following the procedure described previously [30] . The recovered recombinant viruses were designated as rLaSota/gDFL and rLaSota/gDF, respectively. The recombinant viruses were plaque purified and grown in 9-day-old embryonated SPF chicken eggs [33, 34] . The gD genes from genomic RNAs of purified viruses were amplified by RT-PCR and sequence analyzed to confirm the correct gD gene structure and absence of any adventitious mutations.",

The MDT test was performed by a standard procedure [21] . Briefly, a series of 10-fold dilutions of fresh allantoic fluid from eggs infected with the test virus were made in sterile PBS, and 0.1 ml of each dilution was inoculated into the allantoic cavity of each of five 9-day-old embryonated chicken eggs. The eggs were incubated at 37 \u2022 C and examined four times daily for 7 days. The time that each embryo was first observed dead was recorded. The highest dilution that killed all embryos was considered the minimum lethal dose. The MDT was recorded as the time (in h) for the minimum lethal dose to kill the embryos. The MDT has been used to classify NDV strains as velogenic (taking under 60 h to kill), mesogenic (taking between 60 and 90 h to kill), and lentogenic (taking more than 90 h to kill). The ICPI test was performed as described previously [21] . Briefly, fresh allantoic fluid from eggs infected with the test virus was diluted 10-fold and inoculated into groups of ten 1-day-old SPF chicks via the intracerebral route. The inoculation was done using a 27-gauge needle attached to a 1-ml stepper syringe dispenser that was set to dispense 0.05 ml of inoculum per inoculation. The birds were observed daily for 8 days, and at each observation, the birds were scored 0 if normal, 1 if sick, and 2 if dead. The ICPI value is the mean score per bird per observation. Highly virulent viruses give values approaching 2, and avirulent viruses give values approaching 0.",

The animals were cared in accordance with a protocol approved by the Animal Care and Use Committee of Thomas D. Morris Inc. Strict biosecurity measures were observed throughout the experimental period. Nine 10-12 weeks old calves were randomly divided into groups of three and immunized with rLaSota, rLaSota/gDFL or rLaSota/gDF virus. The calves were infected once with a single dose of recombinant virus (10 6 PFU/ml) by combined IN (5 ml in each nostril) and IT (10 ml) routes.

Moreover, it has been shown that replacement of the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of the foreign envelope protein with those of a NDV envelope protein increased incorporation of the foreign glycoprotein into the NDV virion [26] . Therefore, we wanted to determine whether the native and chimeric gDs were incorporated into the NDV virion. Both of the recombinant viruses were purified through sucrose gradients and the viral proteins were analyzed by Coomassie blue staining of SDS-PAGE gels. Surprisingly, it was the native gD expressed by rLaSota/gDFL, rather than the chimeric gD expressed by rLaSota/gDF, that was incorporated into the virions (Fig. 4) . Both the monomeric (71 kDa) and dimeric (140 kDa) forms of the native gD were detected by Coomassie blue staining; this incomplete dissociation of the gD homoligomer during SDS-PAGE is commonly observed. The chimeric gD expressed by rLaSota/gDF was not visible by Coomassie blue staining, indicating that either the chimeric gD was incorporated in very small amounts that were below the detection level or was not incorporated. Densitometric analysis of the gel indicated that the relative molar amount of native gD incorporated into the NDV virion was approximately 2.5-fold greater than that of the NDV HN protein.",

The mean rectal temperature of calves in all groups showed a sharp increase after three days of challenge (Fig. 7) .

The S/P ratio was calculated by subtracting the average normal control absorbance from each sample absorbance, then dividing the difference by the corrected positive control, which is the difference between average positive absorbance and average normal control absorbance. According to manufacturer's protocol, a sample was considered to be positive for BHV-1 antibodies if the S/P ratio was \u22650.3. (Table 4 ). In contrast, the animals in groups immunized with rLaSota and rLaSota/gDF maintained an increased temperature over a period of eight days (Fig. 7) .

Currently, safe and effective vaccines are not available against BHV-1. There are also many devastating cattle diseases that are foreign to the U.S., such as Foot and Mouth disease (FMD), Rinderpest, and Rift Valley fever. Live vaccines against these diseases based on attenuated forms of the pathogen are prohibitory in a disease-free country like the U.S. because of concerns about the introduction of live pathogen. Therefore, there is a need to develop alternative vaccine strategies for BHV-1 and these foreign animal diseases that do not involve attenuated versions of the pathogens. Among the possible strategies, one of the most promising is the use of live viral vectored vaccines. The major advantage of a live viral vectored vaccine is that they do not require the use of the whole infectious pathogen but can have the efficacy of a live-attenuated vaccine. NDV has several features that make it a promising viral vaccine vector. NDV grows to high titers in embryonated chicken eggs and in cell lines. In contrast to other viral vectors that encode large number of proteins, such as herpes viruses and pox viruses, NDV encodes only eight proteins; therefore, there is less competition for immune responses between vector proteins and the expressed foreign antigen. NDV replicates in the cytoplasm and does not integrate into the host cell DNA. Genetic exchange is either rare or does not occur in NDV, as with other NNSV, thus making it a stable vaccine vector. NDV can infect efficiently via the IN route and induce local IgA and systemic IgG antibody and cell-mediated immune responses. NDV vectors are available that are based on lentogenic strains that are already in widespread use as live vaccines and pose no danger to the poultry industry.",

Recently, NDV has been evaluated in non-human primates as a potential vaccine vector for human use [39, 40] . In addition, NDV has been used as an oncolytic agent against bovine papillomatosis in cattle and has been shown to be safe in repeated inoculations [38] . NDV shares only a low level of amino acid sequence identity with bovine paramyxoviruses and is antigenically distinct, suggesting that the entire bovine population would be susceptible to infection with a NDV vectored vaccine. Thus prior immunity against common bovine viruses should not affect the replication and immunogenicity of the vector. Recently, we have shown that IN and IT inoculation of calves with the lentogenic NDV strain LaSota resulted in an asymptomatic infection of the respiratory tract with induction of mucosal and systemic antibody responses against NDV [29] . Therefore, NDV is an attractive vector for bovine pathogens for which vaccines are not available or need improvement. In this study, for the first time, we have evaluated the potential of NDV as a vaccine vector for bovine use.",

The envelope of BHV-1 has three major surface glycoproteins, namely the gB, gC, and gD glycoproteins. Respiratory infection by BHV-1 requires gD for attachment and penetration of the virus into cells [44] . Monoclonal antibodies against gD prevent infection, and thus gD is an independent neutralization antigen [45, 46] .

Previous studies have also reported varying degree of protection by using adenovirus vectors [43] , BHV-1 ISCOMs [47, 48] gene-deleted live BHV-1 [49] , DNA vaccines [50] and subunit vaccines [9] . There could be various reasons for the partial protection conferred by the NDV vectored vaccines in this study. First, it is possible that repetitive doses of the recombinant gD vaccine may be required to boost sufficient mucosal and systemic anti-body responses for complete protection. Second, it has been shown that, besides gD, the gB and gC surface glycoproteins also are immunodominant antigens, and are the targets of neutralizing antibodies and are major antigens for the cellular immune response [15, [51] [52] [53] . Hence, the incomplete protection generated by vaccination with NDV vectors expressing only the gD might be overcome by simultaneously administering NDV vectors expressing the gB and gC proteins. Third, in this experiment calves were challenged with a high dose of virulent BHV-1 strain Cooper. Such high dose of infection does not occur under natural conditions. Hence, the possibility of overwhelming the immune response by the challenge virus exists.",

            "text": "This study demonstrated that large quantities of a foreign glycoprotein can be incorporated into the NDV virion without affecting vector replication and pathogenicity. The amount of native gD present in the virions of recombinant rLaSota/gDFL was 2.5 times more than that of the native HN protein. In contrast, the chimeric gD (ectodomain of gD fused with the transmembrane domain and cytoplasmic tail of NDV F protein) that was designed to be incorporated more efficiently than the native gD was not incorporated detectably. The maximum level of incorporation of foreign proteins observed in earlier studies with recombinant vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) expressing either influenza virus hemagglutinin (HA) or neuraminidase (NA) glycoprotein, the measles virus H or F protein, or the respiratory syncytial virus F protein from extra genes was up to 30% of the VSV G protein [58] [59] [60] . As other examples, the Ebola virus glycoprotein GP expressed from a human parainfluenza virus type 3 vector was incorporated into the vector particle with 13% of the efficiency of the native proteins, and the H5 avian influenza virus expressed by an NDV vector was incorporated at 23% the efficiency of the native proteins [61] . In addition, we observed that incorporation of gD did not change the molar ratio of the NDV HN and F proteins relative to the nucleocapsid and matrix proteins, and did not appear to affect the yield of particles or their infectivity. These results suggest that space is not a constraint in the incorporation of foreign proteins into envelope of NDV. At the present, we do not know the basis for the highly efficient incorporation of the gD protein in the NDV virion. One possibility is that some feature of the amino acid sequence of the transmembrane domain or cytoplasmic tail of the native BHV-1 gD makes it more efficient for inclusion in particles. Another possibility is that gD might accumulate at the cell surface in a higher molar amount compared to the NDV proteins, leading to more efficient incorporation. However, it remains unexplained why the chimeric gD protein containing the cytoplasmic and transmembrane from the NDV F protein accumulated efficiently at the cell surface yet was not significantly incorporated. One potential consequence of incorporating such high amounts of gD into the virus particles was that it might lead to an increase in virulence of the NDV vector, but this was not observed for the MDT and ICPI tests in chickens. Furthermore, the rLaSota/gDFL virus remained as restricted for replication in bovines as the LaSota empty vector and the rLaSota/gDF vaccine.",

The commonly used NDV vaccine strain LaSota was used to express the gD of BHV-1. Our results showed that calves vaccinated with the recombinant viruses elicited an immune response against the gD and provided partial protection from BHV-1 challenge. These results suggested that the gD could be a useful component of a mucosal vaccine against BHV-1 infection. These vectored vaccine candidates are highly attenuated for replication in cattle and are not shed into the environment. Furthermore, the observation that NDV has a negligible incidence of recombination with other circulating viruses in cattle population makes it a promising and safe vaccine delivery vector candidate for bovine population. This strategy may be useful for the development of live viral vectored vaccines against foreign animal diseases for which currently safe and effective vaccines are not available.",
