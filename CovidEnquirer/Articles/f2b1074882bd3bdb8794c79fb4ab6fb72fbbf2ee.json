The high number of new cases within a short period and the high case fatality rate have caused public panic and attracted global attention. It was also reported from media that some patients' families undertook large medical costs. According to the literature, exposure to live poultry could be an important risk factor for human infection with H7N9. [1] [2] [3] As a result, closing-down the live-poultry markets and slaughtering the poultry were the main intervention measures in affected areas in China. These interventions played an important role in disease prevention, but on the other hand, also caused serious losses to the poultry industry.",

It is important to estimate the overall burden of disease (BOD) due to H7N9 in China because this virus is new in humans and could cause a global pandemic in the future. The Global Burden of Disease (GBD) 2010 study presents a comprehensive methodological framework for death and disability loss estimation and has had a pronounced impact on the estimation of BOD 7 8 . In this study, we identified the main drivers of economic losses and summarized the direct and indirect costs of human H7N9 infection. We aimed to present an accurate and operable approach for estimating the overall burden of emerging infectious diseases and to provide evidence on the cost effectiveness of H7N9 prevention and control. We also aim to set up a BOD estimation example for any animal-borne infectious diseases, esp. with the introduction of modern medical device.",

To calculate the DALYs attributable to H7N9, the H7N9-specific years of life lost due to premature mortality (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs) were computed and then summed. An intensive analysis of poultry-industry losses would be complex and would require time-consuming field surveys. Meanwhile, indirect effects may lag behind. In this paper, we considered only the poultry industry losses caused from the closing of live-poultry markets and the large-scales laughter of poultry.",

Four cost drivers were extracted: cost of outpatient and inpatient examinations in ward, cost of examination in intensive-care units (ICUs), cost of treatment and other costs (including medical consumables, charge for sickbed, general care services, checkup fee, etc). A cost formula was constructed for each driver, as depicted in Table 1 . The cost per patient was estimated by experienced hospital financial officers and hospital doctors. The mean number of days (ICU stay, hospital stay and days of treatments) was estimated from the epidemiologic data. The number of patients for each driver was derived 5 from a previous publication. 6 Professionals' experiences were also considered for some items that were not included in our surveillance system.

The estimation of direct medical cost and DALY cost, especially the mean cost per patient and mean cost per day for different case categories, can be used to guide those counties in which H7N9 cases did not occur in the prevention and control of H7N9. DALY per H7N9 case (5176 DALYs per 1000 cases) was much higher than the other respiratory infectious diseases according to the 2010 GBD study. 19 A comparison to outbreaks of other infectious diseases (with similar clinical symptom) was also considered in this report. The health care cost per SARS patient in Beijing was 17,150 CNY (1,886USD) while the average medical cost per H7N9 patient was 99,691 CNY(15,951 USD) because of the higher fatality rate of H7N9 patients and more expensive modern medical device had been used. 20 As of the end of May, China's poultry industry suffered direct losses amounting to 7.75 billion CNY, including the cost of closing live-poultry markets and slaughtering poultry in the ten affected provinces. Poultry-industry losses were estimated at three levels: 27 prefectures with confirmed H7N9 cases, 10 affected provinces and eight non-affected adjacent provinces. The outbreak of H7N9 may reduce the demand for poultry products in other regions of China, due to public perceptions. These effects were not considered in this paper. The cost of closing-down the live-poultry markets and the cost of poultry slaughter were calculated as direct poultry-industry losses. We assumed that the cost per animal is 10 CNY and the date for the end of closing the live-poultry markets was May 31, 2013 because there has been only one confirmed H7N9 case since then. Losses from the live-poultry industry account for 98% of the total losses, with the lost sales of live poultry constituting the majority of that amount. Strict prevention and control measures have been enacted in Guangdong Province, which had few reported cases of H7N9. This finding will be significant for similar cases in the future.

Fourth, estimations of the direct medical cost per day might show large differences for specific cases because the drug cost could grow considerably if imported and nutritional drugs were used. We considered only the average severity for patients in ward and in ICU. Fifth, 17 patients were still in hospital by May 28, 2013 according to the literature. 23 The mean numbers of days in ward and in ICU of severe cases and fatality rate were thus underestimated. And some of the mild cases may not be reported which also resulted in the underestimation of the cost. Sixth, in this paper, we considered only direct losses from the closing-down of live-poultry markets and large-scale poultry slaughter, which could be estimated accurately and quickly. This estimation is useful for early control and decision-making; however, other losses involved in the livestock-production chain, such as increased breeding costs, poultry seeding, the prices of poultry meat and eggs and the decreasing production of poultry-feather industries, should be considered in further studies. 24",

Four cost drivers were extracted: cost of outpatient and inpatient examinations in the ward, cost of examinations in intensive-care units (ICUs), cost of treatment, and other costs (including medical consumables, charge for sickbed, general care services, checkup fee, etc.). A cost formula was constructed for each driver, as depicted in Table 1 . The cost per patient was estimated by experienced hospital financial officers and hospital doctors. The mean number of days (ICU stay, hospital stay, and days of treatment) was estimated from the epidemiological data. The number of patients for each driver was derived from a previous publication. 6 The professional's experience was also considered for some items 6 that were not included in our surveillance system.

To a large extent, the small number of patients in the H7N9 outbreak in China was due to quick and effective intervention, which prevented a pandemic. 21 The estimate of direct medical costs and DALY costs, particularly the mean cost per patient and mean cost per day for 10 different case categories, can be used to guide those counties in which no cases occurred during prevention and control of H7N9. DALY per H7N9 case (5,176 DALYs per 1,000 cases) was much higher than most of other respiratory infectious diseases though DALYs per 100,000 population (2.23 DALYs based on affected county population) were lower than most of the infectious diseases according to the 2010 GBD study. 22 A comparison to outbreaks of other infectious diseases (with similar clinical symptoms) was also considered in this report. The healthcare cost per SARS patient in Beijing was 17,150 CNY (1,886 USD), whereas the average medical cost per H7N9 patient was 125,363 CNY (20,058 USD) because of the higher fatality rate of H7N9 patients and use of more expensive modern medical devices. 23 As of the end of May, China's poultry industry suffered direct losses amounting to 7.75 billion CNY(1.24USD), including the cost of closing live poultry markets and slaughtering poultry in the ten affected provinces. Poultry-industry losses were estimated at three levels: 27 prefectures with confirmed H7N9 cases, 10 affected provinces, and 8 non-affected adjacent provinces. The outbreak of H7N9 may reduce the demand for poultry products in other regions of China due to public perception. These effects were not considered in this study. The cost of closing down the live-poultry markets and the cost of poultry slaughter were calculated as direct poultry-industry losses. We assumed that the cost per animal was 10 CNY(1.6USD) and the date for the end of closing the live-poultry markets was May 31, 2013 because there has been few confirmed H7N9 cases since then. Losses from the live-poultry industry accounted for 98% of the total losses, with the lost sales of live poultry constituting the majority of that amount. Strict prevention and control measures have been enacted in Guangdong Province, which had few reported H7N9 cases. This finding will be significant for similar cases in the future. Due to timely control measures, the effects of the outbreak were limited to 27 prefectures in 10 provinces in China.",

            "text": "Our study had several limitations. First, there were 11 confirmed H7N9 cases without death whose case categories were unknown. The cost estimate for these unknown patients was replaced by the average cost of mild and severe cases without death. Second, in the cost model, some of the data (e.g., mean number of days of extracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe without death cases) were obtained from a small proportion of investigated cases, which could result in an estimation bias. Third, the direct medical cost did not include opportunity cost, 24 the cost that is incurred because a limited resource is used to treat a preventable disease and cannot therefore be used to treat another disease. 25 The medical practitioner's salary, research funding, and loss of working time for family numbers of patients with H7N9 were excluded from our study. Fourth, estimates of direct medical costs per day might show large differences for specific cases because the drug cost could grow considerably if imported and nutritional drugs were used. We considered only the average severity for patients in the ward and ICU. Fifth, 17 patients were still in the hospital on May 28, 2013 according to the literature. 26 The mean numbers of days in the ward and ICU for severe cases and their fatality rate were thus underestimated. Some of the mild cases may not have been reported, which also resulted in underestimating the cost. Sixth, we considered only direct losses from closing down live-poultry markets and large-scale poultry slaughter, which could be estimated accurately and quickly. This estimate was useful for early control and decision-making; however, other losses involved in the livestock-production chain, such as increased breeding costs, poultry seeding, the prices of poultry meat and eggs, and the decreased production of poultry-feather industries, should be considered in further studies. 27 In conclusion, we present a rapid, operable, and accurate framework for estimating the burden of human infections from H7N9.This framework could be used in a BOD analysis of future H7N9 or similar outbreaks. The results including direct and indirect costs provide fundamental information for researchers and public and policy makers to support timely and effective interventions. Future study may focus on the cost-effectiveness analysis of poultry industry close down, earlier diagnosis and effective treatments of patients based on more detailed investigation information.",

To calculate the DALYs attributable to H7N9, the H7N9-specific years of life losst due to premature mortality (YLLs) and years lived with disability (YLDs) were computed and then summed. An intensive analysis of poultry-industry losses would be complex and would require time-consuming field surveys. Meanwhile, indirectIndirect effects may lag behind. In this paperstudy, we considered only the poultry industry losses caused from the closing of live-poultry markets and the large-scales laughterscale slaughtering of poultry.",

A cost formula was constructed for each driver, as depicted in Table 1 . The cost per patient was estimated by experienced hospital financial officers and hospital doctors. The mean number of days (ICU stay, hospital stay, and days of treatmentstreatment) was estimated from the epidemiologicepidemiological data.

These provinces have large poultry markets. Zhejiang Province had the highest number of confirmed cases; however, the losses in that region were not very high, as the sales of live poultry were lower. Strict prevention and control measures, such as daily cleaning of the market, weekly disinfection of the market, and monthly closings of the live market, were conducted in Guangdong Province, which reported no H7N9 cases till 31until May 31, 2013 during the emergency response. Meanwhile, these These prevention and control measures affected the poultry industry. For this reason, the poultry-industry losses in Guangdong Province are also given in Table 5 . 10 Due to timely control measures, the H7N9-affected regions were limited to the 27 prefectures in ten provinces in China. In this study, the potential economic risks were also calculated for the eight non-affected adjacent provinces (region 3, shadowed in Figure 3 ).

We assumed that cases of the same severity resulted in similar medical costs. Therefore, mild cases, severe cases without death, severe cases with death, and unknown cases without death were estimated separately by calculating the mean number of days, number of cases, and cost per day. The mean cost per patient was 8,880 CNY (1,421 USD) for mild cases, 144,788 CNY (23,166 USD) for severe cases without death and184, and 184, 211 CNY (29,474 USD) for severe cases with death.

To a large extent, the small number of patients in the H7N9 outbreak in China was due to quick and effective interventionsintervention, which prevented a pandemic. 21 The estimationestimate of direct medical costcosts and DALY cost, especiallycosts, particularly the mean cost per patient and mean cost per day for different case categories, can be used to guide those counties in which H7N9no cases did not occur in theoccurred during prevention and control of H7N9. DALY per H7N9 case (51765,176 DALYs per 10001,000 cases) was much higher than the most of other respiratory infectious diseases according to the 2010 GBD study though DALYs per 100,000 population (2.23 DALYs based on affected county population) were lower than most of the infectious diseases according to the 2010 GBD study. 19 22 A comparison to outbreaks of other infectious diseases (with similar clinical symptomsymptoms) was also considered in this report. The health carehealthcare cost per SARS patient in Beijing was 17,150 CNY (1,886USD) while886 USD), whereas the average medical cost per H7N9 patient was 99,691 CNY (15,951 USD) because of the higher fatality rate of H7N9 patients and use of more expensive modern medical device had been useddevices. 2023 As of the end of May, China'sChina's poultry industry suffered direct losses amounting to 7.75 billion CNY(1.24USD), including the cost of closing live-poultry markets and slaughtering poultry in the ten affected provinces. Poultry-industry losses were estimated at three levels: 27 prefectures with confirmed H7N9 cases, 10 affected provinces, and eight8 non-affected adjacent provinces. The outbreak of H7N9 may reduce the demand for poultry products in other regions of China, due to public perceptionsperception. These effects were not considered in this paperstudy. The cost of closing-down the live-poultry markets and the cost of poultry slaughter were calculated as direct poultry-industry losses. We assumed that the cost per animal iswas 10 CNY(1.6USD) and the date for the end of closing the live-poultry markets was May 31, 2013 because there has been only onefew confirmed H7N9 cases since then. Losses from the live-poultry industry accountaccounted for 98% of the total losses, with the lost sales of live poultry constituting the majority of that amount. Strict prevention and control measures have been enacted in Guangdong Province, which had few reported H7N9 cases of H7N9. This finding will be significant for similar cases in the future. Due to timely control measures, the effects of the outbreak were limited to 27 prefectures in ten10 provinces in China.",

            "text": "Our study had several limitations. First, there were 11 confirmed H7N9 cases without death whose case categories were unknown. The cost estimationestimate for these unknown patients was replaced by the average cost of mild and severe cases without death. Second, in the cost model, some of the data (e.g., mean number of days of ECMOextracorporeal membrane oxygenation for severe without death cases) were obtained from a small proportion of investigated cases, which could result in an estimation bias. Third, the direct medical cost did not include opportunity cost, 21 24 the cost that is incurred because a limited resource is used to treat a preventable disease and cannot therefore be used to treat another disease. 22 25 The medical practitioners'practitioner's salary, research funding, and loss of working time for family numbers of patients onwith H7N9 were excluded infrom our study. Fourth, estimationsestimates of the direct medical costcosts per day might show large differences for specific cases because the drug cost could grow considerably if imported and nutritional drugs were used. We considered only the average severity for patients in the ward and in ICU. Fifth, 17 patients were still in the hospital byon May 28, 2013 according to the literature. 23 26 The mean numbers of days in the ward and in ICU offor severe cases and their fatality rate were thus underestimated. And someSome of the mild cases may not behave been reported, which also resulted in the underestimation ofunderestimating the cost. Sixth, in this paper, we considered only direct losses from the closing-down of live-poultry markets and large-scale poultry slaughter, which could be estimated accurately and quickly. This estimation isestimate was useful for early control and decision-making; however, other losses involved in the livestock-production chain, such as increased breeding costs, poultry seeding, the prices of poultry meat and eggs, and the decreasingdecreased production of poultry-feather industries, should be considered in further studies. 2427 In conclusion, we presentedpresent a quickrapid, operable, and accurate framework for estimating the burden of human infections withfrom H7N9.This framework could be used in thea BOD analysis of future H7N9 or similar outbreaks. The results, including direct and indirect costs, provide fundamental information for researchers, the and public and policy makers to support timely and effective interventions. Future study may focus on the cost-effectiveness analysis of poultry industry close down, earlier diagnosis and effective treatments of patients based on more detailed investigation information. 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59 60 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46 1  2  3  4  5  6  7  8  9  10  11  12  13  14  15  16  17  18  19  20  21  22  23  24  25  26  27  28  29  30  31  32  33  34  35  36  37  38  39  40  41  42  43  44  45  46  47  48  49  50  51  52  53  54  55  56  57  58  59  60   F  o  r  p  e  e  r  r  e  v  i  e  w  o  n  l  y   Table 5 .
