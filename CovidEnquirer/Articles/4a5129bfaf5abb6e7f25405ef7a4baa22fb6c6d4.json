TGEV mRNA 6, which encodes the N protein, was observed to be the most abundant species throughout the replication cycle. The ratios of mRNA 6 to the other mRNAs were 1:0.11 (mRNA 2), 1:0.16 (mRNAs 3 and 4) and 1:0.37 (mRNA 5) at 12 h post-infection. All the mRNA species were differentially regulated throughout the replication cycle, although the rate of accumulation of mRNAs 4, 5 and 6, but not mRNA 3, increased markedly towards the end of the replication cycle, mRNA 7 was not detected in the system used. There was no observable correlation between the amounts of each mRNA synthesised and the potential degree of base pairing between the 3' end of the leader sequence and the transcription associated sequences on the genomic RNA at any time during the replication cycle. This indicates that the extent of base pairing was not the only factor involved in the control of subgenomic mRNA synthesis.",

            "text": "Transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV), a member of the genus Coronavirus, family Coronaviridae, is an enveloped virus with a single-stranded, positive-sense RNA genome, of approximately 28,000 nucleotides (nts), that is 5' capped and 3' polyadenylated. At least six virus-specific subgenomic mRNA species are produced in TGEV-infected cells and form a 3'-coterminal nested set (Jacobs et al., 1986; Wesley et al., 1989; Page et al., 1990) . Although most of the mRNAs contain more than one gene only the 5'-most gene(s) not present on the next smallest mRNA is translated. Most coronavirus genes, on the genomic RNA, are preceded by a non-translated region of varying length, the intergenic sequence (Lai, 1990) . On the negative-stranded copy of the genomic RNA these intergenic sequences may act as initiation sites for the transcription of the subgenomic mRNAs. In this paper we shall refer to the sequences involved in the synthesis of the mRNAs as the transcription associated sequences (TASs). In addition to the virus-specific mRNAs, subgenomic negative-stranded RNAs, which correspond to their respective subgenomic mRNA, have been identified in cells infected with TGEV (Sethna et al., 1989) , bovine coronavirus (BCV) (Hofmann et al., 1990 ) and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) (Sawicki and Sawicki, 1990) , and for TGEV have been shown to contain an anti-leader sequence at the 3' end and a short poly(U) sequence at the 5' end (Sethna et al., 1989 (Sethna et al., , 1991 . The role of the subgenomic negative-strand RNAs is still not understood, with some authors indicating that they play an important role in coronavirus mRNA synthesis (Sethna et al., 1989; Sawicki and Sawicki, 1990) and others that they play only a small, if any, role and are the end products of the transcription and/or replication process (Jeong and Makino, 1992) .",

This was postulated to be synthesised from a TAS, CUAAAC, proximal to the potential TGEV ORF-3b gene (Wesley et al., 1989) . The mRNA 3 of PRCV, a variant of TGEV, was observed to be smaller than the equivalent TGEV mRNA due to the loss of the original TAS, found upstream of ORF-3a in TGEV, and the creation of a new TAS, ACUAAAC, upstream of the PRCV (strains 86/137004 and 86/135308) ORF-3 gene . The ratios of the PRCV mRNAs appeared to be similar to those observed for TGEV, in which the amount of PRCV mRNA 3 was similar to the amount of TGEV mRNA 3, produced from the TAS proximal to the potential TGEV ORF-3a gene, but higher than the amount observed for the Miller mRNA 3-1. The only difference between the TAS for mRNA 3-1 of the TGEV Miller strain and that of PRCV mRNA 3 was the presence of the extra adenosine nt at the 5' end of the ACUAAAC sequence of PRCV. Interestingly the TAS of mRNA 3-1 has the same sequence, CUAAAC, as for mRNA 4, for all strains of TGEV sequenced to date, and observed to be produced in lower amounts than TGEV mRNA 3. These observations indicated that the base pairing between the TGEV TASs and the leader RNA might play some role in the control of mRNA transcription. We have investigated whether individual TGEV mRNA species were produced at specific times during the replication cycle and if there was any correlation between the extent of leader-TAS base pairing and the amounts of each mRNA produced at early, middle and late time points.",

Experiments were carried out three times. We were interested in investigating whether any of the TGEV mRNA species were preferentially synthesised at a particular time point of the replication cycle or whether they accumulated at a steadily increasing rate throughout the cycle.

Our results showed that mRNA 6 was the Hours Post Infection Hours Post Infection Fig. 2 . Analysis of the amounts of the TGEV mRNAs produced throughout the replication cycle. At hourly intervals, from 5 to 13 h p.i., TGEV-infected LLC-PK 1 cells were labelled with [3H]-uridine for 2 h, total RNA was extracted and the TGEV RNA purified by the direct hybridization method. The subgenomic mRNAs were separated by denaturing agarose gel electrophoresis, excised from the gel and the amount of radioactivity measured. The counts were corrected for the number of uridine residues in each mRNA. The results obtained for mRNAs 2, 3, 4 and 5 are shown in (A) and for mRNA 6 in (B). The points represent the mean values, n, for three experiments (n) and the bars represent the standard deviations calculated using tr n_ 1-most abundantly produced mRNA at all time points in the replication cycle. The amount, as measured from cpm/uridine residue, increased approximately threefold from 7 h (representing incorporation of label 5 to 7 h p.i.) to 12 h p.i. (representing incorporation of label 10 to 12 h p.i.) (Fig. 2B ) and the accumulation rate increased markedly after 10 h p.i. The amounts and rates of accumulation of the other subgenomic mRNAs during the 2 h labelling periods from 7 to 12 h p.i. varied depending on the species. The amount of mRNA 3 was about two-fold more than the other mRNAs (except mRNA 6) at 7 h p.i. but the amounts synthesised at the later time points only slightly increased and were observed to decrease after 12 h p.i. by about 50% (Fig. 2A) . The amounts of mRNA 2 produced between 7 and 12 h p.i. only slightly increased, though the overall increase between the two time points was 1.4-fold ( Fig. 2A) . However, it should be noted that the amount of mRNA 2 was probably overestimated at all time points because of the co-migration of some degraded genomic RNA (Fig. 1) . The rates and total amounts of mRNAs 4 and 5 produced 7 to 12 h p.i. followed a different pattern to the other mRNA species. The amounts of mRNA 4 produced increased 3.2-fold over the time period but did not appear to increase from the amount observed at 7 h p.i. until 10 h p.i., at which point the amount produced increased 1.6-fold and continued to increase until 14 h p.i. (Fig. 2A) . The amounts of mRNA 5 produced increased 6.5-fold between 7 and 12 h p.i., consisting of a 3.2-fold increase at 7 and 8 h p.i., after which the rate of production remained almost constant until 11 h p.i., when there was a 1.8-fold increase between 11 and 12 h p.i. (Fig. 2A) . No mRNA 7 was detected indicating that the amounts of this mRNA were below the levels of detection, though Northern blot analysis had detected low levels of mRNA 7 in previous studies (Jacobs et al., 1986; Page et al., 1990) . The amounts of most of the mRNA species produced after 13 h p.i. were observed to decrease, indicating that the 12/13 h p.i. time point was the end of the replication cycle. The results indicated that all the TGEV mRNA species detected in this system were synthesised throughout the replication cycle, though mRNAs 5 and 6 appeared to be preferentially synthesised after 11 and 10 h p.i., respectively, and that mRNA 4 was observed to increase at 9 h p.i. Although production of most of the mRNA species increased in amounts throughout the cycle, which may be a reflection of the increase in amounts of genomic and anti-genomic RNA, the amounts of mRNA 3 surprisingly did not reflect this increase. In addition we analysed the amounts of genomic RNA produced throughout the replication cycle. As we did not have complete sequence data for the TGEV polymerase gene, we calculated the number of uridine residues from a 1243 nt sequence of the polymerase gene that we had previously determined. The number of uridine residues formed about 33% of the total residues, a value similar to that determined for mRNA 2, indicating a total number of 9333 uridine residues for the genomic RNA assuming a genome size of 28 kb. The amounts of full-length genomic RNA in cpm/uridine residue ranged from 0.03 at 7 h, to 0.04 at 9 h and 0.05 at 12 h post infection, indicating that this was the least abundant RNA species and that the amounts produced appeared to slowly increase throughout the replication cycle. However, the amount of genomic RNA was underestimated due to isolation of degraded genomic RNA ranging in size from about 8.3 kb (mRNA 2) to full length. Allowing for this the amounts of genomic RNA synthesised were probably in the region observed for mRNA 2, as observed by Sethna et al. (1989) .",

We compared the amounts of the TGEV mRNA species, produced throughout the replication cycle, with the degree of base pairing between the TASs and the 3' end of the leader RNA sequence to determine if there was any correlation with respect to the amounts of the mRNA species produced. The comparisons indicated that there were no obvious correlations between the base pairing and the amounts of mRNA synthesised, mRNA 6, the most abundant species in TGEV-infected cells, has a base pairing of 8 nts, whereas the least abundant mRNA, mRNA 7, undetectable in this system, has a base pairing of 10 nts. mRNAs 2 and 4 were observed to be produced in similar amounts early in infection, but later mRNA 4 increased more than mRNA 2, these mRNAs having base pairings of 7 and 6 nts, respectively. However, it could be argued that because mRNA 2 is twice the length of mRNA 4 that it would be expected to be produced in lower amounts, as observed for MHV.",

Analysis of the sequences preceding the TGEV genes indicated that there might be a correlation in the number of nts involved in base pairing between the 3' end of the leader RNA sequence and the TASs. However, it was also possible that some mRNA species were produced preferentially at different times of the virus replication cycle and that the analysis of the RNA at a late time point might have given a false impression of the amounts of the mRNAs. Thus a reproducible and efficient purification method allowing the accurate analysis of the amounts of the TGEV subgenomic mRNAs produced throughout the replication cycle was required.",

Previous attempts at the isolation of TGEV mRNAs using either poly-dT or oligo-dU column chromatography resulted in contamination with 28S and 18S ribosomal RNA potentially affecting their migration. Isolation of mRNA using oligo-dT or -dU chromatography required multiple purification steps to reduce the amounts of contaminating RNAs with resulting loss of mRNA. Multiple purification steps resulted in the purification of smaller mRNAs and the loss of the larger species during the washing steps (Ekenberg et al., 1992) . The previous isolation methods also resulted in differential background levels of radioactivity, possibly resulting from incorporation of label into cellular RNA, incomplete TGEV RNA transcripts or from the breakdown of TGEV RNA and resulted in inaccuracies for quantitative determination.",

The results indicated that no particular mRNA species was produced for only part of the replication cycle. However, the amounts of some mRNA species increased significantly at various time points and led to the conclusion that there is some temporal control mechanism(s) regulating the production of the mRNAs. It was possible that mRNA 7 had been previously detected in low amounts at 10-14 h p.i. because it had been preferentially produced only early in infection, with subsequent degradation of the RNA. However, there was no evidence from our study to support this, unless mRNA 7 had been produced before 5 h p.i. and was then rapidly degraded. Surprisingly the data indicated that although mRNA 4 was initially produced in low amounts, similar to the levels observed for mRNA 2, the amount increased approximately two-fold later in the replication cycle.",

In theory, the smaller a particular mRNA, the more product could be produced if the activity of the transcriptase is equivalent for each mRNA. The observation that some mRNAs are produced in different amounts and even produced in differential amounts during the replication cycle implies that there is some control over transcription. If the leader RNA recognises the TAS sequences via complementarity, the simplest control mechanism may result from different numbers of nts involved in base pairing between the leader RNA and the TAS. Analysis of the TGEV TASs identified different degrees of base pairing (Table 1) , However, their comparison with the amounts of the mRNA species produced did not reveal any particular pattern.",

            "text": "If base pairing is not responsible or is only partially involved in the control of transcription, other control mechanisms have to be taken into account, e.g. the distance between the mRNA TAS and the initiation codon of the gene product (Table 1) . Budzilowicz et al. (1985) hypothesized that the distance between the MHV TASs and the initiation codon of the gene product may also influence transcriptional regulation. The amount of a particular mRNA may be related to the amount or nature of the gene product, implying that the gene products could have negative or positive control over mRNA synthesis. For example, the most abundant coronavirus mRNA encodes the N protein, and in most cases, except for the TGEV group of coronaviruses, is the smallest mRNA produced. The protein is probably required throughout the replication cycle, to protect newly synthesized RNAs from degradation (Compton et al., 1987) and in the assembly of nucleocapsids with an additional increase in synthesis towards the end of the replication cycle to provide enough N protein for incorporation into progeny virus. In contrast, some of the least abundant coronavirus mRNAs potentially encode products that are produced in only small amounts. For example the gene product of TGEV mRNA 4, sM, has been detected on the cell surface at a late stage during the replication cycle with only 40 molecules per virion (Godet et al., 1992) . This observation indicated that sM might only be required in small amounts late in the replication cycle consistent with the observed increase in synthesis of mRNA 4 after 9 h p.i. Interestingly the synthesis of mRNA 5 also increased late in the replication cycle and may be associated with the requirement of the M protein for incorporation into virions and for initiating budding of the nucleocapsids in the morphogenesis of the virus particles. Other control mechanisms may involve the degree of secondary structure, on the negative strand, around the TAS, which might control the availability of the TAS for interaction with the leader RNA and be involved in controlling the transcription. The observation that coronaviruses also produce negative copies of the mRNA species and that these have anti-leader sequences may imply that mRNAs may also be synthesised from the negative copies, either by leader-primed transcription or direct replication. The amounts of mRNA produced may then be regulated by the availability and/or amounts of the negative copies. Van der Most et al. (1994) indicated that the transcriptase complex might be able to recognise sequences upstream of the coronavirus genes without the involvement of base pairing implying that specific protein/nucleic acid interactions can take place and may control transcription.",
