In humans, coronaviruses are a leading upper respiratory tract pathogen (Hovi et al., 1979) and are associated with gastroenteritis (Resta et al., 1985) but have never been proven to cause serious human illness . However, two reports, one describing the isolation of coronavirus from the brains of two multiple sclerosis (MS) patients (Burks et al., 1980) and the other the electron microscopic observation of a coronavirus in an MS brain perivascular immunocyte (Tanaka et al., 1976) , suggest that there may be an association between coronaviruses and human demyelinating disease . There have been no subsequent reports supporting this link between coronaviruses and human demyelination . However, data showing that these viruses produce demyelination (Bailey et al., 1949 ; Pappenheimer, 1958 ; Weiner, 1973 ; Herndon et al., 1975 ; Lucas et al., 1977 ; Nagashima et al., 1978 ; Sorensen at al ., 1980 ; Lavi et al., 1984) and stimulate T-cell mediated autoimmune reactions against CNS antigens in rodents (Stohlman and Weiner, 1981 ; Watanabe et al., 1983 ; Kyuwa et al., 1991) suggest that the question concerning the link between coronaviruses and neurologic disease in humans is open .",

In 1956 a report from the German literature stated that intracerebral (IC) inoculation of a 10% homogenate of a mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) JHM-infected mouse brain into Macaca mulatto (rhesus) or Macaca fascicularis (cynomolgus) monkeys produced an acute panencephalitis (Kersting and Pette, 1956) . However, proper analysis to definitively associate JHM with the ensuing encephalomyelitis as opposed to a system contaminate or autoimmune reaction toward inoculated brain antigens was not performed . Additionally, Pappenheimer (1958) commented that several M. mulatta monkeys that had been inoculated intracerebrally with 1HM by Bailey etal. (1949) , as described in their original report of JHM-induced neuropathology in rodents, were negative for disease . As such, the role of coronaviruses in subhuman primate or human CNS disease remains uncertain .",

RNAs were electrophoresed on a 1% glyoxal agarose gel then transferred to Zeta-Probe membranes (Bio-Rad) . Blots were probed with a 32 P random primer labeled, gel-purified insert from cDNA clone G344 . Hybridization and washing conditions were as recommended bythe manufacturer of the membrane . PCR detection of coronavirus in brain . Total RNA extracted from tissues was reversed transcribed using the following reaction conditions . One microgram of RNA was mixed with 100 pmole of random hexamers (Boehringer-Mannheim) in a total volume of 15 \u00b5l, heated at 65\u00b0 for 5 min, then cooled to room temperature . Ten microliters of a enzyme/buffer/dNTP mix was added to the RNA/primer tube and the reaction was incubated at 43\u00b0 for 1 hr . The final reverse transcriptase reaction conditions were 40 ug/ml RNA, 4 AM random hexamers, 50 mM Tris, pH 8 .3, 100 mM KCI, 10 mM MgCl 2 , 4 mM DTT, 1 unit/\u00b5l RNasin (Promega), 1 mM dNTPs, and 5 units of AMV reverse transcriptase (LifeSciences, Inc .) . Reactions were heated at 97\u00b0 for 5 min and then stored at -20\u00b0. PCR reaction conditions were as follows . Tubes containing 85 ul of buffer, primers, enzyme, and approximately 100 \u00b5l of mineral oil were heated to 80\u00b0 in the Perkin-Elmer Thermocycler . Five microliters of the cDNA from the reaction described above was mixed with 10 \u00b5I of 2 mM dNTPs in a separate tube and this was then added through the oil into the PCR reaction tube . The final reaction conditions were : 10 mM Tris, pH 8 .8, 50 mM KCI, 1 .5 mM MgCl2 , 0 .2 mM dNTP, 0 .1 % Triton X-100, 0 .5 AM of each primer, and 5 units of Taq polymerase (Promega) . The temperature profile for the reactions was as follows : 95\u00b0/1 min, 58\u00b0/1 .5 min, 72\u00b0/3 min for 3 cycles then 95\u00b0/1 min, 62\u00b0/1 min, 72\u00b0/2 min for 36 cycles followed by incubation at 72\u00b0 for 7 min . The sequences of the PCR primers, CVP3 (5'IIAAATTGCTIITCTTGTT-CTGGC ; I = inosine) and CVP4 (5'CCAAAATTCTGAT-TAGGGCCTCTC), used for these reactions were based on the published sequences of the nucleocapsid genes of MHV A59 and human coronavirus (HCV) OC43 (Armstrong et al., 1983 ; Kamahora et al., 1989) . Inosine residues were inserted into CVP3 due to the lack of sequence identity between MHV and OC43 at these four positions ; base pairing between inosine and adenosine or cytosine allows this primer to have only two mismatches whether annealed to MHV or OC43 target sequences . PCR amplification with CVP3 and CVP4 will produce a 186-bp product from either MHV A59/JHM-or HCV OC43-derived cDNA . These primers span a region extending from nucleotide 858 to 1043 or 784 to 969 for M HV A59 or HCV OC43, respectively . The PCR reaction products were analyzed by gel electrophoresis and Southern blot hybridization using Nytran membranes (Schleicher and Scheull) . Hybridization (performed at 55\u00b0) and washing conditions were as recommended by the manufacturer . The 32 P-5'labeled probe used for hybridization, CVPP, has the sequence 5'AAGCAIAITGCCAAAIAAGTCAGICAGAAA-AlIII .",

As with other families of viruses, coronaviruses have been divided into 278 MURRAY ET AL . (Deregt et al., 1987) , porcine coronavirus hemagglutinating encephalomyelitis virus (HEV) infection of a canine (MDCK) cell line (Schultze etat, 1990) , canine coronavirus (CCV) infection of a fetal cat cell line (Shockley et al ., 1987) , and human coronavirus OC43 infection of primary cultures of mouse neural cells (Pearson and Mims, 1985) are some examples of in vitro cross-species infection . Although these results demonstrate that some coronaviruses can infect cell types of a species different from the natural host and while there are examples of natural cross-species infection in other virus families, very little is known about coronavirus species specificity as it relates to natural hosts . The data shown here suggest that the species infectivity barriers for some coronaviruses may not be as strict as once thought . Despite this question of species specificity, there are similarities between infection of primates, as described here, and infection of rodent CNS . First, passage of MHV JHM in primate CNS resulted in isolation of virus, JHM-OMpl, that produced a more severe disease in a shorter time period when compared to the original virus inoculum . This suggests changes in virulence and/or CNS cell tropism in this primate brain isolate . Passage of MHV JHM and related coronaviruses in rodent brain also yields virus populations with altered disease spectrums and is thought to be attributable to mutations in specific viral genes, most notably the spike glycoprotein (Taguchi et al ., 1986 ; Makino et at, 1987 ; Morris et al., 1989) . We are now analyzing various regions of the JHM-OMpl genome in an at- CORONAVIRUS INFECTION OF PRIMATE CNS 279 tempt to determine what mutations may be responsible for this isolate's altered virulence . Second, viral RNA was demonstrable in some infected primates without production of detectable antigen (see Table 1 , AGMs K162, K161, and K209 and OM K184) . Perhaps this was due to sampling error or to limits of the antigen detection method but in situ hybridization analysis during the chronic phase of MHVA59 or JHM murine CNS infection reveals cells that contain viral genome at a time when viral antigen expression is not detected (Mendelman et at, 1983 ; Lavi et al., 1984 ; Sorensen et at, 1985) . Third, virus replication, dissemination and accompanying pathology was evident in the infected primates and yet infectious virus could only be isolated from one animal that had received the tissue culture passed virus . This type of nonproductive infection, i .e ., lack of recoverable infectious virus, and disease has been observed in mice during the chronic phase of infection that were inoculated with MHV A59 and JHM and related viruses (Stohlman and Weiner, 1981 ; Mendelman et al., 1983 ; Lavi et at, 1984) . However, a thorough time course study needs to be done with the primates to define the relationship between production of infectious virus and progression of disease . Fourth, coronavirus SD RNA could be detected by in situ hybridization in cells of the arachnoid meninges, choroid plexus in addition to cells of the white matter . This is similar to MHV3 infection in mice since virus can also be found in these diverse cell types (Tardieu et al., 1986) . These sites of infection indicate a possible CSF route for CNS dissemination of virus . These similarities between primate CNS infection and the rodent system suggest that the mechanisms for virus replication, dissemination, and pathogenesis are not species dependent-Surprisingly, the viruses used in this study had been maintained in murine cells and did not require special adaptation to primate systems prior to infection . This fact, and the demonstration in this study that CNS infection was observed in outbred new and old world primates, implies that CNS susceptibility to coronavirus infection is genetically conserved among primates and between rodents and primates . Since a primary determinant of virus infectivity for a particular cell type is at the level of virus entry into that cell the data in this report imply that at least primate and rodent CNS cell populations share a conserved receptor or mechanism for virus entry . This is consistent with our unpublished data showing that dissociated human brain cells and the human astrocytoma cell line STTG (Barna et al., 1985) have binding receptors for coronavirus SD and MHV A59 . It should be mentioned at this point that both viruses used in this study were not tested for either hemagglutinating or esterase activity or expression of the hemagglutinin-esterase glycoprotein . In light of recent data that show that this virion polypeptide may be a determinant that influences infectivity and/or pathogenicity of coronaviruses, this will be an important question to address as it relates to the primate CNS disease described here . It will be interesting to determine the susceptibility of primate CNS to other coronaviruses in order to define any relationship between infection and expressed virion proteins .",

Our unpublished data show a 97% se-quence identity in the 3' end of the genome between SD and MHV JHM in agreement with these earlier reports . These data indicate that the putative MS viruses may represent contaminants derived from the murine system used for their isolation or perhaps that they are recombinants derived from human and murine coronaviruses .
