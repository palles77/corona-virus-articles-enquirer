In the event of a major health crisis, the responses of a regional clinical laboratory can be central to the ability of civic authorities and healthcare systems to handle such emergencies. This report describes successful steps taken by a hospital-based regional reference laboratory in response to a 7.5\u00d7 increase in respiratory virus testing during the fi rst 3 weeks (April 27- May 15, 2009 ) of an outbreak of a novel infl uenza A (H1N1), now referred to as infl uenza A pandemic (H1N1) 2009, in the greater New York City metropolitan area.",

The NSLIJHS Central Laboratories serve 15 hospitals and affi liated regional physician practices; virus testing is performed at the Centralized Laboratories in the Clinical Virology Laboratory (CVL). In the aftermath of the anthrax event of September 2001, NSLIJHS developed an extensive system-wide emergency preparedness plan to deal with potential biothreat and bioterrorism events that could greatly affect a health system. This plan was tested, beginning Friday evening, April 24, 2009, when 20 students 14-17 years of age with symptoms of an infl uenza-like illness sought evaluation at the pediatric emergency room of Schneider Children's Hospital at Long Island Jewish Medical Center, one of the hospitals served by NSLIJHS. The students were among those attending a preparatory school in Queens, New York, who began experiencing infl uenza-like symptoms April 22-23, 2009 (1). Some students had recently traveled to Mexico, raising immediate concern about pandemic (H1N1) 2009 (2) . The following day, Saturday, April 25, an additional 67 persons 11-18 years of age and 16 children <8 years of age were evaluated in NSLIJHS emergency rooms. Over the next 3 days, infl uenza-related cases at NSLIJHS emergency rooms increased rapidly. ",

On April 27, despite full staffi ng, considerable overtime was required to perform testing. On April 28, a command meeting was held at the NSLIJHS central laboratories to delineate an action plan to respond to the crisis. The major issues were staffi ng, testing algorithms, laboratory space, laboratory information systems and biostatistical reporting, leadership roles, and client service functions. The action plan was immediately authorized by system leadership. A key consequence of the plan was immediate deployment of an enhanced and diversifi ed work force, including nonlicensed support staff, licensed research staff, laboratory information services personnel, and biostatistical reporting staff. Beginning April 28, these actions enabled CVL to expand its weekday working hours from 6:00 AM-6:00 PM to 5:00 AM-1:00 AM and its weekend working hours from 8:00 AM-4:00 PM to 6:00 AM-10:00 PM. With this personnel strategy, CVL was able to report DFA assay and R-Mix culture results on a real-time basis throughout the crisis. To accommodate the high volume of R-Mix cultures, CVL reduced the normal test algorithm of screening at 24 hours, 48 hours, and 7 days to a single screening and confi rmatory testing at 48 hours. Under these unusual circumstances, this change was considered acceptable as historic laboratory data had demonstrated that 97%-98% of all respiratory viruses are detected in 48 hours.",
