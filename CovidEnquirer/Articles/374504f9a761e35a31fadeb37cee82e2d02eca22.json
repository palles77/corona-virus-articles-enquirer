            "text": "Cephalotaxus alkaloids represent a family of plant secondary metabolites known for 60 years. Significant activity against leukemia in mice was demonstrated for extracts of Cephalotaxus. Cephalotaxine (CET) (1), the major alkaloid of this series was isolated from Cephalotaxus drupacea species by Paudler in 1963. The subsequent discovery of promising antitumor activity among new Cephalotaxus derivatives reported by Chinese, Japanese, and American teams triggered extensive structure elucidation and biological studies in this family. The structural feature of this cephalotaxane family relies mainly on its tetracyclic alkaloid backbone, which comprises an azaspiranic 1-azaspiro[4.4]nonane unit (rings C and D) and a benzazepine ring system (rings A and B), which is linked by its C3 alcohol function to a chiral oxygenated side chain by a carboxylic function alpha to a tetrasubstituted carbon center. The botanical distribution of these alkaloids is limited to the Cephalotaxus genus (Cephalotaxaceae). The scope of biological activities of the Cephalotaxus alkaloids is mainly centered on the antileukemic activity of 206 Jo\u00eblle P\u00e9rard-Viret et al. homoharringtonine (HHT) ( 2), which in particular demonstrated marked benefits in the treatment of orphan myeloid leukemia and was approved as soon as 2009 by European Medicine Agency and by US Food and Drug Administration in 2012. Its exact mechanism of action was partly elucidated and it was early recognized that HHT (2) inhibited protein synthesis at the level of the ribosome machinery. Interestingly, after a latency period of two decades, the topic of Cephalotaxus alkaloids reemerged as a prolific source of new natural structures. To date, more than 70 compounds have been identified and characterized. Synthetic studies also regained attention during the past two decades, and numerous methodologies were developed to access the first semisynthetic HHT (2) of high purity suitable for clinical studies, and then high grade enantiomerically pure CET (1), HHT (2), and analogs.

Because they usually exist under the form of unique enantiomer, we numbered the natural products by an arabical digit irrespective to their optical rotation sign, e.g., cephalotaxine (CET) (1) , their antipode by ent-digit, e.g., ent-cephalotaxine ent- (1) , and the corresponding racemic compound usually obtained by chemical synthesis rac-digit, e.g., rac-cephalotaxine rac- (1) . In the asymmetric synthesis section, we have precised the sign of the optical rotation, e.g., CET (\u00c0)-(1), ent-CET (\u00fe)- (1) , and rac-CET (AE)- (1) .",

            "text": "For more than 50 years, chemists have studied the extraction, structure determination, biogenesis, and synthesis of CET (1) (Fig. 2) , the major alkaloid of this series, and related alkaloids, because of the reported biological activity of its natural esters 2e5, in view of their therapeutical use in the treatment of leukemia. Homoharringtonine (HHT) (2) and harringtonine (HT) (3), or a mixture of both, have been used in traditional Chinese medicine (TCM) since the 1970s to treat a variety of malignancies. HHT (2) being the easiest to purify and the most abundant in the plant was selected by the National Cancer Institute (NCI) for clinical development. HHT (2) , also known as omacetaxine, a simple ester of CET (1), probably holds the record for the longest time to reach the market 20 after having experienced increasing interest since its first use in TCM, and efforts by pharmaceutical companies for its development as an antileukemic agent. Despite its clinical efficacy, natural HHT (2) was not recorded until now, simply because normal extract formulations have raised several unresolved problems, such as the reproduction of a constant product from defined extraction procedure, the purity profile, the main source of the raw material in China, and biodiversity conservation issues. The Cephalotaxus shrubs with extremely slow growth are mostly protected and endangered species. Moreover, CET (1) and its active esters are present in small quantities in the plant (roots, bark, heartwood, and leaves), which hardly makes possible to exploit it to obtain HHT (2) or its related esters. Semisynthetic HHT (ssHHT) (2) (Myelostat, Ceflatonin, or Omacetaxine mepesuccinate (OM)) is manufactured by a semisynthetic process developed by Robin from naturally occurring alkaloid CET (\u00c0)-(1) extracted from the dry leaves of Cephalotaxus harringtonia, and a synthetic precursor side chain. 21 Although HHT (2) was investigated for the treatment of chronic myeloid leukemia (CML) in the 1990s with good results, the advent of Imatinib (IM) mesylate, a breakpoint cluster region and Abelson (BCR-ABL)1 tyrosine kinase inhibitor (TKI) at that time delayed the interest for HHT (2) . However, de novo or acquired resistance to TKIs 22 renewed the interest for this alternative first-in-class simple natural ester of CET (1) . HHT (2) is currently approved in Europe and in the United States, due to its reported activity in patients with CML resistant to currently available TKIs. As a result, on September 2, 2004, orphan designation (EU/3/04/224) was granted by the European Union for OM (International nonproprietary name (INN), trade name Synribo)/HHT (2) for the treatment of CML to Stragen France SAS, France, for the treatment of CML. Exploitation rights were transferred to ChemGenex Europe SAS, France, in January 2009 and subsequently to Teva Pharma GmbH, Germany, in December 2012. Due to their different mechanisms of action, combinations with TKIs represent attractive treatment options. Recently, on October 26, 2012, HHT (2), Synribo (formerly Ceflatonin, Omapro), received an accelerated approval by the US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) for adult patients with chronic-phase (CP) or accelerated-phase (AP) CML with resistance or intolerance to two or more TKIs. The US FDA has granted full approval to HHT (2) (drug substance INN OM, Synribo) for injection, based on the final analysis of two phase II trials evaluating the efficacy and tolerability data of omacetaxine in 2014. This renewed interest for isolation, characterization, biological evaluation, and total synthesis of cephalotaxus alkaloids and analogs to suppress the dependance on natural source supply. cephalotaxane skeleton with either one or two units covalently linked forming dimers having two identical or different units (Fig. 3) . Cephalotaxanes (6) include neutral compounds or salts having this basic skeleton in common and may contain various oxygenated substituents (aliphatic ethers or aromatic units, free or esterified alcohols, substituted or free enols, phenol, and others). Cephalotaxanes include CETs characterized by a free alcohol function on ring D (R \u00bc H), and HTs where the 3-OH group is esterified (R s H). Isolation of cephalotaxanes and homoerythrinane alkaloids [skeleton (7) ] from the same plant suggested that they might be formed through similar biogenetic routes. 1,2 Hainanensine (8) is a structurally unique Cephalotaxus alkaloid devoid of optical activity and lacking the spiranic tetrasubstituted carbon center. It was isolated from Cephalotaxus hainanensis and C. fortunei (Fig. 3) and displays a type of single rearranged CET skeleton. 28 Figure 3 Cephalotaxanes (6), the skeleton (7) of minor homoerythrinane alkaloids, and the structurally unique Cephalotaxus alkaloid hainanensine (8) .",

Koch var. harringtonia cv. fastigiata, was determined by semisynthesis from CET (1) via oxidation to cephalotaxinone (10) and cleavage of the enol ether thus confirming desmethyl CET (12) as a natural metabolite and biosynthetic intermediate. 33 Repeated chromatography of an alkaloidal fraction of the ethanolic extract of Cephalotaxus fortunei Hook f. 34 afforded as minor component (\u00fe)-4-hydroxycephalotaxine (\u00fe)- (15) recently also identified in Cephalotaxus koreana Nakai. 35 Epicephalotaxine (9) is another minor metabolite of C. fortunei Hook f. accompanied by CET (1) (50%e54% of the total alkaloids), cephalotaxinone (10) , (\u00fe)-acetylCET (\u00fe)- (26) , demethylCET (11) , HT (3), and HHT (2) . 36 Molecules coupled with side chains bearing an ester function as in nordeoxyharringtonine (nordeoxyHT) (21) , homodeoxyharringtonine (homodeoxyHT or deoxyHHT) (22) , and bishomodeoxyharringtonine (bishomodeoxyHT) (23) are found among HTs (Fig. 5) . 37 Including esters 2e5, these compounds are esters of CET (1) having its polycyclic core coupled to different side chains deriving from (R)-citramalic acid. Although occurrence of enantiomeric pairs in the same family of plants is unusual, 38 acetylcephalotaxine (acetylCET) (26) was reported under both enantiomeric forms. (\u00c0)-AcetylCET (\u00c0)- (26) was obtained by semisynthesis through acetylation of natural CET (\u00c0)-(1) 24 and was isolated from C. fortunei 30 and C. wilsoniana. 39 , 40 The opposite enantiomer (\u00fe)-acetylCET (\u00fe)- (26) was isolated in C. fortunei 41 and C. hainanensis. 42 Although an error cannot be excluded in literature data, these findings need to be confirmed since this natural Cephalotaxus Alkaloids product (\u00fe)-26 is the only one portraiting an opposite absolute configuration (AC) of alkaloid core.",

There are also molecules coupled with side chains carrying a free acid group (Fig. 5) : 5 0 -des-O-methylHT (30) (harringtonic acid), (2 0 R,3 0 S)-3 0 -hydroxy-5 0 -des-O-methylHT (28) (cephalozemic acid C), 5'-des-O-methylHHT (31) (homoharringtonic acid, also identified as a metabolite of HHT (2) in rats and rabbits) and 5 0 -des-O-methylisoHT (27) (isoharringtonic acid). 1, 2 Others possess an ester function and an aromatic ring, as in homoneoHT (24) and (2 0 R,3 0 S)-hydroxyneoHT (25) . 44 Some of these esters deliver biological activities comparable to those of the first four isolated esters 2e5, but they are available in much lower quantities in the plant. The first dimeric Cephalotaxus alkaloid, cephalotaxidine (37) , was isolated from C. harringtonia var. drupacea (C. drupacea) in 1996. 45 It is a dimer of HHT (2) and homoharringtonamide (32) with an IC 50 of 1.8 mg/mL against P-388 murine leukemic cell lines. Drupangtonine (33) 46 was the most active (IC 50 7 nM against P-388 murine leukemic cell lines) of the four esters of oxygenated CET analogs, 11a-hydroxy-homodeoxyHT (34) , 11b-hydroxyhomodeoxyHT (35) , and 11b-hydroxydeoxyHT (36) (IC 50 0.38, 0.33, and 0.17 mg/mL, respectively, against P-388 murine leukemic cell lines) identified from C. harringtonia var. drupacea (Fig. 6) . 47 Since the last reviews in this series, 1,2 more than 30 Cephalotaxus alkaloids have been isolated from various Cephalotaxus sp. These new alkaloids include the following compounds. ",

ACs of cephalezomines G (42) and H (43) described by Kobayashi and Morita 50 from the leaves of Cephalotaxus harringtonia var. harringtonia were determined by circular dichroism (CD) as 2S,3R for cephalezomine G (42) and 2R,3R for cephalezomine H (43) . However, the structure of cephalezomine H (43) , initially assigned as a trans diol was revised to a syn-b,b-diol after total synthesis (Fig. 7) . 51 Some uncertainty remained, however, due to the divergent optical rotations of the synthetic and the natural compounds.",

While this correlation seems doubtful, since only one stereogenic carbon center is present in structures 12 and 44, these findings imply that the second stereogenic center is the nitrogen atom that lost its fast inversion properties, as observed in the X-ray studies showing the rigid structure of CET (1) . 53 Compound 44 showed no cytotoxic activity against the Hep G2, MCF-7, Hep 3B, and HT-29 human cancer cell lines.",

Cephalancetine D (47) is a dimer consisting of drupacine (16) linked at C8 to C7 (C26) of cephalotaxinamide (18) . Cephalancetine C (48) was identical to the saponification product of bis-cephalezomines (see Fig. 12 ) with LiOH. 55 All these isolated alkaloids were tested for their cytotoxicities against four human tumor cell lines, A549, HCT116, SK-BR-3, and HepG2 that evidenced that HT (3) and HHT (2) can strongly inhibit the proliferation of these human tumor cell lines as well, however with limited potency against SK-BR-3 cells (Table 3) . 54 HT (3) showed remarkable cytotoxicity against A549, HCT116, and HepG2 cell lines with IC 50 values of 0.15, 0.054, and 0.38 mg/mL, respectively. HHT (2) also exhibited potent cytotoxicity against A549, HCT116, and HepG2 cell lines with IC 50 values of 0.085, 0.001 and 0.087 mg/mL, respectively, 85 times stronger than that of doxorubicin (DOX) against HCT116 cell line. Comparing the relationship between the structures with their cytotoxicities, the ester side chains at C3 of the CET skeleton seem to play the most prominent role in the cytotoxic activity of these alkaloids.",

This plant is the best natural source for these four compounds of pharmacological interest. At present, the plants of the genus Cephalotaxus are endangered species and face the threat of extinction. Only the renewable parts of the plant are used for the extraction of alkaloids. For example, the use of modern methods of extraction provides up to 2 kg of pure CET (1) from a ton of dry leaves, that is 0.2% of dry matter. Robin et al. studied a method of preparation of HHT (2) by semisynthesis from natural CET (1) by attachment of the side chain (see Section 3). Purification provided a product, the purity of which was 99.8% against 98.5% for NCI products and 95%e97% for products of Chinese origin (Table 7) . 63 For example, 550 g of HHT (2) was injected into a preparative high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) system (diameter 45 cm, height 1 m containing 48 kg of ODS stationary phase). The elution was performed using a gradient of buffered solution of pH 3 methanol-water as mobile phase (flow rate 540 L/h, 1200 psi). The collected fractions (20e50 L) were separated by UV detection and analyzed by HPLC. After eliminating fractions with about 0.5% of the total content of HHT (2), fractions suitable for drug specification (purity > 99.8%) were combined. HPLC analysis of the organic phase after HHT recovery (basified to pH 8.5 and extracted with dichloromethane) showed a level of impurities less than 0.5%. HHT (2) (210 g) was then recrystallized by dissolution in 240 mL of methanol at 30 C and filtered at 0.25 microns for sterilization, and then deionized water (2.4 L) was added and methanol was distilled off. The aqueous solution of HHT (2) DS (quality \"drug substance\") or \"drug substance\" quality (DS) was held in a decontaminated rotary evaporator until the appearance of white crystals of pure HHT (2) . After filtration and drying under vacuum at 60 C for 2 days, 88% overall yield (OY) of HHT (2) was obtained when compared to its potential content in the semisynthetic gross HHT (2) . This corresponds to a clinical batch allowing for the preparation of 40,000 therapeutic dosage units containing 5 mg containing less than 0.03% of impurities. 63 Numerous methods were described for the extraction and purification of CET (1), its natural esters, and related analogs. Extraction of fruits, leaves, or branches of C. sinensis with 90% ethanol under refluxing conditions followed by acid base treatment and purification on alumina allowed for the isolation of CET (1) and HHT (2) . 64 High speed countercurrent chromatography, a form of liquideliquid partition chromatography in which the stationary liquid phase is retained in the apparatus without the use of a solid support, was performed with a pH gradient elution to shorten the duration of the separation and improve resolution, allowing a very efficient separation of crude alkaloid extract (800 mg) from C. fortunei to yield drupacine (16) (9.3 mg), wilsonine (15.9 mg), CET (1) (130.4 mg), epi-wilsonine (64.8 mg), fortuneine (12.8 mg) , and acetylCET (26) 65 The recovery of each alkaloid was greater than 90%. The extraction step plays an important role in the overall purification process of HHT (2) . Traditional methods of isolation and purification of the chemical constituents of plant tissues have some disadvantages. These approaches require very long extraction times and usually a large amount of solvent with sometimes low efficiency. Furthermore, many natural products are thermally unstable and may degrade during hot extraction. To overcome these drawbacks, a new method of extracting HHT (2) from Cephalotaxus koreana using microwave extraction (MWE) was developed by Kim et al. 66 The MWE process of HHT (2) recovery (biomass/MeOH 1/6 m/v, 250 rpm) gave a performance of the first biomass extraction 25% higher than the conventional solvent extraction (CSE) method for which at least four extractions were required. It was possible to recover more than 99% of HHT (2) extracting once the biomass by MWE at 40 C for 15 min or 50 C for 5 min. Because the content of tars and waxy compounds were also increased, an adsorbent was added to the biomass (1/1.5 m/m) during the MWE extraction. The use of the MWE process for the extraction of HHT (2) when compared to a CSE one has many advantages such as shorter extraction time, reduced amount of solvent, and higher yield resulting in a less costly production system for a superior product. Ultrasonic-MWE of C. fortunei produced CET (1) in a simple, highly efficient, and low cost process, suitable for its industrial production in high purity after two recrystallizations from anhydrous ethanol. 67 Using a prepurification method with adsorption prior chromatography, HHT (2) with over 52% purity can be obtained simply from C. koreana biomass in good yield, minimizing the use of solvents, scale, and complexity of operations for the final HPLC purification of HHT (2) ( Table 6) . 68 This process allows increasing the purity of the raw HHT (2) from 0.5% to over 52% with three simple steps and inexpensive pretreatment of the MeOH extract.",

The crude base (24.5 g) containing 71% of CET (1) was dissolved in a mobile phase consisting of ortho-phosphoric acid and deionized water containing 1.55% triethylamine (pH 3). The acid additive constrained the alkalization of the obtained aqueous phase and its extraction with dichloromethane. CET (1) (18 g) was fully recovered from the crude alkaloid extract as a white solid with an HPLC purity greater than 95%. The limited supply of promising secondary metabolites from their natural sources is a major hurdle to their pharmaceutical development; however, strategies to overcome this problem were developed. For instance, to increase the yield of natural anticancer drug alkaloids from natural sources, methods of extraction are developed. Recovering CET (1) from C. harringtonia, var. fastigiata with vegetable oil in the presence of an aqueous carbonate aqueous phase yielded 5% CET (1) with a purity of 26%. 70 The extraction performed with a mixture of scCO 2 (supercritical CO 2 ) with MeOH-10% Et 2 NH yielded 0.0029% CET (1) of undescribed purity. 71 HHT (2) was also obtained from C. koreana. 72 He et al. have developed an HPLC analysis method for HHT (2) determination, 73 allowing to reveal three congeners present as impurities in the HHT (2) samples.

The production is limited by the low yields associated with harvest and the high costs are associated with complex chemical synthesis. Cephalotaxus evergreen trees are somewhat difficult to propagate and they are relatively rare. Some of them have been listed in the red list of IUCN (International Union for Conservation of Nature) as national plant of second-grade protection in China and are \"near threatened\" (Cephalotaxus latifolia), \"vulnerable\" (Cephalotaxus oliveri, Cephalotaxus mannii) or rare and \"endangered\" (C. lanceolata or Cephalotaxus fortunei Hook. var. lanceolata (K.M.Feng) Silba, C. hainanensis) species. 77 A variety of strategies are being developed to overcome the limitation of low product yields. A renewed interest in the study of Cephalotaxus crops 78 and the development of methods for analyzing the composition of different plants have been stimulated by the need for raw materials and the search for natural sources rich in CET (1). An HPLC protocol was used to determine the content of CET (1), HT (3), and HHT (2) in crop roots and calluses of C. harringtonia. As expected, CET (1) is the major alkaloid (10 mg/kg dry matter) while HT (3) and HHT (2) are more present in the roots (6.6 and 7.5 mg/kg, respectively). 79 In plant cell and tissue culture, cell growth and product formation are not necessarily correlated. Cell culture studies have sought to identify factors that tend to yield low yields and slow metabolic rates. Zhang et al. proposed the technique of periodic oscillation in temperature between 10 and 25 C every 12 h for 45 days to overcome this key problem. 80 The total production of HT (3), HHT (2) , and isoHT (4) (1.22 mg/L) in solid cultures (SoC) of C. fortunei was enhanced by 1.8-and 1.3-fold compared to the controls at constant temperatures of 10 or 25 C. When subjected to such an oscillation every 24 h for 30 days, suspension cultures (SuC) gave a total alkaloid production of 0.18 mg/L, a 2.0-and 1.05-fold improvement compared to the SuC controls at 10 or 25 C, respectively. HT (3) represents the main alkaloid (72%e92% for SoC in 45 days, and 50%e67% for SuC for 30 days) while the HHT (2) content is only 4%e21% in SoC and 23%e40% in SuC, the remaining being isoHT (4).",

The OY and Cephalotaxus Alkaloids the number of steps (NS) are given from commercially available reagents for comparison purpose. In addition, for convergent syntheses, total number of steps (TNS), which represents the total efforts to be accomplished up to the target molecule, and the corresponding average yield (AY) are given. Synopses of the syntheses of CET (1) reported so far are presented in Table 9 (racemic) and Table 10 (asymmetric). Besides formal syntheses targeting Weinreb's enamine grouped together in Table 9 , racemic syntheses are classified according to the type of disconnection of ring B (aee, Fig. 13 ), the type of intermediate in the formal syntheses and then in a chronological order. The asymmetric syntheses are presented in chronological order in Table 10 . It is apparent from Table 9 that most of the syntheses of rac-CET (AE)-(1) are linear (only 10 being convergent) and proceed predominantly (19 of 33) by the C4eC13 disconnection a. The shortest access to CET (1) was described in the first synthesis of CET (1) by Weinreb et al. 103 in 11 steps including the preparation of homopiperonylic acid (89) in two steps from piperonal (82) . 134 The most effective total syntheses were described by Kuehne et al. 94 in only 11 steps and 11.2% OY (average 82% yield per step) or 12 steps and 17.1% OY, by Ishibashi and Ikeda et al. 138 115 The favorite choices as ring A precursors are piperonal (82) and homopiperonylic acid (89) with C11 and the methylenedioxy group already at the right position. Table 10 shows that proline (140) is a widely used chiral source (5 over 21 syntheses), either in its natural L form, or in its unnatural D one. Herein, 15 syntheses are convergent and 6 are linear.

            "text": "Suga and Yoshida developed an approach to the azaspiro-compound 101 via ring-closing metathesis (RCM) of a functionalized pyrrolidine 100 generated by electrochemical oxidation of a,a-bis(trimethylsilyl)pyrrolidine 95 (Scheme 4). 86, 87 First, homopiperonylic acid (89) was used to prepare the A unit 91 bearing a nosylate and an aromatic iodide suitable for ring B annulation, relying on Semmelhack's procedure. 83 , 88 The two silyl groups were introduced by Beak's methodology 89 (deprotonation with sec-BuLi and quenching with TMSCl) furnishing compound 94, which was protected into N-methoxycarbonyl compound 95. Its anodic oxidation at low temperature yielded N-acyliminium ion 96, reacting in situ with homoallylmagnesium bromide (97) furnishing pyrolidine 98. This latter compound was next submitted to a second anodic oxidation followed by direct trapping with the organozinc reagent 99 to provide the diolefin 100. Diene 100 was converted to azaspiro CD unit 101 via ring closing metathesis promoted by Grubbs I catalyst. After deprotection using TMSI, the spiranic amine intermediate reacted with nosylate 91 obtained from homopiperonylic acid (89) following Semmelhack's procedure. 88 The so-formed aryl iodide (AE)-102 was submitted to an intramolecular Heck-type ring closing reaction according to Tietze 84 Regioselective bromination of homopiperonylic acid (89) yielded bromocarboxylic acid 103 converted to Weinreb's amide, 2,83 and then reduced by DIBAL to furnish aldehyde 104. Different routes were proposed to prepare the ACD ringecontaining aryl bromide 86. The best one starts from b-ketoester 105 transformed by reduction to allylic alcohol 106, 91 which was treated with triethyl orthoacetate under Johnson orthoestere Claisen conditions to give ethyl ester 107. Afterward, ester 107 was converted in three steps into sulfonamide 108 by successive reduction by LiAlH 4 , tosylation, and nucleophilic displacement by tosylamine. The The g-butyrolactam 113 was prepared from 2-arylethanol 90 in 65% OY by Mitsunobu's substitution of the primary alcohol, followed by partial reduction of the crude succinimide 112 with NaBH 4 and reductive dehydroxylation of the resulting hemiaminal. Huang's methodology, namely activation of compound 113 by triflic anhydride (2,6-di-tertbutyl-4-methylpyridine (DTBMP)) was the best base for this reaction, followed by successive addition of buten-1-yl Grignard (97) 84 and employed by Suga and Yoshida. 86 Once again, four steps (Mori's protocol) 85 have to be performed to obtain rac-CET (AE)-(1), to give a 14-steps pathway in 5.4% estimated OY from homopiperonylic acid (89). Reaction of 1,2-epoxycyclopentane 116 with in situ generated dimethylsulfonium methylide gave allylic alcohol 106, which was directly used for the subsequent JohnsoneClaisen rearrangement. The resulting ester 107 was subjected to amidation reaction conditions with hydroxylamine to afford hydroxamic acid 117. The nitroso-ene cyclization was accomplished on oxidation with tetrapropylammonium periodate via a highly reactive acylnitroso intermediate 118 delivering N-hydroxy-1-azaspiro [4.4] non-2-one 119, which was trapped as an acetate 120 yielding in moderate yield spiro-lactam (AE)-121 90 on SmI 2 reduction. Alkylation of the sodium salt of (AE)-121 with iodoaryl tosylate 115 gave quantitatively (AE)-122. The subsequent Heck reaction promoted by HerrmanneBeller catalyst 87 proceeded smoothly to deliver the ABCD Kuehne's intermediate 94 (AE)-123, and the corresponding regioisomeric product (AE)-124 in 82% combined yield, based on recovered starting material (brsm) as an inseparable 54:46 mixture. rac-CET (AE)-(1) could be obtained in 12 steps from cyclopentene oxide (116) and 6.2% OY provided that separation of the regioisomers is effective and four supplementary steps applied to transform the ABCD intermediate (AE)-123 (TNS 15 steps, AY 2.5%, 4.3% brsm). Although Huang and Wang described a rapid access to the CD spirocyclic amide (AE)-121, Heck ring closure of ring B led to a mixture of two regioisomers and decreasing dramatically the yield. as key transformations. 99 We describe here the best route that led to Li's intermediate 97 (AE)-148 via the spirolactone 154 (Scheme 10). Spirolactone 154 was obtained from methyl prolinate (AE)-150 by N-allylation with allyl bromide, leading to allylamine 151, which underwent a [2,3]-Stevens rearrangement of the resulting quaternary ammonium salt by reaction with benzyl bromide providing N-benzyl pyrrolidine 152. After lactonization of 152 under acidic conditions followed by debenzylation through catalytic hydrogenation, spirolactone 154 was acylated with 3,4-dimethoxyphenacetyl chloride (145) to produce the amide spirolactone 155 containing the AC ring units, which was selectively reduced with LiBH 4 to diol 156 in 63.9% OY. Swern oxidation of diol 156 furnished the amido keto-aldehyde 157, which was treated with potassium carbonate to give the amido spirocyclopentenone (AE)-148 with the ACD ring units. This formal synthesis is especially suitable for the production of (AE)-148 at a scale up to 10e50 g. Li 97 and Hanaoka's 98 procedures (6 steps, 15% OY) would allow to complete the synthesis of rac-CET (AE)-(1) in 15 steps and 7.1% OY from rac-proline (AE)- (140) . ",

This means that the configurations of the three asymmetric centers are mutually controlled. Strategies using disconnection C4eC5 for B ring formation exemplify this phenomenon. During the cyclization step, the thermodynamically more stable BD ring junction is cis, which is the relative C4eC5 configuration found in natural CET. Moreover, Weinreb also showed that NaBH 4 reduction of cephalotaxinone (10) is stereoselective (Scheme 24), delivering the required relative stereochemistry of the hydroxyl function at C3 of CET (1), which is assumed to be formed as a result of hydride attack from the convex face of 10.",

Most of asymmetric syntheses are based on the control of this spiro center followed by a stereoselective cyclization affording the B ring and C4 control, a final reduction establishing the desired configuration at C3. The asymmetric syntheses of CET (1) described below are classified according to the type of stereochemical control (asymmetric catalysis, use of chiral auxiliaries, incorporation of chiral building blocks, and resolution strategies) and deconnection of ring B, related strategies then in chronological order in each section. treatment with a large excess of Grignard reagent prepared from chloroalcohol 265 and tosylation (three steps, 40% OY). Chiral bromoacetate 268 corresponding to the future D ring was obtained by reduction with diborane in the presence of catalytic amounts of the chiral oxazaborolidine 267, followed by acetylation of the allylic alcohol. A 87% ee was measured by NMR using Eu(hfc) 3 . Formation of the B and C rings was achieved by the strategy described for rac-CET (AE)-(1), employing two successive Pd-catalyzed transformations. The optically active form of Mori's intermediate 85 (\u00c0)-88 was isolated. The synthesis of CET (\u00c0)-(1) could be likely achieved in 13-steps linear sequence, 3.1% calculated OY, and 87% expected ee from cyclopentane-1,3-dione (77). Application of the Tietze's procedure led to Mori's alkene (\u00c0)-88 in 80% ee determined by chiral HPLC. Surprisingly, during its purification by column chromatography on silica gel, authors found that enantiomers could be separated leading to (\u00c0)-88 in 35.5% yield with >99% ee. This phenomenon called \"self-dispropornation of enantiomers\" results from different affinities of aggregates of compound 88 on silica gel. 123 Tu thus accomplished a formal synthesis of CET (\u00c0)-(1) in 14 steps, 3.3% calculated OY and 80% ee (18 TNS, 2.5% OY). The high purity material (estimated 99% ee) could be obtained in 1.7% calculated OY from trimethylsilylacetylene (269) .",

DIBAL-H reduction of 331 followed by Wittig reaction with 1-triphenylphosphoranylidene-2-propanone (332) gave an intermediate E-enone. Catalytic hydrogenation and a second Wittig reaction with chloromethylenephosphorane (334) afforded the vinyl chloride 335. After deprotection of the amine, amide formation with the carboxylic acid 89 and reduction of the resulting amide 337 led to the pivotal alkylidene carbene precursor 338. Its treatment with potassium hexamethyldisilazide caused the key alkylidene carbene 1,5-CH insertion reaction leading to the desired azaspiro [4.4] nonane derivative 339 in good yield (65%e79%). Regioselective iodination of the aromatic ring system gave the Heck-cyclization precursor 340. Its X-ray crystal structure allowed the confirmation of its absolute stereochemistry, thus demonstrating that as expected the 1,5-CH insertion reaction had proceeded with retention of configuration. The Heck cyclization under modified Fu's conditions (Pd(OAc) 2 , HBF 4 $PtBu 3 , Cs 2 CO 3 ) delivered the ABCD olefin 341 in 61% yield, together with enamine 342 (30%).

Formation of the aketoester 445 was followed by the introduction of the acetyl group through a Reformatsky reaction. Although this esterification/Reformatsky alkylation sequence is interesting, proceeded well and allowed the preparation of various HTs such as HT (3), HHT (2), deoxyHT (5) , and so on, the sequence also exhibits a major drawback: the Reformatsky reaction on the prochiral ketoester part of 445 continuously gave a mixture of two epimers in a 1/1 mixture leading thus to the loss of half part of the CET. This major inconvenience was avoided in only two syntheses of HHT (2): the synthesis reported by Hudlicky 149 (where the presence of the second keto group allowed a chelation with the Reformatsky reagent leading to the formation of a single stereomer) and the synthesis of Cheng 150 (using a chiral sulfinyl ester).",

The synthesis started with the preparation of the known chiral imine 465 (Scheme 50), which was subjected to a Michael reaction with acetoxyacrylonitrile (466), an equivalent of the acid side chain. The adduct 467 was proved to be stereochemically homogeneous and was hydrolyzed without purification to give the more stable ketone (R,R)-468. The keto group was protected as a dioxolane and the potential aldehyde function was directly transformed into the ester 469 on treatment with MnO 2 in MeOH in the presence of NaCN. The ketal of ester 469 was cleaved using CeCl 3 $7H 2 O and NaI, and the so-formed keto group was converted to the silylvinyl ether 470. Ozonolysis of 470 gave the sensitive aldehyde 471. Addition of MeMgBr to the crude aldehyde and esterification of the acid furnished alcohol 472. Oxidation of the alcohol 472 to a methylketone followed by new addition of MeMgBr gave the tertiary alcohol, which eventually on hydrogenolysis led to (R)-methyl 3,7-dihydroxy-3-methylcarbonyl-7-methoxyoctanoate (473), the methyl derivative of HHT side chain.",

The synthesis began with known N-Boc ester (S)-512 of L-aspartic acid obtained through a two-step process (94%). The gem-dimethyl group was first installed by a Grignard reaction to give 513, which was transformed into the lactol 514 by IBX oxidation and concomitant cyclization. The Wittig reaction with phosphorane 515 followed by deprotection and N-bisbenzylation of the amino group furnished key allylamine (S)-516. The Meisenheimer rearrangement occurred on treatment with mCPBA on the latter to give hydroxylamine 517. This compound led to 518 on treatment with H 2 on catalytic Pd/C via double bond saturation and then NeO bond cleavage. Eventually, on oxidation of 518 the HHT's side chain acid (R)-481 was obtained whose methylation yielded the corresponding dimethyl ester (R)-473. Its optical rotation indicated a perfect stereochemical outcome of the rearrangement. A similar process allowed synthesis of a cyclic form of the HT's side chain. Starting from L-threonine (519), amino alkene 520 was prepared in seven steps. The Meisenheimer rearrangement occurred on treating 520 with mCPBA to give the sensitive hydroxylamine 521. Six steps were then needed to obtain (R)-522, a cyclic form of the HT's side chain acid. These authors patented the preparation of HHT's side chain acid (R)-481 by this methodology. 161 Through the same sequence, Yang and coworkers have also described the synthesis of the diacid side chain of deoxyHT (5) and homodeoxyHT (22) starting from L-valine and L-leucine respectively. 162 ",

            "text": "In conclusion, the study of many syntheses of CET (1) published to date can draw a number of conclusions about the key points of its structure and the way chemists have overcome the problems posed by its synthesis. The formation of the B ring often remains a crucial point in building the CET skeleton. The C4eC13 disconnection remains by far the most studied (>30 syntheses of 50). The cyclization reactions used (electrophilic aromatic substitutions, organometallic coupling, etc.) perform generally with good yields but seem susceptible to cyclization intermediates and electronic richness of the aromatic ring. This disconnection is also extremely interesting from a stereochemical point of view providing the correct relative configuration at C4 and C5, avoiding difficult separations. Other disconnections do not always give such good results and are not completely diastereoselective. The formation of the spiro CD system is also a key point in these syntheses; in fact, the control of center C5 at the start of synthesis greatly simplified stereocontrolled strategies and enabled enantioselective approach to CET (1) by asymmetric synthesis of the CD system. Subsequent stereoinduction of the C5 center on C4 center and C4 center on the C3 center facilitate the production of optically active CET (1). However, the operating conditions used after the synthesis of the spiro system must be chosen carefully because of the risk of racemization of CET (1) and certain synthetic intermediates by breaking the N9eC5 bond (See Figs. 18 and 19 , the conversion of Mori's intermediates (AE)-88 and (\u00c0)-88). Last but not least, from an industrial point of view, initially the Merck Group took over the Weinreb racemic synthesis improving performance (11.7% by eliminating some purification steps). The optically active CET (1) in its natural configuration may be obtained by resolution of racemic cephalotaxine rac-CET (AE)-(1) with tartaric acid, by incorporation of chiral sources, or by enantioselective synthesis. The high-purity HHT (2) used for clinical trials was obtained by extraction (NCI batches) and by semisynthesis (ssHHT) from natural CET (1) then purified by HPLC to remove impurities and minor diastereoisomers first by the French company Oncopharm SA later based in Houston (USA). A number of HHT (2) analogs were prepared; however only the monoacylated analogs 585a, 585f, and 585g showed slight increase in activity agains both hematopoietic and solid caner cell lines. The main advantage was to prepare hydrosoluble stable forms. Figure 24 Simplified diagram of protein synthesis showing the A site where homoharringtonine (HHT) binds to inhibit protein synthesis. 178 In the cytoplasm of the cells, ribosomes (green) bind to the mRNA containing the code translated from the switched on genes into the DNA. The 20 different amino acids carried by transfer RNA (tRNA) are recruited according to a three nuclear base code into the ribosome A site. The protein chain elongation includes the aminoacyl tRNA entry, its proofreading, the peptidyl transfer, and the ribosomal translocation along the tRNA chain. The cartoon on the right explains how HHT (2) inhibits protein synthesis through inhibition of initiation elongation step. the structure and function of the ribosome.\" They have all generated 3D models that have shown how different antibiotics, including HHT (2), 176 bind to the ribosome. Also, they demonstrated by X-ray (at high resolution up to 2.9 \u00c5) the crystals of the 80S ribosome in complexes with 12 eukaryote-specific inhibitors and four broad-spectrum inhibitors in Saccharomyces cerevisiae. 177 Both the ring system and the tail of HHT (2) participate in interactions with the ribosome that contribute to drug binding. HHT (2) interaction with the ribosome is stabilized by hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds (Fig. 25) . Its six-membered aromatic ring stacks on the base of Cytosine 2452 for Haloarcula marismortui (2487 for Escherichia coli), and it fills the A-site cleft completely, the five-membered dioxolane ring attached to it. When HHT (2) is bound to the ribosome, 73% of its surface area becomes water inaccessible. The tertiary amine of HHT (2) 176 One of the main actions of HHT (2) is induction of apoptosis (Fig. 25 ). HHT (2) has a different mechanism of action from that of tyrosine kinase inhibitors, a class of drugs used in for the treatment of CML. Accordingly its activity in CML is independent of the mutation state of BCR-ABL cells (particular CML cells that contain a fusion gene called BCR-ABL1, generated by translocation of sequences from the c-ABLgene on chromosome 9 into the BCR gene on chromosome 22). 179 The mechanism of apoptosis induced by HHT (2) A study was conducted on SHI-1 cell lines to prove that mitochondria are involved in the apoptosis induced by HHT (2) . 180 Although HHT (2) induces apoptosis mediated by mitochondria (intrinsic pathway), it also induces apoptosis through death receptors (extrinsic pathway). The intrinsic pathway is induced by cleaving the proactive forms into active ones. HHT (2) activates some apoptosis mediators; it inhibits the apoptotic inhibitors and upregulates the release of other mediators through the action on genetic level. For instance apoptosis was studied in QGY-7703 cell line and 78 individual mRNAs were identified as having their transcription levels significantly changed. Those genes were mostly oncogenes, tumor suppressors, enzymes, kinases, and partially related to apoptosis, 68% being upregulated and 32% were downregulated. The following signaling apoptosis pathways were activated: TGF-b, tumor necrosis factor (TNF), FAS, p38MAPK, and p53. 181 The head protein of intrinsic apoptosis cascade is p53. It was activated by HHT (2) in human hepatoma QGY-7703 cells 181 , but cell line with p53 mutation was more resistant to HHT (2) . 182 A study demonstrated rapid apoptosis of U937 and HL60 cell lines on treatment with HHT (2); this was measured by increased annexin V binding capacity, caspase-3 activation, and the cleavage of poly(adenosine 5 0 -diphosphate (ADP)ribose) polymerase (PARP). Also, the expression of Bax was upregulated during cell death induced by HHT (2), while the expression of bcl-2 was only slightly decreased. 183 On treatment of human myelodysplastic syndrome (MDS) MUTZ-1 cell lines with HHT (2), Ca 2\u00fe translocated from endoplasmic reticulum (ER) pool to cytosol, the mitochondrial membrane potential (Dwm) decreased, and Bid protein translocated from ER to mitochondria. Ca 2\u00fe and Bid proteins were released from ER pool to cytosol. The activation of ER stress-associated proapoptotic factor, CHOP and ER chaperones BiP and XBP1 genes, was followed by cleavage of caspase-3 but not caspase-4. 184, 185 mRNA expression levels of survivin were investigated in various hematopoietic cell lines in relation with apoptosis induced by HHT (2) . It was concluded that the apoptotic effect of HHT (2) on the hematopoietic cell lines is associated with decreased level of survivin expression. 186 In a study of apoptosis using ssHHT (2) on HL60 and HL60/MRP (cells lacking Baxes) cell lines, ssHHT (2) was effective in a time-and dose-dependent manner, and independently of the expression of Bax. Additionally, ssHHT (2) induced apoptosis through the decrease of Dwm and the release of cytochrome c. This was explained by decreased myeloid cell leukemia-1 (Mcl-1) level and cleavage of Bcl-2, one of the proteins that governs the outer membrane of the mitochondria and has antiapoptotic activity (Fig. 26 ). 187 HHT (2) inhibited the telomerase content of HL-60 cells effectively and induced apoptosis. 188 HHT ( (2) (2)",

            "text": "The intrinsic apoptosis using transforming subfamily of growth factorb-inducible Sp1-like proteins called transforming growth factor-beta inducible early protein gene (TIEG1) was studied. TIEG1 induced apoptosis through upregulation of Bax and Bim and downregulation of Bcl-2 and Bcl-XL, release of cytochrome c, and caspase-3 activation. 190 The apoptotic effect of HHT was studied in K562 cell line using gene chip technology, it was found that 17 genes were upregulated and 27 were downregulated. Most of them were found to be related to apoptosis, oncogenes, or tumor suppression. Several genes with altered gene expression were found, such as TIEG, vitamin D3 upregulated protein one gene (VDUP1), RNA binding motif protein 4 gene (RBM4), and v-myc myelocytomatosis viral oncogene homolog (C-MYC). The activated transforming growth factor-b and TNFesignaling pathways play an important role in apoptosis according to the dynamic gene expression pattern in these apoptotic cells. TIEG was significantly modified after induction of apoptosis, which is critical for apoptosis signal transmission. 191 A Chinese team tried to identify different genes whose expression is modified during apoptosis induced by HHT (2) on leukemic HL-60 cell lines; they demonstrated that TGF-a and TNF apoptosis signaling pathways were initiated but not the Fas signaling pathway. Overexpression of TIEG and VDUP1 could induce apoptosis in some kinds of cells and they were upregulated. Other genes, such as BRD2, ACVRL1, and RBM4 were also upregulated and are probably involved in apoptosis signaling pathways. 192 The efficacy of HHT (2) against ponatinib-resistant Ph-positive cells Ba/F3 (Ba/F3 ponatinib-R) was shown by decreased protein expression levels of BCR-ABL and Crk-L. On the other hand, caspase-3 and cleaved PARP levels were significantly increased. HHT (2) treatment reduced the expression of BCR-ABL, as well as heat shock protein (HSP) 90, which stabilizes the BCR-ABL protein. It was found that HHT (2) reduced the expression level of the antiapoptotic protein Bcl-2 and of c-Myc. HHT (2) was examined on ponatinib-resistant primary Ph-positive ALL and CP CML cell lines. The synthesis of BCR-ABL, HSP90, and Bcl-2 was downregulated and was independent of caspase activity. 193 HHT (2) antagonizes specifically the p-eIF4F function, which is specifically required by cancer cell for their survival and not the eIF4F, which is required for normal cells. 194 HHT (2) reduces the levels of prooncogenic or prosurvival proteins (important proteins for tumorigenesis) having short half-lives, such as Mcl-1, cyclin D1, or c-Myc. This was demonstrated on a well-studied transgenic mice model Em-myc lymphomas harboring lesions in Pten, Tsc2, Bcl-2, or eIF4E. 175 Cytotoxicity of HHT (2) and cell-growth activity were investigated in three AML cell lines, HL-60, NB4, and U937, and in three CML cell lines, K562, KU812, and KCL22. AML cells showed more sensitivity than CML cells to HHT-induced cytotoxicity. Using HL-60 cells, it was revealed that HHT (2) decreased the levels of Mcl-1, X-linked inhibitor of apoptosis protein (XIAP), survivin, and B-cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) homology domain 3 (BH3)-only proteins as well as the Dwm. U937, K562, KU812, and KCL22 cells that expressed B-cell lymphoma-extra-large (Bcl-xL) (antiapoptotic transmembrane protein in the mitochondria) were less responsive to HHT-induced apoptosis than HL-60 cells. It was suggested that Bcl-xL plays a more important role than Bcl-2 and Mcl-1 in protecting against HHT (2)-induced apoptosis. 195 In addition, it was demonstrated in leukemic cell lines K562 that HHT (2) inhibits the synthesis of vascular endothelial growth factor, an important mediator of angiogenesis in the bone marrow. This work thus demonstrated a possible antiangiogenic activity for HHT (2) . 196 A study to identify novel biomarker that might contribute to variation in response to HHT (2) by using a panel of various human lymphoblastoid cell lines was performed. Genome-wide association analysis was applied using single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) and mRNA expression data. The integrated analysis identified four unique SNPs that were associated with both expression and area under the curve. Functional validation using siRNA knockdown in leukemia cell lines showed that knocking down CCDC88A, CTBP2, SOCS4 genes in U937 and K562 cell lines significantly altered HHT (2) cytotoxicity. 197 The overexpression of EphB4 contributed to IM resistance in CML line cells. Cell lines from a patient with relapsed CML were established at the time of first diagnosis and after being relapsed. EphB4/RhoA may be a new marker for IM resistance. This is supported by the fact that HHT (2) with IM yielded more treatment advantages than IM alone by blocking EphB4/RhoA pathways. 198, 199 Apoptosis varying intervals in K562 cell line treated with HHT (2) was studied. The results showed that the viability of K562 cells reduced gradually from day 1 to day 5 and ascended from day 6 to day 8 after HHT (2) treatment. At the same time, the cleaved caspase-3 expression level in K562 cell lines increased gradually from day 1 to day 7 but decreased at the day 8 (P < .05). From day 1 to day 8 after HHT (2) treatment, the BCL-2 expression level declined first and then went up (P < .05). Autophagosome was also increased at day 8 after HHT (2) treatment. It is concluded that the apoptosis level of K562 cells after being treated with HHT (2) increased at the beginning of the treatment and then it declined, which may be associated by higher autophagy level in the late stage of HHT (2) treatment. 200 A recent study demonstrated that HHT (2) binds to the DNA with an intercalation mode. 201 Also, HHT (2) binds to the telomere G-quadruplex, which makes it a good model for drug design. 202 Analysis of proteins expression profiles in K562 cell line (a CML cell line) in response to HHT (2) treatment showed that nine proteins were downregulated and four upregulated. Aside from alterations in apoptotic proteins and proteins associated with transcription and translation, changes in oxidative stress response and redox reactionerelated proteins, such as HSPs, DJ-1, and thioredoxin were revealed. Specifically, these proteins were decreased after HHT (2) treatment in K562 and primary CML cell lines. 203 Also, it was found that HHT (2) is an effective inhibitor of unwanted angiogenesis. 204, 205 6.1.2 Potential Use for the Treatment of Other Tumors Beside its use in the treatment of CML, HHT (2) is being investigated for other type of tumors alone and in combination with other drugs: HHT (2) significantly inhibited the proliferation of human MM cell lines and tumor cells from patients with relapsed refractory MM in a dosedependent manner. This apoptotic process was associated with the activation of caspase-8, caspase-9, caspase-3, and PARP. 206 The effect of HHT (2) was demonstrated on MM, on the following cell lines AMO-1, IM9, RPMI8226, EJM, U266, and OPM-2; HHT (2) significantly reduced Mcl-1, a crucial protein involved in myeloma cell survival, in all the myeloma cell lines that were examined. Also, HHT (2) reduced the levels of c-FLIPL/S, activated caspase-8, and induced active reduction of Bid. It follows that HHT-induced apoptosis appears to be mediated via both intrinsic and extrinsic apoptosis pathways. The resultant imbalance between BH3-only proteins and Mcl-1 may be pivotal for apoptosis by HHT (2) . Also, HHT (2) treatment resulted in reduced levels of b-catenin and XIAP proteins, which also contribute to disease progression and resistance to chemotherapy in MM. HHT (2) enhanced the effects of melphalan, bortezomib, and ABT-737 when given in combinations with these agents. These results suggest that HHT (2) could constitute an attractive option for MM treatment through its ability to simultaneously target multiple tumor-promoting molecules. 207 HHT (2) and Bortezomib synergistically inhibit SKM-1 MDS cell proliferation and induce apoptosis in vitro. 208 Transmembrane receptor of the tyrosine kinase KIT oncoprotein is an important therapeutic target as part of the type III tyrosine kinases. Some mutations in this receptor (V560G, D816V, or D814Y) give it the ability of auto-dimerization and auto-phosphorylation without activation by its ligand, which can eventually lead to uncontrolled cell proliferation and a resistance to apoptosis. The gain of function associated with these mutations of the KIT receptor plays a critical role in the pathogenesis of SM and gastrointestinal stromal tumors (GISTs). The hypothesis that HHT (2), as an inhibitor of protein synthesis, decreases the protein level of KIT thereby reduces the level of phospho-KIT and repeals its constitutive signaling downstream. HHT (2) is effective both in vitro and in vivo demonstrating that it effectively inhibits tumor growth in mice and induced apoptosis of tumor cells carrying the V560G (sensitive to IM) and D816V (insensitive to IM) mutations of KIT. In addition, HHT (2) significantly prolonged the mouse survival time with aggressive SM (35 days instead of 7) though a rapid resistance to HHT (2) was observed in this case. 209 Potential activity of HHT (2) against clear celletype renal cell carcinoma (RCC) with mutant von HippeleLindau gene was revealed by highthroughput simultaneous screen and counterscreen. 210 In addition, HHT (2) has the potential for treatment of the Gefitinib-resistant nonesmall cell lung cancer, according to an in vivo study. 211 ",

            "text": "A signal oncogene is important for some tumors for their continued activity of their malignant phenotype. The BCR-ABL fusion protein in CML is the best-studied example. HHT (2) that inhibits protein synthesis thus reduces the level of the BCR-ABL protein level. The kinase activity of BCR-ABL is directly inhibited by IM and flavopiridol (a transcription inhibitor). The median-effect method was used to evaluate combinations of flavopiridol/HHT (2) and flavopiridol/IM. The resulting analysis indicated synergistic decrease in the clonogenicity. Synergy increased when HHT (2) and IM were administered sequentially as opposed to simultaneously. Transfected IM-resistant Ba/F3 cells that expressed the E255K and T315I mutations of BCR-ABL were not cross-resistant to flavopiridol and HHT (2) . These results provided a rationale for the combination of inhibitors of transcription and/or translation with specific kinase inhibitors. 212 The combination of HHT (2) and DOX had ratio-dependent synergistic activities, with very strong synergism observed at a molar ratio of 4/1 (DOX/HHT) within double-loaded liposomes. According to this study liposomal codelivery of DOX and HHT (2) could synergistically potentiate antitumor effects. 213 HL60/ADR, Kasumi-1, and primary AML cells were pretreated with Decitabine and then exposed to HAA regimen (HHT (2), aclarubicin, and cytarabine (Ara-C)). Decitabine increased cytotoxic effect of HAA regimen and enhanced apoptosis in chemoresistant AML cells. 214 A synergistic effect of Sulforaphane in human CML cell line K562 with chemotherapy drugs HHT (2) and Ara-C was found and indicated clinical potential. 215 The combination of HHT (2) and YM155 was investigated on K562 cell lines, and it was found to be synergistic. The mechanism was related to the apoptosis induced through downregulation of survivin. 216 TNF-related apoptosis-inducing ligand (TRAIL) is a proapoptotic ligand from the TNF-a family. HHT (2) represents a very efficient enhancer of TRAIL-induced apoptosis with potential application in TRAIL-based, anticancer combination therapy. The agonistic anti-TRAIL receptor antibody is a potential antitumor agent. HHT (2) was found to be a very effective (in nano-molar dose) enhancer of TRAIL-mediated apoptosis/growth suppression. Cotreatment of TRAIL-resistant RKO or HT-29 cells with HHT (2) and TRAIL led to the effective induction of apoptosis and the complete elimination of the treated cells. HHT (2) suppressed the expression of the antiapoptotic proteins Mcl-1 and cFLIP and enhanced the TRAIL-triggered activation of JNK and p38 kinases. 217 Another study suggested that HHT (2) can replace toxic substances such as cycloheximide because it activates necroptosis through the same signaling pathways (involving RIPK1/RIPK3/MLKL) to sensitize human cancer cells to TRAIL-induced necroptosis. 218 HHT (2) was combined with antiproliferatives such as alkylating agents, intercalating agents, metal coordination complexes, pyrimidine nucleosides, purine nucleosides, inhibitors of nucleic acideassociated enzymes and proteins, and agents affecting structural proteins and cytoplasmic enzymes, for the treatment of a host with a cellular proliferative disease, particularly a neoplasia. 219 When matrine combined with HHT (2) was tested on the proliferation of human AML cells HL-60, a synergistic effect on apoptosis was noticed. 220,221",

Resistance against HT (3), DOX, and curcumin was decreased alongside the decreased expression of MRD1. The study indicated that shRNA recombinant plasmids could modulate MDR in vitro. 223 Human MDR B-cell lymphoma cell line BJAB/ADR was found to be resistant to HHT (2), daunorubicin (DNR), etoposide, and mitoxantrone (MTX). 224 A study on the pharmacological effect of HHT (2) on the molecular level was conducted. CET (1) and HHT (2) were tested for resistance on the MDR cell lines. These were the 55 cell lines of the Developmental Therapeutics Program of the National Cancer Institute (NCI, Bethesda, Md., USA) that overexpress the conferring P-glycoprotein/MDR1 (CEM/ ADR5000), which can expel HHT (2) of the cell and consequently which can attenuate its activity. In CEM/ADR5000 cells, a threefold increase to HHT (2) resistance was observed, though the other MDR cell lines did not show cross-resistance. 225 6.1.5 Mechanism of Allergic Reaction HHT (2) was screened and identified as a potential allergic factor. Histamine 1 receptor/cell membrane chromatography (H1R/CMC) model was applied for capturing membrane-retained components, which could induce H1R activation. Retention components were enriched and analyzed by H1R/CMC-HPLC/MS. HHT (2) was recognized, separated, and identified in HHT (2) medication. Ca 2\u00fe flux assay and p-IP3R (channels that most often mediate Ca 2\u00fe release from intracellular stores) expression found that HHT (2) retained by the H1R/CMC model increased phosphorylation of IP3R and promoted cytosolic free Ca 2\u00fe elevation in a dose-dependent manner, which further verified the activity of HHT (2) in activating H1R. This provides an indication that a patient with overexpressed H1R should be aware of possible allergic reaction when applying HHT (2) injection. 226 6.1.6 Other Pharmacological Applications From the chloroform extract of the aerial parts of the only Cephalotaxus harringtonia L. specimen grown in Egypt, five known alkaloids CET (1), HHT (2), HT (3), isoHT (4), and deoxyHT (5) were identified by HPLCeESIeMS. 227 This extract was tested in vitro for its cytotoxicity against HCT116, HepG2, and MCF-7 cell lines and resulted with IC 50 values of 4.77, 12.9, and 17.5 mg/mL, while DOX had IC 50 values of 3.74, 4.57, and 2.97 mg/mL against these cell lines, respectively.",

HT (3) acts on the postentry stage of the CHIKV replication cycle and strongly interferes with the process of viral protein synthesis. 228 Cryptosporidium parasites cause cryptosporidiosis, a diarrheal disease usually, which can result in fulminant diarrhea and death in AIDS patients and chronic infection and stunting in children. A library of drug repurposing candidates were screened against Cryptosporidium parvum among which HHT (2) showed promising in vitro activity, its IC 50 activity was 0.86 mM. 229 HHT (2) and CET (1) were tested against the hepatitis B virus (HCV), using the bovine viral diarrhoea virus (BVDV) as surrogate for HCV. The activity relative to BVDV was determined by reduction of BVDV-RNA production and protection of infected embryonic bovine trachea (EBTr) cells. Activity against HBV was investigated by HBsAg release and HBV-DNA release from hepatoblastoma HepG2 2.2.15 cells infected with HBV. HHT (2) showed high activity against HBV (IC 50 was 2 mM against HBV, but it has a very low therapeutic index). 230 CET (1) and HHT (2) induced toxicity in EBTr cells and had no protective effect against BVDV. In contrast, they were able to inhibit HBV production at concentrations 10-to 100-fold lower than other molecules inducing cell toxicity, which suggests that they are potentially useful in combined therapy against hepatitis B.",

Some drugs that had a well-defined cellular pathway as targets were included. In total, 27 compounds with activity against both MERS-CoV and SARS-CoV were identified. The EC 50 activity of HHT (2) against MERS-CoV was 71.8 nM. 231 HT (3) was extremely effective in inhibiting human retinal glial cell proliferation. Its activity was comparable to other antiproliferative drugs such as colchicine, daunomycin, and 5-fluorouracil. HT (3) is therefore a potential drug for the treatment of proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR). 232 In 2009, the inhibitory effects of HHT (2) on CML and B-ALL (B cell ALL) cell line was evaluated in vitro and showed that over 90% of leukemic stem cells were killed after treatment with HHT (2). In contrast, less than 9% or 25% of leukemic stem cells were killed after treatment with IM or dasatinib, respectively. 233 HHT (2) has demonstrated activity against coronavirus with an IC 50 ranging from 11 nM to 1.2 mM. 234 Also, HHT (2) when combined with the saponin digitonin showed activity against Trypanosoma brucei brucei. 235 ",

Since omacetaxine is mainly metabolized by esterases, the plasma samples were immediately stabilized after collection with an esterase inhibitor and stored at a nominal temperature of \u00c080 C. The validated plasma assay quantifies all analytes in the concentration range of 0.1e100 ng/mL and the urine assay in the range of 0.1e50 ng/mL. At all concentrations, the accuracies were within AE15% of the nominal concentrations and precisions were 15%.

Four patients responded completely and one responded partially (response rate 5/28 18%); the median duration was roughly 62 days. This study showed potential use of HHT (2) for pediatrics with tolerable toxicity. 245 Two cases of CML patients acquired the T315I mutation after IM treatment; one was treated with recombinant interferon-alpha (IFN-a), and the patient was in complete hematologic response (CHR) 10 months later, while the other patient treated with HHT (2) started at 1.25 mg/m 2 subcutaneously twice daily for 5 consecutive days every month and achieved a CHR after 5 months. 246 The outcomes of 176 patients of AP CML who received treatment with IM were reviewed and compared with the outcomes of 213 historic control patients treated with other drugs including HHT (2) . Treatments included INF-a (100 patients), HHT (2) (35 patients), DNR plus cytarabine toxicities were the major side effects (79% and 73% for CP-CML and AP-CML, respectively), with discontinuation due to toxicity in 10% of CP patients and in 5% of AP patients. 250 The efficacy and safety of HHT (2) in patients with AP-CML previously treated with tyrosine kinase inhibitors were assessed in two phase II trials. 51 patients in AP-CML and 44 in myeloid blast phase (BP-CML) received subcutaneous (SC) omacetaxine 1.25 mg/m 2 twice daily, days 1e14 every 28 days until hematologic response/improvement or any cytogenetic response, and then days 1e7 every 28 days until disease progression. An MHR was 37% in patients with AP-CML and 9% in patients with BP-CML (22% and 5% in those were with a history of T315I mutation). 251 In 2007, a 63-year-old male CML patient was reported harboring a T315I BCR-ABL mutation while on IM treatment that completely disappeared when he was treated with HHT (2). 252 In 2013, HHT (2) produced good clinical responses with acceptable tolerance levels in patients with CML-CP who had been treated with two or more TKIs.

HHT (2) at 1.25 mg/m 2 SC was administered (twice daily) BID, days 1e14 every 28 days for two cycles. This mode of administration was developed because in early clinical studies short intravenous (IV) infusions (over 60e90 min) was used, but life-threatening hypotension and tachycardia were observed at dose levels above 3e4 mg/m 2 . 255 A stable aqueous solution for injection of HHT (2) was prepared with tartaric acid at pH around 4. 256 It is only recently however that the site of protonation, although obvious, was unambiguously seen at N9 of CET (1) or HT (3) as established through X-ray diffraction studies of various organic salts, 76 an observation in concordance with Steitz 176 (see Fig. 25 ) and Takano's 60 results implying that N9 should be available for protonation to ensure its biological activity. Therefore, HTs seem to be active via their protonated form. The maximum tolerated dose was estimated to be 5 mg/m 2 . 257 It is provided in vials that contain 3.5 mg HHT (2) as a sterile, preservative-free, and white to off-white lyophilized single-use solution for injection. 241 In a recent patent HHT (2) was incorporated in phycobiliprotein nanoparticles. 258 HHT (2) can be given as aqueous solution preferably at a pH of about 4.

The CHR rate was 85%. 270 In 2009, a clinical trial phase II carried on 44 previously untreated patients with Philadephia-positive chromosome (Ph\u00fe) CP-CML, the treatment consisted of HHT (2) (2.5 mg/m 2 per day) and cytarabine (7.5 mg/m 2 per day). Both drugs were given together via continuous IV infusion for 7 days. 36 of 44 patients (82%) achieved a CHR. Although HHT/cytarabine was generally well tolerated, no significant amelioration was observed for patients with interferon-refractory CML and result was not nearly as high as association with IM in newly diagnosed patients. 271 In 2010 in China, 12 patients with CML in blast crisis who have failed prior single-agent therapy with IM were enrolled in clinical trial to investigate the induction therapy of granulocyte colony-stimulating factor (G-CSF) and low-dose HHT (2) as well as standard-dose IM (GHI). The outcome of this study suggested that the GHI regimen may overcome disease-poor response to conventional doses of IM followed by allogeneic hematopoietic stem cell transplantation (allo-HSCT). 272 Ninety patients with Ph\u00fe CML in early CP received the triple regimen IFN-a, ara-C, and HHT. After a median duration of 16.5 months of therapy, 78 patients had their therapy changed to IM, 85 patients (94%) achieved CHR, and 67 patients (74%) had a cytogenetic response (Ph suppression to 90%). 273 14 patients were treated with a regimen that combines HHT (2) and IM among which six cases failed and eight cases sub-optimally responded to IM therapy. This trial proved the efficacy and safety of combining both drugs. 274 ",

Total complete remission rate was 66.5%, median survival was 18 months, and estimated survival at 3 years was 30.8%. The third year relapse rate was 55.1%. 276 A group of 254 Chinese patients with de novo AML with glutathione S-transferase theta 1 (GSTT1) and glutathione S-transferase mu 1 (GSTM1) mutations were administered in a clinical study. As induction therapy, the patients were treated with HHT (2) 2.5 mg/m 2 intravenously on days 1e7, Ara-C 150 mg/m 2 per day continuous infusion on days 1e7, and DNR 45 mg/m 2 intravenously on days 1e3 (HAD regimen). The second course of HAD induction therapy was applied to patients who were not in complete remission after the initial course of induction therapy. Postremission therapy consisted of HA regimen (HHT (2) and Ara-C) (course 1 and 4), DA regimen (DNR and Ara-C) (courses 2 and 5), and MA regimen (MTX and Ara-C) or HAM (Ara-C days 1e4, combined with MTZ 8 mg/m 2 , IV on days 5e7) (courses 3 and 6). Overall survival and disease-free survival of complete remission patients in GSTT1 and GSTM1 double present group was better than in GSTT1and/or GSTM1-group. 277 A regimen was investigated to explore the effect of low dose of HHT (2) and Ara-C combined with G-CSF on patients with relapsed or refractory AML: 35 out of 67 (52.2%) patients achieved complete remission and 8 out of 67 (11.9%) achieved partial remission. The overall response rate was 64.1%. 278 In 2003 a clinical trial of combined regiments HHT (2), Ara-C, and etoposide (VP-16) was conducted on 12 pediatric patients, 9 patients achieved complete remission within 20e45 days after one course of therapy. One patient had partial remission this clinical trial gave good indication for this combination. 279 HAA regimen, was evaluated in 46 patients with refractory and/or relapsed AML for efficacy and toxicity. 80% of patients achieved complete remission. 280 b-Elemene emulsion had a curative effect in treatment of refractory/ relapsed AML in combination with HAA regimen. This was clinically proven by comparing two groups: one using the HAA alone and one using b-elemene emulsion with HAA. The total effective rate in the b-elemene emulsion plus HAA group was 80.8%. However, the total effective rate in the HAA only group was 52.9%. 281 Sixty-seven patients with relapsed or refractory AML were enrolled in a clinical trial. They received the following treatment: HHT (2), Ara-C, and G-CSF (HAG). All the patients were treated with HAG regimen. 35 patients (52.2%) achieved complete remission and 8 (11.9%) partial remission. The overall response rate was 64.1% 282 One hundred and ninety six untreated de novo AML patients were recruited in China for a clinical trial using HHT (2) . Patients were treated with HHT (2) and Ara-C (HA)-based induction therapy composed of three chemotherapeutic drugs (HAD/M, D-DNR, M-MTX). The complete response rate was 153 of all cases (78.1%). 283 One hundred and seventy-one pediatric patients were recruited in a trial. They received a regimen including HHT (2), cytarabine and DNR with a median age of 7.58 years. Complete response was obtained in 140 of 171 (81.9%) cases within 60 days. The 5-year event-free survival was 52.75%. 284 Fourty-eight patients median aged 35 (14e57) years were enrolled into a clinical study to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of HAA regimen as an induction therapy in the treatment of de novo AML. The HAA regimen was a well-tolerable and effective induction regimen for patients with de novo AML. 285 A case was reported with primary refractory FLT3-ITD-positive AML was treated with combination of low dose HHT (2) and Sorafenib (salvage treatment); the therapy was successful and the patient was in complete remission. 286 Ninety elderly patients with AML were chosen and divided into CAG (low-dose cytarabine and aclarubicin in combination with G-CSF) group (52 cases) and HAG (HHT (2) and Ara-C combined with G-CSF) group (38 cases). In the CAG group were 38 cases with complete remission (73.08%) and total efficiency was 84.62%; 40 cases with complete remission in HAG group (36.84%) and total efficiency was 73.68% in the HAG group. CAG regimen was more efficient than HAG in elderly patients with AML. 287 In a recent clinical study for elderly patients with de novo AML, 56 patients were enrolled in this study. They were treated with HHT (2) and cytarabine in combination with G-CSF (HAG). Updated results showed good overall survival. 288 A recent metaanalysis provided an overview of the effectiveness of HHT (2) combination regimens to treat AML. Twenty-one studies were analyzed including 1310 patients, 229 pediatric, and 216 elderly. HHT (2) was given in combination with cytarabine, DNR, idarubicin, aclacinomycin, MTX, or G-CSF. This retroanalysis showed the superiority of HHT (2)-containing regimens in AML treatments.",

On HAD induction chemotherapy, the patient achieved partial hematological remission. The patient was then switched to IM plus one cycle of CAG regimen (low-dose cytarabine and aclarubicin in combination with G-CSF). She achieved complete remission, the disease recurred after 40 days and the patient eventually died of infection. 290 Thirty-four myelodysplastic syndromes patients with MDS-RAEB and RAEB-T were recruited for a clinical trial of two regimens therapy of either HAA regimen or Idarubicin Ara-C (IA) regimen. It was suggested that the HAA regimen is more effective than IA and well tolerated. 291 Thirty-three elderly patients were enrolled in a clinical trial, 21 patients with high-risk MDS, and 12 with MDSeAML to evaluate the efficacy and toxicity of CHG (cytarabine, HHT (2), and G-CSF) induction chemotherapy (low-dose cytarabine, HHT (2) with G-CSF priming) for elderly patients with high-risk MDS or AML transformed from MDS (MDSe AML).

All patients achieved complete remission. 293 A retrospective study on high risk 132 patients with higher risk MDS was done to compare two treatment combination therapy of low-dose CHG and Decitabine. Complete remission was not significantly different between the groups (27.1% with Decitabine vs. 30.6% with CHG). 294 In a clinical study of total of 98 patients at the acute phase of CML with invasive pulmonary aspergillosis (IPA) were treated with Voriconazole plus a low-dose of HHT (2) and IM. This study suggested that this combination could be used as the first-line therapy for IPA patients with CML. 295 The 49 cases in observation group were treated with the combination while the control group was treated with fluconazole, low-dose of HHT (2), and IM. The effective rates of the observation group and the control group were 95.92% and 91.84%, respectively with no significant differences.

The missing C1 carbon atom in aldehyde 134 was introduced by aldol reaction with the lithium enolate of benzyl acetate. Subsequent oxidation of the resulting aldol gave b-keto-ester 135. Formation of ring D was accomplished via Mannich cyclization of N-acyliminium ion 136 and elimination of hydroiodic acid to produce the enone 138. The final compound of this formal synthesis, spiroketone (AE)-139 reported by Hanaoka 96 was isolated after decarbobenzyloxylation followed by Formal synthesis of rac-Cephalotaxine (AE)-(1) by Nagasaka (2002). catalytic reduction. Application of Hanaoka's procedure (3 steps, 34% OY) to complete the synthesis from compound (AE)-139 would provide an access to rac-CET (AE)In 2007, Li developed a formal synthesis of rac-CET (AE)-(1) based on a facile FriedeleCrafts cyclization of the amido-spiro-cyclopentenone precursor 148 mediated by triflic acid (Scheme 9). 97 Reaction of acid chlorides 144 and 145 prepared from homopiperonylic acid 86 and homoveratric acid 143, with proline-derived spirocyclic amino enone (AE)-142, led to the amido spirocyclopentenones (AE)-146 and (AE)-148, respectively. FriedeleCraft cyclization of the methylenedioxy precursor (AE)-146 did not led to compound (AE)-147 under various acidic conditions due to an electron-deficient aryl system. On the contrary, an efficient FriedeleCraft cyclization of the dimethoxy derivative (AE)-148 was observed on treatment with triflic acid yielding Hanaoka's intermediate 98 (AE)-149 isolated in 93% yield. In summary, Li described here a concise formal synthesis of rac-CET (AE)-(1) in 13 steps from L-proline (S)-140 and 4% evaluated OY. 3.2.1.8 Yang and Liu's Formal Synthesis (2009) Yang and Liu reported two strategies to access to intermediate (AE)-148 involving a [2,3]-Stevens rearrangement and an acid lactonization sequence )-146 R = -CH 2 -(\u00b1)-148 R = Me (\u00b1)-147 R = -CH 2 -0% (\u00b1)-149 R = Formal synthesis of rac-Cephalotaxine (AE)-(1) by Li (2007).Cephalotaxus Alkaloids",

For their purpose, introduction of the [ 14 C] label was done by reaction of benzyl chloride intermediate 451 with potassium [ 14 C]-cyanide, a readily available source of carbon-14, yielding compound [ 14 C]-452, followed by transformation into [ 14 C]-tosylate 305. This convergent approach proceeds via two key unlabeled intermediates 304 and 451 synthesized in parallel. Alkylation of spirolactam (\u00c0)-304 with the tosylate [ 14 C]-305 afforded ACD unit [ 14 C]-(\u00c0)-306, which was transformed into radiolabelled [ 14 C]-CET (\u00c0)-(1). Eventually, [ 14 C]-HHT (\u00c0)-(2) was obtained using Robin's protocol by coupling [ 14 C]-CET (\u00c0)-(1) with Robin's acid (\u00c0)-(449) and hydrolysis of the side chain of intermediate anhydroHT [ 14 C] (\u00c0)-(450).21 From piperonyl Synthesis of [ 14 C]-labeled homoharringtonine (\u00c0)-(2) byMarguerit (2015).",
