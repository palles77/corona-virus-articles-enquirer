To achieve these objectives, during the period from late November, 2014, to early February, 2015, working subgroups of Ebola Vaccine Team B experts met regularly via international conference calls to discuss and comment on various issues related to the development and delivery of Ebola vaccines. These discussions led to the release in February, 2015, of a set of recommendations and a draft target product profi le (TPP) for Ebola vaccines. 5 At the time of writing, the Ebola Vaccine Team B is still engaged in constructive assessment and critique of the ongoing development and evaluation of Ebola vaccines. Here we outline key initial recommendations from the Ebola Vaccine Team B, provide an overview of the current Ebola vaccine landscape, discuss recommendations for future consideration, and present the TPP that was developed as part of the initial report. We also provide perspective on how this experience can inform future situations where urgent development of vaccines is needed, and we comment on the role that an independent, expert group such as Team B can have in support of national and international public health authorities toward addressing a public health crisis.",

            "text": "As of August, 2015, only preliminary results of the Guinea study, which is an open-label, cluster-randomised, ring vaccination clinical trial, had been published. 41 In this study, participants were randomly assigned to immediate or delayed receipt of one dose of 2 \u00d7 10\u2077 plaque-forming units (pfu) of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine. On days 3 and 14 post-vaccination, study investigators obtained information about adverse events from participants or their next of kin. After 10 days post-randomisation, no cases of EVD occurred in those who received vaccine as part of the group randomly assigned to receive immediate vaccination compared with 16 confi rmed cases among all eligible persons in the delayed vaccination group. The authors stated this analysis yielded a vaccine effi cacy of 100% (95% CI 74\u00b77-100\u00b70; p=0\u00b70036), based on assessment of 90 case clusters. This value also can be defi ned as a measure of total vaccine eff ectiveness, 48 because it is aff ected by conditions within the two populations, not only by the individuals in those populations. At the cluster level with the inclusion of all eligible participants, the authors estimated the vaccine eff ectiveness as 75\u00b71% (95% CI -7\u00b71 to 94\u00b72; p=0\u00b71791) because six cases of EVD happened in participants who were assigned to the immediate vaccination group but did not receive vaccine (apparently because they did not consent to be vaccinated or consent was not obtained). This value can also be considered a measure of overall eff ectiveness, 48 since the comparison involved all participants (vaccinated and not vaccinated) in the two randomised groups. 43 serious adverse events were reported; one serious adverse event was judged to be causally related to vaccination (a febrile episode in a vaccinated participant, which resolved without sequelae); assessment of serious adverse events is ongoing. Although these results are highly encouraging, because of clustering within the rings, participants are not statistically independent, which could aff ect the precision in this type of study design. 49, 50 Although the authors suggested they accounted for this issue, further data are needed to validate the fi ndings. The ring vaccination approach used in this trial is continuing in Guinea (but without randomisation to delayed vaccination) and, in late August, 2015, was expanded into Sierra Leone. 51, 52 Three other reports have assessed the safety and immunogenicity of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine. 40, 42, 45 In one multicentre study, 13 (25%) of 51 volunteers in Geneva, Switzerland, who were vaccinated with various doses containing at least 1 \u00d7 10\u2077 pfu, had fever and 11 (22%) had reactive arthritis, which led to a pause in the study. 40 The study was resumed using a lower dose of vaccine and a subsequent report noted that reducing the dose of rVSV-ZEBOV to 3 \u00d7 10\u2075 pfu led to lowered antibody responses and did not prevent vaccine-induced arthritis, dermatitis, or vasculitis. 42 A third report involved two phase 1 trials with 26 participants in each (52 total); 40 received an intramuscular injection of the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine at a dose of either 3 \u00d7 10\u2076 pfu or 2 \u00d7 10\u2077 pfu and 12 received placebo. 45 Safety and immunogenicity were assessed for the 28 days after vaccination. No signifi cant safety concerns were identifi ed during the observation period and the vaccine was immunogenic in the participants tested.",

Furthermore, the rVSV-ZEBOV vaccine currently needs storage at -80\u00b0C, which presents logistical challenges for stockpiling and widespread use in remote areas of Africa.",

If an early vaccine shows effi cacy, researchers might be able to identify a correlate of protection for the vaccine. 16 If that correlate of protection is generalisable to other candidate vaccines, later clinical trials could be done using an accepted immunogenicity correlate as an approval endpoint rather than measuring clinical protection in an outbreak or epidemic setting. 16 If no generalisable correlate of protection can be identifi ed, clinical trials with later vaccines are still possible, particularly if evidence (from animal data or other markers) suggests that such vaccines are reasonably likely to predict clinical benefi t or might be superior to the fi rst-generation vaccine. In such situations, clinical trials would likely be done by comparing the new candidate vaccine against the fi rst-generation vaccine. 17, 18 This might apply to the development of future vaccines for other diseases as well, such as malaria and dengue, where second-generation vaccines are compared with partly effi cacious fi rst-generation vaccines. 19 Importance of post-marketing adverse event reporting",

Deployment of Ebola vaccines also should refl ect a rational pricing system. 38 Ideally, a purchase price for Ebola vaccines should refl ect the direct costs to manufacture suffi cient amounts, account for the public and charitable investments in their development, and assume limited ability of aff ected countries to secure funding for vaccine supplies.

            "text": "The Ebola Vaccine Team B has provided an opportunity to discuss and address several crucial issues related to Ebola vaccine development and dissemination. Several key lessons, however, are generalisable to the broader issue of global infectious disease prevention and control. First, the current market-driven approach for vaccine development is not adequate to protect impoverished populations from emerging infectious diseases of epidemic or pandemic potential. Creative funding strategies are needed that ensure vaccines move effi ciently from discovery and research through clinical trials and licensure to manufacturing and delivery, even when ongoing profi tability for vaccine manufacturers is not assured. Second, the west Africa Ebola epidemic illustrates the need for enhanced international coordination and transparency, particularly regarding approval processes for doing clinical trials in developing countries and addressing international regulatory issues for licensure of new vaccines. As part of this process, better preparedness plans need to be in place to address community engagement needs in advance of a crisis situation. Finally, the west Africa Ebola epidemic highlights the need to further strengthen disease surveillance systems in the region as well as in other geographical areas within the continent and globally. At the onset of the Ebola epidemic in west Africa, several Ebola vaccines were in preclinical development, owing to substantial investments by various government agencies, the pharmaceutical industry, and private foundations. Prior work on product development platforms allowed relatively rapid progression to clinical trials for several vaccine candidates, but delivery of effi cacious licensed products to aff ected areas has yet to happen. More rapid effi cacy assessment of these vaccines would have been possible if they had been assessed for initial safety and immunogenicity in phase 1-2 studies before the onset of the epidemic, and if there had been greater consensus before the epidemic on the feasibility and appropriateness of study designs to assess effi cacy. An improved process is needed to identify infectious diseases of epidemic or pandemic potential and to ensure that more robust research is initiated and supported to develop vaccines and other medical countermeasures for such pathogens. The most obvious example is vaccines for emergent novel infl uenza viruses with pandemic potential. Other pathogens of importance include paramyxoviruses, such as Nipah virus and Hendra virus; emergent coronaviruses, such as severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus and Middle Eastern respiratory syndrome coronavirus; other haemorrhagic fever viruses such as Marburg virus, Rift Valley fever virus, and Crimean-Congo haemorrhagic fever virus; emergent enteroviruses, such as EV71, EV68 (or D68), and Coxsackie A16 (or CA16); hepatitis E virus; and chikungunya virus. In addition to research and development, more eff orts are needed to ensure that such vaccines are supported through clinical trials, manufacturing, and delivery to potential at-risk populations.",

First, a Team B can include nongovernmental international experts with a wide range of past experience from the private and public sectors and from academia. In the case of this Team B, the broad range of expertise allowed the group to cover all areas of Ebola vaccine development and deployment. In particular, the participation of African scientists allowed the group to delve into issues specifi c to west Africa and provided a so-called ground zero perspective, which was crucial for the success and credibility of the initiative. Team B staff also contacted additional experts who provided further valuable insights. Government processes, by contrast, might be more limited in engaging partners from the private sector because of the regulatory role that some governmental agencies have, which can generate concerns about potential confl icts of interest. Second, a Team B can be organised quickly and can retain its autonomy. This allows a Team B to generate outputs rapidly because the process does not depend on government or private-sector review or approval and is not hamstrung by issues such as concerns about antitrust (which, for example, could arise with any consortium of pharmaceutical companies). In this situation, the Ebola Vaccine Team B was able to rapidly generate a TPP and share it with the WHO for its future use. Finally, a Team B can be more fl exible and nimble than most government bodies and can respond to a changing landscape more quickly by adjusting programmatic priorities.",

NRA=national regulatory authority. *Optimal and minimal criteria for vaccines to be used in the current epidemic are similar to considerations for vaccines that may be used in future outbreaks or epidemics if a reactive vaccination strategy is employed. Vaccines developed and produced now or in the future may be stockpiled for reactive use in future situations. \u2020Optimally, a vaccine should be available for all age groups; however, some vaccines might not be able to be given to young children because of general reactogenicity or interference with safety or effi cacy of EPI (Expanded Program on Immunization) vaccines. \u2021Ideally, a vaccine will be safe and eff ective in special populations, such as immunocompromised people or pregnant women; however, obtaining effi cacy and safety data for such populations will require special studies that take extensive time to design and conduct; therefore, this feature is not realistic for the current epidemic, but may be a consideration for a future time, if appropriate. \u00a7Initial vaccination of older adolescents and adults is a potentially viable strategy because: this will encompass most high-risk people (eg, health-care workers, Ebola community workers, funeral workers, and in-home care providers as well as many case contacts); the epidemiology of EVD in west Africa indicates that the largest burden of disease occurs in this age group, and by targeting this population, enough herd immunity might be achieved to stop the outbreak when combined with other control measures. \u00b6A tiered strategy targeted initially to health-care workers, adults, and adolescents, then later to children and the elderly over time might be considered (depending on the vaccination strategy), with more than one vaccine product being appropriate for diff erent populations and diff erent usages. ||Safety profi les for vaccines used in an outbreak/epidemic setting might potentially be lower than the safety profi les for vaccines used on a prophylactic basis to prevent endemic disease or future outbreaks, since the risk/benefi ts in the two settings may be diff erent. **A system for grading adverse events is as follows. Grade 1 (mild): symptoms cause no or minimal interference with usual social and functional activities; grade 2 (moderate): symptoms cause greater than minimal interference with usual social and functional activities; grade 3 (severe): symptoms cause inability to perform usual social and functional activities; grade 4 (potentially life threatening): symptoms cause inability to perform basic self-care functions, or a medical or operative intervention is indicated to prevent permanent impairment, persistent disability, or death. \u2020 \u2020Investigators will not be able to determine durability of protection in the current clinical trials; this will require additional observation and follow-up studies. \u2021 \u2021A monovalent vaccine against Zaire Ebola virus is adequate to control the current west Africa epidemic; however, strategic use of a reactive vaccination strategy aimed at controlling future fi lovirus disease outbreaks will likely also require development of monovalent vaccines against Sudan Ebola virus and Marburg virus or a trivalent vaccine against all three pathogens. \u00a7 \u00a7Liquid vaccines are easy to administer because they don't need reconstitution. Lyophilised vaccines may be more temperature stable, but require reconstitution with an appropriate diluent. These two diff erent forms of vaccine each have advantages and disadvantages that will need to be weighed based on conditions in the fi eld, including stability, transport, and disposal constraints. \u00b6 \u00b6Single-dose vials potentially decrease safety risks. Single-dose or low multi-dose vials also decrease vaccine wastage, which is an important factor when considering cost of administration; however, they require increased storage space. The optimal number of doses per vial, therefore, will need to take into consideration fi eld conditions and the vaccination strategy (eg, 50 or more doses per vial may be appropriate for a mass vaccination strategy). ||||Issues around accelerated licensure and expanded access apply predominantly to this epidemic. If the current phase 3 clinical disease endpoint studies are inconclusive, one or more Ebola vaccines could potentially be licensed via FDA's accelerated approval pathway (if correlates of protection are identifi ed) or via FDA's Animal Rule pathway (if correlates of protection cannot be identifi ed). Personal View partners as appropriate. Finally, Team B members might not always have an insider's perspective on information because of a lack of direct involvement with government entities or companies, which can limit the ability to obtain a full and accurate situational assessment.",
