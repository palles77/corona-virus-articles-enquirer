The term \"acute bronchitis\" usually designates an acute respiratory tract infection in which cough, with or without phlegm, is a predominant feature. 1, 2 In the United States, about 5% of adults self-report an episode of acute bronchitis each year, and up to 90% of these persons seek medical attention. [3] [4] [5] In 1997, adults in the United States made more than 10 million office visits for bronchitis. 6 As a result, acute bronchitis consistently ranks among the 10 conditions that account for most ambulatory office visits to U.S. physicians. [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] [11] Most cases of acute bronchitis occur in otherwise healthy adults, in whom this acute cough illness can be called \"uncomplicated acute bronchitis\"; these principles are intended to apply to such patients. The evaluation and management of acute cough illness in patients with underlying chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, or immunosuppression must be tailored in light of the patient's comorbid condition and is outside the scope of this discussion. The background of, rationale for, and methods used to develop these principles are published separately. 12 P R I N C I P L E S",

The predominance of cough and accompanying clinical features suggestive of an acute upper respiratory tract infection, such as sore throat or rhinorrhea, is usually used to distinguish bronchitis from other acute upper respiratory tract infections. 1 As one might expect, clinicians are inconsistent in assigning each diagnosis. 2 For example, some clinicians diagnose acute bronchitis only when productive cough is present; others insist on the presence of purulent sputum.",

However, in the setting of acute cough ( <2 to 3 weeks' duration), the diagnosis of asthma is difficult to establish because many patients with acute bronchitis will have transient bronchial hyperresponsiveness (and abnormal results on spirometry). No guidelines have been established for distinguishing transient from chronic bronchial hyperresponsiveness, and long-term follow-up studies suggest that abnormalities on pulmonary function testing in patients with uncomplicated acute bronchitis typically resolve after 2 to 3 weeks, although they may last as long as 2 months. [15] [16] [17] The diagnosis of cough-variant asthma, in contrast, is generally reserved for patients with persistent cough ( >2 to 3 weeks' duration), lack of wheezing, and (usually) normal results on pulmonary function tests. 18, 19 Cough-variant asthma should be suspected in adults with persistent cough that worsens at night or after exposure to cold or exercise; the diagnosis relies on improvement of symptoms with bronchodilator treatment or a positive result on a methacholine challenge test. Therefore, in the absence of severe airflow obstruction, it is prudent to limit evaluation for possible chronic asthma or cough-variant asthma to patients with cough illness lasting longer than 3 weeks.",

Four prospective studies (1984 to 1990) examined the accuracy of patient history and physical examination for diagnosing radiographic pneumonia in adults with acute respiratory illness in outpatient and emergency department settings, and a clinical decision tool to determine the need for radiography was developed. 20-23 A subsequent validation study done by an independent group of investigators found that the specificity (about 67%) but not the sensitivity (about 75%) of these prediction rules for detecting radiographic pneumonia exceeded that of physician judgment (specificity, 58%). 24 An evidence-and quality-based review of these studies 25 concluded that the absence of abnormalities in vital signs (heart rate \u2265100 beats/min, respiratory rate \u226524 breaths/ min, or oral temperature \u226538\u00b0C) and chest examination (focal consolidation-for example, rales, egophony, or fremitus) sufficiently reduces the likelihood of pneumonia to the point where further diagnostic testing is usually not necessary [A].

Although all of the studies on which this recommendation is based included elderly persons and patients with chronic lung disease, subgroup analyses serology, or polymerase chain reaction. Specific viruses most frequently associated with acute bronchitis include those that produce primarily lower respiratory tract disease (influenza B, influenza A, parainfluenza 3, and respiratory syncytial virus), as well as viruses that more commonly produce upper respiratory tract symptoms (corona virus, adenovirus, and rhinoviruses).

They are recovered more frequently (10% to 20% of cases) in studies of adults with chronic or persistent cough. [39] [40] [41] The diagnoses in these studies are frequently based on serologic conversion, an event that can also occur in asymptomatic persons and may not be related to the clinical illness in question. More recent studies using polymerase chain reaction have reported similar frequencies of recovery of these agents in adults with acute bronchitis. No evidence indicates that Streptococcus pneumoniae, Haemophilus influenzae, or Moraxella catarrhalis produces acute bronchitis in adults without underlying lung disease. Studies reporting an association between these encapsulated bacteria and acute bronchitis have failed to distinguish between colonization and acute infection. Since Gram stain and culture of sputum do not reliably detect M. pneumoniae, C. pneumoniae, or B. pertussis, these tests are not recommended in the evaluation of patients with uncomplicated acute bronchitis.",

[42] [43] [44] [45] [46] [47] [48] [49] [50] By the mid-1990s, published reviews of randomized, placebo-controlled trials 51,52 had concluded that routine antibiotic treatment of acute bronchitis does not have a consistent impact on duration or severity of illness or on potential complications, such as development of pneumonia. Consistent with these conclusions, the U.S. Food and Drug Administration removed uncomplicated acute bronchitis (or \"secondary bacterial infections of acute bronchitis\") as an indication for randomized, controlled trials of antimicrobial therapy in 1998. Since then, three were not performed; a high index of suspicion for pneumonia therefore remains warranted in these patient groups, given the increased likelihood for atypical disease presentation. 31, 32 Conversely, even when vital sign abnormalities are detected in the absence of chest auscultatory findings, chest radiography may not be indicated in patients with other clinical features consistent with a viral illness (such as influenza, parainfluenza, or respiratory syncytial virus) or features that are inconsistent with pneumonia (such as streptococcal pharyngitis or chronic sinusitis). Cough lasting longer than 3 weeks exceeds the case definition for acute bronchitis; such patients should be considered to have persistent cough or chronic cough illness. Irwin and colleagues have developed a welldefined approach to the adult with persistent cough [D]. 13 ",

We reviewed the MEDLINE database (1966 to October 1999) by using Medical Subject Headings and keyword searches that included microbiology and bronchitis and analyzed references from review articles and chapters in textbooks on infectious disease to identify studies of the microbiology of acute bronchitis. We excluded studies involving patients with chronic lung disease, malignant conditions, or immunosuppression, as well as those conducted during confirmed outbreaks of a pathogen (for example, a Chlamydia pneumoniae outbreak at a single university). We limited our selection to English-language studies of consecutive, unselected adolescents or adults enrolled in nonreferral, ambulatory settings. In the mid-1980s, it was established that a specific species of C. pneumoniae (TWAR) could cause uncomplicated acute bronchitis. Therefore, estimates of the proportion of cases with a potential bacterial cause are limited to studies published since this discovery. 33, 34 2.1 As in community-acquired pneumonia, microbiological study of uncomplicated acute bronchitis identifies a pathogen in the minority of cases, ranging from 16% to 40%. 17, [35] [36] [37] [38] This variability is most likely due to the epidemic nature of agents that produce uncomplicated acute bronchitis and limitations in viral and bacterial identification techniques. Noninfectious causes of uncomplicated acute bronchitis, such as occult asthma exacerbation or toxic fume inhalation, should also be considered, although the prevalence of these conditions in adults with acute cough illness has not been well studied.

However, studies to date have been unable to distinguish bacterial bronchitis from viral bronchitis on clinical grounds. Furthermore, the single randomized, placebo-controlled trial in which subgroup analysis of patients with probable mycoplasma infection (based on a single rapid serology test) was done did not find a consistent benefit of antibiotic treatment. However, the sample was fairly small (42 and 49 patients in the placebo and treatment groups, respectively). 43 3.2 The one uncommon circumstance for which evidence supports antibiotic treatment of patients with uncomplicated acute bronchitis is suspicion of pertussis. Selected studies have recovered pertussis in up to 10% to 20% of patients with cough lasting longer than 2 to 3 weeks. 39, 40 Unfortunately, no clinical features allow clinicians to distinguish adults with persistent cough due to pertussis, primarily because pertussis in adults with previous immunity does not lead to the classic features of whooping cough seen in patients (usually children) with primary infection. 56 Therefore, clinicians should limit suspicion and treatment of adult pertussis to adults with a high probability of exposure to pertussis-for example, during documented outbreaks. Antimicrobial therapy for suspected pertussis in adults is recommended primarily to be good and to perform as well as available rapid diagnostic tests for influenza; reported sensitivities of these tests range from 63% to 81%. [67] [68] [69] Reports from the Management of Influenza in the Southern Hemisphere Trialists study, which evaluated neuraminidase treatment of community-acquired influenza, suggest that clinical diagnosis or suspicion of influenza is correct approximately 70% of the time during documented influenza outbreaks. 66 Although this study was not adequately designed to evaluate the true sensitivity or specificity of clinical diagnosis, which would have required measuring the rate of influenza infection in patients in whom it was not suspected, the findings probably accurately reflect clinical practice. Accurate clinical diagnosis of influenza outside the annual outbreak period is more difficult. As a result, diagnostic testing for influenza outside outbreaks, when suspected, may be considered for epidemiologic purposes.",

The first task is to identify which symptoms are most bothersome to the patient. In most cases, cough is the major symptom for which patients seek relief. Randomized, controlled trials have demonstrated a consistent benefit of therapy with albuterol versus placebo for uncomplicated acute bronchitis in reducing the duration and severity of cough (in one study, the \"placebo\" was erythromycin). [70] [71] [72] Approximately 50% fewer patients report the presence of cough after 7 days of treatment. The efficacy of bronchodilators in patients with uncomplicated acute bronchitis makes sense given the frequent finding of bronchial hyperresponsiveness in these patients. The randomized, placebo-controlled trials of albuterol have reported mixed results in identification of subsets of patients most likely to benefit from treatment; therefore, treatment should be individualized in patients without clinical evidence of bronchial hyperresponsiveness (such as wheezing or bothersome cough). 72 3.5 The literature evaluating the efficacy of antitussive treatments is problematic because treatment benefit appears to depend on the cause of the cough illness. Acute or early cough due to colds or other viral upper respiratory tract infections does not appear to respond to dextromethorphan or codeine, whereas chronic cough (duration >3 weeks), cough associated with underlying lung disease, or experimentally induced cough seems to respond to these two agents. In patients with uncomplicated acute bronchitis (in whom the average duration of cough is 2 to 3 weeks), preparations containing dex-tromethorphan or codeine probably have a modest effect on severity and duration of cough. Although evidence from randomized, placebo-controlled trials is lacking, other low-cost and low-risk actions, such as elimination of environmental cough triggers (for example, dust and dander) and vaporized air treatments (particularly in low-humidity environments, such as high altitude) are also reasonable options, given the underlying pathophysiology of uncomplicated acute bronchitis.",
