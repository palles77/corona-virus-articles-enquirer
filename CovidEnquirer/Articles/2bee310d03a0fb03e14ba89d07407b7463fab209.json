Because MERS has no pathognomonic signs distinguishing it from other respiratory infections, cohort B, including 85 samples from acute non-HCoV respiratory infections, was used to assess specificity in acute cases. To further evaluate specificity, cohort C included serum samples from acute to convalescent HCoV-NL63, \uf02d229E, and -OC43 patients. Furthermore, we assessed Cohorts D-G were used to evaluate sensitivity of the different platforms. Serologically identified MERS-CoV-infected mild and asymptomatic persons with camel contact (D1) and healthy donors (D2) from Qatar characterized in an earlier study (1) constituted cohort D. Serial serum samples from 2 RT-PCRdiagnosed MERS-CoV case-patients imported to the Netherlands (2) were used as positive controls and to evaluate antibody kinetics; these were 15 serum samples from patient 1, ranging 4-228 days postdiagnosis (dpd), and 13 from patient 2, ranging 1-44 dpd. These 28 samples were categorized into cohorts E (<14 dpd, acute phase) and F (>14 dpd, convalescent phase).",

We tested serum samples for their neutralization capacity against MERS-CoV (Erasmus MC isolate) by plaque-reduction neutralization test (PRNT) using Huh-7 cells in a 96well plate format. Heat-inactivated samples were 2-fold serially diluted (1:20 up to 1:2560) in RPMI1640 medium supplemented with penicillin, streptomycin, and 1% fetal bovine serum, starting at a dilution of 1:10 in 50 \u03bcL. We added 50 \u03bcL of the virus suspension to each well (500 TCID50) and incubated at 37\u00b0C for 1 h. Following incubation, we transferred the mixtures (virus and serum) on Huh-7 cells cultured in 96-well plates and incubated them at 37\u00b0C for 8 h. We then fixed the cells and stained them with immunofluorescent staining. The serum neutralization titer is the reciprocal of the highest dilution resulting in an infection reduction of >90% (PRNT90). A titer of >20 was considered to be positive.",

The cells were harvested in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100, 50% glycerol, protease inhibitors), and the luminescence units (LU) per \u03bcL was used as a measure of antigen concentration in cell lysates. We conducted LIPS assay according toBurbelo et al. (9)  with minor modifications. Briefly, we diluted serum 1:10 in buffer A (50 mM Tris [pH 7.5], 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2, 1% Triton X-100). Then we incubated a mixture containing 10 \u03bcL of diluted serum and 1\u00d7 107 RLU of Ruc-Ag in a total volume of 100 \u03bcL of buffer A per well at room temperature on a rotary shaker for 1 h. We transferred the mixture containing antigen-antibody complex (100 \u03bcL) into MultiScreenHTS BV Filter Plate (Merck Millipore, https://www.merckmillipore.com) containing 5 \u03bcL of a 30%",
