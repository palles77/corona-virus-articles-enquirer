            "text": "a b s t r a c t Most respiratory tract infections are self-limiting and caused by viruses, and do not warrant antibiotic treatment. Despite this, patients with respiratory tract infections often receive antibiotics, fuelling the rise of antibiotic resistance. Therefore, there is a need to encourage patients to try alternative non-antibiotic therapies, which ideally treat the symptoms and the cause. Lozenges containing amylmetacresol and 2,4-dichlorobenzyl alcohol (AMC/DCBA lozenges) as well as lozenges containing hexylresorcinol have been shown to provide effective symptomatic relief for sore throat. In this study, we investigated whether these lozenges also have virucidal effects in vitro against two viruses associated with respiratory tract infections, parainfluenza virus type 3 and cytomegalovirus. Both viruses were incubated with AMC/DCBA lozenge, placebo lozenge or the active ingredients (AMC/DCBA) as free substances, and parainfluenza virus type 3 was incubated with hexylresorcinol lozenge, placebo lozenge or hexylresorcinol as a free substance. Virucidal effects were observed with the active lozenges and the active ingredients as free substances against both parainfluenza virus type 3 and cytomegalovirus. Mean reductions in viral titre were significantly greater compared with placebo lozenge and peak effects were observed for the shortest incubation time, 1 min. These findings suggest that AMC/DCBA lozenge and hexylresorcinol lozenge have the potential to have local antiviral effects in patients with sore throat due to viral respiratory tract infections. Use of such over-the-counter treatments for self-limiting respiratory tract infections may satisfy patients' desire for an anti-infective medication and reduce the demand for antibiotics.",

In Europe, one-quarter of those who took antibiotics in the last year did so to provide symptom relief, and there remains much consumer confusion about the effects of antibiotics with 49% of Europeans falsely believing that antibiotics kill viruses and 41% believing they were effective against colds and flu (European Commission, 2013) . Physicians respond to sore throat patients' demands (actual and perceived) by prescribing an antibiotic in approximately 60% of cases (Barnett and Linder, 2013; Gulliford et al., 2014) but only about 5-15% of sore throats in adults are caused by a bacterial infection (Shulman et al., 2012 This unnecessary use of antibiotics drives the development of antibiotic resistance (Goossens et al., 2005) , which is an increasingly serious threat to global public health (WHO, 2014) . Therefore, there is a need to encourage patients with RTIs to try alternative treatments, while antibiotics should be reserved for patients with a serious illness or those at increased risk of complications ).",

Locally delivered formats such as lozenges and sprays are useful as they enable active ingredients to reach the site of infection directly; the localized delivery means that side effects are lower compared with systemically acting treatments (Farrer, 2011) . Lozenges containing the antiseptics and local anaesthetics amylmetacresol (AMC) and 2,4dichlorobenzyl alcohol (DCBA) or hexylresorcinol have been developed to treat the symptoms of sore throat (Buchholz et al., 2009; Foadi et al., 2014; McNally et al., 2010 McNally et al., , 2012 Wade et al., 2011) . These lozenges have demonstrated statistically significant reductions in sore throat symptoms in placebo-controlled clinical trials (McNally et al., 2010 (McNally et al., , 2012 Wade et al., 2011) . AMC/DCBA lozenges have demonstrated antibacterial effects in vivo (Richards et al., 1989) and in vitro (Richards and Xing, 1993) .

Upon completion of the contact time, the reaction mixture was immediately mixed (by vortexing) with an equal volume of neutralizer (RPMI medium + 10% newborn calf serum + 1% HEPES + 1% NaHCO 3 for the AMC/DCBA and PIV3 experiments, MEM for the hexylresorcinol and PIV3 experiments and MEM + 10% fetal bovine serum + 1% HEPES + 1% NaHCO 3 for the AMC/DCBA and CMV experiments). The quenched sample was serially diluted 10-fold with dilution medium. Serial dilutions were inoculated onto host cells in a 24-well plate (1 mL inoculum per well, n = 4 per dilution). The inoculated plates were incubated at 36 \u00b1 2\u00b0C in 5 \u00b1 1% CO 2 for 7 days for the AMC/DCBA and PIV3 experiments, 5-9 days for the hexylresorcinol and PIV3 experiments and 14 days for the AMC/ DCBA and CMV experiments. After the incubation period, the titre of infectious virus was determined by TCID 50 assay using the Spearman-Karber formula. The results from the negative control was used as the input viral load and compared with the test substances to evaluate the viral reduction by each test substance. Each experiment (for each test substance, each control and each contact time) was run in triplicate. The mean reductions in viral titre were compared between the test substances and the placebo lozenge using the two-sided Student t-test.",

The virucidal activity of these substances is likely to be due to their effects on viral lipid membranes or protein-lipid interaction (Oxford et al., 2005) . Consistent with this theory, AMC/DCBA lozenge has thus far been shown to exert virucidal activity against enveloped viruses but not as yet against non-enveloped viruses (Oxford et al., 2005) .",

In addition, both lozenges have demonstrated efficacy against sore throat symptoms in clinical trials (McNally et al., 2010 (McNally et al., , 2012 Wade et al., 2011) . Taken together, these data support the use of these lozenges as a first-line treatment for sore throat caused by viral RTIs. Further investigation into the mechanisms of action and the clinical effects of AMC/DCBA and hexylresorcinol for the control of RTIs is warranted. Use of products containing such active ingredients, which not only relieve symptoms but also help treat the infectious cause of RTIs, should help to curb patient demand for antibiotics by satisfying their need for treatment of infection and hence reduce the burden of antibiotic resistance.",
