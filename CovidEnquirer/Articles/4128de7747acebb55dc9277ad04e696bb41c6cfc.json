            "text": "Purpose: The aim of the present work was to develop solid lipid microparticles (SLMs), as dry powders containing quercetin for direct administration to the lung. Methods: Quercetin microparticles were prepared by o/w emulsification via a phase inversion technique, using tristearin as the lipid component and phos phatidylcholine as an emulsifier. The quercetin SLMs were characterised for morphology, drug loading (15.5% \u00b1 0.6, which corresponded to an encapsulation efficiency of 71.4%), particle size distribution, response to humidity, crystallinity, thermal behaviour and in vitro respirable fraction. Furthermore, the toxicity and the in vitro transport of the SLMs on an air liquid interface model of the Calu-3 cell line were also investigated using a modified twin-stage impinger apparatus. Results: Results showed that quercetin SLMs could be formulated as dry powder suitable for inhalation drug delivery (20.5 \u00b1 3.3% fine particle fraction 64.46 lm) that was absorbed, via a linear kinetic model across the Calu-3 monolayer (22.32 \u00b1 1.51% over 4 h). In add ition, que rcetin SLMs were shown to be nontoxic at the concentrations investigated. Interestingly, no apical to basolateral transport of the micronised quercetin was observed over the period of study. Conclusions: These observations suggest quercetin diffusion was enhanced by the presence of the lipid/ emulsifying excipients in the SLMs; however further studies are necessary to elucidate the exact mechanisms.",

            "text": "Quercetin is a flavonoid, a natural substance with a phenolic structure. Flavonoids can be divided into various classes on the basis of their molecula r structure with quercetin belonging to the flavone class, which has a planar structure due to the double bond in the central ring of the 2-phenylchr omen-4-one (2-phenyl-1-benzopyran-4-one) backbone. This flavonoid group can be found in abundance in onions, apples, broccoli, and berries (Nijveldt et al., 2001; Formica and Regelson , 1995 ) . Quercetin pharmacokine tics and bioavailability in humans has previousl y been studied Graefe et al., 2001 ). An important effect of quercetin is its ability to scavenge for oxygen-der ived free radicals (Heijnen et al., 2001 ) , given its antioxidant properties at low concentrations (Robaszkiew icz et al., 2007 ) . Furthermor e, in vitro and in vivo experiments have also shown that flavonoids possess potential anti-inflammatory, anti-allergic , antiviral, anti-carcinogeni c and anti-asthma tic propertie s (Pettinari et al., 2006; Wu et al., 2004; Li et al., 2001; Davis et al., 2008; Gang et al., 2012; .",

Furthermor e, there is evidence that quercetin plays a critical role in the amelioration of the pathogenic process of asthma in a murine model (mice) (Park et al., 2009 ) , due to the alteration of specific cytokine production (Th1/Th2) and transcriptor factors (T-bet and GATA-3) gene expression in OVA-induced asthma model mice, suggesting quercetin could be used as a new therapeutic approach to allergic airway diseases. More recently, when given orally to guinea pigs, quercetin has been found to reduce hyper-reacti vity of airways, one of the main attributes of allergic asthma (Joskova et al., 2011) ; causing significant broncodilation .",

An alternative approach would be to incorporate the drug into a lipid matrix (Li et al., 2009 ) .

There are many advantages in using SLMs (Jaspart et al., 2005 ) , with the most significant being the ability to control release after deposition.

In general the SLMs particles had a spherical morphology and a size in line with particle size analysis, while raw quercetin was columnar in shape and larger than 10 lm. It is important to note that particle size data is represented as volume distribution and makes a series of assumptions (i.e. uniform spheres), while SEM is a 'morphological' techniqu e. This is reflected by the differences observed in particle size when compared with SEM images, where particles appear to have an elongated or plate-like morphology. Particle size distribution for the SLMs was of an appropriate size for respiratory delivery (Patton, 1999 ) and similar to that measured using laser diffraction.",

The enhancement effect achieved by the lipid micropartic les could be traced to a more effective delivery of quercetin to the cells due to increased contact surface between the encapsul ated substance and the cells. In addition, since the lipid microparticles enable slow release of quercetin at the cell surface over time, the extent of decompo sition/oxidativ e degradation is reduced compared to the free drug, which is immediately available.",

The effect of the absorption enhancing non-toxic excipients in increasing the permeabilit y of quercetin has also been highlight ed; making this approach significant, since the raw micronis ed quercetin was not transported across epithelia. To the authors knowled ge no previous studies have investigated quercetin transport mechanis m using Calu-3 cell epithelial monolayer.

Untreated controls and solvent controls were included for each experiment. Plates were incubate d for 72 h at 37\u00b0C in a humidified atmosph ere with 5% CO 2 . Cells were then analysed for cell viability. Briefly, 20 lL of CellTiter 96 \u00d2 Aqueous assay (MTS reagent) (Promega, USA) was added to each well and the plates incubated for 3 h at 37\u00b0C in humidified 5% CO 2 atmosph ere. Absorbance was measured at 492 nm using a POLARstar Optima (BMG Labtech, Offenburg, Germany). The absorbance value was directly proportional to cell viability (%). Data were expressed as % cell viability [(average absorbance of treated wells/avera ge absorbance of control wells) \u00c2 100]. The half maximal inhibitory concentr ation (IC 50 ) values were defined as the drug concentratio n that produces a decrease of 50% in cell viability compared to the untreated control. IC 50 values were calculated by plotting (%) cell viability against the concentratio ns (ng mL \u00c01 ) on a logarithmic scale. Data was fitted to the Hill equation using the General Fit function of KaleidaGraph 4.1 software. Each experiment was performed in triplicate.",
