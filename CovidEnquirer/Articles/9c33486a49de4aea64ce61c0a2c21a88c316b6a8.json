This may also allow to buy time for interventions, such as specific antivirals (and perhaps vaccines) to become available for widespread use [1] . Social distancing on a large scale, first at the epicentre of the outbreak in Wuhan, and later in other locations was shown to slow down SARS-CoV-2 spread (e.g. in Shanghai [2] ).",

They have been shown to explain close contact infectious disease data well [6] [7] [8] . During the A(H1N1)v2009 pandemic, contact survey data were used to reproduce the observed incidence patterns of the emerging outbreak [9] . Hens et al. [10] used social contact data collected in the POLYMOD project [4] to quantify the impact of school closure on the spread of airborne infections. This was done by comparing the basic reproduction number, or the average number of secondary infections caused by a single infectious individual in a completely susceptible population, derived using mixing patterns observed on weekends or during a holiday period with those derived using mixing patterns observed on weekdays. By considering mixing patterns at different locations including or excluding the contribution of some of these locations, social distancing measures can be mimicked and their impact on disease spread can be investigated to potentially guide policy makers.",
