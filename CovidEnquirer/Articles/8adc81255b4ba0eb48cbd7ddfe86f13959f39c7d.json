            "text": "RNA viruses encode an RNA-dependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) that catalyzes the synthesis of their RNA(s). In the case of positive-stranded RNA viruses belonging to the order Nidovirales, the RdRp resides in a replicase subunit that is unusually large. Bioinformatics analysis of this non-structural protein has now revealed a nidoviral signature domain (genetic marker) that is N-terminally adjacent to the RdRp and has no apparent homologs elsewhere. Based on its conservation profile, this domain is proposed to have nucleotidylation activity. We used recombinant nonstructural protein 9 of the arterivirus equine arteritis virus (EAV) and different biochemical assays, including irreversible labeling with a GTP analog followed by a proteomics analysis, to demonstrate the manganese-dependent covalent binding of guanosine and uridine phosphates to a lysine/histidine residue. Most likely this was the invariant lysine of the newly identified domain, named nidovirus RdRpassociated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN), whose substitution with alanine severely diminished the described binding. Furthermore, this mutation crippled EAV and prevented the replication of severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV) in cell culture, indicating that NiRAN is essential for nidoviruses. Potential functions supported by NiRAN may include nucleic acid ligation, mRNA capping and protein-primed RNA synthesis, possibilities that remain to be explored in future studies.",

While nidoviruses constitute a monophyletic group, their genome size differences are striking, with genomes ranging from 13-16 kb for arteriviruses to 20-21 kb for mesoniviruses and 25-34 kb for roniviruses and coronaviruses, which may reflect different stages of the largest genome expansion known to have occurred in RNA viruses (7) .",

Their distinctive transcription mechanism involves the synthesis of a variable set of subgenomic (sg) mRNAs, which are 3 coterminal with the viral genome (reviewed in (9, 10) ). In most nidoviruses, sg mRNAs and genome also share a common 5 leader sequence. The synthesis of sg mRNAs (transcription) and genome RNA (replication) is performed by a poorly characterized replication-transcription complex (RTC) that is comprised of multiple protein subunits (reviewed in (11, 12, 13) ) encoded in two large open reading frames (ORFs), ORF1a and ORF1b, which are translated from the nidoviral genomic RNA ( Figure 1A ). The two polyproteins (pp), pp1a and pp1ab, the latter resulting from ribosomal frameshifting during genome translation, are auto-catalytically processed by multiple cognate proteases, one of which (the 3C-like (3CL pro ) or main (M pro ) protease) is responsible for the large majority of cleavages (14) . Downstream of ORF1b, nidovirus genomes contain multiple smaller ORFs, known as the 3 ORFs (7), which are expressed from the sg mRNAs described above.",

            "text": "During evolution, most conserved proteins of nidoviruses have diverged more extensively than those of organisms of the Tree of Life. In line with the principal function of each region, genome conservation increases from 3 ORFs to ORF1a to ORF1b (7) . Accordingly, the 3 ORF region encodes virion proteins and, optionally, accessory proteins that are predominantly group-or family-specific and mediate virus-host interactions (15, 16) . ORF1a encodes a variable number of proteins that include co-factors of the RNAdependent RNA polymerase (RdRp) and other ORF1bencoded enzymes, three hydrophobic proteins mediating the association of the RTC with membranes and the viral proteases (13, 17, 18, 19) . The latter group includes the 3CL pro , which is the only ORF1a-encoded enzyme conserved in all nidoviruses. In contrast, ORF1b is highly conserved and encodes different RNA-processing enzymes that critically control viral RNA synthesis ( Figure 1B ). These invariantly include the RdRp and a superfamily 1 helicase domain (HEL1), which is fused with a multinuclear Zn-binding domain (ZBD). RdRp and HEL1 are expressed as part of two different cleavage products residing next to each other in pp1ab (8) . The RdRp is believed to mediate the synthesis of all viral RNA molecules, while over the years the unwinding activity of the helicase was implicated in the control of replication, transcription, translation, virion biogenesis, and, most recently, post-transcriptional RNA quality control (reviewed in (20) ). Among the lineage-specific proteins encoded in ORF1b are four enzymes. A 3 -5 exoribonuclease (ExoN, in Coronaviridae, Mesoniviridae and Roniviridae) and an N7-methyltransferase (N-MT, in the Coronavirinae subfamily, Mesoniviridae and Roniviridae) constitute adjacent domains in the same pp1b cleavage product. They were implicated in RNA proofreading (19, (21) (22) and in 5 end cap formation (23, 24) , respectively. Downstream of this subunit, nidoviruses encode an uridylatespecific endoribonuclease of unknown function (NendoU, in Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae) (25, 26) and/or a 2 -Omethyltransferase (O-MT) (in Coronaviridae, Mesoniviridae and Roniviridae), which was implicated in 5 end cap modification and immune evasion (23, (27) (28) (29) . All six ORF1bencoded enzymes have distantly related viral and/or cellular homologs. Additionally, Roniviridae and Arteriviridae encode family-specific domains of unknown origin and function, RsD (30) and AsD (31, 32) , respectively.",

These assignments were fully corroborated by their subsequent biochemical characterization (25) (26) 29, (40) (41) (42) (43) (44) (45) . Furthermore, the (in)tolerance to replacement of active site residues as tested in reverse genetics studies of coronaviruses and arteriviruses in general correlated well with the observed enzyme conservation. Accordingly, the replacement of conserved residues of the nidovirus-wide conserved RdRp, ZBD and HEL1 were lethal (46) (47) (48) , while virus mutants were crippled upon inactivation of ExoN, NendoU or O-MT enzymes (49) (50) (51) , which are conserved in only some of the nidovirus families (30) . This correlation is noteworthy since it coherently links the results of the experimental characterization of a few nidoviruses in cell culture systems to evolutionary patterns that were shaped by natural selection in many hosts over an extremely large time frame. The fact that this correlation is evident for nidoviruses overall, rather than for separate families, indicates that nidovirus-wide comparative genomics provides sensible models to the functional characterization of the most conserved replicative proteins.",

Our extensive bioinformatics analysis revealed a novel domain, encoded upstream of the RdRp domain within the same cleavage product. It is conserved in all nidoviruses and has no apparent viral or cellular homologs, making it a second genetic marker for the order Nidovirales. Based on results obtained using EAV and SARS-CoV, this domain was concluded to have an essential nucleotidylation activity and was named nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase (NiRAN). Its potential functions in nidovirus replication may include RNA ligation, protein-primed RNA synthesis, and the guanylyltransferase function that is necessary for mRNA capping.",

For the Arteriviridae and Coronaviridae families, one representative was drawn randomly from each evolutionary compact cluster corresponding to known and tentative species that were defined with the help of DEmARC1.3 (54) . Twenty nine viruses of the family Mesoniviridae were clustered into six groups, whose intra-and inter-group evolutionary distance was below and above 0.075, respectively. One representative was chosen randomly from each of the six groups. For the Roniviridae family, two viruses, each prototyping a species, were used. To retrieve information about genomes, the SNAD program (55) was used. The final subsets include 30, 5, 10, 6 and 2 sequences representing all established and putative taxa of corona-, toro-, arteri-, mesoni-and roniviruses, respectively (Supplementary Table S1 ).",

We have produced familywide MSAs of nsp12 of coronaviruses, nsp9 of arteriviruses and their counterparts of mesoniviruses and roniviruses, whose borders have been tentatively mapped through limited similarity with known 3CL pro cleavage sites of these viruses (60, 61) . They included NiRAN and RdRp domains delineated as described separately. For simplicity, we will refer to the proteins of mesoni-and roniviruses as nsp12t, with 't' standing for tentative, since the proteolytic cleavage of the replicase polyproteins of these viruses remains to be addressed in detail. Besides NiRAN and RdRp, we have also produced family-specific MSAs of three other nidovirus-wide conserved protein domains: 3CL pro , HEL1 and ZBD. Family-specific MSAs of the Ni-RAN domain were combined in a stepwise manner using the profile mode of ClustalW with subsequent manual local refinement, which was limited and guided by results obtained using HHalign of the HH-suite 2.0.15 software (62, 63) when and if the two programs disagreed. The produced MSAs included one, two, three, four and five (sub)families, respectively, namely: Coronavirinae and Torovirinae (named CoTo), Coronaviridae and Mesoniviridae (CoToMe), Coronaviridae, Mesoniviridae and Roniviridae (CoToMeRo), Coronaviridae, Mesoniviridae, Roniviridae and Arteriviridae (CoToMeRoAr). The final MSA of NiRAN is presented in Supplementary Figure S1 in an annotated format and Supplementary Table S2 in FASTA format. To reveal all local similarities between two MSAs, their profiles were compared using an align routine in HH-suite 2.0.15, whose results were visualized in a dot-plot fashion with the -dthr = 0.25 and -dwin = 10. Statistical significance of similarity was measured using % of confidence and expectation value (E). HH-suite calculates those for the best local hit in an MSA, regardless whether the latter was produced using the local or global mode of the program. Consequently, similarity of global MSAs may be underestimated. Based on family-specific MSAs of NiRAN and Nucleic Acids Research, 2015, Vol. 43, No. 17 8419 RdRp, the secondary structure of these domains was predicted using software Jpred 3 (64) and PSIPRED (65) . In both cases, the sequence with the least gaps was selected from the sequences forming the MSA. The prediction was made only for columns of the MSA in which the selected sequence does not contain gaps. The MSAs were converted into the final figure using ESPript (66) .",

Likewise, the C-terminal part of nsp9/nsp12/nsp12t matched the RdRp profiles of different virus families in PFAM (68) and an inhouse database although this analysis was complicated by the presence of nidovirus sequences in the top-hit PFAM profile (see below).

Peaks of similarity were attributed to the known RdRp motifs G, F, A, B, C, D, E (35), or named and assigned to the newly recognized motifs of NiRAN, preA, A, B and C. Suffix R and N were added to motif labels of the RdRp and NiRAN domain, respectively.

Pairwise patristic distances (PPDs) between viruses were calculated from these trees using R package 'ape' (76) .

For nsp12t, similar conclusions could be drawn although the conservation profiles of these viruses, especially roniviruses, were of lesser resolution due to the overall higher similarity that was the result of the limited virus sampling and divergence. Importantly, also the N-terminal half of nsp9 and nsp12 (NiRAN domain) included a few above-average conservation peaks although the overall conservation was evidently highest around the established RdRp motifs (Figure 2A; Supplementary Figure S2 ). Likewise, NiRAN compared to RdRp accepted two-to-three times more substitutions in four nidovirus (sub)families ( Figure 2B ). In this comparison, slopes of the four PPD distributions were strikingly similar, particularly in the pairs of the Coronavirinae and Torovirinae (60.6 and 60.5, respectively) and the Mesoniviridae and Arteriviridae (67.9 and 68.1).

This MSA of two families was superior compared to each of the two family-specific MSAs with respect to its similarity to the MSA of roniviruses (\u223c54-75% confidence and E = 0.00011-0.00049).

This could be due to the similarity being recognized only in a small C-terminal region. This experience prompted us to compare conserved motifs and predicted secondary structures of the domains of these families ( Supplementary Figures S1 and S2 ). Ten residues were found to be invariant in the conserved NiRAN of the ExoN-encoding nidoviruses. They map to three motifs designated A N (with a K-x Figure S2) . The three motifs are similarly positioned relative to the ORF1a/ORF1b frameshift signal in all nidoviruses, and, importantly, they were aligned in arteriviruses and the ExoN-encoding nidoviruses using HHalign in global mode (Figure 3, rightmost plot) . Specifically, all four invariant residues of motifs A N and B N of ExoN-encoding nidoviruses are also conserved in arteriviruses although with slightly smaller distances separating the two residues of each pair ( Supplementary Figure S1 and Figure 2C ). In the most highly conserved motif C N , the aspartate-phenylalanine dipeptide and likely glycine (the only deviating arginine at this position in the lactate dehydrogenase-elevating virus isolate U15146 may result from a sequencing error) are absolutely conserved among nidoviruses while the other invariant residues of ExoN-encoding nidoviruses appear to have been replaced by similar residues in arteriviruses. Additionally, there is a good agreement between the predicted secondary structure for the domains of arteriviruses and ExoN-encoding nidoviruses, particularly in the area encompassing the three sequence motifs as well as regions immediately upstream of motif A N (named preA N motif) and downstream of motif C N (Supplementary Figure S1 ). In ExoN-encoding nidoviruses, motifs B N and C N are separated by a variable region of 40-60 amino acid residues that does not include absolutely conserved residues, while in arteriviruses motifs B N and C N are adjacent. Based on these observations, we concluded that nsp9, nsp12 and nsp12t contain the NiRAN domain, which is conserved in all nidoviruses, although we acknowledge that the support for the conservation of different motifs between different nidovirus (sub)families is not equally strong. Also, we noted that, at this stage, it was not possible to precisely define the C-terminal border of the Ni-RAN domain. NiIRAN and RdRp may thus, be adjacent or separated by another small domain of variable size in different nidoviruses (Supplementary Figure S2) .",

As a control, we used the HMM profiles of four other domains that are conserved in all nidoviruses, 3CL pro , RdRp, ZBD and HEL1. We expected to find hits to either other nidovirus proteins, if Ni-RAN would have emerged by duplication or non-nidovirus proteins, if the NiRAN ancestor would have been acquired from an external source. None of the database scans involving the NiRAN retrieved a non-nidovirus hit whose E-value was better than 0.065 for HMMER and 1.3 for the HHsearch program from HH-suite ( Figure 4) and none of these hits had sequences similar to the motifs of the NiRAN. In contrast, statistically significant hits with virus and/or host proteins were identified for the nidoviral control proteins either in both or one of the scans; according to annotation, at least some of these hits were true positives in the functional and/or structural sense. Likewise, in scans of the PDB using pGenTHREADER, all top hits for the NiRAN of the four virus families had low support (P = 0.014 or worse) with no match of the conserved motifs. In contrast, top hits for four RdRp queries were supported with P-values of 0.0003 Figure S1) , while the top plot is shown for comparison.

The data were most compatible with the hy-pothesis that this domain is an RNA processing enzyme, in view of (i) the abundance of RNA processing enzymes in the ORF1b-encoded polyprotein ( Figure 1B) ; and (ii) the profile of invariant residues, composed of aspartate, glutamate, lysine, arginine and phenylalanine (and possibly glycine) (Figure 2C ), the first four of which are among the most frequently employed catalytic residues (85) . Since the domain is uniquely conserved in nidoviruses, we hypothesized that its activity might work in concert with that of another, similarly unique RNA processing enzyme. At the time of this consideration, the NendoU endoribonuclease of nidoviruses was believed to be such an enzyme (25) (assessment revised in 2011, (30) ). Consequently, we reasoned that a ligase function would be a natural counterpart for the endoribonuclease (NendoU), as observed in many biological processes, and would fit in the functional cooperation framework outlined in our previous analysis of the SARS-CoV proteome (39) . This hypothesis was also compatible with the predicted \u2423/\u2424 structural organization of NiRAN (Supplementary Figure S1 ) and the lack of detectable similarity between NiRAN and the highly diverse nucleotidyltransferase superfamily, to which nucleic acid ligases belong. This superfamily is known to include groups that differ even in the most conserved sequence motifs, especially in proteins of viral origin (86, 87) . Based on mechanistic insights obtained with other ligases, we expected that the conserved lysine might be the principal catalytic residue of the NiRAN domain.",

Since this protein-NMP is a true, temporarily stable intermediate, it can be readily detected by biochemical methods. In contrast, demonstration of the following two steps, NMP transfer to the 5 phosphate of an RNA substrate and subsequent ligation of a second RNA molecule under release of the NMP, depends on the availability of target RNA sequences whose identification is often not as straightforward. Thus, we first assessed our hypothesis by testing the covalent binding of a nucleotide, known as nucleotidylation.",

Samples were analyzed using denaturing SDS-PAGE to discriminate between covalent and affinity-based nucleotide binding. As can be seen in Figure 5A , we could indeed detect a radioactively labeled product with a mobility comparable to that of nsp9 in the presence of GTP and uridine-5'-triphosphate (UTP). To verify that this labeled band corresponded to a protein and did not result from 3 end labeling of co-purified E. coli RNA or polyG synthesis by the RNA polymerase residing in the C-terminal domain of nsp9, guanylylation was followed by the addition of either proteinase K or RNase T1, which cleaves single-stranded RNA after G residues. As expected, only protease treatment removed the band while incubation with RNase T1 had no effect on the product (Figure 5B) . The same result was obtained after uridylylation using RNase A, which cleaves after pyrimidines in singlestranded RNA (data not shown). Furthermore, as the use of GTP labeled in the \u2425 -position did not result in a radioactive product, we conclude that this phosphate, in agreement with the general nucleotidylation mechanism, is released during the reaction ( Figure 5B ).",

In contrast, we observed no covalent binding with ATP or cytidine-5'-triphosphate (CTP) as substrates (Figure 5A ). The observed substrate preferences are remarkable for two reasons. First, since both UTP and GTP are present in significantly lower concentrations under physiological conditions than ATP (89) and are in general not used as primary energy source, it suggests that the identity of the base, rather than the energy stored within the phosphodiester bonds, may be critical for a subsequent step in the reaction pathway. This implies that reaction pathways other than RNA ligation, which predominantly utilizes ATP, must be considered. Second, the selective utilization of only one pyrimidine and one purine substrate raised questions about the nature and number of active sites involved, for instance, whether both nucleotides bind to separate binding sites or utilize different catalytic residues within the same binding site. Unfortunately, there are no crystal structures for any of the nidovirus nsp9/nsp12/nsp12t subunits available to date, which might have been used to resolve this matter in docking studies.",

Interestingly, while the relative activities below pH 8.5 were identical with both substrates, the relative guanylylation activity was exceedingly higher than uridylylation at a pH above 8.5 (Figure 6A ). To exclude that the observed pattern is due to a difference in the metal ion requirement, we determined the optimal manganese concentration for nucleotidylation with both substrates. As is apparent from Figure 6B , both activities share the same broad optimum between 6 and 10 mM MnCl 2 . This result made it unlikely that manganese oxidation and a concomitant decrease of available Mn 2+ ions, as we observed at a pH above 9.0, would selectively favour the utilization of one of the two substrates. The observed difference between guanylylation and uridylylation with regard to its pH optimum may thus be genuine. For instance, this slightly broadened or--more likely--shifted pH optimum of guanylylation may be the result of a GTP-induced spatial reorientation of amino acid side chains in the vicinity of the catalytic residue and a concomitant alteration of its pK a . Alternatively, it may also be explained by the two substrates using different binding sites. These possibilities were partially addressed in the experiments described in the subsequent sections.",

In agreement with previously published results (78), we found only lysine and tyrosine residues to be modified, as these are thought to provide the chemically most stable bonds. The selectivity of the modification was evident from the fact that only seven lysine and tyrosine residues served as nucleophile for the reaction. Furthermore, we identified all these peptides in independent experiments using FSBG concentrations ranging from 25 M to 2 mM. Within this range, a concentration of 100 M was sufficient to detect all seven peptides. Together this strongly suggests that the reaction with FSBG only occurred after binding to a specific site(s) and did not originate from random collisions. Furthermore, the two modified residues in the EAV RdRp are located in either a predicted \u2423-helix or in a loop not far upstream and downstream of the A R and E R motifs, respectively, which are involved in NTP binding in other, better characterized RdRps. The five modified residues in the EAV NiRAN domain are poorly conserved in related arteriviruses and are located in the vicinity of one of the three major motifs in either a predicted loop region (1 residue) or a \u2424-strand (4 residues). These findings are compatible with the expected properties of the FSBG modification that may label any nucleophile within a 4\u00c5 distance from the NTP-binding site(s). We therefore conclude that the peptides identified in this experiment reflect the presence of a nucleotide binding site within the RdRp required for RNA synthesis and a second binding site that is located in the NiRAN domain, which could serve for nucleotidylation.",

Notably, none of these mutations significantly reduced expression or stability (data not shown), indicating that they are most likely compatible with the protein's structure. Subsequent characterization demonstrated that all conserved NiRAN residues that were probed (Figure 2 , Table 1 ) are important for nucleotidylation activity, as their replacement with alanine led, with the exception of S129A, to a drop to below 10% of wild-type protein activ- ity. In contrast, alanine substitution of a non-conserved Nterminal residue (K106A) as well as of a conserved residue in the RdRp domain (D445A of motif A R ), which is known to be essential for the polymerase activity in other RNA viruses (34) , had only a mild effect, preserving at least 75% of the activity (Figure 7) . Thus, we concluded that the identified sequence motifs in the EAV nsp9 NiRAN domain are functionally connected to the nucleotidylation activity. Whether the decrease in activity was due to a loss of affinity, impairment of catalysis or both remains to be established. In addition, as the level of remaining activity (again with exception of the S129A mutant) did not depend on the substrate used, both guanylylation and uridylylation are likely catalyzed by the same active site.",

Mutant S129A displayed an intermediate activity when using GTP but was almost as deficient as mutants of the nidovirus-wide conserved residues when UTP was used as substrate (Figure 7) . This finding may indicate that S129 is specifically involved in the hydrogen bond network between protein and UTP. Alternatively, as the covalent binding of the nucleotide occurs via a nucleophilic attack on the \u2423-phosphate, this serine may in principle be suitable to play this role. Although to our knowledge nucleic acid ligases typically employ lysine and rarely histidine as catalytic residues (88, 90) , we cannot exclude that uridylylation occurs via this S129 while guanylylation utilizes another amino acid.",

The loss of the radioactive label under acidic or alkaline conditions is an indicator for the type of bond that is formed ( Figure 8A ) (91) . As evident from Figure 8B , the bond between guanosine phosphate and nsp9 was acid-labile but stable under alkaline conditions, which is indicative of a phosphoamide bond originating from either a lysine or histidine. This result was also confirmed for uridylylation (data not shown), excluding a direct role for S129 in the attachment of the uridine phosphate.

We therefore concluded that there is only one active site responsible for nucleotidylation, which allows utilization of both substrates. Interestingly, if this were true, discrimination of GTP and UTP against ATP and CTP would be solely based on the presence of an oxygen at C6 of GTP and C4 of UTP. However, given the pronounced size difference between UTP and GTP, the positions of both substrates within the binding site are unlikely to be equivalent. In principle, two binding scenarios are possible. First, the ribose and phosphate moieties of both nucleotides could occupy the same position within the binding site, for example by forming hydrogen bonds via the ribose's 2 and 3 hydroxyl groups and charge interactions between the protein and the phosphates. Yet, due to the size difference of the bases (pyrimidine vs. purine), any additional interactions between protein and bases would involve different hydrogen bond networks, potentially involving water molecules in the case of the smaller UTP. Alternatively, due to stacking interactions between an aromatic residue of the protein and the bases, uracil and the pyrimidine ring of guanine might occupy equivalent positions. As this would inevitably lead to the relative misplacement of the ribose and phosphates of UTP compared to GTP, the catalytic residue may compensate for the size difference by re-adjusting and attacking the \u2424instead of the \u2423-phosphate of UTP.",

The nucleotide-protein bond was subsequently broken by lowering of the pH and the released nucleotide was analyzed by thin layer chromatography. While nsp9 incubated with GTP clearly released significantly more of the expected guanosine-5'-monophosphate (GMP) in an acidic environment than under alkaline conditions, the results after uridylylation were not as conclusive. Although also in this case the monophosphate was released after HCl treatment, the intensity did not match that of GMP and a sec-ond product was present in higher quantities ( Figure 9A ). This may indicate that uridine-5'-monophosphate (UMP) is either further hydrolyzed under these conditions or that in fact a UMP-protein adduct is only the minor product after uridylylation. Therefore, it remains unclear whether the binding of UTP indeed forces an attack of the \u2424-phosphate. To exclude that the observed GMP release is caused by the treatment with HCl, control samples lacking nsp9 were also investigated. As expected this did not result in a product with equivalent mobility to GMP ( Figure 9B ).",

As expected for such conserved residues, most alanine substitutions were either lethal for the virus or resulted in a severely crippled virus that reverted, thus confirming the essential role of the nucleotidylation activity during the viral replication cycle. Similarly, also replacement of a conserved aspartate in motif A of the downstream RdRp domain, which is known to be required for the activity of polymerases in other (+) RNA viruses (34) , was tolerated in neither EAV nor SARS-CoV. Notable exceptions to this general pattern, in addition to the replacements of non-conserved lysine residues included as controls, were the T123A and F219A mutations in SARS-CoV nsp12. These mutations were stably maintained although they produced a mixed plaque phenotype comprising wild-type-sized and smaller plaques, with F219A also demonstrating a markedly lower progeny titer (at least two logs reduced) than the wild-type control ( Figure 10 ). The reason for this differential behavior of these two SARS-CoV mutants in comparison to those of EAV is unclear at the moment.",

As in most prior studies of nidoviral replicative proteins, this identification was initiated by comparative genomics analysis. Unlike all other nidovirus enzymes, however, NiRAN was found to have no appreciable sequence similarity with proteins outside the order Nidovirales. Even the similarity between the arteriviral NiRAN and that of other nidoviruses was found to be marginal. These results suggested that NiRAN either is a unique enzyme specific to nidoviruses or has diverged from its paralogs beyond recognition, i. e. to an extent that cannot be ascertain by even the most powerful HMM-based tools currently available. The latter possibility is not merely hypothetical given that five out of the seven amino acid residues that are evolutionary invariant in the NiRAN domain belong to the most common residues found in proteins. We expect this uncertainty to be resolved in the future when the sampling of nidoviruses will be expanded, sequence profile techniques will be further advanced, and tertiary structures of the proteins analyzed in this study may become available. Besides technical challenges in the identification of Ni-RAN, this domain also stands out for its properties that are indicative of an unknown but critical role in nidovirus replication (see below). NiRAN is the only ORF1b-encoded domain that is located upstream of the RdRp and resides within the same non-structural protein. This implies that NiRAN may influence the folding of the downstream RdRp domain. It would be reasonable to expect cross-talk between these domains, potentially coupling the reactions and processes they catalyze. Thus, NiRAN is a prime candidate regulator and/or co-factor of the RdRp, a property that should be taken into account in future experiments aiming at the characterization of the RdRp or reconstitution of RTC activity in vitro.",

This parallel is most notable because of the much higher divergence of the NiRAN sequence compared to the RdRp. Also, the significance of Ni-RAN for virus replication must be different from that of NendoU, the only other ORF1b-encoded enzyme that has been probed extensively by mutagenesis in reverse genetics in both corona-and arteriviruses (25, 50, 92) . Two of those studies revealed that EAV and mouse hepatitis virus (MHV) NendoU mutants with replacements in the active site were stable and in the latter case even displayed similar plaque phenotypes as the wild-type virus while being only slightly delayed in growth (50, 92) .",

Nucleotidylation was most pronounced with UTP as substrate but was also observed with GTP ( Figure 5A ).

Consequently, only the free nsp9 must have been available for nucleotidylation by its NiRAN domain using radioactive GTP/UTP. The nucleotidylated fraction of the total protein pool depends on many factors, including the adduct's stability, and remains unknown. However, this uncertainty does not undermine the validity of the established nucleotidylation activity of nsp9, given the specificity and selectivity documented here, which were determined using different techniques and various controls to arrive at a consistent set of properties of the enzyme. Combined, the results of our biochemical and bioinformatics analyses assigned nucleotidylation activity to the NiRAN domain beyond a reasonable doubt. To rationalize the protein's ability to bind nucleoside phosphates covalently, future studies may focus on the role of protein-nucleoside adducts as reaction intermediates for possible downstream processes, three of which are discussed below.",

Since phenylalanine would most likely interact with the nucleotide substrate by base stacking, its contribution in terms of binding energy would be one order of magnitude lower than that of electrostatic interactions of lysine/arginine with the phosphates (94) . Based solely on this consideration, F166 could be expected to be of 'lesser' importance than the basic residues. However, this was apparently not the case since the replacement of the aromatic residue with alanine was lethal for EAV while substitution of either of the basic residues led to a low level of replication that eventually facilitated reversion (Table 1 ). All these substitutions require two nucleotide point mutations to revert back to wild-type, which should be an extremely rare event during a single round of replication. Consequently, the non-viable phenotype of the F166A mutant may hint at a lower tolerance of single-nucleotide partial revertants (F166V or F166S) in comparison to those originating from K94A (K94T or K94E) and R124A (R124P or R124G). Alternatively, the observed non-viable F166A phenotype may be explained by a vital interaction between NiRAN and RdRp or other proteins involving F166. In contrast to EAV, the homologous residue in SARS-CoV nsp12, F219, appeared to be less essential since its replacement merely reduced progeny titers and altered the plaque phenotype, while the nucleotide changes were maintained. At present, the exact reason for this difference between EAV and SARS-CoV is unclear, but it suggests that the role and/or regulation of this conserved phenylalanine may have evolved in these distantly related nidoviruses, whose NiRAN domains are of strikingly different sizes; such evolution has parallels in other enzymes (95) .",

The conserved serine/threonine of motif B N could be a candidate as substitution of this serine in EAV nsp9 (S129) was the only mutation that had a differential effect on guanylylation and uridylylation ( Figure 7) . Finally, in agreement with observations for other nucleotidylate-forming enzymes (96) (97) (98) , also nsp9 nucleotidylation is metal-dependent ( Figure 5B ), poten-tially due to an important role for metal ions in coordination of the triphosphate or charge neutralization of the pyrophosphate leaving group. In our in vitro system it was Mn 2+ rather than the most common divalent cation Mg 2+ that supported nucleotidylation activity when tested over a wide concentration range. We propose that at least one of the three acidic conserved residues (E100, D132 and D165 in EAV nsp9) is directly involved in the binding of this essential manganese ion(s). Since the concentration of this cation in cells is lower than that required to observe nucleotidylation in vitro, we cannot exclude the possibility that another co-factor or substrate modulates this property of the enzyme in vivo, and/or that another metal ion is used.",

It was reasoned that, in the context of nidovirus replication, such an activity could be the functional complement of the NendoU endoribonuclease (7) . Moreover, at that time both enzymes were considered to have been conserved across all taxa during evolution of the nidovirus lineage. However, it recently became clear that NendoU is conserved only in nidoviruses infecting vertebrate hosts. Consequently, our original hypothesis would not explain why this putative ligase would be conserved in roni-and mesoniviruses, which do not encode the endoribonuclease. Another complication regarding that original hypothesis has emerged from the present study, which identified NiRAN as being UTP/GTP-specific. Although the hydrolysis of all NTPs results in the release of the same amount of energy, ATP-dependent RNA ligases dominate the ligase family. It would therefore be surprising, if nidoviruses encoded a ligase that strongly discriminates against ATP. To our knowledge the GTP-specific tRNAsplicing ligase RtcB is the only currently known example of a protein involved in nucleic acid strand joining exhibiting this kind of substrate specificity (90) . Furthermore, thus far no substrates that would require a ligase function were identified in nidovirus replication, which however remains poorly characterized in general.",

Intriguingly, three of the four enzyme activities required for cap formation and modification, namely an RNA-triphosphatase and two methyltransferases, have been identified in coronaviruses (44, 100) , with the missing activity being the GTase. Furthermore, recent characterization of EAV nsp10 in our lab (unpublished data) showed that it resembles its coronavirus homolog in terms of possessing RNA-triphosphatase activity, which is required prior to GTase activity in the conventional capping pathway. In line with these findings, experimental evidence supporting the presence of a cap structure on genomic RNA was reported for three very distantly related viruses of the Nidovirales order, namely for MHV (Coronavirinae) (101), Equine torovirus (Torovirinae) (102) and Simian hemorrhagic fever virus (Arteriviridae) (103) . Importantly, the known GTases of (+) RNA viruses, flavivirus NS5 (104), alphavirus nsP1 and orthologous proteins (97, 105) , do neither share conserved features nor do they resemble host GTases. Thus, the possibility of NiRAN being a cap-synthesizing GTase could be reconciled with our current knowledge of the structural and sequence diversity of this class of enzymes. This cannot be said, however, about NiRAN's substrate preference for UTP over GTP, which has not been reported for GTases mediating cap formation.",

This strategy is used by many viruses including the large group of picornavirus-like viruses, which notably have evolutionary affinity to nidoviruses (35, 36) . In these viruses, a nucleotide is covalently attached to a protein that is commonly known as VPg (viral protein genome-linked), which may then be extended to a dinucleotide. This dinucleotide is subsequently base-paired to the 3 end of the viral RNA where it serves as primer for the synthesis of the complementary RNA strand (106) . Interestingly, the first nucleotide of the EAV genome is a G while the 3 end is equipped with a poly(A) tail. Thus, the dual specificity of nsp9 for GTP and UTP would be compatible with the different requirements for the initiation of the synthesis of genomic and subgenomic RNAs of positive and negative polarity, respectively.

First, to our knowledge, all currently described nucleotide-VPg bonds are realized via the hydroxyl group of either a tyrosine or a serine/threonine (107) (108) (109) (110) (111) , while NiRAN most likely uses the invariant lysine residue (Figure 8 ). This problem could be resolved if NiRAN assumes the role of the RdRp of VPg-encoding viruses and transfers the bound nucleotide to another protein that subsequently serves as VPg. Second, at least for coronaviruses, the VPg-based mechanism would not be compatible with the previously proposed primase-based mechanism (112) for the initiation of RNA synthesis. However, the latter mechanism remains tentative since it assigns primase activity to a protein complex that, according to a recent study (84) , may merely be a processivity co-factor for the nsp12 RdRp. Finally, as mentioned before, the mRNAs of several nidoviruses were concluded to be capped at their 5 end, a modification that is not observed in known VPgutilizing viruses. To use both VPg priming and capping, it would be necessary to actively or passively remove the attached protein in order to allow mRNA capping to commence. This sequence of events would constitute a novel, and perhaps unlikely, variant of the capping pathway, as the RNA's 5 end would not be di-or triphosphorylated after VPg removal, a requirement for entering any of the known viral capping pathways (99) . Thus, if NiRAN would be part of a VPg-utilizing mechanism, this might differ considerably from those currently described and could possibly also vary among nidoviruses.",

Genomes of other nidoviruses employ similar organizations while they may vary in respect to size of different regions and number of 3 ORFs. RFS, ribosomal frameshift site. (B) ORF1b size and domain comparison between the five nidovirus (sub)families is shown for EAV (Arteriviridae), Cavally virus (CAVV, Mesoniviridae), Gill-associated virus (GAV, Roniviridae), Breda virus (BRV-1, Torovirinae) and Severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (SARS-CoV, Coronavirinae); see Supplementary Table 1 for details regarding these viruses. NiRAN, nidovirus RdRp-associated nucleotidyltransferase; RdRp, RNA-dependent RNA polymerase; ZBD, Zn-binding domain; HEL1, helicase superfamily 1 core domain; ExoN, exoribonuclease; N-MT, N7-methyltransferase; NendoU, nidovirus uridylatespecific endoribonuclease; O-MT, 2 -O-methyltransferase; AsD, arterivirus-specific domain; RsD, ronivirus-specific domain. Depicted is a simplified domain organization since most enzymes are part of multidomain proteins. Note that viruses of the Torovirinae subfamily encode a truncated version of N-MT. Triangles, established cleavage sites by 3CL pro in two virus (sub)families; ORF1b-encoded proteins of other viruses may be proteolytically processed in a similar way. The order of emergence of different nidovirus (sub)families is presented by a simplified tree on the left.",

(A) Sequence variation, domain organization and secondary structure of the RdRp-containing protein of arteriviruses, and location of peptides identified by mass spectrometry after FSBG-labeling of arterivirus nsp9. Shown is the similarity density plot obtained for the multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of proteins including NiRAN and RdRp domains of arteriviruses. To highlight the regional deviation of conservation from that of the MSA average, areas above and below the mean similarity are shaded in black and grey, respectively. Uncertainty in respect to the domain boundary between NiRAN and RdRp is indicated by a dashed horizontal line. Positions of conserved sequence motifs of NiRAN and RdRp are indicated by vertical shading areas; motifs are labeled. Below the similarity density plot, secondary structure elements, predicted based on the arterivirus MSA using PSIPRED (PSIPRED A) and Jpred 3 (JPRED A), are presented in grey for \u2423-helices, black for \u2424-strands. (B) Relative scale of divergence of NiRAN versus RdRp in four different nidovirus (sub)families. Shown is scatter plot of PPDs of the NiRAN (y-axis) versus PPDs of RdRp (x-axis), which were calculated from the respective four PhyML trees. Dashed lines depict linear regressions fit in four differently highlighted PPD distributions, with its detail being magnified in the zoom-in; R 2 and slope values of the regressions are listed in the inset panel. The solid diagonal line corresponds to the matching rate of PPDs for the two domains and is provided for comparison. (C) MSA of the three conserved NiRAN motifs of eight representative nidoviruses and their predicted secondary structures. Absolutely conserved residues are in white font, while partially conserved residues are highlighted. Secondary structure predictions were made with PSIPRED (64) based on arterivirus (PSIPRED A) or coronavirus (PSIPRED C) MSAs. Residues mutated in recombinant SARS-CoV (Coronaviridae) non-structural protein (nsp) 12 and recombinant EAV (Arteriviridae) nsp9 are indicated by filled (conserved) and empty (control) circles, above and below the alignment respectively. Mutated residues D445A in EAV and K103A, D618A in SARS-CoV are not shown. Amino acid numbers above and below the alignment refer to SARS-CoV nsp12 and EAV nsp9, respectively.
