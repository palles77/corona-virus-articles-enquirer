            "text": "and coauthors. 7 This approach involves listening to children's concerns and helping them to understand that they have rights-but that other people have rights as well and that these rights go hand in hand with respect and responsibilities. UNICEF 8 and the Roots of Empathy programme 9 have developed guidance to help teachers working with these themes in school. Mass entertainment or edutainment programmes could help young people to modify their attitudes and behaviour-eg, in southern Africa the programme Soul City tackles the problems of coercive sex, teenage rape, 10 and domestic violence, which young people too readily accept as just part of life. 11 Population pressures are likely to increase the risks of child maltreatment, particularly in developing countries. Climate experts question whether the world can sustain current levels of consumption and the projected population increase. 12 To improve quality of life and reduce maltreatment in all its manifestations, child-health professionals should advocate not only for the Millennium Development Goal of child survival but also for family planning services, which currently are inaccessible to millions of couples. 12 Children who are wanted and planned according to parental and environmental resources must surely have a better chance of enjoying their childhood free of maltreatment or neglect. Despite China's rapid economic development since 1978, when the country embarked on a transformation from a planned economy to a market economy, a health-care crisis has been looming in the country. The outbreak of severe acute respiratory syndrome, the increasing incidence of sexually transmitted diseases including HIV/AIDS, constant threats of an avian infl uenza pandemic, and the recent milk scandal serve as reminders of the complex challenges confronting China's defi cient and vulnerable health system and the serious economic, social, and global implications of the system's shortfalls. China's leaders, in their pursuit of an economic growth-dominated development agenda, have neglected the Government's responsibilities to adequately fi nance, organise, and regulate health care. The general complaint that it was \"Too diffi cult to see a doctor, too expensive to see a doctor!\" became one of the top issues in China's opinion polls. 2, 3 Out-of-pocket payments have soared more than tenfold since 1990. Now, the average cost of a single hospital admission is almost equivalent to China's annual per-capita income, and is more than twice the average annual income of the lowest two deciles of the population. 4 Meanwhile, only 55% of urban and 21% of rural populations have any health insurance. 4 Unsur prisingly, 13\u00b78% of urban and 15\u00b78% of rural households incurred catastrophic medical spending in 2003. 4 Further, 15\u00b71% of urban residents and 21\u00b76% of rural residents, when they were ill, forewent medical care because they could not pay. 5 Despite increasing costs, the Government's health budget accounts for less than 10% of the actual costs of public hospitals. China's fee-for-service payment system exacerbates cost escalation: doctors have strong fi nancial incentives to overprescribe because they rely on service revenue and drug sales for their income. Moreover, in view of the low level of professional ethics, there is a widespread belief that health-care providers put fi nancial interests ahead of the patients' medical needs. 6 Mistrust is the major reason for the worsening relationship between patients and doctors.",

In Bangladesh, neonatal mortality accounts for 45% of the mortality in children in this age band. 11 The Projahnmo Study Group, led by Abdullah Baqui, reports a complex intervention that decreased neonatal mortality by one-third. 11 Such eff orts have helped to reduce annual worldwide mortality in under-5-year-olds from nearly 13 million in 1990 to less than 10 million in 2007. 12 Cigarette consumption in China exceeded 2000 billion in 2006 and is increasing. 13 In addition, indoor cooking fi res are common in rural areas. As a result of these risk factors, COPD is predicted to cause 65 million deaths in China between 2003 and 2033. 14 Hence, the work of Zhong and colleagues showing that carbocisteine can reduce exacerbations and improve quality of life at a relatively modest price has important implications for treating COPD in developing countries.",
