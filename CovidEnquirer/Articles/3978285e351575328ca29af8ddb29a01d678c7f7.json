In previous studies, FT was measured by different methodologies that required physical contact with the forehead. Nearly all studies found that FT was not accurate enough for fever detection. [4] [5] [6] [7] [8] [9] [10] For the same surface temperatures detected by electronic thermometers, the discrepancies of surface temperatures detected by the 3 HITs could be as high as 2\u00b0C (3.6\u00b0F). Such discrepancies could lead to inaccurate and misleading recordings during disease surveillance. Institutions using similar equipment for fever screening should check the offsets before introducing them to clinical usage because each HIT may have a unique offset (Fig 1) . The problems with the inaccurate readings in our study were not likely because of observer error because a single observer was deployed in this study. Hence, our study data suggested that the current brand of HIT was not accurate enough for clinical purpose. Further improvement in the quality of the product is required, and other similar HITs for assessment of FT require further studies.",

Conclusions: Our study shows that commercially available, handheld infrared thermometers require individual validation. Forehead temperature in excess of 35.6\u00b0C is suggestive of fever. Further studies are required to confirm accuracy of this value in detecting fever. (Am J Infect Control 2005;33:227-9.)",
