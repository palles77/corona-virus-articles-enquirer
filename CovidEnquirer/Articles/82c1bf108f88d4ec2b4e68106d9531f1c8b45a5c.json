In this study, we aimed to develop a pipeline that would detect putative non-96 coding pathogenic mutations in a small family. We present a pilot study 97 performed in a five member family with two siblings affected by cone dysfunction The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. Whole exome sequence data was analyzed in house 43 and whole genome data 178 was analyzed in collaboration with the Broad Institute of MIT and Harvard using 179 methodology described previously 20 . Briefly, BWA was used for alignment.",

We found 224 IRD genes to 307 be expressed in HNR (TPM>1). Interestingly we were able to detect expression Table S4 ). Since IRD genes were very 316 poorly represented in the blood samples, we excluded blood from further 317 analysis. 318 We next examined the complexity of the HNR, RO and skin transcriptomes, In order to find the underlying genetic cause of the retinal degeneration in OGI-338 081 affected patients, we conducted differential splicing and gene expression 339 analyses of the RNA-seq data obtained from day 160 ROs of affected versus 340 unaffected siblings. The differential splicing analysis was conducted with CASH 341 51 and MAJIQ 52 algorithms, and we used edgeR algorithm 53 for differential gene 342 expression. CASH detected 106 differential splicing events in 101 genes (Table   343 S6), while MAJIQ detected 522 differential splicing junctions in 260 genes ( Table S8 ). Given such large distances, it is not likely that these variants 353 could cause the alternative splicing events. Moreover, the differential gene 354 expression analysis did not find the NCALD gene to be differentially expressed 355 between the affected and unaffected siblings (Table S9) . Taken together, these 356 results indicate that the NCALD gene variants are most likely not the genetic 357 cause for the disease phenotypes observed in OGI-081. 358 We next examined the CNGB3 gene locus. Based on segregation in the family, However, contrary to our expectations, CNGB3 expression was not significantly 379 down regulated in our RNA-seq dataset, as analyzed using the edgeR program. Interestingly, exon 14b ASS is a stronger than the one located at exon 15 (Table   424 2). It is plausible that the availability of this acceptor site and its ability to compete the authors used \uf044 Score greater than or equal to 0.2, 0.2, and 0.5 respectively.",

For one, non-coding variants are present at much 25 higher number in the genome than coding variants. In addition, our26    understanding of the rules that govern the non-coding regions of the genome is 27 less complete than our understanding of the coding regions. Methods that allow 28 for both the identification of candidate non-coding pathogenic variants and their 29 functional validation may help overcome these caveats allowing for a greater 30 number of patients to benefit from advancements in genetic therapeutics. We31 present here an unbiased approach combining whole genome sequencing 32 Introduction 38 Inherited retinal degenerations (IRDs) are a leading cause of blindness, 39 altogether affecting >2million people worldwide. IRDs are characterized by 40 progressive degeneration of photoreceptor and/or retinal pigment epithelial 41 (RPE) cells of the retina with variable age of onset and rates of degeneration 1 . 42 Despite tremendous ongoing efforts and research into various therapeutics, 43 treatments for IRDs remain limited. Currently there are two regulatory agency-44 approved treatment approaches, retinal prosthesis implants and gene 45 augmentation therapy for IRD caused by mutations in the RPE65 gene 1-7 . The 46 eye is a prime candidate for gene therapy approaches due to its relative immune-47 privilege, surgical accessibility and ease of non-invasive monitoring. In addition, 48 IRDs are Mendelian disorders caused by mutations in single genes in the vast 49 majority of cases. Owing to these favorable circumstances several gene/genetic 50 therapy clinical trials have been initiated for IRDs, including those caused by 51 mutations in the ABCA4, CEP290, CHM, CNGA3, CNGB3, MYO7A, RPGR, 52 RS1, and USH2A 6 . 53 As each genetic therapy targets a specific gene, for a patient to be considered for 54 treatment they must obtain a reliable genetic diagnosis. Difficulties inherent to 55 genetic diagnostics are rooted in the fact that every individual carries millions of 56 DNA variants in their genome 8,9 . The large majority of the DNA variants are 57 found in non-coding regions of the genome such as intergenic and intronic 58 regions. Since non-coding sequences can better tolerate sequence variation depend on the availability of large, publicly available RNA-seq 82 datasets and/or on a large cohort of patients. They also require biopsy samples 83 from a clinically relevant tissue or cell type. Both gene expression and splicing 84 are tissue-specific 22,23 owing to restricted availability of transcription and splicing 85 factors with variable usage of regulatory DNA sequences 24-27 . Consequently, 86 DNA variants in such regulatory sequences can have tissue-specific outcomes 87 on gene expression and splicing 18,28 . Thus, analyzing RNA from a clinically 88 relevant tissue or cell type is crucial to obtain a more focused and reliable 89 diagnostic result. When a clinically relevant tissue is not accessible, ex vivo 90 surrogate models can sometimes suffice. Indeed, a study aimed at discerning the 91 genetic causality of patients with monogenetic neuromuscular disorders found 92 that t-myotubes, skeletal myotubes derived by myoD overexpression in 93 fibroblasts, accurately reflected the muscle transcriptome and faithfully revealed 94 pathogenic variants 29 .95",

Both affected patients had nystagmus and decreased vision from 238 infancy and at age 8, OGI-081-197 was also noted to have photophobia. Visual 239 acuity for both affected patients measured 20/150-200 and remained stable for 3 240 years. Full field electroretinogram (ffERG) testing of retinal function for OGI-081-241 197 was significant for reduced and delayed cone photoreceptor responses, with 242 normal rod photoreceptor response amplitudes. Optical coherence tomography 243 (OCT) imaging of the retina showed retinal degenerative changes in the fovea 244 (Figure1b). In addition to their retinal disease, both affected patients were found 245 to have Chiari malformations. Interestingly, vision phenotypes such as 246 photophobia, vision loss and nystagmus have been reported as accompanying 247 symptoms in some forms of Chiari malformations 57-60 . Unfortunately, despite 248 evidence that Chiari malformations have a hereditable component 61-63 , the 249 genes involved are not yet well defined 59,64,65 . For that reason we could not rule 250 out the possibility that the vision phenotypes and Chiari malformations share a 251 common genetic causality. 252 The phenotypes segregation in OGI-081 is indicative of a recessive mode of 253 inheritance. Thus, for genetic testing we searched for genes that have putatively 254 pathogenic variants in both alleles (Figure1a). Selective exon capture based . Since this did not identify a clear cause of disease, whole exome 257 sequencing (WES) for the five members of the family was performed. Both the 258 GEDi testing and WES identified a single rare variant in the CNGB3 gene 259 (c.1148delC, p.Thr383IlefsTer13) which has been reported to be pathogenic 66-68 , 260 but a second rare variant in CNGB3 was not identified, nor were other potential 261 causative genetic variants forthcoming for the two affected members of the 262 family.

Since it has been proposed 268 that up to 1 in 4-5 individuals in the general population may be a carrier of null 269 mutations in IRD genes 71 it was possible that the presence of variant 270 p.Thr383IlefsTer13 was an incidental finding.",

To test these hypotheses, we performed both whole genome 277 sequencing (WGS) and RNA-seq analysis of a surrogate retinal tissue to DNA variants detected by WGS identified 3268 segregating rare 281 variants that could be sorted into 8191 allelic pairs in 642 genes (TableS3).

These two frame shift alleles are predicted to384 encode truncated proteins. The protein encoded by the exon 14b including 385 isoform is predicted to maintaining a full transmembrane domain but lack the 386 ligand binding domain of CNGB3 (Figure 5c). Similarly, the protein encoded by 387 the isoform carrying the known pathogenic variant c.1148delC; 388 p.Thr383IlefsTer13 is predicted to have a truncated transmembrane domain in 389 addition to lacking the ligand binding domain (Figure 5c). In order to determine 390 whether the truncated CNGB3 proteins are being translated, we performed segments in chicken and mice 76,77 . We have also validated 395 the localization of human CNGB3 to cone photoreceptor outer segments in the 396 human retina (Figure S2). We therefore immunostained ROs for CNGB3 and ML 397 opsin, the latter serving as a marker for photoreceptor outer segments. For these 398 studies, stage 3 ROs were kept in culture for a total of 262 days, allowing cones 399 full opportunity to mature and localize ML opsin and CNGB3 to the photoreceptor 400 outer segments. As expected, CNGB3 co-localized with ML opsin in cone 401 photoreceptor outer segments in the parent (Figure 6c), with weaker staining 402 observed in inner segments as well (Figure 6b&c), presumably due to 403 mislocalization of truncated CNGB3 protein produced by the exon 14b including 404 allele. In ROs from the affected sibling, where both alleles are predicted to result 405 in truncated proteins, CNGB3 was only observed diffusely in the cell body and in 406 inner segments; i.e., no co-localization with ML opsin was observed in cone 407 photoreceptor outer segments (Figure 6e&f).

These studies relied on 479 the availability of large control datasets of RNA-seq samples from unaffected non-coding variants is possible without reliance on such resources. 482 WGS analysis of all five members of OGI-081 and segregation analysis of the 483 variants within the family narrowed down the search from tens of thousands of 484 variants to a few hundred with allelic pairs. We then used RNA-seq analysis 485 comparing two affected siblings to an unaffected one as an orthogonal approach 486 to identify genes with altered splicing or expression in disease. Thus identifying 487 the deep intronic variant chr8:g.87618576G>A as a novel pathogenic variant in 488 the CNGB3 gene. The iPSC derived ROs served both as a source of disease 489 relevant transcriptome and as a system for functional validation of the truncated 490 proteins. In future studies, for families with a single patient the parents may serve 491 as control samples, so that each parent controls for the effect of the allele 492 inherited from the other parent making our approach applicable even for ultra-493 rare diseases. 494 Once the deep intronic variant was detected and validated we were able to use 495 that prior knowledge to identify additional factors that may have contributed to the 496 inclusion of exon 14b such as the availability of the cryptic acceptor site of exon 497 14b and the comparative weakness of the exon 15 acceptor site. Such complex 498 dependencies are a prime example as to why sequence based predictions of 499 splicing patterns are hard to compute. Still, several splicing predictors in the 500 Alamut Visual software were able to detect the increase in the splicing probability 501 of the cryptic donor site as a result of variant chr8:g.87618576G>A. This 502 prompted us to test whether such splicing predictors can be used as preliminary identify candidate pathogenic variants for \"gene by gene\" validation 504 methods, circumventing the need for RNA-seq analysis of ROs. We found that 505 the more established approach represented by the Alamut Batch method of 506 combining the calculations of several splicing predictors that are designed to 507 identify known splicing motifs yielded too many candidates for gene by gene 508 validation. In contrast, the more recent approach of deep neuronal networks 509 algorithms, represented by SpliceAI, failed to assign high probability to the true 510 positive variant chr8:g.87618576G>A. Still, in cases where some prior knowledge 511 can help prioritize variants or highlight ones with lower than expected scores 512 these methods may yet be helpful. In cases where no prior knowledge can help 513 prioritize candidate variants, such as in patients where both pathogenic alleles 514 are non-coding, and especially in cases where a cell type relevant for functional 515 validation is not available, the approach established here is preferable.",

We show that the RO transcriptome is much closer to the transcriptome of normal human retina than other more readily available diagnostic tissues. More importantly, we show for107    the first time that analysis of a patient-derived RO transcriptome can successfully detect pathogenic deep intronic variants that activate cryptic splice sites, leading to a new genetic diagnosis. Our approach can lead to a larger number of patients 110 to be eligible for genetic therapies.The study was approved by the institutional review board at the Massachusetts Eye and Ear (Human Studies Committee MEE in USA) and adhered to the Declaration of Helsinki. Informed consent was obtained from all individuals on whom genetic testing and further molecular evaluations were performed. Pluripotent Stem Cell Induction Tissue samples were obtained with written informed consent in adherence with 119 the Declaration of Helsinki and with approval from institutional review boards at 120 the University of Wisconsin-Madison and Massachusetts Eye and Ear Infirmary. Blood samples from 4 individuals from family OGI-081 (197, 198, 200 and 340) were collected and reprogrammed by Cellular Dynamics, Inc (now FUJIFILM Cellular Dynamics, Inc) as custom MyCell products. Three independent clones 124 from each individual were karyotypically normal, expressed pluripotency markers 125 and successfully differentiated to retinal organoids ( 41 : lines 1579, 1580, 1581 and 1582). Stem cells were maintained on Matrigel (ThermoFisher) in either mTeSR1 (WiCell) or Stemflex (ThermoFisher) and passaged with either Versene or ReLeSR (STEMCELL Technologies). Retinal Organoid (RO) Differentiation Differentiation of iPSCs was performed as previously described 41 . Briefly, embryoid bodies (EB) were lifted with either 2 mg/ml dispase or ReLeSR and 132 weaned into Neural Induction Media (NIM: DMEM:F12 1:1, 1% N2 supplement, 1x MEM nonessential amino acids (MEM NEAA), 1x GlutaMAX and 2 mg/ml 134 heparin (Sigma)) over the course of 4 days. On day 6, 1.5 nM BMP4 (R&D Systems) was added to fresh NIM and on day 7, EBs were plated on Matrigel at 136 a density of 200 EBs per well of a 6-well plate. Half the media was replaced with 137 fresh NIM on days 9, 12 and 15 to gradually dilute the BMP4 and on day16, the 138 media was changed to Retinal Differentiation Media (RDM: DMEM:F12 3:1, 2% B27 supplement, MEM NEAA, 1X antibiotic, anti-mycotic and 1x GlutaMAX). On 140 days 25-30, optic vesicle-like structures were manually dissected and maintained 141 as free floating organoids in poly HEMA (Sigma)-coated flasks with twice weekly 142 feeding of 3D-RDM (RDM + 5% FBS (WiCell), 100 \uf06dM taurine (Sigma) and 143 1:1000 chemically defined lipid supplement) to which 1 \uf06dM all-trans retinoic acid 144 (Sigma) was added until d100. Live cultures were imaged on a Nikon Ts2-FL equipped with a DS-fi3 camera.Immunocytochemistry and MicroscopyOrganoids were fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde at room temperature for 40 min, cryopreserved in 15% sucrose followed by equilibration in 30% sucrose, and sectioned on a cryostat. Sections were blocked for 1 hr at room temperature (RT) in 10% normal donkey serum, 5% BSA, 1% fish gelatin and 0.5% Triton then 151 incubated overnight at 4 o C with primary antibodies diluted in block.Table S1lists 152 primary antibodies, dilutions and sources. Slides were incubated with speciesspecific fluorophore-conjugated secondary antibodies diluted 1:500 in block, for 30 minutes in the dark at RT (Alexa Fluor 488, AF546 and AF647). Sections were imaged on a Nikon A1R-HD laser scanning confocal microscope (Nikon Corporation, Tokyo, Japan). DNA was extracted from venous blood using the DNeasy Blood and Tissue Kit 159 (Qiagen, Hilden, Germany). OGI-081-197 underwent GEDi sequencing as 160 described previously 42 . All five family members underwent whole exome and PCR-free whole genome sequencing. Sequencing was done at the Genomics Core at Massachussets Eye and Ear as described previously 43 . RNA Sequencing For transcriptome analysis, ROs from at least 2 different clones per individual 165 were harvested at approximately day160 (early stage 3), lysed in 350 \u00b5l buffer RLT+ME from the RNeasy mini kit (Qiagen), snap frozen on dry ice and stored at 167 -80C. At a later time samples were defrosted on ice and passed through QIAshredder columns (Qiagen). Subsequently, Total RNA was extracted per the 169 manufacturer's instructions. RNA quality and quantity was assessed on an Agilent 2100 Bioanalyzer, RIN number ranged between 9.6-9.9. For each sample 171 1\uf06dg of total RNA spiked with 1.2ng Sequins (v2) controls 44 was used to generate RNA-seq paired-end libraries with the Illumina TruSeq Stranded Total RNA kit.
