Treatment of mouse L-2 fibroblasts with ammonium chloride, chloroquine, or dansylcadaverine inhibited infection of MHV to a much lesser degree than that of VSV, suggesting a relatively minor role for the endocytic pathway and functional endosomes in MHV infection. Endocytosis of MHV and VSV into L-2 cells was assayed by the recovery of infectious (i.e., not uncoated) viruses from homogenates of cells harvested within the first few minutes of infection (and treated with protease to remove surface-bound virus). The results thus suggest that while a small proportion of the MHV inoculum is internalized by endocytosis, productive infection does not depend on functional endocytosis as utilized by VSV. Studies on direct virion-mediated cell fusion showed that MHV can induce fusion at pH 7.4, whereas VSV causes fusion at pH 5.0. Taken together, the above results suggest that MHV enters L-2 cells predominantly by membrane fusion with a non-acidified compartment such as the plasma membrane, endocytic vesicles, or endosomes (prior to their acidification).",

Ceils which are normally nonpermissive to MHV, could be rendered MHVsusceptible by PEG-induced fusion of cell surface-bound virus. Such PEG-mediated susceptibility to MHV infection was insensitive to inhibition by ammonium chloride, supporting the idea that host cell restriction of MHV infection in C-6 and Vero cells may be due to a block in nonendosomal membrane fusion. Thus endocytic internalization of MHV, which clearly occurs in a variety of cells, does not guarantee productive infection. o 1991 Academic PWSS. IW.",

Also, there has as yet been no demonstrated low pH-dependent fusion activity associated with MHV or the MHV S protein, as has been the case with other viral proteins which are known to facilitate the process of fusion between virion envelope and the endosomal membrane.

The results point to important differences in the uptake mechanisms between the two viruses, in particular, that low pH fusion is not a requirement for MHV infec-tion.

We thus compared the effect of ammonium chloride on the replication of MHV versus VSV, a virus that enters cells predominantly by an endocytic mechanism. Virus production was monitored in extracellular media which were replaced at 2-hr intervals. Ammonium chloride (20 mM) delayed the production of progeny MHV virions by approx 4 hr in MHV-inoculated L-2 cells (Fig. 1 a) as has been previously described (Mizzen eta/., 1985) . Furthermore, from the times of initial appearance of progeny virions, the kinetics of replication, either in the presence or in the absence of ammonium chloride, are very similar. In marked contrast, ammonium chloride dramatically suppressed VSV replication in L-2 cells ( Fig. 1 b) with virus production occurring only to a small degree even at 36 hr. Also, the rate of VSV replication in the presence or absence of ammonium chloride differs significantly, confirming the findings of others that VSV enters cells predominantly by endocytosis and ammonium chloride inhibits this pathway. In contrast, MHV may enter cells by an alternate pathway in addition to an ammonium chloride-sensitive endocytic pathway as suggested by a comparatively rapid recovery of MHV replication in the presence of ammonium chloride.",

In order to examine virus uptake from the cell surface, proteinase K was used to strip cell-bound (but not internalized) virions from the cell surface. Cultures of L-2 cells were exposed to MHV or VSV for adsorption (30 min at 4\") warmed to 37\" to allow virion internalization, and then proteinase K treated. Cells were then disrupted by homogenization and aliquots assayed for the presence of infectious virus. Thus, this assay would be expected to reflect the relative numbers of infectious virions which are adsorbed to and/or taken up by the cells in plasma membrane invaginations and subsequently endocytic vesicles. (0) or presence (0) of 20 mM ammonium chloride marker contents does in fact appear to occur readily during cell homogenization (Gruenberg and Howell, 1986) ]. As a control, the proteinase K step was omitted from one replicate series in order to differentiate surface-bound from internalized virions. In the case of both MHV and VSV, proteinase K was effective in removing surface-bound virus, as shown by the time zero samples in Fig. 3 . From these data, we estimate that proteinase K removed approx 90 and 99% of sut-facebound VSV and MHV, respectively.",

Since ammonium chloride raises the pH of both lysosomes and endosomes, it is likely that the decline in infectivity normally observed in MHV and VSV infection represents acid-pH-dependent processing events.

We have previously noted that MHV-infected cells containing a high membrane cholesterol content showed increased cell fusion from within . We have After treatment with proteinase K to remove external virus, cells were lysed and assayed for internalized virus by plaque assay. since observed that not only \"fusion from within\" but also \"fusion from without\" is enhanced by increased cholesterol content in the target membrane and have exploited this observation in the following study of virion-mediated cell fusion. Cultures of L-2 and Vero cells were supplemented with cholesterol, using our previous procedure thereby raising the membrane cholesterol/fatty acid ratios from 0.18 to 0.45 (L-2 cells) and from 0.19 to 0.35 (Vero cells). Little or no fusion was observed in unsupplemented cells (Fig. 7) confirming the amplifying effect of membrane cholesterol on fusion. Cholesterol-supplemented L-2 cells showed rapid cell fusion within 1 hr following exposure to MHV (Fig. 7) . Such fusion occurred when cell-bound MHV was briefly incubated (1 min) at both pH 7.4 and 5.0, and then incubated at pH 7.4 for 1 hr. The results clearly show not only that MHV is able to cause fusion from without at physiological pH, but also that brief pH 5.0 treatment does not irreversibly destroy the virion's fusogenicity. VSV was also able to induce early fusion, which was cholesterol-enhanced, but which occurred only at pH 5.0 and not at pH 7.4, in agreement with other studies (White et a/., 1981) , confirming the low pH-dependent fusion activity of the VSV G protein. By contrast, MHV appears to mediate fusion at neutral pH, which may allow MHV to CHOL.",

Note that, since Vero cells are not infectable by MHV (cf. Fig. 8) , the infectious centers recorded in Fig. 10a are derived from the cocultured L-2 cells to which virus has been transferred by cell-cell contact. The maximum at 20 min suggests that MHV virions are being internalized by Vero cells and/or are not being completely removed by the protease treatment. However, internalization by Vero cells does not ultimately result in a productive infection (Fig.  8) as indicated by the subsequent decline in infectious centers (Fig. 1 Oa; 20-l 20 min). A likely explanation of the maximum at 20 min p.i. is that these infectious centers represent virus being partially internalized such that part of the virus including envelope spike (S) glycoproteins are exposed to the cell surface (Fig. 1 Ob; t = 20 min). [The S glycoprotein is the one responsible for cell binding and fusion (Collins eta/., 1982) ]. Virus is thus protected from proteinase K treatment but can still initiate infection when placed in contact with a permissive L-2 cell. This assay demonstrates the ability of Vero cell-bound virus to initiate infection on an \"indicator\" L-2 cell with which it is placed in contact. The results thus demonstrate a progressive protection of Vero cell-bound MHV against external protease while preserving the virus in a surface-exposed state consistent with its ability to infect neighboring L-2 cells. We can only explain these results by a process of virusmediated invagination of the Vero cell membrane which protects against protease but permits the subsequent interdigitation of L-2 cell membrane processes (thereby facilitating infection of the latter). However, at increasing times of infection ( Fig. lob; >40 min), the virus is internalized further (by the Vero cell) such that it is no longer exposed at the cell surface. Even though virus is fully internalized by 120 min (cf. Fig. 9 ), an infectious center is not formed, indicating either that there is a postinternalization block to MHV infection in Vero cells or that MHV must enter Vero cells by an alternate pathway in order to be infectious.",

Cultures of C-6 and Vero cells were treated in medium containing 0 or 20 mM ammonium chloride for 60 min at 4\", MHV at an m.o.i. of 5 was adsorbed during this time for 30 min. Cultures were washed and treated with PEG as described and the cultures were incubated at 37\" in the absence or presence of 20 mM NH,CI. MHV which does not normally replicate in Vero and C-6 cells (Figs. 1 1A and 1 1 B) does undergo replication when fused with such cells in the presence of PEG (Figs. 1 1 C and 1 1 D). This is consistent with the findings of Van Dinter and Flintoff (1987) , who demonstrated PEG-mediated MHV infection of C-6 cells and concluded that MHV replication in C-6 cells was blocked at the internalization step. From this and our present results which demonstrate endocytic internalization of MHV into C-6 and Vero cells, we conclude that PEG-mediated fusion may overcome the block in replication by allowing MHV virions to enter the C-6 and Vero cells by an alternate (nonendocytic) pathway. Such a pathway would be expected to be resistant to the effects of ammonium chloride, which was in fact found to be the case (Figs. 11 C and 11 D) . These results suggest that PEG mediates direct virion envelope fusion with the cell plasma membrane, thereby overcoming the normal host-imposed restriction present in Vero and C-6 cells.",

Dansylcadaverine has been used to inhibit receptor-mediated endocytosis of VSV (Schlegel et al., 1982) adenovirus (Svensson, 1985) , and a variety of ligands (Cheng et al., 1980; Haigler et a/., 1980; Maxfield et a/., 1979) . Electron microscopy of dansylcadaverine-treated cells showed that +-macroglobulin, Pseudomonas toxin, and LDL remained diffusely bound to the cell membrane and did not form clusters in coated pits. Thus the decreased rate of internalization may be due to this inhibition of clustering (Fitzgerald et al., 1980; Pastan and Willingham, 1981 a, b) . Our own findings presented in this report suggested that dansylcadaverine has inhibitory effects both on endocytic internalization of MHV and on subsequent processing events which are also blocked by the lysosomotropic agent, ammonium chloride. Despite these inhibitory actions, the effect of dansylcadaverine treatment on MHV replication is minimal compared to its effect on the replication of VSV. The need for an intact, functioning endocytic pathway would therefore seem to be much greater for VSV than for MHV.",

A distinctive characteristic of most enveloped viruses is their ability to induce cell to cell fusion when they are added to cells at a high m.o.i. However, to observe this fusion from without the medium pH should correspond to the pH at which the virus displays optimal fusion activity. Sendai virus, which enters cells by direct plasma membrane fusion, demonstrates optimal fusion activity at pH 7.5 (Hsu et al,, 1982; Hoekstra et a/., 1985) . At mildly acidic pH, fusion is reduced, suggesting that Sendai virus enters cells predominantly if not completely by direct plasma membrane fusion. The finding that VSV is fusogenie only at pH 5.0 is consistent with the notion that VSV enters cells by endocytosis and fuses with endosomal membranes following acidification (White et al., 1981) . In contrast, the ability of MHV to induce fusion from without at pH 7.4 suggests that MHV is able to 11 . Effect of ammonium chloride on PEG-mediated MHV infection of C-6 and Vero cells.

The idea that MHV may enter cells by membrane fusion at neutral pH is also supported by studies of Sawicki and Sawicki (1986) , who noted that in 17Cll cells MHV-induced fusion from within occurred more efficiently at pH 7.2 than at 6.8.",

            "text": "Fourth, the normally abortive MHV infection of Vero and C-6 cells can be rescued, in an ammonium chloride-insensitive fashion, with the known fusogen, PEG, suggesting that MHV infection can be initiated by a cell surface fusion event. In the absence of such fusion-inducing agents, MHV is apparently taken up by an endocytic pathway which does not lead to productive infection. Such endocytosis may be a relatively nonspecific event since cells are known to internalize the equivalent of theirtotal plasma membrane surface area within time intervals of 30 min to several hours (Steinman et a/., 1976) . Cell surface-bound ligands and even adventitiously bound structures, such as latex beads (Roberts and Quastel, 1963) can also be included in this overall process of membrane turnover. Our results indicate quantitatively different efficiencies of internalization of two viruses, namely MHV and VSV, into L-2 cells. Despite the quantiative differences, it is clearthat some MHV is internalized by an apparently endocytic process in L-2 cells (as well as the nonproductively infected Vero and C-6 cells; Fig. 8 ). The results of the present work may also explain previous electron microscopic studies, demonstrating the presence of endocytically enclosed virions (David-Ferreira and Manaker, 1965; Arnheiter et al., 1982) which have been inter-preted as supporting a role for endocytosis in MHV infection. Such observations may at least in part represent a mechanism of virus internalization which is nonproductive, in a manner similar to that found in the present study in cells such as Vero and C-6.",
