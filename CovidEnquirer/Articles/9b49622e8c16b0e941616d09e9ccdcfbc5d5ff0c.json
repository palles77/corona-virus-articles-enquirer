In a phase II clinical trial, 21 patients with pretreated metastatic NPC underwent NST with sibling PBSC allografts, using CY conditioning, thymic irradiation and in vivo T-cell depletion with thymoglobulin. Stable lymphohematopoietic chimerism was achieved in most patients and prophylactic CYA was tapered at a median of day \u00fe 30. Seven patients (33%) showed partial response and three (14%) achieved stable disease. Four patients were alive at 2 years and three showed prolonged disease control of 344, 525 and 550 days. With a median follow-up of 209 (4-1147) days, the median PFS was 100 days (95% confidence interval (CI), 66-128 days), and median OS was 209 days (95% CI, 128-236 days). Patients with chronic GVHD had better survival-median OS 426 days (95% CI, 194-NE days) vs 143 days (95% CI, 114-226 days) (P \u00bc 0.010). Thus, NST may induce meaningful clinical responses in patients with advanced NPC.",

Patients with chronic GVHD also had much better survival-median OS was 426 days (95% CI, 194-NE days) vs 143 days (95%CI, 114-226 days) in patients without chronic GVHD (P \u00bc 0.010, Figure 2c ). Patients who responded to treatment (PR or stable disease) also had a trend toward better survival than nonresponders; median survival time of 326 (95% CI, 136-782) days against 195 (95% CI, 100-235) days, respectively (univariate P \u00bc 0.055). Responders and nonresponders were similar in age, number of disease sites and previous chemotherapy, although pre-NST performance status was poorer in responders.",

Our results show that NST is feasible, and may induce durable responses in subsets of patients, even in the presence of extensive, bulky disease. In our study, we achieved a response rate of 33% and a clinical benefit of 47%, which compares well with the response rates achieved in second-and third-line chemotherapy against NPC (approximately 11-23%). [1] [2] [3] Our NST regimen was overall well tolerated. The integration of thymoglobulin into the same ATG schedule as the Spitzer regimen 18 (regimen 1) resulted in a high incidence of secondary engraftment loss in 4 out of 10 patients. After we revised to incorporate thymoglobulin earlier into the conditioning timeline (regimen 2), which may have worked better to deplete host than donor T lymphocytes, all 10 evaluable patients achieved stable and full donor lymphohematopoietic chimerism. In our study, engraftment syndrome occurred only in 15% of patients and was mild, requiring no treatment, as compared to 67% in the Boston study 18 in which some patients required high-dose steroids for control of this syndrome.",

Patients may experience late responses, which occur only after an initial disease progression-however, because only the first event (progressive disease) is used to construct the Kaplan-Meier graph, it would give the false impression of a lack of benefit. Late responses have been described in earlier NST studies and occur typically 3-6 months post transplant, 23, 24 after conversion to a full donor chimerism, although it may be influenced by factors such as the early withdrawal of immunosuppressants or the use of DLIs. 12 Second, patients on NST may experience more than one response. For example, patient 7 had 2 periods of responses-whereas her first PFS was 127 days, the second PFS was significantly longer at 550 days. Finally, NST through reconstituting the immune system may change the biological and growth characteristics of the disease, and thus OS (which is not reliant on any single time point cutoff) may be a more accurate measure of true benefit.",

This raises questions regarding the role of mHA in mediating the GVT effect, which could be exploited further as an antitumor strategy. 14, 25, 26 Despite early prophylactic CYA taper, GVHD incidence in our study was acceptable, largely due to the high percentage of patients who achieved mixed chimerism by day \u00fe 100. Still, infections were more commonly observed in our study as compared with other NST studies. [11] [12] [13] This may be related to xerostomia, poor dentition, chronic sinusitis and altered mucosal barriers in our NPC patients, most of whom had previous radiotherapy for primary disease. Future NST studies should consider such local immunosuppressive features when selecting patients for NST.",
