These proteins are dispensable for viral replication in vitro but are supposed to play a role in virulence. In the current study, we produced and characterized 7b-specific monoclonal antibodies (mAbs). A recombinant form of the 7b protein was expressed as a fusion protein in Escherichia coli, purified by immobilized metal affinity chromatography and used as immunogen. Two hybridoma lines, 5B6 and 14D8, were isolated that expressed mAbs that recognized 7b proteins of both FCoV serotypes. Using an extensive set of N-and C-terminally truncated 7b proteins expressed in E. coli and a synthetic peptide, the binding sites of mAbs 5B6 and 14D8 were mapped to an 18-residue region that comprises the only potential N-glycosylation site of the FCoV 7b protein. The two mAbs were suitable to detect a 24-kDa protein, which represents the nonglycosylated form of 7b in FCoV-infected cells. We speculate that glycosylation of 7b is part of the viral evasion strategy to prevent an immune response against this antigenic site.",

They belong to the family Coronaviridae within the order Nidovirales (de Groot et al., 2012) . Based on phylogenetic analyses, coronaviruses are divided into four genera termed Alpha-,Beta-, Gamma-and Deltacoronavirus. Feline coronaviruses together with the closely related canine coronavirus (CCoV) and porcine transmissible gastroenteritis virus (TGEV) have been classified to the species Alphacoronavirus 1 in the genus Alphacoronavirus. The latter contains a large number of more distantly related alphacoronaviruses, including a number of important medical and veterinary pathogens, such as porcine epidemic diarrhea virus (PEDV), human coronavirus 229E (HCoV-229E), and human coronavirus NL63 (HCoV-NL63) (de Groot et al., 2012) . The 5 0proximal two-thirds of the coronavirus genome comprise ORF 1a and ORF 1b that together encode up to 16 nonstructural proteins (nsps) that form the viral replication/transcription complex but may also be involved in interactions with host cell factors and functions. The remaining part of the genome codes for the structural proteins S (spike), E (envelope), M (membrane) and N (nucleocapsid) (Masters, 2006) and a varying number of so-called accessory proteins with poorly characterized functions.",

With only very few exceptions, homologs of specific accessory genes are only conserved in very closely related viruses (of the same species or sublineage) but not in the more distantly viruses (Lai and Cavanagh, 1997) . There is increasing evidence that accessory gene products are important for virulence in the natural host but the precise functions of the vast majority of accessory proteins remain to be investigated. Alphacoronaviruses harbor accessory genes at two different positions in their genomes. Between the S and E genes, FCoVs and the very closely related CCoVs possess three ORFs (3a-3c), while TGEV contains only two ORFs (3a and 3b) in this genome region. Recently, an additional ORF, named ORF3, was found between the S and E genes in CCoV serotype I (Lorusso et al., 2008) . Other alphacoronaviruses, such as PEDV, HCoV-229E and HCoV-NL63, have only one ORF 3. Sequence analyses suggest that FCoV ORF 3a is homologous to CCoV ORF 3a and TGEV ORF 3a while the FCoV ORF 3 c is a homolog of CCoV ORF 3c, TGEV ORF 3b and ORF 3 of all other alphacoronaviruses. Downstream of the N gene, all members of the species Alphacoronavirus 1 contain a different number of additional accessory genes. Thus, TGEV contains only one ORF (called ORF 7), which is homologous to ORF 7a of FCoVs and CCoVs, while the latter two coronaviruses contain yet another ORF called 7b in the 3 0 -terminal genome region.",

Using a reverse genetics approach, Haijema et al. (2004) showed that the accessory genes of the FIPV strain 79-1146 are dispensable for viral growth in vitro and recombinant viruses that lack ORFs 3a-3c or 7a and 7b were unable to induce FIP in vivo (2004) . So far, there is no evidence that 3a-3c accessory proteins are produced in infected cells. Nevertheless, it has been proposed that 3c is essential for viral replication in the gut (as is the case for FECV) but dispensable for systemic infections (Chang et al., 2010) . The functions of the FCoV-accessory proteins 3a-3c remain to be determined. Recently, it was suggested that the accessory protein 7a represents an interferon antagonist (Dedeurwaerder et al., 2014) , although its expression in infected cells has not been confirmed. Among the FCoV-accessory proteins, the 7b protein has been studied most extensively. The 7b protein has a molecular mass of $26 kDa, it is secreted from the cell and contains (i) a Cterminal KDEL-like endoplasmic reticulum (ER) retention signal, (ii) an N-terminal signal sequence of 17 amino acids and (iii) a potential N-glycosylation site at aa position 68 (Vennema et al., 1992a) . The presence of 7b-specific antibodies in both FECV-and FIPV-infected cats indicates that this protein is produced during natural infections (Vennema et al., 1992a,b; Herrewegh et al., 1995; Kennedy et al., 2008) . It was also reported that cell culture adaptation often leads to mutations in the 7b gene and loss of expression of this protein (Herrewegh et al., 1995) . Taken together, there is growing evidence that the accessory genes and their products are involved in FCoV persistence and virulence but, up to now, their function is not known. One reason for our limited knowledge on FCoV-accessory proteins is the lack of appropriate tools to study these proteins.

            "text": "The full-length 7b protein of FCoV 79-1146 of 206 amino acid (aa) residues was expressed in E. coli with a C-terminal His-tag (7b-His). Induction of expression of 7b-His resulted in insoluble protein aggregates that could be solubilized using 6 M GuHCl-containing buffer and purified by ion metal affinity chromatography (IMAC). The identity of the purified protein was confirmed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using anti-His mAb. The protein had an apparent molecular mass of 24 kDa as judged by SDS-PAGE analysis, which is predicted for this protein, and was recognized by the His-tag-specific antibody (Fig. 1a) . Western blot analysis further revealed a protein of approximately 48 kDa, suggesting dimerization of the full-length protein. The overall yield for this protein was low. We therefore decided to express 7b as part of a GST fusion protein. To do this, the 5 0 region encoding a putative Nterminal signal sequence (SS, residues 1 to 17) was removed from the 7b coding sequence and replaced by the GST coding sequence. The resulting construct was termed GST-7bDSS-His. Expression of GST-7bDSS-His in E. coli resulted again in insoluble protein aggregates. The protein was purified under denaturing conditions using 8 M urea-containing buffer and analyzed by SDS-PAGE and Western blotting using an anti-His mAb. Consistent with its calculated molecular mass, the major fraction of the purified protein migrated as a 51-kDa protein in SDS polyacrylamide gels. Two additional minor bands in the SDS-PAGE were specifically recognized by Western blotting using the His-tag-specific mAb. These bands are consistent with a dimer and a 37-kDa degradation product, respectively, of the GST-7bDSS-His protein (Fig. 1b) . The total yield of GST-7bDSS-His was estimated to be 25 times higher compared to 7b-His. The elution fractions of 7b-His and GST-7bDSS-His were pooled, concentrated, desalted and used for immunization ( Fig. 1c and d, respectively) .",

The mouse with the best immune response received an additional boost with 7b-His. Splenocytes isolated from immunized mice were fused with myeloma cells and cell culture supernatants were screened by ELISA using the GST-7bDSS-His as capture antigen. GST-YFP-His was used as a control antigen to identify and exclude clones producing antibodies specific for one of the tags. Two supernatants were confirmed to contain antibodies that bind to GST-7bDSS-His but not the GST-YFP-His control protein. The respective hybridoma cells were subcloned twice and continued to produce 7b-specific antibodies as determined by ELISA. Antibodies produced by the two stable hybridoma cell lines (5B6 [IgG2a], 14D8 [IgG1]) were subsequently tested by Western blotting. Both mAbs recognized the recombinant proteins 7b-His (Fig. 2a) and GST-7bDSS-His (data not shown).

The 7b proteins of strains Black and 79-1146 share 90% amino acid sequence identity. However, strain Black contains an internal translation stop codon in ORF 7b, resulting in a C-terminally truncated 7b protein. We therefore restored the ORF 7b of FCoV strain Black and expressed the strain Black 7b peptide sequence as part of a recombinant fusion protein (GST-7bDStop-His) in E. coli.

First, we produced a set of bacterially expressed segments of 7b. Appropriate coding sequences were cloned into the pC23.6 plasmid and expressed with N-terminal GST and C-terminal histidine tags. mAb reactivities against these proteins were tested by Western blotting (Fig. 3) . All proteins containing aa residues 58-111 of 7b (pC72.1, pC88.1, pC89.2, pC90.1, pC91.5, pC92.9) were detected by the mAbs.

            "text": "We are interested in accessory proteins encoded by FCoV in particular with respect to potential roles in (i) establishing persistent infections by enteric feline coronavirus in the gut and (ii) the pathogenesis of feline infectious peritonitis (Pedersen, 2009) . Since there was already some information on FCoV 7b, we first concentrated on this protein. For further characterization including its unambiguous identification in FCoV-infected cells monoclonal antibodies against 7b protein were generated. Using Nand C-terminally truncated parts of the 7b protein expressed by bacteria as well as a synthetic peptide conjugated to BSA, the binding sites of two mAbs were determined. According to this analysis, the mAbs recognize a stretch of 18 amino acids (aa) between aa position 58 and 75. Interestingly, the only putative Nlinked glycosylation site as well as two of the seven cysteines of the FCoV 7b protein are contained within this sequence. This finding led to the question whether the mAbs recognize only the nonglycosylated form of 7b. In fact, both mAbs detected in FCoV-infected cells only recognized a protein with an apparent molecular weight of 24 kDa and not the previously described glycosylated form of 26 kDa (Vennema et al., 1992a) . The exclusive recognition of the nonglycosylated form was supported by results obtained after tunicamycin treatment of FCoV-infected cells. Notably, immunofluorescence studies using the mAbs led to negative results unless the FCoV-infected cells were treated with tunicamycin. The difference to Western blot experiments where the nonglycosylated form could be readily shown without inhibition of glycosylation most likely results from different sensitivities of the two methods. Masking of epitopes by glycosylation has been shown for many other viral proteins including the hemagglutinin of influenza virus (Skehel et al., 1984) . The authors also used tunicamycin to demonstrate recognition by mAbs in the absence of N-linked glycosylation. Accordingly, the antigenicity of influenza virus hemagglutinin and of other proteins can be modified by addition of carbohydrate chains. Furthermore, since both mAbs recognize the same or a nearby epitope in 7b, it can be assumed that the identified 18 aa stretch represents a highly antigenic site. Masking of this region through glycosylation of asparagine 68 may prevent an immune response and could be relevant for establishment of persistent infection by FCoV. This could be directly tested by the use of recombinant FCoVs, where the N-linked glycosylation site of 7b is missing. It remains to be seen whether this finding has implications for vaccine development against FCoV-induced diseases.",

            "text": "Another interesting aspect of our studies with FCoV 7b concerns putative intra-and intermolecular disulfide bonds. In this context, it is noteworthy that expression of 7b in bacteria allowed the detection of disulfide linked dimers, which disappeared after treatment of extracts with a reducing agent. Such dimeric forms were also detected in FCoV-infected cells, but apparently only after treatment with tunicamycin. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that intermolecular disulfide bridges represent an artifact only observed in the absence of glycosylation at asparagine 68 of FCoV 7b. It will be interesting to determine whether one or both cysteines present in our synthetic peptide is/ are involved in intramolecular disulfide bonds. Recognition of 7b by our mAbs in the absence and presence of reducing agent may give some indirect evidence in this regard. Pilot experiments actually indicate that our mAbs recognize the nonreduced form of 7b from FCoV-infected cells better than the reduced one; this result suggests that the native protein contains one or more intramolecular disulfide bridges, which are important for the antigenicity of 7b. Another way to study the relevance of disulfide bonds for the structure of 7b is the exchange of cysteine codons in different expression systems together with Western blots under nonreducing and reducing conditions. However, final proof for the presence of intramolecular disulfide bridges within FCoV 7b will require the determination of its three-dimensional crystal structure.",
