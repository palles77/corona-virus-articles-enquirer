            "text": "To look for evidence of intrafamilial infection, we isolated 107 Helicobacter pylori clones from biopsied specimens taken from both parents and four children. We compared the sequences of two housekeeping genes (hspA and glmM) from these clones with those of 131 unrelated strains from patients living in different geographic regions. Strain relationships within the family were determined by analyzing allelic variation at both loci and building phylogenetic trees and by using multilocus sequence typing. Both hspA-and glmM-based phylogenetic trees showed East Asian and African branches. All samples from family members showed natural mixed infection. Identical alleles found in some strains isolated from the children and parents, but not in the strains isolated from unrelated patients, demonstrated that strains have circulated within the family. Several mechanisms, such as point mutations, intragenic recombination, and introduction of foreign (African) alleles, were shown to enhance strain diversity within the family. Increasing reports of the appearance of novel nonmultiresistant methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus MRSA (MRSA) strains in the community and of the spread of hospital MRSA strains into the community are cause for public health concern. We conducted two national surveys of unique isolates of S. aureus from clinical specimens collected from nonhospitalized patients commencing in 2000 and 2002, respectively. A total of 11.7% of 2,498 isolates from 2000 and 15.4% of 2,486 isolates from 2002 were MRSA. Approximately 54% of the MRSA isolates were nonmultiresistant (resistant to less than three of nine antibiotics) in both surveys. The majority of multiresistant MRSA isolates in both surveys belonged to two strains (strains AUS-2 and AUS-3), as determined by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) and resistogram typing. The 3 AUS-2 isolates and 10 of the 11 AUS-3 isolates selected for multilocus sequence typing (MLST) and staphylococcal chromosomal cassette mec (SCCmec) analysis were ST239-MRSA-III (where ST is the sequence type) and thus belonged to the same clone as the eastern Australian MRSA strain of the 1980s, which spread internationally. Four predominant clones of novel nonmultiresistant MRSA were identified by PFGE, MLST, and SCCmec analysis: ST22-MRSA-IV (strain EMRSA-15), ST1-MRSA-IV (strain WA-1), ST30-MRSA-IV (strain SWP), and ST93-MRSA-IV (strain Queensland). The last three clones are associated with community acquisition. A total of 14 STs were identified in the surveys, including six unique clones of novel nonmultiresistant MRSA, namely, STs 73, 93, 129, 75, and 80slv and a new ST. SCCmec types IV and V were present in diverse genetic backgrounds. These findings provide support for the acquisition of SCCmec by multiple lineages of S. aureus. They also confirm that both hospital and community strains of MRSA are now common in nonhospitalized patients throughout Australia. Use of multiple nucleic acid amplification tests to define the infected-patient 'gold standard' in clinical trials of new diagnostic tests for Chlamydia trachomatis infections Martin DH, Nsuami M, Schachter J, Hook EW 3rd, Ferrero D, Quinn TC, Gaydos C Nucleic acid amplification tests (NAATs) can be used to define the infected-patient 'gold standard' for the purpose of designing studies of the performance of Chlamydia trachomatis diagnostic tests. It is unclear how many test results run by different NAATs and what combinations of specimens comprise the best infected-patient gold standard. We approached this question with data from a large study of the performance of a new NAAT. Data were available from three endocervical swabs and a urine specimen collected from each of 1,412 women and tested by three different NAATs. Results from all three assays were used equally in a rotating fashion to define the infected-patient gold standard. Multiple different infectedpatient gold standards for estimating swab and urine specimen sensitivity and specificity for one NAAT method were created by varying the number and combinations of swab and urine comparator results with two different NAATs, The effect of changing the infected-patient gold standard definition was determined by constructing receiver-operator-like curves with calculated sensitivities and specificities for each test. The one-positive-of-two-results or two-positive-oftwo-results (same or two different assays) infected-patient gold standard definitions produced low sensitivity and low specificity estimates, respectively. If four comparator NAAT results were used, the any-three-positive-offour-results definition or the at-least-one-specimen-positive-by-each-of-two-comparator-assays definition appeared to provide better combinations of sensitivity and specificity estimates. The any-two-positive-out-of-three-results definition resulted in estimates that were as good as produced with the former two definitions. This analytic approach provides a means of clearly visualizing the effects of changing NAAT-based infected-patient gold standards and should be helpful in designing future studies of new C. trachomatis diagnostic tests. Prospective study of human metapneumovirus infection in children less than 3 years of age Konig B, Konig W, Arnold R, Werchau H, Ihorst G, Forster J Most lower respiratory tract infections (LRTIs) in children under the age of 3 years are due to respiratory syncytial virus (RSV). Epidemiological, host, and viral factors eventually account for the severity of LRTIs, but they do not completely explain it. Human metapneumovirus (hMPV) was recently identified in children with LRTIs. In a population-based prospective multicenter study (the PRI.DE study, conducted in Germany over 2 years), we tested 3,369 nasopharyngeal secretions from children younger than 3 years of age with LRTIs for RSV A and B, influenza viruses (IVs) A and B, and parainfluenza viruses (PIVs) 1 to 3. Of the children requiring intensive care (nZ85), 18% had hMPV infections, and 60% of these children were infected with hMPV in combination with RSV. We did not detect hMPV in a randomly selected subset of RSV-positive nasopharyngeal secretions (nZ120) from children not requiring intensive care support. hMPV was detected in !1% of virus-negative samples from patients without intensive care support (nZ620). Our data support the hypothesis that coinfections with RSV and hMPV are more severe than infections with either RSV or hMPV alone, at least in children younger than 3 years of age. Candida parapsilosis is an important cause of bloodstream infections in the health care setting. We investigated a large C. parapsilosis outbreak occurring in a community hospital and conducted a case-control study to determine the risk factors for infection. We identified 22 cases of bloodstream infection with C. parapsilosis: 15 confirmed and 7 possible. The factors associated with an increased risk of infection included hospitalization in the intensive care unit (adjusted odds ratio, 16.4; 95% confidence interval, 1.8 to 148.1) and receipt of total parenteral nutrition (adjusted odds ratio, 9.2; 95% confidence interval, 0.9 to 98.1). Samples for surveillance cultures were obtained from health care worker hands, central venous catheter insertion sites, and medical devices. Twenty-six percent of the health care workers surveyed demonstrated hand colonization with C. parapsilosis, and one hand isolate was highly related to all case-patient isolates by tests with the DNA probe Cp3-13. Outbreak strain isolates also demonstrated reduced susceptibilities to fluconazole and voriconazole. This largest known reported outbreak of C. parapsilosis bloodstream infections in adults resulted from an interplay of host, environment, and pathogen factors. Recommendations for control measures focused on improving hand hygiene compliance. ",

PMID: 15378437 [PubMed-in process] Role of human neutrophil peptide-1 as a possible adjunct to antituberculosis chemotherapy Kalita A, Verma I, Khuller GK We report the role of human neutrophil peptide (HNP)-1 as an adjunct to antituberculosis (anti-TB) drugs. The combination of HNP-1, isoniazid, and rifampicin was evaluated against Mycobacterium tuberculosis H(37)Rv in vitro, ex vivo, and in vivo, and synergism was observed on the basis of reductions in minimum inhibitory concentrations (MICs) of these agents. In vitro results revealed O1log unit reductions even when HNP-1 and anti-TB drugs were used at 1/16 MICs. This combination was also found to be bactericidal against intracellular mycobacteria even at 1/8 MICs of HNP-1 and drugs. HNP-1 used in conjunction with anti-TB drugs resulted in significant clearance of bacterial load from lungs, liver, and spleen of infected, compared with control animals. The effective therapeutic dosage of drugs could be reduced to half by supplementing HNP-1 in the therapeutic schedule. These results clearly suggest that HNP-1 can be used as adjunct chemotherapy with conventional drugs against TB. In this Phase III trial, Dr. Jo-Anne H. van Burik and the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases Mycoses Study Group studied 882 children and adults undergoing HSCT. About half were randomized to receive micafungin (50 mg; 1 mg/kg for patients !50 kg), whereas the others received fluconazole (400 mg; 8 mg/kg for patients !50 kg).",

For 104 breast procedures with indicators explained in available medical records, SSI were confirmed for 37%, and some infection criteria were present for another 27%.

Claims data may complement other data sources for identification of surgical site infections following breast surgery and cesarean section. Several studies have shown that nasopharyngeal sampling is more sensitive than oropharyngeal sampling for the detection of pneumococcal carriage in children. The data for adults are limited and conflicting. This study was part of a larger study of pneumococcal carriage on the Navajo and White Mountain Apache Reservation following a clinical trial of a seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine. Persons aged 18 years and older living in households with children enrolled in the vaccine trial were eligible. We collected both nasopharyngeal and oropharyngeal specimens by passing a flexible calcium alginate wire swab either nasally to the posterior nasopharynx or orally to the posterior oropharynx. Swabs were placed in skim milktryptone-glucose-glycerin medium and frozen at K708C. Pneumococcal isolation was performed by standard techniques. Analyses were based on specimens collected from 1,994 adults living in 1,054 households. Nasopharyngeal specimens (11.1%; 95% confidence interval [CI], 9.8 and 12.6%) were significantly more likely to grow pneumococci than were oropharyngeal specimens (5.8%; 95% CI, 4.8 to 6.9%) (P!0.0001). Few persons had pneumococcal growth from both specimens (1.7%). Therefore, both tests together were more likely to identify pneumococcal carriage (15.2%; 95% CI, 13.7 to 16.9%) than either test alone. Although we found that nasopharyngeal sampling was more sensitive than oropharyngeal sampling, nasopharyngeal sampling alone would have underestimated the prevalence of pneumococcal carriage in this adult population. Sampling both sites may give more accurate results than sampling either site alone in studies of pneumococcal carriage in adults. Microbiol 2004; 42(11):4974-6. PMID: 15528682 [PubMed-in process] Effects of intrapartum penicillin prophylaxis on intestinal bacterial colonization in infants Jaureguy F, Carton M, Panel P, Foucaud P, Butel MJ, Doucet-Populaire F Early-onset group B streptococcal (GBS) infections remain a leading cause of morbidity and mortality in infants. To prevent the vertical transmission of GBS and neonatal GBS infection, guidelines recommend intrapartum penicillin or amoxicillin prophylaxis. This intrapartum antibiotic prophylaxis (IAP) is suspected to favor colonization by antibiotic-resistant bacteria. However, the effects of this prophylaxis on the patterns of acquisition of gastrointestinal bacterial flora in infants have never been studied. We collected stool samples from 3-day-old infants born to mothers who received intrapartum amoxicillin (antibiotic-exposed group; nZ25) and to untreated mothers (non-antibiotic-exposed group; nZ25). The groups were matched for factors known to affect intestinal microbial colonization: gestational age, type of delivery, and type of feeding. Qualitative and quantitative differential analyses of the bacterial flora in stool samples were performed. Similar numbers of infants in the nonantibiotic-exposed and antibiotic-exposed groups were colonized by aerobic bacteria and amoxicillinresistant enterobacteria (75 and 77%, respectively) (PZ0.79). In contrast, significantly fewer infants in the antibiotic-exposed group than in the nonantibiotic-exposed group were colonized by anaerobic bacteria, especially Clostridium (12 and 40%, respectively) (P!0.05). Regarding intestinal bacterial colonization, the differences between antibiotic-exposed and non-antibiotic-exposed infants were remarkably few. The only statistically significant effect was the reduced initial bacterial colonization by Clostridium in the antibioticexposed group. In our study, the use of IAP did not favor colonization by beta-lactam-resistant bacteria. However, further evaluations are required to highlight the potential risks of the widespread use of antibiotics to prevent early-onset GBS infection. Microbiol 2004; 42(11):5184-8. PMID: 15528713 [PubMed-in process] Usefulness of routine epicardial pacing wire culture for early prediction of poststernotomy mediastinitis Mekontso-Dessap A, Honore S, Kirsch M, Houel R, Loisance D, Brun-Buisson C Poststernotomy mediastinitis (PSM) is one of the most serious complications of cardiac surgery, and its associated morbidity and mortality demand early recognition for emergency therapy. In this study, we investigated the usefulness of epicardial pacing wire (EPW) cultures for the prediction of PSM. Among 2,200 patients who underwent a cardiac surgical procedure at our hospital between 1 January 1999 and 31 December 2001, 82 (3.7%) had PSM; Staphylococcus aureus was the organism (45.1%) most frequently isolated at the time of surgical debridement. EPWs from 1,607 (73.0%) patients, 73 (4.5%) of whom developed PSM, were cultured. EPW cultures from 466 (29.0%) were positive, most often (74.9%) for coagulase-negative Staphylococci. EPW cultures were truly positive in 26 cases, truly negative in 1,106 cases, falsely positive in 428 cases, and falsely negative in 47 cases (with sterile cultures in 35 cases and a culture positive for an organism different from that isolated at the time of debridement in 12 cases). EPW culture had a positive predictive value of only 5.7% and a high negative predictive value (95.9%) for the diagnosis of PSM, with an accuracy of 70.4%. However, the likelihood ratio of positive (1.27) and negative (0.89) tests indicated only small changes in pretest-to-posttest probability. Therefore, a strategy of routine culture of EPWs to predict PSM seems questionable. Dual-probe assay for rapid detection of drug-resistant Mycobacterium tuberculosis by real-time PCR Wada T, Maeda S, Tamaru A, Imai S, Hase A, Kobayashi K Mutations in particular nucleotides of genes coding for drug targets or drug-converting enzymes lead to drug resistance in Mycobacterium tuberculosis. For rapid detection of drug-resistant M. tuberculosis in clinical specimens, a simple and applicable method is needed. Eight TaqMan minor groove binder (MGB) probes, which discriminate one-base mismatches, were designed (dual-probe assay with four reaction tubes). The target of six MGB probes was the rpoB gene, which is involved in rifampin resistance; five probes were designed to detect for mutation sites within an 81-bp hot spot of the rpoB gene, and one probe was designed as a tuberculosis (TB) control outside the rpoB gene hot-spot. We also designed probes to examine codon 315 of katG and codon 306 of embB for mutations associated with resistance to isoniazid and ethambutol, respectively. Our system was M. tuberculosis complex specific, because neither nontuberculous mycobacteria nor bacteria other than mycobacteria reacted with the system. Detection limits in direct and preamplified analyses were 250 and 10 fg of genomic DNA, respectively. The system could detect mutations of the rpoB, katG, and embB genes in DNAs extracted from 45 laboratory strains and from sputum samples of 27 patients with pulmonary TB. This system was much faster (3 h from DNA preparation) than conventional drug susceptibility testing (3 weeks). Results from the dual-MGBprobe assay were consistent with DNA sequencing. Because the dual-probe assay system is simple, rapid, and accurate, it can be applied to detect drugresistant M. tuberculosis in clinical laboratories. To define methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus (MRSA) reservoirs in the community and their population dynamics, we studied the molecular epidemiology of a random sample (nZ490) from a collection of 2154 inpatient and outpatient MRSA isolates during a 7-year period in San Francisco. We noted a progressive replacement of type II staphylococcal chromosomal cassette (SCC)mec-bearing isolates with type IV SCCmec-bearing isolates, which coincided with O4-fold increase in methicillin resistance between 1998 and 2002. Type IV SCCmec-bearing isolates involved in the increase in methicillin resistance belonged to 4 molecular genotypes. These 4 genotypes were associated predominantly with community-onset disease, rather than hospital-or long-term-care facilityonset disease (76.9% vs. 19.4% vs. 3.7%; PZ0.0005), suggesting that they are not feral descendants of hospital isolates. The longitudinal results linked the dramatic increase in MRSA infections to an expanding community reservoir of MRSA genotypes with intrinsic community survival advantage. The outbreak of monkeypox in the midwestern United States during June 2003 marks the first documented human infection in the Western Hemisphere. Consistent with those in outbreaks in Africa, most cases in this outbreak were associated with febrile rash illness. We describe a cluster of monkeypox in a family with a spectrum of clinical illness, including encephalitis, and outline the laboratory confirmation of monkeypox.",

Robins-Browne RM, Bordun A-M, Tauschek M, Bennett-Wood VR, Russell J, Oppedisano F, et al.As part of a study to determine the effects of water filtration on the incidence of communityacquired gastroenteritis in Melbourne, Australia, we examined fecal samples from patients with gastroenteritis and asymptomatic persons for diarrheagenic strains of Escherichia coli. Atypical strains of enteropathogenic E. coli (EPEC) were the most frequently identified pathogens of all bacterial, viral, and parasitic agents in patients with gastroenteritis. Moreover, atypical EPEC were more common in patients with gastroenteritis (89 [12.8%] of 696) than in asymptomatic persons (11 [2.3%] of 489, P!0.0001). Twenty-two random isolates of atypical EPEC that were characterized further showed marked heterogeneity in terms of serotype, genetic subtype, and carriage of virulence-associated determinants. Apart from the surface protein, intimin, no virulence determinant or phenotype was uniformly present in atypical EPEC strains. This study shows that atypical EPEC are an important cause of gastroenteritis in Melbourne.Emerg Infect Dis[serial on the Internet] 2004 Oct [cited 04 October 2004].

We sought to investigate the factors associated with increases in CD4 cell count among human immunodeficiency virus (HIV)-positive antiretroviral-naive patients starting HAART.Methods: Five hundred ninety-six subjects were followed for a median of 2.5 years (interquartile range, 1.0-4.0 years). Factors associated with changes in CD4 cell counts in the first 3 months of HAART and from 3 months onwards were analyzed.Results: After 6, 12, and 24 months of HAART, the median increases in CD4 cell counts were 114, 181, and 248 cells/mm(3), respectively; 84%, 84%, and 80% of subjects had a virus load of !400 copies/mL during the same periods. White ethnicity, higher pre-HAART virus load, and lower pre-HAART CD4 and CD8 cell counts were associated with greater increases in CD4 cell counts during the first 3 months of HAART. From 3 months onward, a greater cumulative proportion of time spent with virus load !400 copies/mL was associated with a more favorable change in CD4 cell count (an average increase of 5.2 cells/mm(3)/year [95% confidence interval [CI], 3.8-6.7 cells/mm (3)/year] for each extra 10% cumulative time spent with a virus load !400 copies/mL) (P!0.0001). For every 100 cells/mm(3) higher in baseline CD4 cell count, the increase was 6 cells/mm(3)/year less (95% CI, 2-11 cells/mm(3)/year) (PZ0.02). Sex, risk group, age, and HAART regimen were not associated with increases in CD4 cell counts.Conclusions: These findings emphasize the importance of maintaining virological suppression and suggest other factors that influence long-term CD4 cell response. 2004; 190(10):1860-8.
