During influenza vaccine production, by either conventional or cell culture methods, there is a risk of incidental contamination by adventitious agents. Thus, a risk-assessment model has been developed to qualitatively assess the potential risk of vaccine process contamination by viral pathogens. The model takes into account the basic growth characteristics of each virus, its ability to grow in different cell substrates and resistance to processing steps during vaccine manufacture. The risk-assessment model has been applied to various pathogens to determine potential risk and relevance in different manufacturing scenarios, using different cell substrates for virus propagation, including Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) cells. Avian viruses, introduced via use of embryonated eggs for virus isolation, were found to present the greatest risk, irrespective of the substrate used for influenza virus propagation. The use of MDCK cells to propagate vaccine virus from egg-isolated influenza virus strains does not introduce a new or greater adventitious virus risk, compared with egg-based vaccine production. Indeed, the adventitious virus risk is potentially reduced as fewer viruses are able to grow in MDCK cells.",

Due to the timing of communication of composition to manufacturers, influenza vaccines are produced according to a rigid timescale, to ensure availability of the product before the onset of the influenza season. Any evidence of contamination observed during the compressed period of vaccine manufacture would be critical. Contaminated raw materials, process intermediates or influenza vaccine would have to be destroyed, irrespective of the form of the contaminant, unless the contaminating agent could be identified and it could be convincingly demonstrated that the agent could be effectively inactivated and removed. In a worst-case scenario, all production material would have to be disposed of, severely limiting influenza vaccine stocks for the upcoming influenza season.",

            "text": "The viral safety of conventional, inactivated influenza vaccines largely relies on the perceived limited growth of human viruses in embryonated eggs (virus filter effect) and on efficient virus inactivation during purification steps. However, little is known about the virus filter effect of egg passages. Furthermore, published data on the capacity of the vaccine processes in place to inactivate adventitious agents are not available for systematic review, and it is often assumed that the inactivation process completely inactivates likely viral contaminants. Thus, the viral safety of conventional influenza vaccines is primarily based upon historical safety records rather than specific data and facts. A novel risk-assessment model has been developed to qualitatively assess the risk of contamination of inactivated split and subunit influenza vaccines by a range of viruses and other agents that are not covered by bacterial sterility tests. To ensure broad applicability of the assessment, only common elements of the influenza vaccine production process were taken into account. In addition, to facilitate comparison of different viruses (despite the limited availability of data), relevant characteristics were rated in very basic, non-quantitative or semi-quantitative terms. The risk-assessment model uses a simple scoring approach (e.g. high, intermediate, or low) based on the characteristics of individual viruses, and an overall process risk-score is then calculated for each potential contaminant. The risk-assessment model can be used to identify potential contamination risks in influenza vaccine manufacture. It can also be used to compare and rate the relative risk associated with any of the viruses. The risk-assessment model does not take into account specific manufacturing processes and so can also serve as a useful tool to compare the relevance of any potential contaminant to different vaccine manufacturing processes using alternative cell substrates for the isolation and propagation of influenza virus. Risk control and risk reduction measures for different processes can then be developed, based on this initial assessment.",

The primary objective was to compare the potential contamina-tion risk of a proprietary Madin-Darby canine kidney (MDCK) 33016 cell-culture-derived influenza vaccine (OPTAFLU \u00ae , Novartis Vaccines) with that of conventional influenza vaccines. Risk has also been calculated for other cell substrates, or combinations thereof, including Vero cells, because of their potential application in the production of reassortant strains using reverse genetics [10] . The risk-assessment model has been applied to 23 viruses, and Mycoplasma and Chlamydia species, which could theoretically be introduced into the influenza vaccine manufacturing process either directly or through the influenza virus isolates. It is not designed, or intended, to replace a process-or product-specific assessment and does not allow a specific conclusion to be reached on the safety of any particular vaccine product. The purpose of the risk assessment is to provide an initial overview on process contamination risks, which can be used to prioritise measures taken to improve process robustness and product safety.",

The characteristics evaluated, and the scores assigned to each characteristic, are summarised in Table 1 , and described in more detail below. An overall process risk score is then calculated for each specific agent using a defined algorithm (Fig. 1) . The simple algorithm is based on multiplication of the scores assigned to each characteristic and so is designed to establish whether a risk level is maintained, reduced or increased at points in the vaccine manufacturing process. For each characteristic evaluated, a score of <1 denotes a reduced risk, a score of >1 denotes an increase in risk and a score of 1 indicates that the risk level is maintained. A score of 0 is given where assignment of a score is not appropriate (for example, an avian virus in a solely cell culture manufacturing scenario), and only where it forms part of a subcategory, where two scores are added rather than multiplied, so that calculated final scores will never be 0.",

Accepting a certain degree of imprecision, the scores derived from the risk assessment provide a scale on which different virus characteristics can be compared. For simple YES or NO parameters, only two scores were given: 1 for maintained risk or 0.5 for reduced risk. Where greater differentiation could be identified, scores were split further (e.g. for virus growth, score 2 for high virus titre/increased risk; score 1 for maintained virus titre/maintained risk; score 0.5 for moderately lower virus titre/decreased risk). As shown in Fig. 1 , the two scores attributed to the general growth properties category, and the two scores attributed to the growth in cell substrate category, are added before the combined score for each category is fed into the algorithm. The subordinate categories are not independent of each other, as a low score in one subcategory will not necessarily result in a reduction in the total risk for that whole category, and so multiplication within the categories would inadequately reduce high risks. Addition of the subcategory scores maintains a higher risk score and adds weight to the risk conferred by viral growth. This is considered appropriate since viral growth is one of the most relevant risk factors in vaccine manufacture.",

For standard MDCK cells, growth data were entirely derived from published data. For vaccine manufacturing scenarios using MDCK 33016 suspension cells, and thus serum-free growth conditions, viral growth was based on our own study results and so was distinguished from viral growth in standard MDCK cells, i.e. those commonly acquired from the American Type Culture Collection. Suspension cell cultures were inoculated to contain 10 4 TCID 50 /ml of each virus to be tested, and virus titres were monitored for at least 14 days. For all substrate types, certain simplifications were made for virus types from the same family; for example, parainfluenza III growth properties were taken as representative of parainfluenza I, II and IV, even though the latter species exhibit more restricted replication compared with parainfluenza III. Where contaminating virus growth is unrestricted in the cell substrate (e.g. peak titre >6 log 10 TCID 50 /ml or >3 log 10 above the inoculum titre), a score of 2 was assigned. Limited growth of a contaminating virus (e.g. peak titre <6 log 10 TCID 50 /ml or <3 log 10 above the inoculum titre), or those viruses requiring adaptation to grow in the cell substrate, were assigned a score of 1. If virus growth could not be confirmed, or if growth of a particular virus was deemed unlikely, a score of 0.5 was given. Where the inability of a particular contaminating agent to grow in a specific cell substrate has been confirmed experimentally, a score of 0.1 was given. A score of 0 was assigned where the specific agent being assessed is not present in the cell substrate, for example, an avian virus in a solely cell culture manufacturing scenario.",

The full scoring system for the risk-assessment calculation for the 23 viruses, Mycoplasma species and Chlamydia species, with regard to a conventional egg-based vaccine manufacturing scenario, is presented in Table 2 . The table shows the individual scores assigned for each evaluated characteristic, and the calculated process score and associated rank with regard to each pathogen. The non-enveloped avian birnavirus, avian polyomavirus and avian reovirus were attributed the highest overall process score of 9.00, due to their high growth potential in eggs. Mammalian reovirus also scored highly, ranking fourth after the avian viruses. The calculated process scores for most enveloped viruses, including the coronaviridae and the paramyxoviridae, were generally low, although herpes simplex virus (HSV) scored quite highly in the assessment (1.50). Table 3 presents the full scoring system for the same range of viruses when eggs are used for influenza virus isolation and MDCK 33016 suspension cells for influenza virus propagation. Again, the non-enveloped avian birnavirus, avian polyomavirus and avian reovirus were attributed the highest overall process scores, ranging from 4.73 to 6.75. Like many other cell substrates, MDCK 33016 cells support growth of mammalian reovirus, as demonstrated in our own studies, and so mammalian reovirus also scored highly. Conversely, our own studies have shown that adenoviruses and polyomaviruses do not grow in MDCK 33016 cells, therefore, these viruses were associated with a lower risk when MDCK 33016 cells were used for influenza virus propagation, compared with a conventional egg-based manufacturing process. Table 4 shows the calculated overall process scores for all six manufacturing scenarios evaluated, together with the average risk scores and rank for each pathogen across the different scenarios. With a few exceptions, similar process scores were obtained for each pathogen, regardless of the manufacturing scenario, with high scores attributed to avian reovirus, avian birnavirus and avian polyomavirus. Mammalian reovirus also achieved high scores against each manufacturing scenario. Adenoviruses and JC/BK polyomaviruses achieved 2-to 4-fold higher scores if Vero cells are to be used for influenza virus propagation, compared with scenarios not using Vero cells (Table 4) . Similarly, scores for human picornaviridae increased when Vero cells were involved. Mycoplasma species and Chlamydia species achieved low scores in all assessments, regardless of the cell substrate used for influenza virus isolation and propagation. Table 4 also shows the summed process score for each manufacturing scenario, which gives an indication of the relative risk of contamination associated with each scenario. A conventional egg-based manufacturing process (egg > egg) scenario produced a summed score of 41, compared with 28 for virus isolation in eggs and production in MDCK 33016 cells (eggs > MDCK 33016 cells). None of the individual scores in the egg > MDCK 33016 scenario was higher than those in the egg > egg scenario. Furthermore, an MDCK > MDCK 33016 scenario, where MDCK cells are also used for virus isolation, produced an even lower summed score of 13; higher summed scores were obtained when Vero cells were involved in the process.",

Reoviruses are common in all species and tend to grow in almost any cell type. Our own studies have shown reoviruses to be very resistant to chemical inactivation and to be more likely to survive downstream purification steps due to their stable, double-stranded nucleic acid material and their capsid structure, compared with non-enveloped viruses. Adenoviruses, polyomaviruses and enteroviruses were also linked with rather higher risks than other pathogens, particularly when Vero cells were used at any stage. Enveloped viruses are generally susceptible to chemical inactivation methods and to the detergent treatment used in the downstream processing during influenza vaccine manufacture, and so most enveloped viruses achieved low scores, with the exception of HSV. From our own studies and the published literature, it was found that HSV grows rapidly in all the cell substrates evaluated in this assessment [12, 15, 16, 22] . Using this risk-assessment model, we have shown that using MDCK 33016 cells for influenza virus propagation from an eggderived influenza isolate (egg > MDCK 33016) potentially reduces the chance of viral contamination compared with conventional eggbased influenza vaccine manufacture (egg > egg), as fewer viruses are able to grow in the MDCK 33016 cell substrate. Using MDCK cells for virus propagation did not increase the relative risk posed by any human pathogen compared with conventional egg-based vaccine manufacture.",

This is an important finding as MDCK cells have been used for influenza virus isolation, but such isolates have not yet been used for vaccine manufacture due to the unknown risk of contamination by extraneous viruses. Currently, only egg-derived isolates are used for influenza vaccine manufacture. Furthermore, use of MDCK cells for both influenza virus isolation and production may provide vaccines that are a closer antigenic match to influenza strains circulating in the human population than vaccines in which virus strains are isolated in eggs [29, 30] .

            "text": "When the risk-assessment model was applied to other manufacturing scenarios, the use of Vero cells increased or maintained the overall risk; compared with other scenarios, Vero cells support the growth of a wide range of viruses, including many human pathogens [11] [12] [13] [14] [15] [16] 18, 19, [23] [24] [25] 31] . If Vero cells are used instead of eggs for influenza virus isolation or propagation, contamination with avian viruses is avoided. However, the risk of contamination with other viruses is either maintained or increased, e.g. adenoviruses, polyomaviruses, enteroviruses, rhinoviruses, reovirus, and varicella zoster virus. A combination of eggs for influenza virus isolation and Vero cells for further passaging introduces even higher risks, because of the possibility of contamination with avian viruses. This latter scenario would most likely apply for future applications of Vero cell-based reverse-genetics techniques to produce influenza strains. These plasmid-based techniques include other measures to reduce initial contaminants from the virus strains, but do not exclude contamination originating from the human operator during cell culture.",

This is particularly relevant for influenza vaccine manufacture, where discovery of any sort of viral contamination would be critical, and so the same technical counter measures drawn from the risk assessment will apply to both low-and high-pathogenicity viruses. As influenza vaccine manufacturers worldwide are supplied with the same reference virus isolates, and as influenza vaccines are produced according to a rigid timescale, any evidence of non-pathogenic contamination is likely to negatively impact on vaccine manufacture. Not only would this present a commercial risk for vaccine manufacturers, it may also present a public health risk, due to delayed vaccine supply.",
