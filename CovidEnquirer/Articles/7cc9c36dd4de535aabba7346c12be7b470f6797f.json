Perhaps because hygiene does not require clever new technologies or products, or perhaps because it is a domestic and personal issue largely aff ecting women and children, and perhaps because it concerns the neglected diarrhoeal and respiratory diseases (still the two biggest killers of children), hygiene is still very much overlooked in public health. There are signs that the situation is beginning to improve. Governments and funding agencies increasingly accept that hygiene promotion should play a part in health investments across the wider community, not just in health-care settings. Policy makers are also realising that the health benefi ts of increased investment in water and sanitation infrastructure are largely delivered through improvements in personal and domestic hygiene. 2 Original approaches using new insights are modernising the hygiene sector, making it more attractive to investors.",

Among these avoidable infections prevention of diarrhoeal diseases is most important. Because the source of infections is human faecal material, the most important hygiene behaviours are clearly those that keep faecal matter out of the domestic environment. Adequate handwashing after contact with faeces is also crucial (after one's own defecation, after handling the faeces of children, or after contact with a faeces-contaminated environment). Other ways of preventing the faecal-oral transmission of infections include keeping water, foods, and surfaces free of faecal contamination and preventing carriage by fl ies. Safe food handling and preparation is also important, especially for children, as is the avoidance of animal faeces and the safe storage and use of water. 3 Other diseases that can be prevented by adequate hygiene include respiratory infections, trachoma, and skin infections. Endoparasites, such as roundworm and hookworm, and ectoparasites including scabies and fl eas, can also be avoided.",

            "text": "Public health practitioners commonly use information from four sources when weighing up the risk of infectious disease. First, they can assess the biological likelihood that a particular practice will place individuals at risk of infection. Second, they can use risk mapping-for example, modelling of the transfer of microbes between surfaces and hosts in homes and hospitals 4 or use of the hazard analysis critical control points method for assessing risk in food preparation. 5 However, these approaches depend on access to good estimates of environmental contamination, which are largely unavailable for developing countries. Third, health practitioners can use correlations between recorded practices and disease incidence from observational studies. These data are more readily available, but can be misleading. 6 Hygiene behaviour is commonly associated with socioeconomic factors, such as wealth, education, Review access to water, and modern lifestyle attitudes, 7 all of which infl uence the risk of infectious disease. Such strong socioeconomic confounding is diffi cult, if not impossible, to address analytically. 8 The fourth source of information for public health policy making is randomised controlled trials (RCTs), which control for confounding. However, very few RCTs of hygiene promotion programmes have been undertaken in developing countries, and those that have been done have several methodological fl aws. For example, the masking of participants to the intervention is diffi cult, and as a result, mothers who are grateful for an intervention may be less likely to report disease in their children, leading to infl ated eff ect sizes. 9 Bias is thus a serious issue in unblinded studies on diarrhoea. 10 Given these caveats, what can we say about the prevention of diarrhoeal disease through hygiene? Table 1 draws together our assessment of the available evidence, from reviews and other key papers, concerning the four sources of information: biological plausibility, risk modelling, observational studies, and RCTs.",

            "text": "The best studied hygiene practice in developing countries is that of handwashing. Evidence from all four types of source is consistent, with RCTs of handwashing interventions showing reductions in diarrhoea of around 30%, and of 43-47% if soap is used. 11, 12 Handwashing can also reduce other infections; one review suggested it could reduce respiratory infection by 16%, 13 and a more recent cluster-randomised trial in Pakistan reported a reduction in acute lower respiratory tract infections of 50%. 14 Handwashing also reduces neonatal mortality, 15 trachoma, 16 and parasitic worm infections. 17 Face or whole-body washing are less well researched but might help to control skin infections and trachoma. 18 An unclean face is associated with increased risk of trachoma, 19, 20 and a randomised trial suggested that face washing reduces the risk of severe trachoma infection substantially. 21 Handwashing with soap mitigated the severe acute respiratory syndrome epidemic 22 and is one of the key practices recommended to counter possible infl uenza pandemics. 23 Although food-borne infection is the main route of transmission of gastrointestinal infections in developed countries, their contribution to the burden of diarrhoea in low-income settings is unclear. Hot climates, poor storage facilities, and faecal contamination of the environment all make food-borne infection more likely. Therefore, food-borne infections are likely to play a major part in diarrhoeal disease transmission in low-income settings. 24 Microbiological studies have shown the ability of many pathogens to grow quickly in food, especially in hot climates. 24, 25 Contaminated weaning food, in particular, has been suggested as a major contributor to diarrhoea in low-income settings, 26 although observational studies gave inconclusive results. 24 Most of what we assume about food-borne infections in low-income settings is based on expert opinion and biological plausibility, rather than fi eld data (eg, WHO's manual Five Keys to Safer Food). 27 Several trials have assessed the eff ect of promoting exclusive breastfeeding on food-borne infections, with equivocal results. 28, 29 Food hygiene interventions have rarely been systematically tested. In one of the very few intervention studies of improving childhood feeding practices, which included some food-hygiene education, Bhandari and colleagues 30 found little eff ect on the nutritional status of children in rural India. The results of a recent trial done in Mali suggested that the microbiological safety of weaning food could be signifi cantly improved with hazard-control principles in homes. 31 Other routes of infection that could be removed by better hygiene are related to contact with child 7,32,33 and animal faeces. 34 A meta-analysis of observational studies of hygiene practices associated with child faeces found that failure to remove child faeces and unhygienic handling practices were associated with a 23% increased risk of diarrhoea. 35 Other observational studies have reported that animals kept in shared outdoor living spaces (compounds) increase the risk of diarrhoea by over 50%. [36] [37] [38] However, no studies that we know of have quantifi ed the risks associated with the use of cow dung for fuel or in house maintenance. So far no intervention trials have aimed to reduce animal faecal contamination in domestic spaces. Neither are there any reports of trials of improving the disposal of child faeces by use of potties, nappies, or child-friendly toilets.",

One way to improve this situation is to use more objective out come measures, such as health-care seeking, assessments by health-care workers masked to intervention status, or mortality. Future hygiene trials need to be larger to model full-scale programme implementation and more intensive (and therefore costly) than previous trials to objectively assess outcomes. Large, adequately funded trials are urgently needed to assess the eff ects of intervening to improve three key practices in particular: handwashing, safe disposal of child stools, and promotion of food hygiene.",

One reason for this is that questionnaire-based surveys are inadequate for gathering data about private and morally bound issues such as food and hand hygiene because they overestimate rates of handwashing, for example, by two to three times. 52 Eff orts are continuing to identify indicators of hygiene practice that are both valid and simple to collect. [53] [54] [55] An article 56 published in 2009 collated data about directly observed handwashing in 11 countries, and we identifi ed another survey 57 from Bangladesh in 2008 (table 2) . Handwashing with soap by child carers at key moments, such as after using the toilet, was rare, varying from 3% in Ghana to 42% in Kerala, India. Handwashing with water alone happens on a further 45% of occasions, on average. Handwashing with soap was also rare after cleaning up children and before handling food. If these fi gures are a good guide, less than one in six children in developing countries is protected from disease by handwashing with soap at key moments. This contributes perhaps a million unnecessary deaths to the global toll. 61 Handwashing behaviour is far from ideal in developed countries. In a motorway service station in the south of England, just 65% of women and 31% of men washed their hands with soap after using the toilet facilities, 62 Review dirty nappy. 63 A survey by Judah and co-workers 64 reported that 28% of commuters in fi ve UK cities had bacteria of faecal origin on their hands. If improvement of hygiene practices, such as handwashing with soap, has the potential to be one of the most cost-eff ective ways in which public health can be improved in developing countries, how should we go about it? Though changing behaviour is diffi cult, we know a lot more about hygiene behaviour than we did 10 years ago and promising approaches to changing hygiene on a large scale are emerging.",

            "text": "Risky hygiene behaviours persist around the world because of a web of factors that can be hard to shift. Poor environmental conditions, such as lack of water, sanitation, and drainage, have a role. Other obstacles include the absence of hard surfaces that can easily be kept clean, unavailability of cleaning materials such as soap and surface cleansers, and limited access to hygiene aids, such as potties or nappies. Local social structures and cultural norms, as well as individual psychological factors, also help to keep present practices locked in place. For behaviour to change one, or several, of these factors will have to be addressed, but to do so will require a better understanding of them. Several formative research studies that aimed to provide an understanding to enable the design of eff ective handwash programmes have investigated the behavioural aspects of hygiene. [65] [66] [67] A review of 11 studies done in Africa, Asia, and Latin America concluded that, although there are local diff erences, common patterns exist. Three kinds of hygiene behaviour were identifi ed: habitual, motivated, and planned. 56 Hygiene habits were learnt at an early age, but soap use was rarely taught by parents or schools. Key motivations for handwashing were disgust of contamination on hands and to do what everyone else was perceived to be doing (social norms). Other motivations included comfort and nurturance (the desire to care for one's children). Planned handwashing, with the aim of preventing disease, took place rarely. Mothers did not fi nd the threat of diarrhoeal disease particularly relevant and found the connection between handwashing and possible diarrhoea in children tenuous. Mothers did, however, plan to teach their children good manners, and they also planned to economise by ensuring that soap was not wasted. Aunger and colleagues 68 observed that habit was the most powerful determinant of handwashing in Kenya, followed by several motives including disgust, and social norms, and cognitive plans to save money. An investigation into nurses' handwashing in Australia saw evidence of a similar distinction between planned and motivated or habitual handwashing behaviour. 69 A study of routine behaviour and hygiene in rural India suggested that some handwashing behaviours are deeply embedded in daily routines and hence highly habitual, whereas others are motivated by the transient disgust or discomfort of having dirty hands. 70 The psychological factors determining hygiene are related to factors in the environment. For example, when local social norms are the source of poor handwashing habits people commonly practise what they perceive everyone else to be doing, which reinforces the norm of not using soap. Lack of water and a perception that soap is too expensive for handwashing could also constrain handwashing (though this might be post-rationalisation because one review suggested that soap was present in 97% of all households in a review, but it was used mainly for clothes, body, and dish washing). 56 Finally, fear of epidemics such as cholera or severe acute respiratory syndrome (but not of endemic diarrhoeas that cause far more deaths) could also lead to improved hygiene. 56 Although an understanding of the determinants of handwashing behaviour is helpful, how such insight can be used in behaviour change programmes is not always obvious. The fi gure summarises the psychological and environmental factors that are likely to determine hygiene behaviour. 56 If much handwashing is habitual, then the cues that trigger these habits need to be found and the habits established at an early age. Environmental changes that make handwashing easier and cheaper, such as the introduction of simple water-saving technologies (eg, socalled tippy taps), could be helpful (although how their use could become widespread is unclear), as could information suggesting that handwashing with soap is a desirable social norm where it is not one.",

Further analytical studies into the eff ectiveness and cost-eff ectiveness of diff erent channels of communication are needed. We need to know more about the diff erential impact of diff erent approaches on the low-income sections of society, which are at greatest risk of death from diarrhoeal disease and have fewer resources to commit to hygiene. 80 We also need data to calculate dose-response curves: how much intervention produces how much behaviour change, and hence what level of investment is most cost eff ective?",

Such agencies are often willing to implement hygiene promotion, but rarely have the specifi c expertise or capacity to develop the approaches themselves. Several examples of simple, eff ective, attractive, and costed activities and materials that have been tested and have been shown to work, are needed so that organisations can adapt these to local circumstances.",
