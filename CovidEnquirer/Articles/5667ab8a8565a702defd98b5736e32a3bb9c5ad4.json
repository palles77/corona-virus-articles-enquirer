The purpose of this publication is to provide a standardized nomenclature and diagnostic criteria for classifying lesions in the digestive system including the salivary glands and the exocrine pancreas of laboratory rats and mice. Most lesions are illustrated by color photomicrographs. The standardized nomenclature, the diagnostic criteria, and the photomicrographs are also available electronically on the Internet (http://www.goreni.org/). Sources of material included histopathology databases from government, academia, and industrial laboratories throughout the world. Content includes spontaneous and age related lesions as well as lesions induced by exposure to test items. Relevant infectious and parasitic lesions are included as well. A widely accepted and utilized international harmonization of nomenclature and diagnostic criteria for the digestive system will decrease misunderstandings among regulatory and scientific research organizations in different countries and provide a common language to increase and enrich international exchanges of information among toxicologists and pathologists.",

In routine H&E sections where the morphology clearly represents apoptosis or single cell necrosis, or whereby special procedures (e.g. TEM or IHC for caspases) prove one or the other, individual diagnoses may be used. However, because of the overlapping morphologies, necrosis and apoptosis are not always readily distinguishable via routine examination, and the two processes may occur sequentially and/or simultaneously depending on intensity and duration of the noxious agent (Zeiss 2003) . This often makes it difficult and impractical to differentiate between both during routine light microscopic examination.

The presence of various inflammatory cell infiltrates in the absence of other features of inflammation should be diagnosed as an 'infiltrate' with predominate/appropriate cell type(s) identified. However, when other prominent morphologic features (congestion, hyperemia, hemorrhage, edema, necrosis, fibrosis, foreign material, bacterial organisms, etc.) are present, it is preferable to characterize the change as an inflammatory process (inflammation) with specific descriptors. The reader is referred to the Nomenclature and Review of Basic Principles Document for discussion on the preferred use of descriptive, rather than diagnostic terminology (Mann et al. 2012) . Listed below are descriptive diagnostic terms and examples of inflammatory cell infiltrates or types of inflammation.

Pepsinogen is converted into active pepsin in the acid environment which then hydrolyses proteins into polypeptide fragments. Self digestion of the stomach mucosa is prevented by a layer of surface mucous which has a higher pH than the gastric juice due to secretion of bicarbonate ions by the surface mucous cells.

The stomach should be gently but sufficiently stretched to produce a flattened surface of both nonglandular and glandular regions but excessive stretching should be avoided. Alternatively, the pylorus may be ligated and the stomach inflated with fixative for a short period, before opening and flattening between filter paper prior to further fixation (Mahler et al. 2000) However, an excessive volume must not be used to avoid excessive stretching. Trimming of stomach should be undertaken as specified in the goRENI trimming guide (website.reni.item.fraunhofer.de/ reni/trimming) so that standardized sections of nonglandular epithelium, corpus, antrum and pyloric-duodenal junction are obtained. The ratios of parietal and chief cells in the fundic glands and the height of the mucosa vary between lesser and greater curvature so inter-animal variation in trimming needs to be avoided and a sensitivity to topography maintained. Furthermore it is important to recognize that the glandular corpus mucosa may be minimal or absent along the lesser curvature with the antral mucosa extending to the limiting ridge.",

In routine H&E sections where the morphology clearly represents apoptosis or single cell necrosis, or whereby special procedures (e.g. TEM or IHC for caspases) prove one or the other, individual diagnoses may be used. However, because of the overlapping morphologies, necrosis and apoptosis are not always readily distinguishable via routine examination, and the two processes may occur sequentially and/or simultaneously depending on intensity and duration of the noxious agent (Zeiss 2003) .

They are usually observed in mucus neck cells of the glandular mucosa near the limiting ridge and occasionally may be accompanied by hyaline eosinophilic crystals. Eosinophilic globules may be considered a precursor of these crystals. Formation of these cells is also associated with the administration of gastric antisecretory agents although the incidence is not proportional to the neuroendocrine cell hyperplasia which also occurs with these agents (Betton et al. 1988 ). The eosinophilic granules are similar to those seen in other epithelia e.g. upper and lower respiratory tract or pancreas (Leininger et al. 1999; Renne et al. 2009 ). Once thought to be accumulation of mucosubstances or pepsinogen, they have been shown to be composed of a Ym1/Ym2 a chitinase-like protein that may be produced in response to mucosal irritation Rogers and Houghton 2009) . The use of the term hyalinosis for this lesion will potentially cause confusion in safety assessment as the same term may also be used for a distinctly different clinical disorder in humans and can be used to describe vascular and renal glomerular changes.",

In routine H&E sections where the morphology clearly represents apoptosis or single cell necrosis, or whereby special procedures (e.g. TEM or IHC for caspases) prove one or the other, individual diagnoses may be used. However, because of the overlapping morphologies, necrosis and apoptosis are not always readily distinguishable via routine examination, and the two processes may occur sequentially and/or simultaneously depending on intensity and duration of the noxious agent (Zeiss 2003) . This often makes it difficult and impractical to differentiate between both during routine light microscopic examination.

These techniques are reviewed in detail by Elmore (Elmore 2007) . Some of these confirmatory techniques detect early phases of apoptosis, in contrast to the evaluation of H&E stained sections, which detects late phases only; overall interpretation of findings should take into account these potential differences.

Several classes of metaplasia have been identified based on these additional techniques, which may have relevance for modeling human gastric pathogenesis. True intestinal metaplasia (metaplasia with development of a genuine intestinal phenotype) is very rare in rodents but has been induced by PCBs in mice (Morgan et al. 1981) . \"Pseudopyloric\" metaplasia where the cells resemble antral cells morphologically and histochemically is much more common. Authentic intestinal metaplasia is best confirmed by immunohistochemistry for the intestinal-specific nuclear protein Cdx2 (Fox et al. 2007 ). Pseudopyloric/intestinal metaplasia occurs in the rodent stomach as a change associated with some experimentally induced cancers (e.g. following administration of polychlorinated biphenyls), localized ionizing radiation, injection of xenogenic stomach antigens and the non carcinogen, iodoacetamide (Greaves 2012) , as well as infectious models in mice such as H. felis and H. pylori (Leininger et al. 1999; Rogers and Fox 2004) .",

Silver stains e.g. Wartin-Starry can be used to confirm the presence of helicobacter in tissues section.",

Papillomas may also extend into the submucosa and thereby displace the muscularis mucosa. The presence of carcinomatous foci in an otherwise benign appearing papilloma is indicative of malignancy (Fukushima and Ito, 1985; Tsukamoto et al. 2007 ). In general, the lack of cellular atypia allows a distinction to be made. Many squamous cell carcinomas in the nonglandular stomach are exophytic which can result in partial or total occlusion of the lumen. The exophytic portion can be papillary resembling papilloma. Chemically-induced (e.g. butylated hydroxyanisole, 1,2-dibromo-ethane) squamous cell carcinomas may contain mostly basal or spindle cells with little squamous differentiation. These tumors are considered a morphological variant of the more typical squamous cell carcinoma. Ultrastructurally, squamous cell carcinomas contain typical desmosomes and bundles of electron-dense tonofilaments. Some chemicals especially when given by gavage cause highly malignant squamous cells carcinomas in rats which metastasize to the peritoneal cavity and lungs (Olson et al. 1973) .",

The base of the crypt is lined by stem cells; the remainder of the crypt is composed of proliferating epithelial cells which either migrate up the villi as they differentiate into absorptive cells with microvilli or goblet cells, with a turnover time of about 3 days, or remain in the crypt and differentiate into Paneth cells. The villous epithelium is composed of tall columnar cells with surface microvilli (the main absorptive cells), goblet cells containing mucus and scattered neuroendocrine cells covering a lamina propria composed of connective tissue with a rich vascular and lymphatic network. The lamina propria contains variable numbers of lymphocytes, macrophages, plasma cells, eosinophils and/ or mast cells whilst occasional intraepithelial lymphocytes can also be observed. Paneth cells, which have an exocrine serous morphology and produce antimicrobial peptides, are present in higher numbers in the crypts of jejunum and ileum compared to the duodenum. Brunner's glands, which produce a bicarbonate rich secretion, are present in the submucosa immediately following the pyloric-duodenal junction. Villi in the duodenum are taller than those in jejunum and ileum. Jejunum and ileum can be hard to differentiate in cross section except that the terminal ileum has two serosal attachments (mesentery and ligamentum ileocecale) compared to the single mesenteric attachment of the jejunum. With age, the duodenal villi tend to become shorter and thicker due to increased amounts of fibrous connective tissue in the core, whilst those in the ileum become longer probably related to reduced absorption in the proximal intestine resulting in greater amounts of nutrients passing into the distal intestine (Shackelford and Elwell 1999) .",

Similar aggregations are present in other parts of the gastrointestinal tract and are collectively referred to as gastrointestinal-associated lymphoid tissue (GALT). Villi are absent from the large intestine and instead the mucosa is thrown into transverse or longitudinal folds. In mice and rats the folds of the proximal colon have a distinctive spiral orientation. The mucosa is lined by a single layer of three cell types: absorptive cells, goblet (mucous) cells and neuroendocrine cells. There is a zone of proliferation in each gland and cells either migrate outwards and differentiate into absorptive or goblet cells or remain in the basal part of the gland as secretory cells. The turnover time of the absorptive and outer goblet cells is 4.6 days, that of the deep crypt secretory cells 14 to 21 days (Karam 1999) . Aggregates of lymphoid cells may be found in the mucosa and submucosa of all parts of the large intestine, but these are not limited to the antimesenteric aspect as in the small intestine.",

Disease processes or test articles that interfere with these processes will often produce diarrhea. Less commonly muscle function is compromised leading to impaction of rectum and colon and clinical constipation. The mucosa of the small intestine is a site of high enzyme activity and conjugation reactions and consequently orally administered test articles may be metabolized, activated or deactivated in the intestine.

Due to variations in morphology along the length of both small and large intestine it is important there is consistent sampling at necropsy and consistent orientation on the slide. The GoRENI trimming guide (website.reni.item. fraunhofer.de/reni/trimming) specifies the following sites for routine examination: 1) Duodenum: 1 cm distal to the pyloric sphincter; 2) Jejunum: central section; 3) Ileum: 1 cm proximal to cecum; 4) Cecum; 5) Colon: central section; and 6) Rectum: 2 cm proximal to the anus. For investigative studies involving induction of intestinal tumors, the entire intestine can be opened, lesion location and size recorded and individual tumors may be fixed for sectioning in additional to the 6 standard sections. Alternatively the whole length of the intestine can be fixed using the Swiss roll method. However, opening the intestine and washing away contents with normal saline brings the risk of damaging the delicate mucosa which degenerates quickly due to post mortem autolysis; tissue orientation may be less reliable during subsequent tissue trimming and blocking using this method. In addition, it is important to note the amount and quality of ingesta/digesta present in the segments of intestine sampled for histological examination as this may affect the height of the mucosa.",

In routine H&E sections where the morphology clearly represents apoptosis or single cell necrosis, or whereby special procedures (e.g. TEM or IHC for caspases) prove one or the other, individual diagnoses may be used. However, because of the overlapping morphologies, necrosis and apoptosis are not always readily distinguishable via routine examination, and the two processes may occur sequentially and/or simultaneously depending on intensity and duration of the noxious agent (Zeiss 2003) . This often makes it difficult and impractical to differentiate between both during routine light microscopic examination.

These techniques are reviewed in detail by Elmore (2007) . Some of these confirmatory techniques detect early phases of apoptosis, in contrast to the evaluation of H&E stained sections, which detects late phases only; overall interpretation of findings should take into account these potential differences.

A variety of agents e.g. cysteamine, proprionitrile and 1-methy-4-pheny-1,2,3,6-tetrahydropyridine (MPTP) are capable of producing chronic ulcers in the duodenum possibly by altering gastric acid secretion, bicarbonate production and its delivery to the duodenum, changes in duodenal motility and/or dopamine inhibition (Szabo and Cho 1988) . Some viral and bacterial infections may induce erosion and ulceration, particularly in immunodeficient mice or rats (Haines et al. 1998 ). Erosion/ulcer usually is the result of epithelial necrosis. Because of its unique topography adjacent to the lumen and often involving multiple organ layers, which uniquely affects the progression and resolution of the lesion (e.g. margin hyperplasia, granulomatous tissue, inflammation), it is useful to record erosion/ulcer separately from epithelial necrosis.",

In the mouse it is predominantly seromucinous, where as, in the rat it is mostly mucinous with a small serous component (Gresik, 1994; Ozono et al. 1991; Tucker, 2007) ). The submandibular gland is comprised of several adenomeres with large pyramidal mucous cells that are flanked basally by variable numbers of cresentric serous demilunes. The large pyramidal mucous cells have abundant vesicular basophilic cytoplasm and basally located nuclei and the cresentric serous demilunes have scant eosinophilic cytoplasm and hyperchromatic nuclei. The acinar secretions from the adenomeres empty into intercalated ducts lined by low cuboidal to columnar epithelial cells. Few oncocytes are interspersed between the cuboidal epithelial cells of the intercalated ducts of aged rats. These cells are characterized by abundant granular eosinophilic cytoplasm (abundant mitochondria) and a central hyperchromatic nucleus. Thin fusiform myoepithelial cells are located between the basal lamina and epithelial cells of acini and intercalated ducts (Bogart, 10970; Sashima, 1986) . Only in the submandibular gland, the intercalated ducts continue into granular (convoluted) ducts. The granular ducts are lined by tall columnar epithelial cells with abundant eosinophilic granular cytoplasm. The granulation of these ducts is much more prominent in sexually mature males when compared to females (Figures 156 and 157) . These ducts continue into striated (intralobular) ducts that are lined by a single layer of tall columnar epithelial cells with marked basal infoldings (hence, striated cells) and central to apically located nuclei. Several of the striated (intralobular) ducts merge into interlobular excretory ducts that are lined by tall columnar epithelial cells with more apically located nuclei and prominent cytoplasmic striations. Several interlobular excretory ducts continue into one main excretory duct that expands into a diverticulum lined by simple columnar epithelium and end as squamous epithelium at the oral surface.",

Most cell types within the submaxillary and parotid glands have both sympathetic and parasympathetic innervations while the sublingual glands have scant sympathetic innervation limited to striated ducts and blood vessels (Garrett et al. 1991 ). The parasympathetic system and the \u03b1-adrenergic sympathetic system regulate the water and inorganic ion phase of the primary secretory fluid, whereas the \u03b2-adrenergic sympathetic system effects primarily the macromolecular (enzymes) phase. Parasympathetic stimulation is mainly responsible for stimulation of the salivary acini resulting in copious secretion of saliva, however, the sympathetic stimulation does not inhibit salivary secretion but it modulates the saliva composition and causes salivary secretion to a lesser extent (Proctor and Carpenter 2007) . The sympathetic and parasympathetic stimulation of the myoepithelial cells surrounding the acini results in contraction of acini and directing the saliva into the ducts (Tucker 2007) . Surprisingly, it is the sympathetic stimulation but not parasympathetic stimulation that results in morphologically obvious depletion of storage granules within the acini (Garrett et al. 1991) . \u03b2-adrenergic sympathomimetic agonists such as isoprenaline (Selye et al. 1961 ) and terbutaline (Sodicoff et al. 1980 ) first cause rapid depletion of secretory granules and later promotes re-synthesis of secretory material leading to acinar cell hypertrophy and hyperplasia. On the other hand, \u03b2-adrenergic antagonists like propranolol suppress salivary secretions and eventually cause acinar atrophy (Fukuda 1968) .",

In routine H&E sections where the morphology clearly represents apoptosis or single cell necrosis, or whereby special procedures (e.g. TEM or IHC for caspases) prove one or the other, individual diagnoses may be used. However, because of the overlapping morphologies, necrosis and apoptosis are not always readily distinguishable via routine examination, and the two processes may occur sequentially and/or simultaneously depending on intensity and duration of the noxious agent (Zeiss 2003) .

These techniques are reviewed in detail by Elmore (Elmore 2007) .

It may be an age related lesion or may be induced experimentally, usually as a secondary response after obstruction of excretory ducts or after alteration of trophic factors. Examples for obstruction of excretory ducts include ligation (Bhaskar et al. 1956; Standish and Shafer 1957) , sialoliths and foreign bodies. Testosterone, adrenocorticoids, and sympathetic stimulation are important trophic factors for the salivary glands. Any experimental condition that acts on their homeostasis may potentially induce diffuse salivary gland atrophy. This has been shown for hypophysectomy (Koerker 1967) , adrenalectomy, denervation and \u03b1-and \u03b2-adrenergic antagonists. Also decreased food consumption, and protein starvation lead to salivary gland atrophy. Atrophy of salivary glands due to liquid diet affects parotid and submandibular glands but the sublingual glands are apparently spared (Hall and Schneyer 1964; Scott and Gunn 1991) . Also, the sublingual glands lack sympathetic innervation and thus are spared in situations where the chemicals act on the sympathetic nervous system. Salivary gland atrophy was noted in F344 rats treated with sodium dichromate dihydrate (NTP, 2008) . Often, salivary atrophy is accompanied by mild chronic inflammation and mild interstitial fibrosis.",

Single or repeated mandibular incisor tooth amputation also resulted in enlargement of submandibular glands, presumably due to neural regulation (Wells 1963) . This enlargement was due to abundant intracytoplasmic accumulation of mucus along with calcium, amylase and other protein.

The sublingual glands are reportedly spared from pathologic changes in SDAV infections (Jacoby 1985) . However, the sublingual excretory ducts may have ductal squamous metaplasia in the absence of SDAV infections. Vitamin A deficient diet induced squamous metaplasia in the ducts of parotid, submandibular and sublingual glands in Sprague-Dawley rats (Horn et al. 1996) . Squamous cell metaplasia in the submandibular gland was described in mice after treatment with DMBA and was proven to be of ductal segment origin by the presence of keratin proteins (Takai et al. 1986 ).",

Hyperplasia of the salivary ducts is a common feature of many inflammatory and reactive conditions in the salivary glands of rodents (Greaves 2012) . Multifocal ductal cell hyperplasia was induced in the intercalated duct cells of the submandibular salivary glands of Wistar rats after chronic treatment with a steroidal test article comprising prostagenic and estrogenic properties (De Rijk et al. 2003) . Spontaneous hyperplastic changes of the salivary gland have not been observed in B6C3F1 mice (Botts et al. 1999) . Transgenic mice models were reported to show hyperplasia of the submandibular glands in serous acinar cells expressing a retinoid acid receptor (B\u00e9rard et al. 1994) and ductular cells expressing simian virus 40 T antigen (Ewald et al. 1996) , respectively.",

Transgenic mice expressing a human Ha-ras oncogene developed adenosquamous carcinomas arising from the serous areas of the submandibular gland (Nielsen et al.1991) . Also adenosquamous carcinomas of the mammary gland, which are not uncommon in mice, need to be considered as a differential diagnosis. Squamous cell carcinomas of the salivary glands should be distinguished from invasive Zymbal's gland carcinomas with squamous differentiation by their location in situ (Neuenschwander and Elwell 1990) . (Botts et al. 1999; Frith and Heath 1994; Dawe 1979 (Botts et al. 1999; Frith and Heath 1994) . The differentiation between the mixed malignant tumor and the malignant myoepithelioma with epithelioid and spindeloid growth pattern may be difficult based on hematoxylin and eosin stained slides. Confirmatory immunohistochemistry may be required which in case of the mixed tumor would demonstrate two different tissue compartments that show either epithelial or mesenchymal immunophenotype, but usually not a mixed one. In contrast, mixed epithelial and mesenchymal antigenic expression would be demonstrated in case of the myoepithelioma.",

Comment: Myoepitheliomas of the salivary glands have not been described in rats. They are rare in most strains of mice but occur more often in the BALB/c, A/J, and C58 strains (mainly females). The most frequent locations are the parotid and submandibular glands (Frith and Ward 1988 ), but they are not limited to salivary glands or the cervical region. Neoplastic myoepithelial cells have been reported to stain positive for cytokeratin and for keratins K5 and K14 and vimentin. Also PTAH staining will aid in confirmation of the intracytoplasmic fibrils within the myoepithelial cells (Botts et al. 1999; Sundberg et al. 1991) . They are negative for smooth muscle cell alpha-actin immunohistochemistry, in contrast to normal myoepithelial cells; furthermore, Sundberg et al. has suggested that the neoplasms arise from a subset of extraglandular ductal myoepithelial cells that are negative for smooth muscle cell alpha-actin (Sundberg et al. 1991) . Such confirmatory stains may be required for differentiation of myoepitheliomas from scirrhous/anaplastic squamous cell carcinomas or mixed malignant tumors.",

Although most of these tumors have been ascribed to the salivary glands, it needs to be taken into account that they may occur from any other glandular tissue, e.g. the mammary gland or extraorbital lacrimal gland. The frequent poor encapsulation, pleomorphic morphology, and central necrosis are compatible with a malignant interpretation; however, Sundberg et al. suggested few are malignant based on stringent criteria of metastasis to the lung or infiltration of underlying bone (Sundberg et al. 1991) . The morphology of tumors with confirmed metastases is not unique, as compared to those without, and the clinical appearance of the neoplasms may lead to culling prior to development of readily defined metastases, so it is recommended that they should be regarded as potentially malignant.",

As a result, tissue injury in exocrine pancreas may resolve by forming a histologic constituent that may be similar or different from the damaged tissue type. After certain types of pancreatic tissue injury, the exocrine acini undergo de-differentiation and may attain a ductular morphology and in some cases even attain an endocrine phenotype.

Hormones like gastrin (from G-cells in the stomach) and cholecystokinin (from I-cells in the duodenum) stimulate the exocrine pancreas to secrete inactive proenzymes (zymogens like trypsinogen, chymotrypsinogen, elastase and carboxypeptidase) as well as active enzymes such as lipase, amylase and nuclease. In addition, the duodenal hormone secretin stimulates the centroacinar cells (in addition to the Brunner's glands) to secrete bicarbonate ions that aid in neutralizing acidic chyme from the stomach and stabilizing the enzymes. The intestinal enteropeptidases activate the trypsinogen to trypsin that in turn cleaves the rest of trypsinogen and chymotrypsinogen to their active forms resulting in protein digestion.

Oil Red O and Sudan Black stains on frozen sections help to identify the neutral lipids within the micro/macro vesicles. It is useful to differentiate from cytoplasmic vacuoles due to water accumulation (hydropic change) resulting from cell injury due to hypoxia. Marked vacuolation of the exocrine pancreatic acini has been documented in female Sprague-Dawley rats exposed to dioxins and dioxin-like compounds (Yoshizawa et al. 2005) .",

Comments: Autophagy is a homeostatic mechanism that plays a major role in the catabolism by lysosomal digestion of organelles and/or aged cytoplasmic contents. Autophagy occurs at basal levels in all tissues to maintain cellular homeostasis. However, it is rapidly increased during energy depletion, hypoxia, endoplasmic reticulum stress, high temperature, hormonal stimulation, or cellular remodeling to combat oxidative stress. Alterations in autophagy may lead to disruption of cellular homeostasis and can result in pancreatitis and cell death (Helin et al. 1980; Gukovskaya and Gukovsky 2012) .

In routine H&E sections where the morphology clearly represents apoptosis or single cell necrosis, or whereby special procedures (e.g. TEM or IHC for caspases) prove one or the other, individual diagnoses may be used. However, because of the overlapping morphologies, necrosis and apoptosis are not always readily distinguishable via routine examination, and the two processes may occur sequentially and/or simultaneously depending on intensity and duration of the noxious agent (Zeiss 2003) . This often makes it difficult and impractical to differentiate between both during routine light microscopic examination.

In addition, exocrine pancreatic apoptosis is also observed in some genetically modified mice such as Serpini2-deficient mouse model for pancreatic insufficiency (Loftus et al. 2005) . Non-treatment associated sporadic apoptosis may be noted in pancreas from rodents and this is part of the normal tissue homeostasis and is considered as a background change. Acinar cell apoptosis may be increased in fasted or chronically anorectic animals. The degree of apoptosis is in these cases lower than that of acute pancreatic injury.",

Acinar atrophy may range from focal atrophic exocrine acini with no inflammation or fibrosis to diffuse atrophy of exocrine acini with replacement by adipose tissue and residual ducts, vasculature and islets of Langerhans. Acinar atrophy frequently represents the sequel of chronic inflammation and, as such, is often accompanied by infiltrates of mononuclear cells and fibrosis. It is recommended to record in standard toxicity studies for such lesions either atrophy or chronic inflammation, but not both. Inflammation, chronic, should be recorded only, if the inflammatory changes are the predominant component. In rats, the acinar atrophy increases with age and the incidence varies with sex (males > females) and strain (BN/Bi/WAG/Rij(F1) > Crl:CD(SD) BR = BN/Bi > Slc:Wistar > Hap:(SD) > F344 > Osborne-Mendel). In B6C3F1 mice, the incidence of spontaneous exocrine pancreatic atrophy is 1-2% in 2-year studies (Boorman and Sills 1999) . In rats, chronic protein or essential amino acid deficiency, copper deficiency, zinc deficiency, ethionine, hypophysectomy or high doses of glucagon induce loss of zymogen granules and pancreatic atrophy (Svoboda et al. 1966; Kitagawa and Ono 1986; Rao et al. 1987; Koo and Turk 1977) . Malonaldehyde caused atrophy of exocrine pancreas in both male and female mice (NTP, 1988) . Acinar atrophy has also been induced by pancreatic duct ligation Eustis et al. 1990) .",

Feeding rats with raw but not heat-treated soy flour (lack trypsin inhibitors) caused acinar hypertrophy initially. However, with continued feeding, the hypertrophic change progressed to hyperplasia with marked increase in DNA content. This hypertrophic change is attributed to the presence of trypsin inhibitors within the raw soy flour and its ability to stimulate the secretion of cholecystokinin by feed back mechanism (Crass and Morgan 1982; Folsch et al. 1978) . Similarly, administration of gastrin (but not secretin analogues) like pentagastrin, pancreozymin, and peptavlon also caused pancreatic acinar cell hypertrophy (Rothman, and Wells 1967) . Administration of isoprenaline (isoproterenol) also cased an increase in pancreatic weight due to acinar cell hypertrophy and increase in zymogen granules (Sturgess and Reid 1973) . However, pancreas weight and pancreas to body weight ratios are not commonly recorded or calculated in toxicity studies.",

There is an increase in the incidence of basophilic foci in rats treated with 4-hydroxyaminoquinoline-1-oxide (4HAQO), 7,12-dimethyl-benzanthracene (DMBA), N5-(N-methyl-N-nitrosocarbamoyl)-L-ornithine (MNCO), raw soy bean flour, plant trypsin inhibitors, and azaserine. The proliferative ability of exocrine acinar cytological alterations as measured by tritiated thymidine autoradiography and mitotic index indicated that basophilic foci have similar proliferative ability as the surrounding normal exocrine acini (Rao et al. 1989 ). Thus, unlike focal hyperplasia, the basophilic foci should not be considered as preneoplastic . The cytologic appearance of acinar cells within the basophilic foci may indicate an altered capacity for, or a defect in, the synthesis of secretory proteins. Basophilic foci stained positively with gammaglutamyltranspetidase (GGT) while eosinophilic foci stained negatively. A microscopic morphological entity described as spontaneous pancreatic acinar hypertrophic foci in rats by Chiu (Chiu 1983 ) may indeed be basophilic foci because they share several features such as increased incidence with age, and they are non-hyperplastic and non-neoplastic.",

The separation of acinar hyperplasia and adenoma can be difficult and in the end may be arbitrary as these lesions seem to represent a continuum. Hyperplasia of ducts in circumscribed fibrous areas is often found in aged rats. Duct-like structures do not indicate an origin from pancreatic ducts as is the case in humans. Although hyperplasia of ducts may be seen in aged rats, it is still questionable if true ductular neoplasia occurs in rats such as humans (cystadenoma, cystadenocarcinoma) (Greaves and Faccini 1992) . In mice, no spontaneous ductal cell hyperplasia or neoplasia has been described. Animal models with carcinogens revealed that rats develop acinar cell carcinomas whereas hamsters develop ductal carcinomas with the same carcinogen. This suggests that the species is a major determinant of the phenotype in carcinomas of the pancreas (Longnecker 1986; Longnecker 1994) .

Some foci of hyperplasia may be just at the edge of an adenoma and thus categorized as such due to plane of section. The grade of alteration of acinar structure and compression of adjacent tissue are the most important differential diagnostic criteria. A sub-category of focal acinar hyperplasia with cell en-largement due to an increase of zymogen granules has been termed \"focus, eosinophilic\". Eosinophilic foci are thought to be part of a continuum of lesions that subsequently progress into adenomas and adenocarcinoma (Rao et al. 1989; Scarpelli et al. 1984) . In contrast to basophilic foci, these foci are positive for ATPase and glutathione-S-transferase \u00b5 histochemical stains. The incidence of eosinophilic foci is 2.6% in male F344 rats (Eustis and Boorman 1985) . Eosinophilic foci occur also in mice, but at a much lower incidence than in rats (Roebuck et al. 1980 ). Due to the difficulties to differentiate eosinophilic foci from focal hyperplasia in H&E stained sections, it is recommended to diagnose eosinophilic foci not separately but to collect them under focal hyperplasia in this nomenclature system.",

Hypersensitivity reactions may play a role in test article induced inflammatory reactions, for example trinitobenezensulfonic acid acts as hapten and induces a severe granulomatous reaction in the distal colon(Haschek et al. 2010). Because of the presence of numerous commensal bacteria in the intestine, there is the potential for secondary invasion of sites of mucosal injury and an exacerbation of any tissue injury and induction of an inflammatory response. Inflammatory lesions can be induced by pathogenic bacteria e.g. salmonella, Citrobacter freundii, Helicobacter spp or viruses (norovirus, mouse hepatitis virus) if there has been a barrier breakdown or in immunodeficient animals(Maggio-Price et al. 2005;Percy and Barthold 2007).

Rats are much more resistant to develop amyloidosis than mice. The characteristic morphologic appearance and location of amyloid in H&E sections that is usually adequate to make this diagnosis. Confirmation of the deposits as amyloid can be accomplished with light microscopy using special stains such as Congo red. Amyloid appears apple green under po-larized light with this stain.The term \"hyaline\" should be used in case of uncertainties about the nature of extracellular deposits hyaline material in H&E sections and the unavailability of a Congo red stain. Hyaline is also the appropriate term for homogenously eosinophilic extracellular deposits that react negative with Congo red.Pathogenesis: Diverse, dependent on the nature of pigment.Differential diagnoses\u2022 Mineralization: Dark basophilic appearance in H&E stained sections; special stains like Alizarin red S and von Kossa can help identify calcium salts. \u2022 Artifacts: Hematoxylin stain deposits (distribution unrelated to tissue structures), acid hematin (use of unbuffered formalin; dark brown to black, tropism for erythrocytes). Comment: In the rat, hemosiderin may be seen in neighboring islets of Langerhans where hemorrhage may have occurred previously (Imaoka et al. 2007). The type of pigment can be identified by special stains, such as Schmorl's (mature lipofuscin, melanin, bile), Fontana-Masson's (melanin), Perl's (Ferric Iron-hemosiderin) and Hall's (bilirubin) stains. Formalin-heme pigment (acid-hematin) is observed in tissues fixed in unbuffered formalin. Polarization can help differentiate some pigments like lipofuscin (strong orange autofluorescence on unstained FFPE sections), porphyrin (bright red with a centrally located dark Maltese cross) and acid-hematin (birefringence on H&E sections). Synonyms: Infiltrate inflammatory; infiltrate inflammatory cell; infiltration (plus modifier); infiltration, inflammatory; infiltration, inflammatory cell Modifier: Type of inflammatory cell that represents the predominant cell type in the infiltrate Pathogenesis: Infiltration with neutrophils (Infiltrate, neutrophil), eosinophils (Infiltrate, eosinophil), mononuclear cells (Infiltrate, mononuclear cell) or a combination of more than one type (Infiltrate, mixed) without other histological features of inflammation, e.g. hemorrhage, edema, fibroplasia. features \u2022 Focal, multifocal or diffuse. \u2022 Presence of mononuclear or polymorphonuclear leukocytes but no other histological criteria of inflammation like edema, congestion or necrosis. \u2022 Usually no acinar cell degranulation.",
