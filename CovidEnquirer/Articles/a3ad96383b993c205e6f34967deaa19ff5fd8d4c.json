Blood samples were centrifuged for 15 min at 1500 g and serum was stored at -20&deg;C until analysis. Procalcitonin was measured with a monoclonal immunoradiometric assay (m-IRMA).8 This assay uses two monoclonal antibodies, one directed against residues 96-106 of procalcitonin, as the capture antibody, and one recognising residues 70-76, as the tracer antibody ( fig 1) . This assay has a detection limit of 100 pg/mL. Serum calcitonin was measured with a commercial m-IRMA (CIS Bio-International, Gif sur Yvette, France) which is specific for mature calcitonin and has a sensitivity limit of 10 pg/mL. Circulating immunoreactive forms of calcitonin were analysed by reverse-phase high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC). After partial purification on a Sep-Pak cartridge, serum was injected into a C 18-Nucleosil (Macherey-Nagel, Diiren, Germany) column equilibrated with 0-1% (by volume) trifluoroacetic acid. The column was eluted at room temperature and at a flow rate of 1 mL per min with a 60 min gradient of 20-70% acetonitrile in 0-1% trifluoracetic acid.",

            "text": "Serum calcitonin-like immunoreactivity has been reported in various extrathyroid diseases.1-9 Our study shows that serum concentrations of a substance immunologically identical to procalcitonin increase at the onset of infections. In addition, serum concentrations of this substance seemed to be correlated with the severity of the infection. In all but 2 children with procalcitonin concentrations above 5 ng/mL, the diagnosis of severe bacterial sepsis was confirmed microbiologically. The study of bums patients suggests that bum injuries may lead to moderate systemic release of procalcitonin. However, among these patients, very high peak concentrations of procalcitonin were associated with septic complications, although no direct correlation was found between the post-bum course of the procalcitonin concentrations and the size of the bum or pulmonary injury. The correlation of procalcitonin with the severity of infection was confirmed by findings of serum concentrations up to 200 ng/mL (2000 times the normal value) in patients with septic shock (data not shown). Antibiotic treatment lowered procalcitonin rapidly. By contrast, high circulating procalcitonin concentrations persisted in 1 burns patient who had overwhelming microbial invasion and a long septic episode. Do the procalcitonin molecules originate from the thyroid gland or from other tissues in these patients? Thyroid C-cells do not seem to be the production site of procalcitonin; indeed, 1 burns patient who had undergone thyroidectomy 2 years earlier had high procalcitonin values but no secretion of mature calcitonin. The finding that procalcitonin was detectable in the absence of mature calcitonin shows that the procalcitonin-producing cells are unable to process this precursor form to the mature hormone. MTC are capable of producing and secreting all the biosynthetic pathway products.12-14 Pulmonary neuroendocrine cells in the bronchial epithelium have been reported to be a major source of calcitonin immunoreactivity.'S However, most of our patients with sepsis did not have pulmonary injury. Others have reported the isolated presence of calcitonin precursors in patients with benign liver diseases (such as hepatitis) or with hepatocellular carcinoma, and also the presence of calcitonin-related RNA in this tumour.8 Perhaps the liver is the site of procalcitonin production in patients with sepsis. Since serum calcitonin-like immunoreactivity has been described in a wide variety of extrathyroid diseases, it is likely that inflammatory processes other than infection lead to the elaboration of calcitonin-like immunoreactivity by various types of cells. Such immunoreactivity and a clinical picture resembling sepsis have been reported in some patients with acute pancreatitis.s The place, if any, of procalcitonin induction in the cytokine cascade that occurs in sepsis and other inflammatory processes remains to be investigated. Rapid and substantial release of procalcitonin, at the same time as tumour necrosis factor alpha and before interleukin-6, has been observed in patients with renal cancer after intravenous administration of interleukin-2 (unpublished). This observation could help elucidate the mechanism of rapid procalcitonin production in the septic process. Our results, based on several specific immunoassays, strongly suggest that the molecule detected in the serum of patients with sepsis is procalcitonin. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that some of the aminoacids not involved in the recognised epitopes may differ. A second calcitonin messenger, encoding a procalcitonin bearing eight different aminoacid residues on the carboxy-terminal region, has been identified in the thyroid. 16 Concentrations of calcitonin gene-related peptide, the product of the calcitonin gene in nerve cells, are also increased in patients with sepsis.1?",

We assessed the predictive value of fibrinolytic tests for hospital outcome in a prospective study of 122 patients with acute upper-gastrointestinal-tract bleeding who underwent endoscopy.Serum fibrin degradation products (FDP) were above the normal range in 32% (95% Cl 21-44%) of patients who survived and did not require transfusion or surgery, in 53% (37-69%) of patients who survived without surgery but required transfusion, and in 100% (82-100%) of patients who required surgery or died. Multivariate analysis showed that after adjustment for the effects of established risk factors (age, pulse rate, blood pressure, haemoglobin, site of bleeding, and stigmata of active bleeding at endoscopy), serum FDP was a powerful independent predictor of outcome (p=0&middot;003). Doubling of serum FDP was associated with a 59% increase in the risk of a poor outcome (95% Cl 14-120%).These findings are consistent with roles for endogenous fibrinolysis in gastrointestinal-tract bleeding, for fibrinolytic tests in prediction of adverse outcome, and for fibrinolytic inhibitors in treatment. Lancet 1993; 341: 518-21 Introduction About 3000 of the 30 000 people admitted to hospital in the UK each year for acute upper-gastrointestinal-tract bleeding will die.1 Prognostic indicators for outcome include: age, pulse rate, blood pressure, and haemoglobin at admission, and findings at endoscopy, such as presence, site, and nature of a bleeding lesion, and stigmata of recent bleeding.2-4 One factor that may promote continued bleeding and hence an adverse clinical outcome is the fibrinolytic activity of the upper gastrointestinal tract, because fibrinolysis may lead to digestion of haemostatic plugs.5 Consistent with this possibility, Poller and colleaguess demonstrated increased serum fibrin degradation products (FDP) in a small series of patients with acute upper-gastrointestinal-tract bleeding; however, the prognostic value of serum FDP concentrations has not been reported in a prospective study. We therefore investigated the prognostic value of both serum FDP concentrations (a measure of in-vivo fibrinolysis) and the fibrin plate lysis area (FPLA) of the plasma euglobulin fraction an in-vitro global test of the fibrinolytic potential of blood.",

Because of the known diurnal variation in FPLA patients were assessed and blood sampled between 0900 h and 1000 h at the time of assessment for endoscopy. Patients who had emergency endoscopy before this time or who were assessed on Saturday or Sunday mornings were not included in the study. Patients were also excluded if they had haemostatic disorders or were receiving anticoagulant, antifibrinolytic, or recent thrombolytic therapy. Clinical prognostic factors recorded included age, pulse rate, blood pressure, and haemoglobin on admission. Endoscopic findings were recorded. Patients were followed up until either discharge or death in hospital, and outcome was recorded in increasing order of adversity-ie, no blood or red cell transfusion, acute surgery, or death (group 1); blood or red cell transfusion only (group 2); or surgery and/or death (group 3).A venous blood sample was taken from the arm contralateral to that used for intravenous access or infusions, anticoagulated with trisodium citrate, and kept on melting ice. Platelet-poor plasma was obtained by centrifugation at 4&deg;C within 60 min of sampling and aliquots stored at -70&deg;C before assay.
