Methods: A national sample of 427 Taiwanese male adults aged at least 45 years (mean (M) = 57) were recruited to complete a telephone-based survey questionnaire between April 30 and May 8, 2008. Results: The questionnaire results showed that respondents considered themselves less likely than others to get prostate cancer. The relationship between optimistic bias and intention to undergo prostate cancer screening was non-significant, while information seeking positively and significantly predicted such an intention. Conclusions: The findings of this study imply that health educators should include risk-awareness strategies and information seeking interventions in the design of cancer prevention programs.",

Many studies (e.g. [5] [6] [7] ) have argued that perceived susceptibility is a variable that determines individual healthrelated preventive behaviors. However, not all patients fully understand the risks of prostate cancer or actively seek information on prevention, early detection, or treatment. Prior studies have shown that people tend to underestimate their personal risk of disease [8, 9] . This tendency has been described as optimistic bias [10, 11] , and the concept has been one of the most robust findings in perceptions and cognitions research [12] .",

Optimistic bias is also a useful framework for enhancing understanding of the perceived risk of prostate cancer in middle-aged Taiwanese men and other populations, specifically with regard to the intention to undergo screening. If information seeking behavior is a key moderator between perceived threat of disease and the likelihood of taking action [21] , then information seeking actions become critical to coping ability and informed decision making. Other empirical results indicate that information seeking is positively and significantly associated with cancer screening [22, 23] or testing for cancer risk [24, 25] .

Their findings showed that information seeking by respondents significantly predicted their use of PSA screenings. A study of cancer information by Shim et al.

            "text": "In contrast with earlier studies, this study found that optimistic bias is not significantly related to precautionary actions taken. However, their relationship is negative (b= -0.12, p = 0.11), which could mean that optimistic bias reduces the intention to undergo prostate cancer screening. Interestingly, and central to future information seeking studies as well as to interventions in this area, information seeking apparently predicts intention to undergo screening, which is consistent with other classic studies in the information seeking literature. These analytical results are further evidence (particularly given the focus on a particular culture and population) supporting the emerging understanding of information seeking behaviors as a key determinant of health decisions by patients, including under- [43] ). Taken together, these findings can inform both risk communication interventions and information seeking ones. For the former, patient educators and public health professionals must understand the real potential of optimistic bias concerning prostate cancer among men in Taiwan. Risk communication is an increasingly important field of research informing new methods for communicating actual individual risk as compared to misconceptions that the patient might hold. If, as suggested earlier, other variables affecting optimistic bias are identified, then such tools for communicating risk can be better tailored to mediate optimistic bias. However, moderating overly optimistic perceptions of risk must be balanced with the risk of unintentionally worrying patients and causing other negative psychosocial responses.",

Also, the telephone places limits on the answering of closed questions and forces respondents to remember all available responses to them. Perhaps computer-assisted telephone interviewing techniques, not requiring a human interview, can be used in the future in order to overcome the disadvantages of telephone-administered interviews [44] .",

In particular, information seeking enhanced their intention to undergo prostate cancer screening. Applying the empirical findings of this study would be of importance to prostate cancer prevention programs. Although a significant relationship was observed between intention and actual behavior (r = 0.53) [45] , it is still unclear whether reports by respondents are consistent with their actual behavior regarding prostate cancer screening. Future studies should explore how optimistic bias and information seeking affect actual prostate cancer screening.",
