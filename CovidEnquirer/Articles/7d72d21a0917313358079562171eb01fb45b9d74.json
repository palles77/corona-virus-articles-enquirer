The results confirm that the PC virucidal efficiency can be enhanced in the presence of low halide concentrations (e.g., X = Br \u00c0 or Cl \u00c0 ) and further enhanced by applying potential bias onto the photoanode in a PEC system. The PEC treatment in the presence of 1.0 mM Br (PEC-Br) shows the highest virucidal efficiency, enabling complete inactivation of a $1000 TCID50 replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus (RDRADS) population within 31.7 s. The superior virucidal performances of PEC-X treatments can be attributed to the increased production of active oxygen species and additional viricides resulting from the PEC halide oxidation, as well as prolonged lifetime of photoholes (h + ) for direct inactivation. The findings of this work confirm that new forms of active species generated in situ via a PC or PEC process are effective for viruses.",

Although the transmission modes of viruses are diverse, wastewater is recognized as an important source of contaminated microbial aerosols and liquid. Given the importance of this factor in virus transmission [2] , a number of research projects have focused on developing highly effective inactivation/ separation water treatment techniques [3, 4] . However, virus are submicroscopic particles. As such, the conventional filtration methods are generally less effective; furthermore, biofouling also leads to extra operational costs [5] . When considering UV and chlorination inactivation techniques, a number of pathogens, particularly some virus species, are naturally resistant to such traditional treatments [6, 7] . In addition, the formations of toxic and potential carcinogenic by-products are also drawbacks of chlorine treatment [8] [9] [10] . Ozone disinfection has been considered as an effective alternative [11] ; however, disadvantages, such as its toxic and corrosive characteristics, also hinder its practical application [12] .",

Nevertheless, PC inactivation of adenovirus has not been previously attempted, despite being indicated in the ''Drinking Water Contaminant Candidate List'' [17] because of their prevalent potential health risks and important role for water epidemiology [18] [19] [20] . Moreover, adenoviruses are highly resistant to common treatments when compared to other viral pathogens of concern in wastewater and drinking water [21, 22] , due to their DNA's double-stranded nature [23] .",

In this study, we investigate the application of PC and PEC-based bactericidal techniques in the presence of halides to for inactivation of replication-deficient recombinant adenovirus (RDRADS). The specific study scope was to systematically evaluate and quantitatively compare the virucidal performance of PC and PEC treatment of RDRADS in the presence and absence of halides such as Cl \u00c0 and Br \u00c0 , using RDRADS encoding green fluorescent protein (GFP). The infectivity of the RDRADS can be accurately and conveniently determined using this method, because the virus encodes a GFP gene that can be expressed in host cells [28] .",

The applied potential bias to timely remove the photogenerated electrons and physically separate the photoanode from the cathode are generally regarded as the main factors leading to the enhanced photocatalytic efficiency [31, 32] . It has also been recognized that the applied potential bias prolongs the lifetime of photoholes, enabling direct photohole reactions [30] . Despite numerous studies on PEC degradation of organics have been previously reported [24, 30, 32] , based on the literature, it appears that the PEC inactivation of viruses has been rarely attempted [25] . Therefore, PEC inactivation of RDRADS was also investigated in the absence and presence of halides. Fig. 3 shows the representative micrograph of PK15 cells infected with GFP expressed virus under different photoelectrocatalytic inactivation treatment times at a nanoparticulate TiO 2 photoanode in a continuous flow-though cell in the absence of halide ions. Fig. 4 shows the PEC inactivation performance for RDRADS in the presence and absence of halides. Without adding halides, a 43.50 \u00b1 2.2% inactivation percentage can be achieved at 9.8 s, indicating a drastically enhanced performance within shorter treatment period (e.g., <10 s) when compared to PC treatment in the absence of halide. However, the inactivation dramatically slowed down and then leveled off at ca. 45% when the treatment time was further increased beyond 15 s. Fig. 4 also shows PEC inactivation performance for RDRADS in the presence of 1.0 mM Cl \u00c0 (PEC-Cl) . It was found that a 49.83 \u00b1 2.5% inactivation can be achieved within 6.0 s of PEC-Cl treatment. The inactivation percentage increased almost linearly from 49.83 \u00b1 2.5% to 88.10 \u00b1 4.4% within the treatment period between 6.0 and 31.7 s. Fig. 4 also shows the inactivation performance of PEC in the presence of 1.0 mM Br \u00c0 (PEC-Br). The inactivation percentages increased almost linearly with the treatment time up to 14.3 s, achieving a 99.77 \u00b1 5.0% inactivation. A 100% inactivation was achieved at 31.7 s. Such an inactivation performance is the highest among all methods investigated in this work, demonstrating the superiority of PEC-Br treatment. The results also show that the inactivation percentages of PEC-Br treatment within a short treatment period (i.e., 0 $ 6.0 s) was lower than that of PEC-Cl treatment, but surpassed the PEC-Cl treatment when the treatment time was greater than 9.8 s.",

The inactivation ratios obtained in the presence of Br \u00c0 (PEC-Br) and Cl \u00c0 (PEC-Cl) were found to be below 1 (0.92) during the initial 6.0 s, suggesting a better initial inactivation ability of the PEC-Cl treatment. The PEC-Br's performance surpassed the PEC-Cl treatment with extended treatment time as demonstrated by the ratios of 1.58 and 1.14 obtained after 14.3 and 31.7 s treatments, respectively. 5 summarizes the relative inactivation performances of different treatments investigated in this study. Considering that all experiments were performed using the same photoelectrochemical cell, under the same light intensity and using the same initial virus concentration, the comparison data shown in Fig. 5 are of quantitative and truly reflect the virus inactivation abilities of different treatments. The ratios of PEC to PC treatments in the presence and absence of halides were greater than 1 for all cases investigated, confirming that PEC treatments are more effective than that of PC treatments under comparable conditions. It can be seen that comparing to PC, PC-Cl, and PC-Br treatments, the corresponding PEC treatments are 1.23-1.84, 1.11-1.27 and 1.73-3.04 times more effective, respectively.",

            "text": "The further enhanced inactivation performance for PEC-X treatments can be attributed to the increased productions of AOSs and X-based viricides, and prolonged lifetime of photoholes (h + ) for direct inactivation [30] . Fig. 6 shows the photocurrent responses obtained from 0.1 M NaNO 3 solution and 0.1 M NaNO 3 solution containing Br \u00c0 or Cl \u00c0 at a given concentration. In the absence of X \u00c0 , the photocurrent is originated from the photocatalytic oxidation of water, which is directly proportional to the production rate of AOSs [24, 32] . An increase in halide ions concentration leads to an increase in the photocurrent. The net photocurrent increase results from the photocatalytic oxidation of halides, which should be directly proportional to the production rate of X-based viricides (e.g., X \u00c5 /X 2 \u00c5\u00c0 , X 2 , HOX/XO \u00c0 ) [26] . The photocatalytic inactivation process at TiO 2 is an essential oxidation process. The roles of AOSs and h + have been widely reported [33, 34] . However, which of the X-based viricides (e.g., X \u00c5 /X 2 \u00c5\u00c0 , X 2 , HOX/XO \u00c0 ) generated from photocatalytic oxidation of X \u00c0 need to be further discussed. Considering the relatively low standard potentials of Cl 2 /Cl \u00c0 and Br 2 /Br \u00c0 (+1.36 and +1.087 V, respectively), it is unlikely that these halogen species are the main contributors to the enhancement inactivation efficiency. Moreover, the standard potentials of HOCl/Cl \u00c0 and HOBr/Br \u00c0 are +1.63 and +1.33 V, respectively. Although the oxidation power of these species are not high, they should be sufficient to cause damage to the capsid of nonenveloped viruses (such as adenovirus), whose capsid is composed of protein polypeptides. Also, HOX prefers to react with amino acids with an amino group side chains [38] , and is particular effective to inactivate proteins containing sulfhydryl groups [38] . Therefore, HOX could play an important role in the damage of the protein capsid of RDRADS.",

This is because the reaction equilibrium constant for the formation of Br 2 \u00c5\u00c0 (K = 3.9 \u00c2 10 5 M \u00c01 ) is higher than that of Cl 2 \u00c5\u00c0 (K = 1.4 \u00c2 10 5 M \u00c01 ) in the PEC-Cl system [42] . In comparison to our previous work [26] , the RDRADS is more difficult to be photocatalytically inactivated than bacteria. A possible reason could be that RDRADS is a double-stranded DNA virus, so the damaged DNA could be rapidly repaired by a host cell enzymes [43] . Also, unlike the complex cell wall and inner membrane structures of bacteria, viruses lack enzymes and other sensitive systems, enabling the virus to prolong its survival outside the body environment [44] .

The PEC-Br treatment shows the best virucidal performance, capable of completely inactivating a $1000 TCID50 RDRADS population within 31.7 s. The superior virucidal performances of PEC-X treatments can be attributed to the increased production of AOSs and Xbased viricides, and prolonged lifetime of h + for direct inactivation. The findings of this work confirm that new forms of active species generated in situ via a PC or PEC process are effective for not only bacteria, but also viruses. In theory, the proposed method can be used to kill other types of viruses and to decompose organic pollutants.",

Considering that all experiments were performed using the same photoelectrochemical cell, under the same light intensity and using the same initial virus concentration, the comparison data shown in Fig. 5 are of quantitative and truly reflect the virus inactivation abilities of different treatments. The ratios of PEC to PC treatments in the presence and absence of halides were greater than 1 for all cases investigated, confirming that PEC treatments are more effective than that of PC treatments under comparable conditions. It can be seen that comparing to PC, PC-Cl, and PC-Br treatments, the corresponding PEC treatments are 1.23-1.84, 1.11-1.27 and 1.73-3.04 times more effective, respectively. These experimental results confirm that the photocatalytic inactivation efficiency can be enhanced in presence of low concentration halides (X \u00c0 ) and further enhanced by applying potential bias onto the anode in PEC system. It is commonly agreed that for a TiO 2 photocatalysis-based method, the photocatalytically generated active oxygen species (AOSs) are responsible for inactivation [33,34]. The enhanced inactivation performance for PC-X treatments is due to the production of additional viricides, resulting from the photocatalytic oxidation of X \u00c0 (see Eq. (1)) [35,36].",
