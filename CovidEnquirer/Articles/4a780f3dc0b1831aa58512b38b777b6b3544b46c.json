Background: Acute otitis media (AOM) is the most common complication of a viral upper respiratory infection (URI) in children. The virus-induced host inflammatory response in the nasopharynx plays a key role in the pathogenesis of AOM. Suppression of this inflammatory process might prevent the development of AOM as a complication. Objective: We sought to assess the effect of intranasally administered fluticasone propionate on prevention of AOM during a viral respiratory infection. Methods: A total of 210 children (mean age, 2.1 years; range, 0.7-3.9 years) with normal middle ear status and URI of 48 hours' duration or less were randomly allocated to receive either fluticasone (100 \u00b5g twice daily) or placebo for 7 days. The specific viral cause of the infection was determined from nasopharyngeal aspirates obtained at the first visit. The children were re-examined at the end of the 7-day medication period. Results: In the fluticasone group AOM developed in 40 (38.1%) of 105 children compared with 29 (28.2%) of 103 children receiving placebo (P = .13). The viral cause of the respiratory infection was determined in 167 (86.1%) of 194 children from whom a nasopharyngeal aspirate was obtained. In children with rhinovirus infection, AOM developed significantly more often in the fluticasone group (45.7%) than in the placebo group (14.7%, P = .005). Conclusion: Intranasally administered fluticasone does not prevent the development of AOM during URI but may increase the incidence of AOM during rhinovirus infection.

In an experimental study of rhinovirus infection in adults, glucocorticoids were shown to reduce inflammation in the nasopharynx during the first days of the infection. 18 We conducted a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled study to assess whether fluticasone propionate (FP) administered intranasally early during the course of URI would prevent the development of AOM in children.

The middle ear status was carefully examined by pneumatic otoscopy and additionally by tympanometry whenever the child was cooperative. A nasopharyngeal aspirate specimen was obtained by using a disposable mucus extractor (UNO, Maersk Medical). The eligible children were randomly allocated to receive either intranasal aqueous FP (50 \u00b5g per nostril twice daily; a total daily dose of 200 \u00b5g) or an identical placebo for 7 days (both drugs supplied by GlaxoWellcome, UK). The first doses were given at the study clinic by the parents, who were carefully taught to administer the medication into the nostrils of the child. The parents were provided with a diary card for daily recording of their child's symptoms (rhinitis, cough, fever >37.5\u00b0C, and earache), all medications given, and possible adverse events. The children were re-examined at the end of the 7-day medication period or additionally, in the meantime, whenever the parents suspected AOM.

Positive controls and several negative controls were included in each PCR analysis. Contamination of the specimens was prevented by strict precautions, including the use of separate rooms during each step of the RT-PCR assay. Nucleic acid sequences for rhinoviruses and enteroviruses were detected by RT-PCR assays with subsequent time-resolved fluorometric microwell hybridization assay 22, 23 or gel electrophoresis with ethidium bromide staining. 24 A cutoff value for a hybridization-positive specimen was 5 times the mean value of water template controls. A hybridization-positive specimen was identified as rhinovirus or enterovirus if there was at least a 10-fold difference between the fluorescence values from rhinovirus-and enterovirus-specific probes. A second RT-PCR analysis was done for aliquots of RNA from specimens that yielded a visible band corresponding with the expected amplicon size on the agarose gel but which gave a negative or dual-positive hybridization result. Using another PCR primer pair, rhinoviruses and enteroviruses could be discriminated by amplicon size. 24 If the picornavirus-positive amplicons from the first PCR could not be resolved into rhinoviruses or enteroviruses by the hybridization assay or by the second RT-PCR analysis, they were regarded as unclassified picornaviruses. In addition, 29 specimens that were negative according to all the other methods described were tested by an in-house RT-PCR assay for human coronavirus strains 229E and OC-43 (M. Waris, unpublished data). The primers and probes were modified from primers and nucleotide sequences either described earlier [25] [26] [27] or available from GeneBank and synthesized by Eurogentec (Seraing, Belgium). PCR products were detected by using agarose gel electrophoresis and ethidium bromide staining. Bands corresponding to 229E and OC-43 amplicon sizes were identified on the gel, and the results were confirmed by Southern hybridization.",

This finding is in good accordance with previous studies of the efficacy of steroids in the treatment or prevention of URI in adults. In an experimental study of rhinovirus infection, Gustafson et al 30 showed that although oral prednisone therapy decreased local kinin concentrations in the nasopharynx, it did not alleviate the clinical symptoms of the volunteers. In another experimental study 18 combination of intranasal beclomethasone and oral prednisone had only a modest and shortlived effect on the clinical symptoms of the patients infected with rhinoviruses. Recently, Puhakka et al 31, 32 studied the efficacy of intranasally administered FP in the treatment of natural common cold in otherwise healthy young adults and reported that this treatment neither decreased the incidence of sinusitis nor diminished the clinical symptoms of the patients. The results of all these studies, including the present one, clearly indicate that steroid treatment alone may not be effective in reducing the severity or duration of the symptoms of URI or in preventing the development of common complications, such as AOM or sinusitis.",

            "text": "Our finding that treatment with FP significantly increased the incidence of AOM during rhinovirus infections was entirely unexpected. This observation may have substantial clinical implications because rhinoviruses are the most common causative agents of URI 33 and steroids are widely used in the treatment of various conditions in both children and adults. No explanations are readily available for the increased risk of AOM caused by FP treatment during rhinovirus infections. Systemic effects of FP are very unlikely because the systemic bioavailability of this drug after intranasal administration is very low (<2%). 34 In adults the use of steroids during rhinovirus infections has been shown to increase the viral titers in the nasopharynx 30 and result in prolonged shedding of rhinoviruses. 32 In this way steroids might inten- sify, rather than suppress, the inflammatory reaction in the nasopharynx, which could lead to more severe dysfunction of the eustachian tube. This theory may not, however, sufficiently explain our present observation because steroids have been reported to increase viral shedding also in infections with causes other than rhinovirus. [35] [36] [37] Furthermore, a recent in vitro study suggested that steroids have no direct effect on rhinovirus replication in cultured respiratory epithelial cells. 38 We found no effect of FP on the incidence of AOM in children with URI caused by enteroviruses or any other viruses. However, we cannot exclude the possibility that intranasal FP might even prevent AOM during some viral infections because the incidence of many viral infections was too low for any meaningful analysis. Taken together, our findings suggest that the effect of FP, and perhaps that of steroids in general, may vary significantly during different viral infections. The use of extensive methods for detection of viruses in nasopharyngeal aspirates enabled us to determine the specific viral cause of URI in more than 80% of the children. Despite the high recovery rate of viruses, the relative distribution of different types of viruses in this study is not generalizable to unselected groups of children because we had to exclude almost one third of all children brought to the study clinic because they already had AOM. Also, it is probable that the parents of the sickest children did not want to participate in any clinical trial. These reasons might at least partly explain the low rates of respiratory syncytial virus and influenza viruses in the study children. In spite of these limitations, our results suggest that enteroviruses have a prominent role in the cause of URI in children. Although enteroviruses have been identified as a cause of URI in children previously, 39 descriptions of enterovirus infections have mostly concentrated on large outbreaks with severely ill patients, 40 and URI is infrequently included in the list of manifestations of enterovirus infections. 41 We conclude that intranasally administered FP does not prevent the development of AOM during URI in children and may even increase the risk of AOM during rhinovirus infections. These findings suggest that the effect of steroids may vary significantly during different respiratory viral infections. Because of the widespread use of steroids and the high prevalence of rhinovirus infections in the community, further studies in this area are needed.",
