Self-administered questionnaires were used to assess nurses' acceptance of vaccination against seasonal flu and H1N1. They were sent to nurses by post through various nurses' unions before initiation of the vaccination program. Only 13.3% of the respondents planned to receive the H1N1 vaccine, compared with 37.5% for the seasonal influenza vaccine. Vaccination against seasonal influenza in the preceding season strongly predicted the likelihood of H1N1 vaccination. The main reason cited for H1N1 vaccination was self-protection, and reasons for rejecting vaccination included possible side effects, ineffectiveness of the vaccine, and the mild nature of the disease. Personal contact with patients with H1N1 or severe acute respiratory syndrome at work did not significantly increase the likelihood of receiving the H1N1 vaccine. More than 40% of the respondents were undecided at the time of the survey. The promotion of vaccination against seasonal influenza may play a role in improving H1N1 vaccination coverage. Efforts are needed to address concerns about vaccination risk and to incorporate H1N1 vaccination in standard infection control practice with policy support.",

            "text": "Vaccination against influenza protects health care workers (HCWs) and patients from contracting influenza by reducing virus transmission in health service settings. Vaccination of HCWs is an important strategy, because infected HCWs can be a source of infection to patients. Reducing HCWs' risk of acquiring infection protects patients indirectly. Because it is easier to target HCWs for vaccination than the general public, vaccinating HCWs is a sound strategy to protect patients. However, vaccination coverage in HCWs has been notoriously unsatisfactory, with rates ranging from about 30% to 70% in different countries. [1] [2] [3] [4] Major barriers to vaccination include misconceptions about the rationale for vaccination, perceived ineffectiveness of the vaccine, perceived unlikelihood of contracting influenza, potential side effects, fear of injection, and lack of time. [5] [6] [7] The recent emergence of pandemic human influenza A (H1N1) in 2009 is stressing the health care system because of the lack of immunity in the public and the associated mortality and morbidity. 8, 9 The possibility of genetic reassortment between different subtypes of influenza giving rise to more resistant genotype is another concern, which may potentially lead to new pandemics. [10] [11] [12] [13] Vaccination is a timehonored strategy for preventing H1N1, which can predictably reduce mortality and morbidity.",

            "text": "Based on our results, we anticipated a low uptake rate for H1N1 vaccination in nurses in Hong Kong. The proportion of nurses planning to receive the H1N1 vaccine was much lower in that that for the seasonal influenza vaccine (13.3% vs 37.5%), despite the similarities of the two diseases in transmissibility and clinical outcomes as reported through clinical and epidemiologic observations. 12 Because influenza vaccination is not a mandatory requirement for HCWs, vaccination coverage naturally hinges on the individual's willingness to get vaccinated, which in turn is dependent on the perceived risks and benefits of vaccination. Our study suggests that self-protection was the main reason for receiving vaccination against both H1N1 and seasonal influenza. Surprisingly, past experience with respiratory infection did not increase the likelihood of receiving H1N1 vaccination. Nurses who had come into contact with patients infected with H1N1 were not more likely to receive H1N1 vaccination (OR, 1.03). More nurses who had been in contact with H1N1 patients at work (44/137; 32.1%) believed that H1N1 is a minor disease compared with those who had not been in contact H1N1 patients at work (43/ 176; 24.4%). Moreover, many nurses considered seasonal influenza and H1N1 to be less serious than H5N1 or SARS. Personal exposure to the infection was not an important factor, although the number of respondents might be too small to allow meaningful interpretation. Nonetheless, our earlier studies had demonstrated a positive impact of this factor on nurses' preparedness against avian flu outbreaks. 14, 15 We explored a whole range of factors that might be associated with nonacceptance of H1N1 vaccination ( Table 2) . Unlike other studies on seasonal influenza vaccination, many of these potential factors did not have sufficiently strong statistical power to predict vaccination behavior against H1N1 in our nurses. Those rejecting H1N1 vaccination had 2 major concerns, perceived ineffectiveness and potential adverse effects of the vaccine, cited by .50% of the respondents, consistent with previous studies. 1, 2, 16, 17 About one-third of those declining vaccination considered either form of influenza to be a mild disease. Misconceptions about seasonal influenza vaccination are common among nurses, even after education programs, as reported by Raftopoulos 18 and Ofstead et al. 19 In particular, the purpose of vaccination to protect an at-risk population, rather than as self-protection, was hardly recognized. The factors associated with a declining H1N1 vaccination rate might well be similar to those for seasonal influenza vaccination, because many nurses considered the 2 diseases to be of similar severity. It can be argued that the perceived benefit of vaccination is easily offset by the possible, yet uncertain side effects of the H1N1 vaccine. We did not explore the cost of the vaccine as a factor in our study, because vaccination is free to all nursing staff in Hong Kong.",

Given that .40% of our survey respondents were undecided about receiving the H1N1 vaccination, the final vaccination coverage will depend on external factors that might affect their major concerns, rather than on promotion of vaccination as an effective tool to prevent infection transmission. Interestingly, acceptance of seasonal influenza vaccination was a very strong predictor for acceptance of H1N1 vaccination. Similar findings from an Internet survey of US adults was reported by Maurer et al. 21 Vaccination against seasonal influenza in the preceding year was associated with an OR of 26 for receiving the H1N1 vaccine in the coming season. This finding is in agreement with previous studies of seasonal influenza vaccination in HCWs. [1] [2] [3] 5 Thus, it has been speculated that efforts to increase seasonal influenza vaccination coverage will lead to increased H1N1 vaccination coverage. In our study, .60% of the nurses had received seasonal influenza vaccination in the previous year; however, the estimated vaccination rate for the coming flu season had dropped to 37.5%, though some 20% of the respondents were undecided at the time of the survey. If all undecided nurses subsequently received vaccination, then the proportions vaccinated against H1N1 and seasonal influenza would be quite similar, reaching $50% of the total cohort.",

First, vaccination policy for HCWs should be developed separately from that for the general public, given the differing concerns and priorities in the 2 populations. Currently, HCWs are a priority category for receiving H1N1 vaccination in Hong Kong, a practice also adopted in the United States and other parts of the world. 22 Such an approach could be counterproductive, however, because so many HCWs do not consider themselves at risk of infection. In our study, nurses demonstrated positive attitudes toward government policies on controlling the epidemic irrespective of their degree of acceptance of H1N1 vaccination. Ironically, professional advice and official guidelines were relatively unimportant factors for those who rejected vaccination, a finding similar to that in a recent local study. 17 This discrepancy has arisen because policy guidelines addressing the specific needs of HCWs have yet to be developed.",

Currently, priority populations for H1N1 vaccination include elderly persons, pregnant women, and persons with chronic disease. The purpose of offering vaccination to these latter groups is to prevent disease and reduce morbidity and mortality. Theoretically, vaccination of HCWs could serve a dual purpose of occupational safety and infection control, the latter to reduce the incidence of nosocomial infection. In our study, those accepting vaccinations perceived H1N1 or seasonal influenza vaccination not as an infection control measure, but simply as a means of self-protection. Rectifying this prevailing attitude should be considered through policy and educational strategies.",

Admittedly, the coverage of seasonal influenza vaccination has remained suboptimal, even though the percentage of nurses accepting the vaccination is much higher than that for H1N1 vaccination. Incorporating the H1N1 vaccine in the seasonal influenza regimen, as advocated for the southern hemisphere in the coming year, could boost the coverage to that for the seasonal influenza vaccine. 23 However, this would still not be good enough if the objective of vaccinating HCWs is to control transmission, for which a near-100% coverage is the goal.",

The total number of registered nurses and enrolled nurses in Hong Kong was 37,447 as of December 2008. 24 For practical reasons, it was impossible to include all nurses due to limited resources and the lack of a uniform survey platform. Second, some 30% of the nurses in our cohort did not have frequent patient contact, a factor that should be noted when extrapolating results to the health care profession at large. We have not been able to categorize the population according to the nature of the workplace. It would be interesting to compare the responses in nurses with different jobs, such as those in outpatient clinics, hospitals, and nonclinical settings. Third, most of the responding nurses were mature and highly experienced, characteristic of members of the nursing associations surveyed. Younger nurses and those with less experience might not have been captured. Moreover, the use of a mailin survey might have caused some bias in the responses. It could be argued that those who took time to return the questionnaire were probably more ready to express their thought and opinions. Finally, nursing culture varies across countries, and so our results might not be applicable to other places.",
