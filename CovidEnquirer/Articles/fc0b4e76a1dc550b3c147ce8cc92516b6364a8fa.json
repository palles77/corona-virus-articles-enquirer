Since coronaviruses in general infect the mucosal surfaces, both respiratory and enteric, they may be used to target the antigen to the enteric and respiratory areas to induce a strong secretory immune response; (iv) the tropism of coronaviruses may be modified by manipulation of the spike (S) protein allowing engineering of the tropism of the vector [7, 8] ; (v) non-pathogenic coronavirus strains infecting most species of interest (human, porcine, bovine, canine, feline, and avian) are available to develop expression systems; and (vi) infectious coronavirus cDNA clones are available to design expression systems.",

Infectious cDNA clones are available for porcine [9, 10] (Fig. 1B.2 and B. 3), human ( Fig. 1B.4 ) [11] , murine [12] and avian (infectious bronchitis virus, IBV) coronavirus [13] , and also for the arteriviruses equine infectious anemia virus (EAV) [14] , porcine respiratory and reproductive syndrome virus (PRRSV) [15] , and simian hemorrhagic fever virus (SHFV) [16] . The availability of these cDNAs and the application of target recombination to coronaviruses [6] have been essential for the development of vectors based on coronaviruses and arteriviruses.

Coronaviruses are associated mainly with respiratory, enteric, hepatic and central nervous system diseases. In humans and fowl, coronaviruses primarily cause upper respiratory tract infections, while porcine and bovine coronaviruses (BCoVs) establish enteric infections that result in severe economical loss. Human coronaviruses (HCoV) are responsible for 10-20% of all common colds, and have been implicated in gastroenteritis, high and low respiratory tract infections and rare cases of encephalitis. HCoV have also been associated with infant necrotizing enterocolitis and are tentative candidates for multiple sclerosis. In March 2003, a new group of HCoVs has emerged as the ethiological agent of the severe acute pneumonia syndrome (SARS) affecting thousands of people, mostly in China, Singapore, and Toronto. In addition, human infections by coronaviruses seem to be ubiquitous, as coronaviruses have been identified wherever they have been looked for, including North and South America, Europe, and Asia and no other human disease has been clearly associated with them with the exception of respiratory and enteric infections.

During the filling in of minigenome deletions a cDNA fragment that was toxic to the bacterial host was identified. This fragment was reintroduced into the cDNA in the last cloning step; (ii) in order to express the long coronavirus genome and to add the 5 0 cap required for TGEV RNA infectivity, a two-step amplification system that couples transcription in the nucleus from the CMV promoter, with a second amplification in the cytoplasm driven by the viral polymerase, was used; and (iii) to increase viral cDNA stability within bacteria, the cDNA was cloned as a bacterial artificial chromosome (BAC), that produces a maximum of two plasmid copies per cell. A fully functional infectious TGEV cDNA clone, leading to a virulent virus infecting both the enteric and respiratory tract of swine was engineered. The stable propagation of a TGEV full-length cDNA in bacteria as a BAC has been considerably improved by the insertion of an intron to disrupt a toxic region identified in the viral genome (Fig. 3 ) [30] . The viral RNA was expressed in the cell nucleus under the control of the CMV promoter and the intron was efficiently removed during translocation of this RNA to the cytoplasm. Intron insertion in two different positions (nt 9466 and 9596) allowed stable plasmid amplification for at least 200 generations. Infectious TGEV was efficiently recovered from cells transfected with the modified cDNAs. The great advantage of this system is that the performance of coronavirus reverse genetics only involves recombinant DNA technologies carried out within the bacteria.",

In addition, expression from a TGEV replicon was also observed when N protein was in trans co-expressed using the Venezuelan equine encephalitis virus vector [36] . Furthermore, expression from HCoV based vectors also was significantly increased by co-expression of N gene.

This approach, developed by Masters' group [6, 37] , was first applied to the engineering of a five-nucleotide insertion into the 3 0 untranslated region (3 0 UTR) of MHV [37] . This approach was facilitated by the availability of an N gene mutant, designated Alb4, that was both temperaturesensitive and thermolabile. Alb4 forms tiny plaques at restrictive temperature that are easily distinguishable from wild-type plaques. In addition, incubation of Alb4 virions at non-permissive temperature results in a 100-fold greater loss of titer than for wild-type virions. These phenotypic traits allowed the selection of recombinant viruses generated by a single crossover event following cotransfection into mouse cells of Alb4 genomic RNA together with a synthetic copy of the smallest subgenomic RNA (RNA7) tagged with a marker in the 3 0 UTR.",

Targeted recombination mediated by two cross-overs allowed the replacement of the S gene of a respiratory strain of TGEV by the S gene of enteric TGEV strain PUR-C11 leading to the isolation of viruses with a modified tropism and virulence [7] . In this case the recombinants were selected in vivo using their new tropism in piglets. A new strategy for the selection of recombinants within the S gene, after promoting targeting recombination, was based on elimination of the parental replicative TGEV by the simultaneous neutralization with two mAbs (I. Sola and L. Enjuanes, unpublished results). Mutations have also been introduced by targeted mutagenesis within the E and M genes.

In contrast, the theoretical cloning capacity for an expression system based on a single coronavirus genome like TGEV according to current available knowledge is between 3 and 3.5 kb taking into account that: (i) the non-essential genes 3a (0.2 kb), 3b (0.73 kb), and most of gene 7 [43] have been deleted leading to a viable virus; (ii) the standard S gene can be replaced by the S gene of a porcine respiratory coronavirus (PRCV) mutant with a deletion of 0.67 kb; and (iii) both DNA and RNA viruses may accept genomes with sizes up to 105% of the wild type genome. This cloning capacity will probably be enlarged by deleting non-essential domains of the replicase gene. These domains are being identified by comparing the arterivirus replicase gene (i.e., for EAV 9.7 \u00c2 10 3 nt) and that of coronavirus (i.e., for TGEV 20.3 \u00c2 10 3 nt) [19] . Differences in size between these two replicase genes could correspond to nonessential domains in the coronavirus replicase that may be dispensable.",

            "text": "Coronavirus RNA synthesis occurs in the cytoplasm via a negative-strand RNA intermediate that contains short stretches of oligo(U) at the 5 0 end. Both genome-size and subgenomic negative-strand RNAs, which correspond in number of species and size to those of the virus-specific mRNAs have been detected [44, 45] . Coronavirus mRNAs have a leader sequence at their 5 0 ends. At the start site of every transcription unit on the viral genomic RNA, there is a TRS that includes a highly conserved core sequence (CS) that is nearly homologous to the 3 0 end of the leader RNA. This sequence constitutes part of the signal for sgmRNA transcription. The common 5 0 leader sequence is only found at the very 5 0 terminus of the genome, which implies that the synthesis of sgmRNAs involves fusion of non-contiguous sequences. The mechanism involved in this process is under debate. Nevertheless, the discontinuous transcription during negative-strand RNA synthesis model is compatible with most of the experimental evidence [45] [46] [47] . Because the leader-mRNA junction occurs during the synthesis of the negative strand within the sequence complementary to the CS (cCS) the nature of the CS is considered crucial for mRNA synthesis. Transcription levels may be influenced by many factors. The three that we [21] consider most relevant are: (i) potential base pairing between the leader 3 0 end and sequences complementary to the TRS located at the 5 0 end of each nidovirus gene (cTRS), that guide the fusion between the nascent negative strand and the leader TRS. A minimum complementarity is needed between the leader-TRS and the cTRSs of each gene. Extension of this complementarity increases mRNA synthesis up to a certain extent, beyond a certain extension addition of 5 0 or 3 0 CS flanking sequences does not help transcription [21, 48, 49] ; (ii) proximity of a gene to the 3 0 . Since the TRSs act as signals to slow down or stop the replicase complex, the smaller mRNAs should be the most abundant. Although this has been shown to be the case in the Mononegavirales [50] and in coronaviruses shorter mRNAs are in general more abundant, the relative abundance of coronavirus mRNAs is not strictly related to their proximity to the 3 0 end [21, 51] ; and (iii) potential interaction of proteins with the TRSs RNA, and protein-protein interactions that could regulate transcription levels. The reassociation of the nascent RNA chain with the leader TRS is probably mediated by approximation of the leader TRS through RNA-protein and protein-protein interactions.",

Hence, in order to engineer vectors with high expression levels, it seems relevant to define the characteristics of the TRS, including the size of the 5 0 and 3 0 TRS sequences flanking the CS. The CS of coronaviruses belonging to groups I (hexamer 5 0 -CUAAAC-3 0 ) and II (heptamer 5 0 -UCUAAAC-3 0 ) share homology, whereas the CS of coronaviruses belonging to group III, like that of IBV, have the most divergent sequence (5 0 -CUUAACAA-3 0 ). Also, arterivirus CSs have a sequence (5 0 -UCAACU-3 0 ) that partially resembles that of IBV. Thus, the CSs of different coronaviruses are quite similar though slightly different in length. This CS is essential for mRNA synthesis, and can be considered to be a defined domain in the TRS because it is particularly conserved within a nidovirus family, while the flanking sequences, both at the 5 0 (5 0 TRSs) and at the 3 0 (3 0 TRSs) have a unique composition for each gene even within the same virus.",

The construction of double mutants in which a mutant leader CS was combined with the corresponding mutant RNA7 body CS, resulting in the specific restoration of mRNA7 synthesis, suggested that the sequence of the CS per se is not crucial, as long as the possibility for CS base pairing is maintained. Nevertheless, it has been shown that other factors, besides leader-body base pairing, also play a role in sgmRNA synthesis and that the primary sequence (or secondary structure) of TRSs may dictate strong base preferences at certain positions [46] . In addition, detailed analysis of the TRS used in the arteriviruses [47] , MHV [52] , BCoV [53] , and TGEV [31] indicate that non-canonical CS sequences may also be used for the switch during the discontinuous synthesis of the negative strand during transcription in the Nidovirales.",

Certainly this is the case in porcine coronavirus with a virulence directly related to its ability to grow in the enteric tract [7] .

Rearrangement of the genes of vesicular stomatitis virus eliminates clinical disease in the natural host and is considered a new strategy for vaccine development [62] . In coronavirus, genes closer to the 3 0 end are in general expressed more abundantly than 3 0 end distal ones and, in principle, gene order change can also lead to virus attenuation (P. Rottier, personal communication).",

The sequences that regulate transcription have been characterized mainly using helper-dependent expression systems. These expression systems have the advantage of their large cloning capacity, in principle higher than 27 kb, produce reasonable amounts of heterologous antigens (2-8 mg/10 6 cells), show a limited stability (synthesis of heterologous gene is maintained for around 10 passages), and elicit strong immune responses. In contrast, coronavirus vectors based on single genomes have at present a limited cloning capacity (3-3.5 kb), expression levels of heterologous genes are 10-fold over those of helper dependent systems (>50 mg/10 6 cells) and are very stable (>30 passages). Furthermore, replication-competent propagation-deficient expression systems based on coronavirus genomes have been developed increasing the safety of these vectors. The possibility of expressing different genes under the control of TRSs with programmable strength, and engineering the tissue and species tropism indicate that coronavirus vectors are very flexible. Thus, coronavirus-based vectors are emerging with a high potential for vaccine development and, possibly, for gene therapy. ",
