The neuronal nuclei infected and the spread of virus within the brain are described. The main difference between the parental and variant viruses was the rate at which the infection spread. MHV-4 spread rapidly, destroying large numbers of neurons and the animals died within 4 days of infection. The variant virus spread to the same areas of the brain but at a slower rate. This difference in the rate of virus spread was also apparent from the brain virus titers. The slower rate of spread of the variant virus appears to allow intervention by the immune response. Consistent with this, the variant virus spread slowly in athymic nu/nu mice, but in the absence of an intact immune response, infection and destruction of neurons eventually reached the same extent as that of the parental virus and the mice died within 6 days of infection. We conclude that the V5A13.1 variant of MHV4 is neuroattenuated by its slower rate of spread in the CNS. 0 1992 Academic Press, Inc.",

It is now clear that the genome of this virus is highly variable, in particular, an area of hypervariability is present in the Sl gene (Parker et al., 1989) . This hypetvariable region undergoes high frequency recombination (Banner et al., 1990) and both deletions and recombinations may result from \"polymerase jumping\" (Lai et al., 1987; Lai, 1990 ). The consequence of this hypervariability is that MHV propagated and studied in one laboratory may be very different from that in another. Furthermore, if the virus is regularly passaged it may vary over time and variant viruses have been readily obtained by passage of virus ' Present address: Department of Pathology, Tennis Court Road, University of Cambridge, UK.",

This was also apparent in the spinal cord where the signal radiated out into the gray matter around the spinal canal (Fig. 1) . No indication of infection from the blood across cerebral capillaries was evident. Spread of infection along neuronal pathways was clearly evident in two systems. Firstly, pyramidal cells in the deep cortical layers close to the site of inoculation were among the first cells to be infected followed by their connections in the basal ganglia and caudate (Fig. 1) . In this regard it is likely that the consistently infected nucleus in the post-ventral hypothalamus is indeed the supramammillary nucleus since this also receives projections from neurons in the deep layers of the occipital cortex. This would explain the early infection of this distant nucleus. Secondly, tracking along neuronal pathways was apparent in the spread from the anterior olfactory area to the olfactory bulb and out along the olfactory tubercle to connecting nuclei of the rhinencephalon.",

An immunohistochemical analysis of the distribution of MHV A59 following ic inoculation demonstrated that this strain of the virus infects neurons in the basal ganglia, particularly in the subthalamic nucleus and the substantia nigra (Fishman et a/., 1985) . Other areas found to be infected by A59 included neurons of the thalamus, pons, subiculum, regions of the cortex, and glial cells in the corpus callosum. The CNS distribution of A59 virus has also been studied by in situ hybridization and electron microscopy following intranasal infection where it was observed that the virus spread from the olfactory into the limbic system (Lavi eta/., 1988). Comparison of these results on A59 with the present study indicates many similarities. As with MHV-A59, MHV-4 infected structures in the olfactory and limbic systems, regions of the cortex, and occasional cells in the corpus callosum; however, there were also differences, since the thalamus and substantia nigra were apparent only for their lack of infection by MHV-4. Spread of MHV along defined neuronal pathways has also been observed in a series of studies on the spread and persistence of MHV JHM following intranasal infection of suckling mice (Perlman eta/., 1988 (Perlman eta/., , 1989 . The consistent finding in the present and previous studies is that virus predominantly infects neurons and spread involves tracking along neuronal interconnections.",

For both viruses the predominantly infected cell type was the neuron, but the variant virus also infected many glial cells. This was most apparent in the deep cortical layers and the underlying white matter. The wt virus infected predominantly neurons in the deep layers of the cortex but spread to involve occasional cells in the adjacent white matter (Figs. 3A and 3C ). In contrast, the variant infected many glial cells in the white matter and few neurons in the overlying cortex (Figs. 5A, 5C, and 5D ).

            "text": "The attenuation of the variant appears not to be related to changes in tropism but to a slower rate of spread ( Fig. 1) and consequently reduced neuronal destruction (compare Figs. 3A and 5A). A similar situation has been observed with strains of rabies virus (Coulon et al,, 1989) . In nu/nu mice which lack normal T-lymphocyte functions, the variant virus spread at a slower rate than the wt virus in immunocompetent mice, but by Day 4 the variant in nu/nu mice reached a CNS distribution similar to that of the wt virus in immunocompetent mice on Day 3 (compare Figs. 1 and 6) . The nu/nu mice eventually succumbed to the variant infection around Day 6. Thus it appears that survival of immunocompetent mice infected with the variant virus depends upon intervention by the immune response and control of the infection before it reaches lethal levels. Similarly, a high dose of virus, or a slow immune response can result in death following a V5A13.1 infection, whereas a particularly rapid and effective immune response may offer one explanation for the occasional mouse which survives ic infection with wt virus. The fine balance between viral spread and prevention of viral spread by the immune response is also seen in mice protected from lethal MHV-4 infection by the passive transfer of antibodies (Buchmeier et a/., 1984) and in suckling mice inoculated with MHV JHM and nursed on immunized dams (Perlman el al., 1987) . Other neuroattenuated strains of MHV may also spread slower in the CNS than the neurovirulent strains. However, this does not appear to be the case with the ts8 mutant of MHV-4 where the basis of the neuroattenuation appears to be a differential celltropism (Knobler et a/., 1981 b) .",

Our sequences of the S gene of plaque purified MHV-4 and its V5A13.1 variant were obtained by direct RNA sequencing of the virus populations (Parker et a/., 1989) . In the present study we have taken great care to ensure that the viruses inoculated into mice were only one passage from those used for sequencing and that this stock of variant virus maintained the deletion genotype. We conclude that the Sl protein of MHV-4 is likely to contain a determinant (within amino acids 434-575) that directly affects the rate of virus spread within the CNS and resultant neurovirulence. Possible explanations for the reduced rate of viral spread include the following: a reduction in the affinity of the viral envelope glycoprotein for CNS cell surface receptors resulting in a lower efficiency of infection and decreased cell to cell spread; an effect on events that occur subsequent to the virion interaction with cell surface receptors such as liberation of viral nucleic acids into the cytoplasm; or the rate at which the envelope glycoproteins are processed in the assembly of mature infectious virions.",
