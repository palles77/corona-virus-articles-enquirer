Constraining demand with price-rises gives up to 100-fold increases in CO 2 values. a b s t r a c t Global airlines consume over 5 million barrels of oil per day, and the resulting carbon dioxide (CO 2 ) emitted by aircraft engines is of concern. This article provides a contemporary review of the literature associated with the measures available to the civil aviation industry for mitigating CO 2 emissions from aircraft. The measures are addressed under two categories e policy and legal-related measures, and technological and operational measures. Results of the review are used to develop several insights into the challenges faced.",

Some mitigation-measures can be left to market-forces as the key-driver for implementation because they directly reduce airlines' fuel consumption, and their impact on reducing fuel-costs will be welcomed by the industry. Other mitigation-measures cannot be left to market-forces. Speed of implementation and stringency of these measures will not be satisfactorily resolved unattended, and the current global regulatory-framework does not provide the necessary strength of stewardship. A global regulator with 'teeth' needs to be established, but investing such a body with the appropriate level of authority requires securing an international agreement which history would suggest is going to be very difficult.",

An appropriate regulatory limit for the standard will be established using the ICAO criteria of technical feasibility, environmental benefit, cost effectiveness, and the impacts of inter-dependencies on other performance indicators covered by other standards (ICAO, 2012d). The CAEP agree that the standard should be applicable to new aircraft-types. Potentially, it could also apply to newly-manufactured examples of existing aircraft-types, although this is yet to be finalised. If the standard only applies to new-types, there will be a need to determine when modifications to an existing-type are extensive enough to warrant classification as a new-type, and therefore become eligible for compliance (Holland et al., 2011) .",

Advances in materials, structures, and aerodynamics are already allowing significant reductions in lift-dependent drag to be achieved. Over the next 10e20 years, friction drag offers the most potential for further improvements (ICAO, 2010c), with computational fluid dynamics modelling suggesting it can be reduced by 20e70% (King et al., 2010) . Beyond that time-frame, more radical re-designs of the conventional airliner airframe-layout are currently being researched, such as the blended-wing-body (BWB) design. Sometimes called a flying-wing design, the BWB approach increases aerodynamic efficiency through minimising any aircraft surfaces that do not contribute to lift-generation, and potentially offers large fuel-efficiency improvements. However, BWB must overcome issues such as passenger acceptance of windowless designs, the difficulties inherent in pressurising non-cylindrical shapes (King et al., 2010) , and current airport-infrastructure needing to be reconfigured to load/unload BWB designs. Additionally, although there is no definitive demarcation between large and small aircraft or long and short range, the BWB is seen as being best-suited to larger aircraft over longer distances (Morris et al., 2009) . Therefore, the BWB approach is less likely to offer potential for smaller aircraft on shorter flights.",

In one of the authors' personal experience of flying aircraft for a large UK airline (Grote), airline policies aimed at reducing fuel-use were always near the top of the agenda, probably second only to the paramount concern of flightsafety. The reason given for the importance placed on fuel-saving policies was always the cost of fuel, rather than any mention of concern for reducing CO 2 emissions e this was just a happy byproduct. Inclusion of aviation in MBMs such as the EU-ETS and the ICAO's planned global MBM, will more directly relate CO 2 emissions to an airline's costs, and explicit concern for reducing CO 2 emissions may become increasingly important.",

An example of national legislation from the UK would be the compulsory use of biofuel for road-transport through the RTFO. If agreement could be secured to invest the ICAO with the appropriate level of authority, then they could impose the less 'popular' measures, and speed-up the implementation process through removal of the need to secure piecemeal agreements for each measure in-turn. However, realistically the ICAO would still need to perform the difficult diplomatic task of operating in such a way that all the interested parties in the civil aviation industry felt their concerns were being addressed in a fair and transparent fashion.

Implementation of MBMs and a global CO 2 standard will provide additional incentives for greater emission reduction-rates to be 'squeezed' from the combination of aircraft technology, efficient operational procedures, and alternative fuels. Another potential emission-saving option would be, for a given level of demand, to increase passenger load-factors by reducing the Available-Seat-Kilometres (ASKs, i.e. the total passenger capacity available) which would reduce CO 2 emissions per RPK. For example, global average load-factors increasing from 68% in 1989 to 79.3% in 2012 has placed some constraint on the growth in aviation's CO 2 emissions (Lee et al., 2009; IATA, 2014) . However, it is by-no-means certain that a combination of these measures will be sufficient to close the gap between traffic growth-rates and emission reduction-rates. If not, then behaviour change to reduce the underlying demand for air-travel becomes necessary if a cut in aviation's absolute CO 2 emissions (or at least remaining constant at 2020-levels) is to be realised.",

Modal-shift towards transportmodes with better carbon-efficiency is a further way of reducing aviation demand. For example, it is generally acknowledged that High-Speed Rail (HSR) emits less CO 2 per passenger-kilometre in comparison to aviation (Campos and de Rus, 2009) . A national government policy of investing in new HSR services, or promoting existing HSR services, could induce modal-shift away from aviation. In 1992, when HSR was introduced to Spain on the Madrid-Sevilla route, the rail share of the total rail-and-air market increased from 21% in 1991 to 82% in 1993 (Fu et al., 2012) . The optimal wholejourney time for HSR is 3e4 h, with its time-advantage over aviation disappearing when the whole-journey time by train exceeds 4 h (Fu et al., 2012) . Additionally, it is often argued that information and communication technology (ICT) can reduce the demand for work-related travel through replacing physical-mobility with virtual-mobility (Lassen et al., 2006; Lu and Peeta, 2009 ).",

A CO 2 emissions reduction of 2.3% per annum is assumed (the 40-year forecast from the King et al. study was considered to have a \"slim\" chance of occurring, so it would seem prudent to select an emissions reduction-rate from the lower-end of this highlyoptimistic scenario).

For the average USA international air-ticket price in 2012 of $1235.51 ($926.66 in year 2000 dollars) (A4A 2013b), a change from a 0.5% per annum reduction to a 1.4% per annum increase, equates to a $23.47 price rise. Multiplying the average distance for the trip (7696 miles \u00bc 12,386 km) (A4A 2013b) by a representative average emission factor for long-haul aviation (0.1176 kg CO 2 /passenger-km for 2012) (DEFRA, 2013) gives 1457 kg CO 2 per passenger; so a 2.3% per annum reduction in CO 2 emissions equates to 34 kg. Therefore, the value of CO 2 implied is $23.47/ 34 kg, or $690/tonne (in year 2012 dollars). This result shows consistency with a 2009 study into aviation in a low-carbon EU which found that carbon-prices well in excess of $400/tonne (V300/tonne) were required to constrain emissions within acceptable limits (Bows et al., 2009) .",

Top: Aviation fuel-use starting in 1940, the beginning of significant aviation activity. Growth in passenger traffic from 1970 is shown in terms of RPKs, alongside annual change in RPK (far right hand axis, with offset zero). The arrows indicate the timings of significant world events which potentially threatened global aviation: oil crises in the 1970s, the Gulf war crisis in the early 1990s, the Asian financial crisis in the late 1990s, the World Trade Center attack in 2001, and the global health crisis resulting from Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS).
