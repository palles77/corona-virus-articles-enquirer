HCV capsid (core) protein (HCVcp) is a highly demanded antigen for various diagnostic, immunization and pathogenesis studies. Plants are considered as an expression system for producing safe and inexpensive biopharmaceutical proteins. Although invention of transgenic (stable) tobacco plants expressing HCVcp with proper antigenic properties was recently reported, no data for \"transient-expression\" that is currently the method of choice for rapid, simple and lower-priced protein expression in plants is available for HCVcp. Objectives: The purpose of this study was to design a highly codon-optimized HCVcp gene for construction of an efficient transient-plant expression system for production of HCVcp with proper antigenic properties in a regional tobacco plant (Iranian Jafarabadi-cultivar) by evaluation of different classes of vectors and suppression of gene-silencing in tobacco.",

The resulted recombinant plasmids were transferred into Agrobacterium tumefaciens and vacuum infiltrated into tobacco leaves. The effect of gene silencing suppressor P19 protein derived from tomato bushy stunt virus on the expression yield of HCVcp by each construct was also evaluated by co-infiltration in separate groups. The expressed HCVcp was evaluated by dot and western blotting and ELISA assays. Results: The codon-optimized gene had an increased adaptation index value (from 0.65 to 0.85) and reduced GC content (from 62.62 to 51.05) in tobacco and removed the possible deleterious effect of \"GGTAAG\" splice site in native HCVcp. Blotting assays via specific antibodies confirmed the expression of the 15 kDa HCVcp. The expression level of HCVcp was enhanced by 4-5 times in P19 co-agroinfiltrated plants with better outcomes for PVX, compared to pBI121 vector (0.022% versus 0.019% of the total soluble protein). The plant-derived HCVcp (pHCVcp) could properly identify the HCVcp antibody in HCV-infected human sera compared to Escherichia coli-derived HCVcp (eHCVcp), indicating its potential for diagnostic/immunization applications. Conclusions: By employment of gene optimization strategies, use of viral-based vectors and suppression of plant-derived gene silencing effect, efficient transient expression of HCVcp in tobacco with proper antigenic properties could be possible.",

            "text": "Hepatitis C virus (HCV), the major cause of blood-borne chronic hepatitis with potential progression to cirrhosis, has infected around 170 million people globally (1) . Due to heterogeneity of HCV proteins, their high mutation rates and complex pathogenesis, no approved vaccine for human application against this viral infection is available to date (2, 3) . Recognition of conserved epitopes in HCV proteins and advancements in the formulation of vaccines in novel modalities, however, have led to the placement of a few HCV vaccines in the pipeline of human clinical trials in recent years (4, 5) . HCV holds a single-stranded positive-sense RNA genome which encodes for three structural (core protein and envelope proteins E1 and E2) and six nonstructural proteins (4) . Among the HCV proteins, core (HCVcp) is the most conserved HCV antigen, and hence, a good candidate to be considered for HCV vaccine formulations (4) (5) (6) . Accordingly, application of even isolated HCVcp-CTL epitopes (8-10 amino acids) in the context of synthetic multi-epitope HCV vaccines has also been reported (7) (8) (9) . Besides, anticore antibodies are the first to be raised after the onset of infection, a property that has provided an important diagnostic value for this protein and has located it among antibody-capturing antigens in commercially available serological assays for HCV diagnosis (10) . In addition, nucleotide sequence of HCVcp is supposed to encode for other alternated frame-shift proteins (ARFPs) with important pathogenic roles in chronic HCV infection and cirrhosis (4, 11) . Therefore, to fulfill different diagnostic, research and therapeutic demands, production of HCVcp in various expression systems has been addressed (4) (5) . However, since the C-terminal hydrophobic region of HCVcp exerts immune-suppressive effects (4, 12) , its first 120 N-terminal residues, the hydrophilic region (HCVcp N-120), which contains both nuclear localization signals (NLS) (13) and most of the conserved B and T cell epitopes, is usually employed for different diagnostic (10, 14) and vaccine applications (15) (16) (17) .",

            "text": "Plants have an extensive potential to provide safe and inexpensive sources of biopharmaceutical and vaccination proteins (18) . Currently, several plant-derived viral proteins such as hepatitis B surface antigen (19) and Norwalk virus capsid protein (20) are in vaccination clinical trials. Recently, invention of transgenic tobacco plants expressing HCVcp stably at T0 and T1 generations (21) or directing the expression of its 143-amino acid Nterminal in tobacco chloroplasts (22) were reported. Although these prior reports proved the proper antigenic structure of the plant-derived HCVcp for diagnostic purposes and indicated its full functionality to react with poly/monoclonal anti-core antibodies and HCV-infected human sera, however, both studies addressed only the transgenic (stable) tobacco plant generation for HCVcp. However, transient expression in plants, compared with transgenic plant generation, is currently the method of choice due to several advantages like the simplicity and feasibility of rapid protein expression, omitting tissue culture and regeneration costs and ease of large scale industrial plans (23) (24) (25) . An important example of transient expression in plants is the production of seasonal influenza vaccines in tobacco (26) . The success in efficient plant transient expression, however, depends on several factors such as: codon-optimization of the heterologous gene according to the plant-codon adaptation index (27, 28) , selection of the proper expression vector (29, 30) , and efficient inhibition of the gene silencing phenomenon which suppresses the expression of foreign genes in plants (31) . While at present knowledge and techniques for the abovementioned parameters are being improved, providing novel data on transient expression process for the regionally-adapted plant hosts in general, and overcoming the plant-based gene silencing phenomenon in specific, is of high importance.",

Several modifications for optimized (plant) codon-usage of HCVcp nucleotide sequence were considered, including: i) Codon optimization according to the codon adaptation index of nuclear-encoded genes of tobacco (35) , ii) Removal of (plant) mRNA destabilizing sequences from the native HCVcp coding sequence, iii) Addition of Kozak (GCCAC-CATGGC) sequence (36) and hexahistidine (6xHis)-tag for nickel affinity purification at the 5\u2032 site, iv) Addition of nucleotides encoding endoplasmic reticulum retrieval signal (KDEL) at the 3\u2032 end (37) , v) Addition of BamHI and SacI restriction sites at both ends of the gene for directional cloning into the same sites of the plant expression binary vector pBI121 ( Figure 1 ). The plant-optimized HCVcp gene for recombinant expression in tobacco (also termed Tr-HCVcp) was synthesized and delivered as a clone in pUC57 plasmid by ShineGene Molecular Biotech Inc. (Shanghai, China). As shown in Figure 3 A, the synthetic gene was subcloned into BamHI and SacI sites of the pBI121 vector (38) under the control of CaMV 35S promoter and upstream of the nopaline synthase transcriptional terminator (NOS-Ter). In this study, the PVX-GW vector (32) , which was kindly gifted by Dr. Cristiano Lacorte (EMBRAPA Recursos Geneticos e Biotecnologia, Bras\u00edlia, Brazil), was used as the PVX-based viral vector. For cloning of the Tr-HCVcp sequence into PVX-GW vector, the synthetic gene was PCR amplified using a forward primer, F-Kozak-VX: 5\u0384-TAATATCGATCTCGAGCCACCATGGCTCATCACC-3\u0384 and a reverse primer, R-core-VX: 5\u0384-TAATGTCGACGGATCCT-CAGAGTTCGTCCTTCTTTC-3\u0384 harboring ClaI and SalI restriction sites (underlined sequences). PCR amplification was performed with 25 cycles at 94\u02daC for 30 seconds, 58\u02daC for 30 seconds, and 72\u02daC for 90 seconds and 72\u02daC for 15 minutes. The 439-bp amplicon was subsequently digested by ClaI and SalI enzymes and cloned into the same sites of PVX-GW vector under the control of duplicated PVX coat protein subgenomic promoter (CPP) (Figure 3 B ). All the recombinant constructs were confirmed by restriction and sequencing analyses using F-Kozak-VX and R-core-VX specific primers. All the cloning and molecular procedures were according to the standard protocols (39). The changes to the original sequence are shown by lower case letters. Location of the Kozak sequence, 6 xHis-tag, nucleotides encoding KDEL and restriction sites for BamHI and SacI are indicated. ATG and TGA denote the start and termination codons, respectively.",

Figure 1 represents the nucleotide changes applied in the basal sequence of HCVcp to improve its codon utilization for efficient expression in plants. Other elements (Kozak, KEDEL, His-tag and restriction sites) were also included in HCVcp basal sequence in Tr-HCVcp ( Figure  1 ). In addition, to remove the plant mRNA destabilizing sequence \"GGTAAG\" (nucleotides 358-363) which is present in native HCVcp sequence, it was modified ( Figure  1 ). As shown in Figure 2 A, the corresponding nucleotide alterations increased the codon adaptation index (CAI) value from 0.65 to 0.85 and reduced the GC content from 62.62 to 51.05 (Figure 2 B) . Results of DNA sequencing (not shown) indicated that the Kozak (GCCACCATGGC) sequence (36) , harboring the start codon (ATG) at 5', KDEL nucleotides at 3\u2032 end, the designed restriction sites and all nucleotide modifications, was properly located in the Tr-HCVcp sequence (Figure 1 Figure 3 represents the schematic of the constructed pBI-core (Figure 3 A) and PVX-core (Figure 3 B ) plant expression vectors harboring the Tr-HCVcp, located under the control of CaMV 35S promoter (in pBI-core) and CP promoter (in PVX-core), upstream of the NOS-Ter transcriptional terminator. The sequencing results (not shown) confirmed the presence of the cloned Tr-HCVcp gene in pBI-core and PVX-core expression vectors with no alterations in the nucleotides. The resulting plasmids were transferred into A. tumefaciens LBA4404 target hosts (in the case of PVX-core, A. tumefaciens LBA4404 harboring the pSOUP vector). The transformed Agrobacteria were screened for recombinant constructs using core-specific primers (F-Kozak-VX and R-core-VX) and the colony PCR assay indicated the expected 439-bp fragments (Figure 3 C) . One positive clone from each construct was subsequently used for agroinfiltration of N. tabacum leaves by p19 silencing-suppressor gene procedure as outlined in 3.3.",

The recent band was visible on a Coomassie-stained SDS-PAGE gel (Figure  4 B) and was also detected using anticore polyclonal antibodies in a western blot assay. There was no degradation of pHCVcp and the protein was not glycosylated because the size of the produced protein was as predicted by the protein sequence (https://www.genscript. com/ssl-bin/site2/peptide_calculation.cgi). As shown in Figure 4 C, the results of western blot analysis indicated that pHCVcp from PVX-core and pBI-core expressed a protein of approximately 15 kDa, while the negative control lacked the core protein and eHCVcp showed a higher molecular weight (~21 kDa, which is due to addition of vector-derived amino acids in pIVEX2.4a plasmid) and a few other lower-molecular weight protein bands which were presumably the results of ribosomal release and uncompleted translation, as previously reported (15) . It should be noted that dot blotting in this study was performed based on prior studies that used this procedure in complementation of western blotting (7, 8) . Indeed, In western blotting, the protein will be completely denatured (by boiling in SDS-PAGE loading buffer which contains 2-ME and SDS) and therefore some information that might be related to the native/soluble structure of the protein might be lost (e.g. interaction of protein with a conformational antibody), while dot blot assay was used as a preliminary and fast test to show if the protein was expressed.",

In this context and to perform an exact and precise quantitative ELISA, we used a specific monoclonal antibody against the core antigen (at the bottom of ELISA plates) and polyclonal anticore antibodies (at the top of the pHCVcp) in a sandwich ELISA-based protocol and also prepared a precise standard curve by applying serial dilution (0.1-1 \u00b5g/mL; data not shown) of purified eHCVcp to calculate the expression levels of pHCVcp. They were expressed in form of the percentage of TSP, which was determined using a Bradford protein assay. The leaves transformed by PVX (vector without HCVcp) and co-agroinfiltrated with P19 constructs were used as negative control (Figure 5 A) . The results indicated that the expression of pBI-core and PVX-core was around 0.004% of TSP in the absence of P19 co-agroinfiltration, whereas in its presence, the expression level of pBI-core and PVX-core increased to 0.019% (210 ng/g) and 0.022% (240 ng/g) of TSP fresh leaf weight, respectively, which was almost five times improvement for pHCVcp expression (Figure 5 A) .",

According to ELISA data, the concentration of pHCVcp was 1/20 of the column-purified protein.

            "text": "The primary objective of the present study was to provide an efficient transient tobacco system for expression of HCVcp in a regionally-adapted tobacco host (the Iranian Jafarabadi-tobacco plant cultivar). While other tobacco plant such as Australian Nicotiana species, N. benthamiana, is a well-known and hyper-susceptible host for plant-derived recombinant protein expression (47) , to our knowledge there was no prior report available on expression in Jafarabadi tobacco cultivar (which is one of the currently available tobacco cultivar in Iran). To address this concern, the first strategy that should be considered would be the optimization of the gene sequence for efficient codon usage by the plant (27) . In agreement, it is recently shown that the plant codonoptimized BPV-1 LI gene product increased significantly in comparison to the unmodified counterpart (28) . As shown in Figure 2 A, our codon optimization approach increased the CAI value from 0.65 to 0.85, which was in favor of codon utilization for N. tabacum (35) . Although increasing the CAI value is usually inevitably accompanied by increase of A + T percentage (which enhances mRNA instability and decreases the efficiency of translation) (48, 49) , our codon optimization approach that was based on the codon usage of nuclear-encoded genes of tobacco could keep the A + T percentage at 49%, while reducing the GC content from 62.62 to 51.05 (Figure 2 B) , almost the perfect range desired for GC content (50%). To ameliorate the expression level, insertion of the Kozak sequence (GCCACCATGGC) (36) at the translation start site (ATG) was also considered ( Figure 1 ). However, since the two base pairs immediately following the ATG start codon were \"C\" and \"A\" and were not compatible with the optimized Kozak sequence (underlined nucleotides), consistent with the approach undertaken by Amani et al. (50) , we had to insert the GCT sequence that codes for alanine (a nonpolar amino acid). Moreover, to improve the stability of pHCVcp, KDEL-encoded bases were also considered at the 3' site of the Tr-HCVcp sequence ( Figure 1 ). Employing this strategy for expression of human epidermal growth factor in tobacco resulted in a 10 4 -fold higher yield of protein expression (51) . Finally, in our codon optimization strategy, the possible deleterious splicing motif in plants \"GGTAAG\", resulting in RNA degradation and gene silencing of the gene (52) , was removed from the native HCVcp-coding sequence (nucleotides 358-363).",

In addition, the proper conformation of pHCVcp to interact with specific monoclonal antibody against 21-40 amino acids of the core antigen (coated at the bottom of the ELISA plates) and the polyclonal anticore antibodies (at the top of the pHCVcp in ELISA), supported the presence of various interactive epitopes on pHCVcp. The monoclonal antibody used in this study was against amino acids 21-40 on HCV core antigen. This region carries two important immunological epitopes which are conserved between HCV strains: 1a, 1b, and 2 (57): Moreover, the amino acids of 23-44 are highly promiscuous CD4+ T cell epitopes and the 35-44 amino acids are HCVspecific HLA-A2-restricted CTL epitopes. They have been shown to be effective immunogens in the vaccine phase of two clinical trials while are present on the HCV core particle or in multi-epitope complexes (58) .

For highest possible expression efficiency, the HCVcp DNA sequence was codon optimized (based on the CAI for nuclear-encoded genes of tobacco), destabilizing of the GGTAAG sequence in the native HCVcp coding sequence was altered and Kozak and KDEL sequences were included at the 5' and 3' ends, respectively. Two types of plant expression vectors (PVX-based and classic pBI121 binary) for HCVcp were constructed and their levels of protein expression in the presence and absence of P19 co-agroinfiltration were compared. The results indicated the significant effect of our approach in enhancement of the expression levels for pHCVcp. To our knowledge, all the above mentioned reports were first of their kinds for HCVcp and provided valuable information for plant-based expression studies on this antigen. The preliminary results (with five HCV positive sera) showed that plant-HCVcp has the capability to capture anti-HCVcp antibodies for potential clinical applications which should be further evaluated and confirmed by statistically acceptable numbers of positive sample sera. The next steps might be standardization of pHCVcp for application in diagnostic ELISA through application of positive sera with determined viral loads as well as precisely predetermined standard positive sera together with high number of optimization studies with different concentrations of antigen/antibody in ELISA with precise statistical analyses and evaluation of the pHCVcp for immunization studies.",
