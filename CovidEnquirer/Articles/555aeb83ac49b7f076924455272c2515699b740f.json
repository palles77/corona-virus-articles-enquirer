The ability of HERVs to become activated is linked to the chromatin state where a given copy is located [20] . DNA methylation and histone modifications are essential to the epigenetic control of human genes, including HERV elements. The prerequisite for functional transcription is that HERV sequences must retain functional long terminal repeats (LTRs), or become controlled by another promoter, without deletions or nucleotide substitutions that disrupt their open reading frames (ORFs). Because the nuclear microenvironment including the chromatin accessibility of coding regions differs between tissues, the baseline predisposition of a HERV copy to be activated can be tissue-, cell-, or maturation stage-specific.",

            "text": "An infectious origin of MS was suggested for the first time by Pierre Marie in 1884, but was rejected by the contemporary medical community. The evidence that viruses may contribute to MS comes from the accumulation of immune cells within the brain and CSF, local immune reactivity to specific viruses, and the presence of oligoclonal bands. MS epidemiology indicates some triggers during adolescence, an unusual geographic distribution (a gradient with latitude, but with exceptions: e.g., contrasting patterns in Sardinia and Japan), and epidemic clusters in previously isolated islands. Over time, several viruses have been proposed as causative agents of MS. From the 1940s onward they included rabies virus, herpes simplex virus (HSV), scrapie prion, an unidentified MS-associated agent, parainfluenza virus 1, measles virus, simian virus 5, chimpanzee cytomegalovirus, coronavirus, EBV, an unidentified SMON-like virus (subacute myelo-opticoneuropathy virus), tick-borne encephalitis virus, HTLV-1, HSV-1, VZV, and HHV-6. The proposed mechanisms were direct brain or peripheral infection, activation of autoreactive T cells against nerve myelin, bystander activation, epitope spreading, molecular mimicry, and virus-virus interactions. However, the link to MS was shown to be weak for the majority of the above viruses. The most consistent and independently confirmed studies for viral involvement in MS are for EBV. They appear to be confirmed, but only with indirect links, by history of infectious mononucleosis (IM; primary infection with EBV causes IM), and high anti-EBNA-1 (EBV nuclear antigen 1) IgG titers before MS onset. However, a new concept arose with the discovery that HERVs express pathogenic proteins in disease, and the best evidence of an association and pathogenic involvement is for HERV-W/MSRV (detected in MS blood, spinal fluid, and brain, in parallel with MS stages, active/remission phases, and therapy outcome). EBV is known to activate HERV-W/MSRV in vitro and in vivo (in IM patients and in healthy humans with high anti-EBNA1 IgG titers). This suggests that EBV could be an initial trigger, and that HERV-W/MSRV is a direct neuropathogenic contributor, before and during MS, in addition to its known contribution to promoting autoreactive T cells, immunoinflammation, and remyelination blockade.",

The symptoms usually start in one anatomical region and then spread, causing motor paralysis, dysphagia, and ultimately affecting respiratory function. In some cases ALS can also involve the prefrontal lobes, leading to cognitive dysfunction. The vast majority of the cases are sporadic, but in 10-20% patients genetic abnormalities are associated with familial forms of ALS. Chronic inflammatory demyelinating polyneuropathy (CIDP): a peripheral nervous system disease and the commonest chronic immune-mediated peripheral neuropathy that takes either a relapsing or progressive course. Clinically it manifests by the development of weakness and sensory disturbance that lead to marked disability. Multifocal inflammation and stripping of myelin sheaths by macrophages are thought to result from aberrant immune responses, mediated by T and/or B lymphocytes, against peripheral nerve antigens. Human endogenous retroviruses (HERVs): sequences belonging to human ERV families retaining structural features of retroviral genomes that have become integrated into the genome through repeated infections during evolution. Immune tolerance: unresponsiveness of the immune system to substances that normally elicit an immune response. Major histocompatibility complex (MHC): cell-surface proteins crucial for the recognition of foreign molecules by the immune system. They bind to antigens derived from pathogens and display them for recognition by appropriate T cells. Mobile genetic elements: these represent nearly 50% of the human genome, and consist of retrotransposons and DNA transposons. Myelin: a major component of white matter that consists of a lipid-rich structure organized into multilayered sheaths around axons. It provides axonal integrity, trophic and metabolic support, and accelerated reduction of anti-Env antibody reactivity for HERV-H and HERV-W [23] and MS-associated retrovirus (MSRV) load [24] in the blood have been in seen in MS patients treated with IFN-b, suggesting efficacy of the therapy or low disease activity.",

            "text": "After an initial study, which first presented evidence that herpesviruses might trigger HERVs in patients with MS as part of the retrovirus hypothesis for MS etiology [25] , several teams showed that transcription of HERV genes and/or reverse transcriptase (RT) activity is increased in various human cells in vitro by Herpesviridae with tropism for nervous cell. This includes herpes simplex virus type 1 (HSV-1) in lymphocytes from MS patients [ sequences representing remnants of mobile genetic machinery represent nearly 50% of the human genome. These are predominantly retrotransposons, that use RNA intermediates and a 'copypaste' mechanism for retrointegration into chromosomes, and DNA transposons that use a 'cut and paste' mechanism; these represent 42% and 3% of the human genome, respectively [3] . Among retrotransposons, an important group is represented by the endogenous retroviruses (ERVs; HERVs for human ERVs) that entered the genome of species through infections of germline cells during evolution leading to subsequent endogenizationintegration into the genome and presence in the DNA of every cell of the offspring [5] . About 8% of the human genome is constituted by HERV sequences; complete sequencing has revealed that intact coding sequences for functional HERV proteins represent <3%, if not 1% [101, 102] . The remaining sequences comprise non-coding DNA, often within introns of 'classical' genes, with a potential role in generating noncoding RNAs [103] . (B) Endogenous HERV DNA sequences are often truncated, and contain mutations, insertions, or deletions, but complete copies are also present. The gag (group-specific antigen), pol (polymerase), and env (envelope) genes encode structural proteins and are flanked by two inverted repeats of non-coding regions comprising many regulatory functions (promoter, enhancer, primer-binding site for reverse transcription, and others Other viruses reported to transactivate HERVs are the exogenous retroviruses HTLV-1 and HIV-1. Specifically, the HTLV-1 Tax transactivator potently increased the transcriptional activity of HERV-W, HERV-H, HERV-K, and HERV-E families in T cells [37] . Moreover, effects of HIV on HERV-K and on HERV-W in astrocyte cell lines and peripheral blood cells in vitro have been reported to be mediated by the HIV Tat protein, which can indirectly activate HERV-W through Toll-like receptor-4 (TLR4) along with TNF-a and NF-kB. Thus, by this pathway, HIV Tat could influence non HIV-infected cells [22] . This indirect mechanism suggests that the HIV-driven activation pathway requires persisting Tat stimulation for HERV activation. This differs from Herpesviridae in that self-sustained HERV expression may be induced following specific triggering events, which could explain the lifelong progression of MS and the multiple triggering events that are required before a pathogenic threshold leading to disease onset can be passed.",

Usually, T lymphocytes recognize their target antigen through a combination of variable domains in TCR chains that define the antigen-binding site of specific T cell clones. The interaction of these HERV Env proteins with another TCR region, which is known to be independent of the antigen-binding site and present on numerous T cells, is known to activate multiple clones irrespective of their antigen specificity. Molecules inducing such polyclonal activation are SAgs. An inflammatory loop also likely contributes to HERV pathogenicity: following initial priming and induction of specific HERV copies, macrophages and/or B cells produce HERV Env proteins that might fuel local innate inflammation and upregulate major histocompatibility complex nerve conduction. Its structural integrity is of vital importance for CNS function.",

Demyelinated CNS axons are functionally impaired, highly vulnerable, and degenerate over time. In contrast to peripheral neurons, such injured central neurons lack the capacity to regrow axons, and this further contributes to irreversible functional deficits.

There is no available cure for MS, and current therapies can only limit the number of relapses and slow disease progression. The most common symptoms include chronic fatigue, paresthesia with acute and chronic pain, optic neuritis, paresis, gait disturbance, incoordination, sphincter problems, and cognitive impairment, altogether leading to progressive disability. Histopathologically, MS is characterized by demyelinating lesions that predominantly expand in the white matter, causing destruction of myelin and oligodendrocytes and leading to axonal disruption in the brain and spinal Figure 2 . Successive Steps Leading to Endogenization of Retroviruses and to Multicopy Endogenous Retroviral (ERV) Families in Descendants. This illustration depicts the successive steps of retroviral endogenization, starting from infection of gametes, integration of a DNA retroviral copy (provirus) into a chromosome, giving birth to a viable individual inheriting and retaining this copy in the DNA of all cells and transmitting this to its offspring. Throughout successive generations and evolution, both endogenous retrotranspositions and reinfections of the germline of particular individuals (provided that the exogenous strain persists in the environment) generates multiple and variable copy numbers in the final population. This variability has been well known in some animal species and has recently also been evidenced in humans [91] . Abbreviations: env, envelope; gag, group-specific antigen; LTR, long terminal repeat; pol, polymerase. . Whereas initial disease stages may present reversible phases with remission following relapse, evolution towards progressive forms generally follows [42] . The relapsing forms are dominated by aberrant inflammatory responses, whereas in progressive stages neurodegenerative features take precedence. This may be paralleled by repeated abnormal lymphocyte stimulation that is known to lead to T cell exhaustion, anergy, or depletion [43] , and which implicitly downregulates T cell-driven activation of B cells [44] .",

Subsequent studies over the following 25 years revealed that these particles originated from HERV elements, first termed MS-associated retrovirus (MSRV), whose sequences were determined from purified retrovirus-like particles isolated from MS cell culture supernatants [59, 60] . The initial sequence identified from several MS isolates was obtained using a PCR protocol designed to detect unknown retroviral sequences flanked by conserved domains in most retroviral pol (polymerase) genes [61] . This prototype MSRV sequence identified a previously unknown HERV family, now named HERV-W because it uses a tryptophan (W) tRNA as a primer for reverse transcription, and that comprises multiple copies homologous to MSRV prototypic sequences [59, 62] .",

HERV-W association with MS was further evidenced by studies showing that expression levels not only correlated with MS but also increased with disease activity and progression [24, 64, 65, 67] . Further investigations indicated that HERV protein expression is mainly restricted to macrophages and microglia, a minor proportion of lymphocytes, and to a few endothelial and astrocyte cells in active lesion areas [31,63,68,69]. HERV-W Env protein was similarly detected in MS lesions by using different monoclonal antibodies (mAbs) directed against different epitopes [64] . Its association with areas of active demyelination from active to chronic brain lesions, with fairly intense expression until the death of the patient, as seen post-mortem, suggests an involvement in the long-term pathogenic progression of the disease [69] .",

Treatment of cultured primary oligodendroglial precursor cells (OPCs) with HERV-W Env was shown to result in an overall reduction of oligodendroglial differentiation via activation of TLR4 [68] . OPCs contribute to neuroregeneration and myelin repair processes in the adult CNS, and blocking their differentiation by HERV-W Env protein may therefore result in remyelination failure ( Figure 4 ). The negative impact on myelin synthesis in primary oligodendroglial cells could be rescued using a specific Env-neutralizing humanized immunoglobulin termed GNbAC1 [72] . Different mAb versions of GNbAC1 have been assessed on a small scale in MSRV Env-induced experimental allergic encephalitis (EAE), an animal model of MS, and these appeared to inhibit and somehow reverse EAE clinical evolution [73] . In addition, exposure of the HCMEC/D3 brain endothelial cell line to HERV-W Env was shown to impair endothelial cell physiology by boosting ICAM-1 expression (allowing T cell homing into tissues) and proinflammatory cytokine release via TLR4 activation, thereby suggesting that Env might affect BBB integrity (Figure 3 ) [74] .",

This trial was a baseline-versus-treatment study with 20 patients with active RRMS defined as gadolinium-enhancing lesions on magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) at baseline. They were monitored for 3 months with monthly MRI and then treated with the integrase inhibitor raltegravir for 3 months. This trial did not reach its primary endpoint goal of significantly reducing either lesion count or lesion development during the treatment period versus baseline. Nonetheless, the tested drug is a known and effective inhibitor of HIV integrase which plays a role in chromosomal retrointegration of newly generated HIV DNA copies. Because this may not be a major aspect of HERV expression, and is unlikely to be a key issue for HERV Env production, the mode of action of this anti-HIV drug may not have had relevant effects on HERVs, thus explaining the negative results of the study.",

Such direct effects on Schwann cells, and the ability of HERV-W Env protein to cause tissue inflammation and systemic autoimmunity, make it an interesting potential new target for the treatment of patients with CIDP and HERV-W upregulation. This evidence suggests that HERV-W is not specific for MS, but may be involved in different diseases through the pathogenic properties of its Env protein upon activation by variable factors in different conditions, tissues, and organs.",

Sequencing of pol gene RNA transcripts suggested activation of multiple loci, with predominant homology to a copy in chromosome 7 [86] . A subsequent study showed expression of HERV-K pol, env, and gag genes in the brains of patients with sporadic ALS [87] . Expression levels of each gene correlated with each other, suggesting that an entire HERV-K genome is activated.

HERV-K represents thousands of insertions in the human genome, and 11 largely complete proviral sequences have been identified to date [88, 89] . The number of insertions can vary between human populations, and copies are not necessarily found at a fixed chromosomal site in all carrier individuals [90, 91] , while new insertions are thought to have occurred within the past 2 million years after the appearance of modern human [89] . Some of the recently endogenized HERV-K elements have complete ORFs and can form complete viral particles [92] . These are probably recent insertions into the human genome because evolution has not yet introduced major deletions or mutations, and epigenetic mechanisms are likely to be responsible for HERV-K gene silencing, which may be overcome by environmental triggers. Given this genetic complexity, it remains unknown whether the expression of HERV-K in patients with ALS derives from a single copy with a complete retroviral sequence or might represent trans-complementation between partially defective but complementary copies. Such a scenario may also be relevant for the activation of HERV-W in MS because it could also result in the expression of HERV pathogenic protein(s).",

Because HERV-K, although endogenous, retains retroviral properties that underlie its pathogenic expression, an approach to drug development similar to that taken for HIV could be considered. A panel of antiretroviral drugs approved for treating HIV infection was screened, but elevated concentrations were found to be necessary to control HERV-K replication in HeLa cells in vitro [95] . A previous pilot clinical trial with indinavir, a protease inhibitor used for HIV antiretroviral therapy, failed to show any efficacy in ALS [96] . Notably, some patients with HIV infection can develop an ALS-like syndrome, which may show symptom regression and halted evolution under treatment with anti-HIV drugs [97] . These patients also showed expression of HERV-K in blood, the levels of which fell in all patients after the initiation of antiretroviral drugs [98] . As previously discussed in the context of HERV-W, it is possible that HIV proteins such as Tat may regulate the expression of HERV-K [99] , and this could explain why the triggering pathways and expression feedback loops may differ in sporadic ALS that is not associated with HIV. It remains possible that anti-HIV drugs might indeed inhibit HERV-K, but that their efficacy is not as good as for HIV [95] . To further investigate the possibility that antiretroviral therapies might be of benefit in ALS, an open-label pilot study has been initiated in Australia and the UK. The trial is enrolling 40 patients with ALS, and will follow them for 3 months without treatment; then treat them for 6 months with triumeqwhich includes two reverse transcriptase inhibitors (abacavir and amivudine) that have been shown to effectively inhibit HERV-K reverse transcriptase activity in vitro, and an integrase inhibitor dolutegravir (Clinicaltrials.gov identifier: NCT02868580).",

This figure relates to the most recent HERV-K insertions (and not to previous HERV-K/HML-2 insertions at 30 million years ago), which are thought to be the most active copies because they are normally less mutated than earlier insertions. When activated in specific areas of the central nervous system, the resulting pathogenic pathway involves HERV-K expression and release of its envelope (Env) protein that causes neurotoxicity in targeted motor neurons. factors [100] and their relevant pathogenic effects, are unlikely to be limited to the examples discussed in the present review. Although many issues remain unresolved (see Outstanding Questions), this scientific domain represents a rapidly evolving area of cutting-edge research (Box 2), and further studies may reveal that HERVs contribute to other complex and multifactorial human diseases. Therapeutic approaches targeting toxic HERV proteins or, more directly, HERV gene expression may thus create a change of paradigm with completely novel treatment perspectives. Finally, but not of the least interest, treatments targeting non-physiological HERV Mul ple pathogenic outcomes in the brain and in TLR4 + target cells ",
