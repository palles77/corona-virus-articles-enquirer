            "text": "Neboviruses (NeVs) is an important causative agent of calf diarrhea. Here, 354 diarrhoeic samples were collected from yak on 55 farms in the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, China. 22.0% of the diarrhoeic samples were detected as NeVs-positive by RT-PCR assay. Phylogenetic analysis of 78 NeVs RdRp fragments showed that 69 strains were closely related to NB-like strains, and the remaining 9 strains were clustered into an independent branch, which may represent a novel RdRp genotype. Two complete NeVs genomes (YAK/NRG-17/17/CH and YAK/HY1-2/18/ CH) were successfully sequenced with 7459 nt and 7460 nt in length, respectively. The genomes of the two strains only shared 68.1%-69.3% nt identity with all six known NeVs genomes, and phylogenetic trees based on its genome, VP1, RdRp, VP2, P34, NTPase, P30, VPg and 3CLpro proteins suggested that the two strains may represent a novel NeVs strain with novel VP1 genotype and novel RdRp genotype. Notably, 11.5% NeVs strains were screened as the novel NeVs strains based VP1 and RdRp sequences. These novel NeVs strains were detected from 6 farms in two counties, indicating that the novel NeVs has spread in local region. To best of our knowledge, this is the first detection of NeVs in yak. Moreover, a novel NeVs strain was identified based on complete genome. These results contribute to further understand the prevalence and genetic evolution of NeVs.",

To date, Neboviruses (NeVs) has been detected in 13 countries with a wide geographical distribution (Candido et al., 2016; Di Martino et al., 2011; Guo et al., 2018a; Turan et al., 2018) . Unlike other genera Norovirus and Lagovirus in family Caliciviridae (Kroneman et al., 2013; Le Pendu et al., 2017) , a system of dual nomenclature based on the partial RdRp and complete VP1 sequences has not yet been established in NeVs. Thus, the molecular characteristics of NeV are still described based on RdRp or VP1, respectively. Unlike noroviruses and lagoviruses (Le Pendu et al., 2017; Zheng et al., 2006) , there is still no clear definition for NeVs genotype classification due to the lack of sufficient NeVs sequences to calculate the genetic distance cutoffs. NeVs can be subclassified into two RdRp genotypes (NB-like and NA1-like) and two VP1 genotypes (genotype 1 and genotype 2) based on sequence and phylogenetic analysis (Guo et al., 2018c) . The VP1 genotype 1 can be further subdivided into four lineages (D'Mello et al., 2009; Guo et al., 2018b) . Currently, NB-like strains detected in 12 countries have been the most common genotype in circulation worldwide, and NA1-like strains have been detected in 4 countries (Hassine-Zaafrane et al., 2012; Park et al., 2008; Pourasgari et al., 2018) . The VP1 genotype 1 strains have been detected in 9 countries, and genotype 2 strains only have been detected in France and China (Guo et al., 2018c; Kaplon et al., 2011) .",

ORF-1 is 2210 amino acids (aa) in length and encodes a large nonstructural polyprotein comprising a P34, NTPase, P30, VPg, 3CLpro and RdRp protein, contiguous with the major capsid protein (VP1). ORF-2 is located at the 3\u2032 end of the complete genome and encodes a minor capsid protein (VP2) composed of 225 aa (Guo et al., 2018b; Oliver et al., 2006) . The VP1 is the major structural component of NeVs and is involved in the binding of ABO histo-blood group antigen (HBGAs) (Cho et al., 2018) . Moreover, the VP1 of other caliciviruses has been identified to be involved in host specificity and immunogenicity (Chen et al., 2006; Smith et al., 2019; Song et al., 2017) . Although the precise functions of NeVs RdRp has not been determined, the RdRp of other caliciviruses is a key enzyme responsible for transcription, replication of the viral genome and accurate initiation of RNA synthesis (Deval et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2017) .",

Our previous studies confirmed that NeVs has circulated widely in dairy cows in China (Guo et al., 2018a, c) . In this study, we sought to determine if NeVs infects yak. Unexpectedly, a novel NeVs with novel RdRp genotype and novel VP1 genotype was identified based on its complete genome, and this novel NeVs has spread in local province.",

The aa identities of the individual proteins also supported that the two strains represent a novel NeVs strain that is distinct from other known NeVs strains (Table 2) . No recombination events were identified in the complete genome of the two NeVs strains in this study.",

Interestingly, the 69 strains in NB-like were most related to NeVs strains determined in Chinese dairy cow (Guo et al., 2018c) . It is possible that NeVs in yak was transmitted from NeVs in dairy cows. Moreover, these 69 strains from distinct geographic regions were located at a unique branch due to three identical nucleotide nonsense mutations (G173 T, T176C, and C188 T), instead of clustered into distinct branch based on geographic region, indicating that NeVs of NB-like genotype in yak showed unique evolutionary characteristics. The unique evolution of NeVs in yak may be related to the host species and special geographical environment of the Qinghai-Tibet Plateau, i.e., the high-altitude, low oxygen, low temperature, and low atmospheric pressure. In fact, the unique evolutionary trend has been observed previously in dairy cows in China and South Korea (Guo et al., 2018c; Park et al., 2008) . Although the biological significance of the nonsense mutation at the 3\u02b9 end of the RdRp region in NeVs is still unclear, the influence of the mutation in this region on NeVs detection is worthy of attention, since this region is used as the target of molecular detection for NeVs (Park et al., 2009 (Park et al., , 2006 Smiley et al., 2003) .",

Thus, the VP1 of strains YAK/NRG-17/17/CH and YAK/HY1-2/18/CH may represent a novel VP genotype, proposed to be genotype 3. The VP1 is the major structural component of caliciviruses and is involved in host specificity and immunogenicity (Chen et al., 2006) , and the hypervariable P2 domain is involved in the binding of ABO histo-blood group antigen (HBGAs) (Hansman et al., 2011; Tan and Jiang, 2011) . Previous studies suggested that the histo-blood group antigen interactions vary among genotypes in noroviruses, for example, GII.4 viruses seem capable of binding to a wider range of histo-blood group antigens compared with other noroviruses genotypes and therefore have a larger susceptible population to infect (White, 2015) . Recently, nebovirus-like capsid particles (strain Bo/BNeV/MA415/04/KR of genotype 1.3) were shown to interact with a wide spectrum of histoblood group antigens (Cho et al., 2018) . Strains YAK/NRG-17/17/CH and YAK/HY1-2/18/CH has many identical amino acid variations in VP1, especially in the P2 domain. These variations in VP1 may influence the HBGAs interaction, and it is worthy to further study the interaction between different NeVs VP1 genotypes and HBGAs. To date, NeVs can be divided into two RdRp genotypes (NA1-like and NB-like) based on sequences and phylogenetic analysis (Guo et al., 2018c) . In this study, the complete RdRp of strains YAK/NRG17/17/CH and YAK/HY1-2/18/CH shared 74.2%-75.7% aa identity (66.1%-67.6% nt identity) with all known six NeVs complete RdRp. Phylogenetic analysis based on complete RdRp showed that the two strains were clustered into an independent large branch. Moreover, strains YAK/NRG17/17/CH and YAK/HY1-2/18/CH share 106 identical amino acid variations in the complete RdRp region (485 amino acid), compared with other all six available complete RdRp. These results suggested that the RdRp of strains YAK/NRG17/17/CH and YAK/ HY1-2/18/CH could represent a novel RdRp genotype, proposed to be SC-YAK.",

However, RdRp of the other caliciviruses plays a critical role in the replication (Deval et al., 2016; Lee et al., 2017) . The rotation of the central helix in the thumb domain and displacement of the C-terminal tail at the active site are essential to bind RNA and substrates (Lee et al., 2017) . In this study, strains YAK/NRG17/17/CH and YAK/HY1-2/18/ CH share 8 identical amino acid variations in the C-terminal region (35 amino acid), compared with other all six available complete RdRp, which may have influence the virus replication of the novel NeVs strain. RdRp-driven genetic diversity is vital for viral fitness (Deval et al., 2016) . In pandemic noroviruses strain, the RdRp displays reduced replication fidelity, which results in higher mutation rate and rate of viral evolution compared to the non-pandemic and less frequently detected strains (Bull et al., 2010) . Currently, NB-like genotype of NeVs has been detected in 12 countries; and NA1-like strains have been detected in 4 countries (Park et al., 2008; Hassine-Zaafrane et al., 2012; Pourasgari et al., 2018; Turan et al., 2018) . It seems that NeVs of different RdRp genotypes are different in prevalence. It is worthy to further monitor the prevalence of the novel RdRp genotype.",
