The incidence of acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS) was 14.8%, the incidence of abnormal chest computer tomography (CT) was 96.6%, the percentage of severe cases in all infected cases was 18.1%, and the case fatality rate of patients with 2019-nCoV infection was 4.3%. Conclusion: Fever and cough are the most common symptoms in patients with 2019-nCoV infection, and most of these patients have abnormal chest CT examination. Several people have muscle soreness or fatigue as well as ARDS. Diarrhea, hemoptysis, headache, sore throat, shock, and other symptoms only occur in a small number of patients. The case fatality rate of patients with 2019-nCoV infection is lower than that of Severe Acute Respiratory Syndrome (SARS) and Middle East Respiratory Syndrome (MERS).",

All included literature were evaluated using The statistical software Stata version 12.0 was used to carry out the single arm Meta-analysis. Original data included in the literature were first transformed by double arcsine method to make them conform to normal distribution and then analyzed in Stata. The initial conclusion obtained by Meta-analysis was then restored using formula (P=(sin(tp/2)) 2 ) to reach final conclusion. In order to objectively evaluate the publication bias of the included literature, the Egger test with P < 0.05 as the existence of publication bias was performed, the values larger than which were considered as no publication bias.",

            "text": "It was reported that 83% of II-type alveolar cells expressed ACE2. Therefore, 2019-nCoV infection causes damages to most II type alveolar cells. In addition, the use of mechanical ventilation in the treatment of patients with 2019-nCoV infection can also aggravate the injury of alveolar cells. After alveolar cell injury, transforming growth factor-\u03b2 (TGF\u03b2 ) released in tissue promotes the lung repair. Virus infection often leads to excessive activation of TGF-\u03b2 pathway, which leads to the occurrence of pulmonary fibrosis. Based on the mechanism of pulmonary fibrosis after virus infection, we can formulate corresponding prevention and treatment proposals. The first is the treatment of 2019-nCoV infection. At present, a variety of drugs have been found to inhibit 2019-nCoV. Michelle L. Holshue et al. [26] achieved remarkable results in the treatment of patients with 2019-nCoV infection with remdesivir. This drug is currently in clinical trials. Second, it is necessary [7] Chen N, Zhou M, Dong X,et al.
