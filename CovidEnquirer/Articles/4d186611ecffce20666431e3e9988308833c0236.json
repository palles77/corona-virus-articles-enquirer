The patients in the two PEEP8 and PEEP10 intervention groups separately received 8 cm H2O and 10 cm H2O PEEP, respectively, 30 minutes after admission to the ICU for 4 hours and then received 5 cm H2O PEEP until extubation.

The importance of postoperative atelectasis is due to the absence of obvious clinical symptoms, and therefore it does not attract the attention of medical personnel and healthcare staff.

Given the simultaneous use of all active respiratory physiotherapy procedures, the high incidence rate of atelectasis after heart surgery is still reported in patients (7, 15) . One of these methods that are utilized less as a preventive operation is the use of PEEP in patients undergoing mechanical ventilation in the intensive care unit or during recovery. PEEP is applied along with an increase in respiratory factors, lung volumes and improved gas and alveolar exchanges (16, 17) , and is recommended for the main treatment of collapse created in patients under anesthesia with healthy lungs (18, 19) , atelectasis treatment and improved arterial oxygenation (20, 21) . Some studies on the benefits of PEEP different levels reported that elevated values could lead to a reduction in ventilator duration and increased survival odds ratio (22) . A study on the adverse effects of high levels (PEEP>10 cm of water) reported an increase in ventilation duration, prolonged intubation (23) and increased length of hospitalization (24) . This complication in above studies resulting from the use of PEEP was equal to 30 cm of water. Some of the articles pointed out the lack of difference among different levels (25) (26) (27) . Meanwhile, most of the studies examined patients undergoing coronary artery bypass graft surgery, and no studies have been done on other cardiac surgical patients. Moreover, the application of PEEP is raised as an effective therapeutic method and is used less as a preventive method for all patients.",

The participants were allocated in three groups of PEEP8, PEEP10, and control using Excel's RANDBETWEEN function. Each group was identified by a letter: A to PEEP8, B to PEEP10, and C to control group. 180 envelopes were sequentially numbered from 1 to 180 for three groups. Each opaque and sealed envelope contained a letter (A, B, or C) randomly selected using RANDBETWEEN function of Excel. This procedure was carried out by someone not involved in the project.

The data 4 gathering tool consisted of demographic questionnaire, medical and surgical questionnaires, which the researcher recorded all of them. The demographic and medical information were age, sex, smoking, and body mass index. Data on surgical and postoperative status included the type of surgery (vessels, valves, combined), number of grafted vessels, duration of surgery, cardiopulmonary bypass time, aortic clamp time, number of chest tubes, duration of mechanical ventilation in the ICU, duration of intubation and atelectasis on chest x-ray, which were collected through patient records and during the process of patient care and the mentioned questionnaire. Before the intervention, the incidence rate of atelectasis was measured in all three groups. The patients in control group by having the inclusion criteria and 30 minutes after admission to ICU received 5 cm H 2 O PEEP until extubation according to routine care. The patients in the two PEEP8 and PEEP10 intervention groups separately received 8 cm H 2 O PEEP and 10 cm H 2 O PEEP, respectively, 30 minutes after admission to the ICU for 4 hours in the absence of impairment of the hemodynamic status and then had 5 cm H 2 O PEEP until extubation. The incidence rate of atelectasis two hours after extubation and on the third postoperative day (72 hours after surgery) was recorded. None of the routine care in all three groups was omitted, but the entire health care was tried to be done. The initial consequence was atelectasis, as interpreted by a radiologist based on chest X-ray radiography. The secondary consequences included intubation time in postcardiac surgery intensive care unit, length of ICU and hospital stay.",

            "text": "The results of this study demonstrated that the prophylactic use of 10 cm H 2 O PEEP in patients with mechanical 6 ventilation in the ICU after heart surgery can lead to a significant reduction in the incidence rate of atelectasis after extubation on the first and third days after surgery. It seems that using this level of PEEP prevents the collapse of the airways, high functional residual capacity (FRC), improved alveolar performance with increased pressure and volume of the alveoli (29) as well as elevated pulmonary compliance (30) . However, 8 cm H 2 O PEEP and 5 cm H 2 O PEEP had no significant effect in reducing the incidence rate of atelectasis. In a similar study on the effect of 5 cm H 2 O PEEP and 10 cm H 2 O PEEP after coronary artery bypass surgery, a significant difference was observed between the two groups in terms of atelectasis incidence. Thus, some degree of atelectasis was found among the intervention (26.7%) and the control (56.7%) groups that the level of 10 cm H 2 O PEEP reduced the incidence rate of atelectasis, which is in line with the present study. Compared with our study, in the mentioned study the patients in the intervention group did not receive constant PEEP, but the rate varied between 5 to 10 cm of water until tracheal extubation depending on the patient's condition. In addition, the patients in the control group received PEEP less than 5 cm of water. However, in our study, all patients in the control group received at least 5 cm H 2 O PEEP ; this could be the reasons for the high percentages in both intervention and control groups in the above study compared with the present study (28) . In another study on the effect of PEEP on respiratory function after heart surgery in three groups, the patients experienced three levels of PEEP including 0, 5 and 10-15 cm of water after heart surgery. The results showed that the PEEP levels of less than 10 cm H 2 O had no effect on the reopening of the lungs with atelectasis, which is in line with the above study. The difference of the current research with the above study design is the use of various levels and periods of PEEP. Thus, the PEEP in the mentioned study was applied 3 to 5 hours after admission in the ICU until extubation, and the patients did not receive PEEP greater than 10 cm of water within the constant time so that the patients were given PEEP for 15 minutes and again after 20 minutes of pause. In the present study, the patients received 8 or 10 cm H 2 O PEEP for a maximum of 4 hours continuously, which the time remained constant for all samples (31) . A prospective clinical trial that was carried out on non-hypoxic patients connected to mechanical ventilation with normal chest X-ray showed that 0, 5 or 8 cm H 2 O PEEP levels had no effect on the incidence of atelectasis; it is in line with the present study. The results of the study showed that the levels of 5 to 8 cm H 2 O PEEP improved hypoxia and reduced the incidence rate of ventilator-associated pneumonia in the patients. Unlike the present study the patients did not undergo heart surgery, but the patients in the general and trauma intensive care units were studied (32) .",

These levels had no effect on the incidence of atelectasis (35) , contrary to the present findings. In this study, the incidence of atelectasis was measured on the fifth day after surgery; the sample size in their three groups was 44 people. In the present study, the incidence of atelectasis was measured on the first and third days and the sample size was 180; this seems to be the reason for the differences in the results. It also appears that the mean duration of cardiopulmonary bypass in above study was much longer than the present study; prolongation of bypass duration is directly related to the incidence of pulmonary complications after heart surgery, including atelectasis (6) .",

This result is consistent with the present study and the duration was reduced only in the 10 cm H 2 O PEEP group. Another study on PEEP following coronary artery bypass grafting reported that levels over 10 cm H 2 O PEEP increased ventilation duration (23), contrary to our results. This difference seems to be due to the fact that the average age is an important factor in the delayed extubation and in an increase of connectivity to ventilator after heart surgery (36) . In the mentioned study, the average age in the group with high levels of PEEP was equal to 65\u00b18 years; but in the present study, age over 65 years was one of the exclusion criteria.",
