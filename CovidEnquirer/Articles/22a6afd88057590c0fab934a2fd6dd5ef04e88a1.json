The subcutaneous use of oil-adjuvanted vaccines also results in swelling of the injection site. If these swellings do not subside in a short period, if they become larger than a small hen's egg, or if they become fluid filled, they may be infected and should be examined. 2 Proper cleaning of syringes begins with using hot water, soap, and a brush to clean the external surface and working mechanism of the syringe. Care should be taken to keep soap away from the luer tip of the syringe. After cleaning the external components, rinse the internal components with distilled or deionized water that is warmer than 82.2 C (180 F) by drawing the water into the syringe and squirting it out several times. 2 All syringes, whether pistol grip repeaters or continuous feed syringes with vinyl tubing and vent spikes, can be cleaned in this manner. Soap and disinfectant should not be used on the internal components of syringes. Remove as much water as possible from the syringe and allow it to cool before use, because heat inactivates modified live viral vaccines. Some syringes may need to be disassembled to adequately clean them. Disassembly should be performed on a clean work surface followed by cleaning the components with hot tap water, avoiding the use of soap or disinfectant. If syringes are physically contaminated enough to require disassembly for cleaning, they should be boiled for 5 minutes in deionized or distilled water. Plastic, continuous feed syringes can be sanitized after cleaning, if necessary. The syringe and tubing should be filled with distilled water and wrapped in multiple layers of paper towels. After soaking the paper towels in water, the syringe is placed in an unclosed zip-lock bag. This bag is placed in a microwave oven for 5 minutes using the high setting. Care should be taken that the paper towels do not dry out during this process. Syringes should be individually microwaved when using this method. After the syringes are removed from the microwave, any water remaining in them should be squirted out and the syringe allowed to cool before using.",

The use of disposable needles is recommended, because they are sterile and are sharp. Using steel needles that are reusable is discouraged, because they are difficult to sterilize and keep sharp.

These products should be protected from freezing and heat, because either can cause damage to the product. If the rubber stoppers on stored bottles of product are damaged enough to not seal the bottle, the product may deteriorate because of exposure to air. These bottles should be capped in some manner, such as a roll-on rubber stopper, to prevent exposure of the product to air.",

When this sequence is followed, the cattle tend to move forward, without the use of an electrical prod.
