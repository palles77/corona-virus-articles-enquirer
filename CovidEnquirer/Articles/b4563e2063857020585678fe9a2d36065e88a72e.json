The present study investigated heated water as a method for rapid thermal inactivation of PEDV.

Viable PEDV was not recovered after a ten second or longer treatment with water heated to \u226576\u00b0C; however, PEDV nucleic acid was detected in all samples regardless of treatment.

The vast majority of PEDV control studies have focused on various applications of chemical disinfectants, heat, alterations to pH, and drying. Chemical disinfectants have received the most attention and many classes are able to inactivate PEDV (Bowman et al., 2015b; Schneider, Zhang, Ramirez, Wang & Holtkamp, 2015) . However, some chemical disinfectants are corrosive to metal surfaces, hazardous to human and animal health, and inactivated with organic material and water with high mineral content (Babb, Bradley & Ayliffe, 1980; Racioppi et al., 1994) . Additionally, most chemical disinfectants require prolonged contact times to achieve maximum effectiveness (Rutala, Weber, David & the Healthcare Infection Control Practices Advisory Committee (HIPAC), 2008), which can be problematic in various sectors of the highthroughput swine production chain.",

PEDV has been shown to maintain infectivity at temperatures as high as 50\u00b0C, but infectivity is lost when heated above 60\u00b0C for 30 min (Hofmann & Wyler, 1989) . Within the U.S. swine industry, it has been advised for animal hauling trailers to be heated to 71\u00b0C for 10 min to ensure inactivation of PEDV (Thomas et al., 2015b) . However, use of heat in this setting requires specialized equipment and a prolonged period, which can be a challenge in such a high turn-over industry. While not targeting PEDV, animal harvest facilities routinely use the application of 83\u00b0C water for approximately five seconds to thermally inactivate many pathogens on meat cutting equipment (Taormina & Dorsa, 2007) . The present study sought to investigate hot water as a method for rapid thermal inactivation of PEDV.",

Once the virus was introduced to the United States, PEDV spread rapidly across the country, likely through gaps in biosecurity protocols (Bowman, Krogwold, Price, Davis & Moeller, 2015a; Lowe et al., 2014) . The relative ease with which this virus can spread via fomites is due in part to the extremely low dose required to infect na\u00efve pigs (Thomas et al., 2015a) ; even miniscule amounts of viable virus appear to be adequate to initiate large swine outbreaks. Furthermore, with the ability to survive in the environment for up to 180 days in soybean meal (Dee et al., 2015) and 9 months in manure storage structures (Tun, Cai, & Khafipour, 2016) , PEDV can persist long enough in the swine production chain to circumvent typical management practices designed to protect the health of pigs. Heated water may be useful in situations where penetration of objects with chemical disinfectants is difficult and where corrosion of the target materials (e.g. metal surfaces, rubber gaskets, etc.) should be minimized.",

This limitation is important to consider when developing disinfection strategies to prevent the transmission of PEDV to na\u00efve swine. One challenge with the use of many classes of disinfectants is the inability to disrupt RNA beyond the threshold of detection, which makes it impossible to discern disinfection effectiveness from a PCR positive test result (Bowman et al., 2015b; Thomas et al., 2015b) .

However, the desired treatment temperature was always verified at the time of inoculation and given the observed rapid results, we concluded the temperature fluctuations were of minimal impact. Additionally, the first sampling time point (5 s post inoculation) may not have provided sufficient time for thorough mixing prior to sample collection. It is also important to note that cell culture assay may underestimate the actual viral infectivity when compared to animal bioassays. Further studies might include observing the infectivity in neonatal pigs in comparison to weaned pigs which would validate whether hot water would be a feasible disinfectant for a swine farm (Thomas et al., 2015a) .",
