            "text": "PF can result from many endogenous or exogenous causes, such as infection, chemical poisoning, radiation, etc. Bleomycininduced pulmonary fibrosis (BLMPF) in rats has been widely used as a model to investigate the pathology of PF (Giri, 2003) . In recent years, a number of studies showed significant up-regulation of inducible nitric oxide synthetase (iNOS) and transforming growth factor-\u24241 (TGF-\u24241) in the lung tissue of BLMPF rats that resembled clinical findings in PF patients (Khalil et al., 1993; Gurujeyalakshmi et al., 2000; Coker et al., 2001; Romanska et al., 2002) . These similarities suggest that the active iNOS in inflammatory cells is responsible for excessive formation of nitric oxide (NO), and is involved in pulmonary injury (Hobbs et al., 1999) . Meanwhile, these results further suggest that TGF-\u24241 derived from fibroblasts is one of the key cytokines in fibrogenetic phase of PF, and may result in collagen overproduction and deposition in lungs (Coker et al., 2001) . These two factors play important roles during the PF induced by bleomycin, and therefore have been regarded as pathological markers in researches and as potential therapeutic targets in treatments (Hobbs et al., 1999; Flanders and Burmester, 2003) .",

            "text": "It is well known that PF is hard to treat clinically and few medications successfully relieve the condition. Corticosteroid therapy is the first-line choice to prevent and treat this disease (American Thoracic Society, 2000) . Laboratory studies showed that corticosteroids might prevent the collagen overexpression (Dik et al., 2003) and might decrease up-regulated cytokines including TGF-\u24241 in BLMPF models (Khalil et al., 1993) . In other studies, corticosteroids might inhibit iNOS overexpression during acute cardiac allograft rejection, although this effect has not been reported in PF (Worrall et al., 1996) . Since unacceptable adverse effects are associated with corticosteroid treatments, searching for more effective and safer therapies has been one of the hot topics in this field. In recent years, it has been reported that curcumin, a botanical compound with anti-inflammatory, anti-oxidant and anti-tumor effects, can ameliorate adverse pathological changes in BLMPF models (Venkatesan et al., 1997; Punithavathi et al., 2000) , and thus appears to be a potentially valuable treatment for PF.",

In addition, telangiectasis hyperemia, thrombogenesis, bronchiole stegnosis and wider mesenchyme also were found in the samples of Group PC viewed under a light microscope. Fig. 2 shows results of immunohistochemical analyses of Col-I, iNOS and TGF-\u24241 expressions and distributions in rat lung samples. Compared with the Group NC in which no abnormal change was found, Group PC samples showed a significantly strong expression of all three proteins. Negative controls ANOVA indicated intra-group differences for the proteins of Col-I (F = 12.261, P < 0.001), iNOS (F = 8.388, P < 0.001) and TGF-\u24241 (F = 112.979, P < 0.001), and mRNA of Col-I (F = 3.329, P < 0.05), iNOS (F = 7.605, P < 0.001) and TGF-\u24241 (F = 26.258, P < 0.001).

Whiles NO may stimulate transcription factor nuclear factor-B (NF-B) to promote TGF-\u24241 gene expression and consequently increase TGF-\u24241 production (Gossart et al., 1996) . Thus, it was postulated that a regulatory network including iNOS and TGF-\u24241 may be involved in the development of pulmonary fibrosis. Although an abnormal increase of iNOS in lung tissue may peak on the 5th day after bleomycin injection (Gurujeyalakshmi et al., 2000) , we found that pulmonary expressions of both iNOS protein and mRNA on the 28th day were 146 and 523% higher in BLMPF rats than that in normal rats. These abnormal iNOS levels indicated that an inflammatory injury existed in the lungs of experimental rats to the end of our experiments. Meanwhile, the over-expressions of both protein and mRNA of pulmonary TGF-\u24241 were shown on the 28th day in BLMPF rats. TGF-\u24241 may be another important causative factor, and play a key role during the process of pulmonary fibrosis by increasing the synthesis and secretion of ECM protein through stimulation of its gene transcription, and by decreasing degradation of ECM through inhibition of secretion of protein kinases (Robert et al., 1990) . It is well known that the Col-I expression is regulated by TGF-\u24241; therefore, depressing over-expression of iNOS and TGF-\u24241 may inhibit Col-I increase and collagen synthesis, and should be important therapeutic targets in preventing PF.",

The dose and duration of hydrocortisone designed for this study may have been too low and too short to display its toxicity. It has been reported that administration of curcumin at 500 mg/kg/day continually for 80 days did not produce any adverse effect in rats (Wo et al., 2000) . Our data confirmed that this dose was safe for rats in a 28-day treatment. Even so, a daily dose of 250 mg/kg should be recommended for future studies as its pharmacodynamic effects in prevention of BLMPF were similar to the daily dose of 500 mg/kg.",

Our data indicated that curcumin possesses therapeutic effects comparable to hydrocortisone in treating BLMPF rats. Oral administration of curcumin at a daily dose of both 500 mg/kg and 250 mg/kg significantly inhibited bleomycin-induced overexpressions of Col-I, iNOS and TGF-\u24241 at transcriptional and translational levels, and reduced pulmonary inflammatory injury and fibrosis. There was no significant difference between treatments with these two dosages. Curcumin, widely used as a food additive, did not show any adverse effect in our study. Therefore, it could be a valuable herbal component for PF treatment.",

Under the light microscope, few inflammatory cells appeared to be distributed around bronchiole, and alveolar structure was integrated in samples of Group NC (A). In contrast, in the samples of Group PC, there were large amounts of inflammatory cells distributed in wider mesenchyme, collapsed alveoli with lots of inflammatory exudates, and pulmonary hyaline membranes. Telangiectasis, hyperemia and thrombogenesis were also found in the alveolar wall (B). Meanwhile, compared with the Group NC (C), Masson's stain showed an excessive collagen deposition (green staining) in abnormal mesenchymal tissue in samples of Group PC (D) (For interpretation of the references to colour in this figure legend, the reader is referred to the web version of the article).",
