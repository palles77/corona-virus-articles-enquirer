Outbreaks can wreak much havoc before they are noticed, and they can grow at an exponential rate before they are brought under control. Some outbreaks spread so far we call them epidemics, or pandemics if they encompass the entire planet. Some outbreaks have never been brought under control. The only certainty is that an outbreak becomes more difficult to stop through human intervention the longer it goes unnoticed.",

Mitochondria, which provide the energy that fuels our cell processes (Penniston, 1997) , evolved from bacteria that were incorporated into primitive cells during the early stages of evolution. Of course, not all interactions between microbial organisms and humans are favorable. Human (and animal and plant) populations have been battling these unseen living organisms throughout the course of history and, in many instances, losing. William H.

Influenza is actually a family of viruses with three different types (A, B, and C) and many strains. Scientists create names for influenza strains in the A type based on two proteins (called antigens because they induce immunity in victims) that appear on the surface of the influenza virus and can be measured. Each antigen can take different forms, which are referred to as subtypes: Hemagglutinin (H) antigen with subtypes 1 to 15 and neuraminidase antigen (N) with subtypes 1 to 9. The 1918 virus was named H1N1 because it had on its surface subtype 1 of the hemagglutinin antigen and subtype 1 of the neuraminidase antigen.",

Reassortment is simply the exchange of genes between or among two or more different viruses to give birth to a hybrid virus. A prerequisite for reassortment is that the same cell in a bird or mammal must be simultaneously infected with two or more strains of influenza A. If a \"parent\" strain was capable of being transmitted from person to person, the descendant strain may inherit that ability. Reassortment is a common occurrence in influenza, and it is the key reason that influenza remains a major world health concern to this day. To elucidate whether the 1918 strain was a product of reassortment or mutation, over the past decade, researchers have searched from the frozen tundra of Alaska to the archives of the Smithsonian Institution to find preserved tissues of birds and humans who died in 1917 and 1918. By using modern techniques of molecular biology, they isolated snippets of genetic material from influenza A viruses isolated from these specimens and compared them with each other. They found that the virus taken from individuals known to have died from the pandemic strain was not a direct descendant from the viruses that they found in birds from that period.The best theory is that the 1918 strain was the result of a mutation, a reassortment of an influenza A virus or viruses circulating in mammals such as horses or swine, or both (Reid and Taubenberger, 2003) . Haskell County, Kansas, where animals outnumbered humans by a large factor, was just the type of location where influenza A strains from different mammalian species could converge to develop into the deadliest strain of influenza yet known to humankind (Barry, 2004) .",

Their mothers became aware of other similarly affected children in their community (American Museum of Natural History, 1998) and notified the local health department about this unusual circumstance. The local health department, suspecting the emergence of a new infectious disease, asked Dr. Allen Steere to investigate. His study of the children of Lyme produced several clues: the disease did not appear to spread from one person to another, it occurred most often in the summer when insect-borne disease was more common, and a rash often appeared before children developed arthritic symptoms, suggesting a tick-borne disease. In 1981, entomologist Willy Burgdorfer found the cause by looking at the digestive tracts of Ixodes ticks under a microscope. The bacterium he found, Borrelia burgdorferi, was named in his honor.",

At the same time, there was an increase in the number of orchards that were also used for swine farming. Swine were housed under the trees and fed fruit not suitable for marketing.

The positive FMD laboratory results led to movement restrictions for all livestock within a 20-km radius of an affected farm, the closure of all animal sale yards and abattoirs within the country, and the veterinary inspection of all farms within the affected region for signs of disease. Then slaughter of all animals from affected farms began. In addition, authorities took the controversial step of vaccinating animals from neighboring farms without disease in order to eliminate the infection and reduce its ability to spread from the region. Despite these interventions, over the next two months, the disease spread to two beef cattle farms situated 100 km away and to a dairy farm 150 km away from the initial outbreak.

First, hospitals may be agents for the spread of infectious diseases because they welcome all patients, including those who are infectious, immune compromised, or both. By concentrating individuals with communicable diseases and individuals who are especially susceptible to communicable diseases, hospitals provide an ideal environment for the spread of these diseases. Effective infection control procedures are the first step in preventing transmission of infection. However, infection control measures sometimes break down or may simply be ineffective for novel agents. Surveillance for infections transmitted in hospitals (nosocomial) is an important component of biosurveillance.",

This determination seems to depend not only on the magnitude of the exceedance but on the nature of the illness and other information that is available about the set of affected individuals. Thus, the current published definitions of outbreak and epidemic are necessary (i.e., there must be an exceedance) but not sufficient (some exceedances do not qualify) conditions for labeling an exceedance an outbreak. Scientific readers may feel somewhat uncomfortable to realize that a key concept in this area of scientific study is not defined in unambiguous terms. In our experience, this ambiguity does not undermine the foundations of research. It is simply something to be aware of.",

SARS illustrates the problems faced by hospitals and other facilities housing sick and vulnerable individuals. The cryptosporidiosis outbreak shows the importance of water surveillance and how there can be delays in detection even for an extremely large outbreak when many individuals are not sick enough to go to hospitals.
