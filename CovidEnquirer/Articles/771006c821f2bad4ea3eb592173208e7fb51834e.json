            "text": "Mouse hepatitis virus (MHV), a member of Coronaviridae, contains a linear single-stranded and positivesense RNA of 5.4 X 1 O6 Da (Lai and Stohlman, 1978) . The genomic RNA is enclosed in a helical nucleocapsid structure constructed from multiple copies of nucleocapsid protein (N) (Sturman, 1977) . Virions are enveloped and contain two virus-specific glycoproteins of 180 kDa (E2) and 23 kDa (El) (Sturman et al., 1980) . Upon entry into the host cell, the genomic RNA is translated into an early polymerase which directs the synthesis of a full-length negative-sense viral RNA (Brayton et a/., 1982; Lai et al., 1982) . In turn, the negative-sense RNA is transcribed by a late or altered early polymerase into the genomic RNA and six subgenomic mRNAs (Bray-ton eta/., 1984) . These mRNAs range from 0.6 to 5.4 X lo6 Da in length and are arranged in the form of a nested set from the 3'-end of the genome (Lai et a/., 1981) . The 5'-ends of each mRNA and the genomic RNA appear to contain an identical leader sequence of about 72 nucleotides, which are encoded only at the Y-end of the genome (Lai eta/., 1983 (Lai eta/., , 1984 Spaan et al., 1983) . The uv transcriptional mapping studies suggest that the mRNAs are not derived from cleavage of a large precursor RNA (Jacobs era/., 1981) nor is there any evidence indicating that nuclear factors are required for MHV replication (Brayton et a/., 1981; Wilhelmsen et al., 1981) . These data suggest that conventional eukaryotic RNA splicing is not involved in MHV transcription. Analysis of MHV replicative intermediate and replicative form RNAs suggests that a free leader RNA may be involved in subgenomic mRNA synthesis (Baric eta/,, 1983 ). In addition, discrete small leader-related RNAs of various sizes have been detected in MHV-infected cells (Baric et a/., 1985) . We have also isolated a ts mutant of MHV which synthesizes only small leader RNAs, but not mRNAs at the nonpermissive temperature (Baric et a/., 1985) . These data suggest that the MHV mRNAs are synthesized discontinuously and may utilize a single or multiple free leader RNAs as primers for the transcription of different subgenomic mRNAs. Additional proof that free transacting leader RNA(s) function in MHV transcription came from the demonstration of reassortment of leader RNAs between two different strains of MHV (Makino et a/., 1986b) . However, the exact leader RNA species which function in MHV transcription has not been identified.",

These data, coupled with the presence of discrete large leader-containing RNAs which range from 84 to 1000 nucleotides in length in MHV-infected cells (Baric et a/., 1985) suggest that discontinuous RNA intermediates may be dissociated and reassert between viral RNA templates to generate recombinant viruses by a copy-choice mechanism (Makino eta/., 1986a). Therefore, the larger leader-containing RNAs present in MHVinfected cells may represent functional intermediates of RNA transcription and recombination. In this paper, we have analyzed the origin, structure, and probable mechanism of synthesis of these RNAs. The data suggest that MHV RNA transcription may pause at sites corresponding to hairpin loops in the RNA template, and they support a mechanism of discontinuous RNA transcription in which RNA intermediates can be dissociated and reassociated with the RNA template intermittently during the course of transcription.",

Clones F82 and C96 represent overlapping regions in the 5'-end of the genomic RNA (Shieh et a/., 1987). F82 is a 3.8-kb clone representing the very 5'end of the genome including the leader RNA sequences, while clone C96 represents internal sequences in gene A. Two other clones representing the internal sequences of MHV genome were also used: Clone D63 contains entire sequences of genes D and E and part of genes C and F (Shieh, unpublished), and clone PHN42 spans the entire gene F (kindly provided by Dr. Heiner Niemann, Giessen, Germany). An internal Xbal fragment (0.4 kb), designated D63X, of clone D63, was used as the probe for gene D. This fragment includes nucleotides 47-375 in the mRNA 4 coding sequence as reported (Skinner and Siddell, 1985) . The construction of subclones derived from PHN 42 followed the procedures described by Maniatis er al. (1982) . Subclone El-500 was derived by blunt-end ligating a 509 nucleotide Ddel fragment, located between nucleotides 90 and 609 in the gene F sequence (Armstrong et al., 1984) into plasmid pT7-2 at the Smal site (pT7-2 was purchased from Amersham). Subclone El-300 was derived from a 246-nucleotide fragment, located between nucleotides 534 and 780 in the El RNA (Armstrong et a/., 1984) and was inserted into plasmid pT7-2 at the /-/indllllSmal site. El-L was excised from PHN 42 by an EcoRIIScal restriction digestion. It contains the first 84 nucleotides of the mRNA 6, including the 72-nucleotide leader RNA sequence. This fragment was used directly for nick translation without subcloning.

However, the probe representing the 5'-end sequences of gene A detected discrete species (Fig. 4A) , suggesting that the larger leader-containing RNAs may also represent RNA species derived from other regions of the genome during subgenomic RNA synthesis. Therefore, cDNA probes specific for the 5'-coding sequences of genes D and F were tested. The probe representing the 5'-end of the gene F (El-500) detected RNA species of 118, 123, 127, 143/l 45, 150, 158, 164, 169 , and two groups of poorly resolved RNAs ranging between 241-260 and 270-281 nucleotides in length (Fig. 5A ). These RNA species were different from those detected with the gene A probe (Fig. 4A ). In addition, they were not detected with a probe (El-300) representing the 3'-end of the gene between nucleotides 534 and 780 (Fig.  5C ). The gene D-specific cDNA probe (D63X) (Fig. 1 a) also detected a different set of small RNA species of 117, 135, 160, 168, 205, and 218 nucleotides in length (Fig. 58) . Smaller amounts of RNA of 173 and 199 nucleotides in length were also detected. These data suggest that transcription of subgenomic mRNAs also terminates or pauses at many sites. Computer models of RNA folding suggest the presence of hairpin loops in regions of nucleotides 105-122, 114-141, 123-167, 193-226 , and 242-285 within the sequence of mRNA6 (gene F) (Fig. 6b) and in the regions of nucleotides 106-l 31, 105-l 62, and 168-204 and 21 l-235 within mRNA4 (gene D) (Fig.  6a) . The predicted stability of these hairpin structures is shown in Table 1 . These data show that most of the small RNAs detected in MHV-infected cells have termination sites within the hairpin loop structures, suggesting a possible correlation between the generation of small RNAs and the presence of secondary structure in the template or product RNAs.",

Conversely, if RNA transcription proceeds in a continuous manner, the RNA species on the RI structure should be heterogeneous, without predominant RNA species. To distinguish between these two possibilities, 18-40 S RI RNA (Baric et a/., 1983; Sawicki and Sawicki, 1986) was isolated and analyzed for the presence of small leader-containing RNA using two probes, F82 and El -500, representing genes A and F, respectively. As shown in Fig. 7 , the small RNA species present on the RI RNA are the same as those present in the whole cell lysates. Furthermore, the 4 S RNA fractions also contain an identical set of small RNAs, indicating that some of the small RNAs were dissociated from the RI RNA. These results suggest that the small RNA species are true transcriptional intermediates.",

            "text": "Previous findings in our laboratory demonstrate that RNA recombination could occur at a very high frequency during a mixed infection with two strains of MHV (Makino et a/., 1986a). This high frequency is reminiscent of RNA reassortment described for viruses with segmented RNAs (Fields, 1981) and suggests that MHV replication might involve the generation of free and discontinuous RNA intermediates. These intermediates could participate in RNA recombination by a copy-choice mechanism. The detection of multiple discrete species of leader-containing RNAs, which range from 47 to more than 1000 nucleotides in length, in MHV-infected cells further supports this model (Baric et al,, 1985) . In this report, we examined the origin, structure, and mechanism of synthesis of these RNAs. The data suggest that these RNA species are likely to represent transcriptional pausing products of MHV RNA synthesis. The pausing sites correspond, in general, to the potential hairpin loops present in the template or product RNAs. This transcriptional pausing mech-anism is reminiscent of the transcriptional pausing of Q/3 phage RNA, in which RNA polymerase pauses in regions of hairpin loop structures (Mills et a/., 1978) . Pausing also occurs during DNA-directed DNA synthesis (Huang and Hearst, 1981; Sherman and Gefter, 1976) , DNA-directed RNA synthesis (Maizels, 1973; Rosenberg et al., 1978) and in reverse transcriptase reactions (Efstratiadis et al., 1975; Haseltine et al., 1976) . Similar to the mechanism of Qj3 RNA transcrip- tion, the majority of MHV small RNAs terminate at the 3'-side of hairpin loop structures in the product or template strands, which have free energies ranging from -1.6 to -77.1 kcal/mol ( Fig. 6 and Table 1 ). The stabilities of these hairpin loops are comparable to those of Q/3 (-9.8 to -23.8 kcal) and tRNA (-4.5 to -15.0 kcal) hairpin loops, whose existence in the RNA has been demonstrated by various physical and biochem-ical methods (Auron et al., 1982; Gehrke et al., 1983; Kramer and Mills, 1981) . Whether the pausing RNA intermediates of Qp or other pausing transcriptional model systems are dissociated from the RNA template is not known; however, the data presented in this paper clearly show that at least some of the MHV RNA intermediates are separated from the template RNA strand. It has previously been shown that the nascent RNA chains of G&I and MS2 phages are probably bound to the template strand only by short duplex regions (Weissman, 1974) . It is also possible that the MHV RNA polymerase is a nonprocessive enzyme, thus releasing some of the RNA intermediates after pausing. Currently, there is no direct evidence to prove that these free small RNAs actually rebind to the RNA template and participate in continuing transcription; however, the high frequency of RNA recombination (Makino et a/., 1986a) suggests that such rejoining does occur.",

Most interestingly, the crossover sites in the two recently isolated recombinants, A-l and A-5, have been mapped within a region of the leader sequences (nucleotides 35-60 from the 5'-end) (Keck eta/., 1987) , where three small RNA species were detected (Fig. 2) . The isolation of these recombinants strongly suggests the functional roles of the pausing RNA intermediates. It is noteworthy that, during the transduction of the proto-oncogene c-fps by a retrovirus, right-handed recombination occurred near or in stable hairpin loop structures (Huang et al., 1986) . These data, coupled with the fact that reverse transcriptase \"pauses\" in regions of secondary structure (Haseltine et al., 1976) suggest a common mechanism of recombination for retroviruses and coronaviruses, involving paused transcriptional intermediates. In addition, it has previously been shown that short oligonucleotides can act as primers for RNA synthesis in vitro (Minkley and Pribnow, 1973; Niyogi and Stevens, 1965) . Thus, it seems likely that the free RNAs in MHVinfected cells could also be used for chain elongation. Recently, our laboratory has shown that the MHV leader RNA can act in Vans to participate in RNA transcription (Makino et al., 1986b) .",

It is not clear, however, whether multiple leader RNAs are involved in priming mRNA transcription. According to our present model of leader-primed transcription, these leader RNAs would have to be cleaved before serving as primer (Shieh et a/., 1987) . These RNAs are likely generated due to the hairpin loop structures in nucleotides 52-72 and 80-l 43, and the intervening AU-rich sequences at the 5'-end of the genome (Fig. 3) (Shieh eta/., 1987) .",

Although the extremely small amount of these RNAs makes it impossible to resolve this issue definitively, several reasons argue for the interpretation that they were initiated from the same site: first, the leader-primed transcription mechanism of MHV ( Baric et al., 1983; Shieh et a/., 1987) indicates that the same primer is used for the transcription of various mRNAs; second, these RNA species are very reproducible in different RNA preparations and are present on replicative intermediate RNA; third, RNA recombinants have been isolated whose recombination sites may be in an area corresponding to the termination sites of these small RNAs (Keck et a/., 1986) suggesting that these RNAs have biological functions; and finally, correct initiation was noted in a similar study with QB phages (Mills et a/., 1978) .",
