Viruses are a cause of upper and lower respiratory tract infections in children and several of them have been described. Among these, respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) is most important, both in terms of prevalence and effect (3) . However, in recent years, several new viruses have emerged. These include human metapneumovirus (4), severe acute respiratory syndrome coronavirus (5) and human coronaviruses HKU1 and NL63 (6, 7) .",

They detected this virus by constructing libraries of amplified DNA and RNA from supernatants of nasopharyngeal aspirates of children with ARI and removing nonviral nucleic acids by ultracentrifugation, microfiltration, and treatment with DNase. From this analysis, a novel parvovirus sequence was obtained. The complete genome sequence was determined and HBoV was characterized. The only other related bocaviruses are bovine parvovirus and canine parvovirus 1 (CPV-1). A PCR detection method was devised that targeted the noncapsid protein-1 (NP-1) gene, and virus was detected in 24 (3%) of 806 children with ARI in Sweden. We used the same PCR detection method to determine whether HBoV is a potential cause of ARI in children in Jordan.",
