Here, we engineered random peptides to be displayed on T7 phage and screened the library against the selective pressure of ECM components found in solid tumors to collect peptide-presenting phage that permeated through the ECM. After successive rounds of selection, permeating phage were harvested, and using next generation sequencing and analysis, the most frequent peptides and motif sequences were identified and subsequently validated in transport studies. Diffusion assays were done to measure and identify peptide-presenting phage that exhibited most unhindered diffusivity through the ECM. Using one of the selected peptides, P4, as a model, we performed site-directed alanine mutagenesis to study the role of hydrophilicity, charge, and the order of the amino acid sequence on diffusive transport through the ECM. We next measured the ability of select peptide-presenting phage to achieve uptake in ex vivo ECM-rich pancreatic cancer xenografts. To demonstrate its feasibility as a surface coating for synthetic nanoparticles, the tumor penetrating peptide was conjugated onto polystyrene nanoparticles, and their diffusive transport in pancreatic tumor tissue was measured using multiple particle tracking and compared to PEG-functionalized and control uncoated nanoparticles. Phage display provides the molecular diversity that can be leveraged to screen and select peptides as surface coatings that facilitate diffusive transport and establish that charge, hydrophilicity, and their orientation govern transport through the tumor ECM.

A cysteine constrained 9-mer random peptide-presenting T7 phage library was engineered to effectively serve as a collection of peptide-based surface chemistries with a combination of amino acids possessing varying physicochemical properties. The phage library was incubated with a transwell coated with ECM components collagen I (7.8 mg/ml) and hyaluronic acid (HA) (0.84 mg/ml), which are predominant in the tumor microenvironment of pancreatic cancers [65] [66] [67] . The charged ECM components serve as an electrostatic interaction filter that has been shown to hinder diffusion of charged molecules 15, 67 . A 1 mm thickness of tumor ECM was prepared in the insert of a 24-well transwell. The phage library was added at the top of the ECM to allow it to diffuse through the tumor ECM model at 37 \u00baC. After 1 hour of incubation, phage that permeated through the ECM was collected, and a fraction of the output was quantified by standard double-layer plaque assay. The remaining fraction was amplified in E. coli to make more copies needed for the subsequent round of screening. This screening was iterated for three additional rounds and the overall selection was performed in replicate. Selection of peptides using phage libraries is typically reported from one or two screenings 68, 69 .",

In each replicate, we observed an increased amount of phage that permeated through the tumor-like ECM after four rounds (Figure 1b) . The average library titer (i.e. amount of phage) of both replicates increased 200-fold and 400-fold in the third and fourth round compared to the second round. In the third and fourth rounds, the increase of permeating phage suggests there is enrichment of the library for phage that may possess desired functionalities (i.e. unhindered transport) through the tumor-like ECM. There was no increase in the first two rounds, but the lack of initial enrichment is typically observed in phage selections 70 . The enrichment of phage during selection is expected, as observed with affinity-based panning against specific targets [70] [71] [72] . The copyright holder for this preprint (which was not peer-reviewed) is the author/funder. . https://doi.org/10.1101/659524 doi: bioRxiv preprint round 1 (R1) to round 2 (R2) and had moderate increase in rounds 3 and 4 (R3 and R4); these results have been observed by others and is indicative of their enrichment [69] [70] [71] 73 . From NGS data, we selected one peptide sequence from the original, na\u00efve library as a negative control for our subsequent experiments. This control peptide sequence is present in the original library, but its frequency decreased with successive rounds of selection, which suggests it was unable to withstand the selection pressure of the tumor-like ECM and cannot permeate through the barrier. Two additional sequences, P4 and P5-peptides, were selected from multiple sequence alignment using Seq2Logo as described elsewhere 69, 74 . Here, multiple sequence alignment of the top thirty frequent peptides from the fourth round of both replicates was done to identify the most abundant amino acid at each position of the 7-mer 75 . From this analysis, we generated and selected The selected peptides along with their physicochemical properties (net charge at pH 7.0 and hydropathy/hydrophobicity) are listed in Table 1 . Three of the five sequences selected are hydrophilic, one is hydrophobic, and one of the sequences is neither hydrophilic nor hydrophobic, which we term as hydro-neutral. The net charge of two of the selected sequences is negative, two are positive, and one of them has a net neutral surface charge at pH 7.0. The net charge of all the selected peptides are near neutral, ranging from -1.0 to +1.1. Table 1 .

We prepared the ECM within the channel of a microfluidic chamber \u00b5-slide (Figure 3a) . The tumor ECM in the channel provides a semi-infinite barrier to test the diffusivity of the phage clones. The encapsulated DNA of the phage was fluorescently labeled to avoid surface labeling of phage, which could change the surface properties of the phage and affect interaction and transport through the ECM. Phage were added to the input reservoir, and an equal volume of PBS is added to the output reservoir to maintain the hydrostatic pressure and to achieve a concentration gradient through the channels. Fluorescent images of the channel were acquired at different time points and processed to identify the fluorescence intensity at each time point over the distance of the entire channel (Figure 3b) . The normalized intensity value over the channel length and the entire diffusion time was used for nonlinear curve fitting with the Fick's second law of diffusion to calculate the diffusion coefficient of each clone using a customized MATLAB script ( Figure S2 ).",

Alternatively, due to molecular diversity of amino acids and their ordering in the peptide sequence, we can systematically manipulate select amino acids and determine their contribution to peptide-mediated transport through the ECM. To determine the impact of charge, hydrophobicity, and spatial order of physicochemical properties on transport through the ECM, we performed alanine mutagenesis on the selected P4. We substituted specific amino acids with alanine, which has an inert methyl functional side chain group that does not change the main conformation of the peptide, and thereby we removed the functional groups to create mutants with different surface physicochemical characteristics.

We measured and quantified ex vivo uptake of our peptide-presenting phage in ECM-rich BxPC3 pancreatic tumor xenografts 79 as described by Bajpayee et al. 80 . Briefly, the BxPC3 tumor tissue slices were preequilibrated in PBS with protease inhibitor and incubated with in a bath of sample, P4 or control-phage. We calculated the clone uptake ratio in the tissue by quantifying the amount of phage in the tissue to the amount in the incubation bath over several days. The average uptake of selected clone P4-phage dramatically increased from 1.67\u00d710 3 \u00b12.08\u00d710 3 after 1 day to 1.34\u00d710 8 \u00b12.31\u00d710 8 after 5 days of the incubation, whereas the tumor uptake of the negative control-phage only increased from 1.12\u00d710 3 \u00b14.94\u00d710 2 in 1 day to 7.27\u00d710 5 \u00b11.32\u00d710 5 in 5 days ( Figure 5) . Consequently, the uptake ratio of P4-phage is 200 times higher than that of the negative control-phage after five days of incubation with the ex vivo tumor tissue. At initial timepoints, the rate of uptake is similar for both clones, but at later timepoints, there is a larger concentration gradient for our selected clone. This gradient allows continued diffusion and further transport of the P4-phage into the tumor tissue than observed with the control-phage. The difference in concentration gradients resulting in improved tissue uptake has been observed in cartilage explants [80] [81] [82] and mucus hydrogels 63 .",

Both PEGylation and iRGD-coating improved the MSD of the nanoparticle 10-and 15-fold, respectively (Figure 6b) . This improvement is most likely due to their hydrophilic and less negative surface charge properties. Interestingly, the P4-peptide coating improved the MSD of the nanoparticle 40-fold, exhibiting greater improvement than the other coatings. Examining the individual particle diffusivity binned together as ensemble measurements through the tumor ECM, there is a shift in particle distribution towards higher MSD upon PEG or P4-peptide coating (Figures 6c and 6d) . In particular, there is a larger fraction of peptide-coated nanoparticles that are mobile and demonstrate rapid diffusivity (log MSD is greater than -0.5) compared to PEG-coated nanoparticles (5% to 1%, respectively). Given that the same molar ratio was used to conjugate peptide/PEG onto nanoparticles, this result suggests that the optimal peptide coating improves unhindered particle transport through the tumor ECM.",

We hypothesize that the mutations change the binding affinity of the peptide with the ECM, thereby hindering their diffusion. The role of binding interactions and its impact on diffusion has been observed in peptide transport in mucus and cartilage; however, further studies are warranted to confirm this mechanism in the tumor microenvironment. The model peptide-presenting phage exhibited increased uptake in tumor tissue compared to the negative control. Importantly, peptides are promising as surface coatings to improve nanoparticle transport through the tumor microenvironment. Peptide coatings reduce the hindered transport of uncoated nanoparticles through the tumor ECM and demonstrate improved transport compared to gold standard polymeric coatings.

The library is a collection of phage presenting cysteine-constrained random 7-mer peptides (denoted as CX7C) on the surface of the T7 gp10 capsid. We screened the phage library against the in vitro tumor ECM using a transwell assay.

Approximately 3.2\u00d710 8 plaque forming units (i.e. amount of phage) of the phage library was added at the top of the tumor ECM in the donor chamber. To allow sufficient time for phage to enter ECM prior to measuring diffusivity, a time lag of 15 minutes was allotted based on theoretical calculations for phage to achieve unhindered diffusion through saline.

The background intensity for each channel was subtracted from the spatiotemporal intensity profile and was then normalized based on the maximum fluorescence intensity. The intensity decay was plotted along with the penetration length after 6 hours of diffusion. The average diffusion coefficient of the clones was calculated from the non-linear curve fitting of each experimental normalized intensity decay values with the onedimensional analytical Fick's second law of diffusion (1). The diffusion coefficient was assumed to be independent of the concentration of the clone and the penetration depth. ",

Phage library was allowed to diffuse through the tumor ECM model prepared in the insert of a transwell. After one hour, phage was collected from the receiving chamber and part of the eluate was used for quantification using double-layer plaque assay. The remaining fraction was amplified for use in subsequent screening, which was performed for a total of four rounds.(b) Enrichment of phage library diffusing through in vitro tumor ECM. out represents the output titer of the phage library after 1 hour of permeation through the tumor ECM, and in represents the input titer.

Replicate 1 and Replicate 2 are the two replicates of the screening.Identification and selection of peptides using next generation sequencing (NGS) round of panning, a fraction of the permeated phage was subsequently used to identify the peptide sequences. Since the DNA sequence of the individual phage encodes for the peptide displayed on the phage surface, we used NGS to obtain a high number of DNA reads not feasible with Sanger sequencing, and the sequences were translated and sorted to identify abundant peptides present during our selection. DNA from the eluted phage was isolated and PCR amplified for the region encoding the random peptides, and the DNA were individually barcoded to identify selection round and replicate. The pooled, barcoded DNA sequences were run on Illumina MiSeq to obtain up to 10 5 -10 6 reads per sample. Using customized Python and bash scripts, the DNA reads were trimmed to the DNA sequences that encode for the displayed peptide and translated, and the peptides were counted and sorted by their frequency relative to the total number of reads.Sequences that contained truncations, premature stop codons, and/or did not contain the full amino acid sequence were excluded in subsequent analysis and experiments. We then determined the overall physicochemical properties of the thirty most frequent peptide sequences by in silico analysis (Figures S1a and S1b).",

The frequency of each individual peptide as a percentage of total number of reads from each round of panning was quantified(Figure 2)to determine if phage-displayed peptides were enriched during selection against the tumor-like ECM.

In nanomedicine, peptides have been traditionally thought of and used as ligands that are conjugated to improve cell targeting and internalization of small molecules, macromolecules, and nanoparticles56,57 . For example, peptides such as iRGD have been discovered through phage display as ligands that bind tumor vasculature and target tumor cells58,59 . However, there has also been an increasing emphasis to exploit the chemistry of the amino acids and their physicochemical properties to develop peptides as surface coatings tuned for desired functionalities. For example, there has been extensive work to develop zwitterionic peptides with positive and negative charged amino acids as nonfouling coatings on surfaces54,[60][61][62] . Additional work has showed that peptides with block configuration of charged amino acids (e.g. KKKKEEEE) can facilitate penetration through mucus hydrogels due to partitioning effects",
