In addition, special attention should be paid to the patient's underlying disease, since some of underlying diseases may have a significant impact on final judgment of counselors and psychiatrists. In summary, structured letter therapy has the outstanding advantages of helping psychological consultants and psychiatrists to continue counseling on psychological and mental problems under strict quarantine measures, but it also has many potential disadvantages that need to be further improved.",
