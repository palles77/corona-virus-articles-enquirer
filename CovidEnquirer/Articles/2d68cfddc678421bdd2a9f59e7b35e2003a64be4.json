Currently, many surveillance strategies and systems are in use around the world. An inventory of the data, surveillance strategies, and surveillance systems developed worldwide for the surveillance of infectious diseases is presented herein, with emphasis on the role of the microbiology laboratory in surveillance. Methods: The data, strategies, and systems used around the world for the surveillance of infectious diseases and pathogens, along with current issues and trends, were reviewed. Results: Twelve major classes of data were identified on the basis of their timing relative to infection, resources available, and type of surveillance. Two primary strategies were compared: disease-specific surveillance and syndromic surveillance. Finally, 262 systems implemented worldwide for the surveillance of infections were registered and briefly described, with a focus on those based on microbiological data from laboratories. Conclusions: There is currently a wealth of available data on infections, which has been growing with the recent emergence of new technologies. Concurrently with the expansion of computer resources and networks, these data will allow the optimization of real-time detection and notification of infections.",

            "text": "Classified as the second leading cause of death in humans by the World Health Organization, with approximately 15 million deaths worldwide every year, 1 infectious diseases remain a serious public health problem in the 21 st century. Among them, HIV/AIDS, tuberculosis, and malaria have been nicknamed the 'big three' because of their important impact on global human health. In 2011, tuberculosis infected two billion people and killed 1.3 million, malaria infected 207 million people and killed 62 700, and HIV infected 35.3 million people and killed 1.6 million. 2 For adequate measures to be taken to detect and fight infectious diseases, their surveillance is essential. Surveillance consists of ''the ongoing systematic collection, analysis, and interpretation of health data essential to the planning, implementation, and evaluation of public health practice, closely integrated with the timely dissemination of these data to those who need to know''. 3 Attempts to survey infectious diseases are not recent. One of the best known examples is the use of the London Bills of Mortality by clerks, starting in 1603, for weekly monitoring of the number of deaths in London. 4 Later, in 1854, John Snow performed a topographic study in London by systematically recording the addresses of people infected with cholera, to identify the source of the pathogen. 5 Currently, many surveillance strategies and systems are available around the world. Computer resources have expanded considerably, but infectious disease surveillance remains challenging. The 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic 6 and the current Ebola outbreak in West Africa 7 are recent examples showing that infectious diseases cannot be predicted and modelled reliably.",

The abnormal increase in the number of young homosexual men infected by Pneumocystis carinii in Los Angeles between 1980 and 1981 8 prompted the discovery of the HIV virus in 1983. 9 Similarly, the outbreak of a severe respiratory illness of unknown origin that affected 180 people who had attended a state American Legion convention in Philadelphia in July 1976 allowed the identification of Legionella pneumophila. 10 In late 2002, an unknown respiratory disease with no identifiable cause was diagnosed and reported in several people living in Guangdong Province in China. The syndrome, termed 'severe acute respiratory syndrome' (SARS), rapidly crossed borders and became a worldwide threat. 11 A coronavirus (SARS-CoV) was finally identified as the causative agent of the syndrome. 12 With consideration of these aspects, an inventory of the data, surveillance strategies, and surveillance systems developed worldwide for the surveillance of infectious diseases is presented herein, with emphasis on the role of the microbiology laboratory in surveillance.

These data include, among others, press dispatches from various origins like Reuters (http://fr.reuters.com/) and Humanitarian News (http:// humanitariannews.org/), electronic mail-based discussion groups like ProMED-mail (http://www.promedmail.org/), press articles, and institutional and non-institutional warning networks like the World Health Organization. 19,20",

Briefly, if a patient is positive for Mycobacterium tuberculosis, the state health department sends an anonymous report to the NTSS. Reports summarizing the data are then published on the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention website (http://www.cdc.gov/tb/topic/default. htm). In France, various disease-specific surveillance networks have been developed under the leadership of the Institut National de Veille Sanitaire (INVS), the French National Institute for Public Health Surveillance. Among these, special mention can be made of LaboVIH, a laboratory-based surveillance system implemented in 2001 for the national specific surveillance of HIV activity. 25 Twice a year, the INVS contacts all of the French biomedical laboratories (approximately 4300 laboratories in 2014) to collect data on the number of people tested for HIV and the number of people found to be positive for the first time in each laboratory in the network. 25 The analysis is then shared through the weekly INVS epidemiology report (http://www.invs.sante.fr). Such surveillance can be implemented internationally, as has been done for the European Gonococcal Antimicrobial Surveillance Programme (Euro-GASP). 26 This surveillance system was implemented in 2004 by the European Surveillance of Sexually Transmitted Infections Project (ESSTI) to provide data on the susceptibility of gonococci to various antibiotics by studying the evolution of gonococcal antibiotic resistance in the European Union and the European Economic Area. 26 All of the states included in the ESSTI were asked to participate in the Euro-GASP to contribute to the collection and antibiotic susceptibility testing of gonococcal strains in their laboratories. 26 ",

ESSENCE II transfers information to its users via secure websites. 31 To summarize, users can see data and results in different formats, including a map of the geographic distribution of data sent by users and clusters obtained by scan statistics or lists of alerts emitted after the detection processes. 31 ESSENCE II normally analyses data every 4 h but can also alter the processing period if real-time data are available. 31 The French armed forces developed a real-time syndromic surveillance system, ''le syst\u00e8 me d'Alerte et Surveillance en Temps r\u00e9 el'' or ASTER. [32] [33] [34] Briefly, every 10 minutes, the system collects medical data routinely transmitted via secure Internet connections by doctors, paramedics, and nurses who live with the French armed forces deployed outside of the country. The data include the numbers of military personnel suffering from various symptoms, including cardiovascular, gastrointestinal, and respiratory symptoms. Data are routinely analysed using the Current Past Graph method and the mean AE 2 or 3 standard deviations method . At the end of the process, a dashboard summarizing the epidemiological situation is presented to the health service of the armed forces based in Marseille, France, and doctors, paramedics, and nurses deployed with the armed forces obtain real-time feedback on the health status of the military personnel with whom they live.",

(2) Environmental laboratories, which perform analyses on environmental samples to determine their physical, chemical, and microbiological characteristics. (3) Commercial laboratories, which are large, independent laboratories that can perform tests on clinical and/or environmental samples. As these laboratories produce a large quantity of data, they can be central structures for surveillance systems. (4) Governmental laboratories, which include federal laboratories that perform reference laboratory testing and participate in the development of new laboratory technologies, state laboratories that are involved in the surveillance of various diseases, including communicable diseases but also in public health programs, local public health laboratories that play a role in the screening of diseases including tuberculosis or sexually transmitted infections, and other state or local laboratories that can provide valuable test results.",

Disease-specific surveillance has allowed the effective management of numerous epidemics and infectious diseases. Smallpox was successfully eradicated in 1978 after the World Health Organization initiated a smallpoxspecific mass vaccination program that included laboratory investigations. 39 Similar results were seen in the case of rinderpest, a disease directly infecting Artiodactyla species (cattle, eland, buffalo, etc.) causing famines. This disease was declared eradicated on May 25, 2011 after long-term efforts to fight it through the development of the disease-specific Global Rinderpest Eradication Programme. 40 Nevertheless, thanks to the global spread of Internet use and the unprecedented interconnectivity of people that this allows, it can be speculated that, in the future, improved syndromic surveillance systems will be coupled with disease-specific surveillance systems, as has already been done for influenza surveillance. 17 Many surveillance systems survey few pathogens and not necessarily throughout the year. The surveillance of infections needs to be more global and instantaneous. This is a prerequisite for the detection and notification of abnormal events related to infections, appropriate prioritization of public health threats, and the implementation of optimal strategies and policies. Such approaches appear increasingly feasible with the tremendous expansion of computer resources, networks, and the real-time acquisition and sharing of data worldwide. ",
