Additional concerns include health-care-associated and foodborne infections-both of which have been targets of broad prevention eff orts, with success in some areas, yet major challenges remain. Although substantial progress in reduction of the burden of vaccine-preventable diseases has been made, continued cases and outbreaks of these diseases persist, driven by various contributing factors. Worldwide, emerging and reemerging infections continue to challenge prevention and control strategies while the growing problem of antimicrobial resistance needs urgent action. An important priority for control of infectious disease is to ensure that scientifi c and technological advances in molecular diagnostics and bioinformatics are well integrated into public health. Broad and diverse partnerships across governments, health care, academia, and industry, and with the public, are essential to eff ectively reduce the burden of infectious diseases.",

In response to this report, both the National Institute of Allergy and Infectious Diseases of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) and the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) developed research and prevention strategies to reduce emerging infectious diseases 4, 5 and improve preparedness for outbreaks. At CDC, this plan led to the development and implementation of many new programmes designed to improve epidemiology and laboratory capacity at the national, state, and local levels. In the 1990s and early 2000s, substantial complementary investments were made to build similar, multilevel capacity against bioterrorism threats. During the past two decades, these networks, systems, and programmes have helped to forge strong links between clinical, research, and public health communities and strengthened US capacity to detect and respond to national and international outbreaks.",

For each US birth cohort receiving recommended childhood immunisations, around 20 million illnesses and more than 40 000 deaths are prevented, which results in about US$70 billion savings in direct and societal costs. 6 Since 2000, new vaccines against pneumococcal disease, rotavirus, meningococcal disease, herpes zoster, and human papillomavirus (HPV) have been introduced and recommended for diff erent populations as part of US public health policy. Immunisations against pneumococcal disease and rotavirus infection have had a substantial eff ect. Routine vaccinations for infants with a seven-valent pneumococcal conjugate vaccine (PCV7), which began in 2000, greatly decreased the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease in young children, and indirectly in adults. 7 From 1998-99 to 2007, overall incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease decreased by 45%; 8 in children (aged <5 years) the incidence of invasive pneumococcal disease decreased from around 99 cases per 100 000 population during 1998-99 to 21 cases per 100 000 population in 2008. 9 In 2010, a 13-valent vaccine (PCV13) was introduced that off ered protection against an additional six serotypes of Streptococcus pneumoniae. By the end of 2011, rates of invasive pneumococcal disease caused by these six serotypes had decreased by nearly 90% in children younger than 5 years and by 45-64% in adults compared with pre-PCV13 introduction rates. 10 Rotavirus vaccination, recommended for US infants from 2006, has had a substantial eff ect on the number of hospital admissions for diarrhoea in young children. Compared with pre-vaccine years, an estimated 77 000 fewer admissions for diarrhoea occurred in US children (aged <5 years) during 2008-09, which reduced hospital costs by around $242 million. 11 Substantial and sustained decreases in rotavirus activity have occurred during every rotavirus season since the vaccine was introduced, with the number of positive rotavirus tests decreasing by 74-90% during 2010-11 and 2011-12 rotavirus seasons compared with pre-vaccine years. 12 The success of these vaccines could mask the toll and dangers of these once prevalent infections; thus focused eff orts are needed to communicate the continued importance of immunisations.",

Although the USA was declared to have eliminated measles in 2000, 17 around 50-100 imported cases occur every year. In 2011, however, more than 220 measles cases and 17 outbreaks were reported in the USA, mainly linked to large outbreaks in several European countries. 18 This number was the highest yearly total of US reported cases of measles since the elimination of this disease until 2014, when ongoing outbreaks had resulted in almost 288 cases by May 23. 19 These cases emphasise the importance of maintaining high vaccination coverage and ensuring appropriate messaging for travellers. Such cases can also present specifi c concerns for health-care settings. Because cases of measles are rare, health-care providers might not recognise signs or symptoms, which can facilitate further spread, including by health-care providers who do not have complete immunisations or immunity. 20 Containment of measles outbreaks requires substantial public health resources. Estimated public health costs from two 2011 outbreaks in Utah aff ecting 13 people exceeded $330 000. 21 In 2006, the largest US outbreak of mumps in two decades was reported, with 6584 cases-most from eight mid-western states and colleges. 22 As with other US mumps outbreaks, 23,24 cases mainly included people living in close proximity such as dormitories and occurred despite high coverage rates of two-dose vaccine. Although the need for a third-dose of mumps-containing vaccine to be given during outbreaks and for the development of an improved vaccine has been discussed, the benefi t of these additional strategies is unclear.",

In the mid-1990s, pertussis vaccination shifted from whole-cell to an acellular vaccine to reduce adverse events. However, in the mid-2000s, illness in children and teens began to rise despite high vaccination rates, which prompted new recommendations for a pertussis booster (Tdap) in teenagers. 25 Even with these new recommendations, pertussis rates have continued to increase, with substantial outbreaks in California in 2010, 26 and in Washington State in 2011-12. 27 A retrospective study 28 in California showed that waning immunity from the acellular vaccines was the probable cause of disease resurgence. Research is in progress to improve defi nitions for predictors of immunity and to strengthen control eff orts. Priority activities are focused on reduction of pertussis-related deaths, which occur mainly in young infants, prompting US recommendations for Tdap vaccination for pregnant women and people in close contact with infants. 29",

            "text": "Every year, around one in fi ve patients acquires an HAI in US hospitals. 30 These infections result in about $26-33 billion in excess medical costs and around 99 000 deaths yearly. 30, 31 However, these estimates do not include the substantial burden and consequences of HAIs in non-hospital settings such as long-term care facilities, dialysis settings, and outpatient clinics, where an increasing number of invasive practices are done. HAI reduction strategies largely focus on endemic problems such as catheter-associated urinary tract infections, central-line-associated bloodstream infections, and surgical-site infections, all of which can fuel antimicrobial resistance. Investigations of HAI-related outbreaks can provide important information for improvements in infection control. 32 For example, infections due to unsafe injection practices, 33 including reuse of syringes and inappropriate use of single-use vials, have led to targeted educational campaigns for both patients and health-care providers. 34 Outbreaks have also occurred from contaminated products including those prepared in compounding pharmacies. In 2012-13, a large HAI outbreak in the USA-involving more than 14 000 patients who were potentially exposed and resulting in 751 reported cases of fungal infections, including 384 cases of meningitis and 64 deaths across 20 states 35 -was caused by injections of contaminated steroids produced by a single compounding facility. 36 In the early to mid-2000s, several large-scale US regional and state-wide projects showed substantial decreases for central-line-associated bloodstream infections in intensive care units through focused eff orts to increase adherence to a set of recommended practices for insertion and maintenance of intravascular catheters. 37, 38 Momentum from these and other successes [39] [40] [41] led to new federal, state, and local eff orts to prevent HAIs. In 2009, a national action plan was released, setting goals and metrics for the prevention of HAIs. 42 Additional eff orts included state mandates for HAI reporting to improve accountability and fi nancial incentives off ered by the Centers for Medicare and Medicaid Services for adherence to CDC's infection control guidelines. All 50 states now have HAI prevention plans and state HAI coordinators, resulting in stronger links between health-care facilities, state health departments, state hospital associations, and qualityimprovement organisations.",

            "text": "A major component of eff orts to reduce HAI infections is CDC's National Healthcare Safety Network (NHSN), the most extensive and widely used HAI tracking system in the USA. With NHSN, data for HAIs and other related issues, including adherence rates of infection control, use of antibiotics, infections with multidrug-resistant organisms, and safety and vaccinations of health-care personnel, are obtained and made available to facilities, states, and regional and national organisations to help to identify and correct problems and to measure progress. Established as the National Nosocomial Infections Surveillance System in 1970, NHSN includes more than 12 000 facilities in all 50 states and extends beyond hospitals to include outpatient dialysis centres and nursing homes. Numbers of participating facilities and types of data obtained are expected to increase in the future. Reports of NHSN data, including national and state-specifi c reports of standardised infection ratios, have shown many successes in the reduction of the burden of certain HAIs, including a 41% decrease in central-line-associated bloodstream infections, 17% decrease in surgical-site infections, and 7% decrease in catheter-associated urinary tract infections in 2011 when compared with baseline (2008, 2009) rates. 43 Despite these successes, additional eff orts are needed, with intensifi ed actions aimed at reduction of antibiotic-resistant threats. 44 Comprehensive approaches are needed to prevent introduction and spread of infections as patients move between and within health-care facilities and into communities. A major concern is Clostridium diffi cile infection, a common and sometimes fatal infection that occurs mainly in association with health-care settings in patients receiving antibiotics. Transmitted by the faecal-oral route, C diffi cile infections rapidly spread in these settings because spores can survive on fomites and environmental surfaces for months. From 2000-09, discharge diagnoses of C diffi cile infection in patients in US hospitals more than doubled-from 139 000 to 336 600-and the number of patients with a primary C diffi cile infection diagnosis tripled, from 33 000 to 111 000, and only recently have these infections begun to plateau. 45 47 CRE infections can be severe, with mortality rates more than 40%, 48 and can easily spread from hospitals to other health-care settings in communi ties. CRE containing New Delhi metallo-\u03b2-lactamase (NDM) are of particular concern; NDM enzymes can be encoded on plasmids, which spreads multidrug-resistance to other Enterobacteriaceae and other bacteria. Identifi cation of patients colonised by or infected with CRE and segregation of patients and staff can reduce these infections, 49 but additional steps are needed. A crucial measure to control antibiotic resistance is eff ective implementation of antibiotic stewardship programmes to restrict the use of these drugs for appropriate indications. Additional eff orts include enhanced surveillance and laboratory networks with advanced molecular diagnostic capacities to improve detection, characterisation, and control of these infections.",

In 2012, 5674 cases, including 2873 cases of WNV neuroinvasive disease and 286 deaths, were reported. 65 Texas was at the epicentre of the 2012 outbreak 66 with about a third of all reported cases. 64 High proportions of WNV neuroinvasive disease suggest reporting bias, however, because severe cases are more likely than mild cases to be reported and asymptomatic infections would probably not be detected. Data from population-based surveys show that Year in all people who become infected with WNV (including people with asymptomatic infections) less than 1% will develop severe neuroinvasive disease. 67 In addition to WNV, dengue fever, the most prevalent vector-borne viral disease in the world, is resurging globally, aff ecting millions of people, including in Asia (70% of all cases, worldwide), Africa (16%), and the Americas (14%). 68 Puerto Rico, which has had epidemics of dengue activity periodically since 1963, reported the largest dengue outbreak in its history in 2010, with more than 21 000 cases. 69 In 2009 and 2010, Florida reported the fi rst cases of dengue acquired in the continental USA outside of the Texas-Mexico border since 1945. 70 The Pan American Health Organization (PAHO) and CDC are working to strengthen dengue control in the Americas and to ensure public heath preparedness for detection and control of exotic mosquito-borne diseases. One example is chikungunya fever, 71 a dengue-like disease fi rst detected in Tanganyika in 1953 that spread to parts of Asia and Europe, 72 and has now emerged in the Americas. 73 Between December, 2013, and June, 2014, cases of chikungunya infection have been reported in almost 20 countries in the Americas, mainly in the Caribbean. 73 The incidence and geographical spread of tick-borne diseases is increasing in the USA. Lyme disease-the most commonly reported vector-borne illness in the USA-has spread from northeast to mid-Atlantic regions and the upper Midwest along with its insect vector (the black-legged tick, Ixodes scapularis); these insects can also carry parasites that cause babesiosis and bacteria that cause human granulocytic ehrlichiosis. 74 Additional areas endemic for Lyme disease occur along the Pacifi c coast. 75 Another endemic tick-borne disease, Rocky Mountain spotted fever-caused by the bacterium Rickettsia rickettsii-has become a particularly serious problem on Arizonan tribal lands in areas where the disease was not previously reported. These disease outbreaks represent the fi rst time that Rhipicephalus sanguineus, the brown dog tick, has been confi rmed as a vector for Rocky Mountain spotted fever in the USA. 76, 77 This tick feeds on dogs at every stage of its life cycle and usually lives in and around homes. CDC, the Arizona Department of Health Services, the Indian Health Service, and tribal health departments are working to test a prevention and vector control strategy for Rocky Mountain spotted fever that includes homeowner education, use of acaricides, tick collaring, and control of the local dog population. 78 Additionally, within the past 4 years, two previously unknown tickborne pathogens whose epidemiology, transmission patterns, and clinical spectrum of illness remain unclear, have been identifi ed in the USA: an Ehrlichia muris-like agent in Minnesota and Wisconsin 79 and the Heartland phlebovirus in Missouri. 80 Public health eff orts to reduce illness and deaths from zoonotic and vector-borne diseases focus on improvements to disease surveillance, public health education, treatment, and prevention, and on actions to sustain and strengthen vector control programmes. 81 These strategies also off er increased opportunities to improve collaborations for infectious disease control between human, animal, and environ mental health experts-the concept of One Health.",

Although progress to address several key foodborne pathogens has been made, 86 particularly with Shiga toxinproducing E coli serotype O157, in recent years progress has stalled. 87, 88 The rate of Salmonella infections-the most commonly reported foodborne infection-has been largely unchanged. 88 In the USA, Salmonella causes around 1 million infections 82 and $365 million in direct medical costs every year. 86 An important component in eff orts to identify and stop foodborne disease outbreaks is PulseNet, a national network of public health and food regulatory agency laboratories that use pulsed-fi eld gel electrophoresis (PFGE) patterns to identify clusters of foodborne illnesses that might signal an outbreak. In the USA, more than 80 state and federal laboratories participate in this For more on PulseNet see http:// www.cdc.gov/pulsenet/ surveillance system and submit PFGE patterns from six bacterial pathogens to a CDC database to identify similar cases of foodborne illnesses that might signal an outbreak. Over the past 15 years, this system has detected hundreds of outbreaks, enabling faster and more accurate responses. PulseNet-triggered investigations have resulted in the recall of more than 1\u00b75 billion pounds of contaminated food and have prompted new actions by industry and food regulatory agencies to make food safer. Since 2006, data from foodborne disease investigations have identifi ed more than a dozen newly implicated foods in foodborne disease outbreaks (panel). Data from nearly 4600 outbreaks in 1998-2008 were used to help to establish the proportion of foodborne illnesses attributable to specifi c food commodities across 17 major food categories. Produce accounted for almost half of all foodborne illnesses from these outbreaks, with most deaths caused by meat and poultry. 89 Because many foodborne disease outbreaks occur across many states and countries and therefore could go undetected, eff orts to ensure the continued capability of laboratory-based and cluster-detection surveillance systems such as PulseNet are crucial. Detection of bacterial pathogens is changing from culture to an increased use of point-of-care molecular tests. 90 Although these tests have great potential for broader applications in detection and control of infectious diseases, the increased use of cultureindependent diagnostics brings new challenges to public health laboratory-based surveil lance systems that rely on culture and bacterial isolates for strain identifi cation. Fundamental changes in these systems are needed to ensure their continued eff ectiveness.",

In the USA, around 1\u00b71 million people are living with HIV. 91 The epidemic is generally concentrated in urban areas and disproportionately aff ects African-Americans, Latinos, and men who have sex with men (MSM). 91 Overall, incidence has remained stable for more than a decade, 92 with an estimated 47 500 new infections in 2010. 93 However, in young MSM, particularly young black MSM, rates of new infections have increased, 93 prompting targeted campaigns to help to engage with these populations. 94 Despite public health recommendations for routine HIV testing for people aged 13-64 years, 95 around 16% of people infected are unaware of their infection, 91 precluding access to life-prolonging treatment and increasing the risk of transmission to their sexual partners. With data showing that antiretroviral drugs reduce the risk of HIV transmission and acquisition, 96,97 prevention eff orts include treatment for people living with HIV and preexposure prophylaxis (PrEP) for people who are HIV negative but at a substantial risk for HIV. Only 25% of the US population with HIV is virally suppressed, and improvements are needed at each stage of the continuum of care, with particular attention to disparities in race or ethnicity and age. 98 For example, young people are less likely to have their infection diagnosed or have viral suppression compared with other age groups. 98 To address the US epidemic, the National HIV/AIDS Strategy (NHAS) was released in 2010, with main goals to: reduce HIV incidence; increase access to care and improve health outcomes for people with HIV; and reduce HIV-related health disparities. 99 CDC's eff orts to advance the NHAS goals are focused on the combination of evidenced-based, cost-eff ective, and scalable prevention interventions for geographical areas and populations with the greatest burden of HIV. Expanded surveillance to monitor community CD4 cell counts and viral loads is also increasingly used to target high burden areas. 100 As new prevention options such as PrEP emerge, operational research will guide implementation of interventions, whether biomedical, behavioural, or structural, to strengthen eff orts to mitigate the US epidemic. 101",

Around 800 000 to 1\u00b74 million people in the USA are chronically infected with hepatitis B virus (HBV) and 2\u00b77-3\u00b79 million have chronic hepatitis C virus (HCV). 107 Racial and ethnic minorities are disproportionately aff ected; HCV prevalence in non-Hispanic black people is about double that in non-Hispanic white people, 108 and Asian and Pacifi c Islanders account for more than half of all Americans living with chronic HBV infection. 109 Many people with chronic hepatitis do not know that they are infected, which increases their risk for cirrhosis or liver cancer and for unknowingly transmitting infection. A national action plan for viral hepatitis, released in 2011 and updated in 2014, provides steps to improve prevention, increase diagnosis and access to care for individuals infected, and improve coordination of federal and partner eff orts. 110 With improvements in treatment for HCV now available, CDC has issued revised HCV testing recommendations 111 that augment risk-based guide lines 112 and recommend one-time testing for people born between 1945 and 1965 to identify undiagnosed infections 113 and link individuals with HCV to care. People in this designated baby boomer age cohort now account for around 75% of prevalent HCV infections and HCV-related mortality. 114 Implementation of these revised testing recommendations could thus identify an estimated 800 000 additional cases and avert about 120 000 deaths. 115",

            "text": "For any country, eff ective control of infectious diseases is dependent on focused eff orts to decrease endemic infections in at-risk and susceptible populations, combined with strong epidemiological and laboratory capacity to detect and stop emerging threats. Inherent in these eff orts are well established links between clinical, public health, and research communities working with non-traditional partners such as industry, law enforcement, businesses, and the media. Although at their core these collaborations need to be established locally, such crucial partnerships have to extend across state, national, and international levels. Together, these alliances can form a global infrastructure and system to detect and control infectious diseases. With that aim, in February, 2014, the USA and other nations joined WHO, the Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations, and the World Organization for Animal Health in a new global health security agenda designed to enhance strategies to prevent, detect, and respond to threats of infectious disease. 123 Partner countries will work together to meet a series of objectives covering crucial issues aff ecting control of infectious disease such as antimicrobial resistance, biosafety and biosecurity, global disease detection and response networks, and emergency responses. Much emphasis has been placed on the aptly named perfect storm inherent in today's globalised world for rapid emergence and spread of infectious diseases. Despite this persistent challenge, extraordinary achievements in science and technology continue to bolster the capacity to recognise and respond to these threats. Scientifi cally, next-generation sequencing and state-of-the-art bioinformatics capabilities are transforming the practice of microbiology and the speed at which infectious pathogens can be detected and analysed. 85,124 These technologies provide a new level of information about infectious pathogens and therefore off er tremendous opportunities for public health eff orts to detect and control outbreaks, target antimicrobial resistance, and develop and refi ne treatments and vaccines. [125] [126] [127] Additionally, the increasing understanding of the role of human microbiomes in disease development and new links between infectious agents and chronic diseases opens new possibilities for disease prevention and treatment. 128 Advances in electronic communications have also been essential and have enabled rapid sharing of health and safety information and expertise by health-care and public health workers, researchers, law enforcement, the media, and private individuals. These communication capacities can facilitate and enhance research and public health partnerships worldwide, generating broad sharing of research fi ndings and health updates in near real time. The latest surge in health communications has come from social media tools, which are increasingly being used to extend the reach of public health information. To ensure that these rapidly changing scientifi c and technological advances are routinely used in public health is a crucial challenge and priority.",
