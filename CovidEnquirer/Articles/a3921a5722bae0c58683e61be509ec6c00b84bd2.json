All orthomyxoviruses are influenza viruses that infect humans or animals. The segmented nature of the viral genome permits ready genetic reassortment when two influenza viruses infect the same cell; this explains the high rate of natural variation among influenza viruses.

There are certain viruses that have insufficient information to permit classification. Re-cently, unconventional virus-like forms of life have been discovered that have entirely different properties. These forms have been termed as vimids and prions. The term '~iroids\" has been introduced for a new class of subviral agents characterized by the apparent absence of an extracellular dormant phase (virion) and by a genome much smaller than those of known viruses. Viroids are infectious, low molecular weight circular RNA molecules that lack protein shells (capsid) and are resistant to heat and organic solvents but sensitive to nucleases and are responsible for a variety of plant diseases. The name \"prices\" has been proposed for another new class of proteinaceous infectious particles that lack any detectable nucleic acid. Prions are resistant to heat, UV rays, and nucleases, but are sensitive to proteases and they seem to be nonimmunogeneic.",

On the other hand, veterinary AST (VAST) is conducted by a variety of laboratories ranging from the large state-of-the-art (university, state, or private) to a practitioner's back offlee; all without accepted guidelines or standards. It has been the custom for the more proficient laboratories to follow the existing National Committee for Lalxr-ratt~ Standards (NCCL~) standards, but each may use different modifications of these ~ocedmes to accommodate the fastidious pathogens associated with veterinary bacteriology. In addition to the discrepancies of media and methods, the only source of interpretive criteria for determining the susceptibility of vetexinary pathogens has been developed using human pathogens, pharmacokinetics, and clinical trials. These extrapolated criteria have led to some confusion when veterinary laboratory results are applied in actual clinical veterinary practice.To address this situation the NCCLS Area Committee on Microbiology has recently formed a subcommittee (NCCLS Subcommittee on Veterinary Antimicrobial Susceptibility Testing) to address the unique needs of laboratories and clinicians dealing with antimicrobial susceptibility testing of bacteria from cattle, swine, poultry, horses, dogs, and lactating dairy cattle. The subcommittee was formed in 1993 and comprises representatives from the animal health industry, university laboratory diagnosticians, test equipment manufactm'ers, government regulatory officials, veterinarY.% and members of the human use AST committee. The VAST subcommittee is charged with the task of developing standards for the performance of AST and rational interpretive criteria for specific antibiotics and animal species, and assisting government and animal health industry regulatory groups in developing the testing criteria for new as well as for existing antimicrobial agents.The fast step taken by the subcommittee was to develop methodological standards for VAST. It was decided to use the current NCCLS documents for easily grown aerobic Imlhogens such as gram-negative organisms (e.g., pasteurellae, entcrics) and gnun-positive organisms (e.g., staphylococci and streptococci) as a starting point in developing a tentative document of specific veterinary standards (1, 2) . In addition, current working groups are addressing standardization of media and conditions for the growth of fastidious pathogens such as Actinobacillus pleuropneumoniae (swine respiratory pathogen) and Haemophilus somnus (cattle pathogen). Anaerobic microorganisms, mycobacteria, mycoplasma, spirochetes, and agents of minor disease concern have been intentionally excluded at this time. Quality control organisms and antimierobial agents used in both human and veterinary medicine are accepted by the subcommittee (e.g., penicillins, erythromycin, tetracycline, tested with American Type Culture Collection strains);",
